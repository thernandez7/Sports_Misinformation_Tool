Jones asked Giants President John Mara for his release on Friday morning, according to a statement, and they mutually agreed that it would be best for him and the team. Obviously, this news comes after the Giants decided to demote Jones to their fourth-string quarterback, rolling with Tommy DeVito as the starter, likely due to injury guarantees in Jones’ pricey contract. It’s probable that Jones will clear waivers because of that contract. But where will he end up? Let’s take a look at teams that could bring him in. The Raiders are probably better than their 2-8 record indicates. Much of that has to do with their revolving door at quarterback between Aidan O’Connell and Gardner Minshew.  The Raiders gave up on Davante Adams when they traded him to the New York Jets, practically waving the white flag this season. But the best part about a lost season? It allows you the opportunity to try something new.  Adding Jones to the underwhelming mix of O’Connell and Minshew will at least give the Raiders a look at a player that could be their bridge to Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders or Miami’s Cam Ward, who will likely be drafted to Las Vegas in the 2025 NFL Draft. Can we stop and appreciate just how funny this would be?  By this point, everybody knows that the Giants made the massive mistake of letting Saquon Barkley walk in free agency and sign with their division rival. Now the Eagles have a chance to double dip and sign Barkley’s old buddy Jones, who would be a serviceable insurance policy behind Jalen Hurts.  Hurts’ current backup is Kenny Pickett, so it’s unlikely they gamble on another reclamation project with Jones, but the Eagles have the opportunity to do the funniest thing ever. Oh, you thought we were done being funny? Not so fast. Dak Prescott is out for the year, and this Cowboys season is already a joke. The absolute best outcome would be for the Cowboys to sign Jones. Do yourself a favor and look up who the Cowboys play on Thanksgiving Day. You guessed it. The Giants. Right after the election, nobody wants to hear their drunk uncle yap about politics. The Cowboys can save us from that nightmare and let Danny Dimes turn loose against his old team. Remember that beautiful thing about lost seasons? That you can try something new? That applies for the Tennessee Titans as well. Brian Callahan’s first season as head coach with the Titans has not gone as planned. Will Levis and Mason Rudolph are the only two quarterbacks in that room, and neither of those players appears to be the answer.  The Titans will have a great draft pick, but this is an underwhelming quarterback class. Perhaps Jones could serve as the bridge quarterback to 2026 in Tennessee. Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,0,0.52,0.48

The league announced the switch on Friday. In May 2023, NFL owners approved moving a maximum of two Thursday night games scheduled in Weeks 13 through 17. It was to be a trial program for the 2023 season but extended to 2024 if no games were flexed in the earlier year. None were. Entering Week 12 play, both the Chargers (7-3) and the Broncos (6-5) sit in wild-card position, with the Kansas City Chiefs (9-1) penciled into a spot as well as leaders of the AFC West. The Bengals (4-7) have a playoff probability of 13 percent, while the chances of the Browns (3-8) stand at less than 1 percent, according to the NFL. Both teams already have played a Prime Video game this season. The Bengals lost to the Baltimore Ravens 35-34 in a Lamar Jackson vs. Joe Burrow classic on Nov. 7, while the Browns beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 24-19 after scoring a touchdown on a snow-covered field in Cleveland on Thursday.

Martino confirmed reports that he was voluntarily leaving his position due to personal reasons and said he is returning to his native Argentina.  Per Inter Miami, the club's search for a new head coach is underway and is ""expected to conclude in the near future."" Multiple outlets, however, reported that Argentina under-20 coach Javier Mascherano will be named as the head coach of Inter Miami for the 2025 season. Martino guided the Lionel Messi-starring club to 74 points (22-4-8) and the Supporters' Shield in the regular season, but Inter Miami fell short in the MLS Cup Playoffs. The club was eliminated in the first round by No. 9 seed Atlanta United. Martino said he made his decision to step down prior to the team's loss to Atlanta. ""It has been an honor to work at such a special club and to lead such a special team,"" Martino said Friday. ""I've enjoyed my stay at Inter Miami and will treasure the memories made and relationships forged here for the rest of my life. ""I depart with nothing but gratitude for my time here and would like to offer sincere thanks to everyone who made it possible."" Martino, 61, joined Inter Miami in June 2023 after three-plus years at the helm of Mexico's national team. He left that role after Mexico failed to advance out of group play in the 2022 World Cup for the first time in nearly 45 years. Inter Miami won the Leagues Cup 2023 tournament after the arrival of Martino and superstars Messi and Sergio Busquets that summer. ""Tata will forever have a special place in Inter Miami history,"" Inter Miami managing owner Jorge Mas said. ""He guided us through a period of transformation and brought us our first titles in the process, which is what we aspire to as an ambitious organization. More importantly, he led Inter Miami with the unimpeachable class and professionalism. His contributions to our club have been immense, and we thank him for that, but above all, for who he is as a human being."" Previously, Martino led Atlanta United to the MLS Cup title in 2018. He chose not to renew his contract after that season, again citing personal reasons. Mascherano, 40, coached Argentina at the 2024 Paris Olympics, with the team losing in the quarterfinals. He was a longtime teammate of Messi both internationally and with FC Barcelona.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.31,0.69

Jones was demoted to a scout team safety in Thursday's practice, three days after head coach Brian Daboll made the decision to turn to former undrafted free agent Tommy DeVito as the team's starting quarterback. The Giants (2-8) have lost five in a row and reside in the cellar of the NFC East. ""The opportunity to play for the New York Giants was truly a dream come true and I am extremely grateful ... for the chance to play here,"" Jones said Thursday. ""The Giants are truly a first-class organization and I have nothing but genuine respect and appreciation for the people who built it and who help carry on the tradition. I've met so many special people and created relationships that will truly last a lifetime. Thank you to all my teammates, coaches and staff that have done so much for me these past six years. There have been some great times, but of course we all wish there had been more of those."" Ranked 32nd among all qualified quarterbacks in passer rating this season, Jones has eight touchdowns and seven interceptions in 2024. He also carried an injury guarantee worth $23 million for this season that the Giants didn't want to risk paying only to likely cut ties with him in the offseason. Jones, 27, was a first-round pick in 2019 and signed a four-year, $160 million contract in 2023. He suffered a season-ending ACL tear last season but returned in time to start the season as the No. 1 quarterback. He was benched with a record of 3-13 over his past 16 starts. The remainder of Jones' contract partially can be wiped off the books with his release before March 2025. ""I take full responsibility for my part in not bringing more wins. No one wanted to win more games worse than me and I gave everything I had on the field and in my preparation,"" Jones continued. ""Of course, this season has been disappointing for all, and of course I wish I could've done more. I'm 100 percent accountable for my part. I did not play well enough, consistently enough help the team get the results. The reality of the NFL is it's hard to win games and requires consistent performance from everyone involved. We didn't do that well enough so the idea to change something happens, and I understand. ""I love the game, I love being part of a team and I'm excited for the next opportunity. I know that there's a lot of good football in front of me and I'm excited about that,"" Jones said. ""To all fans, I have deep respect and appreciation for your passion and love for the Giants. The fans are huge part of what makes playing for the Giants so special."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.35,0.65

The Hoyas entered the season with plenty of questions as to who would play where and when under second-year coach Ed Cooley. Georgetown retained just two starters and welcomed 14 new players after last year's 9-23 finish. Jayden Epps predictably has been solid so far his second season with the Hoyas, averaging 15.3 points per game, but two newcomers have provided Cooley some much-needed stability early on. Freshman forward Thomas Sorber logged two double-doubles in his first four games and leads Georgetown (3-1) in both scoring (17.8 points per game) and rebounding (9.5). TCU transfer guard Micah Peavy averages 12 points and is shooting 48.7 percent from the field.  The duo combined for 26 points, 16 boards and nine assists in Wednesday's 79-51 home win over Mount St. Mary's.  The blowout also let Cooley substitute players who need more experience ahead of the Hoyas' Big East opener against Creighton on Dec. 18. All four reserves who checked in logged at least 14 minutes. ""We purposely wanted to cut our rotation a little bit to get a little bit more chemistry and synergy, and I thought our young guys did a really good job,"" Cooley said. Saturday could bring more opportunities for Georgetown's inexperienced players to get valuable minutes. The Red Flash (2-4) have dropped four of their five road games this season, including a 66-58 setback to Mount St. Mary's last Saturday. Each of St. Francis' other three road losses have come by at least 26 points. ""We are good about digging ourselves into holes, especially on the road,"" Red Flash coach Rob Kimmel said. ""I told the guys to leave the shovels behind as we prepare for Georgetown.""  St. Francis put the shovels to good use during Wednesday's home opener, burying Division III Penn State-Schuylkill 96-57 to snap a two-game skid. Jeremy Clayville hit 6 of 10 3-pointers off the bench and had a team-leading 21 points, while fellow reserves Miles Webb and Chris Moncrief scored 17 points apiece. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.44,0.56

ESPN plans to tape the live-audience studio show, ""They Call It Late Night with Jason Kelce,"" on Fridays starting Jan. 3 through the end of the NFL playoffs -- a five-week stretch that would serve as a test run for the retired All-Pro center and big brother to Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.  The first four episodes will air at 1 a.m. ET starting Jan. 4 and re-air on ESPN2 and Kelce's YouTube channels. ""I loved late-night shows, I've always loved them. I remember sleepovers watching Conan O'Brien with my friends.

Jason Kelce, 37, joined ""Monday Night Countdown"" on ESPN at the start of this season. The show will be recorded in Philadelphia at Union Transfer with live music. NFL Films' first full-length film, ""They Call It Pro Football,"" had deep Philly roots. Philadelphia TV personality John Facenda became the voice of NFL Films and narrated that film, from which the title of Jason Kelce's new show was created.

The Bearcats are 4-0 -- the third time they've done that in coach Wes Miller's four seasons at the helm -- and are coming off a 76-60 win over Northern Kentucky on Tuesday. Still, Cincinnati has played only one road game and has not faced an opponent with the Atlantic Coast Conference pedigree of Georgia Tech. But the Yellow Jackets (2-2) have had their own issues, particularly on defense, and were beaten by rival Georgia 77-69 on Nov. 15 in their most recent game. Cincinnati passed its first road test on Tuesday, and Miller liked what he saw. ""That was good for us,"" he said. ""I thought we got better and there were a lot of things we can learn from."" The Bearcats got 18 points from Simas Lukosius against Northern Kentucky; he was 6-for-9 on 3-pointers and hit all five attempts in the second half. Lukosius leads the team with an average of 17.8 points and has made 69.6 percent of his 3-pointers, good for fourth in the NCAA. ""People have asked how he's been playing and if I'm surprised,"" Miller said. ""I don't put stock in a game or two, but I see him every day, and I'm not surprised because he continues to work on his game and gets better every day."" The Bearcats are without Dan Skillings Jr., who had minor knee surgery Nov. 11 and could return to practice next week. He had 17 points and 11 rebounds in the opener, but his knee was swollen the next day and surgery was performed. The Bearcats' other top players are Jizzle James (averaging 14 points per game), Dillon Mitchell (12 points, team-leading 8 rebounds) and Arrinten Page (10.3 points). Day Day Thomas played 14 minutes in his season debut Tuesday and contributed four assists and two points. Thomas broke his foot during the NIT in the spring and had not played since. ""Having Day Day back was such a lift for our team,"" Miller said. ""I thought he was really good at times defensively. He puts so much more pressure on the point with his ability to drive."" Georgia Tech is coming off a loss to Georgia in which it set season lows for points (69), field-goal percentage (36.5), 3-point field goals (six) and assists (11), but a high for fouls committed (28). The Yellow Jackets have had trouble scoring, making just 37.2 percent from the field over the past two games. Baye Ndongo leads the team in scoring (15.8 ppg) and is tied with Luke O'Brien for the lead in rebounding (8.0). Ndongo has scored in double digits every game. Lance Terry averages 14 ppg. Doryan Onwuchekwa has started the past two games and totaled 20 rebounds, including 11 against Georgia. ""A lot of times I think we're our own worst enemy,"" Georgia Tech coach Damon Stoudamire said. ""I just don't like our mental makeup. That's probably the toughest thing about losing, to me. We'll work on it and we'll get better."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.34,0.66

For the first time since 2020, the Boilermakers lost a regular season, non-conference game when they fell to No. 15 Marquette 76-58 on Tuesday in Milwaukee. But the early-season setback is all part of the learning curve that Purdue coach Matt Painter wants the Boilermakers (4-1) to go through before Big Ten play begins.  ""Our first three games, we weren't lights out,"" Painter said. ""(Then) we played really well against Alabama. We weren't great before that. So we're trying to find ourselves, trying to find some consistency. But this is what you want. Because we get thrown into (Big Ten play) at Penn State and Maryland in December. You want to be able to get off to a good start in the league; that's a little easier said than done. I just believe if you've got a good enough team, you need to go out and get challenged, even if you've got to take a couple on the chin.  ""That way, when you get into the NCAA Tournament, you've done everything in your power as a coach to help."" Trey Kaufman-Renn leads the Boilermakers in scoring and rebounding with averages of 17.6 and 6.6, respectively. Fletcher Loyer is averaging a second-best 16.2 points per game, and Braden Smith is next at 14.6. Purdue has shot 50.6 percent from the field and 43.8 percent from 3-point range. The Boilermakers had 15 turnovers at Marquette while the Golden Eagles had just six.  ""We need to start by taking care of the basketball,"" Painter said. ""One of the things that probably jumps out for us is I don't think we're as good as Marquette defensively. So, in practice, we don't see that. Doesn't mean we don't have athletic players, doesn't mean we don't have good players. But they have a more experienced defensive group. So we've got to grow at taking care of the basketball."" A well-rested Marshall (3-1) most recently played last Saturday, knocking off Bellarmine 83-62. Nate Martin led the Thundering Herd with 23 points and nine rebounds. Jalen Speer came off the bench to tally 20 points, and Obinna Anochili-Killen added 15 points and nine rebounds.   Marshall used an 11-player rotation. Thundering Herd coach Cornelius Jackson said team depth is a strength Marshall will draw on throughout the season.  ""I feel like we are a deep team,"" he said. ""Each one of our guys can step in and play a role."" As leader of a mid-major team from the Sun Belt Conference, Jackson said he reminded his players there likely will be more fans than they are accustomed to in Mackey Arena on Saturday and therefore it will be louder, but it's still just a basketball game.  ""The rims are the same size, the court is the same size,"" Jackson said. ""The seats might be a little different, but at the end of the day, it's still basketball. Every guy on our team has played for a long time."" -- Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.34,0.66

Marquette will make the journey for just the one game, while Georgia will take on No. 22 St. John's at the Atlantis Paradise Island Resort on Sunday. The Golden Eagles (5-0) are coming off their first marquee win of the season, 76-58 at home over No. 6 Purdue on Tuesday. After the Boilermakers tied the game at 12 with 12:31 left in the first half, Stevie Mitchell's layup gave Marquette a lead it never surrendered. Mitchell scored a career-high 21 points, while Kam Jones became just the third Golden Eagle to ever record a triple-double, chipping in 17 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists, as Marquette snapped Purdue's 39-game regular-season, non-conference winning streak -- the fourth-longest in NCAA history. A rarity in this era of college sports, Jones and Mitchell are two seniors who have stuck with the program for four years. The duo will look to help Marquette to its first 6-0 start since 2011-12, when it began the year 10-0. ""(Jones) has worked his tail off,"" Marquette coach Shaka Smart said. ""He's always had better ability as a playmaker than some might think, but his role was a little different when we had Tyler Kolek and Oso Ighodaro, because those guys were such good passers. We still need him to score, but he also has the ball in his hands more, and we need him to create opportunities for other guys."" As for Mitchell, Smart said he helps to make the team run. ""I don't think until Stevie graduates and moves on will we fully feel what we have in him,"" the coach said. ""I just encourage everyone to enjoy this year while we have him here. He's a combination of will, toughness, heart, and he's extremely smart."" Jones leads the team with averages 22.6 points and 6 assists per game, while Mitchell chips in 13.6 points per contest. Standing in the way of Marquette's potential 6-0 start is a Georgia team that's seen little resistance to begin the year. The Bulldogs (5-0) have won their first five games by an average score of 87 to 66.6, most recently blowing out Alabama A&M at home Tuesday, 93-45. Led in scoring by Asa Newell (16.8 points per game) and sophomore guard Silas Demary Jr. (14.6), the Bulldogs are off to their best start since beginning 7-0 in 2020-21. Georgia's hot streak will be tested in the Bahamas, as coach Mike White's team will see its first big challenge on Saturday. ""Marquette will demand our attention and respect. It's a great program,"" White said. ""Shaka has done a phenomenal job up there, and from what I've heard on the outside looking in, they've got a good culture and really good players. It'll be a high-level game and a good opportunity to see where we're at."" The two programs have met three times, most recently a 73-66 Georgia win in Milwaukee on Dec. 2, 2017. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.27,0.73

That isn’t good news for the Steelers, whose stingy defense let them down during an embarrassing 24-19 loss to the Browns on Thursday night. Cleveland had dropped seven of its previous eight games ahead of the meeting with Pittsburgh. Opponents averaged only 16.2 points over the Steelers’ first 10 games of the season before the Browns stuck Pittsburgh (8-3) with its third loss. Bad games happen, and one usually isn’t a cause for concern as long as it gets flushed out of the system relatively quickly. But what Thursday showed was just how reliant the Steelers have been on their defense, and once it cracks, the team as a whole does, too. Pittsburgh has really only gone blow-for-blow with an opposing team twice this season, posting a 1-1 record in those contests. The Steelers fell 20-17 in a back-and-forth affair with the Dallas Cowboys back on Oct. 6, then proved that they do in fact have what it takes to prevail in a shootout by edging the Washington Commanders 28-27 on Nov. 10. Outside of that, Pittsburgh has surrendered more than 20 points in just two games, with one of those instances being Thursday’s setback against Cleveland. And listen, having such a talented defense is great for the Steelers. That unit should be continuously praised for where it has this team at this point in the season. However, putting up points in bunches is still sometimes required, and do we really trust that this offense can do that when it matters most? Pittsburgh, the No. 3 seed in the AFC, would go up against the sixth-seeded Baltimore Ravens if the playoffs started today. I don’t know about you, but there is absolutely zero chance I’m taking a 35-year-old Russell Wilson, Najee Harris and George Pickens over Lamar Jackson, Derrick Henry and Zay Flowers if that game was to turn into an offensive showdown. Suppose the Steelers’ defense does hold down the fort, though. Then Pittsburgh is presumably off to Buffalo to face the Bills, who average the third-most points per game in the NFL (29.1).  Baltimore ranks second on that list, by the way (30.4 points per game). The Steelers are way down in 16th (22.9). Pittsburgh did do a fantastic job of containing the Ravens on Sunday, eking out an 18-16 victory. No offensive fireworks, no problems for the Steelers. If Pittsburgh does want to put together a deep run this postseason, its defense is going to have to be nearly perfect. We can’t expect Wilson to outplay some of the league’s best quarterbacks and offenses if he couldn’t even step on Cleveland’s throat after Browns signal-caller Jameis Winston threw an interception with 4:22 left in regulation on Thursday.  Up 19-18, the Steelers had a chance to put the game away right then and there, but they went three-and-out, setting the stage for a 2-yard rushing touchdown by Nick Chubb that provided Cleveland with the go-ahead points. Pittsburgh might not be the powerhouse its 8-3 record tells us it is. We’re not ready to fully deem the Steelers pretenders just yet, but they certainly could be flirting with that title soon depending on how they fare in four divisional games over the next six weeks.

Iconic venues in the Northeast or Midwest typically host these games, though. Around the holidays, it might be a tropical locale where mai tais are many. Friday’s clash between No. 12 Duke and No. 17 Arizona is unique because it will be held on campus, at the Wildcats’ McKale Center in Tucson, Ariz. “We’re still committed to really high-quality home and homes, and that won’t ever change,” Arizona president of basketball operations Matt King said. “We don’t want our season ticket holders to ever believe... that we’re not going to try to make sure there are some big-time games.” If you were around the last time Arizona hosted Duke, in February 1991, you’re old enough to place a bet (and drink a mai tai) tonight. Let’s look at the Blue Devils-Wildcats as well as action in the NHL and college football. After losing consecutive games for the first time this season, NHL points leader Winnipeg salvaged a home-and-home with the Florida Panthers on Tuesday, cruising to a 6-3 win north of the border. That game was a respite in a stretch in which the Jets play nine of 10 on the road, where they are 7-2-0 to start the season. Behind co-points leaders Mark Scheifele and Kyle Connor (24 apiece), the Jets’ attack is dynamic, home or away. Winnipeg leads the league with 80 goals and takes on a Penguins club that has yielded an NHL-worst 81 goals while struggling to maintain leads. Winnipeg won the first meeting between the clubs 6-3 in late October. The Jets are likely to start backup goalie Eric Comrie as two division games loom after this one, so expect something similar this time around. A goal from the Pens’ Sidney Crosby would add intrigue as the 600th of his superstar career.

UNLV hasn’t accomplished the feat since 1984, but at 8-4 entering this Mountain West matchup, the program is closing in. Still alive for a crack at a rematch with No. 12 Boise State in the conference championship game, the Rebels must keep winning and get outside help in the form of a Colorado State loss in either of the next two weeks. Taking care of business against the Spartans won’t be easy. San Jose State quarterback Walker Eget has passed for 841 yards in the past two games, including 446 in last week’s 42-21 loss to Boise State, connecting often with the nation’s leading receiver, Nick Nash. The rapport between Rebels quarterback Hajj-Malik Williams and wideout Ricky White III is solid, too. Williams is a dual-threat as well, rushing for eight touchdowns to go with his 14 passing TDs.

It was April 1986, to be exact. The shot these days is a staple for many offenses and frequently influences outcomes if teams aren’t careful—or versatile. Duke went just 4-for-24 from deep in a Nov. 12, neutral-court loss to then-No. 19 Kentucky but lost only by five. So, while the Blue Devils may live by the three, they don’t have to perish by it. Their spirits and percentage surged in a Nov. 16 rout of visiting Wofford. Sparked by separate 4-for-7 efforts from Tyrese Proctor and Isaiah Evans, Duke was 16 for-38 from long range and won 86-35. Arizona struggles to defend the 3, which figures to be its undoing Friday. The Wildcats have been idle since Nov. 15 at Wisconsin (jump around for another on-campus showdown!), when they allowed the Badgers to connect on 12-of-27 treys while hitting a mere 4-of-23.

The teams will have to work hard to produce the kind of excitement they did in this event's opening round on Thursday, in which Baylor won in double overtime over No. 22 St. John's and the Volunteers dismantled previously undefeated Virginia with a dominant second half.  The Bears (4-1) won in stunning fashion when Jeremy Roach hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer as part of his 20 points. Baylor stumbled through the second overtime, missing five free throws and neglecting to properly defend the 3-point line as St. John's built a lead.   But the Red Storm left the door open just a crack, and Roach barreled through it with his decisive shot, giving Baylor its fourth straight victory after an embarrassing season-opening loss to Gonzaga.   V.J. Edgecombe's 3-pointer with 6.5 seconds left Thursday brought Baylor to within two points and, after a timeout and a foul, Zuby Ejiofor of St. John's missed both free throws with 4.1 seconds to play. Norchad Omier grabbed the rebound and fed Roach for his winning shot.  ""Jeremy Roach -- a big-time play,"" Baylor coach Scott Drew said after the win. ""He makes big plays. I loved seeing him make that shot and the team celebrate. We showed a lot of heart.""  Omier led Baylor with 24 points and 10 rebounds, with Robert Wright scoring 17 points, Jalen Celestine adding 14, Jayden Nunn tallying 12 and Edgecombe contributing 10.  ""My teammates had my back,"" Roach said. ""They had my confidence in me, and I just wanted to make a play. We've just been in too many battles together, so we had to come back for that one. We all came together. We never back down.""  The Volunteers (5-0) beat Virginia 64-42 behind 26 points from Chaz Lanier, 14 from Igor Milicic Jr., and a determined defensive effort. Eighteen of Lanier's points came after halftime.  ""My teammates were finding me. Shout-out to them,"" Lanier said. ""We had a great plan defensively and really focused on that in the second half.""  Tennessee led just 22-21 at the break and was up 39-34 with 10:48 remaining. It then reeled off a 25-8 run to end the game; Virginia hit just one field goal over the final 7:44.   The Volunteers doubled the output of Virginia in the second half, outscoring the Cavaliers 42-21. Tennessee held Virginia to 28 percent shooting and forced nine turnovers that they turned into 18 points.  Tennessee also had 19 points off 18 offensive rebounds combined in both halves.  Tennessee is playing this tournament without J.P. Estrella (left foot injury) and Cameron Carr (left thumb injury), with Estrella's lack of physical improvement a spot of concern for coach Rick Barnes and the team.  ""It is concerning,"" Barnes said about Estrella. ""We know he wants to play. We know he has done everything he can do. I think the plan we had for him to start was the right plan. ... It is day-to-day, and it is the same injury that he has dealt with."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.29,0.71

Texas rides a four-game winning streak into the final, while Saint Joseph's has been victorious in three straight contests. Their meeting will be their first since the Longhorns recorded a 68-50 victory on Nov. 24, 2008.   Saint Joseph's (4-1) overcame squandering a 16-point lead in Thursday's 78-77 victory over Texas Tech in the semifinals. Justice Ajogbor made the second of his two free throws with 13 seconds remaining to snap a tie and cap the scoring. Anthony Finkley successfully contested Darrion Williams' floater at the buzzer to preserve the win for the Hawks. ""We come in here (to Barclays Center), an amazing NBA venue in Brooklyn, and I'm like, God is good,"" Saint Joseph's coach Billy Lange said. ""Just to get these opportunities, regardless of the result ... is the thing I'm grateful for the most right now.""  Erik Reynolds II scored 26 points and went 6 of 11 from 3-point range, while Xzayvier Brown finished with 20 points following a 13-for-13 effort from the free-throw line. Brown is averaging 17.4 points and Reynolds 16.8 over the first five games of the season. Texas (4-1) advanced to Friday's championship game with a 70-66 win over Syracuse on Thursday, holding on after giving up an 11-point halftime lead. Arthur Kaluma posted 16 points, 10 rebounds and four assists to pace the Longhorns before fouling out.  ""I take more of a facilitator role when I work the middle,"" Kaluma said of his production against a zone defense. ""When I get the ball in the middle, I'm able to spray the ball to my teammates to get easier shots. But when they go man (defense), it's still that facilitation mindset even when I have more opportunities to score.""  Tre Johnson, who came in averaging 23.5 points per game, added 16 points on Thursday. Johnson went just 1 of 7 from 3-point range in what was his lowest-scoring output of Texas' first five games.  The Longhorns struggled from deep vs. Syracuse, making just 4 of 15 shots. But Texas benefited from holding the Orange to 5-of-21 shooting from long distance, and Syracuse was a dismal 9 of 18 at the free-throw line.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.28,0.72

In Thursday's semifinal round of the Legends Classic, both teams forged late rallies that came up a few points short, leading to their first losses of the season. Now the Orange (3-1) will face the Red Raiders (4-1) in the tournament's consolation game on Friday night in New York.  Syracuse fell in a 14-3 hole early and was down 16 early in the second half before Eddie Lampkin started the comeback with a personal 7-0 run featuring a 3-point play and a dunk. Lampkin scored 12 of his 14 points in the second half.  The Orange took a pair of one-point leads as time wound down, but they made only one field goal in the final 3:17 as Texas secured a 70-66 win at the free-throw line.  ""There's no consolation prizes,"" said Syracuse coach Adrian Autry, who bemoaned three late turnovers as well as missed rebounds. ""We had a chance to win the game, and we didn't. That's on us, that's on me.""  Lampkin added six assists and five rebounds to continue a stellar start to his Syracuse career. The former TCU and Colorado center is averaging 14.8 points, 8.3 rebounds and 4.8 assists through four games.  JJ Starling, one game removed from a 38-point performance in a double-overtime win over Youngstown State, led the Orange against Texas with 16 points. Like Syracuse in its game, Texas Tech was behind by as many as 16 points in the latter semifinal game against Saint Joseph's. The trio of JT Toppin, Darrion Williams and Chance McMillian scored 34 of the Red Raiders' 42 second-half points to fuel a comeback. McMillian's bucket and foul gave Texas Tech a 64-62 advantage at the 6:44 mark -- its first lead since 2-0. But the defense was lacking as Saint Joseph's made four shots in a row with less than four minutes left. After Toppin tied the game with 1:07 to go, he was called for an over-the-back foul on a rebound attempt, and Justice Ajogbor made 1 of 2 free throws to deliver the Hawks a 78-77 win. Toppin had 22 points and a remarkable 18 rebounds -- 12 on offense. His season averages rose to 20.8 points and 11.2 rebounds through five games. Before the Red Raiders hit the big city, Texas Tech coach Grant McCasland said there were ways Toppin could be even better. ""I think the area of improvement needs to be, how active can we continue to get him defensively where he's not just surviving a possession?"" McCasland said. ""Because he's going to play against great players in our league, but now he's been tremendous. I'll tell you what I love about JT: He really does want to know how to get better."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.35,0.65

Instead, Pitino and his squad have a short amount of time to overcome a potentially demoralizing loss. The No. 22 Red Storm will look to produce a quick bounce-back effort Friday night when they play Virginia in the third-place game of the Baha Mar Hoops Championship in Nassau, Bahamas.   Both teams lost in opening-round action Thursday night. St. John's suffered its first loss of the season when Jeremy Roach hit a 3-pointer as time expired in the second overtime to lift No. 13 Baylor to a 99-98 win. Virginia also fell for the first time in the nightcap, when No. 11 Tennessee pulled away from the Cavaliers in the second half for a 64-42 victory. St. John's (4-1) appeared primed to pull off the upset when it scored the first seven points of the game and took a pair of 18-point leads in the first half before entering the locker room with a 44-30 lead. Baylor shot 47.1 percent (16 of 34) from the field in the second half, including 57.1 percent (8 of 14) from 3-point territory and went ahead 77-74 on Roach's 3-pointer with 1:48 left. St. John's scored the final three points of regulation and then overcame a five-point deficit in the final 1:47 of the first overtime before opening two five-point leads in the second extra session, the last at 98-93 when Deivon Smith split a pair of free throws with 18 seconds remaining. V.J. Edgecombe responded with a 3-pointer for Baylor and St. John's left the door open one more time when Zuby Ejiofor missed a pair of free throws with 4.1 seconds remaining. Norchad Omier pulled down the rebound and passed to Roach, who raced down the court and hoisted the game-winning shot just before the buzzer sounded. ""That was about as difficult a loss as you can have,"" Pitino said. Ejiofor's missed free throws served as a harsh reminder of the narrow margin between victory and defeat. St. John's shot 57.1 percent (16 of 28) from the line, matching the program's worst single-game mark since Pitino took over prior to last season. ""They're going to be disappointed -- they had the game in control at the end and (Roach) made a big shot,"" Pitino said. ""We missed the free throws, could've iced it. It could've been over, but it wasn't."" There were no such remorseful what-ifs for Virginia (3-1), which trailed only 22-21 at the half after Andrew Rohde hit a 3-pointer with five seconds left. The Cavaliers opened the second half 1 for 6 with four turnovers during the first seven minutes, a span in which Tennessee mounted a 15-3 run. Virginia got within five points at 39-34 on Taine Murray's 3-pointer with 10:48 left, but the Volunteers ended the game with a 25-8 surge.  Virginia, which has yet to score more than 70 points in a game this season, shot 28.6 percent from the field (14 of 49) and allowed Tennessee to pull down 18 offensive rebounds and score 19 second-chance points. ""When you play against high level competition, it really shows you where you are as a team,"" interim head coach Ron Sanchez said. ""We've got to put 40 minutes together. Twenty's just not enough."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.33,0.67

In its fifth game, the trait also appeared on the offensive side. After opening the Charleston Classic in South Carolina with a thrilling overtime victory over Virginia Commonwealth, the Pirates (3-2) will face a quick turnaround when they meet Vanderbilt (5-0) on Friday. The Pirates will play their first opponent from a power conference after rallying from an eight-point deficit in the second half to earn a 69-66 win on Thursday. Held under 60 points in their first four games against mid-majors in the New York/New Jersey area, Seton Hall produced its best offensive showing of the season on Thursday. Leading scorer Chaunce Jenkins scored all of his season-best 22 points after halftime. Jenkins was 6 of 10 from the field in the final 25 minutes after taking just two shots due to foul trouble in the first half. He made the go-ahead basket with 2:21 remaining in overtime off an inbounds play. ""The guys fought, man,"" Seton Hall coach Shaheen Holloway said after his team earned a potential Quad 1 win by beating the Atlantic 10 preseason favorite. ""Super proud of these guys. They clawed, they scratched, they made plays when we had to make plays."" Isaiah Coleman added 12 points and 10 rebounds for the Pirates, who shot 41.8 percent from the floor. David Tubek hit all three of his 3-point tries, and Seton Hall went 7 of 12 from deep and is 15 of 30 from behind the arc in its past two games. Like VCU, Vanderbilt represents another potent offense to challenge Seton Hall's stingy defense. The Commodores averaged 91.5 points in four double-digit victories before posting a 73-71 win over Nevada on Thursday. After facing a team projected to finish third in the Mountain West Conference, Vanderbilt is seeking its first 6-0 start since beginning the 2007-08 season with 16 straight wins. ""We got a perfect record, but we're not perfect,"" Vanderbilt coach Mark Byington said this week. ""We got a lot of things to work on. Our guys know it, and I know it."" Similar to Seton Hall, the Commodores made plays down the stretch after squandering virtually all of a 12-point lead in the second half. AJ Hoggard scored 18 points for Vanderbilt, which overcame 53.7 percent shooting from the floor by Nevada. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.34,0.66

On Thursday afternoon in the first round at Charleston, S.C., Miami (3-1) never led while falling 80-69 to Drake. Later on Thursday, the Cowboys (3-1) squandered a 10-point lead in an 86-78 loss to Florida Atlantic. The Friday matchup will be special for Cowboys backup point guard Arturo Dean, who is from Miami. Dean played for Florida International the past two seasons, and he led the nation in steals in 2023-24 with 104. He also led the Panthers in scoring (13.4 points per game), rebounds (5.1 boards per game) and assists (4.0 per game). ""He takes tremendous pride on defense,"" Oklahoma State coach Steve Lutz said. ""You don't get 100-plus steals by accident."" Hurricanes coach Jim Larranaga believes that the Cowboys will test Miami. ""They've got some really big guys,"" he said. ""We haven't played that type of size yet (this season)."" Up front, Oklahoma State starts 6-foot-10, 245-pound Abou Ousmane and 6-7, 230-pound Robert Jennings II. Jennings amassed 14 points and 11 rebounds against Florida Atlantic, while Khalil Brantley scored a team-high 16 points. This is supposed to be a rebuilding season for the Cowboys, who were predicted to come in 14th out of 16 teams in the Big 12 based on a preseason vote of the conference's head coaches. The Cowboys have earned just one NCAA Tournament berth in the past seven years. Lutz, after coaching Western Kentucky last season, is in his first year with the Cowboys, who lost four starters from 2023-24. Miami, meanwhile, has a lot to prove after a Thursday game in which Drake logged a 14-5 edge in the offensive rebounds. The Bulldogs also posted a 36-18 advantage in paint points. Miami's defense had trouble with Drake's voluminous screens. Two Miami starters -- center Lynn Kidd and power forward Brandon Johnson -- will be looking for bounce-back games on offense. Kidd had just two points against Drake, while Johnson had seven. Nijel Pack topped the Hurricanes with 17 points, raising his team-leading scoring average to 15.3 per game.

The preseason all-Big Ten Conference selection leads Washington in scoring (14.8 points per game), rebounding (13 boards per game) and steals (four per game) heading into the Huskies' game against Alcorn State on Friday in Seattle. The rest of the Huskies? Not so much. Washington (3-1) ranks last in the conference in field-goal percentage (.402), free-throw percentage (.578) and assists per game (11.3). The Huskies are 17th -- in an 18-team conference -- in scoring (70.8 ppg). First-year Washington coach Danny Sprinkle vowed to shake things up. ""Our starting lineup is going to change and it might change from half to half,"" Sprinkle said. ""It might change every game depending on who is playing with energy and giving the team something. But you have to produce if you're going to be in the game."" The Huskies outlasted UMass Lowell 74-69 on Sunday as Osobor scored 23 points and grabbed a career-high 18 rebounds. Tyree Ihenacho, Tyler Harris and Zoom Diallo each scored 12 for the Huskies, and Luis Kortright added 10. Harris, Diallo and Kortright all came off the bench. ""Minutes are going to start being distributed by production,"" Sprinkle said. ""That's the only way to separate. ... Offensively, you better be making the right basketball play. When it's your turn to knock down a shot, you better knock down a shot. When it's your turn to make a layup, you better make a layup. And that's the best way to stay on the court. ""If you're not doing those things, I got to keep that revolving door until I find some continuity to where somebody who is playing hard takes hold of that spot."" Washington has been an offensive powerhouse compared with the Braves, who have been outscored by an average of 31.6 points in their five games.

The Bruins (4-1) moved to 4-0 at home and 3-0 in their homestand on Wednesday with an 84-70 win over Idaho State. UCLA jumped ahead of the Bengals early, leading by 17 points in the first half before settling for a 14-point edge at the break. The margin topped out at 28 points. Sebastian Mack continued a run of strong performances coming off the UCLA bench, scoring a season-high 21 points to complement Tyler Bilodeau's 20 points. ""He's really improving in his pace and his decision-making,"" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said of Mack. Cronin pointed to Mack's rise since the Bruins' loss to New Mexico on Nov. 8 when the sophomore guard scored just two points and committed three turnovers in nine minutes. Mack has scored in double digits in all three games since and has given the ball away a total of just three times. ""I've always loved his toughness,"" Cronin added of Mack. ""He's a bright spot for us."" Another Bruins guard, Dylan Andrews, returned to the lineup on Wednesday after a groin injury kept him out of blowout victories against Boston University and Lehigh. Andrews had three points and four assists in 12 minutes off the bench against Idaho State. Cal State Fullerton (1-4) makes the short trip north from Orange County, continuing an early-season nonconference gauntlet. The Titans already lost to three of UCLA's former Pac-12 Conference counterparts, Stanford, Colorado and Oregon State, as well as 2024 NCAA Tournament second-round qualifier Grand Canyon. The Titans picked up their first win on Monday, beating Idaho State 62-61. In the process, Dedrique Taylor became the winningest coach in Cal State Fullerton history with his 156th victory, topping Bob Burton. ""It means a lot in terms of just who our program is and what we've been doing the past 11 years,"" Taylor said, per the Cal State Fullerton athletic website.

The Wildcats open play in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, on Friday night against George Washington. ""We get to be together,"" Tang said Monday when asked about the benefits of the trip. ""The weather is going to be nice. There are not a lot of distractions and we get to do some team-building things while we're there. Growing up in the Virgin Islands, I'll have family there, so it will be really cool. ""But it's business, (especially) for the staff. We get to let the guys experience playing in that environment."" The winner will play Sunday against the winner of the first-round game between Liberty (4-1) and Louisiana (1-3), while the losers will play on Saturday. Kansas State (3-1) is coming off a 74-56 victory over Mississippi Valley State on Tuesday. The Wildcats were cold from 3-point range, hitting just 3 of 23 (13 percent) from beyond the arc. They made up for it by shooting 25-for-27 (92.6 percent) from the free-throw line. That was the second-highest percentage in program history in a game with at least 20 attempts. The Wildcats won an in-season tournament in the Caribbean (the Cayman Islands Classic) two seasons ago, with a semifinal overtime victory over Nevada and a 61-59 victory over LSU in the championship game. Tang has credited that tournament with building a bond that resulted in a run to the Elite Eight that season. The Revolutionaries (4-0) have gotten off to a good start thanks to their defense, which has recorded at least nine steals in each of their games. They are second in the Atlantic 10 with an average of 10 steals per game. George Washington is led by Darren Buchanan Jr., who is scoring 17.3 points and nine rebounds per game, but they have five other players averaging between 13.5 and 9.3 points per game. Buchanan led the Revolutionaries with 20 points in their 84-64 victory over NJIT on Monday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.41,0.59

He was a really good player there, and he's a really good player here."" Martinez is averaging just 26 minutes per game, but he is pacing the Aggies in scoring (22.8 ppg) and assists (3.8 ppg) while shooting 56 percent on 3-point attempts and 93.9 percent at the free-throw line. He scored a career-high 32 points in a 95-83 home win over Montana on Monday. His counterpart on Iowa is Payton Sandfort, who is leading the Hawkeyes in scoring (17.8 ppg) while ranking second in rebounds (7.0) and assists (4.2).

Collins said he was happy to have Barnhizer 100 percent healthy again, as he and Martinelli reached an early-season landmark: scoring at least 20 points in the same game. ""(Having Barnhizer back) means a lot,"" Collins said. ""He's one of the best players in the country. ... He's such a fierce competitor.

The Fighting Irish survived losing the offensive rebounding margin by seven because they shot effectively and limited the Fighting Hawks to 34.4 percent shooting from the field. It was the fourth time Notre Dame hit at least 50 percent and third time it held an opponent under 40 percent. Markus Burton paced Notre Dame with 29 points and nine rebounds.

The Falcons were within two points before Lee Dort hit a jumper, was fouled and sank the ensuing free throw with 11:25 remaining. Jeremiah Wilkinson followed up with a 3-pointer and a free throw 37 seconds later to expand the lead to 56-47. Wilkinson, a rare freshman contributor on Cal's transfer-dominated roster, finished with a game-high-tying 23 points and Andrej Stojakovic had 21, helping the Golden Bears (4-1) win a second straight game.

Nearly 12 years later, the two Harbaughs will be back on the same field as NFL head coaches when the Baltimore Ravens visit the Los Angeles Chargers on Monday night. Both teams are in the playoff mix with Baltimore holding a 7-4 record and the Chargers sitting at 7-3. John Harbaugh has won both NFL matchups against his brother, including the Ravens' 34-31 win over Jim's San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl following the 2012 regular season. The other meeting was on Thanksgiving Day in 2011 when host Baltimore won a 16-6 decision. Now, the hype train is on overload as the siblings prepare to face one another again. ""It's a tough matchup,"" 62-year-old John Harbaugh said of the contest on Wednesday. ""Winning football team. Extremely well-coached football team, no doubt about it. One of the best coaches of our generation. Even if he wasn't my brother, I'd say that."" Jim Harbaugh, 60, is back in the NFL after coaching Michigan for nine seasons and winning last season's national championship. He previously spent four seasons leading the 49ers. Being part of the college ranks made the wait longer for Jim to face John, who is in his 17th season as coach of the Ravens. Those memories of being on the wrong side of the Super Bowl outcome took a while to dissipate. ""At the time, that was tough,"" Jim Harbaugh said Wednesday. ""After some time and reflection went by, it's my brother, it's my best friend. Really proud of him. Really happy for his success. It was earned."" Ravens star safety Kyle Hamilton said being part of the brotherly rivalry is a unique deal. ""From his perspective, he's done a good job managing emotions,"" Hamilton said of John Harbaugh. ""We still have a game to play, but I think everybody understands it's kind of historic and it's cool to be part of history."" Both coaches made remarks suggesting they didn't want their brotherly battle to overshadow the pivotal AFC contest. The Ravens are in second place in the AFC North, one game behind the Pittsburgh Steelers. Baltimore is 4-4 against AFC foes. The Chargers are two games behind the first-place Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC West. Los Angeles is a solid 5-2 against fellow AFC teams. Baltimore lost 18-16 to the host Steelers last week after winning seven of its previous eight games. The Chargers have won four straight games after notching a 34-27 victory over the visiting Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday. Both teams employ quarterbacks having solid campaigns. Two-time NFL MVP Lamar Jackson of Baltimore ranks second in the NFL in passing yardage (2,876) and touchdown passes (25). He has been intercepted just three times and has rushed for 584 yards and two scores. Justin Herbert of the Chargers has been intercepted just once. He has thrown for 2,186 yards and 13 touchdowns. ""His talent, the effort that he puts in. Everything that you can say good about a quarterback and then some,"" Jim Harbaugh said regarding what he likes about Herbert. ""Talent and effort, and then intangibles that are off the charts. Any measurable you can have for a quarterback, tangible or intangible, he possesses at the elite, highest level."" Ravens star middle linebacker Roquan Smith (hamstring) missed practice on Thursday. The NFL co-leader in tackles (110) was hurt against the Steelers. Also sitting out practice for Baltimore were receiver Nelson Agholor (illness), cornerback Arthur Maulet (calf), safety Sanoussi Kane (ankle) and defensive lineman Travis Jones (ankle). Chargers rookie receiver Ladd McConkey (shoulder) sat out practice Thursday. He was injured against the Bengals. Middle linebacker Denzel Perryman (groin), cornerback Cam Hart (concussion/ankle) and safety AJ Finley (ankle) also sat out practice. The Ravens have won the teams' past four regular-season meetings, but the host Chargers recorded a 23-17 wild-card victory over Baltimore following the 2018 regular season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.32,0.68

It was the third time in Chicago's last four games that the Blackhawks had recorded 20 or fewer shots on net. Florida goaltender Spencer Knight stopped 17 of 19 shots. The Blackhawks had been 0-for-6 on power plays in their previous four games, but Teravainen ended the slump 2:46 into the first period. An interference penalty on Niko Mikkola gave Chicago an early chance with the extra attacker, and Teravainen buried a rebound for his fifth goal of the season. Smith also tallied his fifth goal to extend Chicago's lead at 10:07 of the second period. Patrick Maroon's canny pass found Smith alone heading toward the Florida net, and Smith deposited a backhanded shot. Just 34 seconds after Smith's goal, Reinhart answered with a shot from the circle that beat a screened Mrazek. Reinhart has 18 points (10 goals, eight assists) over a 12-game points streak, tied for the fifth-longest streak in Panthers franchise history. Besides the efforts of Mrazek and the Blackhawks' defense, the Panthers' offense had some self-inflicted issues in the form of turnovers and missed passes. The problems peaked with a minute left in regulation, as Carter Verhaeghe made an ill-advised drop pass attempt in his own end that Foligno intercepted for a gift of an empty-net goal. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.19,0.81

The first-year coach of the Cardinals (2-1) guided the Eagles' basketball program for nine years, winning four regular-season Big South titles and three conference tournament championships before leaving for the College of Charleston in 2021.  Current Eagles coach Mark Prosser succeeded Kelsey and previously served as an assistant under Kelsey for six seasons. Prosser is the son of the late Skip Prosser, who coached Kelsey at Xavier and later gave his former player his first college coaching job there. Kelsey has long cited the elder Prosser as a mentor. ""The admiration that my father had for him ... I'd hear about it often,"" Mark Prosser told the Louisville Courier-Journal. Kelton Talford played on Kelsey's last Winthrop team. The senior forward leads the Eagles (4-2) with a 7.2 rebounding average and ranks second in scoring at 15 points per game. He posted season highs of 22 points and 10 rebounds in Winthrop's 77-75 home win Sunday over North Carolina Central. The win was Winthrop's third straight game decided by one or two points. The Eagles are 2-1 in that stretch. Louisville is coming off a 100-68 victory over Bellarmine on Tuesday. Terrence Edwards Jr. and Kasean Pryor led the Cardinals, scoring 26 and 21 points, respectively. The Cardinals hit 54.7 percent (35 for 64) from the field and made 12 of 35 3-point attempts. The 34.3 percent performance from beyond the arc was the best for Kelsey's team this season. Perimeter shooting is a key facet of Kelsey's offense, and the Cardinals rank near the top nationally in 3-point shots, but close to the bottom in 3-point accuracy. That's not a major issue for Kelsey. Aside from taking a few too many difficult shots in the loss against Tennessee, he hasn't had a problem with his players' shot selection. ""We say we want to hunt great, hunt great, hunt great,"" he said after the Bellarmine win. ""That's hunting great shots, and if we generate great and it doesn't go in, I sleep like a baby. You know, it's a make-miss game.""   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.43,0.57

Fresh off their first Final Four appearance in 41 years, the Wolfpack are 4-0, with their most recent victory a 72-49 decision against Colgate on Monday. In NC State's win against a team that has made five consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances, Ben Middlebrooks led the way with 19 points in 16 minutes off the bench, while Marcus Hill added 17 points. Middlebrooks and starting point guard Michael O'Connell are among the few returners from last year's historic squad, while Hill -- who spent last season at Bowling Green -- was one of five transfers and eight overall newcomers to the roster that coach Kevin Keatts is working to mesh into the team. ""It was really good to me to see Marcus get back to his groove and play his game. A lot of times when you transfer here, you are always trying to overthink,"" Keatts said. ""That was the Marcus Hill that we recruited: the guy that can get to the rack, the guy that can get to the free-throw line."" Through four games, senior Jayden Taylor, who started 29 games last season, leads the Wolfpack in scoring at 14.3 points per game. Dontrez Styles, who played at Georgetown and rival North Carolina previously, averages 8.8 points and team-best 6.3 rebounds. William & Mary (3-3) is coming off a 102-87 win over Georgia Southern in Rock Hill, S.C., on Sunday. Six members of the Tribe scored in double figures, and the team knocked down 16 shots (on 44 attempts) from behind the arc. It was the first time William & Mary put up 100 points vs. a Division I opponent since 2018. ""Playing hard is the most important thing. We still have some errors we got to work on,"" first-year Tribe coach Brian Earl said. Senior forward Noah Collier leads the Tribe with averages of 11.5 points and 5.2 rebounds per game, while Kyle Pulliam -- a transfer from Division II St. Thomas Aquinas -- is posting 11.3 points and 3.8 rebounds per game. William & Mary is 16-102 all-time against programs from the Atlantic Coast Conference.

Keldon Johnson added 12 points and Tre Jones and Charles Bassey finished with 11 apiece.   San Antonio played without injured star center Victor Wembanyama (bruised right knee) and guard Devin Vassell (sore left knee) for the third consecutive game.   The Jazz's Lauri Markkanen led all scorers with 27 points. Keyonte George added 19 and Brice Sensabaugh and John Collins scored 18 each for Utah, which has dropped four straight games and went winless on its road trip that concluded Thursday.   The Jazz led 32-17 after the opening quarter. San Antonio began the second quarter with an 11-5 run capped by two free throws by Barnes to pull to within nine points. The Jazz swung back, rebuilding their lead to 13 points after Markkanen's layup with 6:54 to play in the quarter.

Jordan Kyrou and Nathan Walker scored in regulation for the Blues, who won for just the second time in their past eight games (2-5-1). Jake Neighbours provided the lone goal for either team in the shootout. Alexander Wennberg scored twice for the Sharks, who have won just one of their last six games (1-2-3). Mikael Granlund and Macklin Celebrini assisted on both tallies. Yaroslav Askarov made 29 saves in his third NHL start and first for the Sharks. With Askarov pulled for an extra attacker, Wennberg scored from the right faceoff dot with nine seconds left to force overtime. The Blues scored 11 seconds in the game with their fourth forward line. Askarov tried to clear the puck along the boards, but Radek Faska intercepted his pass in the left corner and set up Walker's point-blank goal in front of the net. San Jose tied the game 1-1 at 8:23 of the opening period with a power-play goal. Wennberg snapped a shot into the upper left corner of the net from a tough right-side angle. St. Louis finished the first period with a 15-7 shots advantage. The Blues earned two good scoring chances late in the period, but Askarov stopped Robert Thomas stepping out from behind the net and Kyrou on his shot from the slot. Early in the second period, Klim Kostin broke in on Binnington from the left wing on a two-on-one break and pushed the puck through him. However, the puck trickled wide and the game remained tied.

UNLV (8-2, 4-1 Mountain West) rejoined the College Football Playoff poll on Tuesday and is closing in on its first 10-win season since quarterback Randall Cunningham led the program to its since-vacated 11-2 finish in 1984. The Rebels need Colorado State to lose one of its final two games against Fresno State or Utah State in order to reach their second straight conference title game and, more importantly, set up a rematch with No. 12 Boise State. UNLV fell to the Broncos 44-20 in last year's championship. San Jose State, however, is in a good position to play spoiler themselves. The Spartans (6-4, 3-3) entered last season's game against UNLV as a slight underdog and ended up winning 37-31. San Jose State is coming off last Saturday's home game against Boise State in which it was driving to take a 21-0 lead before the Broncos forced a turnover on downs at the goal line. That kept it a two-possession game, and Boise State quickly woke up from there and ran away with a 42-21 win. ""We were in that game,"" Spartans coach Ken Niumatalolo said. ""I'm encouraged because we're doing a lot of good things. I feel like we stopped ourselves a lot on offense. We looked at a lot of things to improve on."" San Jose State quarterback Walker Eget has led the nation in passing yards in consecutive weeks, eclipsing his career high in both games. His 446 yards through the air against Boise State was the most in a game for a Mountain West quarterback this season. Eget replaced Emmett Brown as the starter in October. The Spartans have the nation's top receiver this season, as redshirt senior Nick Nash leads the country in both receptions (95) and receiving yards (1,282). San Jose State also has the Mountain West's second-leading receiver behind Nash in Justin Lockhart, who has 925 yards on 48 receptions. ""They've got an elite group of receivers,"" UNLV coach Barry Odom said. ""Their quarterback's playing really well. Schematically, they caused some issues on their alignments with space. We've got to do a great job. We talk all the time in our defensive meetings about eliminating explosive plays. They are going to get some, we've got to minimize those."" UNLV is certainly not lacking in the wide receiver department either, as All-American Ricky White III ranks third in the Mountain West with 867 receiving yards and second with 63 receptions. His performance improved mightily following UNLV's first three games of the season, coinciding with their quarterback switch to Hajj-Malik Williams. Williams has impressed in his seven games as the starter as well. He leads the team with 646 rushing yards and eight scores on the ground to go along with 1,436 yards, 14 touchdowns and three interceptions through the air. Mountain West preseason Defensive Player of the Year Jackson Woodard has perhaps been the Rebels' MVP this season. The linebacker's 99 total tackles, four interceptions and 3.5 sacks have him on the watchlist for the Nagurski, Bednarik and Butkus awards. Woodard is also among the national finalists for the Burlsworth award, given to the top player in college football who began their career as a walk-on. Woodard initially played under Odom at Arkansas, Brandon Burlsworth's alma mater. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.28,0.72

Ball's ensuing basket tied it with 25 seconds left, and Beasley missed on a potential go-ahead shot in the final second of regulation. Tre Mann's layup with 3:03 left in overtime gave Charlotte the lead for good at 113-112. Miller followed with his first trey in the extra session at the 1:43 mark.   The Hornets had just about everything going their way in the third quarter as they pulled away from a 63-59 halftime edge. Green made two 3-pointers to spark the surge before Ball went on a personal seven-point scoring spree to make it 84-67.   The lead grew to 89-69 before the Pistons responded with eight straight points. Cunningham had 23 points through three quarters.

Werenski, who scored when the teams combined for six goals in the second and had three assists, sent an open wrister past Lightning netminder Jonas Johansson (36 saves) in the early stages of overtime to help Columbus overcome a 3-0 hole and win for the third time in four games. Sean Monahan had a goal with three assists and Kent Johnson scored twice in his return from missing 14 games due to a shoulder issue for the Blue Jackets.   Nikita Kucherov had three assists for the Lightning, who struggled defensively after allowing three goals combined in winning the previous three games.   On the power play just 1:51 into the game, Kucherov got the rebound from Jake Guentzel's shot and sent the puck for Brayden Point to drill past Columbus' Elvis Merzlikins (24 saves) to open the scoring. A little more than two minutes later, Kucherov sent another rebound that Brandon Hagel buried.  The Lightning made it 3-0 with 8:08 remaining in the first. Victor Hedman's shot was deflected in by ex-Blue Jacket Cam Atkinson, who scored his first of the season.  Columbus finally answered with 6:25 left in the first. Damon Severson's shot went wide of the net but caromed off the friendly end board for Monahan to convert.  Columbus got within 3-2 just 28 seconds into the second via Dmitri Voronkov's breakaway goal. Then Johnson notched a power-play goal from the circle to tie it at 1:55 into the period.   Tampa Bay regained the lead 16 seconds later when Mitchell Chaffee batted in the rebound of Conor Geekie's shot. But, a little more than 1:30 later, Columbus made it 4-4 on Werenski's wrister.

Offensive-minded defenseman Cale Makar skated around the upper edge of the left circle before unleashing a shot that was deflected home by Wood at 3:29 of the third period. The goal was Wood's second of the season. The Thursday loss wasn't the only bad news for the Capitals, who announced prior to the game that superstar captain Alex Ovechkin is expected to miss four to six weeks due to a fracture to his left fibula. The three-time Hart Trophy recipient (MVP) sustained the injury during Washington's 6-2 victory over the Utah Hockey Club on Monday. Colorado's Mikko Rantanen scored on a power play in the second period, his team-leading 13th goal of the season and ninth in his last eight games. Alexandar Georgiev made 30 saves in his return from a two-game absence caused by to an upper-body injury. That proved to be enough for the Avalanche to record their fifth win in six games and avenge a 5-2 setback to the Capitals on Nov. 15 in Denver. Washington's Pierre-Luc Dubois scored a goal in the first period. Logan Thompson turned aside 25 shots to fall to 8-1-1 in his first season with the Capitals. Tom Wilson's hard pass from just above the goal line found the trailing Dubois in front of the net for an easy conversion to open the scoring. The goal with 2:56 remaining in the first period was just Dubois' second of the season. Thompson flashed his glove to thwart Makar from point-blank range to preserve Washington's 1-0 lead midway into the second period. Rantanen's attempted backhand cross-crease pass to Nathan MacKinnon caromed off the skate of Washington defenseman Matt Roy and into the net to forge a 1-1 tie with 5:41 remaining in the second period. Connor McMichael, who scored two goals in the previous meeting against Colorado, was denied in his bid on a breakaway to snap the tie just over two minutes later. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.2,0.8

Jack Eichel, Brett Howden and Pavel Dorofeyev scored goals and Ivan Barbashev had two assists for Vegas, which snapped a two-game losing streak. The Golden Knights improved to 12-1-1 all-time against the Senators with the victory, including 6-0-1 in Ottawa. Cassidy, an Ottawa native, became the eighth active coach in the NHL to hit the 400-win mark. Adam Gaudette and Drake Batherson scored goals and Linus Ullmark finished with 29 saves for Ottawa, which lost its fourth straight game. Vegas, coming off its first shutout loss since Jan. 10, 2024 on Wednesday at Toronto, took a 1-0 lead at the 6:45 mark of the first period on Eichel's sixth goal of the season. Barbashev set up the score with a pass from below the left goal line to a wide-open Eichel, who shoveled it into the net from the low slot. Howden made it 2-0 midway through the second period with a wrist shot off a Barbashev drop pass from the middle of the left circle that squeaked past Ullmark's blocker side for his eighth goal, one off his career high. Samsonov was called for a holding penalty when he grabbed Claude Giroux skating past the net, and Ottawa took advantage at the 7:17 mark of the third period. Gaudette cut it to 2-1 with a power-play goal when he roofed Ridly Greig's no-look backhand pass through the crease, Gaudette's eighth marker of the year. Vegas extended the lead to 3-1 two minutes later when Dorofeyev took a crossing pass from William Karlsson and snapped in a wrist shot past Ullmark's blocker side for his team-leading 10th goal. Batherson then put in a rebound of a Jake Sanderson shot to bring Ottawa within 3-2 with 7:22 remaining. The Senators, who outshot the Golden Knights 18-5 in the final period, pulled Ullmark for an extra attacker with 1:40 to go but managed only one shot on goal by Giroux that Samsonov easily gloved. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.17,0.83

Korpisalo made nine saves in the middle frame and also helped the Bruins withstand a late flurry from the visitors. The Bruins finished 1-for-7 on the power play -- converting for the second consecutive game after going without a goal in the previous six in a row -- and 4-for-4 killing penalties. Boston was on its second three-game losing streak of the season (0-2-1) when Jim Montgomery was fired on Tuesday. Karel Vejmelka stopped 30 shots for Utah, which has lost four of its last five games and was shut out for the fifth time in 19 games. After being held under 20 shots in two of their previous five games, the Bruins poured that total on Vejmelka -- aided by four power plays -- in the first half of the Thursday game. Lindholm broke the game's deadlock and a personal 17-game goal drought on a power play at the 12:41 mark of the second. The first-year Bruin grabbed Brad Marchand's pass that bounced off his skate on the doorstep and buried it for his first tally since Oct. 12. The Bruins killed off a Cole Koepke slashing minor in the final seven minutes of regulation, with a Nick Schmaltz drive being blocked just wide of goal. Shortly after the advantage, Korpisalo padded away a Michael Kesselring shot from the left point. A Pastrnak empty-net goal was taken off the board due to a high-sticking call with 1:01 left. In the first period, Vejmelka made several strong saves to maintain the scoreless game as Boston racked up a 15-5 edge in shots.

Sorokin made a nifty pad save against Alex DeBrincat midway through the period. The Islanders came into the game ranked 31st on the penalty kill but the Red Wings came up empty twice more in the second period. Alexander Romanov, playing in his 300th career game, was whistled for a delay of game infraction and Pierre Engvall committed a slashing penalty. During Detroit's third power play of the contest, its second-ranked power-play unit had trouble just keeping the puck in New York's zone. The Islanders had their first power-play opportunity early in the third when Christian Fischer was penalized for tripping. They were unable to produce a quality chance during that span. Detroit finally broke through with 4:46 remaining as Berggren skated into the Islanders' zone on a 2-on-1 situation and fired the puck past Sorokin. Berggren's goal beat Sorokin on the stick side and was his third of the season. J.T. Compher picked up an assist. Detroit won the first game of the season series last month, 1-0, on a Patrick Kane goal.

The Clippers and Kings both are 0-1 in West Group A play. Long removed from a dreadful 0-4 start in their $2 billion building that James Harden suspected might be ""cursed,"" the Clippers now have their home in order and old scourges vexed. The most recent guest to depart in defeat was the Orlando Magic, as Los Angeles earned a 104-93 victory on Wednesday without leading scorer Norman Powell, who was down with hamstring discomfort and will also miss Friday's game. Without Powell's 23.3 points per game, the Clippers still were able to end the Magic's six-game winning streak and become the first team to score more than 100 points against Orlando in two weeks. ""Norm has meant a lot to us; he's been playing outstanding for us,"" said the Clippers' Amir Coffey, who stepped up with 18 points, his second-highest total of the season. ""Since the start of the season I feel like he's stepped into a big role and he's been great. Just had to make some adjustments without him."" If there was a point of contention, it was the team's 25 turnovers that the Magic turned into 25 points. Harden scored 24 points but had five turnovers, as did fellow starter Kris Dunn. ""We knew it was gonna be nasty, but 25 turnovers just makes no sense,"" Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue said of playing against the Magic's rugged defense. ""We've gotta be better all around the board in just taking care of the basketball."" The Kings enter off a 109-108 loss to the Atlanta Hawks at home Monday when Keon Ellis scored a career-high 33 while making nine 3-pointers in 15 attempts. De'Aaron Fox scored 28 points, while the Kings were without DeMar DeRozan and Domantas Sabonis because of back injuries. Malik Monk (ankle) also was out. ""(My teammates) just kept saying, ‘Let it fly,'"" Ellis said, according to the Sacramento Bee. ""Same with the coaches. Everyone kept saying keep shooting it. I think everyone kind of knew I was on fire."" Sacramento is 3-4 going back to Nov. 8 in a stretch that began with a 107-98 home loss to the Clippers. It is one of just two times the Kings failed to score 100 points in a game this season. Fox leads Sacramento with 28.8 points per game, while Sabonis (20.2 points) leads in rebounds (12.5) and assists (6.6). The veteran DeRozan is scoring 22.9 points in his first season with the Kings. Sabonis and DeRozan were full participants in practice Wednesday and Thursday and are expected to return against the Clippers. Monk is expected to miss his sixth consecutive game. The Clippers will have to take a different route to a repeat victory over the Kings after Powell led Los Angeles earlier this month with 31 points and 12 rebounds.

He sealed the outcome by draining two foul shots with 9.3 seconds remaining. Johnson's performance at the stripe was something the Orange (3-1) couldn't duplicate.

They'll give it yet another go when they visit,"The Buffalo Sabres have had several chances to go above .500 this season but have yet to seize on one. They'll give it yet another go when they visit the Anaheim Ducks on Friday. Buffalo is 0-3-0 in its three previous attempts to post a winning record this season. The Sabres pulled themselves back to even Wednesday with a 1-0 win against the Los Angeles Kings, a contest that was scoreless after two periods before Jason Zucker's power-play goal 38 seconds into the third. That improved them to 5-2-0 in their past seven games after a three-game losing streak. ""That's part of the growth,"" coach Lindy Ruff said. ""You've got to get comfortable in a game like that where it's tight. ... I thought our compete on the puck was where it needed to be to win a hockey game and their compete was high, too. It was a hard game from start to finish for both teams."" Goaltender Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen returned against Los Angeles after missing two games with a lower-body injury to earn his sixth career NHL shutout. The 25-year-old is 4-0-0 in five starts since Nov. 5 and allowed just four goals in those wins. ""His size, but then his ability to get post to post, flexibility, and make those big saves ... That really energizes a group,"" forward Beck Malenstyn told the Buffalo News. ""I think he makes a lot of those timely saves for us, and we have all the trust in the world in him back there."" After a woeful 0-for-22 run on the power play to start the season, the Sabres have turned the corner with the man advantage. Since Zucker broke the drought on Oct. 26, Buffalo is 11-for-37, a 29.7 percent efficiency that ranked third in the NHL in that span entering Thursday's schedule. The Ducks have hit a groove of their own of late, riding a three-game winning streak and winners of four of their past five after a four-game skid. They followed up a 6-4 win against the Detroit Red Wings on Nov. 15 with a 4-2 victory against the Dallas Stars on Nov. 18 and a 3-2 win against the Chicago Blackhawks the next night. ""Our team's kind of starting to jell, we're starting to get some chemistry within the lines,"" forward Alex Killorn said. ""We're not scoring a ton of goals but we're not allowing a ton to go in. Our defensive play's been great."" Anaheim has allowed an average of 2.6 goals against over its past five games, giving up more than three goals only once. Lukas Dostal and John Gibson have alternated starts in goal over that stretch. Second-year forward Leo Carlsson, 19, shares the team lead with Troy Terry with six goals and is second only to Terry in points with 10, by way of two fewer assists. ""I think we're on a path where we can take another step forward soon, hopefully,"" Carlsson told Hockey Sverige. ""Many of us are still only 19, 20, or 21 years old, and it's not easy to make that leap. But there's a good feeling in the team, and we're confident."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.23,0.77

Collin Murray-Boyles scored 16 points and grabbed nine rebounds for South Carolina (3-2), which bounced back from a loss Saturday at No. 16 Indiana. Zachary Davis contributed 18 points off the bench and Jacobi Wright added 11 points and five assists for the Gamecocks. South Carolina shot 49.1 percent from the floor and made 12 of 27 (44.4 percent) of its shots from deep. Mercer was nearly as accurate, hitting 45.6 percent of its field goal attempts, including 12 of 26 (46.2 percent) from distance. Tyler Johnson hit four 3-pointers on his way to scoring 15 points for Mercer (2-3) of the Southern Conference. Ahmad Robinson scored 11 of his 13 points in the second half and finished with eight assists before fouling out with 5:25 left. Alex Holt and Angel Montas Jr. added 14 points apiece for Mercer. The Bears were gunning for their first upset of a power-conference team since toppling Georgia Tech in 2020. When Robinson made a 3-pointer with 10:47 left, it gave Mercer a 60-59 lead. But the Gamecocks were the more efficient team down the stretch as they outscored the Bears 25-12 over the final 10:33. Mercer's hopes faded as it failed to make a field goal in a span of 6:01. Myles Stute highlighted South Carolina's charge with his lone basket of the game, a 3-pointer with 7:41 left that stretched the Gamecocks' lead to 70-62. In a tightly contested first half, there were 10 lead changes and neither team led by more than six points. Playing under first-year coach Ryan Ridder, Mercer showed no nerves early as it hit its first three attempts from beyond the arc, including a pair of treys from Cam Bryant. South Carolina finished with a flurry at the end of the first half as a 3-pointer by Cam Scott helped the Gamecocks to a 36-32 advantage at the break. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.34,0.66

With the best-of-three quarterfinal knotted at 1-1, U.S. Davis Cup captain Bob Bryan opted to swap out Paris Olympic silver medalists Rajeev Ram and Austin Krajicek for singles players Ben Shelton and Tommy Paul. The move backfired as Shelton and Paul lost 6-4, 6-4 to Jordan Thompson and Matthew Ebden, sending the Aussies into the quarterfinals. The U.S. holds the Davis Cup record with 32 titles but hasn't won since Bryan was on the team in 2007, and has not advanced to the semifinals since 2018. Shelton lost a marathon third-set tiebreaker to Thanasi Kokkinakis as the Australian prevailed 6-1, 4-6, 7-6 (14) in the opening singles match. Taylor Fritz responded for the U.S. by taking down Alex de Minaur 6-3, 6-4 in just 71 minutes in a battle of top-10 players in the world. Meanwhile, Italy defeated Argentina 2-1 and will face Australia in the semifinals on Friday. The other semifinal, which will be held on Thursday, features Germany against the Netherlands. Against Argentina, World No. 1 Jannik Sinner won his singles match and then teamed up with Matteo Berrettini in the decisive doubles match, defeating Andres Molteni and Maximo Gonzalez 6-4, 7-5. Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo defeated Lorenzo Musetti 6-4, 6-1 to open the match, but Sinner saved Italy from elimination by taking down Sebastian Baez 6-2, 6-1, forcing doubles to decide the winner. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,0,0.5,0.5

Bryson Tucker had 14 points off the bench for the Hoosiers (4-0), while Mackenzie Mgbako, Malik Reneau and Oumar Ballo all finished with nine points. Ballo grabbed 11 rebounds and Reneau snagged 10.   Indiana had to rely on defense as it had numerous rough patches on the offensive end.   Ronald Polite III's 17 points and Donovan Atwell's 10 points paced UNCG (2-2), which shot 31.7 percent from the floor. Kenyon Giles finished 3-for-17 from the field and Atwell was 3-for-15, including 3-for-12 on 3-pointers.   The Spartans connected on nine 3-point shots but had only 11 baskets from 2-point territory. They couldn't sustain enough offense to make a charge in the final 10:52 after the Hoosiers used a 9-0 run to extend their lead to 54-42.   Indiana made 14 of 16 free throws, while UNCG hit 9 of 15 from the line.  The visitors pulled even at 40-40 by beginning the second half on a 13-4 run, capped by Malik Henry's three-point play. Tucker countered with a three-point play and another jumper for the Hoosiers, who led the rest of the way.   Tucker added another jumper during Indiana's nine-point surge after Akrum Ahemed's layup had drawn the Spartans within 45-42.   The Hoosiers, who have played only home games so far, built a 21-5 lead less than nine minutes into the contest. They went scoreless over the next five-plus minutes but did not let UNCG creep closer than seven points.   Indiana went on to lead 36-27 at halftime despite not hitting a shot in the final 2:36 of the period. Rice posted 14 points by halftime.

A spokesperson for TGL, which debuts Jan. 7 at the SoFi Center in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla, told Front Office Sports that discussions between the league and LPGA have already occurred, though any collaboration would only happen sometime after the league's inaugural season. LPGA commissioner Mollie Marcoux Samaan said on Wednesday at the CME Group Tour Championship in Naples, Fla., that the tour had been exploring ways to boost its marketing of LPGA players, including ""exploring some synergies with TGL."" ""We've been talking to them for a while,"" Marcoux Samaan said. ""It will be great to get our athletes in different positions. You know, with different exposure, different innovation in golf. The LPGA should be in every conversation about golf. So we've been talking to those guys for a long time, and I think we'll try to figure something out -- how we can work together, whatever that looks like."" Per the report, TGL may create a separate women's league down the line or have a mixed event involving players from both the PGA and LPGA. TGL will combine simulator golf with an actual short game area via its hybrid virtual format, so instead of teeing off at different locations, TGL mixed events would allow all golfers to tee off from the same spot -- improving the viewing experience for fans. Mixed events have become more popular of late, including McIlroy defeating Max Homa and LPGA pros Rose Zhang and Lexi Thompson in the made-for-TV golf series ""The Match."" That event, held in February, was the first version of the series to include female golfers. The $2.4 million won by McIlroy went to charity. In December, Zhang and World No. 1 Nelly Korda will be among the LPGA starts participating in the second year of the Grant Thornton Invitational, along with PGA Tour and TGL members Sahith Theegala and Rickie Fowler. The invitational is a co-sanctioned PGA Tour/LPGA Tour event established last year. There may also be a 36-hole mixed-team golf tournament at the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, with a proposal awaiting response from the International Olympic Committee. Also, Solheim Cup U.S. team captain Stacy Lewis said in September that she would like to see the biennial Presidents Cup become a mixed event. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.46,0.54

Authorities are looking into whether Miller bet on his own games while at Temple. Miller transferred to Virginia Tech in the offseason, but on Oct. 23 the program dismissed him ""due to circumstances prior to his enrollment at Virginia Tech."" ESPN reported that the reason for Miller's dismissal was both a federal investigation and an NCAA inquiry into point-shaving. The NCAA did not comment to ESPN, and the FBI did not confirm or deny that an investigation was taking place. A regular-season game between Temple and UAB on March 7 was flagged by U.S. Integrity, a gambling watchdog firm, for unusual wagering activity. UAB began the day a 1.5- or 2-point favorite at sportsbooks but the spread ballooned to -8 by mid-afternoon, causing some books to halt betting on the game. Miller had eight points on 3-of-9 shooting and three turnovers in that game, which UAB ran away with, 100-72. The next day, Temple acknowledged in a statement that it was reviewing the reports of unusual betting. Per ESPN, the NCAA has been investigating Temple and Miller for ""several months,"" and bookmakers uncovered that some customers who had bet against Temple on March 7 also had done so throughout the season, often betting on both the game result and the total points scored in the first half. ""Hysier Miller has overcome more adversity in his 22 years than most people face in their lifetime. He will meet and overcome whatever obstacles lay ahead,"" Miller's attorney, Jason P. Bologna, told ESPN. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.48,0.52

In a game with 14 lead changes and nine ties where both teams struggled to score, Jenkins was the best player on the floor after dealing with foul trouble in the first half. The Old Dominion transfer made 6 of 12 shots despite going 0-for-2 before halftime. He snapped a 63-63 tie with a fadeaway over Phillip Russell from the left side off an inbounds play with 2:21 left. After VCU's Max Shulga split two free throws with 2:08 left, David Tubek sank a 3 from the right side over Jack Clark for a 68-64 lead with 35 seconds left before the Pirates sweated out the final seconds. Shulga hit a jumper with 13 seconds left to make it a two-point game and Jenkins split two at the line with 10 seconds left. The game ended when Joe Bamisile missed a 3 from the right side with five seconds left as Jenkins went over to contest. Jenkins also helped the Pirates (3-2) overcome an eight-point deficit in the final 11 minutes of regulation and hit a layup for a 61-59 lead with 15 seconds left but Shulga went by a double-team for a tying layup with two seconds left.

Nikola Jokic, a three-time MVP, missed the Nuggets' recent three-game road trip due to personal reasons. He is listed as questionable for Friday's game, but the Mavericks will definitely be without Luka Doncic, who suffered a right wrist injury Tuesday night and will miss at least a week. It's a blow for Dallas entering what is essentially an elimination game in the NBA Cup group stage. The Mavericks and the Nuggets have one loss each in the West Group C standings, and the loser Friday night will not advance to the knockout round. Doncic has missed time this season with a bothersome knee and will now sit for at least four games, per ESPN. ""Injuries are a part of sport and unfortunately he's had a couple of here early,"" Dallas coach Jason Kidd said. ""Hopefully that means he won't have any going forward. After this last one, hopefully he's clean for the rest of the way."" The Mavericks still have Kyrie Irving in the backcourt, and he almost beat Denver on his own nearly two weeks ago. He scored a season-high 43 points but missed the potential game-winning 3-pointer in the final seconds as the Mavericks fell 122-120. Dallas was without P.J. Washington and Dereck Lively II in that loss on Nov. 10, but both players have returned. The Mavericks have to overcome Doncic's absence to win their fourth straight game. ""Next man up. Just be ready to guard the best man or just have the best man guard you,"" center Daniel Gafford said. ""It's going to be a lot on (Irving). It's going to be a lot on Klay (Thompson). but I feel like we've done a pretty good job whenever Luka has been off the floor. ... The strategy is still the same."" The Nuggets lost their first two road games with Jokic sidelined but beat Memphis 122-110 on Tuesday night for its first group stage win. Russell Westbrook notched his NBA-record 200th career triple-double in the win over the Grizzlies, but Denver lost forward Vlatko Cancar to a left knee injury. ""Not necessarily (season-ending). It could go a couple different ways,"" coach Michael Malone said on Cancar's injury after Thursday's practice. ""We're still gathering information, letting the knee calm down a little bit. So I don't want to get doom and gloom. But he's out for the foreseeable future."" Losing Cancar, who missed last season with an ACL tear, is another blow to the team's depth. The Nuggets are already without Aaron Gordon (calf) and possibly Jokic, who is averaging a triple-double.  Malone has shown he is not shy about going deep into his bench. Guard Trey Alexander played nine minutes against Memphis on Tuesday and may get a chance to play more. Dario Saric has rejoined the rotation after not playing for five straight games. Saric started for Jokic in the three road games and had 10 points and 10 rebounds in Denver's 105-90 loss to the Grizzlies on Sunday night. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.39,0.61

Houston enters Thursday third in defensive rating at 104.8 points allowed per 100 possessions following Wednesday's 130-113 home victory over the Indiana Pacers.  The Rockets aim to clamp down even tighter when they continue their three-game homestand on Friday against the Portland Trail Blazers in the second NBA Cup game for both. Houston and Portland are 1-0 in Western Conference Group A action. Baked into the Rockets' defensive might is their ability to force turnovers which, combined with their penchant for grabbing offensive rebounds, continues to atone for an inefficient offense. Houston has also cultivated a reputation for scoring in transition, and most of everything behind the Rockets' early-season success was on display against the Pacers.  Houston turned 23 Pacers turnovers into 30 points and recorded 23 fastbreak points. The Rockets are fourth in the league in points off turnovers at 20.6 per game, and their 18.1 fastbreak points per game rank behind only the Toronto Raptors and Denver Nuggets. Toronto is the only team scoring more second-chance points than Houston, which is tallying 18.1 per game. The Rockets had a modest 16 second-chance points off 13 offensive rebounds against the Pacers, but they also finished with a plus-19 margin in field goal attempts. The penchant to crash the offensive boards and force opponents into miscues has served Houston well through 16 games, with designs for more of the same as the season unfolds. ""That's offensive rebounds and turnovers from us,"" Rockets coach Ime Udoka said. ""We obviously take a look at those things first. Not just 23 turnovers, 16 of those were steals so our activity was great, which leads to live-ball turnovers so we can get out and run. That's where we came up with those 23 fastbreak points."" Alperen Sengun led Houston with a season-high 31 points and 12 rebounds in Wednesday's win. The fourth-year center is second on the team in scoring (18.4 points per game) and leads the Rockets in rebounding (11.1 per game). On Wednesday, the Trail Blazers' 109-99 road loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder snapped their three-game winning streak. Portland was without two of its top four scorers in Anfernee Simons (chest) and Deandre Ayton (finger), facilitating the need for others to help fill the offensive void. Second-year forward Toumani Camara responded by pairing 14 points with nine rebounds. Camara's 11 shot attempts were one off his season-high, and his points and rebounds matched his second-highest totals this season. Camara ranks just ninth on the Trail Blazers with 9.1 points per game, but he has proven capable of handling a greater workload when called upon. ""The thing about Tou is there are going to be some nights where he gets four shots and there are going to be some nights where he gets 11. It just happens that way,"" Portland coach Chauncey Billups said. ""He's going to have some of these nights where he's scoring more than normal. He's certainly capable to do that.  ""Tou knows who Tou is. He's not going to run around out there taking all kinds of crazy shots because they're just there.

Underwood committed to LSU in early January but the Wolverines remained in contact with the Belleville, Mich. native. Less than two weeks before the start of the early signing period, he made it official that he's headed to Ann Arbor during a social media video. Speculation that Underwood might flip from LSU to Michigan picked up after four-star quarterback Carter Smith decommitted from the Wolverines in late October. When Underwood announced his original commitment to LSU on Jan. 6 in the Belleville High cafeteria, Michigan was one of the three finalists along with Alabama. The 6-foot-4 Underwood won two state titles at Belleville, which is located approximately 20 miles east from Ann Arbor. He fell short in both his junior and senior seasons. Underwood's high school career ended last Friday night when Belleville lost 35-21 to Novi Detroit Catholic Central in a Division I quarterfinal matchup. Underwood bypassed Michigan in January two days before the Wolverines defeated Washington in the national championship game. At that time, there was heavy speculation that coach Jim Harbaugh would not return to Michigan. Harbaugh indeed left for the NFL's Los Angeles Chargers and he was replaced by offensive coordinator Sherrone Moore, who is 5-5 this season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.18,0.82

Ohtani was named National League Most Valuable Player following his first season with the Los Angeles Dodgers, while Judge won his second American League MVP in three seasons with the New York Yankees. For the third time in four years, Ohtani won a league MVP award by unanimous vote; last year he became the only player to do so multiple times. Judge was also the unanimous winner in the AL, the 20th player to accomplish the feat. Francisco Lindor of the New York Mets finished second in NL voting and Ketel Marte of the Arizona Diamondbacks was third. In the AL, Kansas City Royals star Bobby Witt Jr. received all 30 second-place votes and Judge's Yankee teammate Juan Soto finished third. The honor for Ohtani caps a particularly memorable month after he helped the Dodgers to the franchise's second championship in 36 seasons with a five-game World Series win over the Yankees. Ohtani, 30, became just the second player to win the MVP in both leagues after Frank Robinson did it in 1961 with the NL's Cincinnati Reds and in 1966 with the AL's Baltimore Orioles. He also became the first MVP winner while playing as his team's primary designated hitter. A shoulder injury prevented Ohtani from pitching this past season, but as a two-way player for the Los Angeles Angels, he won unanimous AL MVPs in both 2021 and 2023. In 159 games during the 2024 regular season, Ohtani batted .310 and led the NL in OPS (1.036), slugging percentage (.646), home runs (54) and RBIs (130). He became the first player to hit 50 homers and steal 50 bases, taking 59. He narrowly missed out on the league's triple crown, finishing second for the NL batting title to the San Diego Padres' Luis Arraez (.314). In the first postseason of his career, Ohtani batted .230 with a .767 OPS, with three home runs and 10 RBIs. He injured his shoulder in Game 2 of the World Series yet continued to play and batted just .105 with no RBIs in five games. Ohtani had shoulder surgery after the World Series ended and is expected to be ready to play by the start of spring training. Judge, 32, led the Yankees to the World Series after batting .322 with a 1.159 OPS in 158 games this past regular season. He also had an MLB-best 58 home runs with 144 RBIs. His home-run total did not match the 62 he hit while winning the AL MVP in 2022, but his OPS was better than his 1.111 mark from that season. Judge did not win the MVP in 2023 after a toe injury cost him more than a month. In 14 postseason games in October, Judge batted just .184 with a .752 OPS, including three home runs and nine RBIs. In five World Series games, he batted .222 with a lone home run that came early in Game 5 before the Dodgers rallied to win the title. During the 2024 regular season, Judge set career highs in batting average, on-base percentage (.458), slugging percentage (.701). OPS, hits (180), doubles (36), RBIs and walks (133). He was named to the AL All-Star team for the sixth time. While Ohtani was playing the first season of a 10-year, $700 million contract with the Dodgers, Judge was in the second season of a nine-year, $360 million contract with the Yankees. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-22,1,0.39,0.61

The Los Angeles Dodgers star added his third Most Valuable Player award to his collection and first in the National League when he was chosen unanimously by the Baseball Writers' Association of America on Thursday. Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees won the American League award for the second time, also unanimously. Ohtani last year became the first two-time unanimous MVP. He won the AL award in 2021 and 2023 as a two-way star for the Los Angeles Angels and finished second to Judge in 2022 voting.  He didn’t pitch in 2024 following elbow surgery and signed a record $700 million, 10-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers last December. Ohtani became the first player to reach 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in a season, then helped the Dodgers beat the Yankees in the World Series. “The fact that I knew I wasn’t going to be able to pitch this season just made me focus more on my offensive game and fortunately I was able to produce and get this award,” Ohtani said through a translator. Ohtani sat on a red sofa with his wife and dog Decoy as teammate Clayton Kershaw announced the award on the MLB Network. The Nederlanse kooikerhondje immediately jumped away. Ohtani received all 30 first-place votes and 420 points. New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor was second with 263 points and Arizona second baseman Ketel Marte third with 229.  Judge was a unanimous pick for the first time. Kansas City shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. got all 30 second-place votes for 270 points, and Yankees outfielder Juan Soto was third with 21 third-place votes and 229 points. Ohtani hit .310, stole 59 bases and led the NL with 54 homers and 130 RBIs exclusively as a designated hitter, becoming the first player with 50 or more homers and 50 or more stolen bases in a season. A highlight of the season was during the dog days. Ball in mouth, Decoy delivered the ceremonial first pitch to his owner at Dodger Stadium's home plate before an Aug. 28 game against Baltimore. “The most nerve-wracking game that I had, the most nervous I was when we had that Decoy throw out the first pitch,” he said. Ohtani played the final three games of the World Series with a torn labrum in his left shoulder. Still recovering from right elbow surgery in September 2023, Ohtani had another operation on Nov. 5 to repair the shoulder and has been working on range of motion and started Thursday on core and lower body work. “The goal is to be ready for opening day and that includes hitting and pitching,” Ohtani said. “But we are kind of taking our time."" When Ohtani resumes pitching, could he win MVP and the Cy Young Award in the same year? “That would obviously be great, but right now my focus is just to get to get back healthy, come back stronger, get back on the mound and show everybody what I can do,” Ohtani said. Ohtani became the first primary designated hitter and first player who didn't appear defensively for a single inning to win an MVP. His season started with the revelation longtime interpreter and friend, Ippei Mizuhara had stolen nearly $17 million from the star to fund gambling. Ohtani is the 12th player with three or more MVPs, joining Barry Bonds (seven) and Jimmie Foxx, Joe DiMaggio, Stan Musial, Roy Campanella, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Mike Schmidt, Alex Rodriguez, Albert Pujols and Mike Trout (three each). Balloting was conducted before the postseason. “Moving forward, I think now we do have a target on our back,” Ohtani said. “We are going to be expected to maybe even do — possibly even do more.” Judge led the major leagues with 58 homers, 144 RBIs and 133 walks while hitting .322. Witt topped the big leagues with a .332 average, hitting 32 homers with 31 stolen bases and 109 RBIs. Soto batted .288 with 41 homers and 109 RBIs. When Judge won his first MVP award in 2022, he received 28 first-place votes while Ohtani got the other two. Judge had discussed the MVP award with Philadelphia’s Bryce Harper, the NL winner in 2015 and ’21. “I was telling him, `Man, I’m going to try to catch up to you with these MVPs here, man,’” Judge recalled. “He’d say, hopefully, he could stay a couple ahead of me, which I think he’ll do.” When Judge won his first MVP award in 2022, he received 28 first-place votes while Ohtani got the other two. He is the Yankees' 22nd MVP winner, four more than any other team. Judge was hitting .207 with six homers and 18 RBIs through April, then batted .352 with 52 homers and 126 RBIs in 127 games. “March and April were not my friend this year.” Judge said. “Just keep putting in the work and things are going to change. You can’t mope. You can’t feel sorry for yourself. Especially in New York, nobody’s going to feel sorry for you. So you just got to go out there and put up the numbers.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-22,1,0.48,0.52

(AP) — Bryce Underwood, the top-rated football recruit in the country, flipped to Michigan after pledging to play at LSU, a person familiar with the decision said Thursday night. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share the recruit's plans to join the Wolverines. Underwood pinned a post on his Instagram account, showing a post from On3.com that reported he has committed to Michigan. The 6-foot-3, 205-pound quarterback played at Belleville High School, which is about 15 miles east of Ann Arbor, and told LSU nearly a year ago that he intended to play there. Underwood and his family wore LSU jewelry in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, earlier this month when Alabama beat the Tigers 42-13. Michigan coach Sherrone Moore, whose debut season has been stunted by the lack of a productive quarterback, continued to recruit Underwood with the help of a name, image and likeness collective, and it paid off. With a player as highly regarded as Underwood, NIL offers can reach $5 million to $10 million. Michigan has partnered with a collective, Champions Circle, to create opportunities for athletes to make money, and the group responded to Underwood's commitment. “ We are very excited to keep Bryce home in Michigan as he continues to build his legacy,” Nate Forbes, founding member and chairman of Champions Circle, said in a statement. Underwood's commitment gives the defending national champion Wolverines a jolt of hope. Michigan (5-5, 3-4 Big Ten) has to beat Northwestern (4-6, 2-5) on Saturday to become bowl eligible before closing the season on the road against second-ranked rival Ohio State. ___ Follow Larry Lage at https://apnews.com/author/larry-lage ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Kelce announced during an appearance on ABC's “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on Thursday night that he will host “They Call It Late Night with Jason Kelce,” on ESPN. The one-hour show will tape on five straight Friday nights beginning Jan. 3. That coincides with the last week of the NFL's regular season and the playoffs. The show will originate in front of a live audience from Union Transfer in Philadelphia. The first four episodes will air at 1 a.m. EST starting on Jan. 4 with the final episode coming on at 1:30 a.m. EST on Feb. 1. “I loved late-night shows, I’ve always loved them. I remember sleepovers watching Conan O’Brien with my friends,” Kelce said on Kimmel's show. “We’re going to have a bunch of guys up there — legends of the game, friends that I played with, coaches, celebrities,” Kelce said. The Philadelphia-based band Snacktime will provide the show's music. The show's title is a homage to “They Call it Pro Football,” which was NFL Films’ first full-length film in 1967. NFL Films originated in Philadelphia and founders Ed and Steve Sabol are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. It also featured the legendary voice of John Facenda, who did the news on Philadelphia television before becoming better known as the voice of NFL Films. NFL Films will produce the show in conjunction with Kelce’s Wooderboy Productions and Skydance Sports. Each episode will also be also seen on Replays airing on ESPN2, and also be available on ESPN+, ESPN's YouTube channel and the Jason Kelce channel on YouTube.  Kelce is in the first year of a multi-year agreement with ESPN. He appears on the network's “Monday Night Countdown” show as well as providing halftime and postgame analysis. He played 13 years for the Philadelphia Eagles before retiring at the end of last season and was the most sought-after former player by networks. He participated in last year’s NFL Broadcasting and Media Workshop, which used to be known as the “Broadcast Bootcamp.” Kelce has made news lately, though, for other reasons. He was involved in a confrontation with a fan in State College, Pennsylvania, before the Penn State-Ohio State game on Nov. 2, when a fan heckled Kelce and appeared to shout an anti-gay slur about his brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, for dating pop star Taylor Swift. Video showed Kelce grabbing the fan’s phone and throwing it to the ground. Kelce apologized about the incident on ESPN on Nov. 4. On Thursday night an autograph seeker verbally confronted Kelce outside the El Capitan Entertainment Center in Hollywood, where “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” is taped. Video obtained by TMZ shows Kelce explaining that he doesn’t sign autographs for people that follow where he is going. After being shouted at for over two minutes, Kelce eventually got out of the car and signed autographs, including shaking the hand of a man who was berating Kelce with obscenities. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-22,0,0.52,0.48

But a judge hearing the case suggested the message the parents sent may matter more than their intentions. Kyle Fellers and Anthony Foote sued the Bow school district after being banned from school grounds for wearing the wristbands at their daughters' soccer game in September. The no-trespass orders have since expired, but a judge is deciding whether the plaintiffs should be allowed to wear the wristbands and carry signs at upcoming school events, including basketball games, swim meets and a music concert, while the case proceeds. Testifying at Thursday's hearing, both men said that they did not view the wristbands as a protest against Parker Tirrell, a transgender girl on the opposing team, but rather as a show of support for their daughters and their teammates. U.S. District Court Judge Steven McAuliffe questioned whether there is a meaningful distinction and whether their intentions matter.  “Sometimes the message you think you’re sending might not be the message that is being sent,” he said.  McAuliffe asked Foote whether it occurred to him that a transgender person might interpret the pink XX wristbands as an attempt to invalidate their existence. “If he’s a trans female, pink might be a color he likes,” Foote said. McAuliffe also noted that while both plaintiffs said they had no problem with transgender people outside the issue of sports, they repeatedly referred to the athlete in question as a boy. “You seem to go out of your way to suggest there’s no such thing as a trans girl,” McAuliffe said. Foote disagreed, saying it was “like learning a new language” to refer to transgender people. In a separate courtroom earlier Thursday, another judge held a hearing on a lawsuit brought by Parker Tirrell and another student challenging the state law that bans transgender athletes in grades 5 to 12 from teams that align with their gender identity. It requires schools to designate all teams as either girls, boys or coed, with eligibility determined based on students’ birth certificates “or other evidence.” U.S. District Court Chief Judge Landya McCafferty ruled earlier this year that the teens can try out for and play on girls school sports teams. The order only applies to those two individuals for now as they seek to overturn the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act on behalf of all transgender girl students in New Hampshire.  Lawyers for the teens said in court Thursday they hoped the matter could go to trial and be resolved before the start of the next school year in September. They said the teens’ school districts and others in the state have asked for guidance regarding the statute. Lawyers for the state said they needed more time to prepare.  Judge Talesha Saint-Marc suggested the timing of the trial was ambitious and asked that both sides talk further about scheduling.  Gov. Chris Sununu, who signed the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act into law in July, has said it “ensures fairness and safety in women’s sports by maintaining integrity and competitive balance in athletic competitions.” About half of states have adopted similar measures. In the Bow case, school district officials have said they acted appropriately in sanctioning the parents for conduct they knew violated school policy at athletic events. They'll explain their evidence on Friday. On Thursday, the plaintiff's lawyer, Endel Kolde, accused the district of “breathtaking” overreach by asserting that the wristbands target transgender students in general, regardless of whether such students were present at the events. “This is viewpoint discrimination, and it’s very clear they’re proud of it,” Kolde said. Kolde initially conceded that a school district can limit speech “to some degree” to protect children from harassment, but he stopped short of agreeing with the judge’s claim that yelling “transgender students out” at a particular player would be subject to such regulation. “It might be,” he said. “I’m trying to get you to concede the obvious,” McAuliffe said. “It’s less than obvious to me,” Kolde said. Feller, the first witness in the case involving the wristbands, said he purchased them thinking his daughter and her teammates would wear them, but ended up wearing one himself after they declined. After being told to leave the game, he stood in the parking lot with a sign that said “Protect women’s sports for female athletes.” “I wanted to support women’s sports and I believed what was going on was a travesty,” he said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-22,0,0.52,0.48
ABC News: Sports,"If the Jets don't want Aaron Rodgers back, the 4-time MVP will find another home: Analysis",https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/jets-aaron-rodgers-back-4-time-mvp-find-116126622,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 08:02:21 -0500",Joe Douglas is gone,"Joe Douglas is gone On Football analyzes the biggest topics in the NFL from week to week. For more On Football analysis, head here. ___ Joe Douglas is gone. Robert Saleh already was fired. Aaron Rodgers could be next to leave the New York Jets. Douglas lost his job as the general manager on Tuesday, six weeks after the head coach was replaced following a 2-3 start. The Jets have gone 1-5 under interim coach Jeff Ulbrich so owner Woody Johnson sent Douglas packing. Rodgers has played more like a 40-year-old quarterback coming off an Achilles tendon injury than a four-time NFL MVP. He’s expressed a desire to play another season. The big question is whether the Jets will want him back. Maybe they’ll decide to take one more shot at a playoff run with Rodgers while having him mentor a rookie quarterback. Or, they could start fresh. There are significant contract ramifications either way. Rodgers is slated to make a non-guaranteed $37.5 million in 2025 with a dead cap hit of $49 million as his salary cap total goes from $17.1 million to $23.5 million. The Jets could spread the dead money over two years by releasing Rodgers with the use of post-June 1 designation. He has a no-trade clause in his contract so they would need his permission to make a deal. If Rodgers doesn’t retire and New York’s new regime wants a clean slate, here are potential destinations for the future first-ballot Hall of Famer: SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS: This could only happen if Brock Purdy’s shoulder injury is more significant than is known. Rodgers is a native of northern California and grew up a Niners fan. Returning home to help San Francisco win its sixth Super Bowl has to be attractive. Playing for coach Kyle Shanahan surrounded by playmakers Christian McCaffrey, Deebo Samuel and George Kittle would be a quarterback’s dream. Again, Purdy is the team’s present and future. And, he’s resilient. Purdy rebounded from elbow surgery following his rookie season to start Week 1 last year and ended up finishing fourth in MVP voting, leading the 49ers to the Super Bowl. Purdy also is due for a contract extension and a major raise so the salary cap makes this even more of a longshot. But never say never in the NFL. MINNESOTA VIKINGS: Sam Darnold has been more than a stopgap, helping the Vikings (8-2) to an impressive start. J.J. McCarthy is the future, however, and Darnold will be a free agent after the season. If the Vikings fall short of a Super Bowl and Rodgers shows over the final six weeks that he can play championship football, this could be a fit. The Vikings could let McCarthy sit and learn for another year, especially coming off a knee injury that required a second surgery earlier this month. NEW YORK GIANTS: Rodgers wouldn’t have to move. The Giants will need a quarterback after benching Daniel Jones this week with the intent to move on from him. They could draft a quarterback in the first round and have him learn behind Rodgers for a season. That’ll depend on which pick New York ends up with because it’s a thin draft class. Unlike the Jets, the Giants (2-8) haven’t made any coaching or GM changes yet. If it’s status quo with GM Joe Schoen and coach Brian Daboll, one year with Rodgers isn’t unrealistic. LAS VEGAS RAIDERS: They also need a quarterback. Brock Bowers could set an NFL record for most catches by a tight end if he had Rodgers next season. The Raiders (2-8) are aiming for a high pick to get a shot at a quarterback of their choice. New minority owner Tom Brady believes rookie quarterbacks need time to develop and learn. The seven-time Super Bowl champion would have to be in favor of having Rodgers start and tutor a youngster. TENNESSEE TITANS: If Will Levis doesn’t prove over the final seven games that he can be a No. 1 quarterback, the Titans (2-8) will be in the QB market and likely have a high draft pick. It’s another scenario where Rodgers would fit as a one-year bridge. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-22,0,0.75,0.25
ABC News: Sports,F1 closer to approving expanded grid for General Motors entry initially started by Michael Andretti,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/f1-closer-approving-andretti-bid-expanded-grid-michael-116122396,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 09:46:34 -0500","With a restructuring at Andretti Global that pushed Michael Andretti into a smaller role, the chances of his organization landing a Formula 1 team have substantially increased","With a restructuring at Andretti Global that pushed Michael Andretti into a smaller role, the chances of his organization landing a Formula 1 team have substantially increased LAS VEGAS -- With a restructuring at Andretti Global that pushed Michael Andretti into a smaller role, the chances of his organization landing a Formula 1 team have substantially increased.  So much so that F1 and Formula One Management could have a decision to grant the General Motors-backed entry a spot as the 11th team on the grid in the coming weeks. Dan Towriss, now the majority owner of the Andretti organization, was at the Las Vegas Grand Prix on Thursday scoping his chances of entering the top motorsports series in the world.  So was the FBI, allegedly, as part of a Department of Justice investigation into why F1 denied the Andretti organization expansion into the series. F1 currently has 10 teams that field 20 cars and only one — the organization owned by California businessman Gene Haas — is an American team.  Las Vegas marks the third race this season in the United States, more than any other country, as F1 has exploded in American popularity over the last five years.  Even so, Andretti could not get approval from F1 to enter the series. But, the situation changed in September when Andretti scaled back his role with his namesake organization. Now with Towriss in charge, talks have amplified, even though it is not clear what the name of an Andretti-less F1 team would even be. Cadillac would do the engines — but says it won't be ready until 2028 — which means a 2026 Towriss-led F1 team would be GM branded but with a partner engine supplier.  Most of the existing teams have been largely opposed to an 11th team entering F1, citing a dilution in prize money and the massive expenses they've already committed to the series. But, Andretti among others believed the teams' position was personal in that they simply didn't like Andretti, who ran 13 races in the 1993 season. His father, Mario, is the 1978 F1 world champion.  The Andretti application had already been approved by the FIA, which is F1's ruling body, but later denied by F1 itself. F1 promised to revisit the issue once General Motors had an engine ready to compete.  The existing 10 F1 teams have no actual vote or say in if the grid is expanded, which Mercedes boss Toto Wolff reiterated Thursday when The Associated Press asked why the sudden chance of acceptance in a potential 11th team.  “We have an obligation, a statutory obligation as directors, to present the standpoint that is the best for our company and for our employees, and we’ve done that,” Wolff said. ""I think if a team can add to the championship, particularly if GM decides to come in as a team owner, that is a different story.  “And as long as it is creative, that means we’re growing the popularity of the sport, we’re growing the revenue of the sport, then no team will be ever against it. So I’m putting my hope in there.” Wolff has been eager to hear from Towriss directly on what the plans for the organization are now that Andretti has a smaller role.  “No one from Andretti or Andretti Global or whatever the name will be has ever spoken to me a single sentence in presentation of what the creative part is,” he said. ""But they don’t need to because the teams don’t decide. It is the commercial rights holder, with the FIA, we have no say. If I want to be invited to a party and go to the party, I’m sitting down at the table and telling who I am and why I’m really good fun and sitting here and everybody will enjoy my presence.  “That hasn’t happened, but you know, that’s now my personal point of view, not a professional, because there’s nothing we can do, nothing we can say,” Wolff continued. “And I don’t know the people. I’ve obviously spoken to Mario. I didn’t speak to his son. I didn’t speak to any other people that are behind that. I don’t know who they are.

ABC News: Sports,Giants release quarterback Daniel Jones just days after benching him,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/giants-release-quarterback-daniel-jones-days-after-benching-116138874,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 13:30:16 -0500",The Daniel Jones era in New York is over,"The Daniel Jones era in New York is over EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- The Daniel Jones era in New York is over. The Giants quarterback was granted his release on Friday by the team just days after the franchise said it was benching him in favor of third-stringer Tommy DeVito. “Daniel came to see me this morning and asked if we would release him,"" Giants president John Mara said in a statement. “We mutually agreed that would be best for him and for the team. Daniel has been a great representative of our organization, first class in every way.” Mara added he was “disappointed” at the quick dissolution of the team’s relationship with Jones, who signed a four-year $160 million contract in March 2023 after leading the Giants to a playoff berth. “We hold Daniel in high regard and have a great appreciation for him,” Mara continued. “We wish him nothing but the best in the future.” The 27-year-old Jones told reporters Thursday that he gave the team everything he had after being taken sixth overall in the 2019 draft and he believes he still has a future in the NFL. He held himself accountable for the Giants (2-8) making the postseason once in his tenure as the starter. The Duke product took over early in his rookie season when then-coach Pat Shurmur benched two-time Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning, who was near the end of his career. Coach Brian Daboll benched Jones on Monday after the Giants returned to practice following a bye week and a 20-17 overtime loss to Carolina in Germany. Tommy DeVito will start Sunday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, with Daboll hoping he can spark the team. “Definitely not happy about it,” said Jones, who read a 90-second statement before taking questions from reporters. “Yeah, not what you want to hear. So, yeah, all those emotions you have. But at the end of the day, this is football. We’re in a business where you're expected to get results and we weren’t doing it.” Jones, who is now free to sign with any team, went 24-44-1 as a starter in New York after being the sixth overall pick in the 2019 draft. A significant portion of those victories came in 2022, when the Giants went 9-7-1 and beat Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs. Yet whatever forward momentum the club generated in 2022 quickly evaporated in 2023. New York was 1-5 in Jones' six starts during an injury-marred season and he further regressed this fall. Jones completed just 63% of his passes with eight touchdowns and seven interceptions even with dynamic rookie wide receiver Malik Nabers at his disposal. The Giants are last in the NFL in scoring and with public sentiment all but gone for the player once known as “Danny Dimes,” Daboll opted to go in another direction while Jones can get a head start on trying to reboot his career elsewhere. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-22,1,0.47,0.53
ABC News: Sports,"Lionel Messi's former teammate Javier Mascherano close to becoming Inter Miami coach, AP source says",https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/lionel-messis-former-teammate-javier-mascherano-close-becoming-116139493,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 15:14:24 -0500","Lionel Messi is on the cusp of reuniting with former Argentina national teammate Javier Mascherano with Inter Miami, this time as player and coach, a person with knowledge of the negotiations told The Associated Press","Lionel Messi is on the cusp of reuniting with former Argentina national teammate Javier Mascherano with Inter Miami, this time as player and coach, a person with knowledge of the negotiations told The Associated Press Lionel Messi is on the cusp of reuniting with former Argentina national teammate Javier Mascherano with Inter Miami, this time as player and coach, a person with knowledge of the negotiations told The Associated Press on Friday. Multiple reports out of Argentina said Mascherano has already agreed to take over as coach at Inter Miami as the replacement for Gerardo “Tata” Martino — who stepped down citing personal reasons. Mascherano emerged as Inter Miami's frontrunner earlier this week, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because no decision has been revealed by the team. Inter Miami co-owner Jorge Mas said the team had three finalists in mind for the job, then made a pick on the replacement Wednesday — but would not confirm that the deal with Mascherano is done, or that he even was the final selection. “We are very near the end of the process,” Mas said. “We will be announcing a new coach for Inter Miami in the upcoming days."" Messi and Mascherano were teammates both for Argentina and with Barcelona; for the Spanish club, Mascherano also played alongside current Inter Miami standouts Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets and Luis Suarez. Mascherano, at one time, was the all-time leader for Argentina’s national team in international appearances; Messi has since broken that record. Mas said he spoke with Messi last week about the coaching search. It’s not known if Messi played an active role in recruiting Mascherano, who currently is Argentina’s U-20 national coach. “I asked him, 'What is important to you? And what do you think is important to get the best out of our roster and out of our 11 and how do we improve?” Mas said. “And Leo shared with me his thoughts. ... Without a doubt, a familiarity with Leo and the other stars is an advantage in every aspect. Obviously, I want Leo to feel comfortable with the new trainer, with the new coach coming in."" Martino guided Inter Miami to the best regular season record in Major League Soccer history this season. He was hired in July 2023, right around the time that Messi debuted for the club and insisted Friday that he needs to leave for personal reasons. Inter Miami — which won the 2023 Leagues Cup and MLS Supporters Shield this season under Martino — was eliminated in the first round of this year’s MLS Cup playoffs. The team's 2025 season starts with training camp in January. Martino also had deep ties to Messi before coming to Inter Miami; he coached the world's most decorated men's player and eight-time Ballon d'Or winner with Barcelona and Argentina’s national team before reuniting with him in South Florida. Martino said Friday he decided just before the start of the playoffs that he would not be back with Inter Miami next season. “Needless to say, we’ve enjoyed it a lot and I’m grateful for the opportunity, on behalf of my entire coaching staff, to have been able to work at this club,” Martino said Friday in his farewell news conference. “The truth is that it’s been very captivating being part of the change during this year and a half.” Inter Miami was 26-9-12 in MLS regular season matches in the Martino era. The 40-year-old Mascherano also played for five seasons in the Premier League, most of that with Liverpool. He played in the World Cup four times for Argentina — 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018. The new coach — Mascherano or anyone else — will have a very busy first year. Inter Miami has a preseason tour planned in 2025, plus a 34-match MLS regular season and will play in Leagues Cup, the CONCACAF Champions Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. “This is an extremely attractive position for a coach,” Mas said. Messi — MLS' highest-paid player, someone who had a 2 1/2-year deal worth an estimated $150 million in total when he joined Inter Miami — is going into his final guaranteed season with the club. He has an option for 2026, the year that Inter Miami plans to finally move into its Freedom Park complex currently being built near Miami International Airport. “Leo and I will sit and we'll discuss the future,” Mas said. “As I've said before, and I will repeat it now, I fully expect that the opening of our new stadium in 2026 in Miami — and the opening of our '26 season, hopefully after a trophy-laden 2025 season — that Lionel Messi will be our No. 10.” ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-22,1,0.43,0.57

I really don’t care as long as we get the best players, we get the most that we can, I’m happy with whatever,” Judge said Friday, a day after he was a unanimous winner of his second AL MVP award. “That's never been something on my mind about who gets paid the most.” Judge led the major leagues with 58 homers, 144 RBIs and 133 walks while hitting .322 as New York reached the World Series for the first time since 2009, only to lose to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Soto batted .288 with 41 homers, 109 RBIs and 129 walks in his first season with the Yankees and finished third in MVP voting, also trailing Kansas City shortstop Bobby Witt. Jr. A free agent at 26, Soto has met with the Yankees, Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers and Boston Red Sox, and he plans to meet with the Philadelphia Phillies, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the meetings have not been publicly announced. Negotiations are not likely to intensify until after Thanksgiving. Judge hasn’t spoken with Soto since the World Series. Judge went through the free-agent experience after hitting an AL record 62 homers in 2022. “The best thing is to really give those guys space,"" Judge said. ""I talked to him all season and he knows how we feel about him and I think the most important thing is now let him do his thing with his family, pray about it, talk with people and come to the right decision for him and his family.” Soto met with Yankees officials on Monday at a hotel in southern California, a group that included owner Hal Steinbrenner, team president Randy Levine, general manager Brian Cashman, manager Aaron Boone and senior adviser for baseball operations Omar Minaya. “We had a good meeting. It was a very honest back-and-forth dialogue, a couple hours long,” Steinbrenner said Wednesday. Asked how confident he was about keeping Soto, Steinbrenner said: “No idea. We’ll be in the mix. I’ll leave it at that.” Soto and Judge filled the Nos. 2 and 3 slots in the Yankees batting order in a franchise-record 153 games, topping the 145 of Joe Dugan and Babe Ruth in 1923, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. “I get to see a lot of pitches,"" Judge said. ""He's going to be a tough at-bat in front of me. He’s going to wear down the pitcher right there in the first inning, within the first 15 pitches or so. Yeah, I think that was a big impact just having having a guy like that in front of you.  ""If I could have eight Juan Sotos in the lineup with me, I would love that.” After the World Series, Judge spent about a week in Tampa, Florida, where the Yankees hold spring training, and met with Steinbrenner. “We kind of just discussed a lot of things from Juan to other guys that are kind of out there that I think could definitely help this team,:"" Judge said. ""So I kind of just gave my input on a couple things.” Judge said when he agreed to his big deal in late 2022, Steinbrenner wanted to have a deeper relationship. They've been meeting every week or two, and pitcher Gerrit Cole has developed a similar exchange with the owner. “I think just having that relationship to where I can kind of communicate with him about what I’m seeing, what I’m feeling, what I see with the guys, what I see against other guys that we play against,” Judge said. “I think it’s a cool part to where I think just the more communication you have from top to bottom, it just — it makes everybody better.” Judge's contract is baseball's fourth largest behind the deals of the Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani ($700 million), the Los Angeles Angels' Mike Trout ($426.5 million) and the Dodgers' Mookie Betts ($365 million). Judge cited the example of teammate Giancarlo Stanton, whose $325 million deal was the highest when he joined the Yankees ahead of the 2018 season but now ranks tied for ninth. “Even though he signed one of those — the first big mega-contracts back in Miami, once he came here he didn’t care about the highest-paid guy. He just wanted good players around him,” Judge said. In joining Mickey Mantle in 1956 as the Yankees' only unanimous MVPs, Judge credited his teammates. “You look at every single one of my teammates in that room and know that each and every single one of them impacted me in a way that put me in that position,” Judge said. “So it’s always going to be a team award in my book.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-22,0,0.55,0.45

Purdy injured his right shoulder in last Sunday's loss to the Seattle Seahawks. He underwent an MRI on Monday that showed no structural damage and the team initially thought he could play this week.  But when Purdy's shoulder didn't feel right when he made a few warmup throws at practice Thursday, those plans changed. “We thought he just needed some rest and we really weren’t concerned about him not being good this week,” coach Kyle Shanahan said Friday. “But when he started up Thursday, it just surprised him, surprised us how it felt. So we had to shut him down.” Shanahan said the team doesn't believe the injury is a long-term concern but he is uncertain whether Purdy will need to miss any additional time. “The MRI doesn’t look like that, so it should be all right,” Shanahan said. “But the way it responded this week, it’s really up in the air for next week. We’ll have to see on Monday.”  The 49ers also will be missing star defensive end Nick Bosa, who is out after leaving last week's game in the second half with injuries to his left hip and oblique. Left tackle Trent Williams is questionable with an ankle injury and will be a game-time decision.  San Francisco struggled on defense without Bosa last week and now will go the entire game this week without two of the team's most important players.  The Niners (5-5) are currently in a three-way tie for second in the NFC West, a game behind first-place Arizona, and have little margin for error if they want to get back to the playoffs after making it to the Super Bowl last season. “I know it’s disappointing,” Shanahan said. “We knew there was a chance for Nick. I think the guys were a little surprised with Brock yesterday, but we addressed all that today. We’re going to have 48 guys in uniform. I know our guys believe in themselves. I believe in them. We’re missing two good players, definitely. But we got a lot of good players out there. So by no means do we not have a chance to win.” This will be the first time Purdy has missed a start because of an injury since taking over as the 49ers’ quarterback in December 2022. Brandon Allen will start in his place. Purdy has completed 66% of his passes this season for 2,613 yards, 13 TDs, eight interceptions and a 95.9 passer rating that is down significantly from his league-leading mark of 113 in 2023. Allen has been mostly a backup since being drafted by Jacksonville in 2016. Allen last started a game in Week 18 of the 2021 season for Cincinnati and has thrown just three passes the last three seasons — including none since joining San Francisco in 2023. Allen said he preparation hasn't changed this week with the exception of getting to work with the first-team receivers instead of running the scout team.  “It’s an opportunity.” he said. “The circumstances are what they are. But I think our team all year long we’ve been kind of dealing with injuries here and there. It’s been a big next-man-up mentality. It’s definitely an opportunity for me to go out and play well and put our guys in a good position to win the game. Obviously, we want Brock back and healthy and all that. But for the time being, it is an opportunity for me.” Joshua Dobbs will be the backup Sunday. San Francisco also will be without starting cornerback Charvarius Ward, who returned to the team this week following the death of his 1-year-old daughter on Oct. 28 but needs more time to get back up to speed. Punt returner Jacob Cowing (concussion), linebacker Tatum Bethune (knee) and defensive lineman Kevin Givens (groin) are also out. The Packers will also be without two key defensive players with cornerback Jaire Alexander ruled out after leaving last week's game with a knee injury and linebacker Edgerrin Cooper out with an injured hamstring. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-22,0,0.5,0.5
ABC News: Sports,Marta's magic helped get the Pride to Saturday's NWSL title game against the Washington Spirit,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/martas-magic-helped-pride-saturdays-nwsl-title-game-116150088,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 17:54:27 -0500",A goal by Marta helped propel the Orlando Pride into Saturday&rsquo;s National Women&rsquo;s Soccer League championship game against the Washington Spirit,"A goal by Marta helped propel the Orlando Pride into Saturday’s National Women’s Soccer League championship game against the Washington Spirit With technical prowess and considerable style, Marta danced around two sliding defenders, outwitted a goalkeeper and calmly scored as another player rushed forward in desperation to stop her.  It was more Marta Magic. That goal last weekend helped propel the Orlando Pride into Saturday's National Women's Soccer League championship game against the Washington Spirit.  Barbra Banda also scored in the Pride's 3-2 semifinal victory over the Kansas City Current. While Banda has had an incredible first season with the Pride, captain Marta has been the talisman that has helped lead the team in its remarkable turnaround this year.  The last time the Pride were in the NWSL playoffs was in 2017 — Marta's first year with the club. But this season they nearly went undefeated, going 23 games without a loss to start the season before losing 2-0 to the Portland Thorns with just two regular-season games left. “I think because of the way that we did it, during this season, from beginning to now, it’s something very special that I’ve never had before with any other club that I’ve played for,"" Marta said. ""Plus year by year, we see in America, strong competition. This is the best league in the world. And you never know what’s going to happen, and it’s hard to keep winning the games, being in the first place almost like the whole season. That’s why it’s really different and so special.” Marta’s goal was the latest gasp-inducing moment in a stellar career filled with them. Known by just her first name, the 38-year-old is a six-time FIFA world player of the year.  ""Let's see if tomorrow I can do something similar — or even better,"" Marta said on Friday. Her teammate Kylie Strom chimed in: “That was the greatest goal I've ever witnessed, hands down."" Appropriate. Earlier this year, FIFA announced that the best goal in women's soccer each year would earn the Marta Award. In a lighthearted moment the day before the title match, Marta was asked if she thought it was possible she might give the award to herself.  “You guys need to decide, because who votes for the best goal in the year? It’s you. It’s the people in the public. So it should be really interesting, like Marta’s Award goes to Marta!” she said with a laugh.  Marta has played in six World Cups for Brazil and played this summer in her sixth Olympics, winning a silver medal after falling in the final to the United States. She previously said this would be her final year with the national team.  But since then Brazil was named the host of the 2027 Women's World Cup.  ""I had a conversation with my coach, the national team coach, and I was really clear about playing in 2027. I told him it’s not my goal anymore,” she said. “But I’m always available to help the national team. And if they think I still can do something during this preparation for the World Cup, yeah, I would be happy to help them."" Marta's club career started in Brazil when she was just 16. She has also played in Sweden and in the U.S. professional women's leagues that came before the NWSL.  With nine regular-season goals, Marta has had one of her best seasons since she joined the Pride.  “I can never pick a side, I never pick favorites — but I love to see this for Marta,"" U.S. coach Emma Hayes said. “Marta is someone we all like, admire and are grateful for. And that goal was just like prime Marta at her best. And so grateful for and thankful for her that she got the opportunity with another game with her team.” The Pride went 18-2-6 this season, clinching the NWSL Shield for the first trophy in club history. Orlando also set a record with 60 regular-season points to finish atop the standings.  “We are sitting top of the table, but I think there still are a lot of doubters. I think there’s people out there who say, maybe this was a one-off season,” Strom said. “But we’re here to prove them all wrong. So I think we do carry a bit of that underdog mentality still with us.” The second-seeded Spirit advanced to the title match at Kansas City's CPKC Stadium last weekend on a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw against defending champions Gotham FC.  The Spirit's roster includes Trinity Rodman, a standout forward who formed the so-called “Triple Espresso” trio with Mallory Swanson and Sophia Smith for the United States at the Olympics.  ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-22,0,0.56,0.44

Advertisement “Daniel has been a great representative of our organization, first class in every way. His handling of this situation yesterday exemplifies just that. We are all disappointed in how things have worked out. We hold Daniel in high regard and have a great appreciation for him. We wish him nothing but the best in the future.” Brian Daboll met with #giants team and informed them of Daniel Jones release before it went public and before today’s practice “This is not an easy thing” pic.twitter.com/fmM3wcrWo7 — Charlotte Carroll (@charlottecrrll) November 22, 2024  Jones, in his sixth season with the Giants after the team drafted him No. 6 overall in 2019, was benched Monday following the Giants’ 2-8 start to the season, during which he completed 63.3 percent of his passes for 2,070 yards, eight touchdowns and seven interceptions through 10 games. GO DEEPER Giants benching QB Daniel Jones, Tommy DeVito taking over as starter The 27-year-old quarterback has played in 70 games for New York the past six seasons, throwing for 14,582 yards with 70 touchdowns and 47 interceptions and tallying a 64.1 completion percentage. Jones seemed to foreshadow his release when he spoke with reporters following Thursday’s practice. “The opportunity to play for the New York Giants was truly a dream come true. I’m extremely grateful to the Mara and Tisch families for the chance to play here,” he said. “No one wanted to win more games worse than me. I gave everything I had on the field and in preparation. Of course, this season has been disappointing for all and, of course, I wish I could have done more. I’m 100% accountable for my part. I did not play well enough, consistently enough to help the team get (good) results.” GO DEEPER Giants QB Daniel Jones addresses benching, bids farewell to fans Jones will go on waivers following his release and is unlikely to be claimed by another team with $13.8 million of guaranteed money remaining on his contract. Jones signed a four-year, $160 million extension with the Giants ahead of the 2023 season. To answer the most common questions I’m seeing:  • No impact on the Giants’ cap whether they released him now or after the season.  • Jones can sign with another team immediately after he clears waivers (he’ll clear waivers). — Dan Duggan (@DDuggan21) November 22, 2024  Players who clear waivers become free agents, and Jones could have some intriguing options once he hits the open market. He could try to sign on with a playoff-caliber team in need of a quality backup. He also could try to go to a place where he might have a chance to start again this year (Jacksonville?). Or perhaps he’ll seek out a team where he could “audition” to be the team’s quarterback in 2025 (Las Vegas?). Of course, Jones could also choose to take some time away from football before picking his next destination this offseason. Cowboys EVP Stephen Jones said on @SASportsStar that they have no interest in adding former Giants QB Daniel Jones. “No, I think we’re in good shape at our quarterback spot. We think Cooper (Rush) gives us the best chance to win right now. And certainly we still want to see… — Jon Machota (@jonmachota) November 22, 2024  The Giants, who have lost their past five games, host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 12 and will move forward with a new starter at quarterback. Giants coach Brian Daboll announced Monday, after the team’s Week 11 bye, the Giants would make a change and will start Tommy DeVito on Sunday. “After evaluating and watching a lot of tape, that’s the reason we are going with Tommy,” Daboll said. “Drew Lock will be the backup. This was a necessary move for us, and I’m looking forward to working with Tommy, and he’ll be ready to go against Tampa Bay.” Advertisement My read on Daniel Jones’ release: It’s mutually beneficial, but the Giants weren’t going to make the first move. If Jones was fine showing up every day and going through the motions as QB4, they would have gone along with that. But once he asked out, they (obviously) were going to grant that wish. — Dan Duggan, Giants beat writer GO DEEPER Is Daniel Jones now QB4 on Giants depth chart? Drew Lock 'upset' he wasn't named starter Both the Giants and Jones will get a much-needed fresh start with the QB’s release. The Giants will close out the season with DeVito and Lock, but the focus now shifts to who will be the next face of the franchise. Right now, the Giants are No. 3 in the NFL Draft, per Tankathon. For now, there are three other two-win teams. The Giants would never openly tank, but in what’s supposed to be a less top-heavy QB draft, higher draft order could be paramount in finding Jones’ successor. While New York moves on, Jones finally can, too. When asked Thursday about the possibility of being released and playing with another team before season’s end, Jones said he was still focused on the Giants. He said he was “still processing and trying to think through what the best thing is for this team and what the best thing is for me.” If Daniel Jones is not claimed, a team could sign him after 4 PM on Monday. A more realistic scenario would be signing him on Tuesday or Wednesday.  He could also wait for a QB desperate team to bring him on. — Dianna Russini (@DMRussini) November 22, 2024  But now, the reality is Jones could play elsewhere. The question is, will he decide to do that and with which team? Some of the teams floating around social media that present the most intriguing options since they’re on the Giants’ remaining schedule: the Dallas Cowboys (Dak Prescott is out for the year and backup Cooper Rush has been struggling) and the Philadelphia Eagles (final game of the year where starters could potentially sit as the Eagles go on a playoff hunt). There are obviously other potential pairings, but those two present the most Shakespearean twists. — Charlotte Carroll, Giants beat writer Advertisement There is no impact for the Giants by releasing Jones now or after the season, since they’ll have plenty of cap space in 2025. The only possible cap impacts would be if the Giants waited until post-June 1 to make a cut, as The Athletic’s Dan Duggan noted. By doing so, the team would push $11.1 million in dead money to 2026. But the Giants wouldn’t have been able to spend that money until June, meaning they couldn’t have used those extra dollars in free agency when they matters most. Instead, the full $22.2 million in dead money goes into the 2025 cap year.

NYT > Sports,"While Formula 1 Thrives in Las Vegas, Small Businesses Feel the Strain",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938951/2024/11/22/f1-vegas-local-business-lawsuit-disruption/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:01:59 +0000",The construction of the circuit necessitates traffic restrictions and outright road closures that create significant gridlock throughout the city.,"Formula 1 LAS VEGAS — Jay’s Market On Flamingo is a corner gas station like so many others in and around Las Vegas, offering a little bit of everything. That it happens to be situated at the intersection of two of Las Vegas’ busiest roads makes it a convenient stop for out-of-towners needing supplies as they head in or out of the city. Advertisement However, in the past two Novembers, that convenience has been interrupted by the construction of the Las Vegas Grand Prix Formula One circuit incorporating 3.8 miles of city streets, necessitating traffic restrictions and outright road closures that create significant gridlock throughout the city. For Wade Bohn, the owner of Jay’s Market, located where Flamingo Road and Koval Lane cross, the congestion isn’t just a traffic nightmare but also a financial nightmare. His store is along the straightaway between Turns 4 and 5. “When I have no control over my business, succeeding or failing, yeah, I’m frustrated,” Bohn said. “I have no control. Literally, no control. For 13 years, I’ve had control of my business, been very profitable, made a great living for me and my employees. F1 comes to town, literally no business. It’s unbelievable and frustrating. “I can’t sleep at night.” As Bohn spoke, his anger was conveyed with his words, a quivering top lip and piercing blue eyes. He explained how the Las Vegas Grand Prix threatens his livelihood. In November 2022, the last time F1 didn’t race here, Jay’s Market had $628,000 in gross sales, Bohn said. The following year, however, sales in November fell considerably. As of this writing, he’s at $144,000 for this month. Overall, taking into account all the construction, road closures, snarled traffic and the closing of a sub shop that rented space inside the store at $4,000 a month, Bohn says he lost $3.4 million year-to-year from 2022 to 2023. And this year will be even worse. The culprit is mostly due to a race that Bohn and many other business owners in the area do not want to continue beyond this year, arguing that doing so will likely push them beyond their economic means. Already, Bohn has had to reduce his workforce by half and has started looking for a second job to help supplement his income. Advertisement “If there’s a fourth year (of the Las Vegas Grand Prix in 2026) I will bank on it that I will go into bankruptcy and lose my business,” Bohn said. “I am currently looking for work right now. Me, the owner, I need a job. I need to make money. I’m not making any money. It’s terrible.” Four lawsuits have been filed against Clark County by local business owners, including Bohn, seeking financial damages for negatively impacting their businesses. The Las Vegas Grand Prix declined comment related to any ongoing litigation. “We’re not like New York City where most everybody kind of lives in New York and where you can walk to work,” Lisa Mayo-DeRiso, a spokesperson for one group of business owners suing the county, told The Athletic. “Here, we have to drive to work or take the bus to work. People are having an hour to two hours to three hours a day extra to get to work and to get home. And F1 is not compensating anybody for those extra hours, babysitting time, time in your car, lost hours, lost time. They’re not compensating anybody for anything. They don’t believe that they should have to. “Our businesses have lost money.” Race organizers and Clark County have made considerable efforts to lessen the burden on local businesses, Lori Nelson-Kraft, senior vice president of corporate affairs for the Las Vegas Grand Prix, told The Athletic. Construction of the circuit for this year’s race was shorter than a year ago by 65 percent. And as much as possible, construction was done overnight to minimize disruption during busier hours. Representatives for the race have also met with local business owners, including Bohn, and they say they’re receptive to ideas that would further help the community. “We have adjusted plans based on that feedback,” Nelson-Kraft said. “So any of those businesses that participate have been able to have those forums to share that information and they are always included.” Advertisement One idea conceived to help ease traffic congestion was reducing the temporary bridge on Flamingo Road over Koval Lane from the four lanes it was last year to two. That bridge went up in October. “A lot of improvements have been made, and I will say that the restaurants that are in and around the circuit, specifically in that corridor, I have personally eaten at since the vehicular bridge has gone in,” Nelson-Kraft said. “And, anecdotally, while eating in that area there with my husband, I had conversations with their staff where they have shared with me, just as a guest of their venues, that they have seen remarkable improvements over last year.” According to Bohn, though, the bridge has yet to help. Instead, it effectively placed a wall around his store. Traffic flow is further backed to where even regular customers are deterred from stopping. At another small business in the area, a clerk (who asked not to be identified) took off his glasses and rubbed his temple when asked about the bridge. He followed by letting out an exasperated sigh, dropping an f-bomb and saying he didn’t have a comment other than to refer to the bridge by the derisive nickname used by some locals: “The Bridge to Bankruptcy.” “F1 tells me this is going to help me, but it looks like a three-story prison that’s covered in black tarp,” Bohn said. “There’s no access to my property from Koval, it’s completely shut off. I sit on a corner that has two access points when F1 is not here. I only have one when they’re here. When they’re here, it’s bad.” Said Mayo-DeRiso: “They put up that stupid bridge that cuts traffic. It absolutely impedes the flow of traffic.” Ideally, critics of the race would prefer the Las Vegas Grand Prix shift outside the city so that throughways no longer require being shut down. But the likelihood that Formula One would be willing to run on a circuit other than one that sees drivers speed down the Strip is a longshot, at best. The city and F1 have a 10-year contract. Advertisement According to Nelson-Kraft, last year’s inaugural grand prix had a $1.5 billion economic impact on the city. That figure outperformed expectations and the Super Bowl Las Vegas hosted in February, which generated $1 billion. Tax revenue from the race brought in $77 million, the most in Las Vegas history. Revenue projections for this year’s grand prix are lower than the 2023 edition, though they’re expected to remain robust. What that exact figure is won’t be known until weeks and months after Saturday night’s race. Three hundred thousand attendees are expected to turn through the gates across the three-day race weekend. “We are a tourism-driven economy, we are dependent on 150,000 plus hotel rooms filling up,” Nelson-Kraft said. “Special events are one of the big ways that we do it. And nobody hosts big events better than Las Vegas.” Standing in front of a drink cooler inside his store, Bohn wonders where all that money is going. None of it is being directed towards him, he said, while his bills continue to pile up due to an event he views as an unnecessary burden. “The s— pile keeps building up,” Bohn said. “I need this to go away. This nightmare goes away, I will sleep better.” (Top photo of Jay’s Market owner Wade Bohn: K.M.

NYT > Sports,How Michele Kang Became One of the Biggest Investors in Women’s Soccer,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940050/2024/11/22/michele-kang-womens-soccer-investment/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:01:59 +0000",The businesswoman invested $30 million in U.S. Soccer for the development of the women’s game. But that’s only part of her journey.,"NWSL In a Parisian café, amid the excitement of the Summer Olympics, businesswoman Michele Kang sat down for breakfast with U.S. Soccer CEO J.T. Batson. The two were scheduled to meet for an hour between the U.S. women’s national team’s semifinal win and its eventual gold medal victory over Brazil. While they had met before, they had never spoken at length. Advertisement Three hours later, the two were still there, not just talking, but in the weeds on big, foundational ideas around the women’s program. When they finally parted ways, they left with the seed of an idea that would eventually turn into the second-largest donation U.S. Soccer has received. On Tuesday, U.S. Soccer announced Kang — majority owner of the Washington Spirit, Olympique Lyonnais Féminin and London City Lionesses under her global multi-club organization Kynisca — was donating $30million (£24m). The funds are earmarked over the next five years for women’s youth national team camps, talent identification and scouting, and female coach and referee education and mentorship. GO DEEPER Spirit owner Kang pledges $30million into women's soccer programs “I had a lot of coffee,” Kang deadpanned when asked about that Paris breakfast during an interview following Tuesday’s press conference in New York City. “Michele started asking really good, insightful questions on things and ultimately got to some core issues,” Batson told The Athletic. Kang wanted to know how U.S. Soccer was thinking at a federation-wide level and Batson walked her through the long-term vision, even if that vision didn’t have secured funding and resources attached yet. These questions had been on Kang’s mind for years since she gained majority ownership of the Spirit in 2022. She knew the NWSL would need more coaches and more referees with expansion and more games. She could see the lack of technical staff at the youth levels around D.C., too. “While the professional league and professional teams’ trajectory and investments are great, it could be really temporary if we don’t have all these underlying foundational blocks,” she said. It wasn’t just the investment that needed to happen, it was attention — but that wasn’t on her alone or the NWSL. When the breakfast meeting in Paris happened, Kang had finally found an avenue for those ambitions. Advertisement “We geeked out for a few hours on what the mission-critical, core-enabling functions that we’re going to need for soccer in this country, and women’s soccer in particular, to be the best in the world,” Batson continued. “And everything led from there.” While Tuesday’s announcement earned its fair share of attention, the eye-popping investment is to be used in areas of U.S. Soccer that don’t get a lot of shine and certainly won’t get a lot of headlines over the next five years as the work is carried out. That was a motivation for Kang in many ways — this isn’t for splashy projects, such as the national training center. “It is equally — potentially more — critical that we have all the systems in place. Because if you don’t have the coaches, if you don’t have the referees, it just doesn’t work,” she said. “That’s why I felt it was important that not only I personally believe in it, but I wanted to bring attention to these issues, hoping that more people will join in and invest in it.” Kang is not one to accept things as final. “I hate following any convention if they say, ‘You’re not supposed to do it.’ I always asked why it wasn’t acceptable. So unless I understood the rationale, I wouldn’t do it,” she told The Athletic in an interview conducted in May 2022, shortly after she became the majority owner of the Washington Spirit. “So in that society where young people, especially kids, are supposed to follow the rules, I was a problem child.” Growing up as the youngest of three girls in South Korea, Kang was more curious than rebellious, always asking why. Her mother was called to her school multiple times, not because Kang was causing trouble — she was a top student — but because she would question teachers, rules and expectations. Kang’s parents had been waiting for a boy who could carry the family name. She arrived instead. She has credited her father for instilling a sense of equality and possibility in her from the beginning. He was a professor, one of the first Koreans after the Second World War who earned a U.S. government scholarship to study in America, which also meant he didn’t serve in the Korean War. Advertisement Kang was a self-described tomboy growing up. She played sports, a lot of them. Basketball was her favorite. In elementary school, she was the second tallest kid in her class. “I was going to be a basketball player, but I found out there was somebody the same age as me who played basketball in another school. She was already 6ft 2in and I said, ‘Well, I’m never going to be number one, forget it,’” Kang recalled. She played soccer and volleyball, but tennis became her primary sport before the need to study won out. Kang planned to earn her college degree at home. While her father had studied abroad in America, her parents wanted her to graduate from a Korean college to help preserve her cultural identity. She started at a co-ed college of economics, but she was the only woman enrolled. Things in South Korea were also tumultuous at the time. President Park Chung-hee was assassinated in 1979, followed by a coup led by General Chun Doo-hwan. Chun arrested his political opponents and limited political opposition. Martial law was put in place and student-led protests were violently suppressed. “The country was in turmoil. Campuses were shut down because typically, students were at the forefront of the demonstrations,” she said. Her parents were worried that if Kang was involved in those demonstrations, or arrested, it would be the end of her life as she knew it. So she devised a plan. Her parents would eventually be responsible for a dowry if she married. Instead, she told them, “When I get married, you don’t need to spend a dime. Just give me a fraction of that money so that I can pay my tuition, just one year, as a college student.” While she believed her parents would have usually said no — they had to borrow money to pay for that year of tuition — the worry over her future amid the demonstrations and dangerous political unrest got her a yes. Advertisement “I guess you could say that was my first business deal,” she said with a smile. When she got to the University of Chicago in 1981, she thrived. She turned one year into two, working in the summer as a waitress and adding a second job at the library once the semester rolled around. “There was a sitcom, ‘Cheers,’” she said. “The song, ‘You want to go where everybody knows your name’ — I wanted to go where no one knew my name because of where I grew up. With my father as a professor, I was always so and so’s daughter, so and so’s granddaughter. I absolutely hated it. I really wanted to go somewhere where no one knew who I was. If I fail, I fail, but at least it’s going to be on me as opposed to getting any special treatment.” She loved the school, loved the feel of the campus and the quad that reminded her of Oxford University. She would walk back and forth, believing she’d get smarter by absorbing the energy of the place. She went to graduate school at Yale School of Management. Coming out of her MBA, Kang said she had three 10-year plans. In the first 10, she wanted to go into consulting because the project-based nature of the work appealed to her. One day it would be supply chains, the next branding, the day after that telecommunications or manufacturing. She wanted to learn how every element of a business works. The next 10 years, even though she hated the concept, she would go to a Fortune 500 company to learn the organizational part of being in the business world and to acquire leadership skills. “At the end of the day, business is not about how smart you are, how many functional capabilities or the expertise you have, it’s about organization,” Kang said. “How do you get people below you, sideways from you, above you, how do you get them to do what you need them to do? How can you get them to work with you to accomplish common goals?” And in the third decade, she was going to become a Fortune 500 CEO. Advertisement “That’s also why I left Korea, right?” Kang said. “I could have gotten my business career going, but I wanted to try in a bigger pond.” In the end, instead of becoming a CEO, she started her own company, Cognoscente — a healthcare technology company — in 2008. She effectively did what she set out to do, even if she didn’t nail her own timeline. Kang had a plan for the fourth decade, too: giving back and public service. And in 2019, she found women’s soccer. After the U.S. won the 2019 Women’s World Cup, while also fighting for equal pay, there was a reception for the team on Capitol Hill. Tom Daschle, the former Democratic senator from South Dakota, who also served on the Cognoscente board, invited Kang. Daschle would eventually join the Spirit investor group a couple of years later, under the team’s previous ownership. “To tell you the truth, I didn’t know there was a professional league in this country,” Kang told The Athletic in 2022. “In part because my life had been all about work. I didn’t have time to do anything else.” She met Steve Baldwin, then the majority owner of the Spirit, at the reception, along with players and fellow potential investors. By December 2020, she joined as a minority investor with a 35 percent stake in the team. The soccer part was nice, but what appealed to her most was having a hands-on impact on women’s empowerment, especially around pay and equity issues. Four things had helped her through her journey, she said: “Dignity of work, dignity of self, independence and being able to get the same opportunity.” With women’s soccer, she could provide opportunities. But the path to becoming the first woman of color to own a majority stake in the NWSL was not straightforward. In 2021, negotiations for her to gain a controlling stake of the Spirit turned sour between her, Baldwin, and the other primary investor, Bill Lynch. When she made a $35million offer to buy the Spirit in December of that year, it was unheard of for the league. The expansion fee for the Kansas City Current had been a mere $5million; the sale of the majority stake of the Seattle Reign to Lyon in 2019 had been completed at a valuation of $3.51million. Advertisement Those numbers seem quaint now, but the astronomical rise in NWSL team valuations wouldn’t have happened in the same way without that first $35million offer from Kang. Over the past couple of years, her international ambitions came to fruition via a global multi-club organization. It started with a majority stake in Lyon’s women’s team, one of the best European club teams with regular Champions League appearances. Then she snapped up one of the few independent clubs in the top two flights of the English soccer pyramid, the London City Lionesses. The formal announcement of the multi-club organization came this summer, with Kynisca announcing its name and an “innovation hub” focused on the health and performance of women athletes, billed to be the largest of its kind. Kang, via Kynisca, also led a $2million investment in Ida Sports, which designs cleats and shoes for female players, and invested in media company Just Women’s Sports. She also joined the investor group that bought the Baltimore Orioles earlier this year at a $1.725billion valuation. Kang has also branched into other women’s sports with another deal that happened at the Paris Olympics, donating $4million over the next four years to USA Rugby to support the women’s sevens team leading into the 2028 Olympics. USA Rugby called her donation “transformative.” That deal came together even faster than the one with U.S. Soccer. Kang walked into the sold-out Stade de France, surprised by the atmosphere. She ended up next to the chair of USA Rugby and they struck up a conversation. “It was literally the most expensive game I’ve ever been to,” Kang joked Tuesday. “I really did not expect to do that. But I just felt that (the team is) so talented that they should not be deprived of investment and just like what I’ve been trying to do in my own small way, bring attention and hope people begin to see it, and more people will join.”     A post shared by Washington Spirit (@washingtonspirit)  That’s the way Kang usually talks about her larger projects: as some small way of changing the game. But for all the praise she gets, there are still skeptics of her motives and her methods — especially the multi-club model. She’s addressed at least one of those critiques head-on. “I am fully aware of the negative connotation of multi-club (ownership), especially on the men’s side,” Kang said following her purchase of London City. “I will submit to you that on the women’s side, multi-club is a necessity, not luxury or greed. Because we need to invest to professionalize women’s football to the level that they deserve and the potential that women’s football has. We need to invest. Because of the lack of media dollars, there isn’t that much money to invest.” Advertisement After Tuesday’s $30million announcement, it’s harder for critics to accuse Kang of acting in bad faith. Still, she has the edge of ruthlessness regarding business; she wants to make money at this. It’s never been a charity. Instead, she saw an opening and was among the first to leap. She also knows there are risks. Kang doesn’t believe in guaranteed outcomes, just opportunities. “This is a tipping point. Once it happens, it’s on its own trajectory. You can’t stop it,” she said Tuesday. “But we have to make sure we’re investing in the right things at the right time. Otherwise, this could fall apart.” One of those investments is doing just fine. After going to New York City to announce her U.S. Soccer donation, Kang headed to Kansas City to watch her first team, the Spirit, vie for the NWSL championship against the top-seeded Orlando Pride on Saturday night. She’s feeling the nerves, especially after two late winning goals in the playoffs at a sold-out Audi Field. “I kept telling the players after the quarterfinal and the semifinal that at this rate, I don’t think I’m going to live out my natural life span,” Kang said laughing. “I only have one heart.” Pablo Maurer contributed to this report.

NYT > Sports,N.F.L. Flexes First Game Into ‘Thursday Night Football’ Slot,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940748/2024/11/22/broncos-vs-chargers-tnf-flex-week-16/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:01:59 +0000",The Denver Broncos’ Week 16 matchup at the Los Angeles Chargers has been moved into prime time on December 19.,"NFL By Nick Kosmider, Daniel Popper and Zac Jackson The NFL has flexed a game into a “Thursday Night Football” for the first time, moving the Denver Broncos’ Week 16 matchup at the Los Angeles Chargers into prime time on Dec. 19. The two teams, led by former Oregon quarterbacks Bo Nix and Justin Herbert, were originally set to play on Sunday afternoon, Dec. 22. The Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals game that was originally slated for Thursday night will now be played that Sunday at 1 p.m. ET on Fox. GO DEEPER Broncos' biggest turnaround this side of Bo Nix: A run defense with real bite NFL owners approved a rule change in 2023 that allowed games to be flexed into a Thursday slot between Weeks 13 and 17, with such moves requiring a four-week notice. The matchup means the Broncos will now play two prime-time games in December, the first coming against the Browns on “Monday Night Football” in Week 13. The matchup against the Chargers will give a national audience a look at Nix, who won the AFC Offensive Player of the Week award following his four-touchdown performance in a Week 11 rout of the Atlanta Falcons. Advertisement The Chargers, meanwhile, have won five out of their last six games under first-year head coach Jim Harbaugh — the first of those coming in a Week 6 win against the Broncos — and remain in the hunt for the AFC West title. The Broncos, who already played a Thursday night road game earlier this season against the New Orleans Saints, had to OK being flexed since this will be their second road Thursday night game of the season. They are embracing the switch, in part, because it will give them extended rest heading into a pivotal Week 17 road game against the Bengals. “We’d rather be flexed in than flexed out,” said Broncos coach Sean Payton. “It’s a real good team that is playing real good (football). And it flexes Cincinnati out, who we play the next week, so there is a little (rest consideration). It is what it is.” Payton said his 2006 Saints team was the first one to flexed into a Sunday night matchup, against the Dallas Cowboys, but he downplayed the history of being the first team flexed into a Thursday slot. “It’s all good,” he said. “Just tell us when we’re playing.” The Chargers have now been flexed into prime time for the second time this season. Their Week 11 matchup with the Bengals was moved from Sunday afternoon to Sunday night. That ended up being an epic game, with the Bengals erasing a 21-point second-half deficit before the Chargers pulled it out late on Herbert’s 15th career game-winning drive. GO DEEPER Justin Herbert paces Chargers in 23-16 win vs. Broncos: Takeaways The Chargers are interesting. The Chargers are exciting. They are good for business. And now, they will be playing four prime-time games in a six-week stretch, starting with last week’s Bengals game. They host the Baltimore Ravens on Monday night in Week 12. They play at the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday night in Week 14. — Daniel Popper, Chargers beat writer
 Advertisement Nix had a slow start to the season, throwing only one touchdown and four interceptions across his first four games. Since then, he’s arguably been the best rookie quarterback in the NFL (13 touchdowns, two interceptions), putting him firmly alongside players like Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels and Las Vegas Raiders tight end Brock Bowers in the Rookie of the Year race. The “Thursday Night Football” stage will give Nix the opportunity to make a major statement. This will be the third matchup between Nix and Herbert, including a college clash in 2019, when Herbert was at Oregon and Nix was a true freshman starter at Auburn. Nix led a late touchdown drive to win that game at AT&T Stadium in Dallas. Herbert came out on top in Week 6 this season. — Nick Kosmider, Broncos beat writer The Bengals aren’t out of contention yet, but from a playoff appeal standpoint, the move makes sense. The Bengals are probably disappointed because the home team has won nine straight AFC North Thursday night games dating back to 2015, a streak the Browns extended with their upset of the Steelers Thursday night. The Browns now could be looking at back-to-back flex situations; they’re currently scheduled to host Miami on Sunday night in Week 17. — Zac Jackson, Browns beat writer (Photo: Dustin Bradford / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,Conference Championship and College Football Playoff Implications Dominate Week 13,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938781/2024/11/22/college-football-schedule-week-13-top-games/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:01:59 +0000",Two weeks remain in the regular season. These are the top games to watch.,"NCAAF With two weeks remaining in the regular season, the schedule is brimming with conference championship and College Football Playoff implications, including undefeated underdogs, a crowded SEC race, potential chaos in the Big 12 and a top-five Big Ten clash between Indiana and Ohio State. Let’s rank the top 10 games of Week 12, starting with honorable mentions and counting down. Advertisement Honorable Mention: No. 24 UNLV at San Jose State (Fri.), No. 25 Illinois at Rutgers, Sam Houston at Jacksonville State, Western Kentucky at Liberty, Kentucky at No. 3 Texas, Wisconsin at Nebraska, Washington State at Oregon State, No. 22 Iowa State at Utah. (All point spreads come from BetMGM; click here for live odds. All kickoff times are Eastern and on Saturday unless otherwise noted.) This is a sneaky significant game in the CFP race. UNLV is 24th in the CFP rankings, but Colorado State is above the Rebels in the Mountain West standings at 5-0 and in second place behind No. 12 Boise State. The Broncos, who are currently projected into a top-four seed and first-round bye in the Playoff bracket, could benefit from another win against a ranked UNLV in the Mountain West championship, but CSU controls UNLV’s odds to get there. Margins are thin: Boise State facing the unranked Rams instead of the ranked Rebels could be the difference between a first-round road trip and first-round bye, depending on how things play out in the ACC and Big 12. Before we can get to any of that, Colorado State is a road underdog at Fresno. Line: Fresno State -3.5 The Mustangs can lock up a spot in the ACC championship game with one win over the next two weeks. Miami, which hosts Wake Forest, needs to win out, with Clemson lurking and hoping for a stumble or two. Odds are that SMU will win its way into the conference championship, but the CFP jockeying is a factor as well. The Mustangs are currently just outside the 12-team field, and will need to win out the regular season in convincing fashion — and maybe see a couple of two-loss SEC teams slip up? — if they want to maintain any chance at an at-large spot. Advertisement Line: SMU -9.5 Penn State has lost its last two trips to Minnesota, including in 2019 when the Nittany Lions were also fourth in the CFP rankings. While still mathematically alive in the Big Ten race, it’s doubtful Penn State will sneak into the conference championship. It also has a rather pedestrian resume despite its top-four ranking — hooray helmet bias! — and may not be able to hang in the Playoff picture with a second loss. The mercurial Gophers, who had won four in a row before a recent loss to Rutgers, will try to test that theorem in a semi-rivalry matchup with a forgotten trophy. Line: Penn State -11.5  The Rebels’ chances of reaching the SEC championship are minuscule, but Ole Miss is sitting pretty in the CFP standings and is in line for an at-large bid if it can avoid a third loss over the next two weeks. Quarterback Jaxson Dart is 373 yards shy of eclipsing Eli Manning as Ole Miss’s career passing leader and could set the record with a big day against the Gators. But Florida is fresh off a nice upset of LSU despite being out-possessed by the Tigers 41:43 to 18:17. After suffering weeks of Billy Napier hot-seat drama, the Gators are one win away from reaching bowl eligibility and can shake up the Playoff race with another upset on Saturday. Line: Ole Miss -10 It’s been quite the ride for Alabama, between the wild win over Georgia, losses to Vanderbilt and Tennessee, and then resounding wins over Missouri and LSU. After all that, the Tide are well-positioned to reach the SEC championship in Kalen DeBoer’s first season at the helm, with the Sooners on the road and the Iron Bowl in Tuscaloosa left on the schedule. Advertisement Entering the weekend, winning out doesn’t guarantee Bama a spot in the title game, but that’s the most likely destination. The Sooners have a top-20 defense at 4.8 yards per play allowed, so we’ll see if an Oklahoma team that’s lost four straight to FBS opponents can slow down Alabama and quarterback Jalen Milroe, who has 32 total touchdowns for the season. Line: Alabama -13.5 The Aggies, who haven’t even appeared in a conference championship since winning the Big 12 back in 1998, fully control their own destiny in the SEC with two games remaining. Next week at home against Texas is the big one, but A&M can’t get caught looking past a disappointing Auburn team that is less than a field-goal underdog on its own field. Texas A&M appears to be sticking with redshirt freshman Marcel Reed at quarterback, who has struggled at times as a passer but is a dangerous runner. Line: Texas A&M -2.5 All that attention on Colorado and head coach Deion Sanders last year and to start this season, and yet it now feels as if this team is underappreciated. The Buffs have won four in a row and seven of their last eight, making them another team that controls its own fate in the conference standings. If Colorado wins out, it’s going to the Big 12 championship, where a victory would send the program to the CFP. That’s a long way from 4-8 and dead last in the Pac-12 a season ago. First up is a trip to Arrowhead Stadium against a Kansas squad that fought back from a dreadful start to play Big 12 spoiler, toppling Iowa State and then-undefeated BYU in its last two games. The Jayhawks are eliminated from the Big 12 race but can still reach bowl eligibility and spark some additional turmoil in the process. Line: Colorado -3 Advertisement Army is one of three remaining undefeated teams in FBS, and a potential Playoff disruptor out of the AAC if it can remain unbeaten, including a nonconference upset of Notre Dame. That will be a tough task against the sixth-ranked Irish, who knocked off service academy Navy a few weeks ago in a 51-14 blowout. The Army-Notre Dame rivalry, which dates to 1913, “returns” to Yankee Stadium for the first time since 2010 — where it was played in Old Yankee Stadium for many years. The most recent meeting was at the Alamodome in San Antonio in 2016, a 44–6 victory for Notre Dame and part of a 15-game win streak over Army that stretches to 1965. The Irish can’t afford another loss if they want to stay in Playoff contention, and will need their top-five defense to shut down Army’s triple option, which accounts for the nation’s top rushing offense (334.9 yards per game). Line: Notre Dame -14.5 The Big 12’s chaos narrative has become cliche at this point, yet nobody had this one circled as the league’s game of the year entering the season. A BYU program that won five games in 2023 and was picked near the bottom of the league, against an Arizona State team that was picked dead-last out of 16 schools, facing off in late November with a spot in the Big 12 championship essentially up for grabs. The league’s title race and Playoff scenarios are a little murky after BYU dropped from No. 6 to No. 14 in the rankings following last week’s loss, but the Cougars have a physical defense and do-or-die offense. It should make for a fun battle against the assertive (and favored) Sun Devils led by human wrecking ball Cam Skattebo at running back. Line: Arizona State -3 College football is ruthless. For whatever reason, the conversation on Indiana shifted from feel-good story of the season to possible Playoff fraud in a matter of days. It’s gone from “Can anyone beat Indiana?” to “Who has Indiana beaten?” Whether you’re a Hoosier hater or believer, we’re about to get an answer. Undefeated IU travels to Ohio State for yet another top-five showdown, with the winner well on its way to facing Oregon in the Big Ten championship and a lock for the CFP. The Hoosiers have ripped off a dominant 10-game run, but much of it came against the bottom of the Big Ten standings. Now they’re heavy underdogs against the second-ranked Buckeyes, and Indiana’s resume is arguably weak enough to knock the Hoosiers out of the 12-team Playoff picture with a loss. Or Indiana could prove the doubters wrong and put Ohio State — and its depleted offensive line — on the bubble. Either way, it’s a matchup between two of the top teams in the sport that will have massive postseason ramifications. That’s a conversation worth having.

NYT > Sports,The Steelers Have 2 Quarterbacks and Too Many Unanswered Questions,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5939916/2024/11/22/russell-wilson-justin-fields-steelers-browns/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:01:59 +0000","Even beyond the negative plays, Pittsburgh’s offense has become too boom or bust, a columnist for The Athletic writes.","NFL CLEVELAND — As the flakes tumbled from the night sky, turning Huntington Bank Field into a snow globe, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Russell Wilson dropped back and let it fly. The pass, thrown with anticipation, found receiver Calvin Austin III on time and on target in the end zone for the go-ahead, 23-yard touchdown. After failing to score a touchdown for more than seven consecutive quarters dating to Week 10 against the Washington Commanders, Pittsburgh had scored two in less than two minutes to take a one-point lead over the Cleveland Browns with 6:15 remaining. .@DangeRussWilson ➡️ @CalvinAustinIII for six!!!! 📲 Stream on NFL+: https://t.co/COxKRnr6Mc pic.twitter.com/ucLP4kE2cM — Pittsburgh Steelers (@steelers) November 22, 2024  It was a miraculous comeback. Until it wasn’t. “The game is never won until you get on the bus,” Austin said after the game. “So it was definitely an emotional moment (after the touchdown). We were all hype and stuff. But we knew we had an inspired team that was about to get the ball back.” As it turned out, the Browns got the ball back not once, but twice. Advertisement The Steelers’ defense did its job the first time, forcing backup quarterback Jameis Winston into an errant pass that cornerback Donte Jackson intercepted with 4:22 to go. But after Pittsburgh went three-and-out — with Justin Fields in for Wilson at quarterback on second and third down — and Corliss Waitman shanked a punt for the first time as a Steeler, the defense couldn’t get off the field again. Cleveland got the ball back with 3:22 remaining and drove 45 yards in nine plays. The Browns capped the sequence with a 2-yard Nick Chubb touchdown with 57 seconds remaining, then batted down Wilson’s Hail Mary as time expired to stun the Steelers, 24-19. GO DEEPER Browns stun Steelers 24-19 in snow as Chubb scores late TD: Takeaways A team that made a statement by beating the Baltimore Ravens just four days earlier dropped to 8-3, leaving the door open in the competitive AFC North. “Missed opportunities,” defensive co-captain Cameron Hayward said. “We have to eat it. They made more plays at the end. Some of that stuff we can have some head-scratching about what was on display. Just take it, move on. I know everybody is pretty pissed off about the loss.” The weighty moments at the end of the game loom large: coach Mike Tomlin’s decision to accept an illegal touching penalty that gave the Browns a second crack at third down on the final drive, then spending a timeout that would be needed later; the coverage on the ensuing third-and-6 conversion; the decision to tackle Chubb on the 2-yard line with more than 90 seconds remaining instead of letting him score to preserve time and get the ball back. But the reality is this game was lost much earlier, on the other side of the ball. “We beat ourselves with a lot of mistakes,” Austin said. “That takes all 11 looking in the mirror and just continuing to push details. They’re a good team. Got to give them credit. But at the end of the day, we just got to perform better.” Advertisement Two weeks ago, when Wilson erased a 10-point, second-half deficit against the Commanders, it appeared the offense had finally figured it out after years of instability and inconsistency. At the time, the veteran signal caller had led the Steelers to 31.7 points and 382 total yards per game through three starts. If the offense continued along the same trajectory, it was reasonable to consider the Steelers legitimate Super Bowl contenders that could stand toe-to-toe with Patrick Mahomes or Josh Allen. But it hasn’t continued. If those first three games showed the explosive upside of Wilson’s moonball, his veteran presence and his ability to make checks at the line of scrimmage, the past two have revealed many of the Steelers’ offensive warts. It’s certainly not all on Wilson. However, sacks are becoming problematic, putting the offense behind the chains. This was an obvious area of concern the minute the Steelers signed Wilson, considering he led the NFL in sacks taken in two of the previous five seasons. Initially, when he took over for Fields in Week 7, the Steelers did well enough to protect Wilson that it wasn’t a major red flag. However, in the first half alone on Thursday, Wilson was sacked four times, as the Browns kept the Steelers’ offensive line off balance with stunts and games up front. Three of those sacks came from Myles Garrett, including a strip-sack that set the Browns up on a short field. Myles strips the ball and we recover it 🙌😤 #PITvsCLE | @NFLonPrime pic.twitter.com/36WalR8R8h — Cleveland Browns (@Browns) November 22, 2024  Even beyond the negative plays, Pittsburgh’s offense has become too boom or bust. Yes, once again, Wilson’s deep shot was a catalyst. He connected with Austin on a 46-yard bomb up the seam, hit Van Jefferson on a 35-yard gain and found George Pickens for 31 yards. Those big plays helped bolster what was a solid stat line from Wilson, as he completed 21 of 28 passes for 270 yards and a touchdown with no interceptions for a 116.7 passer rating. Advertisement The problem is, when the Steelers aren’t producing touchdowns on these deep shots, they’re having a hard time finishing drives. The issues emerged on the opening drive. On third down, Wilson took an 8-yard sack on third-and-2, turning a potential 50-yard field goal attempt into a 58-yarder that the reliable Chris Boswell missed. The Steelers, who rank 26th in success rate (37.2 percent, per TruMedia) since Wilson took over, tried to use every resource available to keep the offense going. However, another first-half drive was halted on the 40-yard line. This time, they deployed Fields on a fourth-and-2 QB keeper, failing and turning the ball over on downs. The offense also fizzled at the 30 (made field goal), its own 46 (failed fourth-and-1 run by Jaylen Warren) and the Cleveland 9-yard line (made field goal). “We had some really good, explosive plays down the field, throwing the ball with Van (Jefferson) — he made some great catches — and Calvin (Austin),” Wilson said. “And then we got stalled for whatever reasons. We’ve got to watch the film and see what that was. … We needed one or two more plays.” Complicating matters is the unique quarterback dynamic. After utilizing the Fields package for three plays on Sunday against the Ravens, the Steelers featured their mobile QB on seven snaps (plus an eighth that didn’t happen because of a false start) on Thursday. The results were mixed. After coming up short on fourth down early in the game, Fields provided a second-half spark when he kept the ball on a zone read and raced 30 yards along the right sideline. That played helped jump-start the offense, and later in the same drive, the threat of Fields keeping the ball on the zone read helped Warren burst into the end zone to snap the Steelers’ touchdown-less skid and kindle the rally. Jaylen Warren in for the TD! The @Steelers answer right back.#PITvsCLE on Prime VideoAlso streaming on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/aDPce0i8CM — NFL (@NFL) November 22, 2024  The Steelers also put the ball in Fields’ hands in a four-minute situation with the lead. It was a reasonable time to play the running quarterback, with the Steelers trying to burn the clock. However, on third-and-4, his deep shot for Pickens sailed incomplete, stopping the clock and giving the Browns plenty of time to score the go-ahead touchdown. Asked if he would have liked to be in the game in that critical moment, Wilson was somewhat transparent. Advertisement “Listen, I always want to be in there,” he said. “That’s just the competitor in me. But at the same time, we have great trust in Justin, our team, our coaches and everything we’re doing.” It’s also not the easiest challenge for Fields. He said after the game that he felt “kind of stiff” on his 30-yard run after standing on the sideline for the entirety of the second and third quarters, adding he felt he could have scored on the play. Asked if it’s difficult to enter the game mid-stream and virtually without warning, Fields admitted it is. “But at the end of the day, that’s what my job is,” he said. “So you can’t complain. Anytime I get a chance and an opportunity to go on the field and help my team, I’m happy to do it.” Sitting behind a keyboard and watching the game from the press box, it’s honestly hard to say what the right balance should be. Fields has often been the Steelers’ best offensive weapon, and his mobility might be able to help them rectify their red zone woes. Using both quarterbacks allows the Steelers to adjust on the fly if the offense needs a jolt or if the opposing pass rush is becoming too big of a factor. On the other hand, it does seem that, at times, rotating quarterbacks can disrupt the passers’ rhythm and timing. Still, it’s important to remember that the Steelers got to 8-2 thanks to the contributions of both players. If they’re going to prove that this two-game stretch of offensive woes was a blip on the radar, and that this offense can in fact provide an edge in the postseason, they’re probably going to need to continue to use both. Finding that right balance and rediscovering a way to finish drives will help determine how far this offense — and the team as a whole — goes. “We’ve got a lot of football left,” Wilson said. “We’ve got a lot of opportunities to respond in the highest way, highest level. I think that everything that we want is still in front of us.” (Photo of Russell Wilson: Kevin Sabitus / Getty Images) Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

NYT > Sports,Odell Beckham Jr. Made a One-Handed Catch. It Changed His Life Forever.,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936972/2024/11/22/odell-beckham-one-handed-catch-giants/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:01:59 +0000","In 2014, Beckham Jr. was a talented rookie. Then he became a “celebrity overnight.”","NFL One of the most iconic catches in NFL history — a play that would change Odell Beckham Jr.’s life — started with a misunderstanding and a poor route. Eli Manning is quick to remind his former New York Giants receiver of both whenever the play comes up. And it always does. It’s one of the more indelible moments in the NFL over the last decade. Advertisement “It was kind of like bad, bad, bad … unbelievable. Or, oh, no, no, no … great job,” Manning said. “We laugh more about that. I recognize how good it was and eventually get to (acknowledging) that point, but with your pals, it’s always good to give them a little heat about what it could have been. It could have been a walk-in: double move, beat him by 5 yards, nice easy catch and cruise in for an easy touchdown. “But that’s not the Odell way.” For weeks during the 2014 season, Giants players and coaches learned about the “Odell way.” They watched a precocious rookie in practice snatch balls out of the air with a swipe of his hand. They saw him throw, punt and kick field goals, effortlessly launching footballs to improbable depths. They witnessed him nonchalantly perform eye-popping, athletic feats as if he had been doing them all of his life. His former Giants teammate, inside linebacker Jameel McClain, remembers watching Beckham and thinking, “Man, God really did a number on him.” On Nov. 23, 2014, a MetLife Stadium crowd of more than 80,000 and a prime-time NBC television audience learned what the Giants already knew: Beckham was capable of the extraordinary. His one-handed — check that, three-fingered — 43-yard touchdown catch against the Dallas Cowboys on a ball that sailed behind his head electrified the world and transformed Beckham from an exciting, talented rookie into a sports phenom. “During the moment, I didn’t know the magnitude of what actually happened,” Beckham said. “I only know the aftermath. It’s been my life ever since.” The Catch That Broke the Internet. Odell Beckham Jr. catches a one-handed touchdown and it is arguably one of the most iconic catches in NFL history. (via @nflthrowback)pic.twitter.com/SAchXm5uCv — NBC Sports (@NBCSports) December 22, 2019  Beckham says that with a tone of acceptance, but also a tinge of regret. He appreciates the fame and fortune that the catch helped generate. He also resents that the catch is used to minimize the other accomplishments of his career. In many ways, Beckham and his most celebrated play have a love-hate relationship. Advertisement He’s 32 now, no longer a phenom but a veteran of 10 NFL seasons. The Miami Dolphins are his fifth team. He is closing in on 600 career catches, 8,000 receiving yards and 60 touchdowns. He might have been the MVP of the Los Angeles Rams’ Super Bowl LVI victory over the Cincinnati Bengals in February 2022 had his left knee not given out, forcing him to miss the rest of the game and the entire next season, altering his football future. Yet, the one play that has largely defined his career happened exactly 10 years ago Saturday. Beckham’s catch while being interfered with by Cowboys cornerback Brandon Carr adorns countless highlight reels and is commemorated on T-shirts and posters on the walls of sports bars and man caves. It inspired scores of imposters and flashy one-handed catches to come. A decade later, his connection with Manning is typically the yardstick for which all other acrobatic one-handed catches, such as the one Garrett Wilson of the New York Jets made late last month, are measured. CATCH OF THE YEAR CANDIDATE FROM GARRETT WILSON @nyjets pic.twitter.com/A3efxJMIiF — The Athletic (@TheAthletic) November 1, 2024 
“There’s always something about the original, and it was the first time I had seen something like that,” said Cris Collinsworth, the longtime NFL receiver who was in the NBC booth providing color commentary with Al Michaels for the Giants-Cowboys game. “Today, between the gloves, the balls aren’t as slick and these guys are freakier athletes. These guys are 6-4, 225 pounds, and they run 4.3 (seconds in the 40-yard dash). It’s just insane what they are able to do, so I try not to get so freaked out about it anymore. “But yeah, when it happened, I thought (Beckham’s catch) was the best thing that I’d ever seen.” It’s stood the test of time, too. Beckham remembers it vividly. He was playing for LSU against Auburn in 2013 when he soared above the far sideline and tried to make a one-handed snag. He couldn’t haul it in, but he vowed that he’d make that play the next time the opportunity arose. His inspiration came from LSU teammate Jarvis Landry. The two would spend hours outside their college dorm, throwing footballs to each other and practicing one-handed catches. “That’s really how it came about,” Beckham said. “It really was a lot of Jarvis’ doing as far as the way he took me being a kid who was going to be good to understanding that I want to be a legend. I want to be remembered forever.” Advertisement The 12th pick of the 2014 NFL Draft, Beckham didn’t get  his professional career off to a great start. A hamstring injury sidelined him for much of training camp and the first four games of the regular season. “He had a rocky start, and that New York media wasn’t friendly to him,” McClain said. “I remember having so many different conversations with him, like, ‘All of this is going to pass by, and the time that the world sees who you are is going to come.'” In his regular-season debut, Beckham caught the game-winning touchdown pass against the Atlanta Falcons. Two weeks later, he had two touchdowns against the Cowboys. In the three games after that, he totaled 21 catches for 357 yards. Beckham already had caught a 3-yard touchdown pass from Manning midway through the first quarter in the rematch against the Cowboys in Week 12 on “Sunday Night Football.” The Giants had designs on more when they had a first down on the Cowboys’ 43-yard line. It was the area of the field where Giants offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo liked to take deep shots, and the offense had been working extensively on different throws off bootlegs. One, in particular, called for Beckham to make an out-and-up move down the sideline. As the first quarter ended, the coaches and Manning discussed the merits of a deep shot. Giants head coach Tom Coughlin wasn’t sure it was the best time to try it. Beckham pleaded with Coughlin to keep the call. “We were trying to figure out what shot to take, and that was one of the shots on the menu,” McAdoo said. “Good thing we didn’t talk ourselves out of that one.” As Beckham jogged back on the field, it was either Coughlin or Manning who said, “Don’t rush the route.” It, however, was the last three of those words that stuck in Beckham’s head as he lined up outside and to Manning’s right: rush the route. Advertisement “We wanted to get a little comeback and go, and we were a little worried if we just did a straight fake and rollout, it would bring the safety over. So, we just kind of did a half roll,” Manning recalled. “I want to take my eyes to the middle safety, hold him a little bit and have a backside post. Pretend that you’re looking at that and then gear up, and you’re throwing the comeback and go no matter what. If we’re getting high (safety), it should be one-on-one. We got the look that we wanted.” Beckham, indeed, rushed the route and didn’t sell the comeback. Carr wasn’t fooled, either. He was stride-for-stride with Beckham tracking the flight of Manning’s pass. “Definitely not one of my best routes,” Beckham said. “He tried to squeeze me to the sideline, and I kind of did a basketball move. If somebody is posting you up, you pull the chair. I just kind of pulled the chair. The rest was history.” Beckham slipped inside Carr, who grabbed the front of the receiver’s jersey and was immediately flagged. Beckham then elevated, reached his right arm well behind his head and secured the ball with three fingers before tumbling into the end zone. “You can’t see where the ball is, and to still get your hands and fingers on it and somehow be strong enough in your fingers to hold onto that thing and pull it in while falling backward?” Manning said. “It doesn’t quite make sense. One of the all-time great catches.” In three decades as a broadcaster, Collinsworth remembers two instances where he had to pause because he was stunned by what he witnessed. There was the interception by New England Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler at the goal line in the final seconds of Super Bowl XLIX, and there was the Beckham catch. When he spoke about the latter, he told the television audience, “That may be the greatest catch I’ve ever seen in my life.” Advertisement To which Michaels replied, “It’s in the conversation.” “It was just special,” Collinsworth told The Athletic. “There’s some things that the more you slow it down, the better it gets. I thought that was one of those. It was like, ‘Oh, he did that?’ And then he got his feet in and he only got three fingers on it. It just kept adding up. It’s great to have those moments. “When I was a kid, I can remember things that inspired me to want to play football or sports in general. I’m glad it happened. I’m glad there are Odell Beckhams in the world who can do things that other mere mortals can’t.” McAdoo still recalls the look of astonishment on the face of the normally stoic Manning as he came to the sideline with the crowd buzzing after the catch. It never subsided throughout a game Dallas won 31-28. “It was electric,” McAdoo said. “I’ve been a part of some big games, whether it was the Super Bowl, whether it was Aaron (Rodgers) and Brett (Favre) playing for the first time in the Metrodome. The buzz in the stadium after that happened lasted the whole game. It’s going to be hard to beat that catch.” In many ways, the catch was buoyed by the perfect storm. It was a prime-time Sunday game, and NBC had a multitude of camera angles to do it justice. The game featured two big market teams with deep fan bases. Beckham’s catch generated oohs and aahs from the crowd as it was shown across the stadium. The gasps kept coming as fans turned to their phones to keep watching clips of the reception. “We’ve never had a play, I think in sports history, that went as viral,” said former Giants guard Geoff Schwartz, one of the first players to greet Beckham in the end zone. “That was sort of the start of social media being such an important part of our lives. Odell went from a first-round pick to a celebrity overnight.” Said McClain: “That was one of those defining moments where it was like, ‘OK, world, welcome your new star.'” Baltimore Ravens top receiver Zay Flowers was 14 when Beckham made the grab. Growing up in South Florida, Flowers saw a replay of the catch on his phone and went around showing his friends the highlight. “I thought it was fake,” Flowers said. “I remember watching it over and over for like two weeks straight.” Flowers and Beckham were teammates last year in Baltimore, and Flowers said the play briefly came up in conversation. When it did, Beckham told his teammate that the catch “changed his life.” Zay Flowers' locker is right next to Odell Beckham Jr.'s in the Ravens locker room. 😈 pic.twitter.com/9DeM8OvQBi — Ryan Mink (@ryanmink) September 7, 2023  Beckham immediately achieved almost mythical status in New York, his every move garnering attention and headlines. “It was like Bon Jovi coming back to the Meadowlands,” McAdoo said. “There was always a vibe about him and he was a performer.” For Beckham, the true impact of his catch resonated when he’d see young athletes practicing one-handed grabs at schools and at football camps. He has traveled extensively overseas and been asked about the catch in Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands. Advertisement He’s flattered that it has inspired others, and he understands that his immense popularity around the globe — his 17.5 million Instagram followers were the most of any NFL player as of earlier this year — traces back to that November 2014 night, when he corralled a ball that seemed destined for out of bounds. “In the most humble way, I can go almost anywhere in the world and people, for the most part, kind of remember that moment,” Beckham said. “Even people who don’t know football know me, which is a blessing. But, it’s honestly something that I never really foresaw. It came with that moment.” Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

He has the one-handed catch against the Cowboys. “People want to amount my entire career to just one catch, but there’s so many other plays that happened and things that I did, where it’s just hard to be like, ‘Yeah, he only had one catch,'” Beckham said. “I’ve caught the ball multiple times with one hand. Everything in life is about timing, and it was pretty crazy timing. ‘Sunday Night Football.’ New York Giants, Dallas Cowboys. It’s something that I’d never trade for the world. “Here I am today.

The Athletic asked its NBA staff for each team’s biggest concern at this point. The responses covered the full spectrum, from free-throw shooting and poor depth to well-known names not yet producing at the levels we’ve come to expect in recent years. (Stats and records are through Wednesday’s games.) Advertisement Rim protection: This is a fresh concern. It might be a short-term one since the Celtics ranked near the league leaders in rim protection last season and should soon welcome back 7-foot-2 shot blocker Kristaps Porziņģis. But Boston has been gashed for layups and dunks recently, especially in a loss to the Atlanta Hawks and an all-too-close win against the Toronto Raptors. Joe Mazzulla said his team needs to improve its individual defense and rebounding. The Celtics might just be suffering symptoms of a mild championship hangover. — Jay King Nic Claxton’s back issue: The Nets got off to a surprisingly solid start, even as Claxton slowly worked his way into the rotation after a preseason hamstring injury. But now he is out again with a lingering back strain. The team wants to build an identity while the front office ideally wants to get the top pick in the draft. They’re achieving both at the moment, and there is a lot to be excited about if Cam Thomas is making a leap. But Claxton is one of the Nets’ cornerstones, and they need him to stay healthy and keep improving if this rebuild is going anywhere down the road. — Jared Weiss Lack of free throws: I could go with the defense here, but I think that’ll improve with more time and the eventual return of Mitchell Robinson. The Knicks rank 29th in the NBA in free-throw attempts per game (19.1). For a team that shoots a lot of 2-pointers — efficiently, I should add — and has a head coach who emphasizes shooting 3s, getting to the rim and free-throw attempts, it’s a bit concerning New York doesn’t visit the charity stripe more. Mikal Bridges has only taken 11 free throws this season, despite the majority of his shot attempts coming from inside the arc. — James L. Edwards III Can they get healthy and on the same page?: The Sixers are stuck in a spiral that seems inescapable at the moment. Joel Embiid, Paul George and Tyrese Maxey shared the floor together for the first time Wednesday, a game that George left early because of an injury to the same knee he hurt in the preseason. Their only two wins came in overtime, so they are a few bounces away from being completely winless. They’re already at the team meeting stage of the season. The supporting cast has struggled to shoot and rebound. There simply has not been the spark to overcome adversity that defines a season. — Jared Weiss GO DEEPER 'Feels like negativity keeps following me': Joel Embiid on Sixers' team meeting, criticisms No chance to build chemistry: RJ Barrett had an AC joint injury. Pelvic and elbow injuries have kept Immanuel Quickley to two and a half games. Scottie Barnes suffered an orbital bone fracture early in the second week of the season. The Raptors schedule was always going to be tough to start the year. However, the presumptive starting lineup, which also features Jakob Poeltl and emerging sophomore Gradey Dick, has played zero minutes. Even if you are rebuilding, you want your core pieces to get big minutes against good teams. The Raptors are missing out on that opportunity. — Eric Koreen  Team defense: After trading Alex Caruso this offseason, the Bulls knew their defense would suffer, but Chicago is on the cusp of ranking among the bottom-three teams in defense. Without a single elite defender, and absent appropriate size, Chicago knows its fortunes will be difficult to change. The Bulls are attempting to overcome their defensive limitations by playing faster and launching more 3-pointers. But they’ve compounded their issues with turnovers and cold shooting nights. — Darnell Mayberry Advertisement How about … none?: Seriously, they deserve this moment. Only a few teams have done what the Cavs did — win their first 15 games — and historically speaking, those teams wound up in the NBA Finals. It’s OK to say this team has no glaring concerns. Take a bow. If you insist, there are some issues to keep an eye on, like wing depth (the Cavs have a bunch of them, but will they hold up in the playoffs?), defensive rebounding and serviceable bigs off the bench. We just can’t, with a straight face, call any of these items concerns right now. — Joe Vardon Turnovers: The Pistons entered Thursday tied with the Bulls for 20th in the NBA in turnovers per game. Cade Cunningham is Detroit’s primary ballhandler and fourth in the league in assists per game, but he leads the NBA in total turnovers. Turnovers are to be expected with a team this young, but Cunningham is the head of the snake. Once he and the Pistons value the basketball on each possession, there should be fewer close games that keep Detroit fans on the edge of their seats. — Hunter Patterson Tyrese Haliburton: My guy can’t shoot right now. Haliburton is making just 37.5 percent of his shots overall and is chucking it at an abysmal 28.4 percent from 3-point range. These are both, easily, career lows, and for what it’s worth, his 82 percent shooting at the foul line also is a career worst. The Pacers have better players and more depth, and Haliburton’s ability to push the pace and find the open man are still paramount (his assists are down too). But for the Pacers to be good, he has to play at his usual All-Star level. — Joe Vardon Khris Middleton’s health: During training camp, Middleton told The Athletic that he needed to play in at least 70 games to consider this a successful season for himself. The Bucks are 15 games through their schedule and he has still not felt confident enough to get on the floor for five-on-five activities. The Bucks have rebounded well from their 2-8 start by winning four of their past five games, but it will be difficult to compete for a championship without a healthy Middleton. — Eric Nehm Trae Young: You can nitpick about Atlanta’s defense or the shooting on the wings or the backup point guard situation, but none of that matters if Young isn’t playing at an All-Star level. And while he’s leading the league in assists, he’s also struggled mightily to score, shooting just 38 percent on the season and failing to get off a shot in two last-shot situations that both ended in Hawks losses. While Young historically has been a slow starter, his Achilles tendinitis to begin the season adds to the concern level this time around. — John Hollinger Advertisement When will Mark Williams play again?: The Hornets are reaching an anniversary they don’t want: Dec. 8 will mark a year since Williams last played in a game. The 15th pick in the 2022 draft has played in just 62 games in his career. He missed most of last season with a back injury. This year, it’s been a left foot issue. Williams has been productive when he has played and could be a key piece for Charlotte in its rebuild, but the Hornets need to see him back on the floor to know that. — Mike Vorkunov Terry Rozier’s start: After their failed pursuit of Damian Lillard in the summer of 2023, Miami’s big move to bolster its backcourt was trading Kyle Lowry and a lottery-protected 2027 first-round pick to Charlotte for Terry Rozier. The 30-year-old got off to a decent start after his arrival in South Beach, but he missed the 2024 playoffs due to a neck injury, and he’s off to a rough start this season as the Heat have stumbled to a 6-7 mark. Rozier’s averaging 12.9 points and 3.7 assists on 38 percent shooting. Miami needs to be more explosive on offense to compete with teams such as Boston and Cleveland at the top of the Eastern Conference. Rozier has to play a key role in the offense taking another step. — Will Guillory 3-point shooting: Orlando has done an admirable job overcoming the absence of injured star Paolo Banchero. But the team still struggles to score in the half court and struggles to hit long-range shots. The Magic rank last in 3-point shooting percentage, making only 30.5 percent of their attempts. They remain competitive because of their outstanding defense, coaching, cohesiveness and home-court advantage. They have a lot of positives going for them. But as their shooting woes in last year’s playoffs demonstrated, their inability to convert from beyond the arc is an Achilles heel. — Josh Robbins Can they keep players engaged?: Still early in their rebuild, the Wizards need to finish at or near the bottom of the NBA standings to enhance their 2025 draft lottery chances. It sounds ghoulish to say, but they’re on the right track with a 2-11 record. That said, for any team, losing a lot of games (and by wide margins too) can cause collateral damage, especially to veteran players who grow impatient with losing and potentially with young players who could fall into bad habits. Can coach Brian Keefe and the team leaders keep Washington’s older players positive and the young players on the right developmental track? — Josh Robbins Same song: The Nuggets are going to win 50 games and be relevant come playoff time. But can they get over the hump this season? Do they have the quality depth to survive when all-everything Nikola Jokić is not on the floor? That’s what terminated their playoff run last season. Can it be different this time around? — Tony Jones GO DEEPER Without Nikola Jokić, the Nuggets have looked alarmingly helpless Defense: The Timberwolves had the best defense in the NBA by a country mile last season, riding it all the way to the Western Conference finals. Rudy Gobert was Defensive Player of the Year and flanked by a trio of the best perimeter defenders in the league in Jaden McDaniels, Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Anthony Edwards. Of those four players, only Alexander-Walker has resembled what he was last season. Gobert has said he isn’t playing up to his standards at the rim, McDaniels hasn’t been anywhere close to the disrupter on the perimeter and Edwards has often looked inattentive and unfocused on that end. If the Wolves are going to overcome a sluggish start, those three guys have to get their defensive teeth back. — Jon Krawczynski Alex Caruso’s shooting: Caruso scored a season-high 17 points during the recent win over the Trail Blazers. The Thunder are hoping that trend continues. For all the talk of the Caruso-for-Josh Giddey swap in Oklahoma City, neither side is seeing dividends yet. Giddey has struggled leading the Bulls offense and Caruso can’t find the net from beyond the 3-point arc, shooting just 21 percent from deep. And worse, defenders are straying all the way off him when he lines the perimeter. Caruso made more than 40 percent of his 3s in Chicago a season ago. If he continues to miss at this rate, he could become ill-fitting on a roster with shooting everywhere. But if he begins to look like himself again, at a bare minimum hitting open jumpers, the Thunder are in a better place. — Fred Katz Deni Avdija’s shot: The Blazers big offseason acquisition is off to a flat shooting start, which played a part in him losing his starting job 10 games into the season. After making a career-best 37.4 percent of his 3-pointers last season in Washington, Avdija has made only 13 of 50 in Portland (26 percent). With Shaedon Sharpe flourishing now that he is back from injury, Avdija’s minutes also have dipped slightly. He has provided value with his smarts, defense and passing, but when the Blazers gave up two first-round picks, two second-round picks and Malcolm Brogdon, they thought they were also getting a shooter on the rise. And maybe that is coming: Avdija in the last four games has made nearly half (7 of 15) of his 3-pointers. — Jason Quick Advertisement Will Hardy: The Jazz coach is so good at his job that, somehow, he still has a zombie roster competitive enough to only have the fourth-worst record in the league. It bodes well for when the Jazz have enough talent to win that Hardy will maximize that talent. He’s a phenomenal coach. But right now, the Utah front office needs about three more losses than the Jazz currently have. — Tony Jones Crunchtime conundrum: Who knew having too many closers could be this clunky? While the Luka Dončić-Kyrie Irving-Klay Thompson trio has mostly worked well, it’s still quite surprising to see these Mavs drop so many close games with all these elite shot-makers on the payroll. Six of their seven losses have been by seven points or fewer, including a stretch of four in a row (against Phoenix, Denver, Golden State and Utah) in which they lost by a combined eight points. While that’s counterintuitive, to be sure, it’s also a reminder there’s only one ball and their late-game chemistry will have to come over time. That process will be slowed a bit with Dončić sidelined for at least a week due to a wrist injury. The numbers, however, indicate Dallas has been better than its record. — Sam Amick Murky offensive identity: There aren’t many concerns with an 11-5 Rockets team within striking distance of first place in the West, but Houston’s lack of an offensive hierarchy is puzzling. The Rockets want to control the glass, run the floor in transition and defend aggressively without fouling, but the absence of a true pecking order rears its head at the wrong times, especially in crunchtime. Four of their five losses have come in the clutch when their pace and ball movement grinds to a halt. It’s hard to be a pace-and-space unit when you’re 15th in pace and 27th in 3s made per game, and those issues could be fixed with an outlined structure. — Kelly Iko Health: The Grizzlies’ depth has vastly improved from a year ago, enabling Memphis to survive — and even thrive at times — without a full complement of players. That said, the core trio of Ja Morant, Desmond Bane and Jaren Jackson Jr. has played exactly one game together, with Morant’s most recent hip injury again raising the question of just how often the Grizzlies can unite their three stars. Morant only played nine games a year ago and just eight so far this year, while Bane has played 58 and 42 the past two campaigns and only seven so far this season. — John Hollinger Is it too late to make noise?: The Pelicans are going through an unprecedented stretch of bad injury luck that’s left the roster decimated the past few weeks. After starting the season 2-0, New Orleans only has two wins in its last 14 games. There will be a few key pieces getting back on the court in the next two weeks. There’s a good chance CJ McCollum, Jordan Hawkins and Herb Jones will all be back in the lineup before the end of November. The Pelicans may start turning things around very soon. But the West is so incredibly deep that it might not matter. This is the wrong season to be playing catch-up. — Will Guillory GO DEEPER Pelicans coach Willie Green faces crossroads as injured stars near their return Lack of ball penetration: Nearly half of Victor Wembanyama’s shots are coming from the perimeter, up from just 30 percent as a rookie. The Spurs hoist the ninth-most 3s in the league, but to improve on their 20th-ranked offense, they’ll need to diversify their approach. Some of it is circumstantial: Rookie Stephon Castle, a physical downhill threat, is still learning; Tre Jones and Devin Vassell, San Antonio’s most frequent drivers last season, have only recently returned from injury; and Jeremy Sochan, who was fourth, has been sidelined since early November. Maybe reserve Keldon Johnson, who leads the way with 6.6 drives per game, gets more minutes, but it starts and ends with Wembanyama. The Frenchman needs to set the tone. — Kelly Iko Free-throw shooting: The last time an NBA team shot below 70 percent from the line for a season was five seasons ago when the Knicks did it. The last time a team with a winning record did it was nine seasons ago, when the Pistons did it. The 11-3 Warriors have made only 69.5 percent of their free throws. Andrew Wiggins, Jonathan Kuminga, Draymond Green, Trayce Jackson-Davis, Brandin Podziemski and Kevon Looney are all struggling from the line to varying degrees. They went 9 of 19 collectively in a three-point loss to the Clippers recently. In a conference where the standings margins are expected to be slim, a few free-throw-related losses in the middle months could be the difference between several seeding slots — the third to the seventh, for example — come April. — Anthony Slater Advertisement Turnovers: One of the reasons the Clippers are hovering around .500 is because they donate possessions like a red kettle is on the floor. Only the Trail Blazers and Jazz average more turnovers per game. And it’s the wrong kind of turnovers, as opponents steal the ball from the Clippers more than any other team. The Clippers can be better than league average on offense if they take better care of the ball, especially in fourth quarters. — Law Murray Depth: The Lakers’ depth was a concern entering the season, and it has grown more problematic since training camp. Jarred Vanderbilt and Christian Wood have yet to return from offseason surgeries. Jaxson Hayes is out with an ankle injury. Anthony Davis is battling plantar fasciitis, an injury that has bothered him since last season. Gabe Vincent and Max Christie have underperformed preseason expectations. Los Angeles is winning enough to stay competitive in the West, but it’s largely been because of production from the starters and D’Angelo Russell. Longer term, the Lakers need to get healthy and/or improve their roster via trade(s). — Jovan Buha GO DEEPER Dalton Knecht is on fire — and so are the Lakers Staying healthy: Through nine games, Phoenix looked great. Then misfortune hit. Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal suffered calf strains, and a team that opened 8-1 dropped six of seven. Completely healthy, this team looked like a title contender. Durant played like an MVP candidate. Beal excelled in his role. A rebuilt bench contributed. But it’s not even Thanksgiving, and the Phoenix injury report has become a main storyline. The good news: The Suns showed what was possible. They weren’t perfect, but they had something solid from which to build. The bad: As the league’s second-oldest team at 28.26 years, per NBA.com, the health factor may not go away. — Doug Haller Star workload: De’Aaron Fox is averaging 37.4 minutes per game. Keegan Murray is at 36.7. Domantas Sabonis and DeMar DeRozan are both at 36.5. That gives the Kings’ four out of the NBA’s top 14 players in minutes per game. That’s a ton to ask over the course of an 82-game marathon, especially with Sabonis (in his ninth season) and DeRozan (in his 17th season) already missing time due to back injuries. But that’s the trouble for the Kings, who have injured bench players (Malik Monk, rookie Devin Carter), questionable depth and a voracious hunger from Mike Brown and the organization to wrestle away every possible regular-season win to avoid the Play-In Tournament. Fox, Murray, Sabonis and DeRozan have been very durable players historically. That will be tested. — Anthony Slater Sign up to get The Bounce, the essential NBA newsletter from Zach Harper and The Athletic staff, delivered free to your inbox.

NYT > Sports,Shedeur Sanders Is Much More Than Colorado’s Star Quarterback,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938065/2024/11/22/colorado-football-shedeur-sanders-deion/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:01:59 +0000",The Buffaloes needed to improve after last season. So Sanders hit the recruiting trail.,"NCAAF BOULDER, Colo. — Terrell Timmons Jr. was, like so many now, sold on the grandiose vision. The transfer wide receiver was convinced Colorado would make a stunning charge toward a conference title not just because of the Buffs’ famous coach — but powered by his new quarterback, Shedeur Sanders. Sanders had a direct hand in swaying many key players to take the risk. Advertisement “Two is going to take us there,” Timmons said before the start of the season. A guarantee that, at the time, could’ve seemed a smidge idealistic. But three months on, Colorado is not hard to find at 8-2, ranked No. 16 in the College Football Playoff rankings and in control of its own destiny in the shortening race toward a Big 12 Championship Game appearance. A Colorado win over Kansas on Saturday inside Arrowhead Stadium combined with No. 16 BYU beating No. 21 Arizona State on the road and Utah beating No. 22 Iowa State at home Saturday would clinch the Buffaloes a shot at the conference crown. They can also get there by winning out, including against Oklahoma State on Black Friday.  Yes, the Buffaloes are headlined by their effervescent head coach, Deion Sanders, the Heisman Trophy front-runner in two-way rarity Travis Hunter — and their quarterback. Shedeur Sanders is a pretentious lightning rod to some, a celebrity athlete with a celebrity father to others, and is in contention to be the first quarterback selected in next year’s NFL Draft. He has thrown for 3,222 yards and 27 touchdowns and seven interceptions through the first 10 games and is completing 72.9 percent of his passes, tied for second place in the FBS with Ohio State’s Will Howard. GO DEEPER If Shedeur Sanders wants to be drafted No. 1, he needs to act like it But to get to where they are now, the Buffaloes needed much more. Shedeur, teammates say, knew it, which is why he went to work. Beyond the endless reels of social media interview clips, beyond being one of the most efficient quarterbacks in college football for a second consecutive season, perhaps Shedeur Sanders’ most impressive feat was his role in aiding in building this Buffs roster. His stardom helped lure a likely successor, too. On Thursday, Colorado landed a commitment from five-star quarterback Julian “JuJu” Lewis, a former USC commit. During Lewis’ first visit this summer to Boulder, he posed in a Colorado uniform on a gold throne as Shedeur handed him a set of keys, signifying what he would be inheriting. Advertisement Deion Sanders made no bones about flipping rosters if something isn’t up to snuff. He’s cleaned house at a historic rate. And after a humbling 4-8 season in 2023, Colorado had no choice but to beef up its offensive line and add to an already talented wide receivers group that featured Hunter, Jimmy Horn Jr. and Omarion Miller. Shedeur Sanders went recruiting, too. Timmons said Shedeur reached out on social media to gauge interest after Timmons entered the portal from NC State last December. “I would say 2’s approach is a very pro-mindset,” Timmons said when asked to describe working with him now on a day-to-day basis. “He’s very detailed with everything he does in the film room, on the field, off the field, everything. He’s very intelligent. You can tell he really looks up to Tom Brady with just the way he moves and operates.” When former Ohio State running back Dallan Hayden was in Boulder on his official visit after entering the portal in April, Hayden said Shedeur wanted to sit down with him and explain what this year’s offense would need. In January, Shedeur came across tape of former FAU wide receiver LaJohntay Wester, who had entered the portal a few weeks earlier. “I pulled up his film, and I was recruiting him myself,” Shedeur said in April. “I pulled it up myself and was like, ‘Nah, we need this guy. This is the guy we want, this is the guy we need on the field.’” Like his dad, Shedeur sold Wester on the vision of what it could look like if it all came together in Boulder. In his first year with the Buffaloes, Wester has nine total touchdowns and has been one of most dynamic receivers in the conference. In last week’s 49-24 win over Utah, Wester had a 76-yard punt return for a touchdown. “He’s just a complete quarterback,” Wester said of Shedeur last month. “I’m glad to be on his side.” Another new wideout, former Vanderbilt transfer Will Sheppard, caught two touchdowns against Utah. At 6-foot-3, Sheppard is Shedeur’s most physically imposing receiver, an ideal complement to the all-around skill of Hunter and the speed of Wester and Horn. While the receiving corps was boosted in the offseason, Hunter remains Shedeur’s go-to option. Hunter leads the team with 74 receptions, 911 yards receiving and nine receiving touchdowns. Advertisement The pair spoke of the chemistry they’ve developed earlier this month on Shedeur’s podcast “2Legendary.” “You’ve just got to have that brotherly bond, even outside of football,” Hunter said. “If you trust me outside of football, of course you’re going to trust me on the field.” For this pass-happy offense to reach its apex, more trust was needed elsewhere, too. As stellar as the second year in Boulder has been for Shedeur, the first was equally maddening. Despite being one of the most efficient quarterbacks in the country and having a 27-to-4 touchdown-to-interception ratio, he was also the most sacked quarterback in college football. He was sacked 52 times in 11 starts. Shedeur called former Indiana right tackle Kahlil Benson after he went into the transfer portal last November to introduce himself. That same day, former UTEP guard Justin Mayers went into the transfer portal, and he had five missed calls from the same number. The guy who kept trying him? His future quarterback. A few months after he signed at Colorado, Mayers posted a video on his own YouTube channel of Colorado’s offensive linemen snowmobiling in the mountains above Breckenridge, Colo., with Shedeur. One of those linemen was former five-star left tackle Jordan Seaton, who jokingly jumped out of his blocking stance shin-deep in snow with Shedeur laughing nearby. Shedeur, Seaton has said in various interviews, was one of the main reasons he chose the Buffaloes. As the race for Seaton’s signature heated up last December with other high-profile programs vying for his talent, Shedeur FaceTimed Seaton showing off his pricey diamond necklace and said, “We can shine together.” Seaton was a mandatory blindside addition for the Buffaloes to try to keep Sanders upright. Still, the Buffaloes rank 94th in allowed pressure rate in 2024 (33.6 percent), only slightly better than last year’s brutal year in which they were 110th (36.7 percent). Shedeur and the line also have allowed 31 sacks through 10 games, which is 17 fewer sacks than this point a year ago. Advertisement Seaton said Shedeur’s desire to dissect defenses from the pocket and not overreacting to mistakes has helped his learning curve as a true freshman left tackle. “Having a calm quarterback makes me more calm,” Seaton said last month. “It’s like Mike and Ike with me and Shedeur.” Clint Trickett knows the range of Shedeur’s magnetism. Now Georgia Southern’s pass-game coordinator, Trickett recruited Shedeur while an assistant at Florida Atlantic four years ago. Before Shedeur joined his dad when Sanders took the Jackson State job in September 2020, Shedeur had committed to FAU. “You want to have a quarterback who is your lead recruiter and who is that driving force, but at the same time, to have one that makes people want to come play with him, that’s not common,” Trickett said. “Most quarterbacks are all about going and getting it, but most don’t have the star power to bring them in the boat. That’s what makes him special.” Colorado’s ambitious plan is working. Yet Shedeur’s approach to leadership has been called into question by some. After Colorado was smoked by Nebraska in Week 2, his postgame comments about being sacked five times in comparison to none taken by Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola appeared to some like he was pointing blame at his own offensive line. In September, The Athletic’s Jim Trotter spoke to two former NFL general managers about how Shedeur’s personality and leadership style may impact how he’s viewed throughout the rigorous draft process. “The stuff about the comments and things like that, people will worry about that a little bit, but the work ethic is the thing,” one former GM said. On the first play of the game against Utah last week, Shedeur telegraphed a pass that was intercepted. He responded by going 30 of 40 for 340 yards, three touchdowns and completed 73 percent of his passes. Critical of himself afterward, Shedeur said he needed to “take over a little bit more” and was going to apologize to the rest of the offense. Advertisement “I can’t put the team in that type of situation,” he said. “I’m thankful for the defense. I may need to take them out to dinner this week for saving me and saving the team.” His father has routinely said that if Shedeur is given adequate protection from his offensive line, he is good enough to win games with his talent. Deion recently said he will “privately” have a hand in which teams draft Shedeur and Hunter, speaking specifically to Shedeur on FS1’s “Speak” sports show, he wants an organization “that can handle the quarterback he is.” The duo strolls the sidelines together before every game as Deion bestows advice on his son. “Show them who you are,” he said before the win over Utah. Shedeur has been known to clap back at those who speak disparagingly of the Buffaloes or flaunt any number of his ritzy possessions — diamond-encrusted watches, cars, you name it — in the general direction of detractors. Teammates say they don’t see that side of him as being a true representation of who he is. They chose to listen to what Shedeur Sanders was pitching because it’s playing out just the way he said it could. Or, in the parlance of his father, the way it always would. “You know, he’s all on social media and famous, but he’s really a normal person,” Timmons said. “He’s not Hollywood. He’s a normal person like me and you. He’s just really good at what he does.”  (Top photo: Dustin Bradford / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here Getty Images Mercedes’ Friday pace (although it was Thursday night here) shines through once again in FP2.  Lewis Hamilton ends the day fastest, which is a good sign after his recent struggles. I’m still uncertain the team has the pace to best Ferrari and McLaren, which are definitely in the ballpark at the front. Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez didn’t go for a soft tire run in FP2, meaning it’s hard to say where Red Bull stacks up in the competitive picture. But watching Verstappen’s onboard, he really didn’t seem comfortable with the balance of the car.  The Austin upgrade was intended to help improve the connection he felt between the car and the road and while there has been progress, Thursday wasn’t the most ringing endorsement of a step forward. For F1, there’ll be positivity FP1 and FP2 went by without a hitch. I am curious about the lack of fans in the main grandstand, though.  Yes it’s cold out, but I’d expect to have seen more today. Let’s see if it picks up through the rest of the weekend. Advertisement Getty Images I’ve seen this one before. Mercedes finishes FP1 fastest, sparking excitement along the lines of ‘we’re so back!’ — Mercedes then fails to get any faster through the rest of the weekend, sliding behind McLaren, Ferrari and Red Bull for pace. It could be a similar script in Las Vegas.  Lewis Hamilton put in a rapid final lap at the end of FP1 to finish nearly 0.4s clear of teammate George Russell in P2, with Lando Norris nearly a second off Hamilton’s time in third.  Yes, the run plans are clearly different, making it hard to glean too much from that performance. Still, Mercedes will be pleased with that start. The team has fared a little better in cooler conditions this year, meaning the cold of Las Vegas might help.  But I’d still be surprised if it had the outright pace to finish ahead of both McLaren and Ferrari. I commented to my colleagues to think back to 12 months ago, and how different things were. We were genuinely questioning if the rest of the race weekend would happen after the loose water valve cover caused FP1 to be canceled just eight minutes in.  Everything turned out good in the end, but boy was that a torrid opening night.

Plus, the Las Vegas GP beckons The Athletic  While the drivers’ title looks like just a matter of time before its inevitable victor is crowned, things feel much more up in the air with the constructors’ championship. McLaren already had the lead heading into São Paulo and didn’t lose so much ground on Red Bull, mostly owing to another poor showing from Sergio Perez. Their 36-point lead over Ferrari is a decent platform, but even Red Bull in third will hope for a turnaround in fortunes that could yet see them come out on top for a third successive season.  Alpine sit P6 but Haas and RB will have a pretty clear target for their remaining races: pinch the place off them. GO FURTHER F1 driver, constructor standings 2024: Max Verstappen on verge of another title Getty Images The prospect of Max Verstappen clinching his fourth world championship at the Las Vegas Grand Prix — F1’s glitziest race — is exciting for the sport. Verstappen will secure the title with two rounds to spare if he can finish ahead of Lando Norris on Saturday night, or if Norris fails to outscore him by three points. Preparations are already being made by officials, and yesterday I spoke with F1 chief commercial officer, Emily Prazer: 💬 “I work really closely with the Red Bull team across the board…so we called them (and) said, let’s have a chat about what this looks like if you win. We’re in Vegas, so we want to help you put on a huge party. “There’s mixed thoughts on that from their camp but we have a significant plan, as you’d expect. I don’t want to ruin it though. Just watch out for the Bellagio fountains.” GO FURTHER How Max Verstappen can win the drivers’ championship in Las Vegas and light up F1’s glitziest race Getty Images It’s been a real breakthrough year for Lando Norris, taking his McLaren into a serious title challenge and ensuring Max Verstappen has had things far from his own way over the second half of the season. But following events in Brazil, even the Brit has accepted it’s just a matter of time before Verstappen completes a fourth successive title triumph. Here is Norris, speaking from Las Vegas ahead of the track action:  💬 “I kind of know the position I’m in now, and probably I have less to lose. Post-Brazil was a tough one for me because it was the first moment realistically when I’m like, it’s tough to achieve first position now. “We were on such a good run of form, little by little… (but) it was hard to get any big points on Max, because he didn’t have any bad races. “I had a tough week because things just didn’t go our way (in Brazil) and my real fight for the championship was slimmed by the biggest margin of almost the whole year.” You can read more from Norris, speaking yesterday, in the piece below from our correspondent Madeline Coleman. GO FURTHER Ahead of Las Vegas GP, Lando Norris admits his first F1 title fight will likely end in defeat Advertisement Getty Images We could have the drivers’ championship all sewn up this weekend.  But how can Max Verstappen do that? Well, the good news is Luke Smith has gone through those exact permutations. It’s all in the link below, so you know what you should be hoping to see happen (or not) over the coming days.  GO FURTHER How Max Verstappen can win the drivers’ championship in Las Vegas and light up F1’s glitziest race The Athletic  Lando Norris was starting to seriously threaten Max Verstappen’s lead — which is why the defending champion’s victory in Brazil felt like such a telling blow. The defending champion saw his buffer out front return to 62 points; now a healthy margin given a maximum of 86 points are still to play for this season.  Charles Leclerc will have a second-place finish in his sights for Ferrari, as he remains within striking distance (24pts) of Norris’ McLaren. As for P5, only two points separate George Russell and his outgoing Mercedes teammate, Lewis Hamilton. That feels like one to watch over the remaining three races. Getty Images Lining up on the starting grid for the São Paulo Grand Prix, the track damp beneath him and the air heavy with the threat of rain, Max Verstappen knew how crucial this race would be. His championship lead had been eroded to just 44 points and his key title rival, Lando Norris, was starting a long way up the road.  Then one race, one performance, turned his year from an unraveling choke into the brink of another milestone.  It was a magical afternoon for Verstappen — and here you can enjoy our F1 correspondent, Luke Smith, putting it into context. GO FURTHER In Brazil, Max Verstappen produced his greatest F1 win — and closed in on another title Getty Images If Max Verstappen goes onto win his fourth drivers’ championship in Las Vegas — putting him behind only Michael Schumacher, Lewis Hamilton (both 7), and Juan Manuel Fangio (5) — then his efforts in the previous F1 grand prix will be bookmarked as a key moment in the season. The Dutchman started Brazil’s São Paulo Grand Prix from 17th on the grid, after a rain-affected qualifying just a few hours earlier.  From there, Verstappen produced a masterclass of driving to the conditions and finding the fastest way home. Indeed, he was in a class of one — and it showed. It wasn’t entirely all his own work though. Both George Russell and Lando Norris (or maybe this should read Mercedes and McLaren) managed to fluff promising positions to leave the door open for the lead Red Bull. And as we’ve all learned over recent seasons, if you leave a gap then Verstappen almost always takes it.  As for the rest of the podium, that was completed by a stunning race from Alpine who saw Esteban Ocon finish second and Pierre Gasly third — taking their constructors’ championship points tally from 14 to 49 in just one race.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"49ers' Brock Purdy, Nick Bosa ruled out vs. Packers; Brandon Allen to start at QB",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5941234/2024/11/22/49ers-brock-purdy-nick-bosa-out-packers/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 22:37:48 GMT","Kyle Shanahan on Brandon Allen: ""He’s done a really good job since he’s been here. Been here two years now and guys believe in him.”","NFL SANTA CLARA, Calif. — Brandon Allen, who’s had a single kneel-down snap in nearly two seasons with the San Francisco 49ers, will start Sunday’s critical game against the Green Bay Packers. Allen will make his first start for the 49ers because regular starter Brock Purdy could barely throw a ball this week after injuring his right shoulder in Sunday’s loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Advertisement Kyle Shanahan said Purdy had an MRI of the shoulder on Monday that revealed no obvious damage. The plan at that point was for him to take it easy in Wednesday’s practice — Purdy didn’t attempt any passes that day — and to ease back into his practice routine as the week went on. But when Purdy tried to throw on Thursday, the shoulder continued to bother him and he left the field early in the session. Shanahan said that until that point, the team thought Purdy would play in Green Bay. “We thought he just needed some rest and we really weren’t concerned about him not being good this week,” Shanahan said when asked if there was long-term concern. “But when he started up Thursday, it surprised him — surprised us — how it felt, so we had to shut him down. So I really don’t know what to think of it. The MRI doesn’t look (bad), so it should be all right. But the way it responded this week — it’s really up in the air for next week. We will have to see on Monday.” 49ers quarterbacks at the start of practice. Missing: Brock Purdy … pic.twitter.com/2p0k9NIIhU — Matt Barrows (@mattbarrows) November 22, 2024    Sunday’s game will be the first Purdy has missed due to injury since taking over as starter two-thirds of the way into the 2022 season. He nearly was scratched from his second career start that year after he broke a rib while diving for a first down in a win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Purdy has said he didn’t feel that injury initially. But as he cooled down over halftime, the pain and stiffness started to take over. He had a similar reaction to the shoulder injury. Shanahan said the quarterback didn’t know when it occurred but that the shoulder became more tight as the game went on. “That’s why he was warming up a lot more than usual,” he said. “He said he had a hard time keeping it loose. Then after the game is when it really started to hurt, and Monday morning is why we did an MRI for it.” Kyle Shanahan said they were surprised when Purdy had trouble throwing the ball on Thursday. ""We were fully prepared for Brock to go."" He said Purdy's shoulder started tightening up toward the end of the game and then grew more painful after the game. — Matt Barrows (@mattbarrows) November 22, 2024  Allen, meanwhile, served as Joe Burrow’s backup with the Cincinnati Bengals for three seasons before joining the 49ers last year. He entered the NFL as a sixth-round pick by the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2016 before moving on to the Los Angeles Rams (2017-18) and Denver Broncos (2019). In Cincinnati the next year, he was a popular presence in the locker room and a good, veteran sounding board for Burrow, a rookie in 2020. Advertisement The 49ers looked at Allen, 32, in a similar way — someone who would be a good resource for the inexperienced Purdy. Last year, Allen was the third quarterback behind Purdy and Sam Darnold. This year he competed with Joshua Dobbs in the spring and summer to be Purdy’s primary backup.
Dobbs seemed like the more aggressive thrower and was a decidedly more dangerous runner than Allen. He also had gaudier preseason statistics. He was 34 of 51 for 351 yards with one passing touchdown, one rushing touchdown and an interception while Allen was 19 of 30 for 194 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. The 49ers, however, preferred Allen’s command of the offense and have tapped him as their No. 2 in every game so far. Allen has played under Rams coach Sean McVay, former Broncos coordinator Rich Scangerello and Bengals coach Zac Taylor, all of whom run a variation of Shanahan’s system. “I think Brandon’s a really good thrower, runs our offense well,” Shanahan said. “He’s done a really good job since he’s been here. Been here two years now and guys believe in him.” The 49ers also like that Allen’s playing style is similar to Purdy’s and that the offense doesn’t change dramatically with Allen running it. “I know Brandon. I was with him in L.A.,” Packers coach Matt LaFleur noted on Friday. “He’s played, he’s been in the league now a long time. But I wouldn’t expect their offense to change a whole bunch.” Without Purdy, the 49ers may need to lean more heavily on a running game that ranks seventh in rushing yards per game but lacked its usual pop — especially on outside runs — in the last two contests. That coincided with Christian McCaffrey’s return to the lineup after a two-month absence due to Achilles tendonitis. McCaffrey also didn’t practice much in the offseason or in training camp and has acknowledged that he’s still getting back in the groove. His longest run in Week 10 was 13 yards. Against the Seahawks on Sunday, he had a long of 11 yards. Advertisement The rushing attack ought to be helped by George Kittle’s return. The team’s tight end — who’s essential on the stretch zone runs — missed Sunday’s game due to a hamstring strain but has said he’ll play in Green Bay and is not on the injury report. More tenuous is left tackle Trent Williams, who needed a pain-numbing injection to play against Seattle and who will be a game-time decision Sunday as well. Defensively, the 49ers will be without sack leader Nick Bosa, who exacerbated a hip/oblique injury against the Seahawks. Cornerback Charvarius Ward is not quite ready to play after missing the last three weeks to mourn the loss of his child while defensive tackle Kevin Givens (groin) and receiver Jacob Cowing (concussion) also will miss the game. At 5-5, the 49ers trail the 7-3 Packers — and three other teams — for the NFC’s final wild-card spot. They are one game behind the Arizona Cardinals (6-4) in the NFC West. They also have lost to each of their division opponents, putting them in a bad spot for division tiebreakers. “I mean, I think we’ve had a real good week of practice,” said Shanahan when asked about the daunting task of winning in Green Bay without Bosa and Purdy. “I know it’s disappointing,” he said. “We knew there was a chance that Nick (wouldn’t play). I think the guys were a little surprised with Brock yesterday, but we’re going to have 48 guys in uniform. I know the guys believe in themselves. I believe in them. We’re missing two good players, definitely. But we have a lot of good players. … We’re going to fight our tails off and I expect it to be a real good game.” (Photo: Thearon W.

Granted, the Raiders are last in the league in rushing, but some poor fantasy soul out there will be adding Ameer Abdullah to their roster. Advertisement Abdullah, a 10-year veteran, has 82 yards rushing on 17 carries on the season. He also has 17 receptions for 76 yards and scored on a 10-yard catch last week against the Miami Dolphins. Rookie Dylan Laube and second-year player Sincere McCormick would back Abdullah up. “I’m ready,” Abdullah said Wednesday. “I consider myself the best back on this team, like every back does, and this is my opportunity to go out there and put my best foot forward.”   Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.  Abdullah rushed for a career-high 597 yards in 2015, his rookie season with the Detroit Lions. With the Carolina Panthers in 2021, he established personal bests in receptions (35) and receiving yards (272). Abdullah’s best overall season came in 2017, when he had 552 rushing yards, 162 receiving yards and five total touchdowns for the Detroit Lions. He has long been a reliable pass-catching option out of the backfield during his time in the league with four teams — the Lions, Minnesota Vikings, Panthers and Raiders. The Raiders will also be without cornerbacks Jakorian Bennett (shoulder) and Nate Hobbs (ankle), while Jack Jones (back) is listed as questionable following a return to practice on Friday after missing sessions on Wednesday and Thursday. Center Andre James (ankle) has returned to practice this week but has seemingly lost his starting job to rookie Jackson Powers-Johnson.

Survivor Pools | Fantasy football player rankings Updated through 5:25 p.m. ET, Nov. 22 Sam Darnold, QB, Vikings (foot) — Expected to play
Darnold was limited in Wednesday’s practice due to a foot injury but is now off the injury report and is expected to play Isiah Pacheco, RB, Chiefs (ankle) — Out
Chiefs Head Coach Andy Reid ruled out Pacheco for Sunday’s game against the Panthers, giving Kareem Hunt at least one more week of solid fantasy value. Hunt has put up double-digit points in PPR leagues in all but two games this season, though he’s coming off a six-point effort in Kansas City’s Week 11 loss to the Bills. Mike Evans, WR, Buccaneers (hamstring) — Questionable
Evans returned to practice this week and was expected to return in Week 12. But he showed up on the injury report again on Friday and is now questionable. With Chris Godwin on injured reserve, Evans is only competing with TE Cade Otton to be QB Baker Mayfield’s top target. Tyreek Hill, WR, Dolphins (wrist) — Expected to play
Hill is expected to play while nursing a wrist injury that will likely ail him for the rest of the season. While Hill’s teammate Jaylen Waddle has had fantasy relevance in past seasons, he has not done well this year, scoring only 8.0 PPR points per game. Tight end Jonnu Smith, however, had 101 receiving yards on six receptions in Week 11 and finished with 28.1 PPR points, so look to him if you’re in need of a TE with so many teams on bye this week. D’Andre Swift, RB, Bears (groin) — Questionable
Swift practiced in full Friday but is questionable for Week 12. If he sits, Roschon Johnson becomes an intriguing fantasy play after getting 10 carries to Swift’s 14 in Week 11. Advertisement Keenan Allen, WR, Bears (ankle) — Questionable
Allen is questionable for Week 12 after he rolled his ankle during practice. According to Courtney Cronin of ESPN, the Bears are “hopeful” that Allen will play. If he can’t go, look for Rome Odunze and DJ Moore to see most of the receiving work. Caleb Williams played well under new offensive coordinator Thomas Brown. The rookie QB threw for 231 yards, completed 74.2 percent of his passes and did not throw an interception. Chicago receivers could see improved fantasy numbers with Brown calling plays. Jonathon Brooks, RB, Panthers (knee) — Expected to play
Panthers head coach Dave Canales said he “fully expects” Brooks to play in the Chiefs-Panthers matchup, according to Mike Kaye of The Charlotte Observer. For fantasy purposes, it will be important to monitor how many carries Brooks gets compared to Chuba Hubbard, who has been one of the few bright spots for Carolina this season. Hubbard has accumulated 942 yards from scrimmage and has been running efficiently with 5.1 yards per carry. Adam Thielen, WR, Panthers (hamstring) — Questionable
Jalen Coker, WR, Panthers (quadriceps) — Questionable
Thielen said he felt good about his early-week workout but still has to “gain some ground to feel really good about playing on Sunday,” according to Panthers’ reporter Kassidy Hill. Coker missed Friday’s practice. Xavier Legette may end up getting a lot of looks, but QB Bryce Young completed only 15 passes in Week 10 and only 16 in Week 9. Brandin Cooks, WR, Cowboys (knee) — Injured reserve
CeeDee Lamb, WR, Cowboys (back/foot) — Expected to play
With Cooper Rush under center, Cooks’ injury status is much less important to fantasy managers, but nonetheless, he was designated for return from injured reserve on Wednesday. Head coach Mike McCarthy said Cooks is getting close, according to The Athletic’s Saad Yousuf. Cooks will compete with Jalen Tolbert and maybe even new-addition Jonathan Mingo for targets, while Lamb remains the only receiver to trust on a weekly basis with Dallas playing so poorly. Jake Ferguson, TE, Cowboys (concussion) — Out
Ferguson has been ruled out for Week 12. Backup tight end Luke Schoonmaker had six receptions on 10 targets and 56 receiving yards in Week 11. If you’re desperate for a tight end with so many teams on bye this week, consider Schoonmaker and hope Rush goes 32-for-55 as he did in Week 11, rather than 13-for-23, as in Week 10. Advertisement Tyjae Spears, RB, Titans (concussion) — Out
Spears has been ruled out for the Titans matchup against Houston. While Tony Pollard stands to see a slight uptick in usage with Spears out, Tennessee’s leading rusher had only 44 rushing yards in Week 10 and 15 in Week 11. Calvin Ridley, WR, Titans (illness) — Expected to play
Ridley did not practice Wednesday due to illness but is expected to play. Nick Westbrook-Ikhine had a massive Week 11 with 117 receiving yards and a touchdown, but that came from only two receptions, which makes him a boom-or-bust option. NWI has scored over 10 PPR points in three of the past four weeks, but Ridley is the only dependable wide receiver in Tennessee with the Titans’ limited offensive production. Darius Slayton, WR, Giants (concussion) — Expected to play
Malik Nabers, WR, Giants (groin) — Questionable
Slayton practiced in full on Thursday and is expected to play. He hasn’t played since Week 9 but averaged 9.56 PPR points before then. Daniel Jones was benched for Tommy DeVito, but targets will likely be similarly dispersed. Malik Nabers is, by far, the most targeted Giants’ receiver at 11.75 targets per game, followed by Wan’Dale Robinson with 8.4 and Slayton with 5.56. Austin Seibert, K, Commanders (hip) — Questionable
Seibert was a limited participant in Thursday’s practice and is questionable for Week 12. Zane Gonzalez filled in for Seibert in Week 11 and made all three of his field goal attempts and was perfect on extra points. Zamir White, RB, Raiders (quadriceps) — Doubtful
Alexander Mattison, RB, Raiders (ankle) — Doubtful
Neither Mattison nor White practiced Thursday and are doubtful for Sunday’s afternoon game. Each of them had five carries, and while Mattison had more yards (19) than White (nine), the numbers don’t bode well for future fantasy production for either of these backs. How many ways are there to say the Raiders are just plain bad? Next up on the depth chart are Ameer Abdullah and Dylan Laube. MarShawn Lloyd, RB, Packers (appendicitis) — Out
Josh Jacobs, RB, Packers (quadriceps) — Questionable
Lloyd was reinstated from injured reserve but was placed on the non-football illness list Wednesday. Jacobs has been leading Green Bay’s backfield to the tune of 4.8 yards per carry, 838 rushing yards and 186 receiving yards this season. Even if Lloyd returns in 2024, his usage is difficult to predict given Jacobs’ success. If Jacobs cannot play in Week 12, Emanuel Wilson and Chris Brooks will likely share carries. George Kittle, TE, 49ers (hamstring) — Questionable
Kittle told reporters, “I will playing on Sunday, very excited, can’t pass up playing the Packers.” Kittle’s absence was felt in Week 11, and with the 49ers battling for a playoff bid, the situation seems right for Kittle’s return. Advertisement Brock Purdy, QB, 49ers (shoulder) — Out
Purdy was ruled out Friday ahead of the Niners big Sunday game against Green Bay. Purdy’s backup is Brandon Allen who has a career completion percentage of only 56.7 percent and hasn’t started and played a full game since 2021. It would not be surprising if RB Christian McCaffrey got the ball a lot. Like, a lot, a lot. Noah Fant, TE, Seahawks (groin) — Questionable
Fant hasn’t played since Week 8 and is questionable again heading into Week 12. Rookie AJ Barner started in Fant’s absence in Weeks 9 and 11 but totaled only 42 receiving yards on six receptions and 11 targets. Jalen Hurts, QB, Eagles (ankle) — Expected to play
Hurts was a limited participant early in the week which led to an injury report appearance, but he practiced Thursday and is expected to play. DeVonta Smith, WR, Eagles (hamstring) — Out
Smith has been ruled out for Week 12. He has struggled the past two weeks with only 10.3 PPR points in the two games combined, to go with a total of nine targets and six receptions. Outside of Smith and A.J. Brown, there are no other Philly receivers to roster, even if Smith sits. Jahan Dotson has averaged only 2.09 PPR points per game on an average of 1.7 targets. Ladd McConkey, WR, Chargers (shoulder) — Questionable
McConkey did not participate in practice on Thursday. If he can’t play, Quentin Johnston, Joshua Palmer and TE Will Dissly could see an uptick in usage. In Weeks 10 and 11 combined, Dissly led the Chargers with 12 targets; McConkey had 11, Johnston saw 10, and Palmer was targeted six times. Jake Ciely has McConkey as WR15 this week and Johnston as WR24. 
  Outdoor games only. Statistics in this section come from TruMedia.  The weather hasn’t impacted many games this season, but colder temperatures and precipitation await, as seen in Thursday night’s game. According to Rotowire, the Cardinals-Seahawks matchup on Sunday comes with an expected temperature of 49 degrees and a 63 percent chance of rain. Advertisement Arizona Cardinals (6-4) vs. Seattle Seahawks (5-5) Kyler Murray has played in two regular-season rain games, and his completion percentage for those contests is 67.9 percent, compared to a career regular-season total of 66.9 percent without rain. Don’t get too excited. Beyond the small sample, in those two games he threw for only one touchdown and averaged only 159 passing yards per game. Geno Smith’s career numbers in the rain: A completion percentage of 55.6, four touchdowns and five interceptions on 6.5 yards per attempt in five rainy games. Without rain, Smith’s numbers are vastly different. His completion percentage rises to 64.6 percent, yards per attempt to 7.2, and his TD-to-interception ratio is 1.4. Teams typically move toward run-heavy gameplans with precipitation, and Arizona has the tools to do it. James Conner leads a backfield that also includes Trey Benson and Emari Demercado (questionable). Murray, too, gets yards with his legs and has 371 of them on the season already. The Cardinals average a whopping 5.2 yards per carry (second in the league) for 1,494 team rushing yards (sixth), while the Seahawks rank 26th in opponents yards per rush (4.8). Conner may exceed expectations this week. The Seahawks haven’t fared as well this year with a backfield led by Kenneth Walker III. Walker has gained over 100 yards on the ground only once this year, averaging 56.5 rushing yards per game. His rush EPA is -2.82 (compared to Conner’s 0.29) and ranks 27th out of 28 among backs with over 100 carries. But Arizona’s run defense is certainly not intimidating, allowing 127.5 yards per game (19th) and 4.5 yards per carry (21st). Wondering what the weather impact is on fantasy production? Jake Ciely has you covered like a poncho in rainy season.
 Game-specific previews and live updates are available on the day of the game. San Francisco 49ers (5-5) vs. Green Bay Packers (7-3) The Green Bay Packers are slight home favorites in their Week 12 contest against the San Francisco 49ers. Coming off a 1-point win against the Bears — secured in the final seconds by a blocked field goal — the Packers weren’t exactly dominant against a struggling Chicago team last week. The Niners are coming off a 20-17 loss to Seattle (who had lost five of their previous six games) and are in a very tight NFC West race that has the 6-4 Cardinals on top. Jordan Love and Brock Purdy have become franchise quarterbacks over the past two seasons, however the Niners will be without Purdy Sunday. Love ranks 30th in completion percentage this season, one spot below recently released Giants QB Daniel Jones. Luckily for Love, he has a receiver ranked in the top five in passer rating when targeted (minimum of 35 touches). Jayden Reed tops the list at 146.0. Read the full preview (coming Sunday).  Philadelphia Eagles (8-2) vs. Los Angeles Rams (5-5) The Philadelphia Eagles are favored on the road against the Los Angeles Rams in this NFC matchup. The Rams are coming off a narrow 28-22 victory against New England. After a disappointing 9.7 fantasy point performance in Week 10, Matthew Stafford bounced back with 295 passing yards and four TDs against the Patriots. Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua each had over 100 yards receiving and scored (Kupp had two TDs; Nacua had one). Advertisement Led by QB Jalen Hurts, the Eagles boast two talented receivers of their own, A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith. But Philadelphia has Saquon Barkley, and the Rams do not, and at 273.1 yards allowed per game, the Eagles defense is a force. In contrast, the Rams D sits at 23rd, allowing 350.6 yards per game. Week 12 presents the perfect opportunity for Smith to return to fantasy relevance after Weeks 10 and 11, when he scored 3.4 and 6.9 PPR points, respectively. Read the full preview (coming Sunday).   Baltimore Ravens (7-4) vs. Los Angeles Chargers (7-3) Coming off a tough Week 11 loss to the Steelers, the Ravens are favored by less than a field goal on the road against the Chargers in this AFC matchup that has head coaches Jim and John Harbaugh meeting for the first time since Super Bowl XLVII. The Jim Harbaugh-led Chargers have been rolling lately. Justin Herbert is throwing more and ranks sixth in passer rating (102.1), J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards are handling backfield work, and Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston lead the Chargers’ wide receivers in targets, receiving yards and yards after the catch. Lamar Jackson has had an MVP season for Baltimore (excluding last week’s poor performance), but Derrick Henry has taken a step back lately with under 80 net yards in three of his last four games. Zay Flowers continues to impress (though somewhat inconsistently), while Diontae Johnson has become a fantasy drop, averaging two targets and 0.5 receptions per game. The Chargers defense is tough, and Tuli Tuipulotu has led the NFL over the past three weeks with six sacks, but Jackson has the third-most time to throw in the league. This Harbaugh brothers matchup is full of talent and intrigue. Read the full preview (coming Monday). 
 Statistics in this section come from TruMedia.  Austin Mock scours his weekly projections to spot the top values on the board. Bet picked Thursday: Minnesota Vikings -3 (-115) at Chicago Bears Caleb Williams and this Bears offense looked a lot better last week after making a change at offensive coordinator. Unfortunately for them, the Vikings’ defense is much better than the Packers’ and defensive coordinator Brian Flores getting to face a rookie quarterback is quite the bad matchup. I do have concerns about this Vikings offense since the loss of left tackle Christian Darrisaw, but they should have enough to complement their dominant defense. Advertisement Worst price to bet: Vikings -3 (-115) — Mock See all of Mock’s best bets for Week 12. 
 A weekly guide to staying alive from Renee Miller and Adam Gretz. Odds from BetMGM as of Thursday. Question from Melissa: “Six people left. What’s the best plan for the next two weeks: Kansas City (at Carolina), then Minnesota (vs. Arizona); Miami (vs. New England), then Kansas City (vs. Las Vegas); Houston (vs. Tennessee), then Kansas City (vs. Las Vegas)? Most others left in the pool have already used Kansas City and Miami, if that matters.” Congratulations on making it this far! As tempting as it would be to pick Kansas City this week, I would skip the first option because I simply do not trust the Minnesota vs. Arizona game next week. I think the Cardinals are probably pretty legit, and even if they don’t outright beat the Vikings, I could see that being a game you have to sweat through. Plus, I think Kansas City should win the next two games, and both matchups are very favorable. There’s nothing wrong with saving the Chiefs for that game against a very bad Raiders team. Now, the question comes down to Miami or Houston this week. Honestly? I like both of them; they are my picks for the week. If you had to ask me to pick one emphatically and with the most confidence, I would go with Houston. I cannot see the Titans going on the road and beating the Texans, especially with a healthy Nico Collins back in the lineup. You could probably argue that if everybody has already used Kansas City and Miami, they might take Houston this week, so it might make sense to try countering that by taking Miami.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Eagles rule out star WR DeVonta Smith for ‘Sunday Night Football’ showdown vs. Rams,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5941278/2024/11/22/eagles-devonta-smith-out-rams/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 22:15:09 GMT",DeVonta Smith will miss his second game of the 2024 season on Sunday.,"NFL The Philadelphia Eagles will be without star wide receiver DeVonta Smith for “Sunday Night Football” against the Los Angeles Rams at SoFi Stadium, the team announced Friday. Smith’s designation is unsurprising given that he did not practice all week due to a hamstring injury. But the news confirms the Eagles will be without one of their top receivers yet again, with Smith and A.J. Brown now having missed multiple games. Smith will be sidelined for the second time after previously missing Week 4 with a concussion, while Brown missed three games, including Week 4, earlier this season. Friday's Injury Report#PHIvsLAR pic.twitter.com/hEyV5JAj0Q — Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) November 22, 2024  The Eagles offense was mostly inefficient in its three games without Brown and Smith. They went 1-2 while failing to score in the first quarter in each game. They relied more heavily on running back Saquon Barkley and did not have their best matchup winner available to capitalize on the passing opportunities Barkley created. Advertisement Smith’s absence has a different impact on the passing game. He’s been quarterback Jalen Hurts’ most reliable target over the middle, and his proficiency to create separation on slants and gain explosive yardage after the catch won’t be easily replaced. It’s possible receiver Britain Covey (shoulder) could help fulfill Smith’s role in Week 12. Covey’s 21-day practice window opened up earlier this week, and he was a full participant in each practice. The team listed him as questionable for Sunday’s matchup. (Photo: Luke Hales / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Kane scored all three goals in the match as Bayern beat Augsburg at home following the international break. In doing so, the England captain surpassed a record previously set by Erling Haaland when he was at Borussia Dortmund. The Norwegian scored his 50th Bundesliga goal in his 50th game in the league in November 2021, beating Timo Konietzka’s previous record by nine matches. Advertisement Kane has been in imperious form since joining Bayern from Tottenham Hotspur in the summer of 2023 and it took him only 43 games to score 50 goals in the German top flight. The 31-year-old has also registered 14 assists in those matches. Despite Kane’s 36 league goals — 44 in all competitions — last season, Bayern ended the campaign trophyless, finishing third and 18 points behind the undefeated champions Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga. This term, Bayern themselves are undefeated after 11 games with nine wins and two draws, with Friday’s win putting them eight points ahead of second-placed RB Leipzig, who play on Saturday. GO DEEPER Are Bayern Munich any good under Vincent Kompany? Analysis by German football writer Sebastian Stafford-Bloor The context for this achievement is that, for 15 months, Kane has been scoring goals at a record-breaking rate for a Bayern team that has not always functioned particularly well. Yes, they had moments of power under Thomas Tuchel and now Vincent Kompany, but nothing compared with the dominance they enjoyed in previous eras. Kane has been one of the few parts of the team that has worked consistently, scoring goals through force of will at times. He still faces criticism. The week before the October international break, he and Bayern suffered a frustrating week, drawing at home to Leverkusen, losing away to Aston Villa and then losing a stoppage time lead to draw 3-3 with Eintracht Frankfurt. Kane failed to score in all of those games and, in their aftermath, the German media came as close to rounding on him. Who cares about goals against Holstein Kiel and Bochum? That was the gist. Augsburg are not a Bundesliga big beast so, most likely, this latest treble — two penalties and a late, scruffy third — will not draw much attention on its own. But, as he did last season, Kane is scoring goals in an imperfect side, within which he is still finding a balance between dropping deep and leading the line. Has he been at most fluent? Not really, but he also leads the side in assists this year and that currency — his literal contribution — is really all that matters at Allianz Arena. Advertisement What a luxury for Kompany, too. Several parts of this Bayern side are undergoing renovation. Jamal Musiala has played sensationally well at times, but the defence remains a work in progress, the midfield is missing Aleksandar Pavlovic and Joao Palinha, and — before this season — Kingsley Coman and Serge Gnabry had both suffered plummets in form. But the steady beat of Kane’s goalscoring has helped the side develop confidence and authority this season, helping also to inspire individual improvements. Gnabry and Coman are revived. Leon Goretzka provided a beautiful assist for Kane’s hat-trick goal on Friday and cracked a smile for what seemed like the first time this season. These things matter. Has Kane been a success yet? By his own admission, not until he wins something. After all, he broke plenty of records at Spurs and that was never enough for him. But he is certainly doing his part in leading Bayern towards their broader aims and living up his side of that €100million (now $104m) deal.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Yankees’ Aaron Judge on Juan Soto pursuit: ‘He knows how we feel about him’,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5941279/2024/11/22/yankees-aaron-judge-juan-soto-free-agency/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 22:04:02 GMT",Soto finished third in AL MVP ballots after a landmark season hitting in front of Judge.,"MLB Aaron Judge said he hasn’t spoken to Juan Soto since the New York Yankees lost in the World Series in late October, but he’s come up in conversation with owner Hal Steinbrenner. “He knows how we feel about him,” Judge said. Judge, the team captain and two-time MVP, added he wouldn’t care whether the Yankees give Soto — just 26 years old — a bigger contract than the $360 million, nine-year deal he signed before the 2023 season. Advertisement “It ain’t my money,” Judge said. “I really don’t care. As long as we get the best players and the most we can, I’m happy with whatever.” Judge was speaking with members of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America via conference call Friday afternoon, the day after it unanimously voted him the American League MVP. The 32-year-old put up another historic season, posting a 218 wRC+ — the highest ever recorded by a right-handed hitter in either league. Judge also clobbered an MLB-best 58 home runs and 144 RBIs while hitting .322. Judge said he preferred his 2024 campaign over the run he had when he earned his first MVP in 2022. “One thing I tried to focus on a lot going into ’24, especially when you’ve got Juan Soto hitting in front of you and he’s going to be on base a lot, it’s just capitalizing with guys on base and trying to get the RBI count as high as you can, and if you’re able to do that, we’re going to put ourselves in a good position going into the postseason,” Judge said. “I would say I liked ’24 a little better, I think.” The Unanimous MVP: @TheJudge44 👨‍⚖️ pic.twitter.com/IYK9VJnepc — New York Yankees (@Yankees) November 22, 2024  Judge said he hadn’t reached out to Soto because he wanted to give him space and that he “talked to him all season.” The Dominican Republic-born star is poised to receive perhaps the richest free-agent contract in history. The Athletic’s Tim Britton projected he could strike a deal worth $611 million over 13 seasons. Soto has already met with the Yankees, New York Mets, Boston Red Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers and the Philadelphia Phillies. Formal offers could start to roll in as early as next week, a league source said. Judge added that immediately after the season ended, he spent about a week in Tampa, Fla., where the team has its player development complex. He met with Steinbrenner, offering his opinions on players the Yankees should consider pursuing. The pair also brought up Soto. Judge said he’s enjoyed becoming involved in the club’s decision-making process and consulting with Steinbrenner. ﻿ “When we first met when I was a free agent at the end of ’22, that’s one of the first things he said: ‘Hey, I want to build a relationship with you and have you be a part of this. You’re going to be here for however long your contract is going to be. You’re going to be a Yankee for life,'” Judge said. “He really opened it up to be that if I had any input and feelings about things — he’s not down in the clubhouse and on the field every single day. Advertisement “I just think having that relationship to where I can communicate with him about what I’m seeing, what I’m feeling and what I see with the guys, what I see with other guys we play against, I love it. I think it’s a cool part. I think the more communication you have from top to bottom, it just makes everybody better just being honest with each other.” Judge also discussed what it was like having Soto hitting in front of him in the lineup. Soto finished third in the MVP race, just behind shortstop Bobby Witt of the Kansas City Royals. “You look at the Dodgers lineup where you have their first three guys are MVPs,” Judge said. “You’re going through three tough at-bats back-to-back-to-back there. I think having a chance for Juan to hit in front of me, I get to see a lot of pitches. He’s going to be a tough at-bat in front of me. He’s going to wear down the pitcher right there in the first inning. I think that was a big impact, having a guy like that in front of you. “If I could have eight Juan Sotos in the lineup with me, I would love that.” As for what Judge hopes for Soto? “I think the most important thing is to now let him do his thing with his family, pray about it, talk with people and come to the right decision for him and his family,” he said.

Sign up here to receive Prime Tire directly in your inbox. Welcome back to Prime Tire, where we’re wondering if we have time for a joke in this section oh wait we don’t aw shucks. I’m Patrick, my writers are at the Las Vegas GP, we have some breaking news and let’s get to it. Late (and I mean late) last night, news broke that General Motors is edging toward securing a place on the Formula One grid with its own team as early as 2026 when the field could expand to 11 teams. The news was first reported by the Associated Press. What you need to know: It’s not a lot to go on, but you can read our story here. We detailed Andretti’s ongoing effort to join F1 a few months ago. I’m sure there will be plenty more to say about this over the next few weeks. For now, on to Las Vegas … 2023 was about taking in the race’s spectacle. We entered the 2024 race week hoping to dig deeper, report on some questions we and our readers had. Here is how we’ve fared so far: How does F1 get the Strip ready for racing? Are local businesses upset with the disruption? How does F1 book celebrities at a race like this? Can you watch the race without emptying your savings? Of course, we’re still reporting all around the track on some fun stories this weekend. Make sure to check on our page every day. Now, let’s throw it to Luke and Madeline in the paddock. Before F1 got on track on Thursday in Las Vegas, I had an entertaining time finding out about F1’s new partnership with Lego, which will see a new range of products released in early 2025. The range will cover all ages of Lego products, from Duplo sets for the youngest children to the adult specialist sets that run into thousands of pieces. But importantly, the Speed Champions range will feature all 10 cars — and, impressively, they’re actually all designed differently after close collaboration between the teams and the Lego designers working on the sets. I got a first-hand look at the products today, and you can spot the differences: the Sauber has a double rear wing pylon, and the McLaren’s sidepods are unique. Even the Red Bull has its high shoulders on the engine cover. It made me feel like a big kid, but it also pushed home just how creative F1 has become in its partnership and bits to expand its audience. If kids can get their hands on F1 cars in Lego form from age three and work their way up, it could help turn them into fans for life. Pat note: Check out The Athletic‘s holiday gift guide! After any long-form story, the writer will likely have a notebook full of unused facts and quotes that did not quite fit the theme or final story word count. I wrote an in-depth story about the history of Tommy Hilfiger and F1, which ran earlier this week, and gosh, do I have so much to tell y’all. During his partnership with Lotus, the designer realized there was a market for F1 team uniforms among fans. Advertisement “My gut instinct told me that people would think it would be cool to wear the uniforms, and it may have come from my love for sports uniforms,” Hilfiger said. “Growing up, I worked in a sporting goods shop, and I was handling a lot of the uniforms for the football teams, the basketball teams, the hockey teams, the soccer teams. And in those days, the way they made uniforms was much different. They made them out of a high level quality fabrication. The numbers were stitched on in satin. They didn’t have tech fabrics then, like we have today. “But the football uniforms, basketball uniforms, baseball uniforms were made of a different type of material than you would find in sort of normal clothing. And when I started my brand, I took that inspiration and incorporated it into what I was designing. So when we started coming out with sportier looking clothes, they were very authentically built.” We were talking last night about how different Wednesday practice felt from a year ago, when a water valve cover threw the night into disarray. (Don’t worry, that should be fixed.) Instead, the running last night was relatively … boring? No incidents. Just cars rubbering in the track. The crowd even thinned out midway through FP2. (It was past midnight.) Mercedes led both sessions, but I wouldn’t place bets based on that. We should see Ferrari, Red Bull and McLaren establishing themselves tonight for FP3 and qualifying.

""A lot of people are going to have a great holiday because of this,"" Pat Riley said.","NBA NBA teams enjoy showing appreciation to their fan bases, particularly when it’s holiday time. Few teams in sports support their communities more fervently than the Miami Heat, who hosted their 33rd annual Thanksgiving Celebration on Thursday. The team collaborated with organizations to distribute 600 Thanksgiving baskets and also give 450 hot meals to underserved families throughout Miami-Dade County. Advertisement It’s hard for NBA teams to maximize five consecutive off days, but the Heat (6-7) found some solace in giving back and honing its relationship with the fans. Miami hasn’t played since Monday and won’t suit up again until Sunday. “There actually have been a lot of tears — tears of joy, tears of gratitude,” Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra said Thursday. “This is our 33rd year doing this. … It’s turned into more than it was 33 years ago. Now, it’s a festive party. “This is our backyard here, and to share on a day like this really is amazing.” Among other Heat luminaries in attendance: three-time All-Star Bam Adebayo, team president Pat Riley and Heat stalwarts Alonzo Mourning and Bob McAdoo.

The biggest thing I learned about U.D. (Udonis Haslem): He was always on the frontline when he does community work. I feel like that’s the biggest representation you can have — you being there.” At this time of the year — between the dishes, high-spirited crowds and charitable moments — what was the best moment of the entire afternoon? Advertisement Riley, who earlier this week learned the Los Angeles Lakers will honor him with a statue, reflected on how important it is for Heat culture to be an extension of the NBA community, no matter the fan base or location. “I think it’s important for any organization, any business,” Riley said. “You create an environment in which everybody can flourish, and that becomes a shared vision within the organization. That doesn’t mean that a lot of people sometimes don’t agree with it, but everybody gets on board, and that’s what the important thing is. “The NBA is a giving league. I think every franchise — from the front office right on down to the players association — has this kind of spirit in their communities. … A lot of people are going to have a great holiday because of this.” On Sunday, the Heat will host the Dallas Mavericks (8-7) in their first game since Monday’s double-digit win over the Philadelphia 76ers. The Heat have played only five home games thus far, the fewest in the NBA. They’re aiming to reach .500 again but have won three of of their last five. The biggest key to Miami’s turnaround? Since Nov. 10, the Heat are fifth in defensive rating after ranking 20th. They will seek to either maintain or improve that footing against Dallas, which will be without Luka Dončić, who is expected to miss at least the next week with a wrist injury. Dallas enters this matchup with three consecutive wins after losing a season-worst four straight. The Mavericks rank seventh in overall net rating despite being a game over .500. Last season, the Heat lost both regular-season meetings, including a 19-point loss the last time the Mavericks visited South Florida. Dončić and teammate Kyrie Irving combined for 54 points in that matchup, and the latter should be comfortable picking up the slack Sunday. Irving is second on his team in points per game (24.3) and is enjoying the most efficient season of his career (career-high 54.5 percent shooting, 53.8 percent from 3). Such potency undoubtedly will test Miami’s improved defense. Advertisement That could be an opportunity for either Jimmy Butler or Tyler Herro to carry Miami’s offense and avoid the game getting out of hand. Butler recently returned from a four-game absence with 30 points and 10 rebounds. In the two losses to Dallas last season, he averaged only 13 points. Herro is maintaining a career-high 24.2 points-per-game average, but he is shooting only 40.8 percent in his last three games. After Monday’s win, Butler jokingly called himself and Herro “1A and 1B” in terms of Miami’s scoring hierarchy. If both players catch fire on Sunday, it can help Miami reach .500 again, and the team (and its fans) could have a bit more to be grateful for as the holiday season unfolds.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman says league's organizational values will not change under Trump presidency,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940820/2024/11/22/nwsl-trump-commissioner-berman/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:11:09 GMT",Women’s soccer has been subject to President-elect Trump’s attention over the last two World Cup cycles.,"NWSL KANSAS CITY — NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman said that the league would prioritize its organizational values, in response to a question from The Athletic regarding the potential impacts of the incoming Trump administration on women’s health and LGBTQ+ rights and possible immigration policy changes. Advertisement “Whether [Donald] Trump is the president or Kamala [Harris] was president, we’re committed to the values of the league, and we stand for inclusivity, excellence and unity,” she said Friday during a press conference at CPKC Stadium ahead of Saturday’s NWSL Championship between the Orlando Pride and Washington Spirit. “We’re going to continually live by our values and support everyone in our ecosystem, inclusive of our fans, our players, our employees, in every community where we operate.” President-elect Trump has pledged multiple times through this campaign to “keep men out of women’s sports,” which has been a recurring platform at all levels of the Republican party during this election cycle. However, Trump has not provided specifics on what steps he would take. “You just ban it,” he said during a Fox News town hall in October. “The president bans it. You just don’t let it happen.” There has been an increase in bills from Republicans that would limit the participation of transgender athletes in sports across the United States, but so far, they have largely targeted youth sports. The NWSL issued a policy on transgender and nonbinary athlete participation in 2021, which begins with the guiding principle of “creating a safe, non-discriminatory and inclusive environment for all of its athletes while maintaining competitive equity throughout the league.” The policy does allow challenges to an athlete’s eligibility under the policy, though the league states it “will only consider requests that are reasonable and made in good faith.” According to the league’s eligibility guidelines, any athlete assigned female at birth is eligible to play in the league, while those who are designated female at birth who are transitioning to male and are undergoing testosterone hormone therapy are ineligible to compete in the NWSL, unless their hormone levels fall under certain levels. Advertisement Athletes who transition from male to female are eligible to compete if their total testosterone level is within the typical limits of women athletes over a set period. The NWSL currently only has one out transgender player, who was assigned female at birth and who identifies as nonbinary. Berman did not offer specifics when asked about whether the league has plans to handle possible issues around immigration policy changes and how, or if, international players could be affected. Over the last two World Cup cycles, women’s soccer has been subject to Trump’s attention. While he has largely focused on the now-retired U.S. women’s national team and Reign player Megan Rapinoe in 2019 and 2023, he has also been highly critical of the U.S. women’s team. Following the USWNT’s exit from the 2023 World Cup in a penalty shoot-out with Sweden, Trump posted on Truth Social that the loss was “fully emblematic of what is happening to our once great Nation under Crooked Joe Biden.” “Many of our players were openly hostile to America — No other country behaved in such a manner, or even close,” he added. On Friday, Berman did not provide much in the way of specifics of any potential additional protections the league would put in place for players or staff, especially in the context of a player having been criticized previously. “We’re committed to ensuring that our players and our staff get all of their needs met, whether that’s healthcare, other protections around mental health — any support that anyone needs in our ecosystem,” Berman said.

A 12-person jury in the High Court in Dublin rendered the verdict after six hours of deliberation, the AP reported. The woman accused McGregor of raping her at a Dublin hotel on Dec. 9, 2018, saying the assault after a night of partying left her bruised and caused her to develop post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the AP. Advertisement McGregor denied the allegations, testifying he never forced the woman to do anything against her will. McGregor said the two engaged in consensual sex, per the AP. McGregor did not comment as he left the courtroom, but posted on X that he would be appealing the decision. I will be appealing today's decision. The judge's instruction and the modest award given was for assault, not for aggravated or exemplary damages. I am disappointed that the jury did not hear all the evidence that the DPP reviewed. I am with my family now, focused on my future.… — Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) November 22, 2024  Attorneys for both McGregor and the woman did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Athletic. The woman gave a brief statement outside the court Friday. The Athletic does not typically name victims or potential victims of sexual assault. “To all the victims of sexual assault, I hope my story is a reminder that no matter how afraid you might be, speak up, you have a voice, and keep on fighting for justice,” she said, according to BBC. “I know this has impacted not only my life, my daughter’s, my family and friends, tremendously, and it’s something that I’ll never forget for the rest of my life. But now that justice has been served, I can now try to move on and look forward to the future with my family and friends and daughter.” In court, the woman testified that McGregor put her in a chokehold and threatened to kill her during the incident, per the AP. Her lawyer said McGregor was angry about a fight he lost in Las Vegas in October 2018. McGregor said in his testimony that the woman’s story was untrue. McGregor is not facing criminal charges in the case. Police investigated, but prosecutors declined to bring charges, the AP reported. McGregor lost that 2018 bout to Khabib Nurmagomedov, who submitted McGregor with a choke. The caustic atmosphere surrounding the fight sparked a melee outside the octagon immediately after it was finished, and eventually led to suspensions for Nurmagomedov and McGregor. Since then, the 36-year-old McGregor has fought three times in UFC. His scheduled fight against Michael Chandler in June was canceled due to an injury, which McGregor said then “required more time to heal than was available to me.” McGregor, a former two-division champion, hasn’t fought since breaking his leg in the first round of a loss to Dustin Poirier in 2021. He has not won a bout since January 2020. The UFC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Photo: David Fitzgerald / Sportsfile via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Even if they thought he could fill a role as a lefty-mashing corner outfielder in 2025, they were not in a position to commit nearly $6 million to Hays without knowing the composition of the entire outfield. Advertisement So that closed the book on a rather forgettable summer trade by president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski, who acquired Hays for a reliever (Seranthony Domínguez) whom Baltimore deemed worthy of exercising an $8 million option for next season. Domínguez had fallen down the Phillies’ trust tree. But Hays never cracked it. A team source confirmed Hays’ departure, which was first reported by the New York Post. The Phillies envisioned Hays as an everyday player when they acquired him in late July. Numerous injuries derailed any chance of him contributing down the stretch. He went 0-for-3 with two strikeouts in the only postseason game he started. The Phillies could have aimed higher at last season’s trade deadline, although very few “impact-type” hitters were moved. They took a smaller gamble to fill a specific role. It flopped. The next outfield transactions have become important. Dombrowski resisted an external addition at the trade deadline in 2023, did not pursue an outfielder to supplement the same group between the 2023 and 2024 seasons, then failed to land a suitable platoon partner for Brandon Marsh in the summer. How they’ll remake the outfield remains a great unknown. The free-agent market, outside of Juan Soto, is not teeming with answers. The Phillies have not met with Soto’s camp, according to major-league sources. They are interested. Even if they meet and submit an offer later this offseason, they are not considered frontrunners to land him. The center field pool is barren. The Phillies might return to a Marsh platoon with Johan Rojas there. Free-agent corner mashers such as Teoscar Hernández and Anthony Santander would be power upgrades but come with high swing-and-miss rates. The Phillies have an aggressive lineup and are looking for a better balance to it. Advertisement This is why they have been more active in pursuing trades, though nothing has yet to materialize. The Phillies, according to multiple major-league sources, have made Nick Castellanos available in trade talks. They’ve shopped numerous players — namely Alec Bohm and Ranger Suárez — to gauge other clubs’ interest. All things considered, it’s not shocking they would be open to moving Castellanos. But a trade is not likely unless the Phillies eat a large chunk of the remaining $40 million on Castellanos’ contract. That would defeat one purpose of trading him elsewhere. Castellanos, for his flaws, has been available to play. He’s started 452 of a possible 486 regular-season games since joining the Phillies in 2022. That counts. The Phillies have ruled out a return to the outfield for Bryce Harper, who has found a home at first base. Their best outfield prospect, Justin Crawford, could use another year of development. The Phillies, according to major-league sources, have not excluded Crawford from trade talks. He would be moved only for a big-league player with multiple years of club control. Whenever the Phillies have faced offseason conundrums, their best solution has been to throw money at them. It might not be that simple this time. These are different challenges for Dombrowski — none more perplexing than the outfield.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Giants release Daniel Jones: What it means for N.Y. and what comes next for the QB,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940785/2024/11/22/ny-giants-daniel-jones-release-qb/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 19:04:39 GMT","“Daniel came to see me this morning and asked if we would release him. We mutually agreed that would be best for him and for the team.""","NFL By Charlotte Carroll, Dan Duggan and Lauren Smith The New York Giants have released quarterback Daniel Jones, the team announced Friday. “Daniel came to see me this morning and asked if we would release him,” Giants president John Mara said in a statement. “We mutually agreed that would be best for him and for the team. Advertisement “Daniel has been a great representative of our organization, first class in every way. His handling of this situation yesterday exemplifies just that. We are all disappointed in how things have worked out. We hold Daniel in high regard and have a great appreciation for him. We wish him nothing but the best in the future.” Brian Daboll met with #giants team and informed them of Daniel Jones release before it went public and before today’s practice “This is not an easy thing” pic.twitter.com/fmM3wcrWo7 — Charlotte Carroll (@charlottecrrll) November 22, 2024  Jones, in his sixth season with the Giants after the team drafted him No. 6 overall in 2019, was benched Monday following the Giants’ 2-8 start to the season, during which he completed 63.3 percent of his passes for 2,070 yards, eight touchdowns and seven interceptions through 10 games. GO DEEPER Giants benching QB Daniel Jones, Tommy DeVito taking over as starter The 27-year-old quarterback has played in 70 games for New York the past six seasons, throwing for 14,582 yards with 70 touchdowns and 47 interceptions and tallying a 64.1 completion percentage. Jones seemed to foreshadow his release when he spoke with reporters following Thursday’s practice. “The opportunity to play for the New York Giants was truly a dream come true. I’m extremely grateful to the Mara and Tisch families for the chance to play here,” he said. “No one wanted to win more games worse than me. I gave everything I had on the field and in preparation. Of course, this season has been disappointing for all and, of course, I wish I could have done more. I’m 100% accountable for my part. I did not play well enough, consistently enough to help the team get (good) results.” GO DEEPER Giants QB Daniel Jones addresses benching, bids farewell to fans Jones will go on waivers following his release and is unlikely to be claimed by another team with $13.8 million of guaranteed money remaining on his contract. Jones signed a four-year, $160 million extension with the Giants ahead of the 2023 season. To answer the most common questions I’m seeing:  • No impact on the Giants’ cap whether they released him now or after the season.  • Jones can sign with another team immediately after he clears waivers (he’ll clear waivers). — Dan Duggan (@DDuggan21) November 22, 2024  Players who clear waivers become free agents, and Jones could have some intriguing options once he hits the open market. He could try to sign on with a playoff-caliber team in need of a quality backup. He also could try to go to a place where he might have a chance to start again this year (Jacksonville?). Or perhaps he’ll seek out a team where he could “audition” to be the team’s quarterback in 2025 (Las Vegas?). Of course, Jones could also choose to take some time away from football before picking his next destination this offseason. Cowboys EVP Stephen Jones said on @SASportsStar that they have no interest in adding former Giants QB Daniel Jones. “No, I think we’re in good shape at our quarterback spot. We think Cooper (Rush) gives us the best chance to win right now. And certainly we still want to see… — Jon Machota (@jonmachota) November 22, 2024  The Giants, who have lost their past five games, host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 12 and will move forward with a new starter at quarterback. Giants coach Brian Daboll announced Monday, after the team’s Week 11 bye, the Giants would make a change and will start Tommy DeVito on Sunday. “After evaluating and watching a lot of tape, that’s the reason we are going with Tommy,” Daboll said. “Drew Lock will be the backup. This was a necessary move for us, and I’m looking forward to working with Tommy, and he’ll be ready to go against Tampa Bay.” Advertisement My read on Daniel Jones’ release: It’s mutually beneficial, but the Giants weren’t going to make the first move. If Jones was fine showing up every day and going through the motions as QB4, they would have gone along with that. But once he asked out, they (obviously) were going to grant that wish. — Dan Duggan, Giants beat writer GO DEEPER Is Daniel Jones now QB4 on Giants depth chart? Drew Lock 'upset' he wasn't named starter Both the Giants and Jones will get a much-needed fresh start with the QB’s release. The Giants will close out the season with DeVito and Lock, but the focus now shifts to who will be the next face of the franchise. Right now, the Giants are No. 3 in the NFL Draft, per Tankathon. For now, there are three other two-win teams. The Giants would never openly tank, but in what’s supposed to be a less top-heavy QB draft, higher draft order could be paramount in finding Jones’ successor. While New York moves on, Jones finally can, too. When asked Thursday about the possibility of being released and playing with another team before season’s end, Jones said he was still focused on the Giants. He said he was “still processing and trying to think through what the best thing is for this team and what the best thing is for me.” If Daniel Jones is not claimed, a team could sign him after 4 PM on Monday. A more realistic scenario would be signing him on Tuesday or Wednesday.  He could also wait for a QB desperate team to bring him on. — Dianna Russini (@DMRussini) November 22, 2024  But now, the reality is Jones could play elsewhere. The question is, will he decide to do that and with which team? Some of the teams floating around social media that present the most intriguing options since they’re on the Giants’ remaining schedule: the Dallas Cowboys (Dak Prescott is out for the year and backup Cooper Rush has been struggling) and the Philadelphia Eagles (final game of the year where starters could potentially sit as the Eagles go on a playoff hunt). There are obviously other potential pairings, but those two present the most Shakespearean twists. — Charlotte Carroll, Giants beat writer Advertisement There is no impact for the Giants by releasing Jones now or after the season, since they’ll have plenty of cap space in 2025. The only possible cap impacts would be if the Giants waited until post-June 1 to make a cut, as The Athletic’s Dan Duggan noted. By doing so, the team would push $11.1 million in dead money to 2026. But the Giants wouldn’t have been able to spend that money until June, meaning they couldn’t have used those extra dollars in free agency when they matters most. Instead, the full $22.2 million in dead money goes into the 2025 cap year. And both parties get a much-needed fresh start with Jones’ decision to request the release. — Carroll (Photo: Al Bello / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

In a brief dated Thursday and obtained by The Athletic, the attorneys general of those 12 states said the case should be thrown out because Florida State never agreed to be sued outside of Florida. Advertisement It’s the latest step in a months-long, nine-figure, multi-state legal battle that will help shape the future of conference realignment. It started in December, when Florida State and the ACC sued each other about the ownership of TV rights and revenue for future Seminoles home games if/when FSU leaves the ACC. Clemson and the ACC filed dueling lawsuits against each other in March. This week’s argument centers on sovereign immunity. That’s the concept that generally shields state entities (like public schools) from being sued in other states. The ACC contends Florida State and Clemson waived that right by joining and remaining in the conference, which is based in North Carolina. If the ACC is correct, its lawsuits against Florida State and Clemson can proceed in the conference’s home courts in North Carolina — courts that, so far, have made favorable rulings for the league. FSU and Clemson disagree and have appealed separate rulings to the North Carolina Supreme Court. Their home states and 10 others said FSU never gave a “clear and unequivocal” waiver to allow it to be sued outside of Florida. The same general arguments could apply to the ACC’s lawsuit against Clemson. Kentucky is the only other state with a public ACC school (Louisville) that signed on. The other nine states are: Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Utah. If their side is correct, the lawsuits will proceed only in the home courts for Florida State (Leon County, Fla.) and Clemson (Pickens County, S.C.). Their home courts have generally ruled in the schools’ favor. In April, Florida attorney general Ashley Moody sent a letter to the attorneys general of six other states with ACC public schools asking them to consider involvement because the conference’s stance on sovereign immunity is “detrimental to all of our states.” Advertisement “If the history of college football realignment has taught us anything at this point, it is that there will be some future realignment down the road,” Moody wrote then. “The universities that have ratified such an expansive view of the waiver of sovereign immunity in the ACC Lawsuit may find that the sword that they now wield will be turned on them.” Barring a settlement, hundreds of millions of dollars hang in the balance in this ongoing litigation. If Florida State and Clemson own the media rights to their future home games, they would be able to leave for another league by paying an exit fee of only about $165 million. If the rights belong to the ACC through 2036, it will be virtually impossible for the schools to join another conference until then. FSU and Clemson are concerned about the growing media rights revenue gap between the ACC and other leagues such as the SEC and the Big Ten. In a separate filing this week, the ACC asked an appellate court to raise two procedural questions to the Florida Supreme Court as it fights the suit filed by FSU.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Predicting Notre Dame vs. Army: Can Irish keep College Football Playoff hopes on track?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940903/2024/11/22/notre-dame-army-prediction-preview-time/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:12:17 GMT",Notre Dame will try to hand undefeated Army its first loss on Saturday night at Yankee Stadium. Here's what to expect.,"NCAAF SOUTH BEND, Ind. — The advertisement only works if the Irish win. As Notre Dame readies for its 12th Shamrock Series kickoff, the regular off-site games that are as much a billboard for the university as the football program itself, Marcus Freeman understands the pressure. No. 6 Notre Dame (9-1) will face No. 19 Army (9-0) in Yankee Stadium (7 p.m., NBC) having won all 11 previous Shamrock Series games, including the past three against ranked competition. The Irish are two-touchdown favorites. And they’re just two wins away from making the first 12-team College Football Playoff, likely hosting at Notre Dame Stadium next month. Advertisement The Athletic’s projections give the Irish an 83 percent chance to make the field and a 54 percent chance of hosting a game. Notre Dame sent out CFP ticketing information to season ticket holders earlier this week. So yes, it all feels like the Irish are getting closer to the postseason horizon. What Notre Dame sees when it gets there, well, that’s down to what happens on Saturday night at one of the most famous venues in sport, followed by next weekend at another iconic address. GO DEEPER How a Notre Dame alumnus helped Army turn back to the option and its winning ways Here are three keys for Notre Dame vs. Army, plus a prediction. Notre Dame’s passing game has been a work in progress all season, but there have been flickers of sustained success the past few weeks as Riley Leonard seems to be growing into Mike Denbrock’s playbook. For example, all six of Notre Dame’s top receivers caught passes against Virginia, a first since Texas A&M. That’s on top of two tight ends and two running backs. Any idea the Irish would have a true go-to receiver has felt like wishful thinking since training camp, but Notre Dame now looks like it has an offense where any target can produce depending on the coverage. And depending on the quarterback seeing the opportunity. “I think it’s (Leonard) knowing where all the pieces are, right?” Denbrock said. “And if he does get into trouble, where can I go with it? Or if I need to move in the pocket, where is everybody at? You know what I mean? “I think it’s evolved as the season has gone along where he’s gotten a better feel for where all the pieces are. And he knows and I believe he has a lot of confidence in all the guys that are out there doing the job that if I give ’em a chance, they’ll make a play. And guys have been doing that.” After Beaux Collins looked like a potential WR1 at Texas A&M, everyone else has flashed at one point or another since. Last week that was Jayden Harrison, the third of three grad transfers at wide receiver and an addition who felt more like a special teams threat than a true wideout when he signed. Instead, Harrison posted three catches for 41 yards and a touchdown against Virginia, which doesn’t include his long touchdown called back by penalty. Advertisement “On any given play, we got so many guys who can play so many different positions on the receiving end that I look out there and I’m like, ‘OK, he’s playing the one to the field, oh now he’s in the boundary, no worries,’” Leonard said. “Half the time, I don’t even have to look out there, I know these guys can make plays no matter what.” Army’s quarterback is unlike anything Notre Dame has faced this season, including Navy’s Blake Horvath last month. Both run the option, but that doesn’t mean they run it the same way. In Army’s 14-3 win over North Texas two weeks ago, Daily ran 36 times for 153 yards and both touchdowns. It was a spike in job share for Daily, although he’s still averaging nearly 23 rushing attempts per game. That means Notre Dame should have two-dozen chances to hit the 6-foot, 221-pound quarterback. The Irish know they need to take advantage. “We gotta wrap him up,” said defensive coordinator Al Golden. “We gotta find ways to get him on the ground. We need multiple hats there. It all starts up front. We gotta direct the ball where our extra hat is and not allow them to gain an advantage at the point of attack.” With the Navy performance already banked, Notre Dame should gain some benefit from already stopping an option team. The Irish just don’t want to overstate the magnitude of that edge, though. Daily won’t throw it nearly as much as Horvath. And Army seems more likely to stick to its plan if it falls behind early. “That’s the first thing we cautioned the staff and the players about on Sunday is to think there’s going to be a continuation. There’s not. This is a clean break,” Golden said. “This is a different DNA: how they formation, how they are structured, where they want to attack the ball. So, it’s different. There’s certainly some crossover. I’m not saying that. But I’m saying overall the M.O. is different than Navy.” Advertisement Army leads the nation in rushing yards per game at 334.9, more than 70 yards per game ahead of second-place UCF. Defensive tackle Howard Cross III remains questionable after suffering an ankle sprain two weeks ago against Florida State. GO DEEPER Army and its 'fanatical' coach aim for perfection. But is that enough? Notre Dame has carved out an identity in the final four minutes of the first half and the opening four minutes of the second half this season, situational football called “the middle eight” and popularized by Bill Belichick. The theory goes that a coach can manipulate the clock at the end of the second quarter to create an extra possession (or limit one), then get the ball to start the second half and put daylight between itself and an opponent. During Notre Dame’s eight-game win streak, the Irish are winning the middle eight 97-0. That’s after playing Texas A&M and Northern Illinois to a 0-0 draw during the final four minutes of the first half and the first four minutes of the second. Freeman doesn’t see this success as random. “I think we emphasize the two-minute offense and defense every week,” Freeman said. “We go good on good with different situations. Every single week, it could be the end of half, end of a game situation, but every week, our guys know we’re going to get a good-on-good period that we have to execute.” Freeman created the end-of-half scenarios in practice almost by accident, counseling with athletic trainer Rob Hunt about load management in practice. That led to Freeman giving the team a mid-practice break. Then it led to simulating the end-of-half before the pause, followed by the start of the third quarter afterward. “I’ve continued that throughout the year because I think it’s a great way to simulate a game,” Freeman said. “Hey, take a quick break. It could simulate the end of a series or end of the half, that horn blows, reload, refocus and let’s go.” Advertisement Army has won the middle eight 48-10 through nine games. When Army fell behind by a field goal during the first quarter at North Texas, it marked the first time the Black Knights had trailed all season. That deficit lasted less than six minutes. That’s how dominant Army has been all season. It’s also a nod to the schedule the Black Knights have played, including four coaches who have been fired and an FCS team. Notre Dame is a huge step up. And Army knows it, which might be to the Black Knights’ benefit. Notre Dame flexes its muscle but never gets inside Army’s head (see: Navy’s six turnovers), which is enough to pull away in the fourth quarter.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Maple Leafs' Nick Robertson is trying to break the biggest slump of his career,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938544/2024/11/22/maple-leafs-nick-robertson-2/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:10:08 GMT",Nick Robertson has one goal this season and is struggling to adjust to a new system. A new opportunity may help.,"NHL This is something new for Nick Robertson: A prolonged offensive slump. Robertson scored a ton in junior. He scored a bunch (when he was healthy) with the Toronto Marlies. In his first extended opportunity with the Toronto Maple Leafs last season, Robertson pumped in 14 goals and 27 points in 56 games playing 11.5 minutes a night – the equivalent of a 21-goal, 40-point season. He led the Leafs with five goals in the preseason. Advertisement So yeah, this – one goal in the first 17 games of his second full NHL season – is new for Robertson. And he’s trying to figure it all out. Trying to change his game. Trying to learn, for the first time in his hockey-playing life, how to draw confidence from subtler aspects of the game that don’t involve the scoresheet. When we spoke earlier this month, Robertson was feeling “pretty good” about the way his season was going despite the non-existent production. And weirdly, at that point anyway, I kind of agreed. No, he wasn’t scoring or contributing to the offence. And while that was obviously a problem for him, Robertson looked like he was becoming a more well-rounded player. He was less of a liability. He was taking care of the puck. He was holding his own defensively, even with less cushy deployment. “As frustrating as it gets, I’ve got to stay confident in what I’ve done and how I’ve been playing,” Robertson said then. “It’s not like I’ve been playing bad. I think I’m playing pretty good hockey. Some games are so-so, but overall I think I’ve been playing pretty good. The production, hopefully, will come soon as the season goes on.” Robertson’s lone goal – lone point – came late in a blowout loss to Columbus on Oct. 22, more than a month ago. Even amid injuries to a whole whack of forwards, his ice-time hasn’t gone up. He logged only 10.5 minutes in the Leafs’ win over Vegas on Wednesday, second-fewest among the forwards (not including the injured Matthew Knies). He is playing only a little more than last season, but not much. All this in a contract year for the 23-year-old, who might get a shot with William Nylander when the Leafs play Utah on Sunday night with Knies out. Robertson is trying to tweak his game to unlock more offence and also suit the style of his new head coach, Craig Berube. Advertisement Arguably no Leaf, except maybe Max Domi, has been more hurt by the team’s Berube-led reluctance to rush chance than Robertson. Most of the 14 goals he scored last season were generated that way. It was a lot of this:  The kind of opportunities which are basically non-existent for the Leafs these days. Which explains why Robertson is determined to chase down more pucks, thieve them back on the forecheck, and create opportunities for himself and others that way. Just as his coach would like. You can kinda see what that looks like during a recent game against Ottawa, where Robertson’s tenacity eventually wins him control of the puck. “I think for me, I’ve gotten better at stealing pucks and want to do an even better job at it because that’s where, (playing on the) third line, I’m gonna get offence,” Robertson said. “I gotta get the puck back, I gotta find ways to get myself into the game with that, and just focus on the puck retrievals, trying to get the puck on my stick.” Unlike Knies or Bobby McMann, however, Robertson is at a physical disadvantage for doing that kind of thing. As the smallest player on the Leafs, at 5-foot-9 and 178 pounds, it’s simply harder for Robertson to knock defenders off the puck. He knows this. “I’m a small guy,” Robertson said. “For me, it’s a lot of quickness, lifting sticks, being deceptive, reading where the (defencemen) are.” Robertson believes he’s gotten better at that, slowing the game down and reading where defenders will be. He also watches his star teammates closely. While Mitch Marner, Auston Matthews, and William Nylander draw praise mostly, and understandably, for the splashy offence they produce, all three are elite puck thieves. “I think that’s a reason why they get a lot of offence, because they steal pucks,” Robertson said. “And I think for me, it’s learning how to use my body type to my advantage to steal pucks. I’m trying to do that better.” Advertisement Marner isn’t that much bigger – at 6-foot and 180 pounds – than Robertson. In Robertson’s estimation, Marner is shrewd in how he picks and chooses “when he’s gonna go hard at a guy or when he’s gonna be patient.” Robertson hasn’t stolen enough pucks though, and generated offence off of that, to make up for the lack of rush opportunities he gets these days. He’s struggled to get shots off and get them from in tight, where, like most players, he’s more likely to score. Consider his shot map last season:  To this season:  Part of the problem: Too many of Robertson’s attempts are getting blocked or missing the net entirely. He’s been blocked 17 times in 17 games and missed the net another 17 times. In every game, one attempt is getting swatted away and another isn’t hitting the goal. That feels like a lot for a guy playing 12 minutes a night. Robertson has finished with exactly one shot in 12 of his 17 games. He continues to have a limited role on the power play, where his heavy shot could theoretically cause more damage. It’s hard to score with so few opportunities, especially when those opportunities are almost entirely self-created. Robertson did his best work last season playing with Domi, a high-end playmaker. His most frequent linemate this season is Pontus Holmberg, who doesn’t have those same skills. “Everyone’s so quick and so good defensively. I think you get shots mostly on broken plays and wearing teams down on the forecheck,” Robertson said. “It’s so hard to get shots on the inside. A lot of it is you’re getting it off a rebound inside there or you’re getting a breakaway or two-on-one. It’s so hard to really get inside. One thing Robertson spotted on video that he can improve on: Jump on more split-second opportunities to cut into the middle and shoot the puck. He’s trying to find some silver lining in this dry spell, which has seen him go 10 straight games without a point. Advertisement “I think it’s a blessing in disguise for me to teach me patience and taking pride in other areas of my game to be confident, so that when things aren’t going (well offensively) I can take pride in the things like winning puck battles, getting to the right spots, getting in the (shooting) lane (as a defender). I take more pride in that than I did last year,” Robertson said. Robertson has been on the ice for only two five-on-five goals against all season. That’s partly a product of great goaltending. However, the underlying defensive numbers for Robertson have been solid and improved from last season, albeit facing third and fourth lines for the most part. That won’t be enough though. The puck needs to start going in. Eventually, the details won’t be enough.

Advertisement “(Messi’s) under contract through 2025,” Mas said. “Leo and I sit and we’ll discuss the future. As I’ve said it before and I will repeat now: I fully expect in the opening of our new stadium in 2026 in Miami and the opening of our 2026 season — hopefully, after a trophy-laden 2025 campaign — that Lionel Messi will be our No. 10.” Miami’s new stadium, dubbed Miami Freedom Park, was originally slated to open next year but in September, the club announced that they will move to the new ground in 2026. Messi’s future both with club and country has remained uncertain. The eight-time Ballon d’Or winner, fresh off a World Cup triumph with Argentina in 2022, has long kept the door open to defending that title when the tournament is held in North America. Messi, though, has finished his 2024 season. Miami were eliminated by Atlanta United in the MLS Eastern Conference quarterfinals on November 9. He played in two World Cup qualifiers for Argentina last week and will not be active competitively until the new year. Messi spoke about his long-term future and love of Barcelona earlier on Friday, in an interview with Catalonian outlet 3Cat. “My kids were born here,” the 37-year-old said. “I’ve spent my whole life living there. I feel I belong to Barcelona. “My family and I always think about the possibility of returning to live there one day. My children, my wife and I miss our life there a lot. We miss our friends.” GO DEEPER How Lionel Messi and Inter Miami will be impacted by Tata Martino's exit When he returns from that extended time off, Messi will welcome a new head coach to Miami. Reports have linked his former Argentina and Barcelona teammate Javier Mascherano as the frontrunner to replace Martino. Mascherano is currently the head coach of Argentina’s U-20 men’s side. On Friday, Mas appeared to all but confirm the hire, saying that the ideal candidate should have the ability to relate to Messi, Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba and Luis Suarez. Advertisement “We’re very close to finalizing a deal with a new coach,” Mas said. “We’ll make the announcement in the coming days. I spoke to Lionel on Saturday after he and Tata had spoken. I asked him, ‘What is important to you and what is important to get the best out of our roster and starting XI. How do we improve?’ Leo shared his thoughts with me. “This is a very attractive position for a coach. We got it down to three final candidates by Tuesday. Familiarity with Leo and the other stars is an advantage in every aspect. “I want Leo to feel comfortable with the new coach who is coming in. Raul (Sanllehi, president of football operations) and I will spearhead this. Leo gave me what I asked him, which is input. That was Leo’s involvement and engagement, which is frankly all the time.” Mas, during his 40-minute press conference, said that a coach with MLS experience “would be good” but that it isn’t the deciding factor. “I think the development of the club’s (footballing) identity is more important. How do you manage a squad that has unlimited talent? Because the best version of Inter Miami has not been seen yet.” Martino revealed that he had made the decision to resign before the start of Miami’s three-game series with Atlanta, adding that it’s “strictly personal.” “I have to leave Inter Miami,” Martino said. “We can’t come back and I have to go back to Rosario.” Martino first communicated his decision to Sanllehi. He then met with Messi before speaking with Mas. “No-one on my staff knew about this final decision,” said Martino. “I didn’t want to create a distraction. Inter Miami is a very demanding environment. It can be entrapping. But I’m very happy to have been part of the club’s turnaround. We do leave with a sour taste in our mouths after the elimination.” Advertisement Martino was asked about his relationship with Messi, one that has been scrutinized for nearly a decade. The 61-year-old Martino has coached Messi on three separate occasions. First at Barcelona in 2014, followed by two seasons as Argentina’s manager from 2015 to 2016. “This is the closest we’ve been after three stints together,” added Martino. “It has a lot to do with my own professional growth and Messi’s place in world football today. It was the best time we’ve spent together.” Martino said that he will not consider any new coaching offers for several months.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Rex Ryan wants to be the Jets coach again — don't forget how it ended last time,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940599/2024/11/22/rex-ryan-potential-return-new-york-jets-coach/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:07:40 GMT","He's the last coach to take the Jets to the playoffs, but there are plenty of reasons he's the wrong pick to be their next coach.","NFL The noise around Rex Ryan returning as New York Jets head coach is getting louder. Well, louder in the sense that Ryan can’t stop talking about it. He’s said it across various appearances on ESPN, he said it in an interview with the ESPN radio station in New York on Thursday, and he said it during his appearance on the “Pardon My Take” podcast on Friday morning. If you pass him on the street, he’ll tell you too. Advertisement “I’ve let everybody know I’d be interested even though I’ve got a great gig” at ESPN, Ryan said on “Pardon My Take.” “I have some unfinished business with that franchise … I just think I would get back in it if I could make a difference and I could make a difference with that team.” He added: “If I took over it’d be turned (around) in about two minutes.” Ryan also said that “I know if I get the opportunity to interview for it I’m going to get the job.” In Ryan’s defense, perhaps he knows how much owner Woody Johnson hears what people are talking about on social media. So if Ryan talks enough, maybe Johnson will hear him. Rex Ryan on @PardonMyTake, on the #Jets job: (Would you like to save the #Jets?) “I’d like to. I’ve let everybody know I’d be interested even though I’ve got a great gig (at ESPN) … I have some unfinished business with that franchise … I just think I would get back in it if I… — Zack Rosenblatt (@ZackBlatt) November 22, 2024  A potential Ryan return is a fun idea to talk about weeks before the Jets actually start their search. He’s still the last Jets coach to make the playoffs, in 2010. That was also the last time they were respected as a team to reckon with around the NFL. But that was 14 years ago, and focusing on that ignores everything that happened after that 2010 playoff run, and really what led to that success in the first place. Let’s start from the beginning: Ryan’s best results in New York came in his first two years, when he inherited the team that Eric Mangini built. They went 9-7 in 2008, Mangini’s last year, when they started hot (8-3) but faltered once an aging Brett Favre got injured. To Ryan’s credit, he did build the Jets defense into one of the league’s best, but the offense never really took off and even as he shuffled through offensive coordinators over the years, they never steered away from a “ground-and-pound” attack. Advertisement In the PMT interview, Ryan said the Jets current offense, put together by Aaron Rodgers and Nathaniel Hackett, and since taken over by Todd Downing, is “about 20 years behind its time. That’s the old West Coast type stuff. They talk like they’re geniuses and the great thing is I love playing against them because I can tell where every damn play is going. I haven’t coached for eight years and can tell you every play. That’s gotta be flushed out. You gotta get up with the times offensively.” Well, there’s not really any evidence that Ryan knows how to run a modernized offense, nor is it clear what offensive coordinator would want to work with him. GO DEEPER Why Joe Douglas never stood a chance as Jets GM Now, look at what happened after the Jets’ two successful playoff runs, in 2009 and ’10: They were a massive disappointment in 2011, going 8-8, when they were definitely hurt by the loss of legendary offensive line coach Bill Callahan (he was lured away by the offer to call plays for the Dallas Cowboys). It only got worse from there. Offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer left after 2011 and was replaced by Tony Sparano, who was fired a year later and replaced by Marty Mornhinweg. From 2012 to ’14, the Jets went 18-30 and ranked 31st in offensive EPA, 18th in defensive EPA, 29th in offensive yardage, 32nd in passing yards, 31st in red zone success rate and 31st in scoring. Ryan had Geno Smith — who has since become a quality starting quarterback — and failed to develop him. In two seasons with Ryan as his head coach, Smith threw for 25 touchdowns and 34 interceptions. In 2013, Ryan, confoundingly, inserted Mark Sanchez into a preseason game in which Sanchez suffered a season-ending injury, thus forcing Smith into the starting lineup before he was ready. This quarterback part is notable since Ryan wouldn’t be inheriting a good quarterback situation. Rodgers likely isn’t returning — that becomes even less likely if Ryan is the coach. So Ryan would be the one tasked with shepherding a team led by, potentially, Tyrod Taylor and/or a rookie. After Ryan was fired by the Jets in 2014, he became the Buffalo Bills head coach, didn’t succeed there (two seasons, no playoff appearances) and was fired. There’s also this: He hasn’t coached in the NFL, in any capacity, since the Bills fired him after the 2016 season. He interviewed to be the Cowboys defensive coordinator this offseason but Dallas picked Mike Zimmer instead. Advertisement Perhaps Ryan has learned a lot over the last decade as an ESPN analyst. One of his comments on PMT was somewhat encouraging, when he said the Jets offense needs to huddle quickly and use more pre-snap motion to get into “a great play.” But there’s not any past evidence that he’d run an offense like that. GO DEEPER The Jets' QB options in 2025 — with or without Aaron Rodgers Ryan’s Jets tenure didn’t end nearly as well as it started. His message wasn’t resonating as much in the locker room and he left a sour taste with some in terms of the way he exited. Per ESPN at the time, after getting fired Ryan addressed the team briefly, “revealing little emotion” and instead of giving a speech showed a Jets highlight film. He didn’t get along with then-general manager John Idzik (though it’s not as if Idzik has the best resume as GM either). It appears the Jets intend to hire a general manager before their next head coach, and there likely aren’t many prospective general managers that would be excited about hiring a 61-year-old who hasn’t coached in the NFL since 2016. There’s also the nature of Ryan’s TV gig: He’s been highly critical of NFL coaches and players in his role — including Jets players and coaches — and that caught some steam recently when he directed vitriol at Cowboys star Micah Parsons, who pushed back. There aren’t many modern NFL players left who know Ryan for the kind of head coach he was — to them, he’s just a boisterous ESPN personality. This is a much different NFL than the one he left behind, in terms of the physicality, the signature of his best defenses. Would his messaging resonate the same way it once did? Since Ryan last coached, the NFL has made it harder for coaches to conduct physical training camps. Two-a-days were killed off in 2011. Ryan, though, doesn’t need to convince writers or fans right now. He just needs to convince one person: Woody Johnson. And he might be right: If Ryan gets in a room with Johnson for a job interview, he has the personality, ideas and proven track record of success with the Jets to win the owner over. It would be an easy sell, in Johnson’s mind, to the fan base — and at the end of the day, Johnson wants to sell tickets. There are a couple examples over the years of head coaches returning to the job years after leaving. Art Shell coached the Raiders from 1990-94 and made the playoffs three times. He was hired again in 2006, went 2-14 and was promptly fired. Joe Gibbs coached Washington from 1981-92, won three Super Bowls, retired, then came out of retirement in 2004 to coach them again. In four seasons, Washington made the playoffs twice before Gibbs retired again. Ryan wants his own second chance. It wouldn’t be a good idea.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Eric Ramsay interview: ‘At Minnesota United, we’ve found a version of ourselves which is exciting and dynamic’",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938919/2024/11/22/eric-ramsay-interview-minnesota-mls/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 17:35:37 GMT",The head coach discusses his tactics and philosophy as he prepares his side for their meeting with LA Galaxy on Sunday,"MLS This year has played out at a breakneck pace for Eric Ramsay. In January, he was an assistant coach in Erik Ten Hag’s backroom working to restore Manchester United to their former glories. Come March, he departed for a transatlantic opportunity, becoming Minnesota United’s second head coach since joining MLS in 2017. He joined a team that hadn’t lost any of its first four games, and sustained that momentum to reach the playoffs after they missed out in 2023. Advertisement Speaking on a blustery November day in Minneapolis, Ramsay has had a relatively mundane past few weeks. His team pulled off a first-round upset against Real Salt Lake in the first round, but three full weeks will have passed between that advancement and their matchup with the LA Galaxy (Sunday, November 24, at 5 p.m. Central). It’s been a rare lull in this high-octane season — and one with several key players away on international duty. The 32-year-old met with The Athletic to discuss his rapid entry into the MLS coaching ranks, the “three distinct phases” of his first season, what guides his approach to management, veteran Teemu Pukki’s decreasing workload, and much more. How have you found this first foray into being a senior head coach, and what are the differences between an assistant and head coaching roles? I’ve always been very intentional about how I build relationships with players, partly because I’ve always had that age question mark hovering over my relationships with senior players. As a consequence of that, I’ve found the transition relatively easy.  I’ve always leaned into my coaching and my ability to help a player develop as being the number one thing that sits between me and them. Other coaches talk about that in completely opposite terms, with it being the personal relationship to focus on first. I genuinely believe that, first and foremost, a player wants to feel like the coach is going to benefit the team — and to benefit them as a football player. I find that if you can do that, then the relationship just comes naturally. Almost to a man with the group that we’ve got now, I feel like I’m in a really good place with them.  There are a couple of guys on the team who are my age and think in a very similar way to me. I’ve tried to make sure that I bring those guys in, that we have a real leadership group. I give players some autonomy as to how the team plays and try to loop them in when it comes to some decision-making. It’s definitely something that I would take forward into any role that I take on in the future. During the interview process, chief soccer officer Khaled El-Ahmad stated the importance of hiring someone who was in ideological lockstep with his vision. How has that dynamic played out since you joined? I think we’ve naturally fallen into line. It’s been interesting: what this job has demanded from me is that ability to be pragmatic and adaptable. I think this league is one that demands that probably more than most. You’ve got the obvious things around geography and climate which means you can’t only do one thing in one way.  Advertisement We’ve used more players than any other MLS team. We’ve gone through three distinct phases of player availability. We’ve almost been victims of our own success earlier on — we did well with a squad that was pre-planned to be thin given the timing of my arrival and Khaled’s arrival. The nature of the early success meant that more players than probably planned were involved in their international teams. Those players went further (in summer tournaments) than expected, and then that misalignment between the European (transfer) window and this window, we were a victim of that as well.  If we’d set out at the beginning of the year and said we wanted the team to play in ‘X’ way, it would have been almost impossible. It would have been an absolute miracle to see real consistency across those three distinct groups, across 36 players, and to see a really cohesive outcome come the end of it. That’s interesting — I think younger coaches are stereotypically assumed to be strictly adhered to a philosophy of play, a curated system. How do you take your internal influences, ranging from result-obsessed pragmatism and staunch commitment to methodology above all else?  I would say I’ve really enjoyed the necessity — and I do sort of underline that word, necessity — to be pragmatic and adaptable with this group.  I’ve really enjoyed going from week to week and making sure that we are as competitive as possible, and that we’re as well-positioned for three points come the weekend as we can be. I’ve looked at our group, and I felt like we’ve got players that are very goal-orientated — they’re very direct. We’re not a team that’s necessarily cut out for dominating possession week on week.  I feel like over the course of the last 12 games, we’ve found a version of ourselves which is exciting and dynamic. It’s led to the team having more goals than the team’s ever scored over an entire year — but we are also very difficult to beat. We’re very solid, very strong defensively, really disciplined, really well-organized. I feel like that’s a nice blend, and it’s difficult to get a team that is very restrictive in terms of what the opposition is able to create.  Advertisement We’ve got a really good rhythm. We create a lot of chances. I think that makes, particularly at home, for a really exciting team to watch. You alluded to the last 12 games, beginning after the team exited the Leagues Cup in the group stage. That elimination afforded you several weeks of training that you didn’t enjoy by arriving after preseason. What did you work on in that span? When we’ve looked back at statistics over the course of this year, you just find that the whole season is hugely skewed by that middle period. We’ve tried not to draw too many conclusions from that period, in the sense that you felt like there were so many extenuating circumstances wrapped around that it almost renders that exercise pointless.   What this iteration of the team does well is restrict the number of high-quality chances that the opposition is going to get. We were good defensively in the first half of the season, but we were always good value — or bad value, depending on how you look at it — for the opposition getting one or two clear-cut chances. We’ve made some subtle tweaks to the way we press, and some of the detail in how we defend the wide areas has meant that the back line isn’t defending as much as it was. At our best, we’ve always been very tight from top to bottom, difficult to play through. We now have a better grasp and are more detailed, much more intentional, as to when we start off our pressure. Sitting beneath that now is a team that understands its roles. I’m really confident that, going into Saturday’s game, I know what I’m going to see as a baseline. That, for me, means I can spend the days when we get the group back together talking about the subtleties of the opposition, as opposed to trying to claw together some sense of solidity in ourselves. We’re talking during another long break, into a third week since you and the LA Galaxy knew you’d face off. I’d imagine it’s been an awkward time trying to sustain momentum without overthinking the matchup. Yeah, I’ve not enjoyed these two weeks. I don’t think anyone’s enjoyed them in a lot of senses, because it feels like we’ve trained without a lot of purpose. We’ve gone and lost seven or eight internationals. In one sense, it’s been nice, because we’ve tried to keep our training very general and fun. Sometimes what you find difficult — particularly when you settle on a lineup and there are very few injuries, and you’re rolling with a really good form — is that you get a sense of “starters and non-starters.” That is just the nature of our sport. I was keen for that not to continue over the course of this period, so we’ve obviously not wanted to work tactically yet. We’ve not wanted to talk about Galaxy; we’ve not wanted to talk about the possibility of this player starting or that player starting. In the same breath, it’s then two weeks of just plodding along, I would say. I’m sure the players would feel the same. So, refreshing in one sense, but largely frustrating. It’s an odd dynamic, I’ll say. Does that short run-up become easier when you play a team that’s so stylistically different in terms of their view of possession? It’s an interesting one, because they are sort of predictably unpredictable. Even if I had 10 days with the full group, it wouldn’t be that I could nail down the three or four patterns that they will typically execute that are going to cause us a lot of problems. Advertisement Their danger lies in the unpredictability of the individuals in the middle of the pitch; Riqui Puig is huge in that sense. He has complete freedom to pop up in any part of the pitch that he would like to, so they’re not particularly positional. It’s then very difficult for you to be really concrete in how you solve every particular situation. It’s much more about how you execute principles, which is something that I talk about a lot, and how typically when we do that well, we can leave ourselves in a really good place. I also don’t want to underdo what we are able to do with the ball in organized possession. As much as we don’t often have more than 40 to 45 per cent of it, when we use it well, we use it with a really good rhythm. We’ve got players that we can get into positions that can cause real danger. I would say with Robin (Lod), we have one of the more creative, dangerous, crafty players between the lines in the league. We’ve obviously got Kelvin (Yeboah), Joaquin (Pereyra), Bongi (Hlongwane), (Joseph) Rosales — we’ve got plenty for them to think about as well. I certainly won’t be leaving our group feeling that we’re going to spend 80 per cent of the game defending and counter-attacking, because we can be and will be much more than that. One big decision you’ve made this season regards your striker depth chart. Teemu Pukki appears to sit third despite being the team’s highest earner, trailing Yeboah and Tani Oluwaseyi for minutes. How has managing that situation gone? Yeah, it’s been an interesting challenge in that sense, and I’ve approached it as I approach relationships with all the players: I’m really open, I’m really honest with players. I try to make it very clear what the expectations are, how I want the team to play, what the demands are on individuals, positions, and relationships. If players don’t fall into that, then I make it very clear as to why that’s the case. I think I have a good relationship with Teemu. I think he’s a really good guy. He’s hit the levels that he has as a consequence of ability, but also of professionalism and work and a real love for being in front of the goal and scoring goals. I’ve really taken that from this year with him, but he’d be the first to admit: it hasn’t been the year that he would have expected, and certainly not the year that probably the club had planned for Teemu.  Managing that hasn’t been easy. It’s not been easy for Teemu. He’s someone who wants to be on the pitch and wants to play, and he’s obviously experiencing a different period in his career. As best I can, we’ve tried to help him with that. I’m sure as we sit here now, there’s still a big contribution left for him in this team for sure. I don’t think anyone envisages a situation where we’re chasing the goal on Saturday, in which he’s not considered to come on because the ball seems to gravitate toward him. He’s one of those guys: a bit of a magnet for the ball in the box. Advertisement Before the 2018 World Cup, Gareth Southgate was in Minnesota for the Super Bowl. He later said that he learned a lot about curating set pieces from watching the Timberwolves, and you’ve also been spotted courtside at NBA games. Have you taken any cues from American sports? I love watching basketball courtside and being able to appreciate it. The level of concentration from a defensive perspective is insane. I feel like if you could get a group of footballers across 11 players to execute with that level of concentration and detail, you’d have a team that’s almost impossible to beat. Obviously, in basketball, the level of consequence that is wrapped around each action is so much more than in football. If you’re beaten one-v-one in the middle third, you’ve still got possibly half a pitch and six or seven players to beat before you get anywhere near the action being really consequential. In basketball, any wrong slip is incredibly consequential. I feel like when I sit courtside and I watch players that dialled in, it’s something I’d love to bottle and give our players to drink. If we could go another level in that sense, that would be impressive. I also feel like just being around that sport and talking to coaches, that idea of individual matchups is the essence of sport. I think our sport has become so tactical. Everyone is very concerned about the collective and knitting together the roles of player one to player 11, relative to how the opposition plays, that sometimes you just lose that essence of like, ‘Well, this guy is on fire. Let’s get him the ball.’ We have to try and engineer these 1v1 situations — it’s sometimes lost. I think that the basics, the essence of sport, are being brought back to my attention by watching some of that stuff. Since you left Manchester United, “Peak Barclays” has surfaced as a meme, a yearning for less predictable play models. Generally, young coaches are lauded for incorporating data analytics into their planning. Where do you fall between those two extremes? I’m really keen to not lose sight of what are some of the really important things in sport. I really like the sort of romance in the essence of sport: the moments and the individuals and their strengths. I think, as a coach, I’m much more drawn toward how you knit all that together, and don’t lose sight of what it is that these players did to become professionals. I feel like that’s the art of coaching.  GO DEEPER 'Take me back to the 2000s': Premier League nostalgia and the perils of comparing different eras  I would consider myself a modern coach, a progressive coach who has a really good grasp of data and sports science, and I can think from one end of the spectrum to the other when it comes to philosophy. I understand the component parts. I understand the mechanism to produce a team that can play in one way and a team that can play in a way that looks very different. Advertisement But I don’t want to lose sight of the fact that sport is about individuals. It is about matchups. It is about team chemistry. I also feel like coming to Minnesota, coming to MLS, has given me the chance to play with that a little bit, because there’s no preconceived idea of what I was going to bring as a coach, what the team was going to do. That sort of blank canvas has been good from our perspective, for sure. It might be an awkward time for this question — because you have one to three games left this season — but thinking ahead of 2025, do you have a sense of how you want to evolve your approach and your system?  I’ve got a really clear idea of how I want the team to look. I feel in the last 10 or 12 games, we are moving much closer to a version of that. What we’ve seen at home over the last three games, we’ve been in a really good place.  I sort of reaffirm what I said earlier in the sense that, at home in those games, the team has been very difficult to beat; really compact, really well-organized, and given away very little. When it’s had the ball, it’s played with a really good rhythm. It’s attacked quickly. It’s created loads and loads of really clear-cut chances. It looked really dynamic, really pacey and threatening at the top of the pitch. I would like to be a more refined, higher-quality version of that team next year. I feel if we can get to that point, then we’ll be a real threat. English coaches working abroad are inevitably assessed with one eye on the Premier League, especially when your previous employer is Manchester United. Do you think about your personal mid-to-long-term plan? Not really. Contrary to what people think when they look at my career, I’ve never been desperate to keep taking the next step. It’s just that at each club I’ve been at, it’s gotten to a point where I’m ready for the next thing and opportunities start to arrive. This was one of those, and I assume the next one will be similar. I’m in no rush to necessarily get back to England. I have no preconceived idea as to exactly where the next step will be, but I’m obviously one that’s open-minded to (an opportunity) that’s not in England. I feel I’ve opened the world a little bit by coming here, and I’ve really enjoyed the nature of MLS. It’s the most multicultural league in the world, I really wanted to make sure that I continue to cut my teeth in a multilingual environment. I wouldn’t be in a rush to lose that in any way. Of course, we feel like we’ve got real momentum here and we’re onto a really good thing, so I want to make sure that whilst I’m here, that continues to build.

After last season’s inspiring run to the NFC Championship Game, the money has poured in on Detroit, which could cost sportsbooks significantly in payouts to bettors if the Lions were to win Super Bowl LIX. “They’re by far our biggest Super Bowl liability and pretty much our only one at this point,” BetMGM trader Christian Cipollini told The Athletic. “Anything inside of 10-1 [odds] we don’t tend to build crazy liability that we’re worried about, but everybody has been on them. At this point, the Lions winning the Super Bowl would be a huge problem for us. If I could remove them from futures, I would.” Adding to the growing liability on Detroit, fans tend to favor their home team with their wagers, and Michigan is one of the 38 states with legal sports betting (and the 10th-largest by population). The Lions opened the offseason in the 12-1 range to win the Super Bowl, but those odds have dropped significantly to just over 3-1 since. The betting money has followed that success. “The betting momentum in favor of Detroit started prior to the season as they attracted a large number of Super Bowl future wagers,” said Brad Bryant, general manager at Mohegan Sun FanDuel Sportsbook, noting the Lions have been one of the Mohegan Sun’s “top-wagered teams on a weekly basis.” At DraftKings Sportsbook, 31 percent of bets (No. 1 among NFL teams) and 31 percent of total dollars wagered (also No. 1) were on Detroit to win the Super Bowl earlier this week. The Lions are third in ticket count for Super Bowl futures at The Borgata in Atlantic City, where sportsbook director Thomas Gable noted Detroit has the most total dollars wagered to win the Super Bowl “by a pretty good stretch.” Advertisement “We hate the Lions,” Cipollini said, adding that the number of bets on the Lions is the first thing that he looks at every week. “I haven’t seen something like this in my time at BetMGM. Every single week, they’re our worst team. I think something like 95 percent of the bets last week [vs. the Jaguars] were on Detroit.” With an NFC-best 9-1 record and winners of eight straight games, the Lions have vaulted from a top-five preseason power rating among oddsmakers to the consensus No. 1 team in the league. Out of 10 oddsmakers The Athletic polled, nine of them had the Lions as their highest power-rated team. (One had the Baltimore Ravens slightly above Detroit.) The Lions also have the NFL’s best record at 8-2 against the spread, and bettors placing a moneyline wager or standard six-point teaser on Detroit have cashed that ticket in nine of 10 weeks. And the action isn’t only in Michigan. Bookmakers noted the increased interest in betting the Lions at several sportsbooks from Mississippi to Las Vegas. “That’s 100 percent true,” Ed Salmons, vice president of risk at The Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook, said. “Weekly bets on Lions point spread, moneyline, teasers and game over and Lions team total over.” Several other oddsmakers agreed, noting they’d seen an increase in betting on the Lions compared to previous seasons and that the public was regularly tossing Detroit in moneyline parlays and teasers. In the upcoming Week 12, Lions at -7.5 is currently the most-bet Week 12 side by both total money and tickets at BetMGM and DraftKings. “[The public] will include Detroit in parlays and tease the spread down,” The Borgata’s Gable noted. “We opened [with] the Lions -8 against the Colts [in Week 12] and took respected money right away against the Colts. Now it’s 7.5.” It’s easy to see why the public is in love: The Lions are a ridiculous 41-16 ATS (72 percent) in their past 57 games since the middle of the 2021 season. That includes a 22-8 ATS mark in the first half since the start of last season. Double-digit favorites in the NFL are 5-0 ATS this season, and the Lions are responsible for two of those covers — the 52-6 laugher vs. Jacksonville as a 14-point favorite and a 52-14 demolition of the Tennessee Titans as a 13-point favorite. It’s one thing to cover a 14-point spread; it’s another to have it be a rocking-chair win. Advertisement Looking ahead to a potential title matchup, when six oddsmakers were asked to make a spread on a Chiefs-Lions matchup on a neutral field, their responses were: Lions -4.5
Lions -2.5
Lions -2
Lions -1.5
Lions -1
And one pick-em The oddsmaker framing the matchup as a pick-em explained, “One concern I have is the coach. When you talk about Detroit vs. the Chiefs and Andy Reid, there’s a big difference there. And the Lions haven’t gotten [to the Super Bowl] yet. The Chiefs have been there.” As the Lions keep steamrolling through teams, oddsmakers are certainly rooting against a Detroit Super Bowl victory. And history might be on their side. Several of the oddsmakers contacted by The Athletic, who have worked in sports betting since the 1970s, could not recall a time when Detroit had been favored to win pro football’s championship. Per Pro Football Reference, however, the Lions were favored by three points 70 years ago in the 1954 championship game against the Cleveland Browns … who obliterated the favorites by a score of 56-10.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,NFL moves Broncos-Chargers in Week 16 for first 'Thursday Night Football' flex,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940748/2024/11/22/broncos-vs-chargers-tnf-flex-week-16/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 16:57:54 GMT",AFC West divisional tilt between two playoff hopefuls replaces Browns vs. Bengals as Prime Video's game of the week.,"NFL By Nick Kosmider, Daniel Popper and Zac Jackson The NFL has flexed a game into a “Thursday Night Football” for the first time, moving the Denver Broncos’ Week 16 matchup at the Los Angeles Chargers into prime time on Dec. 19. The two teams, led by former Oregon quarterbacks Bo Nix and Justin Herbert, were originally set to play on Sunday afternoon, Dec. 22. The Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals game that was originally slated for Thursday night will now be played that Sunday at 1 p.m. ET on Fox. GO DEEPER Broncos' biggest turnaround this side of Bo Nix: A run defense with real bite NFL owners approved a rule change in 2023 that allowed games to be flexed into a Thursday slot between Weeks 13 and 17, with such moves requiring a four-week notice. The matchup means the Broncos will now play two prime-time games in December, the first coming against the Browns on “Monday Night Football” in Week 13. The matchup against the Chargers will give a national audience a look at Nix, who won the AFC Offensive Player of the Week award following his four-touchdown performance in a Week 11 rout of the Atlanta Falcons. Advertisement The Chargers, meanwhile, have won five out of their last six games under first-year head coach Jim Harbaugh — the first of those coming in a Week 6 win against the Broncos — and remain in the hunt for the AFC West title. The Broncos, who already played a Thursday night road game earlier this season against the New Orleans Saints, had to OK being flexed since this will be their second road Thursday night game of the season. They are embracing the switch, in part, because it will give them extended rest heading into a pivotal Week 17 road game against the Bengals. “We’d rather be flexed in than flexed out,” said Broncos coach Sean Payton. “It’s a real good team that is playing real good (football). And it flexes Cincinnati out, who we play the next week, so there is a little (rest consideration). It is what it is.” Payton said his 2006 Saints team was the first one to flexed into a Sunday night matchup, against the Dallas Cowboys, but he downplayed the history of being the first team flexed into a Thursday slot. “It’s all good,” he said. “Just tell us when we’re playing.” The Chargers have now been flexed into prime time for the second time this season. Their Week 11 matchup with the Bengals was moved from Sunday afternoon to Sunday night. That ended up being an epic game, with the Bengals erasing a 21-point second-half deficit before the Chargers pulled it out late on Herbert’s 15th career game-winning drive. GO DEEPER Justin Herbert paces Chargers in 23-16 win vs. Broncos: Takeaways The Chargers are interesting. The Chargers are exciting. They are good for business. And now, they will be playing four prime-time games in a six-week stretch, starting with last week’s Bengals game. They host the Baltimore Ravens on Monday night in Week 12. They play at the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday night in Week 14. — Daniel Popper, Chargers beat writer
 Advertisement Nix had a slow start to the season, throwing only one touchdown and four interceptions across his first four games. Since then, he’s arguably been the best rookie quarterback in the NFL (13 touchdowns, two interceptions), putting him firmly alongside players like Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels and Las Vegas Raiders tight end Brock Bowers in the Rookie of the Year race. The “Thursday Night Football” stage will give Nix the opportunity to make a major statement. This will be the third matchup between Nix and Herbert, including a college clash in 2019, when Herbert was at Oregon and Nix was a true freshman starter at Auburn. Nix led a late touchdown drive to win that game at AT&T Stadium in Dallas. Herbert came out on top in Week 6 this season. — Nick Kosmider, Broncos beat writer The Bengals aren’t out of contention yet, but from a playoff appeal standpoint, the move makes sense. The Bengals are probably disappointed because the home team has won nine straight AFC North Thursday night games dating back to 2015, a streak the Browns extended with their upset of the Steelers Thursday night. The Browns now could be looking at back-to-back flex situations; they’re currently scheduled to host Miami on Sunday night in Week 17. — Zac Jackson, Browns beat writer (Photo: Dustin Bradford / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"What I'm hearing about the Canucks' roster crunch, trade options and call-ups",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5939806/2024/11/22/canucks-roster-jt-miller-trades/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 16:18:39 GMT",There are a few big-picture questions for Canucks management at this crucial moment of the season.,"NHL The Vancouver Canucks flew to Ottawa on Thursday to begin a six-game road trip that stands out as a potential inflection point in this still-young campaign. Vancouver is deeply short-handed and will remain so at least for the beginning of the trip. The Canucks are coming off a wildly disappointing homestand in which they dropped four of six contests in regulation, and they probably played worse than that record would indicate. Advertisement It’s a testament to the start this club got off to and the high floor this team has hit that it remains solidly in the mix in the Pacific Division. This road swing, meanwhile, represents both a significant challenge and an opportunity. The schedule itself isn’t imposing. Over the next 11 days, the Canucks will face off against a variety of weaker sides. Their opponents are effectively a who’s who of teams outside the Eastern Conference playoff spots before the road trip concludes with a matchup against Kirill Kaprizov’s impressive Minnesota Wild. It’ll be essential for the Canucks to sort themselves out on this trip and bank enough points to tread water in the divisional standings, and that should be achievable regardless of the difficulty of the club’s current circumstances. Let’s open our notebook and get into some of the pressing items surrounding the team and the big-picture questions that Canucks management is weighing at this crucial moment of the season. I asked around this week and on Thursday afternoon was able to confirm the roster mechanics of J.T. Miller’s leave. Miller, away from the club indefinitely for personal reasons, is currently off the Canucks’ 23-man roster as an Injured Non-Roster player. Injured non-roster functions the way that normal Injured Reserve does for the most part — Miller’s cap hit still counts on the books but the club gets an extra spot on the 23-man roster — the only exception is that it’s somewhat more flexible. A player placed on IR is ineligible to return for at least a week but Miller is eligible to be activated at any time. The flexibility is irrelevant in this instance. While Miller’s absence is indefinite, he won’t be back in under seven days and isn’t expected to return to the lineup for the duration of this road trip at the very least. Advertisement As Vancouver sets out on this marathon road trip, however, the club only has 22 active players on the 23-man roster and doesn’t have the flexibility to add a call-up from Abbotsford for the moment. Their flexibility isn’t limited by roster space, it’s actually about the salary cap. As we’ve covered exhaustively over the past several months, the Canucks want to avoid utilizing Long-Term Injured Reserve (LTIR), which would provide the club with some short-term cap flexibility but would prevent it from tolling cap space daily. With an eye toward maximizing its cap space and the ability to add talent to the roster ahead of the trade deadline, Vancouver is currently eschewing the use of LTIR, even in managing the status of players that would be eligible for it like Thatcher Demko and Derek Forbort. With Miller, Demko, Forbort and Brock Boeser all remaining on the books cap-wise, the Canucks are pressed up against the upper limit with 22 active players on the roster and not enough cap space remaining to call up a 23rd. While this will create something of a roster and cap crunch for the team at the outset of this road trip, the sense I get is that in Boeser, Demko and Forbort’s case, some reinforcements should begin arriving in relatively short order. The state of the Canucks blue line has been a hot topic for fans and media through the first six weeks of the season. While Quinn Hughes and Filip Hronek have been a dominant force on the top pair, and Erik Brännström and Vincent Desharnais have formed an effective, sheltered third pair, Carson Soucy and Tyler Myers have had a tough go as a duo through the first 18 games. In nearly 205 five-on-five minutes as a pair this season, Soucy and Myers have been outshot 106-58 and have been outscored by a commensurate margin (five goals for, 13 goals against). As well as they performed in the 2024 Stanley Cup playoffs the play of the second pair has been problematic in the early going this season, and the seams have been especially evident when Vancouver has battled higher-quality opponents with more dynamic attacking depth. Advertisement This is why the club is eager to get Forbort back into the lineup. Forbort’s return will give the Canucks another defender with size and, accordingly, more options to experiment and find solutions with different second-pair combinations. I do believe that size concerns have held Brännström back, as well as he’s performed, in terms of earning an elevated role in the lineup. That said, his usage is ticking up, and all indications are that the comfort level of Rick Tocchet and his staff with leaning on the 25-year-old defender appears to be increasing with each passing game. To this point, Soucy and Myers have remained a fixed pair for every game this season. If their struggles. continue for much longer, however, the club recognizes that it’ll have to consider trying something different to find an internal fix. It was roughly a year ago that the club acquired Nikita Zadorov in a trade with the Calgary Flames, a deal that was motivated by the Canucks’ desire to shore up the defence and protect their hot start to the 2023-24 campaign after Soucy got hurt. It wouldn’t be a surprise if general manager Patrik Allvin were able to pull off something similar for a second consecutive season. That said, as Vancouver’s hockey operations department weighs its options on the trade market, the calculus appears to be moderately different than it was when the club traded for Zadorov. When it comes to the state of the blue line, a topic that has long preoccupied Canucks hockey operations leadership since they arrived in Vancouver, the organization feels like they’re caught in between the present and the future and have to be mindful of precisely how they proceed. The club is excited about the progress that Cole McWard and Elias Pettersson have made in AHL Abbotsford. We’ll likely see both players given a look at the NHL level this season, with an eye on developing them into regular contributors within a year or two. Advertisement The Canucks are also delighted about Tom Willander’s progress this season, and his evolution as a more comfortable and dynamic attacking presence from the back end in his sophomore season at Boston University. The club will likely push to sign him after the conclusion of his NCAA season. In the WHL, Sawyer Mynio is tracking exceptionally well and is widely expected to be in the mix to play for Canada at the world juniors. The club has high hopes for his professional future after this season. The Canucks sorely need a top-four upgrade short-term, though, and are working to identify and acquire a player who matches that description, but their appetite to pay a significant price in a trade is shaped by a sense of internal confidence that in a year or two the club is poised to have some credible in-house options with potential on the back end. This is really the rub for Canucks management. Nearly every contender in the league is eager to land an additional top-four capable defender and the supply of potentially available trade targets is both meagre and somewhat uninspiring. As a result of this dynamic, the prices for those defenders that actually may shake loose are astronomically high at the moment. We know that this Canucks management group isn’t going to hesitate to pay retail price — they won’t even hesitate to overpay, as we saw with Hronek — if they’re able to land a defender who would qualify as a perfect fit. If it’s a credible, multiyear top-four upgrade, the Canucks will push hard and pay a steep price. If it’s an older rental defender that the club isn’t convinced will offer a significant enough upgrade over its current options, it sounds like Vancouver may be more reluctant to move proactively and pay full freight. The Canucks don’t intend to make a trade, it seems, solely for the purpose of shaking things up on their second pair. If they’re going to dig deep into their pockets to upgrade the blue line, and it’s clear that’s what it’s going to take, my sense of it is that they want to land a multiyear fit. This is also why the tongue-in-cheek invocation of Zadorov’s name by Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman on Thursday is an interesting one. Whether or not repatriating Zadorov is actually a sensible or realistic option for the club, the five years of term remaining on his deal might be a better fit with Vancouver’s big-picture priorities than one of the more prominently discussed rental options. Advertisement Before heading out east, the Canucks returned top prospect Jonathan Lekkerimäki to Abbotsford and called up 24-year-old centre Max Sasson. Sasson, who signed with the Canucks as a college free agent in the spring of 2023, has been a standout for Abbotsford but has yet to play an NHL game. Though he’s slight for a bottom-six centre, Sasson has a high motor, plus speed, above-average hockey IQ and NHL-level wheels. He’s been solidly productive in the AHL and is a natural centre, giving the Canucks some additional positional versatility. It seems very likely that Sasson will make his NHL debut at some point on this trip. As for Lekkerimäki, who appeared in five games and scored a goal, the club viewed this NHL stint as an unqualified success. Tocchet — and the organization more generally — was impressed by how Lekkerimäki’s game translated to the NHL level, and by his defensive conscientiousness in particular. Like with Arshdeep Bains and Aatu Räty earlier in the season, the club wanted to give Lekkerimäki a taste of the NHL with the intent of sending him back to Abbotsford to apply what he learned and continue to develop by dominating in the AHL. He’ll be back soon enough. In the case of all three players, but particularly Lekkerimäki given his pedigree, the club is hopeful that some of its younger forwards will be able to be contributors by the tail end of this season. Bains, who had an especially strong outing on Tuesday night against the New York Rangers, appears to be the player who seems closest to hitting that level.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Fantasy football flex fliers: Wan’Dale Robinson, Alec Pierce can help in Week 12",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940454/2024/11/22/fantasy-football-flex-fliers-week-12/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 16:07:53 GMT",Scott Engel tells you who to grab and play after waivers have passed for this Week 12 slate that has six teams on bye.,"Fantasy Football With six teams on byes in Week 12, the mad scramble for fantasy football lineup streamers continues after the initial waiver wire run and Thursday night game. Heading into every weekend, I pinpoint players who still may be available in free agency and players on the end of your fantasy bench who you can waive or tell to “get in there.” The analysis is based on PPR scoring, and players are listed in order of preference for pickup and lineup usage. Rostered percentages are from CBSSports.com. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. Wan’Dale Robinson, WR, NYG (54 percent rostered): Robinson caught five balls on eight targets last week. Tampa Bay ranks 26th in receptions allowed to WRs, and Tommy DeVito has averaged 6.2 yards per attempt so far in his career, which would not rank in the top 30 at QB right now. The Giants’ new starting QB may not take too many downfield shots and will lean on Robinson to help him move the chains on critical downs. Advertisement Luke Schoonmaker, TE, DAL (7 percent): Jake Ferguson (concussion) is not expected to play against Washington, and Schoonmaker caught six of 10 targets last week. Cooper Rush posted better numbers in his second start of the season, and the tight end is a frequent target in Dallas’ passing game. Washington’s pass defense now ranks fifth overall, but at tight end, you are looking for opportunities over matchups when needing a lineup filler. GO DEEPER NFL Week 12 fantasy football, betting cheat sheet: Mike Evans, Isiah Pacheco near returns Xavier Legette, WR, CAR (53 percent): The matchup against the Chiefs seems daunting. But Legette was targeted six-plus times in two of the last three games and caught TD passes in three of his last four home games. Kansas City is also not a complete shutdown defense against WRs, ranking 13th in fantasy points per game allowed to the position. Alec Pierce, WR, IND (38 percent): The Lions may be the best team in the NFL right now, yet they can be vulnerable to the pass. Detroit ranks 29th in receiving yardage allowed to WRs, and Anthony Richardson will not hesitate to throw to his downfield specialist. Pierce might be productive in any game script, helping to keep the Colts close or boosting his numbers in catch-up mode. Nick Westbrook-Ikhine, WR, TEN (35 percent): A run of five TD receptions in six games certainly does not seem sustainable. That said, Westbrook-Ikhine has a knack for finding the end zone from anywhere on the field, and Houston has allowed an NFL-high 16 TD receptions to WRs, including six over the past four weeks. Ricky Pearsall, WR, SF (47 percent): Pearsall was a widely favored play against Seattle last week and was held without a reception. He posted double-digit PPR point totals in his previous two games, though. On Pro Football Focus for Week 12, Pearsall has a 76.0 WR/CB matchup grade as a slot receiver against Green Bay, which qualifies as “good.” Advertisement Jalen McMillan, WR, TB (32 percent): A Week 11 bye gave him more time to recover from a hamstring injury, and the return of Mike Evans should benefit McMillan in a complementary role vs. the Giants. Devaughn Vele, WR, DEN (3 percent): The first-year Bronco is a sizable target at 6-foot-5, 210 pounds. As noted by FantasyPros, the Raiders have allowed the most fantasy points per game to slot WRs since Week 6. Noah Brown, WR, WAS (29 percent): Consider the old and fun revenge game narrative here as Brown faces the Cowboys. Dallas ranks 20th in receiving yards allowed to WRs over the past four weeks, and Brown was targeted six-plus times in three of his last four games. Michael Wilson, WR, ARI (26 percent): Wilson has a 70.9 individual WR/CB grade (“good”) on PFF this week against Seattle, and the Seahawks defense will prioritize containing Marvin Harrison Jr. and Trey McBride. Ameer Abdullah, RB, LV (35 percent): Injuries might push Abdullah into a starting role against Denver, and rookie Dylan Laube (3 percent) should also be in the mix for carries. Abdullah is versatile enough to potentially post decent totals, and Laube is the desperation plug-and-play guy. DeMario Douglas, WR, NE (42 percent): Miami ranks fifth in fantasy points per game allowed to WRs, yet when searching for plug-in types, you usually won’t find an ideal option on the free agent list or at the end of the fantasy bench. Douglas posted nine-plus PPR points in each of his last three games. Gus Edwards, RB, LAC (49 percent): The surprising Chargers get a marquee matchup with Baltimore on Monday Night Football, and the former Raven might punch in a TD to finish a scoring drive. Trey Benson, RB, ARI (54 percent): Benson may be available in some leagues and logged 18 carries over the past two games. He is a quality complement to James Conner, who could rip off a sizable run or two or potentially get in the end zone in a big game vs. Seattle. Advertisement Theo Johnson, TE, NYG (9 percent): Johnson is another option for DeVito in the middle of the field. The Giants rookie has been targeted six times in each of the past two games. Sterling Shepard, WR, TB (8 percent): Shepard gets the revenge matchup against the Giants, so a TD reception is possible. When speaking with the media, Shepard expressed no animosity toward his former team, but it’s always fun for a player to make a notable contribution against his previous team. Ja’Tavion Sanders, TE, CAR (8 percent): Another deep rookie tight end option, Sanders deserves consideration because Kansas City ranks 29th in fantasy points per game allowed to TEs. Troy Franklin, WR, DEN (6 percent): Bo Nix’s Oregon teammate caught his second NFL TD pass last week, and the Las Vegas defense may spend a lot of time on the field this week. And Nix is coming off a four-TD outing. (Photo of Wan’Dale Robinson: Luke Hales / Getty Images)  Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Don Waddell enjoys fresh start with Blue Jackets but holds good feelings about Hurricanes,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5937782/2024/11/22/don-waddell-blue-jackets-hurricanes/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 15:58:00 GMT","As Carolina visits Columbus, Waddell reflects on why he made a necessary move last summer.","NHL COLUMBUS, Ohio — Don Waddell surprised many in the Carolina Hurricanes organization last May when he announced, only a day after the Hurricanes were bounced from the second round of the playoffs, that he was resigning as president and general manager. The rest of the hockey world learned of his decision about a week later, a major shake-up for one of the most consistently competitive franchises in the NHL in recent seasons. Advertisement “I’d been there 10 years, six as the president and general manager,” said Waddell, now general manager of the Columbus Blue Jackets. “It was a lot, beyond the day-to-day operation of the hockey club, plus an expansion project (with PNC Arena) and other projects. “I made the decision way before the end of the season that it was time for me to move on. It was just time to find the next chapter in my life. I was very much a personal feeling. Probably a lot of things went into it, but I just felt it was time.” As the guy who ran both the business side and on-ice product, Waddell had long-established relationships all over the Hurricanes organization. So it will be a mini-reunion on Saturday when the Blue Jackets host Carolina in Nationwide Arena, and a much bigger get-back-together when the Jackets play in Raleigh, N.C., on Dec. 15. “Any time you’re with a team for 10 years, you’ve got a lot of friends there, a lot of ties to the organization,” Waddell said. “The coaching staff, the trainers, the players, everybody in the office … I had a big staff there, and there are a lot of good friends I’ve stayed in touch with. “They’re a very good team. I think they have, what, three losses? I just want (the Blue Jackets) to play hard and play our best and hopefully we win the game.” Saturday’s game also marks the return to Columbus of forward Jack Roslovic, who, after 3 1/2 seasons in Columbus, was traded to the New York Rangers at the deadline last season. He signed with Carolina as an unrestricted free agent this summer. Roslovic, who is second on the Hurricanes with 10 goals in only 18 games, will almost certainly get a first-period “welcome back” video on the scoreboard. Waddell will have to wait until next month for his greeting in Raleigh, but Saturday is a testament to the status he’s achieved as an NHL executive. He’s now been a president and general manager of three franchises, including the expansion Atlanta Thrashers, who moved to Winnipeg in 2011. Advertisement The Hurricanes could never get over the hump to reach the Stanley Cup Final during Waddell’s run, but there were significant successes. What stands out? “When I went there initially as president (2014), our attendance was among the worst in the league,” Waddell said. “When I left, we were selling out every night. “When Rod (Brind’Amour) and I took over (the roster) — he as the coach and me as the general manager — we had missed the playoffs in nine straight years. We then made the playoffs six years in a row. From where we started and where it ended up — and they’re still going, obviously — I feel good about that. I think I left them in a good spot.” On May 16, Carolina lost Game 6 to the New York Rangers, ending their second-round series. The next day, a Friday, Waddell told Hurricanes owner Tom Dundon that he was stepping down, even though he didn’t have any future plans in place. Don Waddell, 66, was hired to run the Blue Jackets in May, and it’s already clear he plans on running the organization differently than his predecessors. And that includes roaming Columbus' arena seeking out fan interaction, writes @aportzline.https://t.co/WONDAvCcfa pic.twitter.com/rjN5mLXHjZ — The Athletic NHL (@TheAthleticNHL) October 24, 2024  “I had no idea, really, what was going on around the league,” Waddell said. “We were in playoff mode, just going day by day and pretty focused on what was in front of us. “I didn’t know what Columbus was doing (with their GM search). I had permission on Sunday to talk with other teams, and I found out they were still looking. They asked me to come in and talk to them.” Waddell had developed a two-decade friendship with Blue Jackets president of business operations Mike Priest, who was running the Jackets’ GM search. He immediately shot to the top of Priest’s list of candidates, and a drawn-out process started moving forward quickly. He was hired on May 29. Priest and Waddell had been friends for more than two decades after meeting at the NHL board of governors meetings in the early 2000s, when they were both trying to get expansion franchises off the ground in non-traditional hockey markets. Never fear, Green Lantern is here!@BlueJacketsNHL GM Don Waddell went all out for Halloween this year 🎃#CBJ pic.twitter.com/bhLVUKqQTV — FanDuel Sports Network Columbus (@FanDuelSN_CBUS) November 1, 2024  That relationship with Priest was a big draw, Waddell said. So was the Blue Jackets’ young talent, especially at forward. But he was also delighted with the way the franchise operates internally. Under Dundon, the Hurricanes are known to be run more collaboratively than most pro sports franchises. That’s probably a nice way of putting it. There’s a perception that the office staff can’t order paper clips or printer ink without some level of discussion. Advertisement “A lot was done by committee,” Waddell said. “At the end of the day, though, I can honestly say, there’s nothing that I wanted to do … for the most part … nothing major … that we couldn’t get done. “But you had a lot of … how should I put this? … there were always a lot of questions about anything you wanted to do.” It’s hard to argue with the Hurricanes’ results. They’ve won division titles in three of the last four years, and they currently lead the Metropolitan Division. But Waddell seems refreshed by the setup in Columbus. “My day-to-day contact is Mike Priest,” he said. “I keep him updated on anything that’s going on, and he’s been very supportive. Anything we’ve wanted to do — whether it’s picking guys up off waivers, signing guys as free agents — he’s been very supportive. I’m a firm believer that ownership has the right to know what’s going on before they read about it. “I’d say this about Carolina and now in Columbus, though. It’s not the Don Waddell show. We have a lot of really good hockey people here in this organization who have big roles with us. Big decisions have to be made, and you want people around you whose opinions you trust. I had that there, and I have that here.” Waddell has been watching closely every aspect of the Blue Jackets organization. He has his coach in place after hiring Dean Evason a month into his Columbus tenure. Now, as his first season unfolds, he’s watching the roster closely, admiring the young talent and trying to figure out which veterans will be part of the mix going forward. This may take some time, but that’s not because Waddell plans to slow-roll it. To the contrary. “I like a lot of the young guys,” Waddell said. “We hope they continue to grow. It’s an important year for them to keep maturing, not only as players but as people. If they do that, we’re in pretty good shape for the future. Advertisement “Saying that, we’re going to have to add some more pieces next summer; we know that. Going into next summer, we’re going to have lots of cap space. We’re not going to waste it, we’re going to spend it wisely. We’ve already started talking about what areas we need to identify.” Waddell wasn’t out of work long, but he believes he’s landed well. He’s knee-deep in another project, trying to get the Blue Jackets to achieve the same sustained success as the Hurricanes, but perhaps with more postseason success. “I was really excited by the opportunity here right from the moment I heard from the Blue Jackets, honestly,” Waddell said. “And it’s been everything I’d hoped and more. The city is great. The fans have been great. The players have played hard almost every night. “We’ve been through some stuff, some rough patches (on the ice). But I really love it here. It’s been a perfect fit.” (Photo of Don Waddell at the 2024 NHL Draft: Bruce Bennett / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Sign up here to receive it directly in your inbox. Just when you think you’ve got the NFL figured out, Nick Chubb and the newly 3-8 Browns stun Pittsburgh 24-19 in last night’s thrilling, snowy game. After falling to 8-3, Steelers WR George Pickens said, “The conditions played a huge, huge part in today’s game. I don’t really think the Browns are a good team at all.” Both teams played in the same conditions, George. Full takeaways here. On November 23, 2014, the Giants called for a deep shot. Rookie WR Odell Beckham Jr. was to make an out-and-up move down the sideline, with instructions to sell a comeback route in order to help hold the safety. The play began with a misunderstanding. While lining up, Beckham had been told “don’t rush the route,” but only heard “rush the route.” He indeed rushed, failing to sell the comeback and allowing the Cowboys’ corner to remain in tight coverage. The play ended after Eli Manning, seeing the one-on-one look he wanted, targeted Beckham deep. It led to a pass interference call and this unforgettable, three-fingered, 43-yard touchdown catch:  It instantly made Beckham a legend, even inspiring the following year’s Madden cover. But it’s a catch that hasn’t been topped since, by Beckham or any other receiver. And the remainder of his career has never reached those heights again, either. How could it? Today, Jeff Zrebiec delivers the worth-the-wait story behind the catch and Beckham’s later regrets for a moment he would come to call “bittersweet.” Honestly, we spent most of today’s episode of the “Scoop City” podcast talking about our exclusive reporting on the Jets. But since we’ve done plenty on the Jets in this newsletter already this week, let’s go into the weekend on a more positive note. My co-host, Chase Daniel, and I discussed the turnaround of embattled Panthers QB Bryce Young amid Carolina’s two-game winning streak. Advertisement Dianna: I enjoy seeing this improvement. I like watching Bryce Young look so happy — he seems like he’s growing into all of this. Chase: Yeah. It’s wild to me how a benching like that can just change his perspective. Just like a little bit of time in time out. I don’t know what the hell they’re going to do with Bryce Young in the offseason. Dianna: I think they’re still trying to figure out what they want to do. I give (coach Dave Canales) credit for having the guts to walk into David Tepper’s office with GM Dan Morgan and say, I can’t make this work if we want to win games. Bryce Young is not the answer, he needs to watch. And I think he watched Andy Dalton, and I think that helped. Chase: The free agency class, the draft class are not good. Wait another year with Young — if you’re shown enough promise, that’s what you do. If not, then I think you just got to blow it up and get a guy for $10 million a year to play quarterback, to just win some games and hold the fort down. I don’t know if just drafting a guy to draft a guy, like Shedeur Sanders or Cam Ward or Quinn Ewers, I don’t know if they’re better than Young — we forget that Young was a frickin’ No. 1 overall pick. It’s in there somewhere. 🎧 Listen to the full Scoop City Podcast here. Back to you, Jacob. Every Friday, I share three stories from The Athletic that you might have missed. All offer deeper looks into the lives of players and coaches we watch on Sunday. The 24-year-old superstar receiver had started 45 regular season games prior to this season, and his 3,717 receiving yards in that span ranked ahead of names like A.J. Green, Tyreek Hill and Calvin Johnson. Yet even after that all-time great start, Paul Dehner Jr. details how Chase unlocked another level to become this season’s triple-crown leader in receptions (66), yards (981) and touchdowns (10). Yesterday, Colorado’s Travis Hunter confirmed he’ll enter the 2025 NFL draft. The Heisman Trophy favorite is expected to fetch the No. 1 pick. Once drafted, Hunter intends to become football’s Shohei Ohtani by playing both cornerback and receiver. Grace Raynor shares the early days of Hunter’s unprecedented journey. “Inspiring. Great story for starting my day,” said one reader of Doug Haller’s profile on James Conner, which offers a fascinating look at how Conner’s leadership has fueled the Cardinals 6-4 start. The cancer survivor has his team — which finished 4-12 last year — first in the ultra-competitive NFC West, a division they haven’t won since Bruce Arians’ 2015 team. Sunday at 1 p.m. ET Sunday at 4:05 and 4:25 p.m. Sunday at 8:20 p.m. Monday at 8:15 p.m. Yesterday’s most-clicked: Vic Tafur picks all the weekend’s games. Enjoy! 📫 Enjoyed this read?

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Premier League clubs have changed associated party transaction rules. Here’s what it means,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940146/2024/11/22/premier-league-apt-changes-explained/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 15:43:51 GMT","Amendments to APT rules gained the necessary support to be signed off on Friday morning, with Premier League clubs voting 16-4 in favour","This article, first published on October 14, has been updated to reflect the passing of the changes to the associated party transaction rules on November 22 The vote came swiftly and for the embattled Premier League, there was relief. Changes to the associated party transaction (APT) rules gained the necessary support to be signed off on Friday morning, with clubs voting 16-4 in favour of amendments deemed necessary by Manchester City’s legal challenge this summer. Friday’s meeting began at 9.05am, and by 9.23am a statement had been released. Advertisement Only Aston Villa, Newcastle United and Nottingham Forest joined City in opposing the Premier League’s proposals at a shareholders meeting in central London. But there was a lack of further resistance, with previous sceptics Wolverhampton Wanders and Everton choosing not to join the rebellion, which has given the green light to a revised set of APT rules. Most notably, it will see shareholder loans, previously exempt under the old system, integrated into the APT rules and, by extension, be included in future profit and sustainability rules (PSR) calculations. City, who had pushed for this vote to be delayed, will retain their belief that the Premier League’s APT rules are flawed, but the short-term will now bring modification rather than overhaul. The Athletic analyses where the changes to shareholder loans will leave the Premier League’s 20 clubs. They do exactly what it says on the tin: it is money loaned to a club by their shareholders. They amount to a form of funding, a means for owners to inject cash into the football project without seeking equity in return. Typically these are long-term arrangements, often free of interest payments. And clubs are certainly fond of them. Fourteen of the 20 Premier League teams in the 2022-23 season had shareholder loans recorded in their most recent set of accounts. City’s legal team were only too happy to highlight the extent of their use during this case. It was cited that £1.5billion ($1.96bn) out of £4bn total borrowings across the division — 37 per cent — were through shareholder loans. “The main motivation (behind shareholder loans) is that it’s an easier mechanism for an owner getting their money back,” says Chris Weatherspoon, an accountant and financial analyst at the football website Game State. “If they put in equity, that’s them effectively giving up any right to a return, short of paying out dividends, which hardly any club does or even can do, as most are in a position of accumulated deficits, or making their money back when they sell up. Advertisement “It’s also more tax efficient. Interest costs on debt — if owners charge them — are tax-deductible for clubs, so reduce the club’s tax burden; dividend payments aren’t. “Another point is that if there’s a need to plug a cash-flow gap quickly, lending money is easier than working through the mechanism of issuing shares.” The Premier League, until this point, had excluded shareholder loans from APT rules, saying they would “encourage investment” in clubs. City came hard at the Premier League when launching their legal challenge in June, saying the APT rules in place were “discriminatory and distortive”. They also called their existence “unlawful” and set about picking holes in a set of regulations designed to prevent clubs from earning increased revenue through inflated commercial deals. In 2021, 19 of the 20 members, City included, had been responsible for voting through the existing APT rules in 2021, with only Newcastle United abstaining. Everything, in theory, had to reflect fair market value (FMV). Only, shareholder loans have never done that. No bank would lend hundreds of millions interest-free, so why should a club benefit from such an arrangement through its owners? It was, City argued, the very definition of an associated party transaction and “at odds with the whole rationale of PSR (the league’s profit and sustainability rules)”. “The exclusion of shareholder loans from the APT rules distorts competition in permitting one form of subsidy, namely a non-commercial loan but not another, namely a non-commercial sponsorship agreement,” City were cited as saying in the verdict. And, most importantly, City’s argument over shareholder loans was accepted by the independent panel. Any money loaned to a club by their owners will need to reflect FMV and see interest rates charged in line with commercial loans. The changes will bring the Premier League in line with UEFA, European football’s governing body, which applies FMV to shareholder loans in its financial fair play (FFP) calculations. Three clubs lead by some distance: Everton, Brighton & Hove Albion and Arsenal. Collectively, those three had £1.08billion of debt owed in shareholder loans recorded in their 2022-23 accounts. Everton’s profligacy during the reign of Farhad Moshiri sees them top the list with £451million borrowed in interest-free loans from the Iran-born businessman, a sum expected to be written off if The Friedkin Group completes its looming takeover of the club. Brighton come next with £373million owed to Tony Bloom, their long-standing owner, in another interest-free arrangement. That outstanding sum had been trimmed thanks to a £33m repayment during the 2022-23 season but had previously increased every year since 2013. Arsenal’s shareholder borrowings are much more recent. A refinancing of existing debt in 2020 saw them draw down a loan from parent company Kroenke Sports & Entertainment and, as of the 2022-23 accounts, that sum now stands at £259million. The precise rates of interest on that shareholder loan have not been disclosed, but Arsenal’s last two sets of accounts showed interest paid on total debts (including £10.2m worth of debentures) to be £4.3m. That is less than half the interest Arsenal had previously paid when holding external debt. Advertisement Chelsea (£146million), Liverpool (£137m) Leicester City (£132m) and Bournemouth (£115m) are also north of £100m in shareholder loans. Still, Leicester’s figure has been markedly reduced after £194m of loans to King Power International Co Limited, the club’s parent company, got capitalised into equity in February last year. ﻿ It will not be a concern to half a dozen sides, including City, Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle and Manchester United, who held no shareholder loans when filing their most recent set of accounts. The Premier League were obliged to address the legal shortcomings of their APT rules and say the revised framework will ensure “appropriate parity between the treatment of shareholder loans and other APTs going forward”. The 14 clubs currently benefitting from shareholder loans now have a decision to make. The simplest solution is to replace those soft loans through a conversion to equity and the Premier League has provided a 50-day grace period for that to happen. Take this approach before January 11 and the matter will end there. Any shareholder loans still in place after that cut-off point, though, “must be submitted as an APT” and be subject to an FMV assessment. That will mean money borrowed from owners can be retained on its existing terms but adjustments will need to be made to this season’s accounts. An interest-free loan, for example, must now see FMV interest payments added to PSR calculations. Going on the Bank of England’s current rate of 4.75 per cent, that would mean £4.75million would need to be included for every £100m borrowed in shareholder loans. The Premier League made two distinctions in how shareholder loans will be judged: pre- and post-December 14, 2021. That was the point that the APT rules challenged by Manchester City were introduced but the Premier League board will need to determine in both instances whether the borrowing was at FMV. Advertisement Most importantly, though, there will be no retrospective assessment of shareholder loans. That ensures clubs such as Everton, who benefitted from enormous interest-free funding from outgoing owner Farhad Moshiri, while sailing close to the PSR wind, are set to escape further scrutiny. None of that is to say this thorny issue has met a neat resolution. “In no way will this be the end of the matter,” says Yasin Patel, leading sports barrister at Church Court Chambers. “Instead, it highlights a number of factors: not all of the Premier League clubs are unified in one way or another in relation to the rules. Nor will this be the end of the storm. “City have threatened further legal action prior to today’s judgment. This is now almost inevitable. City have argued that the APT Rules discriminate against clubs like themselves. They have always argued that not subjecting previous shareholder loans to a fair market value assessment would be unfair, particularly as this is applied to previous sponsorship deals. “The case between the Premier League, where 115 charges are being fought, continues in the background. But this saga has several other plots and expect City to add a further one with new litigation.“ Speaking at the time of the tribunal verdict being published, Simon Leaf, a partner and sports law specialist at Mishcon de Reya, also had his misgivings that the issue could be easily resolved. “On the one hand, whilst the Premier League may try to carry on with the existing rules and rely on what is commonly known in the legal world as the ‘blue pencil test’, where essentially they would argue that the rules should be read so that they are automatically reinterpreted in a lawful way, it would appear that Manchester City would challenge this strongly,” says Leaf. “City would, no doubt, try to argue that until formal changes to the rules are voted on and agreed by the other Premier League clubs, the APT rules are unlawful and therefore cannot be enforced. Advertisement “In my view, City may even try to suggest that the APT rules can only now work if the shareholder loan calculation applies retrospectively — which again, is likely to be problematic for the Premier League because several clubs are likely to oppose this, and may even try to challenge such a rule change themselves.” It is worth remembering that City believe all APT rules were declared null and void by the original tribunal. The amendments voted through by the 16 clubs will not alter that outlook. (Top photo: Ashley Allen/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Ruben Amorim, the Right One? Man Utd head coach mixes warmth with steel in first press conference",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940596/2024/11/22/ruben-amorim-manchester-united-press-conference/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 15:43:44 GMT",The Portuguese referenced the club's past but made it clear he has a vision for what his Manchester United team will look like in the future,"EPL For all the humility and warmth exuded by Ruben Amorim in his first press conference as Manchester United head coach, there was a clear message of strength to players and fans. “As a coach, you have to choose one way or another: I choose always 100 per cent our way,” he said when asked about his preference for his 3-4-2-1 formation. “I choose to risk, no doubts. I believe so much in our way of playing; they will believe too. There is no second way. Advertisement “We will adapt some players because this team was built for a different system. The principles are the same. “On Sunday, you will see the list of players, and maybe think not a lot of change, but you will see it in the positioning or the way they feel the ball.” Such clarity of thought has been communicated to players during initial training sessions this week. According to people close to the squad — speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships — Amorim’s instructions have been short and direct. He does not want to overcomplicate things to start, but he does want to instil an idea.  He acknowledged changing the system midway through the season might cause some turbulence, but he has a positive mindset that he hopes will transmit to the players. “I don’t know about repair, I feel we have space to grow,” he said. “I know it is a way of playing we are changing in the middle of the season. We have to improve the physical aspect of the team. I don’t know how long it will take. I know when in Manchester United you have to win games. “I am a little bit of a dreamer: I believe in myself, I also believe in the club, I believe in my mindset, that can help. I truly believe in the players also. The only thing I ask is hard work and that you believe in a new idea. I felt that. Until they prove me wrong, I believe in the players.” There, in that final sentence, was the steel that people who have worked with him say he possesses. It sounded like a warning shot to players, those who fail to commit themselves will face the consequences. GO DEEPER Manchester United lead the way in promoting homegrown talent. Will it continue? There were echoes of Jose Mourinho, who in his early days in England nicely meshed humour with a hard edge. Inevitably, Mourinho came up during the press conference. Amorim revealed the manager he studied under at Carrington during an internship six years ago had messaged him after his appointment at United. But while Mourinho called himself a Special One, Amorim preferred a modest moniker. He settled for the Right One. Advertisement “First thing, not just on me but all the Portuguese coaches, he showed we can be the best in the world, from a small country,” Amorim said. “But I am different from Mourinho. He was European champion and I am not. Football these days is different, and I think I am the right person for this moment.” Amorim also talked about how his age, at 39 years old, can help him communicate with a squad of young men. In Mourinho’s time, he said, those players were Frank Lampard and John Terry. “These days are different,” he added, seeming to suggest a self-managing dressing room is harder to find. He was smart in referencing those who have come before him, having the double effect of paying homage while also reminding us that many different types have failed, so he should be given time. There was also a nod to his current paymasters. “You have here different types of coaches, the guys that won everything like (Louis) van Gaal and Mourinho, the new ones that knew the club inside out like (Ole Gunnar) Solskjaer, then one of the best outside the top-five leagues in (Erik) Ten Hag. You have different coaches, the same results. We will try to do INEOS way, my way.” So not impossible, came the question. “No, of course not. Call me naive but I truly believe I am the right guy in the right moment.” There it was again. That sense of momentum was felt by staff during greetings at Old Trafford in his first week in England. He showed genuine enjoyment in touring the museum and talked to people about the heritage of the club. He and the football executive want to forge a new history, though, and there were more signs in his first public address of how he will do that. GO DEEPER The Premier League returns: Guardiola's contract, Amorim's arrival and could Chelsea be title challengers? “I think we lose the ball too often, we have to be better at running back, I think that is clear to everyone,” he said, raising a smile in the room. “I think we have to be better on the details. In the small things, I think I can help a lot.” It was no coincidence that footage from one of Amorim’s first sessions showed him urging the players to sprint back into position after losing the ball. Advertisement Those clips also painted a picture of how Amorim plans to shape United. His trademark 3-4-2-1 system was clear, with Leny Yoro, Jonny Evans and Luke Shaw making up the back three from right to left. Antony was the right wing-back, with Tyrell Malacia on the other flank, either side of Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo in midfield. Amad and Mason Mount occupied the two No 10 positions, behind Marcus Rashford up top. At Sporting CP in the Portuguese Primeira Liga this season, Amorim has played a left-footer at right wing-back in 17-year-old Geovany Quenda, but at United the other candidates for that role are right-footed. It would be a major call to start Antony in the Premier League, especially if it means a defensively-minded wing-back on the opposite side at the expense of Alejandro Garnacho. How Amorim fits Garnacho into the team will be fascinating to observe. The new head coach must assess whether the 20-year-old is willing to embrace a wing-back position or his suitability to operate in the tighter confines of a No 10 role. Bruno Fernandes is expected to partner Amad in that line of attack. GO DEEPER How can Amorim get the best out of Garnacho at Man Utd? Amorim pulling Mainoo for instructions during the session, and then allowing that section of video to go public, suggests he is a player who will feature heavily. Amorim appeared to be reinforcing to Mainoo how to find space and fire the ball forward to the No 10s — who are central to his methodology. The two deeper midfielders can be classed as No 8s, although one is typically more disciplined than the other. Manuel Ugarte seems a sure fit as the sitter, having played under Amorim at Sporting from 2021 to 2023. Rashford as a striker would be an interesting alternative to Rasmus Hojlund, given Joshua Zirkzee does not exactly match Amorim’s prototype in that position. Amorim insisted the players are ready to adapt. “In this first moment, they just want to play, it is easy, in the future we will see,” he said. “You can watch on TV but you have to train with them to see if they can play in different positions. Everyone wants to play now; if they have the opportunity to play as a goalkeeper, they will.” It was a nice line, another that raised a laugh. Advertisement In the windows to come, Amorim may be able to buy players that tesselate with his approach more closely. He was not as sure-footed on recruitment as he was elsewhere, but then again he is entering a new structure which is not yet settled itself. “I think it has to be all together because if you are a coach coming here and already chose the players, you could be wrong because the club will be here for a long time and you as a coach, you don’t know that,” he said. “We have to improve the process of recruitment, the data. I think it is all together, but the final word should be the manager, not because it is your right but because it is your responsibility. I have to understand the league and then when everything is aligned, everyone is on the same page, we can buy and sell players.” (Top photo: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

He was often responsible for initiating contact with prospective signings and doing some of the less glamorous roles, but Arteta rates him highly. “Very good, Jason and all the team,” said Arteta. “Edu and I probably got a lot of the praise, but the work behind it is done by this guy and Jason has been phenomenal. “It is not easy to wake up one day and having to move to a different office and do a different job, like it was for the team. “But again, the spirit, how people react, how they are willing to (say): ‘Okay, that’s it, that’s the situation, let’s move forward’, with that ambition, and as well with that determination and that enthusiasm, that’s something great.

Every team gets graded based on their performance over the first quarter of the season. Here at Rankings HQ, though, we grade on a curve — every grade is loosely based on expectations. If you’re a good team playing good, that’s cool and all, but that’s about what we expected out of you; an average grade is what you deserve. A good team playing great though? That gets an A, as would a terrible team playing just fine. Just fine is great for Columbus, but it’s horrible for Edmonton. That’s the gist of it — here are our grades. Last week: 1

Dom grade: A+ There are nits to pick with the Jets — some more prime chances at five-on-five wouldn’t hurt, and they’re probably not going to shoot 25 percent on the power play for a full season — but it’d be unfair to do any more than mention them in passing, at this point. It’s been a remarkable start to the season, and, if we’re being honest, a surprising one, too. If they don’t get full marks, who does? Advertisement Last week: 2

Dom grade: A+ We’ve spent the entire first quarter (okay, fine, half decade) talking up the Hurricanes so it should come as no shock that they earn high marks for their start. Every new addition has crushed it to degrees no one could’ve seen coming and the returning players look as strong as ever. They’ve got depth, they’ve got oomph. They’ve got offense, they’ve got defense. Most of all, they’ve got their system and this might be the year it finally pays off. Last week: 5
Sean’s ranking: 3
Dom’s ranking: 3 Sean grade: A
Dom grade: A The Wild just keep on winning. They are now 13-3-3 and proud owners of the second-best points percentage in the league. They’d be division favorites if not for the first-place team, also from the Central. Everything that needed to go right for the Wild this season did, and then some, and they’re back to looking like a legit contender. Kirill Kaprizov is on an MVP run and everyone around him has elevated their games appropriately. Color us impressed, the Wild are the real deal.  Last week: 6

Dom’s ranking: 5 Sean grade: B+
Dom grade: B It’s hard to be too harsh on a 12-5-1 start. The Rangers are still plugging along and winning games at a high rate, but there is still room for concern. They’ve struggled this season against playoff opponents, have seen a rapid decline from Mika Zibanejad, and have had some second pair woes too. A 114-point pace is still a 114-point pace, but the Rangers haven’t exactly been given the toughest test so far. How they fare in Q2 and beyond might be more telling to what they can be. Last week: 4

Dom’s ranking: 4 Sean grade: B
Dom grade: B Advertisement The Stars are getting slow starts from Jason Robertson, Roope Hintz and Wyatt Johnson, but the fact that they’re still clocking in this high is a testament to how good the rest of the roster has been. Let’s start with Matt Duchene, who leads the team in scoring with 21 points. We’d say it’s a throwback to his time in Colorado, but 4.62 points/60 is miles ahead of anything Duchene managed in his first 15 (!) seasons. Last week: 3

Dom grade: A- Losing to the Blackhawks? That’s enough to bump Florida’s grade down from “A” to “A-minus.” Sorry, but we’ve got to be tougher critics against the defending champions. The expectations to keep being the best are very high. So far, though, the Panthers are meeting them. The stars have shone bright and are getting the most out of a makeshift defense corps. Florida has enough sauce to win the Atlantic Division again, and even if the Panthers don’t, they’ll still be a tough out for any team unlucky to face them. Last week: 10
Sean’s ranking: 6
Dom’s ranking: 9 Sean grade: A+
Dom grade: A+ There’s simply no underselling just how impressive Washington’s start to the season has been. If there was a letter grade above “A-plus,” the Capitals would’ve convincingly earned it. Sure, there’s an element of puck luck involved with their start and they may cool down at some point — but that doesn’t change how well this group has played over the first quarter. The kids have taken big steps, the stars have had resurgent seasons, and the team looks deep both up front and on the back end. The Capitals are the best story in hockey and we’re enjoying the ride. Last week: 9

Dom’s ranking: 8 Sean grade: B+
Dom grade: B+ Advertisement A lot of people figured the Devils would get back on the contention path after a surprising down season, and that’s exactly what we’ve seen from them so far. Sheldon Keefe deserves a lot of credit here for the team’s defensive improvement; the Devils are in the top 10 for xGA/60 after finishing 20th last season. They looked especially good against Carolina in that regard Thursday night. Last week: 11
Sean’s ranking: 10
Dom’s ranking: 6 Sean grade: B+
Dom grade: B+ The Leafs woke up on Thursday in first place in their division (and ahead of their preseason points projection) despite Auston Matthews not playing since Nov. 3. They’ve now got six players on injured reserve. That alone gets them reeeeally close to an “A” — and if they keep it together much longer, we’ll have to revisit. Last week: 7

Dom’s ranking: 10 Sean grade: A
Dom grade: A- It’s business as usual for Vegas who are on pace for 107 points. That gets an A-grade from us thanks to playing at a much stronger pace than we figured given how weak their wingers looked to start the season. That the Golden Knights have survived lately with Mark Stone missing time (something we all assumed would happen at some point), makes it even more impressive. Pavel Dorofeyev, by the way, is on pace for 41 goals. That unexpected leap certainly helps! Last week: 12

Dom grade: B The Lightning deserve two grades: one for Andrei Vasilevskiy games (yay!) and one for Jonas Johansson games (boooooo). The difference between the two has been stark, enough to leave the Lightning at a solid B.

Dom’s ranking: 15 Sean grade: B+
Dom grade: B+ Lockdown defense (1.95 goals against per 60 at five-on-five) and juiced-up offensive production put the Kings solidly ahead of their preseason projections.

The Avalanche have played commendable hockey despite all the absences and things are starting to turn around of late now that they’re getting healthier. Still, it’s hard to give anything higher than a C right now. Yes, their circumstances were tough, but the work they’ve handed in so far still leaves a bit to be desired. Last week: 14

Dom’s ranking: 13 Sean grade: D-
Dom grade: D We’re not mad, we’re just disappointed. Once again, the Oilers got off to an extremely slow start where Connor McDavid looked a bit off before being sidelined with injury, and Stuart Skinner forgot how to make a save. The “D” stands for “deja vu.” Advertisement Will the Oilers be better going forward? Probably. They should still be able to challenge for the Pacific Division title despite their tepid start. But we expected a whole lot better from the team many expected to be the league’s absolute best going into the season. It’s not enough to just show up to the regular season — you have to put in the work. The Oilers are learning that lesson all over again. Last week: 22

Dom grade: A Raise your hand if you had the Flames fifth in the West after the first quarter with an 11-6-3 record. No one? Not a single soul? We didn’t think so. Few starts have been more shocking this year than Calgary’s and while we wait for the other shoe to drop, the Flames just find a way and keep winning. Blame Dustin Wolf who is showing some serious juice as a full-time starter. His work during an audition last year left a lot to be desired, but he’s made up for it quickly this year.

We’ll use this space to mention Alex Tuch for the first time in a while; he’s tied for the team lead in points (18) and scored a couple shorthanded goals along the way. When he, Tage Thompson and JJ Peterka are on the ice together, good things happen. Last week: 16

Dom grade: D+ With five minutes left against Detroit Thursday night, the Islanders were up 1-0. Five minutes later they went home empty-handed with not even a beloved loser point to hold on to. It was yet another missed opportunity for an Islanders team that’s been on the wrong side of mid this season. We thought this would be a 95-point team, not an 85-point one — and they’re not even on pace for that. Advertisement The Islanders are dealing with a lot of injuries so they get a slight pass for that. But this is how you re-pay us for actually believing in you guys? The good news? The rest of the Eastern playoff hopefuls look just as bad right now, so the Islanders haven’t technically lost much ground yet. Brutal, brutal loss to end the road trip for #Isles. Sixth time this season they’ve allowed a tying/go-ahead goal inside of 5 minutes to go in the 3rd. Doesn’t matter who’s in the lineup, who’s injured — a damning number of points given away. — Arthur Staple (@StapeAthletic) November 22, 2024  Last week: 23

Dom grade: C The Kraken projected as an aggressively mediocre team ahead of the season, and they’ve delivered on that potential. A middle-of-the-table team, almost across the board.

Dom grade: F- The Bruins looked a lot better (on the power play anyway) in their first game under Joe Sacco, but there’s a lot of damage that still needs to be undone. It’s not like we expected the Bruins to be world beaters by any means, but what they’ve shown so far has been nothing short of pathetic. It was difficult to watch Jim Montgomery try to coax a weak and flawed roster into looking like a contender and he ultimately paid the price for the sins of Don Sweeney. Maybe Sacco presses the right buttons to get the team back on track — it’s not like the rest of the East poses much of a threat — but it’ll take a helluva turnaround. When a team with playoff aspirations has to fire their coach because they’re tied for second last in goal differential with the San Jose Sharks, an F-minus is the only fair grade that can be given.

Dom grade: C How you feel about the Red Wings’ start depends a lot on how you felt about the Red Wings to start. The Model viewed them as an 81-point team and at 8-9-2 they are pretty much exactly what they were expected to be. But damn is it still disappointing to see it actually happen in practice. Moritz Seider looks great, Simon Edvinsson might be the real deal, and the goaltending has been actually solid. And yet the team still stinks. It’s possible that Thursday’s comeback regulation win over the Islanders can serve as a turning point, but it’s still been an ugly, ugly start. The Red Wings just don’t look good enough.

Dom grade: C- “This year will be different!” Whoops! To Ottawa’s credit, the team’s underlying numbers are indeed much improved and it is tragically ironic that the team’s major offseason fix is currently the biggest problem. If Linus Ullmark looks like Linus Ullmark more often, the Senators might be fine. But he hasn’t and so here we are. The strong xG might mean they earn a better grade in Q2. For Q1, it’s hard to give a team that was supposed to make some sort of leap much credit for an 8-10-1 start. Last week: 18

Dom grade: C- Things started so well for Utah in its inaugural season but have imploded since. Losing Sean Durzi stung, as did the news of John Marino being out long-term. But even with those losses on the back end, Utah should be better than what they’ve shown over the last month. The team’s offense has felt anemic most nights and Connor Ingram has been a shade of himself between the pipes. There was some hope that Utah could climb to relevancy this season after a big offseason, but instead it’s been more of the same. Advertisement Last week: 29

Dom grade: A- Everyone in the hockey world hoped for nothing but the best for Columbus this season and thankfully that’s exactly what we’re getting. The team is winning games in thrilling ways, they’re seeing breakthroughs from some young players, Zach Werenski looks like a truly elite No. 1 defenseman (he had five points against the Lightning!) and Sean Monahan is channeling his best self to play the best hockey of his career.

Credit Lukas Dostal’s heroics and a three-game winning streak for that one. But man does this team still look rough on a nightly basis. We’ll give them a pass because a win is a win, but even a record well above expectations isn’t enough for high marks when the Ducks are still getting caved in and the young core has seemingly regressed.

In other words — Q1 could not have gone better. The Flyers look better positioned for a high pick thanks to their weak start which should get their rebuild back on track. On top of that, all the players the team needs to look good are looking great right now.

The 39-year-old cut a confident figure as he smiled throughout his first pre-match press conference, being asked about Jose Mourinho, his playing style and his influence on the club's recruitment, among other things. On Sunday, he will take charge of his first Premier League match as his side face Ipswich Town away from home at 4:30pm GMT/11:30am ET — the match will be covered live on The Athletic. Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here. With his first press conference under his belt, Ruben Amorim will now be turning his full attention towards Sunday afternoon's visit to Ipswich. It is in the primetime slot (4:30pm GMT/11:30am ET) and will be covered live here on The Athletic — here is the full Premier League schedule this weekend. Saturday Sunday Monday Advertisement With so much to ask Amorim in such a short time period, there were no questions on the injured players in the Manchester United squad. Although, it is worth staying tuned to The Athletic between now and Sunday for updates on the likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Lisandro Martinez and Harry Maguire who will all hope to play a role against Ipswich. One of Amorim's more interesting answers came after he was asked whether the United role is one of football's impossible jobs. The new man outlined each of the post-Ferguson managers (bar David Moyes) and what they brought to the club, before saying ""You have different coaches, the same results. We will try to do Ineos way, my way."" It's far too early to say whether Amorim will be a success at United. But you do get the sense he's not going to compromise on his ideals this season. Amorim cut a relaxed and confident figure in his first press conference.  The 39-year-old was asked multiple questions about his compatriot Jose Mourinho, but was keen to stress he is his own man. ""I am a different guy."" was one of his more repeated phrases. Fans will find it hard not to nod along as Amorim outlined his belief in the squad and the things needed to improve. United's new head coach brought up his age, and how it might help him relate to a new generation of players. He also brought up how his club need to improve their physicality and get better at tracking back. That's all from Ruben Amorim in his first press conference as Manchester United head coach. And we want to hear your thoughts. Let us know what you thought to Amorim's first meeting with the media by emailing us at livebloguk@theathletic.com. Amorim was very clear in his response when asked whether he will look to implement his playing style immediately at United. ""As a coach you have to choose one way or another, I choose always 100 percent our way. ""I choose to risk a bit. I believe so much in our way of playing, they will believe too. There is no second way. ""We will adapt some players because we don’t have a different profile. Maybe on Sunday you will see the starting 11 and not feel a lot of change but you will see it in the game and the positioning or where they receive the ball."" Advertisement Amorim was asked how important it is to rebuild the belief within a group of players who have gotten used to disappointment this season. ""That is for sure but it is normal when players don’t win games, you start to be suspicious of the way of playing. You can understand when they walk to the game or the warm up, you can understand if they are confident or not. ""I think they have to help them but they are ready to cope with the demands of games in the Premier League. You see sometimes they have a bad first half and then second half they will change, so they have to find that mindset."" Amorim's clear belief in his abilities comes through loud and clear, even if there is humility also. He acknowledges that changing formation midway through a season is a risk, but he is 100 per cent confident in his methods. The players may be similar on Sunday against Ipswich, but their positions will change, he says. Whether some of these players can adapt remains to be seen, but he is adamant they all want to get on the pitch anywhere right now — even as goalkeeper. I asked Amorim if the players are open to playing in different positions to the ones they played in under Ten Hag. ""They want to play. In this first moment, they just want to play, so it is easy. ""In the future, we will see. You can watch on TV but you have to train with them to see if they can play in different positions. Everyone wants to play now, if they have the opportunity to play as a goalkeeper, they will. They are open to change some positions. No manager has lasted three full seasons yet at United since Sir Alex Ferguson left, but Amorim feels two and a half years — the length of his contract — is enough to know if he's the right man for the job. ""I have two years and a half of contract. I think two years you can understand if I am the right manager to go in this process. ""We will need more time, if you look to the other clubs who are winning this league, they are doing this process for a long time. But they are winning, that's why they time to do their project. ""I understand we will need more than two and a half years, we have to win something, somewhere but in two years you can understand if you want to continue on this path or change. We'll see how long it will take."" A trickier question followed for Amorim, one hooked on his belief in the same group of players who 'got Ten Hag sacked'. ""It is belief, you have to believe and I believe in them. When I started this week, you can say one week three training (sessions) but they are open to different things.  ""The only thing I ask is hard work and you have to believe in the new idea and I felt that. Until they prove me wrong, I believe in the players."" Advertisement The old favourite 'impossible job' was then brought up before Amorim was asked what he views as his biggest challenge. ""I really don’t know the biggest challenge, I will found out during these months. ""You had here different types of coaches; the guys that won everything like Van Gaal and Mourinho, the new ones that knew the club inside out like Solskjaer then one of the best outside the top five leagues in Ten Hag. We have to improve as a club and acknowledge we need time, every coach needs time and we have to win games. ""You have different coaches, the same results. We will try to do our way, the INEOS way and my way."" Asked again if it was the impossible job, he said: ""No, of course not. I believe that. ""Call me naïve but I believe I am the right guy in the right moment. I could be wrong but the earth will still turn so I'm not worried about that. I truly believe I am the right guy."" United fans have been curious to know of the difference between Amorim being a head coach rather than a manager. The new United man is not thought to have the same level of input on player trading as his predecessors, and will share duties with Dan Ashworth, Jason Wilcox and others. However, don't think players will arrive at the club without his say so. That was clear from his answer to the last question, particularly where he said he has a ""great responsibility"" when choosing players. A key question on recruitment was the next one that Amorim faced. ""I think it has to be all together because if you are a coach coming here and already chose the players, you could be wrong because the club will be here for a long time and you as a coach, you don’t know that. ""We have to improve the process of recruitment; the data and the profile of the players we want. I have to have a strong position on that because I'm the coach. I think it is all together, but the final word should be the manager, not because it is your right but because it is your responsibility. ""I have to understand the league — that is important — and then when everything is aligned, everyone is on the same page, we can buy and sell players."" Amorim has repeated a couple of times how he feels he is the right man in the right moment for United. He acknowledges that unlike Jose Mourinho, his compatriot who he worked under during an internship at United, he does not arrive as a European champion — but he has a clear idea for how his team will play, even if that means some adaptation from players. Another question about Mourinho, this time on his start to life in England with his famous 'special one' press conference. ""First thing, not just on me but all the Portuguese coaches, he showed we can be the best in the world from a small country. But I am different from Mourinho.  ""You look at Mourinho and felt he could win everywhere, he was European champion and I am not. I'm a different guy in a different moment. Football nowadays is different and I think I am the right person for this moment, because I am a young guy, I understand the players. ""Mourinho at Chelsea, the young guys were like Lampard and nowadays is so much different."" Advertisement The new United head coach was asked where he can make some easy wins in improving the team from the one that has struggled this season. ""In simple things, I think, if you want to speak about the team and the way we play, I think we lose the ball too often, we have to be better at running back, I think that is clear for everyone and I think we have to be very good on the details. ""Sometimes we are hoping to change big things, but I think it is the small things. We have to improve on the small things. In the small things, I think I can help these players a lot."" Amorim was then asked if he had heard from Jose Mourinho after taking the job. ""He sent me a message, he told me that it's a lovely club, a big club with lovely people. In that he is correct, it still is. ""But a lot of things change, we are in a different building now, we are building a new one. I am a different guy and I hope to teach something to my players. ""The club is still big, it is still the best club in England and we want to win. That's all."" Asked about his ideas regarding playing style, Amorim gave a thoughtful response. ""It is not revolution. Football is not so different with five players at the back, three players at the back or four players at the back. ""I cannot see (it will be) evolution, we have to wait and see. But we will play a different type of football. We have our ideas. I'm not saying they're the best ideas but it is our way of seeing football. ""It's not revolution or evolution, it's change.""",2024-11-22,1,0.49,0.51

Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here  The Mercedes Friday pace shines through once again in FP2. Lewis Hamilton ends the day fastest, which is a good sign after his recent struggles. I'm still uncertain the team will have the pace to best Ferrari and McLaren, which are definitely in the ballpark at the front. Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez didn't go for a soft tire run in FP2, meaning it's hard to say where Red Bull stacks up in the competitive picture. But watching Verstappen's onboard, he really didn't seem comfortable with the balance of the car. The Austin upgrade was intended to help improve the connection he felt between the car and the road, and while there has been progress, today wasn't the most ringing endorsement of a step forward. For F1, there'll be positivity that Thursday went by without a hitch for its sessions. I am curious about the lack of fans in the main grandstand, though. Yes, it's cold out, but I'd expect to have seen more today. Let's see if it picks up through the rest of the weekend.  Advertisement Getty Images 11. Valtteri Bottas - Kick Sauber: +1.195 12.

Lando Norris follows him in P2, just a tenth behind, with George Russell in third a further tenth behind.  The hour has run out on Free Practice 2. We'll bring you the full results of the session shortly.  Williams issues an update explaining why Alex Albon was forced to stop out on track, causing the brief red flag. ""The team attempted to repair Alex’s fuel system and participate in the remainder of FP2, however the issue has persisted which unfortunately forced the car to stop on track.  ""We will investigate further after the session."" Advertisement McLaren CEO Zak Brown speaks to Sky Sports' broadcast and says that while Mercedes and Ferrari look fast, he believes his team is ""in with a shout"" for qualifying as well. He also touched on the battle the drivers are fighting to find grip: ""The track is very slippery, and every driver is struggling to get the perfect lap in."" Luke Smith I’m up on the roof of the paddock building. It’s only practice, but it’s very noticeable how empty the main grandstand is. I’d say it’s only about 40% full.  Getty Images Max Verstappen had only just completed his first lap on the soft tires when the red flag was thrown. Despite a poor lap that left him in the bottom five, he's come back out on medium tires for the remaining running in FP2.  Alex Albon's car has been removed from the track and the drivers are free to resume running.  Alex Albon, whose car was being worked on for an issue with its fuel system about 10 minutes ago, has stopped out on track, causing a red flag. His car will need to be recovered before drivers can resume running. FP2 has 22 minutes left and counting.  Advertisement Getty Images All the drivers are moving to the soft tires now. George Russell goes fastest with a 1:34.015. Carlos Sainz slots into second, less than a tenth behind. Lewis Hamilton sits in third followed by Charles Leclerc in fourth not far behind.

George Russell follows in second less than two tenths behind, with Carlos Sainz another tenth behind him. Lewis Hamilton and Lando Norris round out the top five.  All the drivers have set their best times using the medium except for Lance Stroll and Franco Colapinto, who have run the softs.  Getty Images Turn 14, which comes at the end of the Las Vegas Strip straight, is the one catching drivers out at the moment. Max Verstappen is the latest to lock up and need the run-off area to slow his car down.

FP1 saw significant track evolution as more rubber was laid down, I expect we'll see more of the same here.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Why the 76ers' season is already at a crossroads. Plus, time for the NBA Panic Panel!",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940127/2024/11/22/paul-george-joel-embiid-tyrese-maxey-76ers-nba-the-bounce/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 14:43:25 GMT",Zach Harper catches you up on leaguewide news.,"NBA The Bounce Newsletter  | This is The Athletic’s daily NBA newsletter. Sign up here to receive The Bounce directly in your inbox. I love movies, but I am always careful about when I see them in the theaters. I don’t like crowded theaters, so I try to go during off times. With that said, tonight, I am willingly seeing “Gladiator II” on opening night. That’s how excited I am for it. The 76ers are really in trouble, everyone The story of the week has been the 76ers’ disastrous start to this season. Joel Embiid has played in four games, but they haven’t won any of them. Paul George has played in eight games, yet Philly is 1-7 in those – likewise for Tyrese Maxey. Overall, the Sixers are 2-12. That’s the worst record in the league. Entering the season, they had the league’s eighth-best championship odds. They also have the worst offense in the NBA, George just hyperextended his knee for the second time in about a month and there was a team meeting that immediately got leaked to the media. Advertisement The Sixers are a trainwreck right now. The information from the team meeting following a big loss to the Heat wasn’t all that damning, really. Maxey told his good friend Embiid he needs to be on time for everything. It sounds like there was good conversation about how players want to be coached and how coaches want the players to approach things. However, the takeaway from the Sixers about this report was wondering how it got leaked. Embiid called whoever leaked it, “a real piece of s—” (perhaps he was quoting). Embiid then kind of played the victim a bit in his comments while sort of taking accountability for what’s going on. PG spoke on his own podcast with teammate Reggie Jackson about all things Sixers and the team meeting. Both of them couldn’t believe the meeting information got out.  You can excuse so much of the lack of success so far with the injuries, and it’s a real reason why they’re bad. But this bad? That can’t be real. They’ve been eviscerated when Embiid, George or Maxey are on the floor. And the trio has only played six minutes together. Rookie Jared McCain has been their best player on the season. On his podcast, PG said this: “To be quite frank, he’s been our most consistent player on the floor so far… We definitely have to step our shit up because he can’t be our most consistent player.” There are two things keeping people from completely burying the Sixers right now. First, I think people still believe that a healthy, in-shape version of this team can be dangerous in a playoff scenario. This team was supposed to contend … for the title, not Cooper Flagg (although their pick is top-six-protected in this lottery). Second, the East is so atrocious that they still have so much time to get into the top six in the conference. They have so much time in general, but the Sixers haven’t shown anything to believe in them yet. Maybe they haven’t had a true chance because of the injuries, but they still need to show us something. Luka Dončić is out with a wrist injury 🏀 Mavs star is out at least a week. Dončić hurt his wrist in the blowout win over New Orleans. He’ll be reevaluated next week. 🏀 What is each team’s biggest concern so far? The Athletic’s NBA staff has the answers. 🫡 Hubie Brown will call one more game. The 91-year-old legend will be scheduled at some point on ESPN this season for one final celebration. Salute to one of the greatest.  Advertisement 🇺🇸🏆 The Celtics go to Washington! They celebrated their championship at the White House. And owner Wyc Grousbeck shed light on when he might be out. 🤕 Cade Cunningham got hurt. In Detroit’s overtime loss in Charlotte, Cunningham took a hard fall in the fourth quarter and appeared to hurt his tailbone.

Now would be a good time for both to play like they did in last year’s tournament. On a scale of 1-10, how bad is it for Philly?
 We’re not done with the 2-12 Sixers! Because this situation has become so dire, I decided to assemble The Panic Panel! Whenever a situation calls for it, TPP can give us a shot of reality. I decided to phone a friend (or five) to ask them a very simple, yet important question: On a scale of 1-10, how f— are the 76ers and why? Jason Concepcion | Writer, podcaster and Knicks fan: I have it at 7 and mounting. Why not higher? It’s early in the season, Embiid and PG certainly could start playing better, and McCain is a bright spot. That said, what we’re witnessing is a basketball coup. This is Maxey’s team now. The only way Joel gets it back, is by asserting his dominance by continuing to come in late until HE DECIDES when to come in on time. Ian Karmel | Comedian, podcaster and writer, and Blazers fan: 7. That’s the highest I can give a Philly team while the Cowboys are this bad. Pablo Torre | Podcaster and Process Truster: 8. I think it’s safe to say that the Sixers were significantly more fun when they were trying to lose games on purpose. Mo Dakhil | Writer, podcaster and former NBA video coordinator: 7. It looks like a complete disaster in Philadelphia with all the injuries and the team meeting leaks. That said, if Philly can get healthy, it can go on a run. The Sixers are only four games out of the sixth seed; that’s a good week in the NBA. The challenge is that the turnaround has to begin now, and the margin for error is low. If the Sixers were in the West, this would be a 100 on a scale of 1 to 10. Advertisement Jay King | Celtics beat writer, podcaster and Gerry McNamara fan: Forty? Four hundred? Four billion? They are beyond f—. They are built to win now, with Joel Embiid at 30 and Paul George at 34, and have won two of their first 14 games. Even if Embiid and George work themselves back into top form, which doesn’t feel like a given after their hobbled starts, the supporting cast around them does not appear ready for the big time. The 76ers rank dead last in offense. That means they haven’t scored as much as the Trail Blazers or Wizards. Sure, the injuries have sunk the 76ers, but does anybody trust Embiid and George to both stay healthy? Even Philadelphia’s most promising development, Jared McCain’s immediate readiness, comes with complications. Can a team really defend at a championship level with two 6-foot-3 players in the top four? I haven’t even discussed the locker room, which is already in flames, based on all of the reporting. Though lucky the rest of the Eastern Conference is also in shambles, the 76ers are headed nowhere good. Magic end Lakers’ six-game win streak The Lakers were up four points with 27 seconds left in the game after Anthony Davis split two free throws. Then, Franz Wagner hit a layup, and the Magic played the foul game again. They were just desperate to find a win on the second night of a back-to-back in L.A. after the Clippers ended their six-game win streak the night before. Davis then missed both free throws with 18 seconds left, setting the stage for Wagner to be the hero. He put on his cape and knocked down a 3-pointer with 2.1 seconds left to put the Magic up 119-118. The Lakers inbounded to AD, who then missed a turnaround 18-footer by a lot. Wagner had 37 points, 11 assists, six rebounds and four steals and outdueled LeBron James in the fourth. He’s been playing out of his mind lately, as the Magic have won seven of eight. LeBron and AD combined for 70 points and 19 rebounds. Hornets 123 (6-9), Pistons 121 (7-10) in OT: The Hornets and Pistons only play close, tense games apparently. Earlier this season, Brandon Miller got a tip-in at the buzzer to beat Detroit. Charlotte needed him to take over in this one, and he did. Miller scored eight of his 38 points in overtime, after LaMelo Ball fouled out literally one second into the extra period. Ball had 35 points and nine assists. The most impressive part of this game from Miller was definitely snatching the transition lob.  Raptors 110 (4-12), Wolves 105 (8-7): The biggest takeaway from this game on the internet will be the Julius Randle-Rudy Gobert-Anthony Edwards moment. And it was a pretty hilarious/dramatic moment. My takeaway is this Raptors team is starting to get healthy, and they are better than their record. Scottie Barnes had 17 points and six assists in his first game back after missing 11 games. RJ Barrett had 31 points and Chris Boucher had 22 off the bench. Everybody’s takeaway should be that this is the only court the Raptors should have:  Spurs 126 (8-8), Jazz 118 (3-12): If you were wondering why the Jazz are one of the worst defensive teams in the league, just go watch the fourth quarter of this game. They gave up 41 points to a Spurs team without Victor Wembanyama. Eight different players scored in double figures for San Antonio, led by Harrison Barnes’ 25 points. Spurs rookie Stephon Castle had another strong game … LeBron James is taking notice. 📫 Love The Bounce? Check out The Athletic’s other newsletters.

White played the full game in the 1-1 draw with Chelsea before the break but he has been dealing with multiple issues since the start of the season. Advertisement The 27-year-old has been a virtual ever-present when fit over the past two seasons but he started on the bench against Manchester City in September and then missed the next two fixtures. Jurrien Timber and Thomas Partey have played at right back in his absence and Arteta will now need to call on the duo during a busy festive schedule. “Ben is gonna be out for months, unfortunately,” Arteta said on Friday. “It’s been different kinds of struggles. It’s never been the same thing. We had to make a decision. It’s not been improving in the last few weeks, unfortunately. “We know that Ben is going to push every boundary but it got to a point where we have to protect the player and we decided to do the surgery. He agreed with that and unfortunately, that’s going to keep him out for a few months.” Arteta could not confirm exactly how long White will be missing for. “I don’t know at the moment,” the Spaniard said. “We have to see how he reacts post-surgery. I don’t expect him to be half a year, but I cannot tell you exactly.” White being out for this length of time is a blow for Arsenal, just as it felt they were getting the majority of their squad back fit. The chemistry down the right flank is fundamental to Arsenal’s attacking play and it has already been disrupted by Martin Odegaard’s ankle ligament injury which kept him out for two months. Arteta would have hoped to have his trusted trio — White, Odegaard and Bukayo Saka — available for a prolonged period of time but White’s injury now forces him to recalibrate his thinking. Full-back has been an area in which injuries have dogged Arsenal most often this season with Timber, Calafiori, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Kieran Tierney and Takehiro Tomiyasu all missing games through injury, or the entire season so far in the case of the latter two. Advertisement Timber played at right back in White’s absence and was outstanding in his three Premier League games there, but he has had to deputise at left-back the past month as Calafiori received treatment for a knee injury. But Timber has also suffered a couple of niggles that saw Thomas Partey shifted to right back. The Netherlands international is the most likely to start at right-back against Forest and his more conventional skillset should allow him to support Saka with overlapping runs. Saka has been increasingly doubled up on and against Newcastle he was isolated with the lack of team-mates to drag defenders away from him. Arteta has only named the same full-back combination in back-to-back Premier League matches on three occasions this season. Timber and Calafiori is the only pairing that has played three consecutive games but both offer Arsenal the ability to invert, dribble and attack the final third, arguably giving Arteta his most fluid and flexible mix of full-backs. GO DEEPER After an unusually difficult start, is this the moment Arsenal's season really begins? There was better news on some other fitness doubts, including Leandro Trossard who picked up a hamstring injury on international duty with Belgium, and England duo Declan Rice and Bukayo Saka who stayed at Arsenal after hobbling off against Chelsea. “Trossard seems to be OK,” Arteta added. “He trained this morning and he seems to be feeling good. We will assess everything with the doctor right now. But that’s good. “Bukayo and Declan as well. They had the first partial session today. So, very good as well.” White’s absence may be mitigated with the return of left-back Riccardo Calafiori, who is also fighting to be in contention after missing five games with a knee injury. “Riccy trained today,” he said. “His rehab has gone really well. He was able to do certain things last week with the physios. He trained on the pitch this week, he trained with us today as well. He will be in the squad.” (Photos: Justin Setterfield/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Eze has been absent since sustaining a hamstring problem in the first half of Palace’s 2-1 Carabao Cup victory over Villa on October 30, and was eager to return for the Premier League clash but Glasner has ruled him out of contention. Advertisement There is better news for Palace with Will Hughes returning from suspension after missing the 2-0 defeat by Fulham before the international break after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season. Palace’s players were given the first week of the break off, while those returning from injury trained for the entire fortnight. Cheick Doucoure came through an hour of a behind closed doors under-21 friendly during the international break unscathed and also trained with the under-21 side. Jefferson Lerma is available again after missing the last two games with a hamstring injury. Eddie Nketiah is still out, while there is hope Adam Wharton could return after Palace’s match with Newcastle United next week. GO DEEPER Injuries for Eze and Wharton should not obscure growing signs of a Palace resurgence “Ebs would like to be involved in tomorrow’s game, but I took the decision not to take him with us to Villa,’ Glasner said. “It’s a little bit too risky. He trained during the week, but it’s too near when (the injury) happened. “We have to protect the players. When we see our schedule after the Villa game, with eight games in December, we can’t take any risks. We had a long chat today, because he’s very ambitious. He’s a great guy, he worked really hard and he wanted to be with us. “He feels he’s ready, and it’s him who wants to play. I want him to play but we have to protect him. Yes we lose him for one game, but we win eight or nine days. Maybe then we win eight games, and we all hope to win at the Emirates in the Carabao Cup. “We have 15 games in December and January, and we need him for 15 games, not just one.” Glasner confirmed he has held discussions with chairman Steve Parish and sporting director Dougie Freedman about the January transfer window, and says he would like to increase the number of players at his disposal. The manager took the decision to limit his squad to 20 senior outfield players, which has been further depleted by injuries, but is now looking to add reinforcements. “We talked before (the break), about the plan for January. We found an agreement and talked about it.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Sharks stock report: Who's up and who's down through 22 games?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940005/2024/11/22/sharks-nhl-stock-up-stock-down/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 13:56:31 GMT",The Sharks are through a quarter of the season. It’s a good time to take stock of individual performances.,"NHL It might not seem like much to go from 5-15-2 to 6-11-5 from one year to the next, but the San Jose Sharks could tell you how it feels different now. In Ryan Warsofsky’s first season as head coach, the Sharks are no NHL big shot. But this revamped club is not the pushover it was on numerous nights last season. The Sharks are still at the bottom of the Pacific Division and on the lowest rung of the 32 teams, but Warsofsky has them in virtually every game and even winning points in a few close ones. Advertisement Take a late third-period goal in Philadelphia that got them a point. Or erasing a three-goal deficit in Pittsburgh to force another overtime. Or their most recent game Thursday in St. Louis where Alex Wennberg scored with 8.8 seconds left to pull the Sharks into another extra session, making two points possible when they shouldn’t have been. Even a road loss to one of the league’s best in Dallas had them one shot away from another tie game until the Stars iced the win with two empty-net goals. The Sharks aren’t good, and they’ve only begun building a new foundation, but this won’t be a club that finishes with only 19 wins or a minus-150 goal differential. Wins against them won’t come as easy. “We’ve come to believe that and come to feel that, understand that we’re never going to give up,” Warsofsky said. “We can come back from any deficit. We’ve done a good job of that this year. There’s obviously some areas in the game that can continue to improve. “I give a lot of credit to the group in there to stick together. We’ve been through a lot the first 22 games. Even this last 2 ½ weeks the travel, the time change, the difference. We haven’t practiced much. The execution was a little bit lower the last couple games. I think more fatigue kind of set in a little bit.” One-fourth of their schedule is behind them and it’s a good time to take stock of performances through the roster. We’ll keep Yarsolav Askarov out of this as he’s played only one game with the Sharks, but his debut Thursday was an auspicious one as he shook off a Nathan Walker goal 11 seconds in and stopped 29 of 31 Blues shots. We’ll also leave out Logan Couture and Thomas Bordeleau as Couture hasn’t played as he deals with injury issues and Bordeleau has been in the AHL after being set back by a lower-body injury through the preseason. Macklin Celebrini, Mackenzie Blackwood, Mikael Granlund, William Eklund, Fabian Zetterlund Let’s see, there are the four goals and three assists that Celebrini has totaled in only 10 games that he’s played. Or what about the strong backchecking that he’s already committed to doing as an 18-year-old center playing top-six minutes? Or that he’ll keep his team alive with a diving play to break up a sure empty-net goal? Or that each charge into the offensive zone invokes excitement and possibility? Maybe we’ll just consider what he did on Monday for his first game-winning goal. MACKLIN CELEBRINI IN OVERTIME!  HIS FIRST NHL GAME-WINNING GOAL!#TheFutureIsTeal pic.twitter.com/cMOjEA2Hyf — Hockey Daily 365 l NHL Highlights & News (@HockeyDaily365) November 19, 2024  Celebrini missed 12 games due to a hip issue and it hasn’t been perfect (Wednesday’s game in Dallas is an example). He has ground to make up in the Calder Trophy conversation, but some good health and production on the power play could close the gap on early leading candidates, such as Matvei Michkov and Logan Stankoven. Advertisement Blackwood, meanwhile, isn’t going to be among any league leaders, but he’s been outstanding with a .908 save percentage while saving nearly four more goals than expected, per MoneyPuck. The impending free agent also had a 44-save shutout against his former club, the New Jersey Devils. There’s a reason Warsofsky has reunited Granlund with Eklund and Zetterlund as his wingers. They just work together. Last season’s best line is leading the way again. Granlund’s great revival in San Jose continues as he’s at a point-per-game pace while scoring nine times and leading the team in assists (15) and points (24). Eklund had an early stretch of seven points in seven games and is now cooking again with seven points in his last six, including a two-goal game against the Red Wings. Zetterlund isn’t shooting the puck as much, but he’s scoring at a higher rate while posting better defensive metrics in 5-on-5 play. Tyler Toffoli, Jake Walman, Alexander Wennberg, Timothy Liljegren Toffoli has given San Jose immediate payoff for its $24 million investment with a hot start and another current goal spurt to lead the club with nine. The one thing that keeps him from the “stock way up” column is that the Sharks give up more defensively at 5-on-5 when he’s on the ice. Walman has been the team’s best defenseman. He plays a high-event game that can get him into trouble on occasion, but it’s also produced chances the Sharks have capitalized on. He’s flourishing after getting lost in the crowded defense mix in Detroit. He has 10 points in his last eight games and he’s a plus player at even strength. Wennberg has helped the Sharks upgrade at the center position. The 30-year-old Swede is doing what the team needs need in the third-line role. He’s been their best defensive forward when it comes to expected goals against per 60 minutes of 5-on-5 play (2.44); he’s winning faceoffs at a career-best 54.4 percent and he has chipped in two overtime winners. Advertisement Meanwhile, the Sharks are seeing the strong underlying numbers that Liljegren brought to Toronto and there’s nothing wrong with having a plus-1 rating in 10 games since the trade. Will Smith, Vitek Vaněček, Jack Thompson, Henry Thrun, Luke Kunin, Ty Dellandrea, Barclay Goodrow, Carl Grundstrom, Nico Sturm The 19-year-old Smith is still finding his stride while occasionally sitting as part of a development plan. He has been moved to the wing and is now playing on a line with Celebrini. It’s tough to be too critical of someone just starting out in the NHL, even if he was a top-five pick in his draft year. Smith, who got both of his goals on Oct. 31 against Chicago after not appearing on the scoresheet in his first eight games, has flashed his vision and playmaking, but it’s also taken him some time to find the right pace consistently. While Blackwood has stepped forward as the No. 1 in goal, Vaněček has been capable in most of his starts. Two games — a seven-spot allowed against Vegas and his last injury-abbreviated outing in Pittsburgh — have skewed his numbers worse than what his play has been. Thompson has shown some offensive instincts from the blue line, but the pickup of the right-shooting Liljegren has cut into his ice time. Thrun handled more minutes when Walman was sidelined for a few games, but the third-pairing role suits him as he tries to keep a spot that younger, high-upside prospects are pushing toward. The remaining five are doing what you would expect from veteran grinders mostly slotted on the bottom two lines. All have made the Sharks deeper up front and more competitive on a nightly basis. Kunin and Sturm, who are on expiring deals, are the holdovers from last season. Kunin’s gritty play sets an example for more talented mates to follow, while Sturm remains a faceoff ace and penalty killer properly suited as their 4C. Goodrow, Dellandrea and Grundstrom are the additions and won’t put up many points, but they’ll battle and compete. If anything, Goodrow is probably playing more minutes than he should. Mario Ferraro, Jan Rutta, Danil Gushchin, Givani Smith There weren’t any expectations of the Sharks’ defense morphing into a group that squeezed the life out of teams, but three regulars who eat a consistent number of minutes on the blue line being in this section isn’t a promising sign. Advertisement The good thing with Walman’s overall fine play is that it takes some of the load off Ferraro, who was tasked with a top-pairing role last season. The bad thing is that Ferraro’s play has taken a turn for the worse with a little less responsibility. Per Evolving-Hockey, his xGA/60 has shot up to 3.63 after posting a 2.99 in 2023-24. Offense isn’t Ferraro’s forte but he’s a non-factor so far, as is Rutta. Rutta’s defensive metrics are slightly better, but he’s also been tasked with fewer minutes against top lines. Though they’re just two parts to the penalty kill, the unit’s competency helps. (San Jose is tied for 12th). Gushchin is back in the AHL as he couldn’t parlay a strong preseason into a material impact in his 10 games with the Sharks. He had one assist and 13 shots (33 shot attempts) on goal. Smith has long been a part-timer, but after appearing in 36 games last season he has appeared in only five of the first 22 contests. His ice time is also down from 7:49 on average in 2023-24 to 5:47. Cody Ceci, Klim Kostin Going from a Stanley Cup finalist in Edmonton to a recent bottom-feeder with San Jose was going to do a number on Ceci’s metrics. But the veteran, who was acquired from the Oilers in August, has the worst xGA/60 (3.48) among their defensemen. Natural Stat Trick also has him being on the ice for 104 more scoring chances against than what the Sharks create in 5-on-5 play. He’s also been on the ice for 21 even-strength goals against, tying him with Ferraro for the most on the team. The disparity in high-danger chances (99 allowed, 52 generated) outdistances any other player. Even though the offseason changes to the forward group made a spot in the lineup more tenuous, Kostin has been a disappointment. Warsofsky has given the 25-year-old more turns lately, but he hasn’t played 10 minutes in any game since the season’s first week. Kostin has been more physical in his return to action, but he has only eight shots on goal in his 11 contests after scoring five times in 19 games following his acquisition from the Red Wings.

Prior to Gabehart leading the No. 11 team, Hamlin failed to win a race during the 2018 season, led a low number of laps (380) and ranked 11th in points. But during his six years with Gabehart, Hamlin ranked second in the series in wins (22) and laps led (6,072), qualified for the Championship 4 playoff finale three times and ranked fifth or better in points in five of six years.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Jameis Winston is playing just well enough to complicate the Browns' future plans at QB,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5939954/2024/11/22/browns-steelers-jameis-winston/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 13:43:33 GMT",Nothing about this season has been normal. Could Winston serve as a bridge quarterback until the Browns settle on a long-term solution?,"CLEVELAND — The door to the locker room swung open late Thursday night and Jameis Winston jogged down the hallway singing “Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way.”  Winston has certainly been a holiday gift of sorts for the Browns these last few weeks. But he’s also perhaps complicating their plans.  Advertisement In four starts since replacing Deshaun Watson at quarterback, Winston has guided the Browns to a pair of victories — over heavyweight division rivals Baltimore and Pittsburgh, no less. He already leads the team in passing yards and touchdowns, and his charismatic nature has provided some memorable sermons and lighthearted social media clips in what has otherwise been a dreary season and a miserable trudge to the finish line.  Winston’s first snow game Thursday was a success. Yes, he fumbled and threw an interception on a night the Browns inexplicably insisted on continuously throwing the ball in a snowstorm. But he also threw for 219 yards, completed a huge fourth-down pass to Jerry Jeudy in the fourth quarter and handed the Steelers a bitter 24-19 loss on a night weather certainly was a factor.  GO DEEPER Browns stun Steelers 24-19 in snow as Chubb scores late TD: Takeaways We’d already seen the best and worst of Winston seven days apart after he threw for 334 yards and three touchdowns in a win over the Ravens, only to follow it with three interceptions in a loss to the Chargers. That’s who he is. It’s who he’s always been.  I’ve never gotten the impression the Browns ever considered Winston a potential long-term fit at quarterback. It’s worth noting he was demoted to third string not long ago. That was not intended to be a one-week hiatus. The Browns were migrating toward Dorian Thompson-Robinson as the backup as Watson floundered.  When Watson went down with the Achilles injury against the Cincinnati Bengals, I wrote they should turn to Thompson-Robinson — again, with the understanding Winston wasn’t really viewed as a long-term solution. The Browns were able to nab Winston as a free agent on a one-year deal worth $4 million, which is essentially minimum wage for quarterbacks. They tried trading him on cutdown day but found no real offers, so they kept him and eventually released Tyler Huntley.  Advertisement Clearly, in a quarterback-starved league, no one else seemed to believe in him, either. We haven’t seen Winston for an extended period since his infamous 33-touchdown, 30-interception season in Tampa Bay in 2019.  After watching mid-career resurgences by Geno Smith, Sam Darnold and now Baker Mayfield, it would be foolish to assume Winston couldn’t do the same.  JAMEIS WINSTON AIRBORNE IN THE SNOW FOR SIX!#PITvsCLE on Prime VideoAlso streaming on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/BWdtg7I83A — NFL (@NFL) November 22, 2024  Nevertheless, DTR is the quarterback who was drafted here and whom the organization has now invested two years of development.  The biggest flaw to DTR can’t be fixed. He looks too small and fragile to survive an entire season. He gets hurt seemingly every time he plays. The Browns like his potential, and in a lost season it just makes sense to get a long look at a player you drafted and make a definitive conclusion on what he is or isn’t before setting the rest of the offseason quarterback plans. Winston is not allowing that to happen.  Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. Winston is 30 and only 20 months older than Watson. He has a bit of present-day Joe Flacco to him in a body a decade younger. Winston, like Flacco, can spin it for a lot of yards, but the interceptions can also spin a team into a ditch and out of a game quickly.  I wrote near the end of last season Flacco could not return to this team under any circumstance. This franchise was in a much different place a year ago and was still trying to make Watson as comfortable as possible. That’s no longer true. Now it’s about what is best for the franchise moving forward, not Deshaun Watson.  Could Winston, at minimum, serve as a bridge quarterback next year until the Browns settle on a long-term solution? His schtick can wear on teams — again, look at the lack of interest around the league — but there’s little debate he can pile up yards in this league. Since taking over as the starter in Week 8, Winston is among the leaders in yards per pass attempt.  A brrrr-illiant performance by Jameis Winston earned him our Star of the Game ❄️🤩#DawgPound | @RhettNFL | @MJD pic.twitter.com/XEQjSP4vPr — NFL GameDay (@NFLGameDay) November 22, 2024  Now that we have nearly five years of data on Kevin Stefanski, what seems clear is the most important trait in his quarterback is not turning the ball over. At least that’s true when he’s running his offense, not whatever this version is they’re trying to blend with Ken Dorsey as offensive coordinator.  Advertisement If this season has taught the Browns anything, hopefully it’s that Stefanski’s system wasn’t the issue. Kyler Murray has the Arizona Cardinals in first place running the same offense — Cardinals offensive coordinator Drew Petzing was on Stefanski’s staff for three seasons and essentially took this same offense to the desert. The Cardinals are in first place at 6-4 and Murray has often raved this season about how much he loves Petzing’s system.  “Within this system that we have now, I feel like there’s a lot of room to grow,” Murray said in September. “If I can just be myself and play the game, the sky’s the limit.” Murray has 12 touchdowns and three interceptions in 10 games.  If Winston can minimize the turnovers, he’s at least worth looking at as a short-term fix. If he continues as the starter, he might play the Browns out of position to draft one of the top quarterbacks in this draft, which further muddles the plan. It’s a complicated situation with no simple solution that Winston, strangely, isn’t helping by playing well enough to win games.  Nothing about this season has been normal. And a 2-8 team beating an 8-2 division rival on a Thursday night just bakes into this cake of absurd. Stefanski is now 15-13 against the AFC North, which isn’t too bad given the Browns’ history and the quality of the opponents.  GO DEEPER Browns show resilience and poise in grinding out snowstorm win over Steelers For now, the Browns have to keep starting Winston. There was joy in the locker room Thursday night after a big win over a bitter rival. Myles Garrett got to strut after outplaying T.J. Watt following their Defensive Player of the Year verbal feud, Greg Newsome aggravated George Pickens enough that Pickens tried fighting him after the game ended and for only a moment, it felt like Turkey Jones and Terry Bradshaw in this rivalry all over again. Yes, the Steelers are likely headed back to the playoffs and the Browns are headed back to the top of the draft board.  Whether they’ll be looking for a quarterback with the first pick might have to do with how well Winston plays the rest of the season. They’re in a tough spot. I don’t know how he can convince them he’s a capable long-term solution, but I don’t know how they take him out of the position, either. At least not right now.  After Winston finished his postgame interview with the Amazon crew, he dived off the television set and into the snow head first and started making snow angels.  Jameis Winston has the whole TNF crew making snow angels in celebration of a Browns victory.

He started both of Croatia’s Nations League fixtures over the recent international break but was substituted at half-time during his side’s 1-1 draw with Portugal on Monday. Advertisement Guardiola, who will remain City’s manager until the summer of 2027 after signing a two-year contract extension, confirmed that Kovacic is set for a spell on the sidelines. Before City’s game against Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday, Guardiola said: “Kovacic is injured. He will be (out for) a while. Three weeks, one month.” The Athletic exclusively reported on Tuesday that Guardiola had agreed fresh terms on a new deal to take him past 10 years service for the Premier League club, with his previous contract due to expire at the end of the current campaign. The Spaniard provided a positive update on the defensive trio of John Stones, Manuel Akanji, and Nathan Ake, who have all been sidelined with injuries. He said: “John (Stones) trained yesterday. Manu (Akanji) trained yesterday. Nathan (Ake) is coming back to training. We didn’t have central defenders but now we have three. Just Ruben (Dias) is out but hopefully, he is coming back soon.  “Some players have recovered a little bit.

A boost for all of us.” Analysis by Manchester City correspondent Sam Lee Given the overall theme of Pep Guardiola’s press conference was his new contract, it might be easy to overlook the significance of Kovacic’s injury but his absence really does leave City in a hole given their other absences. Fortunately, they appear to have several of their defenders back, but given they were already trying to find ways to cover for Rodri, losing the guy who has been the automatic replacement — and in reality the best option for the holding midfield role — is a real blow, especially with games against Tottenham and Liverpool coming up in the next week or so, and then Aston Villa and Manchester United, among others, within the period that the Croatian could miss. Advertisement Ilkay Gundogan has not been in his best form since returning in the summer and could now be required to fill in in midfield while John Stones could be another option but he has had an injury-disrupted season so far and it might be a big ask. It is likely that Guardiola will opt for a two-man holding midfield partnership, and if it is not Stones and Gundogan then it could well include Rico Lewis, who has been increasingly relied upon in midfield in recent weeks.

Van de Ven, 23, suffered the injury in the 10th minute of Tottenham’s 2-1 victory over City in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup on October 30. The 23-year-old was in tears as he walked down the tunnel and had to be consoled by team-mate Yves Bissouma. Advertisement He missed Tottenham’s next three matches in all competitions and was left out of Netherlands’ squad for their Nations League fixtures against Hungary and Bosnia. Speaking before Spurs’ defeat to Ipswich Town on November 10, head coach Ange Postecoglou said the centre-back would return after the international break but it appears he will be out for a little longer. “Micky’s still a good couple of weeks away,” he told Sky Sports. “He’s out on the grass training, but he’s still a couple of weeks away. We’re hoping by the middle of December he’ll be back and available to play.” Van de Ven previously missed two months of the 2023-24 campaign due to a hamstring injury. “We’ll get the advice from the medical team and the people working with him,” Postecoglou added. “I think there’s always a natural cautiousness with somebody who has a reoccurring problem but at the same time you don’t want to treat him with too many kid gloves around him because otherwise he’s still go to go out there and play at some point. “But it’s fair to say we’re taking all the appropriate steps and Micky will be a good judge of that as well and where he’s at.” Spurs will be hoping the defender recovers in time to feature in their Carabao Cup quarter-final tie against Manchester United on December 19. Postecoglou has also revealed that fellow central defender Romero will miss the trip to the Etihad Stadium on Saturday evening while young winger Mikey Moore “will still be out for a little bit of time” after picking up a virus before the international break. “Romero won’t be right for tomorrow’s game,” he said. “We are hoping he will be right for next week.” Analysis by Jay Harris This is a huge blow for Tottenham ahead of a busy few weeks which includes difficult fixtures against Manchester City, Roma, Bournemouth and Chelsea. Van de Ven instantly became a fan-favourite after he joined them from Wolfsburg in July 2023 for his crunching tackles and ability to powerfully drive forward with the ball out of defence. His exceptional recovery speed is also crucial to the success of Postecoglou’s high defensive line. Advertisement With both first-choice centre-backs unavailable against City, Ben Davies and Radu Dragusin will be expected to contain Erling Haaland. Davies is naturally a left-back but has played in the middle of defence on multiple occasions under Postecoglou.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How AJ Green is emerging as a defensive stalwart for the Bucks: 'This guy can defend',https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5932289/2024/11/22/aj-green-bucks-defense/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 13:15:52 GMT","Using techniques he's developed on offense, Green recently has been getting the Bucks' toughest defensive assignments — and succeeding.","NBA In the third quarter of Wednesday’s game against the Chicago Bulls, the Milwaukee Bucks had a problem. Bulls shooting guard Zach LaVine, who hit a flurry of tough shots to cap a strong performance to give himself 20 points in the first half, hit his first two shots of the third quarter as the Bulls started to claw their way back from a 12-point halftime deficit. Midway through the third, LaVine had made eight of his first 10 shots. The Bucks needed to find an answer on defense. Advertisement As Gary Trent Jr. entered the game, Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo briefly thought he had figured out how his squad would slow down LaVine. But Antetokounmpo quickly realized the answer was already on the floor: AJ Green. “There was a play, I think, in the third quarter, I saw (AJ) guarding Zach LaVine and (Gary) was in the game and I was like, ‘Switch,'” Antetokounmpo said after Wednesday’s game. “And then I thought about it and I was like, ‘No, stay.’ Because he’s been playing great.” Here’s the play immediately after Trent entered the game. “His defense is incredible,” Antetokounmpo said Wednesday. “He’s staying down on pump fakes. He’s using his body very smart. I think two years ago, he would get himself in foul trouble. He’d use his hands a lot, maybe jump a little bit on the pump fake, get the guy to shoot two easy free throws. But now, he’s just solid.” Since first becoming a serious title contender in the 2018-19 season, the Bucks have spent their offseasons looking to add 3-and-D players through the draft and free agency. While Green might not have been a much-hyped signing or a first-round pick, his play this season suggests the undrafted free agent may be the guy the Bucks have been looking for all along. “He moves his feet so well, he puts his body (in position) so well and he’s an underrated defender,” Antetokounmpo said. “In my opinion, he’s a really, really good defender and he shows in practice. He shows it in games, you guys are seeing that. Like he’s not a liability on defense, he’s actually one of our better defenders on the team. “So, I’m very, very happy that he’s out there with me. He makes our defense better and when we grab the rebound and go the other way, he’s a threat from everywhere.” Advertisement As Antetokounmpo noted at the end of his description of his teammate’s improved defensive capabilities, Green, who Bucks general manager Jon Horst originally signed to a two-way contract out of the University of Northern Iowa in the summer of 2022, found his way onto the floor because of his 3-point shooting. Being able to consistently knock down shots is what earned him the trust of Mike Budenholzer in his rookie season and Doc Rivers in the second half of his second NBA season. But putting in the work to get better on defense is what has led to consistent praise from Antetokounmpo, Damian Lillard and Rivers. On Monday against the Rockets, Antetokounmpo — who knows a thing or two about spectacular defensive plays — highlighted this second-quarter possession by Green as one of the best defensive possessions of the season:   Not only did Green successfully avoid three ball screens while keeping Reed Sheppard, the third pick in the 2024 NBA Draft, outside the 3-point line, he then switched onto Jalen Green, the Rockets’ leading scorer, and kept Green out of the paint before blocking his shot attempt at the end of the shot clock. “He just slid his feet. He stayed in front of the ball,” Rivers said of Green’s defense against the Rockets. “They kept trying him and we’re like, ‘You’re picking on the wrong guy. Like, this guy can defend.’ “But he’s young, they don’t know his name and they decided, well, let’s attack him and it went in our favor most of the time.” When Green stepped on the floor during his first two seasons, most scouting reports noted that he could shoot it and the Bucks were going to run various actions to try to get him open from 3. Rarely did those same scouting reports warn players about trying to score against Green on the other end. Advertisement As he has matured and attempted to solidify his spot as a rotation player, Green has found that one of the skills he has honed over the years as a knockdown shooter can also be useful on the defensive end. When Green goes through his pregame routine in Fiserv Forum, he sprints around the floor, pretending to whip around screens and flipping his hips to square his body to the basket to fire off 3-pointers from unusual angles. While it might not be the first connection people make, the same movements that allow Green to bend around a pindown screen shoulder-to-shoulder with one of his teammates also allow him to avoid a screen at the last second or stay connected to a ballhandler as opposing big men try to hit him with screens on defense. Watch Green stay connected to Rockets guard Jalen Green on this double drag screen in Monday’s game: The way Green sprints to catch up to the Rockets’ leading scorer after the first screen and avoid the second screen is the same way that Green would try to shake free from a defender running around a double screen on the offensive end. “On offense or defense, it’s all about movement and footwork,” Green told The Athletic. “And some of the ways you need to move can be very similar.” Rivers joked after Wednesday’s game that he hopes scouting reports don’t catch up and teams keep attacking Green for the rest of the season. Lillard has been around Green for a year and while he believes his teammate has made it clear he is a good defender, opponents might keep testing Green far longer than one would expect considering the current results. “He’s strong. He has good feet. He’s smart. He’s competitive,” Lillard said. “He’s tough and I think he understands who he’s guarding. You know, he’s a student. They put these sheets on our chairs in the locker room with information about everybody and you see him looking at it. He asks a lot of questions and stuff like that. Advertisement “So I think everybody might be surprised because he’s a 6-3 white guy, but I mean, if you look at him physically, he’s strong, he moves well. And like I said, he’s smart, he’s tough, and he’s actually a good defender, so I think that might catch people by surprise.” When told of Lillard’s appraisal, Green was not shy about his feelings on the topic. “I love it though,” Green said with a smile. “That’s fine with me. I try to take pride in playing defense and rising to that challenge and doing it for the team. The team needs it and so I look forward to it.” This is how Green has responded throughout the season when asked about getting targeted on defense. When the Bucks took on the Celtics in Milwaukee, Celtics stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, who are among the league’s preeminent mismatch hunters, spent much of the afternoon attacking Green. Asked about getting targeted by the Celtics in the Bucks’ 113-107 loss, Green told reporters he enjoys the challenge. “Absolutely, (it’s fun),” Green said with a smile, when asked about isolation defense possessions against Tatum, Brown, and Jrue Holiday. “I think every game, you have to have that mindset of you want the matchups and you want to prove that you get stops guarding those guys. So, yeah, it’s fun to compete and see what you got.” Often, when Green speaks about what occurs in a game, he talks about competition. After a stretch of games in which the Bucks were getting beat to loose balls to start the season, Green made it a priority to dive on the floor to secure extra possessions. “It’s really just trying to compete and make it hard,” Green said. “Guys are good and you’re never going to stop somebody completely. Each night, it’s going to be a different guy, so just trying to be consistent in how I compete and how I try to make it difficult defensively.” Advertisement Despite his strides, Green is not a perfect defender. He makes mistakes and he was a major part of the botched switches that left Alperen Şengün wide open underneath the basket on the final play of Monday’s game, but Green did not run from that mistake. He owned it and talked about trying to get better. “It’s a lot of just learning and being aware and learning and then applying and figuring out what you need to get better at and then how to get better at that,” Green said on Monday. “So, a lot of watching film, thinking about it, talking about it with our coaches and the strength stuff. How do I get better at this thing? Is it a positional thing? Is it a physical quality? “So just a the cycle of learning, how do I get better at it, work on it, learning, just a never-ending cycle.” If that cycle continues to yield positive results, Green should continue to earn a larger part in Rivers’ rotation and could end up being a true two-way weapon for the Bucks. For now, Green making an impact defensively has been a pleasant surprise for a team struggling to find its footing at the start of the season.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Inside Poona Ford's resurgent season for Chargers defense: 'He’s really hungry',https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938996/2024/11/22/poona-ford-chargers-defense-bills/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 13:01:42 GMT",Ford signed a veteran minimum contract with the Chargers after barely playing for the Bills last season. He's been a revelation.,"NFL EL SEGUNDO, Calif. — Poona Ford knew all he needed was a chance. What he did not know is where it would come from — or if it would arrive at all. Ford had just endured what he described as a “real frustrating” 2023 season with the Buffalo Bills. After five quality years with the Seattle Seahawks, Ford signed a one-year deal with Buffalo in free agency. He ended up out of the defensive line rotation. Advertisement Ford was a healthy scratch for three straight games starting in Week 3. By Week 6, he was back on the field because of injuries. But in early November, the Bills signed Linval Joseph off the street, and Ford was back to the bench. He was inactive for six straight games after the Joseph signing. In total, Ford was a healthy scratch for nine of the Bills’ 17 games. “After a while, I was just like, f— it,” Ford said. “It is what it is at this point.” Ford looked ahead into an uncertain future. In March, the opportunity arrived. The Los Angeles Chargers called. They were led by a new regime of coach Jim Harbaugh and general manager Joe Hortiz. This was not just a shot to make a roster. This was a shot to start. This was a shot to get the reps he needed to reestablish himself on the NFL stage. “Having somebody that believes in your abilities,” Ford said, “it makes you want to give them everything you got.” GO DEEPER 'Starting to believe': Jim Harbaugh makes Chargering a thing of the past in win over Bengals In 10 games so far this season, Ford has repaid Harbaugh and Hortiz by being one of the most impactful free agent signings in the league. Ford signed for a veteran minimum base salary. He has vastly outperformed his contract. Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter has led a dramatic turnaround with his unit. The Chargers have the best scoring defense in football. Ford’s performance, both as a run defender and pass rusher, has been instrumental in the Chargers’ defensive resurgence. “I took it and ran with it,” Ford said. Ford has been a stout and disruptive presence on the interior since the very first game of the season, a 22-10 win over the Las Vegas Raiders. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. That game was locked in a scoreless tie late in the first quarter when the Raiders faced a fourth-and-1 from their 41-yard line. Las Vegas opted to test the middle of the Chargers’ defensive line. That proved to be a mistake, thanks to Ford. As quarterback Gardner Minshew II took the shotgun snap and handed to running back Zamir White, Ford quickly shifted to his right. He then extended into the chest of center Andre James and occupied the “A” gap between James and left guard Cody Whitehair.    Ford then powered forward to take the lead blocker, tight end Michael Mayer. And Ford was strong enough to maintain his leverage on James.  He gave up no ground to Mayer.  And Ford smothered White for a 1-yard loss.  Turnover on downs. The Chargers took over in Las Vegas territory. Four plays later, they kicked a field goal for their first points of the Harbaugh era. “There’s a level of consistency and physicality,” defensive line coach Mike Elston said of Ford. “He raises everybody’s game around him.” Ford’s run defending continued to be a spark for the Chargers defense. This was a second-down run stuff on the Pittsburgh Steelers’ Najee Harris in the first quarter in Week 3. Ford bench-pressed right tackle Broderick Jones in a one-on-one matchup, shed the block and then stone-walled a Harris cutback after a 1-yard gain.        Ford’s presence in the run front has allowed Minter to devote more resources to the back end. The Chargers play with more light boxes than any defense in the league. They have aligned with six or fewer defenders in the box on more than 80 percent of their plays, according to TruMedia. Despite this, the Chargers have been a good run defense. Through 11 weeks, they ranked fourth in defensive EPA per play against designed rushes, according to TruMedia. Advertisement “He’s been really the anchor for us in the middle of the defense,” Minter said. “He’s allowed us to do different things in our coverage because of our ability to stop the run at times with less people. He’s certainly a big, big piece of that.” Here is an example from late in the third quarter of the Chargers’ Week 6 win at the Denver Broncos. The Broncos came out in 11 personnel, a three-receiver package. The Chargers matched with five defensive backs in their big nickel package. That left the Chargers with six defenders in the box.  Ford aligned over left guard Ben Powers. As quarterback Bo Nix took the snap and handed off to running Jaleel McLaughlin, Powers tried to drive Ford laterally.   Ford was patient, waiting for his opportunity. Then he attacked and once again got extension.  As McLaughlin tried to hit the hole, Ford used that extension to shed Powers.  And he got the solo tackle for no gain.  Ford was already outperforming his contract early in the year with his play in run defense. What has turned this into a truly profound season — and one that should put him firmly in the Pro Bowl conversation — is how he has impacted the game as a pass rusher in recent weeks. Ford has a sack in three of the past four games. He has tied his career high in sacks on the season. The counting stats have come during this four-game winning streak. But Ford was showing signs of his pass-rush capability earlier in the season. Late in the first half of the Broncos game, Ford took likely points off the board by drawing a hold. The penalty wiped out a 46-yard completion from Nix to receiver Courtland Sutton that would have moved Denver into field goal range. Ford beat right guard Quinn Meinerz on the play.      The following week at the Arizona Cardinals, Ford saved a touchdown on a coverage breakdown in the Chargers’ secondary. Cardinals receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. was wide open after winning on a double move.      Quarterback Kyler Murray, though, was knocked off his spot by a bull-rush pressure from Ford. And Murray could not get his eyes downfield in time to find Harrison.   The sacks were going to come. That was evident because of how Ford was rushing on a snap-to-snap basis. He has won convincingly and in varied ways on his sacks. He has won with agility. He was won with speed. And he has won with power. “For a guy that’s built like a nose tackle, he’s really twitchy,” Minter said. “He’s fast, quick off the ball, uses his hands really well.” No sack was more impressive than this spin move against the New Orleans Saints in Week 8.     “He’s really hungry to kind of prove himself as the caliber of player that he kind of knows he is and we think he is,” Minter said. “He’s doing that so far.” Ford agreed that he arrived in L.A. with a certain edge, because of “how they tried to do me” in Buffalo. However, when asked what kind of statement he thinks he’s made this year, Ford looked up from his seat at his locker with a puzzled expression. Advertisement “Statement?” he replied. “It’s not a statement to me, to be honest.” Why not? “Because I’m not surprised,” Ford said. “I’ve been doing this s—. That’s about it.” He just needed the chance to play. The Chargers saw the upside. They are reaping the benefits. “He’s the kind of player that does,” Harbaugh said. “It’s all what he’s doing, whether that’s in the meeting environment, the training environment, the practice environment, game environment. He’s all about his business and doing his job at a really high level.” (Top photo: Michael Owens / Getty Images; screenshots via NFL+) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Can Joe Philbin unlock potential in Raiders' offensive line? 'We're not reinventing the wheel',https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938966/2024/11/22/joe-philbin-raiders-offensive-line/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 13:01:09 GMT","""I still love teaching,"" said Philbin, the Raiders interim offensive line coach and former Miami Dolphins head coach.","NFL HENDERSON, Nev. — One can list many things that must happen for the Las Vegas Raiders to snap a six-game losing streak Sunday against the Denver Broncos, or even just win a game or two the rest of the season. But there is no question what is at the top of the list. The offensive line has to play better, and the 2-8 Raiders have enlisted the help of former Miami Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin, 63, to help shepherd that. Philbin started coaching offensive linemen 38 years ago at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute and cracked the NFL 17 years later. Advertisement “I still love teaching,” Philbin said Tuesday. “I still love going to practice and then watching the players perform at a high level on Sundays. And I love the guys I am working with.” Philbin, who came on board this year as a senior offensive assistant, took over as offensive line coach two weeks ago when James Cregg was fired — along with offensive coordinator Luke Getsy and quarterbacks coach Rich Scangerello — because the Raiders were dead last in the league in rushing. (They are also 27th with 33 sacks allowed, though some of those are on quarterback Gardner Minshew II.) Philbin said he made “minimal tweaks” at practice last week. The Raiders set a season high with 22 first downs and the timing was better in the passing game in the 34-19 loss in Miami, but they had only 60 yards rushing. “We’re not reinventing the wheel,” rookie center Jackson Powers-Johnson said. GO DEEPER How did the Raiders roster get so bad? A series of unfortunate events “The fundamentals of the game haven’t changed, and the offensive lineman’s job is to create space for the running back,” Philbin said. “How do you that? You have to hit your aiming point, you have to play with leverage and then you have to sustain blocks. “In pass protection, I use the analogy of man-to-man defense in basketball. The quarterback is the hoop, and the further away you keep your guy from the hoop, their shooting percentage is less and less. This game is simple, but not easy.” The Miami game was the first start for the group of left tackle Kolton Miller, left guard Jordan Meredith, center Powers-Johnson, right guard Dylan Parham and right tackle DJ Glaze, and the hope is they start a streak together. “You just hate that we keep changing all these pieces because at some point, you’d like just to have five guys there, continuity, chemistry,” coach Antonio Pierce said. “That’s really the glue to our team, when you can have that … you won’t have these mistakes and mental errors that we had early in the season.”  Miller and Parham are the only two still standing from the season-opening lineup, as Powers-Jackson, the team’s second-round pick, made his first start at right guard in Week 4 (for Cody Whitehair) before replacing the injured Andre James at center two games ago. Meredith filled in for an injured Parham for three games before taking over at right guard last week. Glaze stepped in for an injured Thayer Munford Jr. in Week 4 before beating him out. Advertisement “We’ve got a great group of guys to work with,” Philbin said. “Great pros that have given great effort. Things don’t happen overnight, but we’re taking incremental steps. We have a long way to go, and I have to do a better job of giving us a better design in the running game. Pierce and new interim offensive coordinator Scott Turner talked about how the communication has to improve up front, and Philbin thinks it has in Powers-Jackson’s two starts making the calls at center.

He has an exuberance for the game, which is good. … When in doubt, you can overcommunicate to make sure that the five offensive linemen, tight end and running back are all on the same page pre-snap.” Though there is an urgency to win a game, there is no rushing the process of this group getting better during the practice week. “Joe has been great for us, fundamental-wise,” Parham said. “And we’re taking our time, nothing is being rushed. We may spend more time on our footwork than the scheme some days. And we need to be a little more intentional with our communication, whether it’s in the film room or on the field. “We’re saying assignments out loud in the meeting rooms now, so everyone knows what the other guy is doing.” Parham was a third-round pick, as was Glaze this year, and Miller was a first-rounder and Powers-Johnson a second-rounder. There’s some pedigree there. Miller established himself as one of the better left tackles in the league but had a rough start this year after missing all of training camp recovering from offseason shoulder surgery. GO DEEPER Can the Raiders get the QB they need in the 2025 NFL Draft? If not, where should they turn? “He has rare knee-bend for a man of his size,” Philbin said. “And his movement skill is excellent. He missed a lot of practice, so these next seven games, all those reps he has not gotten will pay dividends. He is what you’re looking for in a left tackle in this league.” Unlike his cohorts, Meredith was undrafted (out of Western Kentucky in 2021) and has scratched and clawed his way up the depth chart. He was waived after an initial training camp with the Los Angeles Rams, was signed and waived three times by the Raiders, then spent two weeks on the Cleveland Browns practice squad in November 2022 before returning to the Raiders. Advertisement “Jordan Meredith … we haven’t talked enough about him, but Jordan’s done a hell of a job filling in, and the way he’s been playing, he’s earned the right to be a starter going forward,” Pierce said. Meredith said Philbin’s approach is the key to the coach’s history of success and why there is hope for this group. “Slow is smooth and smooth is fast,” Meredith said. “That’s kind of the way he teaches. The speed picks up as the week goes on, and by game time, you are in peak shape.” The Raiders hope they are in better shape than they were a week ago and then will just go from there. “It’s easy for me, with the remote, to hit rewind 20 times and draw a yellow line or circle on the video screen with my finger,” Philbin said. “But they don’t have that luxury. … With the play speed, the different looks and the different blitzes, there’s a lot going on and it happens very fast.” (Photo: Jeff Moreland / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Should the Giants trade Mike Yastrzemski? The pros and cons,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938233/2024/11/22/sf-giants-mike-yastrzemski-trade-options/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 13:00:04 GMT",Yastrzemski is one of the Giants’ most valuable players. Can they really get better by trading him?,"MLB In the previous two installments of this three-part series — the first on LaMonte Wade Jr., and the second on Camilo Doval — it took a lot of highfalutin words to reach an expected conclusion. Yes, the San Francisco Giants would trade (player) if the deal made their team better. They would trade (player) if another team overpaid with their offer of prospects, but they would keep him if they weren’t getting good offers. They’d probably trade Logan Webb for Jackson Merrill, Michael King, Ethan Salas and $10 million in international bonus money, too. Advertisement This one will be a little different. Mike Yastrzemski is a lot of things, and an important one to remember is that he’s a helpful baseball player. There isn’t a roster in baseball that wouldn’t improve with him on it, and if you’re rolling your eyes, boy, are you underestimating just how many outfield positions there are to fill in baseball. There are 90 starting spots, and if you add in a couple reserves for each team, that’s 150 outfielders that have to be sourced every year. Here’s where Yastrzemski ranked in WAR among all outfielders (min. 20 games) since his rookie season: 2019 — 31 out of 198
2020 — 2 out of 137
2021 — 41 out of 206
2022 — 41 out of 195
2023 — 42 out of 195
2024 — 47 out of 181 Other than the outlier season, Yastrzemski has been remarkably consistent. The best way to describe him goes something like this: If he’s your best outfielder, that’s not great. If he’s your second-best outfielder, it’s probably an average outfield. If he’s your third-best outfielder, that’s probably a pretty sweet outfield you got going there. And if he’s a fourth or even fifth outfielder, that means you’re presiding over an embarrassment of riches. It’s not hyperbolic to suggest that there was a decade-long stretch where the Cleveland Guardians might have won at least one championship with a couple extra Yastrzemski-level outfielders. Yastrzemski is a player who helps teams win baseball games, yes, but he’s other things too. He’s ill-suited to be a primary offensive contributor, either in the leadoff spot or in the middle of an order. He’s an excellent corner outfielder, but he’s a less dynamic center fielder. And, unfortunately, he might be a luxury for a team on a silly, self-imposed path to austerity. Trading him is less about the players coming back in a trade and more about the roster and payroll space that opens up. Advertisement So let’s see why the Giants would even think about trading away a player who could help them. There’s no sense in spending two minutes on a GIF, only to use it once. Especially when it might be the GIF of the offseason.  Yastrzemski will likely make close to $9.5 million next season. That’s slightly underpaid compared to the $/WAR metric on FanGraphs, a stat that every organization has their own version of. But if the Giants are setting a soft, internal salary cap that’s below the fake salary cap, that’s a lot of money for a good player on a roster that needs more very good players. Let’s say that Yastrzemski’s salary on another team gives the Giants a chance to sign, I don’t know, Teoscar Hernández. He’s an outfielder who would offer more dingers and less defense than Yastrzemski, which might be a worthwhile swap for a team that needs more dingers and has the highest ground-ball rate in the league. You might be saying, “Hey, couldn’t the Giants afford both of them? They seem like very complementary players.” However, you already know the answer to that is “No. And please try the new 16 oz. Colby Cheese Stout, just $18 ($24 for commemorative souvenir cup).” Yastrzemski’s contributions are harder to appreciate on a roster where he’s hitting fifth or leading off, as he won’t have the runners on base or the hitters to drive him in, respectively. He’s a little-things-right player on a big-things-wrong roster, and while that doesn’t mean he isn’t helping the Giants win more games than they would without him, the team should always be hunting for outfielders who are even better. If freeing up his reasonable salary is how that gets done, they’ll have to consider it. However, another consideration is that of opportunity cost. Baseball teams are allowed to use only three outfielders at a time, despite my constant letters to the commissioner’s office, and the Giants already have two in place for next season. Heliot Ramos deserves the chance to build on his All-Star season, and he’s young enough to hope his ceiling is even higher. Jung Hoo Lee is still something of an unknown, but the previous regime gave him a good chunk of money, and the new regime would be silly not to leave him alone in the leadoff spot until they figure out what they have. Advertisement Behind them, the Giants have Luis Matos and Wade Meckler, a pair of outfielders with similar, confusing skill sets. Neither one of them should be handed a starting job, but both of them are about as likely to turn into an everyday player as Ramos was to turn into an All-Star. As in, not especially likely, but likely enough to keep a close eye on them. Grant McCray hit for just enough power to make him interesting. And there also might be outfield innings for Tyler Fitzgerald, depending on what else happens this offseason. Don’t forget that the plan for Marco Luciano might be a move to the outfield, which is an idea that’s just wacky enough to work. Not a single one of these other options is likelier to be as valuable as Yastrzemski in 2025, but if they trust the younger outfielders enough, they can feel more comfortable moving Yastrzemski if it helps them improve a different position. And, of course, the more obvious consideration is still there. If another team wants to help the Giants fill a roster hole or improve their farm system in a Yastrzemski trade, that might be reason enough. The problem with the 2024 Giants is that they didn’t win enough baseball games. They should be looking to add wins in 2025, not subtract them. By getting rid of Yastrzemski, they’ll be getting rid of their fourth-most (according to Baseball-Reference) or fifth-most (according to FanGraphs) valuable position player, which would be a funny way of adding wins. He’s not the problem. He’s a part of the solution, which is to get superstar players and surround them with helpful players. The Giants don’t need to sell their watch to buy a hairbrush, and they don’t need to sell their hair to buy a watch chain. You can’t really expect the Giants to replace Yastrzemski‘s production from Meckler, Matos, McCray or M. Luciano without more evidence. That’s something to hope for, not plan around. And it’s going to be much harder to replace Yastrzemski’s value without — wait for it — spending even more money. There’s a switch-hitting outfielder without platoon splits on the market, and he hit 44 home runs despite playing at a park that’s just as tough on right-handed hitters as Oracle Park. He just turned 30 in October. Seems like a match, right? He’ll make about twice as much as Yastrzemski for five years, when he’s roughly the age that Yastrzemski is now. This is Anthony Santander, and all the Giants would have to do is convince him to take their money. Except if the Giants are trading Yastrzemski, it’ll be to free up money for one of their other priorities, either in the rotation or at shortstop. They’d need to take from the outfield to improve the roster elsewhere and hope they come out ahead on the balance sheet. They might just prefer to keep the helpful player and add other helpful players, freeing up salary another way, or simply going over their intended budget a little bit. That’s not just a free book idea for Michael Lewis (call me to hammer out the details), but a way to help the Giants win more games than they did last year. In a lot of ways, Yastrzemski is a canary in the coal mine. Keeping him and adding players around him is what a normal team would do. It’s what a team that’s trying to compete would do. This is less about the Giants getting an offer they can’t refuse and more about how they view their place in the baseball ecosystem in 2025 and beyond. My guess is that he sticks around. If he’s traded, it will be for entirely avoidable and unpalatable reasons. (Photo: Gary A. Vasquez / USA Today) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How Michele Kang became one of the biggest investors in women's soccer,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940050/2024/11/22/michele-kang-womens-soccer-investment/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 12:47:26 GMT","Kang sees this moment in women's sports as a ""tipping point"" for investment, something that can't be stopped","NWSL In a Parisian café, amid the excitement of the Summer Olympics, businesswoman Michele Kang sat down for breakfast with U.S. Soccer CEO J.T. Batson. The two were scheduled to meet for an hour between the U.S. women’s national team’s semifinal win and its eventual gold medal victory over Brazil. While they had met before, they had never spoken at length. Advertisement Three hours later, the two were still there, not just talking, but in the weeds on big, foundational ideas around the women’s program. When they finally parted ways, they left with the seed of an idea that would eventually turn into the second-largest donation U.S. Soccer has received. On Tuesday, U.S. Soccer announced Kang — majority owner of the Washington Spirit, Olympique Lyonnais Féminin and London City Lionesses under her global multi-club organization Kynisca — was donating $30million (£24m). The funds are earmarked over the next five years for women’s youth national team camps, talent identification and scouting, and female coach and referee education and mentorship. GO DEEPER Spirit owner Kang pledges $30million into women's soccer programs “I had a lot of coffee,” Kang deadpanned when asked about that Paris breakfast during an interview following Tuesday’s press conference in New York City. “Michele started asking really good, insightful questions on things and ultimately got to some core issues,” Batson told The Athletic. Kang wanted to know how U.S. Soccer was thinking at a federation-wide level and Batson walked her through the long-term vision, even if that vision didn’t have secured funding and resources attached yet. These questions had been on Kang’s mind for years since she gained majority ownership of the Spirit in 2022. She knew the NWSL would need more coaches and more referees with expansion and more games. She could see the lack of technical staff at the youth levels around D.C., too. “While the professional league and professional teams’ trajectory and investments are great, it could be really temporary if we don’t have all these underlying foundational blocks,” she said. It wasn’t just the investment that needed to happen, it was attention — but that wasn’t on her alone or the NWSL. When the breakfast meeting in Paris happened, Kang had finally found an avenue for those ambitions. Advertisement “We geeked out for a few hours on what the mission-critical, core-enabling functions that we’re going to need for soccer in this country, and women’s soccer in particular, to be the best in the world,” Batson continued. “And everything led from there.” While Tuesday’s announcement earned its fair share of attention, the eye-popping investment is to be used in areas of U.S. Soccer that don’t get a lot of shine and certainly won’t get a lot of headlines over the next five years as the work is carried out. That was a motivation for Kang in many ways — this isn’t for splashy projects, such as the national training center. “It is equally — potentially more — critical that we have all the systems in place. Because if you don’t have the coaches, if you don’t have the referees, it just doesn’t work,” she said. “That’s why I felt it was important that not only I personally believe in it, but I wanted to bring attention to these issues, hoping that more people will join in and invest in it.” Kang is not one to accept things as final. “I hate following any convention if they say, ‘You’re not supposed to do it.’ I always asked why it wasn’t acceptable. So unless I understood the rationale, I wouldn’t do it,” she told The Athletic in an interview conducted in May 2022, shortly after she became the majority owner of the Washington Spirit. “So in that society where young people, especially kids, are supposed to follow the rules, I was a problem child.” Growing up as the youngest of three girls in South Korea, Kang was more curious than rebellious, always asking why. Her mother was called to her school multiple times, not because Kang was causing trouble — she was a top student — but because she would question teachers, rules and expectations. Kang’s parents had been waiting for a boy who could carry the family name. She arrived instead. She has credited her father for instilling a sense of equality and possibility in her from the beginning. He was a professor, one of the first Koreans after the Second World War who earned a U.S. government scholarship to study in America, which also meant he didn’t serve in the Korean War. Advertisement Kang was a self-described tomboy growing up. She played sports, a lot of them. Basketball was her favorite. In elementary school, she was the second tallest kid in her class. “I was going to be a basketball player, but I found out there was somebody the same age as me who played basketball in another school. She was already 6ft 2in and I said, ‘Well, I’m never going to be number one, forget it,’” Kang recalled. She played soccer and volleyball, but tennis became her primary sport before the need to study won out. Kang planned to earn her college degree at home. While her father had studied abroad in America, her parents wanted her to graduate from a Korean college to help preserve her cultural identity. She started at a co-ed college of economics, but she was the only woman enrolled. Things in South Korea were also tumultuous at the time. President Park Chung-hee was assassinated in 1979, followed by a coup led by General Chun Doo-hwan. Chun arrested his political opponents and limited political opposition. Martial law was put in place and student-led protests were violently suppressed. “The country was in turmoil. Campuses were shut down because typically, students were at the forefront of the demonstrations,” she said. Her parents were worried that if Kang was involved in those demonstrations, or arrested, it would be the end of her life as she knew it. So she devised a plan. Her parents would eventually be responsible for a dowry if she married. Instead, she told them, “When I get married, you don’t need to spend a dime. Just give me a fraction of that money so that I can pay my tuition, just one year, as a college student.” While she believed her parents would have usually said no — they had to borrow money to pay for that year of tuition — the worry over her future amid the demonstrations and dangerous political unrest got her a yes. Advertisement “I guess you could say that was my first business deal,” she said with a smile. When she got to the University of Chicago in 1981, she thrived. She turned one year into two, working in the summer as a waitress and adding a second job at the library once the semester rolled around. “There was a sitcom, ‘Cheers,’” she said. “The song, ‘You want to go where everybody knows your name’ — I wanted to go where no one knew my name because of where I grew up. With my father as a professor, I was always so and so’s daughter, so and so’s granddaughter. I absolutely hated it. I really wanted to go somewhere where no one knew who I was. If I fail, I fail, but at least it’s going to be on me as opposed to getting any special treatment.” She loved the school, loved the feel of the campus and the quad that reminded her of Oxford University. She would walk back and forth, believing she’d get smarter by absorbing the energy of the place. She went to graduate school at Yale School of Management. Coming out of her MBA, Kang said she had three 10-year plans. In the first 10, she wanted to go into consulting because the project-based nature of the work appealed to her. One day it would be supply chains, the next branding, the day after that telecommunications or manufacturing. She wanted to learn how every element of a business works. The next 10 years, even though she hated the concept, she would go to a Fortune 500 company to learn the organizational part of being in the business world and to acquire leadership skills. “At the end of the day, business is not about how smart you are, how many functional capabilities or the expertise you have, it’s about organization,” Kang said. “How do you get people below you, sideways from you, above you, how do you get them to do what you need them to do? How can you get them to work with you to accomplish common goals?” And in the third decade, she was going to become a Fortune 500 CEO. Advertisement “That’s also why I left Korea, right?” Kang said. “I could have gotten my business career going, but I wanted to try in a bigger pond.” In the end, instead of becoming a CEO, she started her own company, Cognoscente — a healthcare technology company — in 2008. She effectively did what she set out to do, even if she didn’t nail her own timeline. Kang had a plan for the fourth decade, too: giving back and public service. And in 2019, she found women’s soccer. After the U.S. won the 2019 Women’s World Cup, while also fighting for equal pay, there was a reception for the team on Capitol Hill. Tom Daschle, the former Democratic senator from South Dakota, who also served on the Cognoscente board, invited Kang. Daschle would eventually join the Spirit investor group a couple of years later, under the team’s previous ownership. “To tell you the truth, I didn’t know there was a professional league in this country,” Kang told The Athletic in 2022. “In part because my life had been all about work. I didn’t have time to do anything else.” She met Steve Baldwin, then the majority owner of the Spirit, at the reception, along with players and fellow potential investors. By December 2020, she joined as a minority investor with a 35 percent stake in the team. The soccer part was nice, but what appealed to her most was having a hands-on impact on women’s empowerment, especially around pay and equity issues. Four things had helped her through her journey, she said: “Dignity of work, dignity of self, independence and being able to get the same opportunity.” With women’s soccer, she could provide opportunities. But the path to becoming the first woman of color to own a majority stake in the NWSL was not straightforward. In 2021, negotiations for her to gain a controlling stake of the Spirit turned sour between her, Baldwin, and the other primary investor, Bill Lynch. When she made a $35million offer to buy the Spirit in December of that year, it was unheard of for the league. The expansion fee for the Kansas City Current had been a mere $5million; the sale of the majority stake of the Seattle Reign to Lyon in 2019 had been completed at a valuation of $3.51million. Advertisement Those numbers seem quaint now, but the astronomical rise in NWSL team valuations wouldn’t have happened in the same way without that first $35million offer from Kang. Over the past couple of years, her international ambitions came to fruition via a global multi-club organization. It started with a majority stake in Lyon’s women’s team, one of the best European club teams with regular Champions League appearances. Then she snapped up one of the few independent clubs in the top two flights of the English soccer pyramid, the London City Lionesses. The formal announcement of the multi-club organization came this summer, with Kynisca announcing its name and an “innovation hub” focused on the health and performance of women athletes, billed to be the largest of its kind. Kang, via Kynisca, also led a $2million investment in Ida Sports, which designs cleats and shoes for female players, and invested in media company Just Women’s Sports. She also joined the investor group that bought the Baltimore Orioles earlier this year at a $1.725billion valuation. Kang has also branched into other women’s sports with another deal that happened at the Paris Olympics, donating $4million over the next four years to USA Rugby to support the women’s sevens team leading into the 2028 Olympics. USA Rugby called her donation “transformative.” That deal came together even faster than the one with U.S. Soccer. Kang walked into the sold-out Stade de France, surprised by the atmosphere. She ended up next to the chair of USA Rugby and they struck up a conversation. “It was literally the most expensive game I’ve ever been to,” Kang joked Tuesday. “I really did not expect to do that. But I just felt that (the team is) so talented that they should not be deprived of investment and just like what I’ve been trying to do in my own small way, bring attention and hope people begin to see it, and more people will join.”     A post shared by Washington Spirit (@washingtonspirit)  That’s the way Kang usually talks about her larger projects: as some small way of changing the game. But for all the praise she gets, there are still skeptics of her motives and her methods — especially the multi-club model. She’s addressed at least one of those critiques head-on. “I am fully aware of the negative connotation of multi-club (ownership), especially on the men’s side,” Kang said following her purchase of London City. “I will submit to you that on the women’s side, multi-club is a necessity, not luxury or greed. Because we need to invest to professionalize women’s football to the level that they deserve and the potential that women’s football has. We need to invest. Because of the lack of media dollars, there isn’t that much money to invest.” Advertisement After Tuesday’s $30million announcement, it’s harder for critics to accuse Kang of acting in bad faith. Still, she has the edge of ruthlessness regarding business; she wants to make money at this. It’s never been a charity. Instead, she saw an opening and was among the first to leap. She also knows there are risks. Kang doesn’t believe in guaranteed outcomes, just opportunities. “This is a tipping point. Once it happens, it’s on its own trajectory. You can’t stop it,” she said Tuesday. “But we have to make sure we’re investing in the right things at the right time. Otherwise, this could fall apart.” One of those investments is doing just fine. After going to New York City to announce her U.S. Soccer donation, Kang headed to Kansas City to watch her first team, the Spirit, vie for the NWSL championship against the top-seeded Orlando Pride on Saturday night. She’s feeling the nerves, especially after two late winning goals in the playoffs at a sold-out Audi Field. “I kept telling the players after the quarterfinal and the semifinal that at this rate, I don’t think I’m going to live out my natural life span,” Kang said laughing. “I only have one heart.” Pablo Maurer contributed to this report.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Magic's Franz Wagner adds to NBA All-Star case with game-winning 3 over Lakers,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5939985/2024/11/22/franz-wagner-orlando-magic-game-winner/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 12:38:15 GMT",Wagner piled up 37 points and 11 assists along with the dagger in L.A. And it didn't come as a surprise to his teammates or coaches.,"NBA LOS ANGELES — The shot is what fans will remember; Franz Wagner called it the biggest of his young NBA career. For the Orlando Magic, however, the real story is everything that led up to the shot. On Thursday, the Magic’s star forward finished off one of the best games by an Orlando player in recent memory — and possibly wrote his own All-Star origin story — with a game-winning 3-pointer over Cam Reddish with 3.1 seconds left, sending the Magic to a 119-118 win over a Lakers team that had won six straight. FRANZ CALLS GAME@franzboogie https://t.co/KIkC3lwYLt pic.twitter.com/0yat4TOPa1 — Orlando Magic (@OrlandoMagic) November 22, 2024  The shot gave him 37 points on a night when he also had 11 assists, capping the first 35-point, 10-assist outing by a Magic player in more than 20 years. This wasn’t just something that popped out of the blue, though. Talk to the Magic about Wagner’s practice habits, work ethic and approach to the game, and it becomes clear that nobody was surprised by his performance … or that he could carry the team to seven wins in its last eight games during star forward Paolo Banchero’s absence with a torn oblique muscle. Advertisement “He’s been doing this for a while,” Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said. “He’s continued to step into that role where he has to dominate and be the focal point.” It’s not like he hasn’t had big moments before, either. Wagner was a key player on the Germany team that won the 2023 World Cup, hanging 22 on the U.S. in a semifinal win and 19 in the gold medal game against Serbia. But on an NBA stage, this was his breakout moment. So when Anthony Davis left the door open for the Magic by missing two free throws with 18 seconds left, Wagner grabbed the ball from Goga Bitadze, and the other Orlando players got out of the way and watched him operate, trusting the work he’d done to prepare for this. “People talk about good (shot), bad (shot), lucky, unlucky,” Mosley said. “He works on that. That’s the thing, he works on those big shots, 3 … 2 … 1 … take the shot.” Wagner wanted to get a more favorable matchup than having Davis’ monstrous presence on him, so he engineered a switch to get Reddish instead — still a big, long defender. He was originally hoping to probe a pathway to the basket to take advantage of the long-striding finishing skills that have made him a star, but when he didn’t see a clear opening he went for Plan B and got to his stepback going left for the game-winner.   “We were down two, I got lucky with them missing a couple of free throws at the end, and we didn’t have any timeouts,” Wagner said. “At first I had [Anthony Davis] on me, and found a way to push that matchup a little bit. They were set up pretty well, so I didn’t really see any driving lane. “I was thinking best shot (and not just shoot the 3). I would have taken it to the basket too, but I didn’t see any driving lanes, and I was a little taller than Reddish so I tried to shoot over him.” Advertisement But again, don’t focus just on this play and this shot. Instead, look at everything that led up to it, from the work he did in the summer on this 3-point shot, to the first half he spent patiently attacking LA’s defense with skip passes to the weak side, to the end-game situations he rehearsed in practice. And watch him after the shot went in, too: He fist-bumped his chest but then marched to the bench, cold as ice, and pointed a single finger to everyone for one more stop. It was only after Davis’s last shot went awry that he pumped a fist, chest-bumped Jalen Suggs and Jett Howard, and was quickly mobbed by the rest of the bench. The fourth-year forward known as “Boogie” in the locker room has averaged 27.5 points, 6.3 assists and 6.0 rebounds during his last 10 games, all of which came without Banchero. The 37 points were a season high and the 11 assists a career high, but he’s threatened those totals multiple times in the past two weeks — this wasn’t some wild outlier. The story, then, isn’t that this one shot happened to catch net. It’s that the 6-foot-10 forward’s ball skills evolved to the point that he basically operates as the team’s point guard, and that his scoring is so potent that everyone in the building knew he was getting the ball on the final two possessions (he also drove for a layup with 20 seconds left) and he still scored. Nobody understands that more than his older brother, housemate, carpool partner and Magic teammate, Mo Wagner. “He did all right,” the elder Wagner said. “If he’s not making that shot, I’m kicking his a–.” He then added more seriously, “It’s very cool to have a superstar in your family. It’s awesome, the way he works, how determined he is, how diligent he is, how obsessed he is, it’s incredible. The fact I can be able to see it is awesome too.” Advertisement And it was perhaps fitting that he won the game on an off-the-dribble 3-pointer, the one skill that gave him the most trouble during 2023-24 when he slumped to 28.1 percent from distance. That percentage includes a game-tying, last-second attempt in this same building a year ago that was blocked by LeBron James. “A lot of stuff is mental too for us players,” Franz Wagner said. “For me to get over the hump a little bit over the summer and carry that into the season means a lot. “I’ve come a long way since I came into the league, (but) last year was at times a struggle for me. Progress is never just linear; you just gotta stay level-headed.” After the sweet payback of Thursday’s shot, he’s back up to 34.4 percent in 2024-25. And that has come despite Banchero’s absence often leaving him with a more challenging shot mix off the dribble like the one that beat the Lakers. “I do work on my off-the-dribble 3 a lot, and you work on it for those moments,” he said. “I just stepped into it with confidence.” And after that shot, and Jonathan Isaac’s defense to foil a desperation shot by Davis at the buzzer, the Magic team jumped out on the court to celebrate what may end up a defining win for this emerging group … as well as one that helps net Wagner a first All-Star trip. “Yeah, Boogie’s special,” Suggs said. “That was like a movie moment.” “It was a crazy experience, crazy adrenaline rush” Wagner said. “It’s great to see your teammates so happy for you.” (Photo: Ronald Martinez / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Nazir Afzal, who served as Chief Crown Prosecutor for North West England between 2011 and 2015, said “the statistics in sport are as heartbreaking as you can possibly imagine”, and called for governing bodies to self-fund a mechanism through which victims can report their experiences. Advertisement In November, a Premier League footballer accused of rape was further questioned by police, while the English Football Association (FA) also opened a safeguarding inquiry into a separate leading Premier League figure who has previously been investigated by the police for a number of sex offences. Neither can be named for legal reasons. Last month, The Athletic also reported former Fulham Ladies captain Ronnie Gibbons’ allegations that the club’s then-owner Mohamed Al Fayed sexually assaulted her on two separate occasions in 2000. Subsequently, The Athletic also reported on three ex-Fulham Ladies players’ deep concerns that their allegations of sexual abuse at the football club in the 1990s and early 2000s were not properly investigated by the Metropolitan Police or the FA. “Those women were brave to come forward,” says Afzal. “There has been so much silence, and abuse requires silence to happen. There will only be justice if victims speak up and receive the opportunity to document what they experience.” GO DEEPER Mohamed Al Fayed accused of sexually assaulting Fulham Ladies captain at Harrods Speaking on Tuesday afternoon at Women in Sport’s 40th anniversary conference, Afzal argued that one solution was for sport to self-fund an independent safeguarding regulator. “The reality is that we don’t talk enough about abuse,” he said. “We don’t talk about the fact that one in four women will suffer domestic abuse. We don’t talk about the fact that one in five are sexually assaulted. We don’t talk about the fact that more than 3.1 million British adults were sexually abused as children. Those are government figures and that’s the scale of the pandemic. “And the sad thing is, the statistics in sport are as heartbreaking as you can possibly imagine. You have the same issue. People are being silenced. People don’t feel able to speak up. Whistleblowers have faced enormous repercussions as a result of what’s happened to them, and all those things happen simply because they want to speak up. Advertisement “So what do we do differently? The simplest thing is ensuring that you get your voices heard, so regulation is absolutely key. Having a safeguarding regulator is absolutely important. “The smaller (sports) shouldn’t have to pay, but you need an independent agency to provide that level of independent scrutiny as to your performance. That will build public confidence, that will ensure the victims are properly heard.” The proposed Football Governance Bill, which will contain an independent football regulator, currently makes no provision for safeguarding or abuse cases.

Sign up to receive it directly to your inbox. Hello! Robert Lewandowski is still flying — supported by some youngsters on the wings. Oh, and the Premier League is back! On the way: 🗣️ Lewandowski exclusive 🇺🇸 Howard’s Pulisic rebuke 🔧 Reforming MLS Cup play-offs 🤕 Defining ‘an injury crisis’ Robert Lewandowski may be 36 years old, but if you thought he was showing signs of slowing down, you’re seriously mistaken. Barcelona are flying this season. So is their No 9. And he’s been talking exclusively to The Athletic’s Pol Ballus. What’s interesting is the Pole’s significant role in a side of precocious talents from the factory that is La Masia, the club’s academy. He’s 19 years older than Lamine Yamal and Pau Cubarsi and 16 years older than Gavi. Advertisement Perhaps their “more fearless and self-confident nature” is keeping him young, but they will do well to listen to a man who has been a mainstay in an era dominated by Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. His numbers are crazy: 525 goals in 674 games for Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich and Barca, 84 in 156 for Poland, 11 league titles and a Champions League. Only the duo mentioned above have more than Lewandowski’s 99 goals in Europe’s premier competition. You wouldn’t bet against him reaching a century on Tuesday against French side Brest. He should have a Ballon d’Or as well, after he was cruelly robbed when football was curtailed by Covid-19 in 2020. “I think I’ve been close to that elite level (of Messi & Ronaldo) in some moments and even beat them in different games,” he says. “I think we can say I was around!” For sure. Lewandowski’s remarkable 2020 campaign came under head coach Hansi Flick. The pair achieved great success together at Bayern and their union is proving fruitful — Barca’s prolific start to La Liga this season is testament to that. The key ingredient? Communication. “When he tries to explain something, I can understand straight away the way he wants to convince us to play,” Lewandowski says of Flick, who joined Barcelona this summer.  Compare that to his relationship with Xavi, who did not believe he had the pressing ability to lead the line anymore. The Spaniard was later pushed off the plank and, this season, Lewandowski has scored 19 times in 17 games — more than any other player in Europe’s top five leagues. I love that Lewandowski is an old-fashioned No 9. He is lethal and his role at Barcelona fits like a glove. He is in the final year of his contract, which has a clause that will trigger a another season if he plays more than 50 per cent of minutes in the 2024-25 campaign. Barring injury, he is going to do that. “I feel that I am where I dreamt to be, in the right place with the right people,” he says. 📲 LIVE coverage of Ruben Amorim’s first press conference as Manchester United head coach is here. My mouth is still ajar following the shock exit of Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami from the MLS Cup. Upsets are not necessarily a bad thing, of course, but the format of the event — which continues this weekend — remains deeply flawed. Don’t fret though, Jeff Rueter is at hand with his proposal to reform the play-offs. Advertisement He suggests MLS should introduce an initial group stage: two sets of eight, split into east and west, with teams seeded based on their regular season placement, which feeds into a knockout bracket. The benefits are pretty straightforward: Real Madrid have eight injuries in their squad. Premier League clubs are suffering, too. But when does it become a ‘crisis’? We asked resident football language expert Adam Hurrey (aka Football Cliches)… An injury crisis is unlike any other club crisis. It doesn’t, surprisingly, trigger a cracked-badge graphic on the back page of a tabloid newspaper, but it can nonetheless derail a club’s season. But what’s the casualty threshold for a true injury crisis? Injury crises tend to unfold over two to three weeks, but to be beyond the realms of merely “injury-hit”, a club must have no fewer than eight players on the proverbial treatment table at the same time (that is, around a third of a registered 25-man Premier League squad), but this isn’t just about numbers. An injury crisis must traditionally deprive a manager of all of their “recognised” centre-backs or centre-forwards, leading to the indignity of a makeshift option (a central midfielder dropping back or a flimsy winger deployed aimlessly as a No 9). At this point, managers talk in viscerally basic terms of getting “bodies” back to revive a squad that, in Redknappian terms, is “down to the bare bones”.

From clubs to managers, players to organisations, every Friday we’ll bring you the absurdities, the greed, the contradictions, the preposterousness and the oddities of the game we all love… Tottenham Hotspur, you really are quite something. As you may have seen, Spurs this week introduced a really different brand new club logo. At the same time, they have also remastered the famous Spurs font, expanded the text to include new widths and introduced a new palette of supporting colours. These are true actual words from their website. GO DEEPER Spurs have 'remastered' their 'brand identity' - but what does that actually mean? It all came with a statement for the ages which included this line… “A Club of firsts, Tottenham Hotspur took an unprecedented step in 2006 to modernise its identity by simplifying the badge around its world-famous cockerel, that has since stood alone in minimalistic, iconic fashion and which other clubs are now doing.” Advertisement An unprecedented step to make a simple badge. Never been done before. Not by Wolves, whose simple wolf head badge was introduced four years earlier in 2002. Not by Liverpool who switched to a simple Liver Bird in, erm, 1955. To be fair to the Club (sic) of firsts, they have managed a few lately like giving Ipswich Town and Crystal Palace their first victories of the season, am I right? Lads, it’s a cockerel, it looks absolutely fine, just stick it on the shirt and say no more about it. Tottenham Hotspur announce their new logo! ⚪ pic.twitter.com/1zaIoLStLX — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) November 18, 2024  Luckily, Row Z has obtained an exclusive transcript from the brand executive meeting where the idea was conceived. Brand exec 1: “Right, it’s been nine months of work, we’ve spoken to 300 fans, staff and players and it’s crunch time, we need to finalise the new logo. “Remember, the remit is; it needs to nod to the club’s proud history and look to its bright future while being bold, original, striking, inoffensive, woke, non-woke, right-wing, left-wing and vegan-friendly. “Any ideas, team? What have we got?” ***silence in the room*** Brand exec 2: “Well, I did have one idea. How about… and bear with me here…we keep it exactly the same as it was before, but we get rid of the name?” Brand exec 1: “I like it.” Brand exec 2: “Yeah? You don’t think we should come up with something more complex and intricate to reflect the amount they’re paying us for almost a year’s worth of work? Brand exec 1: “No that’s it, that’s literally perfect.” Brand exec 2: “Great! Done by lunchtime. Big 10 me brother!” Brand exec 1: “YES!” Brand exec 2: “God, we’re good.” Brand exec 1: “It’s what we do.” Brand exec 2: “It’s just what we do.” Brand exec 1: “And to dare is to do, am I right?!” Advertisement Brand exec 2: “Yeah, and also, to dare is to don’t change much? It totally works.” Brand exec 1: “Soya matcha green tea cream frappuccino blended beverage to celebrate?” Brand exec 2: “You read my mind.” For PR guff, Spurs have still got absolutely nothing on FIFA who this week unveiled a trophy for the Club World Cup, the competition no one wants to play in or watch. If you were designing a trophy for a football competition and wanted to draw on some inspiration you might think of iconic players, maybe? Or matches. Perhaps stadiums. Not FIFA. They’ve looked to the periodic table, astronomy and space travel’s historic Voyager Golden Records. Nope, no idea. That’s like saying the shiny-topped World Cup globe trophy was inspired by the glistening round head of MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace. “Every glint of gold reflects the relentless pursuit of greatness,” FIFA said of the prize for the Club World Cup, a competition which will feature the Inter Miami who were literally handed a place just because Lionel Messi is in their team. Maybe they’re in for the pursuit of marketing greatness? The trophy is here! ✨ Crafted in collaboration with @TiffanyAndCo, this trophy will be awarded for the first time to the winners of the inaugural #FIFACWC taking place next year. #TakeItToTheWorld pic.twitter.com/x1Wo1T1Lf4 — FIFA Club World Cup (@FIFACWC) November 14, 2024  The trophy includes wording in 13 languages (but not Welsh) and preserves “club football’s heritage for generations to come”. Shame no one will be able to watch the heritage unfold with no broadcaster yet willing to stump up the cash to screen it. Anyway, the best thing about the trophy is two engravings dedicated to president Gianni Infantino, including one line which says the tournament was inspired by him, which is a bit like Infantino having ‘inspired by Adam and Eve’ tattooed on his left buttock. Talking of a waste of time and money, Neymar’s injured again. The Brazilian has barely played for Al Hilal since joining last year with a host of injury problems, which, to be fair, sound pretty horrendous (he spoke this week of being tempted to retire). Still, there is a silver lining for Neymar in the form of his bank account. Al Hilal are believed to have paid around £80million ($100m) to buy him from Paris Saint-Germain and are reported to be paying the 32-year-old £90m ($112m) a season, plus a mansion, a fleet of luxury cars and a private jet. Given he’s played just seven times for Al Hilal (one goal, three assists) and for 438 minutes in total, that works out as costing the club around £2m ($2.5m) per minute so far. Which kind of puts in perspective getting enraged by being overcharged for that oat latte you bought this morning (OK, just me). We might think the Premier League is getting worse for dark arts, but it’s still child’s play compared to South America. Venezuela hosted Brazil in an important World Cup qualifier last week and they really, really needed a result. Really. Venezuela are the only nation in South American qualifying to have never reached a World Cup, but they’re in with a chance this time and were desperate to cling on to a point. Advertisement It was 1-1 deep into stoppage time — and, bear in mind, Venezuela were already down to 10 men and had saved a Brazil penalty — when Brazil had a corner. The home team managed to clear it, but to ensure that there was absolutely no way Brazil were about to score, someone did this… Venezuela set off the water sprinklers to stop a Brazil attack in injury time 🤣🤣  pic.twitter.com/VHlAaK08ey — Swearing Sports News (@SwearingSport) November 16, 2024  It was the kind of top-level s***housery that Neal Maupay would stand and applaud. So when the opposition goalkeeper feigns injury this weekend to get a little tactics break for their team, just remember it could be a lot worse. GO DEEPER Infuriating, embarrassing - and funny: What players really think of 'shithousing' And finally, this week, if you’re having a bad day or you’re a bit down in the dumps, just remember that, unlike Bradford City’s Lewis Richards, at least your bad day isn’t happening live in front of thousands of people.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How the Edmonton Oilers' prospect pipeline is growing stronger at centre,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938013/2024/11/22/edmonton-oilers-prospect-pipeline-centre/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 12:00:22 GMT",It's clear that centre is a position of strength for the Oilers in the NHL and at all levels of the system.,"NHL Stanley Cup-winning teams are inevitably built “up the spine” with impact centres, goaltenders and defencemen. For the Edmonton Oilers, the centre position has been occupied by Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl for most of the last decade, with Ryan Nugent-Hopkins in the middle for years before spending more time on the wing in recent seasons. Advertisement That’s the kind of quality up the middle every NHL team covets. As McDavid, Draisaitl and Nugent-Hopkins age, it’s important for the team to restock the position. For new general manager Stan Bowman, the age in this group (Nugent-Hopkins and Adam Henrique are past 30, and fourth-line centre Derek Ryan is 37) is a warning sign. The team needs young players, on inexpensive contracts, ready to take over. As it happens, the Oilers have quality marbled through each level of the system. Edmonton’s NHL depth chart at centre is so strong that head coach Kris Knoblauch routinely runs one or more pivots on the wing. This is a ridiculous depth chart. The 31 other NHL teams would move heaven and earth to approach this level of elite quality and depth. The group is aging, and in the case of Nugent-Hopkins and Henrique time on left wing has increased in recent seasons. Both men have had a tough time scoring this season, and both have played poorly for stretches. This happens over a long season, and the erosion of talent can’t be dismissed as a possible reason. Still, the organization should be able to ride this group to a Stanley Cup victory next spring without a tweak. Edmonton sent away two young centres with strong NHL futures over the summer in Ryan McLeod and Dylan Holloway. That’s a significant loss of talent in one position over a short period. The Oilers added Henrique via free agency (he was their own free agent after a deadline deal) and then deemed Ryan capable of another year in the middle. Management didn’t plan on Noah Philp having a strong impact during training camp and preseason, but his emergence as a viable NHL recall was welcome news. The Bakersfield Condors have had injuries at the position this season, but Philp is delivering strong results in the AHL. Advertisement At even strength, his goal share (8-5, 62 percent) is well clear of the other Condors when Philp is off the ice (25-29, 46 percent). These are small samples but Philp delivered even stronger numbers two years ago as an AHL rookie. At this level, he’s an even-strength difference-maker. An NHL recall has already happened, and another one appears imminent. There’s a chance Philp won’t see Bakersfield again the next time he flies to Edmonton. The other young centre worth mentioning is Jayden Grubbe. He’s a little younger (21) and has had some ups and downs this season but plays a rugged style and makes his presence known. Through the first 14 games of the season, he has just four assists (all at even strength) and owns an even-strength goal share of 47 percent (7-8). That includes a difficult recent run (4-7 over the last several games) but Grubbe’s rookie year was successful in this area. He has been playing with Seth Griffith at times in more of a feature role as the Condors coaching staff is doing a fine job of marbling youth and experience across the roster. There’s no hurry for Philp or Grubbe. Nugent-Hopkins and Henrique are signed long-term to play behind McDavid and Draisaitl. The Philp surge allows the team to look for an internal option in case of injury or a veteran (like Ryan) falters. Both AHL prospects are right-handed centres, win battles and possess a range of skills. Sam O’Reilly is years from making his NHL debut, but his skill set is ideal for the organization. A right-handed centre with all the tools, he was regarded as a strong draft option by both Corey Pronman and Scott Wheeler at The Athletic in the days leading up to the 2024 draft. Pronman used words like “two-way center, competes hard and has physicality; quality skill and vision and can create chances” while Wheeler wrote “natural center,  plus-level skater and athlete. He projects as a potential well-rounded, complementary pro.” Advertisement O’Reilly isn’t scoring at elite levels but is productive in all three game states for the OHL London Knights this season. On the power play (0-3-3) and penalty kill (1-1-2) his offence is getting results, and he’s now over three shots per game. At even strength, O’Reilly is a little shy in scoring (3-4-7 in 18 games). On the other hand, he owns a five-on-five goal share (13-7, 65 percent) that’s far superior to the Knights attack when he’s off the ice. With O’Reilly on the bench during even-strength play, the Knights are 39-32, 55 percent. The OHL doesn’t publish time on ice rates, but O’Reilly is involved in all three game situations and having a 200-foot impact at even strength. It’s difficult to shine on an elite team as an even-strength outscorer, but O’Reilly is delivering on draft-day promise. Edmonton’s amateur scouts deserve praise for O’Reilly, while the addition of William Nicholl in the seventh round looks like a stroke of genius. Nicholl didn’t play much for London in his draft year, and it’s easy for NHL scouts to miss talent due to lack of playing time. Nicholl is a “draft and follow” pick, so named because no one was quite sure what to expect. There’s no strong resume. So far this season, Nicholl is thriving with his minutes. Here’s a look at how much damage he’s doing this year compared to last season. Nicholl is on fire in the OHL, generally regarded as the world’s best junior league. The only ways for a true talent to fall in the NHL Draft from the OHL are injury and lack of exposure to scouts. Oilers scouts saw him good. We’re a long way from calling Nicholl a home run, but a recently chosen prospect (from the seventh round) who’s third in team scoring is notable. He’s rolling with top-end talent and the play isn’t dying on his stick. As we get closer to our December top 20 prospects list, it’s clear goaltending and centre are positions of strength for the organization. Advertisement Fans worried about O’Reilly’s early offensive production can be heartened by his even-strength outscoring and the low percentage of his offence that’s coming from the power play. The Knights aren’t feeding him cherry minutes, and even-strength points are tougher. His penalty killing prowess is another bullet point on the resume. Nicholl’s offensive explosion is both impressive and a small sample. It should be recognized as a big step forward but needs to be seen over the entire season. Among the two AHL centres who are considered prospects of note, it’s Philp who’s pushing for NHL work this season. After a year away from pro hockey, his performance is impressive.

Good morning! Play in the snow today.  I don’t think we can say last night’s Browns–Steelers game was the best of the NFL season. Was it my favorite, though? Absolutely, for two incredible reasons: Last night felt like the Super Bowl for the 3-8 home team, while the division suddenly gets more interesting with Pittsburgh slipping to 8-3. Can we play every game in the snow? Also, some overnight news: The Athletic’s Andrew Marchand reported that Jason Kelce will host a late-night TV talk show on ESPN for five weeks starting Jan. 4. Imagine the traditional late-night show, make it about sports and run it through the Kelce filter during the NFL playoffs. Voila. I asked Andrew if he thinks it’ll land:  “I don’t think Jason Kelce will be this generation’s David Letterman, but could this turn into another Pat McAfee-type show? Maybe. At 1 a.m., no one is picking up huge Nielsen numbers, but the point for ESPN is to be younger and cooler on social media and YouTube. It’s worth a shot.” Read the full report here.

Which teams are being underrated? Plus, the game of the weekend.","NCAAM Let’s get straight to the good stuff. “Game of the season” — even this early on — is not a superlative I hand out lightly. But there’s just no other way to describe Baylor’s 99-98 double-overtime win against St. John’s on Thursday night. It was the exact kind of palpitation-inducing, stand-up-and-scream-at-your-TV game that makes college basketball so fun. Advertisement For any of you poor souls who either A) were watching another eye-bleeder of a “Thursday Night Football” game, or B) went to bed early, St. John’s stormed out to an 18-point first-half lead. Rick Pitino’s team basically could not miss. But then Baylor, mostly behind Norchad Omier’s bully ball, plus a combination of Jeremy Roach and Jayden Nunn jumpers, chipped away. Finally, with under three minutes left in regulation, the Bears took their first lead of the night. Roach — the Duke transfer, and one of Baylor’s three high-profile additions this offseason — stepped to the line for a one-and-one that would ice the game, only to miss the first free throw, allowing Kadary Richmond enough time to hit a teardrop at the other end and send the game to overtime. After a back-and-forth slog, Baylor led by five with 1:36 left. Then Richmond, who by this point was limping, went back into takeover mode, scoring five straight to force a second overtime. Which is when things got really fun. St. John’s hit three of its eventual 14 3-pointers in double OT, and after the teams traded baskets, the Johnnies still led by five with 18 seconds left. The win was all but guaranteed. Then VJ Edgecombe — Baylor’s five-star freshman guard, playing back in his native Bahamas — drained a prayer of a 3 with six seconds left to make it a one-possession game. Baylor fouled on the ensuing inbounds, and after Zuby Ejiofor, who finished with a team-high 22 points and 10 rebounds, missed both free throws, it left Roach enough time to hit the winner: JEREMY ROACH FOR THE WIN! Baylor stuns St. John's in double overtime!pic.twitter.com/EsBVde7711 — Heat Check CBB (@HeatCheckCBB) November 22, 2024    For St. John’s, it’s a tough loss, but Pitino’s team, in the long run, is going to be just fine. Richmond — who finished with 14 points, seven assists and four rebounds — still doesn’t look totally comfortable, which should be nightmare fuel for the rest of the Big East. And Scott Drew’s Baylor squad has rebounded as well as possible from that opening night disaster against Gonzaga. The Bears still have plenty to clean up, but the offseason additions of Roach and Omier — who combined for 44 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists, including half of Baylor’s points in the two overtime periods — are clearly paying off. Advertisement I’ll take a rematch of that one in March, please. Let’s start with the latter of the two — Kam Jones’ 17-point, 13-rebound, 10-assist masterpiece vs. Purdue. Not only was this the first triple-double by any Marquette player since Dwyane Wade in the 2003 Elite Eight, but it was Jones’ first career game with either 10 rebounds or 10 assists. So, truly a breakout effort, the kind that puts the country on notice and puts Jones in any way-too-early National Player of the Year conversations. We would also be remiss not to mention that this was Jones’ first game since learning of the death of his old high school coach, and it’s beautiful that he dedicated a night like that to someone he held so dear. Jones led Marquette in scoring the past two seasons, but can we talk about his passing? The 6-foot-4 senior had never averaged more than 2.4 assists per game for a season, but he’s more than doubled that as a senior, with six dimes a night. He’s averaging a career-high 22.6 points per game, tied for the sixth-most amongst high-major players. Purdue cut its deficit to three points early in the second half, at which points Jones scored or assisted on six of Marquette’s next seven successful possessions. He started out with this feed: Then this ridiculous, contorting finish: And finally an, “LOL try to stop me” pick-and-roll layup: All of that before he scored eight of Marquette’s last 13 points, to put the game on ice. You’re going to be hearing a lot more about Jones this season — and Marquette, for that matter. The Golden Eagles have been one of the most fun teams to watch the first month. But that other triple-double that caught my eye? The one that, at least nationally, hasn’t gotten nearly the love? Jaland Lowe going for 11 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists against VMI on Monday. I get that the caliber of competition isn’t the same, but look at this dime. There just aren’t many guards in the country capable of making a cross-court, one-handed (Lowe is a lefty, so this is at least his dominant hand) pass through three defenders off a live dribble: And as for Pitt, fun fact: The Panthers are one of just 12 teams, as of this writing, with a top-25 adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency rating, per KenPom. The others include the top four teams in the country, plus six other ranked squads. But Jeff Capel’s team isn’t being talked about in nearly the same light, despite already owning two top-100 wins. Maybe that’s because the Panthers don’t have a singular star. Ish Leggett, who won ACC Sixth Man of the Year last season, has been the most consistent scorer, and college journeyman Damian Dunn has rediscovered his old form. (He played four seasons at Temple and a fifth at Houston). Advertisement With three straight high-major foes on the docket, we’re about to find out just how “for real” Pitt is, but as of today, I feel confident saying the Panthers are the ACC’s third-best team, behind only Duke and North Carolina. Marquette and Pitt aren’t the only teams I’ve been impressed with that still aren’t getting the love they probably should be. Three others: Xavier: Wake Forest beat Michigan, and Xavier beat Wake Forest … but it’s Michigan that’s ranked? Huh? The rankings will work themselves out, but Sean Miller’s squad is easily my pick for “most aesthetically pleasing” team. The Musketeers just play a gorgeous, modern version of basketball; they’re leading the nation in assist rate, at 77.3 percent. Yes, the most-experienced high-major team in America shares the ball well. They are 13th in 3-point percentage, with Indiana State transfer Ryan Conwell leading the way at a blistering 52.6 percent on 7.6 attempts per game. Among Xavier, Marquette, Creighton and UConn, the top of the Big East is gonna be a bloodbath. Inject it straight into my veins. Texas Tech: Before Thursday night’s loss to Saint Joe’s — shout out to the Hawks, who also beat Villanova — I can’t remember the last time a team rated so favorably by KenPom was unranked entirely. Texas Tech is a victim of the dreaded “ain’t played nobody” affliction that so many teams deal with in nonconference play, but UConn, Iowa State, Creighton and Cincinnati haven’t either. I’m not excusing Thursday’s one-point loss, which came via a free throw in the final 15 seconds, but I’m still buying all the stock I can in Grant McCasland’s team. New Mexico transfer JT Toppin has been a star — he had 22 points and 18 rebounds on Thursday night — and ranks fifth in KenPom’s NPOY rankings, a deserved placement for one of the best glass-cleaners in America. The Red Raiders went cold from 3 for the first time against the Hawks, but there’s more than enough depth here to compete with the Big 12’s best. Indiana: Ranked 16th nationally and tops of any Big Ten team, Indiana isn’t getting totally disrespected, but should we be talking about this team in an even loftier light? Mackenzie Mgbako has looked incredible, especially as a supersized 3-man next to Oumar Ballo and Malik Reneau; he was really the swing guy for IU this season, because if he couldn’t stretch the floor, this whole experiment might not have worked. Mackenzie Mgbako scored in a lot of different ways last night vs SIUE 31 points and 9 rebounds on 13/17 shooting, 4/5 from 3pt range pic.twitter.com/pVFfMyXQBi — ᗩᑎT ᗯᖇIGᕼT (@itsAntWright) November 7, 2024  Mgbako won’t shoot 63.6 percent from 3 all season, but between his deep shooting and his interior finishing, he’s been an ideal fit between those aforementioned bigs and Myles Rice. The Washington State transfer has been similarly awesome, albeit a little turnover-prone. I put Indiana right there with Purdue and Illinois as my Big Ten favorites, and it’s entirely possible Mike Woodson’s team rises into the top 10 if it wins the Battle 4 Atlantis next week. It’s not time for a full-throated discussion about Alabama — the Crimson Tide just dropped 100 points on No. 25 Illinois, and that was with preseason All-American Mark Sears sitting basically the last 12 minutes — but something just doesn’t seem totally right about Nate Oats’ team. “So you think Alabama sucks, huh?” Sigh. No. But for a team that had a reasonable case to be No. 1 in the preseason, with a returning All-American, three incoming top-35 recruits and a high-profile transfer big, the pieces haven’t all fit quite like expected. Advertisement Obviously, some of that goes back to Sears, who — according to Oats — asked not to be put back into the Illinois game because his teammates were playing so well. That’s noble, and about the best thing a legitimate leader can do. But his struggles are the reason that was even plausible. Here’s Sears’ shot chart from last season, per CBB Analytics:  Vs. his shot chart so far this year:  Sears isn’t hitting his above the break 3s at nearly a similar rate as last season. His 44 percent mark on such 3s last season ranked in the 94th percentile nationally; presently, his 30 percent rate is in the 48th percentile, or about half what it was. Sears is too good a shooter to struggle like this all season, and I’d comfortably bet on him and Oats rectifying those woes. But I’m more interested in Sears’s struggles at the rim. He was in the 99th percentile last season in shots at the rim, with 5.6 per game, but he’s getting to the cup only 3.2 times a night this year — and he hasn’t been particularly effective when he has, shooting almost seven percent below the national average in such situations. As for the team at large, the issue seems pretty simple: Alabama just isn’t shooting it as well. Last season: 37.3 percent from 3, 77.2 percent on free throws. This season? 30.8 percent from 3, 71.4 percent on free throws. Given the way Oats wants to play, there’s always going to be some shot variance with the Crimson Tide’s results — usually in a good way — but four Bama players had career-best 3-point seasons last year. That simply hasn’t matriculated. (Jarin Stevenson, who canned five 3s vs. UNC in the Sweet 16, is 0-for-16.) I’ve said before that I’m a big believer in the law of averages, and Alabama is going to be fine, but it might be more of a “very good team that can make the Final Four” than “elite team that should be a national title front-runner.” Same, same … but different. Alabama’s tough nonconference schedule
  Duke at Arizona. C’mon. Another chance for Caleb Love to play the Blue Devils? It’s delicious. Because I’m clearly feeling list-y, the three things I’m most watching for (live from the McKale Center) are: How does Khaman Maluach combat Arizona’s versatile frontcourt? Duke’s 7-foot-2 center has been solid — 9.5 points, seven rebounds and 1.5 blocks per game — but Tommy Lloyd can throw multiple looks at the freshman. Tennessee transfer Tobe Awaka has been an absolute monster on the glass — he’s top 10 in both offensive and defensive rebounding rate, per KenPom — but he’s only 6-foot-8. Then there’s Motiejus Krivas, the 7-foot-2 Lithuanian, one of the few players in the sport who can physically match Maluach, but he’s played only 13.3 minutes per game while rehabbing an offseason ankle injury. Maluach doesn’t have to carry the interior load alone, Maliq Brown and Cooper Flagg will both be in the mix, but how the freshman responds in a road environment could be crucial. Advertisement Will we get Good or Bad Caleb Love? Love in Arizona’s first two games: 13.5 points, 3.5 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game, while shooting 45.8 percent overall and 38.5 percent from 3 (on 13 attempts). Love against Wisconsin: 6 points, two rebounds, two assists, while shooting (hold your nose) 15.4 percent overall and missing all six 3-point attempts. Oh, and he fouled out in 25 minutes. Duke knows Love, and it has to hope it doesn’t get the guy who has averaged 16.9 points vs. Duke in eight career games. Which team hits 3s? Outside of its loss to Kentucky, Duke has made 11, 17 and 16 3-pointers in its three wins (all against sub-150 ranked teams). Arizona, meanwhile, has made 20 3-pointers all season, shooting an abysmal 27.4 percent from deep. That would easily be the worst of any of Lloyd’s Arizona teams. KJ Lewis and Trey Townsend, especially, need to get going in that regard, or it’s tough to see how Arizona has the scoring to keep up with a Duke team averaging 88.5 per game. For that last reason especially, give me Duke, even on the road. Plus, it’s only poetic that if Love got the last laugh against Mike Krzyzewski three seasons ago, Duke gets one final win against him.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Shedeur Sanders' recruiting pitch to bring talent to Colorado is playing out as promised,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938065/2024/11/22/colorado-football-shedeur-sanders-deion/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 11:05:56 GMT","To get to where they are now, the Buffs needed much more. The quarterback, teammates say, knew it, which is why he went to work.","NCAAF BOULDER, Colo. — Terrell Timmons Jr. was, like so many now, sold on the grandiose vision. The transfer wide receiver was convinced Colorado would make a stunning charge toward a conference title not just because of the Buffs’ famous coach — but powered by his new quarterback, Shedeur Sanders. Sanders had a direct hand in swaying many key players to take the risk. Advertisement “Two is going to take us there,” Timmons said before the start of the season. A guarantee that, at the time, could’ve seemed a smidge idealistic. But three months on, Colorado is not hard to find at 8-2, ranked No. 16 in the College Football Playoff rankings and in control of its own destiny in the shortening race toward a Big 12 Championship Game appearance. A Colorado win over Kansas on Saturday inside Arrowhead Stadium combined with No. 16 BYU beating No. 21 Arizona State on the road and Utah beating No. 22 Iowa State at home Saturday would clinch the Buffaloes a shot at the conference crown. They can also get there by winning out, including against Oklahoma State on Black Friday.  Yes, the Buffaloes are headlined by their effervescent head coach, Deion Sanders, the Heisman Trophy front-runner in two-way rarity Travis Hunter — and their quarterback. Shedeur Sanders is a pretentious lightning rod to some, a celebrity athlete with a celebrity father to others, and is in contention to be the first quarterback selected in next year’s NFL Draft. He has thrown for 3,222 yards and 27 touchdowns and seven interceptions through the first 10 games and is completing 72.9 percent of his passes, tied for second place in the FBS with Ohio State’s Will Howard. GO DEEPER If Shedeur Sanders wants to be drafted No. 1, he needs to act like it But to get to where they are now, the Buffaloes needed much more. Shedeur, teammates say, knew it, which is why he went to work. Beyond the endless reels of social media interview clips, beyond being one of the most efficient quarterbacks in college football for a second consecutive season, perhaps Shedeur Sanders’ most impressive feat was his role in aiding in building this Buffs roster. His stardom helped lure a likely successor, too. On Thursday, Colorado landed a commitment from five-star quarterback Julian “JuJu” Lewis, a former USC commit. During Lewis’ first visit this summer to Boulder, he posed in a Colorado uniform on a gold throne as Shedeur handed him a set of keys, signifying what he would be inheriting. Advertisement Deion Sanders made no bones about flipping rosters if something isn’t up to snuff. He’s cleaned house at a historic rate. And after a humbling 4-8 season in 2023, Colorado had no choice but to beef up its offensive line and add to an already talented wide receivers group that featured Hunter, Jimmy Horn Jr. and Omarion Miller. Shedeur Sanders went recruiting, too. Timmons said Shedeur reached out on social media to gauge interest after Timmons entered the portal from NC State last December. “I would say 2’s approach is a very pro-mindset,” Timmons said when asked to describe working with him now on a day-to-day basis. “He’s very detailed with everything he does in the film room, on the field, off the field, everything. He’s very intelligent. You can tell he really looks up to Tom Brady with just the way he moves and operates.” When former Ohio State running back Dallan Hayden was in Boulder on his official visit after entering the portal in April, Hayden said Shedeur wanted to sit down with him and explain what this year’s offense would need. In January, Shedeur came across tape of former FAU wide receiver LaJohntay Wester, who had entered the portal a few weeks earlier. “I pulled up his film, and I was recruiting him myself,” Shedeur said in April. “I pulled it up myself and was like, ‘Nah, we need this guy. This is the guy we want, this is the guy we need on the field.’” Like his dad, Shedeur sold Wester on the vision of what it could look like if it all came together in Boulder. In his first year with the Buffaloes, Wester has nine total touchdowns and has been one of most dynamic receivers in the conference. In last week’s 49-24 win over Utah, Wester had a 76-yard punt return for a touchdown. “He’s just a complete quarterback,” Wester said of Shedeur last month. “I’m glad to be on his side.” Another new wideout, former Vanderbilt transfer Will Sheppard, caught two touchdowns against Utah. At 6-foot-3, Sheppard is Shedeur’s most physically imposing receiver, an ideal complement to the all-around skill of Hunter and the speed of Wester and Horn. While the receiving corps was boosted in the offseason, Hunter remains Shedeur’s go-to option. Hunter leads the team with 74 receptions, 911 yards receiving and nine receiving touchdowns. Advertisement The pair spoke of the chemistry they’ve developed earlier this month on Shedeur’s podcast “2Legendary.” “You’ve just got to have that brotherly bond, even outside of football,” Hunter said. “If you trust me outside of football, of course you’re going to trust me on the field.” For this pass-happy offense to reach its apex, more trust was needed elsewhere, too. As stellar as the second year in Boulder has been for Shedeur, the first was equally maddening. Despite being one of the most efficient quarterbacks in the country and having a 27-to-4 touchdown-to-interception ratio, he was also the most sacked quarterback in college football. He was sacked 52 times in 11 starts. Shedeur called former Indiana right tackle Kahlil Benson after he went into the transfer portal last November to introduce himself. That same day, former UTEP guard Justin Mayers went into the transfer portal, and he had five missed calls from the same number. The guy who kept trying him? His future quarterback. A few months after he signed at Colorado, Mayers posted a video on his own YouTube channel of Colorado’s offensive linemen snowmobiling in the mountains above Breckenridge, Colo., with Shedeur. One of those linemen was former five-star left tackle Jordan Seaton, who jokingly jumped out of his blocking stance shin-deep in snow with Shedeur laughing nearby. Shedeur, Seaton has said in various interviews, was one of the main reasons he chose the Buffaloes. As the race for Seaton’s signature heated up last December with other high-profile programs vying for his talent, Shedeur FaceTimed Seaton showing off his pricey diamond necklace and said, “We can shine together.” Seaton was a mandatory blindside addition for the Buffaloes to try to keep Sanders upright. Still, the Buffaloes rank 94th in allowed pressure rate in 2024 (33.6 percent), only slightly better than last year’s brutal year in which they were 110th (36.7 percent). Shedeur and the line also have allowed 31 sacks through 10 games, which is 17 fewer sacks than this point a year ago. Advertisement Seaton said Shedeur’s desire to dissect defenses from the pocket and not overreacting to mistakes has helped his learning curve as a true freshman left tackle. “Having a calm quarterback makes me more calm,” Seaton said last month. “It’s like Mike and Ike with me and Shedeur.” Clint Trickett knows the range of Shedeur’s magnetism. Now Georgia Southern’s pass-game coordinator, Trickett recruited Shedeur while an assistant at Florida Atlantic four years ago. Before Shedeur joined his dad when Sanders took the Jackson State job in September 2020, Shedeur had committed to FAU. “You want to have a quarterback who is your lead recruiter and who is that driving force, but at the same time, to have one that makes people want to come play with him, that’s not common,” Trickett said. “Most quarterbacks are all about going and getting it, but most don’t have the star power to bring them in the boat. That’s what makes him special.” Colorado’s ambitious plan is working. Yet Shedeur’s approach to leadership has been called into question by some. After Colorado was smoked by Nebraska in Week 2, his postgame comments about being sacked five times in comparison to none taken by Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola appeared to some like he was pointing blame at his own offensive line. In September, The Athletic’s Jim Trotter spoke to two former NFL general managers about how Shedeur’s personality and leadership style may impact how he’s viewed throughout the rigorous draft process. “The stuff about the comments and things like that, people will worry about that a little bit, but the work ethic is the thing,” one former GM said. On the first play of the game against Utah last week, Shedeur telegraphed a pass that was intercepted. He responded by going 30 of 40 for 340 yards, three touchdowns and completed 73 percent of his passes. Critical of himself afterward, Shedeur said he needed to “take over a little bit more” and was going to apologize to the rest of the offense. Advertisement “I can’t put the team in that type of situation,” he said. “I’m thankful for the defense. I may need to take them out to dinner this week for saving me and saving the team.” His father has routinely said that if Shedeur is given adequate protection from his offensive line, he is good enough to win games with his talent. Deion recently said he will “privately” have a hand in which teams draft Shedeur and Hunter, speaking specifically to Shedeur on FS1’s “Speak” sports show, he wants an organization “that can handle the quarterback he is.” The duo strolls the sidelines together before every game as Deion bestows advice on his son. “Show them who you are,” he said before the win over Utah. Shedeur has been known to clap back at those who speak disparagingly of the Buffaloes or flaunt any number of his ritzy possessions — diamond-encrusted watches, cars, you name it — in the general direction of detractors. Teammates say they don’t see that side of him as being a true representation of who he is. They chose to listen to what Shedeur Sanders was pitching because it’s playing out just the way he said it could. Or, in the parlance of his father, the way it always would. “You know, he’s all on social media and famous, but he’s really a normal person,” Timmons said. “He’s not Hollywood. He’s a normal person like me and you. He’s just really good at what he does.”  (Top photo: Dustin Bradford / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Wisconsin-Nebraska game keys and prediction: Can offense break free after firing OC?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938552/2024/11/22/wisconsin-football-nebraska-prediction/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 11:05:55 GMT","Could the Badgers introduce enough tweaks on short notice to again create meaningful change, even if just for a game?","NCAAF The last time Wisconsin’s football team took the field for a game following an in-season firing of its coach, an unshackled offense successfully unveiled new wrinkles during a 42-7 drubbing of Northwestern. That was only two years ago — six days after head coach Paul Chryst was fired — when the staff under interim coach Jim Leonhard devised a plan that utilized its quarterback in a different way against an opponent on a four-game losing streak. Graham Mertz completed 7 of 10 passes off play-action for two touchdowns after throwing off play-action just nine times through the first five games. He also completed all nine of his passes out of the pistol formation, which the Badgers had not run once all season. Wisconsin threw six touchdowns in a game for the first time in program history. Advertisement Of course, that Northwestern team finished 1-11 and was far worse than the 5-5 Nebraska team Wisconsin, also 5-5, will face on Saturday. While Nebraska enters the matchup on a four-game losing streak, the Cornhuskers do have wins against bowl-eligible Rutgers and a Colorado team vying for a College Football Playoff spot. They also have more to play for, with one more victory clinching their first bowl game in eight years. But the parallel, on the heels of Wisconsin’s firing Sunday of offensive coordinator Phil Longo, remains. Could the Badgers introduce enough tweaks on short notice to again create meaningful change, even if just for a game? Or will it be more of the same in what has been yet another underwhelming season offensively? “I’m not going to say what our plan is, but we have a plan,” Badgers center Jake Renfro said. “It’s a really good plan, and we’re all super excited to show the world on Saturday.” 𝐆𝐀𝐌𝐄 1️⃣1️⃣ 🆚 Nebraska📆 Saturday, Nov. 23⏰ 2:30 PM CT🏟️ Memorial Stadium📺 Big Ten Network pic.twitter.com/4b7onYxTr3 — Wisconsin Football (@BadgerFootball) November 18, 2024  Here are three questions Wisconsin can answer Saturday, plus a prediction: Wisconsin isn’t likely to significantly stray from the concepts Longo introduced. But with tight ends coach Nate Letton and wide receivers coach Kenny Guiton shouldering more responsibility, the unit does figure to look at least somewhat different. Paring down the plan while better taking advantage of the players’ strengths will be critical. Wisconsin’s offensive line needs to spearhead the charge in a matchup against a Nebraska team with a top-20 run defense. Creating a push up front for running backs Tawee Walker and Darrion Dupree will help keep quarterback Braedyn Locke out of third-and-long situations. Perhaps this is a game in which running back Cade Yacamelli, who is averaging a team-best 8.3 yards per carry, could earn touches and provide a spark. Yacamelli hasn’t carried the ball in any of the past three games. Advertisement Locke, meanwhile, simply has to be better. Maybe the answer isn’t having him throw the ball 29 times a game, which has been his average this season. Locke is completing 55.1 percent of his passes and has thrown at least one interception in all seven of his starts. “He’s got to continue to grow and get better, and he knows that,” head coach Luke Fickell said. “We’re going to give him a better opportunity to be able to do that.” Frustration was evident among members of the defense immediately after Wisconsin’s 16-13 loss to No. 1 Oregon last week.The Badgers couldn’t have done much more to put themselves in a position to win against a team that was averaging nearly 36 points per game and had a Heisman Trophy contender at quarterback. Linebacker Jake Chaney and cornerback Nyzier Fourqurean said it was the toughest loss they had felt all season. But Wisconsin, especially with a reeling offense, likely will require another strong defensive performance. Nebraska has a lot more flaws offensively than Wisconsin’s three previous opponents — games that each resulted in losses. For all the excitement surrounding former five-star quarterback Dylan Raiola, the true freshman has been pedestrian of late. After throwing nine touchdowns and two interceptions in his first five games, Raiola has thrown two touchdowns and eight interceptions over his past five games. Nebraska hasn’t scored more than 20 points in the past five contests. The running game hasn’t helped Raiola. During this five-game stretch, the Huskers have averaged 3.1 yards per rushing attempt. No running back has gained more than 61 yards rushing. Nebraska coach Matt Rhule brought in Dana Holgersen last week to serve as offensive coordinator. Wisconsin’s defense played well during a 28-13 loss to No. 3 Penn State four weeks ago and then was thrashed in the next game against Iowa, which ran for 329 yards. Advertisement Wisconsin entered its final two regular-season games last year against Nebraska and Minnesota at 5-5 overall, 3-4 in the Big Ten and on a three-game losing streak. Sound familiar? It felt like that season a year ago was on the verge of disaster, but the Badgers rallied and beat the Huskers and the Gophers. Wisconsin faces the same challenge this time around. The difference is that second year results are no better than Year 1. The same players who preached patience last season have no choice but to utter similar refrains now. But disappointment is mounting, with Longo’s firing serving as the most public admission of failure offensively. The good news from Wisconsin’s perspective is that players generally have maintained a unified front. Receiver CJ Williams said it would be easy for players to start checking out. “But I think our team is so unselfish and mature that we have the opportunity to come together and grow stronger and finish out the season the way we want to and how we should,” he said. Sometimes, an in-season change can temporarily elevate a program by giving players juice. The conundrum for Wisconsin is whether an offense handled so exclusively by the previous play caller can work under someone else in less than a week. It didn’t for Holgersen’s first game at Nebraska in an eight-point loss to USC. The game truly does feel like a toss-up, though Nebraska is a slight betting favorite. Both teams are average. Nebraska is 0-8 under Rhule the past two seasons in games with bowl eligibility on the line. The Huskers also have lost 10 consecutive games to the Badgers. Those streaks won’t last forever, but my inclination is that Wisconsin gets it done Saturday with defense and a better rushing attack to squeak by with a win.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Chiefs defense lacking the same pass-rush production it generated a season ago,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5939069/2024/11/22/chiefs-defense-pass-rush-chris-jones-steve-spagnuolo/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 11:00:59 GMT","The Chiefs were second in the league in sacks last season. Through 10 games this year, Kansas CIty's 19 sacks rank 27th.","NFL KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Twice in Sunday’s loss to the Buffalo Bills, Kansas City Chiefs pass rusher Chris Jones did what he often does in a one-on-one matchup: He quickly defeated an offensive lineman to create immediate pressure on Bills quarterback Josh Allen. The problem for Jones and the Chiefs defense is that Allen finished both plays gaining positive yards instead of falling backward to the turf. Advertisement “We’ve got to get him down,” Jones, the Chiefs’ best defender, said Thursday. “I was there two times and didn’t wrap him up, didn’t get him down. It’s my mistake. (There’s) a lot I can learn from that.” A major reason the Bills scored 30 points in their win over the Chiefs — becoming the first opponent to score at least that many on them since Super Bowl LVII in 2023— is that coordinator Steve Spagnuolo’s unit never sacked Allen. “We’re hoping to crank it up and get the numbers where we want them, the hits, the pressures and getting the quarterback off his spot,” Spagnuolo said. “Those are things we need to get better at.” GO DEEPER How the Chiefs' little mistakes added up to their first loss of the season In fact, one of the biggest differences in Spagnuolo’s unit is that the Chiefs are not sacking quarterbacks as much as they did a year ago. In 2023, the Chiefs were second in the NFL with 57 sacks, sixth in quarterback hits with 63 and 14th in pressures with 172. This season they are 27th (19 sacks), second (45 quarterback hits) and 11th (99 pressures). “I don’t measure everything on sacks,” Spagnuolo said. “That particular quarterback (Allen) and a bunch of these quarterbacks we’ve played (Lamar Jackson, Brock Purdy and Baker Mayfield), we’ve had to play a certain way and sometimes you’re not getting four or five guys turned loose. “It makes it hard and (Allen) makes one guy miss and we’re off point, he can (scramble) like he did on that fourth-down play.” Put the team on his back. @JoshAllenQB 📺: #KCvsBUF on CBS/Paramount+📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/8kbW3A8o5y — NFL (@NFL) November 18, 2024  The play Spagnuolo referenced was the most critical late in the fourth quarter, when the Bills had just a 2-point lead and faced fourth-and-2 from the Chiefs 26-yard line. Defensive end George Karlaftis made the first minor mistake. He used a speed rush to gain a step on right tackle Ryan Van Demark but lost his pass-rush lane integrity that was supposed to help contain Allen in the pocket. Once Allen ran forward, he sprinted past defensive tackle Mike Pennel, linebacker Drue Tranquill and cornerback Nazeeh Johnson before reaching the end zone. Advertisement “You have to be critical of your own errors,” Jones said of the Chiefs’ four-man pass rush. “I don’t think we played our best game last (week). A lot of us could’ve played better. We’re going to get better from it. “We’ll get better. It’s something we can do collectively. We have seven more games in the (regular season). (There’s) a lot of football left to be played. We’re not counting numbers right now. We’ll see where we’re at at the end of the year.” Oftentimes against the Bills, and the previous week in a win over the Denver Broncos, Spagnuolo had to unleash a blitz to ensure he generated consistent pressure on the quarterback. The Chiefs’ last two sacks, against Broncos rookie quarterback Bo Nix, were generated in part because Spagnuolo blitzed. BOLTON STRIKES FOR THE 16-YARD SACK ⚡️ pic.twitter.com/aRSmNd4j7N — Kansas City Chiefs (@Chiefs) November 10, 2024  The Chiefs have blitzed at the third-highest rate in the league this season (36.9 percent), according to Next Gen Stats. Spagnuolo’s blitzes have led to the Chiefs’ recording a league-high 39 unblocked pressures, including 33 when sending five or more pass defenders, which also leads in the NFL. One reason Spagnuolo has had to blitz so often is because of the Chiefs’ lack of pressure with just four linemen. Jones once again leads all defensive tackles in the league with a pass-rush win rate — beating a block within 2.5 seconds, according to player tracking data — of 18 percent. The next highest defensive lineman for the Chiefs is Karlaftis, who ranks 19th among edge rushers. Sunday, the Bills anticipated the Chiefs’ blitzes on third down, leading Allen to be successful on pivotal thirds. He finished with eight completions on 16 attempts for 108 yards, a touchdown and an interception when the Chiefs blitz, according to Next Gen Stats. Allen did much better when facing four or fewer pass rushers, completing 19 of his 24 attempts for 154 yards. GO DEEPER NFL MVP odds: Josh Allen takes over lead from Lamar Jackson “The one thing that is concerning to me is that we need to win more third downs,” Spagnuolo said. “I’ve got to look at what I’m calling and we’ve got to look at what we’re doing. Some of those mistakes (from players) were on those particular plays.” Josh Allen to Curtis Samuel extends the Bills' lead! 📺: #KCvsBUF on CBS/Paramount+📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/BWGErDx9q3 — NFL (@NFL) November 17, 2024  Spagnuolo has a two-man cavalry approaching to help his four-man pass rush: defensive ends Joshua Uche and Charles Omenihu. Late last month, the Chiefs executed a small trade with the New England Patriots, exchanging a 2026 sixth-round draft pick to acquire Uche, a five-year player. Before he arrived in Kansas City, Uche recorded two sacks, three quarterback hits and 13 tackles in seven games with the Patriots. Advertisement “We were talking about trying to get, because Spags is so creative, a 3-4 linebacker to just give us a speed rusher,” general manager Brett Veach said of Uche last week. “Spags likes to collect power players, guys who are long. Because Steve is so great at what he does, we’ve talked about giving him a different chess piece to work with. “He can serve as the sixth linebacker on special teams, but also provide you a nickel rusher. When Charles comes back, you now have the ability to go with five defensive ends.” Uche played just five snaps against the Bills, but Spagnuolo understands his role — and snap count — should increase after spending close to a month learning the Chiefs’ schemes and pass-rushing techniques. “This is my first time going through something like this, so I’m doing whatever is asked of me,” Uche said of the trade Wednesday. “It’s all about teamwork and coming together as a unit to attack and execute the game plan. I’m doing everything I can to help the team win. All I can do is do my best with the snaps that I’m given.” Meet our defense's newest menace 😤 @_Uche35 pic.twitter.com/mY4Nj1CR4B — Kansas City Chiefs (@Chiefs) October 29, 2024  Last season, Omenihu had seven sacks, 11 quarterback hits and two forced fumbles in 11 games. He created an impressive strip-sack in the victory over the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship Game before suffering a torn ACL in his right knee. The Chiefs opened his 21-day practice window last week and he could return to the field in a limited role as soon as Sunday’s game against the Carolina Panthers. “I give that guy all the credit,” fellow defensive end Mike Danna said. “He’s been working his ass off to get back.” The Chiefs are optimistic that Uche and Omenihu can enhance their pass-rushing production, especially in the postseason. Perhaps the ideal four-man rush for Spagnuolo on third down, if he doesn’t blitz, is a lineup of Jones, Karlaftis, Uche and Omenihu. “When we play our best is when the unit’s chemistry is like that,” Spagnuolo said while interlocking his hands. “If we can get back to that, I think we’ll be OK.” Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"As F1 thrives in Las Vegas, some local businesses still feel the financial strain",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938951/2024/11/22/f1-vegas-local-business-lawsuit-disruption/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 11:00:46 GMT","Race organizers and Clark County have made efforts to lessen the burden on local businesses, but many still resent F1's presence.","Formula 1 LAS VEGAS — Jay’s Market On Flamingo is a corner gas station like so many others in and around Las Vegas, offering a little bit of everything. That it happens to be situated at the intersection of two of Las Vegas’ busiest roads makes it a convenient stop for out-of-towners needing supplies as they head in or out of the city. Advertisement However, in the past two Novembers, that convenience has been interrupted by the construction of the Las Vegas Grand Prix Formula One circuit incorporating 3.8 miles of city streets, necessitating traffic restrictions and outright road closures that create significant gridlock throughout the city. For Wade Bohn, the owner of Jay’s Market, located where Flamingo Road and Koval Lane cross, the congestion isn’t just a traffic nightmare but also a financial nightmare. His store is along the straightaway between Turns 4 and 5. “When I have no control over my business, succeeding or failing, yeah, I’m frustrated,” Bohn said. “I have no control. Literally, no control. For 13 years, I’ve had control of my business, been very profitable, made a great living for me and my employees. F1 comes to town, literally no business. It’s unbelievable and frustrating. “I can’t sleep at night.” As Bohn spoke, his anger was conveyed with his words, a quivering top lip and piercing blue eyes. He explained how the Las Vegas Grand Prix threatens his livelihood. In November 2022, the last time F1 didn’t race here, Jay’s Market had $628,000 in gross sales, Bohn said. The following year, however, sales in November fell considerably. As of this writing, he’s at $144,000 for this month. Overall, taking into account all the construction, road closures, snarled traffic and the closing of a sub shop that rented space inside the store at $4,000 a month, Bohn says he lost $3.4 million year-to-year from 2022 to 2023. And this year will be even worse. The culprit is mostly due to a race that Bohn and many other business owners in the area do not want to continue beyond this year, arguing that doing so will likely push them beyond their economic means. Already, Bohn has had to reduce his workforce by half and has started looking for a second job to help supplement his income. Advertisement “If there’s a fourth year (of the Las Vegas Grand Prix in 2026) I will bank on it that I will go into bankruptcy and lose my business,” Bohn said. “I am currently looking for work right now. Me, the owner, I need a job. I need to make money. I’m not making any money. It’s terrible.” Four lawsuits have been filed against Clark County by local business owners, including Bohn, seeking financial damages for negatively impacting their businesses. The Las Vegas Grand Prix declined comment related to any ongoing litigation. “We’re not like New York City where most everybody kind of lives in New York and where you can walk to work,” Lisa Mayo-DeRiso, a spokesperson for one group of business owners suing the county, told The Athletic. “Here, we have to drive to work or take the bus to work. People are having an hour to two hours to three hours a day extra to get to work and to get home. And F1 is not compensating anybody for those extra hours, babysitting time, time in your car, lost hours, lost time. They’re not compensating anybody for anything. They don’t believe that they should have to. “Our businesses have lost money.” Race organizers and Clark County have made considerable efforts to lessen the burden on local businesses, Lori Nelson-Kraft, senior vice president of corporate affairs for the Las Vegas Grand Prix, told The Athletic. Construction of the circuit for this year’s race was shorter than a year ago by 65 percent. And as much as possible, construction was done overnight to minimize disruption during busier hours. Representatives for the race have also met with local business owners, including Bohn, and they say they’re receptive to ideas that would further help the community. “We have adjusted plans based on that feedback,” Nelson-Kraft said. “So any of those businesses that participate have been able to have those forums to share that information and they are always included.” Advertisement One idea conceived to help ease traffic congestion was reducing the temporary bridge on Flamingo Road over Koval Lane from the four lanes it was last year to two. That bridge went up in October. “A lot of improvements have been made, and I will say that the restaurants that are in and around the circuit, specifically in that corridor, I have personally eaten at since the vehicular bridge has gone in,” Nelson-Kraft said. “And, anecdotally, while eating in that area there with my husband, I had conversations with their staff where they have shared with me, just as a guest of their venues, that they have seen remarkable improvements over last year.” According to Bohn, though, the bridge has yet to help. Instead, it effectively placed a wall around his store. Traffic flow is further backed to where even regular customers are deterred from stopping. At another small business in the area, a clerk (who asked not to be identified) took off his glasses and rubbed his temple when asked about the bridge. He followed by letting out an exasperated sigh, dropping an f-bomb and saying he didn’t have a comment other than to refer to the bridge by the derisive nickname used by some locals: “The Bridge to Bankruptcy.” “F1 tells me this is going to help me, but it looks like a three-story prison that’s covered in black tarp,” Bohn said. “There’s no access to my property from Koval, it’s completely shut off. I sit on a corner that has two access points when F1 is not here. I only have one when they’re here. When they’re here, it’s bad.” Said Mayo-DeRiso: “They put up that stupid bridge that cuts traffic. It absolutely impedes the flow of traffic.” Ideally, critics of the race would prefer the Las Vegas Grand Prix shift outside the city so that throughways no longer require being shut down. But the likelihood that Formula One would be willing to run on a circuit other than one that sees drivers speed down the Strip is a longshot, at best. The city and F1 have a 10-year contract. Advertisement According to Nelson-Kraft, last year’s inaugural grand prix had a $1.5 billion economic impact on the city. That figure outperformed expectations and the Super Bowl Las Vegas hosted in February, which generated $1 billion. Tax revenue from the race brought in $77 million, the most in Las Vegas history. Revenue projections for this year’s grand prix are lower than the 2023 edition, though they’re expected to remain robust. What that exact figure is won’t be known until weeks and months after Saturday night’s race. Three hundred thousand attendees are expected to turn through the gates across the three-day race weekend. “We are a tourism-driven economy, we are dependent on 150,000 plus hotel rooms filling up,” Nelson-Kraft said. “Special events are one of the big ways that we do it. And nobody hosts big events better than Las Vegas.” Standing in front of a drink cooler inside his store, Bohn wonders where all that money is going. None of it is being directed towards him, he said, while his bills continue to pile up due to an event he views as an unnecessary burden. “The s— pile keeps building up,” Bohn said. “I need this to go away. This nightmare goes away, I will sleep better.” (Top photo of Jay’s Market owner Wade Bohn: K.M.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,What we've learned about the Maple Leafs at the quarter mark of the season,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938576/2024/11/22/maple-leafs-season-quarter-mark-analysis/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 11:00:38 GMT","It's a good time to take stock of where the Maple Leafs are at, through the highs and lows of their season so far.","NHL I don’t think many of us had “Auston Matthews goes out of the lineup and the Maple Leafs go on a 6-1-0 run” on our bingo card for how the first month and a half of the season would go. But it’s been that kind of an unpredictable year so far in Toronto. We’re now at the 20-game mark, a quarter of the way through the season, so it’s a good time to take stock of where the Leafs are at through the highs (their current hot streak) and lows (a 3-4-2 stretch prior to that) of their season. Advertisement Let’s dig into some of the numbers and trends. After Joseph Woll shut out the Vegas Golden Knights on Wednesday, the Leafs now have the fifth-best save percentage (.914) and second-best five-on-five save percentage (.938) in the NHL. Few would have predicted that coming into the season given they had one of the least experienced tandems in the league. And especially considering Woll missed the start of the campaign due to injury. Not only have Anthony Stolarz and Woll been excellent overall, they’ve led the Leafs to the third-biggest save percentage improvement in the NHL this season. It remains a little understated how much goaltending hurt this team last season. Jumping from 25th up to fifth is absolutely massive, as they would have allowed another 12 goals at this point with last year’s save percentage. That would drop them to a negative goal differential and a much poorer record. Better defensive play is part of the story, as they’ve risen from 17th to 10th in quality of scoring chances allowed. But the Leafs’ goals saved above expected, which measures goaltending independent of defensive play, is sky-high — largely thanks to Stolarz, who sits fourth overall in that stat so far this season. There very well could be some regression in net the rest of the way, as only one team (Winnipeg) managed a team save percentage last season as high as where Toronto is now. But the bulk of this improvement is real. Take a bow, Lane Lambert. I didn’t think anyone predicted the Leafs would suddenly become an elite squad while shorthanded this offseason under the new associate coach, but they’re currently seventh in the NHL with a kill rate of nearly 85 percent. A Leafs team has finished that high or better just once since 2002-03, way back in the dead puck era, when Robert Svehla and Alyn McCauley were getting it done on a ridiculous 87 percent PK. Advertisement The interesting thing is the shorthanded improvement this season is being driven much more by the system and defensive play than the goalies. The Leafs’ team save percentage down a man is actually fairly similar to last season, but their expected goals against has been cut by more than 20 percent. Again, as with overall team save percentage, that’s one of the biggest improvements across the league. When it comes to the systemic part of it, regular Leaf Report analyst Frankie Corrado offered up this great video that explains the shift Lambert has Toronto’s PKers making. How different is the Leafs PK from last year to this year? @TSNHockey pic.twitter.com/cDbI2aKTK2 — Frank Corrado (@frankcorrado22) October 18, 2024  Which players have been driving the improvement within that new system? Steven Lorentz stands out the most, as the Leafs are allowing just 4.99 expected goals against per 60 minutes shorthanded with him on the ice. That sits fourth best leaguewide among all forwards who have killed at least 30 minutes so far this season. Last season the Leafs only had one player under 7.50 in that category, and some of their most used players — like TJ Brodie (9.17), David Kämpf (8.62) and Mark Giordano (8.46) — were getting crushed on the PK. Having the Chris Tanev and Jake McCabe pair take on the bulk of the minutes instead of the mediocre D group they used last year has also been huge. And, when healthy, Matthews was performing very well down a man, too. Steven Lorentz on blocking three shots in the same spot last night, including two on the same shift ""I was channelling my inner Timmy Brent there 🙂 … It definitely didn’t feel too good, but it’s always worth it when the guys come through."" Foot a little swollen today https://t.co/MD4OG9w8jk — Mark Masters (@markhmasters) November 21, 2024  The Leafs currently have the eighth-best record in the NHL and are on pace to finish with 4.6 more points than last season, a decent bump given the injuries they’ve dealt with. I doubt that’ll be enough to win the Atlantic Division, but it should be good for home ice in the first round. And at least keep them close to the defending champion Florida Panthers, who are the team to beat. Advertisement The fact the Leafs have done that while producing only the 16th most goals in the league is pretty hard to believe. The combination of the two sections above — great goaltending and great penalty killing — plus the Tanev factor have meant the Leafs’ defensive gains have overcome their offensive shortcomings so far. There’s certainly room for improvement in a lot of offensive categories, however, especially if you look at some of the underlying numbers. The Leafs are 23rd in shot attempts at even strength, for example, and 17th in shots for. In both areas, they’re giving up more than they’re generating, an indication that their ability to maintain zone time has been meh at best. They fare slightly better on expected goals and scoring chances, so the quality of what they’re producing is better than the quantity, which is great. But there’s not really any offensive metric where they are well above average right now. Like the PK, some of this is systems (as Justin Bourne laid out nicely recently) and some of this is personnel. But you can particularly see it if you look at the chance generation for the bottom-six forwards, many of whom aren’t producing anything under new coach Craig Berube’s north-south, dump-and-chase approach. For context: The average NHL team generates roughly 2.55 expected goals per 60 minutes at even strength. But when the Leafs have someone like Kämpf on the ice, they’re generating just 1.47, the fourth-worst mark of any forward in the league (minimum 100 minutes played). That’s old-school enforcer territory. Other players well below the average include Pontus Holmberg (seventh worst in the league), Lorentz (25th worst), Ryan Reaves (29th), Nick Robertson (35th), Bobby McMann and Max Domi. That’s a ton of passengers, players who in some cases are on the ice for 40 percent fewer chances than a break-even comparable would be. It’s hard to believe it’s even possible for one team to have five of the NHL’s 35 most impotent forwards, but that’s where Toronto is at with its bottom six. Advertisement It’s hard to win if half your forward group can’t produce more than an expected goal every four games. The Leafs have already been missing Matthews (obviously) and Max Pacioretty in this department, and any games Matthew Knies misses will hurt deeply, too, given he’s been one of their most dangerous players (3.15 expected goals per 60). But they do have other options, and the Vegas game showed why they need to try and use them and sit some of the underperformers. Speaking of which … We don’t want to go too wacky over small sample sizes and, to use Ron Wilson’s famous phrasing, build statues for young players before they’re ready for such accolades. But Wednesday’s win was certainly fun to watch thanks to the presence of Fraser Minten and Nikita Grebenkin. Both of them have been excellent with the Marlies so far in their first season as North American pros, and both showed enough against one of the best teams in the Western Conference that they deserve more time with the big club. Not that the Leafs have a ton of choice, what with as many as seven forwards out if Knies can’t play on Sunday against the Utah Hockey Club. But both Minten and Grebenkin (and to a lesser extent Alex Steeves) all looked far more dangerous than half of Toronto’s regular forwards have all season. You don’t want to rush anyone, but the good news is both players are on entry-level deals and can go up and down to the AHL as needed. Minten and Grebenkin are young, yes, but they have good heads on their shoulders; if they continue to play well, and end up getting into 15 or 20 games the rest of the way, that’s nothing but a big positive for the organization heading into another pivotal postseason. It may also give the front office and coaching staff more confidence when it comes time to start moving out some of the underperformers. Advertisement At the very least, the competition should be wide open for forward spots down the lineup. Regardless of contractual status, age or experience, they need to give everyone a chance to show if they can produce or not. And let the best players win the jobs. (Photo of Joseph Woll: John E.

Alisson is slowly stepping up his training load at Kirkby having been sidelined since early October with a hamstring injury. Advertisement Caoimhin Kelleher will continue to deputise away to Southampton in the Premier League on Sunday and the Republic of Ireland goalkeeper is also set to face the European champions in midweek. “We are careful with everyone, especially when it comes to muscle injuries,” Slot said. “Ali is back in training with the goalkeeper coach, but he is not training with the team yet. That is expected soon and then let’s wait and see where he is in terms of match fitness. He’s getting better and better. “Trent isn’t training with us yet but he is getting there. Jota is still apart from the group, the same as Federico (Chiesa), who is maybe coming back in the session with one exercise today.” Alexander-Arnold did not go away on England duty due to a minor hamstring injury he suffered against Aston Villa before the international break, while Jota has missed the past six matches with a chest problem. Asked whether Alisson, Alexander-Arnold or Jota had any chance of featuring either against Real Madrid next Wednesday or against Manchester City the following Sunday, Slot added: “That is something we have to wait and see. “The last few days of recovery is always the most tricky as they have to go from isolated training sessions to the group training sessions. “It’s difficult for me to judge now whether it will be one, two, three days or a bit longer. “With Alisson and Jota, I don’t expect them to be available for that game (against Madrid). With Trent it is going to be in between.” Captain Virgil van Dijk is fit to start against Southampton having been released early from international duty by Netherlands boss Ronald Koeman, while Harvey Elliott has resumed full training after recovering from a broken foot. “It was a blow for Harvey and for us when he got injured,” Slot said. “He was out for such a long time, nearly three months. Now we have to give him time to come back to his normal level.

Last week in a social-media post, the 28-year-old said that his house had been targeted once more and pleaded that it be “respected as a safe place” for his family. The initial incident took place in January during Newcastle United’s 3-2 defeat to Manchester City. Advertisement In April, Joelinton signed a long-term contract extension to remain at St James’ Park. However, in his Instagram post, Joelinton said: “What we care about most is our family’s safety and our kids growing up without fear. We simply want to live in peace.” Newcastle spent part of the two-week international break in Saudi Arabia at a warm-weather training camp and Howe and the club have sought to reassure Joelinton. “Joe is fine, obviously shaken up initially,” Howe said at his press conference ahead of Newcastle’s Premier League matches with Eddie Howe on Monday night. “I’ve had several conversations with him about his situation and his family and his family’s well-being, which is of course the priority. “Very sad really to see that happen to him again. Once is bad enough to see him in that situation, again, the same property, same outcome. I felt really sorry for him and we’re obviously, as a football club, helping him through this process and doing everything we can to ensure the safety of himself and his family and his possessions.” What’s more, Howe admitted that Newcastle are conscious of what appears to be a growing trend of break-ins at the houses of sports people and celebrities. “It is. It’s something we’ve been aware of for a long time and we’ve been trying to give support to the players in terms of trying to make sure that we’re as strong and resilient as we can, in terms of safety and procedures that the players need to put in place to protect themselves and their properties,” Howe said. “It is a growing concern. I think there’s been a lot of work done to provide that support and make sure that we are looking at prevention and ways to make sure that this doesn’t happen again. Certainly, we’ll try to do everything we can to improve that side of things for the players.” Callum Wilson may make his first appearance of the season against West Ham on Monday night, although Howe insists Newcastle will be cautious with the striker, given his string of injury problems, the latest of which have affected his back and his hamstring. “He’s doing well,” Howe said of Wilson. “We anticipate he’s going to train with the group today. Whether he’s quite there for West Ham, let’s see. There’s a chance he’ll be involved but we have to get through the next few days of training first. Advertisement “The most important thing is that Callum does come back and when he does he’s in a good place to contribute given his importance. We’re at a delicate stage of his return. We have to manage the last parts carefully. Such a valuable player but we have to learn from previous spells.” Kieran Trippier, meanwhile, is in line to return to the Newcastle squad for the first time since October 5 following his hamstring injury. “Slightly closer I’d say,” Howe said. “He trained yesterday, trained well, felt good, no ill-effects, and looked sharp. We’re in the same situation in terms of managing the last few days of rehab carefully.” Dan Burn will serve a one-match suspension for picking up five yellow cards, while Emil Krafth is set to miss six to eight weeks after breaking his collarbone. “Just Emil Krafth had an operation,” Howe said. “We anticipate he’s going to be out for around six to eight weeks. That’s a big blow for us to lose him as such a consistent performer.

Manchester City, Aston Villa, Newcastle United and Nottingham Forest were the only clubs to vote against the proposed alterations. Manchester City, whose arbitration with the Premier League in the summer led to an independent panel finding some aspects of the APT rules unlawful, were the most vocal about the changes being knocked down. Advertisement In the weeks since that decision was made public in October, legal letters were being sent between City and the Premier League over how the issue should be resolved. “The amendments to the rules address the findings of an arbitration tribunal following a legal challenge by Manchester City to the APT system earlier this year,” read a statement from the league. “The Premier League has conducted a detailed consultation with clubs — informed by multiple opinions from expert, independent leading counsel — to draft rule changes that address amendments required to the system. “This relates to integrating the assessment of shareholder loans, the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year and changes to the process by which relevant information from the League’s ‘databank’ is shared with a club’s advisors. “The purpose of the APT rules is to ensure clubs are not able to benefit from commercial deals or reductions in costs that are not at fair market value (FMV) by virtue of relationships with associated parties. “These rules were introduced to provide a robust mechanism to safeguard the financial stability, integrity and competitive balance of the league.” GO DEEPER Premier League clubs have changed associated party transaction rules. Here’s what it means The Premier League, due to being unable to process APT deals and potentially open to damages from other clubs trying to secure associated party deals in the interim period, were keen to table their list of amendments as quickly as possible. They have been consulting with clubs for more than a month regarding changing the APT rules, with Manchester City’s view being that no vote should take place until the tribunal has provided its full guidance on the APT rules. The Premier League have spent the last few weeks addressing the points that were found to be unlawful in the tribunal, leaving the other regulations in place. The new rules, the Premier League say, will ensure there is parity between the treatment of shareholder loans and other APTs going forward. Transitional rules will be in place to clarify how existing shareholder loans will be treated within that framework. Going forward, shareholder loans will need to be submitted as an APT and subjected to a fair market value assessment. Advertisement If it is determined that the loan is not fair market value, then the club will have to terminate or vary the loan to reflect what the Premier League deems to be fair market value and also pay any shortfall in interest. Another change to the rules is that any shareholder loan which is replaced with other forms of payer — such as being converted into equity or repayment — within 50 days will not be required to be submitted as an APT or assessed for fair market value. If a shareholder loan was entered into the accounts after December 14, 2021 and remains in effect on January 11, 2025, then it must be submitted as an APT. Should the Premier League then determine it is not at fair market value, then the club is allowed to retain the loan on its existing terms, although adjustments will need to be made to its accounts for 2024-25 as if it was at fair market value. Aston Villa’s co-owner, Nassef Sawiris, had called for the vote to be delayed, telling the Daily Telegraph on Wednesday that they would be “voting against the proposed APT rules”, lobbying instead for a three-month delay. But 16 top-flight clubs voted in favour of amending the rules now, meaning the Premier League has scored a victory. The Premier League also announced that clubs have unanimously agreed to establish a new in-house media operations business after 20 years in partnership with IMG. The plan is for all international media content production and distribution to be brought in-house for the start of the 2026-27 season. The meeting also saw the dates for the 2025-26 campaign confirmed with the opening round of fixtures set to begin on Saturday, August 16 with the closing weekend coming  on Sunday, May 24.

First reported by the Associated Press on Thursday, multiple sources have confirmed to The Athletic that the bid initially put forward by Andretti Global, which F1 rejected at the end of January, has gained fresh momentum in recent weeks thanks to General Motors’ involvement. Advertisement It comes following a restructuring of the senior management at Andretti, which included the exit of Michael Andretti, the chairman and CEO, from an operational role, handing the reins over to Dan Towriss, who took an ownership stake in Andretti Global in 2022. Towriss has been on site ahead of this weekend’s Las Vegas Grand Prix, which staged its opening practice sessions on Thursday evening. Andretti’s proposal always heavily leaned on involvement from General Motors, which planned to build its own F1 power unit in 2028 and enter the sport through its Cadillac brand. The Athletic revealed in the days prior to the F1 rejection announcement that the prototype Andretti F1 car, a version of which was already in the wind tunnel, was in development with significant input from General Motors’ engineers. However, concerns over the quality of the entry, which F1 referred to as “a novice constructor” when detailing its decision, and the gap until General Motors would build its own engine in 2028 prompted it to reject the bid in January. It sparked an outcry from the Andretti family and also led the Department of Justice’s antitrust division to launch an investigation into F1’s owner, Liberty Media, over the decision. Liberty maintained that it would fully cooperate with the DOJ’s investigation. F1 said when rejecting Andretti that it “would look differently on an application for the entry of a team into the 2028 championship with a GM power unit, either as a GM works team or as a GM customer team designing all allowable components in-house.” The possibility of having another sizable automaker, particularly in the United States at a time when the sport has enjoyed rapid American growth, has always appealed to F1. It is understood there could be an announcement soon from F1 providing an update on the process regarding General Motors’ bid as it takes over the Andretti project. Advertisement F1’s current 10 teams have always been lukewarm about expanding the grid. Under the existing commercial terms, General Motors would be required to pay an anti-dilution fee that would be split between the existing 10 teams due to the change in the prize money revenue. But a sign of a softening in the stance toward General Motors joining the grid as an 11th team came in Thursday’s FIA press conference ahead of the Las Vegas GP, featuring Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff and Ferrari F1 chief Fred Vasseur, both of whom seemed receptive to the possibility. “I think if a team can add to the championship, particularly if GM decides to come in as a team owner, that is a different story,” Wolff said. “As long as it is accretive, that means we’re growing the popularity of the sport, we’re growing the revenue of the sport, then no team will be ever against it. So I’m putting my hope in there.” Vasseur noted that the teams did not have a say in the matter, with the decision lying solely with F1. “For sure, as Toto said, that if it’s good for the sport, good for the show, good for the business, and add value on the sporting side, that we are all OK,” Vasseur said. “But again, the decision is with FOM.” F1 declined to comment on the topic when contacted by The Athletic.  A spokesperson from Cadillac told The Athletic, “We continue to work with the FIA and FOM regarding our expression of interest and are excited about our progress.  In parallel, development of our team, car and power unit continue.  We have no additional news to announce at this time.”  GO DEEPER How F1 turns America's most famous road into a racetrack  (Photo: General Motors) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The teenage pair also have manager Regis Le Bris saying they are best staying on Wearside for their development. Advertisement Rigg, who made his Sunderland debut at 15, signed a three-year deal in July and Bellingham extended his contract in August until June 2028. Yet the impressive progress of both players has seen them tracked by clubs in the Premier League and Europe. The length of the contracts give Sunderland negotiating strength, as does the form of the team under Le Bris and the fact both teenagers are playing regularly. The Sunderland manager, speaking at the club’s training ground on Thursday, was keen to emphasise the players should understand the nature of “the project” they are involved in and the benefits of staying where they are. “I think with these players,” Le Bris said of Rigg and Bellingham, “they are involved in the project, and they know that they can improve in this team. “So from a personal perspective, it is good for them, and also to be part of this journey as well. It is rare to have this. Sometimes you can go a whole career without having these elements — where you are in a club, you like that club, you are improving and you believe in a very interesting journey. I am confident for the future. “I think it is important for them to be here until the challenge is not high enough for them. Probably, when they feel that they need something more to develop, that should be the right moment to leave. “But at the minute, for both players, I think they are still in the right zone for their career development. They need to play, and they need to learn. They need to learn about playing in a collective style, so for them, I think the culture we have here is still working for them. I think the graph of their learning is still going up at a good level.” Le Bris said the topic is not discussed every day but the club are aware of increasing interest and, while it is not anticipated either will move in January, he acknowledged: “I know the journey the players are on, but the environment is still complex. “From a rational perspective, it is very clear, but sometimes you do not know what else in going on in the environment that a player is in. Sometimes that can make them make another decision.” Advertisement Bellingham is one of three significant Sunderland suspensions at Millwall, along with Trai Hume and Patrick Roberts. The manager also had bad news on two more injured players, Romaine Mundle (hamstring) and Alan Browne (leg fracture), who will be both be out of “six to eight weeks”. The better news is that Aji Alese is fit again and available.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Browns stun Steelers in snowy Cleveland as Nick Chubb scores late go-ahead TD: Key takeaways,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5939592/2024/11/22/steelers-browns-score-result-takeaways/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 05:20:41 GMT",Chubb's first two-touchdown game since 2022 helped fuel Cleveland to its third win of the season.,"NFL By Zac Jackson, Mike DeFabo and Amos Morale III As rapidly falling snow piled up on Huntington Bank Field, the Cleveland Browns turned to Nick Chubb to carry them home against the Pittsburgh Steelers in a 24-19 win Thursday night. After trailing by 12 in the fourth quarter, the Steelers (8-3) stormed back to take a 19-18 lead late in the fourth quarter by scoring back-to-back touchdowns within a two-minute span. Advertisement But then Browns QB Jameis Winston settled into a groove. After the blinding snow wreaked havoc on the passing game previously, he overcame the wintry conditions to orchestrate a nine-play, 45-yard drive, punctuated in the game’s final minute by Chubb plowing ahead for a 2-yard touchdown. Chubb’s two-touchdown game was his first since 2022, and Winston added another rushing score early in the fourth to fuel Cleveland to its third win of the season (3-8). After the game, Steelers WR George Pickens, who got in a scuffle with Browns CB Greg Newsome II after the final play, told a group of reporters the weather played the largest factor in the game, not the Browns’ success. “The conditions played a huge, huge part in today’s game. I don’t really think the Cleveland Browns are a good team at all,” he said. “I think the conditions kind of saved them.”  Jerry Jeudy has been a new player since Winston took over, and Jeudy delivered again here. The Browns appeared to have had this game won multiple times, but they didn’t set themselves up to really win it until Winston hit Jeudy on third down with a little over a minute left. It was the Browns’ first third-down conversion of the night in 10 tries, and it set up a situation where the Steelers basically had to let Chubb score his second touchdown of the night to preserve time. A strange, snowy game went to the home team thanks to multiple heroics, but the Browns would not have won it without Winston and Jeudy, who had six catches for 85 yards and has topped 70 receiving yards in each of Winston’s four starts. — Zac Jackson, Browns beat writer The Browns won in wild fashion. They wouldn’t have won without going 4-for-4 in converting fourth downs. There was a lot of sloppiness from both sides as part of a 27-point fourth quarter, but the Steelers failing to convert three fourth downs ended up coming back to sting them. Advertisement The Steelers tried a 58-yard field goal instead of punting on the game’s first drive, and later in the first quarter they inserted Justin Fields for a predictable fourth down run that the Browns blew up. Later, Jaylen Warren ran right into the teeth of the Browns defense on a fourth down run. The Steelers made a bunch of questionable decisions in this game, and it’s not a stretch to say they mismanaged those fourth downs and a late third down on which they had Fields throw a deep pass instead of running in snowy conditions. It was not Mike Tomlin’s finest moment. — Jackson The Browns defense has not played to its pay grade or its 2023 standard. And though it faltered in the fourth quarter, the Browns finished more plays than the Steelers defense did and ultimately finished the game. Myles Garrett had 3 1/2 sacks, and the Browns came up big on multiple fourth downs and on the Steelers final two possessions. —Jackson The Steelers’ boom-or-bust offense showed its explosive side and its warts. For most of the game, Pittsburgh’s most-consistent offense came from Russell Wilson deep shots. However, the Steelers struggled to run the ball consistently, couldn’t keep Wilson upright and repeatedly failed on short-yardage situations. By the time the Browns took a 18-6, fourth-quarter lead, the Steelers had gone seven quarters without a touchdown. Needing a spark, the Steelers leaned on both of their quarterbacks. First, Fields provided a chunk play on a designed quarterback run, racing 30 yards down the right sideline. He later helped cap the drive with a touchdown when he came into the game and handed the ball to Warren on a read-option. Then, after Nick Herbig strip-sacked Winston, Wilson connected with Calvin Austin III for a 23-yard touchdown to put the Steelers ahead, 19-18. Advertisement The Steelers have been a difficult team to figure out this season. Erasing a 12-point lead in six minutes — after failing to score for seven quarters — continues to make this a hard team to understand. Blowing that lead makes the conversation even messier. But one thing is becoming clear: Playing both quarterbacks may be necessary for the Steelers get out of ruts and rectify their red zone woes. — Mike DeFabo, Steelers beat writer The Steelers’ defense was nearly perfect on third down, as the Browns went 1-for-10 on the evening. However, fourth down was a completely different story. The Browns went 4-for-4. That included a Winston rushing touchdown that put the Browns ahead 18-6. Later, with Pittsburgh leading 19-18, the Steelers had a chance to end the game when the Browns faced a fourth-and-3 from Pittsburgh’s 38. However, Winston hit Jeudy for five yards and a first down. Later in that same series, the one third down the Browns did complete was a back-breaker that set them up for the go-ahead touchdown. — DeFabo (Photo: Nick Cammett / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Made available through the NBA’s partnership with Sotheby’s, the two Lakers jerseys are being sold as a pair in an auction that began on Thursday. By Thursday night, the jerseys had already drawn 34 bids, with the price up to $70,000. LeBron’s jersey was photomatched to the Lakers’ 110-103 win to the Timberwolves to begin the 2024-25 season, in when he played 34 minutes, scored 16 points and had five rebounds and four assists. It was also matched to two preseason games and the jersey he wore during NBA media day. Advertisement Sotheby’s says the Bronny jersey was worn during the second half of the Oct. 22 game, in which he played two minutes, went 0/2 from the field and secured one rebound, though it could not be photomatched “due to a lack of media of Bronny without a warm-up jacket on.” It was photomatched to four preseason games and NBA media day, however. Bronny James’ NBA Summer League debut jersey was sold by Sotheby’s in September for $38,400 — far more than the jerseys of the top picks in the 2024 draft.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Caitlin Clark joins ownership group looking to bring NWSL team to Cincinnati,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5939553/2024/11/21/caitlin-clark-nwsl-cincinnati-team-ownership/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 03:23:36 GMT",Cincinnati is considered a finalist in the race to land the NWSL’s 16th franchise.,"NWSL Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark has joined an ownership group looking to bring an NWSL expansion team to Cincinnati, a representative for the NWSL Cincinnati bid confirmed to The Athletic. On Friday, NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman confirmed Cincinnati, Cleveland and Denver as the three finalists in the bidding process for the league’s 16th team. Advertisement “The process is ongoing, and we’re really enthusiastic about the final three prospects that we have in the process,” she said in her league address ahead of the NWSL Championship in Kansas City. “Those three markets are Cincinnati, Cleveland and Denver, and we’ll have news to share in the coming weeks as we move to close with one of those three markets.” The league is expected to award the bid before the end of the year, with that team beginning play in 2026 alongside another expansion team in Boston. ESPN was the first to break the news of Clark’s involvement. “The NWSL Cincinnati bid team is thrilled that Caitlin Clark has joined our ownership group in pursuit of bringing a women’s professional soccer team to our city,” the ownership group said. “Her passion for the sport, commitment to elevating women’s sports in and around the Greater Cincinnati region, and influence as an athlete and role model for women and girls around the world, make her a vital part of our compelling bid to become the 16th team in the NWSL.” The 22-year-old Clark was selected first in the WNBA Draft by the Indiana Fever in 2024 after a prolific college career at the University of Iowa. Her rookie season for the Fever brought with it unprecedented attention, or what many called the “Caitlin Clark effect.” While Clark’s involvement in an NWSL may come as a surprise to some, her interest in soccer was well-documented. She grew up as a two-sport athlete in Iowa, playing soccer in high school before committing to basketball full-time. “Her accomplishments and contributions to women’s sports is incredible, historic. It’s changed the game for everyone, and she’s amazing. Having her interest in the NWSL is an honor,” Berman said. “We couldn’t be more excited about her having shared her own personal story about having been a young soccer player and loving the game, and her messaging around being a multi-sport athlete is so important for young kids who aspire to be just like her, and the future is bright for how we could potentially work with her or others who are influencers and interested in engaging and growing our league.” Advertisement The Cincinnati group has strong ties to Major League Soccer’s FC Cincinnati. The group, led by Jeff Berding, FC Cincinnati’s president and co-CEO, the team’s controlling ownership group and management team, with support from “a cohort of women executives,” first confirmed its interest in June. While the NWSL has been tightlipped about the race for NWSL’s next expansion team, a name like Clark’s certainly raises the profile for Cincinnati to bid. It helps that the team has the backing of FC Cincinnati’s ownership, meaning that an NWSL team in the city could potentially share resources and facilities with the MLS club. The ownership group in nearby Cleveland recently announced an ambitious proposal to build a new stadium to support a future NWSL team as well as an MLS Next team in the city’s downtown. It secured the land through a public-private partnership with the city. That proposal, though, hinges on the NWSL bid being awarded to them.

The committee overseeing the Hall’s contributor category bypassed the New England Patriots owner in favor of Ralph Hay, who helped set up the original meetings for the league that became the NFL, according to a league source. Hay was also owner of the Canton Bulldogs from 1918 to 1922, winning an NFL title with them. Advertisement Kraft, 83, has hoped to join the game’s greats in the Hall of Fame for multiple years now but was again passed over by the committee. Kraft’s supporters would note that since Jerry Jones, who has overseen three Super Bowl teams, is in the Hall of Fame, Kraft certainly should be considering he’s won twice as many Super Bowls, while, like Jones, serving as one of the game’s most influential figures. Kraft chairs the league’s core media committee, which was responsible for securing a new media rights deal in 2021 reportedly worth more than $100 billion and helped broker a deal in 2011 that ended a lockout. Kraft also built Gillette Stadium and oversaw the creation of Patriot Place, a multi-use commercial complex that became the envy of other owners. While it’s unclear the exact reasons the committee hasn’t yet chosen Kraft to enter the Hall of Fame, it’s possible that the Patriots’ scandals (Spygate and Deflategate top among them) and Kraft’s 2019 misdemeanor solicitation of prostitution charges in Florida, which were dropped, played a role. Kraft has been a finalist for consideration from the committee for 13 straight years. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

Plenty of players mentioned finding the balance between riding their respective semifinal successes into the final while also trying to get the timing and intensity right so that their emotions would help instead of hinder. Advertisement Both teams had interesting roads to the final, with the Spirit going all the way to penalties and getting three saves out of Aubrey Kingsbury, and the Pride eventually opening up to take the lead on the Current but having to endure 18 minutes of stoppage before they could seal the victory. For the Pride, there was a lot of reflection on the unprecedented season they’d had and just how much work has gone into this moment, including their league-leading defense, featuring Defender of the Year Emily Sams. “I don’t know what it is,” Sams said when asked what about the Pride’s defensive unit had them clicking all season long. “I think for me, I love playing with Kylie (Strom). We’ve had conversations about that, and I think that makes like this – and with Anna (Moorhouse) the center of our defense — so solid, just because we both enjoy playing with each other so much, and we’ve gotten to know each other’s tendencies. And I think we see the game very similarly. So I think that contributes a lot to it, but I think it’s just the chemistry.” “There’s a reason why what we did this year has never been done before and may never be done again,” said Strom. “I think we fully understand what we did is incredible. And next year, I don’t think we’re gonna go into preseason being like, ‘Hey, we’re gonna go 24 games unbeaten.’ Our goal setting is not going to be these crazy things. I think for us, why we’ve broken all of these records and had an incredible season is we’ve just been worried about the process and not the result.” Part of that process is obviously the defensive work that former defender and head coach Seb Hines has put into the team. But Orlando is also a team that can hit you through build up, through transition, through direct balls or wide play, and that makes it hard to predict how this No. 1 versus No. 2 clash will play out. Advertisement “I think we have good variety to our attack, and so that’s our biggest strength,” said Kerry Abello. “If we’re being shut down out wide, we’ll go right up the middle. I think (Washington’s) biggest thing is their attacking threats with (Trinity) Rodman, (Rosemond) Kouassi, that we know that we’re gonna be under it a little bit.” GO DEEPER NWSL Championship: How Orlando Pride and Washington Spirit match up For the Spirit, the clear highlight of their afternoon was Rookie of the Year Croix Bethune also picking up the Midfielder of the Year award. The entire team had come prepared with t-shirts, which they all donned before posing for a group photo on stage (owner Michele Kang played along, though opted to hold up her shirt rather than layer it over her far more fashionable ensemble than the Nike tracksuit sported by the players). Many of the Spirit players have spoken about the changes across the season, but one of the other main storylines heading into this championship is the stellar play of their rookies — including Bethune, but certainly not limited to her. Midfielder Hal Hershfelt said Thursday that the rest of the team had the expectation from day one that while it was understood the rookie class was young, that didn’t change anything. “We’re not going to treat you like rookies,” was the message, according to Hershfelt. “They expect you to make an impact, like any other player of any other age would,” she said. “That set our confidence up. They believe in us.” The team’s grit was another constant theme, no matter what player was speaking — but the team has also felt prepared all season long for whatever challenge laid ahead of them, even as change was a constant. The semifinal win over Gotham was the first example Andi Sullivan brought up. “We felt prepared. We felt like we had momentum in the game, although sometimes the other team, especially if they’re down a player, would want to just make it to penalties,” she said. Advertisement But they were prepared for those too. “We approached it in the way that we wanted to, and I felt really confident.” “I didn’t realize how many changes and battles we’ve had to overcome until being asked these questions,” said Casey Krueger, referencing the team’s midseason coaching change and its multiple injured players. “I’m like, ‘wow, we have actually had to go through a whole lot.’ And I think that just illustrates how well leaders have stepped up within the team, how well the club has done to make it such a seamless transition, to make it seem like — you know, I didn’t even think about all these things that we’ve gone through.” The Pride and the Spirit will face each other for the final trophy of the year on Saturday night in Kansas City at CPKC Stadium, at 8 p.m. ET. The game will air on CBS. (Photo: Stephen M. Dowell / Orlando Sentinel / Tribune News Service via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Alyssa Nakken, who was promoted to a full-time coaching role with the San Francisco Giants in 2020, has accepted a player development position with the Cleveland Guardians, a league source confirmed to The Athletic. Nakken’s departure from San Francisco was first reported by Steven Rissotto and confirmed by the Giants on Friday. Advertisement “We thank Alyssa Nakken for her incredible contributions to the San Francisco Giants and for trailblazing a path for women in sports,” the Giants said in a statement. “Her leadership, dedication, and passion for the game have inspired countless individuals, and her impact has been truly transformative for the Giants organization and the baseball community. As she embarks on this exciting new chapter in her career, we have no doubt that she’ll continue to inspire and achieve great things. We wish her and her family nothing but the best.” Nakken, 34, became the first woman to coach on the field in a regular-season MLB game when she filled in for first base coach Antoan Richardson after he was ejected in the third inning of a game against the San Diego Padres on April 12, 2022. She made history again in 2023 when she interviewed for the Giants’ vacant managerial position. “Manager and/or bench coach positions are two that my interests gravitate towards at this point in time,” Nakken said after coaching her first full season in 2020. After starring as a first baseman for Sacramento State’s softball team from 2009-12, Nakken joined the Giants as an intern in their baseball operations department in 2014. Nakken joined the Giants’ coaching staff full-time when Gabe Kapler was the team’s manager and also spent one season as part of Bob Melvin’s 11-person coaching staff. Other coaches who’ve left the Giants this offseason include hitting coaches Justin Viele and Pedro Guerrero (who went to the Texas Rangers and Miami Marlins, respectively) and pitching coach Bryan Price.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Former Temple player Hysier Miller under federal investigation for alleged point shaving: Report,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938822/2024/11/21/temple-point-shaving-investigation-fbi/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 01:07:28 GMT","The NCAA is also investigating the situation, which stemmed from unusual wagering activity on a Temple-UAB game last March.","NCAAM Last March, a gambling monitoring service flagged unusual wagering activity in a men’s college basketball game between Temple and UAB. Now, federal authorities are investigating whether former Temple guard Hysier Miller bet on his games and purposely altered the outcome, ESPN reported Thursday, citing sources with direct knowledge. Advertisement The NCAA is also investigating the situation. Miller, Temple’s leading scorer last season, transferred to Virginia Tech in April but was dismissed from the team on Oct. 23. The university stated Miller was dismissed from the program due to “circumstances prior to his enrollment at Virginia Tech.” Miller’s attorney, Jason P. Bologna, told The Athletic that Miller “fully cooperated” with the NCAA’s investigation. He declined to comment on the FBI investigation. “He sat for a five-hour interview and answered every question the NCAA asked,” Bologna said in an email. “He also produced every document the NCAA requested. Hysier did these things because he wanted to play basketball this season, and he is devastated that he cannot.” Temple President John Fry said in a letter to the university community Thursday that the school has not received requests for information from state or federal law enforcement but would “cooperate fully should we be contacted.” Fry said Temple has “been fully responsive and cooperative with the NCAA since the moment we learned of the investigation.” “We are aware of the deeply concerning allegations of sports wagering last season,” a Temple spokesperson said in a statement. “We take seriously the integrity of intercollegiate athletics as well as the education and well-being of our student-athletes. Temple is committed to doing the right thing no matter the circumstances.” The NCAA declined to comment. The FBI did not confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation, and did not comment further. The unusual wagering was first flagged by U.S. Integrity, a service that works with major sports leagues and sportsbooks. The company notified its customers that a betting line jumped considerably in the hours leading up to the Temple-UAB game on March 7. A message left with U.S. Integrity was not immediately returned. Advertisement UAB was initially a 2.5-point favorite on the morning of the game, and the line moved to 8 points before eventually settling at 7, according to BetQL, a website that tracks consensus line movement. UAB won the game, 100-72. When contacted last March, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board told The Athletic that it was “reviewing the matter in regards to any impact in Pennsylvania.” Miller did not miss any games because of the matter last season. “Hysier has overcome more adversity in his 22 years than most people face in their lifetime,” Bologna, his attorney, said. “He will meet and overcome whatever obstacles lay ahead.” (Photo of Hysier Miller (No. 3): Bob Levey / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Brock Purdy limited with shoulder injury, status for 49ers vs. Packers in question",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5939248/2024/11/21/brock-purdy-49ers-shoulder-injury/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 00:44:20 GMT",Purdy took a hit to the shoulder during Sunday’s loss to the Seattle Seahawks was limited in Wednesday and Thursday's practices.,"NFL SANTA CLARA, Calif. – Brock Purdy missed all but the early portion of Thursday’s practice due to a sore throwing shoulder, raising the possibility he could miss his first-ever start due to injury since taking over as 49ers quarterback in 2022. Purdy took a hit to the shoulder during Sunday’s loss to the Seattle Seahawks. He did not mention it after the game and it was hard to tell if it bothered him during the contest. He completed 75 percent of his throws but did not attempt any passes beyond 20 yards. Kyle Shanahan said the lack of a deep passing game was due to the Seahawks’ two-deep coverage that encouraged shorter attempts. Advertisement “In terms of his throws, I didn’t see anything that looked any different and he didn’t complain about that in any way to me,” Shanahan said Thursday on his weekly radio interview on KNBR. Purdy was limited in Wednesday’s light practice, going through the motions alongside the rest of the quarterbacks but never actually throwing the ball. He was officially limited in Thursday’s session, too, although his practice was restricted to a few short throws before disappearing into the team’s weight room. “He didn’t do as much yesterday (and) did a little bit more today, but by no means was he doing his normal workload,” Shanahan said. “(He) went out there and did a little bit and went back in about halfway through and rested his arm up and just continued to get his rehab. Hopefully it will be feeling great on Sunday.” Purdy also did not speak to reporters after Thursday’s practice, the slot when the 49ers’ starting quarterback usually takes the podium. The 49ers said the starting quarterback – whoever he is – will talk on Friday. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. Purdy has suffered several injuries since coming in for injured Jimmy Garoppolo in Week 13 two seasons ago. He hurt his ribs in the next game, notably didn’t practice during the week, then gritted his way through a Thursday night game in Seattle. He tore an elbow ligament in the NFC Championship game that season but came back earlier than expected and started the 2023 opener in Pittsburgh. He suffered a concussion in a Week 7 loss in Minnesota but started the following week against the Cincinnati Bengals. The only start he’s missed was last year’s meaningless season finale, a game a number of starters sat out. Christian McCaffrey said he wasn’t alarmed that Purdy missed most of practice. “For me, I’ve never worried about who’s in, especially on Thursday in practice,” he said. “I’ve seen enough guys not practice all week and go out and have incredible games. He’ll handle his business, we’ll all handle ours and just try to focus in on playing one play at a time and being where I’m supposed to be.” Advertisement If Purdy’s not able to play Sunday in Green Bay, backup Brandon Allen would get his first start in three years. He started three games for the Denver Broncos in 2019 and five for the Bengals the following season. The last time he was on the field to begin a game was the Bengals’ 2021 season finale. He was 15 of 29 for 136 yards and one touchdown in that game. He’s 2-7 in the games he’s started. Allen declined an interview at his locker after Thursday’s practice Allen served as the 49ers’ No. 3 quarterback behind Purdy and Sam Darnold last year and has gotten on the field just once this season – for a kneel-down snap at the end of a Week 1 win over the New York Jets. Allen and newcomer Joshua Dobbs battled for the No. 2 role during training camp. Dobbs seemed to be more aggressive with his throws and was undoubtedly the more talented runner. The 49ers tapped Allen for his efficiency and familiarity with the offense. Both have served as San Francisco’s scout-team quarterback – the one who mimics upcoming opponents in practice – this season. If Allen starts, Dobbs would serve as the No. 2 quarterback in Green Bay. The 49ers also could tap rookie Tanner Mordecai, who’s on the practice squad, as the emergency third quarterback. Purdy, McCaffrey (Achilles, rest) and George Kittle (hamstring) were limited participants in Thursday’s practice. Nick Bosa (hip/oblique) and Trent Williams (ankle) were among the 49ers who didn’t practice and Shanahan said both would be game-time decisions on Sunday.

MLB News,"Dig into Santander's top suitors, contract projections & more",https://www.mlb.com/news/anthony-santander-contract-projections-predictions-during-free-agency,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 03:00:00 GMT",,"Mark Feinsand With the 2024 season behind us and the hot stove ready to burn, we're taking a closer look at some of the most prominent players eligible for free agency. Name: Anthony SantanderPosition: Right fielderTeam: Baltimore OriolesAge (as of Opening Day 2025): 302024 stats: .235/.308/.506, 44 HR, 102 RBIs, 91 R, 134 OPS+, 3.3 fWAR Eight years ago, the Orioles rolled the dice by taking Anthony Santander with the final selection in the Major League portion of the Rule 5 Draft. That gamble certainly paid off. It took a while for Santander to establish himself as a productive big-league hitter, flashing big power as a 24-year-old in 2019 with a 20-homer season in 93 games. His big breakout season came in 2022, when he belted 33 home runs in 152 games, starting a three-year run that saw him hit 105 homers while playing in more than 150 games per season. The 2024 season was his best; he finished third in the Majors with 44 home runs, driving in more than 100 runs for the first time in his career. It was fortuitous timing for the 30-year-old, who made his first All-Star team just months before hitting free agency, where he should cash in with a hefty contract this winter. Will the Orioles look to keep the slugger in Baltimore, or will there be other suitors eager to add his powerful bat to their lineups? Let’s take a look at how Santander’s offseason might play out. BLUE JAYS George Springer’s presence in right field could be a roadblock to a Santander signing, though the pair could form a right field/DH combo to make it work. Santander has also started 75 games in left field during his career – half of them as recently as 2022 – opening another possibility. Either way, the Blue Jays are in the market for a bat, making Santander a potential fit. DODGERS Los Angeles is among the teams pursuing Juan Soto, but Teoscar Hernández would appear to be the team’s Plan B. Should Hernández sign elsewhere, however, Santander would be an ideal candidate to slot into right field. METS The Mets’ pursuit of Soto will determine much of what else they do this winter, but adding an outfield bat would seem to be in the cards one way or another. Santander would be an upgrade over Starling Marte, while his signing would give the Mets protection in the event that Pete Alonso signs elsewhere. NATIONALS Washington will look for a bat to upgrade its offense this winter, and while the outfield appears to be crowded with James Wood, Jacob Young and Dylan Crews, Santander could slot in as the designated hitter while occasionally getting a turn in the outfield. Santander has also seen limited action at first base – he started seven games there for Baltimore in 2023 – so the Nats could think outside the box by moving him there. ORIOLES Baltimore’s deep core of young position players might mean the end of Santander’s time with the Orioles, but given the competitive nature of the AL East, his power bat might be difficult to replace. The Orioles figure to spend most of their free-agent dollars on pitching, but a return to Baltimore can’t be ruled out for Santander. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. PHILLIES Nick Castellanos’ name has surfaced on the trade market, which would potentially open the door for the Phillies to pursue Santander. Even if Castellanos isn’t moved, the addition of Santander would make sense, allowing Brandon Marsh to move to center field on a full-time basis or to platoon with Johan Rojas. TIGERS Detroit was one of the best stories of 2024, making a late-season run to the postseason. But the offense ranked ninth in the league in runs scored and 12th in home runs and OPS, so adding a bat would seem to be a priority this offseason. Right field featured a rotating cast of characters including Wenceel Pérez, Kerry Carpenter and Matt Vierling, but a power bat like Santander’s would add some much-needed thump to the lineup. YANKEES As is the case with nearly every other key free agent this winter, the Yankees’ interest could depend upon whether they are able to re-sign Soto. If Soto departs for another club, the Yankees will have a sizable hole in their lineup and outfield, one they could fill with the signing of Santander. The switch-hitting slugger gave the Yankees a close-up look at what he could do in the Bronx, where he posted a .936 OPS with three home runs in six games in 2024. “There’s no question that Santander is coming off the best season of his career at the most opportune time, winning his first Silver Slugger thanks to a monster power output. However, he achieved this peak at a later age than some of those current class comps, which may give teams the idea that they could get something of a discount. While the Orioles extended him the qualifying offer, I think it is much more possible that he signs a long-term deal outside of Baltimore. With 44 home runs, 102 RBIs and a 119 wRC+, Santander can land a long-term contract with an AAV of roughly $20 million. Given the Orioles' surplus in young offensive talent, it would be surprising if they signed Santander, but there should be several teams that would be willing to sign him to such a deal.” Santander’s expected home run total was 36.6, meaning that some of his 44 home runs were the result of being in the right place at the right time, hitting the ball to the right part of the ballpark. Based on some of his underlying stats (exit velocity, hard hit rate and walk rate), Santander’s 2024 actually wasn’t too much of a spike year offensively, but he’s been been below-average in OAA in five of the past six seasons, leading some to wonder whether he’s a DH in the making. Santander is looking at a potential nine-figure deal over five years, landing somewhere in the range of the five-year, $90 million contract Masataka Yoshida signed two years ago and the six-year, $125 million deal Springer signed prior to the 2021 season. The best comp might be Castellanos, who inked a five-year, $100 million deal with the Phillies before the 2022 season.",2024-11-22,0,0.55,0.45
MLB News,These 4 teams are showing the most interest in Crochet,https://www.mlb.com/news/garrett-crochet-rumors,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 15:06:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and trade rumors surrounding Garrett Crochet. Nov. 22: These teams seem most interested in CrochetWith Crochet headlining the list of potential trade candidates this offseason, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman says four clubs -- the Orioles, Red Sox, Dodgers and Phillies -- are showing the most interest in acquiring the White Sox left-hander. Heyman wrote for the New York Post that the O's and Red Sox are in prime position to strike a deal based on the position-player talent that Chicago is likely seeking in return. Of course, there's still plenty of time for another team to enter the mix, with Heyman noting that others have also expressed interest. Nov. 13: These clubs could be involved in trade market for CrochetAlthough the White Sox didn't move Crochet prior to the Trade Deadline, there appears to be little doubt about their intentions for the left-hander this offseason. ""They're going to trade him this winter,"" a rival evaluator told ESPN's Buster Olney at the GM Meetings last week. ""It's not a matter of if; it's a question of when."" Olney shed some light on Crochet's potential market in an article for ESPN+ (subscription required) on Wednesday, noting that general manager Chris Getz is looking for ""a package of prospects constructed around at least one high-ceiling youngster to anchor the deal."" Chicago's preference is for that main piece to be a position player, but the team is open to a pitcher being the centerpiece, ""depending on the depth and quality of the prospects offered."" Based on conversations with industry sources, Olney names the Phillies, Padres, Yankees, Dodgers, Braves, Orioles, Red Sox and Mets as teams that could pursue a Crochet trade. Nov. 9: Mets showing interest in trading for Crochet (report)According to a report in the New York Post, the Mets are ""discussing"" Crochet, who is one of the most likely players to be traded this offseason. It would stand to reason given that three of New York's starters from 2024 -- Sean Manaea, Jose Quintana and Luis Severino -- are free agents. Though the Mets are certainly in position to spend big this offseason, Crochet would be considerably cheaper in his remaining arbitration years than spending toward the top of the free agent pitching market. Nov. 7: Crochet garnering trade interest from many clubs, but one stands outThe White Sox held on to Crochet through the 2024 Trade Deadline when they were receiving calls from many teams interested in acquiring the fireballing left-hander. Now, an even greater number of clubs are trying to maneuver a deal for Crochet, general manager Chris Getz said during this week's General Managers Meetings. Crochet entered this season with only 73 big league innings under his belt over parts of three seasons and a lengthy injury history. But from Opening Day on, he proved he could be an ace. Crochet received his first Major League start in that season opener and proceeded to strike out eight batters and allow one run over six innings. He eventually became a first-time All-Star and ended the season with 209 strikeouts in 146 innings. Given that big jump in innings, Crochet's workload was capped over the final few months of the season. He made it through the year without a stint on the injured list. What do the White Sox want in return for Crochet, who has two years of club control remaining? Getz has made it pretty clear. ""We need to improve our offense, it’s very clear,” he told reporters Tuesday. “With any trade or free agency, we are looking for ways to improve our offense."" One team that could be a match for Chicago in a Crochet trade is the Boston Red Sox. The Red Sox have six position players on MLB Pipeline's Top 100 Prospects list, including three in the top 10. They also have a few attractive pieces already at the big league level who are not yet eligible for arbitration. That group includes first baseman Triston Casas, catcher Connor Wong and Gold Glove outfielder Wilyer Abreu. With so much high-quality position-player depth, ""there’s a widespread sense that the Sox can trade for nearly anyone,"" according to The Boston Globe's Alex Speier (subscription required). MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi said Thursday from the GM Meetings that the Red Sox are ""the team I think a lot of people around here are looking at very carefully"" regarding a Crochet trade.",2024-11-22,0,0.64,0.36
MLB News,Don't take the Judge & Ohtani Show for granted,https://www.mlb.com/news/mvps-shohei-ohtani-aaron-judge-appreciation,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 16:45:00 GMT",,"Will Leitch Surprising absolutely no one, Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge won the National League and American League MVP Awards, respectively, on Thursday night. The announcements capped two of the greatest seasons in recent baseball memory. Ohtani put up a 54 HR-59 SB season, and Judge … well, Judge may have been an even better hitter than that in 2024. There wasn’t much debate here, evidenced by a unanimous vote for both of them. It would seem that both Ohtani and Judge have secured their places in baseball history. After all, they’re the two most famous baseball players in the world right now -- you might have caught them at the World Series, don’t forget about that. This isn’t even their first go-around as MVPs: This is Ohtani’s third trophy (second in a row, and in two different leagues), and Judge’s second. And it’s not like they’re going away anytime soon, either. Ohtani is signed with the Dodgers through the 2033 season, and Judge will be in the Bronx at least through 2031. We’ll be watching them, in their current uniforms, for a while. But history has a way of playing tricks on us, and our perceptions of it. For undeniable reasons specific to each player, it seems clear, when their careers are over, that their collective counting stats – the big, round numbers that we use to identify Hall of Famers – will be smaller than we might have expected. Thus, when future generations spend the decades after they retire looking back at them on Baseball-Reference and MLB.com, they might not realize just how great these players were … because those final totals won’t necessarily pop. This isn’t a reason to downgrade their careers, of course, no matter what happens moving forward. It’s a reason to appreciate them right now -- a chance to reflect on just how good their peaks really have been, and how lucky we are to get to watch them as they reach that point. First off, Ohtani. Obviously, he is a special case. He is not only a unique player in the Majors, serving as a starting pitcher and a lineup linchpin, but his achievements are very much appreciable in the moment: He is literally the only player to have done what he is doing, at this level. But much of Ohtani’s appeal is wrapped up in that inherent risk, that tension between the miracle of what he’s doing and the fear that he won’t be able to do it forever. We have proof of that, of course: He didn’t pitch at all in 2024. It didn’t stop him from winning the MVP anyway. But is it reasonable to expect Ohtani to continue pitching for the rest of his contract with the Dodgers? Through 2033? Probably not, right? And even if he does pitch for the next half-decade or so, it’s unlikely he’ll put up enough innings for his mound numbers to ever truly blow anyone away. For all his success so far -- before a second Tommy John surgery, it must be reminded -- he has thrown only 481 2/3 innings in MLB. For perspective, that’s fewer than such luminaries as Andrew Chafin, Griffin Canning, Dakota Hudson and T.J. McFarland. He’ll throw more, but he’s not even halfway to even, like, José Ureña and Marco Gonzales. Which means it’s going to be his hitting that makes the numbers add up. There are inherent limitations there, too. Ohtani is 30 years old, turning 31 in July, and he “only” has 225 homers for his career. That’s eighth among active players to that point in their careers, just seven more than Anthony Rizzo and 10 more than Francisco Lindor. And most players don’t keep up the same pace in their 30s. While Ohtani hasn’t actually missed a lot of time at the plate to injury in recent years – he’s 15th in MLB in games played since 2021 – his two-way exploits likely do raise the risk of injuries that actually could harm his availability with the bat. That might make a milestone like 500 homers a lot more difficult to reach than it would seem right now. Judge may have even more issues, considering he’s two years older than Ohtani with a spottier health record, not to mention the challenge of being 6-foot-7 and 282 pounds. Judge didn’t even reach the Majors until he was 24 years old and won Rookie of the Year at age 25. (Here is your reminder that Juan Soto just turned 26.) That late start has always made it difficult for Judge to reach the counting stats you’d think a guy who has hit at least 58 homers twice would be able to reach. (The truncated 2020 season hurts him, and Ohtani, and everyone from this era, here as well.) Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. This means Judge has “only” 315 homers and 1,026 hits; remember how shocked everybody was when he reached the 1,000-hit mark last year? Now, obviously, Judge can pick up those homers fast, including 157 of them over the past three seasons. But those came during his early 30s, and there is much historical worry to be had over how players his size age. Are we certain he’s going to make it to 500 homers? My colleague Andrew Simon tried to figure this out in August, and one estimate, via Bill James’ Favorite Toy tool, gave Judge an 82 percent chance of reaching 500, and 37 percent chance of reaching 600. Both of those figures, frankly, strike me as a little  bit high. Either way: Judge’s number is probably going to end up lower than most people think based on his name, and reputation. If I’ve learned anything over my years of writing about baseball, it’s that the further you get away from a player’s actual career, and what you watched during it, the more you rely on that stat sheet. This isn’t a bad thing: It’s why people finally came around to appreciating Bert Blyleven and Tim Raines well after their careers ended, in a way they didn’t when those guys were playing. But it also can make it so that you forget, in the haze of statistics, just how overwhelming and dominating a player was at his peak. (It’s why everybody who watched Dale Murphy felt like they were watching a Hall of Famer when they saw him, though his career numbers didn’t end up that impressive.) Right now, it seems obvious that the best players of this era are Ohtani and Judge. But I wonder if that will be as obvious in 20 years, when all is said and done … and those career numbers fall behind those of guys like Soto, Bryce Harper, Manny Machado or whomever. That’s especially true for those who won’t remember watching Ohtani and Judge at their best. This is not to say that these are not future Hall of Famers: Ohtani and Judge clearly are. But the only way to truly appreciate how transcendent they are right now is to watch them right now. Because ultimately, the career stats won’t do as much as they should to remind us. These are otherworldly baseball players, at their peak, right now. We’re lucky to get to see it. We may be the only ones who, in the end, truly understand it.",2024-11-22,0,0.59,0.41
MLB News,"Unanimous MVPs Judge, Ohtani made it a no-doubter with historic seasons",https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-mvp-award-winners-2024,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 00:38:00 GMT",,"Anthony Castrovince They weren’t just the two best seasons of their time but two of the absolute best seasons of all-time. Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge left absolutely no doubt as to how the Baseball Writers’ Association of America MVP honors would turn out, so all that was left Thursday night on MLB Network was to make it official. And unanimous. Ohtani, the two-way wonder who was relegated by elbow surgery to designated hitter duties in his first season with the World Series champion Dodgers, claimed his third MVP and his first in the NL with a 50-homer, 50-steal season that was truly one of a kind. He joined Hall of Famer Frank Robinson as the only players to win MVP in both leagues. “I’m just representing the Dodgers,” Ohtani said through interpreter Matt Hidaka. “It was a complete team effort. I wouldn’t have been able to receive this award if it weren’t for my teammates. If we didn’t play as a team, we would not have gotten to the playoffs or won the World Series. So I take this as representing a team, receiving this award.” And Judge, the mammoth Yankee captain, fell just shy of his AL single-season home run record but nevertheless had one of the greatest offensive performances ever by a right-handed hitter, en route to his second AL MVP in the last three years. “I was talking to [two-time MVP Bryce] Harper a lot this season and telling him, ‘Man, I’m going to try to catch up to you in these MVPs here,’” Judge joked. “It means a lot [to win another]. Just a lot of hard work in the offseason, during the season, the ups and downs throughout it. Just the constant support from my teammates, the fans in New York, just everybody to help me get to this spot.” Both players received first-place votes on all 30 ballots submitted in their respective leagues, marking the second straight year both MVPs were unanimous after it had never happened prior to 2023. Royals shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. finished second in the AL, with Judge’s Yankees teammate (and now free agent) Juan Soto in third. Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor was second in the NL, with Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte in third. The performances of these two likely future Hall of Famers in the regular season were overwhelming. Yes, Lindor took on the leadoff spot and put the Mets on his back, bound for October, by rattling off 33 homers and 29 steals to go with his dynamic defense at short. And yes, Witt was the most well-rounded player in MLB this year, also playing dazzling defense at the premier position while becoming the first player in history with at least 30 homers, 40 doubles, 10 triples and 25 steals in a season. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. But those elite players with elite outcomes had to settle for second because of what Ohtani and Judge accomplished. Unable to pitch for 2024, Ohtani committed to intense speed-training exercises, upped his aggression and wound up swiping 59 bags in 63 attempts. That he did so while banging out 54 homers, 38 doubles and seven triples – notching only 98 singles among his 197 hits – made the feat all the more astounding. “I didn’t have specific number goals,” said Ohtani, “but I did want to improve my stolen base numbers.” It’s not just that Ohtani became the first player in history to post a 50-50 season. And it’s not just that he reached that threshold with one of the most otherworldly individual games the sport had ever seen (a 6-for-6, 10-RBI, three-homer, two-double, two-steal rampage in Miami on Sept. 19). It’s that, prior to this Ohtani outcome, no one had ever reached 50 homers in a season while also stealing more than 24 bags. And Ohtani became just the third player to finish in the top two in MLB in both homers and steals, joining Deadball Era icons Honus Wagner (1908) and Ty Cobb (1909). So now the 30-year-old Ohtani, who slashed .310/.390/.646, makes history of a different sort, becoming the first full-time DH to win the MVP. Of course, to label a man who can steal that many bags and who next season will resume a pitching career that so far has resulted in a 38-19 record, 3.01 ERA and 142 ERA+ merely a “hitter” is a misnomer to begin with. “I obviously don’t go into the season trying to strive to get the MVP Award,” said Ohtani, who this year was joined on the announcement show not just by his popular dog, Decoy, but also by his wife, Mamiko Tanaka. “I was focused on being one of the guys with a new team, the Dodgers, and I wanted to embrace the fans, as well, and let them know who I was.” Ohtani is the Dodgers’ 13th MVP and first since Cody Bellinger in 2019. He’s the sixth player to win an MVP with multiple franchises, joining Harper, Alex Rodriguez, Barry Bonds, Robinson and Jimmie Foxx, and just the second to win one in both leagues (Robinson). He’s also the first player since Miguel Cabrera (2012-13) to win an MVP in back-to-back years. Ohtani had already been the first player to win multiple unanimous MVPs (in 2021 and 2023 with the Angels). Now, he’s done it again. And yet, as amazing as Ohtani’s offensive performance was, Judge’s was superior in multiple key metrics. Judge hit an MLB-leading 58 homers, four shy of the AL record he had set in 2022. He drove in an MLB-best 144 runs, along with the leads in game-winning RBIs (24) and go-ahead RBIs (32). He drew an MLB-best 133 walks. He had an MLB-best .458 on-base percentage, .701 slugging percentage and 1.159 OPS. His fWAR (11.2) and bWAR (10.8) were both at the top of the list. But the best way to sum up the 32-year-old Judge’s season was his 223 OPS+. That’s a metric adjusted for the offensive environment in a given year, and this is a year in which power and average were down across the board. Per OPS+, Judge’s batting performance was 123% better than the league average – the highest by a right-handed hitter in the AL or NL in the modern era, which dates back to 1901. Judge was quick to cite batting behind Soto as a big reason for his season. “Seeing the pitches,” he said. “We all know this guy’s gonna be on base 50 percent of the time, if not more. But just, the quality of every single at-bat. It didn’t matter if he went up there and flew out or struck out. If you’re going to strike out Juan Soto, it’s going to take 10-12 pitches to get it by him. It’s impressive. I get to see how the pitcher’s feeling today, what pitches are working, is he going to the two-seamer now, is he trying to go to his wipeout slider now. So it just gave me a better picture of what to expect stepping into the box.” That the 6-foot-7, 282-pound Judge did this while patrolling center field for a Yankees team in need makes the offensive might all the more meaningful. “The team, we needed somebody to play center, and I felt it was best for the team,” Judge said. “So I said, ‘I’ll play center field, as long as you guys need me out there. I’ll play left, I’ll play right. Whatever gives us the best lineup.’ Especially when you go out and get a guy like Juan Soto, the most important thing is making sure he’s comfortable. And when he’s comfortable, you can see what he does and what he did this year.” Judge marks the 22nd Yankees MVP since the BBWAA began voting on the award in 1931, the most of any team. He’s only the second Yankee to win the award unanimously, joining Mickey Mantle (1956). Though their clash in the Fall Classic did not result in the individual performances people anticipated, Judge and Ohtani had done plenty to get their clubs to October in the first place. They both made history, and they both made it easy on the MVP voters.",2024-11-22,1,0.48,0.52
MLB News,This 2-time All-Star could reunite with Hinch in Detroit (report),https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-rumors-trades-and-signings,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 02:27:00 GMT",LATEST FREE AGENT & TRADE RUMORS,"MLB.com We're keeping track of all the latest free agent and trade rumors. The Tigers are interested in free-agent third baseman Alex Bregman, according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman in an article for the New York Post. Heyman adds that the only club Bregman has played for in the Major Leagues, the Astros, have submitted a contract offer in an effort to re-sign the two-time All-Star, and that the Red Sox have ""inquired and could be a fit for Bregman if they move Rafael Devers to first."" If Bregman was to sign with Detroit, it would reunite him with his former manager in Houston, A.J. Hinch. Hinch was the manager when Bregman and the Astros won the franchise's first World Series title in 2017. The demand is high, but the supply is low. That's the story for teams looking to sign a frontline starting pitcher in free agency this offseason. The best arms available are Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell and Max Fried. You could add Japanese right-hander Roki Sasaki to that group, but he hasn't yet been posted for MLB teams, so he's not officially a free agent at the moment. As for those other three pitchers, at least seven teams have been connected to them in recent reports. Dodgers: The reigning World Series champions are one of the teams that have met with Snell already but are also talking to Burnes and Fried, according to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required). They ""like Snell a lot,"" per MLB Network insider Jon Heyman. The Dodgers are considered among the favorites for Sasaki, but Heyman reported last week in the New York Post that L.A. will try to sign one of the Big Three even if they land the Japanese phenom. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi sees the Dodgers as one of the two leading candidates for Burnes. Red Sox: Like the Dodgers, the Red Sox have met with Snell already but are keeping their options open with Burnes and Fried, Rosenthal reports. Orioles: With Burnes a free agent after spending 2024 with Baltimore, Orioles general manager Mike Elias said Friday that the team’s new ownership group has given him the flexibility to engage with the top starting pitchers on the free-agent market. Rosenthal hears the team is currently more focused on Snell and Fried, both of whom could have lower price tags than Burnes. Blue Jays: Rosenthal reports that Toronto is pursuing Burnes, Snell and Fried. Yankees: Heyman directly mentioned the Yankees' interest in Snell, but he added that New York's willingness to go after one of the top starters may be contingent on whether it can re-sign Juan Soto. Heyman said that if Soto doesn't come back to the Bronx, the Yankees ""will be more focused"" on these aces. But if Soto is back in pinstripes, Heyman thinks the Yankees won't spend the money necessary to get one of the top pitchers. Giants: Heyman said he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if Snell returns to San Francisco after the left-hander enjoyed his time there during the 2024 season. Mets: Another club that's focused on Soto, the Mets will also be looking to upgrade a rotation that could lose Sean Manaea, José Quintana and Luis Severino in free agency. Although outfielder/first baseman Cody Bellinger exercised his player option for 2025, it’s not a guarantee that he’ll be with the Cubs on Opening Day. According to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required), rival executives say that the Cubs want to trade the 29-year-old. More > Juan Soto's decision on where to sign this offseason is the most anticipated in baseball, and according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, ""the feeling around the industry"" is that the decision could be made before the annual Winter Meetings get underway in Dallas on Dec. 9. Soto reportedly has already met with the Blue Jays, Red Sox, Mets and incumbent Yankees. Yanks owner Hal Steinbrenner confirmed Wednesday that the club had a ""good meeting"" with Soto. Soto has a couple more meetings reportedly on tap. He is scheduled to meet with the Dodgers next. And according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman, the Phillies plan to meet with Soto at some point, though nothing has been scheduled yet. Per Heyman, it's believed that no offers have been made to Soto yet. You can follow the latest rumblings on Soto here. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said Wednesday that Sasaki is expected to be part of the 2025 international amateur signing class, which means the Japanese right-hander likely won't sign with a club before Jan. 15. ""It looks like ... the signing will happen in the new pool period,"" Manfred said via The Athletic's Evan Drelich. More > While this year’s free-agent class has its share of attractive options with significant closing experience, including Tanner Scott, Kenley Jansen, Blake Treinen, Clay Holmes, Carlos Estévez, Kirby Yates and David Robertson, MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi expects the closer trade market to be active as well. Morosi has heard that the Brewers’ Devin Williams, the Cardinals’ Ryan Helsley and the Nationals’ Kyle Finnegan are available. Morosi even went as far as predicting that at least two of those closers will be traded before the end of the calendar year. Williams, Helsley and Finnegan all have one year of team control remaining and could be more cost effective than signing a closer in free agency. The latter two are perhaps more likely to be dealt, given the Cardinals and Nationals are both building for the future, but a Williams trade can’t be ruled out. Teams with serious postseason aspirations typically aren’t looking to trade away top stars from their Major League roster, but the Brewers have shown a willingness to be proactive in the past with players nearing free agency, trading Josh Hader in 2022 and Corbin Burnes last offseason. Williams could be next, though figuring out when to do it is a tough call for Milwaukee. A rival executive who spoke with MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand at the GM Meetings suggested that the Brewers would be better off waiting until the summer to put Williams on the trade block to maximize the return. However, it's possible they will look to deal Williams this offseason to avoid a repeat of the Willy Adames situation. Milwaukee didn’t trade Adames at the Deadline this past summer because it was leading the NL Central, and now the shortstop can depart as a free agent, leaving the club with nothing but a Draft pick in return. Thirteen players were tendered a qualifying offer (a one-year, $21.05 million deal for 2025) this offseason, but Reds right-hander Nick Martinez was the only one who accepted prior to Tuesday's 4 p.m. ET deadline. The following 12 players rejected the qualifying offer and will remain free agents: Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Since the system was implemented in 2012, only 14 players to receive a QO have accepted it. You can read more about year's QO decisions here. Roki Sasaki isn't the only marquee Japanese pitcher who is expected to make the jump to the Majors this offseason. The 35-year-old Tomoyuki Sugano doesn't possess Sasaki's top-notch velocity, but as a two-time winner of the Sawamura Award -- the Japanese equivalent to the Cy Young Award -- Sugano should have his fair share of suitors. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi has identified one team to watch for Sugano: the Angels. More > The Orioles could be one of the big players on the free-agent market for starting pitchers in their first offseason under their new ownership group. General manager Mike Elias said Friday that the Orioles have ""engaged"" in conversations with high-end starting pitchers in free agency. ""We are looking at the whole menu, the whole spectrum and I credit the ownership change toward putting us in a position to do that,"" Elias said. The highest of the high-end starters on the open market is Corbin Burnes, and the Orioles would welcome his return to Baltimore, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan (subscription required). The Orioles also have been linked to left-handed ace Max Fried. Additionally, Baltimore is among a host of clubs interested in acquiring White Sox southpaw Garrett Crochet via trade. However, given all of the young talent they have traded in the past year, The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required) hears that the O's are more focused on the free-agent market right now. Yankees broadcaster Michael Kay said on his radio program on Monday that according to a source, Mets owner Steve Cohen is willing to beat any other club's offer to Juan Soto by $50 million. More > MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reports in an article for the New York Post that the Yankees met with superstar slugger Juan Soto in Southern California on Monday as they look to retain him after he helped lead them to the World Series. More > According to Ken Rosenthal and C. Trent Rosecrans of The Athletic (subscription required), the Royals and Reds are discussing a trade that would involve right-handed starter Brady Singer going to Cincinnati in return for infielder Jonathan India. However, sources told The Athletic that a trade involving Singer and India was not close on Saturday and is just one of several possibilities both teams are considering. Singer is reportedly drawing interest from other clubs while India is just one of the hitters the Royals are targeting. Singer and India were college teammates at the University of Florida and 2018 first-round MLB Draft picks by their current clubs. Singer is coming off a year in which he recorded a 3.71 ERA and 170 strikeouts over a career-high 179 2/3 innings. India, the 2021 National League Rookie of the Year, has been hampered by injuries during his career, but he had 15 homers and a .750 OPS in 151 games this past season. Both players are under club control through the 2026 season. The Red Sox have reportedly made their pitch -- or at least an initial one -- to Juan Soto. They are also trying to convince the top starting pitchers on the market to come to Fenway, too. ESPN's Jeff Passan said during Friday's edition of the Baseball Bar-B-Cast podcast that the Red Sox are talking to Blake Snell and Max Fried. More > Willy Adames is drawing “broad” interest across the Majors, according to MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi. While Adames’ market includes teams that have an opening at shortstop, there are also a number of clubs eyeing him as a third baseman. More > With Max Fried and Charlie Morton both free agents, adding rotation help is a priority for the Braves this offseason. Nathan Eovaldi ranks near the top of Atlanta’s wish list (per a source), but he isn’t the only free-agent starter the team is said to be considering, as MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi hears the Braves also have interest in Walker Buehler. Returning from his second Tommy John surgery, Buehler struggled to the tune of a 5.38 ERA over 16 starts this past season. However, he finished the year on a high note, tossing 10 straight scoreless innings in the postseason and closing out the Dodgers’ title-clinching win over the Yankees in Game 5 of the World Series. Buehler, 30, was one of baseball’s top starters from 2018-21, recording a 2.82 ERA (146 ERA+) with 620 strikeouts and 137 walks in 564 innings. Atlanta could be an attractive landing spot for Buehler in more ways than one. The right-hander has ties to two nearby states, as he was born in Kentucky and attended Vanderbilt in Tennessee. Buehler also just watched the Braves have success with another reclamation project, Chris Sale. Atlanta acquired Sale from the Red Sox last offseason after several injury-plagued seasons. The lefty stayed healthy in 2024 and is the overwhelming favorite to win the National League Cy Young Award. In addition to their interest in Eovaldi and Buehler, the Braves have been linked to White Sox lefty Garrett Crochet on the trade market, though it's unclear if they have enough prospect capital to swing a trade. Fried is still a possibility, too, but paying top dollar for free agents is not part of president of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos’ typical M.O. MLB Trade Rumors predicts Fried will sign a six-year, $156 million contract, compared to one year, $15 million for Buehler and two years, $44 million for Eovaldi. The Dodgers are viewed as one of the top contenders to sign Japanese right-hander Roki Sasaki once he is posted by his Nippon Professional Baseball team, the Chiba Lotte Marines. However, The Athletic's Jim Bowden (subscription required) doesn't see it that way. Based on his conversations with league sources, Bowden thinks it's ""unlikely"" Sasaki will sign with the Dodgers. And Bowden mentioned a few reasons why. More > Although the Yankees are going to make a strong effort to bring back Juan Soto, there’s a real chance the superstar outfielder signs elsewhere, which means New York needs to have a backup plan in place. That backup plan appears to have no limits. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Thursday in the New York Post that the Yankees are ""in on everyone."" One day earlier, during his live chat for Bleacher Report, Heyman was a little more specific on which non-Soto players the Yanks might target. More > The Phillies sign Alex Bregman. That is the prediction of one rival evaluator to ESPN's Buster Olney. The Phillies don't have an opening at third base right now, but they could create one by dealing Alec Bohm, who is on the trade block, per ESPN's Jeff Passan (subscription required). Bohm and Bregman had similar offensive production this year (the former had a 117 OPS+ while the latter had a 118) and both were plus defenders according to outs above average. However, Bregman, a 2024 Gold Glover, has a much longer track record of stellar defense at the hot corner. His has 28 OAA for his career at the position while Bohm has minus-8. Bregman would also bring a large dose of World Series experience to a club that has been thwarted in the postseason in recent years and hasn't won it all since 2008. The Astros have made it clear that re-signing Bregman is their biggest priority of the offseason, but he isn't expected to make his decision any time soon. MLB.com's Mark Feinsand said during a Reddit AMA on Tuesday that he thinks Bregman's chances of remaining with Houston are 50/50. Although the White Sox didn't move Garrett Crochet prior to the Trade Deadline, there appears to be little doubt about their intentions for the left-hander this offseason. ""They're going to trade him this winter,"" a rival evaluator told ESPN's Buster Olney at the GM Meetings last week. ""It's not a matter of if; it's a question of when."" Olney shed some light on Crochet's potential market in an article for ESPN+ (subscription required) on Wednesday, noting that general manager Chris Getz is looking for ""a package of prospects constructed around at least one high-ceiling youngster to anchor the deal,"" with a preference for that main piece to be a position player. Based on conversations with industry sources, Olney names the Phillies, Padres, Yankees, Dodgers, Braves, Orioles, Red Sox and Mets as teams that could pursue a Crochet trade. You can follow the latest rumblings on Crochet here. ESPN's Jeff Passan breaks down the markets for the key free agents and trade targets in his 2024-25 offseason preview (subscription required). Here's what he's reporting on potential landing spots for some of the top hitters and pitchers available: FA hitters FA pitchers Trade market The players Passan cites as potentially being available on the trade market this winter include: Pitchers -- White Sox ace Garrett Crochet, Brewers closer Devin Williams, Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley, Cardinals right-hander Sonny Gray, Mariners right-hander Luis Castillo, D-backs left-hander Jordan Montgomery, Rockies reliever Justin Lawrence Position players -- Cubs second baseman Nico Hoerner and outfielder Cody Bellinger, Phillies third baseman Alec Bohm, Cardinals third baseman Nolan Arenado, Guardians first baseman Josh Naylor, Rays second baseman Brandon Lowe and first baseman Yandy Díaz, Giants first baseman LaMonte Wade Jr., Rockies second baseman Brendan Rodgers According to a report from USA Today’s Bob Nightengale, Christian Walker is a popular name on the free-agent market, with at least six teams planning to “aggressively pursue” the first baseman. Walker received a qualifying offer from the D-backs, but he will likely decline it. Nightengale names the Yankees, Mets and Nationals as teams that are expected to join Arizona in pursuit of Walker, who should come with a lower price tag than that of fellow free-agent first baseman Pete Alonso, given the age disparity between the two players. (Walker is four years older.) The Yankees and Mets are also two of the top contenders for Juan Soto, the No. 1 free agent on the market, but both clubs need to address first base as well. With his expected price tag, signing Walker likely wouldn't impact either team's pursuit of Soto, who is headed for one of the largest contracts in MLB history. Walker doesn’t have quite the same power as Alonso, but he’s no slouch with the bat, having recorded 95 homers and an .813 OPS over the past three seasons. In that same time, Alonso has produced 120 homers and an .826 OPS. Walker, meanwhile, is a far better defender, winning three straight Gold Gloves and leading his position with +38 Outs Above Average since the beginning of 2022. Alonso has produced -17 OAA in that span. In addition to the teams Nightengale mentioned, the Astros, Twins, Mariners, Cardinals and Padres could also be involved in the first-base market to some extent.",2024-11-22,1,0.4,0.6
MLB News,10 players who might join free-agent pool soon,https://www.mlb.com/news/non-tender-candidates-2024-2025-mlb-free-agents,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 03:00:00 GMT",,"Thomas Harrigan Friday at 8 p.m. ET marks the deadline for teams to “tender” a contract for the 2025 season to players who are under club control. These are players on the 40-man roster who have not accrued enough service time to become eligible for free agency. If the club opts not to do so, it “non-tenders” the player, who becomes a free agent and then can sign with any of the 30 teams. Some notable players who were non-tendered after the 2023 deadline include Brandon Woodruff (Brewers), Jacob Stallings (Marlins), Tim Hill (Padres), Osvaldo Bido (Pirates) and Spencer Turnbull (Tigers). All moved on to join other teams except Woodruff, who re-signed with Milwaukee on a two-year deal in February while rehabbing from right shoulder surgery. With input from MLB.com executive reporter Mark Feinsand, here is a list of some of the more interesting non-tender candidates to watch ahead of Friday’s deadline. Griffin Canning, SP, BravesThe Braves acquired Canning from the Angels in the Jorge Soler trade on Oct. 31, but that swap was more about getting Soler’s contract off the books than anything else. After recording a 5.19 ERA with a 1.97 K/BB ratio over 171 2/3 innings in 2024, Canning is not a lock to be tendered a contract by the Braves in his final year of arbitration eligibility. Dylan Carlson, OF, RaysOnce a highly touted prospect with the Cardinals, Carlson finished third in the National League Rookie of the Year voting in 2021, but he hasn’t been able to replicate that success, slashing .225/.309/.341 (84 OPS+) over the past three years. Carlson’s time with St. Louis came to an end in '24 when he was traded to the Rays for veteran reliever Shawn Armstrong in July. He ended up with a career-low .563 OPS and -1.2 WAR (per Baseball-Reference) between the Cardinals and Rays. Dane Dunning, SP/RP, RangersAfter leading the Rangers in innings (172 2/3) and posting a 3.70 ERA in 2023, Dunning had a rocky '24 campaign. The 29-year-old made multiple trips to the injured list with a right shoulder issue, lost his rotation spot in June and was optioned to Triple-A in August. All told, he made 26 appearances (15 starts) on the year and had a 5.31 ERA. Trent Grisham, OF, YankeesGrisham played sparingly after being traded from the Padres to the Yankees in the Juan Soto blockbuster last December, amassing just 209 plate appearances in 2024. The 28-year-old is a superb defender with two Gold Glove Awards on his resume, but he has slashed .191/.298/.353 (84 OPS+) over the past three seasons. Austin Hays, OF, PhilliesIn need of more right-handed thump in their outfield this past summer, the Phillies swung a Trade Deadline deal with the Orioles for Hays, who hit 54 home runs across 2021-23. The move didn’t work out, however, as Hays recorded only two homers with a .672 OPS over 22 games in a Philadelphia uniform. That said, he still finished with an OPS+ over 100 (101) for the fourth straight year. Jordan Romano, RP, Blue JaysRomano had an excellent run as the Blue Jays’ closer from 2021-23, collecting 95 saves in that span while posting a 2.37 ERA with an 11.1 K/9. But the 2024 campaign was a different story for the 31-year-old, who recorded a 6.59 ERA over 15 appearances before undergoing season-ending arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow in July. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Patrick Sandoval, SP, AngelsSandoval was one of the Angels’ best starters in 2022, recording a 2.91 ERA with a 9.1 K/9 over 27 starts, but he struggled over the past two seasons (4.45 ERA, 4.4 BB/9) before undergoing Tommy John surgery with an internal brace in June. The lefty could miss most of 2025. Leody Taveras, OF, RangersTaveras established himself as the Rangers’ everyday center fielder in 2023, finishing the regular season with 2.6 bWAR and a 101 OPS+ and starting all 17 playoff games during the team's run to a World Series championship. He received regular playing time again in 2024 but produced just 0.5 WAR and an 84 OPS+, putting the 26-year-old’s future with the team in question. Ramón Urías, INF, OriolesUrías has been a useful player for the Orioles during his five-year career, winning a Gold Glove Award at third base in 2022 and hitting .262 with 39 homers, a .736 OPS and a 108 OPS+ over 429 games. However, the O's glut of infielders could make Urías and/or Jorge Mateo expendable, with Gunnar Henderson, Jordan Westburg, Ryan Mountcastle, Jackson Holliday and Coby Mayo all on the roster. Mike Tauchman, OF, CubsTauchman’s discerning eye has helped him reach base at a .360 clip for the Cubs over the past two seasons, but he doesn’t offer much beyond that. The Cubs also aren’t lacking in outfield options, with Cody Bellinger, Ian Happ, Seiya Suzuki and Pete Crow-Armstrong all in the mix for playing time.",2024-11-22,1,0.46,0.54
MLB News,What Siri will bring to the Mets in 2025,https://www.mlb.com/news/jose-siri-brings-defense-speed-to-mets-outfield,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 16:37:51 GMT",,"Anthony DiComo This story was excerpted from Anthony DiComo’s Mets Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. NEW YORK -- In what’s been a relatively quiet start to the offseason across the Majors, the Mets completed one of the splashier moves to date in acquiring outfielder Jose Siri from the Rays for reliever Eric Orze. In today’s newsletter, I’ll break down why the Mets made this trade and what Siri brings to the team. What sort of player is Siri? He’s an outfielder with glaringly obvious strengths and weaknesses. In center field, Siri is a bona fide star defender. He rated in the 99th percentile of outfield range this season, largely because of his speed. Statcast rated him one of MLB’s 10 fastest players, with an average competitive sprint speed of 29.9 feet per second. (The fastest Met was Luisangel Acuña at 29.5.) Siri likewise possesses one of the game’s strongest arms, topping out at 101.2 mph from the outfield. That, also, was Top 10 in the Majors. “Siri, he can electrify everybody that watches him play,” Rays president of baseball operations Erik Neander said. “He can electrify the audience by completing plays that few, if any, can. But it is certainly a boom-or-bust type of profile.” The “bust” aspect only comes into play at the plate, where Siri also possesses big tools, but an approach that has frustrated his prior three organizations. Over the last two seasons, Siri has hit 43 homers, suggesting a solid power base. He’s also struck out 300 times. Siri’s 36.9 percent K rate is easily the highest among players with at least 600 plate appearances over that stretch. How does he fit with the Mets?  Essentially, Siri is the Mets’ Harrison Bader replacement. Entering his first year of arbitration, Siri comes significantly cheaper than Bader, who made $10.5 million. He’s also under team control for three more seasons, giving the Mets center-field stability at a time when they’ve shown a clear preference for keeping Brandon Nimmo in left. That’s unlikely to change for the rest of Nimmo’s career. If the Mets land Juan Soto in free agency, Siri’s playing time will suffer, since Tyrone Taylor would receive most of his reps in center. If not, Siri figures to start the bulk of games at that position, with Taylor playing more frequently in right. Starling Marte could spend quite a bit of time at DH depending upon how the rest of the roster shakes out. Since arriving in New York, president of baseball operations David Stearns has made team defense a focus. Siri clearly adds to that. Why would the Rays let Siri go? Neander would never say this out loud, but small-market teams like the Rays routinely trade players once their salaries start increasing, which is exactly what’s happening with Siri. MLB Trade Rumors projects him to make $2.3 million next season, or about triple what he earned this year. Rather than pay Siri that money, the Rays are going with the younger, cheaper Jonny DeLuca in center. Siri also carries something of a checkered reputation, taking criticism from his former manager Dusty Baker for admiring a homer with the Astros in 2022 and trading punches with Brewers pitcher Abner Uribe this year, among other infractions. But that wasn’t an obstacle for the Mets and their strong clubhouse culture; right now, they’re mostly interested in what Siri can do on the field.

MLB News,Here are the top 30 prospects from the 2024 Arizona Fall League,https://www.mlb.com/news/top-30-prospects-from-2024-arizona-fall-league,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 02:19:00 GMT",,"Jim Callis Though the quality of pitching in the Arizona Fall League continued to decline, the developmental circuit's best prospect did his work on the mound. Phillies right-hander Andrew Painter returned to competition after missing the entire 2023 and 2024 seasons and quickly re-established himself as the most promising young arm in the game. Painter was one of 15 Top 100 prospects to crack our AFL Top 30 prospects rankings below -- though just one of two pitchers. The Fall League featured a bumper crop of first basemen that included baseball's four best prospects at the position (Jac Caglianone, Bryce Eldridge, Nick Kurtz, Xavier Isaac) and its first Triple Crown winner ever (Josue Briceño). As usual, our evaluations are based more on long-term potential than AFL performance, though both are considered. We also solicited opinions from scouts who monitor the league. More on the Arizona Fall League:• Complete coverage | All-AFL Team | Award winners 1. Andrew Painter, RHP, Glendale (Phillies No. 2/MLB No. 32)Bouncing back from Tommy John surgery in July 2023, Painter won AFL Pitcher of the Year honors after working 15 2/3 innings and placing second in the league in WHIP (0.89) and third in ERA (2.30). He battled his fastball command at times but showed the ability to miss bats and get chases with all four of his pitches: a heater that averaged 97 mph and touched 100, an upper-80s slider/cutter, a low-80s curveball and a low-90s changeup. 2. Chase DeLauter, OF, Surprise (Guardians No. 2/MLB No. 41)DeLauter also ranked second on this list a year ago and continued to show an uncommon combination of size (6-foot-4, 235 pounds), athleticism, performance and plate discipline. After missing much of the Minor League season with foot and hamstring injuries, he slashed .340/.475/.511 while playing twice a week and spending the rest of his time working with the training staff at the Guardians' base in Goodyear. 3. Leodalis De Vries, SS, Peoria (Padres No. 2/MLB No. 28)The youngest player in the league, De Vries turned 18 after the season started and became the youngest Fall Leaguer to homer since Bryce Harper in 2010. His .179/.269/.313 line belies his possibility to develop at least solid tools across the board and his 30/30 upside, though he's not a slam-dunk shortstop. 4. Ethan Salas, C, Peoria (Padres No. 1/MLB No. 19)The circuit's only other 18-year-old, Salas is unusually athletic for a catcher and looks like a future Gold Glover with advanced receiving skills and plus arm strength. He batted .228/.327/.424 with four homers in 23 games and should develop into a solid hitter with average power once he gains more strength and experience 5. Jac Caglianone, 1B, Surprise (Royals No. 1/MLB No. 17)The No. 6 overall pick in the 2024 Draft, Caglianone looked tired after playing from February through November but still homered five times in 21 games. He might have more usable power than anyone in the Minors and moves very well for a 6-foot-5, 250-pounder, but his chase rate (37 percent in the Fall League continues to bear watching). Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. 6. Colt Emerson, SS, Peoria (Mariners No. 1/MLB No. 27)The best pure hitter and the third-youngest player in the Fall League, Emerson slashed .370/.435/.537 with a league-best nine doubles in just 13 games. He has a classic left-handed stroke, makes advanced swing decisions and should grow into 20-homer power, though he'll probably move off shortstop. 7. Bryce Eldridge, 1B, Scottsdale (Giants No. 1/MLB No. 35)After rocketing from Single-A to Triple-A in his first full professional season, Eldridge batted .293/.348/.512 with two homers in 10 games before departing shortly after his 20th birthday. Few players can match his massive raw power, and his mature approach enables him to get to most of it. His first-base defense is quite rough but he has the athleticism to improve. 8. Colson Montgomery, 3B, Glendale (White Sox No. 3/MLB No. 37)No. 1 on this list a year ago, Montgomery performed better in his second Fall League stint, hitting .313/.511/.656 with three homers in 11 games. The Corey Seager comparisons persist, and while his power is real, his hitting ability isn't in the same class and he's less likely to stick at shortstop for a decade. More from MLB Pipeline:• Top 100 prospects | Stats | Video | Podcast | Complete coverage 9. Nick Kurtz, 1B, Mesa (Athletics No. 2/MLB No. 45)Kurtz might have had the best combination of swing decisions, contact and exit velocities in the 2024 Draft, where he went No. 4 overall. He slashed .353/.450/.608 after joining Mesa for the second half and was the league's best defensive first baseman. 10. Zyhir Hope, OF, Glendale (Dodgers No. 11)As one scout put it, ""How many high school guys have hit in the middle of an AFL lineup 18 months after being drafted?"" Hope hit just .228/.301/.446 but he was the Fall League's most dynamic player, with some evaluators giving him well-above-average grades for raw power, speed and arm strength. 11. Moises Ballesteros, C, Mesa (Cubs No. 4/MLB No. 44)Ballesteros' sweet left-handed swing and advanced approach have enabled him to succeed against older competition throughout his career, including batting .316/.376/.557 with five homers in 19 Fall League games. His defensive and conditioning have improved in the past two years, but scouts still wonder whether he'll be able to catch regularly in the big leagues. 12. Josue Briceño, 1B, Scottsdale (Tigers No. 9)Briceño won the Joe Black MVP award after leading the AFL in batting (.433), slugging (.867), OPS (1.376), hits (39), homers (10), RBIs (27), extra-base hits (17) and total bases (78). That might be the most impressive offensive performance in league history adding in the fact that he turned 20 just before the season started. Featuring a simple left-handed swing and gameplan, he makes repeated hard contact and doesn't try to do too much at the plate. Though he has caught in the past, the Tigers should give that up and look to maximize his bat. 13. Xavier Isaac, 1B, Mesa (Rays No. 2/MLB No. 36)That's five first basemen in the top 13 if you're counting, and Isaac smoked balls harder than most Fall Leaguers despite being just 20 years old. He did post the highest strikeout rate (40 percent) in the league and will need to do a better job of catching up to high fastballs to tap into his power potential. 14. Jett Williams, SS/OF, Scottsdale (Mets No. 2/MLB No. 52)Williams could be a top-of-the-lineup catalyst with his patient approach, sneaky pop and plus speed, which translated into 17 walks, seven extra-base hits and seven steals in 22 games. He could stand to be more aggressive within the strike zone and may fit better at second base or center field than shortstop. 15. Drake Baldwin, C, Peoria (Braves No. 5)Baldwin raked at a .377/.452/.491 clip before leaving to play for Team USA at the Premier12 tournament. He's a steady hitter with average power and continues to improve defensively, erasing any doubts that he can remain at catcher. 16. Thayron Liranzo, C, Scottsdale (Tigers No. 6)Evaluators ranked the catchers behind Salas in a variety of different orders. Liranzo slashed .375/.492/.667 and comes with more power but fewer bat-to-ball skills than Ballesteros and Baldwin. He has more arm strength than either, but his catching needs a lot of polish. 17. Termarr Johnson, 2B, Scottsdale (Pirates No. 3/MLB No. 75)Another Premier12 participant, Johnson remains a conundrum who hasn't approached the 70 hit grades scouts gave him in high school. His on-base ability remains a strength as he batted .250/.444/.475 with 14 walks in 11 games, but he's now more of a power-over-hit guy who's an average-at-best runner and defender. 18. Tre' Morgan, OF, Mesa (Rays No. 10)While Morgan is the top defensive first baseman in the Minors, the Rays wanted him to expand his defensive horizons with Mesa, where he looked potentially adequate in left field. He hit .338/.391/.500 and finished third with an 8 percent strikeout rate -- some scouts thought he had the best approach in the AFL -- but he'll need to prove he can get to average power. 19. Edwin Arroyo, SS, Glendale (Reds No. 3/MLB No. 65)After losing all of the 2024 season to surgery on his non-throwing shoulder, Arroyo proved he hadn't lost anything defensively while playing the best shortstop in the Fall League. His bat is more ordinary and he slashed just .253/.309/.333, but he should provide enough offense to be a big league regular. 20. Thomas Saggese, 2B, Surprise (Cardinals No. 4)While Saggese lacks a plus tool, he's a solid hitter without a glaring weakness. He finished second in the batting race at .391/.524/.594, provides gap power and his instincts enable him to play quicker than his fringy speed on the bases and in the field. 21. Kemp Alderman, OF, Peoria (Marlins No. 12)Alderman played just nine games before leaving to get married, but that was long enough to tie for second with six homers and record the highest exit velocity (119.5 mph) of the season. He earns some top-of-the-scale grades for his raw power, also offers plus arm strength and draws some Hunter Renfroe comps. 22. Alejandro Osuna, OF, Surprise (Rangers No. 16)Osuna is a polished lefty hitter with 20-homer potential and good defensive instincts, though he fits best in left field. The younger brother of former All-Star closer Roberto Osuna and the nephew of ex-big leaguer Antonio Osuna, he topped the Fall League with 22 walks in 25 games, batted .306/.438/.449 and won the Dernell Stenson Sportsmanship Award. 23. Drew Gilbert, OF, Scottsdale (Mets No. 3/MLB No. 74)Few Fall Leaguers could match the energy Gilbert brings to the park every day, though he hit just .208/.380/.403 with four homers and 17 walks in 21 games. He offers the possibility of four solid tools, though questions about whether he can get to average power limit his ceiling. 24. Denzel Clarke, OF, Mesa (Athletics No. 10)Though Clarke repeated Double-A at age 24, it's easy to dream on a 6-foot-4, 220-pound center fielder with difference-making speed and at least plus raw power. His approach has been an issue in the Minors but not in the AFL, where he slashed .382/.495/.566 with a league-best three triples. 25. Tommy Troy, 2B, Salt River (D-backs No. 5)Troy recovered from a 1-for-25 start to bat .382 the rest of the way, recapturing the line-drive hitting ability that made him the 12th overall pick in the 2023 Draft. He's definitely a second baseman and not a shortstop, with his 20/20 upside helping him to clear the offensive bar at the less challenging position. 26. Carter Jensen, C, Surprise (Royals No. 5)One of the more underrated catching prospects in the game, Jensen combines average pop with on-base ability. He led the league in on-base percentage while hitting .425/.582/.800 with four homers in 12 games and providing sound defense. 27. Creed Willems, C, Surprise (Orioles No. 22)Signed for a well-over-slot $1 million as a 2001 eighth-rounder out of a Texas high school, Willems showed some of the best raw power and arm strength in the Fall League. He slashed .338/.391/.500 with two homers in 19 games and caught better than scouts expected. 28. Robert Hassell, OF, Salt River (Nationals No. 13)The eighth overall choice in the 2020 Draft and part of the blockbuster Juan Soto trade in August 2022, Hassell stands out more for his floor than his ceiling. A line-drive hitter who provides solid speed, arm strength and defense, he slashed .281/.360/.517 with four homers and five steals in 19 games. 29. Caleb Durbin, INF/OF, Salt River (not ranked on Yankees Top 30)The best basestealer in AFL history, Durbin set league records for swipes in a game (four), season (29 in 24 games) and career (50 in 47 contests the last two years). He also batted .313/.427/.548 with five homers this fall, playing his way onto the Yankees' 40-man roster with his contact hitting ability, solid speed and defensive versatility. He fits best at second base. 30. Luis Mey, RHP, Glendale (not ranked on Reds Top 30)Another unranked prospect who earned a 40-man spot, Mey garnered Reliever of the Year accolades with a spotless 0.00 ERA, .037 average-against and a league-high six saves in as many opportunities. He threw the 34 hardest pitches recorded in the Fall League, parking at 99.5 mph with his fastball and peaking at 101.8. His seldom-used mid-80s cutter tops out at 90 mph and also misses bats.",2024-11-22,0,0.55,0.45
MLB News,"Hays to be non-tendered, become a free agent (report)",https://www.mlb.com/news/phillies-non-tender-deadline-moves-in-2024,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 19:13:49 GMT",,"Todd Zolecki PHILADELPHIA -- The Phillies needed a right-handed bat to pound left-handed pitching, so in July they traded Seranthony Domínguez to the Orioles for outfielder Austin Hays. The deal didn’t work as planned. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported on Friday afternoon that the Phillies told Hays he will be non-tendered before Friday’s 8 p.m. ET deadline, which will make him a free agent. Hays strained a left hamstring shortly after he joined the Phillies, then he missed several weeks because of a kidney infection. It sapped him of his speed and strength, and as a result he did not start Game 4 of the NL Division Series against the Mets, despite New York starting left-hander José Quintana. Hays, 29, batted .256 with two home runs, six RBIs and a .672 OPS in 22 games with the Phillies. He went 0-for-4 with three strikeouts in the postseason. The Phillies have not announced their plans for other salary-arbitration eligible players before Friday's deadline.

MLB News,"O's to non-tender Webb, settle with Rivera (sources)",https://www.mlb.com/news/orioles-non-tender-jacob-webb,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 23:04:08 GMT",,"Jake Rill BALTIMORE -- Another fairly surprising bullpen decision has been made by the Orioles. Multiple sources told MLB.com on Friday that Baltimore is planning to non-tender right-hander Jacob Webb, who has spent the past two seasons with the O’s. The club has not yet confirmed the move, which will happen prior to the 8 p.m. ET tender deadline. Webb will become a free agent a little more than two weeks after the Orioles declined the $4 million 2025 team option for left-hander Danny Coulombe, who was also a key part of the ‘pen the past two seasons. Baltimore entered Friday with 13 arbitration-eligible players, many of whom are expected to be tendered contracts. That group will include infielder Emmanuel Rivera, who has avoided arb by settling with the O’s on a $1 million contract for next season, a source told MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand. Rivera slashed .313/.370/.578 over 27 games for the Orioles in 2024. On Aug. 7, 2023, the Orioles claimed Webb off waivers from the Angels. The righty went on to post a 3.27 ERA over 25 appearances while helping Baltimore win the American League East title and finish 101-61 that season. Webb made the Opening Day bullpen in 2024, then fared even better. The 31-year-old had a 3.02 ERA and a 1.18 WHIP in 56 2/3 innings over 60 outings this year. Now, he’ll be hitting free agency, leaving the O’s with another hole to fill in their relief corps. Last year, the Orioles went to arbitration with Webb, who won his case and made $1 million during the 2024 season. MLB Trade Rumors was projecting Webb’s salary to increase to $1.7 million in arb this year.",2024-11-22,0,0.5,0.5
MLB News,Could Ichiro become the Hall of Fame's first unanimous position player?,https://www.mlb.com/news/ichiro-suzuki-s-case-for-a-unanimous-bbwaa-hall-of-fame-bid,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:31:31 GMT",,"Daniel Kramer This story was excerpted from Daniel Kramer’s Mariners Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. SEATTLE -- It’s not a matter of if Ichiro Suzuki will be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, but rather, if he’ll become the first position player to do so unanimously via the vote from the Baseball Writers’ Association of America. Suzuki was among 14 newcomers on this year’s BBWAA ballot, which was revealed earlier this week -- along with fellow Mariners icon Félix Hernández -- and will likely be a shoe-in when the results are announced on Jan. 21, live on MLB Network. But the question is whether Suzuki will be listed on each ballot, an accumulation that has eluded all 346 Hall of Famers other than Mariano Rivera, the longtime Yankees closer. Even Mariners great Ken Griffey Jr., widely considered to be among the greatest players of his era, if not all-time, was left off three of the 440 ballots in the 2016 class. Derek Jeter was the closest to the achievement but was left off one single ballot among the 397 in ‘20. There were 400 ballots sent to eligible BBWAA members for 2025. The number fluctuates each year based on criteria, specifically that voters must be active and/or honorary members who’ve been active baseball writers for at least 10 years. Last year, there were 385. Though most voters publicly reveal their ballots -- which are masterfully (though unofficially) tracked by social media personality Ryan Thibodaux -- many do not because they are permitted to keep it anonymous. Even within a massive group of journalists, it can consistently create a lack of transparency. There was notable outcry in the cases of Jeter and Griffey, but this issue goes back even further, to the likes of Babe Ruth, Willie Mays and Hank Aaron. All that is to say that it unfortunately wouldn’t be a significant shock if Suzuki is not unanimous, even if it does seem egregious if that comes to fruition. Suzuki’s numbers speak for themselves. He was a two-time American League batting champion and 10-time Gold Glove Award winner, hitting .311 with 117 homers, 780 RBIs and 509 stolen bases with the Mariners (2001-12, 2018-19), the Yankees (2012-14) and Marlins (2015-17). He had a record 262 hits in 2004. But a unanimous HOF selection should not merely consist of a player’s on-field performance, and this is where Suzuki should unquestionably shine. His influence on the game itself has been -- and remains -- global. Moreover, Suzuki exemplified excellence and professionalism, and his relentless pursuit of greatness over two decades made him a beloved figure not only in Seattle but around the world, both among fans, teammates and peers. Suzuki was also a bellwether for Japanese position players, as the first such player to be posted and signed to an MLB club -- ahead of that historic 2001 season in which he won the AL Rookie of the Year and MVP Awards -- paving the way for greats like Hideki Matsui, Nori Aoki and even Shohei Ohtani. He took great pride, but also put great pressure on himself, treating the opportunity more as a responsibility. “I felt like I really carried that on my shoulders,” Suzuki told MLB.com ahead of the 2023 All-Star Game in Seattle, through longtime interpreter Allen Turner. “Like, people are going to judge the position players of Japan from the performance that I have here in MLB. And so I really took that to heart. I just wanted to make sure that, of course, failure was not an option. But even if I just had OK numbers, that wasn't good enough.” He still has great influence on the game, too, as a special assistant to the chairman with the Mariners. He’s a regular presence at T-Mobile Park throughout the season, and has developed a special bond with the future of the franchise, Julio Rodríguez. “He's been through so many different things and I know he's such a wise man,” Rodríguez said in 2023. “And it's true. ... He's helped me out a lot."" Suzuki was a revolutionary talent who paved the way for others to follow, and he continues to give back to the game. He embodies as much of a unanimous selection as anyone who’s reached this point. “I think you can say that this is my life,” Suzuki said in that 2023 interview. “There's nothing else I can do but this so this is kind of why I'm here, why I'm alive.”",2024-11-22,0,0.52,0.48
MLB News,Witt wins '24 Heart & Hustle Award: 'Truly an honor',https://www.mlb.com/news/bobby-witt-jr-wins-heart-and-hustle-award-2024,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:20:00 GMT",,"Anne Rogers Paul Casella One day after finishing as the runner-up for the American League MVP Award, Royals superstar Bobby Witt Jr. was named the 2024 recipient of the Heart & Hustle Award on Friday morning. • All-time Heart & Hustle Award winners The honor, created by the MLB Players Alumni Association in 2005, is given annually to an active player who ""demonstrates a passion for the game of baseball and best embodies the values, spirit and traditions of the game."" The alumni committee selects one nominee from each team before the winner is determined by a vote amongst fans, alumni and active players. “Hey guys, it’s truly an honor to receive the Heart and Hustle Award,” Witt said on MLB Network in a pre-recorded message. “I just want to thank all my coaches, my teammates, the fans, my family and friends. Everyone who was involved in this season. This award means a lot to me just because it was voted on by the players and the alumni, and I’m just very thankful for everyone who voted for me. It’s truly an honor. Thank you.” Witt, who was also Kansas City's nominee in 2022 and '23, is the first Royals player to win the Heart & Hustle Award. This is just the latest honor for the 24-year-old Witt, who won his first career Gold Glove and Silver Slugger Awards earlier this offseason. Witt won the MLB batting title this season with a .332 average while posting career highs in home runs (32), RBIs (109), doubles (45), OPS (.977) and bWAR (9.4). • Ranking the top 5 moments from Witt's historic '24 season Witt also swiped 31 bases on his way to recording his second straight 30-30 season. He is one of just three active players with multiple 30-30 seasons, along with Ronald Acuña Jr. and José Ramírez -- and is the first shortstop to do so.  Witt is also the only player in AL/NL history with multiple such campaigns before his age-25 season. Thank you! @MLBPAA Truly an honor! https://t.co/MwZjZRSCyS On the field through his talent and production, as well as off the field through his work ethic and competitiveness, Witt has established himself as one of the Royals’ leaders alongside captain Salvador Perez, who often states that Witt is the best player he’s ever played with. The Royals rally around their shortstop, who took them to new heights this year by making the postseason for the first time since their 2015 World Series title. Witt has also embraced the Kansas City community as his home following the 11-year extension he signed with the Royals last offseason. This past July, Witt hosted a youth baseball clinic with 100% of the proceeds going to Answering the Call (ATC), a non-profit organization that supports first responders after severe injury or illness, on behalf of Sarah Nauser, a retired police officer battling ALS and one of the Royals’ biggest fans.",2024-11-22,1,0.34,0.66
MLB News,Ohtani's now been a unanimous MVP THREE times,https://www.mlb.com/news/shohei-ohtani-2024-nl-mvp,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 00:29:59 GMT",,"Juan Toribio LOS ANGELES -- Since coming to the Majors in 2018, Shohei Ohtani has made history at every turn. He can now add another historic accomplishment to his already decorated career. After posting the best offensive season of his career, which saw him become the first player to reach the 50-50 club, Ohtani won the third BBWAA Most Valuable Player Award of his career on Thursday, becoming the first full-time designated hitter to accomplish the feat. Ohtani, who is the first Dodger to win the award since Cody Bellinger in 2019, was chosen unanimously for the third time in his career, becoming the first player to do so. He joined Frank Robinson as the only players to win at least one MVP Award in both leagues and is the first back-to-back winner since Miguel Cabrera in 2012-13. The Japanese superstar became the sixth player to win an MVP Award with two franchises, regardless of league, since BBWAA voting began in 1931. Of those, only Barry Bonds and Ohtani have taken home the prize in their final year with one team and then in their first with a new club. “This MVP, I’m just representing the Dodgers,” Ohtani said through interpreter Matt Hidaka on the announcement show Thursday night on MLB Network. “It was a complete team effort. I wouldn’t have been able to receive this award if it weren’t for my teammates.” Fittingly, then, it was Ohtani’s teammate Clayton Kershaw who announced the award. Kershaw, who won the NL MVP in 2014, made the announcement, then congratulated Ohtani, who was all smiles amid family and friends. (Ohtani’s beloved dog, Decoy, scampered off the couch at the excitement.) En route to his third MVP, Ohtani beat out Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor, who finished second, and D-backs second baseman Ketel Marte, who finished third. After signing a historic 10-year, $700 million deal last offseason, all eyes were on Ohtani to perform. But even with the massive expectations, Ohtani was able to exceed them all in his first season with the Dodgers. As he rehabbed from a second major right elbow surgery, Ohtani put together the best offensive season of his career. Despite a slow start at the plate, Ohtani led the NL with 9.2 bWAR. He also led the NL in runs scored (134), homers (54), RBIs (130), on-base percentage (.390), slugging percentage (.646) and OPS (1.036). Ohtani, of course, also became the first player in baseball history to hit 50 or more homers and steal 50 or more bases in the same season. He accomplished that feat by delivering arguably the best single-game performance in Major League history, a 6-for-6, three-homer masterpiece against the Marlins at loanDepot park. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Though Ohtani put up otherworldly numbers, there were still questions about whether a full-time DH should win the MVP Award. In the past, it was something that was used against players in MVP discussions. Heading into September, Ohtani appeared to be in a tight race with Lindor, who was leading the Mets to a postseason berth as the everyday shortstop. But in the final month of the regular season, as the Dodgers chased down another NL West title, Ohtani saved his best for last. In the final 26 games of the regular season, Ohtani hit 10 homers, drove in 32 runs and posted a 1.225 OPS, his best mark of any month in 2024. Those numbers helped the Dodgers edge out the Padres for the division and solidified Ohtani’s place as the clear frontrunner to win his third MVP Award. “I obviously don’t go into the season trying to strive to get the MVP Award,"" said Ohtani. ""I was more focused on being one of the guys with a new team with the Dodgers. I wanted to obviously embrace the fans as well and let them learn who I was. That was my main focus.” Ohtani also played an integral part in the Dodgers’ World Series title, the first of his career. He became the first player since teammate Mookie Betts to win MVP in the same year his team won the World Series. In just about every way, Ohtani’s first season with the Dodgers was about as perfect as it gets. Ohtani hopes to continue making more history along the way. “The ultimate goal from the beginning was to win a World Series, which we were able to accomplish,” Ohtani said. “Like I said before, I receive this award on behalf of my team. The next goal is for me to do it again. So right now, I’m in the middle of rehab [from left shoulder surgery] and working out and getting stronger. “I’m looking forward to next season so we can run it back.”",2024-11-22,1,0.48,0.52
MLB News,Judge joins exalted company with 2nd MVP Award,https://www.mlb.com/news/aaron-judge-is-unanimous-2024-al-mvp,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 01:30:00 GMT","Captain joins DiMaggio, Berra, Mantle, Maris and Rodriguez in garnering multiple honors; Soto finishes third","Bryan Hoch NEW YORK -- There were some who wondered if we might ever see a better Aaron Judge season than his terrific and memorable 2022 MVP campaign, during which he eclipsed Roger Maris’ 61-year-old single-season American League home run record while seemingly singlehandedly powering his Yankees into the postseason. Then came the captain’s impressive 2024 performance. Instead of grainy black-and-white replays of Maris’ home runs, there was crystal-clear high-definition video of Judge and teammate Juan Soto -- arguably the league’s most lethal one-two offensive punch in recent memory -- performing their “Kings of New York” handshake at home plate. • All-time Most Valuable Player Award winners Many of Judge’s Major League-leading 58 homers led to cries of “M-V-P!” from adoring crowds, both home and road. That manifested on Thursday, when Judge won his second BBWAA American League Most Valuable Player Award, as announced on MLB Network. “I appreciate all the votes, all the support,” Judge said. “I honestly wouldn’t be in this position without my teammates, all the coaching we had this year. It’s such a blessing. I’ve got to thank God every day for this opportunity to be here, to wear pinstripes and do it in New York.” Judge received all 30 first-place votes, with the Royals’ Bobby Witt Jr. (30 second-place votes) finishing ahead of Soto. Since the Baseball Writers' Association of America began casting votes in 1931, Judge is the seventh Yankee to win multiple MVP Awards, joining Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Maris and Alex Rodriguez. The honor figures to be bittersweet for Judge, however, as he struggled in the postseason and committed a costly error in the decisive World Series Game 5 against the Dodgers. Judge said that falling short in the Fall Classic would “stay with me until I die,” as he has long valued team accomplishments above individual performances. But he was appreciative of the award. Another incredible season for the ages.Your 2024 American League MVP: Aaron Judge. pic.twitter.com/JXAWF0qkcu “It means a lot, a lot of the hard work in the offseason, during the season, the ups and downs throughout it,” Judge said. “Just the constant support from my teammates, the fans in New York, just everybody to help me get to this spot.” • Complete MVP vote totals Looking at Judge’s impressive .322/.458/.701 slash line, it is difficult to believe that his season got off to a slow start; he was batting .197 as late as May 2 as questions swirled. The Yankees didn’t seem concerned, with manager Aaron Boone remarking that Judge would soon catch fire. Did he ever. Judge went on to lead the Majors in homers, RBIs (144), on-base percentage, slugging percentage, OPS (1.159), walks (133), times on base (322), game-winning RBIs (24) and position player fWAR (11.2). He also became the fastest to reach 300 homers in terms of at-bats and games played. “I want to congratulate Aaron on earning this distinguished honor, and I couldn’t be happier for such an amazing person and leader,” Boone said in a statement. “After having a front-row seat for his 2022 MVP performance, I really couldn’t envision a player having a better and more complete baseball season. But that’s exactly what he accomplished in 2024. “I’m beyond fortunate to be able to manage Aaron, and I look forward to watching him further cement his legacy as one of this generation’s greatest players.” As Giancarlo Stanton remarked late in the season, it seemed at times as though Judge was “out there playing video games while all of us are out there working."" Comparing this year’s MVP campaign with his first, in ’22, his batting average was 11 points higher, his on-base percentage was 33 points higher, and his slugging percentage was 15 points higher -- all done while absorbing the increased wear and tear of playing center field regularly (105 games) to accommodate Soto’s arrival. “March and April were not my friend this year,” Judge said. “It’s just a testament to [the fact that] it’s a long season. You’re going to go through some ups and downs. It’s just about leaning on your teammates, on your family. Just put in the work and things are going to change. You can’t mope, you can’t feel sorry for yourself.” Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Judge has expressed awe at the hallowed statistical company he now keeps. For example, only he, Babe Ruth, Gehrig and Mantle have led the league in homers at least three times. Those names are littered throughout the paragraphs detailing his success; already his place in Monument Park seems all but reserved. Yet unlike in ’22, when he was asked how he might muster an encore, the ’24 showing provides an answer -- had his ’23 season not been interrupted by injury, he might be celebrating a third straight MVP. This may be considered the baseline performance expected of Judge moving forward, setting this ultimatum: Now it must translate into a World Series championship. “You’ve got to put in the work, continue to make changes, you’ve got to continue to try to improve yourself until they rip this jersey off of you,” Judge said.",2024-11-22,1,0.36,0.64
MLB News,"Every MVP Award winner ranked, 1-189",https://www.mlb.com/news/greatest-mvp-seasons-in-mlb-history-c300194658,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 00:00:00 GMT",,"Will Leitch Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani are the latest American League and National League Most Valuable Player Award winners, and they're on a vaunted list that includes Ted Williams, Barry Bonds, Mickey Mantle and … Zoilo Versalles. But not all MVP seasons are treated equally. Some MVP seasons just happen to be the best that particular year, and some can stand among the best of all time. Today, we come to you having completed a Herculean task: We come to rank every MVP season ever. Starting in 1931 -- the first year the Baseball Writers' Association of America voted on an award for both leagues -- we're looking at all 189 MVP seasons and pitting them against each other. We'll use a variety of ways to judge them, from Wins Above Replacement to historical import to the background of the quality of the league itself the year a particular player won their award. And I'm sure we'll get a bunch of them wrong. But who is the most MVPest of all the MVPs? Let's dive in. Remember: All these guys were great. There is only honor in being on this list, whatever place you finish at. • Ranking every Cy Young season | Ranking every Rookie of the Year 1. Barry Bonds, 2001 NL (Giants)Key stats: 259 OPS+, 73 HR, 177 BBThe 73 homers is probably enough for me. Is it not enough for you?Runner-up: Sammy Sosa, CHC (64 HR) 2. Bob Gibson, 1968 NL (Cardinals)Key stats: 1.12 ERA, 258 ERA+, 13 shutoutsThe pitching season by which all other pitching seasons will forever be judged.Runner-up: Pete Rose, CIN (.335 BA) 3. Barry Bonds, 2004 NL (Giants)Key stats: 263 OPS+, 232 BB, 120 IBBThis one isn't first overall only because Bonds barely played defense at all. But heavens: A .609 OBP!Runner-up: Adrian Beltre, LAD (163 OPS+) 4. Mickey Mantle, 1956 AL (Yankees)Key stats: 210 OPS+, 52 HR, 130 RBIsThis was Mantle at his absolute peak, aged 24 and perfect in every possible way.Runner-up: Yogi Berra, NYY (105 RBIs) 5. Barry Bonds, 2002 NL (Giants)Key stats: .370 BA, .799 SLG, 268 OPS+This was actually the highest OPS+ of Bonds' career.Runner-up: Albert Pujols, STL (127 RBIs) 6. Willie Mays, 1965 NL (Giants)Key stats: 185 OPS+, 52 HR, 112 RBIsNot only is it amazing that Mays put up the numbers he did this year at 34, but he also did it while revolutionizing the position defensively.Runner-up: Sandy Koufax, LAD (382 K) 7. Aaron Judge, 2024 AL (Yankees)Key stats: 58 HR, 1.159 OPS, 223 OPS+OK, so he hit four fewer homers than he did in 2022. In every other way, however, he was better in 2024. A very strong argument could be made that this was the best offensive season by a right-handed hitter, ever.Runner-up: Bobby Witt Jr., Royals (32 HR, 31 SB) 8. Aaron Judge, 2022 AL (Yankees)Key stats: 62 HR, 1.111 OPS, 211 OPS+Then again: 62 homers are 62 homers. The only difference between Judge’s two MVP seasons may end up being that he had Juan Soto hitting in front of him for one of them. (Not this one.)Runner-up: Shohei Ohtani, Angels (34 HR, 95 RBIs and 15-9, 219 K's in 166 IP) 9. Carl Yastrzemski, 1967 AL (Red Sox)Key stats: .326 BA, 193 OPS+, 44 HRActually the highest WAR on this entire list (12.4).Runner-up: Harmon Killebrew, MIN (44 HR) 10. Stan Musial, 1948 NL (Cardinals)Key stats: .376 BA, 200 OPS+, 131 RBIsMusial hit .376 and had a career high in homers.Runner-up: Johnny Sain, BSN (2.60 ERA) 11. Joe Morgan, 1975 NL (Reds)Key stats: .327 BA, 169 OPS+, 67 SBMorgan's best year, for maybe the best team of the past 50 years.Runner-up: Greg Luzinski, PHI (120 RBIs) 12. Sandy Koufax, 1963 NL (Dodgers)Key stats: 25-5, 1.88 ERA, 306 KYour grandfather will never, ever stop talking about this season.Runner-up: Dick Groat, STL (.319 BA) 13. Mickey Mantle, 1957 AL (Yankees)Key stats: .365 BA, 221 OPS+, 34 HRMantle might not have had the longevity of his peers, but no one has ever looked more physically built solely to play baseball.Runner-up: Ted Williams, BOS (.526 OBP) 14. Willie Mays, 1954 NL (Giants)Key stats: .345 BA, 175 OPS+, 41 HRThis was Mays' first year back from military service. He was not rusty.Runner-up: Ted Kluszewski, CIN (49 HR) 15. Shohei Ohtani, 2021 AL (Angels)Key stats: 46 homers, 158 OPS+, eight triples, 9-2 record, 3.18 ERA, 156 strikeouts, 1.09 WHIPPutting Ohtani’s season in context felt impossible because it literally was unprecedented. This might seem high, but it's likely to grow in stature as the years go on.Runner-up: Vladimir Guerrero Jr., TOR (48 homers, 1.002 OPS) 16. Cal Ripken Jr., 1991 AL (Orioles)Key stats: .323 BA, 34 HR, 114 RBIsRipken was credited with 11.5 WAR - the 10th best all-time. And Ripken didn't miss a game all year as his Iron Man streak chugged along.Runner-up: Cecil Fielder, DET (133 RBIs) 17. Mike Trout, 2016 AL (Angels)Key stats: 173 OPS+, 123 R, 100 RBIsHis WAR total (per Baseball Reference) was 10.5, which is the highest of any of his three MVP seasons. And surpassing 10 WAR is rare. There have been just 30 position player seasons to reach that threshold since integration (1947).Runner-up: Mookie Betts, BOS (214 H) 18. Jimmie Foxx, 1932 AL (A's)Key stats: 207 OPS+, 58 HR, 169 RBIsFoxx should probably be as household a name as Gehrig, anyway.Runner-up: Lou Gehrig, NYY (181 OPS+) 19. Ted Williams, 1946 AL (Red Sox)Key stats: .497 OBP, 215 OPS+, 123 RBIsThis was Williams' first year back from the war, and it was as if he hadn't missed a day.Runner-up: Hal Newhouser, DET (26-9) 20. Shohei Ohtani, 2023 AL (Angels)Key stats: 44 HR, 1.066 OPS, 10-5, 3.14 ERAIt feels strange having to rank any Ohtani season against anybody else’s: No one has ever done what he does. We’ll put this second award slightly behind his first one, if only because he didn’t play much in the final month. But all of these are going to age terrifically.Runner-up: Corey Seager, TEX (170 OPS+) 21. Robin Yount, 1982 AL (Brewers)Key stats: .331 BA, 129 R, 114 RBIsIf the Brewers had won the World Series that season, this might be in the top 10.Runner-up: Eddie Murray, BAL (156 OPS+) 22. Jackie Robinson, 1949 NL (Dodgers)Key stats: .342 BA, 124 RBIs, 37 SBRobinson only played 10 years in the Majors. Suffice it to say, he made them count.Runner-up: Stan Musial, STL (177 OPS+) 23. Albert Pujols, 2009 NL (Cardinals)Key stats: 189 OPS+, 47 HR, 135 RBIsThis was Pujols' last truly breathtaking season. This was what it was like to see Williams.Runner-up: Hanley Ramirez, FLA (.342 BA) 24. Alex Rodríguez, 2007 AL (Yankees)Key stats: 176 OPS+, 54 HR, 156 RBIsEven with this incredible year, there were still Yankees fans who would have voted for Derek Jeter.Runner-up: Magglio Ordonez, DET (.363 BA) 25. Ted Williams, 1949 AL (Red Sox)Key stats: .490 OBP, 191 OPS+, 159 RBIsThis was Williams' final MVP season, but it's difficult to argue he didn't deserve four or five more.Runner-up: Phil Rizzuto, NYY (110 R) 26. Bryce Harper, 2015 NL (Nationals)Key stats: .330 BA, 198 OPS+, 42 HRHarper was so great in his first MVP season he may spend the rest of his career trying to live it down … or maybe someday even match it.Runner-up: Paul Goldschmidt, ARI (168 OPS+) 27. Shohei Ohtani, 2024 NL (Dodgers)Key stats: 54 HR, 59 SB, 190 OPS+His third MVP may have featured his greatest offensive season, but of course, this one drops below his other two MVPs because he didn’t pitch at all this year. Though he did end up winning a World Series.Runner-up: Francisco Lindor, Mets (33 HR, 29 SB) Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. 28. Ronald Acuña Jr., 2023 NL (Braves)Key stats: 41 HR, 73 SBDid you think that a 40-70 season was even possible before Acuña did this? He also led the NL in OPS, runs and hits, for good measure.Runner-up: Mookie Betts, LAD (8.3 bWAR) 29. Rickey Henderson, 1990 AL (A's)Key stats: 189 OPS+, 28 HR, 65 SBHenderson's true value could never be entirely calculated … but you sure can come close.Runner-up: Cecil Fielder, DET (51 HR) 30. Stan Musial, 1943 NL (Cardinals)Key stats: .357 BA, 177 OPS+, 20 3BMusial's first MVP season, and the one that established him as the model for every St. Louis Cardinals player who would ever come after him.Runner-up: Walker Cooper, STL (.318 BA) 31. Ernie Banks, 1959 NL (Cubs)Key stats: 156 OPS+, 45 HR, 143 RBIsNo player has ever earned a championship more and never had the chance to get one.Runner-up: Eddie Mathews, MLN (46 HR) 32. Barry Bonds, 2003 NL (Giants)Key stats: .341 BA, .231 OPS+, 45 HRSomehow, Bonds' .341/.529/.749 line was a step down from the season before.Runner-up: Albert Pujols, STL (187 OPS+) 33. Joe DiMaggio, 1939 AL (Yankees)Key stats: .381 BA, .448 OBP, 184 OPS+DiMaggio's .381 average this season would be the highest of his career.Runner-up: Jimmie Foxx, BOS (188 OPS+) 34. Lou Boudreau, 1948 AL (Indians)Key stats: .355 BA, .453 OBP, 165 OPS+You won't believe this, but the Indians actually won the World Series this season. That actually happened.Runner-up: Joe DiMaggio, NYY (155 RBIs) 35. Carl Hubbell, 1936 NL (Giants)Key stats: 26-6, 2.31 ERA, 169 ERA+Hubbell's numbers are sometimes so impressive they seem to come from a different sport altogether.Runner-up: Dizzy Dean, STL (24-13) 36. Al Rosen, 1953 AL (Indians)Key stats: 180 OPS+, 43 HR, 145 RBIsRosen's numbers look almost cartoonish compared to the rest of the league at the time.Runner-up: Yogi Berra, NYY (108 RBIs) 37. Rod Carew, 1977 AL (Twins)Key stats: .388 BA, 178 OPS+, 128 RStill the smoothest swing you ever saw.Runner-up: Al Cowens, KC (112 RBIs) 38. Roger Maris, 1961 AL (Yankees)Key stats: 167 OPS+, 61 HR, 141 RBIsOne struggles to put this season in its right context. Statistically, it wasn't as impressive as a lot of other seasons it's ahead of on this list. But how do you discount the greatness of '61? This spot seems right.Runner-up: Mickey Mantle, NYY (54 HR) 39. Barry Bonds, 1993 NL (Giants)Key stats: .336 BA, 206 OPS+, 46 HRBonds' first year as a Giant was the best year of his career to that point … but he was just getting warmed up.Runner-up: Lenny Dykstra, PHI (143 R) 40. Joe DiMaggio, 1941 AL (Yankees)Key stats: .357 BA, 184 OPS+, 125 RBIsDiMaggio was never quite what Williams was as a hitter, but he captured the imagination in a way Williams never could.Runner-up: Ted Williams, BOS (.406 BA) 41. Jimmie Foxx, 1933 AL (A's)Key stats: 201 OPS+, 48 HR, 163 RBIsEven better when you remember Tom Hanks was playing a version of him in ""A League of Their Own.""Runner-up: Joe Cronin, WSH (118 RBIs) 42. Johnny Bench, 1970 NL (Reds)Key stats: 141 OPS+, 45 HR, 148 RBIsBench's greatest power season, and maybe his peak defensive season as well.Runner-up: Billy Williams, CHC (129 RBIs) 43. Barry Bonds, 1990 NL (Pirates)Key stats: 170 OPS+, 33 HR, 52 SBAnother one of those Bonds MVPs you actually forget about.Runner-up: Bobby Bonilla, PIT (120 RBIs) 44. Joe Morgan, 1976 NL (Reds)Key stats: .320 BA, 186 OPS+, 60 SBOne of the most well-rounded and underrated seasons in baseball history.Runner-up: George Foster, CIN (121 RBIs) 45. Roberto Clemente, 1966 NL (Pirates)Key stats: .317 BA, 29 HR, 119 RBIsThis was Clemente's only MVP season, but he deserved at least a couple of others, including the season after this one.Runner-up: Sandy Koufax, LAD (1.73 ERA) 46. George Brett, 1980 AL (Royals)Key stats: .390 BA, 203 OPS+, 118 RBIsThis was three years before the Pine Tar Game, and five years before his lone title.Runner-up: Reggie Jackson, NYY (41 HR) 47. Lefty Grove, 1931 AL (A's)Key stats: 31-4, 2.06 ERA, 217 ERA+The first AL MVP, Grove's numbers are still pretty staggering.Runner-up: Lou Gehrig, NYY (185 RBIs) 48. Albert Pujols, 2008 NL (Cardinals)Key stats: .357 BA, 192 OPS+, 116 RBIsPujols was a star for the next three -- and final years -- with the Cardinals.Runner-up: Ryan Howard, PHI (146 RBIs) 49. Ernie Banks, 1958 NL (Cubs)Key stats: 155 OPS+, 47 HR, 129 RBIsBanks would win two in a row, and this was the first one. The second one was even better.Runner-up: Willie Mays, SF (165 OPS+) 50. Lou Gehrig, 1936 AL (Yankees)Key stats: 190 OPS+, 49 HR, 152 RBIsThe MVP came around too late to fully appreciate both Gehrig and Babe Ruth.Runner-up: Luke Appling, CHW (.388 BA) 51. Mookie Betts, 2018 AL (Red Sox).346/.438/.640, 186 OPS+, 1.078 OPSIt took this incredible of a year to beat Mike Trout … and he ended it with a World Series title.Runner-up: Mike Trout, LAA (1.088 OPS) 52. Alex Rodriguez, 2005 AL (Yankees)Key stats: 173 OPS+, 48 HR, 130 RBIsThis one came on the heels of the Red Sox's 2004 title, so no one wanted to give A-Rod much credit.Runner-up: David Ortiz, BOS (148 RBIs) 53. Ken Griffey Jr., 1997 AL (Mariners)Key stats: 165 OPS+, 56 HR, 147 RBIsGriffey actually wore his hat forward during games, not that you'll ever remember him that way.Runner-up: Tino Martinez, NYY (141 RBIs) 54. Frank Robinson, 1966 AL (Orioles)Key stats: 198 OPS+, 49 HR, 122 RBIsAnd Robinson was a pretty good manager, too, you know.Runner-up: Brooks Robinson, BAL (100 RBIs) 55. Brooks Robinson, 1964 AL (Orioles)Key stats: .317 BA, 28 HR, 118 RBIsClose your eyes and you can still see Robinson diving and throwing it to first from deep in the hole.Runner-up: Mickey Mantle, NYY (177 OPS+) 56. Larry Walker, 1997 NL (Rockies)Key stats: .366 BA, 178 OPS+, 49 HRThe only Rockie to win an MVP award, it's possible Walker's 1997 is still underrated.Runner-up: Mike Piazza, LAD (185 OPS+) 57. Barry Bonds, 1992 NL (Pirates)Key stats: 204 OPS+, 34 HR, 39 SBTo think that we all thought this was as good as Bonds was going to get.Runner-up: Terry Pendleton, ATL (.311 BA) 58. Stan Musial, 1946 NL (Cardinals)Key stats: .365 BA, .434 OBP, 183 OPS+This was Musial's first year back after the war. He hadn't missed a beat.Runner-up: Dixie Walker, BRO (116 RBIs) 59. Paul Goldschmidt, 2022 NL (Cardinals)Key stats: 35 HR, 180 OPS+Goldschmidt actually collapsed a little bit in September, pushing him down this list, but not quite far enough to lose the trophy.Runner-up: Manny Machado, SD (.298/.366/.531, 32 HR) 60. Cal Ripken Jr., 1983 AL (Orioles)Key stats: .318 BA, 121 R, 102 RBIsThis was the World Series season for Ripken and the Orioles … but his most remarkable year was yet to come.Runner-up: Eddie Murray, BAL (156 OPS+) 61. Hank Aaron, 1957 NL (Braves)Key stats: 166 OPS+, 44 HR, 132 RBIsThis was Aaron's only MVP, but the greatness of Aaron was never about one specific season.Runner-up: Stan Musial, STL (172 OPS+) 62. Bryce Harper, 2021 NL (Phillies)Key stats: 42 doubles, 35 homers, 1.044 OPS, 179 OPS+It wasn’t quite as spectacular as his 2015 season, but with his second MVP, Harper established himself as a transcendent superstar of his time.Runner-up: Juan Soto, WSH (.465 OBP) 63. Mike Schmidt, 1980 NL (Phillies)Key stats: 171 OPS+, 48 HR, 121 RBIsNot that this stopped Philadelphia fans from giving Schmidt a hard time.Runner-up: Gary Carter, MON (101 RBIs) 64. Carl Hubbell, 1933 NL (Giants)Key stats: 23-12, 1.66 ERA, 193 ERA+Though you probably remember the All-Star Game more.Runner-up: Chuck Klein, PHI (176 OPS+) 65. Alex Rodriguez, 2003 AL (Rangers)Key stats: 147 OPS+, 47 HR, 118 RBIsAt this point, you thought Rodriguez was going to be the most popular athlete on earth.Runner-up: Carlos Delgado (145 RBIs) 66. George Foster, 1977 NL (Reds)Key stats: 165 OPS+, 52 HR, 149 RBIsIn an era where no one was hitting 50 homers, big George did.Runner-up: Greg Luzinski, PHI (130 RBIs) 67.

Ryne Sandberg, 1984 NL (Cubs)Key stats: .314 BA, 114 R, 32 SBIn an alternative universe, Sandberg caps this season off with a Cubs championship and spends the next two weeks partying with Harry Caray.Runner-up: Keith Hernandez, NYM (.311 BA) 72. Jose Altuve, 2017 AL (Astros)Key stats: .346 BA, 204 H, 32 SBAnd Altuve threw to first base to get the last out that gave the Astros their first World Series title.Runner-up: Aaron Judge, NYY (52 HR) 73. Johnny Bench, 1972 NL (Reds)Key stats: 166 OPS+, 40 HR, 125 RBIsLooking back, it seems sort of impossible how good Bench was.Runner-up: Billy Williams, CHC (171 OPS+) 74. Josh Hamilton, 2010 AL (Rangers)Key stats: .359 BA, .633 SLG, 170 OPS+Hamilton had a short peak, but it sure was breathtaking while it lasted.Runner-up: Miguel Cabrera, DET (178 OPS+) 75. Mickey Mantle, 1962 AL (Yankees)Key stats: .321 BA, 195 OPS+, 30 HRThis wasn't a terrific WAR year for Mantle, and he had 24 fewer homers than he did the year before, but this was also the second-highest OBP of his career.Runner-up: Bobby Richardson, NYY (.302 BA) 76. Pete Rose, 1973 NL (Reds)Key stats: .338 BA, 115 R, 230 HRose made 17 All-Star teams but only won this lone MVP, which feels about right.Runner-up: Willie Stargell, PIT (186 OPS+) 77. Roger Clemens, 1986 AL (Red Sox)Key stats: 24-4, 2.48 ERA, 169 ERA+The only problem with this season is that Clemens had about six non-MVP seasons that were better.Runner-up: Don Mattingly, NYY (.352 BA) 78. Kris Bryant, 2016 NL (Cubs)Key stats: 146 OPS+, 39 HR, 102 RBIsBryant was probably even better in 2017, but you get extra credit when you, you know, end the longest championship drought in professional sports.Runner-up: Daniel Murphy, WSH (.347 BA) 79. Jimmie Foxx, 1938 AL (Red Sox)Key stats: 182 OPS+, 50 HR, 175 RBIsFoxx was such an amazing hitter. He drove in 175 runs, and it's probably the worst of his three MVP seasons.Runner-up: Bill Dickey, NYY (115 RBIs) 80. Joe Gordon, 1942 AL (Yankees)Key stats: .322 BA, 154 OPS+, 103 RBIsBoth Gordon and DiMaggio were 27 in 1942 … but Gordon was better.Runner-up: Ted Williams, BOS (216 OPS+) 81. Ichiro Suzuki, 2001 AL (Mariners)Key stats: .350 BA, 242 H, 56 SBDoes Ichiro get an extra push up the list because of what he meant to baseball? Absolutely.Runner-up: Jason Giambi, OAK (199 OPS+) 82. Reggie Jackson, 1973 AL (A's)Key stats: 161 OPS+, 32 HR, 117 RBIsJackson won only this MVP, though he did finish second for the Yankees in 1980.Runner-up: Jim Palmer, BAL (2.40 ERA) 83. Dick Allen, 1972 AL (White Sox)Key stats: 199 OPS+, 37 HR, 113 RBIsThere are some White Sox fans who believe this season was influential in keeping the club in Chicago.Runner-up: Joe Rudi, OAK (.305 BA) 84. Sammy Sosa, 1998 NL (Cubs)Key stats: 160 OPS+, 66 HR, 158 RBIsI understand why voters got cute in 1998 … but honestly, Mark McGwire really did have the better season.Runner-up: Mark McGwire (70 HR) 85.

Cody Bellinger, 2019 NL (Dodgers)Key stats: .629 SLG, 169 OPS+, 47 HRHis second half wasn't as overwhelming as his first half, but the final numbers were still spectacular, especially for a 23-year-old.Runner up: Christian Yelich (179 OPS+) 87. Mike Trout, 2014 AL (Angels)Key stats: 168 OPS+, 36 HR, 111 RBIsTrout has had four seasons with a higher WAR (7.6) in which he did not win the MVP.Runner-up: Victor Martinez (172 OPS+) 88. Mike Trout, 2019 AL (Angels)Key stats: .438 OBP, 185 OPS+, 45 HRTrout lost a little bit of oomph by missing the end of the season ... not that anyone could catch him anyway.Runner-up: Alex Bregman (1.015 OPS) 89. Freddie Freeman, 2020 NL (Braves)Key stats: .341/.462/.640, 186 OPS+You have to adjust SOMEWHAT for a 60-game season in the middle of a pandemic. But no one knows how difficult 2020 was more than Freeman, who started the season severely ill with COVID-19 and ended it winning a well-deserved MVP.Runner-up: Mookie Betts (.927 OPS) 90. Christian Yelich, 2018 NL MVP (Brewers)164 OPS+, 1.000 OPS, 36 HR, 110 RBIsYelich's incredible September didn't just win him the MVP … it won his team its division.Runner-up: Javier Baez, CHC (111 RBIs) 91. Clayton Kershaw, 2014 NL (Dodgers)Key stats: 21-3, 1.77 ERA, 197 ERA+Kershaw is such an all-timer as a pitcher that you're relieved he got at least one of these in his career.Runner-up: Giancarlo Stanton, MIA (37 HR) 92. Bucky Walters, 1939 NL (Reds)Key stats: 27-11, 2.29 ERA, 319 IPTwenty-seven wins … and 31 complete games.Runner-up: Johnny Mize, STL (178 OPS+) 93. Vida Blue, 1971 AL (A's)Key stats: 24-8, 1.82 ERA, 301 KYou will note a bit of an anti-pitcher-as-MVP bias in this ranking that I'll confess is difficult to shake.Runner-up: Sal Bando, OAK (137 OPS+) 94. Hal Newhouser, 1945 AL (Tigers)Key stats: 25-9, 1.81 ERA, 195 ERA+Speaking of which, it's probably time to deal with Newhouser, who was dominant in 1944 and '45, but mostly because he had a heart murmur and couldn't join the armed forces. This allowed him to tower over what was essentially replacement-level talent. Newhouser was great, but he didn't have to face Williams those two years.Runner-up: Eddie Mayo, DET (112 OPS+) 95. Hal Newhouser, 1944 AL (Tigers)Key stats: 29-9, 2.22 ERA, 159 ERA+See above.Runner-up: Dizzy Trout, DET (27-14, 2.12 ERA, 167 ERA+) 96.

Josh Donaldson, 2015 AL (Blue Jays)Key stats: 151 OPS+, 41 HR, 123 RBIsInjuries ate Donaldson alive the next two seasons, but he'll always have this hardware.Runner-up: Mike Trout (176 OPS+) 98. Mike Schmidt, 1981 NL (Phillies)Key stats: .316 BA, .644 SLG, 198 OPS+This was Schmidt's second MVP in a row; he'd win another five years later.Runner-up: Andre Dawson, MON (157 OPS+) 99. Hank Greenberg, 1935 AL (Tigers)Key stats: 170 OPS+, 36 HR, 168 RBIsThis is your reminder to watch the great documentary ""The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg.""Runner-up: Wes Ferrell, BOS (25-14) 100. Frank Robinson, 1961 NL (Reds)Key stats: .323 BA, 164 OPS+, 124 RBIsThis was his only time finishing higher than fourth in NL MVP voting, and it coincided with the Reds winning the NL pennant.Runner-up: Orlando Cepeda, SF (46 HR) 101. Jason Giambi, 2000 AL (A's)Key stats: 187 OPS+, 43 HR, 137 RBIsOnly loses points because ""Moneyball"" was written after he left.Runner-up: Frank Thomas, CHW (143 RBIs) 102.

Miguel Cabrera, 2012 AL (Tigers)Key stats: .330 BA, 44 HR, 139 RBIsYes, yes, Triple Crown. We'll still argue forever that Trout was better that year.Runner-up: Mike Trout, LAA (49 SB) 104. Giancarlo Stanton, 2017 NL (Marlins)Key stats: 169 OPS+, 59 HR, 132 RBIsWe always wondered what Stanton would do in a healthy season. We found out.Runner-up: Joey Votto, CIN (.454 OBP) 105. Chipper Jones, 1999 NL (Braves)Key stats: .319 BA, 169 OPS+, 45 HRChipper peaked in his age-27 season: 45 homers is no joke.Runner-up: Jeff Bagwell, HOU (149 BB) 106. Willie McGee, 1985 NL (Cardinals)Key stats: .353 BA, 114 R, 56 SBAny Cardinals fan who saw this season still thinks it's the most fun Cards season ever.Runner-up: Dave Parker, CIN (125 RBIs) 107. Andrew McCutchen, 2013 NL (Pirates)Key stats: .317 BA, 157 OPS+, 27 SBWe'd remember this one even more if the Pirates could have broken through in the postseason.Runner-up: Paul Goldschmidt, ARI (125 RBIs) 108. Ryan Braun, 2011 NL (Brewers)Key stats: .332 BA, 166 OPS+, 111 RBIsThis was right before everything went downhill for Braun.Runner-up: Matt Kemp, LAD (172 OPS+) 109. Buster Posey, 2012 NL (Giants)Key stats: .336 BA, 171 OPS+, 103 RBIsUnlike a few backstops on this list, Posey absolutely deserved his MVP.Runner-up: Ryan Braun, MIL (41 HR) 110. Mort Cooper, 1942 NL (Cardinals)Key stats: 22-7, 1.78 ERA, 192 ERA+Cooper was fantastic, but they probably should have just had the Cy Young back then.Runner-up: Enos Slaughter, STL (156 OPS+) 111. Hank Greenberg, 1940 AL (Tigers)Key stats: 171 OPS+, 41 HR, 150 RBIsThe second of Greenberg's MVPs. He deserved them both.Runner-up: Bob Feller, CLE (27-11) 112. Fred Lynn, 1975 AL (Red Sox)Key stats: .331 BA, 162 OPS+, 105 RBIsIt would be 26 years until someone would win Rookie of the Year and MVP awards the same year again.Runner-up: John Mayberry, KC (168 OPS+) 113. Roger Maris, 1960 AL (Yankees)Key stats: 160 OPS+, 39 HR, 112 RBIsThis was actually a higher WAR season (7.5) for Maris than 1961 (6.9), but come on.Runner-up: Mickey Mantle, NYY (40 HR) 114. Joe Mauer, 2009 AL (Twins)Key stats: .365 BA, .444 OBP, .587 SLGMauer would never show that sort of power (28 HR) again.Runner-up: Mark Teixeira, NYY (122 RBIs) 115. Charlie Gehringer, 1937 AL (Tigers)Key stats: .371 BA, 144 OPS+, 133 RGehringer hit .371, but the Tigers missed the postseason.Runner-up: Joe DiMaggio, NYY (167 RBIs) 116. Jim Rice, 1978 AL (Red Sox)Key stats: .315 BA, 46 HR, 139 RBIsThere is considerable debate about Rice's Hall of Fame credentials for his career, but he was a monster in 1978.Runner-up: Ron Guidry (1.74 ERA) 117. Jose Canseco, 1988 AL (A's)Key stats: 170 OPS+, 42 HR, 40 SBThe season that made the 40-40 Club a thing.Runner-up: Mike Greenwell, BOS (.325 BA) 118. Joe DiMaggio, 1947 AL (Yankees)Key stats: .315 BA, 154 OPS+, 97 RBIsVoters wanted to honor Joltin' Joe after his military service, so they picked this year, even though it wasn't actually one of his best ones.Runner-up: Ted Williams, BOS (205 OPS+) 119. Ken Caminiti, 1996 NL (Padres)Key stats: 174 OPS+, 40 HR, 130 RBIsCaminiti's early death -- after admitting to using PEDs during his career -- is still one of baseball's saddest stories.Runner-up: Mike Piazza, LAD (.336 BA) 120. Chuck Klein, 1932 NL (Phillies)Key stats: 164 OPS+, 38 HR, 137 RBIsOne of baseball's great forgotten sluggers.Runner-up: Lon Warneke, CHC (22-6) 121. Roy Campanella, 1953 NL (Dodgers)Key stats: 154 OPS+, 41 HR, 142 RBIsThe best of Campanella's three MVP seasons.Runner-up: Eddie Mathews, MLN (47 HR) 122. Mike Schmidt, 1986 NL (Phillies)Key stats: 153 OPS+, 37 HR, 119 RBIsThe final of Schmidt's three MVPs came when he was 36 years old.Runner-up: Glenn Davis, HOU (101 RBIs) 123. Harmon Killebrew, 1969 AL (Twins)Key stats: 177 OPS+, 49 HR, 140 RBIsForty-nine homers made a lot of eyeballs pop in 1969. Killebrew was also due for an MVP at this point in his career.Runner-up: Boog Powell, BAL (121 RBIs) 124. Don Mattingly, 1985 AL (Yankees)Key stats: .324 BA, 35 HR, 145 RBIsWhen your nickname is your first name with ""Baseball"" on the end of it, you're doing something right.Runner-up: George Brett, KC (179 OPS+) 125. Joey Votto, 2010 NL (Reds)Key stats: 171 OPS+, 37 HR, 113 RBIsThe scary thing about Votto is that he actually got better after this.Runner-up: Albert Pujols, STL (173 OPS+) 126. Miguel Cabrera, 2013 AL (Tigers)Key stats: 190 OPS+, 44 HR, 137 RBIsThis was the year after Cabrera's Triple Crown season, though, predictably, Trout had the higher WAR.Runner-up: Mike Trout, LAA (179 OPS+) 127. Frank Thomas, 1993 AL (White Sox)Key stats: 177 OPS+, 41 HR, 128 RBIsThere was a time when it seemed impossible to get Thomas out.Runner-up: Paul Molitor, TOR (.332 BA) 128. Orlando Cepeda, 1967 NL (Cardinals)Key stats: .325 BA, 164 OPS+, 111 RBIsRemembered more as a Giant, but Cepeda earned his MVP in St. Louis.Runner-up: Tim McCarver, STL (136 OPS+) 129.

Roy Campanella, 1951 NL (Dodgers)Key stats: .325 BA, 159 OPS+, 33 HRCatchers are always the most difficult to quantify decades later. They're the hardest to quantify now.Runner-up: Stan Musial, STL (183 OPS+) 132. Dale Murphy, 1982 NL (Braves)Key stats: 142 OPS+, 113 R, 36 HRThere is nothing about Murphy that doesn't put one in a good mood.Runner-up: Lonnie Smith, STL (68 SB) 133. Spud Chandler, 1943 AL (Yankees)Key stats: 20-4, 1.64 ERA, 20 CGOne of the first ""run support"" pitcher MVPs of his time.Runner-up: Luke Appling, CWS (.328 BA) 134. Yogi Berra, 1954 AL (Yankees)Key stats: .307 BA, 136 OPS+, 125 RBIsYou try not to be betrothed to WAR here, but it must be pointed out that Berra's 5.4 WAR this year was roughly what Whit Merrifield's was in 2018.Runner-up: Larry Doby, CLE (126 RBIs) 135. Dolph Camilli, 1941 NL (Dodgers)Key stats: 164 OPS+, 34 HR, 120 RBIsIt's good to live in a world where a man named ""Dolph"" won an MVP.Runner-up: Pete Reiser, BRO (.343 BA) 136. Ken Boyer, 1964 NL (Cardinals)Key stats: .295 BA, 100 R, 119 RBIsCredited, rightly, for helping that team to such an unlikely World Series win.Runner-up: Johnny Callison, PHI (31 HR) 137. Kevin Mitchell, 1989 NL (Giants)Key stats: 192 OPS+, 47 HR, 125 RBIsI'll still remember Mitchell more for the fly ball he caught barehanded.Runner-up: Will Clark, SF (.333 BA) 138. Jeff Kent, 2000 NL (Giants)Key stats: .334 BA, 162 OPS+, 125 RBIsHurt historically by the fact that he was on the same team as Bonds, who was of course better. He was always better than everyone.Runner-up: Barry Bonds, SF (188 OPS+) 139. Jeff Bagwell, 1994 NL (Astros)Key stats: .368 BA, 213 OPS+, 116 RBIsI like to pretend that 1994 never happened -- the year simply vanished from the earth when they cancelled the World Series. But what Bagwell did in the famously pitcher-friendly Astrodome was impressive.Runner-up: Matt Williams, SF (43 HR) 140. Frank Thomas, 1994 AL (White Sox)Key stats: .353 BA, 212 OPS+, 38 HRThomas won MVP the year before, so at least he can say he had a full-season MVP in addition to a strike-shortened one.Runner-up: Ken Griffey Jr., SEA (40 HR) 141. Dale Murphy, 1983 NL (Braves)Key stats: 149 OPS+, 36 HR, 121 RBIsAgain: You're just happy thinking about Murphy, aren't you?Runner-up: Andre Dawson, MON (113 RBIs) 142. Dave Parker, 1978 NL (Pirates)Key stats: .334 BA, 166 OPS+, 117 RBIsParker might be among the most unfairly forgotten players of the late 1970s and early '80s.Runner-up: Steve Garvey, LAD (113 RBIs) 143. Mickey Cochrane, 1934 AL (Tigers)Key stats: .320 BA, .428 OBP, 117 OPS+On one of the great all-time teams, Cochrane was undeniably the leader. But he should probably get points taken away here for also being the manager, right?Runner-up: Charlie Gehringer, DET (127 RBIs) 144. Phil Cavarretta, 1945 NL (Cubs)Key stats: .355 BA, .449 OBP, 166 OPS+This was the last time the Cubs would make the World Series until … well, you know.Runner-up: Tommy Holmes, BSN (175 OPS+) 145. Zoilo Versalles, 1965 AL (Twins)Key stats: 126 R, 45 2B, 27 SBVersalles struck out all the time before it was cool to strike out all the time.Runner-up: Tony Oliva, MIN (141 OPS+) 146. Joe Torre, 1971 NL (Cardinals)Key stats: .363 BA, 230 H, 137 RBIsTorre's career year as a player, though he'd have a few more as a manager.Runner-up: Willie Stargell, PIT (185 OPS+) 147. Phil Rizzuto, 1950 AL (Yankees)Key stats: .324 BA, .418 OBP, 125 RRizzuto will always be the guy on the Meat Loaf song to me.Runner-up: Billy Goodman, BOS (.354 BA) 148. Yogi Berra, 1955 AL (Yankees)Key stats: 120 OPS+, 27 HR, 108 RBIsNot to play WAR games again, but Berra's WAR this year (4.5) was about the same as J.T. Realmuto's in 2018 (4.3).Runner-up: Al Kaline, DET (162 OPS+) 149. Jimmy Rollins, 2007 NL (Phillies)Key stats: 212 H, 139 R, 41 SBConsidering all the numbers being put up this season, that Rollins still stood out speaks extremely well of him.Runner-up: Matt Holliday, COL (137 RBIs) 150. Roy Campanella, 1955 NL (Dodgers)Key stats: .318 BA, 152 OPS+, 32 HRCampanella was terrific, of course, but 123 games isn't that much, even for a catcher.Runner-up: Duke Snider, BRO (169 OPS+) 151. Ivan Rodriguez, 1999 AL (Rangers)Key stats: .332 BA, 35 HR, 113 RBIsPudge more than earned an MVP at some point in his career.Runner-up: Pedro Martinez, BOS (243 ERA+) 152. Vladimir Guerrero, 2004 AL (Angels)Key stats: .337 BA, 39 HR, 126 RBIsVlad never had the OBP numbers to crack truly rarified air historically, but he was always the MVP for pure pleasantness to watch.Runner-up: Gary Sheffield, NYY (121 RBIs) 153. Yogi Berra, 1951 AL (Yankees)Key stats: 130 OPS+, 27 HR, 88 RBIsWhat do you do with Yogi? He won three MVPs, but none of them were historically dominating seasons statistically. As always, Yogi is his own animal.Runner-up: Ned Garver, SLB (20-12) 154. Barry Larkin, 1995 NL (Reds)Key stats: .319 BA, 134 OPS+, 51 SBIn a strike-shortened season, you couldn't go wrong with picking a team leader of a terrific team.Runner-up: Dante Bichette, COL (.340 BA) 155. Maury Wills, 1962 NL (Dodgers)Key stats: 208 H, 130 R, 104 SBThe stolen-base revolution that Wills ushered in led to some eye-popping numbers that swayed many MVP voters.Runner-up: Willie Mays, SF (49 HR) 156. Nellie Fox, 1959 AL (White Sox)Key stats: .306 BA, .380 OBP, 191 HFox's numbers and the general esteem with which he is held make a strong argument that you had to be there.Runner-up: Luis Aparicio, CHW (56 SB) 157. Ryan Howard, 2006 NL (Phillies)Key stats: .659 SLG, 58 HR, 149 RBIsHoward was always a little overranked as a hitter, a boon to RBI voters, but this was unquestionably his best season.Runner-up: Albert Pujols, STL (178 OPS+) 158. Hank Sauer, 1952 NL (Cubs)Key stats: 143 OPS+, 37 HR, 121 RBIsBecause of his military service, Sauer's career didn't really get going until his early 30s. His peak came during this MVP year, when he was 35.Runner-up: Robin Roberts, PHI (28-7) 159. Elston Howard, 1963 AL (Yankees)Key stats: 141 OPS+, 28 HR, 85 RBIsThey were just used to voting for Yankees at this point.Runner-up: Al Kaline, DET (.312 BA) 160. Robin Yount, 1989 AL (Brewers)Key stats: .318 BA, 152 OPS+, 103 RBIsOf his two MVPs, this was the less inspiring.Runner-up: Ruben Sierra, TEX (119 RBIs) 161. Thurman Munson, 1976 AL (Yankees)Key stats: .302 BA, 17 HR, 105 RBIsMunson is understandably revered, but it is worth noting how much voters used to absolutely adore awarding catchers.Runner-up: George Brett, KC (.333 BA) 162. Terry Pendleton, 1991 NL (Braves)Key stats: .319 BA, 187 H, 139 OPS+Pendleton was excellent for the Braves this season and is a beloved franchise icon, but when you think of the 1990s Braves, is Pendleton even in the top seven?Runner-up: Barry Bonds, PIT (160 OPS+) 163. José Abreu, 2020 AL (White Sox).Key stats: Led Majors in RBIs and total basesAbreu had long been the Sox's steadiest hitter, but he had his career year right as the team's young talent was breaking through.Runner-up: José Ramirez, CLE (.993 OPS) 164. Bob Elliot, 1947 NL (Braves)Key stats: .317 BA, .410 OBP, 113 RBIsThis is a strange one. Elliot wasn't the best player on his own team (that would have been Warren Spahn), and the team only finished third. RBIs, man.Runner-up: Ewell Blackwell, CIN (22-8) 165. Ernie Lombardi, 1938 NL (Reds)Key stats: .342 BA, 152 OPS+, 95 RBIsThere was no way they weren't going to vote for a catcher who led the league in hitting.Runner-up: Bill Lee, CHC (22-9) 166. Gabby Hartnett, 1935 NL (Cubs)Key stats: .344 BA, 151 OPS+, 91 RBIsNo disrespect to Old Tomato Face intended here.Runner-up: Dizzy Dean, STL (28-12) 167. Frank McCormick, 1940 NL (Reds)Key stats: .309 BA, 44 2B, 127 RBIsIf you had 127 RBIs for a team that finished in first during this age, you had a slam-dunk MVP case.Runner-up: Johnny Mize, STL (43 HR) 168. Miguel Tejada, 2002 AL (A's)Key stats: .308 BA, 34 HR, 131 RBIsOf all the star players who were playing this particular year, Tejada isn't the one whose name tends to jump out at you first.Runner-up: Alex Rodriguez, TEX (57 HR) 169. Don Newcombe, 1956 NL (Dodgers)Key stats: 27-7, 3.06 ERA, 0.989 WHIPNewcombe won 27 games, which, man, 27 games, but still: He had a 3.06 ERA and barely struck out five batters a game.Runner-up: Sal Maglie, BRO (2.87 ERA) 170. Boog Powell, 1970 AL (Orioles)Key stats: 163 OPS+, 35 HR, 114 RBIsEverybody loves Boog, but this was another empty RBI vote season.Runner-up: Tony Oliva, MIN (.325 BA) 171. Dick Groat, 1960 NL (Pirates)Key stats: .325 BA, 186 H, 85 RGreat defense, a high average, but only two homers?Runner-up: Don Hoak, PIT (97 R) 172. Justin Morneau, 2006 AL (Twins)Key stats: .321 BA, 34 HR, 130 RBIsIf you can't believe Jeter never won an MVP, know that this is the year he should have.Runner-up: Derek Jeter, NYY (.343 BA) 173. George Bell, 1987 AL (Blue Jays)Key stats: .605 SLG, 47 HR, 134 RBIsBell is generally an underappreciated player from his time, but this was not a particularly monster year.Runner-up: Alan Trammell, DET (155 OPS+) 174. Mo Vaughn, 1995 AL (Red Sox)Key stats: 144 OPS+, 39 HR, 126 RBIsVoters were really, really into RBIs in the 1990s.Runner-up: Albert Belle, CLE (50 HR) 175. Juan Gonzalez, 1998 AL (Rangers)Key stats: .318 BA, 45 HR, 157 RBIsThe counting stats are incredible, but there's an argument for any number of other fearsome sluggers that year, including Albert Belle, Mo Vaughn and Manny Ramirez. Not to mention, you had the likes of Derek Jeter, Ken Griffey, Jr. and Alex Rodriguez, all of whom had very strong cases.Runner-up: Nomar Garciaparra, BOS (.323 BA) 176. Juan Gonzalez, 1996 AL (Rangers)Key stats: .314 BA, 47 HR, 144 RBIsWe don't talk about Gonzalez nearly as much as we talk about other multiple MVP winners, do we?Runner-up: Alex Rodriguez, SEA (.358 BA) 177. Frankie Frisch, 1931 NL (Cardinals)Key stats: .311 BA, 96 R, 28 SBFrisch was the leader of the Gashouse Gang, but his primary contribution seemed to be leading the league in steals.Runner-up: Chuck Klein, PHI (121 RBIs) 178. Jackie Jensen, 1958 AL (Red Sox)Key stats: 148 OPS+, 35 HR, 122 RBIsJensen had a bunch of homers and RBIs, but you could argue teammates Pete Runnels and a 39-year-old Ted Williams were both better.Runner-up: Bob Turley, NYY (21-7) 179. Don Baylor, 1979 AL (Angels)Key stats: 145 OPS+, 36 HR, 139 RBIsBaylor had some gaudy offensive numbers, but essentially zero, or even negative, defensive value.Runner-up: Ken Singleton, BAL (155 OPS+) 180. Andre Dawson, 1987 NL (Cubs)Key stats: .568 SLG, 49 HR, 137 RBIsOne of the more famous voting mistakes of all time, Dawson won despite having a merely RBI-heavy season for a last-place team.Runner-up: Ozzie Smith, STL (43 SB) 181. Marty Marion, 1944 NL (Cardinals)Key stats: 90 OPS+, 26 2B, 63 RBIsMarion batted .267 with six homers and one stolen base. Sure, he was a great defensive player, but come on.Runner-up: Bill Nicholson, CHC (122 RBIs) 182. Steve Garvey, 1974 NL (Dodgers)Key stats: .312 BA, 200 H, 111 RBIsIt is possible Garvey won this award in large part because he just looked like a superstar. This was a modest statistical season by modern MVP standards.Runner-up: Lou Brock, STL (118 SB) 183. Jeff Burroughs, 1974 AL (Rangers)Key stats: .301 BA, 25 HR, 118 RBIsTough year for voters, 1974. An entirely RBI-driven award, Burroughs was actually 25th in AL bWAR that year.Runner-up: Joe Rudi, OAK (99 RBIs) 184. Jim Konstanty, 1950 NL (Phillies)Key stats: 16-7, 2.66 ERA, 22 SVKonstanty at least threw 152 innings in 74 relief appearances and won 16 games without making a start. He might have had a place in today's game, actually.Runner-up: Stan Musial, STL (164 OPS+) 185. Willie Hernandez, 1984 AL (Tigers)Key stats: 1.92 ERA, 32 SV, 140 1/3 IPFine, so you had to honor somebody from that incredible Tigers roster. But Hernandez probably wasn't one of the best three players on his own team that year.Runner-up: Kent Hrbek, MIN (27 HR) 186. Rollie Fingers, 1981 AL (Brewers)Key stats: 1.04 ERA, 333 ERA+, 28 SVWe'll give Fingers a boost because he had an absurd ERA. But as you can see, relief pitcher MVPs are not my jam.Runner-up: Rickey Henderson, OAK (56 SB) 187. Dennis Eckersley, 1992 AL (A's)Key stats: 1.91 ERA, 51 SV, 8.5 K/BBI love the Eck. You love the Eck. And he was great in 1992. But Eckersley also threw 80 innings in 1992. You're gonna give a guy an MVP for 80 innings? He has the lowest WAR (2.9) of any of the 175 winners by a rather dramatic amount. Seriously, though: We still love you, Eck.Runner-up: Kirby Puckett, MIN (.329 BA) 188.

MLB News,Juggernaut Japan cements spot in Premier12 gold medal game,https://www.mlb.com/news/premier12-super-round-scores-and-results,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 14:13:00 GMT",,"Michael Clair TOKYO -- Four teams are left to battle for the title of Premier12 champions -- the international tournament that pits the top 12 ranked baseball nations against each other and has helped spur the career of many future Major Leaguers. The top two teams from each group -- Venezuela and the United States from Group A and Japan and Chinese Taipei from Group B -- advanced to the super round, where they will now play a three-day round robin to determine which two teams will face off in the championship game on Sunday. There will be two games held each day at the Tokyo Dome (start times are 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. ET) and the action is available to be streamed with a subscription to DAZN in the United States and Canada. As we work toward the championship game, we’ll keep you updated with the outcomes of each super-round game in this story. Super-round Game 1: Venezuela 2, Chinese Taipei 0 Venezuela powered its way through the group stage, going 4-1 to take first place thanks to an experienced lineup with plenty of pop. On Thursday afternoon at the Tokyo Dome, that trend continued: Carlos Eduardo Pérez (one of two catchers named Carlos Pérez on the roster) -- who saw Major League action in parts of five seasons, most recently with the A’s in 2023 -- hit a two-run home run in the fourth inning to give Venezuela a lead that it would never relinquish. 🇻🇪💪 Arepa Power, Carlos Perez with the Home Run! #Premier12 || @Premier12 pic.twitter.com/75nvEJtxLU After Nivaldo Rodriguez -- who went 10-4 with a 2.16 ERA in the CPBL this past season, making him very familiar with the Chinese Taipei lineup -- pitched four shutout innings, Venezuela manager Omar López then utilized his bullpen to perfection. Seven relievers followed -- five of them recording just one out (there is no batter minimum in the Premier12 tournament) -- to finish off the shutout. ""The reason why we're getting stronger is because we have the Venezuelan name on our chest,"" López said after the game. ""And when you have the Venezuelan name, when you wear the jersey, there is nothing better than that. Nothing. Nothing. It's pride, it's honor and it's privilege."" Game 2: Japan 9, United States 1 For four innings, it was one of the most unlikely pitching duels you'll ever see: On one side was 44-year-old USA starter Rich Hill, a veteran of nearly 400 big league games who befuddled and bewitched Samurai Japan batters with an endless bevy of slow curves that at times barely crested 70 mph. On the other was Hitaro Takahashi, the young Japanese ace who is half Hill’s age, armed with a 98 mph fastball and diving low-90s split-finger. Despite the difference in styles, the two matched each other: Hill gave up one hit and struck out five. Takahashi, with dreams of the big leagues and MLB scouts in attendance, gave up two hits and struck out eight. Once pulled though, the runs came: A’s No. 7 prospect Colby Thomas, who hit 31 home runs in the Minors last year, blasted a solo shot to right-field in the top of the fifth, flapping the ""USA"" on his chest as he rounded the bases. 🇺🇸😤 Colby Thomas destroyed that baseball! #Premier12 || @Premier12 | @USABaseball pic.twitter.com/bHt0Ht9IPT That was no match for Japan’s second baseman Kaito Kozono. Despite hitting just two home runs in 588 PA for the Hiroshima Carp this season, he went supernova on Thursday: Kozono hit a two-run triple in the fifth, a three-run homer in the 7th, and capped it off with a two-run shot in the 8th. That was enough for seemingly unbeatable Japan, who extended its international winning streak to a remarkable 25 games. Its last loss came against the United States in the 2019 Premier12. 🔥🔥🔥 Kaito Kozono is a walking flame! #Premier12 || @Premier12 pic.twitter.com/rn5ttVKLS7 Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Game 3: Chinese Taipei 8, United States 2 In a must-win game between two teams that lost their first super-round games, it was Chinese Taipei whose bats came to play. After threatening in each of the first three innings, Chinese Taipei broke through with two runs in the fourth, another in the fifth, and – with the game still within reach – a five-run seventh inning led by a Kun-Yu Chiang bases-loaded triple. 😤 Chinese Taipei making a statement! #Premier12 pic.twitter.com/A40vBhU5i8 For the USA, Colby Thomas homered for the second consecutive day, though he was lifted after being hit by a pitch in the bottom of the seventh to add a painful end to a rough day for the United States. Though there is technically a possibility of a three-way tie for 1-2 between the U.S., Chinese Taipei, and Venezuela, the United States’ rough performance on the mound means that the tiebreaker rules will almost certainly not break in their favor to reach the gold medal final. ""We are writing our own history story,"" Chinese Taipei manager Hao-Jiu Tseng said after the team's first win against the United States since 2003. ""I also hope that we have two more games. There's an infinite possibility in life. You don't know if you're going to make it, unless you try."" Game 4: Japan 9, Venezuela 6 It wasn’t so much a hush as it was a murmur, an anxious grumble that rolled its way around the Tokyo Dome after Venezuela’s slugging catcher Carlos Pérez hit a two-run home run to give Venezuela the lead in the sixth inning. A few batters later, when Angel Reyes drove in another run to make it 5-3, that grumble turned into outright fear: For the first time in 26 games, a stretch that runs back to 2019, Samurai Japan might lose on the international stage. No one should have been worried. The powerful Japanese bats stormed back in the bottom half of the frame, a bases-loaded walk and a single knotting the game at five. Next up was Shugo Maki, the beloved, dancing slugger who recently helped the Yokohama BayStars win their first Japan Series in 26 years. He took one pitch, a ball. On the next, he lofted a grand slam into the seats and the fans lit up, the decibel levels climbing astronomically. 🔥🔥🔥 ¡¡SHUGO MAKI!!#Premier12 || @Premier12 pic.twitter.com/1pceWYStjd From there, the Samurai Japan pitchers shut the door and the team’s 26th consecutive win was sealed. Japan plays Chinese Taipei tomorrow, but its spot in Sunday’s gold medal game is already assured.",2024-11-22,1,0.32,0.68
MLB News,Ohtani joins Frank Robinson as 2nd player to win MVP in both leagues,https://www.mlb.com/news/shohei-ohtani-joins-frank-robinson-to-win-al-and-nl-mvp,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 00:28:00 GMT",,"Bill Ladson Dodgers designated hitter Shohei Ohtani added to his legacy Thursday night when he became the second player in baseball history to win the Most Valuable Player Award in both the American and National Leagues, and the first to do so in back-to-back seasons. Ohtani, 30, won the award twice with the Angels -- in 2021 and last year. This year, he found himself in the National League and didn’t miss a beat with the Dodgers, becoming the first player in Major League history with 50 homers and 50 steals in a season. But long before Ohtani put himself in the record books, Frank Robinson was the first to win baseball’s top award in both leagues -- first as a member of the Reds in 1961 and then with the Orioles five years later. That distinction lasted 58 years until Ohtani joined him Thursday. In 1961, Robinson was the No. 1 reason Cincinnati went as far as the World Series before losing to the Yankees in five games. He received 15 of the 16 first-place votes [teammate Joey Jay received the other vote] to win the National League MVP. Robinson led Cincinnati in Wins Above Replacement (7.7, bWAR) and had a slash line of .323/404/.611. Five years later, Cincinnati gave Robinson extra motivation to be the best in baseball. The team traded him to the Orioles for right-hander Milt Pappas and two other players because Robinson, as Reds owner Bill Dewitt put it, “was an old 30.” Robinson ended up making history by winning the Triple Crown and helping the Orioles to their first World Series title. A few weeks later, he was the unanimous MVP in the American League. “Remember, [Robinson] … was as old as Ohtani. Nobody refers to Ohtani as an old 30,” said Baseball Hall of Famer Jim Palmer, who was Robinson’s teammate from 1966-1971. “Frank was an exceptional player. Frank made you think you were going to win. He was a leader, because if he saw something, he was going to say something. … He made everybody better like what M.J. [Michael Jordan] did with the Bulls.” When he was managing the Nationals in 2006, Robinson was surprised that no other Major Leaguer won the MVP in both leagues. He felt with free agency in place starting in 1975, more players would join him in that special category. Mark Langill is the official historian for the Dodgers, and he has a different perspective on why it took 58 years for a player like Ohtani to win the award in both leagues. “I think it’s more luck of the draw in terms of players moving [to another team],” Langill said. “You can have a great season and, like in golf, somebody else could be better than you. It’s not like the batting title. This is an election. This isn’t a stat. It’s not something automatic. “Think about this: In 1924, pitcher Dazzy Vance was the National League MVP. Rogers Hornsby finished second and hit .424. That’s the crazy thing. You have an election and it’s still up to chance. Anything with an election, there is always wiggle room on the result. You can get edged. It’s not like you are leading the league in homers. That’s something you have control over. You don’t have control over an election.” So who could be the next player to win the MVP in both leagues? It very well could be another Dodger -- Mookie Betts won the MVP with the Red Sox in 2018. But since he joined the Dodgers, Betts finished second behind Freddie Freeman in 2020 and Ronald Acuña Jr. three years later. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. “[Betts] can do anything he wants,” said MLB analyst Harold Reynolds. “He can hit home runs. He can steal bases. He can get a man over. He can play short, second base, right field and center field. He is the consummate team player. He has everything. What’s not to like? It’s easy to go in that direction [and pick Betts to win the National League MVP].”",2024-11-22,1,0.42,0.58
MLB News,MVP winners in first season with new team,https://www.mlb.com/news/mvp-winners-in-first-season-with-new-team,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:33:00 GMT",,"Sarah Langs Everyone wants to make a strong first impression, and there are few individual accomplishments more impactful than doing so in the form of an MVP Award in a first season after changing teams. Only nine players have won MVP honors in their first year with a new team following a trade, and another six have done so in their first year with a team joined in free agency. Here’s a look at the 15 players to win an MVP Award in their first year with a new team, in reverse chronological order. Note that this list includes players who played in the Majors before joining a new team -- so Ichiro Suzuki, who won in 2001 as a rookie, is not included (Fred Lynn won as a second-year rookie in 1975). 2024: Shohei Ohtani, DodgersAcquired: free agent Ohtani joined the Dodgers on a record 10-year, $700 million contract following six seasons with the Angels, and his signing immediately paid dividends. The two-way superstar was unable to pitch in his first season with the Dodgers after undergoing right elbow surgery the year before, but he made history nonetheless, becoming the first player in MLB history to hit at least 50 home runs (54) and steal at least 50 bases (59) in the same season. That performance earned Ohtani the third MVP Award of his career (all unanimous). It also marked the first time a full-time designated hitter has been named MVP. Not only that, but he helped lead the Dodgers to a World Series title in his first career postseason. 2018: Christian Yelich, BrewersAcquired: traded from MIA The Marlins traded Yelich to the Brewers after the 2017 season, the month after they’d traded reigning NL MVP Giancarlo Stanton to the Yankees. Yelich was on the heels of two straight 4.8 WAR seasons, the top two of his career. But he was even better in ‘18, putting up 7.3 WAR and winning the first batting title in Brewers history en route to MVP honors. He received 29 of 30 first-place votes for the award, winning handily. Yelich had another MVP-worthy campaign in 2019, finishing second to Cody Bellinger after suffering a season-ending injury in early September. 2015: Josh Donaldson, Blue JaysAcquired: traded from OAKDonaldson received MVP votes in 2013 and ‘14, his first two full seasons in the Majors and what would end up being his final two in Oakland. After a '14 campaign that netted him his first All-Star selection, the A’s traded him to Toronto in the offseason. In 2015, he led the AL with 123 RBIs, knocking 41 homers. Donaldson beat out Mike Trout, who also hit 41 homers, for MVP. Donaldson finished fourth for MVP in his second year in Toronto, and he received down-ballot consideration in 2017. The Blue Jays traded him to the Indians at the waiver deadline in 2018. 2004: Vladimir Guerrero, AngelsAcquired: free agentAfter spending the first eight years of his career with the Expos, Guerrero became a free agent following the 2003 season. At that point, he was already a four-time All-Star and had received MVP votes in each of the prior six seasons. Guerrero got a five-year, $70 million contract with a club option -- a $14 million average annual value that was the largest of any multi-year free-agent contract inked that offseason. In his first season, he hit .337 with 39 homers and 126 RBIs, beating out second-place finisher Gary Sheffield for AL MVP. Guerrero never won a second MVP, but he did receive votes in each of his first five seasons with the Angels. 1993: Barry Bonds, GiantsAcquired: free agentAfter playing the first seven years of his career with the Pirates, winning two MVP Awards, including in 1992, Bonds became a free agent. He signed with the Giants for six years and $43.75 million entering the ‘93 season. The reigning NL MVP made an immediate impact, leading the Majors with 46 homers and a 1.136 OPS to win his second consecutive award. He’s the only player to win the award in consecutive years with two different teams. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Bonds went on to win a record seven MVP Awards, with the remaining four coming consecutively in 2001-04. 1991: Terry Pendleton, BravesAcquired: free agentPendleton played the first seven years of his career with the Cardinals, winning two Gold Gloves and receiving MVP voting consideration once. He had never hit above .286 in any season in which he played at least 100 games when he entered free agency for the 1991 season. He signed a four-year, $10.2 million contract to join the Braves, putting up a career year in his debut. He led the NL in batting average at .319 and had a career-high 22 homers. He beat out Bonds for the MVP Award, getting 12 of 24 first-place votes. Pendleton received MVP votes once more in his career, when he finished second the following season. 1988: Kirk Gibson, DodgersAcquired: free agentGibson played the first nine years of his career with the Tigers, receiving MVP votes in three separate seasons. In the offseason entering 1988, he joined the Dodgers on a three-year, $4.5 million contract. Gibson’s most memorable moment in ‘88 had nothing to do with the regular-season efforts that merited his MVP honors, but the award is yet another part of such a notable debut season for him in Los Angeles. Gibson beat out Darryl Strawberry for NL MVP. Gibson never reached his 1988 numbers again in terms of batting average (.290) or homers (25), but his place is cemented in Dodgers lore for his pinch-hit, walk-off home run in Game 1 of the World Series. 1987: Andre Dawson, CubsAcquired: free agentDawson played the first 11 seasons of his career with the Expos, winning the 1977 NL Rookie of the Year Award and six straight Gold Gloves from 1980-85. After the 1986 season, Dawson became a free agent. Entering the 1987 season, he infamously gave the Cubs a blank contract, and he ended up signing a one-year contract worth up to $650,000. In his second straight contract year, Dawson led the Majors with 49 homers and 137 RBIs, winning NL MVP honors. Dawson went on to sign a three-year contract with the Cubs and was an All Star in each of his first five seasons playing in Chicago, across multiple contracts. 1984: Willie Hernandez, TigersAcquired: traded from PHIHernandez pitched for the Cubs from 1977-83, before he was traded to the Phillies in May ‘83. In the offseason, the Phillies traded him to the Tigers -- just before the season started. Hernandez went on to have a dominant season in relief, pitching in 80 games and recording 32 saves with a 1.92 ERA. He won the AL Cy Young Award, and he beat out Kent Hrbek for the MVP, too. Hernandez was an All-Star in 1985 and ‘86, but he never received BBWAA Award votes again. 1981: Rollie Fingers, BrewersAcquired: traded from STL (after earlier offseason trade from SD)Fingers spent the first nine years of his career with the A’s, before signing with the Padres as a free agent entering the 1977 season. He pitched there through 1980, before the club traded him to the Cardinals in the offseason. Four days later, the Cardinals sent him to the Brewers. In his first season in Milwaukee, Fingers led the AL in saves and had a 1.04 ERA In 47 games. He won the Cy Young Award and tacked on MVP honors, too -- edging out Rickey Henderson. Fingers got MVP consideration again in 1982, though he was not named on any Cy Young ballots, and he did not get votes for any BBWAA Awards after that year. 1972: Dick Allen, White SoxAcquired: traded from LADAllen played the first seven years of his career with the Phillies, winning the 1964 NL Rookie of the Year Award and receiving MVP votes in four straight seasons from 1964-67. The Phillies traded him to the Cardinals after the 1969 season, and the Cardinals sent him to the Dodgers a year later. After a one-year stint in Los Angeles, the Dodgers traded Allen to the White Sox. Playing on his third new team in three seasons, Allen led the AL in homers and RBIs in 1972, winning the MVP Award handily over Joe Rudi. He was an All-Star and received MVP votes in each of his three seasons in Chicago, before the White Sox traded him to the Braves, who eventually sent him back to Philadelphia. 1966: Frank Robinson, OriolesAcquired: traded from CINRobinson played the first 10 years of his career with the Reds, receiving votes for a BBWAA Award in all but one of those seasons. He was Rookie of the Year in 1956 and won MVP honors in 1961. His Hall of Fame path was already well paved. Following the 1965 season, he was traded for the first of three times in his career, when the Reds sent him to Baltimore. Robinson wasted no time in becoming the first, and to this point only, player to win MVP honors in both leagues. In his first year in Baltimore, he led the Majors in homers with 49 and slugging percentage at .637. He won the MVP Award unanimously, outpacing second- and third-place finishers Brooks Robinson and Boog Powell -- both of whom were on his team. Robinson didn’t win another MVP Award, but he finished his career with 586 home runs, 14 All-Star selections and an entire trophy case that led to his induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. 1960: Roger Maris, YankeesAcquired: traded from KCAMaris played the first three years of his career for the Indians and Athletics. He was an All-Star for the A’s in 1959, but he had never hit more than 28 homers or slugged above .464. His first year in the Bronx was a different story. Maris hit 39 homers, drove in 112 runs and led the AL with a .581 slugging percentage. He edged out teammate Mickey Mantle for AL MVP by three vote points, receiving two fewer first-place votes than Mantle did. We all know what happened next -- Maris hit 61 homers in 1961 to break Babe Ruth’s single-season record of 60 in 1927. That performance earned Maris his second consecutive MVP Award, again besting Mantle, and making him the only player to win an MVP Award in each of his first two seasons with a new team. 1947: Bob Elliott, BravesAcquired: traded from PITElliott played the first eight years of his career with the Pirates and was a three-time All-Star and four-time MVP vote-getter for them. After the 1946 season, they traded him to the Braves, where he would go on to play the next five seasons. In his first year in Boston, he hit .317 with 22 homers and 113 RBIs. He won MVP honors over Ewell Blackwell. He got MVP votes the next year, as well, and again in 1950, but he did not win another major award. 1934: Mickey Cochrane, TigersAcquired: traded from PHACochrane played the first nine years of his career in Philadelphia, hitting .321 with 108 homers in more than 1,000 games. After the 1933 season, the A’s traded him to the Tigers. He hit .320 and was an All-Star -- in the second year of the Midsummer Classic. After the season, in the fourth year of the BBWAA MVP Award, Cochrane won -- just barely defeating teammate Charlie Gehringer. Cochrane received MVP consideration once more in his career, in 1935.",2024-11-22,1,0.32,0.68

MLB News,Meet the Chesapeake Baysox! Orioles' Double-A affiliate gets a new look,https://www.mlb.com/news/baltimore-orioles-affiliate-changes-name-to-chesapeake-baysox,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 15:15:00 GMT",,"Benjamin Hill The Bowie Baysox, established as the Baltimore Orioles' Double-A affiliate in 1993, have always referenced Chesapeake Bay in their name. Today, during an unveiling event at Annapolis's Chesapeake Bay Foundation, this connection was made explicit: The Bowie Baysox are now the Chesapeake Baysox. The Baysox have an updated name and a new look, but will continue to operate out of Bowie's Prince George's Stadium. The switch to Chesapeake as the team's geographical signifier reflects the expansion of its fan base. Bowie is located approximately 20 miles west of Chesapeake Bay, with the Chesapeake Bay region including parts of six states as well as Washington, D.C. ""Chesapeake Baysox highlights the sense of pride in the region and a larger family of fans that are now supporting the team,"" said team owner Greg Baroni, CEO of Attain Sports. ""While our new name reflects the broader fan base, we're honored to hold on to the local traditions and spirit of the Bowie name. We like to refer to it as Bowie, the home of the Chesapeake Baysox."" Attain Sports purchased the Baysox prior to the 2022 season and its portfolio also includes a Maryland team one rung below Bowie in the Baltimore system, the High-A Aberdeen IronBirds. The Orioles farm system also includes the Single-A Delmarva Shorebirds and Triple-A Norfolk Tides, in Maryland and Virginia respectively. No other MLB organization has all of its affiliates clustered in such close proximity to the parent club. ""The nice thing about having access to digital data, now we can actually understand who our fans are and where they're coming from,"" Baroni said. ""The 2024 season, for example, we welcomed fans from 378 zip codes all of Maryland's 23 counties. Beyond that, we welcomed fans from 1,733 zip codes, from 42 states."" The Chesapeake Baysox logos were created by Baltimore-based Younts Design, whose clients over the years have included a variety of professional baseball teams (including the Orioles). The new primary logo features a blue crab waving the Maryland state flag, which is affixed to a baseball bat. Separate wordmarks for both Chesapeake and Baysox depict rolling waves, while an alternate ""B"" logo"" also features rolling waves. ""It was intentionally designed to include the things that relate to this region,"" said Baroni. ""The Bay-inspired waves, the audacious crab, the bat. Everything that embraces the region is how Younts and our sports marketing came up with this branding identity."" Friday's unveiling marked the start of a new era for the Baysox, with Baroni hinting at more changes to come. ""The [ballpark] experience is not only going to reflect the new team identity, but also strengthening the fan connection,"" he said. ""Great baseball, affordable family entertainment, deepening our partnerships with the community. Those kind of themes are going to resonate, and [fans] are going to see visual connection with those strategic priorities for us.""",2024-11-22,1,0.45,0.55

The freshly dubbed SoxFest Live is scheduled to take place on Friday and Saturday, January 24-25, at the historic Ramova Theatre in Chicago’s Bridgeport neighborhood, located a half mile from Guaranteed Rate Field. The event will run from 5-9 p.m. CT on both nights. The White Sox held a season-ticket holder only event at the Field Museum last offseason, but this is the first SoxFest open to everyone since January 2020 at McCormick Place. “We were excited to bring it back and introduce a new concept,” White Sox senior director of public relations Sheena Quinn told MLB.com of the event’s return and reconfiguration. “When we were talking about the idea of SoxFest, we were like, ‘Let’s do it in a different way, let’s reimagine it.’ Let’s think of an experience that’s really going to give a way to connect with the White Sox organization, especially after such a difficult year.' ""We want to offer something to the fans that is going to feel different and feel something like they are totally immersed into the experience.” Friday and Saturday general admission tickets are $56, with a limited number of premium tickets for the MVP Experience at $225. That MVP Experience includes early entry to view the exclusive White Sox Black Carpet welcoming the attendees ahead of the event, access to a premium lounge area and private meet and greet session on the balcony, light food and beverage, as well as four lower-level tickets to a select 2025 White Sox home game (restrictions apply). There also will be a SoxFest Live After Party available to purchase, with the one-hour reception alongside White Sox VIPs immediately following the show. White Sox season ticket holders will have access to an exclusive SoxFest Live presale, offering specially priced tickets beginning on Tuesday, Nov. 26, at 9 a.m. CT, while supplies last. Additional information about SoxFest Live can be found at whitesox.com/SoxFestLive. So, how does SoxFest Live differ from past SoxFest experiences? The capacity will be smaller, moving from an exhibit hall floorplan to a theatre floorplan. “There will be meet-and-greets, but it’s not going to be your typical traditional autograph table setup. It’s not like scheduled autograph times,” Quinn said. “It’s more about the programming on stage and then the meet-and-greet happening throughout the theater, throughout the evening. “Meet-and greet-experiences will feel different, but it will be about meeting the players you cheer for who are wearing the uniform, or the former players and the greats they have cheered for in the past. You can take photos and get stuff signed, but it’s going to be more about meeting people. It will be different. It will be fun.” The lineup is not set, but the focus will fall upon the current White Sox roster, coaching staff and front office members, while also bringing in individuals from the 2005 World Series champions and other eras. The White Sox will celebrate the 20th anniversary of that momentous title and the 125th anniversary of the franchise during the ’25 season.

This will be Venable’s first chance to address the fans directly, and the same for Getz as general manager. “Part of the whole program is to be able to have those conversations again,” Quinn said. “The whole purpose is to be able to connect the fans to ask the questions directly to our leadership. “It’s going to be a really good opportunity for Chris and Will to be there and set the tone for what they feel is the vision for 2025 and beyond. That’s a really important point for them to communicate to fans who want to know, ‘What’s the future of the White Sox?’” To connect to White Sox fans of all ages, a Kids Camp is set for Jan. 25 at 2 p.m. CT at the Chicago Park District’s ComEd Rec Center near Pilsen. Registration is $35 and opens Tuesday with the SoxFest Live ticket sales. “The whole purpose of a winter fan event is to unofficially start the season, get ready for Spring Training, the start of the regular season and also connect people with the members of that season’s clubhouse,” Quinn said. “So, it’s a fun, engaging way to get things going.”",2024-11-22,0,0.59,0.41

This week, the NFL issued a security alert to teams and the players union warning that professional athletes across multiple sports and states were being ""increasingly targeted for burglaries by organized and skilled groups"" after being briefed by the FBI on these incidents, ABC News reported. ""Some of the burglary groups have conducted extensive surveillance on targets, including attempted home deliveries and posing as grounds maintenance or joggers in the neighborhood.

At the time both were drafted, they appeared to be core players that the team would build around. However, circumstances didn't follow that path. Barkley left the Giants as a free agent, signing with the NFC East rival Philadelphia Eagles last spring. In his first season with Philadelphia, he's rushed for 1,137 yards and eight touchdowns in 10 games, on track to post his best NFL season. Now, Jones' career with the Giants is over after he was released on Friday. The quarterback was benched in favor of Tommy DeVito and unlikely to play in the team's remaining seven games. Under that scenario, Jones asked to be let go. It's hardly the ending Giants fans envisioned for Jones after he was the team's first-round selection (No. 6 overall) in the 2019 NFL Draft. But if anyone would know how it feels to move on from the Giants after being a top draft pick, it's Barkley (No. 2 overall in 2018). Considering their similar histories with the Giants and being teammates for five seasons, it was natural to ask Barkley for his thoughts on Jones being released. Reporters covering the Eagles did just that on Friday.

Hopefully, he can find the same fresh start and success."" Jones is unlikely to get that fresh start in a reunion with Barkley in Philadelphia.

Hubbard has been one of fantasy’s best draft picks this season, but he gets the league’s toughest run defense this week. The Chiefs have allowed the league’s fewest touches (20.9), rushing yards (52.2) and fantasy points (12.8) to running backs. No RB has reached 60 rushing yards against Kansas City this season. Rookie Jonathon Brooks is set to make his NFL debut Sunday and will take away some touches, and the Panthers have a league-low 16.5-point implied team total. Hubbard admittedly may be needed this week with six byes, but expectations need to be tempered. Darnold posted an 8.4 YPA with a 12:5 TD:INT ratio over his first six games this season, but he has a 7.5 YPA with a 5:5 ratio over four games since LT Christian Darrisaw went down. Darnold has had a favorable schedule over the last month, but he gets a tough, slow-paced matchup outdoors in Chicago this week. The Bears are a run-funnel defense allowing the seventh-most EPA/rush but the second-fewest EPA/pass. Chicago has yielded the fewest fantasy points to quarterbacks and an NFL-low seven passing scores this season. Start Rome Odunze, who leads Chicago in target share (23%), catches (17), yards (233), yards per route run (1.77) and 1D/RR over four games since its bye. He gets a pass-funnel Vikings’ defense allowing the second-fewest fantasy points to RBs but the third-most to WRs. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Ridley’s fantasy day would’ve looked a lot better last week had his 51-yard touchdown not been negated by an illegal formation penalty. He’s finished top three in air yards in back-to-back weeks since Will Levis returned. In fact, Ridley leads the league in air yards, and he’s been fantasy’s WR8 over four games since DeAndre Hopkins was traded. Ridley should continue to see good volume this week against a Houston defense that’s stout against the run but ceding the eighth-most fantasy points to wide receivers. Goff has 19 touchdown passes over the last eight games, and his 9.2 YPA leads the NFL. If you’re into coverage schemes (h/t TruMedia), it may be worth noting that Goff has especially shredded man coverage this season, leading the NFL in YPA (11.9) and Passer Rating (154.3). All eight of Goff’s interceptions have come against zone coverage, which the Colts have used at the league’s second-highest rate (79.6%). Still, Goff has remained plenty productive against zone as well, getting 8.9 YPA with the third-most TD passes (nine). Goff gets a fast-paced matchup indoors, and the Lions have a league-high 30.5-point implied team total, so he should remain in fantasy lineups. Waddle is seemingly due for a breakout game any week now, but he’s averaged just 3.3 catches, 51.3 receiving yards and 0.2 TDs over six games with Tua Tagovailoa this season. He’d be fantasy’s WR49 for the season over that span (7.9 fantasy points per game). Waddle ranks 65th in fantasy points per route run this year. The Dolphins have a healthy projected total (27.5 points), and Christian Gonzalez figures to shadow Tyreek Hill. However, Waddle has a lowly 16.2% air yards share, a 0.14 TPRR and a 0.28 XFP/RR versus man coverage this season, which New England has used at the league’s third highest rate (40.6%). The Patriots are also one of the few teams that didn’t utilize two-high heavily against the Dolphins last season, and Waddle has seen a -25.7% FP/RR reduction versus single-high since last season. This might be a monster week for Hill. Mike Evans is set to return this week but expect White and Irving to lead Tampa Bay’s offense. Since Week 6, Irving has been fantasy’s RB23 (points per game), and White has been the RB8. The Buccaneers are six-point home favorites (with a 24.5-point implied team total) coming out of their bye against a Giants franchise starting Tommy DeVito for financial reasons, so game script should be favorable. New York has been gashed for the league’s highest EPA/rush over the last month, and the Giants have allowed the most schedule-adjusted rushing fantasy points to RBs over the last five games. They’ve ceded an NFL-high 5.3 YPC this season. There’s some concern Sean Tucker also gets more involved, but he’s been a complete afterthought since his big game in Week 6. Both Irving and White can be started with confidence this week. Robinson saw 17 opportunities during his return last week, including a goal-line score. He ranks top 10 in rushing TDs (seven) this season despite missing three games thanks to heavy red zone work. Robinson is off the injury report this week, so hopefully he’s closer to 100%. The Cowboys have been gashed for NFL-highs in EPA/rush and rushing touchdowns while allowing the third-most fantasy points to running backs. Washington has this week’s second highest implied team total (28.5 points) and are double-digit home favorites against a reeling Cowboys team, so game-script should be highly favorable. Robinson has averaged 5.5 YPC at home this season and is a strong fantasy start this week. Nix ranks fourth in fantasy points per game and third in catchable throw rate since Week 5. He’s the QB4 in expected fantasy points on the season, and Nix barely threw downfield earlier in the year. Moreover, the Broncos suddenly ran motion during 60% of their dropbacks last week after entering last in motion usage; Nix went 17-of-19 for 230 yards (12.1 YPA) with a 4:0 TD:INT ratio during those plays. He gets a matchup indoors this week against a Raiders’ defense allowing the eighth-most fantasy points to QBs and dealing with multiple injuries in their secondary. Nate Hobbs, Jack Jones and Jakorian Bennett haven’t practiced through Thursday this week, so Las Vegas may be down three starting corners. Nix looks like a top-five fantasy QB once again this week. Jennings has averaged 119.7 receiving yards and 29.3 FPG over three games without either Brandon AIyuk or Deebo Samuel Sr.; both marks would lead the NFL this season. His 42% first-read target rate over that span would rank second in the league this year. Jennings has averaged more fantasy points per route run than Justin Jefferson this season, and he ranks top five in 1D/RR. We are getting the 2023 version of Aiyuk from Jennings, who’s replaced BA in San Francisco’s “X” role. Green Bay will be missing corner Jaire Alexander, and Samuel Sr. simply hasn’t looked the same while recovering from pneumonia. Brock Purdy is out with a shoulder injury, which means Brandon Allen gets the start in Week 12. It’s a definite downgrade for Jennings, who’s now more like a top-30 WR this week. Harrison Jr. started to finally run more crossing routes before Arizona’s bye, and hopefully, MHJ gets the proverbial rookie bump coming out of it. Harrison Jr. ranks seventh in air yards share (41.1%) and eighth in end-zone targets — tied with Ja’Marr Chase and CeeDee Lamb. Harrison Jr. has faced the league’s fifth-toughest WR schedule up until now (his QB has faced the toughest), but the rookie wideout gets the fourth easiest moving forward. Harrison Jr. has produced the second-most fantasy points per route run against press this season, which Seattle has used at the league’s fifth-highest rate. The Seahawks have also allowed the fifth-most fantasy points over expected to WRs this season. Kyler Murray got 9.1 YPA over his last three games before Arizona’s bye against three top pass defenses, so the Cardinals’ offense has upside. Harrison Jr. is a top 15 WR in this fast-paced matchup. Stafford has averaged 296.4 passing yards, 2.2 TDs and 19.0 fantasy points (~QB7) in games with Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua this season; he’s averaged 215.0 passing yards, 0.4 TDs and 8.9 fantasy points (~QB40) without them (h/t FTN). And Nacua was ejected from one of those games early. Stafford is also due for further touchdown regression, as he leads the league in end-zone targets (33) but is tied for just 12th in TD passes. That said, fantasy managers should at least explore alternatives this week with the Rams facing an Eagles’ defense that’s allowed a 2:5 TD:INT ratio since Week 4. A league-low 18.7% of the passing plays against Philadelphia have gained 10+ yards over that span. The Eagles have allowed just one wide receiver (Ja’Marr Chase) to rank higher than the WR40 in weekly scoring since Week 4. Philadelphia has ceded an NFL-low 19.3 yards per drive over the last two months. A shootout is possible here, but Stafford is up against the league’s hottest defense. Gus Edwards has taken 30% of the rush attempts since returning, while Hassan Haskins has stolen 46% of the attempts inside the five-yard line. Dobbins will retain fantasy value with a still healthy role in a good offense, but he’s averaged just 3.7 YPC since Week 2 and gets a difficult matchup Monday night. The Ravens have allowed the second-fewest RB rushing yards per game (61.1) and an NFL low 3.4 YPC this season. Baltimore has been vulnerable to receiving backs, but Dobbins has averaged just 2.0 targets this month. Fantasy managers may be unable to sit Dobbins with so many byes this week, but his expectations should be lowered. Start Quentin Johnston, who led Chargers’ WRs in snap share (81%) and had career highs in targets (eight) and air yards (165) last week. He’s been a busted coverage merchant at times, but Johnston also has the fourth-most receiving touchdowns (six) among all pass catchers this season. Ravens’ opponents have averaged by far the most pass attempts (39.5) this year, so Johnston is a top-25 WR this week.",2024-11-22,1,0.36,0.64

As such, I’m going to break down each game on the slate into three categories: Binge, Stream and Skip. Games you want to “binge” are like the show you can’t miss; you’re watching as soon as it goes live and might just crush all the episodes in one weekend. These are the start-all-your-guys fantasy games and ones with season-defining storylines. Games you want to “stream” are like the shows you certainly watch start to finish, but perhaps you’re finishing it over time instead of one shot. While these games might not feature a ton of “must-starts,” we can pick and choose our spots, and the teams are likely to matter in the NFL playoff picture. Lastly, the games you want to “skip” are like the shows you’re leaning toward passing on, but you might catch an episode here and there (or might stick to reading recaps online to stay up with the culture). There will be a non-obvious player or two who stands out in these games, but overall, they aren’t the best environment for fantasy football. Let’s dive into my Week 12 Fantasy Football Viewer’s Guide. We are looking at a significant referendum game on Sunday Night Football between two NFC teams, particularly when the Rams have the ball. The Eagles defense is No. 1 in EPA per play and success rate allowed since they returned from a Week 5 bye. They’ve received so many excellent performances from young players at all three levels. Linebacker Nakobe Dean has stabilized a long-problematic position on the Eagles defense and has formed a strong tandem with standout Zack Baun. On the front line, Jalen Carter has looked like one of the premier interior rushers in football of late. He single-handily wrecked Washington’s offense last Thursday night. Even more critical may be the play of two rookies in the secondary. Right corner Quinyon Mitchell has been a premier coverage player on the outside. He’s played lock-down man coverage and rarely gets caught in zone. Mitchell will get a tough challenge in Puka Nacua, whom I think looks like a leveled-up player this year when playing the ball in tight coverage. All the motion the Rams throw at opponents makes it challenging for one player to cover Nacua a majority of his routes. That could make this a bigger challenge for Mitchell than some of the other receivers he’s locked down this season. Per PFF, Cooper DeJean has taken 277 of 443 snaps this year as the slot corner. It’s hard to say what's been more impressive about DeJean: his tackling, or coverage from the slot. Both skills will be needed against Cooper Kupp in Week 12. Kupp isn’t the same player from his 2021 season but he still reads zone coverage extremely well and is as reliable as any receiver. The way he works on option routes makes him a chore to cover. DeJean will need to bring his A-game. For all the good players the Eagles have in coverage and some of the advantages the Rams bring to the table in the receiver room, this game will be won and lost up front. According to Next Gen Stats, Philadelphia has recorded the fourth-fastest average time to pressure (2.56 seconds) this season and has converted 24.8% of their pressures into sacks, the second-highest rate in the NFL. The Rams have allowed pressure in 2.51 seconds on average in 2024, the fastest in the league. If the Rams can’t block it up, this game could turn troubling quickly. Matthew Stafford’s 54.1 passer rating under pressure is among the lowest in football this season — that's the same territory as Will Levis and Caleb Willams; not ideal company. If Carter and co. take over the game up front, they can win this game. On the other side, the Rams defense has stepped up on the front line. Their young pass rushers make this defense tough to play against and they rank third in rushing success rate allowed since Week 8. Stopping Saquon Barkley will be priority No. 1 and that pass rush has to win early and often. For all the good play up front, the secondary still has its holes. The Rams defense can’t allow A.J. Brown to run loose down the field. If he hits those trademark big plays and the Eagles get ahead on the scoreboard, their pass rush will be in a position to take over the game. The vaunted Ravens offense stumbled last week against a difficult defense in the Pittsburgh Steelers. They won’t find a soft landing spot in Week 12 with a matchup against the Chargers. Los Angeles has been one of the most fundamentally sound defenses in the NFL. The Chargers are the fourth-bet run defense this season by rushing EPA allowed but play with some of the lightest boxes among any stop unit. You have to wonder if they change that approach with Derrick Henry and Lamar Jackson coming to town. If they don’t bring extra men into the box and stick with their usual defensive approach, the Chargers operate with two-high safeties more than almost any other unit. When Lamar Jackson faces two high defenses, he looks to push the ball downfield. Despite being the vertical X-receiver, Rashod Bateman leads the main pass-catchers with 2.79 yards per route run vs. two-high, per Fantasy Points Data. The Chargers plan of attack against Baltimore is more straightforward to map. An offense that’s been inclined to chuck it and rip the ball downfield more than almost any other unit in recent weeks should keep it rolling. The Ravens defense has been bleeding passing production all year and ranks 28th in EPA per dropback allowed. Some of their biggest issues have actually come from former All-Pro linebacker Roquan Smith, who is on the injury report this week and hasn’t played well, regardless. Smith has had issues in coverage and communication errors over the middle have haunted this defense. If the Ravens can’t defend the middle of the field, that’s an issue against the Chargers. Justin Herbert has been ultra-aggressive when ripping it in the intermediate area of the field. His two most consistent pass-catchers are Ladd McConkey and Will Dissly. The big-play slot receiver and tight end run their routes right in the sectors Baltimore has struggled to cover this season. The Cardinals come off of their bye-week to big expectations. Not only are they the No. 1 team in the NFC West through 11 weeks, but they are the top-ranked offense in EPA per play and success rate since Week 8. This scoring unit has become everything that Cardinals optimists believed they could be. Arizona has a settled offensive identity. It's a power-run team that plays an old-school style of football with heavy personnel. I don’t think we’ll see schematic changes post-bye. The two players to watch are the rookie skill-position players and their deployment. Trey Benson played on 28% and 27% of the snaps in the two weeks before the bye, a marked increase from previous contests. He also touched the ball 21 times and was effective with the ball in his hands. Benson isn’t going to unseat James Conner but adding his explosiveness would be a good change of pace. Impactful touches from Benson would go a long way to establishing his case as one of the top backup running back bench-stashes in fantasy. Marvin Harrison Jr.’s usage has much more fantasy utility. It’s not a coincidence that Arizona’s ascension to the top of the league charts offensively overlapped with tweaks in Harrison’s deployment. The Cardinals finally started to mix up the route tree Marvin Harrison Jr., as I detailed in the #ReceptionPerception Rookie Report. That's going to set him up for some nice performances coming out of the bye week. pic.twitter.com/3SmgtKji34 — Matt Harmon (@MattHarmon_BYB) November 21, 2024 The passing game is just more dangerous and consistent with Harrison running more of those intermediate routes. Kyler Murray and Harrison have developed strong chemistry on those digs and outs. If Harrison continues to see targets on those routes, he’ll become a more stable weekly bet. The Seahawks come into this game off a big win over the 49ers. Seattle is now jumbled at 5-5 with San Francisco and Los Angeles in the NFC West, so this is a critical game. Seattle still feels like a team operating under a first-year coaching staff. We’re seeing tweaks on both sides of the ball as Mike MacDonald and Ryan Grubb try to settle their units. Offensively, the biggest change in recent weeks has been the role of Jaxon Smith-Njigba. We've seen what I'll call more intentional usage for Jaxon Smith-Njigba in recent games. The fact that we got that type of deployment once again coming out of the bye and with DK Metcalf back in the lineup feels like a big deal. pic.twitter.com/p9krXPTymV — Matt Harmon (@MattHarmon_BYB) November 18, 2024 Getting a 100-yard performance with DK Metcalf in the lineup was a big deal. JSN’s 9.4 air yards per target wasn’t at the level of his outlier 17.5 from Week 9 but it still marks a change. The targets for JSN felt more intentional than in previous weeks, where he was simply a dump-off option. The second-year receiver worked in combo routes alongside Metcalf — which weaponized both players — and saw a bump in his targets on third down. That’s how you get the most out of this talented receiver. Most important 49ers storyline: The 49ers offense just lacks teeth. Their success rate and EPA metrics are still high but, without Brandon Aiyuk, peak Deebo Samuel Sr. or a fully healthy Christian McCaffrey, this unit doesn’t feel as dangerous as it once did. The plays to Jauan Jennings have been absurdly efficient but even he doesn’t offer verticality. The 49ers have to be a mistake-free, efficiency-based unit more than ever. With Brock Purdy out for this game with a shoulder injury, that just adds another layer of difficulty to a unit already finding life more challenging than usual. Most important Packers storyline: Green Bay ranked 27 out of 28 teams in neutral pass rate in Week 11. In conjunction, we saw the big receivers like Romeo Doubs and Christian Watson get a playing time bump. Watson ran a route on 70% of the dropbacks, which was his highest route participation of the season. The second tight end, Blake Sims, also saw the field more than usual. The Packers made a concerted effort to get their heavier personnel on the field and establish the run. It’s worth wondering if this is a one-week blip because of the matchup or a sign of things to come. It worked against Chicago as the Packers had the fourth-best dropback success rate and ninth-best rushing success rate among Week 11 offenses. Green Bay always leans more run-heavy than most think and any greater tilt toward the ground game would make it even more difficult to project their constantly rotating pass-catchers. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Most important Vikings storyline: The Vikings have started to back off Aaron Jones in recent weeks. He started off the season as one of the most effective rushers in the league this September but that’s not been the case of late. Jones played a whopping 92% of the snaps in Week 8 and his touches have gone down every week since. We even saw Cam Akers handle 10 rushes last week. It might not be the worst idea to keep Jones fresh by allowing Akers to take some of the grinder carries off his plate. If Jones can regain some of that explosive ability, he has a nice matchup this week. The Bears rank 23rd in rushing EPA allowed since Week 8 and have been particularly vulnerable off the edge. Jones has long been one of the premier outside runners in the game. Most important Bears storyline: You never see a playbook get a full overhaul when a team changes coordinators mid-season. You’re too far downstream to install a whole new playbook. However, you can see a new voice added a few wrinkles. Several changes were added to the Bears offensive approach that fit this variety. The first was DJ Moore’s role, which focused more on getting him in space and taking off some of the burden of downfield, low-percentage routes. There was a sizable shift in the way Thomas Brown used DJ Moore in his first game as the Bears' OC: Moore in Week 11: an average depth of target of just 0.86 yards with 56 yards after the catchMoore in Weeks 1-10: an average depth of target over 8.3 yards and 176 yards after… — Field Yates (@FieldYates) November 20, 2024 Getting the ball out of Caleb Williams’ hands was a priority, as was giving him the freedom to take off if routes weren’t open quickly. Williams added 4.63 EPA on scrambles in Week 11, the second-most among quarterbacks. Geno Smith ranked No. 1 and that’s due to running in the game-winning touchdown. We still have a long way to go with the Bears offense approaching full viability but getting Moore involved on YAC-based routes, allowing Williams to be used as a rusher and getting Rome Odunze more first-read targets will help. We saw all three in Week 11. Most important Lions storyline: Over the last two weeks, Jameson Williams has a mere 17.5% target share but has been earning the high-yield looks. His 18.9 average depth of target is the third-highest among pass-catchers with double-digit targets in that span. Williams is squarely in the role that lifts the roof off of the offense. The Colts' pass defense plays simple coverages and makes mistakes on the back end. He’s never the safest play on the board but with so many receivers on bye in Week 12, this looks like a spot to chase Williams' ceiling. Most important Colts storyline: Week 11 was without a doubt the best game of Anthony Richardson’s career. He was effective as a chain-mover and downfield passer. Josh Downs snaring an early vertical shot from the slot seemed to settle the whole offense and his young quarterback down. Those two guys have an underrated connection and it’s just not been discussed enough how little time they have playing together. The last two games with Richardson starting have been some of Downs’ best as a pro. He’s in line for another big outing in Week 12 against a Lions defense that’s really turned the corner but has a clear interior weakness. Detroit allows the most yards per game to slot receivers this season. Most important Chiefs storyline: As it turns out, the Chiefs will not get Isiah Pacheco back in time for this game and a matchup with a Panthers' run defense that’s been among the worst in the NFL. From a success rate standpoint, the Chiefs' run game has been a top-five attack with Kareem Hunt as the lead back. However, anyone with eyeballs can see Hunt has left a lot of big plays on the table due to a lack of juice. His 1.4% explosive rushing rate is the lowest among backs with 100-plus carries. When he’s healthy, Pacheco's big-play ability will make a difference on just a handful of touches in tandem with Hunt. This offense needs someone to create the explosives they aren’t getting through the air. A healthy dose of Hunt should be enough to beat the Panthers but they need Pacheco back sooner than later to weaponize this run game. Most important Panthers storyline: The Panthers will get two big players back on offense this week. In the passing game, veteran receiver Adam Thielen will get back from a stint on IR. Thielen was starting as the big slot receiver for this team in the last two seasons, but rookie Jalen Coker has given them quality reps in that position. It would be odd for a team in the Panthers’ position to take a developing rookie off the field. Whoever takes the majority of the reps in the slot has a great matchup, as Kansas City allows more production to slot receivers than almost any other defense. Rookie running back Jonathon Brooks will likely make his season debut. This will be Brooks’ first NFL action, so it would be a huge surprise if he takes a big slice of the pie away from Chuba Hubbard, who has been one of the most efficient backs in the league this season. Most important Buccaneers storyline: Mike Evans will suit up for the Buccaneers for the first time since Week 8. That Ravens loss feels like a whole different lifetime for this Bucs team. In the three games since, Cade Otton leads the team with 29 targets; running backs Rachaad White and Bucky Irving are second and third. You just don’t see many offenses that get such little output from the wide receiver position. Otton should be able to remain in his role as the power slot replacement for Chris Godwin. He’s been getting the tight coverage targets over the middle and the screen looks. Evans will immediately walk into a completely vacant role as the top perimeter pass-catcher and vertical threat. He has a chance to be a WR1 in fantasy with Baker Mayfield playing as well as he has this season. Most important Giants storyline: The Giants will start Tommy DeVito in Week 12, having released Daniel Jones in a surprise move Friday. DeVito averaged 7.2 yards per attempt throwing outside the numbers in 2023, while Jones has averaged just 4.9 yards per attempt on throws outside the numbers this season. The now-former starter’s 25.8% completion rate on throws of 20-plus yards is the second worst among qualifying quarterbacks, per PFF. Jones just leaves so many open vertical plays on the field. I’m not convinced DeVito will be an upgrade for Malik Nabers (currently dealing with a groin injury), but he’s at least willing to try to push it downfield. One reason to maybe watch: Beyond any revenge-game narratives, it bears watching Jonnu Smith in this matchup. Many fantasy gamers have been confused as to why the once-heralded Dolphins wide receivers aren’t producing near their assumed standard. Well, a big part of this development is that the Jonnu Smith plays are … really good. Since Week 8, Smith ranks sixth in team offensive success rate on his targets. Other tight ends in that area are Brock Bowers, George Kittle and Trey McBride. That’s the company Smith is keeping; good things happen when his team throws the ball in his direction. The receivers deserve credit for clearing the space for Smith to run after the catch on those looks and pile up the efficiency. However, the Dolphins don’t have much incentive to change up their volume distribution just for the sake of your fantasy teams, given the effectiveness of the overall unit. One reason to maybe watch: Jayden Daniels hasn’t just been off his game the last two weeks. Statistically, he’s been one of the most inefficient quarterbacks in the sport. Daniels ranks 24th in adjusted net yards per attempt over the last two weeks among quarterbacks with 20-plus dropbacks. He was third in Weeks 1-9. Most troubling is that Daniels’ pressure-to-sack ratio of 50% is tied with Joe Flacco for the most among quarterbacks. The offensive line hasn’t allowed a ton of pressure but Daniels has just turned almost all of those moments into negative plays. Washington has played two of the better defenses in the league in the last couple of weeks in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. Dallas operates on the other end of that spectrum but their pass rush has improved with Micah Parsons back on the field. This is a good moment for Daniels to get his Rookie of the Year campaign back on track if he can withstand the pressure from the Cowboys. One reason to maybe watch: Nico Collins only ran a route on 55.3% of the team dropbacks, falling in behind both Tank Dell and John Metchie III. Obviously, he is the team’s best receiver and we should expect that number to push toward 80% when he’s fully ramped up. Does that start this week? The Texans need it. The Titans aren’t a great team, but their defense presents some problems, especially in terms of creating interior pressure. Houston has been one of the worst teams in football at picking up blitzes and blocking up stunts. If those issues creep up, C.J. Stroud will need Collins available as the quick answer. One reason to maybe watch: The Broncos are a good team. The Raiders sink this game into the doldrums of the week. We’re keeping an eye on the weekly Bo Nix ascension. There's some real staying power to the Bo Nix production. As @Nate_Tice and I highlight here, he's not making mistakes and executing a well-designed offense. pic.twitter.com/hnAG2FghSZ — Matt Harmon (@MattHarmon_BYB) November 21, 2024 Nix is executing the Broncos offense. That unit is much better designed than it was to start the season and they have some intriguing pass-catchers. Most of the Broncos wideouts are big-bodied players who can present themselves as reliable targets over the middle. That aligns well with Nix’s skill set and allows Denver to work well against zone coverage. Courtland Sutton is the only fantasy starter of the bunch but the rest of the big receivers help lift the floor of the passing attack. I’ve even enjoyed how Sean Payton has mixed Marvin Mims Jr. into the equation as a gadget receiver and designed rusher. Denver should be able to clear this Raiders team with ease if its claim to the AFC’s playoff push is legitimate.",2024-11-22,1,0.41,0.59

Smith is coming off his best week of the season. In Week 10, Smith produced 100 yards and two touchdowns on eight targets against the Raiders. Smith has now earned six or more targets in five of his last six games. This is something only three other tight ends have done during this stretch. Smith now leads the Dolphins since Week 5 with a 21% target share. He also ranks third in yards per route run and second in yards after the catch among TEs during this time. Smith is a great bye week filler for Week 12. But there’s a chance he’s much more than that. He’s been a top-two option in the Dolphins passing attack the past two months. Smith is closing in on being ranked as a top-10 TE the rest of the season. This week he takes on the Patriots, who rank bottom 10 in coverage according to PFF. You can pick up and play Smith this week. Swift had another strong fantasy day in Week 11. He was able to produce 80+ yards for the sixth time in his last seven games. Since Week 4, Swift ranks sixth in fantasy points per game among all backs. That’s how good he’s been. But it wasn’t all good news for Swift in Week 11. His underlying usage actually got worse under new play-caller Thomas Brown. Backup Roschon Johnson saw a season-high 44% of the snaps and handled 100% of the two-minute offense snaps and the majority of the goal-line touches. This led to Swift seeing just 48% of the backfield carries, his second-lowest mark in a game this year. That’s not great, and neither is his matchup this week against the Vikings. Minnesota allows the second-fewest rushing yards per play and just limited the Titans backfield to 15 yards on 12 carries in Week 11. It’s tough to sit Swift with six teams on bye, but temper your expectations in this difficult matchup. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Irving returns from his bye this week and finds himself in a great matchup. The Bucs are 5-point favorites against Tommy DeVito and the Giants. There’s a good chance New York falls behind in this game, which sets up a positive game script for Irving to see more carries. But it gets even better because the Giants struggle to defend the run. New York allows the most rushing yards per play this season according to NFL Pro. The Giants also allow the third most explosive runs of 10+ yards this season. This is the ideal matchup for Irving who has generated an explosive run at the 12th highest rate in the league. Irving also averages 5.6 yards per touch this season and ranks third in broken tackle rate. He’s coming off a strong performance in Week 10 against the 49ers where he totaled 87 yards and a touchdown on 16 touches. Expect this efficiency to continue in a strong matchup this week against the Giants and there’s even a chance we see his role increase coming out of the bye week. Don’t be shocked to see the rookie earn the first 20-carry game of his career. Robinson Jr. had one of the tougher matchups a running back can find last week, facing the Eagles' No. 1 ranked defense on a short week. Despite this difficult spot, Robinson was able to produce over 70 total yards and a touchdown. The most impressive part was this was Robinson’s first game back from both a hamstring and knee injury. He returned from these injuries and took back his role as the Commander clear RB1 earning 67% of the backfield carries, his second-best usage on the season. Robinson enters Week 12 with a much better matchup against the Cowboys. Dallas ranks 30th in run defense according to PFF and allows the fourth-most fantasy points per game to the position. Expect Robinson to carry the ball 16+ times and push towards 100 yards and a score. He’s a must-start RB this week. Jennings continues to operate as the 49ers' No. 1 receiver. In Week 11, he led the team with 10 catches for 91 yards and a score. He was consistently Brock Purdy’s first read in crucial situations. Jennings earned six of his 11 targets on third down last week. This is the money down in the NFL — the down where you lean on your best and most trusted player, and lately, that’s been Jennings for the 49ers. In three games this season with either Brandon Aiyuk or Deebo Samuel Sr. out, Jennings has averaged 11.3 targets and 116 yards per game. He’s never seen fewer than 11 targets in any of these three contests and is the number one fantasy receiver across those three weeks. This is still a small sample size, but it’s becoming clear that Jennings is the 49ers' No. 1 receiver ahead of Samuel. This week, Jennings faces a Packers secondary that may not have cornerback Jaire Alexander and just allowed Caleb Williams to complete 74% of his passes last week. Jennings is a borderline top-12 receiver this week and for the rest of the season. Make sure he’s in your lineup, even without Brock Purdy under center as he works through a shoulder injury. We have six teams on bye this week. Some top quarterbacks like Josh Allen and Joe Burrow are not available for fantasy managers. A bye-week filler is needed, and the perfect option is Drake Maye. Maye has finished as a top-10 QB in two of his five completed starts this season and has never finished worse than the QB18 on a given week. This is impressive for a rookie QB but it’s even more impressive when you factor in his top receiver has been Kayshon Boutte, and he plays behind arguably the worst offensive line in the league. Not to mention, Maye had to face the Titans and Bears defenses in two out of his last three games. Both teams rank top five at limiting opposing passing efficiency. But despite these tough matchups, Maye was able to find success. He completed 71% of his passes against the Titans and averaged a season-high 7.4 yards per attempt against the Bears. Maye is also coming off one of his better outings of the season where he completed 75% of his passes for 309 total yards and two touchdowns against the Rams in Week 11. His composure under pressure and strong rushing upside make him a solid start this week, even if the matchup isn’t the best against the Dolphins. If you need help at QB this week, pick up and play Maye as your bye-week filler. Ridley earned just four catches for 58 yards last week against the Vikings. This was his first game below 70 yards or eight targets since DeAndre Hopkins was traded to the Chiefs. Entering Week 11, Ridley was averaging an elite 36% target share and 100 yards per game in the three games since Hopkins left the team. Ridley came back down to earth in Week 11, but he still earned a team-high 22% target share. This week, Ridley is looking to bounce back against the Texans as an eight-point underdog. The Titans should trail often in this one which sets up nicely for Ridley to see more passing volume. Believe it or not, Will Levis has been solid since returning from injury. In Week 10 against the Chargers, he completed 78% of his passes and posted a top-10 fantasy finish. Then in Week 11, Levis produced 295 yards while averaging 9.5 yards per attempt. His play has been much better than what we got earlier this season. The improved quarterback play, and game script, have Ridley set up for a strong bounce back in Week 12. Evans is expected to return from injury this week. He’s missed the past three games with a hamstring injury that he reaggravated in Week 7 against the Ravens. Evans will return to face a Giants secondary that ranks 16th in coverage this season according to PFF. This is by no means a bad secondary, but they aren’t great either. New York allows the seventh most explosive plays on defense this season and that sets up nicely for Evans who has eight deep targets across five completed starts. Evans has finished as a top-10 receiver in three of his five completed starts and he’s earned a strong 23% target share in these five contests. But this should only increase now that Chris Godwin is out for the year. Godwin earned a 27% target share this season and with him off the field, Evans should threaten for 10+ targets. That starts this week in a fine matchup against the Giants, but the good matchups will continue the rest of the year. Evans will face the Panthers twice, the Raiders and the Cowboys over the next six weeks. All of these teams rank in the bottom 10 in secondary play this season according to NFL Pro. Evans is trending up at the perfect time as the fantasy playoffs approach. Jones entered Week 11 battling a rib injury. This was the fourth time this season he had picked up an injury that would go on to limit him or keep him out of practice the following week. Jones was limited in practice heading into Week 11 but was able to play on Sunday. However, he saw his worst usage in a completed game this season earning just 55% of the snaps and 50% of the rush attempts. Cam Akers was more involved for the Vikings in Week 11, turning 12 touches into 36 yards and a touchdown. Jones was likely limited in this game due to his rib injury, but there’s also a chance the Vikings try to lighten his load moving forward. He’s turning 30 next month and has already battled injuries to his ribs, hamstring, hip and ankle this season. Week 11 has created plenty of questions for fantasy managers of Jones entering Week 12. Will his usage improve with another week of rest and recovery? Will Cam Akers remain heavily involved? This week against the Bears should answer a lot of these questions about Jones' role the rest of the season. He’s still a top-20 RB this week, but I’d start Chuba Hubbard, Rhamondre Stevenson and Brian Robinson Jr. over him right now.",2024-11-22,0,0.55,0.45

The Golden State superstar explained on the latest episode of ""Dubs Talk"" how remarkable Hield’s work ethic has been since joining the team over the summer. “It’s like when [Kevin Durant] came and you see how a guy at the top of the list of a certain skillset, you see how they work,” Curry told NBC Sports Bay Area’s Monte Poole and Dalton Johnson. “Watching Buddy, I know he talks about me. I know there’s a clip where he was doing a post-practice interview and he was like, ‘Y'all are interrupting my time to watch Steph shoot.’ I do the exact same thing with him. “I will fully admit he shoots way more shots than I do in practice. It’s not even close. The volume is insane. And it’s something I never really knew was part of his routine.” Hield has developed into one of the NBA's elite long-range shooters and has made more 3-pointers than any other NBA player over the past five seasons. His addition to the Warriors has lessened Klay Thompson's departure, giving Golden State another scoring option off the bench. For Curry, it's Hield’s approach to shooting that has impressed him the most so far. “He's a workaholic, he’s a gym rat, he loves to get shots up until it feels right,” Curry told Poole and Johnson. “I’m a little bit more calculated about the intensity and where I’m getting shots. So, it’s kind of cool to see two different approaches. We’re motivating each other in that respect. I did it with Klay for 13 years and now I have a new running mate to push me.” The “Splash Buddies” pairing has worked out exceedingly well for Golden State. The team is off to a 9-2 start on the season thanks to some lethal shooting from the duo. The 31-year-old is averaging 16.6 points per game, the second most in the NBA among bench players. Meanwhile, Curry continues to be one of the best players on the planet, capable of taking over games and willing the Warriors to victory. While there is no replicating the magic of the Curry-Thompson pairing, Hield is doing a more than admirable job in his first season with the Warriors.

Turbo-charged Justin Herbert. Derrick Henry screen pass wrinkles. Lamar Jackson advantages vs. the Chargers' defense. Nate Tice breaks down one of the biggest games of Week 12.,"John and Jim Harbaugh face off as the Ravens take on the Chargers in Los Angeles on Monday Night Football this week. (You can join me and fellow Yahoo Sports NFL writer Charles McDonald for the game in the new Discussion tool in the Yahoo Sports app. Here's how.) The Chargers are surging behind disciplined and well-coached units on either side of the ball, while the Ravens are thriving with an explosive offense (that hit its yearly Steelers speed bump) and a defense that’s stout against the run but is susceptible to big plays through the air. Heading full steam ahead into this season’s HarBowl (something we might get more frequently with both brothers now coaching teams in the AFC), I wanted to take this week’s Football 301 Playbook to break down the surprising Chargers and how their matchup with the Ravens looks this week. I hope you’re sitting down when reading this, because what I’m about to say might be shocking: The Chargers under Jim Harbaugh like to run the ball and use play action. Ol’ Jimmy and offensive coordinator Greg Roman aren’t exactly subverting their reputation in their first year in Los Angeles. The Chargers rank fifth in designed rush rate on early downs and have the highest rate of play action on early downs as well. While this is Harbaugh’s (and the Harbaugh-adjacent Roman’s) tried and true formula, the Chargers haven’t exactly been effective when running the ball. They currently sit 30th in early down success rate on running back runs, with their 29.7% rate sitting well below the NFL’s average of 36.1% on such plays. Even if you look at splits between the halves of games or over the past six weeks, the Chargers still rank among the league’s worst in terms of success rate. There have still been flashes with this run game in between their 1- and 2-yard ventures. A healthier J.K. Dobbins (who is facing his old team this game) has had some real flashes, popping big runs in key moments when the Chargers are closing out games in the second half. (While they haven’t been efficient, the Chargers do rank more in the middle of the pack in explosive RB runs this season, and eighth in explosive run rate in the second half of games.) This is a reminder of the talent of the oft-injured Dobbins and that there is still life with these runs as the game goes along. It’s something that has popped in multiple Chargers games this year, including this past Sunday night against the Bengals as Dobbins delivered the knockout punch late in the fourth quarter.

Watch him reading the LB flow here and cutting back this gap run. https://t.co/qrcKscjWym pic.twitter.com/jtUybhvdEO — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) October 15, 2024 This can lead to frustrating sequences for the Chargers, who rank 26th in average distance to go on third downs, and their all-world QB to overcome (more on him in a second), but it’s something I attribute more to their interior offensive line play than any particular bad play designs. Their run game is varied (a little more window dressing wouldn’t hurt), featuring plenty of gap schemes with pulling linemen and tight ends, often out of bigger personnel groupings. big boy Counter from the Chargers. It's so pretty. https://t.co/M1CyWjcoiY pic.twitter.com/5gzO7CCmCh — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) October 15, 2024 There have been sequences in games where you can see the Chargers find a play that an opposing defense simply cannot stop, like running a zone play against the Titans over and over with their fullback/defensive lineman Scott Matlock leading the way. (Travis Hunter who?) Chargers with a beautiful rep of lead zone. Watch Zion Johnson (#77) & FB Scott Matlock (#44) on this one. pic.twitter.com/5RmNSug9VF — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 11, 2024 So, while I do have positives to say about the designs and intent, the truth is this offense still leaves Herbert in plenty of tough situations when the Chargers have to drop back and pass. And Herbert, despite statistics that are more middle of the road when looking league-wide, has been playing some of the best and most aggressive football of his career. On early downs, the Chargers are able to stay explosive because of their steady diet of play-action concepts, with Herbert not shying away from launching throws to players like tight end Will Dissly — not exactly a burner — for touchdowns. good morning pic.twitter.com/v3NWCK1lND — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 21, 2024 Play-action concepts that the Chargers feature naturally attack down the field, and Herbert has been seeking more downfield throws than ever but still without making mistakes (just one interception on the season so far). His air yards per pass attempt sits at 8.6, over a full yard more than his career average of 7.4 yards entering this season and tied for eighth (with Lamar Jackson) among all qualifying QBs this season. These play-action concepts allow Herbert to show off his arm and ball placement. Every throw and part of the field is available to him on any type of concept. These help shore up a leaky interior offensive line as well as put less demands on pass catchers to win with their route running. Just get downfield and Justin will launch a laser into your facemask. This newfound aggressive Justin Herbert has also shown up when he runs the ball. Herbert is scrambling more than ever, looking to make plays with his legs rather than check the ball down or try to find the “perfect” answer. His scramble rate of 6.3% would be a career high, according to NextGenStats, and sits above the league average. He’s also looking for explosive plays when he runs the ball. Whether it’s the fourth down designed run against the Titans or scrambling against the Bengals. Herbert wants to inflict damage as a runner. Which is a scary sight for defenders to see a 6-foot-6, nearly 240-pound human who can max out at over 20 mph coming at them. 4th down ➡️ TOUCHDOWNJustin Herbert runs it in for the @Chargers score!📺: #TENvsLAC on FOX📱: https://t.co/waVpO909ge pic.twitter.com/V0nWnLI19S — NFL (@NFL) November 10, 2024 Herbo? https://t.co/LIuw7CAqhz pic.twitter.com/DNkYtUzUZ1 — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 10, 2024 Justin Herbert is crossing defenders up now pic.twitter.com/1KXjJDu1lu — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 11, 2024 This is Justin Herbert with a Jim Harbaugh symbiote attached to him. Herbert feels like he has a little more venom with his play this year. Gone are the quick game concepts from former OC Joe Lombardi that neutered Herbert’s S-tier arm talent. Instead, Herbert is seeking to push the ball whenever he can, even with less-than-ideal personnel around him. It’s not surprising that Herbert’s sack rate has jumped up a bit this season because of the asks of the offense, but his sack avoidance still remains one of his best attributes, and he continues to frustrate defenders with his ability to get throws off despite being in their grasp. And when things aren’t clean (which they still aren’t a decent amount of the time), Herbert is still overcoming subpar circumstances to deliver big throws ...

McConkey looks like a real deal No. 1 receiver who can win from the slot or on the outside (my pre-draft comparison for him was Emmanuel Sanders). McConkey is dealing with an injury this week, so it remains to be seen what his health is against the Ravens, but even the unwavering confidence that Herbert has with other players like Dissly and Quentin Johnston, who has greatly improved after his rough rookie year, has been showing up as well. And not once did we ever hear about Justin Herbert’s high ankle sprain hindering his play. Funny how that only comes up with certain QBs. The Ravens' defense will continue to be tough sledding for the Chargers on the ground. Baltimore is Guinness-like in its stoutness against the run, currently ranking second in EPA allowed per RB run while yielding the lowest explosive run rate in the NFL. The Ravens have only allowed six explosive runs (gains of 12 yards or more) this entire season. For comparison, the NFL average is 17.4 and the Commanders lead the league in this category with 29. The Chargers are going to have to turn to those play-action concepts on early downs and Herbert hero ball on late downs. The Ravens are below-average defending early down play action and are overall susceptible to explosive plays through the air. Very susceptible, I should say; Baltimore currently allows the third-highest rate of explosive passes this season, often because of communication errors on the back end of their defense. The spine of the defense could even be further weakened if linebacker Roquan Smith doesn’t play. Smith has taken a step back this season, but him dealing with a hamstring injury and potentially missing this week could make this weakness even more glaring. Harbaugh and Roman have an insistence to not mess with their run-first formula, which I get considering their personnel. But if there was a game to drop Herbert back more frequently and let him rip, this is it. This side of the ball is a true strength-on-strength. The Chargers' defense playing so well under Jesse Minter has been one of the pleasant surprises of the season. This unit ranks near the top of every metric you look at. And even despite facing several toothless offenses this season, it still ranks 10th in FTNFantasy’s DVOA metric that adjusts for opponent. Star veterans Joey Bosa, Khalil Mack, and Derwin James look like their old selves (when healthy, at least), with James providing impact plays every game from the slot, especially as a blitzer. Free agent additions Poona Ford and Teair Tart have shored up an interior defensive line that had been one of the biggest weak points in the entire NFL over the past few seasons. Teair Tart (#90) was constantly disruptive against the Bengals.Tart doesn't always fill up the boxscore, but he's been playing well all year. One of the several veteran Chargers defenders that have been rejuvenated this season.(Plus there's some Daiyan Henley) pic.twitter.com/xrjAn9kItb — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 20, 2024 Young players Tuli Tuipulotu (six pressures against the Bengals) and Daiyan Henley have leveled up this season and continue to get better every week. Henley in particular has been a revelation in this defense. Chargers get to a unconventional Cover 2 look. Jameis Winston actually works to the right spot but watch #0 Daiyan Henley drop from the LOS into the throwing lane. pic.twitter.com/TFqy92Gszj — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 5, 2024 Even non-star starters like linebacker Denzel Perryman have been playing the best ball of his career. This Chargers defense plays sound, with adaptable game plans that mold and shift based on their given opponent of the week. When there’s a unit punching above its weight, or seemingly getting the best out of all its contributors, it usually is indicative of the coaching and game-planning that is happening during the week on top of the work the players put into it. The Chargers' defense just feels tight. Zones tighten, coverage defenders will fall off their original assignments anticipating where the ball will likely go based on the scouted looks, defenders (always multiple) quickly rally to tackle ball carriers. Every game features a new pressure look, whether a real blitz or simulated, and pass rush plans that try to expose any weakness in the opposing team’s protection plan. Twists, loopers, slants. Games is what it’s typically called in football parlance. The Chargers throw all of these games at opposing offensive lines and pass protectors with their talented front, testing the rules and sheer ability that the opposing squad has in the trenches, in the backfield, and on the opposite sideline, poking and poking and hoping something will pop. Most NFL offenses simply don’t have the competence to hold up for 60-plus plays before letting some leakiness happen, and the Ravens' offensive line is no different. (On a sidenote, I’m really looking forward to seeing Ravens center Tyler Linderbaum against Ford and Tart.) On early downs, the Chargers run zone coverages at the second-highest rate in the NFL, with the featured coverage changing based on the matchup in this kaleidoscopic scheme. Often you will see Chargers defenders jumping to change their leverage when defending passing plays, sometimes in ways that seem unorthodox. This is a sign of a well-coached and well-scouted unit that knows how to pinpoint an opponent's tendencies. That works very well against teams lacking high-end talent, but can be preyed upon against teams that can execute or have a deeper bag of tricks to get to (like the Bengals in Week 11). The heavy use of zone coverages makes even more sense when you consider the personnel for the Chargers. This unit’s strength is along their front and not with their cornerbacks. Despite blitzing at the eighth-lowest rate on early downs, the Chargers rank third in pressure rate. Bosa, Mack, and Tuipulotu are a formidable group of pass rushers to deal with. When you drop in other strong contributors like Tart and Morgan Fox, the Chargers can bring heat after the QB without having to throw extra bodies at the problem. The Chargers lean into zone, make QBs work to find an answer, hope their pass rush can get home and also mitigate any coverage disadvantages they might have on the back end. It’s not to say that they don’t blitz at all. The Chargers like to throw in funkier looks on true passing downs like second-and-long or on third down when they want to create more chaos, and they bring pressure at around a league average rate on late downs. But given Lamar Jackson has been the best QB against the blitz this year, that blitz rate will be unlikely to climb after this week. (Jackson is 78 for 111 for 1,091 yards, 10 touchdowns and two interceptions against the blitz this season. He’s generated 50.1 EPA when teams bring five or more pass rushers. Jared Goff ranks second at 36.1.) The Chargers' soundness carries over when defending QB designed runs. They haven’t been tested with many, but when playing QBs like Kyler Murray, the Chargers defenders did a great job in staying disciplined against read plays. There is a tradeoff here when playing such specific zone coverages that will put multiple eyeballs on receiver route patterns: scrambles. The Chargers rank 27th in the amount of EPA they’ve allowed to QB scrambles this season and have allowed the third-most scramble yards per game, only behind the Jaguars and Giants. Because the Chargers like to match their coverages and will bracket receivers on passing downs (with a corner and safety essentially double-teaming one player), the opposing QB has chances to make plays with his legs if the pass rush can’t keep him contained since the coverage defenders are so focused on their assignments. Early downs against the Ravens should be really interesting, considering how devastating the Ravens have been. The Chargers make it a slog to run against, but that’s not to say you can’t catch them. They currently rank 26th in explosive run rate allowed and are going against Derrick Henry, Jackson, and a run game that can pop off at any time. The Chargers are also third against early down play action in terms of success rate allowed, which again speaks to the horses they have up front and the discipline on the back end to avoid catastrophic busts. Jackson and the Ravens are excellent on play-action plays, ranking second in success rate and EPA per dropback on early down play action concepts this season and seventh in yards per game off those passes, per TruMedia. That’s what makes this side of the ball so intriguing. The Ravens' offense is explosive, efficient, and electric. The Chargers have a talented front and are very well-coached at all three levels. There are loads of strength-on-strength areas and matchups between the two sides, which is typically entertaining because good plays will feel earned in this type of game. Both teams will mold their game plans based on the opponent, getting to their core plays in different ways or throwing in new twists for the opponent to deal with. How they use their personnel is an interesting subplot; the Ravens love trotting out their TEs and FB Patrick Ricard (they use personnel groupings with two or fewer WRs at the second-highest rate in the NFL), always threatening to steamroll a defense if they don’t want to match with bigger bodies. The Chargers, however, run dime personnel (six DBs) at the second-highest rate in the NFL and the highest rate when opposing offenses have two or fewer WRs on the field (14.5%, and no other defense is above 5%). And, somewhat counterintuitively, they’ve been good at defending bigger offensive personnel groupings too, which again speaks to the adaptability, effort, and execution this entire unit has played with this season. I will be curious if the Ravens decide to use Henry on a RB screen once or twice in this game as a way to slow down the pass rush, and also since it’s such a strength of Henry’s juggernaut-like running style. The Chargers, again because of their hyper-focused coverage responsibilities, have been susceptible to big plays against RB screens this season. They have only faced nine so far, but have allowed gains of 15, 37, 18, and 33 yards on those plays. Henry had 23 screen receptions in his last two seasons in Tennessee, with those going for 341 yards at a crisp 14.8 yards per play. Henry has only been used on two screens so far this season, but those gains have, of course, gone for 27 and 23 yards. Look for this as a way to catch the Chargers in one of their defensive line games and heavy zone coverages, giving Henry some space underneath. The Chargers under Jim Harbaugh have completely reflected his personality, and it’s palpable when you watch them. They play tough, they play hard, they play smart, and they play disciplined, with players on both sides of the ball playing to their fullest (and a few stars dropped in). They’ve benefitted from a not-particularly-difficult schedule so far, but have shown up against the better units and teams when they have faced them. And they also have a QB playing at a high level and more aggressive than ever. The Ravens also have one of those high-level QBs, one of the best offenses in the game and a defense that has real strengths (but a few glaring weaknesses). Chargers fans were as loud as I have ever heard them this past weekend against the Bengals on Sunday night. This Monday night HarBowl has plenty of reasons to crank those decibels up even more.",2024-11-22,0,0.58,0.42
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Cubs' top 5 offseason questions: How does Cody Bellinger fit? And which free-agent pitchers will Chicago target?,https://sports.yahoo.com/cubs-top-5-offseason-questions-how-does-cody-bellinger-fit-and-which-free-agent-pitchers-will-chicago-target-202659637.html,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 20:26:59 GMT","The Cubs need help in the rotation and the bullpen, and they have a lot to sort out with their position players.","No matter how you slice it, the Chicago Cubs were one of the most disappointing teams of 2024. Improved play in the second half enabled a winning record and a second-place finish in the NL Central, but the Cubs finished six games out of a wild-card spot and a whopping 10 games behind the rival Brewers. At this time a year ago — before our collective focus shifted to star players such as Shohei Ohtani and Juan Soto — the baseball industry was in shock following the Cubs’ ultra-aggressive maneuver to hire manager Craig Counsell away from Milwaukee with a five-year, $40 million deal, the largest contract ever given to a big-league skipper. That Milwaukee then ran away with the division while the Cubs were stuck in the mud for much of Counsell’s first season at the helm only made Chicago’s uninspiring campaign that much more frustrating. The Cubs have not reached the postseason since Jed Hoyer assumed the top front office role after Theo Epstein departed following the 2020 season, and they haven't won a postseason game since 2017. Considering the talent on the roster and the massive commitment made to Counsell, such shortcomings can be tolerated for only so much longer. This organization must find a way to reestablish itself as a legitimate contender in the National League, and quickly. Here are the five biggest questions facing the Cubs this winter. “Anytime a really good player decides to stay with you, that's good news,” Hoyer said earlier this month after Bellinger’s decision to pass on another round of free agency and pick up his player option to stay with the Cubs for $27.5 million in 2025. “It mostly just gives us clarity,” he added. “Now we know what our roster looks like, and now we can go about building a team. Before that, there was some uncertainty.” Hoyer’s sentiment is reasonable on its face and an understandable one to share publicly. But there are two issues. For one, Bellinger’s second season in Chicago brought into question just how good of a player he actually is. Bellinger practically reinvented himself as a hitter in his first year with the Cubs in 2023, drastically cutting down on his strikeouts in favor of a more high-contact approach. While he kept the strikeouts down in 2024, he provided far less power, with his SLG% dropping nearly 100 points, bringing his overall offensive contributions closer to league average. Arguably more pressing here is Bellinger’s fit defensively, as the two positions he has been known for playing brilliantly in his career — first base and center field — are occupied in Chicago by two ascendant core pieces in Michael Busch and Pete Crow-Armstrong. That means Bellinger currently projects as Chicago’s every-day right fielder, with Seiya Suzuki shifting to more of a primary DH role. While Suzuki’s bat is certainly good enough to produce like a high-level DH, Bellinger — especially at his salary — as strictly a right fielder is notably less appealing, particularly if his power production remains middling at best. Combine these two factors, and it’s unsurprising that Ken Rosenthal reported earlier this week that the Cubs are trying to trade Bellinger but are having a tough time doing so, due to both his uncertain outlook as a hitter and his contract status. Bellinger has another player option for $25M in 2026 that he could pick up next winter if he delivers another mediocre campaign, so committing to two more years of this lesser version of him is probably a tough pill for potential suitors to swallow. All of this might keep his trade value at a suboptimal level, to the point that dealing him away isn’t worth more than moving forward with him as the every-day right fielder and hoping he rediscovers some power production. Another way to look at Bellinger’s decision to opt in is how it might’ve impacted Chicago’s willingness to spend in free agency this winter. Which brings us to our next question … On a recent episode of Baseball Bar-B-Cast, ESPN insider J​​eff Passan mentioned that the sense in the industry is that the Cubs are not expected to be playing in the deepest waters of free agency this winter. Whether that is directly related to having Bellinger back in the fold at a significant salary number is undetermined, but even with Bellinger, the Cubs’ payroll is currently well below $200 million, according to Roster Resource — nowhere near the $241 million competitive balance tax line that most big-market behemoths have flirted with or blasted past in recent years. There is unquestionably room for another big-ticket addition in Chicago without needing to pay the luxury tax, if ownership demonstrates an appetite for it, but it remains to be seen if such an appetite exists. Early indications out of Boston — another massive market that has been more conservative with spending in recent years — portray a Red Sox team ready to spend aggressively and reassert itself as a premier franchise after several consecutive underwhelming seasons. One could argue that the Cubs should be acting in a similar fashion, considering their roster and recent history, but that’s not exactly the tone we’ve seen thus far. However, we’re still in the earliest stages of the offseason, and things can change quickly. If the Cubs are going to spend more than we currently anticipate, it seems likely that something will be done to address the pitching staff. On that note … Should the Cubs’ brass wake up someday soon with the ambition to chase the biggest names on the market, a pursuit of Corbin Burnes, Max Fried or Blake Snell would make plenty of sense — not to mention a run at Roki Sasaki, as quite literally every team should be making. But the Cubs proved last year with the smash-hit signing of Shota Imanaga that they can strike gold in the second tier of starting pitchers as well. In that realm, Sean Manaea and Nick Pivetta come with qualifying offers attached, but each offers substantial upside and won’t cost nine figures. The same goes for Walker Buehler, who could be a nice gamble on a shorter-term deal. Chicago also feels like an excellent landing spot for Shane Bieber, even if he won’t be ready to help right away next season. The bullpen is another avenue for the Cubs to make a significant splash in free agency. Chicago made a nifty trade with Cleveland earlier this week, dealing 20-year-old outfield prospect Alfonsin Rosario to acquire right-hander Eli Morgan, who was quietly excellent when called upon as one of the less-heralded members of the elite Guardians bullpen. Morgan will help, but there’s plenty more room for upgrades in this bullpen. Perhaps the Cubs stay away from top-tier starting pitchers in free agency and instead focus on landing one of the elite relief arms available, such as Tanner Scott, Jeff Hoffman or Clay Holmes. The bullpen market is also stocked with veteran types who could fortify this unit; Blake Treinen, Kirby Yates or even Kenley Jansen come to mind. The Cubs wouldn’t have to break the bank to land these types of arms and could realistically also add a mid-tier starter to seriously strengthen the entire pitching staff. With so much of the position-player group seemingly set — and with more help on the way — there’s no excuse for Chicago not to make several meaningful additions on the mound this winter. Let’s turn our attention back to the offensive side of things and contemplate the infield. The surprise acquisition of Isaac Paredes at the 2024 trade deadline made an already crowded depth chart even more difficult to project moving forward and prompted some intriguing possibilities entering this offseason. That would’ve been true even if Paredes had raked for the Cubs post-trade, but that’s practically the opposite of what happened, as he didn’t perform anywhere close to his potential in the second half. Still, Paredes is under team control through 2027, and it’s not like the Cubs got him for free; trading for him seemed to signal a real intention for him to be the third baseman in Chicago for the foreseeable future. Enter Matt Shaw. The Cubs’ first-round pick in 2023 out of the University of Maryland had a marvelous season in the minors, reaching Triple-A and excelling in 35 games to finish the season before he starred with Team USA in the Premier12 tournament. A shortstop in college, Shaw bounced around the infield in his first pro season but took the majority of his reps at third base, a position that seemed open in Chicago … until Paredes was acquired. We don’t know if Shaw is ready to contribute on Opening Day, but it’s not difficult to imagine a big spring training from the talented infielder creating pressure for him to crack the Cubs' roster out of camp. But where will he play? This is a good problem to have on paper, but it becomes more complicated if Paredes doesn’t bounce back. With Busch entrenched at first base after a strong rookie season and Swanson locked in at shortstop for the long haul, second baseman Nico Hoerner becomes an interesting character here as well. Hoerner is under team control for two more seasons and provides outstanding defense but a bat that has plateaued around league-average. If the Cubs deem Shaw ready sooner rather than later, might they consider dealing Hoerner to make room for Shaw at second? It’s awfully difficult to determine whether that’s a sensible strategy without knowing just how big-league-ready Shaw is or what version of Paredes the Cubs will get in 2025, but it’s certainly a path worth exploring — especially if teams are willing to pay a substantial price for Hoerner. Shaw isn’t the only prospect in the upper levels of Chicago’s system who could make a difference in the big leagues in the near future. As if the infield picture weren’t jam-packed enough, second baseman James Triantos — a wonderful defender with strong contact skills and plus wheels on the basepaths — also reached Triple-A in 2024 and could play his way into consideration next summer. Third baseman Cam Smith, Chicago’s first-round pick this past summer out of Florida State, collected more total bases than any other 2024 draftee after signing and finished the season in Double-A. He could be ready far sooner than anyone expected. Catcher Moises Ballesteros had a monster breakout season as a 20-year-old, hitting his way to Triple-A and finishing with a strong few weeks in the Arizona Fall League. But the recent acquisition of catcher Matt Thaiss from the Angels suggests that the Cubs might not be ready to lean on Ballesteros as the backup to incumbent Miguel Amaya too quickly, though it’s possible that his bat forces the issue at some point in 2025. Outfielder Owen Caissie was added to the 40-man roster this week and has massive raw power that was on display over a full season in Triple-A in 2024, but he’ll need to iron out some significant strikeout issues before getting the call to Chicago. Super-athletic 22-year-old Kevin Alcantara made his debut in the Cubs' outfield last summer after a much shorter stint in Triple-A, but he too will need to make more consistent contact to be considered a viable option in the short term. Caissie’s and Alcantara’s paths to playing time would’ve been much clearer had Bellinger opted out, but now each will need to prove his worth over a longer period of time in Triple-A to warrant consistent run at the big-league level. Not all of these players will end up making an impact in Chicago. But their proximity to the big leagues and prospect cachet are worth monitoring as the Cubs sort out their roster for 2025, especially in the context of possible trades this winter and next summer.",2024-11-22,0,0.71,0.29

That tendency can make an official into, as Marv Levy once said, an ""over-officious jerk.""",2024-11-22,1,0.39,0.61
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Franz Wagner feeling himself against the Lakers? A dangerous development for all Magic foes,https://sports.yahoo.com/franz-wagner-feeling-himself-against-the-lakers-a-dangerous-development-for-all-magic-foes-184215599.html,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:42:15 GMT",Orlando's 23-year-old forward is performing like one of the best players in the NBA thus far this season.,"What stands out, in context, is the confidence. Down two, 18.9 seconds left, under the bright lights in L.A. Anthony Davis, a 79.5% career free-throw shooter who’d canned 10 of his first 11 at the stripe through the first 47 minutes of Magic-Lakers, bricks a pair to give Orlando a chance to tie — or, perhaps, if you’re feeling yourself on the road, to go for the win. And these days? Brother, Franz Wagner is feeling himself. Wagner calls guard Jalen Suggs up for the ball screen, getting Davis to give up the switch and allowing him to go one-on-one against Cam Reddish — still a big, long-limbed, athletic defender, but not nearly on the level of AD, and also, crucially, a couple of inches shorter than Franz himself. Rhythm dribble, tween-tween, straight to the stepback — no hesitation, no second-guessing, and no doubt. He cashes out. Magic lead. And, one stop later: Magic win. Wagner made 41 stepback 3-pointers in his first 231 games across three NBA seasons, shooting 33.1% on those high-wire-act, long-range looks. When Wagner dotted Reddish’s eye on Thursday, it was his 10th in 23 tries (43.5%) across 17 games this season — the most consequential and loudest, and one that highlights the hurdle that he’s had to leap. The German forward entered the summer with a bitter taste in his mouth. On one hand, he’d put together his strongest season as a pro, averaging 19.7 points, 5.3 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game for a pleasant-surprise Magic team that won 47 games and made the playoffs for the first time in four years. On the other, he’d ended the campaign with a whimper, capping a season-long shooting slump — just 28.1% from 3-point land, the worst long-distance mark among 181 players who launched at least 200 long balls — by going 1-for-15 from the field and 0-for-5 from deep in Game 7 of Orlando’s opening-round loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. The downward spiral from distance continued at the 2024 Paris Olympics. While Wagner played a starring role for his country, averaging a team-high 18.5 points per game and helping lead Germany to the semifinals and ultimately a fourth-place finish, he made just seven of his 35 attempts from the shorter FIBA 3-point arc. The consistent inconsistency left the status of his janky jumper — one that had gone in at about a league-average clip through his rookie and sophomore seasons — looming as one of the biggest questions for a Magic team in desperate need of more shot-making and offensive firepower. That need became even more desperate on Halloween, when Wagner’s All-Star frontcourt partner Paolo Banchero, fresh off a breakout 50-point performance, was diagnosed with a torn oblique that would put him on the shelf for the foreseeable future. Suddenly, doubt was a luxury Orlando could not afford; for the Magic to stay afloat without their leader in points, assists, touches and time of possession, Wagner would have to trust in the hours of work he’d put in over the summer to make his weakness into a strength, and step forward into the spotlight that his patient, poised, effective-but-minor-key game doesn’t always receive. Well, judging by the 37 points he just hung on the Lakers — Wagner’s fourth 30-plus-point explosion of the season, after rolling up 11 through his first three seasons — to go with 11 rebounds, six assists and four steals? So far, so good: The Magic have now won seven of their last eight, with the best point differential in the NBA over that span. (A friendly schedule has helped: Orlando swept a five-game homestand featuring visits from the injury-ravaged Pelicans and 76ers, the disappointing Pacers and the basement-dwelling Wizards, before going on the road to take down a Suns team missing Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal and Jusuf Nurkić.) As has been the case ever since Jamahl Mosley took the reins in Central Florida, Orlando’s defense leads the way, smothering opponents to the tune of a league-low 102.2 points per 100 non-garbage-time possessions during this stretch. But Mosley’s club has also featured a near-top-10 offense, despite missing Banchero, and despite four of the six Orlando players logging at least 25 minutes a night over the past couple of weeks — Suggs, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Anthony Black and rookie Tristan da Silva — combining to shoot a grisly 39-for-146 (26.7%) from deep. Wagner has been the beating heart of that offense, averaging 28.1 points, 6.0 rebounds and 6.9 assists in 35.4 minutes a night over the last eight games, posting a .587 true shooting percentage (which factors in 2-point, 3-point and free-throw accuracy) while finishing more than 31% of Orlando’s offensive possessions with a shot attempt, foul drawn or turnover. That is a superstar-level combination of usage, efficiency and production, arrived at only by stacking possession after possession of hard drives to the paint, pristine footwork and expert leveraging of angles, soft-touch floaters and on-target passes in teammates’ shooting pockets … and, as he showed by drilling four triples in 10 tries on Thursday, the confidence to keep firing. “A lot of stuff is mental, too, for us players,” Wagner told reporters after Thursday’s win. “For me to get over the hump a little bit over the summer and carry that into the season means a lot. I’ve come a long way since I came into the league, [but] last year was at times a struggle for me. Progress is never just linear; you just gotta stay level-headed.” While Wagner himself needs to stay on an even keel, the results he’s producing can lead your mind to wander — and to wonder just how good he and the Magic can be. All told, Wagner is averaging 23.2 points, 5.6 rebounds and 5.4 assists in 31.9 minutes per game for the season, back up to 35% from long range on a career-high 6.1 attempts per game. He’s one of 13 players averaging at least 23-5-5 this season — a list that includes four MVPs (Nikola Jokić, Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, Stephen Curry), four All-NBA selections (Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jayson Tatum, Luka Dončić, De’Aaron Fox) and two All-Stars (teammate Banchero, Brandon Ingram). He pairs that impressive box-score production with a sterling advanced statistical résumé: third in the NBA in wins above replacement according to Neil Paine’s Estimated RAPTOR, fifth in The BBall Index’s LEBRON metric, ninth in value over replacement player, 15th in box plus-minus, 18th in player efficiency rating, and 24th in win shares per 48 minutes. It all points toward the 23-year-old performing like one of the 15 or 20 best players in the NBA thus far this season. Combine that with the role he’s played in keeping the Magic above .500 without Banchero, and thus above the fray in what looks like a truly haunted Eastern Conference, and you’ve got an awfully impressive start to an All-Star case — a gifted player bouncing back from a brush with failure, putting it all together, and putting his team in position to reap the benefits. This time last year, Wagner told Jake Fischer that “the worst thing would be to look back and think I didn’t get the most out of myself.” If he keeps this up, he won’t have to worry much about that. Defenses, on the other hand? They’re going to have a lot to fret over; just ask Cam Reddish, JJ Redick and every other Laker who got an up-close look at how dangerous a confident Wagner can be.",2024-11-22,0,0.59,0.41

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Fact or Fiction: The NBA's 2024 free-agency class was a dud,https://sports.yahoo.com/fact-or-fiction-the-nbas-2024-free-agency-class-was-a-dud-175638573.html,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 17:56:38 GMT",Let's take a deeper dive to see if teams are salvaging some value from their underwhelming offseason signings.,"Each week during the 2024-25 NBA season, we will take a deeper dive into some of the league’s biggest storylines in an attempt to determine whether trends are based more in fact or fiction moving forward. [Last week: The NBA needs more 3-point specialists] No team spent more on salary this past summer than the Philadelphia 76ers, who own the NBA's worst record through the season's first month — indirect evidence that the 2024 free-agency class was a bust. Let us dive deeper into that question to see if teams managed to salvage some value. First a reintroduction to Cost Per Win (CPW), a statistic created here in 2016 to measure the cost of each player's contributions to a team's success in a given season: We take the average annual value (AAV) of a player's contract, divide it by that player's win shares (WS) and extrapolate the data out to a full season. This provides us with an estimated account of how much teams are paying their players for each victory. We separated the 56 free agents who changed teams over the summer into four categories: big-ticket ($12,859,001+), mid-tier ($5,183,000-$12,859,000), low-cost ($1,157,153-$5,182,999) and two-way players. It is harder to equate value across tiers. Teams expect to pay more per win for max-salaried players. Usage varies. Roles are different. Minimum-salaried players do not stabilize organizations. In fact, the addition of a high-priced free agent has been known to attract lower-cost ones, as was the case in Philadelphia. PLAYER AAV WS CPW 1. DeMar DeRozan, SAC $24,630,000 1.5 $3,003,659 2. Klay Thompson, DAL $16,666,667 0.7 $4,355,401 3. Tobias Harris, DET $26,000,000 1.1 $4,900,222 4. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, ORL $22,000,000 0.7 $6,132,404 5. Isaiah Hartenstein, OKC $29,000,000 0.1 $56,585,366 6. Paul George, PHI $52,896,235 0.1 $90,310,645 Eighty-eight players have registered at least a single win share through the season's first month, and just two of them — Sacramento Kings standout DeMar DeRozan and Detroit Pistons forward Tobias Harris — were big-ticket acquisitions in free agency. And who else was bidding for DeRozan or Harris? Granted, Isaiah Hartenstein made his season debut for the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday, the same day Paul George hyperextended his left knee for the second time in five weeks. We should expect then that Harris has made a greater impact on the Pistons than George has on the Philadelphia 76ers, though that is no less disheartening for the Sixers fans who rode Harris out of town. Pause to consider how concerning the signing of George — the most skilled player in a shallow pool of big-ticket free agents — could be for Philly. He is the only player still active from the 2010 draft class, and he has played more than 56 games once in the past five years, his contract season. He has had major injuries to every one of his extremities, and will be paid $56.6 million in 2028, when he turns 38 years old. It does not help that maximum-salaried teammates Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey cannot stay on the court, either. At some point the three of them will play sustained minutes together. Presumably they will win games. But it bears repeating: The 76ers have so far paid George $9 million to contribute one-tenth of a win share. PLAYER AAV WS CPW 1. Kris Dunn, LAC $5,426,400 1 $1,058,810 2. Chris Paul, SAS $10,460,000 1.7 $1,200,574 3. Buddy Hield, GSW $9,439,024 1.2 $1,342,951 4. Naji Marshall, DAL $9,000,000 1 $1,646,341 5. Malik Beasley, DET $6,000,000 0.7 $1,777,003 6. Jonas Valanciunas, WAS $10,098,333 0.8 $2,001,194 7. Derrick Jones Jr., LAC $10,000,000 0.9 $2,168,022 8. Jalen Smith, CHI $9,000,000 0.4 $4,390,244 9. Caleb Martin, MIA $8,760,176 0.3 $4,985,466 10. De'Anthony Melton, GSW $12,822,000 0.3 $7,297,073 Four of those aforementioned 88 players received mid-tier contracts this past summer. We also had 88 games of film on Kris Dunn in Utah, where he was his usual All-Defensive-caliber self and added a 3-point shot (40% on 147 attempts). Imagine not lining up for those services on short money. Yet the L.A. Clippers landed him on July 1 for the taxpayer's midlevel exception. Pays to be early — and right. Same goes for Naji Marshall, a hard-scrapping wing whose 3-point shooting spiked to a career-high 38.7% last season. That has dipped to 13% in this season's early going, but the Dallas Mavericks should be encouraged that he is still generating significant value as they wait for his shot to progress to the mean. Chris Paul, Buddy Hield, Malik Beasley, Jonas Valanciunas and Derrick Jones Jr. were known commodities when they entered free agency, and they are delivering on their promise for mid-tier salaries. They are all on pace for a handful of win shares this season, what Sixth Man of the Year Naz Reid provided for the Minnesota Timberwolves last season. In other words, $2 million a win is good value for a mid-tier salary. PLAYER AAV WS CPW 1. Jay Huff, MEM $2,527,660 1.1 $448,365 2. Tyus Jones, PHX $3,003,427 1.2 $488,362 3. Guerschon Yabusele, PHI $2,087,519 0.7 $509,151 4. Taurean Prince, MIL $2,988,550 0.7 $780,980 5. Cameron Payne, NYK $3,003,427 0.6 $915,679 6. Javonte Green, NOP $2,425,403 0.5 $946,499 7. Mason Plumlee, PHX $3,303,771 0.6 $1,074,397 8. Alec Burks, UTA $3,303,771 0.4 $1,309,421 9. Jordan McLaughlin, SAC $2,425,403 0.3 $1,478,904 10. Monte Morris, PHX $2,800,834 0.3 $1,821,681 The Memphis Grizzlies signed Jay Huff to a two-way contract in July, and a week into this season they upgraded him to a fully guaranteed salary for the next two years. He has more than earned that deal. We should not be surprised that Tyus Jones appears on this list. His minimum salary was a gift to the Phoenix Suns, as he prioritized a considerable role to showcase his real value for the summer of 2025. And, hey, at least the Sixers found some value on this salary tier, landing Guerschon Yabusele, whose value was evident to anyone who watched him perform against Team USA at the Olympics in Paris. It is hard to make a grave mistake at this level of compensation. Unfortunately, the Sixers also have Eric Gordon and his -0.2 win shares. But we should go back to the Clippers, whose first order of business in free agency was to sign Kevin Porter Jr. to a minimum contract. His -0.3 win shares are the fewest of anyone who has played as many minutes as he has (275). The Clippers are paying Porter to make their team worse, and that is nothing any team wants, especially from this player. How could the Clippers be so accurate in their assessment of one player and so mistaken on another? Makes you wonder how much luck plays a part in the single-season success of minimum-paid players. Adding Jones at that salary is a no-brainer. But you do not know what you are going to get year-to-year from guys like Taurean Prince, Cameron Payne, Javonte Green and Mason Plumlee. Hope for their best. PLAYER AAV WS CPW 1. Moussa Diabate, CHA $578,577 0.7 $151,196 2. Jamal Cain, NOP $578,577 0.2 $564,465 3. TyTy Washington, PHX $578,577 0.1 $1,128,931 4. JT Thor, CLE $578,577 0.1 $1,199,489 Which brings us to the two-way crew. Any contributions at that tier are valuable. A second to praise Moussa Diabaté. The Clippers — yes, those same Clippers — declined his $2.1 million qualifying offer, making an athletic 6-foot-11 rim protector a free agent. No one offered the minimum. The Charlotte Hornets took a two-way flier, and he is owning his 16 minutes a night. He is efficient in his limited offensive possessions, rebounds like wild (16.3 per 36 minutes) and holds opponents in check. Overall, the big-ticket free agents were a dud, the mid-tier free agents are middling, and the real value was among the low-cost free agents. And even then there are few difference-makers. The question is not whether the 2024 free-agency class was a dud but if free agency itself is dying as a team-building tool. Determination: Fact. The NBA's 2024 free-agency class was a dud.",2024-11-22,0,0.57,0.43
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Fantasy Football: Week 12 predictions to count on,https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy-football-week-12-predictions-to-count-on-162733318.html,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 16:27:33 GMT",The Yahoo Fantasy Football team comes together to deliver their conviction picks for Week 12.,"The Yahoo team delivers their most steadfast predictions for Week 12. It’s Week 12 and Bo Nix might be the most trustworthy rookie quarterback in the league. Since Week 5, Nix has scored a minimum of 14 fantasy points in every game, finished inside the top 12 five times and thrown just two interceptions. Combine the much-improved passing with his rushing upside and you have an incredibly stable quarterback with high upside and limited risk. Nix has thrived in a wide range of matchups, from dominating layup defenses like Carolina to delivering a solid performance in tough matchups like Kansas City. He’s simply getting it done. This week, he faces a favorable matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders, who allow the eighth-most fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks. Nix has legitimate overall QB1 upside this week. — Tera Roberts Irving finds himself in a great matchup as he comes out of his bye week. He’ll take on a Giants defense that allows the most rushing yards per play this season, according to NFL Pro. But it gets even better because Irving and the Bucs are five-point favorites against the Tommy DeVito-led Giants offense. There’s a good chance the Bucs play with a lead in the second half which could lead to even more rush attempts for Irving. The Giants also allow the third most explosive runs of 10+ yards this season. This matters because Irving is one of the most dynamic backs in the NFL. He’s averaging nearly six yards per touch this season and generating an explosive play on 11% of his touches, which is similar to Saquon Barkley’s explosive play rate of 12%. Irving is a must-start this week and has the upside to finish as a top-five back. — Sal Vetri First of all, I must say that Sal simply beat me to Bucky Irving, who is going to do such terrible things to the Giants defense. But hey, I’m a professional. Irving isn’t the only player I’m bullish on this week. Justin Herbert is playing at an undeniably elite level and he is about to cook the Ravens D, which has of course allowed the most passing yards per game this season (284.5). In fact, an overall QB1 finish is definitely in play for Herbert. He’s thrown only one interception on the year and has produced career-best rates in terms of yards per attempt (7.9) and per completion (12.4). Ladd McConkey has been a ridiculous problem for opposing defenses to solve and no team can keep Quentin Johnston out of the end zone. There’s actually a decent chance that Monday night’s game delivers the two highest-scoring fantasy quarterbacks of Week 12, so let’s hope you have plenty of Ravens and Bolts in the active lineup. — Andy Behrens Robinson saw 17 opportunities during his return last week, including a goal-line score. He ranks top 10 in rushing TDs (seven) this season despite missing three games thanks to heavy red-zone work. Robinson is off the injury report this week, so hopefully he’s closer to 100%. The Cowboys have been gashed for NFL highs in EPA/rush and rushing touchdowns while allowing the third most fantasy points to running backs. Washington has this week’s second-highest implied team total (28.5 points) and is a double-digit home favorite against a reeling Cowboys team, so game script should be highly favorable. Robinson has averaged 5.5 YPC at home this season, so he finishes as a top-10 back this week. — Dalton Del Don As Tera highlighted above, Bo Nix has played great football of late. The stats aren’t lying; he’s executing a well-designed offense at a high level. But he’s really only bringing one player along for the ride from a fantasy perspective. Since Week 8, Cortland Sutton is the only Broncos player to run a route on more than 60% of Nix’s dropbacks. He’s dominating the volume with a 29% target share and 46% air yard share. Sutton is entrenched as the X-receiver in this offense and he’s always been a strong fit for what Sean Payton wants out of that position. Now, he’s operating with a quarterback who has a substantial overlap with his skills beyond the right coverage receptions. Sutton gets a matchup with a Raiders defense that allows the type of vertical targets on which Nix and Sutton have developed some serious chemistry. With so many proven receivers on bye, Sutton is a locked-in top-15 option. — Matt Harmon I know the vibes are usually positive in this column, but you also need to know who to bench (and maybe who to cut). Jaylen Waddle managers need to have a conversation. He’s stuck on one touchdown all year and hasn’t seen 60 yards since Opening Day. When does a bad start become a bad season? We’re almost to Thanksgiving, gamers. The Patriots secondary is competitive and it’s clear the Dolphins are looking more to manage Tua Tagovailoa these days, not utilize him as a deep-throwing maestro. Waddle has a capped upside entering Week 12 and not only should you bench him, but he’s a justified cut in some smaller leagues. — Scott Pianowski",2024-11-22,1,0.49,0.51

Here are the top wide receiver options for New England in free agency.,"Tee Higgins to Patriots? Here are the top WRs set to hit free agency originally appeared on NBC Sports Boston The New England Patriots appear to have found their next franchise quarterback in Drake Maye. Now, they must find their prized third-overall draft pick with playmakers. New England's wide receiver room remains a massive weakness even after addressing the position in the 2024 draft. While second-rounder Ja'Lynn Polk and fourth-rounder Javon Baker could still develop into impactful players, their rookie campaigns have left plenty to be desired. The Patriots stayed quiet at the NFL trade deadline, so they'll have to wait until the offseason to make the necessary improvements to their offense. According to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler, they are expected to be active on the free-agent market to find help for their promising young signal-caller. ""The Patriots are disappointed in the offensive line and receiver play but feel they have several players to help the cause in 2025 and beyond,"" Fowler wrote in his Week 12 column. ... ""And Maye's play has energized the building. The Pats hit on the most important position. Expect New England, once again, to work free agency for pass-catching and offensive line help to maximize Maye's impact. That's an encouraging update, but are any impending free agents capable of being Maye's No. 1 target for years to come? Let's take a look at the top wideouts set to hit the open market. . . Age: 26 At only 26 years old, Higgins is unquestionably the most intriguing option on this list for the rebuilding Patriots. The Cincinnati Bengals are expected to let the Clemson product walk in free agency, opening up a perfect opportunity for him to become Maye's new No. 1 target. BURROW TO HIGGINS. BENGALS NOT DONE.📺: #CINvsLAC on NBC/Peacock📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/HNgJW672DJ — NFL (@NFL) November 18, 2024 Higgins has been hampered by injuries over the last two seasons, but when healthy, he has been among the league's most productive receivers. He has 295 catches for 4,173 yards and 28 touchdowns in 64 games played over five seasons with Cincy. With several teams sure to be looking for receiver help, Higgins will cost a pretty penny. Still, with such a glaring need at the position, there's no reason the Patriots shouldn't be among the highest bidders for his services. Age: 30 Diggs' name jumps off the page because he's been one of the NFL's top wideouts for almost a decade. However, the four-time Pro Bowler suffered a torn ACL in October and as he reaches his 30s, his best days are likely behind him. The argument for signing Diggs? He had six consecutive seasons with more than 1,000 receiving yards and was on track to eclipse that mark again with the Houston Texans prior to his injury. Since he's damaged goods, his price should be lower than the other options on this list. That said, Diggs' age and injury make him an imperfect fit for a team building around a rookie QB. Unfortunately for New England, most of the names on this list are either injury prone or past their primes. Age: 33 The Chicago Bears added Allen and DJ Moore in hopes that they would revive their offense with No. 1 draft pick Caleb Williams throwing them the ball. Those moves haven't paid off as the group remains dysfunctional heading into Week 12. Allen has 30 catches for 282 yards and two touchdowns in eight games played this season. Last year with the Los Angeles Chargers, he notched 108 catches for 1,243 yards and seven TDs in 13 games. Third touchdown of the day for Caleb 🎯📺: #JAXvsCHI on NFL Network📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/lbzlBQi4rh — NFL (@NFL) October 13, 2024 Like Diggs, Allen is an elite talent with injury concerns. And as great as he was in 2023, it's fair to say the six-time Pro Bowler is approaching the tail end of his NFL career. Age: 31 When Cooper signs this upcoming offseason, it could be with his fourth team since 2021. The five-time Pro Bowler has played for the Dallas Cowboys, Cleveland Browns, and the Buffalo Bills in that span. Cooper was traded from Cleveland to Buffalo before this year's deadline. Between poor QB play and injury, it's been a rough season for the veteran wideout. However, Cooper entered the campaign with at least 1,114 yards in four of his last five seasons. There's plenty still left in the tank, and he'd be a reliable option for Maye to lean on in his first full season as the Patriots' starting quarterback. Age: 29 Godwin's 2024 season ended prematurely due to a devastating ankle injury. Before he went down, he was well on his way to his fifth 1,000-plus-yard season in six years. He's been one of the most consistent wideouts in the game when healthy. His injury shouldn't dissuade teams from signing him. Godwin has come back strong from a season-ending injury before as he tore his ACL and MCL in 2021. He'll be just 29 years old next season, making him one of the youngest wideouts among the top options in this year's class. Age: 33 Hopkins' days as arguably the best wide receiver in football are over, but he's still a rock-solid option as he approaches his mid-30s. The three-time All-Pro selection produced a 1,057-yard, seven-touchdown season with the lowly Tennessee Titans in 2023. He hasn't enjoyed the same success through 10 games with the Titans and Kansas City Chiefs this year, but that's largely due to the poor QB play he had to endure in Tennessee. The Patriots lost the Hopkins sweepstakes in the 2022 offseason. Perhaps the opportunity to work with a promising young QB could entice him to sign next spring. Age: 29 Johnson was traded to the Carolina Panthers last offseason after five solid years with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was traded again ahead of the deadline to the Baltimore Ravens. He led the Panthers with 30 catches, 357 yards, and three TDs before being shipped to Baltimore, where he's been a non-factor through his first three games with the team. While Johnson would immediately slot in as the Patriots' top wideout, New England probably should aim higher if it wants a bonafide No. 1 option. Age: 28 Brown has yet to play this season for the Chiefs due to injury. Last season with the Arizona Cardinals, he recorded 51 catches for 574 yards (a career-low) and four touchdowns. His best season was his 2021 campaign with the Ravens, when he logged 91 receptions for 1,008 yards and six TDs. While his injury is concerning, Brown's speed makes him an intriguing wideout to pair with a strong-armed QB. He is also likely to be one of the more affordable options on this list, though the Patriots shouldn't be pinching pennies in their efforts to upgrade their offense.",2024-11-22,0,0.75,0.25

Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Fantasy Football Traffic Cop: Week 12 lineup advice,https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy-football-traffic-cop-week-12-lineup-advice-162425383.html,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 16:24:25 GMT",Fantasy football analyst Scott Pianowski delivers Week 12's fantasy football traffic report to help make your start/sit decisions.,"The following is an excerpt from the latest edition of Yahoo's fantasy football newsletter, Get to the Points! If you like what you see, you can subscribe for free here. Start-sit questions can be anxious for even the best fantasy managers. Here's a traffic-light report to help get you ready for Week 12. He's been the best runner in the Tampa Bay backfield, averaging 1.3 yards more per rush than Rachaad White. Running lanes should be available against a Giants front seven that gives out 5.3 YPC, worst in the NFL.‌ The Chargers slightly prefer the run but it's a small gap; Justin Herbert's play has improved in recent weeks. Johnston is coming along for the ride (touchdowns in three straight games) and the injury-wrecked Baltimore secondary doesn't offer much resistance. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. In the early weeks, he was an athletic quarterback who ran plenty and occasionally hit a few passes. His passing efficiency has improved significantly. Over his last seven starts, Nix has a tidy 7.4 YPA and a rating of 106.2 The Philadelphia defense is surging but so is Stafford; since getting his two main receivers back four games ago, he's averaging 2.5 touchdown passes and 291 passing yards per week. I don't understand why he isn't universally ranked over Deebo Samuel Sr. yet; he keeps outproducing him every week. Remember: in our game, it's the numbers, not the names. Is the nagging rib injury suffocating him as a runner? He has just 23 rushing yards the last two weeks, logging a pair of QB24 finishes. The Cowboys are a favorable draw, but Washington might not press the pace for a full three hours. Detroit's defense has turned into a problem, but Richardson got his groove back in the comeback win over the Jets and offers a useful rushing backboard in any start.‌ Maybe the Tommy DeVito move sounds like a downgrade, but keep in mind how poorly Daniel Jones was playing. The Giants are likely to pepper Nabers after their bye week, and the Tampa Bay secondary has been a mess all year. Not a chance I'm benching Nabers anywhere. I think the presence of Jonathon Brooks is an overrated angle; yes, Brooks was an early pick, but don't overlook the contract extension Hubbard earned. The biggest problem is the Chiefs rushing defense, the worst matchup for opposing backs in 2024. He might not be needed for four periods if the Commanders gain control of the game, but Ekeler is essentially the No. 2 receiver in Washington, scoring double-digit points in three straight, including an eight-catch gem against Philadelphia last week. He's probably a safe bet for 4-6 catches if Jake Ferguson is scratched as expected. It's also possible CeeDee Lamb could be limited, or perhaps out completely. Tight end is such a tricky position; we'll take what we can get. He hasn't been better than QB14 in seven weeks, in part because Joe Mixon is the touchdown priority at the goal line. Tennessee isn't the easy matchup you might suspect, ranked a respectable 11th in defensive DVOA. He's stuck on three touchdowns for the year and he's averaged less than 10 yards per catch in eight of 10 games. Rome Odunze might be the better offensive fit as the Bears ride out the year with new OC Thomas Brown. The Dolphins have TE Jonnu Smith unlocked and Tyreek Hill is too good to bench, but Waddle is a harder pill to swallow. He's scored just one touchdown all year and hasn't made it to 60 yards since opening day. In shallow formats, you have my permission to drop Waddle. His role shrunk last week with Isaiah Likely back and the Chargers' seam coverage has been outstanding all year.",2024-11-22,1,0.35,0.65
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",St. Petersburg city council reverses course on Tampa Bay Rays' stadium repairs,https://sports.yahoo.com/st-petersburg-city-council-reverses-course-on-tampa-bay-rays-stadium-repairs-153321167.html,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 15:33:21 GMT",The Rays have already announced they will play their 2025 home games at Steinbrenner Field in Tampa.,"Hours after the St. Petersburg City Council approved spending $23.7 million to repair Tropicana Field after it was damaged during Hurricane Milton, the council reversed its decision in a second vote. The change of course came after the council voted to ""delay consideration of revenue bonds for a proposed new $1.3 billion Rays ballpark,"" according to the Associated Press. There was hope from the city that a new roof and additional repairs would allow the Rays to return to Tropicana Field for the 2026 season. The team has an obligation, should the stadium get fixed, to play there for three more seasons. The main damage to Tropicana Field was to the fabric roof panels, which were essentially ripped off when the storm made landfall. Eighteen of the 24 panels failed due to Hurricane Milton's high winds, and the failure of the roof allowed rain and wind to cause more damage inside the stadium. Team president Brian Auld told reporters after the initial vote that the team isn't sure planned repairs would be done on time. That would be a headache for the Rays, as a contingency plan would need to be in place for another home location, requiring more funds. “Our certainty is actually greater if the decision is made not to repair Tropicana Field, because I don’t believe we’re going to have a firm answer on whether it can be done for a very long time,” Auld said. “Based on the conversations we’ve had with our engineers, I believe we’re looking at a ‘26 situation where the city is trying to have the stadium ready, and we have to make alternative plans, and all the costs that come with that, that is actually more problematic for us. That’s why we’ve been working on trying to get to a settlement.” The Rays have already announced that any repairs would not be finished before the start of the 2025 MLB season, and they will play home games at Tampa's Steinbrenner Field, the minor-league complex and spring training home of the New York Yankees. As all parties involved continue the work, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred is open to giving everyone involved enough time to figure out a solution. “We’re committed to the fans in Tampa Bay,” Manfred said at the recent owners meeting. “Given all that’s happened in that market, we’re focused on our franchise in Tampa Bay right now.”",2024-11-22,1,0.36,0.64

Joe Gibbs Racing announced Friday that Chris Gabehart would become the team’s competition director and that Chris Gayle would become Hamlin’s crew chief. Gabehart had been Hamlin’s crew chief since the start of the 2019 season and the two had formed one of the most successful driver-crew chief pairings in NASCAR. Over the past six seasons, Hamlin won 23 races and never finished lower than eighth in the standings. Hamlin won 13 races in their first two seasons together but finished fourth in the standings each season. The 44-year-old is the most successful driver in NASCAR Cup Series history without a Cup title. Hamlin has 54 wins and three Daytona 500 victories, but he’s only finished second in the points standings once. In 2024, Hamlin won three times and had 18 top 10s but was eliminated from the playoffs in the penultimate race of the season at Martinsville. He ended up finishing eighth in the standings after an 11th-place finish at Phoenix. Gayle has been Ty Gibbs’ crew chief at JGR for the past two seasons. A longtime JGR crew chief, Gayle has worked with the team in various capacities since the 2013 season. He was Erik Jones’ crew chief on the No. 20 car from 2017-2020. Gayle served as Gibbs’ crew chief in the Xfinity Series in 2022 as Gibbs won seven races and the Xfinity Series title. Jones has two Cup Series wins with Gayle as drivers have scored 37 wins in the Xfinity Series on Gayle’s teams. No crew chief for Gibbs for the 2025 season was announced.",2024-11-22,1,0.33,0.67

Sign up here to get it every weekday morning. 🏈 Top QBs commit: Five-star QBs Julian Lewis and Bryce Underwood both flipped their commitments on Thursday, with Lewis heading to Colorado (originally USC) and Underwood going to Michigan (LSU). ⚾️ Robo-umps coming soon? MLB will test the robo-umpire challenge system during spring training, which could lead to regular-season implementation by 2026. 🏒 Ovi out 4-6 weeks: Alex Ovechkin, who leads the NHL with 15 goals, will miss 4-6 weeks with a fractured fibula, putting his Wayne Gretzky chase (27 goals shy of the all-time record) on hold. 🏈 Kraft denied again: Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who has made a concerted push in recent years to be enshrined in Canton, was passed over by the Hall of Fame's contributor committee. ⚽️ MLS record transfer: FC Cincinnati signed forward Kévin Denkey from Cercle Brugge (Belgium) for a $16.2 million fee, making it the largest transfer in MLS history. No. 5 Indiana visits No. 2 Ohio State on Saturday in a clash no one saw coming — and a matchup, as one might describe it, between major college football's biggest historical loser and its biggest historical winner. From Yahoo Sports' Dan Wetzel: ""Hoosiers"" — the tale of a tiny high school winning the state basketball tournament — is the greatest underdog story ever told out of Indiana. Yet as much as little Hickory High was an unlikely champion, it wasn't completely improbable. The sweet shooting Jimmy Chitwood, after all, was the equivalent of a 5-star talent. He just happened to grow up on a nearby farm. Not even mighty South Bend Central had an answer for him. The current Indiana football team — full of discount coaches and outcast players almost no major program wanted — has no one as heralded as Chitwood. But the new Hoosiers never stopped believing they were good enough, never stopped working to prove it and now have the opportunity to throw their best punch at the mighty Buckeyes. Hollywood endings are hard to find in real life — so who knows what happens in Columbus, let alone beyond. Ohio State is a nearly two-touchdown favorite for a reason. But the fact IU is even here … is a testament to all that is great about sports. Recruiting rankings and preseason perception don't move the scoreboard. Fight and work and self-determination can still win out. After all, the field inside Ohio Stadium is 100 yards long. They'll find this exact same measurement back in Bloomington. Further reading: Forever a basketball school, Curt Cignetti has awakened a 'sleeping giant' of a football program at Indiana (Ross Dellenger, Yahoo Sports) Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani were named unanimous MVPs on Wednesday, a fitting end to their epic 2024 campaigns. Judge, who led MLB with 58 HR, 144 RBI and an 1.159 OPS, beat out Royals SS Bobby Witt Jr. and teammate Juan Soto for his second MVP. He joins Mickey Mantle as the only Yankees to win the award unanimously. Ohtani, whose 54 HR, 130 RBI and 1.036 OPS trailed only Judge, beat out Mets SS Francisco Lindor and D-Backs 2B Ketel Marte for his third MVP in four years. He joins Frank Robinson as the only players to win the award in both the AL and NL. Multi-time MVPs: Judge is the 34th player to win multiple MVPs and Ohtani is the 12th to win at least three, joining Barry Bonds (7x) and three-time winners Mike Trout, Albert Pujols, Alex Rodriguez, Mike Schmidt, Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Roy Campanella, Stan Musial, Joe DiMaggio and Jimmie Foxx. The big picture: Getting to watch even one player of Judge and Ohtani's caliber is a treat, but seeing two play at this high a level simultaneously is downright historic: They're just the fourth duo to each win two MVPs in the same three-year span. Judge and Ohtani (2022-24) Bonds and Rodriguez (2003-05) Bonds and Frank Thomas (1992-94) Berra and Campanella (1953-55) Zoom out: Their dominance extends far beyond the past three seasons. Since 2018 (Ohtani's rookie year and Judge's second full season), they both rank in MLB's top five for HR, OPS and WAR. And Ohtani also has the 11th-best ERA among starters in that time. Cleveland — We got our first snow game of the season and it did not disappoint, as the Browns upset the Steelers, 24-19, thanks to a game-winning drive in the final minutes. Washington, D.C. — President Biden hosted the Celtics at the White House to celebrate their 18th championship. Fun fact: Biden's Secret Service code name is Celtic. ""For real. Because I'm Irish,"" he said. ""From this old Irish Celtic, to all you Celtics, congratulations."" Las Vegas — Sin City's circuit is ready for the second annual Las Vegas Grand Prix. Toronto — It would have been a crime for the Raptors to lose on a court this cool. They got the win. The NBA All-Star Game, long in need of a change amid declining ratings and non-competitive action, is finally switching things up. Coming soon: The NBA is reportedly tweaking the format for this year's All-Star Game in San Francisco, making it a four-team tournament that's expected to more closely resemble fast-paced pickup games. The 24 All-Stars will be split into three teams of eight, and the winner of the Rising Stars game (comprising top rookies, sophomores and G Leaguers) will be the fourth team. The semifinals will be to 40 points and the final will be to 25. Bottom line: Last year's All-Star Game, which was the highest-scoring ever (211-186) and featured an absurd 168 attempted threes, was universally panned. ESPN's Stephen A. Smith called it ""an absolute travesty,"" suggesting the NBA get rid of the game entirely. Hopefully all it needed was a refresh. 10 years ago today, Oklahoma true freshman Samaje Perine rushed for 427 yards against Kansas in a driving rainstorm, breaking the FBS record of 408 yards set a week earlier by Wisconsin's Melvin Gordon. Perine: 34 car, 427 yds (12.6 avg), 5 TD Gordon: 25 car, 408 yds (16.3 avg), 4 TD 400-yard club: The only other players to eclipse 400 yards in an FBS game? TCU's LaDainian Tomlinson in 1999 (406 yards) and Buffalo's Jaret Patterson in 2020 (409 yards). Look who it is! That's Sooners walk-on Baker Mayfield celebrating next to Perine. He wasn't eligible to play that season due to transfer rules but became the starter in 2015. A year after missing the playoffs, the Orlando Pride and Washington Spirit will meet for the NWSL Championship on Saturday night (8pm ET, CBS) in Kansas City.

The New England Patriots owner, who has made a concerted push in recent years to be enshrined in Canton, was passed over by the Hall's contributor committee in favor of NFL co-founder Ralph Hay, according to ESPN's Don Van Natta Jr. Kraft was previously a favorite to receive enshrinement, especially with the introduction of the contributor committee. Previously, Kraft had to compete with coaches for induction because a single subcommittee was in charge of picking non-player names for the ballot, but this year he only had to beat out other owners, executives and assorted figures in the game. So it's a bit of a surprise Kraft didn't make it, as one ESPN source bluntly put it: ""It's a huge surprise,"" said one source, who insisted on anonymity. ""And it's very disappointing. Unless you are an NFL historian, you don't know who Ralph Hay is."" Hay, who died in 1944, owned the Canton Bulldogs from 1918 to 1923. Those five years of ownership included the meeting hosted by Hay that led to the creation of the first incarnation of the NFL. Kraft's résumé is a bit different. The 83-year-old purchased a controlling stake in the Patriots in 1994 and has since presided over the most successful franchise of the 21st century. Many will credit Tom Brady and Bill Belichick more for those six Super Bowl titles, but Kraft has made it pretty clear he believes he deserves at least some credit. It was reported earlier this year Kraft's camp has been privately arguing for his enshrinement for a decade or so, lobbying voters overseeing both a book and docuseries about the Patriots dynasty that painted him in a very favorable light. The fact that Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is already in is apparently something of a sore spot. Of course, it's not like Kraft's tenure with the NFL is spotless, between the Patriots' cheating scandals and his own incident at a massage parlor in Florida. He can only hope the voters who matter see it a different way next year.",2024-11-22,1,0.49,0.51

Like the majority in golf, Slumbers was disappointed by The Telegraph’s recent revelation that the US Ryder Cup team will break with nearly 100 years of tradition by paying its players directly from next year, but believes it is symptomatic of the obsession with dollars that has raged since the Saudis set up the LIV Golf series three years ago. Negotiations between the Kingdom’s Public Investment Fund and the PGA Tour to unify the game are dragging on and Slumbers thinks it is imperative they reach a hasty solution. “The divisive position that we have in the professional game has been very damaging for golf,” he told Telegraph Sport. “It’s been damaging in terms of our reputation as a sport. I was hoping that we’d have had peace by now, because we need to get some stability. We need to see the game become financially sustainable, because it cannot carry on like this. “If it is to have a long-term future, we need to stop talking as much about money – everything in golf seems to be dominated by money – and get back to being about values of the sport. If we do that, I think the general public will start to watch it again. “Look the public are watching certain events – some viewing figures are up. But, as we know, a lot of them are down and I think that has a lot to do with that whole concept of constantly talking about money. Unfortunately, the male professional game has become delinked from the fan. “If I look at the Ryder Cup purely as a golf fan, then week in, week out the pros are in a business, playing for money and for ranking points. But once every couple of years, they have the honour to play for their country or continent and, in a way, say thank you to the fans who’ve supported them. “And, historically, that’s why the Ryder Cup is such a great event, because it creates that amazing fan experience of supporting your country. That link could now be put in danger, in my opinion.” The sporting civil war has been Slumbers’ “biggest disappointment” in his 10 years in this position. “Up until the turn of the decade pro golf was going brilliantly and then we went into Covid and I think those who run professional golf did an unbelievably good job in getting golf back going,” he said. “And then in 2021, 2022 this divisiveness emerged [with the formation of LIV, which then spent billions on attracting big names], it just put a big brake on the game. “The pro game, that is. Because, after seeing membership and participation falling every year from 2006 to 2018, the recreational game is now booming and to me the biggest danger for the pro game is that delinking. “You know, when people used to ask me why participation levels were falling, I would reply that if people aren’t joining your club, perhaps you haven’t got a product that they want to buy. But on the back of that Covid bounce, those clubs changed, became more inclusive, attracted families and people did want to join. “So when they ask why are those people not watching the professional game week in, week out anymore, well maybe it’s because it’s not a product they want to watch. We need to be open and honest about that, but it is fixable because when the pro game is at its best, when the best players are playing against each other on some of the best courses in the world – and not just four times a year – it’s very compelling TV.” The R&A has yet to grant the LIV Golf series guaranteed berths in the Open Championship, but Slumbers did acknowledge that access from the breakaway circuit’s order of merit could be a “possibility” for next year when the entry categories are decided in January. However, it is not believed to be likely. Slumbers also had bad news for the 47th President of the United States. While calling Trump Turnberry “my favourite links course” he reiterated that the governing body’s position has not altered regardless of his re-election to the White House. “We will not be taking any of our championships to Turnberry until we’re comfortable that the discussion would be all about golf,” he said. “But it remains in the pool of courses, subject to that one caveat.” This includes the AIG Women’s Open. Slumbers is rightly proud of the event’s standing in the female sport since the R&A assumed control of the British major. It has been part of the drive to modernise the sport and take it away from the charges of sexism, which has perhaps been his most notable success at St Andrews HQ. Another important issue in his tenure has been to work with the US Golf Association to introduce regulations that will essentially rein back how far the ball can travel in a move to protect classic layouts such as the Old Course, as well as counter environmental concerns and fears that the pro male game is becoming too one-dimensional. The new regulations will come into effect for the pros in 2028, although there have been rumblings that the PGA Tour could refuse to implement the rules. Again, Slumbers has a warning as he prepares to hand over the reins to Mark Darbon, the former Northampton Saints chief executive, on December 13. “We can’t legislate for that, but what I will say is that if a tour did choose to do that, then they would not be playing by the rules of golf,” he said. “It would be as simple as that.” Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

How long before the ultra-competitive Giannis Antetokounmpo asked out? Houston is stacked with quality young players and tradable draft picks, they make an attractive trade partner. The problem: Neither side is interested. At least not right now. Milwaukee believes it can fix its problems. It has used a soft stretch of the schedule and epic play from Antetokounmpo to win 4-of-5 and start to right the ship, with Khris Middleton possibly returning soon. The Bucks wouldn’t trade Antetokounmpo unless he demanded it, anyway. As for Houston, it wants to see how its young core will come together and not break it apart, reports Kelly Iko at The Athletic. The Rockets are not interested in breaking up their core for Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo, sources tell @TheAthletic. Houston, sitting at 10-5 and a game out of first in the West, remains focused on developing its young players as a collective. — Kelly Iko (@KellyIko) November 20, 2024 There will not be any serious Antetokounmpo trade talk until next offseason, at the earliest. Antetokounmpo's three-year contract extension, which he signed a year ago, doesn't kick in until next season. How good can a core of Alperen Sengun, Jalen Green, Jabari Smith Jr., Tari Eason and Amen Thompson be in Houston? Right now they are 11-5 and third in the West, the Rockets wisely are going to be patient and see how far Ime Udoka can lead this group. If Antetokounmpo does eventually ask out, it's easy to see the Rockets being one of the teams in the mix to land him (along with Brooklyn, and maybe Golden State, although any deal with the Warriors is challenging because of the tax aprons). For now, just enjoy watching the young Rockets play basketball, they have become one of my favorite League Pass teams of the season.",2024-11-22,0,0.69,0.31

Botic van de Zandschulp, who beat Rafael Nadal in the final match of the Spaniard's career on Tuesday, put the Dutch team 1-0 up on Friday when he defeated Daniel Altmaier in the first singles match. The world number 80 needed 10 match points to wrap up a tense 6-4 6-7 (12-14) 6-3 win. Griekspoor stopped the best-of-three tie from going to a deciding doubles as he surged back from a set down to overcome Jan-Lennard Struff 6-7 (4-7) 7-5 6-4. ""We believed in ourselves so much, we always felt this was possible so to do it now feels unbelievable,"" said Griekspoor. The Netherlands will face defending champions Italy - led by world number one Jannik Sinner - or Australia in Sunday's final. ""It's more unique that we do it because we don't have that top-five player, we don't have that top-10 player, we don't have that top-15 player - but it's a team effort,"" Netherlands captain Paul Haarhuis said. ""We have to believe in ourselves, whoever is against us, that we can do it. It's our time this year. We're here and we're going to make it count."" Three-time winners Germany were aiming to reach the final for the first time since they last won the title in 1993. They were without world number two Alexander Zverev, who said last month that he would miss the Davis Cup Finals in order to ""recover and be back at 100%"" for the 2025 season. There was a a febrile atmosphere when Van de Zandschulp faced 22-time Grand Slam winner Nadal, with some of his first-serve misses cheered by the partisan crowd. No longer the villain, there was still tension for the Dutchman as Altmaier fought back from a break down in the second set and saved five match points in a 26-point tie-break to force a deciding set. But Van de Zandschulp struck the decisive blow to break at 4-3 in the third and held his nerve to brush off a series of double faults and serve out the win at the 10th time of asking. ""I had the toughest match of my life on Tuesday so everything that comes next maybe is a little bit easier,"" Van de Zandschulp said. In a closely-fought second singles match, neither player faced a break point in the opening set and it was Struff who upped the intensity to win the resulting tie-break. However, Griekspoor battled back and his serve proved crucial as he sealed victory with his 25th ace. It meant Van de Zandschulp and Wesley Koolhof, who is set to retire after the Davis Cup, were not called to action for the deciding doubles. ""It has been an incredible journey over the last 15 or 20 years of playing tennis. I did it with a lot of passion,"" Koolhof said as his career was celebrated with a retirement ceremony after the Netherlands' win. ""We're not done, I'm not done.

However, Trump has not provided specifics on what steps he would take. “You just ban it,” he said during a Fox News town hall in October. “The president bans it. You just don’t let it happen.” There has been an increase in bills from Republicans that would limit the participation of transgender athletes in sports across the United States, but so far, they have largely targeted youth sports. The NWSL issued a policy on transgender and nonbinary athlete participation in 2021, which begins with the guiding principle of “creating a safe, non-discriminatory and inclusive environment for all of its athletes while maintaining competitive equity throughout the league.” The policy does allow challenges to an athlete’s eligibility under the policy, though the league states it “will only consider requests that are reasonable and made in good faith.” According to the league’s eligibility guidelines, any athlete assigned female at birth is eligible to play in the league, while those who are designated female at birth who are transitioning to male and are undergoing testosterone hormone therapy are ineligible to compete in the NWSL, unless their hormone levels fall under certain levels. Athletes who transition from male to female are eligible to compete if their total testosterone level is within the typical limits of women athletes over a set period. The NWSL currently only has one out transgender player, who was assigned female at birth and who identifies as nonbinary. Berman did not offer specifics when asked about whether the league has plans to handle possible issues around immigration policy changes and how, or if, international players could be affected. Over the last two World Cup cycles, women’s soccer has been subject to Trump’s attention. While he has largely focused on the now-retired U.S. women’s national team and Reign player Megan Rapinoe in 2019 and 2023, he has also been highly critical of the U.S. women’s team. Following the USWNT’s exit from the 2023 World Cup in a penalty shoot-out with Sweden, Trump posted on Truth Social that the loss was “fully emblematic of what is happening to our once great Nation under Crooked Joe Biden.” “Many of our players were openly hostile to America — No other country behaved in such a manner, or even close,” he added. On Friday, Berman did not provide much in the way of specifics of any potential additional protections the league would put in place for players or staff, especially in the context of a player having been criticized previously. “We’re committed to ensuring that our players and our staff get all of their needs met, whether that’s healthcare, other protections around mental health — any support that anyone needs in our ecosystem,” Berman said.

On Tuesday, the Los Angeles Sparks announced they hired longtime Utah head coach Lynne Roberts, who jumps from college basketball to the professional ranks for the first time in her career. Her hiring came a week after the Atlanta Dream hired Karl Smesko, Florida Gulf Coast’s coach of more than 20 seasons. Two leading offensive minds — in the college game — are now WNBA head coaches. While rare for WNBA franchises to turn to college coaches to fill vacancies, multiple league sources told that they’re being targeted more than in past years. Part of the change is financial. Salaries for WNBA head coaches in 2024 ranged from around $350,000 to just over $1 million annually, multiple league sources said, a nearly double increase from even five years ago. According to USA Today’s salary database, Roberts earned around $700,000 at Utah last season, while Smesko earned around $450,000. It’s safe to assume their franchises provided them with comparable pay or pay bumps. Hiring college coaches from either mid-major programs or less-established Power 5 programs has always been more realistic (and cheaper) than hiring from the upper echelon of college basketball. With more comparable salaries (and a willingness from WNBA teams to pay buyouts), pro opportunities have become more appealing, especially amid changing dynamics like conference realignments, NIL and high transfer rates in college athletics. Conflicting schedules — Roberts and Smesko left their programs with their seasons already underway — no longer seem to be as much of a deterrent either.  Scenes from our introductory press conference for our NEW head coach. pic.twitter.com/CU2dce9pcW  — Los Angeles Sparks (@LASparks) November 22, 2024 Yet, a WNBA franchise had not hired a coach without NBA, G League or prior WNBA (player, assistant or head coach) experience since the Chicago Sky hired Pokey Chatman in 2011 from Spartak Moscow after her tenure at LSU. Roberts and Smesko’s hirings could send signals to the rest of women’s basketball that the college-to-pro coaching route might be a viable pipeline, depending on how well they perform in the WNBA. Their arrivals also underscore changes in how the WNBA game is played, as increased awareness of offensive efficiency, by way of 3s and layups, is central to success. Roberts and Smesko are known for their offensive philosophies. Smesko put an overwhelming emphasis on 3-point shots (since 2009-10 — the first year data is available via Her Hoop Stats — FGCU has finished in the top four of Division I in 3-point attempt rate every season). Over the last three seasons under Roberts, Utah ranked No. 1 in 3-point field goal attempts, second in offensive ratings at the rim and third in effective field goal percentage. After attempting a league-low 14.9 3s per game last year, the Chicago Sky made a similar philosophical decision in hiring Tyler Marsh. Natalie Nakase should bring modern offensive principles to the Golden State Valkyries as well, just as Nate Tibbetts did last season, when he went from the NBA to the Phoenix Mercury. (The New York Liberty led the league last season with 29 3-point attempts per game. The Mercury and Liberty set a WNBA record with 33 combined 3-pointers in a game last season.) The WNBA is continuing to shift, in more ways than one. Three head coach openings remain: the Washington Mystics, Dallas Wings and Connecticut Sun. The Wings’ recently hired general manager Curt Miller called their ongoing search “global.” (More on Dallas’ developments later.) The Sun are replacing Stephanie White, who took the Indiana Fever job shortly after Connecticut announced their split. White recently confirmed that her top two assistants, Briann January and Austin Kelly, interviewed for head coach jobs this cycle. It wouldn’t be shocking to see either end up as the Sun’s next head coach. If neither is elevated, one or both could follow White to Indiana. After a decorated playing career, which includes nine seasons with the Fever, January will enter her third season as a WNBA coach. She is well-regarded around the league and is currently coaching as an assistant with the Detroit Pistons’ G League affiliate, the Motor City Cruise. Kelly had years of college experience before joining the Sun, including working as the director of recruiting under White at Vanderbilt. His wife, Karima Christmas-Kelly, was a Fever assistant for the past two seasons. White said she hopes to keep them working together by bringing them to Indiana. “I would love to keep Karima on board,” White said. After parting ways with general manager Mike Thibault and coach Eric Thibault about a month ago, the Mystics are still moving through their search. They want to hire a coach and GM by Jan. 1, a person with knowledge of the process confirmed to . Like Los Angeles and Atlanta, the Mystics’ management group has hired a search firm to identify prospective candidates. The Washington Post was first to report their possible timeline and search firm. Coincidentally or not, so far this cycle both hires involving coaches resulted in college hires. Firing Weatherspoon just 11 months after the Chicago Sky hired her surprised many — including Weatherspoon. Co-owner Nadia Rawlinson had lauded her upon hire as “the perfect choice to build on our championship culture and usher in an exciting new era.” “It wasn’t a decision I saw coming,” Weatherspoon said Wednesday, speaking publicly about the firing for the first time. Weatherspoon, who was replaced by Marsh on Nov. 2, has already moved on. She’s one of six head coaches hired for the inaugural season of Unrivaled, the upstart 3×3 winter basketball league which begins Jan. 17. But she didn’t rule out a possible return to the WNBA next season. “That is to be seen,” Weatherspoon said. “One thing about me is I don’t run from anything. I don’t have to hide from anything. I don’t have to answer anything. Because I know how hard I worked. And I know that the opportunity for me will come and I’ll be ready.” A possible fit could be in Las Vegas, as the Aces still have an assistant coach opening following the departures of both Nakase and Marsh. (They announced Ty Ellis as one of their new assistants.) Weatherspoon was a longtime teammate of Aces head coach Becky Hammon and the two remain close friends. The decision to join Unrivaled isn’t expected to hinder Weatherspoon, or any of the league’s other coaches, from other potential WNBA coaching jobs. Unrivaled ends March 17, more than a month before WNBA training camps are expected to begin. Two of the league’s other coaches — Andrew Wade and Nola Henry — were also on WNBA staffs last season and could be back in the W this summer. Entering this college season, Smesko boasted the third-highest winning percentage among active college coaches behind UConn’s Geno Auriemma and LSU’s Kim Mulkey. So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that teams have tried to hire Smesko away from FGCU before. Over the years, Smesko interviewed with Indiana, Illinois and Oregon State, among others. In 2017, he turned down an offer from USC, according to Sports Illustrated. Smesko said that several years ago he interviewed for a WNBA head coaching opportunity only to have it fall through “at the last minute.” (He declined to identify the team.) “When another opportunity arose, I wanted to hear about it,” Smesko said about the Dream. “Just everything has really meshed well with what they’re looking for and what I think my strengths as a coach are.” Don’t expect an immediate turnaround in Dallas. Although Miller said Sunday that in recent years, No. 1 picks have changed the trajectory of teams, the impact has seldom fully manifested in top picks’ rookie seasons. In the last decade, only one No. 1 pick (Jackie Young) has been on a team that finished that first season over .500. The Sparks fired Miller as their head coach after two years this offseason, but he nearly came to the Wings two years earlier. He was a finalist for the Wings’ head coach opening in 2023 before eventually taking the Sparks job, league sources said. That prior relationship was important in Miller taking the GM job years later. Miller said he’s seeing “a tremendous amount of interest” in the head coach position, which he expects to pick up more following the lottery results. The broad assumption is the Wings would take UConn’s Paige Bueckers, who could transform the franchise. Assuming they keep the selection, the Wings will be the fourth franchise in five years to have a new head coach pair with a No. 1 pick (the lone exception was Christie Sides last season with the Fever). In the cases of Sides in 2023, Tanisha Wright in 2022 and Vickie Johnson in 2021, each was hired before the WNBA Draft Lottery. The Liberty hired coach Walt Hopkins after the 2020 lottery, having secured the top pick. Smith, the former Liberty head coach and longtime Minnesota Lynx assistant, took an assistant role at Ohio State as the next step in her career. The news came despite Smith, a Hall of Fame player and a W coach for a decade, widely being considered a popular candidate to land one of this offseason’s many openings. Smith most recently was the associate head coach of the Lynx. She was the head coach of the Liberty for two seasons, but her tenure came during a period of drastic transition within the franchise as it relocated from Madison Square Garden to Westchester County Center and experienced a significant drop in resources.

CBSSports.com Headlines,2024 RSM Classic scores: Joel Dahmen inches closer to goal as Patrick Fishburn leads after Round 2,https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/2024-rsm-classic-scores-joel-dahmen-inches-closer-to-goal-as-patrick-fishburn-leads-after-round-2/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 23:32:16 +0000",Dahmen needs to finish within the top 125 in the FedEx Cup standings to maintain his full PGA Tour status,"ST. SIMONS ISLAND, Ga. (AP) -- PGA Tour rookie Patrick Fishburn played bogey-free for an 8-under 64 for his first lead after any round. Joel Dahmen was 10 shots behind and had a bigger cause for celebration Friday in the RSM Classic. Dahmen made a 5-foot par putt on his final hole for a 2-under 68 in tough conditions brought on by the wind and cold, allowing him to make the cut on the number and get two more days to secure his PGA Tour card for next year. He is No. 124 in the FedEx Cup. ""I still got more to write this weekend for sure,"" said Dahmen, who recently had said his story is not yet over. ""But without having the opportunity to play this weekend, my story would be a lot shorter this year."" Fishburn took advantage of being on the easier Plantation course, with trees blocking the brunt of the wind and two additional par 5s. He also was helped by Maverick McNealy, who opened with a 62 on the tougher Seaside course, making two bogeys late in his round and having to settle for a 70. Fishburn, who already has locked up his card for next year, was at 11-under 131 and led McNealy and Lee Hodges (63) going into the weekend. Michael Thorbjornsen had a 69 and was the only player who had to face Seaside on Friday who was among the top five. What mattered on this day, however, was far down the leaderboard. The RSM Classic is the final tournament of the PGA Tour season, and only the top 125 in the FedEx Cup have full status in 2025. That's more critical than ever with the tour only taking the top 100 for full cards after next season. Players like Dahmen will need full status to get as many playing opportunities as they can. That explains why he felt so much pressure on a Friday. He didn't make a bogey after his opening hole and was battling temperatures in the low 50s that felt even colder with the wind ripping off the Atlantic waters of St. Simons Sound. He made a key birdie on the 14th, hitting a 4-iron for his second shot on the 424-yard hole. Dahmen also hit wedge to 2 feet on the 16th that put him on the cut line, and from the 18th fairway, he was safely on the green some 40 feet away. But he lagged woefully short, leaving himself a testy 5-footer with his job on the line. ""It was a great putt. I was very nervous,"" Dahmen said. ""But there's still work to do. It wasn't the game-winner, it was like the half-court shot to get us to halftime. But without that, and the way I played today, I wouldn't have anything this weekend."" His playing partners weren't so fortunate. The tour put three in danger of losing their cards in the same group -- Zac Blair (No. 123), Dahmen and Wesley Bryan (No. 125). The cut was at 1-under 141. Blair and Bryan came to the 18th hole needing birdie to be assured of making the cut and both narrowly missed. Now they have to wait to see if anyone passes them, which is typically the case. Thorbjornsen in a tie for fourth and Daniel Berger (66 at Plantation) in a tie for 17th both were projected to move into the top 125. Dahmen, indeed, still has work to do. Fishburn gets a weekend to see if he can end his rookie year with a win. ""I've had a lot of experience playing in cold growing up in Utah, playing this time of year, kind of get used to playing when the body's not moving very well and you've got to move your hands,"" said Fishburn, who played college golf at BYU. ""Just pretty happy with how I played."" Ludvig Aberg, the defending champion and No. 5 player in the world competing for the first time in more than two months because of knee surgery, bounced back with a 64 on Plantation and was back in the mix. Aberg played with Luke Clanton, the Florida State sophomore who looks like he belongs each week. Clanton, the No. 1 player in the world amateur ranking who received a sponsor exemption, had a 65 at Plantation and was two shots off the lead. Clanton already has a runner-up and two other top 10s since June. ""Playing with him, it's pretty awesome to watch,"" Clanton said. ""We were kind of fanboying a little it. I know he's a really good dude but to be playing with him and to see what he's done over the last couple years, it's pretty inspirational."" Copyright 2024 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

They will host the Sacramento Kings  at 10:30  p.m.  ET at Intuit Dome. The Clippers might want some stickum for this one  as the team gave up 22 turnovers  on Wednesday.  The Kings are hoping to do what the Magic couldn't  on Wednesday: put an end to the Clippers' winning streak, which now stands at three games. The Clippers came out on top against the Magic by a score of  104-93.  The Clippers  smashed the offensive glass and  finished the game with 15  offensive rebounds. They easily outclassed their opponents in that department as the Magic only pulled down two.  Meanwhile,  the point spread  may have favored the Kings  last Monday, but the final result did not. They were just a bucket shy of victory  and fell  109-108 to the Hawks.  The losing side was boosted by   Keon Ellis, who  went 9 for 15 from beyond the arc en route to 33 points plus six  rebounds. Those nine  threes gave  him a new career-high.  Los Angeles' win was  their sixth straight at home, which  pushed their record up to 9-7. As for Sacramento, their loss dropped their record down to 8-7. Keep an eye on the arc in  Friday's  contest:  The Clippers have been dynamite from deep this season,  having  made 38.2% of their  threes per game. It's a different story for the Kings, though, as  they've  only  made 34% of their  threes this season. Given the Clippers' sizable advantage in that area, the Kings will need to find a way to close that gap.  The Clippers beat the Kings 107-98  in their previous meeting  two weeks ago. Will the Clippers repeat their success,  or do  the Kings have a better game plan this time around? We'll find out soon enough.  Sacramento is a 3-point favorite against Los Angeles, according to the latest NBA odds. The line on this game has moved quite a bit since it opened, as it started out with the Clippers as a 5.5-point favorite. The over/under is 220.5  points.

This will be the third midweek game in a row for both teams, who haven't seen the Saturday spotlight since late October.  After a three-day break, coverage returns Saturday afternoon with a pivotal Conference USA clash between Sam Houston and Jacksonville State. Both the Bearcats and the Gamecocks have their eyes firmly set on the conference crown, with this game serving as a huge stepping stone to that point.  Viewers will get their Mountain West fill Saturday as the rest of the CBS Sports Network slate features a MWC triple-feature.

Jacksonville State remains unbeaten in league play with a sterling 6-0 record and is closing in on its first C-USA Championship Game appearance in program history, while Sam Houston currently sits in third -- the Bearkats have the same 5-1 conference record as Western Kentucky but lost the head to head -- amid a miraculous turnaround season. This is the same Sam Houston team that went 3-9 last season, with two C-USA wins, in its first year as an FBS program. In fact, both Jacksonville State and Sam Houston made the transition from the FCS last season, so for two recent transplants to be in this position is impressive.

Three of those games came against teams that were ranked in the most recent AP Top 25, including a head-to-head contest against College Football Playoff contender Boise State. That skid all but knocked San Diego State out of the bowl race, but there's still pride to play for, and the schedule does open up a bit over the last couple of weeks. Utah State has taken its fair share of knocks this season. The Aggies share an identical 3-7 record with the Aztecs, though they have won two out of their last three games to build some late-year momentum. There could be some fireworks in this showdown: San Diego State and Utah State allow a combined 67.4 points per game.   Date: Saturday, Nov. 23 | Time: 7 p.m. ET Location: War Memorial Stadium -- Laramie, WyomingTV: CBS Sports Network [Channel finder] Live stream: CBSSports.com | Mobile: CBS Sports App (Free)Spread: Boise State -22.5 | Will the Broncos cover?

After winning three of its first four MWC games by at least 21 points, Boise State got taken to the brink against a now 3-8 Nevada squad in Week 11, escaping with a narrow 28-21 win. Then, last Saturday, the Broncos trailed San Jose State 21-14 entering the third quarter before scoring 28 unanswered points to pull away late.

Granted, they've only faced off against one team with a winning record amid their five-game winning streak -- and that will not change as they take on Fresno State -- but there's something to be said about taking care of business amid a chaotic year. As for Fresno State, the Bulldogs, at 5-5, are one win away from bowl eligibility.

According to the Associated Press, which obtained a copy of the memo, the league urged players to take additional precautions when away from home. Those precautions ranged from updating alarm systems and keeping valuables in safes to using ""protective guard services"" during road trips and even having dogs around for security purposes. In September, while Minnesota Timberwolves guard Mike Conley was attending a Minnesota Vikings game, burglars broke into his house and stole jewelry, Medina Police Chief Jason Nelson told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. In November, Milwaukee Bucks center Bobby Portis said ""most of my prized possessions"" had been stolen from his house while he was at a game and offered a $40,000 reward for any information that led to the return of the stolen items. According to the memo, the FBI has connected recent burglaries to ""transnational South American Theft Groups."" These ""reportedly well-organized, sophisticated"" crime rings ""incorporate advanced techniques and technologies, including pre-surveillance, drones, and signal jamming devices."" The FBI believes that the rings are ""primarily focused on cash and items that can be resold on the black market, such as jewelry, watches, and luxury bags.""

Purdy will be replaced by 32-year-old Brandon Allen, who has a 2-7 regular-season record and hasn't played in a regular-season game since 2022.  The 49ers have been the favored team in 36 straight games. That's the third-longest stretch during the Super Bowl era, behind the 1999-02 Rams (50) and the 2016-20 Patriots (64). Those Rams teams played in two Super Bowls, winning one. The Patriots won two Super Bowls over that span and joined the 1971-73 Dolphins and 1990-93 Bills as the only teams to play in three straight Super Bowls.  Purdy isn't the only notable 49ers player who will not play on Sunday. Former Defensive Player of the Year Nick Bosa also won't play, while perennial All-Pro tackle Trent Williams is questionable.  Despite his team's battered state, Shanahan is keeping the faith as far as Sunday's game is concerned. While they won't have Purdy and Bosa, the 49ers still have some of the league's top players, specifically wideout Deebo Samuel, running back Christian McCaffrey, linebacker Fred Warner and tight end George Kittle.  ""We've had a real good week of practice,"" Shanahan said on Friday. ""I know it's disappointing. We knew there was a chance for Nick, I think the guys were a little surprised with Brock yesterday, but we addressed all of that today.  ""We're gonna have 48 guys in uniform. Our guys believe in themselves. I believe in them. We're missing two good players, definitely, but we've got a lot of good players out there. By no means, we don't have a chance to win.

Teams have until Friday, Nov. 22, to decide which arbitration-eligible players they'll tender a contract to for next season, and which they'll allow to become free agents earlier than expected. You may have heard of the concept of ""non-tendering"" a player. If so (or even if not), allow us to break it down into more malleable terms. Most players become eligible for arbitration after logging three years of service time. (Some earn that designation after two years -- these are called ""Super Two"" players.) From there, they're afforded the opportunity to make more money than the league minimum they earned beforehand. The downside to earning more money, if one exists, is that teams are more likely to sever ties with that player if they feel their salary outpaces their production. In turn, that can result in the player being non-tendered, or freed from their commitment to their team at no cost (financial or otherwise) to the club itself. Being non-tendered doesn't necessarily mean the player is done or useless. Last year's crop included, among others, lefty reliever Tim Hill, right-handers Spencer Turnbull and Cooper Criswell, and infielder Nick Senzel. Each had a productive 2024 in their own ways. Just who might find themselves attempting to follow on those players' cleatprints come 2025? Below, we've highlighted 10 players we think are bubble cases. In each instance, we've rendered a prediction on whether or not the player will be tendered. It should be noted that this is more of an art than a science, and that this article uses the arbitration prizes projected by Matt Swartz's model at MLB Trade Rumors. Now, to the reason you clicked.  McCormick is fresh off a career-worst showing that saw him lose more than 50 points from each of the triple-slash categories. His underlying measures didn't fare much better: he struck out more often and walked and barrelled the ball less often. Nonetheless, there's enough track record and upside here (even now he's sporting a career 108 OPS+) that we suspect the Astros are OK tendering him a contract and seeing if he can rebound in what will serve as his age-30 season. Prediction: Tendered Manoah is only two seasons removed from finishing third in Cy Young Award balloting. You can be forgiven if it feels as though far more time has elapsed. Manoah performed better this past season than he did in 2023, albeit in a limited sample. He made just five big-league appearances (and 10 overall) before succumbing to season-ending elbow surgery. Manoah is expected to miss at least the beginning of the 2025 campaign as well. The Blue Jays have several more seasons of team control on the line, suggesting that they'll keep him around through at least one more winter. Prediction: Tendered As with the aforementioned Manoah, it's been a long two years for McKenzie. Whereas he appeared to be a building block back in 2022, he's since posted an ERA over 5.00 in 20 big-league outings. He split this past year between the majors and the minors, showing reduced velocity and command. McKenzie is now 27 years old and out of options. We could see the Guardians deciding to move on. Prediction: Non-tendered A logical midseason acquisition that just didn't work out as planned. Hays appeared in 22 games with the Phillies after coming over from Baltimore, hitting .256/.275/.397 (86 OPS+) and missing time because of a hamstring injury and a kidney infection. Those ailments weren't his fault, of course, but we wonder if the Phillies would prefer to redirect the money earmarked for him toward a bigger fish. Prediction: Non-tendered This time a year ago, Bednar was coming off consecutive All-Star Game appearances and was a prime trade candidate. The Pirates held onto him instead and … well, here he is after a season that saw every part of his statistical profile worsen. We doubt the Pirates will sever ties through a non-tender. One source we spoke to predicted a trade was more likely. Should that come to fruition, it ought to serve as a reminder to non-contenders to always move elite relievers sooner than later. Prediction: Tendered The Rays added Carlson, a sensible buy-low candidate, in a minor deadline trade with the Cardinals. He started shockingly hot with Tampa Bay, posting an .836 OPS through his first 10 games that made it seem like his long-awaited breakout had arrived. He then cratered from there, hitting .212/.280/.259 in his subsequent 27 contests to round out the year. We could see this one going either way: even the Rays can afford a $2.7 million gamble, but it's hard for us to argue Carlson merits the investment given his big-league career to date. Prediction: Non-tendered Vaughn, the No. 3 pick in the 2019 draft, is nearing his age-27 season. My, how the time flies. Unfortunately for Vaughn, he hasn't affirmed his amateur hype. He'll embark on the new year having delivered a 101 OPS+ over the course of his first four big-league seasons. There's not much underlying reason to believe that better days are coming, though the White Sox may conclude they're fine giving him one more bite at the apple before getting serious about finding an upgrade at the cold corner. Prediction: Tendered Blackburn appeared five times for the Mets after coming over from Oakland in a deadline trade. He missed all of September and the entirety of New York's run to the NLCS after experiencing a spinal fluid leak in his back. That doesn't sound particularly pleasant to us. What's worse is that the Mets, who nailed almost all of their pitching bets last winter, might decide they'd rather have the $4 million to throw at a pitcher with a little better track record of durability. Prediction: Non-tendered Three full seasons have passed since Baddoo posted a two-win season and appeared to be a Rule 5 success story in the making. During that period, he's played in 216 games and has compiled a .619 OPS. Baddoo is still on the younger side (he celebrated his 26th birthday back in August), but we think the Tigers will pass on paying him this kind of coin -- especially after making a surprise playoff run. Prediction: Non-tendered The Rockies reportedly desire to reduce their payroll ahead of next season. Shedding Quantrill's potential $9 million commitment would be one way to do that. Although he got off to a good start, he was terrible down the stretch. In seven appearances across August and September, he surrendered 23 runs on 37 hits while walking more batters (24) than he struck out (20). We doubt the Rockies will even be able to find a trade partner given Quantrill's cost, leaving them with just one option. Prediction: Non-tendered",2024-11-22,0,0.65,0.35

They will welcome the Dallas Mavericks  at 10:00  p.m.  ET on Friday at Ball Arena. Coming in fresh off a  win as the underdog, the Nuggets will stroll into this one as the favorite.  Last Tuesday, the Nuggets beat the Grizzlies 122-110.  The Nuggets' success was the result of a balanced attack that saw several players step up, but  Jamal Murray led the charge by  posting 27 points plus six  assists and three  steals. What's more,  Murray also racked up five  threes, the most he's  had since back in April.  The Nuggets were working as a unit and  finished the game with 29  assists (they're ranked second in  assists per game overall). They easily outclassed their opponents in that department as the Grizzlies only racked up 24.  Meanwhile,  winning is always nice, but doing so behind a season-high score is even better  (just ask the Mavericks). They steamrolled past the Pelicans 132-91  on Tuesday. The  victory was familiar territory for Dallas who have now won three  matches in a row.  Luka Doncic was the offensive standout of the  matchup as he  went 10 for 16 en route to 26 points plus five  assists and five  rebounds. He had some trouble finding  his footing against the Spurs on Saturday, so this was a step in the right direction.  Denver is  on a roll lately: they've  won six of their last eight contests,  which provided a nice bump to their 8-5 record  this season. As for Dallas, they now  have a winning record of 8-7.  The Nuggets came out on top in a nail-biter against the Mavericks when the teams last played  two weeks ago, sneaking past  122-120. One of the biggest obstacles the team faced in that game was  the Mavericks'  Kyrie Irving, who  went 6 for 8 from beyond the arc en route to 43 points plus five  assists and five  rebounds. Now that he's  got a second chance to win this matchup, will the Nuggets still be able to contain  Irving? There's only one way to find out.

The Argentines fought back to edge Corinthians 4-3 on aggregate in the semifinals while the Brazilians narrowly overcame Lanus 1-0 to advance 2-1 over two legs. Racing Club will make their first appearance at a continental final since the 1989 Recopa Sudamericana which they lost 1-0 to Nacional of Uruguay. Gustavo Costas's men are in good form with five consecutive wins across all competitions and a win here would bring a first CONMEBOL title since the 1967 Copa Libertadores.  The last Argentine side to win the Copa Sudamericana was Defensa y Justicia back in 2020 while Racing have not lost to Brazilian opponents at home this edition. However, Cruzeiro overcame Lanus in Buenos Aires to get here and could put that record to the test. Fernando Diniz has never lost in a CONMEBOL final at club level with Fluminense winning the Copa Libertadores one year ago and the 2024 Recopa Sudamericana. Cruzeiro, though, have lost two of their last three games across all competitions. With only one goal conceded in six away Sudamericana games, a 1-0 loss to Boca Juniors in the round of 16 is their only loss on the road. Brazilian sides have lost the last two Sudamericana finals with Athletico Paranaense the last to buck that trend in 2021 and Cruzeiro 's last continental success came in 1997's Copa Libertadores. Here's our storylines, how you can watch the match and more: Racing topped Group H with five wins from six and just one loss for the top seeding before demolishing Chile's Huachipato 8-1 on aggregate in the round of 16. Then it was overcoming Brazil's Athletico Paranaense 4-2 over two legs in the quarterfinals before edging Corinthians 4-3 in the semifinals to get here. Cruzeiro topped Group B with three wins and three draws from six for the seventh of  eight seeded berths before needing penalties to oust Boca Juniors in the round of 16 after a 2-2 draw over two legs. A 3-1 win over Paraguay's Libertad in the quarterfinals followed before the 2-1 triumph against Lanus in the semifinals which booked this date. Racing: Roger Martinez and Santiago Solari came in last time out but are unlikely to start ahead of Maximiliano Salas and the tournament's joint-top goal scorer Adrian Martinez here. Juan Fernando Quintero's brace advanced them this far and he should also start just behind the front two. Possible Racing XI: Arias; Martirena, Di Cesare, Garcia Basso, Rojas; Almendra, Sosa, Nardoni; Quintero, A. Martinez, Salas. Cruzeiro: Rafa Silva is injured and likely to miss out while Gabriel Veron, Matheus Pereira and Kaio Jorge are eligible despite domestic suspension last weekend. Jorge was the semifinal hero while Cassio kept his second clean sheet of the competition to get here and both will also start. Possible Cruzeiro XI: Cassio; William, Marcelo, Villalba, Xavier; Romero, Walace; Veron, Pereira, Diaz; Jorge. It should be tight but something has to give so do not be surprised if Racing nick it by a goal despite Cruzeiro's solid defense. Pick: Racing 2, Cruzeiro 1.",2024-11-22,1,0.43,0.57

While the playoff races are starting to take over the talk of the league, the injury reports are also piling up as all 32 teams enter the home stretch. Let's take a look at how each NFL team is faring from a health standpoint. Below is a rundown of every team's initial injury report entering this week's games.  Cornerback Marshon Lattimore hasn't practiced since joining the Commanders and once again didn't practice Friday. He will be out against the Cowboys. The Chiefs will once again be without running back Isiah Pacheco, despite reports that he was expected to be back. All NFL sports betting odds courtesy of BetMGM. The Panthers had a lengthy injury report this week. Kicker Eddy Pineiro, who is the league's most accurate kicker of all-time, is questionable after not practicing Friday. Running back Miles Sanders is the only player out ahead of Sunday, as he didn't practice all week, while wide receiver Adam Thielen was limited all week and is questionable.  The Chiefs were expected to get running back Isiah Pacheco (ankle) back this week, but the team announced he is out. With a short week ahead of them -- they play the Raiders on Black Friday -- the Chiefs' coaches and trainers felt it was best for Pacheco to remain sidelined, despite him being healthy enough to play. Charles Omenihu (IR) is also out.  The Vikings had quarterback Sam Darnold (foot) listed on the initial injury report, but he was a full participant Thursday and Friday after being limited Wednesday. He has no game designation. Running back Aaron Jones (ribs) was a full participant in practice all week and is clear to play. A surprise to see running back D'Andre Swift on the injury report for the Bears, as he's battling a groin injury and is questionable. Swift did not practice Wednesday and was limited the rest of the week.  The Titans had quite a few players listed on the injury report. Cornerback L'Jarius Sneed and running rack Tyjae Spears are among those sidelined this Sunday.  For the Texans, pass rusher Will Anderson Jr. (ankle) was limited to start the week after he missed last week's game, but was a full participant Friday and has no game designation. Cornerback Derek Stingley Jr. was also limited Wednesday and Thursday, but improved as a full participant by Friday. As you can see, the Lions are dealing with injuries at cornerback. Fortunately for them, Moseley was a full practice participant throughout the week. Arnold was a full participant Friday after being limited Thursday.  Tackle Bernhard Raimann (knee) was the only nonparticipant to start the week and he is officially listed as out. Defensive end Tyquan Lewis was a full participant, but is questionable.  It would almost be easier to name the Patriots who aren't on the injury report. With the exception of Barmore, every Patriot with a questionable designation was limited during Friday's practice. Gonzalez was limited Friday after not appearing on the injury report on Wednesday and Thursday.  For the Dolphins, Armstead didn't practice all week, while McMorris was questionable despite being a full practice participant all week. Ingold and Wynn were limited Friday.  The Buccaneers are expected to have wide receiver Mike Evans (hamstring) back Sunday, as he was a limited participant Friday after practicing in full the previous day. Conversely, Giants wide receiver Malik Nabers did not practice Friday due to a groin injury and is questionable. Kayvon Thibodeaux was limited Wednesday but was a full participant the rest of the week.  All-Pro cornerback DaRon Bland is set to make his season debut after not getting an injury designation for Sunday. Also suiting up for the Cowboys is wideout CeeDee Lamb, who showed up on the injury report this week with back and foot injuries.  The Commanders will be without Marshon Lattimore, who hasn't practiced since he was traded to the team. Each of Washington's questionable players were full practice participants Friday.  Allen's loss would be significant as he is one of the Broncos' top defenders with five sacks and a dozen tackles for loss through 11 games. Jordan Jackson, a 2022 sixth-round pick, is slate to start in the event that Allen can't go.  The Raiders are hurt at several positions, including at running back. Backups Ameer Abdullah and Dylan Laube are in line to split the reps in the event that White and Mattison can't go.  With Purdy out, veteran quarterback Brandon Allen will start in his place. Allen, 32, has attempted just three passes in a regular season game over the past three years. His last start in the NFL occurred in 2021 as a member of the Cincinnati Bengals. Allen has nine career starts under his belt, going 2-7.  For the Packers, Eric Stokes is slated to start in place of Alexander. A former first-round pick, Stokes has made six starts this season.  Each of Arizona's questionable players were limited during Friday's practice. In Seattle, both Fant and Shenault practiced in full Friday, which is obviously a good sign for Sunday's game.  Eagles edge rusher Bryce Huff (wrist) did not practice this week as he underwent wrist surgery. With Smith out, expect a bigger workload Sunday from fellow wideout A.J. Brown, tight ends Dallas Goedert and Grant Calcaterra and running back Saquon Barkley.  They're not out of the woods, but the Rams' injury situation is significantly better than it was during the season's first month. If Havenstein can't go, Warren McClendon Jr. is in line to start in his place. A 2023 fifth-round pick, McClendon has already made three starts this season.  Analysis to come",2024-11-22,0,0.58,0.42

The only remaining player from Orlando's previous playoff run in 2017, the Brazilian is playing in her first NWSL final ever with a chance to cement her legacy. But at 38 and being out of contract at the end of the season, there are questions about what's next for her. Earlier in the season, Marta hinted that this could be her final season in Orlando, and reflecting on the season with CBS Sports, the subject came up again.  ""It's been eight years here with Orlando, and it's the first time that we go to a final. It's a coincidence, but I don't know. It's some answer for me, for myself. Why am I still here,"" Marta said. ""Why am I looking to build something special for this team? I don't know if I'm going to be here next year, but I'm already so happy with what I have given to the club and the players."" A post shared by Attacking Third (@attackingthird) Marta reflected on how special this season has been for Orlando with the club setting records left and right. Marta became the oldest goal scorer and oldest outfield player in club history. Barbra Banda became the team's record scorer in all competitions for NWSL with 16 goals. They set a record for the biggest win in club history, the longest shutout streak in club history and so much more en route to winning the NWSL Shield while they now look to do the double.  ""No matter what happens in the final, this season for me and for the team has been the best season so far. Orlando never had played a consistent game as we have done in this season from beginning to end,"" Marta said, as she began to hold back tears. If this is Marta's final season in Orlando, she'll be able to go out on top with a lasting legacy but first, there's another trophy in her sights to close out this season on the highest note possible.",2024-11-22,0,0.84,0.16

The game will tip off at 4 p.m. ET at Pauley Pavilion. Dawn Staley has turned South Carolina into a budding dynasty. In the past three seasons, South Carolina has won two national championships and only lost three games. However, Cori Close's Bruins have also gained momentum over the past few seasons with back-to-back Sweet 16 appearances. The two programs have only met four times since 2015, and South Carolina has won every time. Their most recent encounter was in the 2023 Sweet 16, where the Bruins were defeated, 59-43. Here is what you need to know ahead of Sunday's matchup: In 2024, South Carolina became the 10th Division I women's basketball team to ever complete a perfect season. Most of the key pieces returned this year, minus Kamilla Cardoso, who is now with the WNBA's Chicago Sky. The most dangerous element of last season's squad was its depth. The same can be said for the 2024-25 Gamecocks, as six players are averaging more than seven points per game thus far. Ahead of the season, Staley said her program is ""next woman up"" and gave fans a heads up that Chloe Kitts, who averaged less than 20 minutes per game last season, was one of the players who made the biggest jump this offseason. Now, Kitts is leading the team with 14 points and 9.8 rebounds per game. A player who is not in the starting lineup but is certainly impactful is MiLaysia Fulwiley, who Staley often describes as a generational talent. She is averaging 12.8 points, and her impressive athletic abilities are exactly why she is described as a walking highlight reel. Meanwhile, freshman Joyce Edwards is showing a lot of potential already with 9.6 points and 5.2 boards per game. The Gamecocks earned a program-record 43rd straight win with a 77-45 victory over Clemson on Wednesday. Earlier this season, South Carolina also became the second Division I team to reach multiple 40-game winning streaks, joining UConn, which has done so four times. UCLA is coming off a 101-52 win against Arkansas, which marked the highest point total and largest point differential for the team so far this season. Like the Gamecocks, the Bruins boast significant depth with seven players averaging double figures, and their 84.8 points per game places them 26th nationally.  Lauren Betts is leading the team with 21.5 points and 11.5 rebounds per game. She has been a star at UCLA since last season, but coach Cori Close also benefited from top returners like Kiki Rice, Gabriela Jaquez and Londynn Jones.  One of the Bruins' biggest highlights this season has been Oregon State transfer Timea Gardiner, who ranks among the top 10 players nationally in 3-point percentage (57.7%). Her long-range shooting abilities were on full display against Arkansas, as Gardiner scored a career-high 23 points while going 7 of 12 from beyond the arc.",2024-11-22,1,0.27,0.73

If they are to close the nine point gap on Liverpool they are going to need to get on the sort of winning run that has eluded them over the first 11 games of the campaign. Their first attempt could well be a tricky one. Nottingham Forest are the only team to have beaten the league leaders so far this season and their resolute defense has fired them into fifth spot in the table, trailing the Gunners only on goal difference. Not since March 1989 have Forest won at Arsenal in the league, but Nuno Espirito Santo's side are impressive road operators with five wins and two draws from their last seven. Making that six from eight would be quite the way to spoil Mikel Arteta's big day as he celebrates 250 games in charge of Arsenal. Here is how you can watch the match and what you need to know: Arsenal: The presence of Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice, Riccardo Calafiori and Leandro Trossard on the training field on Friday was welcome news for an Arsenal side whose injury problems never seem to fully ease. The latter limped out of Belgium's defeat to Israel but that proved to be a contact injury. Saka and Rice had not even joined up with England but Arteta confirmed they had had ""partial sessions"" while Calafiori, out for a month with a knee issue, is also on the comeback trail. Arteta meanwhile confirmed that Ben White will be out for ""months,"" CBS Sports understands between two and three of them. Takehiro Tomiyasu might have been able to ease the pressure on the right back position but he will be away from the club for several weeks after multiple setbacks in his recovery from a knee injury. ""He's one of the guys where the only thing he wants to do is to work 24 hours to get better and he feels terrible when he's not fit, so it's a real shame,"" said Arteta. ""We're going to give him the best opportunity to try and unlock something to help him to have him back as quickly as possible, but I think we need to be patient."" Possible Arsenal XI: Raya; Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Rice, Odegaard, Merino; Saka, Havertz, Martinelli Nottingham Forest: Nuno opted to play his cards close to his chest in his pre-match press conference, stating that there's ""some situations to manage and decide"" in a squad that otherwise does not appear to have major issues. Ola Aina and Elliott Anderson both returned from international duty early but are expected to be available. Long term absentees Danilo and Ibrahima Sangare will not recover in time while there was some doubt about Ramon Sosa, yet to arrive back from international duty when Nuno spoke to the media. Whoever takes the field for Forest, confidence and belief will surely be high even after their defeat to Newcastle before the international break. ""What I expect and what the players give to us is total commitment to do things right,"" said Nuno. ""From the outside it can be surprising but for us? No. We work every day with them, we know the quality and talent they have, we demand a lot from them but we have to stay humble and realise it's a very long and tough season."" Possible Forest XI: Sels; Aina, Milenkovic, Murillo, Moreno; Yates, Dominguez; Elanga, Gibbs-White, Hudson-Odoi; Wood This could be a slog for Arsenal against a very good defensive opponent but Martin Odegaard's presence might just offer enough for them to carry the day.

The common thread is that quarterback Dak Prescott suffered season-ending injuries in both seasons, fracturing his ankle in 2020 and tearing his hamstring in 2024.  Dallas has opted to roll with Cooper Rush, the eight-year veteran backup, in Prescott's absence this year. Despite losing by a combined score of 68-16 in his two starts in Week 10 vs. the Philadelphia and in Week 11 vs. the Houston Texans, they are sticking with him as the starter in Week 12 at the Washington Commanders, a reunion game with former defensive coordinator Dan Quinn who is now Washington's coach. The Cowboys will also have packages for backup quarterback Trey Lance, the San Francisco 49ers' third overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft whom they acquired for the price of a fourth-round pick at the end of the 2023 preseason. They also brought in veteran Will Grier to be their third, emergency quarterback, but Dallas, along with the NFL's 31 other teams, has a shot to add a six-year NFL veteran with plenty of starting experience in quarterback Daniel Jones.  The New York Giants released Jones on Friday after benching him for Tommy DeVito, so CBS Sports asked Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy about the chance to add Jones just before Dallas plays New York on Thanksgiving Day in Week 13. Dallas doing so would provide the NFL world with peak Turkey Day drama, but McCarthy indicated such a move likely won't be happening.  ""I've never really been in the business of looking at players based off the team they are released from, especially with the timing of the next game,"" McCarthy said on a conference call on Friday. ""He was a prospect I really liked coming out, but we kind of have our head down right now and really focused on working with the guys we have here.""     Cowboys EVP Stephen Jones later echoed McCarthy's sentiments when asked about the possibility of Jones coming to Dallas.  ""No, I think we're in good shape at our quarterback spot,"" Jones said. ""We think Cooper (Rush) gives us the best chance to win right now. And certainly we still want to see some. We'll kind of see how the season goes here. We still really want to see (Trey) Lance and like what he brings to the table. And then, of course, long term, we all know we made our commitment to Dak (Prescott) for the long term."" The Giants made Jones the sixth overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft out of Duke, and his highwater mark came in 2022, the first season under current coach Brian Daboll. Jones produced career highs in passing yards (3,205), passing yards per attempt (6.8) and passer rating (92.5). He also threw a career-low five interceptions that season en route to the Giants going 9-6-1 and reaching the postseason. Daboll won NFL Coach of the Year that season, and Jones helped lead New York to an NFC wild-card round road victory at the Minnesota Vikings. He threw for 301 yards and two touchdowns on 24 of 35 passing, and he added another 78 yards on the ground on 17 carries. Jones is the only player in NFL history to throw for over 300 yards passing and multiple touchdowns while rushing for at least 70 yards in a single postseason game.    Throughout his career, he has been plagued by turnovers and inefficiency. His 73 turnovers since entering the NFL in 2019 are tied for the fifth-most in the league in that span despite missing the final 11 games of the 2023 season with a torn ACL.  Among 28 NFL quarterbacks with at least 1,500 passes thrown since Jones entered the NFL in 2019, his 84.3 career passer rating ranks as second-worst ahead of only Sam Darnold's 82.3 passer rating. The Giants started 2-8 this season with Jones ranking last in the NFL among quarterbacks with at least 10 starts in both touchdown passes (eight) and passer rating (79.4).",2024-11-22,1,0.45,0.55

Allen joined the 49ers in 2023 after three seasons backing up Joe Burrow with the Cincinnati Bengals. Shanahan only revealed Purdy's injury on Monday, a day after the 49ers lost to Seattle, indicating the third-year quarterback was battling soreness. The 2023 NFC champion notably suffered a serious elbow injury in the final game of his rookie campaign, but made 16 starts last year, serving as a beacon of durability. After being a limited participant in practice Wednesday, Purdy left Thursday's practice early and was not available to the media afterward, though Shanahan suggested later that the signal-caller could still be ready for Sunday's game. ""He was still limited today,"" Shanahan said Thursday on KNBR 680. ""He didn't do as much yesterday but did a little bit more today. He went out there and did a little bit, then went back in about halfway through and rested up. Hopefully [his shoulder] will be feeling great on Sunday.""    The coach's comments came after Purdy was not seen in the 49ers' post-practice locker room, despite Thursdays marking his typical weekly media appearances. San Francisco's other quarterbacks -- Allen and Joshua Dobbs -- were also unavailable for questions. While Shanahan was optimistic about Purdy on Thursday, Purdy was not on the field during the portion of Friday's practice open to the media. It wasn't long after that he was ruled out for Sunday's crucial game in Green Bay.",2024-11-22,0,0.51,0.49

Both sides suffered losses before the November international break with Pep Guardiola's men beaten 2-1 by Brighton and Hove Albion while Ange Postecoglou's side went down by the same score against Ipswich Town. City confirmed on Thursday that Guardiola is staying on for two more years while a number of first team regulars are closing on their return to full fitness. The defending EPL champions are preparing for eight difficult games in 29 days with six Premier League and two UEFA Champions League outings in that run. Spurs are first up with City beating the Londoners just three times from their last 10 encounters but will be keen to return to Etihad Stadium after four away losses -- they are unbeaten across 52 games in all competitions at their Manchester home with 35 of those in the EPL. Tottenham are in 10th although just three points back on Chelsea in third and Spurs beat City in the EFL Cup recently which could aid them here. Postecoglou's men have 17 points from 10 Premier League meetings with the Citizens, but have scored at least two goals on each of their last three visits to Etihad Stadium. Just four wins from 18 away games in the EPL tells its own story, though, and no topflight sides has lost more on the road since March than Spurs. Here's our storylines, how you can watch the match and more: Guardiola and City suffered a fourth consecutive defeat for the first time in his managerial career and the last time that the Citizens suffered this sort of losing streak was back in 2006 when Stuart Pearce was in charge. Consecutive Premier League losses which also included a 2-1 defeat to Bournemouth means that City are five points behind Liverpool after 11 games and off the pace in their pursuit of a fifth straight title. Spurs were flying high 12 months ago, but are 10 points and eight positions worse off this time around with five wins, one draw and five losses from 11 EPL games. Extend that beyond the English topflight and Tottenham have four wins and four losses from their last eight games across all competitions. City: Injured Rodri will be present to celebrate his Ballon d'Or success while Oscar Bobb also remains out long-term. Jack Grealish, Kevin De Bruyne, John Stones, Manuel Akanji and Phil Foden have all trained so could make the cut along with Ruben Dias, Jeremy Doku, Nathan Ake and Matheus Nunes. Stones, Akanji and Dias coming back would really boost the defense with Jahmai Simpson-Pusey dropping out and Josko Gvardiol moving to left-back while Rico Lewis and Kyle Walker seek the right-back spot. Erling Haaland will lead the line after a strong international break with Norway while Mateo Kovacic, Ilkay Gundogan and Bernardo Silva are all fit to start. Possible City XI: Ederson; Walker, Stones, Akanji, Gvardiol; Kovacic, Gundogan; Bernardo, Foden, Savinho; Haaland. Spurs: Rodrigo Bentancur got a seven-match ban for comments regarding teammate Son Heung-min and Spurs have since appealed. Micky van de Ven, Richarlison and Wilson Odobert are all out while Cristian Romero has a foot problem. Ben Davies could partner Radu Dragusin in central defense while Yves Bissouma could come in for Bentancur next to Dejan Kulusevski and one of Pape Matar Sarr or James Maddison. Possible Spurs XI: Vicario; Porro, Dragusin, Davies, Udogie; Kulusevski, Bissouma, Sarr; Johnson, Solanke, Son. This one should be tight and could easily finish 2-2 but a narrow City win with Spurs' run of two or more goals at Etihad Stadium feels about right. Pick: City 2, Spurs 1.",2024-11-22,0,0.5,0.5

The Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers will still open the 2025 season with two games in Tokyo. Those will be the only international games on the schedule next year. ""We're not going to San Juan. We did not have, despite a lot of  efforts, an arrangement that made economic sense for us. We'd like to do San Juan and what's available kind of changes  year to year, and I hope it all works out in the future,"" Manfred said (via the Associated Press). ""... I'm sure we'll be back (to Mexico City) during the term of this agreement. We had a really, really aggressive international-play undertaking last  season. Obviously, we're opening in Tokyo. Tokyo is really our focus  right now for very, very good business reasons."" The ""agreement"" Manfred referred to is the current collective bargaining agreement, which expires after the 2026 season. The CBA called for an opening series in Tokyo, a May series in Mexico City, a June series in Paris, and a September series in San Juan this season. The Paris games were canceled last November because MLB was unable to find a promoter. Basically, MLB has determined it won't make enough money to play these games, so they've been canceled. Earlier this year the Dodgers and San Diego Padres played MLB's first ever regular-season games in South Korea. The Colorado Rockies and Houston Astros played two games in Mexico City in April, and the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies played two games in London in June. MLB also played games in Mexico City in 2023 and in London in 2019 and 2022. The league played 49 games in San Juan from 2001-18. For 2026, the CBA calls for games to be played in Mexico City in May, London in June, and San Juan in September. Also, 2026 is a World Baseball Classic year, so the baseball calendar will begin with a 20-team international tournament. The 2025 MLB schedule was released in July.",2024-11-22,0,0.55,0.45

""I have every intention to play versus Nebraska next Friday night and I am confident that my teammates will return from Maryland with a win,"" McNamara wrote.  McNamara also took the opportunity to push back against ""rumors"" swirling about his status at Iowa.  ""It has come to my attention that there are individuals in the media circulating rumors about my current status on the Iowa Football Team,"" he wrote.

The 2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix will take place on Saturday on The Strip and will begin at 10 p.m. local time (1 a.m. ET) to take advantage of the dazzling lights. Verstappen won the first ever Las Vegas Grand Prix, besting Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in second and teammate Sergio Perez in third by just over two seconds. However, this has been a far more challenging season for Verstappen and he's the third-favorite at +500 in the 2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix odds, trailing Charles Leclerc (+250) and Lando Norris (+300). Ferrari's Carlos Sainz (+600) and Mercedes' George Russell (+700) round out the top five in this week's F1 odds. Before analyzing the 2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix starting grid and making any Formula 1 picks, be sure to check out the latest 2024 Las Vegas GP predictions and betting advice from SportsLine's proven projection model. Developed by daily Fantasy pro and SportsLine predictive data engineer Mike McClure, this proprietary Formula 1 prediction model simulates every race 10,000 times, taking into account factors such as track history and recent results. It's had a strong history of betting success in motorsports, correctly predicting 19 NASCAR winners since the 2021 season and its projected leaderboards have forecasted winners across multiple racing formats. The model has been scorching hot when it comes to picking Formula 1 race events dating back to 2021. It nailed both of Charles Leclerc's wins in 2022, and at the 2021 Mexican Grand Prix, the model was strongly backing Verstappen as its top pick. The result: Verstappen dominated the field and ran away with a surprise victory.  The model followed that up by calling Verstappen's win at the Rolex Emilia Romagna GP in April and then nailed his wins again in Belgium, the Netherlands, Japan, the United States, Mexico and Abu Dhabi. It also called all 19 of Verstappen's wins during the 2023 season and nailed each of his first seven wins in 2024 while also nailing Norris as a +200 winner in the Netherlands and then again as a +190 winner in Singapore. It also called Alex Albon to finish in a points position for a plus-money payout in Azerbaijan, nailed a double podium for McLaren for a plus-money payout in Singapore, and called Verstappen to hit the podium for +175 in Brazil. Anyone who followed the model's lead on those plays at sportsbooks and sports betting apps has seen huge returns. Now, the model has dialed in on the 2024 Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix and just released its coveted picks and leaderboard projections. You can head to SportsLine now to see the 2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix projected leaderboard. One surprise: The model is predicting a points finish for Esteban Ocon that would pay out +120. The 28-year-old French driver is coming off his fourth career podium finish, earning a second-place finish in Brazil three weeks ago before the break with his Alpine teammate Pierre Gasly coming in third for a double podium. The performance vaulted Alpine from eighth in the constructors' standings to sixth and Ocon jumped from 19th in the drivers' standings to 14th. Ocon was a winner in Hungary in 2021 and he now has five points finishes (top 10) on the season.

The Spartans are 4-6 overall and 2-5 in conference play, while the Boilermakers are 1-9 overall and 0-7 in Big Ten games. Michigan State is coming off a 38-16 road loss to Illinois and will be looking to snap a three-game losing streak. The Spartans need to win out to become bowl eligible. Purdue, meanwhile, is looking to snap a nine-game losing streak after falling to Penn State 49-10 in its last outing. The Boilermakers are winless against FBS opponents this season. Purdue is 2-8 and Michigan State is 4-6 against the spread this season. Kickoff in East Lansing is scheduled for 8 p.m. ET. The Spartans are favored by 14 points in the latest Purdue vs. Michigan State odds via SportsLine consensus, while the over/under is 48.5 points.

With wins over Purdue and Rutgers in their season finale, they can qualify for a bowl game in head coach Jonathan Smith's first year on the job. For a program going through a rebuild with a young quarterback, the extra bowl game practices could prove to be priceless.  Sophomore Aidan Chiles is extremely talented and has the skill set to be an upper-echelon Big Ten quarterback. Chiles, who followed Smith from Oregon State, is coming off his best game in a Spartans uniform. Against a strong Illinois defense, Chiles threw for 256 yards and two touchdowns, while rushing for 40 yards on 12 carries. See which team to pick here. The Boilermakers have a chance to play the role of spoilers against Michigan State. With a win on Friday night, Purdue would eliminate the Spartans from postseason contention. A victory in East Lansing would also send Purdue into the offseason with a renewed sense of optimism.  Not a lot has gone well for Purdue this season, but a couple of bright spots have been running back Devin Mockobee and tight end Max Klare.

""Le is an exciting power-puncher with a nasty left hook and dangerous head kicks,"" Vithlani told SportsLine. ""Le lost his UFC debut to ranked bantamweight Chris Guttierez, but he'll get a much different stylistic matchup Saturday. Xiao is a grinding fighter who likes to pressure forward, clinch up and keep his opponents controlled. He has decent boxing, but he is hittable and often finds himself in close fights. Xiao's clinch-heavy style has resulted in three straight split-decision results, the most recent of which he lost. If Le can defend takedowns and land power punches when Xiao tries to tangle up with him, he will have the bigger moments and win this fight.""

This week brings us the last truly full Saturday slate of college football games; next week will feature a healthy Black Friday schedule. That also means teams are running out of time to achieve their goals, whether it's to win their conference, get to the College Football Playoff or simply earn a bowl game berth. And there are no shortage of big games on the slate this weekend.  The biggest matchup of the day is also one of the earliest as No. 2 Ohio State hosts No. 5 Indiana in a game that has major implications in both the Big Ten and playoff picture. In the afternoon, we'll see No. 21 Arizona State host No. 14 BYU in what essentially serves as a Big 12 title elimination game. We'll finish the evening with an undefeated No. 19 Army team trying to pull off the unthinkable and topple No. 6 Notre Dame. All in all, there are 19 teams who still have a chance to reach the playoff or win their league in action on Saturday. Be sure to stick with CBS Sports all day Saturday for college football coverage from the opening kickoff onward. Let's take a look at our expert picks for the best games in Week 13 with cited picks from best sports betting apps available.                                  All times Eastern  Noon | Fox, fubo (Try for free) -- I have concerns about both sides here. Ohio State is banged up on the offensive line and lost starting center Seth McLaughlin to a torn Achilles in practice this week. It's fair to wonder how well a MASH unit of an offensive line will perform against the Hoosiers. At the same time, Indiana's worst offensive performance of the season came in its last game against Michigan, which was also the best defense the Hoosiers faced all year. This Ohio State defense is better than Michigan, so it's also fair to wonder how successful the Hoosiers offense will be. Put those two together and the under feels like the best play on sports betting apps. Pick: Under 51.5 (Fanatics Sportsbook) -- Tom Fornelli  Noon | ESPN, fubo (Try for free) -- The Gators are nearly 90 yards per game better on defense at home, and last week they held LSU to 4.1 yards per play -- their best performance against an FBS team this season. Ole Miss, however, seems to have cut back on the mistakes at inopportune times and the offense is clicking again. The Rebels average 7.6 yards per play, the second-best average in the country behind Miami, which blew out the Gators at home in their season opener. Florida is better than it was in September and will show up again Saturday, but the Rebels' defense has been on a tear (22 sacks in the last three games) and wins by a score. The betting line seems a little high. Pick: Florida +10.5 (Caesars Sportsbook) -- Brandon Marcello  3:30 p.m. | CBS, Paramount+ with Showtime, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App -- Penn State is rolling right now and has won its last three non-Ohio State games by at least 15 points. However, good defenses and aggressive passing offenses have caused issues at times. Against UCLA, the Nittany Lions only won by a 27-11 score. Illinois also held Penn State to 21 points, while Ohio State kept the PSU offense out of the end zone. Minnesota will be able to keep things close, hold onto the ball and come in under the betting line. Pick: Minnesota +11.5 (DraftKings Sportsbook) -- Shehan Jeyarajah  3:30 p.m. | ESPN, fubo (Try for free) -- Arizona State is playing its best football right now, while BYU has needed some last-minute, remarkable finishes to stay alive in the CFP picture. This is one of the biggest home games in recent memory for Arizona State, and it will mark only the second time in the last 10 years that Arizona State is a betting favorite against a ranked opponent. The Sun Devols were a 3-point favorite against BYU in 2021 and lost outright 27-17. Arizona State wins this behind a big game from Skattebo. Pick: Arizona State -3 (BetMGM Sportsbook) -- Cameron Salerno  3:30 p.m. | Fox, fubo (Try for free) -- Kansas is one of the hottest teams in the country, but sportsbooks have already caught up. A 3-point line doesn't provide much value as Colorado tries to keep their Big 12 title hopes alive. While KU's secondary will provide some serious problems, Colorado simply has too much firepower and too much on the line to lose this game. Expect it to go down to the wire, though. Pick: Colorado -3 (FanDuel Sportsbook) -- Jeyarajah  7 p.m. | NBC, fubo (Try for free) -- Army has enjoyed a great year thus far, and the Black Knights are a good team. But we've already seen a similar game play out this year when Notre Dame beat Navy 51-14. While Army looks like a more complete team than Navy did at any point, the same issues should arise for the Black Knights. Simply put: Notre Dame has a significant size advantage in the trenches. The Irish also have the athletes to cover the edges and erase a lot of what Army's triple option tries to accomplish to compensate for the size disparity. So long as Notre Dame can stick to its assignments and not get wrapped up in any motion, this should be a comfortable win. Pick: Notre Dame -14.5 (DraftKings Sportsbook) -- Will Backus  7:30 p.m. | NBC, fubo (Try for free) -- While Oklahoma's offense has fallen well short of expectations on the whole and been very up-and-down through quarterback and coordinator changes during the season, the Sooners' defense has remained remarkably consistent.

CBSSports.com Headlines,What's at stake between Washington Spirit vs. Orlando Pride: Marta's last ride? Seb Hines shoots for history,https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/whats-at-stake-between-washington-spirit-vs-orlando-pride-martas-last-ride-seb-hines-shoots-for-history/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:23:35 +0000","The NWSL Championship will be a historic event, no matter which side wins","Legacies are on the line as the Washington Spirit and Orlando Pride meet in Kansas City for the NWSL final. The Pride could win their first title in club history while the Spirit look to become only the fifth team in NWSL history to win multiple titles. Two of the best teams in the league this season, the Pride and the Spirt deserve the spotlight in what could be an epic final due to what's at stake on both sides. Soccer legend Marta has yet to hoist an NWSL title in her eighth season with Orlando but she's now one victory away from being able to do that at 38. It has been an impressive season fro the Brazillian and she looks to cap it off by leading he Pride to be the first team since 2019 to do the double winning the Shield in the regular season and triumphing in the NWSL final.  Head coach Seb Hines has already made history by becoming the first black coach in NWSL history, but becoming the first Black coach to win an NWSL championship would be a legacy defining moment.  ""I've always thought that it was my responsibility to show the way,"" Hines said on what this means. ""Hopefully this will show a way for more Black coaches in this league and other leagues."" The Washington Spirit weren't stopped by losing star midfielder and Rookie of the Year Croix Bethune to a season ending injury, but this final is a chance to win a final for her while also watching another star ascend before our eyes. Trinity Rodman has already become one of the faces of the league and after a season during which she scored eight goals and assisted six more, she'll be one of the top players that Hines is looking to stop. The Spirit's fight goes all the way up to their ownership as their first NWSL title came while Michele Kang was trying to take controlling ownership of the team. After becoming involved as a minority owner, Kang turned her eye to taking control of the team following abusive behavior by head coach Richie Burke after attempts to convince other members of the club's hierarchy that things needed to change didn't work. The players had to get involved in making a statement that the team should be sold to Kang instead of someone else and she has turned that into part of becoming a women's sports mogul. It's no surprise that with Kang's involvement, that the Spirit have become one of the top teams in the league and they could take another step with this NWSL championship.  No matter what this is a landmark final as even these callouts are only scratching the surface of how good these teams are and some of the stories behind them.  All times Eastern Saturday, Nov. 23Attacking Third pre-match show, 6:30 p.m. (CBS Sports Golazo Network)Attacking Third pre-match show, 7:30 p.m. (CBS, Paramount+)NWSL Championship: Orlando Pride vs. Washington Spirit, 8 p.m. (CBS, Paramount+)Attacking Third post-match show, 10:30 p.m. (CBS Sports Golazo Network) Sunday, Nov. 24NWSL Skills Challenge, 3 p.m. or 5 p.m. (check local listings) (CBS, Paramount+) No matter what happens in the NWSL Championship, history suggests that it will be a close one.

UTSA is coming off a 48-27 win over North Texas on Friday for its second straight victory and the Roadrunners have scored more than 40 points in three straight games. They need one more win for bowl eligibility. Temple defeated Florida Atlantic, 18-15, in overtime on Saturday to snap a two-game losing skid. The victory wasn't enough to save the job of head coach Stan Drayton though, who was fired on Sunday. Defensive coordinator Everett Withers takes over as interim head coach for the Owls. Kickoff is at 7 p.m. ET from the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas. After opening at -14.5, UTSA is now a 17-point favorite in the latest Temple vs. UTSA odds via SportsLine consensus, and the over/under is 56.5 points.

Temple put together a 15-play, 87-yard drive spanning 8:45, capped off by a Terrez Worthy 1-yard touchdown run. Temple had two fourth-down conversions on the series, which led to a 12-7 advantage with 7:15 left in the fourth quarter. That touchdown was sandwiched between made field goals after Temple missed a 51-yard field goal in its first possession of the second half. Kicker Maddux Trujillo redeemed himself from that miss with makes of 50 and 47 yards before nailing the winning 39-yard field goal in overtime in an 18-15 win over Florida Atlantic. Temple fired head coach Stan Drayton the day after the victory though.

They have jumped out to a quick  43-36 lead against Illinois State.  McNeese has yet to string together two consecutive wins, but this may be their chance. For now, things are looking good for them.  Illinois State Redbirds @ McNeese Cowboys Current Records: Illinois State 3-1, McNeese 2-2  The Illinois State Redbirds will take on the McNeese Cowboys at 3:00  p.m.  ET on Friday at Virgin Islands Sport & Fitness Center. The Redbirds have been getting the ball to fall more lately as they've increased their point totals each of their last three games.  Illinois State is headed in fresh off scoring the most  points they have all season. They steamrolled past Trinity (Ill.) 107-52  on Sunday. The  game was pretty much decided by the half, when the score had already reached  44-23.  Illinois State was working as a unit and  finished the game with 26  assists. That's the most  assists they've posted  since  the start of last season.  Meanwhile,  there's no place like home for McNeese, who bounced back after a tough loss on the road  last Monday. They came out on top against North Texas by a score of  68-61  on Monday. The over/under was set at 129 points, so nice work oddsmakers; you were right on the money.  Joe Charles and  Sincere Parker were among the main playmakers for McNeese as the former  almost  dropped  a double-double on ten points and nine  rebounds and the latter  posted 18 points. Charles had some trouble finding his footing against Alabama  last Monday, so this was a nice turnaround.  Illinois State's win bumped their record up to 3-1. As for McNeese, their victory was  their 19th straight at home dating back to last season, which  pushed their record up to 2-2.  Some high-performance offense is likely on the agenda as  both  are some of the highest scoring teams in the league. Illinois State hasn't had any problem running up the score this season,  having  averaged 83.5 points per game. However, it's not like McNeese struggles in that department as   they've been averaging 79. With both teams so easily able to put up points, the only question left is who can run the score up higher.  Illinois State is hoping to beat the odds  on Friday, as the experts think they're headed for a loss.  McNeese is a big 10.5-point favorite against Illinois State, according to the latest college basketball odds. The line has drifted a bit towards the Cowboys, as the game opened with the Cowboys as a 8.5-point favorite. The over/under is 137  points.

The Pacers might want some stickum for this one  as the team gave up 23 turnovers  on Wednesday.  Last Wednesday, the Pacers ended up a good deal behind the Rockets and lost  130-113. Indiana was down  98-77 at the end of the third quarter, which was just too much to recover from.  The losing side was boosted by   Quenton Jackson, who  went 10 for 12 en route to 24 points plus two  steals.  The Pacers  struggled to get the ball back on offense and  finished the game with only three  offensive rebounds. That's the fewest  offensive rebounds they've posted since back in February.  Meanwhile, the Bucks strolled past the Bulls with  points to spare on Wednesday, taking the game  122-106. The  win made it back-to-back  victories for Milwaukee.  Giannis Antetokounmpo got back to being  his usual excellent self, as he  almost  dropped  a double-double on 41 points and nine  rebounds. He had some trouble finding his footing against the Rockets  on Monday, so this was a nice turnaround. Brook Lopez was another key player,  going 9 for 12 en route to 21 points plus five  rebounds and three  steals.  Indiana's loss was  their fourth straight on the road, which  dropped their record down to 6-9.

The Pacers are hoping to beat the odds  on Friday, as the experts think they're headed for a loss. Bettors picking them against the spread  have some confidence (to put it mildly), as the team is sitting on  a four-game streak of failing to cover when  playing on the road.  The Pacers took their  victory against the Bucks  in their previous matchup  back in May by a conclusive  120-98. The rematch might be a little tougher for the Pacers since the  team won't have the home-court advantage this time around. We'll see if the change in venue makes a difference.

Atlanta was in a tough position after the first half, with the score already sitting at  67-42.  Even though they lost, the Hawks  smashed the offensive glass and  finished the game with 21  offensive rebounds. That's the most  offensive rebounds they've posted since back in December of 2023.  Meanwhile, the Bulls ended up a good deal behind the Bucks on Wednesday and lost  122-106.  The Bulls'  loss came about despite a quality game from  Zach LaVine, who  went 9 for 15 en route to 27 points plus six  assists and five  rebounds. LaVine is trending in the right direction considering he's  improved his point production for three straight games.  Atlanta's defeat dropped their record down to 7-9.

They will host the Portland Trail Blazers  at 8:00  p.m.  ET at Toyota Center. The timing is sure in the Rockets' favor as the  squad sits on six straight wins at home while the Trail Blazers have been banged up by three consecutive losses on the road.  The Rockets will bounce into Friday's   matchup after (finally) beating the Pacers, who they had gone 1-9 against in their ten prior meetings. The Rockets took down the Pacers 130-113  on Wednesday. Houston pushed the score to  98-77 by the end of the third, a deficit Indiana cut but never quite recovered from.  The Rockets' success was the result of a balanced attack that saw several players step up, but  Alperen Sengun led the charge by  dropping  a double-double on 31 points and 12  rebounds. Sengun had some trouble finding  his footing against the Bucks on Monday, so this was a step in the right direction. The team also got some help courtesy of  Jabari Smith, who  went 8 for 13 en route to 23 points plus eight  rebounds.  Meanwhile,  after a string of three wins, the Trail Blazers' good fortune finally ran out  on Wednesday. They fell  109-99 to the Thunder.  Even though they lost, the Trail Blazers  smashed the offensive glass and  finished the game with 16  offensive rebounds (they're ranked third in  offensive rebounds per game overall). That strong performance was nothing new for the team: they've now  pulled down at least ten  offensive rebounds in 24 consecutive  games  dating back to last season.  Houston is  on a roll lately: they've  won six of their last seven matches,  which provided a nice bump to their 11-5 record  this season. As for Portland, their loss dropped their record down to 6-9.  Friday's  contest is shaping up to be a scrappy  matchup:  The Rockets haven't given up the ball easily this season,  having  only  averaged 12.1  turnovers per game (they're ranked fifth in  turnovers per game overall). It's a different story for the Trail Blazers, though, as  they've been averaging 16.7. Given the Rockets' sizable advantage in that area, the Trail Blazers will need to find a way to close that gap.  The Rockets beat the Trail Blazers 116-107  in their previous matchup  back in April. Do  the Rockets have another victory up their sleeve, or will the Trail Blazers turn the tables on them?

CBSSports.com Headlines,Kylian Mbappe early struggles with Real Madrid: Why it's not too soon to start worrying about the French star,https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/kylian-mbappe-early-struggles-with-real-madrid-why-its-not-too-soon-to-start-worrying-about-the-french-star/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 20:47:20 +0000",The French superstar is struggling to hit the heights in Spain and with Les Bleus,"It is safe to say that Kylian Mbappe's start to life with Real Madrid has not been what was imagined this summer by the Spanish giants but also the France international. After 11 appearances across all competitions with Los Blancos following his arrival as a free agent from Paris Saint-Germain, the 25-year-old has eight goals and two assists to his name. Although it is arguably not awful just yet, it is also not nearly as great as what had been expected of Mbappe upon his arrival at Santiago Bernabeu after the European champions' long pursuit. The former AS Monaco man was expected to dovetail perfectly with the likes of Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham, but it has been anything but simple for Real's head coach Carlo Ancelotti so far. If we dig deeper into the numbers which admittedly can only provide a fairly small sample size at this time, Mbappe's situation becomes even more alarming with three of those eight goals penalties. The French superstar is currently on a goalless run of four appearances, having already experienced a three-game streak before his double in a 2-0 win over Real Betis.  Mbappe's situation currently resembles that of Karim Benzema which was also a slow burner early on and the ex-France international's advice to his successor was to the point: ""The problem, in my opinion, is that [Mbappe] is not a central striker, even with the national team, every time he plays as a number nine he doesn't feel right, because that is not his position,"" Benzema told El Chiringuito.  ""On the left, he has got a guy who is at the same level as him, Vinicius, so there is a problem, you cannot play Vinicius as a number nine or on the right, because when he plays on the left he makes the difference in every game,"" the Ittihad Club man added. ""Mbappe is not a real number nine. People ask a lot of him and he is under a lot of pressure, this is not PSG."" ""Do not give up, because I do not think he is going to push Vinicius to move,"" Benzema offered Mbappe as advice. ""He is the best player in the world at the moment. Mbappe needs to get it into his head that today he is a number nine, and forget about the left flank for a while."" Adaptation periods are required, of course, but it is not simply the numbers that are cause for concern in the Spanish capital. Mbappe's on-field issues have had a detrimental impact on Real and his new teammates as well as his new boss. The Bondy native's inability to truly loom convincing when asked to play as a No. 9 has not only impacted Ancelotti's previously successful setup, but also disturbed Bellingham and Vini Jr. Multiple absences further back on the field have also played a part such as Dani Carvajal, Thibaut Courtois and lately Aurelien Tchouameni.  While Mbappe struggles, the Brazilian on the left flank remains Real's key man, and his performances have retained an impressive level of consistency in the face of strong positional rivalry. With 12 goals and five assists, the South American is carrying Los Merengues when his French teammate is unable to step up to the plate which has deepened pre-existing questions. Mbappe has been largely unconvincing since the FIFA 2022 World Cup in Qatar and what was arguably one of the best individual showings for a losing side in final in the tournament's history. Returning to life with PSG was difficult and his solitary season under Luis Enrique was impacted by the situation regarding his future which became increasingly clear was away from Parc des Princes.

Indiana has won its first 10 games of the season, but it has not faced a ranked opponent. The Hoosiers are 10.5-point underdogs in the Week 13 college football odds, as they have not beaten Ohio State since 1988. The over/under for total points scored in Saturday's showdown is 52.5. Should you fade Indiana with your Week 13 college football bets, or is there value now that the line has dropped three point from the opener? There are a pair of other ranked vs. ranked matchups on Saturday, including No. 21 Arizona State (-3) vs. No. 14 BYU and No. 6 Notre Dame (-14) vs. No. 19 Army. The Black Knights join Indiana and No. 1 Oregon as the only unbeaten teams remaining in college football.

Built using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each game. The AI predictions are determined by statistically learning from each team's historical data and then quantitatively evaluating the strength of the opponent's defense by assigning a numeric value out of 100 called a matchup score.  Once a prediction is formulated, the AI rating is generated using the prediction, the matchup score, and the odds of the market. For example, you could see an A-rating on an over bet if a team is facing a poor defense, their prediction differs from the line and there are favorable odds. In addition, SportsLine AI is the first fully automated predictive model at SportsLine. It continuously refreshes on the most recent available data and can help you spot the biggest discrepancies in the lines.

CBSSports.com Headlines,Fantasy Basketball Waiver Wire Week 6: If you're in need of scoring Jordan Clarkson is an excellent pickup,https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/news/fantasy-basketball-waiver-wire-week-6-if-youre-in-need-of-scoring-jordan-clarkson-is-an-excellent-pickup/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 20:34:50 +0000",Players you need to pick up for Week 6,"Welcome back! Once again, we've got a lot of names to choose from, including several players with the potential to stick on your rosters throughout the remainder of the season. As always, the players in this article must be rostered in less than two-thirds of CBS leagues. Players are listed in the order that I recommend adding them, assuming they are equally good fits for your team. Brandon Boston Jr., Pelicans (66% rostered), Jordan Clarkson, Jazz (67% rostered) By the time you're reading this, both of these guys might already be above our two-thirds Mendoza line, but just in case: Clarkson is scoring a ton and getting backup-point-guard-level assists; Boston is the only healthy Pelican (barely an exaggeration), leading to tons of minutes and contributions in every category except blocks. De'Andre Hunter, Hawks (60% rostered) It's been a frustrating ride, but the productivity is undeniable. The chronically injured Hunter has once again missed a ton of games, appearing in only five so far and having his minutes limited in three of those. Yet, despite those limitations, he's still managing 18-5-1 with 1.2 steals and 2.2 3s. He entered the season as a starter, so it's possible those averages could improve if the team gains confidence in his health and conditioning. The more IR spots your league has, the more attractive Hunter is, since he's probably going to miss games again eventually. But he's been easily rosterable when healthy, which he currently is. Jaden McDaniels, Timberwolves (34% rostered) Entering the 2023-24 season, McDaniels was heavily hyped by analysts as a likely breakout. It did not go as well as we'd hoped. Maybe we weren't wrong; we were just too early? McDaniels has multiple steals in five straight games and averaged 14-6-2 with 1.6 3s while playing 35 minutes per game during that stretch. There's no clear answer for what led to this improvement, but it's part of a steady trend through his first 15 games. Breaking McDaniels' season into three five-game chunks, he's played more minutes and put up better numbers in each segment. Ausar Thompson, Pistons (40% rostered) Thompson is still getting the game-to-game treatment, with the injury designation of ""return to competition reconditioning."" That combination seems to imply he'll make his season debut soon? I think? I hope? As I've mentioned in this space before, I'm very high on Thompson. He's insanely talented, and when a player, this good becomes available for a sub-.500 team, I assume that any semi-competent coach is going to figure out a way to find lots of minutes for him. He should be a great source of rebounds and defense, though his scoring and FT% could be problematic. Peyton Watson, Nuggets (29% rostered) Aaron Gordon (calf) is out for at least two more weeks, and Watson continues to chug along in his absence. I've hammered this point for weeks, nothing new to add – as long as Gordon is out, Watson is a starter in all leagues. He's averaging 14-4-1 with one steal, 1.3 blocks, and 1.7 3s since Gordon went down. Goga Bitadze, Magic (42% rostered) Wendell Carter (foot) just missed his tenth game with plantar fasciitis, an injury that is known to linger – especially in really tall, injury-prone NBA players. Plantar fasciitis is different from many injuries in that it doesn't have a set standard recovery timetable. The Magic are calling him game-to-game, and this isn't one of those obnoxious Hornets faux updates where they know he's really out for the next six years, and they're just refusing to tell us. Carter truly could return at any moment. But he also could be sidelined for a long time. And Bitadze excels when he's given court time. He's averaged 10-9-2 with 1.6 blocks while shooting 71% from the field during his 10 starts. Add him and start him for as long as Carter remains out. Donovan Clingan, Trail Blazers (63% rostered) Sorry in advance for engaging in the kind of analysis I tend to find annoying, but I'm pretty convinced by the ""Deandre Ayton just doesn't really like playing basketball that much"" arguments. Ayton is about to miss his fifth game with a finger injury. Clingan has averaged nearly a double-double with 3.5 blocks per game as a starter in Ayton's absence. Clingan will be tough to hold onto if Ayton returns to the court for an extended period of time between now and his eventual mid-winter banishment (either due to trade or tanking) – but that banishment is coming, and Clingan is absolutely worth rostering when Ayton isn't around. If I believed in Ayton's ""want to,"" then I'd view Clingan as more of a streamer. Finger injuries shouldn't last that long, and the trade deadline is still a long time away. But, since Ayton is one of the very few players whose motivation I doubt, I wonder if this absence might draw out longer than it would for someone a little more Westbrookian. Anthony Black, Magic (22% rostered) This blurb would have been a lot more enthusiastic had it been written before Thursday night's game. On Monday and Wednesday, Black exploded for 19-2-9 while playing 31 minutes. He also recorded four stocks and five 3s across those two games. By comparison, Thursday was muted, just 4-4-5 with one steal and no 3s in 22 minutes. This week demonstrates why I'm excited about Black – he's a good player with excellent flashes, an eye for assists, and a team willing to consider expanding his role. But it also shows why he's still not auto-start – his production is inconsistent, and his workload is unreliable. Any team with a deep bench and the ability to be patient should add Black. Otherwise, he's a borderline addition based on positional and categorical needs. Dalano Banton, Trail Blazers (14% rostered) Dalano Banton is good now, maybe? It's hard to know for sure since watching the Trail Blazers is illegal in most states (definitely including Connecticut, which is why ESPN refuses to acknowledge they exist). He's a weird player who has had quick moments in the past but has been limited by two main problems – inconsistency and fit. However, Banton seems to have found a role off the Portland bench, and the inconsistency problem has yet to rear its head. He's been downright metronomic recently, scoring between 10-13 points in seven of his last 10 games. In his last five, he's averaging 14-3-4 with 1.2 steals and 1.4 blocks. He's playing just 23.8 minutes during that stretch, so there's not much wiggle room before he loses fantasy viability, but that's not currently an issue. Robert Williams, Trail Blazers (35% rostered) Williams is currently healthy and playing roughly 25 minutes per game. That's enough for him to have fantasy relevance. I already used ""injury-plagued"" to describe De'Andre Hunter, so I don't have language strong enough to describe the injury risk involved in rostering Williams. But he's played at least 24 minutes in each of his last three games, and he's right back to the defensive production that's always driven his fantasy appeal. As long as Williams is playing, he should be on rosters. Malik Beasley, Pistons (55% rostered) Don't expect his current hot streak to last, but ride it while it does. Beasley is averaging a shocking 21-4-2 with 4.9 3s over his last eight games and playing at least 27 minutes in each. A lot of that production came while the Pistons were dealing with key injuries, but they were fully healthy both Monday and Thursday, and the minutes and efficiency persisted. He's still allergic to defense, and he's never sustained numbers like this, which is why he's listed so low despite this incredible run. So, be careful who you drop him for, and don't hang on too long, but by all means, get in while the getting is still good. Kyle Filipowski, Jazz (24% rostered) Filipowski left Thursday night's game early with an ankle injury, and we don't yet know the extent of the injury. He's not quite good enough to qualify for this article if he's about to miss a bunch of games. But if he is only going to miss a game (or none at all), then he's an add. His production is all over the place – points one night, assists the next – but he's getting more minutes, the average numbers are solid, and the overall trend continues to improve. Grant Williams, Hornets (29% rostered) Stephon Castle, Spurs (59% rostered) Kevin Huerter, Kings (33% rostered) Onyeka Okongwu, Hawks (58% rostered) Yves Missi, Pelicans (40% rostered) Jonathan Isaac, Magic (22% rostered) Deep league special Charles Bassey, Spurs (1% rostered) Bassey is streamable in all formats as long as Victor Wembanyama (knee) remains sidelined. The Spurs keep calling that injury a ""contusion,"" which is typically minor and implies a quick return, which is why Bassey didn't get mentioned as an all-leagues add, even though he's currently viable there, too. He's averaging 23.3 minutes since Wembanyama went out, blocking tons of shots and getting close-ish to points-rebounds double-doubles. Bassey barely plays when Wembanyama is healthy, so he might be a quick drop, but this level of productivity is hard to find in a deep league, even if short-lived.",2024-11-22,0,0.65,0.35

They have jumped out to a quick  28-27 lead against Pittsburgh.  LSU entered the  matchup having won four straight and they're just one half away from another. Will they make it five, or will Pittsburgh step up and spoil it? We'll know soon.  Pittsburgh Panthers @ LSU Tigers Current Records: Pittsburgh 5-0, LSU 4-0  Pittsburgh has played every game this season on their home court, but they'll have to hit the road  on Friday. They will face off against the LSU Tigers at 2:30  p.m.  ET at Greenbrier Colonial Hall. The Panthers know how to get  points on the board -- the  team has finished with 82 points or more in their past five matches -- so hopefully the Tigers like a good challenge.  Pittsburgh is headed into the  game following a big  victory against VMI on Monday, something the oddsmakers some coming from a mile away. Pittsburgh took their  contest  with ease, bagging  a  93-48 win over VMI. The Panthers have made a habit of sweeping their opponents off the court, having now won four  matchups by 19  points or more this season.  Pittsburgh got their  victory on the backs of several key players, but it was  Jaland Lowe out in front who  dropped  a triple-double on 11 points, ten  rebounds,  and ten  assists. Lowe had some trouble finding  his footing against West Virginia on Friday, so this was a step in the right direction. The team also got some help courtesy of  Cameron Corhen, who  made all 5 shots he took racking up 12 points plus six  rebounds.  Pittsburgh was working as a unit and  finished the game with 25  assists. That's the most  assists they've posted  since  the start of last season.  Meanwhile, LSU waltzed into their match  on Tuesday with three straight wins... but they left with four. They came out on top against the Buccaneers by a score of  77-68.  Multiple players turned in solid performances to lead LSU to victory, but perhaps none more so than   Vyctorius Miller, who  went 9 for 14 en route to 19 points plus two  steals. Corey Chest was another key player,  scoring eight points in addition to six  rebounds and two  steals.  Pittsburgh's win was  their 11th straight at home dating back to last season, which  pushed their record up to 5-0. As for LSU, their victory bumped their record up to 4-0.  Rebounding is likely to be a big factor in this contest:  Pittsburgh has crashing the boards this season,  having  averaged 42.2  rebounds per game. However, it's not like LSU struggles in that department as   they've been averaging 40.8. With both teams battling to corral missed shots, we'll see if one team can grab an edge.  Pittsburgh is a solid 6.5-point favorite against LSU, according to the latest college basketball odds. The line has drifted a bit towards the Panthers, as the game opened with the Panthers as a 4.5-point favorite. The over/under is 147.5  points.

They will head out on the road to  challenge  the New Orleans Pelicans  at 7:30  p.m.  ET at Smoothie King Center. The Warriors are strutting in with some offensive muscle as they've averaged 119.6  points per game  this season.  The Warriors took a loss when they played away from home  on Monday, but their home fans gave them all the motivation they needed  on Wednesday. They were the clear victor by  a  120-97 margin over the Hawks. The  game was pretty much decided by the half, when the score had already reached  67-42.  The Warriors can attribute much of their success to   Andrew Wiggins, who  went 12 for 17 en route to 27 points plus seven  rebounds and two  blocks, and   Stephen Curry, who  went 7 for 10 en route to 23 points plus eight  assists and two  steals. What's more,  Curry also posted a 70%  field goal percentage, which is the highest he's  posted since back in April.  The Warriors were working as a unit and  finished the game with 36  assists (they're ranked first in  assists per game overall). That strong performance was nothing new for the team: they've now  racked up at least 27  assists in six consecutive  matches.  Meanwhile, the Pelicans' recent rough patch got a bit rougher  on Wednesday after their third straight  loss. They suffered a  painful 128-100 defeat at the hands of the Cavaliers. New Orleans was surely aware of their  disadvantage in the point spread, but the foreknowledge did nothing to prevent the result.  The Pelicans'  loss came about despite a quality game from  Antonio Reeves, who  went 14 for 25 en route to 34 points. Reeves is trending in the right direction considering he's  improved his point production for three straight games. Brandon Boston Jr., on the other hand, was considerably less helpful: he went 0-5  from beyond the arc.  Golden State pushed their record up to 11-3 with the  win, which was their fifth straight  at home. As for New Orleans, their defeat dropped their record down to 4-12. This contest  is shaping up to be a blowout:  The Warriors haven't had any problem running up the score this season,  having  averaged 119.6 points per game (they're ranked third in  scoring overall). It's a different story for the Pelicans, though, as  they've been averaging  only 103.5. The only thing between the Warriors and another offensive beatdown is the Pelicans. Will they be able to keep them contained?  The Warriors strolled past the Pelicans in their previous matchup  back in October by a score of  104-89. The rematch might be a little tougher for the Warriors since the  squad won't have the home-court advantage this time around. We'll see if the change in venue makes a difference.  Golden State is a big 10.5-point favorite against New Orleans, according to the latest NBA odds. The line has drifted a bit towards the Warriors, as the game opened with the Warriors as a 8-point favorite. The over/under is 223.5  points.

Here's The Economist: This newspaper believes in the liberal principle that people should have the right to choose the manner of their own death. So do two-thirds of Britons, who for decades have been in favour of assisted dying for those enduring unbearable suffering. And so do the citizens of many other democracies — 18 jurisdictions have passed laws in the past decade.Despite this, Westminster MPs look as if they could vote down a bill on November 29th that would introduce assisted dying into England and Wales.

Will England model their program off of the very dignified Canadian ""MAID"" program which offers this ""liberty"" to Canadian citizens? Because ...    Back to The Economist: Critics also raise concerns about the risk of coercion. But that is not credible in this case. In Ms Leadbeater's bill a person with around six months to live must make sustained requests approved by two doctors and a judge. The idea that an evil relative might go to great lengths to kill someone who will shortly be dead makes no sense ...Even if opponents of the bill are reassured by these arguments, some cannot shake the fear that Ms Leadbeater's law would be a slippery slope. If they mean that the criteria would sneakily be broadened to include the mentally ill or disabled without further legislation, then the facts are against them. In no case has an assisted-dying law restricted to the terminally ill expanded in this way. In Canada the scope widened, but that was because the courts enforced broad eligibility criteria derived from the country's existing Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Once you've decided that euthanizing people is acceptable, you've degraded the gift of life such that there's no limiting principle. The Economist is ignoring Canada, THE primary first-world example of socialized medicine mixing with assisted suicide and promoting people's ""liberty"" to end their lives. Sure, Britain may have to pass another law after this one, but once the cat's out of the bag, how do you put it back in?

Darrell Issa (R-CA) to Sec. of State Antony Blinken: Dear Secretary Blinken:As a Senior Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I write to you regarding reports of official post-election State Department therapy and listening sessions.' I am concerned that the Department is catering to federal employees who are personally devastated by the normal functioning of American democracy through the provision of government-funded mental health counseling because Kamala Harris was not elected President of the United States. As a Senior Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I write to you regarding reports of official post-election State Department therapy and listening sessions.' I am concerned that the Department is catering to federal employees who are personally devastated by the normal functioning of American democracy through the provision of government-funded mental health counseling because Kamala Harris was not elected President of the United States. Instead, on November 5, the American people resoundingly elected Donald J. Trump as the 47th President of the United States - a decisive repudiation of four years of failed Biden-Harris foreign policy. It is disturbing that ostensibly nonpartisan government officials would suffer a personal meltdown over the results of a free and fair election, something the United States champions around the world. It is unacceptable that the Department accommodates this behavior and subsidizes it with taxpayer dollars. I'm not sure what sound best describes serving someone their comeuppance, but there is a symphony of it happening in this letter. Furthermore, the mere fact that the Department is hosting these sessions raises significant questions about the willingness of its personnel to implement the lawful policy priorities that the American people elected President Trump to pursue and implement. The Trump Administration has a mandate for wholesale change in the foreign policy arena, and if foreign service officers cannot follow through on the American people's preferences, they should resign and seek a political appointment in the next Democrat administration.  Think about it: If you were the incoming boss of a company but the employees hated you so much that the old boss had to pay for therapy sessions to help them deal with the transition, what would you do with said employees? What about when you are talking about employees who must deal with foreign leaders and national security on the world stage, where optics, loyalty, and decorum are paramount?   The mental health of our foreign service personnel is important, but The Department has no obligation to indulge and promote the leftist political predilections of its employees and soothe their frayed nerves because of the good-faith votes of - and at the personal expense of - the American taxpayers. (The jury is out on whether that actually happens!)

Denise Kendrick was the latest to discover the wrath of the Tolerant Left™ when she decided to express her Christian beliefs in a way she thought was consistent with company policy. You see, the Fargo, North Dakota, Target employee saw her coworkers wearing rainbow flags and other religious symbols on their uniforms and decided that she'd show off her own faith. With this:  Denise wrote ""Trust in Jesus"" on her name tag and -- you guessed it -- was fired for her trouble. Kendrick told KVLY-TV that a manager approached her and informed her that she 'can't wear that name tag.'...Kendrick noted in a video on her YouTube channel, 'For several months, I had been wearing my red T-shirts that I ordered myself, my Christian red T-shirts, OK. I didn't wear the he/she/they/whatever T-shirts that Target supplied. I wore my own and never had any problem the whole entire time that I worked there.' ...Kendrick noted in a video on her YouTube channel, 'For several months, I had been wearing my red T-shirts that I ordered myself, my Christian red T-shirts, OK.

But the name tag apparently crossed a line with her manager. And when she said she wouldn't be held to a different standard than her Pride-promoting coworkers, she was fired. Denise believes a member of the rainbow mafia complained to management, leading to her termination. However, the story doesn't end there. Kendrick was vindicated earlier this week. On Tuesday, a spokesman said in a statement obtained by KVLY, 'Upon learning of the situation, we conducted a review and determined that the team member should not have been terminated. We apologized to her and offered to reinstate her immediately.''We are taking the appropriate steps to address the actions taken by the individual leader involved in this situation and are working with the store to ensure our policies are appropriately followed moving forward,' added the spokesman.

All respect to Officer Eric Ziegler, who was shot at but kept his cool enough to take immediate cover and loan his new friend a couple 9mms:  Lucky for Knykholas, the shots were not fatal:  Far from it, as a matter of fact: Officer Ziegler returned fire, shooting the suspect in the leg and buttocks.

	Jones, the No. 6 overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, was benched by the Giants earlier this week.","The New York Giants made the decision to bench starting quarterback Daniel Jones earlier this week amid a brutal year where the offense has struggled to find any sort of consistent rhythm. Now, in a shocking turn of events, the team announced on Friday afternoon that the sixth overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft asked for and was granted his immediate release. In a statement, which you can read in its entirely below, Giants president John Mara praised Jones for his handling of his benching, and made clear that parting ways was a mutual decision. Daniel came to see me this morning and asked if we would release him. We mutually agreed that would be the best for him and for the team.  Daniel has been a great representative of our organization, first class in every way. His handling of this situation yesterday exemplifies just that. We are all disappointed in how things have worked out.  We hold Daniel in high regard and have a great appreciation for him. We wish him nothing but the best in the future. Jones has had a tumultuous tenure in New York, as the decision to draft him that high was largely based on his perceived upside. While he’s certainly flashed the ability to be an accurate passer and a threat with his legs — so much so that the team gave him a $160 million extension in 2023 that was cited as a reason why they could not bring back Saquon Barkley in free agency this offseason — he’s never been able to become the face of the franchise the team envisioned. The Giants sit at 2-8 on the season, and are playing host to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday afternoon. The team has already announced that Tommy DeVito will start under center. To add some intrigue to this, the Giants face the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving this year. Dallas has had its own QB struggles this season as Dak Prescott is out for the year with the injury, and if they wanted, it would make sense to bring in Jones and try to get him up to speed ahead of Thursday.",2024-11-22,0,0.76,0.24

	Miller made one of the best defensive plays you will ever see to stop an alley-oop by the Pistons.","The Charlotte Hornets and the Detroit Pistons squared off on Thursday night in a battle of two up-and-coming teams that hope to take a step forward in the Eastern Conference this season. While neither of them are expected to compete for a championship or anything, both are built around promising young players and hope that better days are on the horizon. One of the brightest young stars in Thursday’s game was Brandon Miller, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft who flashed as a rookie and has built on that in a big way during his second year in the league. Unfortunately for the Pistons, that meant finding out that Miller is a freak of nature, as evidenced by him making one of the best defensive plays you will ever see when he single-handedly blew up an attempted alley-oop by picking a Wendell Moore lob out of mid-air.  A post shared by NBA (@nba)  If Miller became horizontal during this, it’d look an awful lot like Odell Beckham Jr.’s famous one-handed catch from when he played for the Giants. Anyway, the Hornets won in overtime, 123-121, with Miller leading the way, as the former Alabama standout went for 38 points, seven rebounds, four assists, four steals, and a block in 42 minutes of work.",2024-11-22,1,0.4,0.6

	Gobert got a 3-second call as he pouted over not getting the ball late in a tie game, and Anthony Edwards was not happy.","The Minnesota Timberwolves were one of the best teams and stories of the 2023-24 season, as Anthony Edwards made the leap into superstardom, Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert figured out how to play off of each other around him, and they made a run to the Western Conference Finals.  The vibes in Minnesota were, as they say, immaculate, but then a week before training camp they traded Towns to New York for Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo in a trade that has seen both the Knicks and Wolves struggling to build chemistry early in the season. Both teams are still hovering around .500, but the Knicks can get away with that in the East and still have a good look at a top-4 seed. In the West things are very different, as the Wolves came into Thursday’s game in Toronto with a tenuous hold on sixth at 8-6, needing a win to avoid dropping to a tie for 10th early this season.  In theory, the 3-12 Raptors should’ve been a good spot to get a win for the Wolves, but Minnesota found themselves in a dogfight with Toronto (on their incredible alternate court) late in the fourth quarter. With the game tied at 95-95 and five minutes to play, the Wolves chemistry issues became apparent when Randle waved off Gobert who had deep post position under the hoop, and the 4-time DPOY responded by walking to the other side of the lane to get a 3-second violation.   A post shared by LeagueAlerts Inc. (@leaguealerts)  While Gobert’s frustration is understandable, as he had two feet in the restricted area with a seal on a smaller defender and didn’t get the ball, you also can’t purposefully get a turnover in a tie game in the fourth quarter. That was what Anthony Edwards was thinking, as he got on Gobert as they came down the floor, letting him know that’s not an acceptable reaction to not getting the ball. That turnover proved to be important as the Wolves saw the Raptors pull away late for a 110-105 win, dropping Minnesota to 8-7 and a tie for 10th in the West with Dallas and Sacramento.",2024-11-22,1,0.37,0.63

The Associated Press obtained a copy of the memo. The league noted that the FBI believes  a number of the burglaries were connected to ""transnational South American Theft Groups"" that are ""reportedly well-organized, sophisticated rings that incorporate advanced techniques and technologies, including pre-surveillance, drones, and signal jamming devices.""

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Federal judge pushes back on parents calling trans athlete 'a boy' in legal battle over pro-girls protests,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/federal-judge-pushes-back-parents-calling-trans-athlete-a-boy-legal-battle-over-pro-girls-protests,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 17:05:06 -0500",New Hampshire Judge Steven McAuliffe presided over a case involving parents who wore armbands to protest a transgender athlete at a high school girls&apos; soccer game,"Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., details her resolution requiring staffers to use bathrooms corresponding with their biological sex on 'The Ingraham Angle.' New Hampshire Judge Steven McAuliffe presided over a case involving parents in the state who wore pro-girl armbands at a high school girls soccer game that included a transgender athlete. During the case, McAuliffe pushed back on the parents for repeatedly referring to the athlete as a boy.  ""You seem to go out of your way to suggest there’s no such thing as a trans girl,"" McAuliffe said during the hearing.  McAuliffe's federal judicial service dates back to 1992, when he was appointed by former President George H.W. Bush. On Thursday, McAuliffe heard arguments in a case in which plaintiffs Kyle Fellers and Anthony Foote sued the Bow School District after being banned from school grounds for wearing the wristbands at their daughters' soccer game in September.  THE PRONOUN POLICE HAVE ARRIVED AND ARE COMING FOR YOU NEXT  The wristbands said ""XX"" in reference to the natural female chromosomes. The ""XX"" logo has become an unspoken symbol of the ongoing legal and political battle against transgender inclusion in girls and women's sports across the country. Many consider it a women's rights phenomenon.  The no-trespass orders have since expired, but McAuliffe is deciding whether the plaintiffs should be allowed to wear the wristbands and carry signs at upcoming school events, including basketball games, swim meets and a music concert, while the case proceeds. A protester outside the Kansas Statehouse holds a sign after a rally for transgender rights on the Transgender Day of Visibility, March 31, 2023, in Topeka, Kan. (AP Photo/John Hanna) They wore the wristbands because another federal judge in New Hampshire, Landya McCafferty, who was appointed to her seat by President Obama in 2013, ruled two transgender athletes would be allowed to play on high school girls soccer teams, overruling a state law in place to prevent that from happening.  Fifteen-year-old Parker Tirrell, a transgender athlete, was allowed to compete for Plymouth Regional High School. In a lawsuit filed by Fellers and Foote, they alleged they were told by school officials to remove the armbands or they would have to leave the game.  TRANS VOLLEYBALL PLAYER LEGAL HEARING OPENED WITH LONG AND HEATED DEBATE OVER WHAT PRONOUNS TO USE Both of the fathers say the intention of the armband was not to protest Tirrell, but to support their own daughters in a game that featured a biological male.  McAuliffe questioned the notion that the wristbands were in support of their own daughters. ""Sometimes the message you think you’re sending might not be the message that is being sent,"" he said. McAuliffe asked Foote whether it occurred to him that a transgender person might interpret the pink XX wristbands as an attempt to invalidate their existence. ""If he’s a trans female, pink might be a color he likes,"" Foote responded. First lady Jill Biden, right, and Steven J. McAuliffe, widower of Christa McAuliffe, arrive at the Christa McAuliffe School in Concord, N.H., March 17, 2021. (Jessica Rinaldi/The Boston Globe via Getty Images) Transgender inclusion in girls' and women's sports emerged as a mainstream political issue in the last few years. Instances of athletes discovered to be male and then legally protected to continue playing have emerged in rapid succession since the start of the Biden administration.  This includes instances like those involving Tirrell in New Hampshire and others in Virginia and California. At the college level, a situation at San Jose State University involving a transgender volleyball player has prompted multiple lawsuits and a media firestorm. It became a talking point of Donald Trump's presidential campaign before his recent election win.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump and even his wife, Melania, who has admitted to disagreeing with Republicans on issues of LGBT rights, each announced they are opposed to letting biological males compete in girls and women's sports. Trump advocated for a blanket ban during a Fox News town hall event on the campaign trail.  Multiple states filed lawsuits and enacted their own laws to address the issue after the Biden-Harris administration issued a sweeping rule that clarified that Title IX’s ban on ""sex"" discrimination in schools covers discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and ""pregnancy or related conditions,"" in April.  The administration insisted the regulation does not address athletic eligibility. However, multiple experts presented evidence to Fox News Digital in June that it would ultimately put more biological men in women's sports.  The Supreme Court then voted 5-4 in August to reject an emergency request by the Biden administration to enforce portions of that new rule after more than two dozen Republican attorneys general sued to block the Title IX changes in their own states. During the most recent election cycle, multiple Democrats, including Texas Rep. Collin Allred backtracked on past support for transgender inclusion in women's sports.  That trend continued after the election when Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton spoke out against his party's stance and actions in enabling transgender inclusion in multiple interviews, inciting fierce backlash and even a massive pro-transgender rally outside his office.  Now, multiple judges like McAuliffe across the country are presiding over cases about the eligibility of transgender athletes in sports.  Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

Durability, even while throwing his body around with his physical style, is a big reason he is on track to pass Gretzky’s mark of 894 goals that once looked unapproachable.

Watch as Nick explains why 'America's Team' should beg Mike Vrable to take over and ‘create a real football program.’ Here come the tears.  Dallas Cowboys franchise quarterback Dak Prescott admitted just how bad his team's failed season has made him feel about himself.  Prescott told The Dallas Morning News this week he couldn't hold back the emotion or the tears when he sat down and realized just how bad his team really is. ""The other day, after the game, I guess, it all just hit me,"" Prescott said of the experience shortly after his team was blown out by the Houston Texans Monday night. ""Boom, right. A couple of tears came down. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM ""This is going to hurt. It's going to suck at times.

Prescott says nearly all the tendons connecting his hamstring to his pelvis tore off, and there is only one left.  ""It started to lift off the bone even more,"" Prescott said.

ESPN STAR GETTING ‘VERY, VERY WORRIED’ ABOUT JERRY JONES, HAS JOE BIDEN IN MIND Prescott underwent season-ending surgery, which was announced by owner Jerry Jones Nov. 12. In Prescott's absence, backup quarterback Cooper Rush has only made things worse for the spiraling Cowboys. The team is on pace for its worst season in 35 years.  They have just three wins. And if they don't win at least two of their last seven games, it will be their worst winning percentage in a season since their one-win campaign in 1989.  The team's 3-7 start is its worst since 2020, and Prescott, statistically, was off to one of his worst starts as a passer. With eight interceptions in eight games, Prescott recorded the worst passer rating and second-worst interception percentage of his career in a single season.

His representatives announced he agreed to a four-year, $240 million contract just hours before the season opener against the Cleveland Browns Sept. 8.  Now, many around the NFL and sports media have used the Cowboys failure as a springboard for comedy.  Former Broncos Super Bowl Champion and current ESPN host Shannon Sharpe blasted the Cowboys on his latest episode of the ""Nightcap"" podcast.  ""I would’ve left the stadium with a bag over my head. Ain’t no way you’ll see me leaving the stadium when I got beat like that. After I’ve gotten beat like that every game. … And you do this?"" Sharpe said. ""It’s disrespectful. It’s disrespectful to the fans who pay their hard-earned money. But you know what, it couldn’t happen to a better franchise. Because all that owner do is run his mouth and talk about what they’re gonna do. … And all their players do, because they take it from the owner, is run their mouth — and they ain’t won dog crap. None of them."" The Denver Broncos' Shannon Sharpe (84) in action against the Kansas City Chiefs in 1996. (Damian Strohmeyer/Sports Illustrated via Getty Images) Legendary NFL quarterback Peyton Manning was one of the most prominent figures to weigh in. During a bit hosting the Country Music Awards Wednesday night, Manning joked that Prescott isn't the only Cowboy to cry this year, pointing to owner Jerry Jones.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""But enough about Jerry Jones,"" Manning said.  ESPN star Stephen A. Smith said Tuesday he had President Biden on his mind when he watched the Dallas Cowboys owner talk to reporters after the team's loss to the Houston Texans. Smith added that the Cowboys have been so bad this year, he can't celebrate it as effusively as he normally might. They're so bad it makes him ""sad,"" he said. Smith said players like Micah Parsons look like they are about to ""see a therapist"" because they're ""depressed.""  ""I’m getting very, very worried about Jerry Jones because the only thing that’s worse than the team’s play is his press conferences, or whatever you want to call it, when he is in front of the reporters, where he says one thing after another after another,"" Smith said. ""I find myself thinking about Joe Biden before he backed out of running for re-election."" Even Cowboys Hall of Famer and three-time Super Bowl champion Troy Aikman suggested head coach Mike McCarthy will be gone after this year.  Dallas Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy on the sideline against the Atlanta Falcons during the second half at Mercedes-Benz Stadium Nov. 3, 2024.

He’s proven it here. You win 12 games three years in a row, you’re doing something right. But he didn’t get a contract extension after he had done that. It’s hard to imagine him getting one now."" But even with all the bad press and losing, Prescott still says this year has been ""one of the best"" of his life off the field because he hasn't let the team's failures bring down his spirits.  ""Off the field, it's been some of the most joyous times I ever could have imagined, dreamed of. Having a child, getting engaged, starting a family. But, then, on the football field, it's probably been as tough of a season as I've ever had. I'd probably say the toughest.""

LAS VEGAS – The McLaren Formula 1 Racing Team entered the Las Vegas Grand Prix in first place in the Constructors' Championship standings, hoping to win their first title since 1998. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri have both proven to be formidable forces on the racetrack throughout the entire season and hold a narrow lead over Ferrari and Red Bull. A 1-2 finish for the McLaren drivers will help the team get ever closer to that title.

(AP Photo/John Locher, File) However, McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown made clear on Thursday he is taking it one step at a time. He spoke to the media as he touted the team’s partnership with Mastercard. ""I think we have a good chance,"" he said. ""Ferrari may be the team to beat this weekend. I think we’ve got a very strong race car with two awesome racing drivers. It’s a little bit of a home race for me – not necessarily from Las Vegas, it’s my home country. So, for me, it feels a little bit more special. ""It’s a fantastic venue, of course. It’s our first race together with (the Mastercard) brand on our race car. It’s very exciting. We have a tremendous amount of support, and we’re counting down to race weekend. For me, if we can win this race or extend our Constructors' lead, it would be a successful weekend."" Norris is also driving in hopes of staying alive for a world championship. A win for Norris would keep him alive in the title fight with Red Bull’s Max Verstappen for at least one more race.

Norris retired after two laps, and Piastri worked his way up from 18th to a 10th-place finish. Brown said he felt good about how the team came together this season and worked hard to put them in the race for a title. ""I feel good about where McLaren are at the moment. I think the men and women at McLaren have done an awesome job in every aspect of the racing team. We’ve obviously developed a very good race car,"" Brown said, touting every department from finance to human resources in making sure everyone has kept their eye on the ball through the season, putting in the work and the hours to make the team as successful as it has been. ""I feel great where we are. It’s high stress because we haven’t been here (in this position to win a Constructors' Championship) since 1998. Thirty-six points in the lead can evaporate in one race weekend. We got Ferrari who could easily finish first and second. Anything can happen in a street race as we saw in Brazil.""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. An AFC North rivalry had another page added to its long book of ugly history on Thursday night. The Cleveland Browns squeaked out a win over the Pittsburgh Steelers in blizzard conditions on their home turf, but as soon as the game ended, things turned sour for two players. Russell Wilson was aiming for the end zone on the final play of the game, and his pass fell incomplete to give the Browns a 24-19 victory.

(Nick Cammett/Getty Images) Wide receiver George Pickens was guarded well by Greg Newsome II, totally taking him out of the play. Apparently, they started to get into it. Cameras missed the beginning of what looked to be an ugly skirmish, but a quick pan appeared to show the two getting tangled up by the stands. The camera then showed Pickens being held back by two members of stadium security near the seats. One fan was even holding Pickens' arm, leading to initial speculation that Pickens was getting into it with fans. Newsome is eventually seen standing up from the ground and walking away from the ruckus. It is not the first time Pickens' temper has gotten out of hand. In his rookie season, he yelled at coaches after a teammate dropped a pass. Last season, he was called out for what appeared to be a lack of effort.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The league’s first snow game of the season appeared to be a low-scoring bout at first, but a fourth-quarter thriller ensued in the harsh conditions as the Cleveland Browns upset the Pittsburgh Steelers, 24-19, in a wild AFC North battle.  The Browns moved to 3-8 on the season, while the Steelers are now 8-3. High winds, a temperature that felt below 30 degrees and tons of snow were dumped on Huntington Bank Field throughout this contest, and both teams were attempting to get acclimated to the conditions that continued to get worse as time ticked on the clock.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Cleveland Browns running back Nick Chubb, #24, runs with the ball against Pittsburgh Steelers safety DeShon Elliott, #25, during the first half at Huntington Bank Field.

However, the Browns, with fans braving the weather in the stands to cheer them on, found life on their final drive of the game, where Nick Chubb scored his second touchdown of the game with 57 seconds left on the clock to go up five points after the two-point conversion failed.  Chubb, who found the end zone with four minutes left in the second quarter, as well, finished the game with 59 yards on 20 rush attempts.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,"Jake Paul’s business partner talks claims of rigged Mike Tyson fight, says Paul is boxing's 'greatest gift'",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/jake-pauls-business-partner-talks-claims-rigged-mike-tyson-fight-says-paul-boxings-greatest-gift,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 06:00:48 -0500",Most Valuable Promotions co-founder Nakisa Bidarian says the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight was &quot;100% real&quot; and that the 27-year-old mogul is boxing&apos;s &quot;greatest gift.&quot;,"Most Valuable Promotions co-founder Nakisa Bidarian discusses Jake Paul's legacy in boxing and the recent claims of the fight against Mike Tyson being rigged. A sports icon came out of retirement last Friday, leading to decibels that are seldom touched at a sporting event, as 58-year-old Mike Tyson, in his first professional fight since 2005, battled Jake Paul in front of more than 70,000 fans at AT&T Stadium in Arlingon, Texas. But by the middle of the fight, boo-birds rang out in the crowd, and with Paul winning by unanimous decision, accusations of a rigged fight ran all over social media. If you know Jake Paul, none of that bothers him. He thrives off the hate and has embraced the role of the heel in boxing and life. ""He’s the ‘problem child,’ people want to boo him, and that’s the special sauce that he has,"" said Nakisa Bidarian, co-founder of Most Valuable Promotions, in a recent interview with Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  (Cooper Neill/Getty Images for Netflix) Bidarian and Paul co-founded MVP together three years ago, and their promotions have helped put women’s boxing on the map with two spectacles by Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano, the second of which was the co-main event last week in Arlington. Although Bidarian admitted that the 60 million households watching the fight and the largest gate outside of Las Vegas ever was probably more because of Tyson, he said Paul ""played a massive role"" in the historic event. It was historic by just about every metric: attendance, viewers, gate, bets placed, social media discussion. But the overwhelming reaction to the fight was that it was a disappointment. ""I don’t care what people have to say. They’re always going to have something to say. It is what it is,"" Paul told Fox News Digital after the fight. Added Bidarian in his interview, ""The only win there was if Mike Tyson knocked out Jake Paul, otherwise, the haters would have found a way to complain no matter what."" But with it being a Paul spectacle, there is, once again, some speculation about the fight being rigged, fixed or staged. Jake Paul, left, is announced as the winner over Mike Tyson at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on Nov. 15, 2024. (Al Bello/Getty Images for Netflix ©2024) Some fans have tried to point out instances in which the former heavyweight champ could have easily knocked out Paul with an uppercut; some have said that Tyson was biting on his gloves to keep himself from going wild in the ring. Some fans also believe that there was no way a boxer with just four years of experience could have possibly beaten the ""Baddest Man on the Planet."" But all of those claims are BS, Bidarian said. ""In terms of this fight specifically, I will say the following: It was sanctioned by the athletic commission. Our partner was Netflix, who is the biggest media company in America and is a public entity. There was professional sports betting on the event,"" Bidarian said. ""So, if you were to rig such competition, it is a federal crime. And myself, Jake Paul, Mike Tyson, executives from Netflix would all be going to jail, they would be risking their entire company, and we would be risking our entire lives to do that. It is preposterous that people even suggest that this was in any way anything other than a professional fight. … That was not the case in any Jake fight, let alone this one."" ""This was 100% real from beginning to end,"" he added. ""It was so real that the guy had an ulcer, and we took a five-month break to give him time to heal the ulcer to be able to perform at his best level. If it was staged, why did we even postpone it? We could have just moved forward with the date: ‘Oh, you have an ulcer, you’re not going to hit each other. It’s going to be fine.’ What are people talking about?"" Mike Tyson and Jake Paul exchange punches at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on Nov. 15, 2024. (Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images) JAKE PAUL-MIKE TYSON SNOOZER DRAWS HARSH CRITICISM: 'NOT GREAT FOR BOXING' Even some more high-profile fighters at the top of their game have called out Paul, including Ryan Garcia, lightweight champion Gervonta Davis, heavyweight champion Daniel Dubois and undisputed light heavyweight champion Artur Beterbiev. Bidarian said that ""with the exception of one,"" Paul is interested in ""all"" of the inquiries. ""What’s next for Jake is whatever Jake wants it to be. He is the biggest face in all of boxing. … His goal is to be a world champion, so you’ll see us do things that give him those opportunities. And our goal is to think outside the box, do disruptive things and capture the imagination. We did that last Friday, and we’ll continue to do that."" It’s no secret that Paul is disliked, and many think this is all just a marketing play. It’s no secret that Paul is a marketing whiz, and some of his opponents have been selected rather wisely. But as much of a businessman as Paul may be, Bidarian said he sees him ""first and foremost"" as a boxer. ""That’s what he dedicates anywhere from 70 to 75% of his time,"" Bidarian said. At the same time, Paul puts emphasis on ""professional"" in the term ""professional boxer."" ""He is the most professional boxer in professional boxing. He is a businessman, he conducts himself like a business, he shows up on time, he delivers every line you need to deliver, he does the promo when no one else wants to. …"" Bidarian said. ""He knows how to sell. [Dallas Cowboys owner] Jerry Jones said to Jake Paul, ‘Kid, you’re one of the greatest marketers in all of sports.’ And that’s true. He’s four years into this sport, and he’s co-headlining a record-setting event."" That’s why Bidarian has a rather strong message to those who don’t believe Paul is a serious boxer.

(Stephen McCarthy/Sportsfile via Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Show me another athlete, including their amateur or high school career, who has four and a half years of experience that has achieved as much as he has achieved inside and outside of the ring,"" Bidarian said. ""Even in that performance against Mike Tyson, who is 58, is very unique for someone who is four years into doing a sport. … Jake Paul has gone into the lions’ den and showed that he outboxed a much more skilled boxer in his heyday than Jake Paul, and that’s a lot more impressive than 99% of boxers do in their 10th, 12th, 15th fight."" ""More importantly, Jake Paul has put on for this sport like no athlete has before,"" he continued. ""He’s put on for the women in this sport, he’s put on for the youth in this sport, he’s put his own money into renovating gyms to give access to young boys and girls to learn about the sport of boxing. He’s partnered with USA Boxing to push amateur interest in the sport. ""He’s the greatest gift the sport has ever seen, in my opinion.""

"NY Post Sports – Latest News, Scores, Stats & Videos",USC’s JuJu Watkins has to prove it against Notre Dame’s guards in first great game of women’s college basketball season,https://nypost.com/2024/11/22/sports/womens-college-basketball-games-to-watch-juju-watkins-usc-vs-notre-dame/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:36:42 -0500","The No. 6 Notre Dame women’s basketball team (4-0) has breezed through the first 2 ½ weeks of the season, annihilating opponents by an average of 47.5 points.","The No. 6 Notre Dame women’s basketball team (4-0) has breezed through the first 2 ½ weeks of the season, annihilating opponents by an average of 47.5 points. It’s hard to know what’s more impressive about the Fighting Irish. Is it their offensive dominance? Or perhaps their stifling defense that’s kept opposing teams to 31.2% shooting?  Then again, the early returns on Notre Dame’s season are inflated, considering the Fighting Irish haven’t faced much of a challenge in four tuneup games.  But the slow ramp-up for their season is over, and the real competition is set to begin when Niele Ivey’s team travels to Los Angeles to take on No. 3 USC (4-0) on Saturday (4 p.m. ET, NBC).  “We’re really excited,“ Niele Ivey told reporters this week. “The fact that we get to be on this big stage, it’s just an incredible matchup. They have some of the biggest names out in women’s basketball right now.” Ivey is referring to USC sophomore standout JuJu Watkins and potential 2025 WNBA lottery pick Kiki Iriafen.  Watkins was a basketball big shot even before she stepped on the court last season for the Trojans.  But her remarkable first-year campaign — during which she set a single-season record for a freshman by scoring 920 points – only elevated her stature. This season, Watkins is averaging 21.5 points, 6.3 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 3.8 steals and 3.0 blocks in four games.  Iriafen, a transfer from Stanford, has posted 17.3 points to go with her team-high 7.5 rebounds per game.  But make no mistake about it: Notre Dame has a few stars of its own, too, which adds to the intrigue of this early-season showdown of two possible Final Four teams.  It helps that point guard Olivia Miles, another potential 2025 lottery pick, returned to the Fighting Irish’s lineup after missing all of last season because of a knee injury.  Miles’ elite passing abilities and improving 3-point shooting make up just one half of what could be the most dynamic backcourt in college basketball this season. Sophomore All-American guard Hannah Hidalgo, who set several program records for Notre Dame last season, also is picking up where she left off. She leads the team in scoring (25 points per game) and steals (5.3 per game).   Hidalgo’s scrappy approach on the defensive end makes her a menace to opposing guards and could help wear down Watkins over the course of Saturday’s tilt. After all, the way to beat USC is not to go into the game with the mindset of stopping Watkins – that’s not going to happen – but rather to make her work for every point. Other players who might be up for the defensive assignment include Sonia Citron and Cassandre Prospect.   Saturday will be a chance for Notre Dame to make a statement and prove it’s a legitimate national title threat this season.  Here are three more games you should know about this week: No. 1 South Carolina (5-0) at No. 5 UCLA (4-0), Sunday, 4 p.m. ET, FS1: The schedule makers delivered basketball fans quite the treat this weekend with not just one but two marquee matchups — and both of them in Los Angeles, at that. The second potential Final Four preview features South Carolina with its 43-game winning streak on the line. South Carolina’s star big from a season ago, Kamilla Cardoso, went to the WNBA. Chloe Kitts has been working to fill the 6-foot-7 void left by Cardoso’s departure, but she doesn’t have nearly the same size and skills inside as her successor. Enter UCLA 6-foot-7 center Lauren Betts, who could be a matchup nightmare for the Gamecocks. Betts is averaging 21.5 points on 72.5% shooting and is corralling 11.5 rebounds per game, which could be a big problem for South Carolina. Then again, the Gamecocks have legendary coach Dawn Staley, who’s no stranger to leading a team that has a target on its back. This game could come down to the wire.  No. 2 UConn (4-0) vs. Oregon State (1-3) in Nassau, Bahamas, Monday, 7:30 p.m. ET: Geno Auriemma added yet another impressive notch on his belt this week when he became the all-time winningest coach in college basketball. UConn’s win against Fairleigh Dickinson on Wednesday was the 1,217th of Auriemma’s career, surpassing former Stanford coach Tara Vanderveer for the record. Auriemma’s win count is sure to continue to swell, starting Monday against Oregon State at the Baha Mar Women’s Championship. This Huskies team is loaded with talent and has a deep bench – a luxury that had eluded it in past seasons because of injuries. Azzi Fudd is back in the fold after a year away because of a knee injury. And Paige Bueckers, a favorite to go No. 1 in the 2025 WNBA draft, continues to dazzle.  No. 16 North Carolina (3-1) vs. Ball State (4-0) in Nassau, Bahamas, Saturday, 6:30 p.m. ET: North Carolina enters this weekend as a favorite to win the annual Battle 4 Atlantic tournament. Sure, the Tar Heels are coming off a tough loss at UConn, but that might only fuel them this weekend. Ball State will be putting its perfect record on the line. The Cardinals managed to squeeze out a win against Northern Iowa last week, which proved to be more impressive than initially believed. Could Ball State pull off a stunner? Maya, oh my. Maya McDermott was a catalyst for Northern Iowa, who took the cake this week for the biggest upset of the young women’s basketball season.  The unranked Panthers stunned No. 8 Iowa State on Wednesday night, 87-75, as McDermott dropped a career-high 37 points.  It marked Northern Iowa’s first win against a top-10 opponent in program history and will go down as a day to remember for McDermott, who grew up in a Des Moines suburb just 30 miles south of Iowa State’s campus.",2024-11-22,0,0.5,0.5
"NY Post Sports – Latest News, Scores, Stats & Videos","Duke vs. Arizona prediction: College basketball picks, odds, best bets Friday",https://nypost.com/2024/11/22/betting/duke-vs-arizona-prediction-college-basketball-picks-odds-best-bets-friday/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:30:00 -0500","Duke's versatile freshman Cooper Flagg shines, while Arizona’s fast-paced offense and elite rebounding make them both title contenders this season.","On Friday night, the No. 12 Duke Blue Devils will make the long flight from the East Coast to the Southwest for a date with the No. 17 Arizona Wildcats. This matchup marks another opportunity for the country to get a good look at Cooper Flagg, the likely top pick in the 2025 NBA Draft. Thus far, Flagg has led the Blue Devils in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks per game. Can the Blue Devils grab their first ranked win of the season after failing to hold off Kentucky or will the Wildcats bounce back at home after a road loss to Wisconsin? (10:30 p.m. ET, ESPN) Flagg’s transition from high school to college basketball has been virtually seamless, as he has already established himself as one of the best players in the sport. At 6-foot-9, Flagg can play and defend multiple positions, giving him the versatility to fit into any role at the next level. Duke’s offensive talent doesn’t end with Flagg, though, as it has other future pros, such as junior guard Tyrese Proctor, freshman center Khaman Maluach and freshman wing Kon Knueppel.  Even with a loss, the Blue Devils still rank fourth in adjusted efficiency margin (KenPom) and second in adjusted defensive efficiency.  The Blue Devils are frightening. They lost by five points to Kentucky despite shooting a putrid 4-for-24 from 3-point land and a few critical late-game Flagg turnovers. It’s further proof that this team is a legitimate title contender come March. Meanwhile, the Wildcats continue to be among the country’s fastest and most efficient teams, ranking fourth in adjusted tempo and 14th in adjusted offensive efficiency. Their trio of returning guards, including Jaden Bradley, Caleb Love and KJ Lewis, can apply pressure in transition as well as any unit in college basketball, as evidenced by the team’s 94.3-point-per-game average. Unsurprisingly, Arizona is again one of the best rebounding teams, ranking first in offensive rebounding percentage and total rebounding rate. Still, I have the Blue Devils narrowly squeaking by Arizona on the road. Arizona looked sloppy against Wisconsin, giving up backdoor cuts, straight-line drives, open 3-point looks and a game-high 41 points to John Tonje.  The Wildcats (317th in fouls per game) also fouled Wisconsin an absurd amount, putting it on the charity stripe for 41 free-throw attempts. Imagine what Flagg, Proctor, Knueppel and Caleb Foster can do to the Wildcats. And this is where the stars could align for Duke’s shooters (11th in 3PAs), as positive regression is inevitable, especially since the Wildcats have been suspect at defending the 3-point line. Currently, Duke is the more disciplined team, holding opponents to just 25.7% shooting from behind the arc and turning the ball over fewer than 10 times per game. I’ll take Duke with the points.

Head coach Kyle Shanahan announced on Friday that backup Brandon Allen will get the starting nod for San Francisco against the Packers. The move comes as starter Brock Purdy is dealing with shoulder soreness, which limited him in practice this week.  The issue was enough to have him ruled out for Sunday, which is a key road matchup in the middle of the season for the 49ers.  The 49ers — which will also be without star edge rusher Nick Bosa (left hip and oblique) — are 5-5 entering the game against 7-3 Green Bay, sitting10th in the NFC, meaning they are on the outside looking in for the playoff picture. They now will turn to Allen, who has not started a game in three years. His biggest action in the NFL came in the 2020 season when he started five games (1-4 records), completing 63.4 percent of his passes with five touchdowns and four interceptions. Since that season, he’s thrown just 37 passes in the regular season. He’ll face off against a Packers defense that ranks 15th in the NFL in passing yards allowed per game this season (329) and will be without cornerback Jaire Alexander and linebacker Edgerrin Cooper. Allen will have Joshua Dobbs as his backup on Sunday. The 49ers next face the Bills next Sunday night, making this Packers game all the more important.",2024-11-22,1,0.44,0.56

"NY Post Sports – Latest News, Scores, Stats & Videos","Mavericks vs. Nuggets prediction, odds: NBA picks, best bets",https://nypost.com/2024/11/22/betting/mavericks-vs-nuggets-prediction-odds-nba-picks-best-bets/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:00:00 -0500",The Mavericks will try to keep their winning streak alive without Luka Doncic as they face the Nuggets.,"Just when the Dallas Mavericks look ready to turn the corner, an injury to Luka Doncic could potentially derail their progress. Doncic is dealing with a strained wrist and the Mavericks expect he’ll be out of action for one week. Dallas will put its three-game winning streak on the line when it visits the Denver Nuggets on Friday night.  Denver also appears to be on the ascent, with six victories in its last eight games.  However, it has been without the reigning MVP, Nikola Jokic, for the last three games due to a personal matter. Jokic’s availability is still up in the air, as the Nuggets list him as questionable on the injury report. While it’s always difficult to make projections on a game when teams aren’t at full strength, the props market is an excellent option for determining which teammates will likely step up in the absence of a star player. The Mavericks are notorious for their slow starts, so it wasn’t entirely surprising to see their record fall to 5-7. However, most would say the combination of Doncic and Kyrie Irving are two of the most unguardable players in the league. Thus, it would only be a matter of time before Dallas would regain its stride. While the NBA season can be long and arduous, there are always a few games throughout the campaign that take on another level of importance.  For Dallas, its away victory (121-119) over the Thunder offered a similar significance because heading into the game, OKC had the best record in the West at 11-2.  Dallas followed up that performance with a 131-91 demolition over the New Orleans Pelicans.If you overlook this Mavericks team, you do so at your peril.  The underlying metrics suggest they’re still very much a legitimate contender that can challenge and come out of the West. Denver rebounded from a 0-2 start to win seven of its next eight games.  However, it’s 1-2 in the last three games with Jokic sidelined. Jokic is having another MVP-caliber season, averaging a triple-double with 29.7 points, 13.7 rebounds and 11.7 assists. Per Basketball-Reference, Jokic also leads the league with a 33.3 Player Efficiency Rating and Win Shares per 48 minutes (.323). Thus, the Nuggets don’t have anywhere close to a ready-made replacement that can fill Jokic’s shoes.  Although some felt Denver didn’t do enough in the offseason when building its roster, the Russell Westbrook experiment seems to work better than we might have anticipated. Westbrook can still fill up the stats sheet, averaging 10.8 points, six assists and 4.5 rebounds. He recently recorded his 200th triple-double—the most in NBA history. Forward Peyton Watson and guard Julian Strawther have also developed nicely off the bench, with both players averaging 9.5 points. Like the Mavericks, the Nuggets will be just fine, but both teams would do well to have their star players back on the court. Picking a side in this contest wouldn’t be easy, considering these teams are two of my favorites to watch. Therefore, I’m happy to remain neutral by targeting a player in the props market. When they landed Klay Thompson over the summer, the Mavericks saw an opportunity to add a knockdown shooter. Although Thompson is averaging a career-low with 14 points, he’s also attempting his fewest shots per game (12.6). Doncic and Irving are ball-dominant players, so with one out of the lineup, Thompson figures to get more touches. The Nuggets are also a team Thompson can thrive against because they’re a bottom-10 defense. He’s averaging 20.3 points In his last 13 games when facing teams that this profile. Thompson’s scoring prop is available at 16.5, which feels short given the opponent. It’s worth noting that he’s coming off a 19-point effort against the Pelicans.  Lastly, he’s had three games this season in which he produced back-to-back efforts of 17 or more points.  I expect that trend to continue Friday night.  THE PICK: Klay Thompson Over 16.5 points (-113, FanDuel) Michael Arinze handicaps most major sports for the New York Post. He’s cashed two 15-leg teasers in his betting career as well as a 12-leg parlay that included eight Little League World Series games.

Smith berated the Giants in a scathing rant while defending his ESPN colleague Elle Duncan, who might’ve made herself an enemy of the Giants.  Duncan’s remarks about Daniel Jones’ farewell speech — during which he thanked the Giants before they granted his release on Friday — didn’t sit well with Giants faithful, including Pat Hanlon, the team’s senior vice president of communications, who called her out on X. During Friday’s installment of “First Take,” Smith told the Giants to stop whining and claimed the organization called ESPN to complain about Duncan’s “Taking the L” segment about Jones.  “The New York Giants, respectfully, shut the hell up,” Smith said. “Y’all are awful as an organization … Y’all are sorry! Y’all are pathetic! The only reason why you get away with it is because the Jets have been worse … and you’ve got the nerve to sit up there and call the network because you want to whine and moan about your ineptitude being put on public display?” Duncan didn’t spare Jones one bit while discussing him getting benched for Tommy DeVito and demoted to fourth string after he was unable to control the Giants’ offense.   “You guys think he had this saved in his notes since like 2020? In all seriousness, DJ, I could have saved you like 90 seconds,” Duncan said, referring to his speech.  “A rewrite: I’m sorry you paid me $108 million for one playoff win. And I look forward to reviving my career as Brock Purdy’s backup. The end.”  Hanlon wasn’t thrilled with Duncan’s remarks.  “That an ESPN personality would mock Daniel Jones’ statement today is mind boggling,” he wrote on X. “Given what has happened at that company over past few years, tone deaf.” Hanlon didn’t explain further about what happened at ESPN.  The company recently went through multiple rounds of layoffs.  Many Big Blue fans thought Duncan was overly harsh and disrespectful to Jones.  Duncan, who was a guest on Friday’s “First Take,” stood by her comments.  “You want to call me disrespectful to Daniel Jones?” she said. “Am I more disrespectful than the Giants making him a scout team safety? Am I more disrespectful than all of those same fans that are in my mentions right now who booed him mercilessly for the last six seasons? I stand by everything that I said.”",2024-11-22,0,0.54,0.46

That’s because the Blueshirts have been carrying Chad Ruhwedel as the team’s seventh defenseman since he changed places on Nov. 13 with Mancini, the 22-year-old freshman righty who had been a healthy scratch for the four games prior to that. So either a top-six defenseman is being pulled for performance or health reasons and head coach Peter Laviolette does not feel comfortable inserting the 34-year-old veteran into the lineup, or the club might be down another regular defenseman, necessitating that both Mancini and Ruhwedel would dress. The Blueshirts maintained their 23-man roster by dispatching Jake Leschyshyn to the Wolf Pack in exchange for Mancini, who had played three AHL: games (1-0-1) after skating in nine Rangers matches (1-3-4) out of the gate. It is unknown whether Filip Chytil, who has missed the first three games of the trip after sustaining an upper-body injury at the Garden on Nov. 14, will dress after rejoining the club in Calgary.",2024-11-22,1,0.44,0.56

Jones was granted his release from the Giants on Friday after he had been benched as starting quarterback earlier this week. Barkley, who signed with the Eagles this offseason and is having a phenomenal year amid the change of scenery, was asked about his reaction to Jones’ release during media availability on Friday. “I’m not going to speak too much on that. I’ve been in contact with him. Our friendship has stayed close throughout the whole process of me being here. It sucks to see how everything went down for him over there [with the Giants],” Barkley told reporters. “I’ve got nothing but great things to say about him. You’re not going to find anybody who’s really got a lot of negative things to say about him. But it’s the NFL. Hopefully, wherever he ends up next, they’re gonna get a guy who will come in and work. [Coming from the Giants], I’m doing well [with the Eagles]. Hopefully, he can find the same kind of fresh start and success.” Jones was in the second season of a four-year, $160 million contract with about $80 million fully guaranteed. An injury guarantee made the Giants less likely to put him on the field, forcing the team to sign Tim Boyle to the practice squad and demoting Jones to fourth-string. He spent Tuesday playing safety on the scout team. With the Giants at 2-8 — tied with the Jaguars and Raiders for the fewest wins in the league — everyone involved ultimately felt it was best for Jones to part ways.  “Daniel came to see me this morning and asked if we would release him,” Giants owner John Mara said in a statement on Friday.  “We mutually agreed that would be best for him and for the team. Daniel has been a great representative of our organization, first class in every way. His handling of this situation yesterday exemplifies just that. We are all disappointed in how things have worked out. We hold Daniel in high regard and have a great appreciation for him. We wish him nothing but the best in the future.”",2024-11-22,0,0.66,0.34

Judge, who won his second AL MVP Award this week, said during a conference call Friday that he met with Steinbrenner in Tampa shortly after the World Series and “discussed a lot of things.” That included the potential return of Soto, whose free agency has dominated the offseason so far and included a meeting with Steinbrenner and the front office, as well as Aaron Boone, in southern California. Judge said he had yet to speak with Soto since he hit free agency, preferring to leave him alone. “I think the best thing is to give those guys space,” Judge said of Soto. “I talked to him all season. He knows how we feel about him. The most important thing is to let him do his thing… and come to the right decision for him and his family.” Of course, nothing Judge could say to Soto would mean more than the bottom line, as Soto made clear throughout his season with the Yankees and throughout the playoffs, repeating that no team would have an advantage when it came to signing him, as long as they made a good offer and gave him a chance to win. So for the Yankees to keep Soto in pinstripes, it will cost them… a lot. With the free-spending Mets and Dodgers and the dangerous Red Sox and Phillies, as well as wild cards like the Blue Jays all interested in Soto, he’ll certainly earn a contract worth more than the $360 million over nine years that Judge signed two offseasons ago. Asked Friday if he would be OK being surpassed by Soto if he returned to the Yankees, Judge laughed and said of a potential Soto contract, “Honestly, it ain’t my money. I really don’t care. If we get the best players, I’m happy. It’s never been something that’s on my mind, who gets paid the most. Whatever we can do to get the best players, I’ll take it.” Judge said he’s followed Giancarlo Stanton’s example. Stanton was pleased when Bryce Harper surpassed him as having the most expensive contract in the sport. “Even though he signed one of the first big, mega contracts back in Miami, once he came here, he didn’t care about being the highest-paid guy,’’ Judge said of Stanton. “He just wanted good players around him. And I think you could ask everybody in the room, they feel the same way.” Steinbrenner said at the Owners Meetings at MLB headquarters in Midtown on Wednesday the Yankees will “be in the mix” for Soto. There’s no doubt Soto’s presence in front of Judge in the Yankee lineup had an impact on the now two-time MVP, who had an even better offensive season this past year than he did when he first won the award in 2022, when he set the AL record with 62 homers. But Judge’s meeting with Steinbrenner in Tampa, where they both live, was about more than just retaining Soto, according to Judge. “We discussed a lot of things,’’ Judge said. “From Juan, to other guys that are out there that I think could definitely help this team.”

The Yankees have question marks not only in the outfield, but everywhere in the infield other than shortstop, as well as in the rotation and bullpen. Judge will almost certainly have a voice in at least some of those decisions thanks to his chats with Steinbrenner, who Judge called “very active” in his attempts to improve the team. “The more communication you have, top to bottom, makes everybody better,’’ Judge said. “It comes with being in the position I’m in and being captain, as well. The fact they’re listening and want to know what we have to say is a pretty cool part of it.” Judge said the two met throughout the season, as well as in the offseason, when it comes to adding players or coaches. “He’s always receptive,’’ Judge said. “My first couple years, I didn’t talk to him much. Now I see how much he cares about this organization from top to bottom. It shows why we continue to be in the position we’re in.”",2024-11-22,1,0.38,0.62

Except a 76er fan booing Ben Simmons.,"PHILADELPHIA — They say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Except a 76er fan booing Ben Simmons. Brooklyn’s Simmons has a history in Philadelphia, and while he’s returned to Wells Fargo Center before, he knows full well that he’ll keep getting booed by 76ers fans for the rest of his career.  But he’s not afraid of it.  He feeds off it. “Yeah, I also love that,” said Simmons, who leads his Nets back to Philadelphia tonight. “I love being in arenas where it’s loud and people are booing and all that stuff. So, it comes with the game. It’s a part of it. And I love it.” Simmons played 275 games for the Sixers over six years, missing his rookie campaign to injury and 2021-22 to mental health issues and back woes.  His detachment, hesitancy to drive and eventual holdout made him persona non grata.  One fan famously paraded all around town with a sign saying ‘F–k Ben Simmons’ — while he was still on the roster. His divorce from the 76ers was ugly, and Simmons has been the subject of hatred from their fans ever since being dealt to the Nets for James Harden. “You can only boo so much,” Simmons shrugged. This will be Simmons’ fourth time playing at Wells Fargo Center since being traded to the Nets.

But Wells Fargo Center had to beef up security in that first return — even though he was injured and not playing — and he’s aware that Philadelphia fans have elevated booing to an art form. “Sure. That’s what Philly’s about, you know? Shoot, when I was in Philly we got booed at times when we weren’t playing well. So it goes both ways,” said Simmons. “But they’re passionate fans. And that’s why Philly the city is so great, and the fans are so great.” Simmons clearly got fired up in the win over Charlotte by his clash with Hornets star Brandon Miller.  He’ll draw inspiration from the bile that is sure to come in Wells Fargo Center. “I really hope so, because it’s just cool,” said Cam Johnson. “You step back, take a look at it. And I think that’s the cool part of being an athlete, is that people really care. They might care for you, they might kind of hate on you or whatever, but the bottom line is they care. “They have somebody that they support, they have something that they cheer for, and that’s kind of what makes our league and every other professional league and sport in general go around. So it’s just something that you’ve got to embrace. I hope he embraces it. Philly’s always kind of crazy, rowdy. They’ve got a lot to say. You know when Ben comes into town, they definitely have a lot to say. But I just hope it just gives our team energy and we’re able to feed off that.” There will surely be tons of negative energy directed at Simmons, if the Nets can flip that around to positive energy to feed off and rally around their point-forward. “Yeah, you have to as a competitor,” said Brooklyn center Nic Claxton. “If people are booing you, they don’t boo people that they don’t care about. So, you’re relevant. So, you’re in their mind. You can look at it as a good thing.”",2024-11-22,0,0.56,0.44

In the wake of the boxers’ much-maligned Nov. 15 fight, they’ve been suspended 24 days by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. The bans have nothing to do with Paul’s snoozfest of a win, Tyson’s listless return to the ring or even Netflix’s buffer-filled stream of the bout from AT&T Stadium in Arlington. Instead, the TDLR, which sanctioned the match, mandates combatants to rest three days for every round fought — meaning Paul and Tyson can’t so much as spar for 24 days following their eight-round face-off. Not that anyone involved isn’t staying busy in the meantime. Paul has received numerous challenges in the days since, including one from heavyweight champion Daniel Dubois, who seemingly slid into the 27-year-old’s DMs to request a fight. Tyson’s time has been spent explaining the various maladies that threatened the Paul bout, claiming he “almost died in June” in a post on X the day after they threw down. “Had 8 blood transfusions, he wrote. “Lost half my blood and 25lbs in hospital and had to fight to get healthy to fight so I won.” Netflix, on the other hand, isn’t suspended, but might want to sit on the sidelines for a while. The streaming giant has gone from the high of touting a record 108 million global viewers in 60 million households, to having to assuage the NFL ahead of their planned Christmas Day doubleheader over the serious broadcast issues showcased during the fight. Oh, and there’s the matter of a $50 million class-action lawsuit filed by a Florida man over the glitchy stream and one sports attorney believing several factors could lead to legal action. For those who were able to watch it, Paul won a lopsided decision to improve his record to 11-1, though he’s received plenty of flack for admitting he carried Tyson through several rounds. He walked away from the fight with a guaranteed $40 million payday while Tyson added a cool $20 million to his net worth, giving them both something to do for the next few weeks instead of strapping on the gloves: counting their boatloads of cash.",2024-11-22,0,0.57,0.43

What’s more concerning for the 76ers is that Paul George suffered a hyperextension in his left knee during the second half, forcing him to leave the game and not return.  It’s worth noting that George had the same injury during the preseason, which kept him out of the first five games.  Therefore, Philadelphia can expect to exercise some caution regarding George’s availability ahead of Friday’s game against the Nets.  Interestingly, the 76ers held a team meeting before the Grizzlies game to address their poor start and air out some grievances.  Generally, that type of Kumbaya session can help galvanize a team, but it did not significantly impact Philadelphia’s results.  The 76ers sit at 2-12 entering Friday’s game, which is the worst record in the NBA. Even the Wizards and the Jazz are ahead of them at this point. Philadelphia looks fractured at the moment, and given the injuries to their star players, I suspect they haven’t had many opportunities to practice together.  Thus, getting everyone on the same page is likely to take some time.  Although the 76ers have a talented roster on paper, their current form makes them tough to trust while laying points.

In response to a list of Diet Coke power rankings posted on X by this reporter from The Post, the star ESPN anchor of “Monday Night Countdown” and midnight “SportsCenter” laid down the gauntlet. This reporter ranked glass bottles at the top with the caveat that there might be a bias because they’re often correlated with a high-end restaurant meal, followed by fountain drinks with elite carbonation (as you’ll typically find at McDonald’s or Chick-fil-A), then cold cans, plastic bottles poured on ice, cold plastic bottle and can poured on ice with poorly carbonated tap soda (as you’ll encounter at many bars) bringing up the rear. “Can being ahead of plastic bottle is so horribly wrong I can’t even quantify it,” Van Pelt responded. He later qualified his reasoning: “Tastes so much worse [in cans],” he wrote. “It’s bitter. Not as sweet. Don’t know why.” Van Pelt has long professed himself to be a Diet Coke aficionado.  “If Diet Coke truly is bad for you…like tumors and what not…then I should just lie down and let people throw dirt on me. ‘Cause I’m toast,” he wrote in 2011. In the contemporary thread about preferences, an X user named Thom tried to tell Van Pelt that glass was tops and cans were ahead of plastic bottles. “Your name is Tom and you have an H in it. You don’t get to tell me anything,” Van Pelt answered. Another user wrote, “Take the L Scott. Can so much better than plastic bottle.” Van Pelt was undeterred, answering, “I’m taking a sip out of this bottle – which holds more of this delicious beverage and taking the W.

Television replays showed that the clock didn’t start on time after St. John’s forward Zuby Ejiofor missed the second of two free throws with 4.1 seconds left in the 22nd-ranked Johnnies’ 99-98 double overtime loss to No. 13 Baylor in the Baha Mar Hoops Championship.  It was initially deflected by RJ Luis of St. John’s, but the clock didn’t start until moments after Baylor had possession, giving Roach enough time to drain his rainbow 3-pointer at the buzzer. The officials reviewed the play, but only to make sure Roach got the shot off on time, not if the clock began appropriately. The source said the officials can review the entire play, and use a stopwatch to determine if the shot would’ve been good had the clock started when it should have and disallow the basket.  It is uncertain if Roach would’ve gotten the shot off before the horn if the clock started once Luis got his hand on the ball. He certainly would’ve had to rush more in that scenario. Asked afterwards about the clock, St. John’s coach Rick Pitino said: “I don’t know what to say, the referees didn’t do a very good job tonight.” Pitino was furious that Ejiofor was “iced” before taking his two free throws.  Baylor coach Scott Drew called for a review, thinking Ejiofor may have hit one of his players with an elbow when they fouled him, and the officials granted it. “[The official] said the coach said we elbowed [his player], which we did not do,” Pitino said. “Clear as day. It’s an unethical move. I don’t like it, but that’s not the reason we lost.”",2024-11-22,0,0.65,0.35

Eli Manning threw him the ball for Shepard’s first three years with the Giants and Jones was the passer for Shepard’s next five NFL seasons wearing Giants’ blue.  Shepard made the playoffs as a rookie in 2016 and the next time the Giants made it into the postseason, 2022, he lasted through only three games before a torn ACL ended his season.  He started only four games the next two seasons before his time with the Giants ran out. There was so much losing for Shepard with the Giants and it continues on without him, as the Giants take a 2-8 record into Sunday’s game at MetLife Stadium.  This experience with the Buccaneers gives Shepard — respected and well-liked during his stay with the Giants — a chance to see how another organization operates. “I feel like [the Giants] are a couple of pieces away from being a really good team,’’ Shepard said. “I think they have a lot of solid pieces there. When it comes to the culture and everything like that, I’ve gotten a chance to see the way things are done on a different hand but I think there could be maybe a little bit of work there.’’ The culture and everything like that? “It’s just different, in so many different ways and so many different levels,’’ he said. “When it goes down to the small things, what you can do in the building as a player, the way you’re able to communicate and be hand-in-hand with the coaches, it’s just a lot of different things I kinda picked up on being there for so long. Even down to the training staff or the weight coaches and some of the different stuff that we do here, it’s a difference. “I’m not saying the way that they do it is bad, because it’s not. It’s just different and I’ve gotten to see the other side of it.’’ Brian Daboll did not have much use for Shepard on the field in 2023 and since making the playoffs in his first year as head coach, Daboll has lost his touch, with the Giants going 8-19 the past two seasons. “I don’t think you go from being the Coach of the Year two years ago to just being a guy that can’t get the job done,’’ Shepard said. “I don’t believe that. I wish him nothing but the best. I feel like he can be a coach that can produce wins. He’s done it before and he did it early on so I don’t think you just go away from that.’’

Kelce’s Leawood, Kansas mansion was burglarized last month while the NFL star was at Arrowhead Stadium for the Chiefs’ “Monday Night Football” game against the Saints on Oct. 7. According to police documents by the Cass County Sheriff’s Office, $20,000 in cash was taken from Kelce’s home and his back door was damaged. Police did not share that a watch was taken from Kelce’s home when the news was first reported. Kelce’s home invasion took place a day after a separate burglary at Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ Belton, Mo. estate, which occurred just after midnight on Oct. 6.  Mahomes’ pregnant wife, Brittany Mahomes and their daughter Sterling, 3, and son Bronze, 1, were not home at the time of the break-in, according to ABC News. Police believe a South American crime ring is behind both burglaries, Fox 4 in Kansas City reported on Tuesday.  The next day, the NFL sent a memo to teams alerting them of organized criminals increasingly targeting the homes of professional athletes while they are away.  It included recommendations for security measures, including telling athletes not to post on social media in real time.  The burglars are skilled in conducting research for homes they’re targeting — and sometimes posing as delivery men, maintenance workers or joggers to learn about residences, neighborhoods and security systems, according to an NFL memo obtained by ABC News. NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reported the FBI is investigating the crime wave as international organized crime. The burglars are targeting items such as cash, jewelry, watches and handbags, and focusing on master bedrooms and closets, Pelissero reported, adding that they will research social media accounts and players’ families posts to make sure no one is home.

Horner, the team principal and CEO of Red Bull racing, which features three-time defending champion Max Verstappen, was accused earlier this year of sending racy text messages to a subordinate female employee of the team. Horner opened up on the saga for the first time in an interview with Daily Mail.  “What happened at the start of the year felt like a perfect storm,” Horner said. “In life, it is a great lesson that the more success you have, the more of a target you become. Anything that can be used to unsettle and destabilize you and the team and the business. What disappointed me more than anything was the steps that people went to in order to try and achieve that.” Horner was cleared of wrongdoing in a Red Bull investigation.  In the interview, he said that Halliwell was “hugely supportive.” “You just stay true to yourself and I am very fortunate that I have got a tremendous family. My wife has been unbelievable, fantastic. Your partner is always the one you share your difficulties with. She has been absolutely outstanding and hugely supportive,” Horner said. “She saw through a lot of things from having an outside perspective and it is good to have that weight and measure. It is hugely important. You learn about yourselves in times of difficulty and I was absolutely determined that we would navigate through the difficult waters.” As Verstappen has the chance to clinch his fourth straight F1 championship in Las Vegas this weekend, Horner spoke about how the controversy brought the team closer together. “In times of difficulty and when stones are being thrown, it actually galvanizes a team. I think there was an element of ‘f–k you’ from the team this year. Our people were saying ‘we are a strong team, no matter what you throw at us, bring it on,'” Horner said. “I never felt I might have to walk away. I believed in myself. I believed in the process. I trusted in the process that was scrupulously applied by the company and I just had to trust to that. When I was on the plane to Bahrain, I didn’t know whether I was going to be at the race or not,” Horner said.   “But I had to believe in the process. I have had tremendous support and backing from the shareholders and from within the company. It was actually quite emotional before the first race when I addressed the factory. I do the usual summary of the testing and what the objectives are going into the season and it was absolutely rammed.”",2024-11-22,1,0.45,0.55

In the interest of spicing up everyone’s Thanksgiving, fans on X have pleaded with the Cowboys to sign Jones after the Giants released him Friday. The Giants and Cowboys face off at 4:30 p.m. ET on Thanksgiving in a game that traditionally pulls in huge ratings. “The Dallas Cowboys have an opportunity to do the funniest thing with Daniel Jones,” former NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III wrote on X. Barstool Sports’ Big Cat agreed and put the onus on the Cowboys owner to come through for America: “Jerry Jones could do the funniest thing ever and save Thanksgiving Football.” “Daniel Jones and CeeDee Lamb on the Cowboys next week,” the FanDuel Sportsbook account wrote alongside a video of Tom Brady throwing a touchdown to Randy Moss. “I don’t ask for much, universe. But this one is a big one. Cowboys QB Daniel Jones v. the Giants on Thanksgiving. PLEASE,” ESPN’s Benjamin Solak wrote. The alternative is pretty bleak with Tommy DeVito leading the 2-8 Giants against Cooper Rush and the 3-7 Cowboys. Both NFC East teams have the opportunity to add another loss (or win!) to their ledger Sunday before the Turkey Day showdown. The Cowboys entered the season with high expectations but have been a brutal disappointment and the season officially became a wasted one when starting quarterback Dak Prescott was put on injured reserve with a hamstring injury that will keep him sidelined to 2025. Dallas has turned to veteran backup Cooper Rush and have maintained loyalty to him, despite middling results and the opportunity to give former No. 3 pick Trey Lance an opportunity. While it is possible the Cowboys would have interest in Jones, the likelihood of him being the starter less than a week after his Giants release is regrettably minimal. It is also possible the Giants worked out a handshake agreement with Jones not to sign with one of the team’s rivals this season upon his release. The Giants benched Jones on Monday and demoted him to fourth-string quarterback behind DeVito, Drew Lock and the newly signed Tim Boyle. Jones has a $23 million injury clause in his contract that made it non-sensical for the team to play him at all in meaningless games, particularly after he had been demoted from starter. “Daniel came to see me this morning and asked if we would release him,” Giants owner John Mara said in a statement on Friday. “We mutually agreed that would be best for him and for the team. Daniel has been a great representative of our organization, first class in every way. His handling of this situation (Thursday) exemplifies just that. We are all disappointed in how things have worked out.”",2024-11-22,1,0.43,0.57

Now, the same dealer who brought those rare Ty Cobb cards to market has latched onto another one inside a family heirloom collection worth plenty. It’s a deal 5 years in the making.","November 21, 2024 By Rich Mueller  Call it Lucky 7 Find II. Eight and a half years after he landed one of the most memorable–and valuable– finds of vintage baseball cards this century, the longtime owner of MINT State has uncovered another Ty Cobb Tobacco branded Cobb card, along with hundreds of others from the standard T206 set.  This time, the consignment deal Rick Snyder has acquired from a North Carolina family won’t bring as big of a windfall, but the story behind it is certainly worth telling. To understand it, one has to go back a few years. It was in March of 2016 when the South Carolina-based dealer received a phone call that led him to one family’s discovery of no less than seven T206 Cobb/Cobb back cards face down in a paper bag while they cleaned out their great grandparents’ crumbling home in a rural town in the south. Sold to collectors over a period of time, they netted about $3 million. The “Cobb Tobacco” card is a close cousin of the regular T206 Cobb red portrait but the back has an add for Cobb’s own brand of tobacco and proclaims it “King of the Smoking Tobacco World.” It’s believed the cards were placed inside tins of the Hall of Famer’s short lived brand of cut plug tobacco. Only about 15 were known to exist before the discovery.  After reading about what became known as the Lucky 7 find, the North Carolina family realized their own hoard of 570 tobacco cards that had been passed down through the generations was probably worth looking into. It had been hidden away for years, all but forgotten by current family members who weren’t collectors. “Like the Lucky 7 Find, one family member was ready to throw them out and another said ‘no, no, no’,” Snyder said.   That was in 2019. The family began researching the cards, including the Cobb, and came across coverage of the original Lucky 7 Find. Snyder wasn’t that far away and they reached out, offering scans, descriptions and a history of the collection. All but one of the T206s had Piedmont or Old Mill tobacco ads on the back.  The one exception featured the rarest brand of the 16 ad backs associated with the set:  the Cobb brand.  That card–if it was authentic–would take what looked like a very nice, star packed find into a doozy. An intrigued Snyder called back. “We later learned the entire household was huddled around the phone listening and hoping,” he reported.  “The family knew they had what appeared to be an authentic collection of tobacco cards more than 110 years old, and properly identified 545 of the cards from the T206 set with 370 different, more than 70% of the complete set.” Snyder, who often sells on consignment, expressed his interest in helping the family sell the collection but nothing came of it.  Their communication from 2019 remained at the bottom of his text message history. Patience, though, can pay off.  The family contacted him again not long ago and set up a meeting. “It went from nothing for five years to ‘let’s do this now’,’ Snyder told SC Daily.  He traveled to the neighboring state to determine once and for all if  the rare prize was authentic. “As I was examining the Cobb, my consignor asked me ‘Why are you smirking?’  I confessed it was because hers was only the second family I would ever tell that their T206 Ty Cobb with the ‘Ty Cobb’ ad brand was the real deal.”  Now graded 1.5 by PSA, the Cobb back card expected to bring a six-figure price by itself.  Only 21 copies are in PSA’s population report and nine in SGC’s, making it significantly rarer than the famed T206 Honus Wagner card. Earlier this year, a Cobb back graded 2.5 by SGC sold for $432,000. A PSA 1.5 sold back in 2019 for $138,000. The entire collection had remained in the family since the cards were produced. Originally pieced together by a former employee of the American Tobacco Company, presumably someone who worked at Factory No. 25 in Virginia, the cards were given to the North Carolina family as a gift in the first half of the 20th century.  Among the cards that had called the cigar box home for all those years were numerous Hall of Famers, including Christy Mathewson, Cy Young, Tris Speaker, other Cobb cards and assorted rarities.  All carry low technical grades, mostly because because of corner wear but a look at the images of some of the the 250 cards that were submitted for grading shows many to have eye appeal that’s off the charts, with white borders and bright color.     Keeping them tucked in a box and away from the light for about 115 years or so clearly paid dividends.  “They still have a freshness to them,” Snyder said. He estimates the value of what he’s dubbed “The Factory 25 Collection” to be between $300,000 and $400,000.    MINT State will soon start selling the collection on behalf of the family, individually and in groups. About 250 of the cards were graded.   The Cobb card, of course, is the star of the show. “What makes this example so special is that it has no creases or surface wrinkles, typically found on the vast majority of the Cobb with Cobb back,” Snyder remarked. “The card also displays nearly perfect centering on both the front and back.  Extraordinary eye appeal for the PSA 1.5 grade.”   Oh, and that original find from 2016?  The family from the small town later uncovered an eighth Cobb.  Of the 21 reviewed by PSA over the last 30 years or so, Snyder has now submitted nine of them. It’s safe to say the original Lucky 7 Cobb Find is one that won’t be duplicated but being able to sell a fresh copy of one of collecting’s truly rare cards in 2024 is certainly something Snyder wasn’t anticipating. “I guess lightning can and does strike the same place twice.” Rich is the editor and founder of Sports Collectors Daily.

Sports Collectors Daily,Top-Rated 1934 World Wide Gum Set Featured In Heritage Auctions Sale,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/top-rated-1934-world-wide-gum-set-featured-in-heritage-auctions-sale/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 02:40:39 +0000","Much rarer than its Goudey brother, the Canadian issue is even tougher to find in anything resembling higher grade. The set being offered by Heritage Auctions is the best one on PSA's Registry.","November 21, 2024 By Bob D'Angelo  The 1930s saw the Goudey Gum Company produce some iconic cards of baseball stars. North of the border, Canadian-based World Wide Gum produced a similar version, but with several key differences. A complete, 96-card set of the 1934 World Wide Gum set, commonly called the “Canadian Goudey,” is part of Heritage Auctions’ Winter Sports Catalog Auction that runs from Dec. 5 to Dec. 7. What makes this set  — catalogued as V354 — so special is that it is the No. 1 All-Time Finest set on the PSA registry. Bidding for the set has already reached $50,000; figure in the 20% buyer’s premium and the top bid is actually $60,000. Heritage Auctions will announce whether the reserve for this item has been met on Dec. 2.  The World Wide Gum set is much rarer than the ’34 Goudey issue.  PSA has graded fewer than 1,800 World Wide Gum cards to date, compared to more than 27,000 Goudeys.  The 1934 World Wide Gum set combines elements of the 1933 and ’34 Goudey designs. The first 48 cards in the set mirror the 1933 Goudey/World Wide Gum design on the front, while cards 49 through 96 are carbon copies of the 1934 set, complete with the “Lou Gehrig Says …” intro. The 1934 set was the final time that World Wide Gum used color on its card fronts. It had white borders and colorful, artistic renditions of the players. The card backs are bilingual, with type in both English and French. They measured 2 3/8 inches by 2 7/8 inches.  The set has some of the biggest names in baseball, and one that was missing from the 1934 Goudey issue — Babe Ruth. Although the Bambino had four cards in the 1933 Goudey set, he had none in the 1934 offering. His 1934 World Wide Gum card uses the same design of the No. 53 card in the ’33 Goudey set. The only difference is the back, with its bilingual type. In the World Wide Gum set, key cards include Ruth (No. 28), Gehrig (No. 92), Rogers Hornsby (No. 1), Dizzy Dean (No. 55) and Jimmie Foxx (No. 58). The set offered in the Heritage Auctions sale includes five cards with a PSA 9 grade, albeit one with a qualifier. Eighteen cards have PSA 8 grades, including Hall of Famers Hornsby, Earle Combs (No. 32), Jesse Haines (No. 44) and an off-center Red Ruffing (No. 48). The largest group of graded cards are 34 PSA 7s, which feature Hall of Famers Ruth,, Dean, Foxx, Rabbit Maranville (No. 4), Herb Pennock (No. 16), Tris Speaker (No. 29) and Charlie Gehringer (No. 57), which is spelled “Charley” in the set. There are 22 cards graded at PSA 6, including Hall of Famers Frank Frisch (No. 64), Leo Durocher (No. 69) and Luke Appling (No. 84). Nine cards are in EX (PSA 5) condition, with Cooperstown enshrines Mickey Cochrane (No. 59), Heinie Manush (No. 68) and Carl Hubbell (No. 71) featured. There are seven PSA 4 cards, highlighted by Hall of Famers Gehrig, Bill Terry (No. 53), Lefty Grove (No. 54), Chick Hafey (No. 78) and Ernie Lombardi (No. 82). Ruth, Gehrig, Dean and Hornsby are the most coveted cards in the set. Ruth was declining as a star but still hit 34 home runs and had 104 RBI in 1933. His numbers fell to 22 homers and 84 RBI in 1934, his final season with the New York Yankees. Gehrig was at his peak in 1934, winning the Triple Crown with 49 home runs and 166 RBI while hitting .363. Dean had his greatest season in 1934, winning 30 games and two more in the World Series as the St. Louis Cardinals soared as baseball’s best that year. Hornsby, meanwhile, was a player-manager in 1934 for the St. Louis Browns, who went 67-85 and finished in sixth place.

Sports Collectors Daily,Injury Delays but Shouldn’t Derail Market for Alex Ovechkin Cards,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/alex-ovechkin-most-watched-hockey-cards/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 01:39:30 +0000","Despite his recent injury, Alex Ovechkin's chase for the Wayne Gretzky's all-time goals record is adding excitement to the hockey card market.  Jeff Morris also takes us back to the start of his career, when he was trying to get the hang of signing autographs.","November 21, 2024 By Jeff Morris  As if the Canada Post strike that removed thousands of Canadian buyers and sellers from online auctions wasn’t a big enough blow to the hockey card market this week. The most anticipated moment of the 2024-25 NHL season took a hit when Jack McBain of the Utah Hockey Club and Alex Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals met in an ugly knee-on-knee collision that left Ovechkin in a crumpled heap on the ice. Alex Ovechkin is slow to get up after colliding knee-to-knee with Jack McBain. pic.twitter.com/gQNOiDMcPR — Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) November 19, 2024  Suddenly, the excitement of Ovie breaking Wayne Gretzky’s once-thought untouchable career goal scoring record was put into doubt. Tom Wilson of the Capitals “sorted things out” with McBain, instantly christened as the Jeff Gillooly of the NHL. Unfortunately, fans took things too far, as McBain received death threats on social media.  Ovechkin is now expected to be out 4-6 weeks with a broken bone in his leg. He was on a tear in the early season, with an NHL-leading 15 goals in 18 games. He had five in two games before he went down. It was a given that Ovechkin was going to break Gretzky’s record this season. He is 27 goals behind Gretzky’s total of 894. Because of Ovechkin’s slow start last season, there were some doubts. But then, in the second half of the season, Ovechkin was lighting it up. At every single sports card show or shop where hockey cards are sold, it has been the same conversation every day for more than a year. Clearly, the answer, even after the injury, is yes. And if he’s able to get back onto the ice is less time than we feared when he went down, the next question is can he score 1,000 career goals? It sounds unrealistic. So did the thought of him ever catching Gretzky’s 894. If he finishes this season with more than 900 goals, which he should, he might be three 30-goal seasons away from a thousand. Based on how good he is at 39, why not? There is no reason to think he can’t score 40 goals at the ages of 40 and 41. Ovechkin in the sports card market is interesting. Having talked to a number of dealers and collectors, the take on Ovie is pretty consistent. Getting an Ovechkin autograph, low serial-numbered card or memorabilia card is a premium hit. But he doesn’t really drive sales of new product. His cards will be very strong on the secondary market, but no shop owners are stocking extra product because of him. Having said that, if there is an Upper Deck product with limited Gretzky autographs, box demand will spike. Connor Bedard single-handedly made the hockey market hot last year. One question that younger collectors who weren’t around when Gretzky was in his prime will often ask is if the Great 8 is more collectible than the Great One. Simply put, no. Gretzky, Gordie Howe and Bobby Orr, are in a class by themselves in the card market. But the current hobby trifecta of Ovechkin, Sidney Crosby and Connor McDavid are knocking at the door to join that Mount Rushmore of hockey cards. Connor Bedard is an entirely different discussion. But that doesn’t mean Ovechkin isn’t hot. In fact, his cards have been scorching hot.  In the month of November, more than 2,300 of his cards have changed hands on eBay. Add in shows, shops, Facebook groups, Whatnot and every other popular selling platform and you’ve got a load of Ovie. On October 30, a PSA 10 Ovechkin 2005-06 Upper Deck Authenticated autographed RC numbered to 999 sold for $13,100. Thirteen Ovechkin cards have sold for over $4,000 on eBay in the last 30 days. You can check out a current list of the most watched auctions for his cards below. If you look at the various Ovechkin rookie cards from the 2005-06 season, you will notice that the signatures vary from card to card. The signature on the Xcitement card is significantly different that the others. Also, if you take a look at all of the autographs from that year, you will see a range of different Ovechkin autographs. There is a simple explanation for it. The first time I met Alex Ovechkin was in Raleigh at the 2004 NHL Draft. He was the number one overall pick that year. I was a VP at Pacific, and we were a sponsor of the draft and the title sponsor of the hockey card and memorabilia show at the event. I met him in the photo room we had set up. Minutes after he was drafted, he came into our photo room and we took his pictures for hockey cards that ended up never being made. The lockout would cancel the 2004-05 season, and we were eventually told by the NHLPA that when play resumed, we would not longer have a license. They were giving the Upper Deck Company an exclusive deal. Ovechkin, at that time, spoke no English. It only makes sense that if he could not speak English, he could not write English. I always thought that the Xcitement autograph was some form of cursive writing in the Cryllic alphabet. I only know a few words of Russian and am not very good with their alphabet, so it’s hard to tell. Embed from Getty Images Here is something about Ovechkin that day that you may not know. His mother was with him, and she had a lot of say in his business dealings at that time. No, he’s not a mama’s boy at all. His mother, Tatyana, is the greatest Soviet basketball player of all time. She spoke some English. I told her that I had actually met her when I was 12 years old during the 1976 Montreal Olympics. I was able to go to all of the basketball games at the Forum, as my father and uncle worked the games as a photographer. While they shot games or were in the press box, I was either sitting by myself watching the game or running film. Between games one day, I went to the McDonald’s across the street. The entire Soviet women’s team came in and they all had Big Macs. It was right in the middle of the famous Big Mac Attack ad campaign. It was the first time the women had ever been to a McDonald’s. Tatyana Ovechkina sat at the table beside me. As nervous as a I was as a 12-year-old, I smiled and said hi. I had a Soviet media guide and she signed it for me, as did a few of her teammates. That media guide was among the casualties of the 1998 ice storm that destroyed much of my childhood collection. If you are wondering why that rabbit hole I just took you on is relevant, it’s because Tatyana wore number 8 throughout her long and storied career. Alex Ovechkin wears number 8 as a tribute to him mother. Embed from Getty Images Since Alex now speaks English very well, his signature is consistent. When I see his autograph and the number 8, I always think of being a 12-year-old eating a Big Mac at the St Catherines Street McDonald’s across from the Forum and getting the autograph of Ovechkin’s mom. Hockey fans are somewhat divided. There are some diehard Gretzky collectors and fans that don’t want Ovechkin to break the record. Goals aside, it’s very unlikely Ovechkin will challenge Gretzky’s points record. The feel good part of the chase, however, is that Gretzky is supporting Ovechkin and cheering him on. Gretzky says it’s great for the game. Gretzky said in an NHL.com article written by Tom Gulitti that Ovechkin breaking the career goals record was inevitable. “It’s just a matter of time, whether it’s late this year, early next year, whenever,” Gretzky told Gulitti. “I mean, he’s a great player. He’s a great goal scorer.” Gretzky was a different player than Ovechkin is. Gretzky was a playmaker, while Ovechkin is a pure shooter. “Look at guys like Brett Hull, Mario Lemieux, Mike Bossy,” Gretzky said. “They get those opportunities. They don’t miss the net. If you miss the net you can’t score. Ovi. Bossy. Jari Kurri. Brett Hull. They never miss the net. And that separates a great goal scorer from good goal scorers, right? “And he can be in any spot on the ice, he’s going to hit the net.” Ovechkin’s rival throughout his career, Sidney Crosby, is among the many current players pulling for Ovechkin to break the record. In the same article, Ovechkin predictably said that at his age, it’s about staying healthy enough to score goals. He added that the focus is on winning another Stanley Cup, not on the goals record. But he is humbled that Gretzky is cheering him on and he might talk to him more when he gets close to the record about how to handle the pressure. “If that kind of person is rooting for me, it’s pretty cool stuff,” Ovechkin told Gulitti. “He’s the best player out there and he’s a great human. He supports me and it’s a pretty cool thing.” Clearly, in the last 20 years, Alex Ovechkin has learned to speak English and sign his autograph very well.

Clemente Lisi joins Drew to talk about the big Toronto Expo last week and his experiences north of the border. Plus Drew and co-host Arron Littleton talk TTM successes and all the latest hobby news. You can listen to this week’s show here. TTM Successes
Sometimes a nice week at the mailbox can re-energize your pen, as this weekend I dropped 14 request letters in the mailbox. Hopefully I’ll be able to send a few more before the end of the year, though I’ll come up well short of my goal of 300. Here are some recent returns. Espen Knutsen  Almost 22 years ago, I started working on getting the 2002-03 Topps Total hockey card set signed. With Knutsen’s arrival, I am down to only three cards left on the set– Paul Kariya, Mark Messier, and Jason Allison. The light at the end of the tunnel shines just a little brighter. Knutsen signed this via his home address in Norway in two and a half months. Paul Kariya  Kariya has never been known to be a good TTMer– or even a good in-person signer. Most attempts in-person would get ignored, and for decades any attempts by mail resulted in an auto-penned photo being sent back. But a year ago I saw someone say he got a success via the Hockey Hall of Fame, so I sent one off myself. A year later, I got back this 1998-99 Pacific card signed– more on that below. This took exactly a year and a day, sent to the Hockey Hall of Fame. Jim Strickland  Any week where you get two set hits is great. Strickland pitched for the Twins and Indians in the 1970s. He shares a 1972 Topps high number card with Vic Albury and Rick Dempsey. After getting Dempsey on it, I mailed off to Strickland as well. Albury unfortunately died in 2017, so this is as complete as this one will get. Jim signed this for me in a month via his California home. Ruminations on success, failure, and areas in between
I was once asked at age 15 during a church “Coming Of Age” class (basically confirmation for the Unitarian Universalist world): what does success mean? What does it look like? What is it? I couldn’t really define it well then and at 40 I still don’t know. But in the TTM world it seems pretty cut and dried: success is sending a letter and getting an autograph back. But this week’s autograph from Paul Kariya has made me question that simple definition: are there tiers of success? As you saw above in my Espen Knutsen info, Kariya is one I have left in my Topps Total set. And I mailed that card– and only that card– in my request to him. He or whoever handles his mail sent the card back unsigned and put in a signed 1998-99 Pacific card in its place. Why players do this sometimes I don’t understand but they do.  I have never been that close to getting the card I need signed from a tough signer and just barely coming up short. I hate sounding spoiled here. After all, I got an autograph from a tough-to-get Hall of Famer, and he returned my unused SASE and paid his own Canadian postage, so I saved some money as well. But when you have a goal and you get agonizingly close and come up short, you wonder if you had a really good failure, or a bad success. It’s like asking a player to sign a ball, or a puck, or a photo and getting it smeared. Sure it’s a success, but… How close will I ever get again? Do I just need to mail off every year until it gets done or doesn’t come back at all? On the overall spectrum of success-to-failure, this is on the better end, for sure. But still… the pain! Maybe I’ll get lucky and someone working on a signed 1998-99 Pacific set needs this and has a Topps Total to trade me. It seems unlikely but hey, why not dream?

Janet Mills, at a special event at the","The woods and the water of Maine come together in the new primary jerseys for Portland Hearts of Pine, who will make their debut in USL League One in March 2025. The jerseys were unveiled in front of 1,500 supporters, including Gov. Janet Mills, at a special event at the State Theater in Portland on the evening of Thursday, November 21. Hearts of Pine executive creative director Burke Cherrie, who co-designed the kits with club founder Gabe Hoffman-Johnson, told SportsLogos.net in an interview just hours before the reveal that the club was aiming for a timeless design that people across Maine would be proud to wear. “Mainers, in particular, like the old ways. There’s a convergence of the old ways and the new ways here,” Cherrie said. “We don’t discard the past. That’s something that really resonated throughout the branding process. In town halls with supporters and local government officials, talking with people who run businesses, there was a desire for this to be as Maine as possible. And history and heritage are a key part of that.” The jersey features navy blue and forest green hoops all over the front, back and sleeves to represent the Atlantic Ocean and the woods that Mainers interact with every day, either for recreation or to earn a living. The sleeve cuffs and polo collar are navy blue with red trim inspired by the heart in the club’s crest. The club motto, “Lead With Your Heart,” and Dirigo heart logo — a mashup of their heart iconography and the “Dirigo star” from the Maine flag — appear on the back collar. “We’ve been working on the [kit] design for really over a year. As we were developing the crest and everything else that went into the brand, the jersey design was front and center in that process,” Cherrie said. “Gabe and I are lifelong soccer fans, and there’s a lot of nostalgia for ’90s soccer culture, from when we were growing up,” he added. “I have a lot of great memories of long-sleeved jerseys and big collars and cuffs. A soccer jersey is performance wear, but it’s also fashion in today’s world. To bring back some of those trends, we felt there was an opportunity to lean into that.” The front-of-shirt sponsor is Visit Maine, the state’s tourism office, and their logo of the state’s name with a period appears in white. The sleeve sponsor is L.L.Bean, the outdoor clothing and equipment retailer based in Maine. “I would argue we have the best front-of-shirt and sleeve sponsorship combo in American soccer, and probably the world,” Cherrie said. “I don’t think you can find a European club or a South American club that has a more unified club brand aligned with its sponsors’ brands. That’s a credit to the team that’s been working on sponsorships, the commercial side of things, to bring that to life.” The kits are manufactured by Danish sportswear company Hummel, who also produce kits for Denmark’s national teams as well as German Bundesliga team Werder Bremen; Spanish La Liga clubs UD Las Palmas, Real Betis and RC Celta de Vigo; and French Ligue 1 side AS Saint-Étienne. “It’s a small world, and I’m fortunate to have friends on the other side of the table,” said Cherrie, who has worked in sports media for more than a decade, collaborating with high-profile European clubs like Liverpool and Chelsea in the past. “I’m a huge soccer fan, and my dad was obsessed with the 1992 Danish national team that wore Hummel. The chevrons and the history that’s gone into that 100-year-old brand, that always felt like a really good fit for us. And they really align with the culture of Maine; it’s a brand that punches above its weight.” Portland Hearts of Pine will kick off its 2025 USL League One season at Fitzpatrick Stadium, a 6,300-seat facility in Portland. The club launched its crest — also co-designed by Cherrie — in April 2024, which incorporates elements from the Maine seal and other state symbols. The heart in the crest is inspired by the Valentine’s Day Bandit, whose tradition of decorating storefronts and other structures in Portland with red hearts every February 14 has carried on beyond the original Bandit’s passing in 2023. Though he grew up in Pennsylvania and went to college in New York City, Cherrie has called Maine home for the past six years. To spearhead the development of a brand for a local team and watch his designs become reality has a real thrill for him. “To walk down the street and see a crest you helped create on someone’s hat at happy hour or whatever it is, it’s special to see that,” he said. “The way Portland and much of Maine has taken to the brand has been amazing.” He adds, though, that since the crest unveiling, Hearts of Pine has shipped merchandise to 45 different U.S. states and internationally. “Once you’re a Mainer, it sticks with you.” The 2025 USL League One regular season will kick off in March. Hearts of Pine plans to reveal a second kit in February and a third kit a month or two into the season, depending on potential kit clashes with opponents. Cherrie was coy about the details of the second and third kits, but did say the team was “cooking up something pretty unique” for those. “As excited as I am about this one, I think the second and third kits are going to strike a different chord with both fans of the club and people who collect jerseys,” he said. The Woods and Water Kit is available in unisex short-sleeve, unisex long-sleeve, women’s and kids’ sizes through Hearts of Pine’s online store and at the club’s holiday pop-up shop in Portland.",2024-11-22,1,0.35,0.65

They're still celebrating a World Series championship, so one could forgive the Dodgers if they decided to take a half-day. But instead, they made sure to knock one item off their 2025 to-do list, locking in one of their expected starting pitchers on a new salary. Tony Gonsolin, a former National League All-Star who missed the entire 2024 season while rehabbing from Tommy John surgery, could be an under-the-radar addition to the Dodgers' star-studded rotation, which will be headlined by Tyler Glasnow, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, and Shohei Ohtani. On Friday, according to Mark Feinsand of MLB.com, the Dodgers and Gonsolin agreed upon a $5.4 million salary for 2025, avoiding arbitration. Gonsolin had played out the previous two seasons on a two-year, $6.5 million extension, and is once again arb-eligible for 2026. In 2022, his last semi-full season at the big-league level, Gonsolin was sensational. He made his first All-Star team, went 16-1 to lead the majors in winning percentage (.941), and finished the year with a 2.14 ERA in 24 starts. Gonsolin briefly returned to pitch in Triple-A in September, but he'll be making his first big-league appearance since August 2023 when he takes the hill this spring. The Dodgers have plenty of other rotation options, but there should be a spot for the 30-year-old as long as he looks like his old self. Having Gonsolin locked into a deal before the holidays should help the veteran focus on what matters most--his performance on the mound. If he can contribute to the rotation in a meaningful way, the Dodgers might be truly unstoppable next season.

Landers proposed the bombshell transfer portal possibility while operating under the hypothetical that Quinn Ewers returns to Texas. “Brian Kelly is a man in need of a lifeline right now, with his LSU team reeling after three straight losses and top 2025 QB Bryce Underwood flipping his commitment to Michigan on Thursday night,” Landers prefaced before saying, “And what a lifeline Manning would be, a guy who was just as sought-after as Underwood coming out of high school — and who just so happened to grow up nearby in New Orleans? “The Tigers weren't on Manning's initial list of finalists, which could be a sign that Manning is looking to get a little bit further away from home. But they have the recent track record in QB development, having put Jayden Daniels (and soon Garrett Nussmeier) into the NFL and churning out great receivers on a regular basis. There isn't much behind Nussmeier for 2025, and if Manning becomes available, LSU could take all that Underwood money and simply redirect it to the next best thing.” Horns247’s Chip Brown reported on November 21 that Ewers is expected to declare for the 2025 NFL draft. “I spoke to two sources close to Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers on Wednesday night who said they expect Ewers to enter the 2025 NFL Draft after this season, meaning Saturday's game against Kentucky (2:30 p.m., ABC) would be Ewers' last regular-season home game as a Longhorn,” Brown wrote. Manning would represent a dramatic upswing for a Kelly-led program with practically no narrative wins to stand in recent months besides early-season wins over Ole Miss and South Carolina. In truth, LSU is supposed to win those matchups every year given the program’s pedigree.  With all that said, Manning could do worse than a school that turned two recent transfers, Joe Burrow and Jayden Daniels, into Heisman winners.

""The best front offices in the MLB are creative. On the surface, Alex Bregman isn't a fit for Atlanta,"" wrote Kline. ""He's a battle-tested third baseman and the Braves already have an All-Star at the hot corner in Austin Riley. Bregman has said he's open to playing second base, but that's Ozzie Albies' position.

Albies made 195 starts at shortstop as a minor league player before his debut. He only made 93 starts at second base before his debut. Playing shortstop in the big leagues is not easy, but signing Bregman and moving Albies to shortstop could do a lot for the Braves offense. Albies is an upgrade offensively over Orlando Arcia at shortstop. Bregman is a two-time All-Star and slashed .260/.315/.453 with 26 home runs last season.

Their offensive line was stretched so thin last week that tackle Jake Curhan, who had bounced around on the practice squad this season, was called upon to play 65 offensive snaps at left guard against the Green Bay Packers. Curhan held up surprisingly well, however, and the Bears will get starter Tevin Jenkins (ankle) back in the lineup this week against the Vikings after he was removed from Friday’s injury report. The Bears will need all the help they can get to protect rookie QB Caleb Williams against Minnesota, which enters Week 12 among the NFL leaders in sacks (35) and total takeaways (21). The Vikings head to Soldier Field relatively healthy, despite what has been a tough stretch of three consecutive road games.  Who’s in and who’s out for this key Week 12 divisional matchup? Here’s a full team-by-team injury breakdown, with the latest updates off of Friday’s practice reports: Bates was knocked out of Chicago’s loss to the Green Bay last week, and was unable to clear the NFL’s five-step concussion protocol. Curhan was pressed into action, but Chicago has the luxury of going back to Jenkins, their former second-round pick. Hicks was unable to log a single practice after an ankle injury limited him to 39 snaps against the Packers last week. He had been the Bears’ starting free safety since Week 6. Chicago will turn to sixth-year pro Jonathan Owens for an expanded role against Minnesota.  The rookie third-round pick out of Yale will miss his fourth straight game after injuring his calf in Week 8 against the Washington Commanders. The rookie has played 54 total offensive snaps this season in a reserve role. Swift was able to log a full practice on Friday, which likely puts him on the right side of questionable to face the Vikings. The Bears used closer to a 50/50 split at running back last week against the Packers, with Roschon Johnson matching his season high with 10 carries on 30 offensive snaps. Oliver will be inactive for the first time this season after being held back in practice this week. T.J. Hockenson is back leading the Vikings tight end depth chart. Oliver’s absence could mean a slight uptick in playing time for veteran Johnny Mundt, who has 15 receptions on 22 targets through 10 games this season. Murphy drew the questionable tag after being ruled out early last week. The exciting undrafted rookie out of UCLA has now practiced in full on five straight days. He had his 21-day practice window opened on Nov. 6, so his NFL debut could be coming Sunday. The Vikings would have to make a roster move, though, to activate him off injured reserve.  Muse hasn’t played since Week 2, but he had his 21-day practice window opened this week. He was able to log three full practices. The Vikings have taken a cautious approach with guys coming off extended injuries this season, but Muse’s services could be needed this week with Oliver already ruled out.

For the first time, the NFL has flexed one of its games into Thursday Night Football.  The Broncos' Week 16 game against the Los Angeles Chargers – originally scheduled for Sunday, December 22 – will now take place on Thursday, December 19. The game will replace what was originally scheduled between the Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals, which will now be shifted to that Sunday. It will be the Broncos' second Thursday night game this season, having defeated the New Orleans Saints 33-10 back in Week 7.  But that is where this move gets interesting.  Because it will be the second time the Broncos have had to place a Thursday night game on the road this season, the team had to sign off on the league's idea to reschedule it.  Broncos had to sign off on the Week 16 TNF flex, b/c it's their 2nd TNF road game. They were alerted Tuesday. Interesting element—Denver plays Cincinnati in Week 17 (X-mas week). Bengals got flexed out of TNF. So Denver gains the edge that the Bengals previously had for Week 17. This means that the Broncos chose to approve that decision, which is strange. It's a divisional road game against a team that they will be contending with for playoff positioning. This move gives the Broncos two fewer days to prepare for the Chargers, who they already lost to once this season.  The Broncos will get some extra rest before having to play the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 17. But in a critical spot on the schedule against a strong team, there doesn't seem to be one good reason why the Broncos didn't tell the league no when approached with this proposition.  It remains to be seen how this game will turn out, but if the Broncos come out sloppy in this one – as many road teams on Thursday nights do – it will be easy to second agreeing to have this game flexed.  Broncos had much better deal on the table for Jerry Jeudy, according to report Broncos safety won't play in any games this season Broncos encouraged to sign Saints tight end in 2025 wave of free agency Bo Nix has surprisingly never met the best player in Denver Broncos history Broncos receive highest grade of Week 11 following win over Falcons Travis Wakeman has been covering the NFL since 2012 when he started with Bleacher Report.

They could turn to the trade market to add an arm this winter. While listing ""emergency"" signings the Braves can make if Soto lands in the National League East, FanSided's Christopher Kline urged the Braves to make a blockbuster trade for Chicago White Sox ace Garrett Crochet. ""Sometimes it's best to zag when other teams zig. If the Mets or Phillies load up on offense with Soto, perhaps the Braves should take the opposite approach and add Garrett Crochet to arguably the best pitching staff in the National League,"" wrote Kline. ""We've seen Atlanta connected to Crochet and it's a clear fit, made all the more appealing with Fried's potential departure looming over the franchise."" 2024 was Crochet's first season as a starter. All he did was earn an All-Star nod and pitch to a 3.58 ERA. Bringing him to Atlanta could potentially replace Max Fried. He would not have the pressure of a No. 1 starter pitching behind National League Cy Young Award winner Chris Sale. Spotrac projects Crochet to sign a six-year, $136 million deal when he hits free agency after the 2026 season. USA Today's Bob Nightengale revealed that the White Sox plan to move Crochet this winter. ""No already-employed player was sought after more at these GM meetings than Chicago White Sox starter Garrett Crochet, who struck out 209 batters in 146 innings and earned only $800,000 last season,"" wrote Nightengale.

Brian Callahan's squad has lost five of its last six games and will likely obtain a top-three selection in the 2025 NFL Draft.  The Titans suffered their eighth loss of the campaign to the Minnesota Vikings in Week 11 and will travel to NRG Stadium to square off against the Houston Texans in Week 12. Though many factors have contributed to an underwhelming season in Nashville, quarterback play has been Tennessee's Achilles heel this season. Will Levis has struggled with turnovers and erratic plays, while backup quarterback Mason Rudolph didn't do anything special during his time as the starter when Levis dealt with a shoulder injury. The Titans could select a quarterback in the first round of the draft this offseason, but there is no clear solution to the team's biggest issue currently on the roster. That said, ESPN's Ben Solak believes Tennessee should make a move for former New York Giants' signal caller Daniel Jones. The Titans are in a similar spot to the Panthers. There's a little more hope for Will Levis, but Tennessee should and will be investigating all quarterback options this offseason. If the Titans want to bring Jones in as a potential veteran bridge, they can sign him now and potentially give him a start or two down the stretch once they're mathematically eliminated from playoff contention. The Titans have been using Levis more in the designed running game as of late, and Jones would benefit from that usage -- but that seems more like an invention of necessity than what coach Brian Callahan sees as ideal for his offense. Jones might not be the best schematic fit in Tennessee right away, but he's pretty much a better version of Levis across the board right now, so he'd bring improvement to the offense immediately. The Giants released Jones on Friday after six up and down years. The former Duke standout was benched on Monday and dropped all the way down to QB4 on New York's depth chart before his release, per Charlotte Carroll of The Athletic.  Jones has been uninspiring in ten starts this season, tossing eight touchdowns to seven interceptions with a 79.4 passer rating. The 2019 No.6 overall pick still has some talent, but his accuracy and ball security have regressed in 2024.   Though Levis likely isn't the answer for the Titans at the sport's most vital position, acquiring Jones would be a terrible move from general manager Ran Carthon. Levis and Jones have many of the same flaws, and Tennessee already has a solid backup in Rudolph.  The only logical reason for signing Jones is that the Titans would acquire a compensatory draft pick in April's draft if the former first-round pick signs with another team this offseason. But overall, Tennessee should stay far away from Daniel Jones.

Lattimore, who was acquired just before the Nov. 5 trade deadline, has yet to suit up for his new squad. The Commanders knew Lattimore was dealing with a hamstring injury when they traded for him, and made the move in hopes that it could pay off down the stretch even if he wouldn't be available immediately. Should Washington be concerned about Lattimore's health? Not necessarily... yet. The Commanders' games both this Sunday and next Sunday are against reeling teams in the Cowboys and Tennessee Titans, both of whom they should be able to beat without him. After that, they have a bye week prior to their four-game to end the regular season. Those four games will be against the suddenly surging New Orleans Saints, then against the Eagles and Atlanta Falcons at home before finishing up in Dallas. That's the stretch in which Lattimore's presence will become crucial. Even though Washington made the move him anticipating a playoff run, he'll need some preparation first.

After being foiled once again by the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Central--despite stealing the Brewers' old manager, Craig Counsell--the Cubs are down in the dumps. But perhaps a blockbuster trade with the crosstown Chicago White Sox could be the pick-me-up the franchise needs. The Cubs and White Sox have partnered up on some big trades in the past, most notably the Jose Quintana deal in 2017 and the Craig Kimbrel swap in 2021. But sending a certain All-Star lefty pitcher across town just might take the cake. White Sox lefty Garrett Crochet is the biggest name on the trade market this winter, coming off an All-Star season where he struck out a ridiculous 12.9 batters per nine innings. Every contending team could use Crochet, but the Cubs might be the single team that could benefit the most from landing him. Recently, Elijah Evans of Just Baseball proposed a trade that would send Crochet to the North Side in exchange for outfielder Owen Caissie, shortstop Jefferson Rojas, and right-handed pitcher Jaxon Wiggins. ""Garrett Crochet is another level of a pitcher and the Cubs are seeking a few big pieces to push them into the legit playoff tier in the National League,"" Evans said. ""They’re likely to start with the free agent market but could slide into the Crochet sweepstakes more seriously if they can’t land a top arm available there. In terms of prospect fit, their plethora of hitters lines up well with what the White Sox want to acquire."" Caissie is Just Baseball's No. 35 overall prospect and Rojas is No. 53, so losing both would certainly weaken the Cubs' future outlook on the position player side of things. But as great as it is to have prospects, what the Cubs need now is a big-league-ready star. Crochet would change the Cubs' entire perception for the 2025 season. Rolling a trio of dominant lefties out with Crochet, Shota Imanaga, and Justin Steele could be the thing that finally vaults them over the Brewers in the Central, and possibly all the way to title contention.

Last Saturday, Boston College (5-5, 2-4 ACC) fell 38-28 to SMU (9-1, 6-0 ACC) at Gerald J. Ford Stadium. The Eagles cut the lead to 31-28 on Kyle Robichaux’s 3-yard touchdown run, then forced a SMU punt on the ensuing drive. However, Boston College’s next possession turned sour as the team faced an unwelcoming fourth-and-19 on their own 22-yard line. Quarterback Grayson James was sacked by SMU’s Jahfari Harvey for a nine-yard loss, setting up a Mustangs touchdown just four plays later. But it wasn’t just the on-field loss that left O’Brien fuming. The first-year Eagles coach has now called out the SMU fanbase, saying the atmosphere behind Boston College’s bench last Saturday was among the worst he’s ever experienced. “I’m just going to tell you, their fans behind our bench… they were atrocious. The worst,” O’Brien said on his weekly podcast with Jon Meterparel. “I’ve been in the SEC, I’ve been in the NFL. I’ve never seen anything or heard anything like what was coming out of their fans’ mouths behind our bench. I mean, it was bad.”  Those comments carry weight considering O’Brien’s extensive coaching career through different parts of the country. The 55-year-old began his career as a tight ends coach with the Cleveland Browns, then later served as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach during the New England Patriots dynasty. He was the head coach of the Houston Texans from 2014 to 2020 and has also held college coaching roles at Georgia Tech, Maryland, Duke, and Penn State, where he led the Nittany Lions from 2012 to 2013. O’Brien’s disdain for the SMU crowd may have a logical explanation. Gerald J. Ford Stadium, with its capacity of roughly 35,000, features a student section located directly behind the visiting team’s bench. This proximity likely added to the verbal barrage aimed at O’Brien and his team. It’s worth noting that larger venues in conferences like the SEC or Big Ten often create similarly intense atmospheres, yet their student sections are nowhere near the visitors benches. At least O’Brien and Boston College can look forward to hosting SMU next season at Alumni Stadium in Chestnut Hill. As for SMU, it’s been a season worth celebrating. In their first year as members of the ACC, the Mustangs are undefeated in conference play and well on their way to the ACC Championship Game in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Dec. 7. They also recently just handed coach Rhett Lashlee a contract extension. Given their success, it’s no surprise the SMU fanbase has plenty of reasons to be fired up.

Some red flags were raised this week, however, when wide receiver DeVonta Smith was unable to practice through what has been a weeks-long hamstring issue. The Los Angeles Rams, Philly’s opponent this week on Sunday Night Football, are about as healthy as they’ve been all season. Star wideouts Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua have avoided the injury report entirely since Week 9, after both players missed time during the team’s 1-4 start to the season.  MORE: NFL picks, score predictions for Week 12: Philadelphia Eagles vs. Los Angeles Who’s in and who’s out for this key Week 12 NFC matchup? Here’s a full team-by-team injury breakdown, with the latest updates off of Friday’s practice reports: Woods, an undrafted rookie out of SMU, was unable to practice this week and hasn’t played since injuring his ankle during pregame warmups in Week 10 against the Miami Dolphins. He had earned himself a special teams role prior to the injury. He’s played just 13 total snaps on defense this season as a reserve cornerback. The Rams opened Leveston’s 21-day practice window this week, but he’ll remain on injured reserve despite logging three full practices. The seventh-round rookie’s potential NFL debut will have to wait at least another week. Havenstein appears poised to miss his third consecutive game, as he was unable to ramp up to a full practice this week and drew the doubtful tag. Warren McClendon Jr. got the start at right tackle and held up well last week in the win over the New England Patriots. He’s expected to get the nod again over Joe Noteboom. This is a major blow to Philly’s passing game, and an unexpected one coming off the mini bye week. Smith has been dealing with a hamstring issue for weeks, but it was yet to impact his playing time. He was unable to practice at all this week, though, signifying a setback with the injury. Smith’s absence should mean expanded roles for Jahan Dotson and rookies Ainias Smith and Johnny Wilson on Sunday night against the Rams. MORE: Eagles urged to unleash pair of rookie playmakers on offense The Eagles opened Covey’s 21-day practice window this week, and he was able to log three full practices. His return could be well timed with Smith already ruled out for the game. Covey was Philly’s top punt returner and caught seven passes for 34 yards over the first three games of the season.

The news put even more heat on Tigers head coach Brian Kelly, who is having a disastrous month of November.  For first-year head coach Sherrone Moore and the Wolverines, though, Underwood is a huge pickup for the 2025 recruiting class. Not to mention, this is one of the first big flips Moore can call fully his own—most of Michigan's 2024 class committed under former coach Jim Harbaugh. Why did Underwood ultimately flip? There are various reports about Michigan's NIL collective, called Champions Circle, which is said to be at the heart of the flip. Let's take a look at the big names involved in the Champions Circle, who was involved in Underwood's flip, and what it could mean for Michigan's recruiting future. NCAAF HQ: Live NCAAF scores | Updated NCAAF standings | Full NCAAF schedule Underwood's flip isn't exactly coming cheap. According to CBS Sports' Dennis Dodds, the rumored deal from Michigan is around $10 million. The New York Post reported the exact figure to be $10.5 million. According to The Advocate, LSU's NIL deal offer to Underwood was around $1.5 million. As far as the people responsible for the flip, Moore deserves a lot of credit. Per CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz, Underwood took a secret visit to Ann Arbor on Monday and Tuesday, where he shadowed Moore at practice, sat in on meetings and learned more about Michigan overall.  Zenitz adds that Underwood developed a relationship with former Wolverines star and future NFL Hall of Famer Tom Brady, which also contributed to the flip.  One other organization that apparently was crucial in pulling this off: Michigan NIL collective Champions Circle. Some of the big names involved with the collective include Michigan booster Nate Forbes — managing partner of The Forbes Company — as well as boosters Jolin and Larry Ellison. The Champions Circle released a statement following Underwood's commitment naming all three people:  Welcome Bryce Underwood, the #1 Recruit in the Nation We want to thank our Founding Members and others associated with Champions Circle who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes to make it possible to continue our work building championship teams at Michigan. Founding Member and Chairman, Nate Forbes, said: “We are very excited to keep Bryce home in Michigan as he continues to build his legacy. I want to personally thank Jolin and Larry Ellison who were instrumental in making this happen by providing Champions Circle with invaluable guidance and financial resources.” We encourage all parties who have publicly expressed interest in assisting Michigan’s NIL’s efforts to join the 11,000 individuals who have contributed to Champions Circle. For any fan wishing to support our efforts to keep Michigan the Leaders and Best, please contribute through our “Those Who Stay (Home)...” fundraising campaign. Larry Ellison is a billionaire and co-founder of Oracle. He's reportedly the second-richest man in the world. Although he is originally from New York and grew up in Chicago, he apparently was instrumental in Underwood's flip. It's unclear of his connection to the school other than the recent recruitment of Underwood. (Note: At this time, the identity of Jolin is unclear.) One other name reportedly involved is Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports. Although it's unclear if he was involved financially in any way, the Michigan alumnus stated he spoke with Underwood and his family during the process. ""Everyone's like 'Dave, how much were you involved?' Listen, there are a lot of other factors. ... Was I involved in a call with the family? Are they lovely people? Did we pitch a plan? Of course, we did,"" Portnoy said.  Champions Circle is Michigan's NIL collective, which assists athletes across all sports for the Wolverines. Here's what the collective's ""Who We Are"" page reads:  Champions Circle® is a community of fans, alumni, and supporters whose goal is empowering University of Michigan student-athletes to be the leaders and best through name, image, and likeness. Champions Circle® is committed to operating within the NCAA and university guidelines, to ensure Michigan remains at the forefront of college athletics. Champions Circle® partners with Valiant Management Group (VMG) to hold our NIL events and help with fundraising and marketing activities. There are numerous board members also listed on the website, including Forbes. According to a list of top NIL collectives put together by On3Sports, Champions Circle is 13th nationally. Per On3, each collective included were estimated to spend over $200 million this year.  Ellison co-founded the Oracle Corporation, a multinational computer technology company, in 1979. According to Forbes, his net worth is right around $235.3 billion—yes, that's billion, with a b. Forbes lists Ellison second on their list of billionaires behind Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX founder. Portnoy, who founded Barstool Sports in 2004, has a reported net worth of around $150 million.  In Michigan's first season without Jim Harbaugh, it's no secret that the Wolverines have struggled at quarterback. Michigan has gone back and forth between Davis Warren and Jack Tuttle. With just two games left against Northwestern and Ohio State, the Wolverines are not yet bowl eligible with just five wins.  As Sporting News' Bill Bender notes, Underwood is Michigan's the highest-rated highest-ranked quarterback per 247Sports, and is just the fifth five-star signal-caller the Wolverines have recruited since 2005. The last two were Chad Henne in 2005 and Ryan Mallett in 2007. Regardless of how the deal was done, this is a ginormous recruiting win for Moore and Michigan, and it puts the Wolverines right back in the playoff and Big Ten title conversation for 2025.  Morgan Moriarty joined The Sporting News as a content producer in the fall of 2024.

They may have to dump an expensive contract to do so.,"Aaliyan Mohammed The Chicago Cubs are going to be aggressive this offseason after missing the postseason in 2024. They may have to dump an expensive contract to do so. FanSided's Zach Pressnell predicted that the Cubs would trade Cody Bellinger by the end of Major League Baseball's Winter Meetings because his contract could prevent them from signing star free agents. ""For Chicago, it's the contract that kills them,"" wrote Pressnell. ""Having to pay Bellinger right around $30 million for the next year or two is quite crippling to the pursuit of any big-name free agent like Corbin Burnes or Pete Alonso."" Bellinger signed a three-year, $80 million deal with the Cubs before last season. The deal included player options for 2025 and 2026. He accepted his option for 2025, meaning the Cubs are set to pay him $27.5 million. The belief around the league is that the Cubs are actively trying to trade Bellinger, according to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal. ""While rival executives say the Chicago Cubs want to trade first baseman/outfielder Cody Bellinger, they also note the difficulty the team likely will face pulling off such a move,"" wrote Rosenthal. ""They should be able to pull off a trade, but it may look more like a salary dump than trading somebody who was an MVP candidate in 2023,"" wrote Pressnell. ""A team like the New York Yankees or New York Mets makes sense as a landing destination, depending on where Juan Soto lands."" Bellinger is a good player, but the Cubs need an upgrade at first base. With Pete Alonso available, they need as much room to spend as possible. The Cubs could also target a guy like Blake Snell or Max Fried. Regardless of who they target, Bellinger's contract on the payroll is not going to help them out.

Both fighters demonstrate particular prowess in the striking department, with each having sharp combination attacks and rare knockout power for the flyweight division. The aspect of their games which is not rare for 125-lbs is their grappling ability, as both young athletes can also defend takedowns, scramble like their life depends on it, and even attack with their own grappling.  Jose and Lone’er are making their UFC debut at 23 and 25-years old, respectively, which can bring mental pressure that could cause one fighter to have an off-night, but on paper this should be a close bout. As a result, the -370 betting line in the favor of Kavanaugh is somewhat confusing. Kavanaugh has one of the greatest regional highlight-reel knockouts ever, it is true, and has faced a difficult level of competition for such a young fighter, having won five straight against undefeated opponents like another top prospect in An Tuan Ho.

Perhaps that could lead to some unexpected fireworks. Last winter, the Phillies focused more on locking in their existing core than bringing in outside free agents. They thought their roster was good enough to win a World Series in 2024, and it couldn't get the job done once the playoffs rolled around. This time around, the Phillies must go for broke. They need to win at least one championship in the Bryce Harper era, and the best way to do so could be to shock the sport with a blockbuster trade. The top trade target in Major League Baseball this winter is Chicago White Sox left-hander Garrett Crochet, who could make any team's rotation better. Crochet, a 2024 All-Star, racked up an impressive 209 strikeouts in his first year as a full-time starting pitcher. Elijah Evans of Just Baseball recently proposed a deal that would send Crochet to Philadelphia for catcher Eduardo Tait, shortstop Starlyn Caba, outfielder Gabriel Rincones Jr., and right-handed pitcher Michael Mercado. ""Cristopher Sanchez is far from a lock to maintain his elite numbers and Ranger Suarez was brutal in the later portion of the season. Securing another star arm to slot in behind Zack Wheeler, while having Andrew Painter on the way, would make this the best rotation in baseball heading into 2025,"" Evans said. ""(The trade) presents Chicago with two core pieces for the distant future when they hope to be competitive again. A third piece that is closer to being league-ready would need to be added in for a little bit of safety, but this deal would be the upside swing type for Chicago."" Tait and Caba are Just Baseball's No. 52 and No. 72 overall prospects, so giving up both would hurt the Phillies' future outlook on the position player side, but acquiring a true ace like Crochet necessitates giving up something of value.  If the lefty continues to pitch the way he did in 2024, a deal like this could turn the Phillies into instant title favorites. They've got to get the job done in the playoffs somehow, and having Crochet in their corner might just be the thing that puts them over the top.

If you’re tired of leaving your wagers to chance, it’s time to sharpen your approach with some smart tips for betting on sports and beating the odds. [&#8230;]","Betting on sports isn’t just about luck—it’s a skill, a blend of strategy, research, and discipline that separates consistent winners from those who are just chasing the thrill. If you’re tired of leaving your wagers to chance, it’s time to sharpen your approach with some smart tips for betting on sports and beating the odds. Let’s dive into the tips for betting on sports that can transform your bets into a more calculated and profitable endeavor. First things first: knowledge is power. Betting blindly on your favorite team because you’re emotionally invested is a recipe for disaster. You need to approach every bet with cold, hard logic. Start by researching the teams, players, and stats. Look at recent form, head-to-head records, injuries, and even the weather if it’s a factor. A bettor armed with data is far more dangerous than one relying on gut feelings. Speaking of odds, always shop around. Different bookmakers offer varying odds for the same events, and those slight differences can add up over time. Use odds comparison websites to find the best value for your bets. Remember, your goal is to get the most return for the risk you’re taking. Never settle for less when better odds are just a click away. Bankroll management is the cornerstone of smart sports betting. Set aside a specific amount of money for betting, and never exceed it. A good rule of thumb is to wager no more than 1-5% of your bankroll on a single bet. This strategy ensures you can weather losing streaks without going broke. Treat your bankroll like an investment fund—guard it with discipline and never bet impulsively. Avoid chasing losses. It’s easy to let frustration dictate your decisions after a string of bad bets. But doubling down in an attempt to recoup losses often leads to bigger mistakes. Stick to your strategy, and remember that sports betting is a marathon, not a sprint. Consistency is what builds long-term success. Diversify your bets. Sure, single bets on match outcomes are straightforward, but they’re not the only game in town. Explore other markets like over/under goals, player props, or handicap betting. These options can provide better value, especially in games where the outcome seems too close to call. And if you’re feeling adventurous, accumulators can offer big payouts—just remember, they’re high-risk and require all selections to hit. Live betting is another arena where smart bettors can gain an edge. Watching a game unfold in real time gives you insights that pre-match stats can’t provide. You might notice a team dominating possession or a key player struggling with form. Use this information to make more informed in-play bets. Just be cautious—live betting moves fast, so stay focused and avoid impulsive decisions. Know when to walk away. Sometimes, the smartest bet is the one you don’t place. If the odds don’t offer value, or if you’re unsure about an event, it’s better to pass. There’s always another game, another opportunity. Forcing bets out of boredom or desperation is a surefire way to drain your bankroll. Stay informed about promotions and bonuses. Many bookmakers offer free bets, enhanced odds, or cashback deals, especially for new customers. While these offers can’t guarantee wins, they’re great for reducing risk or increasing potential returns. Just make sure to read the terms and conditions—hidden restrictions can limit your ability to profit. Finally, keep your emotions in check. Betting is exciting, but it can also be frustrating when things don’t go your way. Remember, even the smartest punters don’t win every time. Success comes from sticking to your strategy, staying disciplined, and learning from both wins and losses. Betting on sports should be fun, but it’s also a test of patience and resilience. Smart sports betting isn’t about making reckless wagers in the heat of the moment. It’s about playing the long game, finding value, and managing your bankroll wisely. With these tips, you’ll be better equipped to beat the odds and enjoy the thrill of betting with a sharper edge.",2024-11-22,1,0.49,0.51

Odds aren’t just random numbers—they reflect the bookmaker’s assessment of the likelihood of an outcome, while also determining how much you stand to win. Whether you’re a casual bettor or aiming to turn a profit, knowing how to read and calculate payouts from odds can give you a significant edge. Let’s break it all down. Betting odds serve two purposes: they indicate the probability of an event happening and determine the payout you’ll receive if your bet wins. Different regions and platforms use different formats for odds, but the underlying principle remains the same. The three most common odds formats are: To calculate profit with decimal odds, use this formula:
Profit = (Odds x Stake) – Stake Odds also reflect implied probability, which is how likely a bookmaker thinks an outcome is. The lower the odds, the higher the perceived probability. For example: To calculate implied probability, use these formulas: For example: Bookmakers often build a margin (called the overround) into the odds to ensure they profit regardless of the outcome. This means the combined implied probabilities for all outcomes in a market will usually exceed 100%. Calculating your payout is crucial for managing your bets and spotting value. Here’s how to calculate total return and profit for each odds format: Understanding odds isn’t just about payouts; it’s also about spotting value. A value bet occurs when you believe an outcome is more likely than the odds suggest. For example, if a bookmaker offers odds of 3.00 (33.33% implied probability) on a team you estimate has a 50% chance of winning, that’s a value bet. Mastering how odds work and calculating payouts is essential for smart betting. Whether you’re using fractional, decimal, or American odds, the principles remain the same: understand the implied probability, calculate your potential return, and look for value. Armed with this knowledge, you’ll have a clearer path to smarter, more strategic wagers.",2024-11-22,0,0.65,0.35

It’s the difference between walking away empty-handed and salvaging some value from your bet, even when things don’t go as planned. But how does it work, and how can you make the most of it? Let’s break it down. First, what is accumulator insurance? At its core, it’s a feature offered by many bookmakers that refunds your stake—usually as a free bet—if one leg of your accumulator fails. For example, imagine you’ve placed a five-leg accumulator. Four of your selections win, but the last one lets you down. Without insurance, that’s game over. With accumulator insurance, you’ll get your stake back to try again, giving you a second chance to strike it big. The appeal is obvious. Accumulators are already high-risk, high-reward bets. Adding insurance reduces some of that risk, giving punters more confidence to go for those juicy payouts. It’s like jumping out of a plane with a backup parachute—sure, it doesn’t guarantee success, but it gives you a lifeline when things go wrong. Now, how do you use accumulator insurance effectively? First, know the rules. Each bookmaker has specific terms for their insurance offers. Most require a minimum number of legs—typically four or five—and a minimum odds threshold for each selection. For instance, your bets might need to be at least 1.5 odds (or 1/2 in fractional terms) to qualify. Be sure to read the fine print before placing your bet; otherwise, you could miss out on the insurance altogether. Accumulator insurance is best suited for mid-sized accumulators. A bet with three legs might not have the payout potential to justify the risk, while an accumulator with 10 legs is a Hail Mary that even insurance might struggle to salvage. Stick to bets with four to six selections for the sweet spot of reasonable risk and significant reward. Consider this scenario: you’ve crafted a five-leg football accumulator with carefully chosen selections. Arsenal to win, Manchester United to draw, over 2.5 goals in a Bayern Munich match, PSG to keep a clean sheet, and Real Madrid to win by a margin of two goals. If all but one of these hits, your accumulator insurance kicks in, giving you back your stake—usually as a free bet. Without it, you’d be kicking yourself over that one misstep. To maximize your use of accumulator insurance, combine it with smart betting strategies. Don’t just throw in random teams to bulk up your bet; research every selection. Look at form, injuries, head-to-head records, and other variables that could sway the outcome. The stronger your picks, the less likely you’ll need the insurance—but it’s always there as a safety net. Another pro tip: be mindful of cash-out offers. Some bookmakers let you cash out on accumulators before the final leg if things are looking dicey. However, using cash-out typically voids your accumulator insurance. Weigh the options carefully—sometimes taking a partial payout is better than relying on insurance, especially if the cash-out value is high. So, is accumulator insurance worth it? Absolutely, especially for punters who love the thrill of big accumulators but hate the frustration of losing everything on one bad result. It’s a feature that rewards the bold while giving you a little breathing room when luck doesn’t go your way. Accumulator insurance doesn’t guarantee wins, but it guarantees a softer landing. And in the chaotic, unpredictable world of betting, that’s a lifeline worth having. Use it wisely, pair it with smart selections, and you’ll give yourself the best shot at turning near-misses into a profitable betting experience.",2024-11-22,0,0.78,0.22
Sports Weez,How to Build a Winning Betting Accumulator Every Time,https://sportsweez.com/betting-accumulator/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 08:47:32 +0000","Winning a betting accumulator is the stuff of dreams, but it’s no stroll in the park.

Building one that lands consistently? That’s like chasing a unicorn on roller skates. Yet, with strategy, patience, and a touch of cunning, you can tilt the odds in your favor and make that elusive win feel less like luck and more like skill. Let’s cut to the chase: an accumulator is a single bet combining multiple outcomes. To win, every selection in your bet must be correct. If even one leg crumbles, your accumulator does too. But the payout? That’s the reason punters keep coming back for more—it’s an Everest of potential winnings compared to the molehill of a single bet. So, how do you craft an accumulator that doesn’t fall apart at the first hurdle? First, don’t let ambition blind you. The temptation to throw in ten or more selections because the odds look tasty is a rookie mistake. Keep it tight. A three- to five-leg accumulator strikes the perfect balance between risk and reward. Think of it like stacking Jenga blocks; the taller the tower, the shakier it gets. Next, stay in your lane. If football is your forte, stick to it. Betting on sports you barely understand is like diving into shark-infested waters with a paper life raft. Know the leagues, the teams, the players, and the dynamics. Dive into stats—head-to-head records, recent form, injuries, and even weather conditions. Yes, a rain-soaked pitch can turn a sure-fire goal fest into a snooze fest. Another golden rule? Bet on markets you understand. Don’t overcomplicate things with obscure bets like “first-half corners” or “to win from behind” unless you’re a seasoned analyst. Simple bets—match winners, over/under goals, or both teams to score (BTTS)—are your bread and butter. They’re predictable, easier to analyze, and less prone to chaotic surprises. Discipline is your best friend. When building an accumulator, you might feel tempted to add “just one more” to crank up the odds. Resist it. Greed is the graveyard of accumulators. If you’re eyeing a decent payout with your current selections, don’t sabotage yourself for the sake of a marginally bigger reward. Timing is everything. Bookmakers release odds early, but they shift as kickoff approaches. Keep an eye on these changes—they often reveal crucial information like team news or shifting public sentiment. If a star striker suddenly sits out due to injury, you’ll be glad you waited before locking in your bet. Let’s talk value. It’s easy to pick heavy favorites and stack them into an accumulator, but this strategy rarely works. Why? The combined odds are often so low that the risk isn’t worth the reward. Instead, focus on teams or outcomes that are undervalued by the bookmakers. Spotting a gem—like an in-form underdog playing at home—is where the real skill lies. Bookmaker features can also tilt things in your favor. Cash-out options allow you to lock in profits if most of your selections have landed but you’re nervous about the final leg. Accumulator insurance is another game-changer. It refunds your stake (as a free bet) if one selection lets you down, softening the sting of near-misses. Here’s an example of a smart accumulator strategy: This approach blends reliability with value without pushing your luck. Finally, let’s address the emotional roller coaster. Accumulators are meant to be fun. You’re chasing a big win, sure, but don’t let losses ruin your day—or your bank account. Never bet more than you can afford to lose. Set limits and stick to them. Winning is thrilling, but the true art of accumulator betting lies in the chase, the calculation, and the adrenaline of watching those results roll in. When you win—and you will win if you play smart—don’t forget to savor it. That victory isn’t just luck. It’s the product of careful planning, solid research, and a sprinkling of good fortune. And there’s no better feeling than seeing all your selections hit and realizing that, for once, the house didn’t win.",2024-11-22,0,0.56,0.44

Picture this: instead of betting on a single outcome, you stack multiple selections into one colossal bet. To win, every single pick in your accumulator needs to come through. Miss just one, and the entire bet is toast. It’s high-risk, high-reward—like trying to balance on a tightrope over a pit of gold. Now, why would anyone take on such a nerve-wracking gamble? Simple: the payouts. Accumulators are the holy grail for punters who dream big. The odds for each selection in the bet are multiplied together, meaning even small stakes can lead to eye-popping returns. Bet £5 on a four-leg accumulator with combined odds of 25/1, and you’re looking at a potential £130 payout. It’s the kind of bet that makes you daydream about that impossible holiday or a shiny new car. But here’s the catch—betting accumulators are a ruthless mistress. You could hit three out of four selections, only for your last one to falter in injury time. Sound familiar? That’s because bookmakers thrive on accumulators. The more legs (or selections) you add, the harder it becomes to win. Each added game introduces another layer of unpredictability, like a Jenga tower teetering closer to collapse. Let’s make it relatable. Imagine you’ve bet on four football matches: Manchester United to win, Arsenal to draw, Real Madrid to score over 2.5 goals, and PSG to win without conceding. If all four happen, you’re laughing all the way to the bank. But if Arsenal’s defense decides to nap and concede a late goal, say goodbye to your payout. You didn’t just lose on Arsenal—you lost it all. This is the bittersweet beauty of the accumulator. So, how do you play the game smartly? First, know your sport. Accumulators work best when you’re confident in your picks. Blindly throwing darts at fixtures is a recipe for heartbreak. Do your homework—check stats, form, injuries, and anything else that gives you an edge. Also, don’t get greedy. Sure, an eight-leg accumulator sounds enticing, but the odds are astronomically against you. Sometimes, a modest three-leg bet is the smarter move. Some bookmakers also offer insurance or cash-out options. Acca insurance means if one leg fails, you might still get your stake back as a free bet. Cash-out lets you claim winnings early if most of your picks are coming through, but you’re nervous about the last game. These features can be lifesavers, especially when your nerves are shot watching that final match unfold. There’s also a psychological side to accumulators. It’s not just about the money—it’s the thrill, the camaraderie of comparing bets with your friends, and the gut-wrenching tension as results roll in. Winning an accumulator is a story you tell for years, a badge of honor in the betting world. Losing, on the other hand, is a humbling lesson in how cruel sports can be. At the heart of it, accumulators are for the bold. They’re not for those looking for steady, consistent wins. But if you’re chasing that moment where everything clicks, where your selections align like stars in a lucky constellation, then accumulators are your playground. Just remember: the house always has the edge, so bet with your head, not over it.",2024-11-22,0,0.66,0.34

[&#8230;]","Sports betting spread, often referred to as the point spread, is one of the most popular and widely used forms of wagering, especially in sports like football and basketball. It’s designed to level the playing field between two teams, giving bettors a more balanced way to wager on games where one team is heavily favored. Whether you’re a beginner or just curious, understanding how spreads work is essential to placing smarter bets. The spread is essentially a margin of victory set by oddsmakers. It assigns a handicap to the favorite (the team expected to win) and an advantage to the underdog (the team expected to lose). Bettors wager on whether a team will “cover the spread,” meaning they either exceed the margin set by the bookmakers (favorites) or stay within it (underdogs). Here’s a classic example: In this scenario: The spread creates an even contest for bettors, no matter how lopsided the matchup might seem. It’s not about which team wins or loses—it’s about the margin of victory or defeat. Understanding spread numbers and symbols is simple once you get the hang of it: For instance, if the spread is set at 7 points: If the spread is a whole number (e.g., 7 instead of 6.5) and the favorite wins by exactly the spread margin, it’s called a push, and your stake is returned. Point spreads are designed to create balanced betting markets. If one team is much stronger than the other, a simple moneyline bet on the favorite would offer little value, while the underdog would seem like a hopeless gamble. By introducing a spread, bookmakers make both sides of the bet more appealing. For example: Betting on the spread is straightforward: The point spread is one of the most exciting ways to bet on sports, as it levels the playing field and makes every game competitive from a betting perspective. By understanding how spreads work and learning to analyze games critically, you can approach spread betting with confidence and improve your chances of success.",2024-11-22,0,0.56,0.44

It’s a sharp, calculated method that leverages discrepancies in odds offered by different bookmakers to ensure you make money no matter the outcome of an event. Sounds like a dream, right? Well, it is—but it’s also a high-stakes game that requires precision, speed, and stealth. At its core, arbing works by exploiting the gaps in odds. Bookmakers, each with their own way of calculating probabilities, occasionally post odds that overlap in a way that creates an arbitrage opportunity. When this happens, you can bet on all possible outcomes of an event across different bookies and secure a profit regardless of the result. It’s not gambling in the traditional sense—it’s mathematics, pure and simple. Here’s a quick example to show how arbing works. Imagine a tennis match between Player A and Player B. One bookmaker offers odds of 2.1 for Player A to win, while another offers odds of 2.2 for Player B. By staking strategically on both outcomes, you ensure that your total payout will exceed your total stake. For instance, if you place £50 on Player A at 2.1 and £47.62 on Player B at 2.2, you’d receive £105 no matter who wins, securing a risk-free profit of £7.38. The key lies in finding and acting on these discrepancies before the odds shift. But here’s the catch: arbing isn’t as simple as sitting back and watching the cash roll in. It requires dedication, quick thinking, and a deep understanding of how odds and markets work. Successful arbers are like digital treasure hunters, constantly scouring betting markets or using specialized arbitrage software to find opportunities before they vanish. These gaps in odds are often fleeting, lasting mere minutes before bookmakers adjust their lines. To get started with arbing, you’ll need accounts with multiple bookmakers, a reliable arbitrage betting calculator, and a bankroll that can withstand large stakes to maximize returns. The more bookmakers you’re registered with, the higher your chances of spotting profitable arbitrage opportunities. It’s also essential to familiarize yourself with betting terms and different odds formats (decimal, fractional, and American), as arbing often requires quick conversions and calculations. But let’s talk about the elephant in the room: why doesn’t everyone arb if it’s so foolproof? The answer lies in the risks and limitations. First, while arbing is theoretically risk-free, real-world execution can be tricky. Odds can shift mid-bet, leaving you exposed. One bookmaker might limit your account, suspecting you of arbing, or cancel a bet outright. Currency conversions, withdrawal fees, and delays can eat into your profits, especially if you’re working across international bookies. Then there’s the time investment. Arbing is not a passive income stream—it’s a grind. You need to monitor markets, act fast, and constantly stay ahead of bookmakers who frown upon this practice. In fact, many bookmakers have systems to detect and restrict arbers, limiting stakes or banning accounts outright. It’s a high-pressure game, and while the profits are real, so are the challenges. For those willing to put in the work, arbing can be incredibly rewarding. It’s not about luck or gut feelings—it’s about logic, analysis, and precision. Every arb you place is like solving a puzzle, a tiny victory in the battle of wits against the bookies. And when done right, the profits can snowball into a consistent, risk-free income stream. If you’re considering trying your hand at arbing, start small. Use free arbitrage calculators available online to practice spotting opportunities. Build a network of bookmaker accounts, diversify your bets, and, above all, stay under the radar. Remember, arbing isn’t illegal, but bookmakers are private businesses, and they can close your account if they suspect you’re playing their game too well. Arbing is not for everyone—it’s a demanding, fast-paced pursuit that rewards the meticulous and the determined. But for those who crack the code, it’s a way to turn the unpredictable world of betting into a science, delivering profits that don’t rely on chance. And in the world of gambling, that’s about as close to magic as it gets.",2024-11-22,0,0.7,0.3

<h1>Chicago Blackhawks Overcome Florida Panthers in Thrilling 3-1 Encounter</h1>
<p>Petr Mrazek's goaltending prowess was on full display as he thwarted 32 shots, while Teuvo Teravainen found the net, paving the way for the <a href=""https://21sports.com/kurashevs-ot-heroics-snap-blackhawks-slump-against-wild/"">Chicago Blackhawks</a> to soar past the <a href=""https://21sports.com/florida-panthers-claw-their-way-to-victory-shutting-out-nhl-leading-winnipeg-jets-5-0/"">Florida Panthers</a> with a 3-1 victory on Thursday evening. Craig Smith and Nick Foligno also inked their names on the scoreboard, enabling Chicago to halt a hat-trick of consecutive losses. This victory also bolstered their home record to 3-5-0 for the season.</p>
<h2>Mrazek's Impressive Return to Lineup</h2>
<p>Mrazek made a triumphant return to the Blackhawks' lineup after sitting out Tuesday's 3-2 defeat to the Panthers due to personal reasons. He was a pivotal force in Chicago's victory, stopping numerous shots with impeccable skill and precision.</p>
<h2>Teravainen's Power-Play Goal Sets the Tone</h2>
<p>Teravainen set the Blackhawks on the path to victory with an early power-play goal, just 2:46 into the opening period. This marked only his second goal in his recent 17 appearances. Smith later doubled the lead, skillfully converting a breakaway into a goal, thanks to Pat Maroon's assist, 10:07 into the second period. This marked Smith's fifth goal for the campaign.</p>
<h3>Reinhart's Lone Goal for Florida</h3>
<p>Sam Reinhart, for the Panthers, managed to net his 15th goal of the season, marking his fourth in the last five games. Despite Florida's efforts to equalize in the final moments, Foligno sealed the deal for the Blackhawks with a decisive empty-netter with just a minute left on the clock.</p>
<h2>Panthers' Missed Opportunities</h2>
<p>Despite a couple of golden opportunities, the Panthers couldn't capitalize, leaving the ice empty-handed. The Stanley Cup champions, with Spencer Knight stopping 17 shots, experienced their fourth loss in five games.</p>
<h2>Blackhawks' Resilient Response</h2>
<p>Blackhawks' coach Luke Richardson was on the lookout for a more spirited performance from his team following their capitulation of a 2-1 lead in the third period against the Ducks. His team did not disappoint, presenting a resilient front, particularly in the game's final stages.</p>
<h3>Key Moment of the Game</h3>
<p>A noteworthy moment of the game came when Blackhawks' defenseman Wyatt Kaiser was benched for delay of game 12:22 into the third period. Despite this setback, the Blackhawks successfully killed off the penalty, rendering the Panthers' power-play opportunities futile.</p>
<h3>Key Statistic</h3>
<p>Foligno boasts an impressive record against Florida, with 10 goals and 14 assists to his name in his career against them.</p>

<h1>St. Louis Blues Snatch Victory from Sharks, Putting an End to Home Losing Streak</h1>
<p>Jake Neighbours emerged as the shootout star, while Jordan Binnington defied all three attempts by the <a href=""https://21sports.com/robertson-shines-bright-as-dallas-stars-overpower-san-jose-sharks/"">San Jose Sharks</a>, leading the <a href=""https://21sports.com/st-louis-blues-triumph-over-tampa-bay-lightning-in-thrilling-ice-showdown/"">St. Louis Blues</a> to a 3-2 triumph on Thursday night. This win ended a four-game home losing streak for the Blues. Binnington displayed resilience by bouncing back from Alexander Wennberg's equalizing goal with only 8.8 seconds remaining, securing his 151st career victory. This tied him with Mike Liut's franchise record.</p>
<h2>Standout Performances</h2>
<p>Wennberg was the lone double-goalscorer for the Sharks, with Mikael Granlund and <a href=""https://21sports.com/macklin-celebrinis-overtime-goal-fuels-san-jose-sharks-victory-over-detroit-red-wings/"">Macklin Celebrini</a>, the 2024 NHL draft's top pick, providing assists for both goals. For the Blues, Jordan Kyrou and Nathan Walker found the back of the net during regulation time. This marked only the second victory in their last nine matches.</p>
<p>Walker's goal came just 11 seconds into the game, thanks to Radek Faksa's interception of a pass from Sharks' goalie Yaroslav Askarov. Later, Kyrou, positioned between Granlund and Timothy Liljegren, nudged home a pass from Pierre-Olivier Joseph for his sixth goal of the season, with 8:13 remaining in the second.</p>
<h2>Goalkeeper Highlights</h2>
<p>Binnington held the fort with 22 saves, contributing significantly to the Blues' victory, while Askarov managed 29 saves.</p>
<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<p>The Sharks, who have been outscored 28-10 in the season's first period, struggled from the onset, despite netting a first-period goal for the third consecutive game. On the other hand, Binnington, with 295 games under his belt, stands second among goalies in Blues' franchise history. He reached the 151-win milestone in 56 fewer games than Liut, whose record from 1979-1985 stood at 151-133, with 52 ties.</p>
<h3>Game-Changing Moment</h3>
<p>Neighbours played the hero, delivering the shootout victory with a wrist shot that outsmarted Askarov on his glove side.</p>
<h3>Key Statistics</h3>
<p>The Blues have been outscored 14-2 in the third period across their last seven games.</p>
<h3>What's Next?</h3>
<p>The Blues are set to play seven out of their next eight games on the road, commencing Saturday against the New York Islanders. The Sharks, on the other hand, will start a four-game homestand against Buffalo the same day.</p>

<h1>Werenski's Overtime Goal Brings Columbus Blue Jackets a Remarkable Comeback Victory</h1>
<p>Zach Werenski's masterstroke at 1:25 of the overtime session marked the climax of a thrilling game as the <a href=""https://21sports.com/los-angeles-kings-emerge-victorious-in-dominant-performance-against-columbus-blue-jackets/"">Columbus Blue Jackets</a> overcame a three-goal deficit to triumph over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/vasilevskiy-shines-with-stellar-saves-as-lightning-strike-devils-4-0/"">Tampa Bay Lightning</a>, in an electrifying 7-6 victory on Thursday night. Werenski, shining in the spotlight, equalized the game at 4 in the second period and contributed with three assists, helping the Blue Jackets secure their second consecutive win.</p>
<h2>Key Players in the Clash</h2>
<p>Sean Monahan and Dmitri Voronkov greatly supported their team with a goal and three assists and a goal plus an assist, respectively. Kent Johnson, returning from an injury hiatus that had sidelined him for 14 games, made his mark with a power play and a short-handed goal. Yegor Chinakhov added another goal to the tally while Elvis Merzlikins showcased his goalkeeping skills by blocking 24 shots.</p>
<p>For the Lightning, Anthony Cirelli, Mitchell Chaffee, Brandon Hagel, and Connor Geekie all performed valiantly, each securing a goal and an assist. <a href=""https://21sports.com/brayden-points-dazzling-return-sparks-lightnings-overtime-triumph-over-penguins/"">Brayden Point</a> and Cam Atkinson also added to the scoresheet, with Nikita Kucherov assisting thrice. Jonas Johansson showed resilience with 36 saves.</p>

<p>The game's pivotal moment was undoubtedly when Tampa Bay, leading by three goals in the first period, found themselves under fire in the second period. Columbus turned the tables, scoring four times and Tampa only twice.</p>
<h3>Notable Stats</h3>
<p>Brayden Point, in his second game after a four-match absence due to a lower-body injury, scored a power-play goal just 23 seconds into a Columbus penalty, at 1:51 of the first period. Point has now netted three times in two games, tying with Nikita Kucherov for the team lead with 11.</p>

<h1>Colorado Avalanche Triumphs Over Washington Capitals in Nail-Biting Encounter</h1>
<h2>Miles Wood Fires Avalanche to Victory</h2>
<p>In an electrifying Thursday night showdown, Colorado Avalanche clinched a tight 2-1 win over <a href=""https://21sports.com/capitals-dominate-avalanche-in-thrilling-5-2-victory-a-night-of-twists-and-triumphs/"">Washington Capitals</a>, with Miles Wood playing the hero as his third-period goal became the decider. Mikko Rantanen, another Avalanche star, also found the net, marking the team's fifth victory in their last six outings.</p>
<h2>Alexandar Georgiev Continues Winning Streak</h2>
<p>Alexandar Georgiev, the formidable Avalanche goaltender, demonstrated his mettle with an awe-inspiring performance that saw him repel 29 shots. This marked his fourth consecutive win after returning from an upper-body injury that sidelined him for two games.</p>
<h2>Capitals Feel the Absence of Ovechkin</h2>
<p>For the Capitals, it was Pierre-Luc Dubois who scored, but the team's winning spree came to an abrupt end, halting at three victories. Logan Thompson, the Capitals goalkeeper, experienced his maiden regulation loss of the season with 25 saves. Earlier, the team was dealt a significant blow as Alex Ovechkin, their superstar, was ruled out for four to six weeks due to a broken left fibula, sustained during their Monday clash against Utah.</p>
<h3>Avalanche's Takeaways</h3>
<p>Despite Nathan MacKinnon failing to score for the second time in three games — both against the Capitals — Rantanen maintained his impressive form, securing points in five of his last six games.</p>
<h3>Capitals' Takeaways</h3>
<p>Without Ovechkin's presence, the Capitals found it difficult to generate momentum offensively. Their usually effective power play, often energized by their captain, went 0 for 2.</p>
<h2>Key Moment of the Match</h2>
<p>The defining moment came just 3:29 into the third period when Wood, positioned at the front of the net, deflected Cale Makar's point shot, sending it past Thompson for the lead.</p>
<h2>Crucial Statistic</h2>
<p>A telling statistic dating back to the 2021-22 season reveals that the Capitals have a dismal 4-14 record without <a href=""https://21sports.com/ovechkins-decisive-strike-propels-capitals-to-victory-over-predators/"">Ovechkin</a> in the team. At the time of his injury, the captain was leading the league with 15 goals, only 27 short of Wayne Gretzky's record.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>The Avalanche is set to square off against the reigning Stanley Cup champions, Florida, on Saturday, while the Capitals will host New Jersey.</p>

<h1>Golden Knights Prevail Over Senators in Hard-Fought Match</h1>
<p>In a hockey game that kept fans on the edge of their seats, the Vegas Golden Knights claimed victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/tkachuks-overtime-magic-propels-senators-to-victory-over-bruins/"">Ottawa Senators</a> with a nail-biting 3-2 score on Thursday night. Ilya Samsonov, who had let in 10 goals over his last two games, bounced back with a remarkable performance, pulling off 38 saves.</p>
<h2>Samsonov's Key Saves Halt Senators' Attack</h2>
<p>Despite the Senators' aggressive play, Samsonov held strong, making crucial saves against formidable players like Josh Norris, David Perron, Tim Stutzle, and Brady Tkachuk. The Senators (8-10-1) find themselves trapped in a four-game losing streak, having scored just two goals throughout their last three games.</p>
<h2>Golden Knights Gain the Upper Hand</h2>
<p>In the initial phase of the game, the Golden Knights (12-6-2) seized control when Linus Ullmark made a spectacular diving save but failed to reposition quickly enough. This left Jack Eichel with an unhindered shot to the net, marking his sixth goal this season. Brett Howden extended their lead to 2-0 in the mid-second period, slipping a goal past Ullmark, who had 29 saves in the game.</p>
<h3>Sensational Third-Period Action</h3>
<p>Adam Gaudette managed to get one past Samsonov 7:17 into the third period, narrowing the lead. However, the Senators' joy was short-lived as Pavel Dorofeyev restored the two-goal lead just two minutes later. Drake Batherson kept the Senators' hopes alive, scoring a goal off a Jake Sanderson rebound with a little over seven minutes left. Despite the Senators outshooting the Golden Knights 18-5 in the third period, they fell short of a comeback.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways and Statistics</h2>
<p>A recurring issue for the Senators has been their habit of conceding the first goal, which has led to eight consecutive losses and a dismal 1-9-1 record when they let in the first goal. On the other hand, the Golden Knights capitalized on an ill-timed Ottawa line change, delivering a swift counter-strike leading to Howden's goal. The Golden Knights have an impressive 12-1-1 track record against the Senators since their entry into the league in 2017.</p>
<h3>What's Next for Both Teams?</h3>
<p>Looking ahead, the Senators are gearing up to host the Vancouver Canucks on Saturday night, while the Golden Knights prepare to face off against the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday afternoon.</p>

A recurring issue for the Senators has been their habit of conceding the first goal, which has led to eight consecutive losses and a dismal 1-9-1 record when they let in the first goal. On the other hand, the Golden Knights capitalized on an ill-timed Ottawa line change, delivering a swift counter-strike leading to Howden’s goal. The Golden Knights have an impressive 12-1-1 track record against the Senators since their entry into the league in 2017. Looking ahead, the Senators are gearing up to host the Vancouver Canucks on Saturday night, while the Golden Knights prepare to face off against the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday afternoon.

<h2>Jesper Bratt's Stellar Performance</h2>
<p>Jesper Bratt emerged as the star of the night, scoring twice and assisting another, aiding the <a href=""https://21sports.com/devils-break-panthers-winning-streak-in-nhl-showdown/"">New Jersey Devils</a> in their 4-2 victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/necas-last-minute-heroics-propel-hurricanes-to-seventh-consecutive-victory-over-persistent-flyers/"">Carolina Hurricanes</a> on Thursday. The match saw an impressive display from Devils' defenseman Dougie Hamilton, who seized the lead for the team, 3-2, with just 9:25 left on the clock. This happened after Carolina's Andrei Svechnikov evened the score 12 seconds into the final period.</p>
<p>Bratt managed his tenth goal of the season and his second in the game during a power play, which happened with 5:55 left on the clock. This goal marked the fourth for the Devils. The opening score for Carolina came from Jack Roslovic at 8:43 into the first, but Bratt quickly evened it out with 5:15 remaining in the same period.</p>
<h2>Highlights and Key Players</h2>
<p>Stefan Noesen pushed New Jersey ahead at the beginning of the second period, scoring a power-play goal just 46 seconds into the period. Roslovic, who only managed nine goals in 59 games last season, has significantly improved his performance with 11 goals in 19 games for the Hurricanes.</p>
<p>The Devils' victory was also supported by Jacob Markstrom's 20 saves, while Spencer Martin of the Hurricanes managed 17.</p>
<h2>New Jersey's Takeaways and Carolina's Setback</h2>
<p>Jack Hughes, with three assists under his belt, maintained his robust performance for New Jersey. He is currently second on the team with 25 points, including eight goals.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Hurricanes announced on the same day that veteran goaltender Frederik Andersen is scheduled for knee surgery and will be absent for the next eight to 12 weeks. Andersen, with a record of 3-1-0 this season, will be sorely missed, as Martin fell to a 1-2-0 record.</p>
<h3>Crucial Moments and Stats</h3>
<p>A key moment in the game was when Markstrom denied all seven shots aimed by Carolina in the second period, maintaining it as a one-goal contest. The Devils showed their home prowess with a record of 5-3-2, and an impressive 8-4-0 on the road.</p>
<h3>What's Next?</h3>
<p>The Devils are scheduled to face the Washington Capitals on Saturday, while the Hurricanes will be visiting the Columbus Blue Jackets on the same day.</p>

<h1>A Nail-biting Victory for Detroit Red Wings against New York Islanders</h1>
<p>In a thrilling showdown, <a href=""https://21sports.com/lucas-raymond-inks-lucrative-eight-year-contract-with-detroit-red-wings/"">Lucas Raymond</a>'s incredible goal in the final seconds helped the Detroit Red Wings to a 2-1 victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/islanders-thrilling-rally-overcoming-penguins-in-post-regulation-showdown/"">New York Islanders</a> on Thursday evening. Jonatan Berggren's crucial equalizer also played a pivotal role in breaking Detroit's run of three consecutive losses. The Red Wings' goaltender, Alex Lyon, displayed a remarkable performance with 22 saves.</p>
<p>For the Islanders, the only ray of hope came from Simon Holmstrom, who managed to score the sole goal for his team, unable to reverse their pattern of losses with five out of their last six games ending in defeat. Despite a valiant effort with 29 saves, Islanders' goalie Ilya Sorokin couldn't prevent the defeat.</p>
<h2>The Turning Points of the Game</h2>
<p>Holmstrom sparked the Islanders' spirits by scoring the first goal of the match at 5:51 of the first period, marking his third goal of the season. However, Berggren, with just 4:46 left in the game, managed to level the score with his third goal of the season. The decisive moment came when Raymond, with a skillful assist from Dylan Larkin, netted the puck from the left circle, beating Sorokin's glove with just 51 seconds to spare.</p>
<h3>Key Takeaways from the Game</h3>
<p>The Islanders, despite having the league's worst penalty-kill entering the game, successfully thwarted three power plays from the Red Wings, who boast the second-best power play in the league. Sorokin was instrumental in this, making six crucial saves.</p>
<p>In contrast, Raymond, who had an impressive tally of 31 goals last season, ended his scoring drought with a game-winning goal in the final minute, providing a much-needed boost to the Red Wings.</p>
<h2>Flashback and Key Statistics</h2>
<p>Recalling the teams' first encounter last month, which saw the Red Wings triumph with a 1-0 victory thanks to Patrick Kane's first-period goal, it seemed history might repeat itself with Holmstrom's early goal. However, the Red Wings turned the tide with two goals in the final five minutes of the game.</p>
<p>A noteworthy stat from the game revolves around the Red Wings' knack for comebacks last season, boasting an 11-24-3 record when trailing after two periods. This season, however, they had a 0-8-0 record when down after two periods, a statistic they managed to overturn with their late rally in this game.</p>
<h3>What's Next for the Teams?</h3>
<p>Looking forward, the Islanders will be hosting St. Louis on Saturday, while the Red Wings will welcome Boston to their home ground.</p>

21Sports.com,Nick Chubb’s Heroic Comeback Powers Browns to Break Steelers’ Winning Streak,https://21sports.com/nick-chubbs-heroic-comeback-powers-browns-to-break-steelers-winning-streak/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 08:31:04 +0000","<p><img alt=""Pittsburgh Steelers"" class=""attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image"" height=""504"" src=""https://21sports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pittsburgh-Steelers.jpg"" width=""800"" /></p>
<h1>Nick Chubb Spearheads Cleveland Browns' Victory Over Pittsburgh Steelers</h1>
<p>In an intense blizzard, Nick Chubb drove his team forward, replicating the play that almost ended his career in Pittsburgh last year. Chubb's perseverance paid off with a memorable touchdown, the highlight of a game his teammates will cherish. In the dying seconds of the game, Chubb powered through for a 2-yard touchdown, leading the Cleveland Browns to a triumphant 24-19 victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/steelers-snatch-victory-from-commanders-with-wilsons-late-game-heroics/"">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> on Thursday night. This victory snapped the Steelers' five-game winning spree.</p>
<h2>Chubb's Redemption Against the Steelers</h2>
<p>Chubb's electrifying performance came in his first encounter with the AFC North leaders, the Steelers (8-3), since suffering a season-ending left knee injury in a Monday night game against the same team in Week 2 last September. After a difficult rehab and a similar knee injury in 2015, Chubb's return to the field and scoring against the Steelers was a poetic moment.</p>
<h3>Myles Garrett's Praise for Chubb</h3>
<p><a href=""https://21sports.com/cleveland-browns-myles-garrett-battles-double-foot-injury-a-look-into-his-determination-and-future-prospects/"">Myles Garrett</a>, who made three impressive sacks, expressed his admiration for Chubb, “It meant a lot to me. I know it means a lot to him,” said Garrett. ""His resilience and his comeback in this game truly exemplify the kind of man he is. We absolutely love him.”</p>
<p>In the second quarter, Chubb had scored another 2-yard run. The Browns (3-8) managed to recover from blowing a 12-point lead in the fourth quarter and being down 19-18. With 3:22 left on the clock, the Browns got a chance when Pittsburgh punter Corliss Waitman made a 16-yard blunder.</p>
<h2>The Snowy Showdown</h2>
<p>In the midst of accumulating snow, Jameis Winston of the Browns completed a crucial third-down pass to Jerry Jeudy, reaching the Pittsburgh 9. Two plays later, it was Chubb who bulldozed his way into the end zone.</p>
<p>The Steelers had one last opportunity, but their Hail Mary on the final play was deflected by Browns safety Grant Delpit, triggering euphoria at Huntington Bank Field. This win against the Steelers provided some relief for coach Kevin Stefanski in a tough season and gave Browns fans a reason to celebrate.</p>
<h3>Victory Amidst the Snowstorm</h3>
<p>With a snowstorm transforming the field into a white canvas, the Steelers managed to wipe out an 18-6 deficit, scoring two touchdowns in a little over a minute. However, the Browns rallied back to secure their second divisional win after defeating the Ravens last month.</p>
<h3>Garrett's Outstanding Performance</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, Myles Garrett outshone Steelers star T.J. Watt in a dominant display, including a crucial strip-sack of Wilson. This performance came after Garrett made comments about Watt's apparent snub when Garrett was awarded the Defensive Player of the Year over him last season.</p>
<h2>Up Next</h2>
<p>The Steelers will face the Cincinnati Bengals on Dec. 1, while the Browns are scheduled to take on the Denver Broncos on Dec. 3.</p>

Martin Truex Jr. may have retired as a full-time Cup Series competitor, but his journey as a racing driver is far from over. The former Joe Gibbs Racing veteran recently clarified that he intends to compete in the 2025 Daytona 500, even though it won’t be under the 23XI Racing banner. Having competed at NASCAR’s highest level for two decades, the 44-year-old is looking to get some well-earned rest, while keeping his passion for racing alive with one-off appearances. Besides wanting to be involved in the 2024 Cup Series season opener, Truex Jr. is interested in competing in the Xfinity Series as well. A trip to the grassroots is also within the realm of possibility, as the New Jersey native wants to participate in his home track race at the Wall Stadium as well, which hosts the Turkey Derby on Thanksgiving every year. While the veteran driver won’t miss being on the road for the majority of the year after retirement, living life away from the fast lane for too long isn’t a possibility the 2017 championship winner wants to consider at the moment. Appearing to be in good spirits at the 2024 NASCAR Awards, Martin Truex Jr. was asked if he was enjoying his retirement from full-time racing. The 44-year-old responded by saying, “Yeah, I do. I feel great. I’m happy and excited about the future. Still get to race a little bit as well. I don’t know if I’ll ever stop racing of some sort. Just very thankful, proud, and happy. Proud of a lot of things we’ve been able to do over the years. It’s been great.”  Let the world know your perspective.

Smoothie King Center. Mandatory Credit: Stephen Lew-Imagn Images Debate Has Zion Williamson become the NBA's biggest letdown, or is there still hope for his comeback? Zion Williamson, once touted as a generational talent, has found himself at the center of fan backlash after a video of him getting a back tattoo went viral. While tattoos are far from controversial, the timing and context of this clip have enraged fans. With Zion’s fitness and availability for the Pelicans already under scrutiny, the sight of him appearing out of shape—with a noticeable belly—has only fueled frustrations. Many expected him to be laser-focused on rehabbing and conditioning to make a strong return, but instead, this clip has reignited debates about his priorities and long-term potential in the NBA. Adding to fans’ discontent, Zion’s return to action seems far from imminent. According to ESPN’s Shams Charania, the Pelicans star is “not close to a return” as he continues to deal with a hamstring injury. Williamson initially suffered the strain in a Nov. 6 loss to the Cavaliers after missing two games prior due to hamstring tightness. The Pelicans later announced he was out “indefinitely.” Charania further reports that he will be sidelined for an extended period. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad With Zion already missing seven games since the injury, New Orleans has struggled, going just 1-6 without their two-time All-Star forward. Needless to say, this uncertainty surrounding Williamson’s recovery timeline has only compounded fan frustrations. One comment captured the growing sentiment: “At this point, does anyone really care? His career has been one of the most disappointing from what he was projected to be, and the NBA has moved on from him just like they did from Ja Morant. The 30 for 30 on their careers will be sad.”   At this point does anyone really care

The announcement of Joe Gibbs Racing’s (JGR) crew lineup for the 2025 season has sparked a wave of intrigue in NASCAR. In place of Chris Gabehart, Denny Hamlin will have a new crew chief Chris Gayle, who has been with JGR since 2005. JGR’s four teams will be overseen by Gabehart, who will be promoted to competition director. The news stunned Hamlin, who confessed to being “shocked”. Nevertheless, his response came amid a season of challenges for JGR. Hamlin, who did not request the change, will need time to adjust. As he spoke to reporters at the Charlotte Convention Center during the NASCAR awards ceremony, he appeared to be processing the unexpected announcement. The team has not yet revealed who will take over the No. 54 team, Gayle’s former position with JGR. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad After Ty Gibbs‘ former crew chief was moved to Denny Hamlin’s No. 11 team on Friday, Gibbs spoke about the changes at Joe Gibbs Racing (JGR). Additionally, JGR announced that Hamlin’s crew chief, Chris Gabehart, would be promoted to Competition Director. There is no crew chief on the No. 54 team right now, but the team intends to add one in the near future. Gibbs admitted to Fox Sports’ Bob Pockrass that he “hit a plateau” after working with Gayle and talked about the shift. “We hit a plateau for sure, but I don’t think nothing was off. I think that we still have a great relationship, and we’ve worked really hard this year, and I know they’ve worked extremely hard,” Gibbs said.   Ty Gibbs on whether he and crew chief Chris Gayle hit a plateau. Gayle will move to crew chief Denny Hamlin next year while Hamlin crew chief Chris Gabehart moves to competition director. A crew chief for Gibbs has not been determined. pic.twitter.com/Dd2k4IsHBs — Bob Pockrass (@bobpockrass) November 22, 2024 Expand Tweet  Gibbs finished 15th in the final standings after his second season in the Cup Series with 12 top-10 finishes and 8 top-five finishes. As well as the Coca-Cola 600 and Pocono, he won two pole positions this year. While keeping in account that the team put in a lot of effort, the 22-year-old pointed out the fact that changes are a natural part of the process.  Can Denny Hamlin thrive with a new crew chief, or is this change a risky gamble? Debate He added, “I think stuff changes. I think my grandfather won three Super Bowls with three different quarterbacks, so I think stuff changes, and it’s healthy. I think that it will work its way when Gabehart is going to go do this deal, so I’m hopefully excited for the future, and hopefully, we run really great next year in one of our races.”  For those unaware, Joe Gibbs won three Super Bowls with the Washington Commanders as their head coach! The 83-year-old was the coach of the team between 1981 and 1992 and won titles in 1982,1987 and 1991. He had a second stint on the team in the early 2000s, which was not as glittering as his first stint, but he did make the playoffs twice. This was more playoff appearances for the team than they had in the time between his two stints! He left the team once again in 2008, citing family obligations.  With his plethora of leadership experience, no one would dare to question Joe Gibbs’s decisions, and rather, people treat them with the utmost trust. Despite the tumultuous season for Joe Gibbs Racing, the future is looking up with changes being made. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Joe Gibbs Racing had a tough season in 2024. All of their drivers failed to make it to the Championship 4, and they went 18 races without a win. Ty Gibbs‘ grandfather had his own input on the recent changes at JGR. Ty Gibbs’ former chief, Chris Gayle, led JGR’s Xfinity team to 10 wins in 2021. As a result of moving Chris Gabehart to a new role and adding Gayle to the No. 11 team, JGR will be stronger for next season, according to team owner Joe Gibbs. Gibbs also said, “While we are still in the process of finalizing the new crew chief for the 54 team, we believe all these moves ultimately make our team stronger as we prepare for 2025.” Gibbs won the Xfinity championship in 2022 with Gayle as his crew chief, and they moved to the Cup Series in 2023. In their first playoff appearance this year, the team reached the Round of 16 but was eliminated. JGR’s competitive standing could be reshaped by Gayle’s move to Hamlin’s team as part of a broader shake-up. It is hoped that this change will rejuvenate the team and address the issues that prevented them from finding the victory lane in the latter part of 2024.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Ty Gibbs has been open about his own progress, but he has also been optimistic about JGR’s changes. As he steps into a new chapter of his career, he remains confident. And as the 2025 season approaches, all eyes will be on JGR. Like his grandfather’s football dynasty, Ty Gibbs believes success can come even after transition and reinvention. Despite its abruptness, the shake-up at Joe Gibbs Racing may make one of NASCAR’s most storied organizations more competitive.  Let the world know your perspective.

NASCAR perhaps is one of the most misunderstood sports of all time. For the most part, people believe that NASCAR drivers either have to be rich or backed by a racing family to make it into the premier division of stock car racing. Basically, from an established American household or a family. While this might be true for the drivers who do end up finding a spot on the field on the weekends, this notion isn’t entirely true. Here’s a look at prominent NASCAR stars who have had a successful career despite sharing non-American cultural roots. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Hendrick Motorsports star Kyle Larson is arguably the face of NASCAR racing in the modern era. While he has yet to reach the heights of legendary drivers like Dale Earnhardt, Jeff Gordon, or Jimmie Johnson, he certainly is on the right path. Having bagged a Cup Series title and notched up race wins for fun, Larson is one of those gems who seems to be cut out, especially for racing. But did you know, apart from being the poster boy for NASCAR, the Elk Grove native also happens to be Japanese American? Now do not bombard his social media feed with questions in Japanese, as he can’t speak a word of it. Larson’s Japanese roots can be traced to his mother, Janet. During World War II, her parents spent time in a Japanese internment camp. Although the driver doesn’t speak about it much, he certainly has helped diversify the sport since his arrival. “I do feel like I’m making some sort of an impact. I’ve noticed more Aisnas at the racetracks these days than when I started.” Unlike the majority of NASCAR drivers in the modern era, Kyle Larson came from a working household, and his racecraft, skill, and dedication towards his craft have helped him garner all the love and support he enjoys today. via Imago NORTH WILKESBORO, NC – MAY 21: Kyle Larson 5 Hendrick Motorsports HendrickCars.com Chevrolet celebrates after winning the NASCAR, Motorsport, USA Cup Series All-Star Race on May 21, 2023 at North Wilkesboro Speedway in North Wilkesboro, NC.

Debate Next in line, we have our very own amigo of NASCAR, Daniel Suarez. He is the first Mexican-born driver to win a NASCAR National Series championship. While NASCAR fans have taken their time to completely welcome him to the sport, he is now a household name. Breaking on the Cup Series stage, he doesn’t shy away from his Mexican roots as he smashes a taco piñata after his race wins. He has driven his way up to the Cup Series level and is now a seasoned driver representing Trackhouse Racing in the No. 99 car. “I sincerely feel very proud and happy to be in this position, representing Latin America in the great sport of NASCAR. It’s a great honor to be a Mexican in the top category of NASCAR. It has been a long journey, but I am very happy and proud to be in this position.” Suarez said this while speaking to Hola. It has to be noted that Suarez was confirmed as a U.S. citizen this year. So now, he’s not only Amigo but also a Cowboy, and that certainly has a nice ring to it. USA Today via Reuters Feb 16, 2022; Daytona, FL, USA; NASCAR Cup Series driver Daniel Suarez (99) during qualifying for the Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway. Mandatory Credit: Mike Dinovo-USA TODAY Sports Brad Keselowski is one of the most respected NASCAR drivers in the Cup garage. He is one of the rare breed of drivers who not only excelled as a racer but also as a team owner. While a lot has changed in the sport, Keselowski has always stuck by Ford and has been loyal to their race program. As it turns out, it’s something that runs with his family, and it started when his grandfather migrated to the United States in the hopes of finding a job at a Ford factory. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The veteran driver took a stroll down memory lane while speaking with Stapleton42 and revealed his family’s background. “My family, obviously a Polish descent family, immigrated and came here to work for Henry Ford. That’s how they got to the Detroit area, and Rochester Hills is a suburb of Detroit. World War II broke out, some different things happened, and they actually moved up here to the suburbs because my grandfather was a drill bit maker.” Now, Brad’s father was a racer, which saw him gravitate towards the love for race cars. A young Brad Keselowski would often spend time helping his father at the garage. Moreover, being exposed to NASCAR racing further sparked his desire to follow in his father’s footsteps. He even vividly remembers watching the 1992 championship race. “We had one chair, a couch, and a little bit of floor space. My spot was on the floor, right in front of the TV. I remember watching the ’92 championship race right there on that floor.” via Imago Image Credits: Imago It is fair to say that Brad Keselowski exceeded expectations throughout his racing career.

When Martin Truex Jr. announced he was stepping away from full-time NASCAR racing at the end of 2024, most fans assumed he’d swap race tracks for fishing spots and hunting trails. After all, the 2017 Cup Series champion seemed ready to trade high-speed turns for a slower-paced life filled with hobbies and relaxation. But it turns out Truex isn’t quite ready to let go of the driver’s seat—at least not entirely. One race has always eluded him: the Daytona 500. Even with a Cup championship and countless wins to his name, Truex has never claimed the sport’s most iconic trophy. With MTJ receiving an open offer from 23XI Racing for the Daytona 500, most fans expected the NASCAR veteran to take up the team’s Camry. Sounds like a plan, right? Not so fast. Truex just threw a curveball into those expectations—and it’s a big one. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Back in June, when Martin Truex Jr. announced his retirement plans, the  NASCAR world watched in shock. One of their favorite drivers would no longer continue to entertain them. However, Martin Truex Jr. gave them a sense of hope with an additional detail. He’d be looking to return just for the Daytona 500. It’s not strange for NASCAR drivers to return for specific races, and for MTJ, it was the track he never won at. At the time, his teammate Denny Hamlin immediately chimed in, offering Truex Jr a seat for the race if he ever wanted to participate. Hamlin was all-in on the idea, saying, “Any time that Martin gets bored and wants to run Cup, we would have a seat for him for sure.” Denny Hamlin has made similar offers to other drivers as well in the past. During one episode of his Actions Detrimental podcast, he even offered up the seat to NASCAR legend Carl Edwards, who later turned it down. With Denny Hamlin‘s energy about Martin Truex Jr. potentially driving for the team, things looked set to make the duo come together in 2025. In a surprising turn, Truex revealed that his 2025 Daytona 500 appearance won’t be with 23XI Racing after all. Instead, he’s sticking with familiar territory: Joe Gibbs Racing (JGR), the team where he spent the last stretch of his full-time career. So, what happened to the 23XI plan? Truex casually addressed it in a recent interview, saying, “Uh, no, it’s not [with 23XI]. Yeah, I’m not sure what they’re doing, honestly. It’s still up in the air. JGR’s doing it somehow. So we’ll see.” .@MartinTruex_Jr confirms that his upcoming Daytona 500 ride will not be with 23XI Racing. “I was told JGR’s doing it somehow, so we’ll see…”#NASCAR pic.twitter.com/KGlsbufPu9 — Peter Stratta (@peterstratta) November 22, 2024 Expand Tweet Truex sticking with JGR for Daytona 500—smart move or missed opportunity with 23XI Racing? Debate  While the exact reasoning behind the switch is unclear, the move feels right for Truex. At the moment, 23XI’s biggest priority will be to find themselves on stable ground in their ongoing lawsuit. NASCAR recently changed the wording of regulations that allowed 23XI Racing and FRM to run as open teams for 2025. However, the big problem for 23XI is the approval of Tony Stewart’s charter sale. Without it, they won’t be able to field Riley Herbst in the #35 car. Perhaps, fans will have some clarity on what happens to the MTJ-Hamlin collaboration when the dust of the lawsuit against NASCAR settles. He’s had an impressive run with Joe Gibbs Racing, winning races, competing for championships, and solidifying himself as a key figure in the team’s history. Reflecting on his time with JGR, Truex couldn’t say enough good things about the organization. “It was great, honestly. Just to be part of such a professional race team with so many smart people working hard to be the best,” he said. “Joe [Gibbs] has a high demand for performance, and he gets the best out of everyone. It’s a fun environment to race in.” With JGR by his side, Truex’s Daytona 500 attempt feels less like a nostalgic one-off and more like a calculated effort to chase that one big win still missing from his trophy case. But Daytona isn’t the only thing on his to-do list. Truex isn’t just dipping his toes back into the Cup Series—he’s also gearing up for some part-time racing in the Xfinity Series, where his NASCAR journey began. And for Martin Truex Jr., this isn’t about proving anything; it’s about having fun with a style of racing he genuinely enjoys. “I’m going to do the Daytona 500, and then I’m looking forward to racing some Xfinity cars just to have fun and see how it goes. I really enjoy that style of car—the low downforce. It’s like the older cars we used to race,” he shared. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Unlike the grueling demands of a full-time Cup Series schedule, Xfinity offers Truex the chance to enjoy the sport on his terms. This is a big factor, considering Martin Truex Jr. made the retirement decision because of NASCAR’s grueling schedule and not being able to spend enough time with his loved ones. He hasn’t picked specific tracks yet—“I don’t even know where they’re going,” he admitted with a laugh—but he’s excited about the possibilities. Beyond racing, Truex is ready to dive into hobbies he’s had to put on hold during his full-time career. “I’ve got a lot of hobbies, and I need to catch up on those. I’m excited about that,” he said. Whether it’s fishing, hunting, or just enjoying some well-earned downtime, Truex seems determined to strike a balance between life on the track and life off it. Fishing in particular strikes a chord for MTJ. During his childhood, Martin Truex Jr. grew up on the shores of New Jersey fishing. His father, Martin Truex Sr., a Busch North Series racer, owned a fishing company named Sea Watch International. It was only natural for Truex Jr. to develop fishing as one of his relaxing habits away from the high-stakes world of NASCAR. In fact, he once shared his biggest catch ever in 2019. It was a 570 lb bluefin tuna. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Fans certainly hope Martin Truex Jr. gets plenty of rest before the 2025 season gets underway. Who knows, after the Daytona 500, he may just have enough spark left to enter another race!  Let the world know your perspective.

Not many days have gone since the frenzied ‘Fire Billy Napier’ cry has settled down a bit. The Florida Gators’ coach started the regular college football season on a pretty lackluster note, garnering a lot of flakes from the outside. As a 20-33 loss to Texas A&M hit the breaking point in Week 3, netizens made a petition to replace him right then. But somehow, the Gators’ coach survived the backlash but couldn’t get better. The stacks kept on getting worse as the weeks passed. They are out of the playoff conversation after facing three consecutive losses. As they are now gearing up for the Week 13 clash against the Rebels, a win can do much more than just silence the anti-Napier campaign in Gainesville. Florida and Ole Miss players will butt heads on the Swamp this weekend, for the Rebels want to secure their trip to Atlanta, and the Gators look to play a spoiler on their big fat hope. But the real rivalry will pan out between the coaches. Lane Kiffin, 49, has widely been rumored as an ideal Gators’ fit if and when they replace Napier. If Gators can hand a clean defeat to Kiffin’s Ole Miss, it would be quite an answer to those who compared and vouched for Kiffin’s Florida connection. Gary Condron our biggest booster open to Kiffin as UF head coach 👀 hopefully the bull gators get on board and force the admin’s hand here that would be great. Some won’t like that hire but he’s what UF needs. Hire elite recruiters around him and we can be elite. pic.twitter.com/MIe0bJg1VY — Flagship of Florida 🏴‍☠️😎 (@whynotflorida) September 1, 2024 Expand Tweet ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad ”The chaos scenario is that Florida gets to take down the coach who everyone wants to replace Billy Napier. I mean, it wasn’t that long ago that Florida fans were totally out on the Billy Napier era, and they just had little heart eyes looking at Lane Kiffin, but then they would leave the swamp. If Florida is able to pull off this upset victory, they will leave the swamp with immaculate vibes because you think you’ve got the right coach, you think you’ve got the right quarterback and you were just able to show to that head coach over there at Ole Miss that being at Ole Miss ain’t like being in Florida,” said CBS Sports Chip Patterson. There is a legitimate chance that Florida will get their flowers at the Swamp. Firstly, the win over LSU broke their long-standing losing spree and revitalized the entire team. Thanks to DJ Lagway’s heroic injury comeback. As an insider revealed, Lagway isn’t likely to let his hurt hamstring get in the way of his team’s good going anymore. The kid will play with an apparatus that will work as an extra muscle to allow him to move comfortably. Can Billy Napier silence critics by outsmarting Lane Kiffin, or is it too late for redemption? Debate Red zone for Lane Kiffin and Ole Miss! They must turn to some unique masterstroke to stop Lagway; otherwise, it’s going to be Lagway’s game and coach Napier’s very personal victory over Lane Kiffin. That said, on the flip side of the story, Kiffin doesn’t really look to come to Gainesville at all. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Lane Kiffin has been at the helm of Ole Miss football since 2020. Apart from the professional ties, he developed strong bonds with all the players out there. He knows how they function, what they need to flourish, and more. It’s more than being a head coach. Kiffin’s harmonious stewardship with the Rebels sits pretty well with the fans and veterans alike as well. His records have also been pretty decent so far. So, there is no single reason for the veteran coach to switch teams now. He sees all the vehement Florida coach narratives and doesn’t bother to pay heed. But in a passive stance, Kiffin plain sells his loyalty to the Rebels. After Ole Miss’s mid-season victory against Wake Forest, fans flocked to hype it up on X. As a part of his active fan-engagement practices, The Rebels’ coach shortlisted a few tweets to reply. In a reply to one tweet, Kiffin reminisced about a similar win by his late father, Monte Kiffin, on the same ground back in 1981. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The HC genuinely connects with his present job in more than one way. He recently expressed how he wanted a safety net for Ole Miss by not qualifying for the death trap at Atlanta if he could. All these denote a single thing: Lane Kiffin belongs to Ole Miss, with or without Billy Napier giving him an answer.  Let the world know your perspective.

And no, we are not talking about the 8-2 and 5-5 run. With the season almost reaching the “finale”, recruitments have been all over the place. Somewhere, every CFB fan knew this would happen. The 2025 class recruitment is almost over, so it makes sense that we will see some flips and some decommitts. However, there is a much bigger change unfolding behind the scenes. See, back in the Nick Saban era, recruitment used to be simple. The powerhouses got most of the good players because of the reputation they had. Now? Well, if you want the best of the best, you throw in that good NIL money and you have it all. And that is kind of the case with Julian Lewis and Bryce Underwood. Back on The Pat McAfee Show, Nick Saban pointed out something important. “Well, I’m not sure if the system is great for development of players, but you certainly cannot blame the players for choosing the school for both reasons that you just said,” Saban pointed out. At the core, pursuing players with this entire “pay for play” model is not exactly sustainable. We all know what happened with the entire Jaden Rashada and Billy Napier lawsuit. So, there is always a potential risk. However, at the same time, Lewis and Underwood flipped for 2 specific reasons; Somewhere they can play but also garner a lot of wealth. And this mindset, in a nutshell, is modern recruitment for you.   ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Bryce Underwood and Julian Lewis GOT A BAG to flip their commitments to their new schools. 👀 pic.twitter.com/eKOo3e1xUg — Bookit Sports (@BookitHQ) November 22, 2024 Expand Tweet  For Lewis, while no NIL amount has been disclosed yet, we all know very well that playing for Deion Sanders comes with the added advantage of media fame, which in turn allows you to harness the brands and use them to build your future. And for Underwood? We all know that Michigan has offered around $10.5 million NIL for the flip. Even when Underwood flexed on the people with that custom $15k LSU chain, somewhere the huge NIL amount managed to tip the scales and land the Wolverines on the top QB of the 2025 class. Now, is this a bad thing? “It is certainly the best model for these guys to take advantage of right now because it is the ruse,” Saban points out. This does help Juju and Underwood secure a future which they problem won’t be able to do without the NIL money or the fame, and it is completely alright. But will this be good for their NFL career? “Maybe not the best model for that,” Saban noted. Regardless, you cannot deny that this change in the landscape brought us some amazing moments this season itself. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Is NIL money ruining college football, or is it just leveling the playing field? Debate The first big example is the Buckeyes. Ryan Day and OSU have put upwards of $20 million into building a noteworthy roster. And has it paid off? The Buckeyes are currently sitting on the No.2 spot on the playoff list. So in short, yes, it has. They have the talent they need to win against big powerhouses, and that is the most important part. Another example is Ole Miss. Last season, the Rebels lost to the Bulldogs at a blowout 52-17. Lane Kiffin had nothing to stop Kirby Smart and his offense. Fast forward to the 2024 season and the Dawgs went home with a disappointing 10-28 loss to the Rebels.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The NIL factor allowed Kiffin to reach into the portal and build a defense and offense around his QB Jaxson Dart and this got him the result he wanted. They got their revenge and Ole Miss is well on its way to the playoffs. This NIL thing has the power to make any program good. You just have to know how to use it correctly.

Every year, NASCAR teams and drivers gather to celebrate the season at the NASCAR Awards Banquet. It was at the 2011 banquet that Tony Stewart and Jimmie Johnson pulled off an unforgettable prank. The audience was stunned and buzzing for days after what began as a traditional awards show turned into hilarity. There was nothing ordinary about this year for NASCAR. Stewart just won the Sprint Cup Series championship after narrowly beating Carl Edwards in a tiebreaker. It was hard for Johnson to deal with falling short after dominating for five seasons. There was excitement surrounding Stewart’s victory as well as optimism surrounding Johnson’s drive for reinvention. With a single announcement from the host, the banquet took a turn for the weird. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad An otherwise formal evening was lightheartedly broken up by NASCAR’s camaraderie. The duo delivered a moment that reminded everyone in attendance of the joy and unpredictability NASCAR brings on and off the track. For Johnson, there was a layer of poignancy behind the laughter. After the 2011 season, he ended a record-breaking championship streak that made him a living legend. Instead of focusing on Stewart’s win, it focused on the bonds between competitors. The atmosphere was competitive but respectful, with a hint of humor thrown in. Jimmie Johnson came on stage as a living legend. He already had four consecutive years of winning the Cup Series Championship. However, while Tony Stewart won the trophy in 2011, Johnson showed up at the awards ceremony to support his friend and rival Stewart. The audience sat in eager anticipation as the host announced the head table honoree. “And the 2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion driver of the number 14 Office Depot, Mobil 1 Chevrolet of Stewart-Haas Racing, Tony Stewart…” A momentary pause followed, then the announcement repeated itself, each time more jumbled, with phrases like “Stewart-Horse Racing” thrown in for good measure. The crowd went a bit crazy until Tony Stewart showed up, grinning mischievously, to Jimmie Johnson‘s question. The driver needed no clarification on what just happened. He realized Tony Stewark had just pranked him. via Getty SOUTH BOSTON, VIRGINIA – JUNE 25: Tony Stewart #14 climbs into his car prior to the Camping World Superstar Racing Experience event at South Boston Speedway on June 25, 2022 in South Boston, Virginia. (Photo by Jared Tilton/SRX/Getty Images) He celebrated his championship with his characteristic flair but Johnson used his speech to showcase his competitive drive and outlook. Looking back on his five championships, Johnson expressed gratitude for the journey but also regretted 2011. “There’s an indescribable feeling of accomplishment that comes with being the champion,” he admitted, adding that it was tough not to experience it that year. Did Tony Stewart's prank on Jimmie Johnson steal the spotlight from his own championship win? Debate The moment was simply a reminder of the bond the two share. When Tony Stewart chose to call it quits at the end of the 2016 season, Johnson had a heartwarming message for his friend, asking him not to grow up. In an even more heartwarming moment, after Jimmie Johnson won the Championship race at Homestead-Miami and sealed his seventh title, he had a special gift for his friend. The two swapped their helmets as a reminder of all the memories they shared, and all the races they fought each other in. For now, it’s time to see how Johnson took the 2011 defeat with grace. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Even though it was disappointing, Johnson maintained a positive tone, stressing that he was committed to rebuilding. Despite their dominance, he acknowledged that they had grown complacent because of their dominance. The competition had studied and adapted to strategies that once set the No. 48 team apart, forcing Johnson and his crew to face the reality of being caught. It was humbling, but it motivated them to keep pushing forward. In his speech, Johnson praised Stewart’s achievement, calling it “the impossible” and congratulating his rival-turned-friend. He also talked about his future ambitions. He thanked Hendrick Motorsports and his sponsors, but it was clear he was focused on getting back on top. “I won’t be able to feel [the accomplishment of a championship] this year,” Johnson admitted, “but I’m really proud of the guy who will.” Taking his loss in with grace, Jimmie Johnson went into the following seasons with a sense of greater energy to win the title once again. While 2012 didn’t go his way either, with the driver finishing 3rd in the Championship. He did manage to win the titles in 2013 and 2016, but the streak of winning back-to-back championships remains unbroken. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad It was also a nice chance for Johnson to reflect on his personal growth. The driver joked about his reluctant foray into social media and even poked fun at his on-track run-ins, including his failed attempt to crash Kurt Busch. It was clear, despite his humor, that the setbacks of 2011 would provide fuel for a comeback. Pranks like this one are fan-favorites in NASCAR lore, emblematic of the personalities that make it so fun. Aside from the laughs, the banquet captured a pivotal moment in both drivers’ careers. After a rare defeat, Stewart celebrated a hard-fought championship and Johnson was preparing to rewrite his story.  Let the world know your perspective.

(Photo by Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images) Debate Can Elvis Smylie maintain his lead and claim victory, or will Jason Day steal the spotlight? The 2024 BMW Australian PGA Championship began on November 21 and will go on till November 24 at the Royal Queensland Golf Club in Brisbane. This event, which has now been cut short to 54 holes because of 180mm rainfall on Thursday night also serves as one of the most significant golf tournaments in Australia. The championship features a mix of Australia’s top players and international stars. Min Woo Lee returned to the field to defend his title, while players like Cameron Smith have made the event all the more thrilling. The first round has already concluded, and Elvis Smylie has taken the lead by one stroke, and three players are tied for the second position. If Smylie continues with the same momentum, he might grab the trophy this year. The 2024 BMW Australian PGA Championship has a total purse of AUD 2 million which is around USD 1.3 million. If Elvis Smylie keeps up with the pace of his gameplay, he will be taking home the highest portion of the total prize money. He will be getting $340,000. On the other hand, players finishing in the runner-up and second runner-up positions will be entitled to AUD 220,000 and AUD126,000. All the seventy players who make the cut after the Friday round will get some portion of the prize money. The player who finishes at the bottom of the leaderboard will get the lowest amount (AUD3,800). Here is what the final payout in Australian Dollars looks like: The winner will also get approximately 13.1 OWGR points, and 2000 Race to Dubai points are on the line too. While the field is filled with star-studded players, Jason Day is one of the highest-ranked players. And well, while he needs to maintain his rank, the 2024 BMW Australian PGA Championship is a rather special event for him nonetheless. Jason Day teed off with Cameron Smith and Min Woo Lee during the opening round from the back nine. He is currently tied at T6 with five other players and is just two strokes behind Elvis Smylie. He is all set to make his home fans proud since this is the first time he has been playing on Australian soil since the 2017 Australian Open. This year also marks Jason Day’s return to the Australian PGA Championship after a 12-year hiatus since his T9 finish at Coolum in 2011. Now 37, Day has been reacquainting himself with the significantly updated Royal Queensland Golf Club layout.     A post shared by Jason Day (@jasondayofficial)  As the highest-ranked player in the field at No. 31 in the Official World Golf Ranking, Day recognizes he might not be the crowd favorite in Queensland. He humbly acknowledged the local hero, saying, “Cammy [Smith] is a very big favorite here and has a lot of fans,” referring to three-time Australian PGA Championship winner Cameron Smith. He also added that although he is from Australia he does not play much there and hence it is difficult to get fans attention. But he is willing to fight through it. Do you think Day will be able to lift the trophy on his home ground when the 54-hole play comes to an end on Sunday? Let us know in the comments section below!   Let the world know your perspective.

This is that time of the college football season when Heisman races get more interesting. Surprisingly, this year, the top two contenders are not the quarterbacks. Any guesses? You are right if Deion Sander’s two-way star and Ashton Jeanty popped into your head. Indeed, Hunter is deserving of the honor. His dual-threat sets him apart. Ashton Jeanty, who was leading the race for the past few weeks, is in the second position after Week 12. Now, the competition is getting more fierce as we get closer to the champions. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad     A post shared by College Football (@cfbalerts) Let’s get into it. Cumulative snaps? Is there any chance that he may be talking about Coach Prime’s No. 12? Just kidding! Of course, he’s undermining Hunter’s game. Talking about the snaps, Hunterh has played around 1200 of those ‘not-that-great-as-per-some-people’ things for the Buffs this season. But is that it? Is that why Hunter advocates keep going gaga over him? Absolutely not. He’s a Heisman contender because he makes Heisman plays. So far, he has caught 74 receptions for 911 yards and scored nine touchdowns. On the other hand, he has recorded 23 tackles. Let’s not even get into the interceptions. He had one against the Utah Utes in Week 12. Offensively, he miraculously caught a 4th down pass attempt by jumping over two Utah defenders. That’s what he brings to every snap. On the other hand, Jeanty has appeared in 10 games, completed 1893 rushing yards, which is the highest this season, and scored 26 touchdowns. This season, he also holds the record for most rushing yards and rushing touchdowns in a single season, a record set by the Oklahoma State Cowboys and Detroit Lions running back Barry Sanders. Sanders completed 2,628 yards and scored 37 touchdowns in 1988. Clearly, Jeanty is on his way towards historic numbers. Both can make the case to be the Heisman and of course, the whole thing is subjective. So, there will be opinions and counter-opinions. But let’s not undermine one to advocate for the other. Moving ahead, let’s see who is after Hunter and Jeanty in the race. If Hunter makes any mistake this week, Jeanty has a chance to lead again. But the competition is not just between both of them. Cam Ward, Alabama’s quarterback Jalen Milroe and Indiana’s QB Kurtis Rourke are also on the list. After Miama’s recent defeat against Georgia Tech, Ward’s odds have dropped significantly. It is not a good sign, but he is still a strong quarterback. As we know, the dynamics change every single week; again, no doubt, he has improved a lot and remains one of the best quarterbacks in the country. If he delivers against Wake Forest and Syracuse, he has a high chance of being in the top spot. Oh, is Jalen Milroe a contender? He had a rollercoaster ride this season, but he is back on track. After disappointing a few weeks in the second half, he delivered one of his best performances last week. We are sure he has learned lots of lessons this season as he led the program to an impressive 8-2 record. Meanwhile, another addition could be Indiana’s Kurtis Rourke, who is currently making headlines; he will improve his position if he helps Indiana set a new 11-0 record. Will he? Who do you think deserves the title? Is Hunter's dual-threat ability enough to overshadow Jeanty's record-breaking rushing stats for the Heisman?

   Three teams made the postseason out of the American League Central this season, but unfortunately for the Chicago White Sox, they were not one of them. Not only did the White Sox miss the playoffs, but they had one of the worst seasons in MLB history as they finished with a record of 41 wins and 121 losses. The White Sox will have some work to do if they want to put together a competitive roster for the 2025 season. With this offseason being an important one for the White Sox, they have made a contract decision about Gavin Sheets. According to Jon Heyman on ‘X,’ Sheets was non-tendered by the White Sox. Gavin Sheets non-tendered by White Sox — Jon Heyman (@JonHeyman) November 22, 2024  A basic non-tendered definition is when an organization chooses to not give a player a contract for the upcoming season, therefore making them a free agent. Sheets came into the league with the White Sox in 2021 and has played all four MLB seasons for the organization. In 2024, Sheets played in 139 games and batted .233 with 10 home runs, 45 RBIs, and a .660 OPS. The White Sox struggled in general as a team, but Sheets had a career-high in hits, runs scored, doubles, and triples. It will be interesting to see how the White Sox approach building their roster for next season and whether or not they completely wipe the roster and opt for a full reset. The White Sox won the AL Central just four years ago in 2021, but they have dramatically fallen off ever since. Will Venable, the White Sox’s new manager, will have his work cut out for him if he wants to get this White Sox team back to a competitive level in 2025.",2024-11-22,1,0.43,0.57

   The Kansas City Royals were one of three teams out of the American League Central to make the postseason in 2024. After missing the postseason for the last eight seasons after winning the World Series in 2015, the Royals broke through in 2024. A key player in the Royals’ 86-win season and playoff berth was their star shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. MLB Network’s Analyst Tom Verducci made a big statement about Witt Jr’s 2024 season. “This is one of the all-time great seasons by a shortstop,” Verducci said. ""This is one of the all-time great seasons by a shortstop."" Bobby Witt Jr. put up historic numbers for the @Royals in 2024 and it landed him on the AL MVP podium! 👏 pic.twitter.com/q5Lpq7rvXv — MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) November 22, 2024  Witt Jr. came into the league with the Royals in 2022 and has improved each season with the team. In 2024, Witt Jr. played in 161 games and batted .332 with 32 home runs, 109 RBIs, 31 stolen bases, and a .977 OPS. Verducci pointed out that Witt Jr. won the batting title while having a 30/30 season with 30 plus home runs and 30 plus stolen bases, and he was only the third player to ever do so. The Royals lost 106 games in 2023, but they were able to turn it around in 2024 and finish with a record of 86 wins and 76 losses. Witt Jr. had a career-high in games played, runs scored, hits, doubles, home runs, RBIs, walks, batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and OPS in 2024. If Witt Jr. can continue to improve his game each season, he could regularly see his name in the Most Valuable Player conversation. The Royals will look to put together another winning season in 2025 as they look to make the playoffs two years in a row for the first time since 2014 and 2015.",2024-11-22,0,0.57,0.43

   The Milwaukee Brewers made the postseason for the second straight year as they finished with a record of 93 wins and 69 losses. Although they made the playoffs and won the National League Central for the second straight season, the Brewers made an early exit as they lost to the New York Mets in the wild-card round. The Brewers lost their former Most Valuable Player Christian Yelich to injury during the season, but their star rookie outfielder Jackson Chourio was able to step up in his place. Brewers Manager Pat Murphy revealed his thoughts on Jackson Chourio this season. “I’ve never seen that type of growth in the major leagues.  At the end of the year, you didn’t want anyone else at the plate,” Murphy said.

His impressive rookie season was enough to finish third in the National League Rookie of the Year voting. Chourio played in 148 games and batted .275 with 21 home runs, 79 RBIs, and a .791 OPS. Murphy describes that he’s never seen a player struggle at the beginning of the season and have that much growth by the end of the same season. Chourio went from a miserable slump to seemingly coming through for his team in every at-bat he took. Although the Brewers lost Yelich, Chourio was able to step up and be the guy, and the Brewers hope he can continue his success in his sophomore season.",2024-11-22,0,0.5,0.5

   The Detroit Tigers were one of Major League Baseball’s most surprising teams in 2024 as they made the playoffs for the first time in the last ten seasons. Not only did they make the playoffs, but they swept the Houston Astros in the wild-card series before losing to the Cleveland Guardians in the American League Division Series in five games. The MLB offseason is heating up as free agent players began talking with teams interested in signing them. Alex Bregman is one of the big-name free agents this offseason and MLB Analyst Scott Braun predicted where he thinks Bregman will end up. “Bregman to third for the Tigers,” Braun said. .@scottbraun says Alex Bregman will end up in Motown with the @Tigers pic.twitter.com/QTbf0SdkYb — Foul Territory (@FoulTerritoryTV) November 22, 2024  Bregman came into the league in 2016 with the Astros and has played all nine seasons of his MLB career with the organization. In 2024, Bregman batted .260 with 26 home runs, 75 RBIs, and a .768 OPS in 145 games played. Braun thinks that Bregman would be a great fit for the Tigers and be the player they thought Javier Baez would be when they signed him. Bregman is one of those players who makes every player around him better, and Braun thinks his veteran presence would fit perfectly in this young Tigers team’s clubhouse. Nothing is ever set in stone during free agency, but predictions can make it fun for fans to hope their team will sign a superstar player. Bregman will draw interest from several teams, but Braun thinks the Tigers are where he will end up. The Tigers will look to make the postseason for the second straight season as they search for their fifth World Series title in franchise history.",2024-11-22,1,0.49,0.51

   The ending of the Major League Baseball season saw the New York Yankees fall to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series. After losing a chance at another title, the Yankees have another battle on their hands as they try to resign their star outfielder Juan Soto. Along with the Yankees, Soto is also drawing interest from the New York Mets. MLB Analyst Deesha Thosar was asked who is feeling the most pressure to sign Soto. “I think Hal is feeling the pressure, and I think the Yankees need it more,” Thosar said. Hal Steinbrenner is ""feeling the pressure"" says @DeeshaThosar pic.twitter.com/Hpny9Xnrcb — Foul Territory (@FoulTerritoryTV) November 22, 2024  Thosar explains that Cohen, the owner of the Mets, has flexed his ability to sign big players multiple times with the signings of Justin Verlander, Max Scherzer, and Francisco Lindor. She also mentions that Steinbrenner, the owner of the Yankees, hasn’t been this publicly vocal about a free agent signing since Aaron Judge was a free agent. Soto is also drawing interest from teams outside of New York including the Los Angeles Dodgers, Boston Red Sox, and Toronto Blue Jays, so the competition is heating up. The Yankees went to the World Series in Soto’s first year with the team, which could play in their favor when he makes his final decision. If Soto is just looking for the highest number, then it would appear Cohen has the advantage. It will be interesting to see how the Soto sweepstakes plays out in the end.",2024-11-22,1,0.45,0.55

   The Buffalo Bills look like they could be the team of destiny right now. Sean McDermott’s team is sitting at a record of 9-2 and is coming off a huge win at home over the previously unbeaten Kansas City Chiefs. Former NFL quarterback and current NBC analyst Chris Simms joined the Dan Le Batard Show Friday afternoon to talk about the Bills being the biggest threat to the Chiefs in the AFC. “The Bills are real this year. This is the most real team that they’ve had in awhile. If they play the Chiefs in the playoffs – they’re going to beat the Chiefs in the playoffs,” Simms bluntly said. ""The Bills are real this year. This is the most real team that they've had in awhile.

WATCH: https://t.co/7ZAwqQ9fFk pic.twitter.com/J5V7bmVMG7 — Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz (@LeBatardShow) November 22, 2024  The Bills and Chiefs might have the biggest rivalry in the sport right now among rivalries out of the division. While Kansas City has handled business in the playoffs against Buffalo in previous years, this season feels a little different. Bills Pro Bowl quarterback Josh Allen is playing like an MVP as he has continued to utilize his multitude of weapons on offense. Running back James Cook might be the most underrated running back in the game, and the addition of wide receiver Amari Cooper has made a huge difference too. Defensively, this unit has been able to perform well after cutting ties with plenty of veterans from years past last offseason. After seeing Buffalo handle Kansas City by two possessions last Sunday, that could make for an even spicier rematch if the teams were to meet down the road in late January.",2024-11-22,1,0.42,0.58

   The Major League Baseball awards have now been completed after the winners of the National and American League Most Valuable Players were announced on Thursday. Chris Sale of the Atlanta Braves took home the NL Cy Young Award while Tarik Skubal won the AL Cy Young Award. According to MLB Network Radio on Sirius XM on ‘X,’ opposing batters hit just .159 with zero home runs against Sale’s changeup in 2024. Braves special assistant Tyler Flowers gave his thoughts on Sale’s changeup. “The re-introduction of Chris Sale’s changeup brings another element back into play,” Flowers said.

When Sale was playing for the Boston Red Sox, he was using his slider a lot more often, which Flowers thinks contributed to his injury issues. 2024 was Sale’s first season with the Braves and he started 29 games with a record of 18 wins and three losses with a 2.38 ERA and 225 strikeouts in 177.2 innings pitched. Sale had a career-high in wins and his most strikeouts since the 2017 season when he had 308 with the Red Sox. After winning his first Cy Young Award of his career, it will be interesting to see how Sale performs next season if he indeed does play another year. The Braves will hope to see their newly acquired ace starting pitcher back on the mound next season.",2024-11-22,0,0.58,0.42

   As the Major League Baseball offseason gets underway and the free agent class takes over most of the attention, other big headlines should be noted. There have been rumors of robot umpires circling the league for a while now, but 2025 will actually see robot umpires used during spring training games. The addition of robot umpires would ensure that the calls on the field are correct and avoid the multiple missed or wrong calls that happen on a daily basis with human umpires. MLB Analyst Erik Kratz gave his thoughts on the MLB testing robot umpires in 2025 spring training and possibly implementing it league-wide as early as 2026. MLB will test robot umpires in Spring Training and could implement it league-wide as early as 2026.@ErikKratz31 offers his thoughts… 👇 pic.twitter.com/b7GTcbisy2 — Foul Territory (@FoulTerritoryTV) November 22, 2024  Kratz mentions that some umpires are all for the robot umpires, and some don’t really care either way. The MLB has made several changes to the game in recent years including the addition of the pitch clock, making the bases larger, and limiting the number of mound visits a team may use. With the addition of robot umpires, the game would likely move along quicker as there would be no reason to argue any of the calls on the field. It will be interesting to see how the test run goes during spring training and to see if we could see robot umpires in the 2026 regular season. The free agent class is getting most of the attention this offseason, but the robot umpires will be another topic that will be talked about more as time goes on. Robot umpires could be another tactic used by the MLB to speed up the game times in a season that includes 162 regular season games.",2024-11-22,1,0.42,0.58

In a recent video that has surfaced on social media, Williamson received a tattoo on his back of an animated character (via NBA Central). Zion’s new back tattoo 👀 (🎥 @Antmikes / @overtime )   pic.twitter.com/gJIsT10O6n — NBACentral (@TheDunkCentral) November 22, 2024  The two-time All-Star has struggled to stay healthy during his young career. In parts of six years, the former Duke Blue Devil has played in over 60 games just twice. He missed the entire 2021-2022 season due to injury. This is not what the Pelicans were expecting when he was drafted in the first round back in the 2019 NBA Draft. While the team has had Williamson on the roster, they have not made it past the first round of the playoffs and have finished no higher than eighth in the Western Conference standings. Luckily, the former National College Player of the Year is still just 24 years of age. He has plenty of time to get back to full health. Remember, Philadelphia 76ers MVP center Joel Embiid has had his fair share of injuries and has been able to become one of the faces of the league. A lot of eyes need to be on Williamson as he continues to scratch and claw towards recovery. As it stands right now, he is still the present and future of the team.

But after making the NFC Championship Game last season, this Lions team looks to be even better. They look like a Super Bowl team, thanks to how they play week in and week out. Pro Bowl quarterback Jared Goff looks like an MVP as he continues to utilize All-Pro pass-catcher Amon-Ra St. Brown and Co. Additionally, the running back duo of David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs could be the best in the league. It helps when you have an elite offensive line. Defensively, defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn leads a gritty unit that has overcome the loss of star edge-rusher Aidan Hutchinson.

He said that having been a top-level player previously, he knows ‘all of the tricks’ and won’t be giving players too much leeway to play with him or his coaches when it comes to putting in the hard yards. ‘First thing, I think we have to be better athletes. That is something that you can acknowledge when we are here and we see the data,’ he told Neville in the Sky Sports chat. ‘When I say fitter, it’s not being thinner or anything about that. It’s the data. You have to understand the data to press high, what is the average metres that you have to run, the sprints. ‘You have all this data and you have to cope with that. So you already know your goal is to reach that. You can run a lot but if you don’t understand the game, it doesn’t matter. But the first point to press high, you have to be very fit and you have to cope with the demands of pressing high.’ So his non-negotiables, we learned what those are, too. ‘You can say the pretty things like hard work, be professional. You should be,’ he said. ‘This is Manchester United. In every club [you should be] but here, of course, you cannot run from that.      While he has a signature smile, there is also a ruthless drive that will rub off on his players   ‘The aim is to think first in the team. So I know that some guys will sometimes play in a different position, but they have to understand the position and they have to fight for the team. As a former player, I know every trick.’ It should be noted, though, that at 39 years old and not too far removed from the dressing room as a player himself, Amorim can connect with many of United’s stars like those who have come before him often couldn’t. He knows how they think, knows how they operate on good and bad days and there is also that unwavering loyalty to his players. ‘I can lose my job before throwing a player under the bus,’ he said. ‘But if he doesn’t put the team in first place, I will be the first one to talk with the player.’ To any of the players who were dialled in, consider the lines drawn in the sand. Now it’s over to you. Ever since Amorim got the job and it became clear he was going to go with 3-4-3 from the off, the identity of who will play in the wing-back roles has been the source of fierce debate. Wingers are synonymous with Manchester United but many of their attackers who play out wide have shown limited capabilities going the other way when asked to defend.      He will favour full-backs such as Noussair Mazraoui (left) to play in his wing-back positions      He is totally confident in his approach and philosophy but knows some players cannot do it    It made Amorim’s response to Neville when asked about it particularly interesting as an insight into his thinking after just a few days of training. He said he will ‘likely start with full backs in wing-back roles, because to teach a winger to defend is harder.’ It should be noted that in training footage released by United we saw Antony deployed as a right wing-back. But if we take Amorim at his word now, it means that Bruno Fernandes, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Amad Diallo, Mason Mount, Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund are all competing for just three places in the 3-4-3 line up, with Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui set to get the nods out wide. It was also particularly interesting in his press conference that Amorim has total belief in his system and any players who don’t feel the same will soon be cut loose. ‘As a coach you have to choose one way or another, I choose always 100 per cent our way,’ he said. ‘I choose to risk a bit. I believe so much in our way of playing; they will believe too. There is no second way. ‘We will adapt some players because we don’t have a different profile. Maybe on Sunday you will see the starting 11 and not feel a lot of change but you will see it in the game and the positioning or where they receive the ball.’ Garnacho the left wing-back? Think again.      It raises questions about where Alejandro Garnacho fits in with a system not suited to wingers ‘Call me naive,’ he said with a grin on his face, ‘but I truly believe that I’m the right guy in the right moment. ‘I could be wrong, but the earth still will turn, the sun will rise again. It doesn’t matter. I truly believe that I’m the right guy for this job.’ This wasn’t bluster. A man bluffing his way to a headline. Ruben Amorim has total belief that he is the man to finally take Manchester United back to the top. Now, they all say this during the honeymoon stage, you expect nothing less. And perhaps this is recency bias but observing Amorim it is hard not to be impressed – and ultimately believe him. It is important to note too that he is not scared to tread where perhaps other new managers dare not, particularly when it comes to calling out his superiors. ‘Us as a club have to set the standards and have to manage that,’ he told Neville when asked about Marcus Rashford and Casemiro jetting off to the United States during the international break. ‘It’s my decision if they can have five days, or three days, or three days to rest and you cannot fly. This is something that us as a club have to decide. ‘Would I set a different structure? Yes, for sure.’ Amorim transformed Sporting into the dominant force in Portuguese football and he didn’t take them there by worrying about who he may upset along the way. His career to date has built him up for the biggest challenge of them all, now it’s on him to show he can handle it and thrive, rather than shrink, in the spotlight.      Amorim thinks he can be first United boss to win the Premier League since Sir Alex Ferguson      Amorim appears intent on learning about the history of the club      He must now figure out how to get the best out of the current United squad Erik ten Hag used to talk about being ‘in the same boat’ with Ineos and the football board, particularly when it came to recruitment. We reported recently that funds will be significantly reduced for Amorim as a result of Ten Hag’s lavish spend of more than £600million – but we learned that any suggestion he won’t be consulted, or allowed a veto, on signings is flat out wrong. ‘I think it has to be all together because if you are a coach coming here and already chose the players, you could be wrong because the club will be here for a long time and you as a coach, you don’t know that,’ he said. ‘We have to improve the process of recruitment, the data. I think it is all together, but the final word should be the manager, not because it is your right but because it is your responsibility. ‘I have to understand the league and then when everything is aligned, everyone is on the same page, we can buy and sell players.’ Sporting director Dan Ashworth and technical director Jason Wilcox have been key drivers in recruitment since arriving but consider this another line drawn in the sand by Amorim. It is he who will have the final say, that much is for sure.      Amorim (pictured far right) will have to work with Man United’s INEOS board on recruitment Footage from his early training sessions showed him getting his players rushing up and down the pitch to recover possession in the exercise of giving it away. They do that a lot in games, he conceded, and continuing to do that will see results falter as they have been. So, along with needing to be ‘better athletes’ you can bet your bottom dollar that Amorim and his coaching staff will be relentless when it comes to the fitness levels of this group between now and the end of the season. I hope the players packed their running shoes… Your email address will not be published.

Chelsea’s head coach says he has ‘no idea’ how Foxes fans will welcome him back to the King Power Stadium on Saturday, but insists his connection with the squad was special. Leicester secured their return to the elite level of English football via Leeds losing 4-0 at QPR on April 26. Maresca was at home celebrating when a tap on the window in the early hours of the morning led him to discover his stars waiting outside in his garden.   ‘I was at home watching the (QPR versus Leeds) game, then when it finished, all the staff arrived,’ Maresca said. ‘We were having a normal celebration, with family, kids, the staff, Willy (Caballero), Danny (Walker), Robby (Vitiello). ‘Then later – very late – the players arrived. The first face I saw was Hamza (Choudhury) but they didn’t even knock at the door – they were in the garden and then at my window. When I drew the curtains, it was his face there. ‘It was probably the best present I got last season. It showed how the team was close, and the connection with the players, that they could go for parties at different places yet they all arrived at my home. I will always be thankful to them. When I was a player I was lucky to win things but I never thought to go to the manager’s house.’      Enzo Maresca has detailed how Leicester players gatecrashed his house at 2am after they won the Championship      Maresca led the Foxes to the Championship title – and promotion back to the Premier League      Now he is in charge of Chelsea and will take his new side back to his former club on Saturday Asked how he thinks Leicester’s fans will welcome him back to the King Power, Maresca said: ‘I have no idea. But I know how I am going to be with them. I will be thankful to the club, the players and the fans. Because it was a fantastic season. I cannot control how they are going to receive me. But I can control how I receive them.’ Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall was among those who turned up unannounced at Chez Maresca. The 26-year-old midfielder followed his manager from Leicester to Chelsea for £30million, though has not yet started a Premier League match. ‘Kiernan was, at Leicester, the most important player,’ Maresca said. ‘He moved to Chelsea to be one other player. You have to accept that. ‘Probably at the beginning, you struggle to accept that. Now it’s getting better. Me as a manager, I am very happy with Kiernan, no doubt. But for sure for him, he has to continue to work, wait for the chance and take it, in the way he is doing in the Conference League. He is doing OK.’ Your email address will not be published.

Watkins has been one of the Premier League’s most lethal strikers during Emery’s tenure and was chosen ahead of Harry Kane for England’s Nations League win in Greece this month. At Villa, though, Watkins is facing his own challenge from Jhon Duran. Watkins has been substituted between the 60th and 70th minute six times this season, and Duran has eight goals in all competitions to Watkins’s five — although the Colombian has not scored in the Premier League since September 21.   ‘Each player has to understand the process we have,’ said Emery, whose side face Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon.  ‘Watkins is very important for us, but some circumstances can change. We are building a team with two players for every position. ‘Watkins has to accept and adapt quickly to his new position, playing the same way as last year, with his quality and capacity. I don’t want just one player feeling confident, getting minutes, scoring goals. I want every player to have the same mentality.’      Unai Emery has hinted that Ollie Watkins’ starting spot at No 9 for Aston Villa is not guaranteed       Jhon Duran has scored eight goals in all competitions for Villa – three more than Watkins Emery pointed out that without Duran’s contributions early in the season, Villa might be far worse off. Though they have lost their past two league matches, Villa remain firmly in Champions League contention. Duran was decisive in wins over West Ham, Leicester and Everton after coming on, as Watkins struggled to find top form having played at Euro 2024. Emery added: ‘Watkins needed time to get fit and confident again. He did not do all the pre-season. ‘We needed Duran scoring goals in the last 30 minutes of matches. ‘If we didn’t have Duran helping as we did, then maybe we wouldn’t have the points that we do now.

For them, it’s almost an annual event, so rare is it for them to lose one game of football, let alone four in a row. At Arsenal, we went through long periods without losing. You play in a very proud manner, with that feeling of being unbeatable energising and enveloping everyone.   Yet I would be lying if I said we did not wonder what would happen if and when that bubble were to burst. Arsene Wenger even used to ask me how I thought the team might respond once we were beaten. Pep Guardiola faced that very problem over the last month as City became the talk of the Premier League for all the wrong reasons. Who knows, maybe the noise around Guardiola possibly leaving amid their 115 charges was unsettling, but all that uncertainty vanished overnight with his signing of a new two-year contract. Now what they need is to follow that up with a home win over Tottenham.      Pedro Porro’s relentless crossing ability from right back may prove to be a handful for Man City      Pep Guardiola will look to snap his side’s four game losing streak at home on Saturday evening Looking at the brave way Ange Postecoglou’s team play, City will be asked questions on Saturday evening. What Tottenham will offer is more balls into the box than anyone they have faced. Nobody in the Premier League has produced a higher number of crosses than Spurs’ 275 this season, with Pedro Porro responsible for 76 of those as the full back flies down the right wing to allow Brennan Johnson to move inside. When you look back at the goals conceded by City this could pose a problem, as there are some serious issues which need solving. Take Fulham’s second goal at the Etihad last month, for example. The visitors are moving the ball from side to side at the back, but then one punched pass takes them through two lines of City’s defensive shield and into a pocket of space behind their Rodri-less midfield. Fulham work it wide to Reiss Nelson on the right with zero pressure on them. The cross comes in from Nelson and City’s marking is non-existent. John Stones will know he should have been tight to Rodrigo Muniz as Fulham’s striker is on his own with time to control the ball and finish. City weathered that late storm to keep their 3-2 lead, but they have also conceded goals from crosses to Arsenal, Wolves and Bournemouth. City have had disruption in their defence, with Guardiola fielding six different back fours in 11 Premier League games. That said, equally concerning for Guardiola is how City have conceded in flurries in their last couple of defeats — two goals in five minutes to Brighton and three in 11 to Sporting Lisbon — which perhaps suggests a lack of leadership and character.      Guardiola’s side may face on onslaught of crosses from Spurs, who lead the league in this stat When you concede, you need to come together as a group, not allow your opponents to gain confidence and energy from grabbing that first goal. It would be ridiculous for anyone to write off City. They’re still in all the fights which they have won before, for the Premier League, for the Champions League and so on. This is fixable, of course it is. Guardiola is the professor of football in today’s game. His back is against the wall as he feels others are celebrating their four-defeat slump. But you can bet he will come out swinging like the serial winner he is. Your email address will not be published.

City are locked in a battle with the top flight after they were charged with 115 breaches of financial rules, with a verdict expected in the new year. Relegation is one potential punishment should City be found guilty of serious offending. And Guardiola admitted rivals’ presumption of City’s guilt had played a part in his decision this week to extend his contract. ‘I read something about how we need to be relegated immediately,’ he said. ’75 per cent of the clubs want it, because I know what they do behind the scenes and this sort of stuff.   ‘I prefer not to be in that position but once it’s there I love it — because you believe in your club and the people there. I believe what they say to me (about the alleged breaches) and the reasons why. We’re awaiting the sentence in February or March. ‘What happens if we are relegated? I will be here. I don’t know the position they are going to bring us. The Conference? ‘But we will come up and come up and come back to the Premier League. I feel it.’      Pep Guardiola has insisted that 75 per cent of Premier League clubs want Manchester City ‘to be relegated immediately’      City are locked in a battle with the top flight after they were charged with 115 breaches of financial rules      Clubs approved changes to sponsorship rules despite City’s attempts to have them thrown out Guardiola spoke out after a Premier League summit in London, where the clubs approved changes to sponsorship rules despite City’s attempts to have them thrown out. City had argued the framework around associated party transactions — deals clubs make with companies linked to their owners — was null and void after a legal challenge they triggered deemed sections of the regulations unlawful. However, 16 of the 20 clubs voted in favour of the Premier League’s amendments. City had threatened legal action should the changes be voted through, and that remains their position. They will now await guidance from a tribunal in January. Should it find in their favour, the new rules may be ripped up. City had accused the Premier League of rushing through the rule changes and chief executive Richard Masters of misleading clubs when he said the proposed amendments could be made swiftly. They had called for a delay until the panel who deemed parts of the rules unlawful returned with a verdict on whether that meant changes — such as including shareholder loans in the rules — could be made or whether the whole system needed re-writing. Aston Villa publicly backed City, but only Saudi-owned Newcastle United and Nottingham Forest joined them yesterday, leaving the champions three short of the figure needed to block the plans. Manchester United and, perhaps surprisingly, Chelsea spoke in favour of the amendments. A Premier League statement said: ‘At a Premier League shareholders’ meeting today, clubs approved changes to the League’s associated party transaction (APT) rules. ‘The amendments to the rules address the findings of an arbitration tribunal following a legal challenge by Manchester City to the APT system earlier this year. The purpose of the APT rules is to ensure clubs are not able to benefit from commercial deals or reductions in costs that are not at fair market value by virtue of relationships with associated parties. ‘These rules were introduced to provide a robust mechanism to safeguard the financial stability, integrity and competitive balance of the league.’ Meanwhile, clubs unanimously voted for the Premier League to establish an in-house media operations business. From 2026-27, all international media content production and distribution will be brought in-house, ending a 20-year partnership with IMG. Your email address will not be published.

Purdy is dealing with a right shoulder injury and the 49ers are also potentially without left tackle Trent Williams and Nick Bosa due to injuries. Bosa was listed as out of Thursday's practice with an oblique injury. Williams also didn't suit up Thursday. He played through an ankle injury last week after being listed as questionable.  Purdy's typical Thursday post-practice media session was scrapped until Friday as the 49ers did not make any quarterback available. Kyle Allen would step in for Purdy as the starter if he can't play against the Packers.  Run game coordinator Chris Foerster said the 49ers aren't where they want to be at 5-5 because they haven't won close games, not because of injuries.  ""Seven games left is like an eternity,"" Foerster said. ""So much can happen. Do the math. What was our record last year? It was 12-5. I was on a 13-win team that was nowhere near as good as the team last year."" With or without Purdy, Foerster said the challenge for the 49ers is not to give up the ball to a defense that has 19 takeaways.  The 49ers have 13 giveaways this season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.37,0.63

A $4 million first prize is on the line at the LPGA's season finale at Tiburon Golf Club, where 60 players qualified based on the season-long Race to the CME Globe. An has never won on the LPGA Tour, but she finished 29th in the points race thanks to four top-10 finishes. Now she is in great position to land a massive victory. Angel Yin is alone in second, one stroke behind An, and Marina Alex and Allisen Corpuz are tied for third at 6 under. Lydia Ko of New Zealand is in striking distance of the lead after shooting a 5-under 67, part of a six-way tie for fifth. An, 28, hit all 14 fairways in regulation and needed just 23 putts to get around the course. She carded four birdies on each nine without a bogey. Though a $4 million paycheck is enticing, she said her attitude this week is that a tournament is a tournament. ""I think that mindset is good for make the focus during my play,"" An said. Yin, 26, was 2 over through four holes before turning things around. She got into red figures with three birdies before the end of the front nine, and she poured in four birdies between Nos. 10 and 14. Then, at the par-5 17th, she punctuated her day with an eagle 3. ""Started out a little bit rocky just because I was trying to adjust to the golf course,"" the Los Angeles native said. ""Golf course is playing quite difficult with the early winds this morning, which I really like and I enjoy, because it's our last tournament and it's a huge purse, bigger than a major. Doesn't have a title of a major, but I think it deserves every bit of difficulty it brings to closing the season out."" Alex, 34, also made a jump by eagling the 17th, but not the way she planned it. After a second shot she was unhappy with, she chipped in on her third. ""(On 17 she was) just like classically in the worst place I could have been, left and slightly long of that particular pin,"" the two-time winner from New Jersey said. ""... I thought I hit a nice chip. I was expecting it to be, I don't know, 10 to 15 feet, which was what I was going to be happy with trying to convert, and hit the pin and went in. ""Just you need some good breaks. Occasionally that kind of stuff happens."" Former U.S. Women's Open champ Corpuz had a bogey-free day, while Ko carded six birdies and one bogey. Ko is trying to polish off perhaps the best year of her career after she already collected an Olympic gold medal and the Women's Open title. She also qualified for the LPGA Hall of Fame and was inducted last month. ""I think this is the type of golf course where it's not like one fights into this type of golf course,"" Ko said. ""We've seen various of winners here, from longer hitters to people that hit it really straight and et cetera. ""... I think it's going to be exciting. It's always an exciting finish here. Hopefully, I'll be able to hit and play my fair share of good shots and be in contention and finish the season officially on a high."" World No. 1 Nelly Korda, who finished No. 1 in the points race, shot a pedestrian even-par 72 and is tied for 44th. Lexi Thompson, who's wrapping up her final full-time season on tour, is tied for 50th at 1-over 73. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.3,0.7

Winnipeg's second and third defeats of the season came in a 4-1 loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning on Nov. 14 and a 5-0 shutout to the Florida Panthers on Nov. 16. The Jets got a chance at immediate revenge against the Panthers on Tuesday, and capitalized with a 6-3 victory on home ice. ""We didn't like the way we played in Florida. So it's just a sign of a lot of good character in this room that we wanted to bounce back,"" said Mark Scheifele, who had a hat trick on Tuesday. ""We wanted to have a good game in front of our home crowd before we go on the road for what feels like forever."" Friday marks the start of a six-game road trip for the Jets, who are 7-2-0 in away games this season. The Penguins are 1-2-2 in their last five games, and have been struggling to either gain or hold leads. In the first two games of their five-game homestand, the Penguins almost blew a three-goal lead in Saturday's 4-3 shootout win over the San Jose Sharks, and then lost a two-goal lead in Tuesday's 3-2 overtime loss to the Lightning. Pittsburgh is 4-5-2 when scoring first in games, the lowest winning percentage (.364) of any team in the NHL when taking the early lead. ""We like parts of our game but I think we've just got to get more comfortable and just got to put 60 minutes together ... We have the leads in the game, we're right where we want to be and we let it slip,"" Penguins forward Rickard Rakell said. Keeping leads is always difficult with a leaky defense, and the Penguins have allowed the most goals (81) in the NHL. Pittsburgh's skaters have a combined -127 plus-minus rating, and goaltenders Alex Nedeljkovic, Tristan Jarry and Joel Blomqvist have a cumulative 3.62 goals-against average. Defenseman Kris Letang is questionable for Friday's lineup after missing Pittsburgh's last three games due to illness. It adds up for a great opportunity for the scorching Jets offense to keep lighting the lamp. Winnipeg is among the league leaders with an average of 4.21 goals per game. Since the Penguins host the Utah Hockey Club on Saturday, Nedeljkovic and Jarry figure to split the back-to-back starts in some order. The Jets are also playing consecutive games, as the team faces the Predators in Nashville on Saturday. Backup goalie Eric Comrie might be likelier to face Pittsburgh, as starter Connor Hellebuyck may be saved to face Winnipeg's Central Division rivals. Sidney Crosby could achieve another milestone Friday, as the Penguins star is sitting on 599 career NHL goals. Still a potent force in his 20th NHL season, Crosby leads Pittsburgh with 20 points (seven goals, 13 assists). Scheifele and Kyle Connor share the Jets' team scoring lead with 24 points apiece. Both players have an even 12 goals and 12 assists. In the first meeting between the two teams this season, the Jets collected a 6-3 win over the Penguins in Winnipeg on Oct. 20. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.33,0.67

""I got a little blood on my elbow, a little blood on my nose. My ankle,"" Craig said. ""I like games like that."" With injuries opening a spot for Craig in the starting lineup, the bump-and-shove looks to continue for the Bulls, who hope the frontcourt veteran's energetic influence rubs off. Chicago has lost eight of 11 entering Friday's visit from the Atlanta Hawks. Starting in place of Patrick Williams, who's expected to miss at least a week with left foot inflammation, Craig scored 15 points while snagging six rebounds in a 122-106 loss to the Bucks, matching Nikola Vucevic for the team high on the glass. ""It's no secret; you've just got to want the ball,"" Craig said. ""I'm a competitor. The ball's up, I try to compete for it."" Craig missed Chicago's Nov. 9 game at Atlanta due to illness. The Bulls won 125-113 behind 19 points from Ayo Dosunmu and Vucevic's 18-point, 12-rebound double-double. Coby White and Zach LaVine also scored 18 points. Bulls coach Billy Donovan said LaVine ""carried us"" against the Bucks, who closed the game on an 18-4 run. LaVine scored 20 of his 27 points before halftime and shot 9 of 15 for the game, including 4 of 7 from 3-point range. ""I've seen his shot-making; it's been incredible,"" Donovan said. ""He has the ability to get on a roll."" Atlanta is eyeing a split of a four-game road trip that has sandwiched losses at Portland and Golden State around a one-point victory in Sacramento. The Hawks lost 120-97 at Golden State on Wednesday, scoring just four points more than their season low. ""I didn't think that we talked enough tonight,"" said Atlanta coach Quin Snyder, whose team shot 33.3 percent, including just 26.7 percent (12 of 45) from deep. ""And sometimes that happens when you're not making shots and it's actually when you need each other, and even more. ""Regardless of who's in the game, how long they play, we can run. You can run. You can see that there's a corner and it's empty and you can fill it, and you can see where the ball is and you can space, and doing that gives us a chance to get connected."" Atlanta played with its full rotation against the Warriors. After missing the Sacramento game with left leg inflammation, Jalen Johnson posted a double-double of 15 points and 14 rebounds to lead six Hawks in double-figure scoring. Trae Young (12 points, 11 assists) and Clint Capela (11 points, 10 rebounds) also contributed double-doubles. Friday marks the resumption of NBA Cup play. Atlanta is seeking a 3-0 start in East Group C after previous victories at Boston and against Washington. The Bulls lost their lone group play contest to date, at Cleveland. Group play will continue on Tuesdays and Fridays through Dec. 3 to determine an elimination bracket later in the month. The winner of each group plus one wild card from each conference will advance to the knockout rounds. Chicago has won six of 10 against Atlanta. LaVine has shot 53.6 percent while averaging 25.4 points in his past 10 games against the Hawks. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.29,0.71

Ovechkin, 39, exited Monday's 6-2 win over the Utah Hockey Club with 14:30 remaining following a collision with Utah forward Jack McBain. A teammate had to help him off the ice. The Capitals announced Tuesday that Ovechkin was considered week-to-week as he underwent further evaluation on his leg. On Wednesday, the team placed him on injured reserve and recalled forward prospect Ivan Miroshnichenko from AHL affiliate Hershey. The injury interrupted Ovechkin while he was on a hot streak. He scored two goals in the Utah game before going down and has 13 goals in his past 11. Before Thursday's games, he owned the NHL lead with 15 goals on the season. Ovechkin's pursuit of history will now be postponed as well.

While Kentucky claims eight NCAA Tournament crowns and the most wins in college basketball history, Jackson State has never won an NCAA Tournament game and enters the matchup looking for its first win of the season. Impressive tradition and current record aside, Kentucky (4-0) returned no scholarship players from last season's team that was knocked off by Oakland in the NCAA Tournament. New coach Mark Pope and his essentially all-new Wildcats are off to a promising start. Through four games, Kentucky is averaging 94.3 points per game, and with 11.5 3-pointers made per game, the team is on pace to set a school record from long distance. The Wildcats boast six double-figure scorers with transfer guards Otega Oweh (from Oklahoma, 15.0 ppg) and Koby Brea (from Dayton, 14.5 ppg) leading the team. The Wildcats defeated Duke 77-72 on Nov. 12 but showed few signs of an emotional letdown in Tuesday's 97-68 win over a Lipscomb team picked to win the Atlantic Sun Conference in the preseason. Kentucky drained a dozen 3-pointers while outrebounding their visitors 43-28. Guard Jaxson Robinson, held to a single point by Duke, dropped 20 points to lead the Kentucky attack. Afterward, Pope praised his team's focus, saying, ""The last game was over and it was kind of on to, ‘How do we get better?' That's the only thing we talk about."" Lipscomb coach Lennie Acuff also delivered a ringing endorsement, calling Kentucky ""the best offensive Power Four team we've played in my six years at Lipscomb."" Jackson State (0-5) and third-year coach Mo Williams are looking for something positive to build upon. Not only are the Tigers winless, but they have lost each game by nine or more points. Sophomore guard Jayme Mitchell Jr. (13.8 ppg) is the leading scorer, but the team shoots just 35.8 percent while allowing opponents to shoot 52.3 percent. The Tigers played on Wednesday at Western Kentucky, where they lost 79-62. Reserve Tamarion Hoover had a breakout game with 18 points to lead Jackson State, but the host Hilltoppers canned 14 3-point shots and outrebounded the Tigers 42-35 to grab the win. Earlier, Williams, who played against Kentucky while a student at Alabama, admitted the difficulties of a challenging nonconference schedule for his team. ""Our goal is not to win 13 nonconference games,"" Williams said. ""We're already at a disadvantage in that regard. We use these games to get us ready for conference play and for March Madness."" Jackson State has not made the NCAA Tournament since 2007. The Tigers had a perfect regular-season record (11-0) in the Southwestern Athletic Conference in 2020-21 but lost in the league tournament. Kentucky has never played Jackson State before, but the game is being billed as part of a Unity Series of matchups in which Kentucky hosts members of the SWAC to raise awareness of Historical Black Colleges and Universities and provide funds for those schools. Past Unity Series opponents have been Southern in December 2021 and Florida A&M in December 2022. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.39,0.61

Sure enough, the Bucks have won four of their last five games heading into an NBA Cup matchup against the visiting Indiana Pacers on Friday. While Milwaukee is trending upward, Indiana has dropped four of its last five games. The Pacers shot 5 of 22 (22.7 percent) from 3-point range in a 130-113 loss to the Houston Rockets on Wednesday. Indiana will look to bounce back against the Bucks and star Giannis Antetokounmpo, who had 41 points, nine rebounds and eight assists in a 122-106 home win over the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday. Brook Lopez was among several players who struggled during the team's dismal start, but the 7-foot-1 center is averaging 19 points on 55.4 percent shooting over his last five games. ""We know the team that we are,"" Lopez said. ""We've known the team that we are all season long, we just had to prove it by winning games. It's gotten better and better. Obviously, the last few, we're happy with winning, they were close ones but we put in a lot of work, we're doing great."" The Bucks looked like a championship contender late in Wednesday's contest, when they closed the game on an 18-4 run. After the victory, Rivers reflected on his team's rough start to the season. ""I felt good about the team, I just didn't feel good about our record, to be honest,"" Rivers said. ""I still feel that way -- I don't feel good about our record yet -- but I do feel good about this team. I feel really good about this team."" Indiana coach Rick Carlisle isn't quite as pleased with his team, and he suggested changes could be coming following another disappointing loss on Wednesday. ""We're not playing well. That's obvious,"" Carlisle said. ""Our connectedness is not where it needs to be. Our collective spirit is not where it needs to be. I'm going to look very closely at the film tonight. The coaching staff is. We have to come up with answers."" The Pacers desperately need more production from All-Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton, who was held to four points on 1-of-7 shooting against Houston, including 1 of 5 from 3-point range. Haliburton is averaging 12.6 points while shooting 30.3 percent from the field and 30.8 percent (12 of 39) from 3-point range over his last five games. One bright spot in Wednesday's loss was the play of guard Quenton Jackson, who scored a career-high 24 points on 10-of-12 shooting in his first career start. Jackson also had three assists, two rebounds, two steals and a block in 27 minutes. ""Quenton Jackson is an example of where we need everybody's spirit to be,"" Carlisle said. ""The guy is flying all over the place, playing at a ridiculously high level of intensity and unselfishness and totally surrendering to the team, you know? For us, we just have to work at adopting that on a full-time basis and really being there for each other."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.26,0.74

With NBA Cup home wins over the Dallas Mavericks and Memphis Grizzlies under their belt, the Warriors will be looking not only to remain as the only unbeaten team in West Group C but also improve their point differential should it become needed. The Pelicans beat the Denver Nuggets in their only previous home game in the in-season tournament. At 1-1, they are tied with the Nuggets and Mavericks for second place in the group, but could drop the Warriors back to the pack with a win Friday. New Orleans has struggled big-time since its 101-94 victory over the Nuggets last Friday, falling to the Los Angeles Lakers, Mavericks and Cleveland Cavaliers by a total of 74 points. They are coming off a 128-100 shellacking at Cleveland on Wednesday. One positive from Wednesday's game was the play of rookie guard Antonio Reeves, who exploded for 34 points in a season-high 40 minutes. The Kentucky product had totaled just 23 points in his first eight games, and wasn't even on the active roster when the Pelicans were swept in a pair of October games at Golden State. But with Zion Williamson, Trey Murphy III, Brandon Ingram, CJ McCollum, Dejounte Murray, Herbert Jones, Jordan Hawkins and Jose Alvarado all out of the lineup, Reeves took advantage of an opportunity coach Willie Green said he worked hard to get. ""It's a credit to (coach) Jodie Meeks and our Birmingham Squadron (G League) team,"" Green insisted. ""(Reeves) coming into the gym every day, getting his shots up, paying attention, and gameplan discipline. It all pays off when you get on the floor."" Already winners of six road games this season, the Warriors have no such health issues. They are missing only De'Anthony Melton, ruled out of the season this week with a partially torn left ACL. Lindy Waters III has stepped into Melton's starting spot and contributed at least two 3-pointers to each of Golden State's last three games. He had 10 points in Wednesday's 120-97 home win over the Atlanta Hawks. Buddy Hield (11 points) and Jonathan Kuminga (10) were among five others who also scored in double figures for the Warriors. They did so off the bench. Keeping them together was a big part in the decision to promote Waters, Warriors coach Steve Kerr noted after Wednesday's win. ""He's a good fit next to that group,"" Kerr said of a starting lineup that includes Stephen Curry, Andrew Wiggins, Draymond Green and Trayce Jackson-Davis. ""I like bringing Buddy off the bench. The bench group has been really good this year. Starting with Lindy allows us to keep the bench intact and gives us another shooter and defender in the starting lineup."" Waters had 21 points as a reserve and Hield 28 as a starter when their roles were reversed in a 124-106 home win over the Pelicans last month that tipped off a two-game, same-site series. Hield (21 points) returned to the bench for the rematch, a 104-89 Golden State triumph that allowed them to complete a sweep without Curry, who was nursing a strained left ankle. -Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.46,0.54

McNealy began the week at the par-70 Seaside Course and fired an 8-under-par 62, with one eagle, six birdies and no bogeys on his card. Thorbjornsen, meanwhile, shot a bogey-free, 8-under 64 at the par-72 Plantation Course. They will switch courses on Friday before everyone who makes the cut plays the Seaside Course on Saturday and Sunday. McNealy and Thorbjornsen are one shot ahead of Andrew Novak, who posted a 7-under 65 at the Plantation Course.

However, a few things are playing in Pittsburgh's favor as Week 12 of the NFL regular season kicks off. Namely, the ""trip"" to Cleveland is a little more than two hours by road and when the Steelers arrive there, they'll be facing a backup quarterback at the helm of a massively underwhelming 2-8 Browns team. The Steelers (8-2) are coming off a huge win over Baltimore to stay atop the AFC North. And Pittsburgh is beginning to set its sights on potential home-field advantage come playoff time.  ODDS AND TRENDS The Steelers are a consensus 3.5-point favorite. That includes at BetRivers, where they have been backed by 80 percent of the spread-line money. Pittsburgh's -195 moneyline to simply win the game has been even more popular, drawing 95 percent of all money wagered. The Browns enter Thursday night having failed to cover the spread in nine of their past 12 games. Meanwhile, the Steelers have covered the spread in every game during their five-game win streak. The 37.0 total points line has seen the Over backed by 65 percent of the money and 70 percent of the total bets. Each of Cleveland's past eight November home games has gone under the total points line. PROP PICKS --Steelers WR George Pickens Over 50 Receiving Yards (-195 at DraftKings): Russell Wilson has thrown six touchdowns in the four games since he took over as the starting quarterback. Two of those have gone to Pickens, who has at least 74 receiving yards in each of those games. There is some concern that Pittsburgh gains a big early lead and turns to a run-heavy attack, but Wilson throws an excellent deep ball and that plays into Pickens' strength. This is the most popular player prop at the book. --Steelers RB Najee Harris Anytime TD (+100 at BetRivers): That potential for a run-heavy approach should benefit Harris, who found the sledding tough against Baltimore with 63 yards on the ground. He was also held out of the end zone for the second time in three games. Keep in mind that Cleveland has allowed only three touchdowns on the ground all season, but the Browns have allowed 12 through the air. Harris has a trio of scores on the ground and receiving through 10 games. KEY STAT The Browns have won the first quarter in five consecutive home games against the Steelers. THE NEWS The Steelers have certainly been locked in. They are currently riding a five-game winning streak, most recently edging the Baltimore Ravens 18-16 on Sunday.   Chris Boswell booted six field goals against Baltimore, while Wilson completed 23 of 36 passes for 205 yards and an interception.   Meanwhile, Cleveland continues to go through the wringer. The Browns ended up on the wrong end of a 35-14 blowout while facing the host New Orleans Saints on Sunday, marking their seventh loss in the past eight games.   Cleveland now has to go up against one of the most unforgiving defenses in the league. Browns quarterback Jameis Winston is determined to direct a fundamentally sound performance against Pittsburgh, which allows the second-fewest points per game in the NFL (16.2).   ""It's precision passing. Getting the ball out on time. Elite operation and just doing our job. It's the simple things,"" Winston said. ""This team (the Steelers) is not going to try and fool you. They're going to line up and say, 'Give us your best, we're going to give you our best.'""   Winston threw for 395 yards and two touchdowns on 30-for-46 passing in the setback against New Orleans, with Jerry Jeudy hauling in six catches for 142 yards and a score. Star running back Nick Chubb continued to struggle since his return from a knee injury that cut his 2023 season short, finishing with 50 yards on 11 carries.   INJURY REPORT The Browns could be without standout defensive end Myles Garrett, who missed practice on Tuesday because of a hip injury. Wide receiver Elijah Moore (shoulder), guard Joel Bitonio (pectoral) and cornerbacks Denzel Ward (ribs/ankle) and Greg Newsome II (shoulder) were among those limited during the session.   Linebacker Alex Highsmith is dealing with an ankle issue and was ruled out by the Steelers along with cornerback Cory Trice Jr. (hamstring). THEY SAID IT Wilson is starting to feel like he might be part of something special, but he also doesn't want Pittsburgh to get ahead of itself.   ""I definitely think that we have a chance (to make a deep playoff run),"" said Wilson, who has played in two Super Bowls. ""I think the biggest thing for us is continuing to just take each week as the most important week of it all.   ""I think that it's not really even just the week, it's just the day, it's just the moments in between. I think the greatest teams, the greatest players, in any sport, especially the teams I've been on, is the moment -- it's never too far away. It's right here, right now. And you're just locked into that."" PREDICTION Divisional road games on short weeks typically shape up as a daunting task. That's not the case for the Steelers, who will be hyper-focused to put this one out of reach early before enjoying 10 days ahead of a trip to Cleveland. With a second game against the Browns before a huge game at Philadelphia, this is not an under-manned opponent Pittsburgh will look past. --Steelers 27, Browns 19   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.26,0.74

The 76ers into Friday's NBA Cup East: Group A matchup against the Nets on a five-game losing streak, including all three in the Sixers' just-completed three-game road trip. The journey ended on Wednesday in a 117-111 loss at Memphis, despite 2023 MVP Joel Embiid playing his best game of the season.  Embiid finished with game highs of 35 points and 11 rebounds in his fourth contest since rejoining the Sixers lineup, after missing the first nine games with a lingering knee injury.  Philadelphia is winless in Embiid's four appearances, have only two wins this season and none in NBA Cup action. The Sixers opened group play with a 111-99 loss to the New York Knicks on Nov. 12, followed by a 98-86 road loss to the Orlando Magic on Nov. 15.  Philadelphia is now also dealing with another knee injury to a key player, as Paul George left Wednesday's game with a hyperextension. ""Similar to the preseason,"" Sixers coach Nick Nurse said, referring to an injury George sustained in October. ""We're going to find out more (Thursday) when (the medical staff) checks it out to see what the extent of it is."" Nurse said George's injury may be akin to a bone bruise, which would not require a lengthy absence. Still, the team is awaiting more details ahead of Friday's return home. ""You never know what happens,"" Nurse said. ""He was actually fairly close to coming back in the game but then it stiffened up as he got out a little bit more, so we decided not to."" Amid the rash of injuries and roster tumult, rookie Jared McCain is emerging as a bright spot in the Sixers' dismal start. Wednesday's 20-point performance marked the guard's sixth consecutive game scoring 20-plus points. McCain has made at least three 3-pointers in all six of those contests, while he averaged 25.5 points. The Nets ended a three-game losing streak Tuesday and improved to 1-1 in the NBA Cup, with a 116-115 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. Cam Johnson scored 34 points, while Trendon Watford hit a jumper with 38 seconds remaining that gave the Nets necessary breathing room down the stretch.  Watford finished with 10 points over 19 minutes in just his second game back from a hamstring injury sustained in training camp. ""Very happy that he had the game that he had, but that to me is the definition of a team,"" Nets coach Jordi Fernandez said. ""Our medical staff worked hard to get him back healthy. We've got to trust the group, because they do a great job, and this is the result. It's a win for everybody."" Nets point guard Dennis Schroder continued his run of solid two-way play at point guard in Tuesday's win. With his 14 points and 12 assists against Charlotte, Schroder is averaging 17.8 points and 6.5 assists in 15 games (all starts). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.33,0.67

Darnold returned to practice after being listed as a limited participant on Wednesday because of a foot injury.  The Vikings (8-2) are anticipating another close matchup with the Bears (4-6), who won a field-goal battle at Minnesota last season while head coach Kevin O'Connell was shuttling quarterbacks in and out of the lineup to replace the injured Kirk Cousins.  That's not a problem these days. After Cousins left for greener pastures in Atlanta, the Vikings signed Darnold to a one-year deal and drafted Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy in the first round. Darnold already has eight wins, beating the 7-10 mark the Vikings cobbled together with a QB room that spun on fast forward from Cousins, Jaren Hall, Nick Mullens, and Joshua Dobbs. ""What we're trying to get from Sam is play the best football of his career,"" O'Connell said.  Darnold is delivering and the Vikings have a three-game winning streak in tow when they arrive at Soldier Field on Sunday. He has posted a 100.0 passer rating in 10 starts. He has completed a career-best 67.9 percent of his passes for 2,387 yards, 19 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. The next touchdown pass will mark a career high for Darnold, who sputtered with the New York Jets and Carolina Panthers before serving as the San Francisco 49ers' backup last season. ""I just feel like, you know -- not talking about past experiences at all -- but I think here it's the detail that we've had ever since OTAs, ever since April,"" Darnold said. ""We've been able to lock in our progressions. Just our feet, our eyes, where they're supposed to be. And just being on time with the concepts. ""If you play like that, it makes the quarterback position a little bit easier."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.41,0.59

The Buckeyes (3-1) routed visiting Evansville 80-30 on Tuesday, outscoring the Purple Aces 52-16 in the second half. It was the fewest points allowed by the Buckeyes since a 59-22 home win over Samford on Nov. 29, 2008. ""We were consistently good defensively against a team that I think has some really good players and some good offensive firepower,"" Ohio State coach Jake Diebler said. ""I was impressed with that. ""I thought it showed great maturity and connectiveness for our team. There is a lot of newness in the program. But I've been impressed with how connected we have been defensively."" Campbell (3-2) will present its own defensive mindset that resulted in an 86-66 road win over Navy on Sunday. ""The consistent on-ball pressure has a way of keeping teams out of rhythm,"" Campbell coach Kevin McGeehan. The Fighting Camels are forcing opponents into 17.8 turnovers per game by going deep into the bench to bring the effort the coach wants. ""There's not much drop-off,"" McGeehan said. ""There's a little bit of a learning curve for us as far as rotation and what's working and how we can use guys in different spots right now, which is natural with any team at the beginning of the year. ""As far as the ability to execute the plan, the ability to bring the defensive fervor and intensity to the situation and establishing our identity defensively, it's a plus."" Campbell will meet three power-conference teams in a season for the first time since 2011-12. The Fighting Camels lost 65-56 at Virginia on Nov. 6 and play at North Carolina on Dec. 29. McGeehan likes the challenges in facing these programs. ""These teams are all physical and tough, and we want to sharpen ourselves and test ourselves again and again and again so we're the team that is imposing that on someone else when we need it the most,"" he said. Jasin Sinani is the only Campell player averaging double figures with 11.6 points per game. He also leads the team with 5.2 rebounds and 28.8 minutes per game. The Buckeyes have three players averaging double figures: Bruce Thornton (13.8), John Mobley Jr. (13.5) and Devin Royal (10.5). Royal also is pulling down a team-best 7.5 rebounds per game, while Thornton is dishing five assists per contest. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.4,0.6

Washington's losing streak began after the Wizards won two in a row to even their record at 2-2. Eight of the nine losses have come by double digits. Washington dropped a 124-104 home decision to Detroit on Sunday, and then had its losing streak reach nine games with Monday's 134-106 setback at New York. The Wizards have allowed at least 120 points in each of their last four games. Following Monday's loss, Washington coach Brian Keefe made it clear he was frustrated with the team's effort in the last two games. ""I'm the leader of this team,"" Keefe said. ""I'm the head coach of this team, so I'll take the responsibility for the last two nights not playing up to the competitive disposition that we should be playing with, especially defensively. That will be addressed as a group and we will get better. But that wasn't what we need to be, what our standards were. And we have to own that. And we have to look at ourselves and we have to get better."" Washington forward Corey Kispert said the Wizards' compete-level has not been where it needs to be. ""It's been a bad few showings for us, and we can deal with losing if we're competitive, (if) we come ready to play,"" Kispert said. ""But (to not) be ready to play at all and (to not) compete, that's absolutely unacceptable."" Washington is 0-1 in NBA Cup play this season. Boston improved its NBA Cup record to 1-1 by beating Cleveland 120-117 on Tuesday. It was Cleveland's first loss after a 15-0 start this season. Boston received a strong performance from 38-year-old center Al Horford on Tuesday. Horford had a season-high 20 points to go with seven rebounds and three blocked shots. He made four 3-pointers and had two blocks late when the Cavaliers were trying to complete a comeback after trailing by 21 points. ""It was just about finishing the job,"" Horford said. ""I felt like we played really well in the first half. In the third, they cut into the lead, and in the fourth they got in there and it was a back-and-forth. It was like, man, we put ourselves in a position, we gotta finish this and see it through."" Boston's Jayson Tatum had 33 points, 12 rebounds, seven assists and two steals during the victory. ""Al is just a calming presence out there,"" Tatum said. ""He just does so many different things for us. Sometimes they show up in the stat sheet and sometimes they don't, but just him being on the court with us helps our spacing, helps our defense. He's such a good passer, willing passer. So we're just a much better team when Al is out there and being aggressive."" The Celtics enter Friday's game on a three-game winning streak and have won five of their last six. Boston is 7-1 in road games this season. Washington is 1-5 at home. Friday's game will be the second meeting between the teams this season. Boston earned a 122-102 road victory on Oct. 24. Boston's Jaylen Brown scored a game-high 27 points in that matchup, which extended Boston's winning streak against Washington to five games. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.31,0.69

Utah's leading scorer, Gabe Madsen, was limited to nine points while going 1-for-10 from 3-point territory. Ezra Ausar topped Utah with 15 points, Mason Madsen scored 14 and Keanu Dawes chipped in with his first career double-double of 13 points and 12 rebounds. The Friday game kicks off a six-game homestand for Utah, which won the first three games of the season by at least 31 points. Utah Tech will take on Utah for just the third time in history. The first game was a 41-26 Utah win in 1928. Much more recently, the Utes won 83-64 on Jan. 9, 2008. The Trailblazers are in the early stages of an eight-game road trip. It began in Wyoming and will include a three-game stop at the Stew Morrill Classic in Missoula, Mont., before continuing on at Portland State, Boise State and Utah State. Tennessee Rainwater led Utah Tech against Wyoming with a career-best 16 points, while Beon Riley (14), Noa Gonsalves (13) and Britton Berrett (12) also had double-digit scoring outings.

Jones read a prepared statement, saying he wanted to make sure he clearly shared the words and sentiment he felt needed to be aired after losing the starting job to former undrafted free agent Tommy DeVito. In his first public comments on the decision made by head coach Brian Daboll after a team meeting on Monday, Jones spoke in the past tense about his time with the Giants (2-8), a strong signal that a professional divorce is imminent. ""The opportunity to play for the New York Giants was truly a dream come true and I am extremely grateful ... for the chance to play here,"" Jones said Thursday. ""The Giants are truly a first-class organization and I have nothing but genuine respect and appreciation for the people who built it and who help carry on the tradition. I've met so many special people and created relationships that will truly last a lifetime. Thank you to all my teammates, coaches and staff that have done so much for me these past six years. There have been some great times, but of course we all wish there had been more of those."" Ranked 32nd among all qualified quarterbacks in passer rating this season, Jones has eight touchdowns and seven interceptions in 2024. He also carries an injury guarantee worth $23 million for this season that the Giants likely don't want to risk paying only to cut ties with him in the offseason. Jones, 27, was a first-round pick in 2019 and signed a four-year, $160 million contract in 2023. He suffered a season-ending ACL tear last season but returned in time to start the season as the No. 1 quarterback. He was benched with a record of 3-13 over his past 16 starts. The remainder of Jones' contract can be partially wiped off the books if he's released before March 2025. ""I take full responsibility for my part in not bringing more wins. No one wanted to win more games worse than me and I gave everything I had on the field and in my preparation,"" Jones continued. ""Of course, this season has been disappointing for all, and of course I wish I could've done more. I'm 100 percent accountable for my part. I did not play well enough, consistently enough help the team get the results. The reality of the NFL is it's hard to win games and requires consistent performance from everyone involved. We didn't do that well enough so the idea to change something happens, and I understand. ""I love the game, I love being part of a team and I'm excited for the next opportunity. I know that there's a lot of good football in front of me and I'm excited about that,"" Jones said. ""To all fans, I have deep respect and appreciation for your passion and love for the Giants. The fans are huge part of what makes playing for the Giants so special."" Asked about his statement being written past-tense, Jones said he's still processing the bigger picture. ""I think I'm still processing and, for now, I'm doing the best I can to help (quarterback) Tommy (DeVito) prepare, help the team prepare. That's what I'm going to do right now. So, processing that,"" Jones said.  ""Obviously, a decision was made and I'm not playing. That's what that was framed as."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.38,0.62

Both USC (5-5, 3-5 Big Ten) and UCLA (4-6, 3-5) are playing for their bowl-game lives. A loss eliminates the Bruins from bowl participation in their first year of Big Ten membership, while falling at UCLA would send the Trojans into their regular-season finale against top 10-ranked Notre Dame needing a victory to land a bowl bid. The winner of the Victory Bowl this year also takes the lead in what has been one of the most competitive stretches in the rivalry's history. The teams are 6-6 over the last 12 meetings dating back to 2012 and have exchanged wins in the last four encounters. The home team has not won since a 52-35 decision for USC in 2019. UCLA continued the run of road wins last season with a 38-20 victory at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, sparked by quarterback Ethan Garbers' three passing touchdowns and a 142-yard rushing effort from running back T.J. Harden. Garbers heads into Saturday's matchup on a run of four consecutive games passing for multiple touchdowns, but his two last week came in UCLA's first loss of that stretch in a 31-19 setback vs. Washington. The Bruins' rushing offense is among the nation's least productive at 85.4 yards per game and regressed to 52 yards last week after posting season-highs of 139 and 211 at Nebraska and vs. Iowa, respectively. ""I would like to see us deal with adverse situations better,"" said Bruins coach DeShaun Foster on Tuesday when asked about injuries on the offensive line. ""We're not going to make excuses. Foster was a UCLA running back from 1998-2001, after he was recruited as a defensive back by USC, and knows all about the cross-town rivalry. ""I'm just glad we have another opportunity to play,"" Foster added. ""This type of game is one that can get us back on track."" A prominent figure on Saturday, who switched sidelines from a season ago, is USC defensive coordinator D'Anton Lynn, who held the same post at UCLA in 2023.  ""The culture defensively within our program has shifted in a lot of ways,"" said Trojans head coach Lincoln Riley, who is 1-1 against the Bruins. ""I'm really proud of how we've progressed schematically. I'm really proud of how we've progressed fundamentally.""  The Trojans' defense is allowing 22 points per game this season under Lynn after surrendering 34.4 per game in 2023.  USC is looking for back-to-back wins for the first time since Weeks 1 and 2 against LSU and Utah State. The Trojans ended their streak of one-possession losses in conference play, having dropped each of the previous five games decided by one score before last week's 28-20 victory over Nebraska. Quarterback Jayden Maiava recovered from an early pick-six in his first career start to go 25-of-35 passing for 259 yards and three touchdowns. He spread the ball to six pass-catchers who had at least receptions, while Woody Marks rushed for 146 yards on 19 carries. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,0,0.54,0.46

Piastri's ""pretty much,"" comment suggests that he is not quite free to operate as he pleases in all circumstances.

""He's made big shots and is a great player,"" Temple coach Adam Fisher said. ""I'd trust him with any shot in the game."" Forward Jamir Watkins has been one of the key cogs behind the strong start for the Seminoles (4-1), whose only loss came against rival Florida last Friday. Watkins had a game-high 17 points in a 79-61 win over Hofstra on Tuesday. He is averaging 18.2 points and 5.4 rebounds per game, including a 30-point effort the last time Florida State was on a neutral court in a 73-65 win over Rice on Nov. 9. Florida State seems to be rediscovering the recipe for success under Leonard Hamilton, in his 23rd season in Tallahassee with eight appearances in the NCAA Tournament to his credit. The Seminoles' defensive play continues to frustrate opponents into numerous turnovers (Hofstra made 20). They are sharing the ball well as 10 Florida State players scored in that game -- nine with five or more points. The Seminoles also were sharp at the free-throw line, making 18 of 23 shots. ""I thought we played aggressively and somewhat disruptively,"" Hamilton said. ""I thought we would always be a free-throw-shooting team and always thought we would be a 3-point-shooting team. It shows that a lot of this is mental."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.38,0.62

Hunter could be the No. 1 pick in the 2025 NFL Draft and is the favorite for the Heisman Trophy.  Speculation about his future quieted as he gained notoriety by the week this season. Field Level Media projects Hunter as a top-three pick in the draft, and he confirmed Thursday this will be his last season at the college level.  ""That's definitely for sure,"" Hunter said on a conference call with reporters.  Hunter is consistently playing between 100 and 125 snaps per game for Colorado. He has three interceptions on defense with 74 receptions, 911 yards and nine touchdowns playing wideout for quarterback Shedeur Sanders. Also a projected early first-round pick, Sanders committed to play in the East-West Shrine Game in Dallas. The son of Colorado head coach and Hall of Fame cornerback Deion Sanders, Shedeur Sanders said Thursday he would cast a Heisman vote for Hunter.  ""If it's between me and him, I would want him to get it,"" Sanders said. ""He does a lot of amazing things and things that haven't been done before. I'm not a selfish guy. I know what he's capable of, so I would rather him win.""  Hunter said he would invite his QB to New York if he's not named a Heisman finalist before they go about the business of finishing the season, possibly in the 12-team College Football Playoff. Shedeur Sanders said he's the best quarterback in the draft, and doesn't believe that's anything new.  ""I feel like I was the best quarterback in the last draft, too,"" said Shedeur Sanders. ""Ever since I was draft eligible, I knew I'm the best quarterback. It's not up for me to prove myself to talking about why."" Former teammates at Jackson State where Deion Sanders also coached, Hunter said he felt his draft stock began to rise only after critics moved past ""the hate"" for his coach. A flashy, charismatic cornerback in the NFL after starring at Florida State, Deion Sanders was the fifth overall pick in the 1989 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons. Hall of Famers Troy Aikman (first, Cowboys), Barry Sanders (third, Lions) and Derrick Thomas (fourth, Chiefs) were chosen ahead of ""Prime Time"" along with offensive tackle Tony Mandarich (second, Packers).  Hunter has picked the brain of Deion Sanders about a dual role in pro sports. Sanders was used selectively as a wide receiver and returned punts but was primarily a cornerback in addition to playing Major League Baseball.  There's no base-stealing in Hunter's future, but he does believe he can push the envelope as a full-time two-way NFL player.  ""It's never been done,"" Hunter said. ""I understand that it will be a high risk, (teams) don't want their top pick to go down too early, and I know they're going to want me to be in a couple packages. But I believe I can do it. Nobody has stopped me from doing it thus far. I like when people tell me I can't do it."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,0,0.55,0.45

Brown, promoted to offensive coordinator last week after Shane Waldron was fired, found some success last Sunday when Williams drove the Bears into position for a game-winning field goal that was blocked in a 20-19 loss to the Green Bay Packers.  What showed up on film when Williams and Brown huddled to review Week 11 was a tad different from the on-field results. Williams -- the No. 1 pick in the 2024 draft still feeling his way through the gradual progression of a franchise quarterback -- said the ""simplified"" offense isn't one that was whittled down to aid understanding. Rather, Brown brought such a finite degree of detail and thought to each play that his call sheet eventually will become a reference point with tens of dozens of subcontext for Williams to sort in real time.  ""We didn't reinvent the wheel for those three or four days that Thomas became the offensive coordinator and play caller,"" Williams said. ""I think the decisiveness, all of that came from our meetings and how we're going to do things. It came from being able to get play calls in faster and being able to get up there and not feel like you're rushed or not feel like you need to hurry up and get the ball snapped. ""All of these small things -- details of routes, details of the blocking, details of the path of running backs and how we're going to do things -- I think that led into all of what happened last week. We didn't come out with the win, but how we played efficiently and physically, that leads into it."" Fellow rookie and top-10 pick Rome Odunze felt like he was back at Washington for moments because of the rapidity with which Brown got calls to Williams, who relayed them to the huddle and hurried the team to the line of scrimmage with a newfound command.  There was a different type of clarity and confidence eminating from Brown down through the offensive chain of command on the field.  ""As wide receivers, we're kind of looking at the defense as well and reading those things along with Caleb. So understanding what kind of coverage look we're getting and what technique the DBs are playing on us allows us to kind of build a plan for that snap. Same thing with Caleb,"" Odunze said. ""He just has to do it at a higher level. So it helps us all."" Veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen said that in hindsight, the wheels started coming off for the Bears in training camp. In his opinion, Waldron was ""too nice,"" and he allowed mistakes and lack of detail and focus to become accepted.  ""That's football and that's life,"" Odunze said. ""Doing the little things right will eventually show on a bigger stage."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,0,0.58,0.42

Mitch Mascari added 15 points. Nijel Pack led Miami (3-1) with 17 points and five assists. Matthew Cleveland and Jalen Blackmon added 12 points each.

Drake's new coach Ben McCollum, who won four national titles at NCAA Division II power at Northwest Missouri State between 2017 and 2022, engineered Thursday's upset. He did it with four starters he brought over from his former program -- Stirtz, Abreu, Mascari and Isaiah Jackson. The fifth starter is Wyoming transfer Cam Manyawu. Drake get off to a 7-0 start against the Hurricanes, and the Bulldogs kept rolling for a 36-27 advantage at the break.

Coach Jon Scheyer is bringing in a quartet of five-star recruits, headlined by Cameron Boozer, the No. 2 overall prospect in the 2025 class and son of Duke legend Carlos Boozer. He is joined by No. 15 Shelton Henderson (Bellaire High in Bellaire, Texas), No. 19 Nikolas Khamenia (Harvard-Westlake High, Los Angeles) and No. 21 Cayden Boozer, Cameron's twin. The Boozers play at Columbus High School in Miami. Cayden Boozer is a guard, and the others are forwards. Scheyer said Thursday that this group falls in line with the way he's trying to build the program since taking over from his mentor, Mike Krzyzewski. ""Individually with each of these guys, we're thrilled to get them here, but for me, it's the makeup of the class that I'm so excited about,"" he said. ""There's really two main things we look for in this class and ... the first thing is competitiveness. And when you think about Shelton Henderson, when you think about Cayden Boozer, when you think about Nik Khamenia, when you think about Cam Boozer, the word competitiveness comes to mind with all four of those guys. That was really important to us and how we continue to build the program. How we continue to move this thing forward is bring in high-level competitors.  ""The second thing for us is feel or basketball instincts, and when combine their competitiveness and you combine their IQ and feel for the game, that's been the recipe for some of our most special teams here."" Scheyer, who became Duke's head coach ahead of the 2022-23 season, signed the top class in 2022 and 2024 and the No. 2 class in the in-between year. The players already have achieved success in their careers. The Boozers played on three consecutive Florida state high school champions and also won gold medals in U16 and U17 competitions with USA Basketball. Khamenia won back-to-back state titles, and he and Henderson were members of the gold-medal winning U18 team at the FIBA AmeriCup over the summer.

The Tar Heels (2-1) are among the main attractions at the eight-team event in Maui, which also includes two-time reigning national champion UConn. Before North Carolina begins the tournament Monday against another 2024 NCAA Tournament team, Dayton, the Tar Heels contend with an undefeated Hawaii team on the island of Oahu. ""Getting on that time zone is important for us,"" North Carolina coach Hubert Davis said before making the trek to Hawaii. The matchup with the Rainbow Warriors tips off at 7:30 p.m. local time, which is a 12:30 a.m. Saturday morning tip on Eastern Time. Davis hopes for a similar outcome to the 2016-17 season when he was an assistant to North Carolina coach Roy Williams. The Tar Heels won 83-68 at Hawaii that year before rolling to the Maui Invitational crown and ultimately winning the program's sixth national championship. The 2024-25 Tar Heels again harbor aspirations of cutting down the nets both in Maui and at the Final Four with a roster built around All-American RJ Davis and freshman phenom turned standout sophomore Elliot Cadeau. The backcourt tandem paces an explosive offense that has produced at least 89 points in each of its first three games. Hawaii (4-0), meanwhile, has yet to allow more than 69 points in any of its first four outings. The Warriors feature a new-look lineup compared to a season ago when they won 20 games for a second consecutive campaign. The group is not lacking for experience, however. Big man Tanner Christensen, averaging a team-leading 17.5 points per game along with 6.5 rebounds, came to Hawaii from Utah Tech and Idaho, with 93 career starts. Christensen was named Big West Conference Player of the Week on Monday following a 25-point performance in Sunday's 73-68 overtime win versus Weber State. Christensen's frontcourt mate, Gytis Nemeiksa, played significant minutes last season at Xavier. He is averaging 11.3 points and a team-high 6.8 rebounds per game this season. Their strong interior play is a shift from coach Eran Ganot's previous teams that at times relied on 3-point shooting. Hawaii is shooting 51.4 percent overall but just 27.8 percent from deep. ""I know people can easily say teams or players live and die by the (3-pointer) just because it's an easy way to go to, but that's never been us,"" Ganot told the ""Marching to Madness"" podcast this week. ""I'm encouraged that we can find ways to have some success, especially late in games."" The Rainbow Warriors limited Weber State to 22.2 percent shooting (4 of 18) from behind the arc. None of their first four opponents made more than six 3-pointers.

Those numbers mean very different things to the programs.   The Tigers have been ranked as high as No. 8, but enter the week unranked for the first time this season after losing three straight games.   The Commodores, who were winless in the SEC last season and three times in the last four seasons, are excited about being bowl eligible with a marquee win to celebrate. Vandy claimed the program's first victory ever against a No. 1-ranked team by beating Alabama.   Vanderbilt's surge moved head coach Clark Lea from the proverbial hot seat to coach of the year candidacy. He will be facing Brian Kelly, his former boss when Lea was defensive coordinator at Notre Dame.   The heat was turned up on Kelly after a 27-16 loss at Florida last Saturday.    ""You have to examine everything that you do on a day-to-day basis and make sure that you're addressing those things that are most important to getting the right outcomes,"" Kelly said. ""When you don't get the right outcomes immediately it's going to be, take this action, do this, bench this guy, fire that guy. For us it's much more about understanding that we have a process in place. We have to stick with that process.""   The Commodores' success led to Lea being named one of five finalists for the American Football Coaches Association Coach of the Year on Tuesday.   ""We're proud of the progress we've made,"" Lea said, ""but we're not satisfied.""   Vanderbilt, which lost 28-3 to visiting South Carolina two weeks ago, used an open date last week to let several players who were ""banged up"" heal, most notably star quarterback Diego Pavia, who has a lower leg injury but is expected to start against LSU.   ""This is a great identity game where we need to be really good in all three phases,"" Lea said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.23,0.77

The Bears are vying to keep those good vibes going into their next Big 12 test at Houston on Saturday.   Baylor (6-4, 4-3 Big 12) outgunned West Virginia 49-35 last week to continue its turnaround from a 2-4 start. That same day, a school spokesperson said Aranda -- whose Bears went 6-7 and 3-9 in the two seasons since winning the 2021 Big 12 title and the Sugar Bowl -- will return next season.   ""I feel like they've had my back the whole way,"" Aranda said Monday of the endorsement.   Sawyer Robertson threw for a career-high 329 yards and three touchdowns against West Virginia. Bryson Washington racked up 123 rushing yards, five receptions for 59 yards and four total touchdowns -- his second straight game with four.   ""There's some good energy and confidence right now with the team,"" Aranda said. ""For sure, they see the challenge ahead with a really strong Houston team, I want to say defensively particularly. Their front is probably the best that we've played or that we're gonna play.""   Averaging 45.8 points per game during its winning streak, the Bears are trying to tighten things up defensively. They've allowed a hefty 33 points per game in the same stretch.  But the Bears might get a breather with Houston ranked second-to-last in the FBS in scoring at 14.0 points per game.   The Cougars (4-6, 3-4) fell 27-3 to Arizona last Friday and now must win out to become bowl-eligible. That means beating both Baylor and BYU, which is No. 14 in the College Football Playoff rankings after losing to Kansas. ""I don't talk about it much,"" Houston coach Willie Fritz said. ""I just want to play as good as we can against Baylor. That's all I'm worried about. ... This is a really good team that's on a good roll right now. They're playing excellent on offense.""   To illustrate the struggles of Houston's passing game, Zeon Chriss' 191 passing yards in the loss to Arizona marked the Cougars' second-best team total since Sept. 14. On three occasions, Houston has failed to hit 100 passing yards.   Baylor and Houston played last year for the first time since 1995.

When the Razorbacks avoid turnovers and sacks, they win. When opponents make them cough up the ball and get to quarterback Taylen Green, as Texas did last week in a 20-10 decision, Arkansas loses. At 5-5 and needing a win to become bowl-eligible, the Razorbacks seek the mistake-free version of themselves Saturday in Fayetteville when Louisiana Tech visits for a non-conference contest. Arkansas has allowed 20 sacks in four Southeastern Conference losses, including six last week. It also gave up a pair of crushing turnovers, including a fumble by freshman CJ Brown after his first career catch deep in Texas territory with 6:55 left. The Razorbacks never saw the ball again. ""That's kind of been the story of all our losses and all our wins, you know, depending on what we do with turnovers,"" Arkansas coach Sam Pittman said. Green has thrown for 2,363 yards and 11 touchdowns but has also tossed eight interceptions and hung on to the ball too long at times. ""That's one thing in my game that I have to be better at,"" he said. Meanwhile, the Bulldogs (4-6) kept their bowl hopes alive with a 12-7 Conference USA win at Western Kentucky, which was 5-0 in the league. Buck Buchanan hit four field goals for Louisiana Tech and the defense held the high-powered Hilltoppers to just 215 total yards. Third-year coach Sonny Cumbie said his team persevered after enduring adversity most of the season. ""I talked to our team about being uncommon,"" he said. ""They have an uncommon fight and grit.

And in a season that began with the Red Raiders and Cowboys plotting a big impact in the new-look Big 12 Conference, they're both surprised to be here. But that's the backdrop when they meet after notable missteps by the Red Raiders. The season has been unraveling for most of the last two months for the Cowboys. Neither team is in contention for the conference championship game with two weeks to go.  Texas Tech (6-4, 4-3) has dropped three of its last four league games after a promising start. Oklahoma State (3-7, 0-7) is pushing to the finish of its worst season since coach Mike Gundy's debut in 2005. ""I'm as frustrated as anybody else,"" said Red Raiders coach Joey McGuire, who has guided his team to a third straight bowl-eligible season in his third season. ""It's frustrating to me the opportunities that we've let get away because we haven't been good enough on game day."" Gundy can certainly relate. The Cowboys finish with a losing record for just the second time in his 20-year tenure and an 18-year bowl game streak won't make it to 19.  Ranked in the preseason Top 25, Oklahoma State began the season 3-0 with a solid victory against Arkansas but a wave of injuries has yielded seven losses in a row - four by 21 points or more.  The Cowboys lost defensive starters Collin Olliver, Nick Martin and Cameron Epps to season-ending injuries. They head into Saturday ranked last in the Big 12 in total defense, allowing just a tick under 500 yards a game, and next-to-last in scoring defense with foes averaging 31.9 points.  Texas Tech is the only team that has given up more points: 35.1 per game. The Red Raiders have been effective with the ball in their hands. They rank second in the league with 441 yards per contest and are the Big 12's highest-scoring offense at 35.5 points a game. So the challenge is daunting for the Cowboys, who hit mid-November playing out the string for the first time since Gundy took over. But Gundy expects his team's effort to be at the same level the program has expected since he grabbed the reins at his alma mater and built one of the most consistent programs in the Big 12. ""It's competition, same thing that I would say each week, and that when these guys walk on campus, they should be committed to themselves and to the team and then to whoever helped get them here and their family, or whoever raised them and put a lot into them,"" Gundy said. ""The most important thing that they can do is continue to train and work and stay together and compete, which they have."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.44,0.56

Wisconsin coach Luke Fickell wasn't expecting to fire the Badgers' play-caller.   But that's the situation as Fickell's Badgers get ready to meet the Cornhuskers on Saturday afternoon in Lincoln, Neb.   Fickell dismissed offensive coordinator Phil Longo on Sunday, the day after Wisconsin lost to No. 1 Oregon 16-13 in Madison, Wis. The Badgers (5-5, 3-4 Big Ten) led 13-6 with 4:43 left in the third quarter, but produced only 21 yards on four possessions -- punt, punt, downs, interception -- in the fourth quarter and failed to add to the lead.   Oregon scored a tying touchdown and kicked a game-winning field goal with 2:36 to play.   As much as Fickell didn't sound interested in talking about Longo's departure, it was a prime topic. He emphasized that it was time for the program to ""move forward.""   ""It's not about play calls, it's not about points scored, it's not about touchdowns. It's moving forward with leadership, and that's, to me, what we have to do and why we're doing it right now,"" said Fickell, who is in his third year at Wisconsin and brought in before Longo last season.   The Badgers are averaging 23.9 points per game and have lost three games in a row while scoring 36 total points.   They've also played most of the season with backup quarterback Braedyn Locke running the offense. Starter Tyler Van Dyke went down with a knee injury in Week 3 against Alabama. Locke has been inconsistent at best, completing 55 percent of his passes for 1,514 yards. He has an equal number of interceptions as touchdowns (9).   Then there's Holgorsen, a head coach for 13 seasons who most recently ran the show at Houston from 2019-23. Nebraska head coach Matt Rhule brought Holgorsen in during the Cornhuskers' bye week to get his thoughts about the offense.   ""(Rhule) said, 'Just come try to figure this out, I need your help.' I was grateful to him for saying, 'I need your help,' I think a great deal of him. I think a great deal of this program, so I was excited to jump on it,"" Holgorsen said.   Apparently impressed with the newcomer's perspective, Rhule installed him as offensive coordinator. His predecessor, Marcus Satterfield, is working as tight ends coach.   Holgorsen's debut couldn't prevent the Cornhuskers (5-5, 2-5) from losing their fourth straight game, 28-20, at Southern California. The hosts led 21-20 before extending their lead with 2:09 to play.   Freshman quarterback Dylan Raiola then led Nebraska on a 13-play, 56-yard drive. On first-and-15 at the USC 19 with five seconds left, Raiola was picked off in the endzone.   ""We left a lot out there offensively,"" Rhule said. ""The offense is at some point here going to really take off with the kind of direction we're headed.""

Can they find","Disappointments and down seasons are nothing new for the Cleveland Browns, but the team’s current state feels uniquely grim. A sense of permanence surrounds the franchise's struggles, exacerbated by the acquisition of quarterback Deshaun Watson. His fully guaranteed contract has become an anchor weighing down the organization, with no feasible escape in sight. Watson has shown flashes of potential in his three seasons with Cleveland, but for the most part, his tenure has been a sobering reminder of the team’s bleak outlook. With a championship-caliber defense, there was hope last season that head coach Kevin Stefanski and general manager Andrew Berry had found a path forward. That optimism spiked after the late-season signing of veteran Joe Flacco, who came out of retirement to deliver a surprisingly strong December. Flacco reinvigorated the offense, which at times looked unstoppable. But the momentum fizzled when offseason decisions were made. The Browns opted for continuity, betting on a healthy Watson to return to form after his season-ending surgery. Instead, Cleveland has been plagued by injuries on the offensive line, a punchless running game without Nick Chubb, and a passing attack hampered by Watson’s inconsistency. Watson’s inability to find Amari Cooper—or anyone else for that matter—has left the Browns’ offense lifeless. Cooper might as well be Alice Cooper, Michael Cooper, or even Mark Cooper from Hangin’ with Mr. Cooper. The results have been that disappointing. In October, Watson suffered another season-ending injury, leaving Cleveland with a 1-6 record under his leadership and little reason for optimism. The quarterback, once heralded for his elite skills, now resembles a rusted-out Chevette after too many rebuilds. Oddly enough, Watson’s absence seemed to relieve some of the offense’s pressure. Stefanski no longer had to claim Watson gave the Browns the best chance to win. The team responded by shocking the Baltimore Ravens in one of the season’s most unexpected upsets. But the magic Stefanski found with Flacco is long gone. Jameis Winston, now at the helm, is playing with purpose, but he’s steering a makeshift operation. Even the team’s own personnel seem to lack faith in the Browns’ chances. The weight holding Cleveland back remains Watson’s guaranteed contract. The financial commitment is a burden the Browns can’t escape without hamstringing the franchise for years. Berry may publicly express confidence in Watson’s ability to rebound, but it’s hard to believe he sees the quarterback as capable of leading Cleveland to consecutive wins, let alone an AFC North title. Berry’s fingerprints are all over this roster, and until the Watson problem is resolved, the Browns are stuck paddling a sinking ship, knowing no amount of effort can deliver real progress.

Journalist Matt Shea was set to interview Paul in Puerto Rico for BBC’s new documentary, “Logan Paul: Bad Influence?” which claims to have new evidence regarding accusations that Paul promoted shady cryptocurrency projects without disclosing that he had a stake in them, resulting in massive paychecks.  Shea finally got his chance to interview Paul at his gym. At least he thought. Instead, when he arrived, he was met by a well-known imposter, Rodney Petersen, who does look a little bit like Paul. Petersen sat down for the interview and acted exactly like Paul. Shea asked the lookalike several questions before calling out that it wasn't Paul, including what it feels like to be one of the most famous people in the world. “I have to say, the real Logan Paul looks very different,” Shea interrupted, visibly irritated. Shea refused to proceed with the interview, as Petersen insisted on keeping the prank going for a little bit longer. “You came all the way to Puerto Rico from England. This is your interview. What do you got?” Shea still refused, and as he was about to get up out of his chair, a few “protestors” began repeatedly chanting anti-BBC remarks in reference to Huw Edwards, a former newscaster who was charged with three counts of making indecent images of children. The full clip on Paul's YouTube channel is quite the watch, and you could tell that Shea was completely mind-blown over the stunt. Shea maintains that this was childish behavior from Paul. And while that might be somewhat true, what in the world did he actually expect?  The title of the documentary literally references exposing Paul, so why on Earth would he ever help him with that or be a part of a hit piece against him?  To maintain his innocence? According to a source, the allegations that the BBC presented Paul and his team with were a regurgitation of claims he has already denied. Paul explains in his YouTube video that it's infuriating for a network with such a checkered past to try and attack his character, business practices, ethics and morals in the way that they did when they’ve done so little to address their own wrongdoings and those of the individuals they employ. Paul laid out several instances where the BBC employed individuals that have been both accused and found guilty of pedophilia, possessing child pornography, harassment, assault and rape.  The ultimate get back? He donated $50,000 to the Inspiring Children Foundation, an organization that lifts up underprivileged youth.  Paul seems pretty convinced that he did nothing wrong in this entire situation. And to troll a major news outlet, he must be pretty confident in his innocence. This is a classic prank. Hit him with the lookalike Jim Halpert from The Office. There’s nothing to be mad about here. Chalk it up to the game. Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.34,0.66

That game coached by Duke's Mike Krzyzewski and Arizona's Lute Olson on Feb. 24, 1991, went into double overtime and the Wildcats outlasted Duke 103-96. The late Bison Dele, then known as Brian Williams, led Arizona with 24 points. Duke featured Bobby Hurley (who now coaches Arizona's archrival, Arizona State), Grant Hill and Christian Laettner. It's a series dotted by big games in history. After that 1991 game, the teams split four neutral-site games -- including Duke beating the Wildcats in the 2000-01 national championship game -- before Arizona defeated the Blue Devils 78-73 last season at Durham, N.C. Arizona has a 6-4 edge in the series that dates to 1961. ""Friday sets up to be an epic night for early-season college basketball,"" Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd said. Duke coach Jon Scheyer, who played for Krzyzewski with the Blue Devils, said he had Arizona among his three finalists when he was recruited by Olson in 2001. He was in the stands in Minneapolis when Duke beat Arizona in the national title game. ""I remember being at that game and wanting to play games like that -- and then Lute Olson recruited me,"" Scheyer said. ""Arizona was one of my final three schools. So, personally, I have a lot of respect for Arizona, the program that they have, and Tommy."" Friday's game, completing the home-and-home arrangement, pits the Blue Devils (3-1) with freshman Cooper Flagg, projected to be the No. 1 overall pick in the next NBA draft, against the Wildcats (2-1). Arizona is led by preseason All-American fifth-year guard Caleb Love. Love has a personal rivalry with Duke, having played three years at North Carolina before transferring to Arizona last season. He scored 28 points when North Carolina eliminated Duke in the 2022 Final Four. Love's performance in a 103-88 loss last Friday at Wisconsin mirrored that of the Wildcats' struggles, scoring only six points on 2-of-13 shooting from the field before fouling out with 4:57 left. The Wildcats never led and their perimeter defense allowed Wisconsin 12 shots from 3-point range. John Tonje burned Arizona with 41 points. ""I'm not interested in going undefeated, not at all,"" Lloyd said. ""Our program's ready to take the next step and I'm ready to lead the charge. We've got to coach better. We've got to play better. ""We're going to go back, take a breath, get home, and, and we're excited for the opportunity we got (against Duke)."" Duke had the opportunity to reset itself after losing to Kentucky 77-72 at Atlanta on Nov. 12. The Blue Devils defeated Wofford 86-35 at home last weekend. Tyrese Proctor led a balanced scoring effort with 15 points. Flagg had nine rebounds with eight points, six assists, three steals and two blocked shots. ""A great bounce-back game,"" Scheyer said. ""I am really proud of how we shared the ball (season-high 24 assists on 30 made field goals). We've talked a lot about the process of the season, how no matter what, win or lose, how you respond is really important."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.26,0.74

No. 20 Arkansas accomplished the feat during Monday's 91-72 home win against Pacific and will try to maintain the intensity during Friday night's game in Fayetteville, Ark., against in-state foe Little Rock. Arkansas (3-1) scored 25 of the game's final 36 points to pull away from Pacific and win consecutive games for the first time this season. ""I mean, we trust our defense,"" Boogie Fland said. ""... So (we're) just staying disciplined and making adjustments throughout the game."" Injuries to frontcourt veterans Trevon Brazile and Jonas Aidoo presented a challenge to the Razorbacks' depth. Only seven Arkansas players saw action, logging between 22 and 35 minutes. While the team's frenetic style took a toll on the Tigers, the Razorbacks ultimately felt just fine. Arkansas shot 59.6 percent from the field and produced four scorers in double figures. Adou Thiero led the way with 23 points and matched Johnell Davis for the team high with six rebounds. ""We just wanted to come out and have fun and show our grit on defense and just let that carry us,"" Thiero said. ""Offensively we were just trying to let the game come to us and find each other open shots."" The Razorbacks hope to spread the wealth not only in the flow of the game, but within the rotation as they await the return of Brazile and Aidoo. ""You're trying to have fun. You want those guys back so they can get some time,"" Fland said. ""It's a team sport and just everybody doing it together because we love each other. We're wishing they come back faster and going with the flow."" Little Rock improved to 2-2 on a six-game road trip with Wednesday's 71-57 victory at Tulsa. The Trojans (3-2) outscored the Golden Hurricane 51-32 after halftime, shooting a blazing 19-for-27 (70.4 percent) from the floor after the break. Little Rock forced Tulsa into 33.3 percent shooting after halftime, including 4 of 20 from long range, heeding the guidance of its coach, Darrell Walker. ""Coach just told us at halftime to be aggressive and keep boxing out and guard our tails off,"" said Jonathan Lawson, who scored 16 of his game-high 23 points down the stretch in the second half. Lawson added seven rebounds and five assists. Isaiah Lewis scored 17 points, Mwani Wilkinson had 16 points and nine rebounds, and Ante Beljan had 11 points.

Gators coach Todd Golden would prefer for his team to play a full 40 minutes, though, starting with Friday night's home game against Southern Illinois in Gainesville, Fla. Florida (5-0) led 46-22 at halftime and appeared to be on its way to a 40- or 50-point stomping of the Rattlers. But the Gators shot only 34 percent from the field in the second half and sent the visitors to the foul line 19 times. It is little wonder that Golden wasn't thrilled with how his team closed the game. ""Our expectation is to be able to play two complete halves, a full 40 minutes,"" he said. ""I thought we played 20 really good minutes into the first half and we were just OK in the second ... a lot to improve on. ""We allowed (missed shots) to affect our defense a little bit in the second half, and we fouled way too much on the defensive end. I just thought in the second half we let our foot off the gas."" The Gators haven't played a demanding schedule but have taken care of business, outscoring opponents by an average of nearly 20 points per game. They've scored at least 81 points in every contest. Five players are averaging double figures in points for Florida, led by guard Walter Clayton Jr. at 18.4 per game. Will Richard (15), Florida Atlantic transfer Alijah Martin (13.6), Alex Condon (12.2) and Chattanooga transfer Sam Alexis (10) also are consistent offensive threats. If there's a weakness in the Gators' attack, it's 3-point shooting, which stands at 28.9 percent for the season. But Richard and Martin, each of whom are under 27 percent, have proved capable from the arc during their careers. While Florida looks to play 40 consistent minutes, the Salukis (2-2) will try to carry the form from Monday night's 69-44 rout of North Dakota State into the first of four straight games away from Carbondale. They held the high-scoring Bison to 26.5 percent shooting from the field, including 5 of 27 from the 3-point line. First-year Southern Illinois coach Scott Nagy, who has won 579 games in a 30-year career that's included stops at South Dakota State and Wright State, said the week away from home will be beneficial to his squad. After the game at Florida, Southern Illinois will journey to a three-game, three-day tournament in Estero, Fla. ""We're one of the harder teams to prepare for because we don't run many sets,"" Nagy said. ""Can we focus on the next game?

It won't be an easy task against a Houston program that has consistently been among the nation's best in the Kelvin Sampson era. The Cougars rank in the top five nationally in both offensive and defensive rating in the kenpom.com stats as they've started 2-1, with their loss coming to an Auburn team that also ranks top five in both metrics.  ""We have another great opportunity Friday night,"" Claxton said. ""We're not going to sneak up on them. I know Sampson is going to have them ready to go out there and compete and play hard, but we're going to do the same thing."" Houston's wins have come in dominant fashion. The Cougars beat Jackson State 97-40 in their season opener and enter Friday's game after a 91-45 win Wednesday over Louisiana, with the 74-69 loss to then-No. 11 Auburn sandwiched in between. The Cougars again are a deep team, with seven players averaging at least eight points per game. Three different players have led the team in scoring in each of the first three games.  ""The thing that we've always been good at here is bringing our team along,"" Sampson said. ""We're not trying to be the best team in the country on November the 5th, or 10th. Or come out breathing fire and not have a slow start. That's all part of the process. When you win by (that much), it's because of defense."" Houston's engine to this point has been Milos Uzan, who is averaging 10.3 points and a team-high 6.3 assists per game. Uzan also has been a factor on defense with an average of 2 steals per game. J'Wan Roberts and L.J. Cryer average a team-best 12.3 points per game.  Claxton is looking to take Hofstra (4-1) to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since back-to-back berths in 2000 and 2001, when Jay Wright coached the Pride.  Claxton, the point guard on the 2000 tournament team, has led Hofstra to 20-plus wins in his first three seasons on the sideline. The Pride enter Friday's game coming off their first loss of the season, 79-61 against Florida State.  Hofstra beat Iona by 14 and UMass in overtime by four, with a 49-48 win over Seton Hall in the middle. They also won their season opener 89-62 over Division III foe SUNY Old Westbury.  Iona transfer Jean Aranguren leads Hofstra in all three major statistical categories, averaging 18 points, 6.8 rebounds and 4.8 assists per game. He nearly notched a triple-double in Hofstra's 14-point win over his former team, scoring 18 points while tallying nine rebounds and nine assists.  Claxton and Hofstra aren't strangers to the environment in Houston, either. The Pride took a then-No. 15 Houston team to overtime in Claxton's first game as head coach, losing 83-75 in the 2021-22 season.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.29,0.71

Welcome to an election year, folks. Six NFL teams will go at it on Thanksgiving, with the Detroit Lions hosting the Chicago Bears, the New York Giants visiting the Dallas Cowboys and the Miami Dolphins hitting the road to face the Green Bay Packers. This isn’t Christmas, but allow us to put on our cap and nightgown like Ebenezer Scrooge once did so that we can take a trip back to the past to relive some of Turkey Day’s best games. Someone should have suggested putting a body on Randy Moss, no? Moss finished with only three catches—they just all happened to be touchdowns of at least 51 yards for a grand total of 163 yards on the day. The only question is, what type of disastrous performance does Dallas have in store for us this year? Six passing touchdowns. Count ‘em. Six. That’s how many Indianapolis signal-caller Peyton Manning had against the Lions to match a Thanksgiving Day record. However, he wasn’t necessarily spreading out the wealth, as three of those scores went to Marvin Harrison and the other three went to Brandon Stokley. Making the performance that much more impressive was the fact that Manning had all of his TD passes in the first three quarters. Surprisingly, Detroit outgained the Colts 386-356. Tom Brady threw for 323 yards and three touchdowns while rushing for a fourth, but it was New York quarterback Mark Sanchez who stole the spotlight—for all the wrong reasons. Early in the second quarter, Sanchez tried to scramble on a busted play and failed miserably, running into his own offensive line. The ball came free when Sanchez collided with Brandon Moore, and thus the “butt fumble” was born.  New England scooped up the ball and scored on the play, adding insult to injury. Bad day to be a Jets fan. Before there was Manning, there was Miami’s Bob Griese. Griese was the first one to throw for six touchdowns on Thanksgiving, and he helped the Dolphins hang 55 points, a record for the holiday at the time. Plenty of quarterbacks have come and gone for Miami since Griese was under center. Tua Tagovailoa is now the guy, and six TD passes is never out of the question with playmakers like Tyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle and De’Von Achane alongside him. No game on Thanksgiving had ever gone to overtime until this one, but fans didn’t end up getting all that much extra football. Dave Williams found the end zone on a 95-yard return on the opening kickoff of OT, with his fellow Bears rushing out onto the gridiron as he reached midfield during the play. Chicago had trailed 17-3 in the third quarter. Don’t be expecting the Bears to pull off big plays like this nowadays, though.   Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.47,0.53

Not only did Knecht go 9 of 12 (75 percent) from long distance Tuesday, he is 21 of 31 (67.8 percent) over the past four games.

Orlando held its opponents under 100 points in every game of the winning run before the Clippers eclipsed the century mark. Second-year guard Anthony Black is starting to come into his own, with five double-digit scoring games in his last eight contests. He had a team-best 17 points Wednesday and a season-high 20 in a 109-99 road victory over the Phoenix Suns on Monday. Black averaged 4.6 points last season, is up to 9.0 this season and has averaged 11.3 points in his last eight games. He also has 17 assists over his last two games.

The Raiders' season-defining skid began with a 34-18 loss to the Broncos in Denver on Oct. 6. They've yet to recover.  The losses haven't been within a touchdown for Las Vegas (2-8), save for a five-point setback to the Los Angeles Rams on Oct. 20 in which it trailed 20-6 before making three straight field goals to make the final score look a bit more competitive.  The Broncos (6-5), on the other hand, have been a pleasant surprise.  Expectations for Bo Nix's rookie year weren't exactly through the roof, but the outlook has changed with the quarterback's recent performance. Nix has thrown 2,275 yards so far this season in addition to 14 touchdowns. Over the past two games, Nix has 522 passing yards with six touchdowns and zero interceptions. ""It's hard to pick out specific things (that he's doing well),"" Broncos coach Sean Payton said. ""I mean, we're blocking well. I think we have balance. I say this all the time, your allies at that position are your defense. He's certainly settled in third down (and) red zone. ""You're learning each week and then pretty soon you're like, I belong here. It's clear (Nix) belongs here."" For Nix, his performance earned him his first career AFC Player of the Week honor.  ""It's a great honor,"" Nix said. ""It's a great responsibility, but at the same time, it doesn't end with just that. You obviously got to go back, continue, and they only remember your last game. You got to go out there and continue to do it. ""It's a great honor. Many great players have won the award in the past. It's an honor to be included and be that recipient, but there's a lot of work left to be done."" Las Vegas starter Gardner Minshew hasn't had the same success recently.  Minshew has just eight passing touchdowns and nine interceptions, and his tally of 1,783 yards for the season ranks a lackluster 24th overall among starting quarterbacks.  The Raiders' ground attack hasn't been much of a help either, as the team ranks last in the league with 75.2 rushing yards per game.  Las Vegas also is nursing several injuries, including a shoulder injury to cornerback Jakorian Bennett. He sustained the injury during the first quarter of the Raiders' 34-19 loss to the Miami Dolphins last Sunday. ""It's one of the ones you've got to just swallow, you've got to take it,"" Las Vegas coach Antonio Pierce said. ""There's been some non-contact injuries. There's been guys getting rolled up. Think about the Cincinnati Bengals game, you get six guys with ankle injuries, that's kind of unheard of. ""Just been having some bad breaks, but nobody feels sorry for us. Nobody feels sorry for me. You've got to roll out there with 11 players, and that's what we're going to do come Sunday.""  In addition to Bennett, fellow cornerbacks Jack Jones (back) and Nate Hobbs (ankle), running backs Alexander Mattison (ankle) and Zamir White (quadricep), tight ends Harrison Bryant (ankle) and Justin Shorter (illness), and center Andre James (ankle) did not participate in practice on Wednesday.  As for the Broncos, guard Ben Powers (shoulder) did not practice on Wednesday.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.38,0.62

Thomas quarterbacked the team's top power-play unit, earned an assist and played more than 23 minutes in St. Louis' 4-2 loss to the Minnesota Wild.  Losers of six of their last seven games (1-5-1), the Blues will try to get back on track Thursday night when they host the San Jose Sharks. ""We've got to work harder to get the puck back, as a group, as a whole, as a team, if we want to have the puck more and create more offense,"" Blues coach Drew Bannister said. ""That's the No. 1 thing for our guys right now going into the game against San Jose. ""We just have to be more committed to working harder, doing the right things to get the puck so we can go on the offense."" Bannister reunited Thomas with Jordan Kyrou and Pavel Buchnevich against the Wild while trying to spark more offense 5-on-5. ""I felt good,"" Thomas said. ""My timing was a little bit off. I started getting more comfortable as the game went on."" On Oct. 10, Thomas and Kyrou each had two assists and Joel Hofer made 25 saves to help the Blues record a 5-4 overtime victory in San Jose. No. 1 overall pick Macklin Celebrini had a goal and an assist in that game for the Sharks, getting his NHL career off to a flying start. Celebrini plays on San Jose's second line with Will Smith and veteran Barclay Goodrow. ""He's done some really good things, and he's obviously got an elite skill set,"" Sharks coach Ryan Warsofsky said of the 18-year-old Celebrini. ""He wants the puck, he demands the puck ln the ice, so we had an feeling he'd drive us in a certain way and himself in a certain way."" San Jose has been getting strong production from its top line of William Eklund and Fabian Zetterlund with veteran Mikael Granlund. In the Sharks' 5-2 loss at Dallas on Wednesday, Granlund scored and set up a goal and Eklund added an assist. ""That line has been good, good chemistry,"" Warsofsky said. ""You can see they know each other in the offensive zone. They are doing some really good things. (Granlund) has taken both of those guys under his wing and helped them become really true pros now and take that next step."" The Sharks, who are 1-2-2 in their last five games, started Mackenzie Blackwood in goal Wednesday. With Vitek Vanecek sidelined on a day-to-day basis with an upper-body injury, Yaroslav Askarov arrived from the Sharks' American Hockey League in San Jose and served as Blackwood's backup Wednesday.  But Vanecek also made the trip, and Warsofsky remained undecided about who to start in goal Thursday against the Blues. Forward Brayden Schenn and defenseman Justin Faulk didn't participate in practice for the Blues on Wednesday. Bannister termed it a ""maintenance day"" for both and said he expects them to play against the Sharks. Defenseman Pierre-Olivier Joseph practiced again Wednesday while continuing his comeback from a lower-body injury. Bannister was unsure if he would rejoin the lineup on Thursday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.21,0.79

The Devils will look to regain a share of the division lead and cool off the Hurricanes on Thursday night when the teams clash in Newark, N.J. The Devils have been idle since Saturday when they dropped a 4-0 decision to the host Tampa Bay Lightning.  The Hurricanes, in turn, will be completing a back-to-back road set after scoring three third-period goals Wednesday in a 4-1 win over the Philadelphia Flyers. The first quarter of the season has been a successful one for New Jersey, which is 12-7-2 under first-year head coach Sheldon Keefe. But the busy schedule has the Devils already trying to make up ground against the Hurricanes and Capitals, each of whom have three games in hand. The Capitals leapfrogged the Devils on Monday by recording a 6-2 victory over the Utah Hockey Club. Carolina seized sole possession of first place on Wednesday.  Keefe said he's hopeful the break will refresh the Devils, who are one point ahead of the fourth-place New York Rangers. The Rangers, however, have four games in hand.  ""The demands of the schedule being what it has been in the first 20 games of the season -- it's been a lot for us and the pace that's been more demanding than the rest of the league, quite frankly,"" Keefe said following practice Tuesday. ""Chance now to sort of take a breath."" The Hurricanes haven't allowed opponents much room to breathe during a three-game winning streak in which they've outscored the Flyers, Ottawa Senators and St. Louis Blues by a combined 12-2 margin. Carolina got off to a quick start Wednesday, when Jalen Chatfield scored on the team's second shot of the game just 30 seconds after the opening faceoff. But the Hurricanes didn't score again until Sebastian Aho collected the game-winner 1:03 into the third period. ""(The key is) restarting every night. Even (Thursday), we've got to take what we can learn from this game, the good and the bad, and get right back at it (on Thursday),"" Chatfield said. ""We can't be focusing on the past, ever, and we know we've got an experienced group, we've got a lot of good leaders and we try to bring it every night. Some nights it doesn't start the best, but we always find our game and once we do that, we're fine."" Following Aho's goal, Jordan Staal and Jack Roslovic scored within a 55-second span for the Hurricanes, who outshot the Flyers 20-15 in the first two periods before enjoying a 17-4 advantage in the third. ""I liked how we answered in the third -- I thought the game was there and now we've got to make a statement because I don't love the first two periods, that's for sure,"" Hurricanes coach Rod Brind'Amour said after his team defeated the Flyers. ""But again, you've got the other team and they're doing their thing. But I thought it was a good collective effort in the third."" Carolina has scored 72 goals this season, tied for second in the Eastern Conference. The Hurricanes have put up at least four goals in 12 of the past 13 games (11-2-0). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.22,0.78

The 3-0 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs on Wednesday dropped Vegas to just 3-4-2 on the road this season. It also marked the first time the Golden Knights were shut out since last season at Colorado (Jan. 10). That loss came on the heels of a 5-2 setback to the Washington Capitals on Sunday. Vegas also lost to the Capitals on Oct. 15, a defeat that started a three-game losing skid (0-2-1). The Golden Knights entered Wednesday's setback converting on 35 percent of their road power plays, tops in the NHL, but went 0-for-3 with the extra man in Toronto.  ""Yeah, frustrating,"" said forward Jack Eichel, who had a six-game point streak snapped in the shutout loss. ""Obviously had some power-play opportunities, and our power play has helped us a lot this year but we weren't able to do that tonight. I think that was sort of the difference. It's frustrating. We need to find ways to score goals.""  Eichel was asked if the Golden Knights could benefit from a quick turnaround.  ""Yeah, obviously we're playing in like 20 hours,"" he replied. ""Just learn from the game but we need to be better. It's frustrating. You lose a few in a row and you don't want to let this continue to go. Obviously we need to find a way to get two points. It's as simple as that. We have a competitive group in here and we'll respond well.""  The Golden Knights will be facing an Ottawa team that also is smarting after a pair of lopsided losses. The Senators followed up a 5-4 overtime loss versus the Philadelphia Flyers last Thursday with a 4-0 setback at the Carolina Hurricanes on Saturday and a 5-2 defeat at home to the Edmonton Oilers on Tuesday.  The Senators fell behind 3-1 in the first period to the Oilers on a pair of goals by superstar Connor McDavid. They trailed 5-1 midway through the third period before Josh Norris tipped in a Nick Jensen point shot with just 2:24 remaining to close the scoring.  ""Flat,"" Ottawa coach Travis Green said of his team's effort. ""Not a lot of energy. Not sharp with our execution. We looked flat tonight. It's frustrating for sure.""  ""I think as a group, and I think myself as well, the first two periods are probably the worst two periods I've played,"" Senators defenseman Thomas Chabot said. ""You've got to take some ownership. Fortunately, in hockey you have a chance to go at it soon again."" Ottawa captain Brady Tkachuk said he expects his team to bounce back with a strong effort versus Vegas. ""No more (expletive) excuses,"" Tkachuk said. ""Right now every game is a must-win. These are the moments, the games that could turn a season around. We know we're a good team."" ""We know it's going to be a tough game against Vegas,"" forward Drake Batherson added. ""They know how to win. Obviously they won a (Stanley) Cup a few years ago so it will be a good one.

After a one-point loss to the rugged Pittsburgh Steelers, followed by the compressed schedule that led into the Thursday night game at Philadelphia, the Commanders were able to rest and get healthy with the extra days. ""I was able to reset and refocus, restart,"" rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels said Wednesday. ""It's kind of needed in a long season like that. It was great to get away for a little bit, but I'm glad that we're back now."" The offense can use a reset. Daniels completed just 59.1 percent of his passes against the Steelers and Eagles with a touchdown and an interception. He posted two of his three lowest passer ratings of the season in those games. The Commanders are averaging 22.5 points over their past four games, more than a touchdown less than over the first seven games of the season (31.1). ""I don't think anyone is hitting the panic button, but at the same time there's a lot to improve on,"" Washington tight end Zach Ertz said. ""There's a lot of urgency that goes with that."" It will be a reunion of sorts for Commanders head coach Dan Quinn, who served as Dallas' defensive coordinator for the previous three seasons. The Cowboys went 2-0 against the Commanders last season but arrive in D.C. a double-digit underdog after losing five games by a combined 172-70. ""We have a lot of moving parts going on, and we just have to be cleaner and more detailed in certain spots,"" Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy said. ""We're not playing well enough, not executing well enough, coaching well enough to overcome some of the mistakes we're making in critical times of the game."" The Cowboys' minus-11 turnover differential is tied for second worst in the league. On defense, Dallas ranks sixth from the bottom in the NFL, allowing 365.7 yards per game, and second to last in points allowed (29.3). The Cowboys have also been troubled by slow starts. Dallas has produced the opening score in only three of its 10 games. Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush is expected to make his third consecutive start after throwing for 354 yards, one touchdown and one interception against Houston. ""We've got seven losses. We gotta go,"" McCarthy said. ""Backs against the wall. Gotta fight, claw, scratch. Gotta do everything we can to go win the next game. That's where my mind's at. That's the way we coach and that's the expectation. In terms of good news for Dallas, All-Pro cornerback DaRon Bland (foot) returned to practice and was a full participant on Wednesday. In addition, wide receiver Brandin Cooks (knee) and defensive end Marshawn Kneeland (knee) are eligible to come off IR. Among those not practicing for Dallas on Wednesday were tight end Jake Ferguson (concussion), fullback Hunter Luepke (calf) and guards Zach Martin (ankle/shoulder) and Tyler Smith (ankle/knee). Wide receiver CeeDee Lamb (back/foot) was limited. Washington safety Marshon Lattimore (hamstring) did not practice Wednesday, doing his work on a side field, but appears to be trending in the right direction in terms of playing Sunday. Linebacker Nick Bellore (knee) was absent from the Wednesday session. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,0,0.56,0.44

Classic on Thursday evening.,Nevada (4-0) has won all of","Both Nevada and Vanderbilt will look to stay unbeaten when they meet in the Charleston (S.C.) Classic on Thursday evening. Nevada (4-0) has won all of its games by double digits. The latest was an 85-59 pasting of Santa Clara on Saturday in which the Wolf Pack had four players score in double figures and the team dished out 18 assists while committing just 10 turnovers. ""Another game where we had low turnovers and shared the ball, and just couldn't be happier,"" Nevada coach Steve Alford said. ""It's a really good group to coach and we've got a chance. It's only four games in, it's a very short pool of games we've played, but we're very happy we're 4-0."" The Wolf Pack, led by Nick Davidson (18 points per game, 8 rebounds per game), Kobe Sanders (16.8 ppg, 4.8 assists per game) and Tre Coleman (12.5 ppg, 4.5 apg), rank second in the country in 3-point percentage (48.6 percent), led by Davidson's 9-of-11 showing behind the arc. Nevada plays at a plodding pace (321st nationally in KenPom's adjusted tempo at 17.6 seconds per possession). Meanwhile, Vanderbilt (4-0) plays at a quicker tempo, fueled by a deep rotation that has nine players averaging between 15 and 25.5 minutes. The Commodores have four double-figure scorers: Jason Edwards (17.5 ppg), Devin McGlockton (16.0), Tyler Nickel (12.0) and AJ Hoggard (11.0). McGlockton (10.0 rpg, 3.0 blocks per game) and reserve guard Tyler Tanner (3.0 steals per contest) have excelled on defense for Vanderbilt. The Commodores had a one-turnover game in their opening-night win over Maryland Eastern Shore, registered 18 steals in a win over Cal on Nov. 13 and went 16-for-38 on 3-point attempts in a 94-81 victory over Jackson State on Sunday. ""We've won in different ways so far. The first three games we hadn't shot the ball well,"" Vanderbilt coach Mark Byington said. ""I thought we really shared the ball (against Jackson State) and played the right way."" The winner between the Commodores and Wolf Pack will play a tournament semifinal game against either Seton Hall or VCU on Friday. The other side of the eight-team bracket features Miami (Fla.), Drake, Oklahoma State and Florida Atlantic. This will be the first meeting between Vanderbilt and Nevada. The victory over Santa Clara was Alford's 100th win at the school in his sixth season in Reno. Alford joined Lefty Driesell as the second coach in Division I history to win at least 100 games at four schools. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.35,0.65

O'Connell knows the Vikings have surprised many observers who projected them to finish at or near the bottom of the NFC North. He knows about the praise being directed his way for reviving the career of journeyman quarterback Sam Darnold. However, O'Connell is not satisfied. He wants to see his players take another step forward when the Vikings (8-2) visit the Chicago Bears (4-6) on Sunday along the shores of Lake Michigan. ""We've just got to continue to get better and prove it,"" O'Connell said. ""8-2 means absolutely nothing."" This weekend's division rivalry matchup should be something. The Bears are desperate to snap a four-game losing streak and earn their first victory since Oct. 13. Chicago's skid began when it lost on a Hail Mary pass against the Washington Commanders, and it turned four weeks old last Sunday when the Green Bay Packers blocked a 46-yard field-goal attempt by Bears kicker Cairo Santos as time expired. Bears coach Matt Eberflus tried to stay upbeat despite the mounting losses. ""There were a lot of positives to build from,"" he said. ""That's what you have to do."" Bears quarterback Caleb Williams will try to build upon a solid start as he prepares to face the Vikings for the first time in his young career. The rookie completed 23 of 31 passes for 231 yards last week against Green Bay, and he carried the ball nine times for 70 yards. Chicago wide receiver DJ Moore, who had a team-high seven catches for 62 yards last week, said he and his teammates should be able to maintain their positive momentum this week against the Vikings' top-10 defense. ""With all the players we've got, I hope we are able to move the ball on all types of defenses -- from the No. 1 defense in the league down to the 32nd,"" Moore said. ""I hope we can keep it up and hopefully get some wins out of it."" As the Bears look to stop a losing streak, the Vikings will aim to maintain their winning streak. Minnesota is coming off victories against the Indianapolis Colts, Jacksonville Jaguars and Tennessee Titans over the past three weeks. Darnold has posted a 100.0 passer rating in 10 starts this season. He has completed a career-best 67.9 percent of his passes for 2,387 yards, 19 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. The next touchdown pass will mark a career high for Darnold, who sputtered with the New York Jets and Carolina Panthers before serving as the San Francisco 49ers' backup last season. ""I just feel like, you know -- not talking about past experiences at all -- but I think here it's the detail that we've had ever since OTAs, ever since April,"" Darnold said. ""We've been able to lock in our progressions. Just our feet, our eyes, where they're supposed to be. And just being on time with the concepts. ""If you play like that, it makes the quarterback position a little bit easier."" It also helps to have All-Pro wideout Justin Jefferson, who has 59 catches for 912 yards and five touchdowns. The Vikings' top rusher is former Packer Aaron Jones, who has 692 yards and a pair of touchdowns on the ground. The teams split their matchups last season. The Vikings won 19-13 in Chicago on Oct. 15, and the Bears responded with a 12-10 victory in Minneapolis on Nov. 27. Chicago is 4-2 at home this season. Minnesota is 4-1 on the road. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.35,0.65

Zubac's fastbreak dunk off a pass from Kris Dunn gave the Clippers a 102-86 lead with 2:57 remaining, all but sealing the win.   Playing against his former team, the Clippers' Mo Bamba scored seven points and added four rebounds in his third game of the season after returning from a knee injury.   The Magic continued to play without Paolo Banchero (oblique) and Wendell Carter Jr. (foot).   Orlando shot 51.4 percent from the floor and Los Angeles shot 51.3 percent in the first half as the Clippers took a 57-54 lead. Los Angeles had a 22-10 rebounding advantage before halftime.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.32,0.68

Daniel Sprong scored his first goal in his second stint with the Kraken, and Yanni Gourde tallied on an empty-netter. Chandler Stephenson had three assists and Jaden Schwartz added two helpers. The Kraken completed a 5-1-0 homestand. Daccord posted all five victories, and he didn't play in a 2-0 loss to the New York Rangers on Sunday. Juuse Saros stopped 33 of the 35 shots he faced as the Predators wrapped up their road trip with a 1-2-2 mark. It was Seattle's second victory against the Predators this season, as the Kraken also won 7-3 on Oct. 15 in Nashville. The Kraken outshot Nashville 10-6 in the first period and 17-8 in the second but were able to only get one puck past Saros during that span. Sprong opened the scoring at 15:55 of the second period. Montour kept the puck in the zone at the left point and backhanded a pass that split a pair of Nashville defenders and found Stephenson alone in front of the net. Stephenson deked both ways before sliding the puck to Sprong for a tap-in at the left post. Sprong scored 21 goals for Seattle in 2022-23, when the Kraken reached Game 7 of the Western Conference semifinals. He was reacquired in a Nov. 8 trade with the Vancouver Canucks. The Kraken doubled their advantage just 23 seconds into the third period. Stephenson carried the puck over the blue line on the left wing and got to the faceoff dot before sliding a pass across the slot to Montour, who had joined the rush. The defenseman stretched to redirect the puck past Saros as the goalie went from post to post. Nashville's Tommy Novak appeared to score at 10:38 of the third, but a video review determined he put the puck in the net with a distinct kicking motion and the goal was disallowed. Gourde sealed the victory with his goal at 17:17. Kraken forward Shane Wright, the No. 4 overall selection in the 2022 draft, was a healthy scratch for the second consecutive game. Wright has not recorded a point since Oct. 17. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.15,0.85

Phoenix later made a 13-4 push to move within 85-71 on Booker's basket with 7:22 left in the period. The Suns trailed by 11 before Hart and Brunson hit consecutive 3-pointers to start an 11-2 spurt. Jericho Sims' dunk capped it and gave the Knicks a 99-79 lead with three minutes left in the period. New York held a 110-93 entering the final stanza and cruised to the finish.

The Warriors overcame a sluggish start against the Hawks, who were playing their third game in four nights, to dominate the final seven-plus minutes of the first quarter, turning a 15-14 deficit into a 41-22 advantage. Buddy Hield came off the bench to contribute eight points to the 27-7 flurry, helping Golden State score its most points in the first quarter this season. Down 67-42 at halftime, the Hawks made a bit of a push in the third quarter and early in the fourth, closing within 90-77 on two free throws by De'Andre Hunter with 11:02 left in the game. But Lindy Waters III countered with a 3-pointer and Golden State kept Atlanta at bay the rest of the way. Wiggins shot 12 of 17 from the floor and went 3-of-6 from beyond the arc. He added seven rebounds, four assists and two blocks. Curry, who had eight assists, went 4-for-6 from 3-point range to help the Warriors shoot 14 for 40 from deep.

The NFC East-leading Eagles (8-2) have won their past six contests, while the Rams (5-5) have won four of their past five to keep pace in a crowded NFC West. Philadelphia enters Week 12 with the league's No. 1 defense, allowing 273.1 yards per game, and the No. 5 offense powered by Jalen Hurts and Saquon Barkley. Hurts has accounted for 23 touchdowns (12 passing, 11 rushing), and Barkley leads the NFL with 1,347 yards from scrimmage. The Eagles are well-rested, as they have been idle since a 26-18 win on Nov. 14 against division rival Washington. Philadelphia held the Commanders to 264 total yards -- the sixth straight game an opponent failed to gain more than 280 vs. the Eagles. Philadelphia is also road-tested. The Eagles are 4-1 in road games, which doesn't include their ""home"" win against Green Bay in Brazil to open the season. Road success is nothing new for the team, as the Eagles are 22-9 away from home in three-plus seasons under coach Nick Sirianni. ""I think the biggest thing out of all that is just having that mental toughness that everyone is going to be against you on the road,"" Sirianni said this week. ""Now, we travel pretty well, and I've been really appreciative of the Eagles fans that show up no matter where we are. But you still feel like the stadium is against you. ""It's just an opportunity for you to unite as a team, lock arms as a team and have that mental toughness, that dawg mentality as far as understanding just play the next play, control what you can control, and unite as a team. Those are two of our big-time core values: connect and toughness. So we take pride in that. Then I just think that speaks volumes of our players and coaches that they handle that."" The Eagles have won all three road games in the series since the Rams returned to Los Angeles in 2016, including a 23-14 victory in Week 5 last season. ""They (Eagles) are red hot,"" Rams coach Sean McVay said this week. ""They have played really well. They are finding their identity. They have great playmakers, coaches, and schemes. So they are checking all the boxes of what really good teams do. So, that is a great challenge. ... ""We have a lot of respect for this group. But you know, these are the moments that you love as a competitor. This is what is the best part of the NFL."" The Rams are 3-2 at home this season, losing by five to the Green Bay Packers in Week 5 and by eight to the Miami Dolphins in Week 10. Los Angeles rebounded from the defeat to the Dolphins with a 28-22 win at New England last weekend. Matthew Stafford threw for 295 yards and four touchdowns, with Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua combining for 13 receptions, 229 yards and three scores. Stafford has a 4-2 record in his career against the Eagles with 12 touchdown passes and one interception. The Eagles announced Wednesday that defensive end Bryce Huff would have wrist surgery and could go on injured reserve. The team also opened the practice window for wide receiver Britain Covey (shoulder). Hurts (ankle) was listed as limited at Wednesday's practice. Wideout DeVonta Smith (hamstring), defensive tackle Milton Williams (foot) and linebacker Jalyx Hunt (ankle) did not participate. For the Rams, starting right tackle Rob Havenstein (ankle) and cornerback Charles Woods (ankle) did not practice on Wednesday.

An average of 17.5 million viewers have tuned in to an NFL game this season, which does not count international games carried by NFL Network or other exclusive broadcasts streamed on ESPN+ and Peacock. The league reported it is the highest average viewership through Week 11 since the 2015 season. The increased ratings come after speculation that viewership might decline during the election season. That's what happened in 2016, when the ratings dipped 8 percent from the previous year, according to Front Office Sports. Viewership also fell across multiple sports leagues during the COVID-impacted 2020 election season. That changed this year, as ratings remained steady around the election window. Late Sunday afternoon games aired on CBS and Fox, along with primetime games shown on Amazon Prime Video, NBC and ESPN, averaged 18.48 million viewers in the two weeks before the Nov. 5 election, according to Nielsen data. That average fell slightly to 18.18 million viewers in the two weeks after Election Day. Week 11 featured the NFL's top-rated game so far this season, with the Buffalo Bills' 30-21 win over Kansas City, the Chiefs' first defeat of the year, drawing 31.2 million viewers.

Sellers, a transfer from Southern California, sank a 3-pointer to give the Cardinal a 63-58 lead with 2:34 to go. He subsequently made four consecutive free throws, and Stanford went up 67-60 with 35 seconds left. After Norfolk State's Sin'Cere McMahon made a 3-pointer with 29 seconds remaining, the Cardinal's Jaylen Blakes made two free throws to help seal the win. Stanford is 5-0 for the first time since starting 7-0 in the 2019-20 season. Blakes made 10 of 12 free-throw attempts and tied his career high with 18 points. Maxime Raynaud led the Cardinal with 20 points and 10 rebounds. Norfolk State (4-2) got 24 points from Brian Moore Jr., 17 from Christian Ings and 10 from Jalen Myers. Stanford scored 14 unanswered points to take a 14-2 lead five minutes into the game and never trailed thereafter. Blakes, a graduate transfer from Duke, scored the first seven points of that run. A 3-pointer by Ryan Agarwal gave Stanford a 30-15 lead, its largest of the game, with 8:25 left in the first half. Stanford went more than seven minutes without making a field goal, which allowed Norfolk State to cut the gap to 35-31 with 1:28 left in the half. The Cardinal missed eight consecutive shots from the field in that stretch. Stanford led 38-33 at halftime behind Raynaud's 12 points and six rebounds. The Cardinal again had a field-goal drought in the first five minutes of the second half, allowing Norfolk State to go on a 9-1 run and take a 42-40 lead with 14:54 left. Sellers snapped Stanford's 0-for-6 start from the field in the second half by making a jumper with 14:32 left. The basket ignited a 9-2 run that enabled the Cardinal to take a 49-44 lead with 8:52 remaining. Moore scored 10 straight points for Norfolk State to help cut the deficit to 60-58 with 2:50 left.

Four players scored in double figures for USC (4-1), which ended its last game with a lengthy scoring drought and sputtered out of the gate on Wednesday. The Trojans had only four points in the game's first 4:18 but came alive midway through the first half, going on a 7-0 run after trailing 18-16. USC never relinquished the lead, though San Jose State (1-5) remained close throughout the first half. The Spartans' Will McClendon, who finished with 18 points, scored coming out of halftime, to trim the deficit to five points. The Trojans' followed with their 10-0 and led by double digits the rest of the way. The Trojans dished at least 20 assists in each of their first three games before finishing with just 10 in Sunday's 71-66 loss to Cal. Wednesday marked a return to form, as Saint Thomas accounted for nine of the Trojans' to 23 assists on their 32 USC field goals. The Trojans shot 57.1 percent from the floor, including 10-of-22 from 3-point range. San Jose State was at 41.9 percent and 11-of-23 from beyond the arc. Josh Uduje made all five of his 3-point attempts en route to 25 points for the Spartans. But the Spartans made just 15 of 39 shots from inside the 3-point arc to USC's 22 of 34.

Florida is 1-3-0 in its past four games, including its 6-3 road loss to the Winnipeg Jets on Tuesday. After two straight losses, the Panthers appeared to have things clicking again with their dominant 5-0 shutout of the Jets on Saturday. However, Winnipeg rebounded by scoring the first three goals in the rematch. The Panthers twice pulled within one goal, but they couldn't complete the comeback. ""Every time we felt we were getting closer there, (Winnipeg) just put one in and got the momentum right back,"" Florida forward Matthew Tkachuk said. ""It was an even game for the most part. It's tough to lose that one when you fight back to get close."" The Panthers now face the Blackhawks and their NHL-low 13 points. Chicago is 1-5-0 in its past six games and has lost three straight. The Blackhawks led the visiting Anaheim Ducks 2-1 through 45 minutes on Tuesday, but Chicago's late-game struggles emerged again. The Ducks scored the equalizer and go-ahead goal within a span of 4:28 in the third period. The Blackhawks have been outscored 26-15 in third periods this season. ""(It's) definitely frustrating,"" said Chicago forward Jason Dickinson, who scored twice against Anaheim. ""We've been in a lot of these games. We could easily be coming out of a lot of these with wins. ... At the end of the day, we've got to go out and do it."" Beyond just the late concessions, Dickinson noted that the Blackhawks are getting outscored in general. Chicago is last in the league in goals (44) and average goals per game (2.32). Connor Bedard leads the Blackhawks with 15 points (three goals, 12 assists), though the reigning Calder Trophy winner hasn't scored a goal in his past 10 games. Chicago also took a hit with its announcement Wednesday that top defenseman Seth Jones will miss four weeks after he suffered a right foot injury.  Jones, 30, was placed on injured reserve on Saturday. He may have been hurt while blocking a shot in Chicago's 3-1 loss to Seattle Kraken on Nov. 14, coach Luke Richardson told reporters on Wednesday. Jones -- who has 10 points (two goals, eight assists) in 17 games this season -- leads all Chicago skaters in ice time per game at 25:43.  Sam Reinhart leads the Panthers with 29 points and 14 goals, and is tied for the team lead with 15 assists. He's fourth in the league in points. Seventeen of Reinhart's points (nine goals, eight assists) have come during his current 11-game point streak. A point on Thursday would tie Reinhart for the fifth-longest points streak in Panthers franchise history. Aleksander Barkov has also amassed 17 points (three goals, 14 assists) over a nine-game point streak. Panthers goalie Sergei Bobrovsky followed up his 27-save shutout over the Jets by allowing four goals on 25 shots on Tuesday. Bobrovsky has a modest .895 save percentage and 3.00 goals against average over his past six starts, so Florida could give Bobrovsky a breather by starting backup goalie Spencer Knight against Chicago. Blackhawks goalie Petr Mrazek wasn't available to face Anaheim due to a personal matter, so backup Arvid Soderblom got the start. Soderblom will presumably start again Thursday if Mrazek is still absent, as the Blackhawks likely wouldn't have rookie backup Drew Commesso make his NHL debut against the high-powered Panthers offense. Florida is 12-4-1 in its past 17 games against Chicago, dating back to the 2018-19 season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.21,0.79

""When you're in a rhythm, you're playing good football as a team, you don't want to stop,"" Cardinals tight end Trey McBride said. ""We've won three or four in a row now and it's fun. You want to keep this thing going, you don't want to take this break."" For the record, the Cardinals have won four consecutive games, defeating the Los Angeles Chargers 17-15, Chicago Bears 29-9 and New York Jets 31-6 at home, and the Miami Dolphins 28-27 on the road. One of the keys for the Cardinals has been a healthy Kyler Murray. He completed 22 of 24 passes for 266 yards two weeks ago against the Jets and also rushed for two scores. ""He's got that look in his eye, and when he's in that mode, he's unstoppable,"" said McBride, who has a team-high 49 receptions. ""He's playing at a really high level right now. I'm excited for him and I'm excited to continue to grow with him."" Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon called Sunday's game a ""big-time test on the road."" ""Seattle is always loud and the weather is kind of gray,"" Gannon said. The Seahawks are coming off a 20-17 victory against host San Francisco last week as quarterback Geno Smith scrambled for a 13-yard touchdown with 12 seconds remaining. Seattle snapped a two-game skid and won for just the second time in seven games.  ""These are the most important games of your season,"" Smith said. ""I think the way that we came out and we fought, collectively as a unit and as a team, it just spoke to our urgency. I thought the way that we practiced all week, I knew we were going to come out and play well and get the monkey off my back."" Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said his team is treating Arizona's visit ""like a home playoff game for us."" ""Look, we've earned the opportunity to be fighting for the lead in the division going into the home stretch,"" Macdonald said. ""So, that's the way we're treating it. It's very much like a playoff mindset for us at this point. Can't afford to drop games. You want to have the right to play for these really important games in December and January. You've got to be able to execute and put yourself in that situation."" The Cardinals had just one player miss practice time this week, safety Jalen Thompson (ankle). Veteran right tackle Jonah Williams (knee) was activated off injured reserve after being out since the season opener.

The Texans (7-4) hold a two-game division lead over the Indianapolis Colts despite recently losing three of four games, including blowing a 16-point halftime lead in a loss to the Detroit Lions. But Houston roared to a dominating 34-10 road victory over the Dallas Cowboys on Monday night, perhaps signaling the team is ready to go on a roll. In fact, the Texans visit a Jacksonville Jaguars team in disarray in Week 13 before having a bye week. Just don't mention the word ""playoffs"" anywhere near Texans coach DeMeco Ryans. ""I just want our guys to remain focused, remain locked in on the task at hand each week,"" Ryans told reporters. ""If we do that, we're a really good football team. We can play with anybody. It's just about finishing.""  Quarterback C.J. Stroud passed for 257 yards and was intercepted once against Dallas. Big-play receiver Nico Collins returned from a five-game absence due to a hamstring injury to catch four passes for 54 yards. But the big reason for the trampling of the Cowboys was running back Joe Mixon, who rushed for three touchdowns and had 153 yards from scrimmage. His 109 on the ground represented his fifth 100-yard outing in the past six games. ""When he's on, Joe's a force,"" Ryans said. ""I liked the way we just kept churning it in the run game. And I'm proud of the guys for stepping up to the challenge."" Houston expects to have star Will Anderson Jr. (ankle) after a two-game absence. Anderson, who was limited in Wednesday's practices, shares the team lead of 7.5 sacks with fellow defensive end Danielle Hunter. The Titans (2-8) lack an identity after the offseason departure of franchise icon Derrick Henry, the star running back. Tennessee has lost six games by double digits as it begins back-to-back road games against the Texans and Washington Commanders. Star defensive tackle Jeffery Simmons is putting on a brave face. He liked the effort in last Sunday's 23-13 loss to the Minnesota Vikings. ""The fight this team showed, especially in the second half, is why you want to play this game,"" Simmons said. ""No matter what the record may be, that's why I come to work, and I'm ready to go to war with my guys."" Quarterback Will Levis passed for a season-best 295 yards against the Vikings. One third of them came on one play when Nick Westbrook-Ikhine caught a pass at his own 40-yard line and raced down the right sideline for a 98-yard scoring play. Levis completed just 17 of 31 passes and was intercepted once. He isn't thrilled that Tennessee ranks 28th in the NFL in scoring offense (17 points per game) and 25th in total offense (295.4 yards per game). ""You have to just continue coming to work, knowing that how you approach your job and how you approach your day-to-day are the habits that create winning football,"" Levis said Wednesday. ""And, we just have to know that if we just keep doing those things, then the wins are going to come."" Titans standout cornerback L'Jarius Sneed (quadriceps) will not play on Sunday, according to coach Brian Callahan. He and receiver Calvin Ridley (illness) were among nine Titans to miss Wednesday's practice due to injury or illness. Among the others to sit out were defensive tackle Sebastian Joseph-Day (biceps) and running back Tyjae Spears (concussion). Linebacker Jack Gibbens (ankle) underwent season-ending surgery earlier this week and will be placed on injured reserve. He was injured and subsequently carted off the field during the loss to Minnesota. Houston defensive end Denico Autry (knee/oblique) sat out Wednesday's session. Defensive tackle Foley Fatukasi (foot) and offensive tackle Blake Fisher (concussion) also missed practice. The Texans have won the past three meetings. The teams will meet again in the final week of the regular season at Nashville. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,0,0.6,0.4

Starling starred in Syracuse's most recent game on Saturday, putting up a career-high 38 points in a 104-95 double-overtime home win over Youngstown State. ""That's the JJ Starling we know,"" Orange coach Adrian Autry said. ""He's the guy for us."" Given Syracuse's struggles to defend and its inability to easily put lesser teams away early in the season, the Orange might need another 38 from Starling on Thursday night when they take on Texas in the Legends Classic in New York. The good news is Starling appears to be capable of doing it any time he walks out on the court. In the team's 3-0 start, the junior guard is averaging a team-high 21.3 points per game and is doing so efficiently, canning 55.6 percent of his shots from the field. Asked why he is playing so well so far, Starling said he is just doing what the Orange need him to do. ""It's a new team so I'm still trying to find my way,"" he said after win over Youngstown State. ""This game is a step forward in the right direction, obviously, in the confidence department. The coaches trusted me with the ball."" While Starling has, well, starred, the Longhorns (3-1) have used a more balanced effort since a season-opening loss to Ohio State. They subsequently routed three straight outmatched foes in Austin, Texas, including an 89-43 blowout of Mississippi Valley State on Saturday. Kansas State transfer Arthur Kaluma and prized freshman Tre Johnson each scored 18 points for Texas, which buried the Delta Devils in the second half, outscoring them 56-20. The Longhorns' offense is averaging 89 points (against 60 for opponents) and shooting 52.9 percent from the field. Texas could enjoy a big night against a Syracuse defense that is 230th in adjusted defensive field-goal percentage, per kenpom.com. ""We're always going to take the one-game-at-a-time approach,"" Texas coach Rodney Terry said. ""I've got a lot of respect for the Syracuse program. They're very well-coached and a really good team. We're looking forward to going to the East Coast."" The only previous meeting of the programs came in the 2003 Final Four in New Orleans, where the Orange took a 95-84 win before beating Kansas for the national championship. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.38,0.62

Freeman, who finished with 13 points and five assists, was one of six Arizona State players who scored in double figures. Freshman forward Joson Sanon led the Sun Devils (4-1) with a season-high 22 points. Adam Miller finished with 16 points, Alston Mason had 14 points and five assists, Basheer Jihad scored 11 points and freshman Jayden Quaintance had 11 points and 12 rebounds. Cal Poly (3-3) nearly matched its win total of last season, when it finished 4-28. Jarred Hyder had 27 points while shooting 9 of 18 from the field, 7 of 14 from 3-point range, for the Mustangs. Isaac Jessup had 17 points and Kieran Elliott 14. Arizona State led by as many as 13 points in the second half, but Cal Poly rallied to cut the deficit to 81-80 with 2:50 left on a layup by Mac Riniker. Jihad's two free throws with 1:41 to go gave Arizona State an 84-80 lead. Koonce then made two free throws to pull the Mustangs within two. Sanon answered making a shot on a drive while being fouled. He sank the free throw for the three-point play to put the Sun Devils ahead 87-82 with 1:03 left. Elliott followed with a basket in the lane. Mason made one of two free-throw attempts to give Arizona State an 88-84 lead with 32 seconds left. After a missed 3-point attempt by Koonce, Quaintance was fouled. Quaintance made 1 of 2 shots at the free-throw line to increase the lead to 89-84 with 21 seconds left. Hyder made a 3-pointer before Sanon responded with two free throws with 13 seconds remaining to keep Arizona State ahead 91-87.

Since 2013, New England is 2-9 against the Dolphins in Miami Gardens, Fla., where the Patriots will attempt to pick up a rare win on Sunday afternoon.   First-year coach Jerod Mayo has been in the thick of New England's struggles in the Sunshine State. He spent his entire playing career (2008-15) with the Patriots, then served as inside linebackers coach from 2019-23 before taking over at the helm.   Mayo is making sure that New England (3-8) leaves the past in the past come Sunday, though.   ""First and foremost, I won't address it with the guys as far as the struggles that we've had in Miami, even though they're probably listening to me right now,"" Mayo said. ""But what I will say is every game is unique. ... It's a tough place to play. It's not that it's super loud or anything like that.   ""We just haven't been able to get over the hump.""   Patriots quarterback Drake Maye, the No. 3 overall pick in this year's draft, has given Mayo a reason to believe that New England can turn the corner against Miami (4-6). Maye continued to take steps in the right direction by completing 29 of 39 passes for 282 yards, two touchdowns and one interception during a 28-22 loss to the Los Angeles Rams last Sunday.   Dolphins signal-caller Tua Tagovailoa has been impressed with what he has seen from the 22-year-old Maye so far and is eager to go up against him.   ""I respect his game. I respect his game a lot,"" Tagovailoa said. ""He's a rookie, so there's gonna be bumps within his journey. But you see a lot of flashes of things that he can do, not just inside the pocket, outside of the pocket as well.   ""I got a lot of respect for him, and looking forward to competing against him.""   Tagovailoa most recently threw for 288 yards and three scores on 28-for-36 passing Miami's 34-19 win over the Las Vegas Raiders last Sunday. One of his favorite targets was former New England tight end Jonnu Smith, who hauled in six catches for 101 yards and two TDs.   Miami has rattled off back-to-back wins on the heels of a three-game losing streak that began after a 15-10 victory against the Patriots in Week 5.   ""We're looking to go out there and play the plays with what they've presented us over the years,"" Tagovailoa said, referring to the Dolphins' familiarity with New England's game plan. ""If we need to adjust in any way, we'll adjust.""   Cornerback Kendall Fuller (concussion) and offensive tackle Terron Armstead (knee) missed Miami's practice on Wednesday. Six Dolphins were limited, including star wideout Tyreek Hill (wrist) and cornerback Jalen Ramsey (knee).   Defensive end Deatrich Wise (foot), offensive tackle Vederian Lowe (shoulder) and defensive tackle Jaquelin Roy (neck) did not practice for the Patriots on Wednesday. Safety Kyle Dugger was among those limited -- due to an ankle injury -- and defensive end Keion White (knee) also failed to practice in full.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,0,0.51,0.49

Tampa Bay (4-6) was two games over .500 and challenging for the NFC South lead a month ago before falling in succession against Baltimore (41-31), Atlanta (31-26), Kansas City (30-24 in overtime) and San Francisco (23-20).  The Giants (2-8) have lost five in a row and are also coming off a bye. Quarterback Tommy DeVito will make his first start of the season and seventh of his two-year career after the Giants announced the benching of Daniel Jones this week after an overtime loss to the woeful Panthers.  ""Tommy Cutlets"" has a career passer rating of 89.2, with eight touchdowns and three interceptions. The 2023 undrafted free agent is 3-3 as a starter. ""Those are never easy conversations,"" Giants coach Brian Daboll said. ""[I've] got a lot of respect for all three of those guys. After evaluating a bunch of things and looking at a lot of tape and being around Tommy last year where he created a little bit of a spark for us, that's the reason why we're going with Tommy."" DeVito had been the third-string quarterback but Daboll chose him over backup Drew Lock. Tampa Bay's potent offense figures to heap even more pressure on DeVito and running back Tyrone Tracy, who has 545 yards and three rushing touchdowns as the Giants' only viable option. Rookie Malik Nabers (607 receiving yards, 3 touchdowns) and Darius Slayton (469, 1) could provide inviting targets for DeVito against a Bucs pass defense that has allowed 20 aerial scores this season, which ranks fifth worst in the NFL. The Giants, meanwhile, have excelled in red-zone defense and rank second in sacks (36). Tampa Bay (4-6) is the only team in the NFL to pass for more than 300 yards and rush for 100 more on four different occasions. The Bucs, led by a committee of Bucky Irving (492 yards, four touchdowns), Rachaad White (306; 1) and Sean Tucker (186; 1) have rushed for more than 100 yards seven times. Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield has been an offensive dynamo. Fourth among Bucs rushers with 192 yards and two scores, he's third in the NFL in touchdown passes (24), total touchdowns (26) and fifth in passer rating (103.6). Mayfield could get back a key contributor on Sunday. Wide receiver Mike Evans, who went down with a hamstring injury in Week 7, returned to practice on Wednesday. Evans had 335 yards and six receiving touchdowns before the injury. Slayton was a full participant on Wednesday as he recovers from a concussion. The wide receiver left the Giants' Week 9 loss to the Commanders and wasn't able to gain clearance to travel to the Giants' Week 10 loss in Germany to the Panthers. Bucs cornerback Zyon McCollum, who departed the 49ers loss with a hamstring injury, did not practice on Wednesday. All-Pro left tackle Tristin Wirfs, who sprained an MCL in the loss to the 49ers, worked on the sideline with trainers. Bucs coach Todd Bowles said it is ""going to be close"" for both players to play on Sunday. Giants outside linebacker Kayvon Thibodeaux (wrist) was a limited participant on Wednesday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.21,0.79

Heading into their road clash with the Calgary Flames on Thursday, however, the Rangers are happier with their execution of late. ""We were definitely playing not our best hockey, sneaking away with wins, whether it be with goaltending or being able to score a few,"" New York defenseman Adam Fox said, according to Forever Blueshirts. ""Early in the season, there are things you want to clean up ... but the road trip has been good."" The Rangers arrive in Calgary having won three straight games after their 4-3 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on Tuesday. New York boasts a 7-1-0 road record and has reached the midway point of a four-game trip with two victories. Although the clash against Vancouver was tight, the Rangers controlled play for the bulk of it. However, New York surrendered the first goal of the game on the first shot 34 seconds into the contest. ""We played a really good first period, maybe one of our best,"" Rangers coach Peter Laviolette said. ""We could have done a couple things differently that maybe could have helped prevent (the first goal), but to come right back and score, to me, that's important."" Mika Zibanejad scored less than two minutes later to tie the score, and New York never trailed again after Will Cuylle's sixth goal later in the first period. Chris Kreider supplied the tiebreaking and eventual game-winning tally midway through the third period. ""We were recovering pucks really well,"" Cuylle said. ""Whenever we would get a chance, get a shot and the puck would be loose, we'd be on it really quick and that's how you can sustain the pressure."" The Rangers might also receive a boost for the game. Center Filip Chytil, who missed the past two games, could return after it was determined he did not suffer a concussion against the San Jose Sharks on Thursday. The Flames are halfway through a four-game homestand in which they have rattled off successive wins, including their 2-1 shootout victory over the New York Islanders on Tuesday. Calgary has netted points in six of its past seven games (4-1-2) and continues to be one of the league's early-season surprises. The victory over the Islanders was nearly a textbook example of why the Flames are having success despite being in a rebuilding phase. After falling behind early in the second period, Calgary stayed in the game thanks to strong goaltending from Dustin Wolf before mounting a comeback. ""A lot of battling and competing, lot of chipped pucks,"" said Flames forward Justin Kirkland, who scored one of two shootout goals that sealed the victory. ""It wasn't really your clean game as it normally is, but we battled hard right until the end. As long as it took, we were willing to do that and come out of it with two points."" The Flames have been held to three or fewer goals in 13 consecutive games but have scored 26 third-period goals in 19 contests. They have also benefited from strong goaltending, especially from the rookie Wolf. The two-time AHL goaltender of the year delivered several saves to keep his team within striking distance and then held firm until the shootout, during which he was perfect.  Wolf has a 4-0-1 record in his past five outings while allowing eight goals. Calgary has posted a 7-2-1 record with Wolf between the pipes. He has -- at least for now -- secured the net for a team that had rotated goalies early in the campaign. ""The more comfortable you get in this league, the more you believe in yourself, the more success you're going to have,"" defenseman Rasmus Andersson said of Wolf. ""He for sure believes in himself quite a bit. He's been awesome, especially the last seven, eight games."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.37,0.63

Isaiah Hartenstein, making his season debut after missing the first 15 games with a broken hand, finished off the next possession with an alley-oop dunk, and Williams hit back-to-back 3-pointers to put Oklahoma City in control. Williams added eight assists, seven rebounds, two steals and two blocks. He hit five of Oklahoma City's nine 3-pointers. Gilgeous-Alexander was just 7 of 19 from the floor but hit all 14 of his free throws. Hartenstein played more than 28 minutes, finishing with 13 points, 14 rebounds and four blocks. The game was tight throughout. Portland jumped to a 23-13 lead late in the first quarter before the Thunder scored the final eight points of the quarter. The Blazers went 0 for 5 with four turnovers in going scoreless for the final four minutes of the first. But after that, neither team led by more than six until the Thunder's late run put the game away. Shaedon Sharpe led the Blazers with 21 points, going 6 of 16 from the floor. Portland's bench play had fueled its winning streak but the Thunder's bench outscored the Blazers' 44-31. The Blazers were once again without Deandre Ayton and Anfernee Simons. Ayton missed his fourth consecutive game with a right finger sprain while Simons missed his third consecutive game with an undisclosed illness. About midway through the third quarter, Portland point guard Scoot Henderson suffered a quad contusion and did not return. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.18,0.82

In his fourth college game, Thomas Sorber produced 14 points, 12 rebounds and five assists as Georgetown (3-1) rebounded from a deflating, 21-point loss Saturday at home to Notre Dame. Jayden Epps added 19 points as Georgetown made 50 percent of its shots from the floor and 6 of 20 (30 percent) from 3-point range. The Hoyas also outrebounded the Mountaineers 43-36. Terrell Ard Jr. tallied 12 points and six rebounds while Dola Adebayo added 10 points and six boards for Mount St. Mary's (3-2), which entered riding its best start since the 1996-97 season. After Sorber scored on Georgetown's opening possession and Peavy followed with a 3-pointer, the Hoyas never trailed. Midway through the first half, back-to-back 3-pointers by Epps stretched Georgetown's lead to its largest of the period, 25-9, before Mount St. Mary's put together its best run of the night. With the Hoyas missing seven straight shots, the Mountaineers scored eight points in a row with Adebayo accounting for half of them. His dunk with 5:05 left in the half reduced the deficit to 25-17. At the end of the half, Jordan Burks gave Georgetown a lift as he streaked for a breakaway, buzzer-beating two-handed slam that increased the Hoyas lead to 35-22. Sorber started the second half as he did the first, scoring on the Hoyas' first possession. After that, Georgetown remained in control as Mount St. Mary's never whittled the deficit to fewer than 14 points. Peavy achieved his milestone in style, freeing himself with a spinning dribble for a step-back jumper from the elbow. Peavy played at Texas Tech as a freshman then spent the last three seasons at Texas Christian before transferring to Georgetown. The Hoyas maxed out their lead as Malik Mack (10 points, five assists) made a layup and a pull-up 3-pointer to make it 77-46 with 1:20 left. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.31,0.69

Jamie Benn and Evgenii Dadonov also scored for the Stars, who have won four of five games. Dallas goaltender Jake Oettinger made 21 saves. Mikael Granlund notched one goal and one assist and Jake Walman scored for the Sharks, who have one victory in their last five outings (1-2-2). Goalie Mackenzie Blackwood stopped 26 shots. With the score tied 1-1 after the first period, Johnston put the Stars ahead for good by converting a close-in chance off the rush his third goal of the season 56 seconds into the middle frame. Benn made it a 3-1 game just past the midway point when he found the mark with a one-timer from the slot for his fourth goal of the campaign. Walman pulled the Sharks within one by netting his second goal of the season with 6:35 remaining in regulation. Walman received a cross-ice pass as he reached the left circle and immediately snapped a shot home. Granlund's assist on the goal was the 400th helper of his career. The Sharks failed to convert on a power play moments after making it a 3-2 game, and Hintz (seventh of the season) and Dadonov (fifth) later salted away the game with empty-net goals. The clubs traded first-period goals starting with Robertson's fifth of the season at 15:33. Robertson snapped a nine-game goal drought by spinning with the puck just inside the right circle and burying a short-side effort. Granlund tied the clash with a short-handed breakaway deke while holding off the check to net his ninth of the season at 18:44. With his assist on the goal, William Eklund ran his point-scoring streak to a career-best-tying five games, in which he has collected two goals and five assists. The victory came at a cost for Dallas, as defenseman Nils Lundkvist left early in the second period due to a lower-body injury. Granlund exited late in regulation after being on the receiving end of a hit. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.3,0.7

The Wild opened their three-game trip with a 4-2 win at the St. Louis Blues on Tuesday, improving to 8-1-2 as the visiting team this season. Their 18 road points lead the NHL. ""We just like to play on the road,"" Minnesota defenseman Jonas Brodin said. ""When we have a bad game, I feel like we come back and have a good next game. We don't let it slip to two, three games right now, so that's a good thing."" Leading the way at home and on the road for the Wild is left wing Kirill Kaprizov, who scored two more goals against the Blues to increase his road point streak to 10 games (eight goals, 15 assists), which ties Joel Eriksson Ek and Eric Staal for the longest road point streak in team history. Kaprizov is also riding a six-game point streak overall (six goals, six assists) and leads the NHL with 12 multipoint games this season. Wild coach John Hynes would like to see his team improve its puck management in tight games. Minnesota is just 2-1-3 in one-goal games this season. ""It's been a point of emphasis when you're in tight games, how you need to play,"" Hynes said. ""Not try to open things up, work for your chances, check for your chances. You've got to manage the puck, create chances. There have been some of the times this year where we have, and we've learned from those."" Edmonton is coming off a 5-2 road win against the Ottawa Senators on Tuesday, preventing the Oilers from going winless on their three-game trip (1-1-1). ""It's always nicer that you get a win (before) you go home because Thursday is going to be a tough game,"" Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch said of the matchup against the Wild. Edmonton enters with a hot goalie and an even hotter penalty kill. The Oilers have not allowed a power-play goal in the past five games, killing 12 straight penalties in that span, and goalie Stuart Skinner is 4-1-1 in his past six starts after making 27 saves in the win against Ottawa. ""It always looks like you defended a lot better when your goalie makes huge saves,"" Knoblauch said. The Oilers claimed right wing Kasperi Kapanen off waivers from the Blues on Tuesday and the 28-year-old could get his first opportunity against Minnesota. Kapanen had just one goal in 10 games with the Blues. He scored a career-high 20 goals with the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2018-19. ""We did our homework, and he'll fit in in our dressing room, be a good teammate. Sometimes, as guys get older, they mature,"" Oilers general manager Stan Bowman said. ""We'll know in the coming weeks, but in the conversation I had with him he is very motivated coming here. He is excited and very determined to make this a success."" The Oilers could be without left wing Zach Hyman, who did not play the third period against Ottawa because of an undisclosed injury. Hyman scored a career-high 54 goals for Edmonton last season, but has scored only three through 20 games this season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.32,0.68

The hosts never looked back, holding Southern to 21.7 percent shooting after halftime and outscoring the Jaguars 46-15 in the second half.   Zhuric Phelps added 16 points for Texas A&M, while Henry Coleman III hit for 11 points and Solomon Washington grabbed 11 rebounds.   Jordan Johnson had a game-high 19 points for the Jaguars (1-4). He was the only Southern player in double figures.   Southern roared in front with a 17-3 run capped by a tip-in layup by Joe Manning that gave the Jaguars a 21-11 lead at the 10:58 mark of the first half. Texas A&M cut its deficit to five points when Coleman hammered home a dunk with 8:28 to play.   Southern then ran off a 10-1 spurt to build a 31-17 lead after a 3-pointer by Johnson with 3:41 remaining in the half. The Jaguars pushed their lead to as many as 16 points after AJ Barnes' layup with 1:32 left and carried a 14-point cushion into the break.   Johnson led all scorers with 12 points before halftime as the Jaguars outshot Texas A&M 51.6 percent to 22.9 percent over the first 20 minutes.   Taylor led the anemic Aggies offense with just six points in the first half as A&M went just 3-of-15 from beyond the arc and were outscored 22-8 in the paint. Texas A&M turned around the game in the middle of the second half after Barnes' 3-pointer gave Southern a 44-34 lead with 15:16 left. The Aggies ripped off the next 19 points and engineered another 8-0 run after Jayce Depron scored five straight points for Southern. The Jaguars went 2-of-15 from the floor over the first 12 minutes of the second half and never recovered. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.22,0.78

New Orleans played without their top eight players as leading scorer Brandon Ingram (ankle) and Trey Murphy III (hamstring management) joined Zion Williamson, Dejounte Murray, CJ McCollum, Herbert Jones, Jose Alvarado and Jordan Hawkins on the sideline.   The loss came 24 hours after a 132-91 drubbing at Dallas.   Six Cavaliers scored during a 19-5 run to start the third quarter that put Cleveland in command with an 88-60 lead.   The Cavaliers scored the first four points of the game and the closest the Pelicans got in the first quarter was 14-12 on a basket by Missi.   Jerome scored seven points as Cleveland expanded the lead to nine points before Antonio Reeves scored six points to help New Orleans trim the lead to 29-24 at the end of the period.

New Orleans scored the next five points but two more 3-pointers by Jerome helped Cleveland rebuild the lead to 10.   After a Javonte Green tip-in for the Pelicans, Jerome made three 3-pointers and the Cavaliers expanded the lead to 69-55 at halftime. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.35,0.65

Now, the Spurs have to prove they can repeat that effort. They get the chance when San Antonio hosts the slumping Utah Jazz on Thursday in a Western Conference clash. The teams already have played twice this season. San Antonio won by 18 points in Salt Lake City on Oct. 31 and the Jazz evened the series with a one-point victory on Nov. 9 in the Alamo City. The Spurs play the second of a three-contest homestand after a 110-104 win over Oklahoma City on Tuesday. The victory snapped a two-game losing streak for San Antonio, which won despite not having injured star center Victor Wembanyama (bruised right knee) and guard Devin Vassell (sore left knee), both of whom missed their second consecutive game. Both have been ruled out against the Jazz. Keldon Johnson poured in 22 points off the bench and starter Chris Paul had a double-double (14 points, 11 assists) that included a crucial 3-pointer with 1:27 left to lead San Antonio on Tuesday. The Spurs built a 21-point advantage early in the fourth quarter and then outlasted the Thunder's spirited rally in the final minutes. ""We did a good job of weathering their storm and made just enough plays to stay enough ahead to have a little bit of breathing room,"" Spurs interim head coach Mitch Johnson said. Harrison Barnes added 20 points for San Antonio while Julian Champagnie, Zach Collins and Charles Bassey scored 12 apiece. Stephon Castle tallied 10 in the victory. ""We've been playing a lot of close games already,"" Paul said. ""We've had some tough losses and some big leads, and we didn't let go. But the only way you learn how to win these games is to actually do it."" The Jazz conclude a four-game road trip with their meeting against the Spurs on Thursday after a 124-118 loss at the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday. Lauri Markkanen led Utah with 25 points and eight rebounds while Collin Sexton added 19 points and John Collins, Keyonte George and Jordan Clarkson had 18 points each as the Jazz lost their third consecutive game. Utah closed to within seven points, 116-109, on Markkanen's layup with 1:42 to play but ran out of time. Jazz coach Will Hardy continues to keep some of his young, untested players in the game while it's still in the balance, trying to reduce their learning curve in key situations. That's part of the team's grand plan, according to Hardy. ""There's moments where you're sort of rolling the dice of like, ‘OK, I want these guys to feel this moment and to have some recognition, and we're communicating in a game, and can we fix it on the fly?' "" Hardy said. ""The rolling-the-dice part is that we might not fix it on the fly (in this game). But that's where we're at, that's what we're doing.""

Penn State shot well from the field (55.7 percent) and the 3-point arc (11 of 25, 44 percent), while its second-half numbers (71.9 percent shooting, 9 of 14 from 3-point range) were even more impressive.

With under 10 minutes remaining, Penn State led just 74-69 before Baldwin's layup kickstarted a 12-0 run. Hicks connected on two 3-pointers during the burst, including a triple that made it 86-69 with 6:57 to play. Purdue Fort Wayne got within 94-85 with 1:27 to go, but Konan Niederhauser threw down a dunk on the next possession, and the hosts cruised to the finish line. The score was close throughout the first half until the Mastodons began to create some separation late in the session. Jackson's 3-pointer with 3:10 left before halftime put Purdue Fort Wayne ahead 39-33, and then he dunked about a minute later to make it 43-35.

Both left-handers won the pitching Triple Crown, with Sale leading the National League in wins, strikeouts and earned-run average, and Skubal -- who was voted for the award unanimously -- repeating the feat in the American League. It is the first Cy Young Award for each. Sale took the honors over fellow National League finalists Zack Wheeler of the Philadelphia Phillies and Pittsburgh Pirates rookie Paul Skenes. Sale received 26 first-place votes and four for second for 198 total points in voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America.  ""This wasn't an easy way to get to winning this trophy for the first time,"" Sale said, per MLB.com. ""As soon as it happened, I'm thinking about people and teammates and coaches and family. It's special to me because of all the hard work that other people put in to get me here."" Wheeler was second with 130 points (four firsts, 25 seconds, one fourth) and Skenes, the NL Rookie of the Year, was third with 53 (one second, 13 thirds, three fourths). Dylan Cease of the Padres (45), Shota Imanaga of the Cubs (38) were also among the top five vote-getters. Sale's teammate, right-hander Reynaldo Lopez, was one of three NL pitchers who received a single fifth-place vote. Skubal, with all 30 first-place votes for 210 points, bested American League finalists Seth Lugo of the Kansas City Royals (93) and Cleveland Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase (66).  ""It's special,"" Skubal said. ""All the hard work, all the stuff that goes on behind the scenes, moments like this make it extremely worth it."" The Royals' Cole Ragans (48), the Orioles' Corbin Burnes (47), the Mariners' Logan Gilbert (25), the Astros' Framber Valdez (17), the Rangers' Kirby Yates (two), the Astros' Yusei Kikuchi (one) and the Guardians' Cade Smith (one) rounded out the voting. Sale, 35, had been in the Cy Young conversation multiple times, the runner-up in 2017 and finishing in the top six in voting for seven consecutive seasons from 2012-18. The award is the crowning achievement in the comeback for Sale, who missed all of the 2020 season following Tommy John surgery and was limited to just 11 combined starts in 2021 and 2022 due to injury. After a 6-5 season with a 4.30 ERA with the Boston Red Sox in 2023, he was traded to the Braves last Dec. 30 along with cash for infielder Vaughn Grissom. In his first season in Atlanta, Sale finished 18-3 with a 2.38 ERA. Over 29 starts and 177 2/3 innings, he struck out 225 batters and walked 39, giving up just nine home runs. He was named the NL Comeback Player of the Year last week. ""My goal at the beginning of this year was just to be healthy,"" Sale said. ""Getting greedy and thinking of things like this would have been maybe a little over my skis. I was coming to a new team that made a trade for me, when I'm sure there were a lot of people that kind of gave that trade the side-eye when it first happened. ... To say I'd be sitting here right now would be crazy. I just wanted to be able to do my job, really."" Sale's season ended in disappointment, however, as a back ailment kept him from pitching in the postseason. In his career with the Chicago White Sox (2010-16), Red Sox (2017-23) and Braves, Sale has a 138-83 record with a 3.04 ERA and 2,414 strikeouts over 372 appearances (292 starts). As for Skubal, he won the award on his 28th birthday. A ninth-round draft pick by the Tigers in 2018, he made his debut in 2020. In 31 starts this season, he finished 18-4 with a 2.39 ERA, striking out 228 and walking 35 over 192 innings. Skubal was 6-2 with a 1.85 ERA over his last eight starts as Detroit surged from eight games below .500 in mid-August into the playoffs for the first time since 2014.  He beat the Astros in Game 1 of the AL wild-card series and finished the postseason 1-1 with a 2.37 ERA in three starts. ""It was a ton of fun to be part of,"" Skubal said. ""The last two months of our season and even the postseason was very special. The memories and the experience will obviously help our club going forward, and I'm glad we got to experience it as a team and as a young team."" Over 106 career regular-season appearances (103 starts), Skubal is 41-31 with a 3.37 ERA. He has 648 strikeouts in 571 1/3 innings. Sale became the first Atlanta pitcher to win the award since Tom Glavine won for the second time in 1998, which capped a dominant decade by Braves pitchers when Glavine, Greg Maddux and John Smoltz combined for six Cy Youngs in eight seasons. Skubal is the third Tigers pitcher in the 2000s to take home the prize, following Justin Verlander (2011) and Max Scherzer (2013). This season was the fourth in major league history that both leagues had a Triple Crown winner in the same year. The last time that happened was 2011, when Verlander of the Tigers and Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers accomplished the feat. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.45,0.55

After ending a seven-game skid with a 130-119 victory over the visiting Indiana Pacers, Toronto hopes to further climb out of its early-season slump when it hosts the Minnesota Timberwolves on Thursday. ""I don't know if you guys heard the celebration in the locker room, obviously it was a little bit of a relief factor with it,"" said Raptors center Jakob Poeltl, who had 30 points and 15 rebounds against the Pacers. ""And it's obviously great to get that winning feeling back."" RJ Barrett had a season-best 39 points for the Raptors, who are 3-4 at home. Minnesota is 3-4 on the road.  Toronto can avenge a 112-101 road loss to the Timberwolves on Oct. 26 in Thursday's rematch.  The Timberwolves won for the second game in a row with a 120-117 home victory over the Phoenix Suns on Sunday, with Julius Randle hitting a game-ending 3-pointer. Randle had 35 points and Anthony Edwards added 24. The Timberwolves trailed for most of the game and were down by as many as 16 points. ""That's what I'm most proud of, really. Guys found a way to hang in there,"" Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. ""It's a little bit of a microcosm of our season so far. We have just got to find a way to keep battling and eking out some results until we can catch the rhythm that we know is there."" Part of the solution for Minnesota would be steadier defensive play. ""Well, I would hope defensive consistency, for sure,"" Finch said. ""A little smarter play. We have opportunities to take control of the game, seize the game, capitalize. We just have a few too many ill-advised turnovers, still. Our turnover numbers are down, but we had some unfortunately-timed ones (Sunday)."" Minnesota allowed Phoenix to shoot 54.1 percent (46-for-85) from the field and trailed by 10 at halftime. ""We didn't fold,"" said Minnesota center Rudy Gobert, who had 11 points, 10 rebounds and four blocked shots on Sunday. ""So for me, that's what matters is that our mindset is still always going, always competing, always resilient. Then we get better, figure it out. We have guys that want to win. We have a lot of talent in this room, and I think we'll keep re-finding our identity defensively, and once we do that, everything else is going to click."" In the win over Indiana, Toronto trailed once by one point and led by as many as 22 points. The Raptors shot 58.5 percent (48-for-82) from the field, including 48.3 percent (14-for-29) from 3-point range. Poeltl has averaged 30 points and 15 rebounds over the past three games, shooting 71.9 percent (41-for-57) from the field. ""I think what we're doing really well is finding him,"" Raptors coach Darko Rajakovic said. ""(Poeltl is) playing really well in pick-and-rolls. He's getting better in reading when the defense is going over and under and finding his pocket pass. And he's been, as you can see, playing with more force, going downhill and trying to dunk some of those situations.  ""That's a testament to his work,"" Rajakovic continued. ""That's a testament to everything that he did over the course of the summer, and if he continues like this, we're going to have another All-Star player.""

Our golf experts preview the field and provide their favorite prop picks along with best bets to win this week. THE RSM CLASSIC Location: St. Simons Island, Ga., Nov. 21-24 Course: Sea Island Golf Club (Seaside: Par 70, 7,005 Yards; Plantation: Par 72, 7,060 Yards) Purse: $7.6M (Winner: $1.368M) Defending Champion: Ludvig Aberg FedEx Cup Champion: Scottie Scheffler HOW TO FOLLOW TV: Thursday-Friday: 12-3 p.m.; Saturday-Sunday, 1-4 p.m. (Golf Channel) Streaming (ESPN+): Thursday-Friday: 8 a.m.-4 p.m. ET X: @TheRSMClassic PROP PICKS --Chris Kirk to Beat Matt Kuchar (-115 at DraftKings): Kuchar, 46, has been among the veterans grinding as he tees it up for the sixth time during the fall swing. He posted three top-15s against a missed cut through the first four before going T37 in Japan and T30 in Mexico. Kirk, ranked 44th in the world, has been taking it far easier closer to home in Georgia and is a former Sea Island resident. Kirk, who posted a T35 in Utah in his long fall start so far, has played in this event every year since its inception. --Austin Eckroat Top 30 (+105 at BetRivers): Eckroat won his most recent start in Mexico two weeks ago and said it proved his maiden tour win at the Cognizant Classic in March wasn't a fluke. We agree. Eckroat reached the second round of the FedEx Cup playoffs on the strength of a strong season, and riding a wave of confidence he should be in contention against a fall field. --Callum Tarren Top English Finisher (+550): OK, we're closing out 2024 with a longshot selection. The big-hitting Tarren rebounded from a trio of missed cuts with a T37 last week. Granted, he has also missed seven of his past nine cuts overall. Matt Wallace is understandably the -150 favorite in this prop as the 65th-ranked player in the world comes off a T11 at the DP World Championship. We're banking on some jet lag as Wallace crossed the ocean to play his third consecutive week. Also in this prop are David Skinns (+400) and Ben Taylor (+650). Skinns has made four consecutive cuts during the PGA Tour fall swing, while Taylor has missed four of six cuts this fall. 2024 Prop Picks Record: 53-60 BEST BETS --Aberg (+900 at DraftKings) is making his first start since finishing 16th at the Tour Championship as he defends his lone tour win to date following knee surgery earlier this fall. His winning score of 253 last year tied Justin Thomas from the 2017 Sony Open for the record low in a 72-hole event.  --St. Simons resident Brian Harman (+2200) competes for the first time since playing for the winning United States team at the Presidents Cup.  --Sea Island resident Davis Thompson (+2200) won earlier this year (John Deere Classic).  --Luke Clanton (+4000) will make his eighth start on tour this year, and the 21-year-old amateur has three top-10s. NOTES This is the final of eight tournaments on the FedEx Cup Fall schedule, which finalizes the top 125 players retaining exempt status for 2025. Nos. 126-150 after the fall will retain conditional status.  Players who finished Nos. 51-70 in the FedEx Cup have secured their tour cards but are competing for spots in the first two signature events after the season-opening The Sentry on Jan. 2-5.  All 19 players from Nos. 122-140 in the FedExCup Fall standings entering the week are in the field: No. 122 Sam Ryder No. 123 Zac Blair No. 124 Joel Dahmen No. 125 Wesley Bryan No. 126 Henrik Norlander No. 127 Daniel Berger  No. 128 Hayden Springer  No. 129 Pierceson Coody  No. 130 S.H.

The game was an on-campus opener of the Fort Myers Tip-Off tournament with both schools playing Monday and Tuesday next week in Fort Myers, Fla. On Monday, Xavier plays South Carolina, while Siena takes on Miami (Ohio). Zach Freemantle had 10 points and nine rebounds, while Trey Green added 14 points in 17 minutes for the Musketeers (5-0), who finished off a perfect five-game homestand to open the season. The Saints (3-2) lost their second straight. Xavier dominated the game in the paint and on the fast break, outscoring Siena 42-22 inside while recording a 31-4 advantage in fast-break points. The Saints had an 11-2 edge in blocks. Reid Ducharme led Siena with 15 points, and Major Freeman also made it to double figures with 12 points. Xavier methodically built a 44-28 lead at the break thanks to a nearly perfect first half from Foster. He had eight points on 3-for-3 shooting from the field, including a pair of 3-pointers. He added two rebounds, four assists and a steal without a turnover in 15 minutes. The Musketeers opened the game red-hot from beyond the arc, draining their first four attempts from deep and five of their first six. Xavier finished the first half shooting 8-for-13 from 3-point range and 56.7 percent overall. Freeman kept the Saints reasonably close, scoring 10 points. Siena was within a point, 16-15, before Xavier went on an 8-0 spurt to take a 24-15 lead. Green sparked the burst with a 3-pointer and Freemantle scored the other five points. Leading 30-23 with 5:20 remaining, Xavier closed the half on a 14-5 run to open a comfortable margin. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.16,0.84

Sure, the Capitals have scored a whopping 27 goals during their five-game point streak (4-0-1), including 16 during an emphatic sweep of a three-game road trip that began with a 5-2 victory over the Avalanche on Friday. That said, Washington was dealt a severe blow after superstar captain Alex Ovechkin sustained a lower-leg injury following a collision during the third period of Monday's 6-2 victory over the Utah Hockey Club. The Capitals labeled Ovechkin as week-to-week on Tuesday and placed him on injured reserve Wednesday. They recalled forward Ivan Miroshnichenko from the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League in a corresponding move. The loss of Ovechkin obviously is a substantial one. The three-time Hart Trophy recipient has scored 13 goals in his last 11 games to boost his career total to 868, which is just 27 removed from breaking Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky's all-time record of 894 set from 1978-99. ""It (stinks),"" Capitals forward Nic Dowd said. ""Hate to see it. He's been absolutely on fire and he's huge for our team. He's our captain. You've got to score goals to win games. He's been playing incredible hockey, so, yeah, I hate to see it."" He's not alone. ""(Ovechkin is) our leader,"" goaltender Charlie Lindgren said, per the Washington Post. ""He's our bull. It's tough to see him go down. ... He's a guy that's doing it all right now, not just scoring. He's the captain for a reason."" Lindgren made 17 saves against the Avalanche to snap a modest two-game skid. He also handed Colorado its lone loss in its last five games. The Avalanche rebounded from the setback to the Capitals and opened a four-game road trip on Monday with a 3-2 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers. Defenseman Cale Makar scored two goals to boost his point total to 27 (eight goals, 19 assists) in 19 games. ""I felt like we were offensively rolling,"" Makar said. ""When the forwards are moving around, it's fun for us as (defensemen). We can kind of move up top and create space. So yeah, I thought we were working out well."" The former Calder, Norris and Smythe Trophy winner could have capped his performance with a hat trick, but his apparent tally was disallowed due to netminder interference. ""He got two, I'm not sure about the third one that was disallowed,"" Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. ""He got into some good areas on some nice plays from some other players on our team, (Nathan MacKinnon) fed across on the one right into the slot.  ""Just picked the right spots, I felt like (on Monday), to get up in the rush and join, especially on the entries into the (offensive) zone. In the (offensive) zone play, he was pretty active. He found himself in the slot two or three times, all alone, and he didn't make any mistakes on those."" Casey Mittelstadt scored and set up a goal and Mikko Rantanen added two assists to lift his point total to 10 (six goals, four assists) in his past five games. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.38,0.62

The Lions head into Indiana on Sunday with an eight-game winning streak, their longest since their first season in Detroit in 1934. They carved up Jacksonville 52-6, while scoring touchdowns on their first seven possessions last week. ""They're tough on all three phases, and it shows,"" Steichen said. ""It definitely shows. All those guys are flying around, making plays. They're having fun doing it."" Led by Jared Goff, Detroit (9-1) leads the NFL in points scored (33.6 per game) and point differential (plus-159) this season. Goff bounced back from a five-interception outing in Houston by throwing for 412 yards and four touchdowns against the hapless Jaguars. Top target Amon-Ra St. Brown caught 11 passes for a season-high 161 yards and two touchdowns. St. Brown has a receiving touchdown in eight straight games. And the running back duo of David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs has combined to rush for almost 1,400 yards and 18 touchdowns. The powerful Montgomery has found the end zone 10 times, including twice against Jacksonville. ""He's a throwback. There are throwback principles about him, and I mean that with all due respect,"" head coach Dan Campbell said. ""His running style is -- it's rare. David is just different, and he's downhill, doesn't give up, first guy, he's not going to let him tackle him, continues to churn his legs, and just violent, violent, never give up, never going down."" The lightning-quick Gibbs is averaging 6.0 yards per carry and has eight rushing touchdowns. His one reception last week went for 54 yards.   ""To me, they're the perfect combination,"" Campbell said.   Indianapolis is scoring just 21.5 points per game and has reached the 30-point mark only one time, in a 37-34 loss at Jacksonville. The Colts rallied to beat the New York Jets last week in the return of super-sized quarterback Anthony Richardson. But Detroit isn't just any opponent. The Lions established a new franchise record for points in a six-game stretch last week with 232. ""Their offense is super-powered, so we're going to have to do our part, and we're excited for it,"" receiver Michael Pittman said. The Colts (5-6) reinstated Richardson in the lineup and snapped a three-game losing streak. In the 28-27 victory, Richardson passed for one touchdown and ran for two more, including the go-ahead score with 46 seconds left. ""Very encouraged,"" Steichen said of Richardson's outing. ""I think when you go through a three-game stretch like we had and you go on the road and get a win, and winning in the two-minute drive, you get some momentum -- the confidence. Obviously, coming back at home, we've got to continue that momentum and carry that confidence into this week. We're looking forward to it."" Richardson wasn't picked off in 30 attempts, though he fumbled twice and the Jets recovered one of them. He has fumbled eight times this season and lost three of them. They'll be facing a much tougher opponent this week, though one of the Lions' top defenders, linebacker Alex Anzalone, sustained a broken forearm on Sunday and was placed on injured reserve. ""Just seeing the toughness from our team. We're definitely trying to carry that over because we know we're getting ready to play a physical team,"" Richardson said. ""So, they're going to bring it to us. We got to bring it to them. But just trusting my guys each and every play, like I did in that fourth quarter, and just trust in my ability. I feel like I'm a decent football player, and I like to make plays out there."" Detroit tight end Sam LaPorta missed Sunday's game with a shoulder injury but could return this week. He was listed as a full participant in Wednesday's walk-through.  The Colts listed only offensive tackle Bernhard Raimann (knee) as a non-participant in their walk-through on Wednesday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.25,0.75

Both left-handers won the pitching Triple Crown, with Sale leading the National League in wins, strikeouts and earned-run average, and Skubal -- who was voted for the award unanimously -- repeating the feat in the American League. It is the first Cy Young Award for each. Sale took the honors over fellow National League finalists Zack Wheeler of the Philadelphia Phillies and Pittsburgh Pirates rookie Paul Skenes. Sale received 26 first-place votes and four for second for 198 total points in voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Wheeler was second with 130 points (four firsts, 25 seconds, one fourth) and Skenes, the NL Rookie of the Year, was third with 53 (one second, 13 thirds, three fourths). Dylan Cease of the Padres (45), Shota Imanaga of the Cubs (38) and Logan Webb of the Giants (18) rounded out the voting. Skubal, with all 30 first-place votes for 210 points, bested American League finalists Seth Lugo of the Kansas City Royals (93) and Cleveland Guardians closer Emmanual Clase (66). The Royals' Cole Ragans (48), the Orioles' Corbin Burnes (47), the Mariners' Logan Gilbert (25), the Astros' Framber Valdez (17), the Rangers' Kirby Yates (two), the Astros' Yusei Kikuchi (one) and the Guardians' Cade Smith (one) rounded out the voting. Sale, 35, had been in the Cy Young conversation multiple times, the runner-up in 2017 and finishing in the top six in voting for seven consecutive seasons from 2012-18. The award is the crowning achievement in the comeback for Sale, who missed all of the 2020 season following Tommy John surgery and was limited to just 11 combined starts in 2021 and 2022 due to injury. After a 6-5 season with a 4.30 ERA with the Boston Red Sox in 2023, he was traded to the Braves last Dec. 30 along with cash for infielder Vaughn Grissom. In his first season in Atlanta, Sale finished 18-3 with a 2.38 ERA. Over 29 starts and 177 2/3 innings, he struck out 225 batters and walked 39, giving up just nine home runs. He was named the NL Comeback Player of the Year last week. Sale's season ended in disappointment, however, as a back ailment kept him from pitching in the postseason. In his career with the Chicago White Sox (2010-16), Red Sox (2017-23) and Braves, Sale has a 138-83 record with a 3.04 ERA and 2,414 strikeouts over 372 appearances (292 starts). As for Skubal, he won the award on his 28th birthday. A ninth-round draft pick by the Tigers in 2018, he made his debut in 2020. In 31 starts this season, he finished 18-4 with a 2.39 ERA, striking out 228 and walking 35 over 192 innings. In the postseason, he was 1-1 (2.37 ERA) in three starts. Over 106 career regular-season appearances (103 starts), Skubal is 41-31 with a 3.37 ERA. He has 648 strikeouts in 571 1/3 innings. Sale became the first Atlanta pitcher to win the award since Tom Glavine won for the second time in 1998, which capped a dominant decade by Braves pitchers when Glavine, Greg Maddux and John Smoltz combined for six Cy Youngs in eight seasons. Skubal is the third Tigers pitcher in the 2000s to take home the prize, following Justin Verlander (2011) and Max Scherzer (2013). This season was the fourth in MLB history that both leagues had a Triple Crown winner in the same year. The last time that happened was 2011, with Verlander of the Tigers and Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.45,0.55

Paolini's 6-2, 6-1 triumph in 66 minutes over Sramkova came after Lucia Bronzetti dispatched Viktoria Hruncakova 6-2, 6-4 in one hour and 23 minutes. The Italians redeemed themselves after falling to Canada in last year's final. Bronzetti quickly pulled away from Hruncakova after three competitive games in the first set. She converted 6 of 9 break points overall and committed eight fewer unforced errors (26-18) than Hruncakova to set it up for Paolini, who had little trouble finishing off the underdog Slovakians. The World No. 4 won 71 percent of her first serve points (22 of 31) and faced just two break points, saving one of them. Sramkova's 28 unforced errors proved too much to overcome as Paolini atoned for her loss to Canada's Leylah Fernandez 12 months ago and clinched Italy's fifth Billie Jean King Cup title and first since 2013. Sara Errani, 37, was a member of both championship teams. Slovakia last won the title in 2002. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.29,0.71

Meanwhile, it's been nearly a month since the Columbus Blue Jackets won back-to-back games.  After losing four straight, the Lightning will aim to notch their fourth straight win when they visit the Blue Jackets on Thursday. Tampa Bay opened November on an 0-3-1 slide, but has since outscored opponents 11-3 during its current three-game winning streak.  On Tuesday at Pittsburgh, the Lightning trailed 2-0 after two periods, but Brayden Point scored twice, including 3:58 into overtime, for a 3-2 Tampa Bay victory that snapped its three-game road skid.  ""I think it just shows what we need to be successful,"" said Point, who returned Tuesday after missing four games with a lower-body injury. ""I think that third period is how we're going to have to win games ... Just good defending and working our chances.""  Anthony Cirelli also scored for a third consecutive game and Andrei Vasilevskiy stopped 17 of 19 shots faced. Vasilevskiy has stymied 99 of 103 attempts over his last four starts (3-0-1). Meanwhile, Point has 10 goals with 15 points in the 13 games he's played this season.  ""He's got an engine, that kid. He's got a nose for the net,"" Lightning coach Jon Cooper said. ""We're obviously a much better team when Point is in the lineup.""   Tampa Bay has won 10 of the last 12 meetings with Columbus, with Point scoring three times in the last five contests between the teams.  Vasilevskiy has a 2.37 goals-against average and .914 save percentage during his eight-game starting winning streak against the Blue Jackets. However, Lightning backup Jonas Johansson has allowed five goals in each of his two starts versus Columbus.  Like Tampa Bay, the Blue Jackets opened November in rough fashion, going 0-5-1 before winning two of the last three. Elvis Merzlikins made 28 saves and five different players scored during Columbus' 5-1 win at Boston on Monday -- which paved the way for the Bruins to fire coach Jim Montgomery.  The Blue Jackets have won two straight games only once this season (Oct. 28 and 30), though there seemed plenty to build on from Monday's win.  ""We can now reinforce a lot of stuff that we did in (Monday's) game,"" Columbus coach Dean Evason said. ""But, it has to be consistent. Hopefully, that propels us forward to do the right things.""  Merzlikins has stopped 49 of 52 shots to win his last two starts after posting a 3.99 goals-against average while going 0-3-1 in the previous four. He has a 2.21 GAA and .929 save percentage while going 3-1-1 as starter at home against the Lightning during his career.   Meanwhile, the Blue Jackets' Daniil Tarasov has a 4.78 GAA during his current 0-3-1 starting rut this season.  Columbus' Kirill Marchenko has a team-leading 16 points but produced just one in the last four games. However, the Blue Jackets' young star owns five goals with one assist in five career games versus Tampa Bay.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21,1,0.17,0.83

All five Knicks starters scored in double figures. Josh Hart had 19 points, 11 rebounds and six assists. Devin Booker scored 33 points on 12-for-23 shooting and Jusuf Nurkic had 14 points and 12 rebounds for the injury-depleted Suns, who have lost five straight. New York never trailed, hitting its first eight shots, including four 3-pointers. The Knicks carried that momentum to a 44-28 advantage after one quarter and a 76-58 lead at halftime. Brunson had 23 points before the break on 8-for-9 shooting, including hitting all four 3s. The Suns cut the deficit to 88-77 midway through the third quarter, but the Knicks responded with an 11-2 run. Phoenix star Kevin Durant missed his seventh straight game with a left calf strain. Teammate and three-time All-Star Bradley Beal was out for the fifth straight game, also because of a strained left calf. Knicks: New York's starting to look like the team many envisioned when they traded for Towns — a four-time All-Star — before the season. The starting lineup is deep with scoring options and makes it tough for the opposing defense. Suns: It's been a tough slog of late for Phoenix and the struggles can't totally be blamed on injuries. They came out flat against the Knicks, particularly on defense, giving up easy transition buckets and good looks from 3-point range.  Brunson splashed home a 3-pointer on the first possession of the game — a harbinger of things to come. The Knicks shot 18 for 23 (78.3%) in the first quarter, including 8 for 11 (72.7%) from 3-point range. Knicks travel to Utah on Saturday, and Suns host the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21,1,0.28,0.72

Purdy only threw a few passes Wednesday and Thursday during the portion of practice open to the media after hurting his right shoulder in last week's loss to the Seattle Seahawks. The 49ers postponed Purdy's usual news conference until Friday as the team is still determining whether he will be able to play against the Packers. “He was still limited today, he didn’t do as much yesterday but did a little bit more today,” coach Kyle Shanahan said Thursday in his weekly interview with the team’s flagship radio station, KNBR. “He went out there and did a little bit then went back in about halfway through and rested up. Hopefully it will be feeling great on Sunday.” Purdy has not missed a start because of an injury since taking over as the 49ers' quarterback in December 2001. If he can't go on Sunday, that would deliver a major blow to his team's playoff hopes. The Niners (5-5) are currently in a three-way tie for second in the NFC West, a game behind first-place Arizona, and have little margin for error if they want to get back to the playoffs after making it to the Super Bowl last season. Purdy has completed 66% of his passes this season for 2,613 yards, 13 TDs, eight interceptions and a 95.9 passer rating that is down significantly from his league-leading mark of 113 in 2023. Purdy isn't the only key player for San Francisco dealing with an injury this week. All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams didn't practice for a second straight day because of an ankle injury. Williams missed practice all of last week with the ankle injury but played against Seattle. Star defensive end Nick Bosa left in the second half against the Seahawks after injuring his left hip and oblique and hasn't practiced this week. Bosa had previously been dealing with injuries to his right hip and oblique. Shanahan has said that both Williams and Bosa won't need to practice this week in order to play on Sunday. Running back Christian McCaffrey, still dealing with Achilles tendinitis, returned to practice Thursday after resting Wednesday. Tight end George Kittle practiced for a second straight day and says he will play this week after missing the Seattle game with a hamstring injury. Receiver Jacob Cowing didn't practice a day after being limited because he was in the concussion protocol.

Aaron Judge earns second AL honor in 3 seasons",https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/shohei-ohtani-win-mvp-award-aaron-judge-116094732,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 20:58:26 -0500","Shohei Ohtani won his third Most Valuable Player Award and first in the National League, and Aaron Judge earned his second American League honor on Thursday","Shohei Ohtani won his third Most Valuable Player Award and first in the National League, and Aaron Judge earned his second American League honor on Thursday NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) — Shohei Ohtani keeps setting records, even after the season is over. The Los Angeles Dodgers star added his third Most Valuable Player award to his collection and first in the National League when he was chosen unanimously by the Baseball Writers' Association of America on Thursday. Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees won the American League award for the second time, also unanimously. Ohtani last year became the first two-time unanimous MVP. He won the AL award in 2021 and 2023 as a two-way star for the Los Angeles Angels and finished second to Judge in 2022 voting.  He didn’t pitch in 2024 following elbow surgery and signed a record $700 million, 10-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers last December. Ohtani became the first player to reach 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in a season, then helped the Dodgers beat the Yankees in the World Series. “The fact that I knew I wasn’t going to be able to pitch this season just made me focus more on my offensive game and fortunately I was able to produce and get this award,” Ohtani said through a translator. Ohtani sat on a red sofa with his wife and dog Decoy as teammate Clayton Kershaw announced the award on the MLB Network. The Nederlanse kooikerhondje immediately jumped away. Ohtani received all 30 first-place votes and 420 points. New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor was second with 263 points and Arizona second baseman Ketel Marte third with 229.  Judge was a unanimous pick for the first time. Kansas City shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. got all 30 second-place votes for 270 points, and Yankees outfielder Juan Soto was third with 21 third-place votes and 229 points. Ohtani hit .310, stole 59 bases and led the NL with 54 homers and 130 RBIs exclusively as a designated hitter, becoming the first player with 50 or more homers and 50 or more stolen bases in a season. A highlight of the season was during the dog days. Ball in mouth, Decoy delivered the ceremonial first pitch to his owner at Dodger Stadium's home plate before an Aug. 28 game against Baltimore. “The most nerve-wracking game that I had, the most nervous I was when we had that Decoy throw out the first pitch,” he said. Ohtani played the final three games of the World Series with a torn labrum in his left shoulder. Still recovering from right elbow surgery in September 2023, Ohtani had another operation on Nov. 5 to repair the shoulder and has been working on range of motion and started Thursday on core and lower body work. “The goal is to be ready for opening day and that includes hitting and pitching,” Ohtani said. “But we are kind of taking our time."" When Ohtani resumes pitching, could he win MVP and the Cy Young Award in the same year? “That would obviously be great, but right now my focus is just to get to get back healthy, come back stronger, get back on the mound and show everybody what I can do,” Ohtani said. Ohtani became the first primary designated hitter and first player who didn't appear defensively for a single inning to win an MVP. His season started with the revelation longtime interpreter and friend, Ippei Mizuhara had stolen nearly $17 million from the star to fund gambling. Ohtani is the 12th player with three or more MVPs, joining Barry Bonds (seven) and Jimmie Foxx, Joe DiMaggio, Stan Musial, Roy Campanella, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Mike Schmidt, Alex Rodriguez, Albert Pujols and Mike Trout (three each). Balloting was conducted before the postseason. “Moving forward, I think now we do have a target on our back,” Ohtani said. “We are going to be expected to maybe even do — possibly even do more.” Judge led the major leagues with 58 homers, 144 RBIs and 133 walks while hitting .322. Witt topped the big leagues with a .332 average, hitting 32 homers with 31 stolen bases and 109 RBIs. Soto batted .288 with 41 homers and 109 RBIs. When Judge won his first MVP award in 2022, he received 28 first-place votes while Ohtani got the other two. Judge had discussed the MVP award with Philadelphia’s Bryce Harper, the NL winner in 2015 and ’21. “I was telling him, `Man, I’m going to try to catch up to you with these MVPs here, man,’” Judge recalled. “He’d say, hopefully, he could stay a couple ahead of me, which I think he’ll do.” When Judge won his first MVP award in 2022, he received 28 first-place votes while Ohtani got the other two. He is the Yankees' 22nd MVP winner, four more than any other team. Judge was hitting .207 with six homers and 18 RBIs through April, then batted .352 with 52 homers and 126 RBIs in 127 games. “March and April were not my friend this year.” Judge said. “Just keep putting in the work and things are going to change. You can’t mope. You can’t feel sorry for yourself. Especially in New York, nobody’s going to feel sorry for you. So you just got to go out there and put up the numbers.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21,1,0.48,0.52
ABC News: Sports,Spain and tennis having to cope with the retirement of the great Nadal,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/spain-tennis-cope-retirement-great-nadal-116094368,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 10:50:19 -0500",It was an emotional farewell from tennis for Nadal this week after Spain was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Davis Cup in Malaga,"It was an emotional farewell from tennis for Nadal this week after Spain was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Davis Cup in Malaga MALAGA, Spain -- As Rafael Nadal prepared to serve in what turned out to be the last tennis match of his career, a woman's voice broke the silence from the stands: “You make Spain proud!” Not long after that, Nadal was wiping away tears from his face and waving goodbye to his fans. His farewell from tennis was as emotional as expected when it came in Malaga on Tuesday, too soon for most. Nadal deliberately set up his swansong on a home court but Spain was eliminated in the Davis Cup quarterfinals and he and they couldn't complete his exalted career with a win. It was also heart-wrenching for his fans across Spain as they saw one of the country’s very best — arguably its greatest sportsperson ever — finally call it quits. “It's clear that Rafa is the best athlete ever in Spain. He is on a different level than everyone else, by far,” Feliciano López, a former tennis player and the tournament director of the Davis Cup Finals, told The Associated Press. “No disrespect to all other Spanish athletes, and we have very good ones, but no one has been able to inspire the fans the same way that Rafa did."" López, who was Nadal’s teammate in the Davis Cup, compared him to the likes of Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan and Muhammad Ali, all athletes who transcended sports. “There is a very small group of athletes who, during their careers, were able to inspire people in a special way, going beyond sports,” López said. “Rafa belongs to this small group. People everywhere in the world will remember Rafa some 40 or 50 years from now.”  Unable to overcome a string of injuries in recent years, the 38-year-old Nadal retired from professional tennis after more than 20 years on tour and 22 Grand Slam titles, two more than Roger Federer and second only to the 24 of Novak Djokovic, the only one of the Big Three still playing. The front pages of Spain’s dailies all talked about Nadal following his farewell match — a 6-4, 6-4 defeat against No. 80 Botic van de Zandschulp of the Netherlands. “It was an honor,” the sports daily AS said. “Thank you, Rafa,” Marca headlined. “Eternal,” Mundo Deportivo said. It's hard to find any other Spanish athlete coming close to Nadal's fame and sporting achievements. Other Spaniards who have earned sporting greatness include five-time major golf champion Seve Ballesteros; five-time Tour de France winner Miguel Induráin, two-time NBA champion Pau Gasol; two-time Formula 1 champion Fernando Alonso; six-time MotoGP champion Marc Márquez; and four-time Dakar Rally winner Carlos Sainz. Spain also has a long list of successful soccer players, including World Cup winners Iker Casillas and Andrés Iniesta, but none with a status like a Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi, who have transcended sports like Nadal. Nadal is also a two-time Olympic champion, and was Spain’s flag-bearer during the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro. He is adored in Spain just as much for his victories as he is for his passion and unwavering dedication, and is seen as an example for society in general for his values and humbleness on and off the courts. “Nadal makes us Spaniards feel proud. He represents the values of passion, camaraderie, solidarity. He will always be the image of sport in Spain,"" said Clara García, a 35-year-old fan who was in Malaga to watch Nadal. “It's not easy knowing that he won't be playing and representing Spain on the courts around the world anymore.” Federer gushed about his friend and longtime foe's retirement in an open letter. “You made Spain proud, you made the whole tennis world proud. You have always been a role model for kids around the world.” Nadal told the crowd in his farewell ceremony after Spain's loss that he always ""strived to be better and achieve my goals from a place of respect, humility, and I valued all the good things that happened to me. “I’ve tried to be a good person, which was what mattered the most to me, and I hope that you have noticed that."" Fellow tennis pros Djokovic and Serena Williams, as well as former soccer stars David Beckham and other athletes praised Nadal. ""Thank you for so many incredible moments and memories as a tennis fan and for everything that you have done to inspire young people around the world,” former England and Real Madrid player Beckham said. “My goodness, you will be missed,” Williams said. Carlos Alcaraz, regarded as Nadal's heir in Spanish tennis — he already has four Grand Slam titles at 21 — said it will be hard to avoid the inevitable pressure that will come along with following in the footsteps of his idol. “I don’t want to think that we have to continue his legacy. I don’t want it to be a frustration if we don’t reach the level that he reached,” Alcaraz said. “If I achieve half of what he achieved, I will be happy. His legacy is going to be eternal.” It wasn't quite clear what the future would hold for Nadal, who is an avid golfer and who has always been linked to Real Madrid. He has said in the past he would probably enjoy being the club's president one day. “My life will change radically,” Nadal said on Wednesday after arriving home in Mallorca, where he also has the Rafa Nadal Academy. “I have to accept this change as something normal, and accept that my life will be different now than it was for the last 30 years or so. I'm excited about it, there is no doubt.” One thing was certain: Nadal will never be too far away from tennis.  “I’ll retire from the sport but I will continue to be available for whatever is needed, and to being a good ambassador, which is what I have tried to do my entire life.” ___ AP Tennis Writer Howard Fendrich contributed. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21,0,0.54,0.46
ABC News: Sports,Drama surrounds final 3 races of F1 season as drivers voice displeasure with recent FIA decisions,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/drama-surrounds-final-3-races-f1-season-drivers-116104131,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 14:02:29 -0500",There&rsquo;s three races remaining in the Formula 1 season and Max Verstappen is inching so close to a fourth consecutive world championship he could wrap it up Saturday night at the Las Vegas Grand Prix,"There’s three races remaining in the Formula 1 season and Max Verstappen is inching so close to a fourth consecutive world championship he could wrap it up Saturday night at the Las Vegas Grand Prix LAS VEGAS -- There are three races remaining in the Formula 1 season and Max Verstappen of Red Bull is close to a fourth consecutive world championship, which can wrap up Saturday night at the Las Vegas Grand Prix.  All is not smooth sailing headed into this final month of racing: — There's a new race director following the firing of Niels Wittich that blindsided the Grand Prix Drivers' Association so badly that it created an Instagram account to rebuke the lack of FIA transparency.  “It was a bit of a surprise, I think, for everybody,” said Mercedes driver George Russell, a GPDA director. “It’s a hell of a lot of pressure now onto the new race director (with) just three races left. Often, as drivers, we probably feel like we’re the last to find out this sort of information.” — Greg Maffei, the CEO of Liberty Media, the company that holds the commercial rights to F1, said last week he was stepping down from his position. This followed months of speculation that owner John Malone was displeased with Liberty landing in two different Justice Department investigations, one surrounding F1's refusal to allow Andretti Global into the series and the other over allegations of a Live Nation concert ticket monopoly. The Andretti team is expected to receive F1 approval to join the grid, albeit without Michael Andretti, who has scaled back his role dramatically since the IndyCar season ended in September.  — F1 denied over the weekend that Stefano Domenicali, CEO of Formula One Management, was also on the move amid rumors that the Italian would take over MotoGP if Liberty's purchase of the series is approved.  — Renee Wilm, a longtime Liberty Media employee, CEO of the Las Vegas Grand Prix and potentially Domenicali's successor, told The Associated Press she will fulfill any role Malone tasks her with but has little desire to move from Colorado to London to replace Domenicali. Maffei's newly opened job? Who knows.  Many drivers, particularly seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton, have been at odds with FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem since his election following the 2021 season finale. In the GDPA statement, they reminded the sanctioning body “our members are adults” who don't need lectures and fines on foul language or jewelry bans, and simply want fair and consistent race control.  There's been no response from Ben Sulayem, and won't be this weekend since he does not attend the LVGP. He will be at Qatar and the finale in Abu Dhabi next month.  Hamilton doesn't think all the behind-the-scenes changes will be a fan topic as the season comes to a close. But he noted that consistency from race control is all the drivers have asked for, while throwing his support behind Domenicali and the job Maffei has done in growing F1 since Liberty took over.  “I really hope Stefano is not leaving because he's been so instrumental in changes and progress to this whole thing,” Hamilton said. “And he knows the sport as well as anyone. But all good things do come to an end, and whoever they put into place, I just hope they are like-minded. But sometimes you have to shake the trees.”  That's just what happened with the surprise departure of race director Wittich. Although drivers have been unhappy with race officiating this season and held a private GPDA meeting in Mexico City, Russell said they had no prior warning Wittich was out. The race director is the referee each weekend and Wittich has been in charge since 2022, when Michael Masi was fired following the controversial 2021 season-ending, championship-altering finale at Abu Dhabi. Now the man in charge for the final three races is Rui Marques, the Formula 2 and Formula 3 race director.  Las Vegas, which overcame multiple stumbling blocks in last year's debut before putting on one of the best races of the season, is a difficult place to start. Verstappen can win his fourth title by simply scoring three points more than Lando Norris of McLaren.  “It’s a bit weird with three races to go to do that,” Verstappen said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re positive or negative about certain things. I thought in Brazil there was definitely room for improvement, for example. It’s still a bit weird having to now then deal with a different race director.” Charles Leclerc of Ferrari wondered why the move was made with only three races to go.  “To do it so late in the season, at such a crucial moment of the season, it could have probably been managed in a better way,” he said. The drivers have consistently asked for clearer guidelines in the officiating of races, specifically regarding track limits and racing rules. The drivers have no idea how Marques will officiate, highlighting a disconnect between the competitors and Ben Sulaymen's FIA.   “We just want to be transparent with the FIA and have this dialogue that is happening,” Russell said. “And I think the departure of Niels is also a prime example of not being a part of these conversations.” The GDPA statement made clear the drivers do not think their voice is being heard.  “If we feel we’re being listened to, and some of the changes that we are requesting are implemented, because ultimately we’re only doing it for the benefit of the sport, then maybe our confidence will increase,” Russell said. “But I think there’s a number of drivers who feel a bit fed up with the whole situation. It only seems to be going in the wrong direction.” He also said the relationship between the drivers and the FIA seems fractured.  “Sometimes just hiring and firing is not the solution,” he said. “You need to work together to improve the problem.” Norris, who has battled Verstappen this year with mixed officiating rulings, said “obviously things are not running as smoothly as what we would want.”  Marques has his first driver meeting ahead of Thursday night's two practice sessions and then three weeks to prove to the competitors he is up for the job.  Carlos Sainz Jr., who will leave Ferrari for Williams at the end of the season, hopes the drama doesn't distract from the momentum F1 has built over the last five years.  “I think Formula 1 is in a great moment right now and all these rumors, I think in every team, every job, there's job changes,” he said. “It's not big drama. I'm a big fan of the people you mentioned, they've done an incredible job in Formula 1 and Formula 1 is what it is thanks to these people. But it's just so emotional, especially the Stefano one. The only one that has a real effect is the race director. But I think if he does a good job, it should be transparent and nothing big.” ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21,1,0.47,0.53

Items belonging to former Red Sox President and CEO Larry Lucchino, who died in April at the age of 78, will be auctioned starting Saturday with proceeds going to The Lucchino Family Foundation, which funds charities throughout New England. “My brother, Larry, embodied the spirit of generosity,” said Frank Lucchino, a retired judge from Pennsylvania. Items include Lucchino’s Commissioner’s Trophy and ring from the curse-ending 2004 World Series in which the Red Sox had to first beat the New York Yankees for the opportunity to face the St. Louis Cardinals in the series. Two other championship trophies from Lucchino’s tenure, 2007 and 2013, are being auctioned along with another one from 2018. Other items include 2004 and 2007 championship banners that flew at Fenway Park, a couple of stadium seats and a turnstile, and an electric guitar signed by Boston rockers Aerosmith when they played at Fenway in 2010. Lucchino served as Baltimore Orioles president, leading the effort to build Camden Yards, before doing the same thing for the San Diego Padres — building another new ballpark. In Boston, he helped to assemble the new ownership group led by John Henry and Tom Werner that bought the franchise in 2002. The group opted to renovate rather than replace Fenway Park, which opened in 1912, preserving the oldest ballpark in Major League Baseball for future generations. The online auction is being handled by Bonhams Skinner. Included in the auction are non-Red Sox items owned by Lucchino, such as a World Series ring won with the Orioles and a Super Bowl ring from Washington. Robin Starr from Bonhams Skinner said it was an honor for a Boston-based auction house to handle the auction.  ""Larry Lucchino’s lasting impact on the Boston Red Sox and Major League Baseball as a whole is undeniable,” she said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21,0,0.56,0.44

ABC News: Sports,It's getting harder to stay on the PGA Tour. Here's why,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/harder-stay-pga-tour-116115451,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:50:28 -0500",The PGA Tour is making sweeping changes to its eligibility and it's only going to get more difficult to keep a tour card,"The PGA Tour is making sweeping changes to its eligibility and it's only going to get more difficult to keep a tour card The PGA Tour is making the most sweeping changes to its eligibility in more than 40 years by eliminating 25 tour cards, along with shrinking the size of its fields. The all-exempt tour had been in place since 1983, meaning the top 125 players from the official money list — now the FedEx Cup standings — kept a full PGA Tour card the following season. That changes in 2026 after the PGA Tour policy board approved a new priority list on Monday. Only the top 100 players will earn full tour cards for the following year. The top 30 from the developmental Korn Ferry Tour used to advance to the PGA Tour. That number now goes to 20. Five players from qualifying school will get cards — it previously was the top five and ties. The tour also is doing away with 156-man fields except for two tournaments held on multiple courses. Most tournaments will have 120 players before Daylight Saving Time, then 132 players in spring and a maximum of 144 players in the summer months. Here's a look at what's behind the changes and what it means: The all-exempt tour led to a bloated membership in which nearly 200 players were on the membership rolls through one exemption or another, and those toward the bottom of the priority list could not get into all the tournaments they wanted to play. Those who graduated from the Korn Ferry Tour, for example, could only get in three or four tournaments over the first few months of the season, giving them a disadvantage. The PGA Tour believes that limited full status to the top 100 instead of the top 125 will give everyone who earns a card a fair chance at getting into regular tournaments. Priority to get into tournaments starts with winners of the majors and The Players Championship over the last five years; winners of the Arnold Palmer Invitational, Memorial and Genesis Invitational the last three years; tournament winners the last two years and career money leaders. Next are the top 125; players who have been given a medical extension; and then the 45 players who earned cards from the Korn Ferry Tour, European tour and Q-school. After that are those who finished from No. 126 to No. 150 in the FedEx Cup. All of them have PGA Tour cards. But there's not room for them in every tournament. The most common refrain in golf is to play better to get better status. Those who perennially finish in the top 100 should have no trouble keeping their cards, and they will have fewer players to beat because the fields will be smaller. It also helps newcomers from the Korn Ferry Tour, European tour and Q-school. They can expect to get into every regular tournament, increasing their odds of getting into some of the $20 million signature events. The PGA Tour, already the strongest circuit in golf, is likely to be even more competitive with a greater chance of the top names in contention. The tour also hopes — this is still to be determined — it will improve the pace of play and keep rounds from spilling over into the next day. Players like Peter Malnati and Taylor Pendrith come to mind. Under the new system, neither would have had a full PGA Tour card this year and likely would not have been in the fields for the tournaments they won — Malnati at the Valspar Championship and Pendrith at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson. Those wins make them exempt through 2026. Players who have not performed consistently well, who seem to struggle each year just to finish in the top 125, will have to be at their best to stay on tour. The PGA Tour also is reducing the four spots from Monday qualifiers at open tournaments. Now there will only two spots for the 132-man fields and none for fields of 120 players. One of golf's charms is how one week can change a career. Then again, there has been only one Monday qualifier to win in the last five years — Corey Conners in the 2019 Texas Open. The new eligibility starts in 2026, so that puts a huge emphasis on playing well this year knowing that only the top 100 will keep full status. The four majors are not run by the PGA Tour. The Masters has the smallest field, typically fewer than 100 players. The U.S. Open, British Open and PGA Championship have 156-man fields. The Players Championship, the premier event run by the PGA Tour, is reducing its field from 144 players to 120. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21,0,0.56,0.44
ABC News: Sports,New Hampshire courts hear 2 cases on transgender girls playing girls sports,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/new-hampshire-court-hears-cases-transgender-girls-playing-116102227,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 20:02:14 -0500",Two New Hampshire fathers who were punished for wearing pink wristbands marked &ldquo;XX&rdquo; to represent female chromosomes at a high school soccer game say they didn't set out to harass or otherwise target a transgender athlete,"Two New Hampshire fathers who were punished for wearing pink wristbands marked “XX” to represent female chromosomes at a high school soccer game say they didn't set out to harass or otherwise target a transgender athlete CONCORD, N.H. -- Two New Hampshire fathers who were barred from school district events for wearing pink wristbands marked “XX” to represent female chromosomes insisted at a federal court hearing Thursday that they didn't set out to harass or otherwise target a transgender soccer player at the game they attended. But a judge hearing the case suggested the message the parents sent may matter more than their intentions. Kyle Fellers and Anthony Foote sued the Bow school district after being banned from school grounds for wearing the wristbands at their daughters' soccer game in September. The no-trespass orders have since expired, but a judge is deciding whether the plaintiffs should be allowed to wear the wristbands and carry signs at upcoming school events, including basketball games, swim meets and a music concert, while the case proceeds. Testifying at Thursday's hearing, both men said that they did not view the wristbands as a protest against Parker Tirrell, a transgender girl on the opposing team, but rather as a show of support for their daughters and their teammates. U.S. District Court Judge Steven McAuliffe questioned whether there is a meaningful distinction and whether their intentions matter.  “Sometimes the message you think you’re sending might not be the message that is being sent,” he said.  McAuliffe asked Foote whether it occurred to him that a transgender person might interpret the pink XX wristbands as an attempt to invalidate their existence. “If he’s a trans female, pink might be a color he likes,” Foote said. McAuliffe also noted that while both plaintiffs said they had no problem with transgender people outside the issue of sports, they repeatedly referred to the athlete in question as a boy. “You seem to go out of your way to suggest there’s no such thing as a trans girl,” McAuliffe said. Foote disagreed, saying it was “like learning a new language” to refer to transgender people. In a separate courtroom earlier Thursday, another judge held a hearing on a lawsuit brought by Parker Tirrell and another student challenging the state law that bans transgender athletes in grades 5 to 12 from teams that align with their gender identity. It requires schools to designate all teams as either girls, boys or coed, with eligibility determined based on students’ birth certificates “or other evidence.” U.S. District Court Chief Judge Landya McCafferty ruled earlier this year that the teens can try out for and play on girls school sports teams. The order only applies to those two individuals for now as they seek to overturn the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act on behalf of all transgender girl students in New Hampshire.  Lawyers for the teens said in court Thursday they hoped the matter could go to trial and be resolved before the start of the next school year in September. They said the teens’ school districts and others in the state have asked for guidance regarding the statute. Lawyers for the state said they needed more time to prepare.  Judge Talesha Saint-Marc suggested the timing of the trial was ambitious and asked that both sides talk further about scheduling.  Gov. Chris Sununu, who signed the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act into law in July, has said it “ensures fairness and safety in women’s sports by maintaining integrity and competitive balance in athletic competitions.” About half of states have adopted similar measures. In the Bow case, school district officials have said they acted appropriately in sanctioning the parents for conduct they knew violated school policy at athletic events. They'll explain their evidence on Friday. On Thursday, the plaintiff's lawyer, Endel Kolde, accused the district of “breathtaking” overreach by asserting that the wristbands target transgender students in general, regardless of whether such students were present at the events. “This is viewpoint discrimination, and it’s very clear they’re proud of it,” Kolde said. Kolde initially conceded that a school district can limit speech “to some degree” to protect children from harassment, but he stopped short of agreeing with the judge’s claim that yelling “transgender students out” at a particular player would be subject to such regulation. “It might be,” he said. “I’m trying to get you to concede the obvious,” McAuliffe said. “It’s less than obvious to me,” Kolde said. Feller, the first witness in the case involving the wristbands, said he purchased them thinking his daughter and her teammates would wear them, but ended up wearing one himself after they declined. After being told to leave the game, he stood in the parking lot with a sign that said “Protect women’s sports for female athletes.” “I wanted to support women’s sports and I believed what was going on was a travesty,” he said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21,0,0.52,0.48
ABC News: Sports,Colorado's 2-way star Travis Hunter eyes Big 12 title and more before 'for sure' entering NFL draft,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/colorados-2-star-travis-hunter-eyes-big-12-116112734,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:22:48 -0500","Travis Hunter made a pair of proclamations when he announced he&rsquo;s for sure turning pro after this season, but not until he sees Colorado all the way through the College Football Playoff should the Buffaloes make it there","Travis Hunter made a pair of proclamations when he announced he’s for sure turning pro after this season, but not until he sees Colorado all the way through the College Football Playoff should the Buffaloes make it there DENVER -- Travis Hunter made a pair of proclamations Thursday: He’s for sure entering the NFL draft after this season, but not until he sees Colorado all the way through the College Football Playoff — if the Buffaloes make it there. The first was already a given for the draft-eligible junior who plays both receiver and cornerback. The second is a risk-reward play for a projected high first-round pick who averages around 120 snaps a game. In years past, it took two extra postseason wins to capture a national title. Now, it could take up to four additional contests. That’s more of a chance to shine, but also more chance for an injury. “I don’t think nobody will opt out because you’re showing NFL teams that you’re more focused on something else, other than the team goal,” Hunter said of the expanded 12-team College Football Playoff. “So I don’t think players are going to opt out of the playoffs.”  Hunter and quarterback Shedeur Sanders chatted Thursday in a set of Zoom calls about turning around the program at Colorado (from 4-8 last season to bowl eligibility), chasing a Big 12 title, turning pro — Hunter acknowledged he will “for sure” — and, of course, the Heisman race, where Hunter is currently the odds-on favorite in an award each wants to see the other win. “He’s deserving of it, and if it’s between me and him, I want him to get it,” said Sanders, whose 16th-ranked Buffaloes (8-2, 6-1 Big 12, No. 16 CFP ) travel to Arrowhead Stadium to face Kansas (4-6, 3-4) this weekend. “He does a lot of amazing things that have never been done before.” Countered Hunter: “I know he wants me to win it, but I also want him to win as bad as I want to win it.” Hunter is a generational talent shining on both sides of the ball. As a receiver, he has 74 catches for 911 yards and nine touchdowns. On defense, he has picked off three passes, even though teams are reluctant to throw his direction. Like he did in high school and now in college, he believes he can do both on the next level. But he understands the trepidation of the NFL team that picks him. “They don’t want their top pick to go down too early,"" Hunter said. “I like when people tell me I can’t do it, because they just motivate me to continue to do what I want to do.” Sanders is turning in a stellar season as well with 27 touchdown passes, one away from tying Sefo Liufau for the most in a single season in program history. He's projected to be one of the first QBs off the draft board.  The future certainly looks bright at Colorado thanks to the legacies Sanders and Hunter under coach Deion Sanders. But that's a point to ponder later. “I can’t think too much forward past Saturday,” Shedeur Sanders cracked. “The main thing is winning the Big 12 championship. That’s the main thing we’re focused on."" ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

He wrote on X it was “time to close this chapter.” “This marks my transition from professional triathlon, a moment approached with both dread and excitement in equal measure,” he wrote. Brownlee said he was excited to try new challenges and had some “projects I’m eager to tackle.” But he knew his time as an elite triathlete was over. “It has got more difficult for me,” he said in an interview published on the website of Britain's Olympic team. “I can’t do anywhere near the training that I used to be able to do.

ABC News: Sports,Stephen Silas coaching USA Basketball in AmeriCup qualifying games this weekend,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/stephen-silas-coaching-usa-basketball-americup-qualifying-games-116108725,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 15:38:33 -0500",Stephen Silas has plenty of reasons why he wanted to coach for USA Basketball in the qualifying rounds of the FIBA AmeriCup tournament,"Stephen Silas has plenty of reasons why he wanted to coach for USA Basketball in the qualifying rounds of the FIBA AmeriCup tournament Stephen Silas has plenty of reasons why he wanted to coach for USA Basketball in the qualifying rounds of the FIBA AmeriCup tournament. Among them: his father. Paul Silas died two years ago and, despite a long career as an NBA coach, he never got the chance to be part of the national team. So, when USA Basketball called his son about this opportunity — games Friday and Monday in Washington, then two more qualifying games in February likely with a different roster — he jumped at the chance. “I'm coaching Team USA, which is amazing,"" Stephen Silas said. ""That's one part of it. And the other part of it is my dad never was on Team USA. He played in the league for 16 years, coached for 30 years and all that. And, unfortunately, he passed away, but I know he would be super proud that I’m coaching this team.” AmeriCup is the championship of the FIBA Americas region, and the U.S. is trying to qualify for the tournament that will be held next year in Nicaragua. The Americans play Puerto Rico on Friday and Bahamas on Monday, then go on the road to face those teams again Feb. 20 and 23. Silas will return for those games, though it's unknown how many players from this roster will be back for that window. There are four groups, all with four teams, and three teams from each group will make it to Nicaragua. The U.S., Puerto Rico, Bahamas and Cuba are all 1-1 through one stage of qualifying. Silas is just happy to be back on a bench. He spent three years as Houston's coach during a rebuild, going 59-177. And he was an assistant in Detroit last season, as the Pistons slogged through a 28-game losing streak on the way to a 14-68 mark. “You learn how tough you are. You learn how much you love basketball, to go through the last four years that I’ve gone through in the NBA,"" Silas said. “I still love to coach and want to coach after all those losses. It really makes me understand how much I love the game and love to coach and to see guys improve. And I’m looking forward to my next opportunity.” Silas has a long relationship with Patrick Ewing, the Hall of Fame player who won two Olympic gold medals for USA Basketball. They worked together as assistant coaches in Charlotte. And when Silas took the USA job, Ewing — the former Georgetown star player and then Georgetown coach, meaning these games in Washington are essentially a homecoming — was his first call. “He’s an amazing coach,"" Silas said. “He played under Pat Riley and John Thompson and Bobby Knight and Jeff Van Gundy, all these people. His basketball knowledge is so deep.” Silas basically hired Ewing for this job without telling USA men's national team director Sean Ford ahead of time. Silas called Ford after the fact and asked if it would be OK to have Ewing on the staff; Ford, as would be expected, had absolutely no issue with the move. Keith Smart, another former NBA head coach and assistant coach who won an NCAA title as a player at Indiana, also is on Silas' staff for these games. There are 12 players on the USA roster for these games and all 12 have NBA experience — some of it extensive. Robert Covington has played 614 games in the league, Tony Snell has played 601, Frank Kaminsky has played 413 and Chasson Randle has appeared in 119. Also with NBA experience: Henry Ellenson, Paul Watson, Jahmi’us Ramsey, Nate Hinton, Malik Williams, Dusty Hannahs, Javonte Smart and David Stockton. Combined, the group has played 1,988 NBA games and scored 15,462 points in the league. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21,1,0.37,0.63
ABC News: Sports,Narin An leads with a 64 in the wind as Nelly Korda struggles in LPGA finale,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/narin-leads-64-wind-nelly-korda-struggles-lpga-116115164,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:42:28 -0500",Narin An is the surprise first-round leader at the richest-paying event on the LPGA Tour,"Narin An is the surprise first-round leader at the richest-paying event on the LPGA Tour NAPLES, Fla. -- Narin An handled the windy conditions with a hot putter on Thursday, making four straight birdies around the turn and finishing with an 8-under 64 for a one-shot lead in the CME Group Tour Championship. At stake for the 60-player field is a $4 million prize to the winner, the largest single-day payoff in women's golf. Nelly Korda already has won more than that during her sterling season of seven wins. Now she faces an eight-shot deficit over the next three days at Tiburon Golf Club if she wants to end her year in fitting fashion. Korda, coming off a victory last week, couldn't make amends for her three bogeys and had to settle for an even-par 72. She has come from behind in four of her victories, and still has 54 holes ahead of her. But it has made the task that much tougher. Everything felt easy for An, a 28-year-old from South Korea who has never won on the LPGA and has never cracked the top 10 in any of the 16 majors she has played. “Today my putt really good,” An said. “The speed was good and the shape was good. I just try to focus a little bit more.” She had a one-shot lead over Angel Yin, who shot 30 on the back nine, including an eagle on the par-5 17th hole that most players can easily reach in two. Former U.S. Women's Open champion Allisen Corpuz and Marina Alex were at 66, with Lydia Ko leading the group at 67. Despite the wind so typical along the Gulf Coast of Florida, 27 players — nearly half the field — shot in the 60s. “It's a good head start for the big ol' prize we get at the end of the week,” Yin said. Whoever wins this week is assured of breaking the 17-year-old LPGA record for most money earned in season. The record was set by Lorena Ochoa in 2007 at $4,364,994, back when the total prize money was about half of what it is now. Ochoa earned $1 million for winning the Tour Championship in 2007. The opening round followed a big night of awards for the LPGA Tour, where Korda officially picked up her first award as player of the year, which she clinched earlier this month. Ko was recognized for her big year, highlighted by an Olympic gold medal that put her into the LPGA Hall of Fame. She regained plenty of focus for the opening round on a course where she won just two years ago. “The course isn't easy,” Ko said. “I set a goal of shooting 3 under today, and somebody shot 8 under. I was like, ‘OK, maybe I need to make a few more birdies.’ It's a course that can get away from you as much as you can shoot some low scores, so I’m just trying to stick to my game plan and go from there.” Also in the group at 67 was Albane Valenzuela of Switzerland, already celebrating a big year with her debut in the Solheim Cup and her first appearance in the Tour Championship. She made a late run at her first LPGA title last week at Pelican Golf Club, and kept up her form. And she can see the finish line, which is appealing. “I everyone is looking at that $4 million price tag,” Valenzuela said. “I try not to look too much at the result. I feel like in the past I’ve always been stuck on results, and ultimately all I can do is control my own round, my own energy, my own commitment. “It's the last week of the year. It’s kind of the bonus week. No matter what, everyone is having a paycheck.” ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21,1,0.42,0.58

The Capitals updated Ovechkin’s status Thursday after he was evaluated by team doctors upon returning from a three-game trip. The 39-year-old broke the leg in a shin-on-shin collision Monday night with Utah's Jack McBain, and some of his closest teammates knew it was not good news even before Ovechkin was listed as week to week and placed on injured reserve. “Everyone’s bummed out,” said winger Tom Wilson, who has played with Ovechkin since 2013. “We were sitting there saying: ‘This is weird. Like, it’s unbelievable that he’s actually hurt.’ It’s one of those things where like, he’s going to miss games? I’ve been around a long time, and it’s new to me.” Ovechkin in his first 19 seasons missed 59 games — and just 35 because of injury. Durability even while throwing his body around with his physical style is a big reason he is on track to pass Gretzky’s mark of 894 goals that once looked unapproachable. “He doesn’t go out there and just coast around,” Wilson said. “He’s played 20 years every shift running over guys and skating. He’s a power forward, the best goal-scorer ever maybe, and he’s a power forward that plays the game really hard.” Ovechkin surged to the top of the league with 15 goals in his first 18 games this season. He was on pace to break the record and score No. 895 sometime in February. “You know when goal-scorers start scoring, it’s dangerous,” said defenseman John Carlson, who has been teammates with Ovechkin since 2009-10. “There was a bit of that in the downs that everyone was feeling about it too, of course. We see him coming to the rink every day, we know what’s at stake. You never want anyone to get injured, but there’s a lot to it and certainly he was playing his best hockey in years.” ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21,1,0.49,0.51

In a tradition believed to have begun when Bill Russell’s 1963 Celtics met with President John F. Kennedy, Biden welcomed the NBA’s 2024 champions and gave them a tour of the Oval Office. In all, the league’s most-decorated franchise has won at least one title in eight of the last 13 presidential administrations. “The Celtics aren’t just a basketball team. They’re a way of life,” Biden told the crowd, quoting Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach before receiving a No. 46 jersey from All-Star Jayson Tatum and guard Derrick White. Biden noted that his secret service code name is “Celtic.”  “For real. Because I'm Irish,” the president said. “Everybody behind me is Irish in their heart. I feel a special pride in this trophy. From this old Irish Celtic, to all you Celtics, congratulations.”  Biden, who was once one of the youngest senators in U.S. history and is now the country’s oldest president ever, said he felt a kinship with Mazzulla, who was 35 when he led the Celtics to the title in his second season. “Joe’s the youngest head coach to win a title since the great Bill Russell,” Biden said. “I told him I used to be the youngest and now I’m the oldest. I liked being the youngest better.” The Celtics were greeted with a band playing “Shipping up to Boston,” before Biden and team owner Wyc Grousbeck joined them on the risers facing the Washington Monument; green lights shined from from the eaves of the White House behind them. Among those in attendance were Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and most of the state’s congressional delegation. “I didn’t really know what to expect. I walked in, I was like 'I’m more excited than I thought I was going be,” White told reporters afterward. “To be in the White House, to be where all the decisions — all the cool things — are happening, that was the best part.” Celtics co-owner Steve Pagliuca said Biden's 4-year-old grandson, Beau Jr., tried on his championship ring. (Oshae Brissett, a member of the 2024 team who is not with the Celtics this year, was at the ceremony and received his championship ring on Thursday.)  Biden also received a commemorative basketball, which he passed to Celtics center Al Horford. And then threw back and forth with a member of the crowd.  “I wasn’t expecting a pump fake,” White told reporters. “It’s harder to make a pass in a suit, so I was impressed.” Biden was well-briefed on the Celtics history and their success last year, when they cruised to 64 wins in the regular season – their most since winning the 2008 title, and the fourth-best in franchise history. They went 16-3 in the playoffs, eliminating the Dallas Mavericks in five games. Biden even noted that the ’24 Celtics had the highest ration of points per possession in NBA history – one of the wonkier stats, but one that had team vice president and stats guru Mike Zarren beaming. “The basketball stats community has come a long way: the President of the United States is talking about points per possession!” Zarren posted on X after speaking to reporters at the ceremony. Members of the Celtics organization went back into the White House after the festivities to meet with administration officials on pet issues, including “Raise the Age,” which seeks to have 18- to 20-year-olds treated as juveniles in the criminal justice system, and “Curbside Care,” which provides medical aid to new mothers in underserved communities. “This was a very exciting and moving day,” Grousbeck told reporters in a video call afterwards. “We had not been focused on this. We got through the banner and opening night, and then it was all business. Joe (Mazzulla) doesn’t want us to dwell too much on the past, he wants everyone to focus on moving forward. Having said that, everyone here, including Joe, seemed to have a great time.” Zarren said he spoke to a secret service agent who was a Celtics fan and had to bear with the Golden State Warriors’ visit two years ago. “He told them it was a bittersweet moment because he wished his Celtics were here. And they said to him, ‘Don’t worry, they’ll be here soon,’” Zarren said. “So for him, it was a good moment to see us show up inside there.” ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21,1,0.32,0.68
NYT > Sports,How Formula 1 Turns America’s Most Famous Road Into a Racetrack,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935914/2024/11/21/f1-vegas-gp-track-the-strip/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 22:17:59 +0000",The circuit in Las Vegas faces a tough challenge to open and close the Strip in merely hours: “It’s a science.”,"Formula 1 LAS VEGAS — Making a street race happen in Formula One is one of the toughest logistical challenges for the organizers of a grand prix. Each year in Monaco, Singapore and Baku, Azerbaijan, months of planning go into action to turn the center of a city into a racetrack for only a handful of days as the bumpy streets and beckoning walls pose a different challenge to the drivers than a normal circuit. Advertisement But for the Las Vegas Grand Prix, that challenge is only multiplied by the fact its circuit, which proved a hit among the drivers last year, incorporates one of the most famous roadways in the world: the Strip. “I was in Singapore with the race and chatting to the promoter, and they were like, ‘We don’t understand how you open and close the track the way you do,'” said Emily Prazer, the chief commercial officer of F1 and the Las Vegas Grand Prix. “They keep the roads closed for seven days. Can you imagine us telling the (Las Vegas) council we’re keeping the roads closed for seven days? It would just literally never happen, ever.” As F1 embarked on its ambitious plan to return to Las Vegas after almost 40 years away (and insisted on having the Strip as part of its 3.8-mile track layout), it needed a plan to keep it open as long as possible before preparing it for F1 action each night. The task of opening and closing the roads that are part of the circuit is overseen by Terry Miller, the general manager of the Las Vegas Grand Prix. The event site he’s responsible for covers 450 acres. “That’s a big area, not to mention the fact that we have more than 45 significant businesses around that track,” Miller told The Athletic. “One of those 45 businesses owns five different resorts. So the ability for us to manage the logistics of our track build is significant.” The circuit installation, including the barriers, fences and lighting, commenced after Labor Day weekend. Miller instructed his team to approach the track build a little differently than in year one: completing a lap in a similar fashion to the drivers. “This year, we were able to be a little more consistent and targeted as to how we were building the track,” he explained. “You have to build all the track lighting before you can put up any track barriers. “We started at one corner of the circuit, and we worked our way around the path (the driver takes) and added all of our track lighting, and then we followed that same pattern with our track barriers, and then we followed with all of our electronics.” As part of the agreement with the local authorities, no track barriers are put along Las Vegas Boulevard until 12 days before the race to try and minimize disruption. “They didn’t want to disturb Las Vegas Boulevard any sooner than necessary,” Miller said. “We did our internal logistics calculations, and we said we could try and get it done in 12 days prior to the race event.” Removing the barriers on the Strip is one of the first tasks after the race so it can be cleared before Thanksgiving four days later. Advertisement Preparing the Strip for the F1 cars to use the track every night is a scientific process, according to Miller, who conducted an extensive analysis of how his track crew last year worked to open and close the circuit. “We’d spent a lot of time with spreadsheets and stopwatches because we got it down to: How much time does it take to move a block? How much equipment, how many crews can you use at one time before they get into each others’ way?” he said. “It was a science last year, and that allowed us going into this year to do a little more ‘lab work’ on the science of how do you put all of this in place.” A team of 140 people works to open and close the track, assigned across 42 locations that open and close each day. There are 3,500 track barrier blocks, stretching out to 7.6 miles in length, twice the lap distance. Under the night sky, the track is illuminated by 1,750 temporary light units. Each of the 140 workers is assigned a duty with a “very specific set of logistics and equipment,” according to Miller. Training for the track opening and closing started in June to cover a team of 180, ensuring alternates are on standby in case any of the 140 drop out. “We don’t just leave it to guesswork,” Miller said. “It’s pretty sophisticated in terms of how we move that 140 group of crew people through that process.” Transforming the track from “open” to “closed” involves three stages. It starts as a “warm track,” remaining mostly open to public use so traffic can pass around the center of Las Vegas. This period ends at midnight Thursday (to allow the safety car to complete its high-speed tests) and lasts until 5 a.m. At 3 p.m., a transition period begins to prepare everything for on-track action before it becomes a “hot track” at 5 p.m. This phase lasts until 2 a.m. Friday, covering the first two practice sessions before another transition period to get the track back to “warm” again. Advertisement “We have identified the time it takes to move each barrier,” Miller said. “We’ve got barrier number one on this corner, and where it is staged will take three minutes to move into position, then it will take another five minutes for them to set it, put the debris fence in and lock up the spiral connections. We know down to the minute.” Although there is a two-hour window to complete the process, Miller wanted to work in a buffer. “We’ve got it in the matrix of exactly how we’re going to make the two hours work, and clearly what we do is we make sure that what we have established is a one hour and 45-minute window, so we’re training to that with the 15-minute interval,” he said. “It’s extremely detailed in terms of how we move through each one of these openings and closings.” Despite adding a support race, the Ferrari Challenge, to the schedule this year, everything has stayed the same for the open and closed track transition. A big buffer was put in place for the race’s first running in 2023, but the lessons from that year gave the organizers confidence that the race could handle something being added to the schedule. There can, of course, be incidents that lead to delays, such as the loose water valve cover that canceled FP1 and meant FP2 did not finish until 4 a.m. last year, but these are also planned for in conjunction with the FIA and the local authorities. “We’re also doing scenario planning with the local fire department and police department, to everything from incursion of a spectator — ‘How the heck did they get on the track, what happens, how do we do that?'” Miller said. “So the level of planning that goes into this event is extraordinary.” By midnight Sunday local time, the race will be complete, and the post-race celebrations will begin. Miller’s team will immediately start the dismantling process. By 4 a.m., the track is back to “warm,” meaning cars can move around, and a degree of normality can resume for those driving in the middle of Las Vegas. “By Christmas, we will have picked up everything,” Miller said. It’s a sizable undertaking, but one was required to make F1’s dream of racing along the Strip possible. For Miller, even after a long and varied career in sports event planning and execution, it has been a completely different animal. “I’ve been involved in the design and construction of NFL stadiums, Major League Baseball stadiums, soccer facilities and Olympic facilities,” Miller said. “I’ve been doing it for 44 years now. Nothing compares to what I’ve seen here in Vegas for the F1 project.” (Top photo: Dan Istitene / Formula 1 / Formula 1 via Getty Images) Luke Smith  is a Senior Writer covering Formula 1 for The Athletic.

NYT > Sports,She Walked Away From Her Soccer Career. Her Friend Didn’t Have the Chance.,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5921900/2024/11/21/nina-wilson-maddy-cusack-sheffield-united/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 22:17:59 +0000",How the death of a soccer player made one of her teammates quit playing the sport she loved: “Maddy would still be here if it wasn’t for football.”,"UK Women's Football She speaks from the heart, as a close friend of Maddy Cusack, and starts to explain why she has taken the life-changing decision to walk away from her professional career. “The game, as a whole, seems reluctant to change or accept criticism,” Nina Wilson tells The Athletic. “But if a player’s death is not a wake-up call for the entire game, I don’t know what is. Maddy would still be here if it wasn’t for football and the lack of support systems and, unless these issues are addressed properly, this will happen again.” Advertisement Wilson, 25, was a team-mate of Cusack’s at Sheffield United and, like her friend, there was a time when she was immensely proud to represent the club. “I feel like I was born to play football,” she says. “It has always been my passion. I played for the love of the game and I have always been so proud and grateful to be a professional player.” Today, though, she is announcing that she has decided to quit playing because she is so disillusioned by how the club — and women’s football as a whole — have responded to Cusack’s death and the failures, she believes, that led to a previously happy 27-year-old taking her own life. Wilson says she experienced the “worst six months of my life” after the appointment of Jonathan Morgan as the team’s manager. It left her, she says, “a shell of a person” and she gave evidence to that effect to the club-commissioned inquiry that, to the dismay of Cusack’s family, cleared Morgan of bullying or wrongdoing in relation to any player. Morgan, who denies causing Cusack’s emotional anguish, is now the subject of a Football Association investigation into an official complaint from her parents, David and Deborah, stating why they believe their eldest daughter “would still be with us had he not been appointed.” Morgan denies any form of bullying and says he is the victim of a witch hunt. Wilson, a goalkeeper with more than 100 career appearances, says her own experiences of Morgan left her feeling “worthless and extremely isolated” in line with the initial investigation’s findings that he could divide opinion among the players. Some found him caring and supportive. Others, including Wilson, reported that he could be divisive, even intimidating, and favoured certain players while ignoring and cold-shouldering others. Wilson’s reasons for going public are mostly because “the lessons haven’t been learned and it is difficult to feel like anything is changing or that football, as a whole, wants to make things better.” She wants to show solidarity with the Cusack family and, in doing so, she states: GO DEEPER Special report: Maddy Cusack - why her family want a new investigation into her death In ordinary circumstances, Wilson would be approaching the peak years of a playing career that has featured spells at London City Lionesses, Watford, Lewes and her hometown club, Brighton & Hove Albion. These, however, are not ordinary circumstances and she has decided to give up playing, after seven years as a professional, for as long as “football has its head in the sand and no one cares enough to want to change anything.” Advertisement Wilson has not tried to find another club since becoming a free agent in the summer. It has been her own choice and one of the reasons, she says, is that it would be harder to speak freely if she was still involved in the sport. “When I found out about Maddy, the first thing that multiple members of the team said was that ‘it could have been any of us.’ “As awful as it sounds, they were the direct conversations that were happening after Maddy died. There was a group of us who said it could have happened to us. Those players, including Maddy, regarded it as the worst times we had ever had in football and couldn’t have been in a darker place. “We’d been made to feel like we weren’t worth anything. It felt like we didn’t matter as people any more. Some of us just went off the radar and barely spoke for weeks and months on end. You could go into training and not be acknowledged by anyone all day.” Morgan took the Sheffield United job in February 2023, despite the club’s then head of women’s football, Zoe Johnson, emailing her colleagues during the selection process to warn them that, although she believed he was a good coach, he “doesn’t have a great reputation” within women’s football. His appointment coincided with Cusack losing her place as an automatic starter in a team where she was a fans’ favourite. She had played for Morgan before at Leicester City and, according to her family, it had left her with the clear impression that he disliked her. Wilson says she saw, close up, how her team-mate became “nervous and withdrawn” in Morgan’s presence and no longer seemed her usual self. “Maddy was always a massive leader in the team and such a confident person – that changed almost overnight. “She tried so hard to please him and do what was right by the team. She still trained hard, doing extra running and fitness sessions. If we ever asked, ‘You OK, Mads?’ she would turn it back in typical Maddy fashion, as if she was more worried about others. ‘Just getting my head down,’ she’d say, ‘are you OK, though?’ Advertisement “Both of us were in a very similar position whereby we couldn’t be ourselves any more. We couldn’t be that bubbly, confident person. The whole culture (under Morgan) had shifted massively. It was very divisive and it made no sense because, just a few months before, we were a really close team and all really good friends. “That’s what I loved about being there. I loved Sheffield and I loved being at the club. But a lot of us just shut down and stopped talking. We didn’t know who we could trust any more. It made it a horrible environment and if you tried to bring up issues with other people at the club you were either pushed further out or laughed off. The response was, ‘Well, he’s the manager.’ “Anyone who dared to speak out was completely frozen out. Other staff and players would walk past and not even acknowledge you. You felt like you were invisible, like you didn’t really matter. Multiple players, including myself and Maddy, were made to feel this way. We were seasoned players. We’ve all been dropped before; that’s just football. What’s not acceptable is to put people down so much they feel they have no value as a person.” In Wilson’s evidence to the club inquiry, seen by The Athletic, she states Morgan went out of his way to blank her and recalled how unhappy it made her, as a hard-working player with no disciplinary issues, when she reported back from a loan spell at Wolverhampton Wanderers and was informed she was not welcome to train with the rest of the squad. Morgan, she says, “made that decision without ever even talking to me… I’d never even met him.” She moved to Scotland in the summer of 2023 to join Hibernian for “a new start … to help me get that bubbly, upbeat person back.” However, she had been at her new club only a few weeks when she took the telephone call that turned her world upside down. “Maddy was gone,” she says. “I got the call while I was in my car before training and I already knew, without anyone having to tell me, that it was because of football.” Cusack, a former England Under-19 international, was United’s vice-captain and longest-serving player as well as working as a marketing executive in the club’s commercial department. She had previously played for Leicester, Birmingham City and Aston Villa, having come through the youth systems of Nottingham Forest and Chesterfield. Advertisement Fourteen months after her friend’s death, Wilson believes there needs to be much better support systems in place for players who need emotional and psychological help. It saddens her that “every club should be learning from Maddy’s death but, rather than looking at themselves, they would rather believe it was an one-off tragedy that won’t happen again. “I think it will happen again. And I know the family think it will happen again. So, are we just going to wait for that to happen? Does someone else need to lose their life? Because that’s what I ask myself every day.” GO DEEPER A year on from her death, let's talk about Maddy Cusack - and who she really was What many people might find shocking is how little, on average, players earn in the top two divisions, the Women’s Super League and Women’s Championship, and how that can add to the pressures that already exist from working in a highly competitive environment. Wilson had to find other ways to supplement her £6,000-a-year income, taking a job with the club’s community foundation as well as doing bar work in the evenings. It could be gruelling keeping down three jobs, especially at a time when the demands on players were higher than ever before. But that, she says, is one of the realities of the women’s game for many players. “The demands continue to increase, and so do the pressures, but the wages don’t, the provisions don’t and the player care doesn’t,” says Wilson. “We (the players) are the ones taking the hit for how much the profile of the game is growing. You’re earning the bare minimum in some cases but you’re made to feel you should be grateful for whatever you can get. It’s very easy to end up in a dark place and think, ‘What’s the point? Why have I given up everything for this?’” Against that backdrop, it can seem strange and unsatisfactory to Cusack’s family and friends that a tragedy of this nature has not led to greater scrutiny of the women’s game. “Most people (in the media) haven’t touched it,” says Wilson. “It (the coverage of women’s football) is all about ‘the image of the game.’ Nobody wants to make the game look bad. So nobody dares say anything and, if that comes at the detriment of the players, the people in higher positions seem OK with it. Advertisement “This should have been the main story of women’s football for months – not just in the week after Maddy died. This needs to upend everything in the game. We need to look at how we are failing players. It’s about the pressures that are put on players, the lack of support, the lack of available whistleblowing. It’s about making the game better and safer.” Other players, she adds, have been “silenced more or less” by the culture of a fast-expanding sport or because of non-disclosure agreements similar to the one that prevents another former United player from speaking about her own complaint against Morgan’s alleged “bully-like behaviours.” Morgan was sacked in February over revelations that he had a secret three-year affair with a teenage player while managing Leicester. He has said previously that he is confident the FA inquiry will exonerate him of any wrongdoing in relation to Cusack or any other United player. An inquest into Cusack’s death will be heard next year and, by going public, Wilson is making it clear she “doesn’t want Maddy’s family to feel they are alone in this fight.” She is aware, because she was there herself, that nobody senior from the club’s hierarchy attended the vigil outside Bramall Lane on September 20 to mark the anniversary of Cusack’s death. As for Cusack’s old shirt number, it seems remarkably hard-faced that the club have decided against retiring it despite a 1,200-name petition being raised by fans 11 months ago. “There’s clearly resistance,” says Wilson, “and that resistance feels extremely unnecessary. Maddy was ‘Miss Sheffield United’. She lived and breathed the club and I don’t know who else could ever wear her shirt. It (retiring her number) seems such an obvious thing to do.” Sheffield United and Morgan were approached for comment by The Athletic.  Advertisement An emotional Wilson was one of the speakers at the vigil, alongside Cusack’s youngest sister, Felicia, and used the occasion to urge her former club to rethink their position and understand “it sets a dangerous precedent to lose a member of our community and simply move on and forget, as it seems some organisations would like to.” In a statement, United told The Athletic: “There is currently a Football Association investigation ongoing with regards to a number of the points raised. Sheffield United have fully co-operated in this regard and continue to respectfully await the outcome.” The club say they are continuing “to grow and evolve, which includes transitioning from part-time to full-time” and that, as well as having a dedicated women’s safeguarding officer, a player-care officer and access to mental health first-aiders and wellbeing services, they have “further plans to strengthen the support staff.” United also say they have had an external and independent whistleblowing service in place since 2018 with Safecall, the Sunderland-based firm that carried out the investigation into Morgan on the club’s behalf. Wilson, however, says that in her two years at the club she was never made aware of an external whistleblowing service for players. Wilson is now on the committee of the MC8 charity foundation set up in her friend’s name. She had worn Cusack’s No 8 on her gloves at Hibernian and felt glad that, purely by coincidence, she had chosen 44 as her shirt number at the start of the season. “Maddy always supported me when I played,” she says. “I wanted to continue playing for her. But in the end, I couldn’t.” Instead, Wilson has been putting on mental-health workshops with various clubs, as well as coaching younger players. It is not clear when, if ever, she will pull on her gloves again. But she is determined to make good from bad. “A few people have said, ‘What about your career?’” she says. “I know I’m taking a risk. But I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t do what I thought was right. I can’t play football unless I love it. And my love for football won’t return until something changes and there is justice for Maddy.” (Top photos: Getty Images, courtesy of Nina Wilson; design: Eamonn Dalton) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,N.F.L. Sends Warning to Teams Regarding Burglaries of Players’ Homes,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938166/2024/11/21/nfl-security-alert-home-burglaries/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 22:17:59 +0000",The league’s alert comes after the homes of Kansas City stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce were burglarized last month.,"NFL By Dianna Russini, Larry Holder and Alex Andrejev The NFL sent a memo to teams from the league’s security branch earlier this week warning about the threat of burglary groups targeting the homes of professional athletes. The Athletic obtained a copy of the memo. This alert comes after burglaries at the homes of Kansas City Chiefs stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce last month. Two law enforcement officials told NBC News the FBI is working with local agencies to determine whether the recent burglaries are connected to a transnational crime syndicate. Per NBC’s report Wednesday, there has been no determination about who is responsible and the investigation is ongoing. Advertisement “The homes of professional athletes across multiple sports leagues have become increasingly targeted for burglaries by organized and skilled groups,” the NFL’s memo said. “Law enforcement officials have noted these groups appear to exploit team schedules to target athletes’ homes on game days.” The memo also included ways the groups survey players’ whereabouts and explained methods of entry into homes. The league security team provided recommendations regarding the use of social media, including avoiding posting images of expensive items or comments about hotel accommodations. The memo also spelled out methods of home security. The NFL issued this security alert to clubs to tell their players and staff about “organized and skilled” criminals increasingly targeting professional athletes' homes. pic.twitter.com/EoArE8dTw0 — Dianna Russini (@DMRussini) November 21, 2024  Mahomes addressed the incident involving his home last Wednesday, calling it “frustrating” and “disappointing.” “I can’t get into too many of the details because the investigation is still ongoing,” he said. “But obviously something that you don’t want to happen to really anybody, but obviously yourself.” Officers responded to a reported burglary shortly after midnight on Oct. 6 at Mahomes’ estate in Belton, Mo., according to a police report from the Cass County, Mo. Sheriff’s Office. Mahomes is not identified in the report, but the address listed matches public records for the three-time Super Bowl MVP quarterback. A day after the reported burglary at Mahomes’ home, another reported burglary occurred around 7:30 p.m. on Oct. 7 at a residence in Leawood, Kan., believed to belong to Kelce, according to a Leawood Police Department offense report. The Chiefs beat the New Orleans Saints at Arrowhead Stadium in a “Monday Night Football” game that night with Taylor Swift, Kelce’s girlfriend, in attendance. Advertisement The police report for the incident indicated that $20,000 in cash was taken and that there was $1,000 worth of damage to a rear door. A spokesperson for the Leawood Police Department declined to provide additional details, saying the department does not release victim information except in cases of fatalities, crashes and homicides.

NYT > Sports,Matthew Gaudreau Was So Much More Than the Brother of Johnny Hockey,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5930652/2024/11/20/matthew-gaudreau-boston-college/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 22:17:59 +0000","The brothers died after being struck by a car on Aug. 29. For some, the sense of loss still hasn’t sunk in.","NHL His brother was Johnny Hockey. He had the Matty Dance. Ask any of Matthew Gaudreau’s childhood buddies about his moves, and they’ll chuckle knowingly. Gaudreau and his group of friends, which included his older brother, John, loved country music, especially Kenny Chesney. They regularly tailgated before concerts in college and in the years that followed. The group gathered early those summer days. They ate Wawa breakfast sandwiches on the way in. They sipped beer in stadium parking lots, leaving red plastic cups scattered near the cooler, and grilled for dinner. These were all-day affairs. Advertisement And at some point, without a doubt, Matty Gaudreau would find his way onto the back of someone’s truck, often when a Chesney song blared over the speakers. He’d break out the Matty Dance. “Just swinging his arms around in a circular, slow motion,” says friend Eric Robinson. “Some version of a windmill with a hip thrust,” adds Hunter Brody. They can still see it. This is who Matthew Gaudreau was: a life-of-the-party presence, arms waving through the air. When his widow, Madeline, spoke at his funeral, she described him as so much more than a hockey player, coach and friend. That’s a consensus among people who loved him. He was someone who made a point to connect with others, be it his high school teachers or younger teammates at Boston College. Someone who never felt jealous of his older brother, a more skilled player who became an NHL star. Someone who cried when he heard his unborn son’s heartbeat for the first time. On Aug. 29, Matthew and John — his closest friend — were biking in Oldmans Township, N.J., when a Jeep Grand Cherokee struck them from behind. Both were pronounced dead at the scene. John was 31, Matthew 29. Their sister Katie’s wedding was scheduled for the next day. When talking about Gaudreau, those who knew him often slip into the present tense. His death is still so recent that, for some, it doesn’t feel real that he’s gone. Perhaps it never will. The Gaudreau brothers grew up in a white, two-story house in Penns Grove, N.J., a small town southwest of Philadelphia. They regularly hosted their friends for bonfires and evenings at the backyard pool. Brody, who grew close with Matthew in high school, felt like he was there every summer night when he was younger. Matthew and John shared a bedroom overlooking the gravel driveway. Old hockey jerseys hung from the walls. When friends spent the night, the brothers pushed their beds together so more people could fit. Others would fight over air mattresses, trying to avoid the one with a hole in it. They’d get up in the mornings for training sessions and skates, then often find themselves back at the house again at night. Advertisement The Gaudreaus were as tight-knit a family as could be. Community mattered. Their house was the center of it all. Matthew was slight in build. Friends remember waking up to Guy Gaudreau, his dad, whipping up breakfast. He’d pile eggs and bacon on Matthew’s plate, trying to help him put on weight. Sometimes Matthew would get so full he’d shove eggs to the family dog, Sadie, while Guy was looking away. The weight never stuck. When teams took measurements, Matthew would sometimes stuff pucks in his jock strap to trick the scale. His wife said in her eulogy that she thought he looked 90 pounds when they met as teenagers. The Gaudreau name carries weight in the South Jersey hockey community. Guy worked as the hockey director at Hollydell Ice Arena in Sewell, N.J., not far from Penns Grove. Dan Spencer, now an emergency backup goalie for the Flyers, calls Gaudreau the best coach he ever had. John Gaudreau, Eric Robinson, Buddy Robinson and Tony DeAngelo played at Hollydell growing up and went on to appear in NHL games. Plenty of other college players like Matthew started their careers there. “There are a crazy number of people who came out of Hollydell for being a small rink in South Jersey,” says Eric Robinson, now a forward on the Hurricanes. Boston College coach Jerry York once asked Guy how he taught Johnny and Matthew such good edge control. He replied that he trained them with Skittles. He’d throw one on the ice, and the boys would have to skate to it. Then he’d throw another. On top of his responsibilities at Hollydell, Gaudreau coached the Gloucester Catholic High team. In 2009-10, Matthew’s freshman year and John’s junior year, the team went 15-4-2 and made its first-ever state championship. Though the Rams lost, both boys had a point in the final. Years later, Matthew would describe his days on the Gloucester team as the most fun he ever had playing hockey. Advertisement Close as they were, the brothers had different personalities. Principal Thomas Iacovone remembers John as the quieter of the two. He wanted to fade into the background. He wanted to be like any other kid. “Matty wanted you to know he was there,” he says. “He did it in such a way that you couldn’t help but to love him.” Iacovone was a history teacher when Matthew was in school and taught him in first-period homeroom his sophomore year. Matthew pulled his chair up to Iacovone’s desk seemingly every morning. They chatted about Philadelphia sports while waiting for the morning announcements. Rarely did the conversations revolve around Gaudreau himself. “He would engage me in what he knew I liked, and I was the teacher,” Iacovone says. “It should’ve been the other way around.” Once class began, Iacovone occasionally had to tell Gaudreau to sit down and be quiet. That was difficult, though; it usually resulted in Gaudreau cracking a joke that made him laugh. He was too charming to get in trouble, remembers now-athletic director Ryan Murphy, then an assistant athletic director. Matthew left Gloucester Catholic early to play junior hockey in Omaha, where he met his wife and skated for the Lancers, a United States Hockey League club. In the week before moving away from New Jersey, he and Brody embarked on a morning fishing trip. They left at 5 a.m. Gaudreau was sad about leaving the friends he made at Gloucester Catholic, Brody remembers, but he was excited, too. This was a big step: at that age, junior hockey felt like the biggest thing in the world. They stood in the dark, shoes muddy. Bugs bit their exposed skin as they cast their lines into the water. Their futures lay ahead of them. Matthew and John were determined to play college hockey together, and John found himself in a lurch in June 2011, months before his freshman year. He had committed to Northeastern, but coach Greg Cronin had just left for a job as a Maple Leafs assistant. The older Gaudreau brother got out of his letter of intent because of the coaching change, but then he needed to find a new school — and fast. Advertisement Not long after, the Gaudreau brothers and their parents were on Boston College’s campus. Future NHLer Kevin Hayes showed the boys around, York remembers, while he talked to the parents. After they were done, they stood in front of the rink. “Well, what do you guys think?” York asked. “Any questions?” John turned to his younger brother. That’s whose opinion mattered to him. “Let’s go here,” Matthew replied. And so they did. Their mother, Jane, said in a 2014 New York Times article that Matthew actually preferred Boston University, but he chose the Eagles when John gave him the final decision because he knew it was what his older brother wanted. “He was kind of a dynamic presence in their relationship, almost like he was the older brother,” York says of Matthew. “Johnny looked for advice from Matty an awful lot.” The decision had a major impact on both the program and the brothers. John was a point-per-game player as a freshman, two years before Matthew arrived on campus. The Eagles won the NCAA title that season. The season Matthew got to school, John won the Hobey Baker Award as the nation’s top collegiate player. Matthew played in only eight games that year. Not once, though, did he show a hint of jealousy. “He was his No. 1 fan,” says teammate Mike Matheson, a now-Canadiens defenseman who was the grade between the brothers. “They were just inseparable.” Though Matthew was not a lineup regular, he still had an important role with the team. Matheson remembers Matthew, aided by his relationship with John, acting as a bridge between the freshmen and upperclassmen. He made sure everyone was involved and did so throughout his time at Boston College. Classmate Ryan Fitzgerald describes him as “everybody’s first call.” Whenever someone wanted to do something, they called Matthew. Advertisement “As cliquey as he could have been, he was always setting stuff up for everybody, making sure everyone was there, making sure every guy was happy and comfortable,” says Zach Sanford, who was a year below Matthew. Fitzgerald and Matthew lived together in six-person, on-campus suites their sophomore to senior years. One day rolled into the next: class, hockey and then hours on the couch talking the time away with their roommates. Those, Fitzgerald says, are memories he’ll always hold close. Matthew and Madeline were managing long-distance dating at the time, and she would visit frequently. Fitzgerald loved seeing how his friend’s face lit up with her in the room. He jokes she was their mother roommate. The hockey players lived like, well, college boys. She was disgusted whenever she arrived. She’d tell Matthew and his friends they couldn’t keep living like this. They’d all agree with her — temporarily, at least. “And then she’d come back a month later, and it’d look like a bomb went off,” Fitzgerald says. From a hockey perspective, sitting out most of his freshman year couldn’t have been easy for Matthew, who played more than 50 games each of the previous two seasons in Omaha. He didn’t let that show. York remembers him focusing through video work and prescouts of other teams, remaining ready at all times. This wasn’t a typical throwaway year for a kid who wasn’t playing much. He made sure to gain experience. Matheson describes Gaudreau as “the best I’ve ever seen” at handling being a scratch. Fitzgerald doesn’t think he’d have handled it as well. But Matthew savored his year as college teammates with his brother. Gaudreau’s attitude eventually paid off. He played in most games his sophomore and junior seasons, then never came out of the lineup as a senior. He was nearly a point-per-game player by graduation, scoring eight goals and 35 points in 40 games his final season with the Eagles. Advertisement Though his skill showed by the time he left Boston College, Matthew had different elements to his game than his brother. Despite his 5-foot-9, 137-pound frame, “he was a little s— disturber,” Fitzgerald says. He didn’t shy away from scrums. His senior season — the same year John won the NHL’s Lady Byng Trophy for gentlemanly conduct — Matthew was one of only two Boston College players with more than 50 penalty minutes. Though similarly small, John was better at eluding contact, York remembers. Matthew would take huge hits. But he always seemed to get right back up, even when York prepared to send the trainers on the ice. “It was like he had a heart of steel,” the coach says. By the time Matthew graduated, he was ready to pursue professional hockey — something York thought seemed improbable at earlier points during his college career. He willed himself to that point. Graduation itself was memorable for Fitzgerald. The night before, the hockey players skipped the senior class celebration, instead going out on their own. “I don’t think any of us slept,” he says. Wearing black robes the next day, Matthew and Fitzgerald, both communication majors, joined their classmates for a procession through campus. As they waited, a woman came by asking if anyone wanted to lead the students while holding a large, maroon Boston College flag over their head. “I’ll do it!” Matthew called out. Fitzgerald still laughs thinking about it. All these communications majors had probably spent the entire night before together, but there leading the way was Matthew Gaudreau, bags under his eyes from one last college all-nighter with his friends. Gaudreau carved out a professional playing career for as long as he could. Most of his games came in the ECHL, two rungs below the NHL, but he appeared in 21 AHL games, too, and also had a brief stint playing in Sweden. Gaudreau looked like a hockey lifer, just like his dad. Ryan Murphy, the Gloucester Catholic athletic director, remembers Guy telling him at one point that Matthew would become a great coach. While with the ECHL team in Worcester, less than an hour out of Boston, he’d swing by his college to say hi to York and the Eagles. York, who was always impressed with how well Gaudreau observed the game, remembers his former player asking questions about coaching on those visits. Advertisement “The promise of life he had coming …” York says, trailing off. When John emerged as an NHL player, he began hosting offseason skills camps for kids at Hollydell. Robinson remembers going to the locker room with the brothers before camps began. Without fail, John would ask Matthew what drills they should do. The friend group joked that the younger brother was becoming his dad. “He had a knack for it,” Robinson says. “For whatever reason, some guys who play, they can transition into that.” Gaudreau got his coaching start with Philadelphia Hockey Club, which practiced at — where else? — Hollydell Ice Arena. The next season, 2022-23, a new opportunity arose: Gloucester Catholic needed a new hockey coach. Matthew met with Iacovone and Ryan Meehan, then the athletic director, at an Italian restaurant near Hollydell. They talked for two hours, mainly about life outside of the sport. When it came to the job, Iacovone told Gaudreau he was his No. 1 choice — and he didn’t have a No. 2. A few days later, Gaudreau accepted the position his dad once held. His goal was to make a career out of coaching, and he was on his way. Guy joined his son’s staff as an assistant for 2022-23, and so did Spencer, his former Gloucester teammate. The team went 9-9-2 and made a run to the state semifinal. Billy Sheridan, a player on that team, remembers he could walk into Gaudreau’s office at any time and ask for help. During his time as Gloucester coach, Gaudreau tried to get his players to recognize how special high school hockey is. “You guys don’t realize it,” he’d tell them, “but this is going to be the best four years of your life.” The next season was more difficult. Key players graduated, and the team’s numbers dipped to around a dozen. It was hard to hold complete practices with so few players, and Gaudreau himself had to miss at times because of commitments as an assistant coach for the Philadelphia Rebels, the Hollydell-based junior team. Gloucester didn’t win a game that season. After it ended, Gaudreau met again with Iacovone. He felt it was best to step away. He couldn’t commit fully to the team and didn’t feel that was fair to the players. Plus, he had his first baby, Tripp, on the way. Life was going to get busy. Madeline Gaudreau wore a pink dress with a white floral pattern as she stepped to the marble podium at St. Mary Magdalen Catholic Church in Media, Pa. During her eulogy, she spoke of her husband’s bond with John, how they loved sharing a bedroom growing up and never wanted it to change. It brings her comfort that they are still together. Advertisement “Anyone who knows Matty knows he was born to be a dad,” she said toward the end of the speech, stopping to compose herself. The idea of fatherhood consumed Matthew. He asked John for advice, ordered books and researched diaper brands. Iacovone remembers how excited he was when he saw him over the summer. Matthew never got to meet baby Tripp, who is due next month, according to Madeline’s Instagram account. Tributes have rolled in since his death. Hollydell held a memorial for the boys. Gloucester Catholic did, too, during which the hockey team presented Guy and Jane with a jersey. Both the Flyers and Blue Jackets have given Guy the chance to help with team practices. The Gaudreau family wanted loved ones to stop by their house in the days after John and Matthew’s deaths. People brought coffee and meals. During one visit, Brody went upstairs to Matthew and John’s old room, the site of their teenage sleepovers. It looked unchanged from when they were kids. He got the same feeling Madeline experiences when standing in baby Tripp’s nursery. They can feel Matthew with them. (Illustration: Meech Robinson / The Athletic.

NYT > Sports,It’s Her Serve and She’ll Do It Underarm if She Wants to,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936031/2024/11/21/sara-errani-tennis-player-italy-serve/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 22:17:59 +0000",Sara Errani regularly serves slower than a club player. She also has a career Golden Slam in doubles.,"Tennis MALAGA, Spain — Sara Errani stands at the baseline and exhales deeply. She is about to hit a second serve, with Italy up match point against Poland. A place in the Billie Jean King Cup final is at stake. So Errani does what she has done many, many times before: she hits an underarm serve. The ball floats into the service box and onto the racket of Iga Swiatek, one of two women’s players who can claim to be the best in the world. Swiatek is on to it in a flash and hits her return deep to Errani’s forehand. Errani again does what she has done many, many times before: she gets the ball back. Advertisement She does the same on her opponent’s next shot, hoisting a backhand lob into the air. Swiatek loops a forehand volley long and Italy is through to the final for the second year in a row. Errani collapses to the ground in relief, celebrating with her partner Jasmine Paolini and shaking hands with the defeated opponents a few seconds later, before allowing herself a what-have-I-just-done smile.  For Errani, 37, it was another successful heist in a career full of them. On Wednesday, she added a fourth Billie Jean King Cup title (three of which came when it was the Federation Cup) to the career Golden Grand Slam in doubles she completed this year by winning gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics alongside Paolini. It has been a stunning year for Errani, who also won the mixed doubles title at the U.S. Open with another Italian, Andrea Vavassori. She thought 2024 would be her last on tour, having won her last major 10 years ago. “My thought last year was to play in the Olympics and then stop playing tennis, but we’re playing great in doubles and I’m having so much fun,” she said in an interview in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, at the WTA Tour Finals earlier this month. Completing the doubles Golden Slam in Paris put Errani in an elite group of just seven women. When looking back on her career, the underarm serve to Swiatek on Monday will feel like a defining moment for a player who uses the contentious tactic more consistently and more particularly than anybody else. Her story with the underarm serve goes to the heart of her tennis life. The underarm serve is one of tennis’s most curious shots, caught between the poles of disrespectful trick shot and tactical masterstroke. Big servers like Nick Kyrgios can use it to take advantage of opponents who are standing back anticipating a 140mph rocket. There is an element of showmanship too; this is very much the case with Alexander Bublik. He might be blessed with a big serve, but he is also the current player probably most synonymous with the cheeky alternative. Advertisement Other players use it against specific opponents. World No. 68 Alexandre Muller told The Athletic at Wimbledon that he had specifically practised the shot to use it against Daniil Medvedev, who has one of the deepest return positions in the sport. Corentin Moutet, a master of the shot, started practising underarm serves after a shoulder injury. He has since incorporated them into his game, doing so to great acclaim at this year’s French Open. He used the underarm serve 12 times in his third-round win against Sebastian Ofner, winning nine of those points. He is the opposite of a player like Kyrgios, using the underarm serve because he doesn’t expect to win free points behind his first serve; there is no drop-off in expected value. GO DEEPER How Corentin Moutet's 12 underarm serves shook Roland Garros Errani’s reason for using the shot will be familiar to many amateur players: she just doesn’t trust her serve. Errani stands at 5ft 5in (164cm) which is diminutive by modern tennis standards — just like her partner Paolini, whose serve has some heat despite her height of 5ft 4in. Errani does not have this pace, and her height has contributed to a shot often derided as the worst serve in the sport. Smiling, she says it would be amazing to be a bit taller. “Many times, I think about that.” Instead of letting her serve become a complete albatross, Errani has used her ground skills, tactical nous and the shock factor of a serve that regularly registers around 60mph (96.5kph) on the speed gun to reach the very top of tennis in singles and doubles. She reached the 2012 French Open final in singles and cracked the world’s top five a year later, despite her opponents feeling that they ought to break her every single game. Instead, they are bamboozled by her incredible dexterity at the net or from the back of the court, as well as struggling to read and return her serve. “It comes so slow and it kind of floats in the air,” Mirjana Lucic-Baroni said in a news conference after losing to Errani in the 2014 U.S. Open fourth round, a match in which Errani’s average serve speed was 76mph. “It was really difficult to time the balls.” Errani’s serve became something of a meme in 2024 after Daniil Medvedev completely failed to return it at all during a mixed doubles match at the Paris Olympics. Advertisement Errani herself said in a news conference after that match that she has a different approach to serving from most players: “I don’t try to make winners,” she said. “I just try to make kick, make slice, try to change my game. I need to start the point where I want. So sometimes is better for me to serve not that fast, because if you serve fast the ball is coming (back) faster.” That conviction hasn’t always been there. Her serve reached a nadir in April 2019 when she was only recently back from a 10-month doping suspension for ingesting letrozole, which was increased from an original two months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Errani said she was “really disgusted” by the length of the ban, saying that her case was because of contamination after her mother, who was taking letrozole for breast cancer, dropped pills on their kitchen counter where they prepared meals. At the Copa Colsanitas in Bogota, Colombia, Errani served 18 double faults per match in three consecutive matches (all of which she won) before hitting around half her serves underarm in a quarter-final defeat to Astra Sharma. Later that year at a low-level event in Asuncion, Paraguay, Errani took the nuclear option by serving underarm for the entire tournament. She reached the final, copping a huge amount of social media abuse in the process. In response, she wrote on Instagram: “In Italy, I keep being insulted by a lot of people, regarding mainly my serve. “If it is not ok for you, send a letter to WTA asking to change rules about serve or ask them to disqualify me for awful serve. If instead you just have other problems with me, send a letter to Santa.” Five years on, she says her serve had completely overtaken everything else. “I couldn’t compete. I was thinking all the time about my serve,” she says. Advertisement “My coach said: ‘Do one tournament all underarm and just compete.’ It was to try to make my head free from, not panic, but the tough moments.” Despite recovering from those yips, Errani then endured an anxiety dream of a service game at the 2020 French Open during a second-round defeat to Kiki Bertens. Errani was given two time violations after five aborted ball tosses and landed only one overarm serve, with one attempt missing the baseline. Serving for the set, she was broken to love.  “Sometimes it’s there and it can come out, but I try to manage it,” she says of the nerves that can grip her when serving. “When I was practising, my serve was good. But then in matches, I was feeling the block, the panic. I know it’s still there. It’s not like it’s in the past.” Errani, an unwitting trailblazer, can laugh at the fact that the underarm serve has come back into fashion, certainly on the men’s side, over the past few years. “If it can be a good tactic, why not?” she laughs. Against Swiatek, the decision was more of a vibe. “I just advised Jasmine after the first serve, so it’s just I feel it and I did it, just like that, not thinking too much,” she said in a news conference after the match. At 37, Errani is the Italian team’s most experienced player, and as her team-mates chorused in Wednesday’s celebratory news conference she is “the brain of the team”. Errani resembles her compatriot Jorginho, the Brazilian-born Italy and Arsenal midfielder who is so intelligent that he is a reference point for everybody else despite not being the most physically gifted. GO DEEPER Jorginho exclusive: Arsenal 'energy', no-hop penalties, love for Havertz, knowing strengths Paolini, who is the world No. 4 in singles and a two-time Grand Slam finalist this year, constantly looks to Errani for guidance on the doubles court. “She wants me to tell her what to do every point – even when she serves, she likes me to tell her where to put it and I’m trying to push her to tell me what she’s feeling more,” Errani said. Whatever the tactics, the Errani-Paolini partnership is contributing to a golden period for tennis in Italy. On the men’s side, Jannik Sinner is the world No. 1 and has won two Grand Slams this year. He is part of an Italy team that is hoping to defend the Davis Cup this week and make it a double with the victorious BJK Cup group. Errani, who lived through a period when she was one of the ‘Fab Four’ Italian women who all reached a Grand Slam final and the world’s top 10 between 2010 and 2014 (Francesca Schiavone, Roberta Vinci and Flavia Pennetta were the others), believes that all the current top players from her country are pushing each other to greater heights. Advertisement And Errani has no desire to leave the golden age behind just yet.  “I said to Jasmine: ‘I’ll continue next year for sure and then we’ll see,’” she says. After the genre-defining underarm serve against Swiatek, this wily veteran still has at least one last heist in her.

NYT > Sports,Which Team Will Sign Juan Soto? Here’s a Ranking of the Suitors.,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935858/2024/11/21/mlb-juan-soto-free-agency-teams-suitors/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 22:17:59 +0000","Five teams — the Mets, Yankees, Dodgers, Red Sox and Blue Jays — have met with Soto and his agent already.","MLB Three weeks into this MLB offseason, two questions dominate the discussion across the sport: Which team will sign Juan Soto? And for how much? The Soto sweepstakes are heating up. Five teams — the Mets, Yankees, Dodgers, Red Sox and Blue Jays — have met with Soto and his agent, Scott Boras, to make their initial pitches. A sixth team, the Phillies, is expected to sit down with Soto soon, and more could follow. Advertisement The teams know they have a chance to sign a generational player who is just entering his prime. They also know it’ll cost them. Soto’s contract is expected to break records in terms of both average annual value and present-day value (as calculated for luxury tax purposes), but not surpass the total amount of Shohei Ohtani’s heavily deferred 10-year, $700 million deal with the Dodgers from last offseason. Sources with the involved teams believe the Soto contract will end up being $550 million to $650 million, depending on the structure of the deal, and 10 to 15 years, depending on luxury tax impact and other factors that could benefit the team in terms of length. (For comparison’s sake, keep in mind Ohtani’s $700 million deal had a net present value of $460 million for luxury tax purposes because of all the deferrals. The next largest contracts in MLB history were Mike Trout at $426 million, Mookie Betts at $365 million and Aaron Judge at $360 million.) I predicted a 15-year, $622 million contract when I finalized my top free agent ranking in late October. I believed Soto would get $622 million because he is only 26, has one of the best hit tools the game has ever seen, and should age well. Fifteen years makes sense when you consider many superstar players have signed deals that run until they’re at least 40, even though the backends of those contracts rarely work out well for the teams. Those are eye-popping numbers, but they’re really not surprising given the player. A player who will be entering his age-26 season. A player who has already been to two World Series. A player who is comparable to Ted Williams with 40-home run power. Sure, Soto is only adequate defensively in the outfield — though he was a Gold Glove Award finalist this year — but he has a strong and accurate arm. Sure, he doesn’t possess blazing speed or get good leads, but he is a smart, instinctive base runner. Advertisement He’ll go down in history as one of the best on-base percentage players of all time. His bat plays at the highest level against the best pitching. His penchant for the dramatic is well-documented. All the cliches apply: He wants to be at the plate in the biggest moments, on the biggest stages — and he’s proven he’ll perform, as he demonstrated with a sensational walk-year season in New York that included a three-run homer that propelled the Yankees to their first World Series in 15 years. May we once again re-introduce, The Generational, Juan Soto. pic.twitter.com/6R5fWpEg6I — New York Yankees (@Yankees) October 20, 2024  After the World Series, Soto followed the Boras script to a T when he spoke to the media. “I don’t know what teams want to come after me, but definitely, I’ll be open to this and every single team,” Soto said. “I don’t have any doors closed or anything like that. I’m going to be available for all 30 teams.” Soto said he was open to any team, even if that might not be the case, because that’s the best way to get the best offer, and it’s surely what his agency advised. If a player wants a particular destination, Boras and his lieutenants don’t want anyone to know until the end of the process, so they can maximize the offer, let all the teams that are in the bidding think they have a chance — and then when they get the best offer — go back to the team the player prefers and ask for its best and final offer. Boras has always counseled his star clients to wait until free agency to sign to maximize their value, and that strategy is poised to pay off handsomely for Soto, who turned down $440 million from the Nationals in 2022 before he was eventually traded to San Diego. His agency has almost always recommended players take the most money and years — for themselves and their families but also to grow the market for future free agents. While some have suggested Soto prefers to play on the East Coast, during free agency he’s indicated he’s open to the West Coast. Several in the industry familiar with Soto and his camp believe he will take the biggest offer, with the most money and years trumping geography. The best opportunity to win championships could be a deciding factor among those he’ll consider. With the belief that the top teams will be willing to commit the dollars it takes to land him, in the end Soto will choose exactly where he wants to play. Advertisement At the start of this offseason, I thought about one-third of the teams in the league would make a serious bid for Soto. Things can change in the coming weeks, but at this point, I believe there are only six or seven legitimate landing spots for the four-time All-Star: the Mets, Yankees, Dodgers, Phillies and Red Sox — who I view as the most likely destinations — followed by the Blue Jays and maybe a team that’s yet to emerge. All of those named teams should have the resources to make a deal, and all but the Blue Jays should be contending or within striking distance of perennial contenders over the next several years. Boras has a long history of surprising the baseball world with free agent landing spots, like when Max Scherzer signed with Washington, Iván Rodriguez signed with Detroit and Alex Rodriguez broke the bank with the Rangers. If an unexpected team emerges and decides to outbid the field, there’s a chance Soto will accept the offer. It’s just tough to see that scenario unfolding, especially because that team would need to beat out so many big-market behemoths. But in my four decades working in MLB front offices, I learned it only takes one wild-card owner to change the free-agent landscape, one owner who’s willing to shatter records to land a franchise player for their club. Another variable to consider in all of this: The Boras Corporation represents many of the top free agents — and they are intermingled and can affect each other. For example, Boras also reps first baseman Pete Alonso. Let’s say, for illustrative purposes, Soto has six teams in contention and all are willing to bid in the $600 million range, but Alonso has only two teams that will bid in the $150 million to $200 million range and only one of those teams is also in on Soto. Then it might be best for the Boras Corporation and both of its clients if Alonso signs the best offer he can get but it also pushes Soto to one of his other five teams if the money he’s being offered is the same. Ultimately, the player makes the decision that’s best for him, but free agents’ markets can be connected and affect who signs who. MLB’s Winter Meetings will be held next month at the Hilton Anatole in Dallas, the same hotel where Boras negotiated A-Rod’s record-breaking deal with the Rangers in 2000 and where Albert Pujols shocked the sport by signing with the Angels in 2011. It’s easy to imagine Soto with Boras at the podium in Dallas a few weeks from now, announcing his next team and another ground-breaking deal. But which team’s cap will be on his head? Which fan base will be ecstatic? When the dust settles weeks or even months from now in the race for the offseason’s most-prized free agent, who will win the Soto sweepstakes? Advertisement Soto said he was open to joining all 30 teams. Below, I’ve ranked the field of plausible contenders — including teams actively pursuing him, others monitoring his market, and still others that make sense as destinations and possibly could emerge — based on who is most likely to land him. (I left out roughly two-thirds of the league because those teams either aren’t engaged in Soto’s market or have no realistic chance of signing him.) Here’s how I see the state of the Soto sweepstakes as of today. GO DEEPER Matchmaking the top 10 MLB free agents with the team where they fit best The Mets are my favorites to sign Soto because I believe if their owner, Steve Cohen, wants him, he will make the highest bid — offering the most dollars and years — and if he does that and no other team matches it, I think he’s getting his man. Cohen was the highest bidder last offseason for Yoshinobu Yamamoto before the Dodgers matched the Mets’ bid, and his offer two years ago to Brandon Nimmo (eight years, $162 million) far exceeded any other the outfielder had received. The tandem of Judge and Soto brought back memories of Ruth and Gehrig and Mantle and Maris — and rightfully so. Soto seemed at home in the Bronx. He loved the fans and the fans loved him. I think if the Yankees have the best offer on the table, or match it, there is a strong chance he returns. If they don’t sign Soto, expect them to immediately pivot to some combination of Anthony Santander, Christian Walker, Willy Adames and Tanner Scott. GO DEEPER Yankees' Steinbrenner battles Mets' Cohen for Soto: 'I know what's expected of me' If I’m Soto, I’d sign with the Dodgers because they are positioned to build a dynasty. Can you imagine a lineup of Ohtani, Betts, Freeman and Soto for the next several years? My goodness. Beyond their overwhelming talent, the Dodgers have the resources and the culture that give Soto the best shot of winning in the short- and long-term. Phillies president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski has a track record of signing star players. It’s always been a key part of his formula and how he’s won wherever he’s gone. I believe he has one more future Hall of Famer on his mind: Soto. J.T. Realmuto and Kyle Schwarber’s combined $44 million comes off the Phillies’ books after 2025; Nick Castellanos’ $20 million per year comes off after 2026. There is a pathway to make a Soto deal work financially by backloading the first couple of years of a 12- to 15-year contract. And, Phillies ownership — with Dombrowski and before he arrived — has shown it will play in the deep end of free agency and dish out record deals. The Red Sox know they made a mistake when they decided not to go all-in to keep Mookie Betts, and they’ve learned from their missteps in recent years. They appear to be serious players for Soto. They have one of the best farm systems in the game and payroll flexibility going forward. Their meeting with Soto went well, as they sought to convince him that the special talent in their system will allow them to spend on free agents and trade acquisitions over the next several years. Soto was impressed with that aspect of their presentation, according to a league source briefed on the meeting. Advertisement The Blue Jays finished second in the Ohtani sweepstakes, and they have the resources to make the largest offer to Soto. They can sell him on representing a country — not just a city — but can they really convince him they’re positioned to win? The Giants have struggled over the years to land top position player free agents, but they were the highest bidder for Aaron Judge before the Yankees matched the offer and they were the highest bidder for Carlos Correa before nixing the deal over concerns about his medical records. Perhaps Buster Posey, their new president of baseball operations, might be able to convince Soto to sign with them — but this is a long shot, especially with a payroll reduction possibly on the horizon. There could not be a better script for Nationals president of baseball operations Mike Rizzo than to trade Soto to San Diego for a Herschel Walker-type prospect package and then two and a half years later, re-sign Soto. Astros owner Jim Crane has historically been opposed to long-term contracts as he allowed both Correa and George Springer to depart over the length of the deal. He did extend Jose Altuve and is working to do the same with Alex Bregman. However, I think it’s more likely he focuses on extending Kyle Tucker than landing Soto. If the late Peter Seidler hadn’t gotten ill, he might have completed a long-term contract to keep Soto in San Diego. However, that would assume Soto wasn’t focused on reaching free agency and he showed otherwise. It’s unlikely the Padres’ current ownership team would be willing to put another huge long-term contract on the books at this point, but I will never bet against A.J. Preller pulling off a surprise move.

Take a seat. The Davis family living room in their White Plains, N.Y., home is, in many ways, ordinary. Two well-worn, cream-colored sofas directly across from each other. A circular coffee table between them. Floor-to-ceiling bay windows, with decorative candles on the ledge. And the soundtrack to it all? Usually, barking, courtesy of the family Yorkshire terrier, Diggy. Advertisement “Any life decisions we make,” RJ Davis said, “yep, in that living room.” About five years ago, there was something else in that space, too: a poster board. On it, Davis, then a high school senior, had written the names of each of his four college finalists, the schools the four-star guard was considering attending. To make his choice, Davis used one of his mother Venessa’s favorite practices. “Pros and cons,” she said. “As a psychologist, it’s something you use a lot.” With Venessa and the rest of his family — father Rob, younger brother Bryce and, of course, Diggy — gathered in the living room, Davis worked through his options. When he’d finished writing, the decision was obvious: North Carolina. If he only knew then what the next four years would hold. An up-and-down freshman season that ended with Roy Williams’ shocking retirement. Then a slog of a sophomore year — until the Tar Heels turned into a rocket ship and manufactured one of the most miraculous Final Four runs in March Madness history. That led to hype entering Davis’ junior year, all of which promptly went up in flames as UNC became the first preseason No. 1 team in the modern era to miss the NCAA Tournament. And, finally, Davis’ senior season, when he sprouted into a full-blown star, posting one of the best individual campaigns in the baby blue blood’s storied history.

Another decision needed to be made: Would Davis — a first-team All-American last season and one of college basketball’s most recognizable figures — return to college for a fifth season, available because of the COVID-19 pandemic, or go pro? Advertisement Because Davis is only 6 feet, the feedback he received from the NBA Draft advisory committee suggested he’d go late in the second round or undrafted entirely. But coming off his best season, what more could he prove to scouts? “I’ve always had dreams and aspirations of playing at the next level, of playing in the NBA,” he said, “and it’s like, why not right now?” Davis settled into one of the sofas. Time to talk. The first weekend of April, Davis was exactly where he’d dreamed of being: Phoenix, the site of the Final Four. Just not for the reason he’d hoped. That’s because the past two seasons, Davis had a singular motivation: a redo. Ever since North Carolina magically stormed through the NCAA Tournament in Hubert Davis’ debut season, advancing all the way to the 2022 national title game, he wanted another crack at college hoops immortality. He was 20 minutes and a 15-point halftime lead versus Kansas away from hanging a seventh NCAA championship banner in the Dean Smith Center, and then, whoosh, everything evaporated. He’s one of five active players left from that team but the only one still wearing Carolina blue. Last season, Davis unequivocally became “the guy” for the first time in his college career, especially after his three-year backcourt mate, Caleb Love, transferred to Arizona. And he did everything in his power to will the Tar Heels back to that stage while rewriting UNC’s record books. Davis went from averaging 12 points and three assists per game during his first three seasons in Chapel Hill to setting career highs in points (21.2 per game), 3-point percentage (39.8), assist-to-turnover ratio (better than 2-1) and steals (1.2). But most importantly, he led UNC to its first ACC regular-season title and No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament since 2019. A redo, suddenly, seemed like a very realistic possibility. Advertisement Then came the Sweet 16. Red-hot Alabama. And Davis, for the first time all season, went cold. He’d made at least one 3-pointer in all 36 games to that point but went 0-for-9 from deep in a 2-point loss to the Crimson Tide. “Shots I normally make,” Davis said. “Had I made one 3 …” His voice trailed off. “I kind of felt like it was my fault, just because we were so close to reaching … everything.” A week later, Davis was there in the desert as a finalist for the Naismith College Player of the Year Award, presented annually at the Final Four. Even brushing elbows with the biggest names in the sport, being recognized for his on-court excellence, Davis couldn’t shake one underlying thought: I’d rather be playing. He couldn’t bring himself to turn on any of that weekend’s Final Four games. On one hand, Davis’ jam-packed trophy case spoke for itself, including ACC Player of the Year and the Jerry West Award (given annually to the nation’s top shooting guard). He etched himself into North Carolina lore, in the same stratosphere of excellence as some of the school’s best guards, names such as Phil Ford, Ty Lawson and, yes, even Michael Jordan. By virtue of his accomplishments, his jersey is going the same place theirs did: the Smith Center rafters. But at the same time, he couldn’t stop ruminating. On the loss to Alabama. The what-ifs. Every minute detail that added up to defeat. By the time he landed back in Chapel Hill, offseason roster-building was already in full swing. Hubert Davis was holding end-of-season meetings with all his players. And Davis knew what his head coach was going to ask, whenever they sat down: So, RJ, what are you going to do? Tyler Hansbrough doesn’t play much basketball these days. “My knees,” the now-39-year-old joked. “If I’m on the court, my knees are gonna have some issues.” But Hansbrough still works out regularly, even sneaking over to the Smith Center for a lift when he can. One day in April, he was finishing a session when a familiar face approached. Advertisement “Rarely do I try to give anybody advice,” Hansbrough said, “but he actually asked me.” It makes sense why Davis sought Hansbrough out. The star guard spoke to plenty of people in his circle about what he should do: Armando Bacot, his four-year teammate and close friend; Cam Johnson, arguably UNC’s top active NBA player; Theo Pinson, who won the program’s last championship in 2017; and even Marcus Paige, now on North Carolina’s coaching staff. But nobody could offer the perspective Hansbrough could. That’s because about 15 years ago, Hansbrough was in the same bind. After his standout junior season, when the 6-foot-9 forward was the unanimous national player of the year, averaging a career-best 22.6 points and 10.2 rebounds, he, too, had a pro decision to make. Had he declared, based on feedback that then-coach Williams had gathered, Hansbrough learned he likely would’ve been a late lottery pick. But like Davis, he couldn’t get his mind off a recent NCAA Tournament heartbreak. UNC had just lost to Kansas in the 2008 Final Four, only its third defeat all season, and Hansbrough hadn’t been at his best. “Everyone thinks that whenever you get a chance to go to the NBA, you have to go. But if you believe in yourself and you think you can be a pro, one more year in college, that’s not going to derail your pro chances,” Hansbrough said. “One more year wasn’t going to change anything for me, and I felt like I could improve.” And? “And we had a chance to win a national championship.” The rest is history. Hansbrough came back, and his decision was validated when UNC did win the national title his senior season. Hansbrough was right about his pro prospects, too; the Indiana Pacers selected him 13th in the 2009 NBA Draft, the same late-lottery range that was forecast for him a year prior. Advertisement The other consideration Hansbrough mentioned to Davis? Name, image and likeness, which didn’t exist in his heyday. Davis knew NIL wouldn’t be the primary factor in his decision — “If money wasn’t involved, I’d still be playing basketball,” he said. But by virtue of his record-setting senior season, he’d earned a bevy of endorsement deals: Crocs, Verizon and one of his favorites, JBL. (Although it probably wasn’t his neighbors’ favorite; Davis’ JBL speaker may or may not have earned him a noise complaint at his apartment complex. “There’s a bass boost, so I always press that,” Davis said with a wry smile, “and the next thing you know, it’s boom.”) Hansbrough explained his thought process to Davis in UNC’s weight room and left him with one final thought. “You can listen to all the most important people in your life,” Hansbrough said, “and you can take their advice — which you should value — but you’re the only one that has to live your life.” Not long after his talk with Hansbrough, Davis returned to White Plains. “I like to go home and get grounded,” he said, “because that’s where I feel safe, and that’s where my heart lives.” Still unsure of what he’d do, the guard continued training. Most days, he met with his skills trainer, Ross Burns, at the local Life Time Fitness, and he regularly drove to Connecticut to meet with a strength and conditioning specialist. And between those sessions, it wasn’t uncommon for Davis to swing by his old high school, Archbishop Stepinac, for an early morning or late-night shooting session. “My good companions here in the building are our maintenance guys,” said Patrick Massaroni, Davis’ high school coach at Stepinac. “We make it work.” Other schools poked around Davis, his parents said, seeing if he’d consider entering the transfer portal, but UNC and the NBA were the only options he considered. Whenever he thought he’d made up his mind, that lingering memory of not winning a championship reared its head. “My mind,” he said, “was changing every day.” GO DEEPER Men’s college basketball preseason All-Americans: Sears, Flagg, Davis lead the way With the May 1 deadline for Davis to decide rapidly approaching, he had to stop waffling. So, back to the living room for final deliberations. Bryce — now a freshman at Albany — wasn’t in town, so Davis FaceTimed his younger brother and put the phone in his lap. Rob and Venessa sat across from him on the opposite sofa. Diggy scurried across the hardwood floor. Advertisement Rob and Venessa reiterated what Hansbrough said: It’s your life, and you have to live with your choice. With his mind racing, Davis stepped outside to gather his thoughts. He sat down on the family’s front porch steps and made a phone call. To Williams, the coach who recruited him to UNC in the first place. He walked around the block on the phone, and then came back to the family living room. “Whatever they talked about, he didn’t share,” Venessa said, “but it seemed to settle him, for sure.” Davis didn’t make up his mind right then, but a few days later, Davis came downstairs from his bedroom and announced he’d made his decision. Davis kept his decision close to the vest. He told his parents, obviously. Hubert Davis. But he didn’t even text his teammates. “I wanted,” he said, flashing a toothy grin, “to keep people on their toes a little bit.” So on the night of April 30, Davis set a timer on his phone for 3 a.m. and went to sleep. When the alarm went off, he woke up and posted a highlight video to Instagram with a simple two-word caption: “I’m back.” And then … Davis put his phone on “Do Not Disturb” and went back to bed. The ultimate mic drop, letting the college basketball world stir while he slept.     A post shared by RJ Davis🥷🏼 (@ariidavis_)  “It wasn’t like I was saying no to my dreams (of playing in the NBA); it’s more so, I’m putting them on pause,” Davis said. “Besides the year I had this past year, there was no greater feeling than playing in that Final Four and playing in that national championship my sophomore year. I just remember watching the ball go up, and the buzzer sound hit, and we were on the losing side. … I want to be on that winning side.” His decision finally behind him, Davis drilled down on his shooting the rest of the summer, motivated by that 0-for-9 showing against Alabama. How much of his training was done through an NBA lens, knowing he’ll likely have to play point guard because of his size? Not much. Advertisement “That’s where guys get in trouble: They start listening to critics or scouts and start thinking they’ve got to change something,” Burns said. “No. Really, just keep being the dominant, elite shooter and scorer you are — and because you’re going to have more eyeballs on you, be a facilitator.” So far, so good on that front: Through three games, Davis has 14 assists against just three turnovers. No. 10 UNC plays Hawaii on Friday and begins play Monday in the Maui Invitational. There is so much still on the table for Davis this season, but three things stand above the rest. A December rematch with Alabama as part of the ACC-SEC Challenge. The chance for Davis, if he scores the same number of points he did last season, to tie Hansbrough atop UNC’s, and the ACC’s, all-time scoring list (albeit with an extra season). “That’s hard to put into perspective,” he said. “Once I graduate and officially leave, then it’ll hit me. Like, wow, I really accomplished a lot of great things here.” And finally? Hang a banner. Complete the redo. “I’m just going to fulfill this moment,” Davis said, “and make the best of it.” (Top photo of Elon’s Nick Dorn and UNC’s RJ Davis: Grant Halverson / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,The Sudden Fall of the N.F.L.’s Best Kicker,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5933377/2024/11/20/ravens-justin-tucker-kicker-concerns/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 22:17:59 +0000","Justin Tucker has been the gold standard at his position for years. Now he’s one of the reasons Baltimore is losing games, a columnist for The Athletic writes.","NFL Citing a lack of consistency in the kicking game, Baltimore Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome announced that the team was releasing young kicker Stephen Hauschka, who hours earlier missed a 36-yard attempt against the Cleveland Browns on “Monday Night Football.” Hauschka was just 9-of-13 on field goal attempts through nine games, and all of his misses were from under 50 yards. The Ravens replaced him by signing free agent Billy Cundiff, who was working at a venture capital firm at the time. Advertisement That transaction occurred in November 2009. That’s the last time the Ravens made an in-season, performance-based change at typically one of the most volatile positions in the sport. Ravens coach John Harbaugh made clear Monday that he has no plans on making another one, even as his longtime kicker, Justin Tucker, is mired in the most difficult stretch of his 13-year career. “There’s no thought to that,” Harbaugh said. “You have to find that competition first if you’re going to be blunt about it. Where is that competition? That would be one thing. The best option right now is to get Justin back on point, because he’s fully capable of doing it. (We) certainly haven’t lost any confidence in Justin Tucker.” Harbaugh’s comments came a day after Tucker missed two kicks in an 18-16 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers at Acrisure Stadium. After entering the season as the most statistically accurate kicker in NFL history, Tucker has missed 6 of 22 attempts this year, along with a point-after try. Two of the misses came from inside 50 yards, where Tucker had made 90 percent of his kicks over his first 12 NFL seasons. His extra-point miss was just the seventh of his career. GO DEEPER 'They’ve had our number': Ravens again unable to overcome themselves in loss to Steelers “It’s certainly frustrating, especially when we know that these games come down to the wire, like this one did, that I let a couple get away,” Tucker said after Sunday’s game. “But, like I’ve said before, the only thing that we can do is just get right back to work and focus on making the most out of our next opportunity.” Considered one of the most unique weapons in the league for over a decade and the Ravens’ most reliable performer since he entered the league in 2012, Tucker — and by extension, the team’s field goal operation — has suddenly become one of the reasons Baltimore is losing games. It’s harsh and it feels uncomfortable to say or write about a guy who has been the gold standard in the sport at his position for many years, but the numbers are hard to ignore. The Ravens’ four losses have come by a total of 17 points, and Tucker missed a field goal in each of them that factored prominently in the defeats. Advertisement Tucker “needs to make kicks,” Harbaugh said after Sunday’s frustrating loss in Pittsburgh. “He knows that. He makes them in practice, and he made the long one (54-yarder) later, which was good to see. He’s still very capable. Kick them straight, we’ll be good.” Missing seven total kicks through 11 games would get plenty of other kickers a pink slip. That’s just the nature of the position in the NFL and the fine line between winning and losing. Kicking issues are omnipresent around the league, and Tucker is hardly alone among proven veterans having a tough time this season. The New York Jets have had four different kickers in as many weeks. GO DEEPER Normally 'automatic' kickers like Justin Tucker, Younghoe Koo are struggling in 2024 For the Ravens, however, kicking stability has been a constant. Matt Stover, nicknamed “Money Matt” for his accuracy, was the team’s kicker from 1996 to 2008. Cundiff replaced Hauschka in 2009 and was the team’s kicker for three seasons before his crushing late miss in the AFC Championship Game loss to the New England Patriots in January 2012. Tucker arrived on the scene as an undrafted free agent several months later, beat out Cundiff for the job and hasn’t missed a game in 13 seasons. Just the idea of making a kicking change in Baltimore seems blasphemous, given Tucker’s well-earned status. Before the two misses in Pittsburgh on Sunday, Tucker’s career field goal percentage (89.7) made him the most accurate kicker in NFL history and put him on a Hall of Fame track. His clutch kicking as a rookie in 2012 was instrumental in the Ravens winning their last Super Bowl. He’s been selected to seven Pro Bowl teams and named an All-Pro on eight occasions. Time and time again when the Ravens needed points, particularly late in games, Tucker stepped up, performed his tried-and-true pre-kick ritual and calmly delivered. He’s previously been the highest-paid kicker in the sport, and for good reason. Advertisement Tucker’s kicking brilliance, along with his charisma, outgoing personality and multitude of talents, made him one of the faces of the team and one of the most popular and recognizable athletes in Baltimore. Tucker’s No. 9 jerseys are not hard to find when you’re scanning the seating bowl at Ravens games. But this season has brought long-avoided angst in Baltimore about the performance of the kicker and led to a small but growing segment of Baltimore’s fan base to question why the organization hasn’t moved on, or at least brought in competition, for its longtime star. “Knowing the team, knowing the character of Justin, yes, his performance in the past does warrant him the benefit of the doubt, for sure,” Stover said. “But this is the NFL. It is a very immediate performance you have to have. With an objective job like being a kicker, it becomes a quick response for people to say, ‘Hey, man, what’s wrong with you? Do we need to make a change?'” Yet, Stover said, “He’s one of the best who has ever done it. Who are you going to get who you can guarantee will be better?” Bringing in another kicker in mid-November likely means either signing a well-traveled veteran who hasn’t been able to land another job or plucking someone off another team’s practice squad. It’s inconceivable at the moment that the Ravens would trust one of those options more than Tucker at a time when they fancy themselves as Super Bowl contenders. “He’s definitely our best option, and he’s going to make a lot of kicks — I really believe that,” Harbaugh said. “But it’s up to him and the guys he works with every day to make those balls go straight. Competition right now, at this time, no that’s not something we’d want for Justin.” Stover, who is in the Ravens’ Ring of Honor, still lives in the Baltimore area and has relationships with many people in the building, including Tucker. He also understands what Tucker is going through. There were times early in his career with Cleveland when he struggled and the Browns brought in competition for his job. In 1999, the Ravens claimed kicker Joe Nedney on waivers while Stover remained on the roster. Advertisement “That was brutal. He wasn’t on the practice squad. He wasn’t on IR. He was on the roster,” Stover said. “It really just comes down to performance. There’s no subjectivity. I got through it. “Justin is going through a little blip. He’s mentally strong. He’s got a great support staff around him. He’s got a head coach who totally gets it. To do it for 12 years as well as he’s done it says a lot about who he is and his character. It’s the first time he’s ever had to deal with this. I dealt with it three or four times. It was hard and it sucks. He’ll get through it.” Stover, who trains young kickers, acknowledged that he hasn’t broken down Tucker’s mechanics, but he maintains the fact that Tucker has missed all seven kicks wide left is a “good thing,” because that often points to a fixable issue. It doesn’t appear to be a leg strength issue with Tucker. Almost all of his kicks, except one, have had the necessary distance. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

There has been plenty of speculation about whether his issues are being caused by snapping and/or holding problems, but Tucker and others at the Ravens’ facility have continued to say snapper Nick Moore and holder Jordan Stout, who aren’t new at this or to the team, are doing their jobs. After Sunday’s misses, Tucker retreated to the locker room to address reporters and insisted his struggles are not a confidence issue, either. “I’m still confident I’m going to go out there and nail every single kick,” Tucker said. “Part of the way we stay confident is by continuing to work and trust the process, and I know I might sound like a broken record, but it’s a part of what brings us success — just trusting the process and then taking it one kick at a time.” Harbaugh, a former special teams coach, has a very close relationship with the kicker. Senior special teams coach Randy Brown has been with Tucker every step of his career and is considered one of the top kicking gurus in the league. Ravens assistant special teams coach Sam Koch is a former holder for Tucker and one of his closest confidants. Advertisement Stout has been holding for Tucker for three seasons, and Moore has been in the Ravens organization since 2020. The kicking battery and coaching staff have an established routine that has yielded very strong results for many years. “You try to attack everything to the utmost that we can, across the board,” Harbaugh said. “Justin is one of the aspects that we’re looking at. He’s going to get it figured out. We have coaches. We have technique. We look at the tape. He’s practicing well. He’s got to kick it straight.” (Top photo: Barry Reeger / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Ohtani authored one of the finest individual performances in baseball history, slugging 54 home runs and swiping 59 bases to become the first-ever member of baseball’s 50-50 club while hitting .310 with a National League-leading 1.036 OPS. Despite exclusively appearing as a designated hitter and not playing the field, the 30-year-old won out against New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor, who had an .844 OPS while hitting 33 home runs and stealing 29 bases. Ohtani outproduced him by both Baseball-Reference (9.2 to 7.0) and FanGraphs’ (9.1 to 7.8) formulas for wins above replacement. Arizona Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte was as an MVP finalist for the first time, with 36 home runs and a .932 OPS in 136 games. Advertisement Ohtani earned all 30 first-place votes from the Baseball Writers’ Association of America on his way to 420 points. Lindor finished second with 23 second-place votes and 263 points, while Marte finished third with five second-place votes and 229 points. “I’m very happy obviously to win the award,” Ohtani said through interpreter Matt Hidaka. “My goal was to be able to pitch and contribute offensively. The fact that I knew I wasn’t going to be able to pitch this season just made me focus more on my offensive game. Fortunately I was able to produce and get this award, which is very humbling.” Ohtani’s first season as a Dodger was full of upheaval. He had to endure a recovery from a second elbow ligament reconstruction, which limited him only to hitting. A flood of life circumstances — from joining his new club on a record contract to his marriage to the theft of tens of millions of dollars by his longtime interpreter — colored a year still defined by his brilliance. Things ended, fittingly, with what Ohtani sought most when deferring so much of that record contract to allow his new team to build around him: a World Series title. “He committed to us, and he wanted to play for a championship,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said in the celebration. “For it to kind of come to fruition in his first year is pretty remarkable. “What Shohei’s done to our ballclub, the Dodger fan base domestically, globally, I just don’t think you can quantify.” The Dodgers have already centered the next decade around Ohtani, from global business partnerships to how they will add stars to their already talent-laden roster. It took one year for the fruits of that vision to come to pass. Dodger Stadium was flooded with jerseys wearing Ohtani’s name. A club whittled down by injuries still managed to romp through October. Advertisement “It was definitely special as you said because we were able to win the World Series,” Ohtani said. “It will be a special moment that I will never forget just to be able to win MVP as an individual as well. But I take it as a team effort and this will motivate me even more to win again next year. We hope to win the World Series each year. “Moving forward, I do think we will have a target on our back and we will be expected to possibly do even more. But we are as a team going to continue to do the best we can and try to achieve those goals.” Thursday cemented more rare history. No player not named Ohtani had ever won a unanimous MVP so much as twice. He and Barry Bonds are the only MVPs to ever win the award, switch teams and then win it again in their first season with a new club. GO DEEPER The best Shohei Ohtani cards to collect after his historic 50/50 season He and his former Los Angeles Angels teammate, Mike Trout, are the only active players to have won the award at least three times, with only Bryce Harper and Aaron Judge joining them among active players to win the award more than once. For Ohtani, however, this one resonates for a different reason. He swapped out Angels red for Dodgers blue. And while it was his two-way excellence in the batter’s box and on the mound (and the novelty that brought) that led him to his first two MVPs and nearly won him a third while with the Angels, this year’s achievement came in a season where he didn’t throw a single pitch. His quest for a fourth already has its prologue: Ohtani is expected to return to the mound at some point in 2025, but he will do so while recovering from shoulder surgery to repair his left (non-throwing) labrum that he tore while attempting to steal a base against the New York Yankees in the World Series. Ohtani said Thursday that he has had his stitches removed and been cleared to start core and lower-body exercises. While he said it is his “goal” to return as both a hitter and pitcher for Opening Day, he said he and the Dodgers will exercise caution. Advertisement “The goal is to be ready for Opening Day,” Ohtani said. “That includes hitting and pitching. We are kind of taking our time. Obviously we want to make sure that I’m healthy first. We’re not going to rush anything. I think, discussing my shoulder, I think we are going to take a little bit more time and be conservative and we’re going to make sure I’m healthy before I step back on the mound.” (Top photo: Elsa / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Alex Ovechkin out 4 to 6 weeks with fractured fibula: What it means for Capitals, goal record chase",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938983/2024/11/21/alex-ovechkin-injury-update-washington-capitals/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 23:57:34 GMT","Ovechkin, who is in pursuit of the NHL's all-time goals record, has 15 goals and 10 assists in 18 games played so far this season.","NHL Alex Ovechkin will be missing foreseeable time from the ice. The Washington Capitals star captain underwent further evaluation Thursday and was diagnosed with a left fibula fracture, the team announced. Ovechkin is expected to miss four to six weeks. Ovechkin, 39, was initially ruled week to week with a lower-body injury Tuesday following an accidental, knee-on-knee collision with Utah Hockey Club forward Jack McBain during Monday’s 6-2 victory. Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin underwent further evaluation with team doctors. It was confirmed that Ovechkin has a fracture to his left fibula and is anticipated to miss 4-6 weeks. — CapitalsPR (@CapitalsPR) November 21, 2024  Ovechkin, who is in pursuit of the NHL’s all-time goals record, has 15 goals and 10 assists in 18 games played so far this season. He sits at 868 career goals, just 27 shy of passing Wayne Gretzky’s record. That he will probably have to wait until next season to break Gretzky’s goal record. There aren’t many examples of athletes pushing 40 recovering smoothly from a lower-body injury as significant as a broken fibula. He’s no average athlete, but he is human — and he’ll need time to knock off rust, at the very least, and also work his way into game-level fitness upon returning from this injury. Advertisement With Ovechkin, the legs feed the wolf so to speak. He’s a brute force of a goal scorer, powering shots with his lower body. He’s appeared to be skating like a player at least five years younger this season — does that change when he returns from a broken bone? There’s no way to answer that question now. Still, even if he returns by early 2025, he’ll likely need a hot streak to pass Gretzky this season. His chance of the goal record was destined to become the story of the second half of this season — one that perhaps could generate interest the NHL has not seen, at least in the United States, in many years. He’s too close to the record not to get it eventually. But it looked like he might knock it off on his way to an improbable 50-goal season, if not a run at a fourth Hart Trophy. This was shaping up as a legacy-defining season for an all-time icon behind whom the NHL could potentially break into the mainstream sports conversation. All of that may be off the table because of this injury. — Rob Rossi, NHL senior writer The Capitals surprised many people by making the playoffs last season — and they did so largely in part to Ovechkin finding his scoring groove in the second half. Their emergence this season as a seeming dark horse Cup contender coincided with Ovechkin’s scoring surge. It was as if an improved roster was also being fueled by its captain’s finishing form. There’s no way to overstate how big a blow losing Ovechkin is to the Capitals, though. Even when he’s not scoring, if he’s on the ice, he’s a threat who draws opponents’ top defensive pairings and often best defensive forwards. And on the power play, where he’s arguably the most dangerous weapon the NHL has known, Ovechkin is irreplaceable. The Capitals are more than just Ovechkin, but not having him for at least a month — and it’s totally unknown how he’ll look when he does return — is as significant an obstacle as any team has faced this season. — Rossi (Photo: Patrick Smith / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Michigan flips QB Bryce Underwood — No. 1 player in 2025 class — from LSU,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5939109/2024/11/21/bryce-underwood-michigan-lsu-recruiting/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 23:32:35 GMT",Underwood will be the highest-rated quarterback to sign with Michigan in the modern recruiting era.,"NCAAF Bryce Underwood, a five-star quarterback from Belleville, Mich., and the No. 1 prospect in the 247Sports Composite, has flipped his commitment from LSU to Michigan. Underwood immediately becomes a face-of-the-program recruit for Michigan, which is 5-5 in Sherrone Moore’s first season. As the No. 1 quarterback in his class, Underwood is expected to command an NIL deal worth at least $5 million, according to On3. Michigan made a concerted push to flip his commitment in recent weeks, signaling a shift in the program’s NIL philosophy under Moore. Advertisement Landing Underwood is by far the biggest coup of the class and one of Michigan’s biggest recruiting wins in years. Underwood will be the highest-rated quarterback to sign with Michigan in the modern recruiting era (dating back to 2002) and the second player ranked No. 1 in his class to do so, joining Rashan Gary from the Class of 2016.     A post shared by Bryce Underwood (@19bryce.__)  Jim Harbaugh’s reluctance to engage in bidding wars for recruits was one reason Michigan was perceived as a long shot in Underwood’s recruitment. Michigan wasn’t viewed as a serious player in the Underwood sweepstakes when he committed to LSU in January, and Belleville coach Calvin Norman told The Athletic in June that there would be no last-minute change of heart from Underwood. “That’s not gonna happen,” Norman said. Michigan ramped up its pursuit of Underwood in recent weeks, backed by a significant allocation of NIL resources. While the Wolverines have experienced a downturn on the field after last season’s national championship run, their 2025 recruiting class now sits at No. 9 in the composite rankings. “I think they understand the vision that we explain to them and what this is going to be like,” Moore said of players considering Michigan. “It’s been pretty positive. We’ve gotten some good commitments, some good guys to join the family, and we’re looking to continue that trend.” The state of Michigan has produced a string of elite quarterback prospects in recent years, including Notre Dame’s CJ Carr and Dante Moore, now at Oregon. After missing out on Carr and Moore, the Wolverines have staked a big part of their future on Underwood, a 6-foot-4 prodigy with the tools to be a future franchise quarterback in the NFL. “He’s a more modernized Randall Cunningham mixed with Josh Allen,” Donovan Dooley, Underwood’s QB coach, told The Athletic in 2023. “He’s a unicorn.” Advertisement J.J. McCarthy’s departure for the NFL left a hole at quarterback that became glaring during Moore’s first season. Michigan had a commitment from four-star quarterback Carter Smith for 2025, but Smith decommitted after Michigan went all in with Underwood. Given the struggles of Davis Warren and Alex Orji this season, Underwood will be a candidate to start immediately in 2025, though he could have competition from redshirt freshman Jadyn Davis and any quarterback Michigan elects to pursue in the transfer portal. The Tigers may be in trouble. Underwood had been committed to LSU since January, and it’s typical for college programs to shut down quarterback recruiting once they have their guy in place. LSU now has no quarterback committed in its class with less than two weeks until the start of the early signing period. Additionally, Brian Kelly and his staff are now at risk of losing other top prospects. It was no secret that the Tigers had built their class around Underwood, and it wouldn’t be surprising if some of the other skill players jumped ship. On3 has already projected that four-star wide receiver Derek Meadows, who plays at Las Vegas Bishop Gorman, will follow suit and flip from LSU to Michigan. Kelly, whose team is just 6-4 this season, may now have to turn to the portal to fill some of these holes.

Judge earned his second American League MVP award, this one unanimously, on Thursday night, claiming it after posting an astounding 218 wRC+, the highest ever recorded by a right-handed hitter in either league. Judge received all 30 first-place votes from the Baseball Writers’ Association of America to finish with 420 points, well ahead of second-place Kansas City Royals shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. (270 points). Judge’s teammate Juan Soto (229 points) finished third. Advertisement Judge, who also won the honor when he hit an AL-record 62 home runs in 2022, no-showed a scheduled conference call with members of the BBWAA after the award announcement. He appeared on MLB Network and ESPN. Judge became the seventh player in Yankees history to win multiple MVPs, joining Alex Rodriguez, Mickey Mantle (three times), Roger Maris, Yogi Berra (three times), Joe DiMaggio (three times) and Lou Gehrig. “It’s funny. I was talking to (Bryce) Harper a lot this season, and I was telling him, ‘I’m going to try to catch up to you with these MVPs here, man,’” Judge said on MLB Network, referring to Harper’s two MVP awards. “But he’s saying hopefully he could stay a few ahead of me, which I think he’ll do, man. It means a lot. A lot of the hard work in the offseason, during the season, the ups and downs throughout it. The constant support from my teammates, the fans in New York, just everybody to help me get to this spot.” Judge finished the 2024 season with a majors-leading 58 home runs and 144 RBIs, and a slash line of .322/.458/.701. His 11.2 fWAR ranked as the 10th-best single-season performance in franchise history and the 19th-best of all time. The 6-foot-7 center fielder was so dominant that his .701 slugging percentage was higher than the OPS of 11 teams. “It’s greatness right in front of us,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said in September while describing Judge. GO DEEPER The best Aaron Judge trading cards to collect Boston Red Sox manager Alex Cora in September called Judge’s performance “the best version” of his nine-year career. Judge led MLB in home runs, RBIs, walk rate, ISO, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, wOBA, wRC+, and fWAR. The campaign was statistically better overall than his 2022. He did it while hitting behind Soto, who put up a career year with 41 home runs and is poised to land one of the biggest contracts in free-agent history this winter. Advertisement Asked on MLB Network if it mattered to him that he won MVP unanimously, Judge said, “No, not really. I appreciate all the votes, all the support. If you win it, you win it. But, honestly, I wouldn’t be in this position without my teammates, all the coaching we had this year. It’s such a blessing. I’ve got to thank God every day for this opportunity to be here, to wear pinstripes and to do it in New York.” Judge also led MLB in Statcast’s run value metric against four-seam fastballs, sinkers and sweepers. Despite facing the highest volume of sweepers among all hitters, he slugged an incredible .816 against the pitch. Over the past two seasons, pitchers have frequently attacked Judge with sliders, hoping he would chase pitches off the plate. In 2024, Judge also faced the most sliders of his career. He responded with a remarkable .984 OPS against all types of sliders. Judge is a perfectionist, constantly seeking ways to refine even the smallest aspects of his game as evidenced by the tweaks he made to his swing this season. Topping his 2024 output will be no easy feat, but if he does, another MVP trophy could bear his name.  (Photo: Jason Miller / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

(via @awnaveed11) pic.twitter.com/1SxBGVbNJq — USMNT Only (@usmntonly) November 19, 2024  The ‘Trump Dance’ has become a viral trend after being widely used by Trump himself on the presidential election campaign trail. That has now spread to sports, with National Football League player Nick Bosa celebrating a sack using the dance, and most recently combat sports fighter Jon Jones performing it after knocking out his opponent, in front of a watching Trump. But Howard, widely-considered among the greatest players in the history of American men’s soccer, criticised Pulisic, calling into question his awareness surrounding the political climate in the United States following the U.S. election, where Trump earned a second term by roundly defeating Democratic challenger and current Vice President Kamala Harris. “Doing a dance that mimics (U.S. president-elect) Donald Trump is stupid,” Howard wrote in the UK’s Daily Mail. “Why? Because, whether it’s the president of the United States or my neighbor down the street, I would never back someone who I believe is racist. I wouldn’t glorify that. I wouldn’t do it for anything.” Referring to Pulisic’s insistence that the dance was not a “political” act, Howard said: “That explanation doesn’t wash. You cannot have it both ways. You’re on one side of this or the other. If you are bold enough to publicly make a statement, I don’t have a problem with that. But own it.” Advertisement Howard also attacked the U.S. Soccer Federation, suggesting that it needed to do a better job of educating its players on the ramifications of their actions. The former Everton keeper also stated that he felt some athletes were ignoring problematic policies and political leanings in order to maximize their earnings. “Athletes know they can protect their assets by supporting a certain political party,” wrote Howard. “I have a lot of friends who are very wealthy and they sold their soul to protect their money. “Support whoever you want, for whatever reason you like. But my message to Pulisic, Bosa, Jones and Co? Own it.” U.S. Soccer declined to comment on Howard’s remarks. President-elect Trump’s office has been approached for comment.

Forest head coach Nuno Espirito Santo said the midfielder is still struggling with the foot injury he sustained against Crystal Palace last month. Anderson, 22, started the subsequent game against Leicester City and came off the bench in the last two Forest fixtures, against West Ham United and Newcastle United. Advertisement “We took advantage of the international break to try to manage some players who were struggling, and Elliot was one of them. Let’s see how he is tomorrow. But for now, we still have to assess him,” said Nuno at his pre-match press conference earlier on Thursday. The Portuguese coach said that, otherwise, Forest’s international players had all — with the exception of Paraguay international Ramon Sosa, who was yet to fly back to England — arrived back in Nottingham without injury issues. But both Murillo and Chris Wood will be given more rest ahead of the weekend, having travelled half way around the world to join up with Brazil and New Zealand. Murillo did not get any game time as Brazil drew 1-1 both in Venezuela and at home to Uruguay. But Wood scored twice in an 8-1 win over Vanuatu and a hat-trick as New Zealand won in Samoa. Nuno says the training levels of all the international players — and particularly Murillo and Wood — will be monitored to ensure they get as much rest as possible ahead of the weekend. “We will give them more time to rest. This is what we believe is better. We will not immediately try to prepare them. We will have players with jetlag and we have to manage that. Our approach is always that doing less is more,” said Nuno. (Mike Egerton/PA Images via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,3 reasons why Miami Heat's defense has improved since a slow start,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5937692/2024/11/21/heat-defense-video-bam-adebayo/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 22:01:24 GMT",How has Miami's defense improved in recent games? Here's a look at some film.,"NBA An up-and-down start to the Miami Heat’s season is balancing out as the team restores its defensive identity. At 6-7, Miami sits one game under .500 and entered Thursday ranked fifth in the East. The Heat don’t play again until the Dallas Mavericks visit on Sunday. Considering the rightful frustrations behind a few late-game miscues and blown leads, things could be worse — and they’ve already started improving. Advertisement On the surface, Miami’s 11th-ranked defense seems standard, but it had a rough start to the season as head coach Erik Spoelstra assessed his ideal lineups. After losing 135-122 to the Denver Nuggets on Nov. 8, the Heat ranked only 20th in points allowed per 100 possessions while allowing opponents to corral more than half of the available rebound opportunities. That doesn’t compute for a Spo-coached squad, so it’s only right Miami has since returned to the drawing board and reassessed a few things. Let’s examine the most vital differences in Miami’s defense since Nov. 10. Since that Denver loss, Haywood Highsmith has been a fixture in the Heat starting lineup. Miami has three wins in that span, during which the 27-year-old has averaged nearly eight points while shooting 51.9 percent overall and 50 percent from deep. But since we’re discussing defense, let’s discuss the buckets he limits. He’s averaging a team-high 1.8 steals and 5.4 deflections per game, trailing only Atlanta’s Dyson Daniels (6.0) for the NBA lead in that span. Highsmith often is tasked with guarding an opponent’s best scorer, which allows Bam Adebayo and Jimmy Butler to be more defensively versatile. Opponents are shooting only 43.8 percent on nearly 13 shot attempts when guarded by Highsmith, according to NBA.com’s tracking data. Highsmith played a vital role in the Heat holding Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards to a season-worst 8-of-24 shooting (including a 4-of-14 mark from deep) on Nov. 10. Highsmith gave Minnesota’s leading man nothing but bad options whenever they matched up, using hard closeouts or active hands in helping teammates. In Miami’s last five games, its opponents are shooting far better when Haywood is on the bench (50.6 percent) than when he’s playing (43.6 percent), per NBA.com. “It’s fun for sure,” Highsmith said. “I like to guard guys and make it hard for them to score. These are superstar, All-Star-type players, so it says a lot about Spo trusting in me to put me on those guys. And I’m all about defense, so I accept the challenge. There’s no better feeling for me than just getting a stop.” Advertisement Few things speak more to Miami’s identity than a bench contributor’s willingness to step in at a moment’s notice. Players of this ilk, like Dru Smith, Alec Burks and Kevin Love, have been key to the Heat enjoying three wins in the last five games. Smith has played only 52 minutes this season, but he’s held opponents to just 32 percent shooting in his appearances. Against the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday, Burks held Philly scorers to 2-of-7 shooting after not playing since Nov. 6. The 76ers scored just 48.6 points per 100 possessions in the pair’s 17 minutes together, and that can give Spoelstra more perimeter options to keep sharpening Miami’s defense. Smith, in particular, is adept at being active on defense without fouling. He registered two steals in about a minute on Monday, both leading to transition opportunities for Tyler Herro. On the season, Miami ranks fourth among all teams with 18.7 deflections per game and ninth in fast-break points (17.1). Since Nov. 10, only the Houston Rockets (22.3) have averaged more of the latter than the Heat (21.0). Love, meanwhile, has helped Miami improve its rebounding since becoming a rotation fixture in recent games. The 36-year-old trails only Adebayo for the team lead in rebounds since Nov. 10. He’s played alongside Adebayo for 47 minutes in that span, during which the Heat have outscored teams by 4.2 points per 100 possessions. Love’s size helps further bolster Miami’s frontcourt and gives the Heat a sound anchor whenever Adebayo isn’t on the court. In the clip below against the Indiana Pacers, Love was caught on an island when guarding a pick-and-roll, but his footwork and body control allowed him to contest T.J. McConnell’s drive without fouling. Not to doubt Spoelstra, but there is no way for the Heat to craft a credible defense without its team captain as a consistent anchor. During this turnaround, Adebayo has refused to allow Miami’s defense to bottom out after its slow start. In the team’s last five games, the five-time All-Defense selection has played 193 out of a possible 245 minutes. The team’s defensive efficiency falls off a cliff when he’s sat (122.1 points allowed per 100 possessions, would undoubtedly rank last over a season) compared to his time on the court (101.3, would rank first), because Adebayo often provides good things to Miami. In this example below, as Highsmith guarded Joel Embiid on the perimeter, Adebayo blitzed with defensive help to force a bad pass that Butler finished with a takeaway. Adebayo’s comfort with playing away from the rim provides the Heat with many ways to confuse opponents. Fortunately for the Heat, their defensive anchor also can spoil offenses’ fun when left on an island, thanks to his timing, quick feet and active hands. Adebayo finished this win over the Pacers with a season-high five steals, one shy of his career high. Later in the game, Adebayo gave Pacers forward Obi Toppin fits as Toppin tried to wiggle for a basket. Adebayo closed out on Toppin’s 3-point attempt before backtracking to impede a lob attempt in the clip below. Over the last five games, Adebayo is holding opposing scorers to 37.9 percent shooting. He’s the center of Miami’s defensive resurgence in recent games — and will need to continue to be. If the Heat have any ambition of climbing the Eastern Conference standings as the season progresses, it will begin on defense.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Flyers stock watch: Who’s trending up, who’s trending down after 20 games?",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938288/2024/11/21/flyers-stock-watch-players-analysis/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 21:53:14 GMT","It's as good a time as any to take a broader look at the Flyers, who hit the 20-game mark with a somewhat disappointing 8-10-2 record.","NHL It’s as good a time as any to take a broader look at the Philadelphia Flyers, who hit the 20-game mark (10 at home, 10 on the road) with a somewhat disappointing 8-10-2 record and in sixth place in the Metropolitan Division, which has already seemed to separate itself into four teams that can contend for a Stanley Cup and four that are either rebuilding or have real issues. Advertisement Let’s get right to it. The two longtime pals have simply been the Flyers’ two best players this season. Travis Sanheim has anchored the defense group, which has endured a number of early-season injuries, while Travis Konecny has been the most consistent and dangerous forward. Sanheim is probably the Flyers’ MVP at the quarter point, contributing at both ends of the ice and playing the best hockey of his career. He’s a plus-2 on a team that’s been outscored by 17 at five-on-five. He’s third in the league in ice time with 25:33 per game, despite getting hardly any power-play time. Prior to Wednesday’s game, Sanheim eclipsed 30 minutes in three of the Flyers’ previous five games as the team continues to wait for others to get back into the lineup. All 12 of Sanheim’s points have come at even strength, putting him just one behind league co-leaders Alex Pietrangelo, Cale Makar and Owen Power. It was notable that when Rod Brind’Amour was asked before Wednesday’s game what the Flyers were doing differently from the last time they faced the Hurricanes just two weeks ago, he told reporters: “Sanheim is in the rush every play, like an old Bobby Orr back there from back in the day, which is fun to watch. … So, we’ve got to be aware of that guy.” Konecny remains the heartbeat of the team and is on a path toward his best season yet. He’s averaging more than a point per game (23 in 20 games), is on pace for 45 goals (11 so far), and leads the Flyers with five power-play goals. We’ll see how his eight-year contract that kicks in next season ages over time, but Konecny sure isn’t slowing down. Just the opposite. While Konecny is pulling his weight and Matvei Michkov is still producing through some inevitable rookie growing pains, every other scoring forward has been disappointing so far. Owen Tippett, Joel Farabee, Tyson Foerster and Bobby Brink, four young wingers with upside that the organization was hoping would take another step, have just 14 goals in a combined 76 games. Advertisement There have been some signs that they’re all working their way out of early season slumps. Three of Tippett’s four goals have come this month and he’s had the puck on his stick more often, Farabee has had a number of scoring chances lately and has been on the receiving end of some compliments from John Tortorella, and Foerster is starting to get back to playing hard along the wall and winning his battles, which he wasn’t doing much of earlier — a demotion to the fourth line seems to have gotten his attention. But the overall consistency from this group hasn’t been there. Yes, the power play has hit a bit of a snag lately, going just 2-for-20 in the last seven games. But losing both quarterbacks in Jamie Drysdale and Emil Andrae has predictably thrown it off course, while other players have been shuffled in and out of the two units lately, too. The Flyers sit 20th in the NHL in power-play percentage (16.9 percent), which is still more than three percentage points higher than they averaged from 2021-22 through last season. Once they get all their pieces back, and assuming Michkov becomes a more dangerous threat offensively as the season moves along, they could very well end up in the top half of the league. The penalty kill has simply picked up where it left off last season, sitting in fourth place in the league at 86.6 percent. The Flyers have just one shorthanded goal, but are still getting chances the other way: According to Natural Stat Trick, they are generating 9.69 scoring chances per 60 minutes on the penalty kill, third in the league. The good news on Wednesday is that Ryan Poehling’s shot from distance beat Pyotr Kochetkov in the second period, tying the game at 1-1. It was Poehling’s first goal of the season, and just the second from a Flyers center since Oct. 26 (Morgan Frost had the other on Nov. 5). Advertisement The bad news is that Poehling’s turnover later in the game helped to generate what turned out to be the game-winning goal, while Scott Laughton’s misplay early in the first period that Carolina also capitalized on earned the alternate captain some lengthy time on the bench. The Flyers just don’t have a high-end, play-driving center on the roster, while the guy that has the best chance to develop into one, Frost, has been a healthy scratch for four of the last five games. Is it time yet for general manager Daniel Brière to get a little aggressive to try and find one? Is it worth circling back to the Ducks to gauge interest in and maybe even take a chance on Trevor Zegras, perhaps? Zegras is only signed through next season, so even if the Flyers acquired him they wouldn’t be committed to him long-term. It just feels like it’s time for Brière to try something different here. It was unfortunate timing for Andrae when he got hurt late in last Saturday’s win over the Sabres, as he was earning big minutes and showing that he might be ready to stick around the NHL full-time. Fortunately for him and the team, Andrae was on the ice on Wednesday, suggesting he could be back soon. He’s second on the Flyers in expected goals share (55.6 percent), but just watching him (and speaking with him) it was becoming evident he has a growing confidence with and without the puck. Frankly, Andrae is turning into the player the Flyers were hoping Drysdale (1 goal, 2 assists in 15 games) would become. It’s much, much too early to write off Drysdale, who it seems was rushed into the NHL by the Ducks which may have stunted his development. But he’s going to be under the microscope when he returns from his upper-body injury, because the Flyers may not want to dress all of Andrae, York and Drysdale in the same games for fear of being too small on their back end. (For his part, Tortorella said he’s not afraid of doing this when asked a week ago. We’ll see.) Don’t blame Ersson for the Flyers being fourth from the bottom of the league in team goals-against average (3.50) through Wednesday’s games. The Flyers’ No. 1 goalie has been generally solid all season, with a 2.70 GAA and .902 save percentage in 11 games. He just seemed to be hitting his stride, too, before coming out of the lineup with what’s believed to be a groin injury: in his last five appearances, Ersson stopped 109 of 116 shots for a .940 save percentage in 257 minutes, with a 3-0-1 mark. Both Ersson and Tortorella mentioned early in the season when the goalie’s stat line wasn’t so hot that they believed he was playing better than the numbers suggested. That proved to be the case, because when the Flyers finally got some structure back in their game, Ersson was outstanding. Advertisement The 25-year-old still has an outside chance to make Team Sweden for the upcoming 4 Nations tournament, although Minnesota’s Filip Gustavsson is probably the odds-on favorite to be the No. 3 behind Jacob Markstrom and Linus Ullmark. But, considering his injury has occurred twice in a short period of time, he may be better off sitting it out anyway. The Flyers need him healthy if they’re going to have any chance at hanging around the playoff race due to their mishandling of the backup goalie position (see below). Yes, they’ve been a bit better lately, but there’s still a tremendous amount of uncertainty with both Ivan Fedotov and Aleksei Kolosov. It’s not a stretch to suggest neither of them would be on any other NHL team’s roster at the moment. Their combined numbers are awful: 3-8-0, with an .874 save percentage and 3.70 goals-against average. Their numbers are nearly identical (Fedotov’s .875 save percentage is slightly better than Kolosov’s .872, while his GAA of 3.69 is also just a tad better than Kolosov’s 3.71). Cal Petersen seems to be an afterthought in the organization at the moment, but he would have done better than that. If there’s reason for hope it probably lies more with Fedotov, who won three straight starts and looked to be settling in before he allowed a backbreaking soft third-period goal on Wednesday in the Flyers’ 4-1 loss to Carolina. He made some decent saves before that — his stop on Jack Roslovic in the first period on a two-on-none break seemed to give the Flyers energy at the time — but his overall body of work this season has still been subpar. Kolosov should return to the AHL when Ersson recovers. It’s not fair to Fedotov to have to share the net with him, and it’s not a good message to other players currently on the Phantoms who are working hard to make the leap, either. If he doesn’t want to play in Lehigh Valley, the Flyers should simply cut ties with him.

Advertisement The system won’t be installed in every spring ballpark, but all teams will have opportunities to play with it. MLB has tested two types of ABS in the minors: one that was used by umpires on every pitch, and another where teams had either two or three challenges per game. The league expects to give teams two challenges per game in spring training. At the end of 2024 in the minors, MLB started testing two challenges rather than three, and it wants to continue looking at that setup. Teams retain the challenge when they are correct, and so three challenges could amount to a higher volume of in-game stoppages.

And we’re gonna have to sort through both of those.” Manfred also has to collectively bargain a new contract with major league umpires, whose contract expired after the season, and the automated strike zone is a part of that negotiation. “We’re going to have to work through that issue as well,” Manfred said.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Packers' Jaire Alexander says he tore his PCL, unsure of return timetable",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938752/2024/11/21/packers-jaire-alexander-pcl-injury/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 21:34:13 GMT",Alexander suffered the initial knee injury against the Jaguars in Week 8 and reaggravated it last Sunday against the Bears.,"NFL GREEN BAY, Wis. — Green Bay Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander is dealing with more than just a routine knee injury. “I had a tear on my PCL,” he told The Athletic in the locker room on Thursday. Alexander suffered the initial injury late in the Packers’ win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 8 and missed Green Bay’s Week 9 game against the Detroit Lions. The Packers had a Week 10 bye and Alexander played only 10 defensive snaps against the Chicago Bears last Sunday before leaving the game and not returning. He practiced in a limited capacity each day last week and was listed as questionable for the game before playing. Advertisement Coach Matt LaFleur said Monday that Alexander was on a pitch count entering Sunday’s game, anyway, but that Alexander felt like he couldn’t play more than 10 snaps. “I stayed here the whole bye week trying to hopefully come back and make an impact for the team,” Alexander said. “It was a game-time decision at that, so we didn’t know … until, you know, a few minutes before the game if I would play or not. “I just tried to give it a go … I went out there and s–t, all I could really give was 10 plays and then it — I felt something. If you know how (posterior cruciate ligaments) work, it don’t just get done in three weeks, so it just needed more time. I reaggravated it going back out there and only doing 10 plays, so now we just trying to get my knee back right.” LIVE: Head Coach Matt LaFleur meets with the media 🎙️  https://t.co/iAscgcjASx — Green Bay Packers (@packers) November 21, 2024  Alexander, a second-team All-Pro in 2020 and 2022, was asked if he could return to that form at some point in the second half of this season. “Yessir. Oh, heck yeah. Of course,” he said. “You know, I just need more than 21 days of non-contact. It just needed more time because to take three weeks off and not do much, that still wasn’t enough.” So what exactly is he looking at for a return timetable? “I don’t know,” Alexander said. “I got a meeting today with everybody, so we gon’ kinda go and see what’s the best decision, so that’s all.” Alexander has missed 27 of a potential 61 regular-season games since the start of the 2021 season, with 26 of those due to various injuries. He missed 13 games with a shoulder injury in 2021, one game with a groin injury in 2022 and then three games with a back injury in 2023. Alexander missed Weeks 3 and 4 last season with the back injury and knew it was hurting entering a Week 5 game against former teammate Davante Adams and the Raiders, but, as Alexander said Thursday, he “had to play” and did so for all 64 defensive snaps in Las Vegas. He missed Week 6 with the same back injury. Alexander then missed six games later in the season with a shoulder injury, one while suspended, two more this season with a groin injury and now one and counting with his PCL injury. Advertisement Alexander has been an All-Pro in the last two seasons he’s played at least 15 games, but staying on the field has been a challenge for the $21 million-per-year cornerback who signed that then-record four-year extension in the 2022 offseason. “You’re talking about an elite player at his position, so it definitely is tough when he’s not out there,” LaFleur said. “That’s the case for a lot of teams in this league, missing players, and you’ve got to have the next guy step up, be ready to go and can never let that standard slip.” Edgerrin Cooper a new DNP at practice, which is indoors today.

He’s going to be Ja all the time, so his character never changes. He always has that energetic energy that we need and it’s good for all of us.” Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

In Alexander’s place, Green Bay’s two starting outside cornerbacks will likely be Keisean Nixon and Carrington Valentine, who played 64 defensive snaps against the Bears to Eric Stokes’ four. Valentine played a pivotal role in the Packers’ resurgence last season after they traded Rasul Douglas and while Alexander and Stokes were sidelined. Valentine hadn’t played more than 61 percent of the defensive snaps in a game this season before playing 89 percent last Sunday. Advertisement “It was good to get back out there, feel some things out, make some plays in the run game and stuff like that,” said Valentine, who missed Weeks 3 and 4 this season with an ankle injury after rotating with Stokes in Week 2. “It felt good and something to build off of. … I feel like the confidence for me never left, no matter what the injury was.” (Photo: Kevin Sabitus / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Daniel Jones bids farewell to Giants as time in N.Y. nears end: ‘Wish I could have done more’,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938588/2024/11/21/giants-daniel-jones-addresses-benching-bids-farewell/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 21:27:23 GMT",Daniel Jones confirmed that his $23 million injury guarantee was a contributing factor to the Giants' decision.,"NFL Giants quarterback Daniel Jones spoke to the media after Thursday’s practice, delivering an apparent farewell address after six seasons with the team. Jones was benched on Monday in favor of Tommy DeVito as the last-place Giants enter Week 12 at 2-8. Jones spent a portion of Thursday’s session wearing a red scout team jersey and afterward took accountability for his part in leading just one winning season since his arrival in 2019. Advertisement “The opportunity to play for the New York Giants was truly a dream come true. I’m extremely grateful to the Mara and Tisch families for the chance to play here,” Jones said. “No one wanted to win more games worse than me. I gave everything I had on the field and in preparation. Of course, this season has been disappointing for all and of course, I wish I could have done more. I’m 100% accountable for my part. I did not play well enough, consistently enough to help the team get (good) results.” Jones, currently in the second season of the four-year, $160 million contract extension signed in 2022, acknowledged that he’s “still processing” whether he’ll remain with the team for the rest of the season. GO DEEPER The Daniel Jones era is over. Giants bench QB after frustrating 6-year run The 27-year-old did confirm, though, that his $23 million injury guarantee contributed to the team’s decision to sit him. “I want to play. I want to be on the field. I tried to do as much as I could to make that possible and create a situation where we were both comfortable,” Jones said when asked whether he considered waiving the guarantee. “Unfortunate business side of the game.” With the expectation that he has played his final snap in a Giants uniform, Jones expressed excitement over his next opportunity. “I know there’s a lot of good football in front of me,” he said. Still, Jones was visibly emotional at points, particularly when thanking his teammates, coaches, staffers and fans. “To all the fans, I have deep respect and appreciation for your passion and love for the Giants. The fans are a huge part of what makes playing for the Giants so special.” It was strange to see Jones in a red scout-team pinnie lining up at safety during a walk-through period early in Thursday’s practice. But that’s the quarterback’s new reality, as he has dropped to fourth on the depth chart after the Giants benched him this week. Advertisement The Giants are essentially putting Jones in bubble wrap to avoid risking the $23 million injury guarantee in his contract, so he’s not participating in any live periods of practice. But Jones stood in at safety as the offensive line and quarterbacks prepped for the blitzes they’ll see from the Buccaneers on Sunday. Jones was joined on the ragtag scout team defense by practice squad offensive linemen and members of the coaching staff. That figures to be the extent of Jones’ practice participation for the final seven weeks of the season, unless he and the team reach an agreement to send him home. – Dan Duggan, Giants senior writer (Photo: Luke Hales / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

We can chalk that up to the enormity of the transfer portal and a few high-profile coaching changes that have made for strange sights — Mark Pope has Kentucky buzzing, John Calipari is at Arkansas, Eric Musselman is in Southern California and Tony Bennett is hopefully enjoying a few well-earned beach cocktails with those decorative umbrellas. Advertisement This weekend’s slate features an absolute banger in Duke-Arizona, plus some compelling early-season tournament action in West Virginia and the Bahamas. Here’s your guide to the next few days in college hoops. You can stream college basketball on Fubo (try for free). Time: Friday, 10:30 p.m. ET
TV: ESPN2 The preeminent matchup of this weekend’s slate yields two top teams recovering from high-profile losses. Duke (3-1) dropped a thriller to Kentucky, with freshman phenom Cooper Flagg turning the ball over in consecutive clutch possessions. Arizona (3-1) fell to Wisconsin, marking the Wildcats’ first November loss under coach Tommy Lloyd, who has held the position since 2021. Last weekend, the Wildcats were burned by the Badgers via the 3-ball. Arizona shot below 20 percent behind the arc, while Wisconsin exceeded 40 percent. Fifth-year guard Caleb Love needs to be much better. He enters Friday’s contest with a ghastly 43.5 true shooting percentage on a high usage rate. Junior Jaden Bradley has been significantly better. Bradley is shooting 50 percent from the field and has more than doubled last season’s scoring output to 14.7 points per game. Arizona isn’t fully playing to its offensive potential, and the 3-point defense may be cause for concern down the stretch, but this looks to be a dominant team off the glass, sitting second in the country in total rebounding. The fulcrum is 6-foot-8 Tobe Awaka. After two years of limited playing time at Tennessee, he looks comfortable in Tucson. He comes in averaging a double-double and leads the Big 12 in offensive boards. Arizona also plays fast — leading all major conference teams in adjusted possessions per 40 minutes. Duke’s duo of Flagg and Kon Knueppel commands attention, but this is a well-rounded squad under coach Jon Scheyer. Khaman Maluach, a 7-foot-2 freshman from South Sudan, gives the team a rim-runner and shot-blocker. In the Kentucky loss, Maluach was a perfect 5-for-5 from the field, and he blocked three shots in just 23 minutes of playing time. Australian junior Tyrese Proctor is the only returning three-year starter, and his presence can steady a group led by two freshmen. Advertisement Even as they adjust to a faster and more physical college game, Flagg and Knueppel are already generating sizable highlight reels. The latter is letting it fly, with more than half of his shot attempts coming on the long ball. He is on pace to attempt the most 3-pointers in a Duke season since Cam Reddish in 2018-19. Flagg, of course, is the presumed No. 1 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft. His game still has a few blemishes, especially around the perimeter — he’s 17 years old — but he’s already slicing into the paint and dunking with authority. Both teams are in the top 15 in adjusted offensive rating. This game should make for a solid watch with a high ceiling for pure entertainment. Memorable Matchup: Arizona 72, Duke 82, 2001 NCAA championship game — Mike Krzyzewski notched his third national title with the win. Four Blue Devils scored in double-digits. Mike Dunleavy Jr. had 21 points and shot 5-of-9 from behind the arc. Carlos Boozer added 12 points and 12 rebounds off the bench. The Wildcats were led by Loren Woods, who had 22 points, 11 boards and four blocks. This game ultimately yielded two NBA All-Stars (Boozer and Gilbert Arenas) and four additional lottery draft picks (Dunleavy Jr., Jay Williams, Shane Battier and Richard Jefferson). Nothing says November college basketball like a cool but totally random off-site tournament. This year’s Baha Mar Championship in Nassau features three ranked teams and a fourth premier program in Virginia. Thursday’s two winners will play each other on Friday in the championship (and Thursday’s two losers will also play each other on Friday). Let’s see what’s on tap. Time: Thursday, 7 p.m. ET
TV: CBSSN Baylor (3-1) and St. John’s (4-0) should both be fixtures in the national conversation this season. After an opening night thumping from Gonzaga, this Baylor outfit is building some momentum, besting Arkansas by five points and then dominating two lesser opponents. Freshman guard V.J. Edgecombe is a top prospect for next spring’s NBA Draft and a Bahamian national. He’s still seeking consistency on his jumper, coming into this weekend shooting 36.6 percent from the field and a paltry 17.6 percent on 3-pointers. Coach Scott Drew’s group is fifth in the nation in adjusted offensive rating. Imagine how scary this team will look with Edgecombe settled in. Nicaraguan forward Norchad Omier is a rebounding machine, with double-digit rebounding averages in all five seasons across three programs (Arkansas State, Miami and Baylor). Since winning it all in 2021, Baylor has been vanquished in the second round of the last three NCAA Tournaments. The Bears harbor high hopes for this spring. Advertisement St. John’s, meanwhile, is enjoying a much-needed program renaissance and enters rated 16th by KenPom. St. John’s doesn’t rely on the 3-point shot like the Bears, but it makes its name on the defensive end and is in the top 20 in block percentage and blocks per game. Opponents are struggling at the rim, and the Johnnies don’t give up many free throws. RJ Luis Jr. is a burgeoning star this fall, with nightly averages of 17.5 points, three assists and nearly eight rebounds. In a convincing 14-point win over New Mexico at Madison Square Garden on Sunday, Luis had 21 points and seven dimes to just one turnover. Rick Pitino played all of his starters for 33 or more minutes in that game. Four players attempted at least 10 shots. If this team has a glaring weakness, it would be its lack of depth and penchant for turnovers. Senior guard Kadary Richmond had seven of them against the Lobos. Baylor’s “no middle” defensive scheme generates a lot of pressure. If the Red Storm is to secure their first win over a ranked opponent in more than a decade, they will have to be more disciplined with their possessions. Time: Thursday, 9:30 p.m. ET
TV: CBSSN The Volunteers tout the NCAA’s fourth-best defense when adjusted for efficiency and have opened this campaign 4-0, with an impressive 22-point beatdown of Louisville on the road. The team is led by Zakai Zeigler, a four-year Vol that racks up buckets, dimes and steals. His 7.8 assists per game are a career-high, but so are his unsightly 4.5 turnovers. Croatian senior Igor Milicic Jr. transferred from Charlotte and has made more than two-thirds of his shot attempts so far. Tennessee is a double-digit favorite in this one. Virginia is looking for an identity in the post-Bennett era. It opened this season 4-0 but sits 77th in KenPom rating and 130th in adjusted offense. Granted, the Cavaliers have always been partial to a grinding style of basketball. Freshman Jacob Cofie already looks like an archetypal Virginia player, averaging two steals and 1.7 blocks. If this game gets close, it will likely be due to an Isaac McKneely heat check. A career 43.5 percent shooter on 3s, he has hit a blistering 64.7 percent of them so far this season. Now to the Allegheny Mountains, the Bahamas of Appalachia. The first-ever Greenbrier Tip-Off has an interesting pair of matchups, headlined by the surging Wisconsin Badgers. Time: Friday, 2:30 p.m. ET
TV: CBSSN The 5-0 Panthers and 4-0 Tigers are scheduled for a Friday afternoon tip. Pittsburgh guard Jaland Lowe just recorded the sixth triple-double in program history, and Jeff Capel’s team is off to its best start since 2018-19 — complete with a beatdown of West Virginia in the Backyard Brawl last week. LSU’s player to watch is undoubtedly Cam Carter. This year, the Kansas State transfer has been lights out from behind the arc at a 57 percent clip. Time: Friday, 5 p.m. ET
TV: CBSSN Wisconsin comes to this early in-season tournament with an abundance of momentum and good vibes. Its seismic win over Arizona was spearheaded by sixth-year guard John Tonje, who scored 41 points on 14 shots. Yep, read it again. UCF gets an arduous nonconference challenge before the loaded Big 12 schedule kicks in. The Knights stunned Texas A&M on their opening night, with fourth-year guard Darius Johnson scoring 24 points while burying five 3-pointers. The winners of these two games will play on Sunday afternoon at Colonial Hall — the Greenbrier’s massive convertible grand ballroom. Pinkies up.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Kirby Smart vs. the College Football Playoff committee and the statistics that matter most,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938257/2024/11/21/college-football-playoff-committee-kirby-smart/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 20:48:46 GMT",Let’s update each SEC team's yards-per-play differential and explosive-play differential and go deeper on schedule strength.,"NCAAF We’re pleased to return to America’s newest feud: Kirby Smart vs. the College Football Playoff committee. The latest iteration came when the selection committee placed Smart’s Georgia team at No. 10 in its latest rankings, and chairman Warde Manuel said the disparity in schedules makes it “difficult to assess” strength of schedule. Advertisement “We have to rely on how the teams are playing and who they’re playing as well as how the other teams, regardless of strength of schedule, are playing their opponents,” Manuel said. “We take a look at it holistically. Strength of schedule is a component. It’s an important data point to us and for us. But it is not the only assessment that we make.” Manuel pointed to Texas, ranked No. 3 despite zero wins over ranked teams, having a top-five defense. That got the attention of Smart, who spoke out again Wednesday. “It just seems unjust to me when you evaluate, somebody’s got a third-ranked defense or somebody’s got a fifth-ranked defense,” Smart said. “Well, don’t you think that third- or fifth-ranked defense is dictated by who they’ve played on offense and how many top offenses they’ve played? Because last time I checked, our offense and our defense have played the top offenses and defenses across the country.” Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox. The top offenses and defense? Not exactly. But many of them? Yes: • Georgia’s offense, which ranks 41st nationally in yards per play, has faced three of the nation’s top six defenses (Texas, Ole Miss, Tennessee) and five of the top 13 (Auburn and Alabama). • Georgia’s defense, which ranks 21st nationally, has faced three of the top 14 offenses (Ole Miss, Alabama, Auburn), as well as Texas (26th), Florida (36th), Clemson (38th) and Tennessee (46th). • As for that Texas defense that Manuel cited, it does rank first nationally, but it has faced one top-20 offense, Arkansas (19th) and two others in the top 50: Florida (36th), and Georgia (41st). But ultimately this may not come down to Georgia vs. Texas, rather which of the six SEC teams currently in contention — seven if you want to include South Carolina — are Playoff-worthy. This year, we’ve been tracking two stats that are key indicators: yards-per-play differential and explosive-play differential. Let’s update each and go deeper on schedule strength. Advertisement This is a rather simple measure. Take each team’s offensive and defensive yards per play, and the higher the former than the latter, then the better the team is doing. In years past, the Playoff-worthy teams tended to be at +2.00 or higher, although that was before the most recent conference moves. Here is the breakdown, first for all games and then just power-conference opponents: Explosive plays are defined differently by different people, but TruMedia Sports, which compiled these numbers, defines them as pass plays of 16-plus yards and rushes of 12-plus yards. These have been shown to be indicative of who wins individual games. Whoever has more in a game usually wins. Throughout a season it is also an indicator. Whereas the yards-per-play stat shows consistency and more of an overall picture, the ability to make and stop explosives matters in today’s more high-octane game. Here is the plus-minus for each team — total explosive plays, not per game — first in overall games: And this is the explosive play margin — per game, unlike the above total — for just power conference games: Texas again looks good in this metric, but Arkansas and its 5-5 record crash the party. So does Auburn (4-6), which also does well in the yards-per-play margin, while Vanderbilt (6-4) is near the bottom in both metrics. So what gives? Turnover margin is one easy answer. Auburn is tied for the worst turnover margin in the SEC, while Vanderbilt is tied for the fourth-best margin. Some of it may also be the Commodores are just overachieving because of a good quarterback who makes big plays, while Auburn, well, is not. There are many explanations and metrics. But let’s finish up with Smart’s favorite one, at least right now: The selection committee uses SportSource Analytics, but that data isn’t public. There are publicly available schedule strengths, including ESPN’s, which has Georgia at No. 1 and every SEC team in the top 38 — with Texas being that last one in at No. 38. Advertisement But let’s try something a little different and quantify the schedule strength by offense and defense. To do that, we go through the average yards per play for every opponent’s offense and defense. First, to measure the schedule strength of each team’s offense, here is the average yards-per-play rank of their opponents’ defenses, including all FBS opponents: Now, to measure the schedule strength of each team’s defense, here is the average yards-per-play rank of their opponents’ offenses, again including all FBS opponents: Well, maybe that helps excuse some of Oklahoma’s offensive issues. And it’s hard not to notice the opposition that Texas and Ole Miss, which dominate the yards-per-play metric. As for Georgia, yes it has had the second-hardest road in the SEC on offense and defense. That’s something for Smart to cite in his next remarks against the selection committee. (Photo: Todd Kirkland / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"NBA All-Star Game's likely tourney format could feature top coaches in East, West: Sources",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938627/2024/11/21/nba-all-star-game-tournament-coaches/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 20:45:25 GMT","If the new format is adopted, as expected, there would be more than one losing team.","NBA The coaching staffs from the top two teams in the NBA’s Eastern and Western Conferences could direct the four groups of All-Stars in a new tournament competition being considered for the league’s annual midseason classic in San Francisco, two team officials told The Athletic Thursday. As part of expansive negotiations under way between multiple stakeholders to dramatically change how the NBA All-Star Game looks, one issue to be ironed out is who coaches the up to four teams that might compete in a tournament-style competition on All-Star Sunday. Advertisement As The Athletic first reported earlier this month, the NBA is considering sweeping changes to its All-Star Game that would be implemented in February, following several years of a disappointing on-court product by the league’s top players. A four-team tournament setting is likely, multiple league sources said, with three teams of eight NBA All-Stars and a fourth team of rookies and sophomores who win the Rising Stars Challenge on All-Star Friday. The format being strongly considered would match the Rising Stars format, in which teams would play to a target score of 40 in a tournament semifinal and 25 in the championship — both of which would be held on All-Star Sunday in lieu of a traditional East versus West All-Star Game with 12-minute quarters. The league, players’ union, coaches and team executives are still ironing out all of the details, including prize money doled out to winners and losers of the tournament and how the teams are selected. When it comes to who coaches the four teams, numerous league officials agree the coach of the top team in each respective conference will direct two of the four All-Star teams. According to two team officials with direct knowledge of league discussions to this point, staffs from the top two teams in each conference could be involved on All-Star Sunday, but other league sources said that option had not been discussed with all stakeholders. In another scenario being discussed, the coach of the Rising Stars team that advances from Friday’s competition to Sunday would retain its coach – likely an assistant from one of the top two NBA teams’ staffs – and it was unknown who the coach of the third All-Star team might be. As of Thursday, Kenny Atkinson has the Cleveland Cavaliers in first place in the East, with the best overall record in the NBA. The top team in the West is the Golden State Warriors, coached by Steve Kerr. The second place team in the East is the Boston Celtics, coached by Joe Mazzulla, and the second place team in the West is the Oklahoma City Thunder, coached by Mark Daigneault. Advertisement Under the league’s new collective bargaining contract with the players’ union, players on the winning team at the All-Star Game would receive $100,000 and players on the losing side would receive $25,000. However, that agreement was struck before the league began serious discussions with players – including, notably, perennial All-Star and likely host for the 2025 game, Stephen Curry – about changing the format. If the Rising Stars format is adopted for the NBA All-Star Game, as expected, there would be more than one losing team.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Oilers' Darnell Nurse on head hit from Leafs' Ryan Reaves: 'I think it’s pretty obvious what’s going on there',https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938570/2024/11/21/oilers-darnell-nurse-rangers-ryan-reaves-head-hit/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 20:29:02 GMT",Nurse won’t play Thursday when the Oilers host the Minnesota Wild.,"NHL EDMONTON – Edmonton Oilers defenseman Darnell Nurse started by trying to be diplomatic. He even accepted some of the blame for the outcome. Then, he stopped mincing his words and gave his true feelings about Toronto Maple Leafs’ Ryan Reaves crushing him with a head hit last Saturday. “He came after and apologized,” Nurse said after Thursday’s morning skate, the first time he’s been on the ice since the incident. “In situations like that, there’s definitely an onus on the player with the puck to be aware of where everyone else is on the ice. Advertisement “With that said, even if you put yourself in a bad spot, there is lots of body in a 6-foot-4 hockey player to hit and not one piece was touched other than my head. You can argue about the intent, but there are certain guys in the league that every shift they go out there and they go out and try to inflict pain. I think it’s pretty obvious what’s going on there.” Reaves was given a match penalty at 2:41 of the second period of an eventual 4-3 overtime win by the Maple Leafs when his attempted check made direct contact with Nurse’s head. Nurse was left woozy and bloodied and remained on the ice as the officials reviewed the play and confirmed the penalty call. He needed help from Edmonton’s head athletic therapist T.D. Forss and winger Mattias Janmark to get to the dressing room. Reaves, who has 1,093 penalty minutes in 893 NHL games, was issued a five-game suspension the next day. Toronto’s Ryan Reaves has been suspended for five games for an illegal check to the head against Edmonton’s Darnell Nurse. https://t.co/GyVuA2TLmG — NHL Player Safety (@NHLPlayerSafety) November 17, 2024  Nurse said he remembers the hit and is feeling better, but the sclera of his right eye was noticeably red. He was also sporting a black eye. Nurse won’t play Thursday when the Oilers host the Minnesota Wild. Coach Kris Knoblauch said Nurse might return to the lineup Saturday when they face the New York Rangers. After Saturday’s game, the Oilers are off until next Friday when they visit Utah for the first time. “With these things, (the) timeline is up to multiple people, so what I feel sometimes isn’t indicative of what’s going to happen,” Nurse said. “I’m just going to take it a day at a time. I haven’t looked too far ahead. If I’m feeling good, I always want to be out there. We’ll see how it goes.” Advertisement The especially unfortunate part for the Oilers and Nurse is that he was playing some of his best hockey of the season. Nurse had a three-point outing last Thursday against the Nashville Predators, including two goals and the game winner in overtime. Nurse has two goals and nine points with a plus-2 rating this season. His 20:49 average ice time ranks third on the team for blueliners behind Evan Bouchard and Mattias Ekholm and fifth overall behind Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl. The Oilers called up blueliner Josh Brown from AHL Bakersfield on Sunday. Brown played his first two games for Edmonton on Monday and Tuesday. The Oilers sent him down on Wednesday but recalled him on Thursday. “Frustration is what you make of the situation,” Nurse said. “Any situation that you’re in you can be frustrated about it, but it’s an injury and it’s part of the job. “You’re going to go out there and things are going to happen and sometimes you’re going to get injured. You have to do whatever you can to get back to 100 percent and get out there and be as effective as you can be.” Nurse said this is the first time he’s sustained a head injury in his career. The Oilers are also missing wingers Viktor Arvidsson and Zach Hyman due to undisclosed injuries. Arvidsson has missed the last four games, which will likely extend to at least six. He won’t play Thursday and isn’t expected to dress on Saturday. Knoblauch said Hyman will be out four to seven days. The Oilers claimed winger Kasperi Kapanen off waivers from St. Louis on Tuesday. They also recalled winger Drake Caggiula from the minors on Wednesday. Both are scheduled to play against the Wild – Kapanen with Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Jeff Skinner, and Caggiula with Derek Ryan and Corey Perry.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,What does Pep Guardiola staying mean for Manchester City?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5937112/2024/11/21/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-contract-what-it-means/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 20:15:11 GMT",The manager's decision to sign a new contract is a huge boost for the club and may strengthen their hand in the January transfer window,"EPL At a time of significant uncertainty around Manchester City and the Premier League, Pep Guardiola’s new contract is a major boost for the club. The Brighton fans sang “you’re getting sacked in the morning” as City lost their fourth match in a row before the international break, but the quality of the manager and his employers’ absolute confidence in him meant that, far from scrutiny, in his two weeks off, he was handed a new deal that should see him stay at City for another two years. Advertisement Guardiola’s ability speaks for itself and has been reiterated by the latest City in-house documentary, but the very fact he remains in place is surely just as valuable given the change of sporting director, the possible departure of some key players and, of course, an impending outcome of the Premier League charges. The news is not necessarily going to provide an immediate fix to City’s current issues on the pitch because, in the most part, the recent run of defeats has been caused by something that good vibes cannot fix: injuries. City may also be lacking in physicality and mobility without Rodri even when everybody else is fit and that might be something they feel they have to rectify in January.  And given those current fallibilities, games against Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool are far from ideal. When Guardiola signed a new deal in November 2020, his team had been struggling for a while and they did not immediately get better — they actually lost at Spurs in the very next game and it took a few weeks for things to click. Crucially, things did click. That is what you tend to get with Guardiola; if not quite an assurance, then a confidence that things are going to turn out OK, and that is what City have secured for another season at least. They may have to wait a little while for the boost to become evident due to those injuries, but it surely will. The people at the very top of the club have got even more than they wanted (two years is beyond what most had even hoped for) and so have the fans. The players will know that the biggest driving force, the one that helps get the best out of them, will remain in place, and even those who may not be too enamoured with the manager will know that his power base is stronger than ever. City generally manage to generate momentum from somewhere when they need it most: last season, they had the mid-season trip to Saudi Arabia for the Club World Cup, which allowed them to reset after a painful home draw against Crystal Palace. Advertisement The year before that, the announcement of the charges levelled against the club by the Premier League certainly seemed to galvanise the team when they were struggling for consistency. So while the injury situation is an immediate concern (and one that should be clearing up soon, barring Rodri’s season-long absence), the benefits of Guardiola’s renewal are obvious in the medium and long term, not least when it comes to squad planning. For starters, it might help in January if City try to strengthen the midfield — being able to say that Guardiola is there and fully motivated is going to help attract players in most cases (that is probably going to be the case when it comes to tying Erling Haaland down to a new deal, too). City are set to change director of football in the summer, with Hugo Viana arriving to replace Txiki Begiristain, who has been there for 12 years. It goes without saying that not having to replace both the football director and the manager at the same time is probably going to be beneficial, but beyond that, there should be extra confidence that Guardiola staying in charge will help smooth over the transition above him, particularly when it comes to bringing new players into a relatively stable environment. There is certainly the potential to make some big changes in the summer, chiefly because Kevin De Bruyne’s contract is set to expire, but also because there has been uncertainty around other key players in recent seasons, which may rear its head again, specifically regarding Ederson, Kyle Walker and Bernardo Silva — the latter has been open to an exit for years but, admittedly, never actually leaves. Ilkay Gundogan only just rejoined in the summer and has 18 months left on his deal, but he has yet to recapture his best form and, if that situation were to continue, he would at the very least be looking at a reduced role next season. Advertisement City did not make big moves in the most recent window, largely because most of the key players did not actually go, so there was no need to replace them, but that could change next summer. There is certainly a feeling, from the outside at least, that City could do with freshening things up in midfield and there could also be a situation where Jack Grealish’s future is up for discussion, as he missed much of last season through injury and off-field issues and has so far been unable to put that right. There is also money to spend, which sounds obvious given City’s backing and the general perception of their spending, but they do not always utilise their vast fortunes. In fact, over the past five years, City have brought in far more money than they have spent in the transfer window. Guardiola personally has not wanted to bring too many players in either, partly because he does not want a crowded squad and the associated risk of unsettling those who do not play, and also because he keeps an eye on the club’s finances, too. For example, a deal was close to being agreed for Celtic striker Kyogo Furuhashi in the summer, but it was Guardiola who decided against it, despite Julian Alvarez leaving for Atletico Madrid. In that sense, there are no guarantees Guardiola’s continuation at City will bring major changes to the squad. In fact, it suggests the opposite, but it is tempting to believe that with Begiristain leaving and Guardiola now committed to the club for at least another season — possibly so he can help smooth over the transition — as well as the prospect of at least a couple senior players moving on, City might make some serious moves to ensure the club is in a strong position for the final years of the Guardiola era. Quite possibly for the first years of the post-Pep era, too; Guardiola has always wanted to leave the club in a good position and that is surely the case now more than ever. Given Viana’s arrival — he will spend some time at the club before the end of the season to help the transition process — and Guardiola’s new deal, there will be a particular focus on putting City in a position to thrive when the manager finally does depart. And then there are those charges. We are finally within touching distance of an outcome that will, of course, have major implications. If City were to be found guilty of some or many of the most serious charges, then a serious sanction would surely follow and that may limit their capacity or appetite to strengthen the squad. Advertisement Should they avoid any major sanctions and presumably remove the spectre of, say, relegation or an enormous fine, they may feel emboldened to spend the money that they have brought in in recent years. In terms of what we can read into Guardiola’s new deal when it comes to the charges, it is fair to say that had he announced his departure this week, there would have surely been a widespread assumption that City were fearing the worst regarding the hearing. Much is made of his comments in 2022 when he said, “If you lie to me, the day after I am not here,” but on plenty of occasions since then, he has struck a more defiant tone, insisting he would be more determined than ever to stay, even if the club were relegated. Given Guardiola is staying, logically there is social media speculation that City must be confident things will go their way. In reality, Guardiola made his decision based on other factors — his energy to continue and the happiness of his family — because everybody on the football side at City has been going about their business on the assumption that the club has done nothing wrong and will not be punished. That has been the message from the top, not just since the charges were levelled last February, but since the first Football Leaks-led reports in 2018. Business as usual, then, as Guardiola gears up for his next big challenge… Spurs on Saturday. (Top photo: Gualter Fatia/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The Athletic exclusively reported on Tuesday that the 53-year-old had agreed fresh terms on a new deal to take him past 10 years service for the Premier League club, with his previous contract due to expire at the end of the current campaign. Advertisement City are on a run of four straight defeats in all competitions and Guardiola said he wanted to stay and help “turn the situation” around. “I want to be honest, I thought this (season) should be the last one. But the problems we had in the last month, I felt now was not the time to leave. I didn’t want to let the club down,” he said. He added: “Manchester City means so much to me. This is my ninth season here, we have experienced so many amazing times together. I have a really special feeling for this football club. That is why I am so happy to be staying for another two more seasons. “I have said this many times before, but I have everything a manager could ever wish for, and I appreciate that so much. Hopefully now we can add more trophies to the ones we have already won. That will be my focus.” Guardiola arrived at the Etihad Stadium in July 2016 and has masterminded an unprecedented period of success since then. The Spaniard has won 18 trophies during his time in English football, including six Premier League titles — second in the all-time list behind former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson (13). In 2022-23, he helped City become only the second English side after Ferguson’s 1998-99 team to win the Treble — comprising the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League. Last term his side made history by becoming the first team to win four successive top-flight titles.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Colorado’s 2-way star Travis Hunter plans to enter next year's NFL Draft, play both WR and CB",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938396/2024/11/21/travis-hunter-nfl-draft-comments/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 19:09:39 GMT","The 6-foot-1, 185-pound junior WR and cornerback for the Buffaloes also said he intends to play on both sides of the ball at the next level.","NCAAF In the least stunning news of the 2024 season, Heisman Trophy frontrunner and likely No. 1 overall pick in next year’s NFL Draft Travis Hunter confirmed that this will indeed be his last year in college football. In a conference call with media members Thursday, Colorado’s dynamic two-way superstar confirmed he is bound for the NFL in 2025. The 6-foot-1, 185-pound junior wide receiver and cornerback for the Buffaloes also said he intends to play on both sides of the ball at the next level. Hunter’s 2024 Heisman campaign received a boost in last weekend’s 49-24 win over Utah. Advertisement The Colorado star hauled in his third interception of the year, had his first rushing touchdown of the year and had five catches for 55 yards. He also had a highlight-reel snag in triple coverage that was yet another Heisman moment for college football’s most unique player. In 2024, Hunter leads the Buffaloes with 911 yards on 74 receptions and nine receiving touchdowns. Before Colorado improved to 8-2 with the win over Utah on its roll toward a Big 12 Conference title game appearance, Colorado head coach Deion Sanders was asked on FOX’s “Big Noon Kickoff” if he had to choose to give a Heisman vote to Hunter or his son, Buffaloes quarterback Shedeur Sanders, who would he choose. Deion said it would go to Hunter. After his performance against the Utes, Deion doubled down. “Travis is who he is,” Sanders said. “It’s supposed to go to the best college football player. I think that’s been a wrap since, what, Week 2?” A former five-star high school recruit, Hunter decommitted from Florida State — Sanders’ alma mater — nearly three years ago and chose to play for Sanders at Jackson State in 2022 before following Sanders to Boulder. Hunter’s declaration is the least surprising thing we’ve seen all year. The Colorado dynamo started gaining traction as the country’s No. 1 prospect on scouting boards early this season. Nothing about that has slowed, as Hunter’s college run (especially the two FBS seasons) as a full-time two-way skill player is really unlike anything we’ve ever seen in modern college football. Charles Woodson won a Heisman Trophy in 1997 as a defensive player who played sparingly on offense. Hunter rarely misses a snap and has been the best player on both sides of the ball in every college game in which he’s worn a helmet. Whether he’ll be selected with the first pick in the draft remains to be seen, as several NFL teams remain desperate for a QB. However, it’s hardly impossible that Hunter becomes either the first wide receiver to go No. 1 since Keyshawn Johnson (1996) or the first-ever CB to land the top spot. Advertisement Everyone has questions about whether the two-way business can continue in the NFL. Though it’s not foolish to suggest Hunter could be a team’s top corner while spending some time as an offensive gimmick/returner. I’m also not going to doubt him just yet, as he’s pretty unique. — Nick Baumgardner, senior writer  (Photo: Christian Petersen / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here Jeff Gluck/The Athletic For those who had to leave their pets at home, a free souvenir opportunity inside the paddock: A dog tag maker called “Pup Position.” Inside an oversized dog house placed between the Ferrari and McLaren hospitality areas, people are lining up to bring a little piece of the Las Vegas Grand Prix back to Fido. Advertisement Getty Images Today is media day in Las Vegas, meaning F1 has teed up a few figures to speak at its media conferences ahead of the racing. The teams and other parties will have their own media sessions planned too, but here is who F1 has lined up:  Today — drivers Tomorrow — team principals Let’s see what everyone has to say, and if there are any late changes to the lineup… Getty Images Zhou Guanyu doesn’t know which color he’ll be wearing in the Formula One paddock next year, though he knows it won’t be Sauber’s green and black colors after the announcement last week that the Chinese driver’s tenure with the team is ending at the end of the current season. “You will see me in the paddock, which color I don’t know,” Zhou said. “I’ll leave that to be seen.” Although Zhou’s plans aren’t yet finalized for 2025, he is confident he will have a place in the sport in some capacity, likely as a reserve driver. He is seeking that role to vault himself into a position to return full-time in 2026, aided by an extensive testing program as part of the role. “I feel like I'm in a position to not rush to make that decision because I need to make sure I’m with a team that can give me a chance to maybe having a seat back, and then also a team that I can continue to grow as a driver,” Zhou said. “So we need to take a bit more time, it won't be decided in the next month.” Sauber is completely overhauling its driver lineup in 2025, with both Zhou and Valtteri Bottas exiting. Replacing Zhou and Bottas are Nico Hülkenberg and Formula 2 championship leader Gabriel Bortoleto. Bortoleto is among a sizable group of drivers with less than a full year’s experience who are set to be on the grid next year. That influx is factoring into Zhou’s decision to pursue a reserve driver role, with the thinking that one (or more) of these young drivers may underperform to the point where their team decides to make a move. “There's a lot of opportunities that could happen for ‘26 onwards,” Zhou said. “I still want to stay here in a reserve role … hopefully waiting for a good opportunity to come back.” Luke Smith Good day from Las Vegas, where my body is currently trying to work out what time it actually is!  We’re on PST, but effectively on Japanese time due to the night race — meaning there’s been a split in approach among most people I’ve spoken to.  Do you try to stay up late, or go to bed at a ‘normal-ish’ time? I really have no idea, still. The timezone challenge was immense last year, particularly after second practice got delayed so much it did not finish until 4am. This year it should be a little easier, given FP2 and qualifying are now scheduled for 10pm instead of midnight. But the race remains a 10pm start, meaning we'll be working long into the small hours of Sunday morning. I’ve been out for a walk along the Strip, and it’s looking more and more like a race track. The organizers in Vegas do a terrific job to keep the roadways as open as possible to ensure traffic can flow before then closing them to prepare for the on-track sessions.  There are plenty of fans around wearing all kinds of merch. It’s nice to see so much interest and support here for the race.  As usual, F1 tire provider Pirelli has assessed what’s in store for the field in Las Vegas from its headquarters in Milan — and it makes for interesting reading. With the Nevadan track being the second longest on the 2024 calendar behind Spa-Francorchamps, and the Mojave desert temperature drop for the nighttime race, Pirelli expects the cars to run in air temperatures of around 10C (50 degrees Fahrenheit). It will also be a similar track temperature. In short, it’s going to be cold. Those temperatures and visiting a street circuit allows Pirelli to use its softest compound tires, and it expects most cars to take on a two-stop strategy come the race — although a one-stop will remain an option for those teams who are confident they can make it work.  Pirelli also suggests that going longer with the first stint of the race — basically putting off your first pit stop as long as possible — will be more beneficial than trying to go longer at the end, because it will take a while to get the tires up to their ideal operating temperature from off the grid.  If you’ve read this far, make sure you take a closer look at Pirelli’s preview graphic, attached above.  Getty Images The prospect of Max Verstappen clinching his fourth world championship at the Las Vegas Grand Prix, F1’s glitziest race, is exciting for the sport. Verstappen will secure the title with two rounds to spare if he can finish ahead of Lando Norris on Saturday night or if Norris fails to outscore him by three points. Preparations are already being made by officials behind the Las Vegas Grand Prix in conduction with Red Bull in the event that Verstappen was to wrap up the title. I spoke earlier today with Renee Wilm, the CEO of the Las Vegas Grand Prix, and Emily Prazer, the chief commercial officer of F1 and the Las Vegas Grand Prix, who stayed tight-lipped on plans but confirmed things are in motion. “Emily is never without an idea for a spectacle,” Wilm said, teeing up Prazer to explain her thinking. “I obviously work really closely with the Red Bull team across the board, whether it's hospitality or marketing or whatever,” Prazer said. “So we called them, we said, let's have a chat about what this looks like if you win. Obviously, we're in Vegas, so we want to help you put on a huge party. “There's mixed thoughts on that from their camp, but we have a significant plan as you'd expect. I don't want to ruin it, though … Just watch out for the Bellagio fountains.” GO FURTHER How Max Verstappen can win the drivers’ championship in Las Vegas and light up F1’s glitziest race Advertisement  When a loose water valve cover wrecked the underside of Carlos Sainz’s Ferrari and canceled the opening practice session after just eight minutes last year, F1’s $650 million bet on bringing the sport to Las Vegas looked risky. From then on, the weekend was deemed a huge success.  Which brings us to year two, with Vegas now lacking the novelty and unknowns of its inaugural race. That is why they listened to feedback and put together a playbook for this second visit — in the words of Las Vegas GP CEO Renee Wilm: 💬 “I wouldn’t say it’s easier in year two. But it is a significantly different experience.” You can read up on the road Vegas has taken from last year to this, with an excellent piece from Luke Smith below. You’ll enjoy this one.    GO FURTHER F1 prepares for Las Vegas GP’s second year: ‘Now we have a playbook’  The U.S. was back in the F1 spotlight come October, as Texas’ Circuit of The Americas hosted the 2024 United States Grand Prix.  It started in ominous fashion, with Red Bull’s upgrades delivering a dominant sprint race victory for Max Verstappen — his first F1 win of any kind in 112 days. But that pace didn’t carry into the grand prix sessions. Lando Norris delivered a stunning lap in an aborted Q3 to claim pole for McLaren, before Ferrari took the race by storm as Charles Leclerc blitzed his third victory of the year, with outgoing teammate Carlos Sainz just behind. The rest of the fun was saved for Norris and Verstappen, whose lengthy sparring ended with Norris’ late overtake of the Dutchman while both cars exceeded track limits. Verstappen picked up a warning, Norris got a five-second penalty for not handing back the position, and it was Red Bull who could celebrate the final podium spot.  GO FURTHER Charles Leclerc wins F1 U.S. Grand Prix, Lando Norris loses podium to late penalty  Las Vegas is the last of Formula One’s three visits to the United States in 2024. It all kicked off with the Miami Grand Prix back in May, where Max Verstappen took sprint and grand prix pole in qualifying — also dominating the sprint race. But the grand prix was a different matter, and a little piece of history for Lando Norris as the McLaren driver claimed his first F1 victory. That felt like quite the moment, given Norris went on to push Verstappen as his chief title rival during the year.   The inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix last year came with a lot of pre-race hype and razzmatazz — and then the track action trumped it all.  In a season of routine predictability, this race was as good as it got. Even Max Verstappen didn’t have things all his own way, penalized for forcing Charles Leclerc off the track at Turn 1 (we’d seen that move a few times before and since) — but then showing Red Bull’s dominance to claw his way back into the lead. Leclerc was supreme in pinching second off Sergio Perez in the final corners, while Esteban Ocon excelled in claiming fourth for Alpine.  A repeat of the action this year on F1’s second visit would be very welcome.

The Athletic obtained a copy of the memo. This alert comes after burglaries at the homes of Kansas City Chiefs stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce last month. Two law enforcement officials told NBC News the FBI is working with local agencies to determine whether the recent burglaries are connected to a transnational crime syndicate. Per NBC’s report Wednesday, there has been no determination about who is responsible and the investigation is ongoing. Advertisement “The homes of professional athletes across multiple sports leagues have become increasingly targeted for burglaries by organized and skilled groups,” the NFL’s memo said. “Law enforcement officials have noted these groups appear to exploit team schedules to target athletes’ homes on game days.” The memo also included ways the groups survey players’ whereabouts and explained methods of entry into homes. The league security team provided recommendations regarding the use of social media, including avoiding posting images of expensive items or comments about hotel accommodations. The memo also spelled out methods of home security. The NFL issued this security alert to clubs to tell their players and staff about “organized and skilled” criminals increasingly targeting professional athletes' homes. pic.twitter.com/EoArE8dTw0 — Dianna Russini (@DMRussini) November 21, 2024  Mahomes addressed the incident involving his home last Wednesday, calling it “frustrating” and “disappointing.” “I can’t get into too many of the details because the investigation is still ongoing,” he said. “But obviously something that you don’t want to happen to really anybody, but obviously yourself.” Officers responded to a reported burglary shortly after midnight on Oct. 6 at Mahomes’ estate in Belton, Mo., according to a police report from the Cass County, Mo. Sheriff’s Office. Mahomes is not identified in the report, but the address listed matches public records for the three-time Super Bowl MVP quarterback. A day after the reported burglary at Mahomes’ home, another reported burglary occurred around 7:30 p.m. on Oct. 7 at a residence in Leawood, Kan., believed to belong to Kelce, according to a Leawood Police Department offense report. The Chiefs beat the New Orleans Saints at Arrowhead Stadium in a “Monday Night Football” game that night with Taylor Swift, Kelce’s girlfriend, in attendance. Advertisement The police report for the incident indicated that $20,000 in cash was taken and that there was $1,000 worth of damage to a rear door.

The FGF said in a statement on Thursday that it filed a formal complaint about the alleged error following the qualifier. The Tanzanian Football Federation (TFF) later said it had not received any indication from the Confederation of African Football (CAF), which organises AFCON, that their player’s participation in the match was “illegal”. Advertisement Tanzania won the match 1-0 in its capital of Dar es Salaam, which saw them book their spot in the 2025 AFCON by finishing second in their qualification group, one point ahead of third-placed Guinea. But the FGF claims that the shirt number error should result in Tanzania being penalised by losing the match and the victory and three points instead awarded to Guinea, which would see them qualify instead. The incident in question occurred in the 73rd minute of Tuesday’s game, when Ibrahim Ame was introduced. The FGF claims that he wore the No 26 in error, as there was no player with that number listed on the official teamsheet. The TFF, though, adds that its players were checked by Guinea and the match commissioner ahead of the game and that it is “surprised” about the claim regarding the illegitimacy of Ame’s participation.

The Sparks announced Thursday that they have partnered with Transwestern Real Estate Services to begin the process of building a practice facility. Advertisement Transwestern works with teams and leagues to acquire land and properties and provide brokerage services. The company has been part of recent projects with the Phoenix Mercury and Overtime Elite. “We are building more than a practice facility; we are investing in the future of women’s basketball in Los Angeles,” Sparks governor Eric Holoman said in a statement. “This facility is part of a broader vision to elevate the LA Sparks as the premier franchise in the WNBA and to create an environment where our players have every resource they need to achieve greatness. Los Angeles is a city of champions, and we are determined to bring that winning legacy to the Sparks.” For the last two seasons, L.A. practiced out of El Camino College, a community college in Torrance, Calif. The Sparks shared the space with students at the school, restricting their access to the building and forcing players to look elsewhere to work out beyond those hours. The absence of a dedicated facility used to be a common experience for WNBA players across the league; however, the recent ownership arms race has led to most teams building their own facilities. A divide has emerged in free agency between the “haves” and the “have nots,” as players target franchises with better amenities. Seattle and Phoenix opened new practice spaces in 2024, while Dallas and Chicago are on track to debut theirs in 2026. Additionally, commissioner Cathy Engelbert has made it incumbent upon expansion teams to have facilities when submitting bids. Los Angeles is merely following suit, as Atlanta and Connecticut are the only other teams out of 13 without their own practice facility or a plan to build one. For the time being, the Sparks will still be in the “have not” camp, as the team has not specified a site for the facility nor a timeline for its construction; the players will spend the 2025 season in a shared space. Advertisement However, Los Angeles’ six-person ownership group contains five owners of the Los Angeles Dodgers, who have famously opened their pocketbooks to attract stars and create a world-class organization. They have the resources to transform their WNBA operation in a similar manner, and enlisting Transwestern’s services is the first step in leveling the Sparks with the rest of the league.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,NHL trade board 2024-25: The latest on all the top targets from Chris Johnston,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5930174/2024/11/21/nhl-trade-board-marchand-hall-nelson/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:00:11 GMT","From Brock Nelson to Brad Marchand to Taylor Hall, the NHL trade market is starting to take shape early this season.","NHL NHL executives didn’t even need to wait for the Thanksgiving turkey to be served before seeing the trade market start to take some early shape. Talks have been brisk well in advance of a holiday that tends to serve as the unofficial point at which front offices begin to take stock of their standing and look around for solutions and improvements. The early-season struggles have been especially pronounced for the Nashville Predators and Boston Bruins, the latter firing coach Jim Montgomery this week less than two years after he won the Jack Adams Award as the league’s top coach. The possibility of personnel changes now hangs in the air. GO DEEPER Bruins trade tiers: Which players could follow the coach out the door? There are a lot of games still to be played before we sort out the league-wide buyers and sellers ahead of the March 7 trade deadline, but it’s not too soon to start sketching out where things could be headed. For the first time in 2024-25, it’s the return of the Big Board. Note: Net Ratings and market values are via Dom Luszczyszyn’s model and are projected for the full season based on statistics through Nov. 19. Goals saved above expected (GSAx) are via Evolving-Hockey, also through Nov. 19. Contract info is via CapWages. Now into his ninth NHL season of averaging at least 22 minutes per night, this all-situations defender is delivering strong play-driving results for a Blue Jackets team that has been more competitive than many were expecting through a quarter of the schedule. Still, the rebuild is on in Columbus and Provorov is a pending unrestricted free agent. A left-shot defenseman who is comfortable playing on both sides of the ice, Provorov carries an attractive cap hit of $4.725 million and will likely net the Blue Jackets a first-round pick before the deadline. Rangy and reliable, there’s nothing flashy about Pettersson’s game. But he has proven in recent years that he can handle 20-plus minutes per night while helping drive play at even strength and should be able to slot in as a second-pairing defenseman on a competitive team. Penguins general manager Kyle Dubas has a big project on his hands, but Pettersson is his most attractive asset to peddle at this year’s deadline — assuming his legacy players with no-movement clause remain untouchable. A mainstay on the Anaheim blue line for 15 years and more than 1,000 games, Fowler is feeling the ground shift beneath his feet with five defensemen aged 25 or younger currently playing alongside him in the Ducks lineup. When you couple that with the fact he has one year beyond this one remaining on his contract at a $6.5 million cap hit, the conditions may be ripe for him to move to a team in a more advanced stage of its competitive window. Fowler and the Ducks will need to work closely on any potential move since the player owns a four-team trade list. However, there’s no reason to expect him to use that to block a trade. The alarm bells started to sound when Hall was scratched for a game last week. He’s struggled to regain form after missing most of last season due to a knee injury, but NHL Edge data shows that one of his strongest attributes — his powerful skating stride — remains. Hall’s top speed of 22.46 miles per hour is well above league average. With the Blackhawks on a trajectory for another spin in the draft lottery and Hall a pending UFA in the later stages of his career, the veteran winger will likely be on the move again. Producing at nearly a point per game across the past two seasons in San Jose, the biggest question for any potential suitor here is fit. As in: Where does Granlund fit on a deeper roster? He’s been the Sharks' top-line center. Still, there isn’t much risk with a rental on an expiring contract who boasts more than 50 games of playoff experience. Granlund is a versatile forward with good vision who not only has a strong track record of power-play production but also kills penalties. The goals have been much harder to come by this season for a guy coming off a career-best 37-goal season, but a look under the hood suggests that Vatrano’s luck should eventually change. He’s still generating more than three shots on goal per game. Vatrano has always had a nose for the net and carries a competitive toolbox that makes him useful no matter where he’s deployed in the lineup. He’s also playing on an affordable, expiring contract. Something might eventually have to give here. The Ducks are demanding more attention to detail from the offensive specialist, and they're getting it, but Zegras is still searching for a way to hang on to the parts of his game that once separated him. Remember that he already has two 60-point campaigns under his belt at age 23. The production has dried up, as has some of the player’s enthusiasm. Jiricek’s introduction to pro hockey has been anything but stable. The No. 6 pick from 2022 has volleyed between the AHL and NHL while struggling to find consistent playing time for two-plus years, and he was just farmed out to AHL Cleveland yet again. As a 6-foot-4 right-shot defenseman, his physical attributes are tantalizing and his potential ceiling is considerable. But he still needs to develop. The Blue Jackets are open to listening on offers to give him a fresh start. The retooling Flyers are short on rental players to take to market in the lead-up to the deadline, but they could probably be compelled to part with the big, physical defenseman if the right deal came along.  Ristolainen plays a rugged style best suited for third-pairing duty. With a contract that stretches two seasons beyond this one, some salary retention might be needed to make a trade work. This is not a player we expected to find on the Big Board, even if he’s currently playing out the final year on his contract. But as a league source noted this week, ""I don't think anyone in Boston thought this is where they'd be at."" If the decision to replace Jim Montgomery with Joe Sacco behind the Bruins bench doesn’t produce the desired results, some difficult personnel decisions will almost certainly follow.  Marchand has had a slow start to the season after a summer during which he underwent multiple surgeries, but he remains a high-end winger who can contribute offensively, kill penalties and, yes, get under an opponent’s skin. You can add his name to the long list of underperforming Bruins, but it’s worth noting that Frederic is only months removed from an 18-goal, 40-point breakout campaign. He’s a big man who skates well and can effectively be deployed as a checker. Boston's not in sell mode yet, but should it reverse course later this season, Frederic would be a valuable trade asset. A rough-and-tumble winger who boasts an impressive fight card, Olivier has caught the attention of at least a couple of NHL teams currently eyeing potential depth forward options. The 27-year-old pending UFA has even managed to chip in more than his share of expected goals early this season.  But what makes him most attractive is his size, strength and willingness to embrace an energy role. Olivier is built for playoff hockey. A shutdown forward who can be trusted in bottom-six duty, Faksa is typically reliable in the faceoff dot and as part of the penalty kill. While he doesn’t bring much offensive pop at even strength, he holds appeal as a rental option who has experienced a couple of long playoff runs in the past. What he lacks in size he makes up in tenacity and feistiness. Gourde is a strong skater and two-way player who owns a couple of Stanley Cup rings from his time with Tampa Bay. His offensive numbers are down to start this season, but he’ll draw attention if Seattle fades from the playoff picture as we get closer to the trade deadline. While certainly not a player the Wild are under pressure to trade, they are facing a decision on Rossi. He’s a pending restricted free agent, and Minnesota needs to determine if it's ready to commit long-term to a diminutive winger with elite offensive instincts and playmaking abilities. Rossi is off to a strong start this season for a Wild team punching above its weight class. He’s a candidate to be included in a player-for-player swap. Off to a reasonably good start for the underperforming Penguins, Rakell has strong finishing ability and can hold his own alongside highly skilled linemates. The challenge in moving him comes in the form of a contract that extends three years beyond this one — albeit at a reasonable price in a rising cap environment. Unless Nashville can pull itself out of a significant hole, Nyquist will become a trade chip of note. He’s coming off a 75-point season at age 34 — the most productive year of his NHL career — and playing on an expiring contract. Nyquist is a talented playmaker who remains a strong skater and isn’t showing any obvious signs of slowing down. A smart right-shot defenseman with good size, Borgen holds appeal as a potential rental. Historically, he’s been a good shot suppressor on the penalty kill — although the results aren’t quite as favorable in that area so far this season. He’s a good skater in the prime of his career. With this season plus one more left on the contract of the left-shot defenseman, the Canadiens are in position to gauge the marketplace and see if anything out there makes sense. Matheson is a strong skater coming off a 62-point season so that added term should theoretically increase the return compared to if they wait another year to make a decision. Another consideration to be weighed is how removing Matheson from the equation might affect the well-stocked pipeline of young defensemen in the Canadiens organization. He’s currently playing more than 24 minutes per night. Nelson is a big, sturdy forward who has scored at a 35-goal pace across the past three seasons. He can be slotted as a second-line center or slide into a wing spot on the top line. As a pending unrestricted free agent, he’s exactly the kind of difference-maker contending teams would be falling over themselves to get their hands on if — and it remains a massive if — the Islanders fade from the playoff picture and choose to move him before the trade deadline. That organization has a healthy track record of keeping its own. Stay tuned. Power forwards with strong playoff resumes don’t grow on trees. Saad’s best days may be behind him, but he still profiles as a complementary winger who can chip in with a little offense and handle a hard game. He’s got one season beyond this one remaining on his contract, but he seems better suited for a Cup-chasing team than the retooling Blues. Traded from Edmonton to San Jose over the summer in a cap-clearing move, it’s hard to imagine the veteran right-shot defenseman finishing out this campaign with the cellar-dwelling Sharks. Not only is he a pending unrestricted free agent, but he’s also shown himself capable of handling the rigors of playoff hockey during three runs with Edmonton. Most notably, he was an important part of the penalty kill that was a massive difference-maker for the Oilers in the spring.  While Ceci has his detractors, his blend of experience and defensive attributes should hold some appeal to teams looking for added depth before the playoffs. Reliable right-shot centers who can fill a depth role always have currency come deadline.  Bjugstad has shown that before — getting traded in 2022 from Arizona to Edmonton in a deal that brought back a third-round pick and defenseman Michael Kesselring — and he’s trending toward being that kind of asset again for Utah HC. He’s reliable play driver who profiles as an ideal bottom-six utilityman. A Big Board mainstay, this may finally be the season Gibson finds his way back to a competitive team. He’s lost the No. 1 job in Anaheim to Lukáš Dostál and is inching ever closer to the end of a contract with two years remaining on it after this one. That’s been the biggest impediment to finding him a new home. While Gibson's numbers in recent seasons don’t jump off the page in a positive way, they should be viewed with the understanding he’s played behind some horrific defensive teams. How the veteran might perform under better conditions is unknown, but it’s potentially a compelling enough possibility for someone to roll the dice. The Sabres certainly aren’t shopping the 23-year-old defenseman, but he may be the piece they have to put in play in order to make a significant shakeup. Byram is an elite skater who can log big minutes and should still have his best and most productive seasons ahead. He’s also due for a new contract after the season as a pending restricted free agent. The Sabres control his rights, but they’re a team with a lot of money and years already tied up in their blue line, so decisions are looming.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Joe Sacco is the Bruins interim head coach. Who’s next if he comes up short?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938123/2024/11/21/bruins-coaching-candidates/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:39:53 GMT",Who could GM Don Sweeney be keeping an eye on while monitoring the team's progress under Sacco? Here's an early look at six candidates.,"NHL BRIGHTON, Mass. — Joe Sacco is in charge. Any resumes that arrive in Don Sweeney’s inbox will not be up for immediate consideration. “I just ruled out that I wasn’t going to go out and do a coaching search right now,” the Boston Bruins general manager said on Wednesday. Sacco is ready for the position. Since 2014, the Medford native has learned under Claude Julien, Bruce Cassidy and Jim Montgomery to optimize himself for the Bruins wheel. Advertisement “Everybody has different personalities and different ways to motivate their teams and individuals,” Sacco said. “You take the good you want to take from certain individuals. But at the end of the day, if you’re not yourself, it doesn’t work.” Sacco is a straight shooter. The 55-year-old’s strength is his experience. While serving his hometown team, the Medford native has specialized in multiple areas, most lately the penalty kill. “He’s basically done everything from being the D coach when I first got here to forward, power play, penalty kill, everything in between,” Charlie McAvoy said. “His experience is vast. Possibly the most important thing is he understands, like a lot of the guys like myself who have been here, what it looks like and what it feels like to be a Bruin — what the standard is every single day and what we’re going to recapture moving forward.” Sacco’s title, however, remains interim head coach. Everyone is under evaluation, from Sweeney to Sacco to every player on the roster. So if Sacco cannot straighten out the team by year’s end, the permanent position does not necessarily belong to him. Who could Sweeney be keeping an eye on while monitoring the team under Sacco? Here’s an early look at six candidates: Sweeney brought Leach back this season as an assistant coach for a reason: He believes in the 45-year-old. Leach spent the past two seasons as an assistant to Dave Hakstol in Seattle. Before that, he was the AHL Providence coach for four seasons. Trent Frederic and Jeremy Swayman played for Leach there. Leach emphasized positivity and growth mindset in Providence. Players who developed into NHLers under Leach, a former defenseman, include Connor Clifton, Jeremy Lauzon and Jakub Zboril. Leach’s familiarity with the organization and his head coaching experience put him atop the list. Advertisement Like Sacco, Leach interviewed for the job that Montgomery won in 2022. Mougenel is in his third season as Providence’s head coach. He was Leach’s assistant before being promoted. He is a high-energy, glass-half-full coach. He has helped Johnny Beecher and Justin Brazeau become full-time Bruins. Georgii Merkulov is hoping to join that category.  Mougenel has yet to turn the same trick with Fabian Lysell, who has one goal in 12 games this year. He is also tasked with helping Matt Poitras return to Boston. The 57-year-old is probably the most high-profile ex-head coach looking for an opportunity. McLellan was most recently behind the Los Angeles Kings bench following stops with the Edmonton Oilers and San Jose Sharks. The Bruins would most likely have to invest term and salary to hire McLellan. Like McLellan, Gallant is waiting for another NHL shot. He deserves it. Gallant had results with the New York Rangers, Vegas Golden Knights and Florida Panthers.  Players have enjoyed working with Gallant.  Pandolfo was a Bruins assistant for five years before leaving to become Boston University’s associate coach in 2021. A year later, after BU fired head coach Albie O’Connell, Pandolfo took over the Terriers. BU lost to Denver, the eventual NCAA champion, in the Frozen Four last year. Whether Pandolfo wants to return to the NHL’s schedule and travel is unknown. Pandolfo is a BU alum. The ex-Bruin and current assistant is close with Brad Marchand, which works in his favor. But Kelly is in charge of the NHL’s worst power play.  Kelly is in his fourth season as an assistant. The 44-year-old does not have head coaching experience.

FIFA approved a proposal in October to give its national associations the option of introducing an “exceptional registration window” to “address technicalities and equalise inconsistencies created by differences in registration periods and domestic-season timings”. Advertisement A statement from the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) said on Thursday: “Taking into account the 2025 edition of the FIFA Club World Cup, at the request of the Lega Serie A and pending the definition of the specific regulation, it was also decided to authorise an additional transfer window from 1 to 10 June 2025.” The window will close five days before the start of the 32-team Club World Cup, which is being held in the United States. Reigning Serie A champions Inter and 36-time Scudetto winners Juventus will represent Italy in the tournament, although every team in Serie A will be able to sign players during the new window. The German, Spanish and English Football Associations have yet to confirm whether they will introudce the same measure. The most recent Premier League summer transfer window ran from June 14 to August 30, beginning 16 days earlier than Serie A, La Liga, Bundesliga and Ligue 1, which all opened for business on June 30. FIFA previously amended global transfer market rules in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic saw the traditional season extended from June into August. The Club World Cup will take place across 12 different stadiums in the U.S., culminating with the final at MetLife Stadium, New Jersey, on July 13.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Maple Leafs 20-game progress reports: Who's thriving? Who's struggling?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936091/2024/11/21/maple-leafs-progress-report-player-analysis/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:30:21 GMT","Twenty games in, the Leafs' record sits at 12-6-2. How's everyone doing? Let's evaluate the roster from top to bottom.","NHL The Toronto Maple Leafs scored maybe their most impressive win all season on Wednesday night, shutting out the Stanley Cup contender Vegas Golden Knights without their best player (Auston Matthews), two other centres (Max Domi and David Kämpf) and two top-nine wingers (Calle Järnkrok and Max Pacioretty). They also lost Matthew Knies to a possible concussion halfway through. Advertisement The victory improved the Leafs’ record to 12-6-2 after 20 games, slightly besting their pace from last season (11-6-3). How’s everyone doing? Twenty games feels like the right time to take a step back and evaluate the roster from top to bottom (in no particular order). Anthony Stolarz: The Leafs are among the league’s best in goals allowed at five-on-five and it’s thanks, in part, to Stolarz. He’s surrendered 12 goals total at five-on-five in his 12 starts, posting a toasty .955 save percentage. Overall, Stolarz has stopped 10 goals more than expected. Matthew Knies: The sophomore leap is happening. Knies is on pace for over 30 goals. He’s been chowing down on shots around the opposition net. He was averaging around 18.5 minutes per game before his injury against the Golden Knights, playing roles on both special team units, including an unexpected gig on PP1. Knies has also drawn a team-leading eight penalties. The Leafs have to hope he isn’t gone long. Chris Tanev: I think there’s a case to be made that he’s been the Leafs’ MVP to this point — or right there with Stolarz and maybe William Nylander and Mitch Marner. Tanev is arguably the biggest driver of the Leafs’ tidier defensive performance this season. Though he plays the hardest minutes on the team, the Leafs are giving up a mere 1.8 expected goals per 60 minutes at five-on-five with Tanev on the ice. That’s one of the top marks for any NHL defender this season. The penalty kill has also leapt from bad last season to the top 10 thanks largely to Tanev. He’s on pace to block almost 300 shots this season. Jake McCabe: Nobody plays more these days for the Leafs than McCabe. He’s averaging a team-best (and career high) of nearly 22 minutes per game. McCabe has teamed up with Tanev on what’s quickly become a dominant defensive pair. He may be playing the best hockey of his career at age 31. Advertisement Conor Timmins: Timmins’ strong first impression on Craig Berube led, at least in part, to Timothy Liljegren’s exit from the Leafs. How good has he actually been? Has he been better than last season even? I’m not so sure (his PDO of 105.7 trails only John Tavares among Leafs). But the fact he’s playing every night — minus just two games as a scratch — exceeds expectations. Steven Lorentz: The most reliable (maybe the only reliable) bottom-six forward all season. Lorentz has chipped in a bit offensively (three goals), played physically, blocked shots and killed penalties. He doesn’t play a lot, just under 11 minutes per game, but he has the trust of his coach. He’s already played all three forward positions this season. William Nylander: He’s been the most reliable goal-scoring threat for a team that’s struggled to score at times this season, leading the team with 13 goals and helping to fill a (massive) void on that front left by the injured Matthews. Morgan Rielly: Yet again, the ‘who plays with Rielly?’ question has become a thing. Twenty games into the season, Rielly has already had three different partners — Tanev, Oliver Ekman-Larsson and Jani Hakanpää. It’s been a little messy at times defensively and Rielly’s minutes have been scaled back quite a bit to right around 21 minutes a night. Yet, Rielly has been the most (only?) consistent source of offence from the Leaf defence, leading the group with four goals and 13 points. John Tavares: Marner has gotten most of the credit for stepping up in Matthews’ absence. Tavares is probably due some credit himself. He’s taken over the No. 1 centre duties in recent weeks, which has meant playing increasingly big and difficult minutes. He spent most of Game No. 20 matched up against Jack Eichel. He’s on pace for almost 40 goals, punching in some big ones so far with three game winners already, including the overtime goal in Washington last week. Following a 65-point season last year, Tavares is, so far, putting up a point per game in his age-34 season. Mitch Marner: He’s on pace for his first 100-point season — and hasn’t even gotten going yet at five-on-five. Marner has multi-point outings in all six of the Leafs’ wins (in seven games) without Matthews. He’s been increasingly excellent on the defensive side. Oliver Ekman-Larsson: Steady is maybe the best way to describe his season so far. The most surprising part may be the physicality: Ekman-Larsson has thrown 31 hits, third among Leaf defenders so far. His general calmness and confidence moving the puck have helped the Leafs, and he’s added the odd bit of offence beyond Rielly back there, chipping in with one goal and eight points. He has taken a team-high 10 penalties. Advertisement Bobby McMann: He’s scored, skated hard, played physically and looked the part of an NHL power forward. But it’s come in waves; a lot at once and then not very much at all. McMann needs more consistency. Joseph Woll: After his first shutout of the year on Wednesday, Woll is suddenly up to a .922 save percentage in six starts this season. A late start because of injury, coupled with Stolarz’s stellar play, has him in the No. 2 chair right now. That can change if Woll can start stringing some quality starts together. He’s won his last three outings. Max Domi: The first season of Domi’s four-year contract with the Leafs wasn’t going well before an injury knocked him out of the lineup entirely. Domi didn’t score in his first 19 games and had gone the last 13 games without a point. He’s been hurt as much as anyone by the non-existence of a rush attack under Berube. His nine minor penalties are second-most among Leafs. David Kämpf: He was beginning to worm his way into Berube’s Circle of Trust before he became too felled by injury. His penalty-kill duties had increased and Berube was beginning to turn his way for more defensive zone draws. The offence, which was limited to begin with, has completely disappeared, though. Kämpf, who had only one goal less than Domi last year (eight), hasn’t scored this season and has mustered only three assists. Pontus Holmberg: Berube continues to be a believer, even as Holmberg struggles to make an impact. There was hope he could do Kämpf-like things, with more offence, but that hasn’t materialized. Holmberg is averaging less than a shot per game and scored for the first time all season into an empty net on Wednesday night. Ryan Reaves: It hasn’t gone anywhere near as poorly as last fall when the puck kept entering the Leafs net any time he was on the ice, but Reaves’ minutes still weren’t amounting to much before he got suspended for his hit on Darnell Nurse. He had no goals, one assist and only seven shots in 16 games. The puck hasn’t gone in much either way when he’s been out there: two goals for the Leafs, three for the opposition. Nick Robertson: The opportunity has been there for him to carve out a more substantial role, and the Leafs have been desperate for middle-six offence. It just hasn’t happened. Robertson’s lone goal (and point) this season came in the third period of a blowout loss in Columbus. Advertisement Simon Benoit: Not having McCabe by his side sure seems to have hurt Benoit this season, the first of a three-year contract ($1.35 million cap hit). A seat in the press box seemed to spark something in the 26-year-old: He registered a season-high eight hits in his return to the lineup against Vegas. Auston Matthews: Though he wasn’t scoring or defending like usual, it speaks to Matthews’ greatness that the Leafs were still winning his minutes handily at five-on-five. He was also faring well in a major role on the penalty kill. Max Pacioretty: Things were trending up for Pacioretty before he suffered an apparent hamstring injury. He had found a comfy fit next to Nylander and Tavares and was giving the Leafs a much-needed combination of wily offence and physicality. The Leafs need that back whenever he returns. Fraser Minten: He scored his first NHL goal in his season debut on Wednesday. Berube also had him chipping in a little on the penalty kill and gave him a spot on PP1 after Knies was injured. He played almost 16 minutes and won four of his seven draws. With all the injuries at centre, the 20-year-old will get a decent look here in the next week or so to demonstrate whether he’s ready to stick. Connor Dewar: Wednesday was only his fourth game back from offseason shoulder surgery, and first at centre. Jani Hakanpää: It remains to be seen if he can move around well enough after the injuries to play a role for the Leafs. He was a first-time healthy scratch on Wednesday night. Calle Järnkrok: A sneaky-important loss, it remains to be seen when, or if, he’ll play this season after groin and sports hernia surgery. Alex Steeves: There’s opportunity there for him to prove he’s an NHL player. Nikita Grebenkin: He was rambunctious in his NHL debut against Vegas. The fearlessness and physicality, in particular, popped. Advertisement Dennis Hildeby: His first two NHL starts were a mixed bag — one good (a 23-save win in New Jersey), one not so good (six goals against in a loss to Columbus). Philippe Myers: A depth signing, Myers has played only one game all season. — Stats and research courtesy of Natural Stat Trick, Hockey Reference and Evolving Hockey (Top photo of William Nylander: John E.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Colorado lands 5-star QB Julian Lewis: What this means for Deion Sanders,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5915821/2024/11/21/colorado-recruiting-deion-sanders-julian-lewis-qb/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:13:52 GMT","Lewis, the No. 35 overall prospect in the Class of 2025 in the 247Sports Composite, had previously been committed to USC.","NCAAF Five-star quarterback Julian “Juju” Lewis committed to Colorado on Thursday. Lewis, the No. 35 overall prospect in the Class of 2025 in the 247Sports Composite, had been committed to USC for more than a year but backed off that pledge on Nov. 17. He visited Colorado last month for the Buffaloes’ win over Cincinnati and took a surprise visit to Georgia last weekend and watched the Bulldogs top Tennessee. He announced his decision on the “Pat McAfee Show.” Advertisement Lewis plays at Carrollton High School, about 50 miles west of Atlanta. His team is 11-0 and will play Valdosta in a state playoff game on Friday night. For the season, Lewis is 200-for-257 passing for 2,842 yards with 40 touchdowns and four interceptions. He is completing 77.8 percent of his passes, a career high and 10 percentage points higher than last season. Colorado doesn’t have an experienced backup quarterback or a plan at the position beyond Shedeur Sanders, who will enter the NFL Draft after this season. Now, Colorado has a plan beyond the next few months, and Lewis would likely be a Day 1 starter in Boulder. It’s also evidence in favor of Deion Sanders staying at Colorado after his sons (Shedeur and Shilo) and Travis Hunter leave. It’s the biggest recruiting win for Sanders since flipping Hunter from Florida State to Jackson State during the early signing period in December 2021. It’s hard to think the on-field fortunes of both teams didn’t have an impact. USC (5-5) has lost four of its last five games and the trajectory for Lincoln Riley’s program has never been worse. The Trojans need to rally just to reach a bowl game. Colorado, meanwhile, has played its way into Big 12 title contention and the College Football Playoff picture with six wins in seven games. Sanders’ stock hasn’t been higher since the Buffaloes’ 3-0 start in 2023 against a trio of teams that ended up missing bowl games. It’s not hard to sell the idea that Lewis could be the key piece in program-building for Sanders moving forward while Riley’s future in a USC program at transition looks far less rosy. — Ubben While Lewis had been committed to USC for nearly a year and a half, he hadn’t shunned interest from other programs. In the spring, he visited some SEC schools as well as Indiana and Colorado. The SEC schools found other quarterbacks, but the Hoosiers and Buffaloes remained persistent. Even though Lewis did visit USC, the fact that he never publicly reaffirmed his commitment to the Trojans and visited other programs certainly raised questions. It basically made the separation inevitable. And USC obviously was not caught off guard. The staff stayed in contact with Husan Longstreet and made a strong — and ultimately successful — push to flip the five-star prospect from his Texas A&M commitment. — Morales (Photo: John David Mercer / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How Josh Metellus became the key to Brian Flores' innovative Vikings defense,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936476/2024/11/21/josh-metellus-vikings-defense-brian-flores/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:01:38 GMT","The versatile 26-year-old is listed as a safety, but he has also lined up at linebacker, slot corner and even on the defensive line.","NFL He wears the perfect number: 44. What type of football player typically wears 44? It feels too high for a safety but too low for a defensive lineman. Linebackers don’t always wear 44. Neither do cornerbacks. If you were to select one position on the football field for the number, it’d probably be a fullback. One of those helmet-smashing, spirit-lifting, lines-up-everywhere types of players. At his core, that’s who Joshua Metellus is for the Minnesota Vikings. Advertisement “Shoot, man,” cornerback Byron Murphy Jr. said recently. “Josh can seriously play every position we have.” That’s not hyperbole. This season, Metellus has played about 40 percent of his snaps at linebacker, 30 percent at slot corner and 16 percent at safety. The rest of the time, he has lined up on the defensive line or out wide against elite receivers. Simply calling Metellus versatile does not do him justice. Next Gen Stats has been around since 2018, and Metellus’ undertaking transcends any role any defender has played since then. He’s one of the NFL’s best pass rushers and run stoppers from the slot. He runs stunts at the line of scrimmage. He plays man coverage against tight ends. He deflects passes, jars the ball loose from ball carriers, blitzes off the edge and drops into underneath zones. This is not a player multitasking just to say he can do it. And defensive coordinator Brian Flores is not asking Metellus to play these different roles simply to say he has a defender who can do it. It is a capable player working with an attentive coach who grasps his potential and is creative enough to construct a role that makes use of that player’s full skill set. Metellus’ football story is as much about the people around him as anything else, an example of what can happen when the right people recognize your biggest attributes. There's not a position @NoExcuses_23 can't play. pic.twitter.com/b76Lyh9u23 — Minnesota Vikings (@Vikings) November 12, 2024  Every coach says he wants to put his players in the best positions to be successful. It’s a lovely thought, but what does that entail? Ask Flores’ opinion, and he’ll say it’s a lot of trial and error. Put a player in a spot or have him move around a certain part of the field. Then watch him. Don’t worry about whether or not he can do it. Worry about whether or not he can do it well. Advertisement “I try to push the limits with players and see how much they can handle,” Flores said. “Normally, we have to pull back a little bit.” Sometimes a player’s size and speed prohibit him from excelling at the task. Other times, the player cannot conceptualize multiple responsibilities at once. Metellus, who was drafted out of Michigan in 2020 and primarily played special teams during his first three seasons in Minnesota, stands 5-foot-11 and weighs 207 pounds. Light enough to cover, but strong enough to play in the box. He also understood Flores’ concepts immediately. Last spring, early in Flores’ time with the Vikings, the coach asked himself to identify the best 11 defensive players. Metellus was one of them. Flores believed the onus fell on him to figure out how to get those 11 players on the field and then decipher who would play where. In one personnel grouping, Flores assigned Metellus to slot corner. In another, Flores positioned Metellus at linebacker. Metellus was shocked when he entered Flores’ office and was told of the coach’s vision for him — not because he didn’t think he could do it, but because he’d found another coach willing to see what he saw in himself. We got all the contacts in our phones 📱 pic.twitter.com/QCwQdnWG5I — Minnesota Vikings (@Vikings) November 12, 2024  Almost a decade earlier, Devin Bush Sr., an NFL safety for the Falcons, Rams and Browns from 1995 to 2002, arrived at a turf field near Miami to watch a seven-on-seven game. Bush was a coach at Flanagan High School in Pembroke Pines, Fla., a suburb north of Miami. That day, with the heat climbing to an uncomfortable level, he could not take his eyes off one of the running backs. It turned out to be Metellus, whom Bush met afterward, and who would ultimately play for him at Flanagan. Bush moved him to safety, but really, Metellus became so much more. He ranged from deep and tackled ball carriers. He lined up across from slot receivers and snatched tipped passes out of the air for interceptions. He did so much of what he was doing now, observing offensive formations, hand-signaling checks at the line of scrimmage, celebrating audibly when the defense excelled. Advertisement Somehow, recruiting websites categorized him as a three-star recruit. “Writers were hyping other people up, and not seeing the skill set,” Bush said. Metellus’ top offers came from South Alabama, Florida International and Middle Tennessee State — until a camp one afternoon at the nearby Dolphins facility. Bush was on the sideline when another former NFL safety, Greg Jackson, then the defensive backs coach at Michigan, approached. “Who is this, Bush?” “Josh Metellus,” he replied. “Look at his movement skills,” Jackson said, “how he can stay square when he’s pedaling.” Bush nodded slowly the way you do when you already know something you’re being told. “I should offer him,” Jackson said. “You won’t regret it,” Bush replied. GO DEEPER Vikings' middling run game makes it abundantly clear — they need help on the interior OL Metellus played as a freshman at Michigan, then replaced current New England Patriots defender Jabrill Peppers at the Wolverines’ “viper” position, a do-it-all spot requiring a player who could understand, communicate and apply a breadth of ideas with 107,000 people hollering their lungs out in Ann Arbor. Two All-Big Ten selections later, the Vikings drafted Metellus for Mike Zimmer’s innovative defensive system. Metellus was mostly stuck on special teams for his first couple of seasons, but in 2022, the Vikings hired Ed Donatell as their defensive coordinator. That system prioritized putting players in specific positions with specific tasks: You start here, and you do X based on Y. Donatell included Metellus in a third-down package, and he filled in admirably for safety Harrison Smith when the veteran missed a game due to a concussion. The next season, Flores’ arrival and open-mindedness altered Metellus’ trajectory. But Flores said his ideas would be worth nothing without Metellus’ retention. “With Josh, pulling back (on the complexity) was not the problem,” Flores said. “We had to add more.” .@horribleharry99: Josh, I need an INT@noexcuses_23: I got you 📺: https://t.co/jqOKdIvMuj pic.twitter.com/ds12XSyCiU — Minnesota Vikings (@Vikings) September 20, 2024  Metellus’ understanding of what the Vikings defense is trying to do has countless benefits beyond the flexibility and interchangeable game planning he allows Flores. Metellus can fill in everywhere in the event of an injury to a starter, limiting the level of drop-off. If a young defender like Dwight McGlothern has questions, he can ask Metellus, who has the acumen to explain the ideas simply. Advertisement There is a reason Metellus, still just 26, is the man in the middle of the team-wide pregame huddle each Sunday, revving up his teammates with a speech. They respect his willingness to apply his services wherever they’re needed. They know the years he spent waiting for a role and a time like this, a time Vikings fans are wearing his No. 44 jersey in droves because of the impact he always knew he could make. “Josh is as valuable a player on the roster as we have,” Flores said.

""He deserves that. We think the world of him.""","NBA This will be Hubie Brown’s last year broadcasting games for ESPN. ESPN President Burke Magnus revealed the news Thursday while on the Sports Illustrated Media Podcast with Jimmy Traina. “We are going to give Hubie one last shot on a game,” Magnus said. “He deserves that. We think the world of him. I think it is absolutely remarkable the level in which he still calls games at age 90-plus. I don’t mean to be purposely mysterious here but we are going to honor Hubie during the regular season at some point to be determined and send him off in style.” Advertisement ESPN declined additional comment Thursday to The Athletic. Brown is not scheduled to call any games but industry sources said he will be assigned one last game this season. The date of the assignment has not been formalized yet. Brown is expected to partner with longtime ESPN/ABC play-by-play broadcaster Mike Breen for the game. Brown, who turned 91 in September, has had one of the most extraordinary careers in basketball. He coached Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson, coached against Kobe Bryant and LeBron James, and called games featuring Giannis Antetokounmpo and Victor Wembanyama. Brown got his start in broadcasting during the 1981-82 season when he teamed up with Al Albert on the USA Network after he was fired as head coach of the Atlanta Hawks. There were coaching returns along the way (five years with the New York Knicks, from 1982-87, and three with the Memphis Grizzlies, from 2002-05), but Brown has essentially been a soundtrack for the NBA for five decades. When the Knicks fired Brown in 1987, he became a full-time analyst for CBS and then moved over to TNT in 1990 when CBS lost NBA broadcasting rights. “I don’t think I’m 90 years old,” Brown told The Athletic last year when we named him Media Person of The Year. “I never get up in the morning and say, ‘Geez, I’m 90 years old. What am I going to do today?’ I’m 90 years old, and I come downstairs and I get my manila pad out, and I have a list of all the things I’m going to do today. Then, at night, I have a list of which games I’m going to watch. Then, during the games, I’m going to pick out certain things I’m interested in. It’s always the love of the game for me.” Dave Pasch, one of the many play-by-play broadcasters Brown has worked with over the years, said Brown never lost his passion for calling games. Advertisement “He does two things during commercial breaks that obviously the audience isn’t privy to,” Pasch said. “First, he regularly asks me if I am getting enough time to call the game, how things sound and if we are working in tandem. Hubie is an incredible teammate. We spend a decent amount of time together off the air and normally have dinner the night before the game. He treats me like I am part of his family, and that comes through in our communication on game day. The second thing Hubie does is point out important stats on the box score that stand out to him. It helps me as his broadcast partner because it gives me a sense of what is important to him, where to lead him, or to reemphasize later in the broadcast.” Brown had worked about 15 games each season between 2020 and 2023 for ESPN/ABC. He worked mostly on one-year contracts as ESPN kept extending him. (Photo: Mitchell Leff / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Sign up here to receive The Windup directly in your inbox. It’s awards week! Plus: The trades have begun, follow-ups on our stories from Monday and Ken fills us in on the Dodgers’ interest in Willy Adames. I’m Levi Weaver, here with Ken Rosenthal. Welcome to The Windup! It’s all official except for MVP (which … it’s not like any surprises await us tonight, which will be Ohtani/Judge night). Here’s a catch-up on the BBWAA awards so far): More BBWAA awards: Andrew Baggarly makes a convincing argument for adding a new “Reliever of the Year” award. From my latest notes column: The Los Angeles Dodgers’ decision to return Mookie Betts to the infield prompted immediate speculation about the team signing free-agent shortstop Willy Adames and trading second baseman Gavin Lux. That, however, isn’t necessarily the team’s plan. Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman has long admired Adames, whom he acquired for the Tampa Bay Rays at the 2014 trade deadline as part of a package for David Price. But Friedman rarely pays sticker price for elite talent, with Yoshinobu Yamamoto standing as a notable exception last offseason, in part because he was turning 25. Lest anyone forget, the Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman contracts all include significant deferrals. Advertisement With Ha-Seong Kim recovering from shoulder surgery, Adames is by far the top shortstop in this year’s market. The demand for him at 29 should be high, and while Adames might not be as coveted as other recent free-agent shortstops, he surely expects a significant contract. And the decline in his defensive metrics last season raises the possibility that he might not be at short for the duration of his agreement. Lux, who turns 27 Friday, is a former first-round pick to whom the Dodgers remained loyal even as he struggled coming off major knee surgery in the first half of last season. He responded with an .899 OPS after the All-Star break. His 2.0 fWAR in that period was equal to that of Matt Olson and Brent Rooker, and better than that of teammate Teoscar Hernández and free-agent third baseman Alex Bregman. And Lux remains affordable, projecting to earn less than $3 million in arbitration. Of course, if Lux remains the primary second baseman, then Betts likely will return to shortstop, with Tommy Edman in center and Miguel Rojas serving in a utility role. Betts was below-average defensively at short last season, but most of his issues stemmed from his throwing, which he might be able to solve with a full offseason and spring training. Another possibility is for the Dodgers to indeed trade Lux, play Betts at second, Tommy Edman at short and a combination of Andy Pages and James Outman in center. The bottom line: Friedman does not need to lock into Adames when his greater needs are in the outfield and rotation. Friedman relishes keeping his options open. And as usual, he has numerous ways he can go. More here. It’s not as frenetic as the end of July, but as the holidays (and Winter Meetings) bear down, we’ve had a few trades of note this week. There have been a few developments in some of the stories we told you about on Monday, so here’s a quick rundown: Roki Sasaki will be part of the 2025 international class. Commissioner Rob Manfred confirmed this yesterday, which tracks with what we told you: A bit more money will be available if teams wait until Jan. 15. But as Ken points out, it’s not like that money is coming from nowhere. Whichever team signs Sasaki will be doing so by backing out of agreements (technically unofficial, since they’re illegal) with other international free agents. The system is clearly broken, and it’s long past time to fix it. Advertisement Rays stadium deal in peril: Sam Blum has written a more thorough story on all the factors surrounding the now-tenuous deal for a new stadium for the Rays in St. Petersburg. However it’s going to work out, it needs to be soon-ish: Manfred said this week that he expects them to have a solution in place by around this time next year. (Manfred also said that this situation does not change the league’s desire to expand in the next four years.) MLB plans new national TV packages for 2028: In light of the recently finalized plan for Diamond Sports to emerge from bankruptcy, Manfred said on Tuesday that the league has a goal in mind: to have a new national TV package ready to go by 2028, so they can sell a blackout-free package — whether that be via the MLB’s own streaming service or to a streaming distributor. What’s standing in the way? Goodness, it’s a cornucopia of complication, ranging from existing contracts to the CBA. Fortunately, Evan Drellich is on the case. Juan Soto’s free-agent roundtable continues: The Dodgers are the latest to meet with agent Scott Boras, joining the Blue Jays, Red Sox, Mets and Yankees. Jim Bowden takes a crack at predicting where Soto will end up. Wanna vote on the Hall of Fame? It’s not an official ballot, but you can cast yours anyway in our reader survey.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Sabres mailbag: Will Kevyn Adams make a significant trade? Does Trevor Zegras fit?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5937714/2024/11/21/sabres-trade-trevor-zegras-maiblag/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 16:00:39 GMT","There are still a lot of big-picture questions with the Sabres, and we’re going to explore some of those here.","NHL The Buffalo Sabres started their California road trip with a 1-0 win over the Los Angeles Kings on Wednesday night. They got the win without Tage Thompson, who has now missed three games with a lower-body injury. But Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen was back in net after missing two games with an injury, and he was Buffalo’s most important player. He stopped all 24 shots he faced, and 10 of those shots were high-danger shots, according to Natural Stat Trick. Advertisement Luukkonen helped the Sabres steal two points and get back to a .500 points percentage with a 9-9-1 record. The Sabres now have the fourth best points percentage in the Atlantic Division and are tied for the eighth best points percentage in the Eastern Conference. So far this season, the Sabres are 0-4 in games when they have a chance to get above .500. A back-to-back against the Ducks and Sharks on Friday and Saturday should present a prime opportunity to get over .500 for the first time this season There are still a lot of big-picture questions with this team, and we’re going to explore some of those in this mailbag. I’ll add some of the leftover questions into future columns as well. Note: Submitted questions may be edited for clarity and style. I think many of us are disappointed in Dahlin’s play this year. So many defensive lapses and silly plays. As someone much closer to the players than we are, is the sense that his dip is due to the stress of having the “C” on his sweater, the change in strategy with Ruff or the randomness of life and he’s going to return to his near-Norris level of ability? — Eric J. Rasmus Dahlin is back to creating offense for the Sabres, an aspect of his game that was missing while he worked his way back from injury early in the season. He has a seven-game point streak and 17 points in 19 games. But the mental mistakes, whether it’s lack of composure leading to penalties or missed assignments in the defensive zone, have been glaring. Dahlin cares a lot about making this team a winner. Sometimes too much. He’s easily frustrated, which has led to penalties. And he puts a ton of pressure on himself. So I do think he’s been adjusting to the added pressure of having the “C” on his jersey. The change in system and his training camp injury didn’t help. I don’t know how Ruff can get through to him about keeping his composure and not taking penalties. That feels like something Dahlin will either learn in time or will be a struggle throughout his career. If he can figure it out, he could reach his Norris-caliber ceiling. Advertisement If Lindy cannot get the most out of Owen Power, what’s next? — Charles P. Owen Power turns 22 on Friday, so it’s still early to hit the panic button on him. But some of the concerns are valid. The good news is he has 13 points in 19 games. The bad news is he’s been inconsistent, especially defensively, and still hasn’t evolved into a player who can effectively use his size to consistently out-muscle opponents in front of his team’s net. Hockey Stat Cards tracks players’ game scores throughout the season based on Dom’s model. Power has two of the Sabres’ three worst individual games this season but also has the team’s best game. That feels like it sums up Power’s season. He can be a good defender without laying huge hits all the time. But he needs to play stronger in 50-50 puck battles and in clearing the front of the net. Otherwise, he won’t be an $8.3 million defenseman. Power obviously would still hold a lot of trade value around the league as a recent No. 1 pick and the type of puck-moving defenseman teams like to build around. He has the potential to be a No. 1 power play quarterback, but he doesn’t have a path to that job in Buffalo. If general manager Kevyn Adams wanted to shake up this roster in a major way, Power would be one of the team’s most valuable trade chips. I just think the team would prefer Ruff to help him reach his full potential. If he hits his ceiling, Power can become one of those players that’s not easy to acquire. Cozens for Zegras: who says no? — Bob O. I think the Sabres would still say no on that one. The internal belief in Dylan Cozens as a two-way center is still strong. He’s been playing better since a slow start, though the production is still lagging behind where it should be. That said, I would have plenty of interest in a Trevor Zegras trade. When I watch him, I still see a player with a ton of ability to drive offense. He clearly doesn’t have the same spark he did a few seasons ago, but that’s why his name is even being thrown around in trade rumors. He can play both center and wing and has a reasonable contract at $5.75 million for one more season after this one before he becomes a restricted free agent. He also doesn’t have a no-trade clause. Would he be thrilled about playing in Buffalo? Who knows? But he is from the East Coast and Sabres assistant Seth Appert coached him with USA Hockey. If Zegras is truly available, it’s the type of calculated risk Adams should be willing to take at this stage of Buffalo’s build. He’s 23 and only two years removed from back-to-back 60-point seasons. How much confidence do you have in Kevyn Adams making a significant move(s) to improve this team before it’s too late? — Tom T. Adams has been willing to trade in recent years, so I’m confident something will happen at some point. The question is how significant a move he makes. I would categorize the Casey Mittelstadt for Bowen Byram trade as a significant move, although it was one that also resulted in a major subtraction from the forward group. The Ryan McLeod trade was significant given Matt Savoie’s status as a top-10 pick, and McLeod has made a strong impact. So has Jason Zucker, a summer free-agent signing who has four goals and nine assists in 19 games including the game-winner against the Kings on Wednesday. But it feels like this team still needs a top-six forward and a playing partner for Power. Those are needs that would have been better addressed at some point in the last two seasons. But there are still options if Adams wants to upgrade this roster. The team is sitting on $7.2 million in cap space. No other team in the Eastern Conference playoff race has close to that much money to spend. Adams also has more prospects and picks to trade than most teams. There isn’t much of an excuse to not make an addition to this roster at some point. And it’s clear that more upgrades are needed. This does lead us to our next question, though. Why does Kevyn Adams still have a job? They’re not tracking for a playoff position, so the worst possible scenario looms: no longer concerned with “winning the Stanley Cup”, but instead worrying solely about keeping his job next year, this horribly failing GM goes all-in at the trade deadline and destroys whatever’s left of the prospect pool and future draft picks in a useless and utterly improbable “heroic run for the eighth seed” that will of course fall short. Why is Pegula even risking this? Why not fire him now before he goes scorched Earth and leaves nothing for the next GM? — Matthew D. Given how long it took Terry Pegula to fire Don Granato, I’m not sure whether he would be willing to fire Adams in season. The Sabres are still flirting with playoff contention and as long as that’s true, Pegula won’t make changes. But your point is a fair one. A lot of questions in the mailbag were about trades and what could be done to shake up this roster. Pegula now has Ruff, someone he trusts and considers a friend, to give a sober, honest look at the state of the team. Is a major roster shake-up justified? Which core players should be moved? Those are questions he can now ask Ruff. If they decide to go in the direction of a significant shake-up, the next question Pegula should ask is whether Adams should be the one executing those trades. His track record is mixed at best. The Jack Eichel trade doesn’t look great. Neither does the Sam Reinhart deal. The Sabres need to be careful about pressing the panic button and making a desperate trade. I wouldn’t worry too much about that at this point, though. I don’t think it’s in Adams’ nature to go scorched earth. He cares about this team, the players and the city. He also wants to do right by Pegula, who has put a lot of faith in him over the last five years. But desperation can cloud the decision-making process, and that’s something Adams needs to be careful about. We’ve read reports that Adams is trying to put a big trade together to overhaul this roster. At this point, I don’t see any “untouchables” on this roster or in this organization. Do you? — Ralph S. In the right deal, anyone on the Sabres’ roster should be available. This core hasn’t won anything, so Adams should be open to anything. That said, the closest two players to untouchable are Thompson and Dahlin. Thompson has a reasonable contract and has shown star potential. He’s Buffalo’s best player, so any trade would have to be a no-brainer. Dahlin has been inconsistent, but we’ve also seen how good he can be at his best. You need stars to win, and Dahlin has that potential. He’s got a long-term contract and is the captain of the team. Advertisement Beyond those two, I’d be open to the idea of the Sabres moving just about any player on the roster. Players like JJ Peterka and Zach Benson would be close to that untouchable tier. But until this core proves it can win, you have to at least listen to the offers to understand the market value of your players. If the Sabres don’t make the playoffs, which odds favor, what’s Lindy’s future? I can’t imagine Terry Pegula wants to pay another coach who isn’t behind the bench. Does he transition to a front-office role, asked to “retire,” etc? Seriously do not know where this franchise goes from here if they need to blow things up again. — Austin Z. I don’t think Pegula would consider firing Ruff after just one season even if they miss the playoffs. Given the patience he showed with previous coaches, he owes some patience to Ruff, who is working with a roster he only recently had a hand in building and trying to break young players of poor habits. If they miss the playoffs, it’s not a coaching issue. But the question about what happens if Pegula does decide changes are necessary is a prudent one. The Sabres appear to be grooming Seth Appert to be Ruff’s heir apparent one day. He’s filled in for Ruff in some media availabilities, something no assistants did under Granato. But it feels like any transition would be contingent on Adams still being the one who makes decisions. If Ruff has the appetite for it, a transition to the front office would suit him given the strong relationships he has around the league and his eye for talent. If the Sabres don’t make the playoffs, none of the potential solutions are clean or simple. But it would be tough to justify the status quo. That doesn’t mean they need to blow things up again, but letting Adams have a sixth season wouldn’t sit well with a fan base that has already become fed up with waiting for postseason hockey. Hence the pressure on Adams to get this season right. (Photo of Alex Tuch and Trevor Zegras: Bill Wippert / NHLI via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Sign up here to receive it directly in your inbox. Good morning. Today, we’re talking QB improvement, something that has long eluded the Bears (but perhaps not for much longer, with Thomas Brown as OC, as Kevin Fishbain explains here). The Athletic’s Jeff Howe is the master of quarterback rankings. With Russell Wilson and Sam Darnold ending 2023 on the bench, we all agreed with Jeff’s Week 1 stock report, which ranked both veterans among the league’s worst QBs. Along came a 2024 revival. After four starts, Darnold was 4-0 and 13th in Jeff’s rankings. He’s now 18th, one spot behind Wilson, who is a similar 4-0 across his first four starts. Advertisement The parallels continue. Both are backed by top-10 defenses that ease the pressure on the offense. And both are working with offensive coordinators who maximize strengths. They also each have a just-throw-it-up No. 1 receiver. Justin Jefferson in Minnesota and George Pickens in Pittsburgh respectively rank second and fourth in receiving yards this season. There’s room for error. Wilson and Darnold are also on one-year contracts, suggesting they’ll headline the 2025 free agent quarterback class. The obvious question lingers: Are Wilson and Darnold better quarterbacks than they had been lately, or just in better situations? Let’s quickly look at both, comparing this season with their two most recent previous years in which they started 10-plus games. By most objective measures, the 35-year-old is a similar player to 2023 (when he wasn’t bad in Denver!). His QBR, passer rating, completion percentage and adjusted net yards per pass attempt all resemble his time there.  The tape shows Pittsburgh’s run-first, play-action offense looks similar to Wilson’s early years in Seattle and is perfectly suited to his strengths, including his patented moonball. But it’s not all positive. In his four starts, the Steelers have produced a touchdown on only 38.9 percent of their red zone opportunities. As Mike DeFabo notes in his look into why Pittsburgh is struggling there, Wilson has completed 68 percent of his passes outside the red zone, but that figure drops to 29.2 percent inside the 20. (Perhaps that’s where Justin Fields comes in? We’ll see tonight, when the Steelers visit the Browns at 8:15 p.m. ET on Amazon Prime.) Even if Wilson fails to improve near the goal line, in his 13th season, he is an effective starter. That’s probably it, but it’s all Pittsburgh’s defense (and kicker) need. As Jeff wrote, “They’re putting him in good situations and not asking him to play beyond his means, which is exactly how it should be.” Advertisement Darnold doesn’t have Wilson’s career accolades, but the 27-year-old has the pedigree of a former No. 3 overall pick, which is one reason he’s continued to get chances despite seeing ghosts. Objectively, his last two years as a full-time starter (2020-2021) were nowhere near his impressive 2024. His numbers have all significantly improved:  This isn’t a case where the numbers fail to align with what Darnold looks like in action. You’d be hard pressed to find any stretch from 2018 to 2022 when he looked this confident throwing the football. But after a stretch that evoked years past — five interceptions in Weeks 9 and 10 — his penchant for turnovers (10 INTs, fourth-most) remains a glaring flaw. He’s become a better version of Sam Darnold, which is good for a league-average QBR (and an 8-2 record, thanks to an elite supporting cast). It’s reasonable to assume Darnold’s arm talent and athleticism, along with his 2024 team’s win-loss record, will intrigue some of the 12 teams with potential QB openings in 2025. Many will be deciding between Darnold, Wilson and prospects like Shedeur Sanders and Cam Ward. But those teams should remember: Even a QB with Wilson’s resume still needs the right surroundings. Bears fans, for once, there is good news: The change at offensive coordinator, with Thomas Brown replacing Shane Waldron, has given this team a boost. In Brown’s first game as a play-caller, last weekend’s nail-biter loss to Green Bay, Caleb Williams completed 74 percent of his passes, a more than 20 percentage point increase over his three previous games. One of the most significant changes has been improved communication during the game, particularly when it comes to the speed at which plays are called. The 4-6 Bears haven’t resolved all their issues, but believe they are better on offense. As Williams put it: “We’re going to have that mindset to go out there and kick some tail.” Chicago will need that mindset, with the 8-2 Vikings on Sunday and 9-1 Lions days later on Thanksgiving. 🎧 ICYMI from the “Scoop City” podcast: Are the Giants trying to tank? When Sean Payton announced his Week 1 starter, we learned that Bo Nix was set to become the first rookie QB to start for the Broncos since John Elway. It only added to the expectations for this year’s No. 12 pick, but he’s exceeded them all. As we enter Week 12, Nix has played an equal amount of games as Elway — a first overall pick — did in his rookie year (11), giving us a level playing field to compare the two. (Of course, we must factor in the differing play style in 1983 and the fact that Elway often split games with Steve DeBerg.) A blind sample of the stats would suggest we’re looking at one future superstar and one struggling rookie:  Obviously, that goes to show: A lot can and will change. Still, great start. Success wasn’t immediate for Nix, however. His career started 0-2, with zero touchdowns, four interceptions and a completion rate in the 50s. But everything has changed since the season’s first four games, which Payton referred to as “a race to improve.” Nick Kosmider provides perspective on Nix after the the 24-year-old’s best performance yet (307 yards and four touchdowns on Sunday against Atlanta): “Since the start of October, a span of seven games, Nix is completing 69 percent of his passes. He has thrown 13 touchdowns and only two interceptions — and he’s rushed for two more scores. He has posted a 106.3 passer rating. The only quarterbacks in the same statistical ballpark during that span: Jared Goff, Baker Mayfield and Joe Burrow.” Nick also previously explained the improvements he’s seen from Nix. Here’s one that stood out: “Nix has taken a big leap as an intermediate passer. Since Week 5, he is completing passes between 5 and 15 yards beyond the line of scrimmage at a mark that is top-10 in the NFL. His completion rate on those throws through the first four games of the season was 37.5 percent, which ranked last out of 33 qualified passers.” Sean Payton has played a crucial role, scheming open receivers to make life easier for Nix. His recent work with Marvin Mims is a prime example of what has Nix on track to become the best rookie quarterback in Broncos history. After that, a spot next to Elway would more than suffice. Yesterday, we looked at the seeming decline of the superstar cornerback, and I asked you if we will see a return of the star corner. According to nearly 40 percent of votes, “they never left,” with Jalen Ramsey and Pat Surtain II holding it down in today’s game. The yes/no votes were split an equal 24 percent each, signaling that the status quo is the expectation moving forward. Welcome to HarBowl Week. Vic Tafur picks all the weekend’s games, including the John vs. Jim brothers brawl. It’s somehow in the game. Saquon Barkley’s backward hurdle is now in Madden.

He whipped out his phone to feed the question into a translation app. Advertisement “I am a professional,” he said, pointing at his phone. Grebenkin’s English skills are a work in progress. Five months ago, the Leafs got him a tutor. His effort is admirable. Every sentence he creates carries weight. The winger didn’t take long to review the question. Grebenkin typed his answer in Russian without hesitation. When you are around Grebenkin, you better get ready to hear the brutal truth, as he sees it. He practically shoved his phone in my face with his answer translated into English. “I am ready for the NHL.” There it was again, that same toothless grin. The Grebenkin experience is underway in full for the Toronto Maple Leafs. It’s the smallest of sample sizes, but Grebenkin certainly looked ready to be an NHL player in his debut. The 2022 fifth-round draft pick is a throwback player: Full of swagger, unafraid to speak his mind and ready to be daring on and off the ice. With injuries ravaging the Leafs, they turned to Grebekin ahead of schedule. But you wouldn’t know it, based on how he played on Wednesday: He landed four hits, second only to Simon Benoit. In just 10:04 of five-on-five ice time, the Leafs easily won those minutes with a 78 percent expected goals share. Grebenkin never stopped moving and creating chances shift to shift. He added 1:01 TOI on the power play. Crucially, the Leafs beat the Vegas Golden Knights 3-0. “If we don’t win, I won’t enjoy it,” Grebenkin said before his debut. “If we win, I’ll enjoy it.” Part of the reason for the hype surrounding Grebenkin is the Leafs don’t have another prospect like him in their system: Built like a truck and able to run over opposition defenders while maintaining control of the puck. Blessed with a heavy and accurate shot and driven by a thick 6-foot-2, 210-pound frame. Ceaselessly daring with the puck in the offensive zone, taking the kind of chances that might excite and frustrate onlookers all the same. Unafraid to drop the mitts in his first preseason game and hype up a crowd seconds afterward.

You never quite know what’s going to happen, but you know you’re going to be entertained. This season’s Marlies are stacked with an array of young, talented skaters and Leafs draft picks they haven’t had in seasons past, including Roni Hirvonen, Topi Niemela and Ryan Tverberg. Advertisement But none offer the high-end, sometimes dazzling upside Grebenkin has. “A lot of tools,” Marlies head coach John Gruden said of Grebenkin, before raising his eyes knowingly. “He’s not afraid to get engaged.” After winning a KHL championship with Metallurg Magnitogorsk last season, Grebenkin signed his entry-level contract with the Leafs. It’s worth remembering Grebenkin is in his first North American professional season. So far, the production is there: Grebenkin’s 0.77 points per game is 10th among regular AHL rookies. Yes, his numbers are juiced by some exemplary work on the man advantage: Three of his four goals have come on the power play. And Grebenkin is shooting at an outlandish 22 percent. All but one AHL rookie who has found the back of the net as much as Grebenkin has logged more shots. Some midseason regression feels likely. But that regression is not what the Leafs are concerned about right now. They need warm bodies. And Grebenkin is coming in hot. That much was evident in his NHL debut. His willingness to be physical, skate heavily to force turnovers and be aggressive in the offensive zone is tailor-made for the kind of hockey coach Craig Berube and general manager Brad Treliving want to play. “(Grebenkin did) all the things I thought he was going to do,” Berube said.

But harnessing that energy and using his skill set to be effective within a team structure? That could be the difference between a player bouncing up and down between the AHL and the NHL and one sticking in the latter. Once the Leafs roster features more healthy forwards than those battling injuries, Grebenkin could return to the AHL for more seasoning. Advertisement “(Grebenkin) has just got to continue to understand things don’t happen overnight. You need to continue to work on those habits and keep being a better version of yourself every day. It seems like he wants it, which is great. He’s always asking things,” Gruden said. Before his call-up, the Marlies identified the need for Grebenkin to become more consistent in his game, to smooth out how much he stops and starts on the ice and become better with transitional plays when going from defence to offence. “Sometimes players will drift a little bit out of position,” Gruden said. “He’s working on it.” What Grebenkin can do in his first North American professional season will go a long way to dictate what kind of NHL potential he has in the short term. Compared to the other crop of Leafs prospects in the AHL, Grebenkin might possess the most potential but also the most room for improvement. “My team in Russia didn’t like to play in the (defensive zone). And I didn’t either. But I understand that in the NHL, you have to like it,” Grebenkin said. “I’ve stayed in Canada for five months and I’m understanding hockey in Canada.” When Grebenkin spoke to The Athletic, he was fresh off a day off. He drove 45 minutes away from his Liberty Village condo to spend his entire day soaking up a taste of home: a Russian bath, complete with a sauna, cold tub plunges and a type of Venik massage — during which a bundle of leafy branches are used to remove dead skin — that the BBC called “not for the faint-hearted.” Does the massage hurt? “Oh yeah,” he said, before breaking out into laughter. Nikita Grebenkin is already learning so much in the NHL 😂 pic.twitter.com/Qr4I0mmgSp — TSN (@TSN_Sports) November 21, 2024    Asked what he likes about living in Toronto, Grebenkin answered quickly. “My house,” he said before his same piercing laugh echoed off the Ford Performance Centre walls. “I’ve never stayed in a big city. My city in Russia is very small.” Grebenkin lives alone, so when he can socialize, he will. He’s fond of paintball. Whether it was with former Marlie goalie Vyacheslav Peksa or Russian friends visiting earlier this season, he never turns down a chance to play with large groups. Advertisement “It’s a hard game. It’s painful,” he said, grinning. Slowly, he is getting more comfortable leaving his home. “Every week, I go to The Keg,” he said. “Big steak and escargot. A long time ago, I never had escargot. But now, I like it.” The night before his NHL debut, he went out for dinner with former Leaf and current Golden Knights goalie Ilya Samsonov. They both came up in the Metallurg system in Russia. “(Grebenkin) is ready, and he is excited,” Samsonov said. That excitement could last longer than anticipated. Matthew Knies left the game after taking a high hit from the Golden Knights’ Zach Whitecloud and did not return. It’s possible he is added to the list of forwards who will miss time. That could mean Grebenkin’s experience in the NHL continues a little longer. “I am working every day,” he said with sincerity weeks before his debut. “On my days off, I am working. I am waiting for my chance in the NHL.” Grebenkin doesn’t have to wait any longer. And if his full-throttle on and off-ice persona is any indication, he’s going to do a lot with that chance.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Giannis Antetokounmpo's huge third quarter in win over Bulls leaves teammates speechless,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936870/2024/11/21/giannis-antetokounmpo-dominance-bucks-bulls/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 15:40:35 GMT",Antetokounmpo's dominance on offense has the Bucks optimistic again after a 2-8 start. They have now won four of the last five games.,"NBA MILWAUKEE — Following a 122-106 win over the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday, Milwaukee Bucks center Brook Lopez provided an exasperated response to one fact about the game. “I don’t know what you want me to say anymore,” Lopez said, shaking his head at his locker. The same fact about the Bucks’ third-quarter performance drew disbelief from shooting guard AJ Green. Advertisement “In the third?” Green asked. “Geez.” What was the fact that left them incredulous? Lopez and Green were reacting to finding out Giannis Antetokounmpo had scored 25 of the Bucks’ 29 points in the third quarter, the most recent example of Antetokounmpo’s dominance. Lopez and Green smiled and laughed as they reflected on the moments of absurdity that can come from playing with one of the best players on the planet. “It’s amazing,” Green said. “It’s incredible. I mean, I didn’t even realize that. He carried us throughout that third quarter because we kind of had a rough start to the third and that’s where he carried us. He did what he does.” “Obviously, Giannis was just, S-Tier, just the best player on the planet leading us through that third quarter,” Lopez added. “And we need him to do that and he’s always been there for us.” Giannis had 25 of the 29 points in the third quarter. S Tier. Best player on the planet. pic.twitter.com/54VvH2uKZ4 — Milwaukee Bucks (@Bucks) November 21, 2024  On the night, Antetokounmpo scored 41 points on 17-of-24 shooting — his 21st career game with at least 40 points with a 70 percent field goal percentage or better, the most in NBA history — and also added nine rebounds and eight assists, but his third quarter is what stood out in Wednesday’s win. The Bulls did not have an answer for Antetokounmpo, who scored 32 points in the paint on Wednesday. “He has that ability,” Bucks head coach Doc Rivers said. “Just attacking downhill. He came into the game to try to be a facilitator and that’s good, but we want him to do that and stay aggressive at the same time. And I thought he turned it on then.” Throughout this season, the Bucks have struggled at the start of the second half, especially in games where they have a halftime lead. More often than not, Rivers has been forced to take the first timeout of the second half as the Bucks have come out flat or uninspired. Antetokounmpo scored four quick points to start the third, but the Bucks still had a familiar lull, forcing Rivers to take that timeout. Out of that stoppage, Rivers drew up an easy play to get Antetokounmpo moving downhill toward the rim. Damian Lillard, who put up 20 points, five rebounds and 10 assists on Wednesday, has the option to work in the pick-and-roll with Lopez on this play, but this is a look the Bucks have been using as far back as the fourth game of the season against the Boston Celtics. With so much attention on Lillard and Lopez, Antetokounmpo was given an easy runway to the rim. A few plays later, off a missed tip-in from Bulls forward Josh Giddey, Lillard found Antetokounmpo running down the middle of the floor in space. “I think Dame helped me a lot,” Antetokounmpo said of his big third quarter performance. “In the second half, I got the ball a lot in transition. Dame feed me two, three times in transition. I was able to attack and get some easy ones.” But Antetokounmpo’s third quarter dominance was not only about getting out in transition. The veteran forward also dominated in half-court settings as the Bulls struggled to find anyone big enough or strong enough to put up the necessary resistance to keep him from getting to the rim. Advertisement When the Bulls opted to use Julian Phillips, a 198-pound forward who recently turned 21 years old, as Antetokounmpo’s primary defender to close out the third quarter, the Bucks attacked the mismatch relentlessly. “Then I went to the post and then I took my dribble, my crab dribble and I saw they wasn’t coming, so in the moment I felt that, it was like, ‘OK. It’s an opportunity for me to go,'” Antetokounmpo said. “And I was able to get in the paint, make some plays for myself or for my teammates.” There were moments where the Bucks executed well and constructed smart half-court looks, like this high-low post entry pass from Bobby Portis. But there were also times when Antetokounmpo was simply just too much for Phillips to handle down low. While much of third quarter was about his scoring, Antetokounmpo also assisted on the lone Bucks’ basket scored by someone else: a huge, momentum-building corner 3 by Green who had 18 points and was 5 of 7 from 3. “It could go the other way,” Antetokounmpo said about the counter to his third quarter aggressiveness. “If I felt like they were coming, then I gotta pick them apart. I gotta be smart.” In the end, Antetokounmpo’s third-quarter takeover carried the Bucks through a third-quarter rough patch and allowed them to stay in control, leading Milwaukee to blow out the Bulls and win comfortably in the fourth quarter. After a 2-8 start to the season, the Bucks have won four of the last five games. During this recent successful stretch, Antetokounmpo has regularly shown off an ability to be a facilitator and a dominant scorer. And while those abilities are not new, the last five games have seen Antetokounmpo seemingly pick the way he is going to control the game and lean into the strengths of those two different identities better than ever before. Advertisement At the start of this five-game stretch, Antetokounmpo tallied 22 potential assists in a 99-85 win over the Toronto Raptors. The following night, he scored 59 points against the Detroit Pistons. In a one-point loss to the Charlotte Hornets on Saturday, Antetokounmpo again looked to dominate with the pass and tallied 12 assists. On Wednesday night, he started the game looking to pass and get his teammates involved before taking over as a scorer in the second half. How has he been able to flip between his two offensive personalities, he was asked? “I’m selfless enough to do that,” Antetokounmpo said. “There’s going to be days that I gotta score the ball. There’s going to be days that I don’t have to score the ball, I gotta move the ball. You gotta be willing to do it. If you’re not willing to do it, it’s not going to be out there on the court for you to see. “Every game, it switches, but you’ve gotta be willing to do both. You know, there’s going to be some times that Dame’s gotta score 40. There’s going to be times that he has to get 15 assists. That’s what winning basketball is.” What makes Antetokounmpo so impressive at this point in his career is not just his willingness to be able to dominate games as both a passer and a scorer, it’s that he can pull it off and he knows which nights call for which approach. If teams are going to send double- and triple-teams his way, he is talented enough as a passer to pick them apart. If teams choose to use a big-bodied defender to try to play him one-on-one, Antetokounmpo will score more efficiently than anyone else in the NBA. Here is today’s exchange with Bucks coach Doc Rivers in regards to the latest on Khris Middleton: pic.twitter.com/dqER6qMTNA — Eric Nehm (@eric_nehm) November 20, 2024  Whatever the game calls for, Antetokounmpo can provide. Thus far this season, with Khris Middleton still sidelined and working towards feeling comfortable enough to play five-on-five, each game has called for Antetokounmpo to provide quite a bit. Until more reinforcements arrive, he will need to continue to leave teammates in awe if the Bucks are to climb out of their early-season hole.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,USA out of Davis Cup: Australia beats Bob Bryan's team after surprise doubles pick,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5937718/2024/11/21/usa-davis-cup-out-australia-doubles-pick/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 15:31:30 GMT",Doubles selection controversy has again overshadowed Team USA's Davis Cup after a defeat to Australia,"Tennis MALAGA, Spain — Team USA captain Bob Bryan has insisted that he “wouldn’t change a thing” after his selection gamble backfired spectacularly in a 2-1 Davis Cup quarterfinal defeat to Australia. At 1-1 in the tie, Bryan, one of the greatest men’s doubles players of all time, opted to switch Olympic men’s doubles silver medalists Rajeev Ram and Austin Krajicek for top singles players Ben Shelton and Tommy Paul. Up against two top-10 doubles players in Matt Ebden and Jordan Thompson, the Americans lost 6-4, 6-4. Advertisement Bryan said in a news conference that he made the decision in the 15-minute window between the second and third ties. “We have an experienced doubles team in Rajeev and Austin, and we’ve got a lot of firepower from the singles lineup,” he said. “We were hoping to catch the Aussies a little bit by surprise.” According to Australia’s captain, the former Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion Lleyton Hewitt, that hope was misplaced. “It didn’t surprise us that much, to be honest,” he said in a news conference. “I’d seen them do drills during the week, so yeah, it wasn’t a surprise.” Shelton, the world No. 21, had earlier come out on the wrong side of a 30-point tiebreak against world No. 78 Thanasi Kokkinakis, falling to a 6-1, 4-6, 7-6(14) defeat. Taylor Fritz, America’s top-ranked singles player at world No. 4 and this year’s U.S. Open finalist, beat world No. 9 Alex De Minaur 6-3, 6-4 to force the deciding rubber. The selection change meant that rather than having two doubles specialists who play on the ATP tour together play that rubber, the USA fielded two singles players with relatively little doubles experience (though Shelton did play at college and still does semi-regularly). The decision was even more surprising because the USA team captain Bryan, in his first finals since taking the role full time last year, is a legendary doubles player. He won 23 Grand Slams across the men’s and mixed disciplines, the former with his brother, Mike. Ram and Krajicek have not been in good form, losing four of their five matches since linking up in September but they are both Grand Slam champions and former world No. 1s. They’ve played 41 matches together in total since first linking up in 2015, but lost the Olympic final to an Australia team featuring Ebden, alongside John Peers. Paul, the world No. 12 in singles, did win a bronze medal in doubles at the Olympics with Fritz but has not played doubles since. He has only once played with Shelton, who looked lost in the first set against Kokkinakis and, after a credible recovery, went for too many low-margin shots in the deciding tiebreak. Advertisement The loss could bring back memories for Ram, who was not picked in the squad for the 2022 finals with then-captain Mardy Fish opting to take four players with five spots available. Team USA then went out at the quarterfinal stage to Italy, after losing the decisive doubles rubber. Paul and Fritz were the picks that day and received criticism on Twitter (formerly X) from Canadian doubles specialist Brayden Schnur, who said the decision had been made because of the American pair’s “egos.” Fritz and Paul both hit back and defended Fish’s selection. In this case Bryan said “we know how everyone is feeling, and we know a lot about the opponents that we’re playing.” “It’s a world of analytics. You talk amongst the other coaches.” As for how much the players were involved in the decision, Bryan said: “Some guys are comfortable playing with some guys, and there is a lot that goes in, a lot of dynamics in doubles. “Look, Austin and Raj, they were very supportive. They were the guys on the sidelines yelling out tactics and helping with serving spots and coverages. They’re in it as great teammates.” Aiming to unsettle the Aussies, it was actually Paul who was broken in his first service game. Opponents Ebden and Thompson won the Australian Open, Olympics and U.S. Open men’s doubles competitions between them this year, and so the dynamic of the match was very much about two top singles players facing a pair of doubles experts — even if Thompson has relatively recently blossomed on the doubles court. A singles player can take over a doubles match, like Jannik Sinner in last year’s Davis Cup or Andy Murray in the 2015 final, but the most pertinent recent example of it going the other way was Ram and Krajicek schooling Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz at the Olympics in July. GO DEEPER Irresistible force of Nadalcaraz falls at the Olympics to an immovable object Early on, the Aussies made good use of their greater doubles nous, pinching that early break after Ebden had anticipated a crosscourt backhand from Paul and intercepted it with a clinical volley; in the second set, Ebden directed a tricky smash into the tramlines to break again. They faced just one break point throughout. At the Laver Cup in September, Shelton spoke about how much he enjoys doubles — though that was after playing in a match that involved four singles players. “You play two doubles guys and no one hits over a return. They chip lob you every time. They serve and volley every point,” he said of the difference when playing with doubles specialists. Advertisement “And put away every volley. They are literally standing on the net. “With singles guys, it’s a little different. They are roping the ball crosscourt, hitting the ball way cleaner from the baseline, but not moving as much at net, so you feel a little bit more comfortable returning.” The defeat means the USA, 32-time Davis Cup champions, have not reached the semifinals since 2018 nor won the event since 2007. With an American team missing Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula and Emma Navarro exiting the Billie Jean King Cup finals at the first hurdle last week, Team USA leaves Malaga with a record of 0-2. Australia faces the winner of Thursday night’s tie between Italy and Argentina in the semifinals on Saturday. (Top photo: Clive Brunskill / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"John Elway talks Bo Nix's rise, Broncos QB support, Mike Shanahan's Hall of Fame hopes",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935369/2024/11/21/john-elway-bronocs-bo-nix-mike-shanahan/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 15:27:46 GMT",The Broncos legend also discussed his diagnosis with Dupuytren's contracture five years ago and is now sharing story of his treatment.,"NFL When Bo Nix was named the Broncos starting quarterback in September, he became the team’s first rookie to earn that role since John Elway since 1983. There were parallels between Nix and the Hall of Fame quarterback that continued from there. Both players struggled at the start. Elway completed only 1-of-8 passes in his NFL debut and was sacked four times. Nix threw only one touchdown pass in his first four games, the low point being a first half during a win against the New York Jets in which he threw for minus-7 yards on 15 attempts during a rainy day at MetLife Stadium. Advertisement But Nix has since hit a red-hot streak Elway didn’t find until after his rookie season. Nix was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week on Wednesday after throwing for 307 yards and four touchdowns in Sunday’s 38-6 rout of the Atlanta Falcons. Among those who have been impressed by the 24-year-old quarterback’s rapid growth — and that of the Broncos as a team around him — is Elway himself. The first rookie QB in franchise history to earn this honor. RT to congratulate QB Bo Nix on being named AFC Offensive Player of the Week‼️ 📰 » https://t.co/a7Aa334bNf pic.twitter.com/h4x7U97LPT — Denver Broncos (@Broncos) November 20, 2024  “He’s very talented and very mature; he played 60 college games, which is unheard of for most young guys who come into the NFL,” Elway said of Nix. “It gave him a big step forward. The combination of what Bo is doing and, even more importantly, (the way) Sean (Payton) and (quarterbacks coach) Davis Webb are handling him and putting him in the right situations. Then, you look at the Broncos playing great defense. They haven’t put Bo in situations he hasn’t been able to handle. They’ve been able to grow him over this season and you’ve seen his maturation already and the confidence level that’s growing with the offense and what Sean’s doing.” Elway spoke with The Athletic on Wednesday as part of a promotional public health campaign that raising awareness for — and treatment of — Dupuytren’s contracture (DC), a progressive hand condition caused by a build-up of collagen that forms a rope-like chord in the palm and makes it difficult to bend fingers. It’s a condition that affects as many as 17 million Americans, and Elway first announced his battle with the debilitating issue five years ago. Since then, he insists, it’s an aspect of his life he gets asked about frequently by strangers he meets, many eager to share their own stories of dealing with DC. “It’s amazing the amount of people that come up that have this and ask me about it, whether it’s in their fingers of the palm of their hands,” Elway said. “So it’s been good for me to help get the word out and help those people who look at their hands and kind of wonder what’s going on.” GO DEEPER Broncos' biggest turnaround this side of Bo Nix: A run defense with real bite Elway has done the math. He had 19 surgeries during his playing career. When he was diagnosed with DC he learned there was no cure. Surgery “was really the only option” for treatment Elway was presented with at the time, he said. Elway wasn’t keen on having a 20th operation, so he went along managing the condition the best he could. Advertisement “I never had a lot of pain, but it was more of an annoyance,” he said. “And something that, once I found out about it, it continues to get worse and worse.” Finally, during his penultimate season as the Broncos’ general manager in 2019, Elway found a non-surgical treatment, a medicated injection called Xiaflex that uses enzymes to break down the collagen in the affected tissue chords. The treatment was a 24-hour process that included injections into the palm of his hand and a follow-up appointment the next day. “It’s not an easy one in the fact that getting shots in the palm of your hand is not the most comfortable thing,” Elway said. “But the recovery time is two weeks and it’s a much better option, in my opinion.” He stressed when speaking to USA Today about his condition in 2019 that everyone should “check with their hand specialist” to discover the treatment option that works best. But the former quarterback said Wednesday that the route he chose five years ago immediately helped release the tension in his fingers, giving him mobility back in his hands. Elway has recently been dealing with a reoccurrence of DC on the ring finger of his right hand and will soon “go back and probably do another treatment.” “It’s not curable, but there is a solution to it that releases those fingers and live a good, comfortable life,” he said. Elway last worked with the Broncos as a consultant during the 2022 season. He isn’t around the facility much these days — though he did make an appearance during organized team activities in the spring — but his Sundays remain committed to watching the team he led to a combined eight AFC championships as a quarterback and an executive. As the most important player in franchise history, his words about the quarterback position in Denver always carry weight. As Elway first told ESPN’s Adam Schefter during a podcast appearance earlier this week, he hasn’t yet met Nix, but he’s been impressed watching the rookie quarterback from afar. He’s been struck not only by the improved play of Nix but also by the way the Broncos have built a healthy ecosystem around the young quarterback. GO DEEPER Marvin Mims Jr.'s new role highlights Sean Payton's creativity with Broncos offense Only three of Elway’s draft picks from his time as the team’s lead football decision-maker (2011 to 2020) remain on Denver’s roster: offensive tackle Garett Bolles (2017), wide receiver Courtland Sutton (2018) and linebacker Justin Strnad (2020). Elway said he has enjoyed watching how Payton has helped a young roster — albeit it one with key veterans protecting Nix on the offensive line — improve around the rookie quarterback. The Broncos are 6-5, currently the No. 7 playoff seed in the AFC, ahead of Sunday’s road game against the Las Vegas Raiders. Advertisement “They’re all getting used to each other, right?” Elway said. “They’re running the ball better. The wide receivers with the speed, they’re young, other than Courtland. The young guys are starting to step up and they’re all growing together. I think it’s a great combination. It’s great coaching. I think that’s a big part of it that’s not been talked about, what those offensive coaches are doing around Bo and getting him in situations where they are protecting him with good play-calling and not putting him in situations he can’t handle.” Nix said after being drafted in April that one of the coolest aspects of joining the Broncos was that Elway was his father’s favorite player. So when he relayed Elway’s words Wednesday, they resonated. “He’s a legend not only here for this organization, but for the entire NFL, so you do want to listen when a guy like that is talking, and you want to pay attention to it,” Nix said. “It’s an honor to be in this spot to where people like that can speak about it.” Elway, like many Broncos from his era — and their fans alike — eagerly awaits news about Mike Shanahan’s potential next step toward induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Shanahan, the Broncos’ head coach from 1995 to 2008, is one of nine semifinalists for the coaching category in the 2025 class, a group that also includes former Broncos coach Dan Reeves. A sub-committee is expected to announce one finalist next month to be put forth and considered for induction by the entire voting body. Before Shanahan became Elway’s head coach during the backstretch of his career, he also served as Elway’s quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator. In 1985, Shanahan’s first as coordinator and Elway’s third as an NFL quarterback, he attempted a career-high 605 pass attempts. Later, when Shanahan became the head coach after a three-season stint as the offensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers, he built a super-charged running game around the aging quarterback and helped the Broncos win their first two Super Bowl championships. “There’s nobody more deserving (for induction),” Elway said. “He was a great coach when he was my quarterbacks coach. He was a great head coach. When you look at what he’s done for the game of football and what he’s done with the West Coast offense, how he kind of took it to the next level, now you’re seeing all the coaches from his coaching tree that is just expanding that system on the offensive side. It all comes back to Mike and the influence he’s had on the game. You see it everywhere you turn on TV. There’s a Mike Shanahan influence offensively on what everyone’s doing in this league. That’s why Mike deserves to be in the Hall of Fame. We’re all hopeful. He’s going to get in, we just hope it’s this year.” Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Has the expanded College Football Playoff made more games 'matter' down the stretch?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5937507/2024/11/21/college-football-playoff-expansion-scenarios/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 14:59:45 GMT","With a 12-team field containing five conference champions and seven at-large bids, the CFP race has altered the stakes of late November.","NCAAF The expanded College Football Playoff is doing exactly what it intended to do, allowing more teams more access to important games late in the season. The regular season’s penultimate weekend offers 21 games with College Football Playoff ramifications. Next week, there are currently 23. That’s nearly three times as many as the final two weeks combined (15) in 2023. Advertisement With a 12-team field containing five conference champions and seven at-large squads, this year’s race paints a vastly different picture from mid-November in 2023, which fed into the final four-team Playoff. At this time a year ago, eight teams had positioned themselves above the field as CFP contenders. Now every team still in the running for a power-conference title remains in CFP contention. Perhaps the number of games with CFP stakes next week will drop a bit due to upsets this Saturday, but it will still dwarf the seven with CFP implications played on Thanksgiving weekend in 2023.  “What would be the talking point right now that everybody would be complaining about if it was a four-team playoff?” CBS college football analyst Gary Danielson said. “Are we going to get two from the SEC? Are we going to get two Big Ten teams or is Notre Dame going to be the fifth team? Is that the whole argument there? I think that’s all that would be going on right now.” Let’s break down the differences between 2023 and 2024 based on each season’s penultimate week of action. Win and they’re virtually in No. 5 Indiana (10-0) at No. 2 Ohio State (9-1). The winner is assured of a CFP berth and probably a home Playoff game. The loser still is in decent shape for a CFP spot, but it might have to travel. In good shape with a win Kentucky (4-6) at No. 3 Texas (9-1). The Longhorns likely lock up a spot with a victory, but it’s against a team they can’t take lightly. The Wildcats are 1-6 in SEC play but won at Ole Miss and lost to Georgia by one point. No. 4 Penn State (9-1) at Minnesota (6-4). It’s going to be cold, and the Nittany Lions haven’t won in Minneapolis since 2010. Penn State will have a CFP case even with a loss, but scrutiny will intensify. No. 7 Alabama (8-2) at Oklahoma (5-5). Considered a marquee matchup when the Sooners joined the SEC, this one has lost some sizzle. However, a loss would severely wound the Tide’s CFP chances, or at least make them contingent upon other teams losing. Advertisement No. 9 Ole Miss (8-2) at Florida (5-5). The teams have played just twice since 2008 and not in Gainesville since 2015. An Ole Miss loss likely ends its CFP hopes. Elimination games No. 19 Army (9-0) vs. No. 6 Notre Dame (9-1) at Yankee Stadium. Army could vault itself into strong consideration by the CFP selection committee by upsetting Notre Dame. A loss likely dooms Notre Dame’s CFP hopes. Wake Forest (4-6) at No. 8 Miami (9-1). The Hurricanes were off last week and will attempt to rebound after losing to Georgia Tech. A second loss coupled with an SMU win eliminates Miami from the ACC championship game and likely the CFP. No. 15 Texas A&M (8-2) at Auburn (4-6). This is dangerous territory for the Aggies, who have a date with Texas on deck. Auburn doesn’t lack for talent, and despite its record, it matches up with just about everyone. No. 22 Iowa State (8-2) at Utah (4-6). The Cyclones need this win to remain in Big 12 and CFP contention, while the Utes are in danger of missing a bowl in a full season for the first time since 2013. No. 24 UNLV (8-2) at San Jose State (6-4). For the Rebels to have a shot at the Mountain West title, let alone the CFP, they need to beat a Spartans team that has been competitive all year and get some help. Colorado State (7-3) at Fresno State (5-5). The Rams are unbeaten in the Mountain West, and a potential conference title game showdown with Boise State would offer them an outside shot at the last automatic bid. Not must-win but still vital No. 13 SMU (9-1) at Virginia (5-5). The Mustangs are the ACC’s only unbeaten team but can’t afford a loss to pick up an at-large berth. No. 14 BYU (9-1) at No. 21 Arizona State (8-2). Neither can clinch a Big 12 title game berth with a win, but a loss makes that goal awfully difficult. No. 16 Colorado (8-2) vs. Kansas (4-6) in Kansas City, Mo. The Buffaloes are rolling, but they meet an equally hot Jayhawks squad that has beaten Iowa State and BYU in consecutive weeks. Advertisement Lose and you deserve to miss the CFP UMass (2-8) at No. 10 Georgia (8-2)
UTEP (2-8) at No. 11 Tennessee (8-2)
No. 12 Boise State (9-1) at Wyoming (2-8)
The Citadel (FCS) at No. 17 Clemson (8-2)
Wofford (FCS) at No. 18 South Carolina (7-3) Little direct impact but could help metrics No. 23 Missouri (7-3) at Mississippi State (2-8)
No. 25 Illinois (7-3) at Rutgers (6-4) Texas A&M and Alabama wouldn’t mind the resume boost of the Tigers hanging on at the back end of the Top 25. Similarly, the Illini can aid Penn State and Oregon if they stay in the rankings. It’s a little simpler to track the 15 games that carried CFP ramifications with two weeks remaining in the 2023 regular season. Eight teams had distanced themselves from the rest of the pack as legitimate CFP contenders. Their results on the second-to-last weekend did nothing to dispel that notion. No. 1 Georgia 38, No. 18 Tennessee 10. The unbeaten Bulldogs closed out SEC play with an emphatic victory. No. 2 Ohio State 37, Minnesota 3. The Buckeyes finished their home campaign by keeping pace with their archrivals atop the conference standings. No. 3 Michigan 31, Maryland 24. The Wolverines appeared somewhat vulnerable against the Terrapins, but in reality it served as a wakeup call that propelled them to the CFP national title. No. 4 Florida State 58, North Alabama 13. Seminoles quarterback Jordan Travis’ season-ending injury made this game more consequential to the final CFP rankings than anyone could have imagined at the time. No. 5 Washington 22, No. 11 Oregon State 20. In their final meeting as conference rivals, the Huskies held off the Beavers to clinch a Pac-12 championship game berth. No. 6 Oregon 49, Arizona State 13. Bo Nix threw six touchdown passes in the first half to take the Ducks one step closer to a rematch with Washington. Advertisement No. 7 Texas 26, Iowa State 16. The Longhorns cleared a big hurdle toward reaching their first CFP after losing three of their last four in Ames. No. 8 Alabama 66, Chattanooga 10. People actually spent money to watch this game. On Thanksgiving weekend, Michigan knocked off Ohio State again, and the other six teams held serve with varying degrees of drama. Perhaps a more balanced year-over-year comparison is to line up this year’s matchups with those that were pivotal for not only the four-team CFP but for New Year’s Six bowls and conference championships. Those numbers are nearly identical. Last year, 22 games fit that description the penultimate week and 18 on Thanksgiving weekend. In addition, there were two teams that had already clinched division titles approaching their final games but were not in the CFP picture. In the final year with a four-team field, not every game had CFP ramifications, but several impacted New Year’s Six bowls and conference championship games. Here are the ones that were pivotal in choosing New Year’s Six representatives. No. 9 Missouri 33, Florida 31. A field goal with five seconds left kept the Tigers in the New Year’s Six hunt. Ultimately, they landed a Cotton Bowl berth. No. 11 Penn State 27, Rutgers 6. The Nittany Lions were out of the Big Ten title chase, but this result helped get them to the Peach Bowl. No. 13 Ole Miss 35, Louisiana-Monroe 3. The Rebels’ win kept them on track for an eventual Peach Bowl spot. Outside of Texas, the Big 12 was a hot mess of uncertainty. Coming out of the penultimate weekend, four teams still had a chance to win the league title and earn a New Year’s Six spot. No. 14 Oklahoma 31, BYU 24. A late touchdown kept the Sooners in the Big 12 title hunt, although they did not control their own path. No. 23 Oklahoma State 43, Houston 30. The Cowboys’ win gave them the inside track to face Texas in the Big 12 championship game. They earned that spot the following week. Advertisement No. 21 Kansas State 31, No. 25 Kansas 27. The Wildcats rallied from an 11-point second-half deficit to stay on the fringe of Big 12 title contention. In the Group of 5, there was a race among the leaders of Conference USA, the American and the Mountain West for the automatic New Year’s Six bid. It included five games on that weekend. No. 24 Tulane 24, Florida Atlantic 8. Tulane stayed even with the American’s other two unbeatens and kept alive hopes for a second straight New Year’s Six bid. SMU 38, Memphis 34. In the American’s marquee game, the Mustangs used a strong fourth quarter to remain undefeated in league play and eliminate Memphis from the title hunt. UTSA 49, USF 21. The Roadrunners remained in a first-place tie with Tulane and SMU in the American by rolling past USF. Liberty 49, UMass 25. The Flames remained unbeaten at 11-0 and crept closer to a New Year’s Six bid, which they ultimately obtained. UNLV 31, Air Force 27. UNLV took control of first place in the Mountain West, and it was the one school in the league that had a shot at the New Year’s Six. The ACC, Big 12 and Pac-12 played without divisions last year, but the Big Ten and SEC held on for one final season, which kept New Year’s Six bowl hopes alive for teams that perhaps wouldn’t have competed for a national championship. No. 10 Louisville 38, Miami 31. The Cardinals claimed the second ACC championship game spot and stayed alive for a possible New Year’s Six berth. No. 16 Iowa 15, Illinois 13. The offense-challenged Hawkeyes squeaked to another win and clinched the Big Ten West Division with one week to play. No. 17 Arizona 42, No. 22 Utah 18. The Wildcats’ surge kept them within striking distance of Oregon for the second Pac-12 title game spot. In the final week of the 2023 regular season, there were seven games with CFP consequences. This year, it appears that 23 games on Thanksgiving weekend will have CFP implications. Nearly all of them are rivalries, which adds another layer to the sport’s unpredictability. One aspect remains certain: The more games that matter in the championship chase, the more it will excite the public and keep it — and the teams themselves — engaged longer. (Top photo: Kevin C.

The New York Post first reported the news. The roundtable discussion show, which features notable panelists from the media world discussing the day’s top stories, launched in 2002 with Max Kellerman as host. Tony Reali took over hosting duties in 2004 and has remained in that role ever since. The show became a popular mainstay on the network in the 5 p.m. ET time slot, pairing with “Pardon the Interruption” and featuring sportswriters and media personalities from around the country, including Woody Paige, Mina Kimes, Bill Plaschke, Jackie MacMullan, J.A. Adande and Elle Duncan, among others. Advertisement Erik Rydholm, the creator and executive producer of “Pardon the Interruption,” has overseen “Around the Horn” since 2004. The Athletic’s Stephen J. Nesbitt described the show in a story on Reali in 2022 as evolving “from a barrage of bombastic debate into a smarter show where banter and nuance can coexist,” and wrote that “Reali has developed from a facilitator, a pass-first point guard, into a host whose voice and vulnerability have made a glorified game show into a refreshingly genuine space.” It’s unclear what will be next for Reali, 46. In terms of the show’s slot, the network and Rydholm’s team are exploring other shows but don’t have an exact plan yet, a source briefed on the matter confirmed.

Survivor Pools | Fantasy football player rankings Updated through 6 p.m. ET, Nov. 21 Sam Darnold, QB, Vikings (foot) — Expected to play
Darnold was limited in Wednesday’s practice due to a foot injury but is now off the injury report and is expected to play Isiah Pacheco, RB, Chiefs (ankle) — Questionable / Injured reserve
Pacheco is expected to return from injured reserve ahead of the Chiefs’ matchup with the Panthers on Sunday. When he is available to return to gameplay, it will mean the end of (fantasy) days for Kareem Hunt. But so far this week, Pacheco’s been a limited participant in practice. Mike Evans, WR, Buccaneers (hamstring) — Expected to play
Evans returned to practice this week and will return in Week 12, according to The Athletic’s league sources. Finally, Tampa Bay has a fantasy starter in its wide receiver corps again. With Chris Godwin on injured reserve, Evans is only competing with TE Cade Otton to be QB Baker Mayfield’s top target. Tyreek Hill, WR, Dolphins (wrist) — Expected to play
Hill is expected to play while nursing a wrist injury that will likely ail him for the rest of the season. While Hill’s teammate Jaylen Waddle has had fantasy relevance in past seasons, he has not done well this year, scoring only 8.0 PPR points per game. Tight end Jonnu Smith, however, had 101 receiving yards on six receptions in Week 11 and finished with 28.1 PPR points, so look to him if you’re in need of a TE with so many teams on bye this week. D’Andre Swift, RB, Bears (groin) — Questionable
Swift practiced in a limited capacity Thursday due to a groin injury and is questionable for Week 12. If he sits, Roschon Johnson becomes an intriguing fantasy play after getting 10 carries to Swift’s 14 in Week 11. Advertisement Jonathon Brooks, RB, Panthers (knee) — Expected to play
Panthers head coach Dave Canales said he “fully expects” Brooks to play in the Chiefs-Panthers matchup, according to Mike Kaye of The Charlotte Observer. For fantasy purposes, it will be important to monitor how many carries Brooks gets compared to Chuba Hubbard, who has been one of the few bright spots for Carolina this season. Hubbard has accumulated 942 yards from scrimmage and has been running efficiently with 5.1 yards per carry. Adam Thielen, WR, Panthers (hamstring) — Questionable
Thielen said he felt good about his early-week workout but still has to “gain some ground to feel really good about playing on Sunday,” according to Panthers’ reporter Kassidy Hill. If Thielen returns, Xavier Legette and Jalen Coker will lose targets on a team that doesn’t have many to go around. QB Bryce Young completed only 15 passes in Week 10 and only 16 in Week 9. Brandin Cooks, WR, Cowboys (knee) — Injured reserve
CeeDee Lamb, WR, Cowboys (back/foot) — Questionable
With Cooper Rush under center, Cooks’ injury status is much less important to fantasy managers, but nonetheless, he was designated for return from injured reserve on Wednesday. Head coach Mike McCarthy said Cooks is getting close, according to The Athletic’s Saad Yousuf. Cooks will compete with Jalen Tolbert and maybe even new-addition Jonathan Mingo for targets, while Lamb, who didn’t practice Thursday, remains the only receiver to trust on a weekly basis with Dallas playing so poorly. Jake Ferguson, TE, Cowboys (concussion) — Questionable
McCarthy said Ferguson “will be hard pressed” to play in Week 12, according to Calvin Watkins of The Dallas Morning News. Backup tight end Luke Schoonmaker had six receptions on 10 targets and 56 receiving yards in Week 11. If you’re desperate for a tight end with so many teams on bye this week, consider Schoonmaker and hope Rush goes 32-for-55 as he did in Week 11, rather than 13-for-23, as in Week 10. Tyjae Spears, RB, Titans (concussion) — Questionable
Spears was not seen at practice on Thursday. While Tony Pollard stands to see a slight uptick in usage with Spears out, Tennessee’s leading rusher had only 44 rushing yards in Week 10 and 15 in Week 11. Advertisement Calvin Ridley, WR, Titans (illness) — Expected to play
Ridley did not practice Wednesday due to illness but is expected to play. Nick Westbrook-Ikhine had a massive Week 11 with 117 receiving yards and a touchdown, but that came from only two receptions, which makes him a boom-or-bust option. NWI has scored over 10 PPR points in three of the past four weeks, but Ridley is the only dependable wide receiver in Tennessee with the Titans’ limited offensive production. Darius Slayton, WR, Giants (concussion) — Questionable
Slayton practiced in full on Thursday. He hasn’t played since Week 9 but averaged 9.56 PPR points before then. Daniel Jones was benched for Tommy DeVito, but targets will likely be similarly dispersed. Malik Nabers is, by far, the most targeted Giants’ receiver at 11.75 targets per game, followed by Wan’Dale Robinson with 8.4 and Slayton with 5.56. Austin Seibert, K, Commanders (hip) — Questionable
Seibert was a limited participant in Thursday’s practice and is questionable for Week 12. Zane Gonzalez filled in for Seibert in Week 11 and made all three of his field goal attempts and was perfect on extra points. Zamir White, RB, Raiders (quadriceps) — Questionable
Alexander Mattison, RB, Raiders (ankle) — Questionable
Neither Mattison nor White practiced Wednesday. Each of them had five carries, and while Mattison had more yards (19) than White (nine), the numbers don’t bode well for future fantasy production for either of these backs. How many ways are there to say the Raiders are just plain bad? MarShawn Lloyd, RB, Packers (appendicitis) — Out
Josh Jacobs, RB, Packers (quadriceps) — Questionable
Lloyd was reinstated from injured reserve but was placed on the non-football illness list Wednesday. Jacobs has been leading Green Bay’s backfield to the tune of 4.8 yards per carry, 838 rushing yards and 186 receiving yards this season. Even if Lloyd returns in 2024, his usage is difficult to predict given Jacobs’ success. If Jacobs cannot play in Week 12, Emanuel Wilson and Chris Brooks will likely share carries. George Kittle, TE, 49ers (hamstring) — Questionable
Kittle told reporters, “I will playing on Sunday, very excited, can’t pass up playing the Packers.” Kittle’s absence was felt in Week 11, and with the 49ers battling for a playoff bid, the situation seems right for Kittle’s return. Brock Purdy, QB, 49ers (shoulder) — Questionable
Many players are on the injury report early in the week only to drop off as the week progresses. Purdy is likely one of those players, but he was a limited participant in Wednesday’s practice. Purdy’s backup is Brandon Allen who has a career completion percentage of only 56.7 percent and hasn’t started and played a full game since 2021. Advertisement Noah Fant, TE, Seahawks (groin) — Questionable
Fant hasn’t played since Week 8 and is questionable again heading into Week 12. Rookie AJ Barner started in Fant’s absence in Weeks 9 and 11 but totaled only 42 receiving yards on six receptions and 11 targets. Jalen Hurts, QB, Eagles (ankle) — Questionable
Hurts was a limited participant in Wednesday’s practice which led to an injury report appearance, but he practiced Thursday and is expected to play. DeVonta Smith, WR, Eagles (hamstring) — Questionable
Smith did not participate in Thursday’s practice and has struggled the past two weeks with only 10.3 PPR points in the two games combined, to go with a total of nine targets and six receptions. Outside of Smith and A.J. Brown, there are no other Philly receivers to roster, even if Smith sits. Jahan Dotson has averaged only 2.09 PPR points per game on an average of 1.7 targets. Ladd McConkey, WR, Chargers (shoulder) — Questionable
McConkey did not participate in practice on Thursday. If he can’t play, Quentin Johnston, Joshua Palmer and TE Will Dissly could see an uptick in usage. In Weeks 10 and 11 combined, Dissly led the Chargers with 12 targets; McConkey had 11, Johnston saw 10, and Palmer was targeted six times. Jake Ciely has McConkey as WR15 this week and Johnston as WR24. 
  Outdoor games only. Statistics in this section come from TruMedia.  The weather hasn’t impacted many games this season, but colder temperatures and precipitation await. According to Rotowire, the Steelers–Browns Thursday night matchup comes with an expected temperature of 36 degrees and a 75 percent chance of rain. Pittsburgh Steelers (8-2) vs. Cleveland Browns (2-8) Since 2015, Jameis Winston has played in six regular-season rain games, and his completion percentage for those contests is a dismal 53.2 percent, compared to a career regular-season total of 61.8 percent. In those games, he’s also thrown 12 interceptions to only seven touchdowns (0.6 TD/interception ratio), which likely comes as no surprise for those who know Winston. He takes risks — a lot of them — when throwing the football. But without rain, his touchdown TD/interception ratio is a much more digestible 1.6. Advertisement While moving toward a run-heavy gameplan in the rain is sensible, the Browns’ running game has been ineffective this season. Cleveland averages only 88.5 rushing yards per game (ranked 29th in the NFL) and has a rush EPA of -2.92 (22nd), and the Steelers rank fourth in rushing yards allowed per game. The Browns may find it hard to plan for this rainy-day game. Russell Wilson has 20 rain games under his belt and a much higher completion percentage of 61.5 percent. In those games, he’s tossed 37 TDs to only 13 interceptions, which gives him the edge on Winston in the rain. The Steelers backfield, relying on Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren, averages 136.7 rushing yards per game (eighth), but Pittsburgh’s rush EPA ranks 29th in the league. In order to keep Cleveland’s defense honest, Wilson needs to throw because the backs aren’t creating scoring opportunities with an EPA of -4.48. George Pickens remains a safe fantasy play, given his 29 percent target share and Wilson’s numbers in the rain. Wondering what the weather impact is on fantasy production? Jake Ciely has you covered like a poncho in rainy season.
 Game-specific previews and live updates are available on the day of the game. Pittsburgh Steelers (8-2) vs. Cleveland Browns (2-8) The Steelers are favored by a little more than a field goal over the Browns in Week 12, and the matchup has an over/under of only 36.5, the lowest total of the week. Pittsburgh’s offense sputtered in Week 11 as Russell Wilson was sacked four times, threw an interception, and had only 205 yards passing. Najee Harris had 18 carries to Jaylen Warren’s nine, and they were each targeted four times, but Warren finished with 4.6 yards per rush compared to Harris’ 3.5. Meanwhile, kicker Chris Boswell led the Steelers in fantasy points with 24. The Browns’ Jameis Winston and Jerry Jeudy have shown some nice chemistry. Jeudy earned 11 targets each of the past two games and finished with 142 yards receiving against New Orleans in Week 11. The Steelers’ defense is better than the Saints’, but Pittsburgh is prone to giving up yards through the air and is ranked 20th in quarterback sack rate. Jeudy could be an intriguing flex option. Read the full preview.   San Francisco 49ers (5-5) vs. Green Bay Packers (7-3) The Green Bay Packers are slight home favorites in their Week 12 contest against the San Francisco 49ers. Coming off a 1-point win against the Bears — secured in the final seconds by a blocked field goal — the Packers weren’t exactly dominant against a struggling Chicago team last week. The Niners are coming off a 20-17 loss to Seattle (who had lost five of their previous six games) and are in a very tight NFC West race that has the 6-4 Cardinals on top. Advertisement Jordan Love and Brock Purdy have become franchise quarterbacks over the past two seasons. However, Love ranks 30th in completion percentage this season, one spot below recently benched Daniel Jones, while Purdy ranks 20th. Although both QBs rank inside the top 10 in fantasy points per game, they fall outside the top 10 in passer rating. Luckily for Love and Purdy, each team has a receiver ranked in the top five in passer rating when targeted (minimum of 35 touches). Jayden Reed tops the list at 146.0, while Jauan Jennings ranks fifth at 127.7. Jennings has been a great complement to Deebo Samuel in the absence of Brandon Aiyuk (injured reserve), rising to WR2 status. Read the full preview (coming Sunday).  Philadelphia Eagles (8-2) vs. Los Angeles Rams (5-5) The Philadelphia Eagles are favored on the road against the Los Angeles Rams in this NFC matchup. The Rams are coming off a narrow 28-22 victory against New England. After a disappointing 9.7 fantasy point performance in Week 10, Matthew Stafford bounced back with 295 passing yards and four TDs against the Patriots. Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua each had over 100 yards receiving and scored (Kupp had two TDs; Nacua had one). Led by QB Jalen Hurts, the Eagles boast two talented receivers of their own, A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith. But Philadelphia has Saquon Barkley, and the Rams do not, and at 273.1 yards allowed per game, the Eagles defense is a force. In contrast, the Rams D sits at 23rd, allowing 350.6 yards per game. Week 12 presents the perfect opportunity for Smith to return to fantasy relevance after Weeks 10 and 11, when he scored 3.4 and 6.9 PPR points, respectively. Read the full preview (coming Sunday).   Baltimore Ravens (7-4) vs. Los Angeles Chargers (7-3) Coming off a tough Week 11 loss to the Steelers, the Ravens are favored by less than a field goal on the road against the Chargers in this AFC matchup that has head coaches Jim and John Harbaugh meeting for the first time since Super Bowl XLVII. The Jim Harbaugh-led Chargers have been rolling lately. Justin Herbert is throwing more and ranks sixth in passer rating (102.1), J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards are handling backfield work, and Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston lead the Chargers’ wide receivers in targets, receiving yards and yards after the catch. Lamar Jackson has had an MVP season for Baltimore (excluding last week’s poor performance), but Derrick Henry has taken a step back lately with under 80 net yards in three of his last four games. Zay Flowers continues to impress (though somewhat inconsistently), while Diontae Johnson has become a fantasy drop, averaging two targets and 0.5 receptions per game. The Chargers defense is tough, and Tuli Tuipulotu has led the NFL over the past three weeks with six sacks, but Jackson has the third-most time to throw in the league. This Harbaugh brothers matchup is full of talent and intrigue. Read the full preview (coming Monday). 
 Statistics in this section come from TruMedia.  Austin Mock scours his weekly projections to spot the top values on the board. Bet picked Thursday: Minnesota Vikings -3 (-115) at Chicago Bears Caleb Williams and this Bears offense looked a lot better last week after making a change at offensive coordinator. Unfortunately for them, the Vikings’ defense is much better than the Packers’ and defensive coordinator Brian Flores getting to face a rookie quarterback is quite the bad matchup. I do have concerns about this Vikings offense since the loss of left tackle Christian Darrisaw, but they should have enough to complement their dominant defense.

 A weekly guide to staying alive from Renee Miller and Adam Gretz. Odds from BetMGM as of Thursday. Question from Melissa: “Six people left. What’s the best plan for the next two weeks: Kansas City (at Carolina), then Minnesota (vs. Arizona); Miami (vs. New England), then Kansas City (vs. Las Vegas); Houston (vs. Tennessee), then Kansas City (vs. Las Vegas)? Most others left in the pool have already used Kansas City and Miami, if that matters.” Congratulations on making it this far! As tempting as it would be to pick Kansas City this week, I would skip the first option because I simply do not trust the Minnesota vs. Arizona game next week. I think the Cardinals are probably pretty legit, and even if they don’t outright beat the Vikings, I could see that being a game you have to sweat through. Plus, I think Kansas City should win the next two games, and both matchups are very favorable. There’s nothing wrong with saving the Chiefs for that game against a very bad Raiders team. Now, the question comes down to Miami or Houston this week. Honestly? I like both of them; they are my picks for the week. If you had to ask me to pick one emphatically and with the most confidence, I would go with Houston. I cannot see the Titans going on the road and beating the Texans, especially with a healthy Nico Collins back in the lineup. You could probably argue that if everybody has already used Kansas City and Miami, they might take Houston this week, so it might make sense to try countering that by taking Miami. I think they will both win anyway, but I am still going to say take the Texans because I have slightly more confidence in them being the safer pick for this week. — Gretz Get this week’s top survivor pool tips.

The pair have both been nursing injuries in recent weeks, with Branthwaite withdrawing from the England squad due to a “minor” groin problem and McNeil having missed Everton’s 0-0 draw at West Ham before the break with a knee issue. Advertisement Both, though, have trained this week and are in with a chance of facing Thomas Frank’s side. “Dwight’s had a really good week training,” Dyche said. “Jarrad trained today (Thursday) after settling things down, so we’ll see how he responds. “We’re hopeful on that but he should be ok.” Long-term absentees Armando Broja (Achilles), Youssef Chermiti (foot), Seamus Coleman (hamstring), James Garner (back) and Tim Iroegbunam (foot) remain on the sidelines. However, all four have received positive news as they bid to make a comeback. “He (Broja) has had a full week’s training but he does need a games programme obviously,” Dyche said. “We’re looking at the dates now as we wanted to ensure he came through his first full week. He said he feels good and feels fit so we’ll introduce a games programme once things align. “Youssef is making good progress as well. He’s slightly behind (Broja) but had his first full day with us today, which was pleasing. “Seamus is on the grass with the medical side, just taking the first steps back. Jimmy has had good news from the specialist but has been out a while and is going to have to be careful in the initial spell. “Tim’s stress response in his foot is clearing up so he can start sort of semi loading again and making sure he starts his progress back.” Dyche also responded to calls for Iliman Ndiaye to be moved into a central role by saying there is “no evidence” the Senegal international should be playing in the No 10 position. GO DEEPER 'Iliman is the inspiration - to be playing for a club like Everton is unbelievable' The £15 million summer signing has impressed since joining from Marseille but has played the bulk of his minutes on the left wing so far. “He’s doing well off the left,” Dyche said. “People keep telling me I should be playing him there. People keep telling me of my role as a manager. “I think he can adapt to Everton. The modern No 10 has to defend from there. Dwight does it very well on the offensive side but has found the defensive side more of a challenge. Advertisement “It’s not as easy as you think getting the right passing lanes to stop the opposition and then attacking on turnovers over 95 minutes. That can be developed over time but he’s doing a good job coming off the left — he can wriggle and drive into the box. He’s still adapting.” Everton are 16th in the Premier League table, three points off the relegation zone.

I’ve always believed I’d dominate on “Supermarket Sweep,” most “Price is Right” games, and that event on “American Gladiators” where they shoot tennis balls at you. Contenders and dumpster fires abound We’re about one month into the 2024-25 season, and so much has happened already. The actual basketball has been phenomenal, even though the injuries have not. We’ve had super compelling stories, both good and bad. So, what should you believe in and what should you dismiss after one month? It’s time to play: Buy or Sell? Advertisement The Cavs are title contenders vs. just contenders: Sell. I’m right on the border with this one. I love what the Cavs (16-1) are doing so far, and we might be devoid of contending options in the East to challenge Boston (12-3). I love what Cleveland did against Boston in the second half Tuesday night. Kenny Atkinson’s offense is intricate and smart. I just need to see more before I believe fully. The Bucks are salvageable: Buy. Mostly because I don’t understand why Milwaukee (6-9) has struggled so much despite Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard being really good this season. Khris Middleton will hopefully be back soon, and then maybe Doc Rivers will be out of excuses. Dalton Knecht is the best rookie so far: Sell. He’s been hot against two bad teams, but we really haven’t seen him do much against the good opponents. Still, the 17th pick out of Tennessee can really shoot that thing for his squad (10-4). Sixers guard Jared McCain has probably been the best rookie so far. It’s a weird class.  The 76ers messed up this summer: Sell. They did what they needed to do with the options available. And perhaps one day it will work out for them during this new era of hoops for the Sixers (league-worst 2-12). However, scroll down to see the latest. Spoiler alert: It’s not great. The Pelicans are in trouble: Buy. I was so high on them coming into the season, and they can’t get even close to healthy. We’re not talking about a couple of injuries. The Pelicans are missing five or six rotation guys most nights. They’re down to 4-12 and 14th in the West. They need health, and they need to get on a big roll to compete for a Play-In spot. The Warriors are contenders: Buy. Even with some frustrating injury news, I love the makeup of this Warriors team (11-3). There are so many similarities to what we saw from them in 2022 when they won it all. They would be my pick to come out of the West right now. Advertisement The injuries are out of control: Buy. According to injury guru Jeff Stotts, the NBA passed 1,000 missed games due to injury or illness after Tuesday night. That happened on Nov. 28 last season. It’s already ruining so many players’ seasons. The Lakers are contenders: Sell. I want to buy into them, and I’m not even saying they can’t get past Denver like the last two seasons. The Lakers’ offense has been stellar after being mediocre last year. However, their defense and rebounding are pretty bad. Can’t contend like that. Khris Middleton should be back soon! 🛞💰 Damon Sayles dominated. Our own Damon Sayles, senior editor for culture/NBA, went on “Wheel of Fortune” last night and destroyed everybody. Get buckets, Damon!  Pretty cool to see @DamonSayles kick butt on @WheelofFortune.

Great defense against elite offense. Ceasing madness around intentional fouls A team is down three, has the ball and is advancing it up the court. Time is ticking away at the end of the fourth quarter, and you are wondering if this team can find a way to tie up the game and get it to overtime. Free basketball on the horizon to settle a close, probably great game! Then, before the star of the team can get into their shooting motion to let it fly, they get intentionally fouled. Why? They’re in the bonus, and you’d rather give up two free-throw attempts than give up a game-tying attempt. Advertisement It’s smart basketball and a good strategy. It’s the right play to make as the team in the lead. It also sucks and ruins the entertainment of the current product on the floor. This seems to be a universal belief among friends of mine — whether they are from the basketball world or just fans of the NBA. It’s the only time you won’t see players look incredulous for a call going against them. Now, instead of all of us watching this shot sail through the air like we’re Carlton Banks, we’re wondering if they know how to intentionally miss the second free throw to hope for a tip-in to tie it. That’s if they make the first one. That isn’t entertainment, and it’s not good basketball. The NBA wants to improve the product, right? They’ve added the take foul in transition situations, but these are take fouls with the game in the balance. The NBA should adopt the intentional foul to remove these situations from the game. We want to see heroic moments. Not the equivalent of extreme couponing with basketball strategy. Defenders should have to make a real play on the ball there, or risk giving up free throws while the losing team retains possession. It’s not hurting the leading team unfairly to make them play a little defense. And it will help the dramatic situations actually get a chance to become legit moments, rather than be an exhibition of accounting on the court. This 76ers isn’t getting any better Finally! The 76ers were going to start Tyrese Maxey, Paul George and Joel Embiid together. After a rough 2-11 start, the light at the end of the tunnel was no longer starting to look like an oncoming train. And then they played in Memphis last night. The 76ers were down by as many as 19 in the fourth quarter before a bit of a comeback to make the 117-111 loss look more respectable. After 17 minutes on the court, Paul George hyperextended his left knee. Again. You might remember he did that about a month ago and missed some time. Embiid had 35 points and 11 rebounds, and the Sixers were plus-seven with him on the floor. It was the first good game he’s had this season, and he had some things to say afterward. But the Sixers still can’t figure out how to play good basketball for extended stretches on the court. Wednesday night, Joel Embiid said that he heard the criticism from Tyrese Maxey during a recent team meeting. He made it clear that he is accountable for those actions. And that he didn’t like the details leaking into the public. ✍️ @tjonesonthenbahttps://t.co/N5xxyOoJWh pic.twitter.com/2IuLEvXuYt — The Athletic (@TheAthletic) November 21, 2024  They couldn’t slow down Jaren Jackson Jr., Desmond Bane and Jaylen Wells. No Ja Morant? No problem. Memphis has Scotty Pippen Jr. and Jay Huff. Philadelphia is 15th in the East and a half-game behind the Washington Wizards. The 76ers do owe their pick to the OKC Thunder (like everybody else), but at least it’s top-six protected. Advertisement Bucks 122 (6-9), Bulls 106 (6-10): Giannis Antetokounmpo decided he’d had enough. He had 25 of his 41 points in the third quarter and enjoyed 16-of-20 shooting … in the paint! He had 32 points in the paint by himself. The Bulls had 34 points in the paint as a team. Antetokounmpo made 17 of 24 overall and had nine rebounds and eight assists to survive a strong push by Chicago. Zach LaVine looked good with 27 points. Cavs 128 (16-1), Pelicans 100 (4-12): Time to start a new streak! After the Cavs lost their win streak Tuesday, they beat up on an injured Pelicans squad to get back on track. Ty Jerome got the start in place of Darius Garland and led the team with 29 points. And yes, that box score is correct: Elfrid Payton started for the Pels. He hadn’t played since 2022. Rockets 130 (11-5), Pacers 113 (6-9): These are not the Pacers you expect. They had 23 turnovers and just shot 5 of 22 from 3-point range. The reason? Houston does that to you. The Rockets won again to remain fourth in the West behind 31 points and 12 rebounds by Alperen Şengün. Jabari Smith Jr. added 23, while Tyrese Haliburton had another bad one. Four points on 1-of-7 shooting with eight assists. Thunder 109 (12-4), Blazers 99 (6-9): Isaiah Hartenstein made his OKC debut, and it was a good one. It was also much needed. Hartenstein had 13 points, 14 rebounds and four blocks to help hold off a scrappy Portland squad. Shaedon Sharpe had 21, but it wasn’t enough to overcome 30 from Jalen Williams and 28 from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Knicks 138 (9-6), Suns 122 (9-7): The Suns dropped their fifth straight and badly need Kevin Durant back. Warriors 120 (11-3), Hawks 97 (7-9): This was another dominant defensive effort by the Warriors. They held the Hawks to 33.3 percent shooting from the field and 26.1 percent from deep. Andrew Wiggins led them with 27 points. Clippers 104 (9-7), Magic 93 (9-7): The Clippers, sans Norman Powell, dominated the Magic to snap Orlando’s six-game win streak. James Harden picked up the scoring slack with 24 points. (Top photo: Brian Babineau / Getty Images ) Zach Harper  is a staff writer for The Athletic, covering the NBA.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Cowboys Today: DaRon Bland's mysterious injury situation and Dante Fowler's impact,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936956/2024/11/21/cowboys-today-daron-bland-injury-update-dante-fowler-commanders/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 14:30:31 GMT","Bland was injured in training camp and is working his way back, but still hasn't played. Dallas will see a familiar face Sunday in D.C.","NFL Dallas Cowboys All-Pro cornerback DaRon Bland was listed as a full practice participant on Wednesday’s injury report. Bland’s situation has prompted many questions, many of which echo the sentiment: “What exactly is going on?” Here’s the rundown of Bland’s situation and how to follow the mysterious nature of it. The Cowboys hope it is met with positive clarity this week. Advertisement Bland suffered a stress fracture in his foot at the end of training camp and he began the regular season on injured reserve. The expected timeline for Bland to return was six-to-eight weeks. Six weeks would have put his return around the game in Pittsburgh on Oct. 6. Eight weeks would have had him around the bye week, the weekend of Oct. 20. His return appeared to be right on schedule. The Cowboys designated him to return on Oct. 9, opening his 21-day practice window the week leading into the home game against the Detroit Lions. That day, Bland was a full participant in a Wednesday practice. The next day (Oct. 10), Bland was again a full participant. At that point, the conversation was trending more toward how much Bland would play against the Lions, rather than if he’d play at all. GO DEEPER Six reasons why this Cowboys season is a disaster That Friday, Bland was listed as a “DNP (did not practice) on the final injury report of the week. His game status was officially listed as questionable. It’s important to point out that the Friday practice in which he did not participate was not an actual practice; it was a walk-through, therefore his DNP label was an estimation. This means Bland didn’t suffer a setback during the practice itself but that his foot did not react favorably that Friday morning to the two days of full practice before it. Bland was listed as a DNP in practice for the next five weeks. The Cowboys added him to the active roster on Oct. 30, but only because his 21-day return-to-play window had expired, so the option was to either bring him on the 53-man roster or revert him to IR and lose him for the year. Fast forward to this week: Bland was listed as a full participant Wednesday. It’s important to note that Wednesday was not an actual practice for the Cowboys but it was a walk-through, so Bland’s designation as a full participant is an estimation. It’s still encouraging news, because it means that the soreness in Bland’s foot is much improved, if not completely resolved, but recent history suggests to be careful before jumping to conclusions. The Cowboys practice Thursday, with Bland expected to participate. How he’s listed Friday will be very important. Advertisement If he is cleared to return to the field, it will be a significant boost to the Cowboys’ secondary, which has missed Bland dearly and also was without slot cornerback Jourdan Lewis last week (Lewis said he hopes to return this week). The Cowboys play the Commanders on the road Sunday. The game will be played on the FedEx Field surface, which has frequently been criticized by players for the risk of injury. To give you an idea of how dire the Cowboys’ sack production has been this season, defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence is tied for second on the team in sacks with three. Lawrence hasn’t played since Sept. 26. The Cowboys’ leader in that department is linebacker DeMarvion Overshown, with four sacks. Veteran Carl Lawson and Micah Parsons, who missed four games due to injury, are tied with Lawrence with three sacks apiece. Meanwhile, Dante Fowler leads the Commanders through 11 games with 8 1/2 sacks. He spent the last two seasons in Dallas and followed Dan Quinn to Washington this past offseason. Dorance Armstrong, the Cowboys’ 2018 fourth-round pick who also followed Quinn to Washington, has three. Armstrong spent his first six seasons in the NFL in Dallas, tallying 5 sacks in 2021, 8 1/2 in 2022 and 7 1/2 sacks in 2023. It wouldn’t be fair to make this comparison involving Fowler and Armstrong without mentioning the impact of the Cowboys’ injuries. Dallas let those two veterans walk in free agency because they believed Sam Williams was ready to make the jump as a premier pass rusher this season. They drafted Marshawn Kneeland to also be part of that rotation, featuring Parsons and Lawrence. Williams tore his ACL in training camp and was ruled out for the season. Lawrence has played four of the 10 games and a return is not imminent. Parsons missed four games. Kneeland has has spent the last five games on IR, though the Cowboys did open his 21-day window Wednesday. Kneeland was listed as a limited participant in Wednesday’s practice and has the potential to play against the Commanders. GO DEEPER Cowboys' offensive roster questions for final 7 games: Trey Lance's value to be determined Quarterback Dak Prescott had surgery in New York last week to repair the hamstring he injured in Atlanta on Nov. 3. Prescott was on crutches but in the building at AT&T Stadium on Sunday for the Cowboys’ game against the Houston Texans. Head coach Mike McCarthy said it was unclear if Prescott would be permitted to travel with the team at this stage in his recovery, so his presence at road games is unknown, for the time being.

Undav, 28, suffered the injury in training on Wednesday and is not expected to play again until after the winter break, following an MRI scan. The Germany international is in his second season at Stuttgart having initially joined on loan in 2023 from Brighton & Hove Albion, scoring 18 goals in 30 Bundesliga games in his first season as Sebastian Hoeness’s side rose from a 16th-placed finish in 2022-23 to second and Champions League qualification last campaign. Advertisement Undav also became a Germany international and was included in Julian Nagelsmann’s squad for the recent European Championship. He made his move permanent over the summer, signing for €32.6million (£28m) and becoming the most expensive arrival in Stuttgart’s history. Hoeness’s Stuttgart suffered significant losses over the summer. Serhou Guirassy, who scored 28 goals last season and with whom combined so well in attack, was sold to Borussia Dortmund. Waldemar Anton, the lynchpin centre-back, moved to Dortmund, too, significantly weakening the defence. Stuttgart are currently 11th in the Bundesliga, having won just three games. While their Champions League performances have been admirable and have featured an impressive display against Real Madrid and an unlikely win over Juventus in Turin, they have taken just four points from four games and are currently outside of the qualification places for the play-off round. GO DEEPER Deniz Undav is good enough for Germany - so should Brighton have let him leave? Undav has still been vital, though. Top scorer with six goals in all competitions, he has helped to shoulder the responsibility following Guirassy’s departure, as well as becoming a key part of the side’s intricate attacking build-up and lessening the burden on fellow centre-forward, Ermedin Demirovic. Undav scored his first international goal for Germany in September’s 2-2 draw with the Netherlands. Since leaving Brighton, he has become a much more rounded player — creative, as well as a goal-threat — and so this is a blow that Stuttgart could have done without. The league fixture list between now and the end of the year is forgiving, with Hoeness and his players not facing any of the current top six. They will be without Undav for a tricky-looking trip to Belgrade to face Crvena Zvezda in the Champions League, though, and what looks like a must-win game against Young Boys at home.

Advertisement “I got with my inner circle of guys that I make these decisions with, we talked about different people, and we came back to Drew as being the proper candidate to move forward with,” Blues general manager Doug Armstrong said at the time. “We’re excited to have him here. I thought he did a very good job in a difficult situation last year and now having a full training camp and a two-year term to put his stamp on this team, we’re looking forward to that.” Fast forward six months and the landscape has changed, especially in Boston. After an 8-9-3 start, the Bruins fired Montgomery, who was in the final year of a three-year contract. So after going 120-41-23 in Boston and winning the Jack Adams Award as the NHL’s top coach in 2023, he’s available. Meanwhile in St. Louis, the Blues are 8-11-1 heading into their matchup with the San Jose Sharks on Thursday and just 1-5-1 in their last seven games. They’re having trouble scoring goals (29th in the league) and preventing them (28th). Following the team’s 4-2 loss to Minnesota Wild on Tuesday, Bannister said, “We did some good things, and there’s things we have to correct. We’ve got to find ways to win hockey games. Right now, whether the bounces are going for us, we’ve got to work for those bounces to go our way.” As soon as I posted Bannister’s postgame remarks on social media, the replies came fast and furious — more furious. Fire Bannister, hire Montgomery. I’m not going tell fans how to feel, and at this point, I have no idea what the Blues are thinking. But with the current state of the club, which has led to this speculation just two months into Bannister’s full-time tenure, I want to refresh everyone on how general manager Doug Armstrong has said he views the retool. I think this exercise will help provide some context to the on-ice decisions that have been made this season. And it could also provide us with some context to the off-ice decision the organization will make regarding the coach. Advertisement This is a retool, right? Well, it was. The Blues acknowledged it last season, and fans have come to grips with it — some even welcoming it. But the tone seemed to change in training camp when Armstrong addressed the media. I went back Wednesday and listened to his press conference from September when the additions of Philip Broberg and Dylan Holloway via offseason offer sheets and the possibility of Dalibor Dvorský and Zach Bolduc making the opening-night roster was still fresh. “We’ve changed the outlook of our team,” Armstrong said then. “We have a lot (of) NHL-caliber players that have a lot of experience at a young age in our group right now. I think we’re at a good spot now where we expect to compete. “I think we have a chance to be a highly competitive team. I know they’re ready for the challenge to get back and push with the teams that were ahead of them last year and become part of that group. I think we can do that.” Make no mistake, Armstrong wanted to compete this season. You don’t ask your owners to spend to the NHL’s $88 million salary cap (and beyond with injuries) and make decisions with the notion that missing the postseason is OK. That’s why Pavel Buchnevich started the season playing center, not on the wing where he’ll likely play out the remainder of his six-year, $48 million extension that will kick in next season. He’s there because Armstrong took note of the Blues’ .600-plus point percentage last season when Buchnevich was playing in the middle and that could help the club make the postseason. But now, after two months of Buchnevich looking out of place at center and his production on the wing giving the Blues a better chance for success, he’s in fact back on the wing. That’s why Jordan Kyrou was not on the ice for the final four minutes of regulation in last week’s 4-3 overtime loss to the Buffalo Sabres. After two glaring turnovers by Kyrou that potentially cost the Blues points against the Philadelphia Flyers and Utah Hockey Club, Bannister chose to put Oskar Sundqvist in Kyrou’s spot down the stretch. Sure the coach decides who’s on the ice, but he does so based on the GM’s priorities for the season, and Kyrou not being on the ice in those situations, as opposed to learning how to handle them, should tell us something. Advertisement That’s why Bolduc, 21, isn’t a lock to be in the Blues’ lineup every night. The 2021 first-round pick has played in 15 of the team’s 20 games and was a healthy scratch in the other five. Now you could make the case that Bolduc should be playing every night in AHL Springfield and developing in the minors, but my point is, if there was any question about whether Armstrong wants to win now, the fact that Bolduc isn’t suiting up if the Blues don’t think he can help them get them a ‘W’ is another strong sign. Which leads us to this question: If Armstrong is that focused on the Blues being competitive this season, and making the playoffs this season, would he really replace Bannister with Montgomery? After just 54 games as the interim coach and 20-odd more this season? He might. He did it in 2012 when he fired Davis Payne after just 13 games (6-7) and replaced him with Ken Hitchcock, who went on to win the second-most games in Blues’ history (248) behind Joel Quenneville (307). Interestingly, during training camp this year, Armstrong likened the Blues’ roster and situation to the “2010-11, 2011-12” era, just before they dismissed Payne. We know how much Armstrong likes Montgomery, being the first to hire him back in the NHL as an assistant coach in 2020 after he was fired by the Dallas Stars due to “unprofessional conduct.” Players such as Buchnevich and Robert Thomas were disappointed when he left for the job in Boston, but knew it was best for his career to land another head coaching job with an Original Six club. But after a pair of amazing regular seasons and two early playoff exits, Montgomery didn’t get to see December in his third year with the Bruins. He’ll assuredly pop up somewhere, and The Athletic mentioned four possible destinations: St. Louis, Montreal, Detroit and Pittsburgh. Former Blues and current Maple Leafs coach Craig Berube vouched for him Wednesday. Advertisement “I know Monty personally,” Berube said. “We brought him into St. Louis to work with us for a couple years and he was fantastic. He’s a very intelligent coach on both sides of the puck. I think him coming into St. Louis, I found Monty was very, very responsible on the defensive side of things. He actually ran our (penalty kill) that year and it was very good. Very good on that side of things.” Whether the Blues hiring Montgomery and moving on from Bannister becomes reality or remains a rumor, the remote possibility would be a very raw deal for Bannister. In 74 games with a retooling roster, he’s 38-30-6. His club went a stretch of 12 games recently without arguably its two best players in Broberg and Thomas. There aren’t many coaches, if any, who could’ve forged a better record under these circumstances. The ultimate decision would undoubtedly include Armstrong and Alexander Steen, the GM-in-waiting who will take over after the 2025-26 season. Are the Blues building for then, or do they want to be in the playoffs by then? If they want to be in the postseason, would a change help? We are about three weeks shy of when Armstrong fired Berube on Dec. 14. While going back and re-listening to Armstrong’s interviews from earlier this year, I came across this comment when asked about continuity in the coaching ranks. “I think all managers and team owners would say the same thing: you want continuity as much as possible, but sometimes it’s just not possible,” Armstrong said. “If you look at the number of changes in the coaching fraternity over the last 36 months, I’m personally not sure this is healthy, but it seems to be a trend that we’re on now. I do believe in longevity if you can build relationships and go through it. For some reason, our industry isn’t working that way, and I hope it does change.” Will Armstrong stick with Bannister, or will Montgomery’s availability make it “just not possible?” If the GM believes the Blues will be more competitive this year and better in the long term, a reunion may not be out of the question.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How longtime catcher Sal Fasano will help restructure the Angels' 2025 pitching plans,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935567/2024/11/21/angels-pitching-coach-sal-fasano/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 13:00:29 GMT",Fasano — who won a World Series with the Angels for playing two games in 2002 — will be something of a jack-of-all-trades as a coach.,"MLB When Sal Fasano got a call this offseason from Los Angeles Angels general manager Perry Minasian, it wasn’t the first time. Fasano had just been fired from the job that Minasian first established for him with the Atlanta Braves seven years ago. “He said (in 2017), ‘Hey, I want to make a job for you,’” the longtime big-league catcher and coach recalled recently. “‘I want you to work with the catchers … but you’re going to help with the pitching and do all the game plan stuff.’” Advertisement “It’s funny how things work,” he added. “Being let go by Atlanta, the first guy who calls me is Perry.” Fasano’s title with the Angels will be assistant pitching coach; the team will have a pitching coach, bullpen coach, and Fasano somewhere in between. Minasian hopes that a connection dating back to their days in the Toronto Blue Jays organization can boost a pitching staff in desperate need of improvement. “He’s outstanding with arms and with pitching in general,” Minasian said. “I can go on and on about really quality pitching coaches that were at the catcher position. They look at things in a different way.” Fasano — who won a World Series with the Angels for playing two games in 2002 — will be something of a jack-of-all-trades on the team’s coaching staff more than two decades later. He’ll work closely with head of game planning Alex Cultice. He’ll work with catchers, in the context of how they work with pitchers. And he’ll also be front-facing with the pitchers themselves. Fasano said he expects to communicate with catchers and pitchers in-game, and work directly with the team’s analytics department. While it’s not common, it’s also not unprecedented for catchers to become pitching coaches. The most notable example is the legendary Dave Duncan, who was a pitching coach for three World Series champions and four Cy Young award winners. Charlie Greene, the Milwaukee Brewers’ bullpen coach, also spent his playing days behind the plate. “The one thing with never pitching is it’s a double-edged sword,” Fasano said. “It’s good and bad. I’ve never felt what you’ve felt, but I’ve caught a million dudes like you. I’ve seen a lot of guys pitch the way you do.” The Angels were not an effective pitching team in 2024, by almost every measure. They ranked 26th in ERA (4.56). They were 29th in walks (601), ahead of only the historically awful Chicago White Sox. And they were 28th in home runs allowed (202). Advertisement First-year pitching coach Barry Enright’s work was highly regarded throughout the season, but the pitchers struggled and were unable to execute a plan to improve in 0-0 and 1-1 counts. As a whole, the Angels are refining their strategies. And part of that is adding people like Fasano, and backup catcher Travis d’Arnaud, who both worked with a Braves pitching staff that was among the best in baseball last year. “It just didn’t get accomplished,” Enright said of his own team’s strike-throwing last year. “So I’m welcoming guys coming in to help me re-message. Help me be able to apply our strengths a little bit better into our game plan.” Both Enright and Fasano acknowledged that it can be difficult for pitchers to focus on generating swing-and-miss, while also preaching strike-throwing early in the counts. That can lead to pitchers attempting to become “too fine.” Fasano said he hopes to help simplify things for pitchers and take some of the pressure off their batterymates. Enright said that this season, he wants to create more individualized messages and strategies for each pitcher, particularly in the bullpen. He hopes to bridge the gap between the mound work, training room and weight room, something he said will take more manpower. Enright also felt that pitchers were chasing swing-and-miss more, and never established the command that necessitates generating swing-and-miss. “It’s just getting those guys to get into an attack mode, getting the catchers not to be paranoid of, ‘Oh my gosh, this is the guy’s hot spot. I’ve got to be careful of it,’” Fasano said. “And getting those guys to understand how to get to the soft zones of the hitters, still within the strengths of our pitchers.” After the 2023 season, the Angels completely revamped their pitching strategies. The team found a new pitching coach and replaced many of its pitching experts on the player development side, choosing to focus on what they’ve deemed is a more holistic approach rather than strictly on analytics. Advertisement Earlier this offseason, former assistant pitching coach Bill Hezel left the organization to be the Marlins’ director of pitching, per a league source — the last bastion of the old pitching regime departing. The team hopes that a continuity of their message, however, combined with some refining and the addition of Fasano can create a culture on the mound that far exceeds its very bad 2024 campaign. “Adding Sal, and being able to take some things, delegate some of these areas — I think Sal will do a heck of a job sprinkling his personality and experience in every one of these areas,” Enright said.

Head coach Enzo Maresca has revealed that 24-year-old James sustained a minor hamstring problem during training on Tuesday. This is the ninth time James has been ruled out with a hamstring injury in the past five years. He went 18 months without completing 90 minutes in the Premier League between April 2023-October 2024 and had surgery last December in a bid to cure it for good. Advertisement But James has made just three starts for the club this campaign and is now facing another spell on the sidelines. Maresca said: “We have just one injured player and that is Reece, who unfortunately felt something small and we don’t want to take any risks for the weekend. He is the only one (right now) who is for sure not available this weekend. It’s a hamstring, a muscle problem. Hopefully it is not something long.” Chelsea play Heidenheim in the UEFA Conference League next Thursday and Maresca is already suggesting James will not be able to return for that fixture. Maresca says James’ lack of availability is more frustrating for him and added: “I know that it is not easy (for him). But if every time he gets injured it becomes hard for him, it’s for me even worse. “He has to accept that and try to avoid (injury) as much as he can. But sometimes things happen even if you want to avoid it. “Now we are playing every three days so it is probably difficult for him to be available for the Conference League. Hopefully he can be available soon.” GO DEEPER Reece James: Captain, leader, left-back The injury may have been initially described as ‘minor’ but the news that Reece James is complaining of another hamstring problem is another significant blow for the 24-year-old. James is regarded as one of the best right backs in Europe but his career has stalled since being part of the Chelsea squad which won the Champions League in 2021 — due to his volume of fitness issues. For example, the defender was on the pitch for just 482 minutes in all competitions for Chelsea last season. He has started just three games under Enzo Maresca in 2024-25 and the first of those only came last month after breaking down in pre-season. After making his comeback, Maresca warned that James is capable of only playing “once a week” for the time being. But even though his minutes have been managed, it has not prevented another issue from occurring. Advertisement James is already facing strong competition from Malo Gusto to play regularly in a Chelsea shirt. In the club’s previous fixture against Arsenal, he was named on the bench with Marc Cucurella and Gusto starting at full back. While Maresca clearly wants to include James in his plans, it is clearly not a good situation for Chelsea to be without their captain on a regular basis.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Joel Embiid on latest criticism, Sixers drama: 'Feels like negativity keeps following me'",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936953/2024/11/21/joel-embiid-sixers-team-meeting/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:56:00 GMT","Embiid said reports of the meeting, during which his tardiness was questioned by Tyrese Maxey, were overblown.","NBA MEMPHIS, Tenn. — Joel Embiid wasn’t visibly angry. His voice didn’t drip with disappointment, or some over-the-top emotion. His tone was very matter-of-fact when addressing the media following the Philadelphia 76ers’ 117-111 loss to the Grizzlies on Wednesday night. In his first public comments since Monday night’s team meeting, in which guard Tyrese Maxey spoke to Embiid about being tardy to team functions, and Tuesday’s reports of that meeting. Embiid made it clear that he heard the criticism from his teammate, who is also a good friend. He made it clear that he is accountable for those actions and plans to improve going forward. He also made it clear that he didn’t like the details of the meeting spilling into public. Advertisement “Whoever leaked that is a real piece of s—,” Embiid said. “We talked about a lot of things. I don’t want to get into detail. But that whole thing, that part of it, took probably 40 seconds. But it’s Joel Embiid, so things will always get blown out of proportion. It’s whatever, though. I’ll take it. I’m the reason for everything, so I guess I’ll take the blame for everything. “There was nothing malicious being said. I like when people are telling me when I’m not doing good and when I need to be better. That part of it (tardiness) probably happened once or twice when I wasn’t playing. So I need to be better. I need to be perfect. I need to be on point, which I’m going to do.” The frustration for Embiid comes from a culmination of events piling up in a young season that’s threatening to go further off the rails. This includes everything from his murky injury status at the beginning of the year to his three-game suspension for an altercation with a reporter, which combined to keep him off the court for Philly’s first nine games. The 76ers (2-12) are 14 games into a season they thought would allow them to compete for a championship, and in Embiid’s eyes, most of the talk around the team includes anything but actual basketball. Embiid said he thought the details of Monday’s team meeting were overblown. Not that they weren’t true. He doesn’t dispute that. But more that the conversation in the meeting was typical of teammates holding each other accountable. Embiid and Maxey have a close friendship, on and off the floor. And, indeed, following Wednesday night’s loss in Memphis, they spent a good chunk of time talking to each other in the locker room, while eating a pile of chicken wings. They have a level of friendship where they can criticize each other, if the need should arise. Advertisement What Embiid clearly didn’t like was that he had to answer for a conversation that he felt should have remained private. And the fact that it led to more questions that he needed to talk about didn’t sit well with him. “It’s kind of annoying, having to deal with the same things over and over and over,” Embiid said. “All I am trying to do is focus on basketball and be the best I can be for my family, on and off the court. But for some reason, it just feels like negativity keeps following me, which I don’t understand why. It’s a shame, but it doesn’t change the fact that we still have to do better as a team. “Right now, we don’t have a lot of margin for error.”  Of that, there is no doubt. Philadelphia’s season is teetering on the brink. The Sixers lost their fifth consecutive game on Wednesday night. They have the worst record in the NBA. They lost star wing Paul George to a hyperextended left knee, the same knee he injured during the preseason. They lost in the same way they had much of the season: turnovers, missed shots and missed assignments at inopportune times on both sides of the floor. George will be evaluated further on Thursday, but the hope is that he escaped serious injury and that everything is structurally sound with the knee. But it’s just another in a long line of maladies for the Sixers this season. For Philadelphia, whatever could go wrong has seemingly gone wrong. Wednesday night was the first time this season Embiid, George and Maxey were on the floor at the same time, although Maxey’s minutes were substantially limited after he missed six games with a strained right hamstring. Potentially losing George, even if for a limited amount of time, looms as another potential roadblock. George walked out of the locker room Wednesday night with a moderate limp. Advertisement “It sucks,” Maxey said. “I know how it feels to be hurt and to not be able to be out there and help your team. So, I definitely feel badly for Paul.” On Thursday, George echoed Embiid’s sentiments that meetings like the one the 76ers had were common, and reaction to details of the meeting being leaked to the public were being overblown. “The whole meeting, that’s normal in the NBA. Teams go through that. I’ve been on multiple teams where we’ll at some point have a meeting and a check-in if things aren’t going right or if we know we could be playing better and we’re trying to get the most out of one another. That’s normal,” George said on his podcast, “Podcast P with Paul George.” “It was healthy. It was a positive conversation. It was a healthy conversation. We all just want the best,” George said. Embiid, for his part, played his best game of the season, scoring 35 points and grabbing 11 rebounds. He made shots. He played at a good pace. He defended better than he had in his previous games. For the first time this season, he looked like Joel Embiid. The Sixers are looking for any sliver to hang on to. And once again, they have to go back to a drawing board in a season they need to figure out how to turn around. “We can still compete for a championship,” Embiid said. “But this is going to take time. A lot of our issues are coming from us not being on the same page. We have a lot of talent, but we still have to go out and actually do it. We have a pretty good chance; it would be a pretty good story if we did win. It’s just hard. You get a player back and then you potentially lose one. But whatever my body allows me to do, I’m going to go out and do it.” (Photo: Petre Thomas / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Stadium plans, Mitchell’s role and Eales’ health: An evening with Newcastle’s executives",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935146/2024/11/21/eales-mitchell-stadium-newcastle/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:53:45 GMT",Chris Waugh analyses the key takeaways as a host of Newcastle's decision makers address supporters,"EPL Communication has been a persistent theme at Newcastle United. Under Mike Ashley, there was a vacuum of information. Post-takeover, the club’s ownership have been more open. Although Amanda Staveley departed during the summer, senior figures have continued to speak. Darren Eales, the CEO, and Paul Mitchell, the sporting director, both chatted last summer. Advertisement On Wednesday, that duo were joined at STACK fan zone outside St James’ Park, by Peter Silverstone, the chief commercial officer (CCO), Brad Miller, the chief operating officer (COO), and Simon Capper, the chief financial officer (CFO). Thousands of fans were present for the “We Are United” fan event, either in person or via video. The hierarchy spoke for an hour, answering questions about Eales’ health, the search for a new CEO, Mitchell’s relationship with head coach Eddie Howe, recruitment, the future of St James’ and more. The Athletic’s Chris Waugh outlines the key takeaways. Eales spoke first about his health, following news of his chronic blood cancer diagnosis in September. “I’m doing great, thanks,” Eales said. “It’s incredible, the support I got from fans. I want to say thank you. I’m trying to take the positives.” A spontaneous round of applause followed, before Eales was asked about the timeframe for his departure and the search for his successor. He confirmed that the owners — Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) hold an 85 per cent majority stake and the Reuben family have the remaining 15 per cent — are leading that recruitment process. Former Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham has been linked, but suggestions he has been identified as the next chief executive appear premature. “I’ve got a notice period, so the intention is it’s ‘business as usual’,” Eales said. “The idea was to give that notice so we can do a search and that’s going to be led by ownership. It’s to find the best person possible and to give them the best transition so that they can hit the ground running.” At the end, Eales also received the loudest applause, with fans grateful for his dedication, despite his diagnosis. It felt like Mitchell had been waiting for this moment, given the aftermath of his media briefing in early September, when the sporting director questioned whether elements of Newcastle’s recruitment strategy had been “fit for purpose”. He did reassert his claim that he followed a “predetermined (recruitment) strategy” that was already in place, rather than leading an initial shift in direction. Advertisement “I’ve had an interesting start, I have to be honest,” Mitchell smirked, admitting that you do not want to arrive during a transfer window, as he did in July. “I’m actually 21… I looked a lot better pre-July!” A word Mitchell repeated several times was “collaboration”. Howe has regularly said the same and Mitchell did not shy away from the topic. Instead, he gave a few jibes at some of the coverage, admitting he is “not a big fan” of media and social media. “You know, I was enjoying ‘Eddie and Paul watch’ in September,” Mitchell joked, referring to questions posed towards Howe in press conferences. “‘Have they spoken to each other today?’ I actually thought that was quite good.” After his light-hearted answer, Mitchell did tackle what he accepts is a serious subject, given Howe went public with his concerns about “boundaries” in July. Mitchell praised Howe’s qualities, insisting he is “definitely” among the “talented head coaches” the sporting director has worked with across Europe. He was also complimentary about the playing style, stating that he believes it “mirrors us as a club and a fanbase”. The sporting director sees his role as working with Howe in “an intelligent way” so that Newcastle can “become competitive at the top end of the Premier League, where we want to be, and get back into Europe”. “We work closely, it’s natural collaboration,” Mitchell said. “He’s the head coach and I’m the sporting director. The notion that we live in each other’s pockets, that we spend every waking hour in each other’s company, is wrong. “Eddie is an elite professional and it would be remiss of me or any sporting director to be looking over his shoulder, to be on the training pitch, to be micromanaging someone who is extremely talented at what he does. “My job is to support, to challenge, discuss, debate — all for the benefit of the club. But we have a very talented head coach and our collaboration is as frequent or as infrequent as it needs to be… “But I have other responsibilities as well. My job is short, medium and long-term. So, unfortunately, as much as the myth of the media, and as much as I would like to, I can’t hold hands with Eddie every day. But we had the luxury of doing that at the boxing in Saudi Arabia recently (when footage captured the pair sitting together).” Advertisement The additional responsibilities he referenced included supporting the academy and the women’s team, and recruitment. He quipped that it is “my job to make those guys’ lives a living nightmare”, pointing at the panel. Alongside stressing that he was “fortunate to a degree” because of the platform he inherited, Mitchell doubled down on his view that alterations must be made to recruitment. Given the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules (PSR), he intends to tweak Newcastle’s transfer approach, implying he would look to sign younger players. “We have to continue to develop players to enhance our revenue streams because that’s how we’re going to get to where we want to as quickly as possible,” Mitchell said. “The trading model has become an important element of the modern game.” Returning to the theme of Howe and who holds the authority — and the ultimate say on incomings — Mitchell tried to myth-bust. He has not, and will not, force any players on the head coach, he insists. “Contrary to common belief, I don’t make the final decision on player trading,” Mitchell said. “No sporting director does, just to put that out there. It’s a collaborative approach. “Every sporting director and head coach, they collaborate in the final decision. We have to get a higher percentage right and make good decisions for the short, medium and long term. And that’s what we intend to do.” Interestingly, Mitchell also revealed the message he regularly repeats to his employees. He said, “I tell them: ‘Now it’s about going from good to great.’ We have super-high ambitions. We have to move forward and be aggressive.” There was a constant running theme throughout, which every panel member addressed. “I know we hate the term ‘PSR’, but it’s what we have to work to,” Eales said. “It’s unforgiving for us. We’re walking on a tightrope.” The CEO reaffirmed the ownership’s willingness to spend up to the club’s maximum, but stressed Newcastle are hindered by their present PSR limitations. He praised Howe for achieving what he has “with the backdrop of PSR” and admitted that there will be peaks and troughs. Advertisement “We can’t always do it in one window,” Eales said, seemingly referencing the summer. “We’ll have natural ebbs and flows.” That is where Silverstone’s role is crucial. As CCO, he is looking to rapidly expand revenue streams. “We need to grow quicker across different areas, it is relentless and it never stops,” Silverstone said, wearing a retro hoodie made by Adidas – a partnership he kept referencing. A proponent of STACK, Silverstone joked that it was “the only nightclub I’d like to go to” and that “we’re drinking away our PSR troubles because every pound we make goes into Paul’s transfer kitty”. While that was an intended exaggeration, a key reason behind the fan zone was to increase revenues on matchdays and non-matchdays. Highlighting trips to Japan, the U.S. and Saudi, Silverstone also suggested Newcastle will continue to look outwards in their pursuit of new commercial opportunities. “We have to project everything we do globally,” he said. For so-called ‘legacy fans’, that might be unpalatable. But in the era of ‘super clubs’, Newcastle can only realise their ambitions by first massively bolstering their revenue. “PSR is delicate and complicated for us in particular,” Mitchell said, admitting he “probably underestimated that coming in”. Mitchell also commended Howe, Eales and the recruitment team for somehow managing to avoid a points deduction in June, despite Newcastle’s perilous PSR position, because it has provided him with a platform from which to build. PSR was the reason that Capper — the self-described “bean counter” — was there. He explained that his role is to “support by providing the best team we can afford”, which he believes will require fresh thinking once the present PSR system changes to a “revenue-based model”, as is proposed from next season. Although many supporters might be sick of reading about PSR — and even sceptical about its effects — the hierarchy were keen to emphasise that it remains an ongoing impediment. The PSR message segued into the stadium question, which was the evening’s hottest topic. Rather than brush over the subject, Miller used the event to conduct a non-binding and unofficial referendum. He admitted that it was not about comparing “apples with apples” but “apples with pears” and offered up two apparently hypothetical options for fans to choose. The implication was that Newcastle have narrowed down options during a year-long feasibility study. Advertisement Seemingly two of the most serious considerations which are being further explored are “transforming” St James’ so that it looks “amazing” and “earns significantly more money”, or moving close by, to a venue which potentially has “a lot more seats” and has “the potential to earn more than twice as much revenue”. This offered the strongest hint yet that Newcastle are “seriously” considering moving nearby — Leazes Park, which is next door, is reportedly an alternative site — as opposed to an expensive redevelopment of St James’, with the increased revenue on “matchday and non-matchday” that avenue’s rationale. Miller laughed off suggestions Newcastle will be moving far afield, such as to Murrayfield, in Edinburgh, even temporarily. “If we were to move — and it wouldn’t be that far away — we weren’t looking to stretch the elastic band and the connection to the city to the point of breaking,” Miller said. The panel stressed that no decision has been made, with Eales insisting the club remain open-minded and that it is “absolutely imperative” that it will be “a fan-led decision”. The club’s Fan Advisory Board (FAB) will be consulted and wider opinion will be canvassed, but for now they continue to “develop the options”. Importantly, Eales responded to suggestions PIF is losing interest and that it might opt against providing the finance required to renovate St James’ or build a new stadium. “Absolutely (they are committed to financing it), the ownership have been incredible,” Eales said, pointing to the latest £35million ($44.4m) cash injection via a single-share issue. “They’re behind us, but we want to make the right decision and so we’ve got to flesh out what we’re going to do, present a business case, and it has to make sense for what we’re trying to do.” There were also little indicators, which were not fleshed out, that further infrastructure projects, inside the club and around the city, might be announced soon. Miller explained that his role overseeing infrastructure investments involves the stadium, the training ground, the academy and “our future plans”. He did not directly reference a new training ground, but plans to recalibrate the present site are being explored, and the long-proposed idea is that Newcastle will build a state-of-the-art facility elsewhere. Advertisement Capper, meanwhile, was asked whether infrastructure spending is exempt from PSR calculations. He replied that it was complicated, but “it’s mostly outside”. He continued: “This (STACK) is an example of the type of thing we’re looking at across the business in terms of investing capital to generate more revenue from the club going forward. We’ve got some exciting pipeline ideas. A lot of them are not quite ready to share, but they are bubbling under. And hopefully, over the next few months, we’ll be revealing a bit more about how we grow the revenue by investing in Newcastle and this club.” The implication is that Newcastle are looking at investing beyond the footprint of the stadium and into the wider city.

Plus: Homegrown player data and pundit ratings,"The Athletic FC ⚽ is The Athletic’s daily football (or soccer, if you prefer) newsletter. Sign up to receive it directly to your inbox. Hello! Always be wary of Premier League managers talking about team news. On the way: 😇 The truth about injury updates 📺 Who has the best pundits? 👦 Man Utd top for young talent ⛔ A very short managerial reign The Premier League is back on the agenda today with a flurry of pre-match press conferences — and there will be one thing on everybody’s minds. After a two-week international break, where players have limped out of fixtures, left national team camps early to be assessed, or withdrawn from squads entirely, injury news will make the headlines. Advertisement But can we trust a word managers say? Stretching the truth on player availability has become par for the course. Be it ruling players out who are in line to start or suggesting someone could be fully fit when they’re as likely to feature as your humble newsletter writer, managerial bluffing is often wrapped up in mind games with the opposition. Arsene Wenger and Steve Cooper have admitted lying about injuries in the past and, in some respects, it is understandable: an attempt to gain a competitive advantage by throwing opponents off the scent on team selection. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, who says he “doesn’t want to make it easy for anyone”, has become notorious for his vague answers. Bukayo Saka started and scored in their draw with league-leaders Liverpool last month — he’d been described as “very uncertain” to feature by Arteta. Martin Odegaard’s availability against Tottenham Hotspur in September? “Let’s see.” He had an ankle ligament injury and wouldn’t play again until November. Some managers take the opposite approach. Marcelo Bielsa was so transparent during his time at Leeds United that he’d announce his starting line-up ahead of the game. One day, he told reporters he could no longer do this after being reprimanded in the street by a supporter for giving opponents the upper hand — but then added: “Between you and me, it’s going to be the same team.” The Premier League’s approach to injury news is in stark contrast to the NFL. The league requires teams to list players’ levels of participation in training and there are injury reports ahead of matches where players are described as either questionable, doubtful or out. There is in-game injury reporting and teams can face disciplinary action if they are not compliant. In 2019, the Pittsburgh Steelers were hit with a $75,000 (£59,000) fine for falling foul of the rules. While there are reasons for and against this approach, it is unlikely to be adopted by the Premier League any time soon. One thing we do know, though: Bielsa is NFL ready. One group who would benefit from greater transparency in injury reporting is Fantasy Premier League players. Ahead of Gameweek 12, Abdul Rehman has assessed which Premier League managers’ fitness updates you can rely on — Tottenham’s Ange Postecoglou and Brighton’s Fabian Hurzeler are clearly allies of the FPL community. Arteta, Eddie Howe and Pep Guardiola? Not so much. Tim Spiers has been assessing the state of football punditry. From Europe to South America, it’s quite the varied field. Key takeaways included a grim incident in which former Fenerbahce player Serhat Akin was shot in the foot when leaving a TV studio in Turkey, while we also learnt that Brazilian fans cannot fathom why commentators from other countries do not scream “GOOOOOAAAAAAL!!” — and coverage in the United States via CBS Sports was hailed as the best around.  Fans love local academy graduates, proudly serenading their team’s youth products with chants of “he’s one of our own”. The definition of a “homegrown player”, however, is anyone who has spent three years at the club between their 15th and 21st birthdays and can encompass players signed from across the globe. Advertisement Manchester United led the way in game time for such talents last season, accounting for 28.2 per cent of their Premier League minutes, and continue to do so this term (above). United are followed by Liverpool, with both clubs benefitting not only from their academies — Kobbie Mainoo, Trent Alexander-Arnold et al — but from their ability to attract the brightest youth talent from elsewhere. Liverpool signed a 16-year-old Harvey Elliott from Fulham in 2019, while Alejandro Garnacho joined United from Atletico Madrid’s academy the following year, with both falling into the homegrown bracket. Having signed promising 16-year-old Chido Obi-Martin from Arsenal this summer, United’s pulling power endures, and likely so will their ability to field homegrown players. Something for new head coach Ruben Amorim to build on.  UEFA Women’s Champions League — Group D: Hammarby vs Manchester City, 12.45pm/5.45pm; Group C: Arsenal vs Juventus, 3pm/8pm; St Polten vs Barcelona, 3pm/8pm — all DAZN. How badly can a first day at work go? Spare a thought for Simone Bentivoglio, who was hired by Italian fourth-tier side Piacenza, took one training session and was then relieved of his duties. He became Piacenza’s second managerial sacking of the day. (Top photo: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images) Ali Rampling  is a News Editor at The Athletic.

Plus, more NBA Cup action on tap",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5928995/2024/11/21/nba-lookahead-sixers-nba-cup-preview/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:48:43 GMT","Philadelphia somehow has the worst record in the league. And, hey, let's remember Jason Kapono and Antoine Walker.","NBA Every Thursday, I’ll be taking you through the big story heading into the weekend. Or maybe the weirdest story? Or maybe just something that makes me laugh and I think will make you laugh too. Essentially, if you’re subscribed to The Bounce and reading every day, we’re going to have the same fun here as we do in that space. Advertisement On top of that, I’ve culled the weekend schedule for you to know what to pay attention to. Weird bad streaks against teams? Beefs you need to track? Just fun games with matchups you may not have known were happening? We’ve got that for you. On top of that, we’ll have a good old-fashioned Throwback Thursday to hit you with that feel-good nostalgia. Let’s have fun by starting with trying to decipher just how bad this season is for the Philadelphia 76ers. The 76ers are 2-12. There’s no cute intro. There’s no storyline to weave in and out of and bring back in a full-circle kind of way. There is simply the stark reality that, after 14 games in the 2024-25 season, the 76ers possess the worst record in the league. The New Orleans Pelicans have been better despite missing at least five of their top eight guys almost every night. The Utah Jazz have been better despite being fully inclined to be a train wreck for some Cooper Flagg lottery luck in May. The Detroit Pistons show life. The Atlanta Hawks haven’t been abysmal. Heck, even the Washington Wizards woke up this morning a half-game ahead of the Sixers. Wednesday night, the Sixers finally got to debut their star trio of Joel Embiid, Paul George and Tyrese Maxey. It’s what Daryl Morey built this team around. It’s what Nick Nurse game-planned for all summer. Even though they started the season 2-11, that was all chalked up to injuries to all three of their stars. They were going to get to show off what this is supposed to look like against a Memphis Grizzlies team without Ja Morant and Zach Edey. The star trio? It played six minutes together, and there was nothing to write home about in those six minutes. Instead, everything fell apart on a night Embiid finally had a big game after three mediocre ones, as he gets his legs under him and his body back in game shape. Advertisement Maybe Sixers fans would’ve found solace in the 35 points, 11 rebounds and plus-seven stat line from Embiid. Instead, they have to key in on yet another injury. George left the game and did not return after hyperextending his left knee. If that sounds like deja vu all over again, that’s because he hyperextended that same knee roughly a month ago. It cost George the first five games of the season, and we have to hope doing it again won’t lead to a longer absence. The Sixers just got Maxey back from a hamstring injury, and they’ll be playing musical chairs with Embiid’s availability all season long. They don’t have a ton of time on the court together to build chemistry. There are plenty of caveats to throw at the Sixers in favor of patience and taking a breath. This has been a disaster so far, but we still have five more months of regular season. And they have their three stars under contract for years. Unless they have some worry that Embiid might want out at some point (he doesn’t), then there’s no real reason to panic … yet. They also own their 2025 first-round pick, as long as it falls in the top six. They sent it to the Oklahoma City Thunder (it’s always OKC) when they traded for Al Horford in 2020, but this continuing to be a disaster would only put Morey and company in position to add a top-flight prospect to the mix for the future. The bad news is nothing looks good so far. Embiid will get better. Maxey will get better. George will hopefully get healthier. Jared McCain will get even more comfortable, which is great considering his good start to the season. I think …? However, it’s the Sixers, and recent history dictates they will always disappoint. At least it can’t possibly get worse for the 76ers … because they’re officially the worst right now, and awaiting another piece of injury news. Do you plan out your weekend around your sports-viewing schedule? You’re not alone. Are you the type to want to look like a sports savant by going to your local sports bar, suggesting a game to put on and then reveling in the praise from fellow patrons you’ll get for knowing what to watch? You’re home. Are you the type to just fly by the seat of your pants and wing it last minute when you remember games are on? Bookmark this post and refer to it later! These are the best games to pay attention to this weekend. (All times Eastern) Advertisement Orlando Magic at Los Angeles Lakers, 10:30 p.m. on League Pass: The Magic just lost their league-best six-game win streak. That was tied with the Lakers, who now own the longest win streak at six. The Magic struggle to score but are elite defensively. The Lakers are elite offensively but struggle to defend. This is a perfect matchup. Indiana Pacers (0-1, minus-13) at Milwaukee Bucks (1-0, plus-14), 8 p.m. on League Pass: These were two of the best In-Season Tournament teams last year. Now, they’re both trying to get some good positioning in their group. Both teams are shockingly chasing Detroit in their group, but a big win by either would still likely put them in the driver’s seat for getting to the next round. Atlanta Hawks (2-0, plus-13) at Chicago Bulls (0-1, minus-18), 8 p.m. on League Pass: The Hawks are 2-0 in group play, and going 3-0 might just about punch their ticket into either winning the group or the wild-card spot for the single-elimination portion. Chicago has to win here to stay alive. Dallas Mavericks (1-1, plus-38) at Denver Nuggets (1-1, plus-five), 10 p.m. on ESPN: Let’s hope we get Luka Dončić and Nikola Jokić in this one. Dallas has the point differential needed to control its destiny in getting out of group play. But Denver winning would likely end that for Dallas and boost the Nuggets toward advancing. Sacramento Kings (0-1, minus-4) at LA Clippers (0-1, minus-21), 10:30 p.m. on League Pass: This should be a really fun game, and both teams have their NBA Cup lives on the line. That’s especially so for the Clippers, who got blown out in their first group play game. Golden State Warriors at San Antonio Spurs, 8:30 p.m. on League Pass: We need Victor Wembanyama in this one. If we get it, the matchup of him doing what he does and Steph Curry doing what he does will melt all conventional basketball understanding. This will be like watching basketball in a funhouse mirror. Denver Nuggets at Los Angeles Lakers, 10:30 p.m. on NBA TV: The Nuggets have been pretty vulnerable at times this season. They’re not as complete of a team as the one that dominated the Lakers the last two years. It’s time for the Lakers to see if they’ve made progress against their nemesis. Advertisement Minnesota Timberwolves at Boston Celtics, 3:30 p.m. on League Pass: The Wolves aren’t quite the same team we saw last season, but they had a couple of really fun games against the Celtics last year. Let’s see if Anthony Edwards can challenge these guys again. Dallas Mavericks at Miami Heat, 6 p.m. on League Pass: The Heat got the Mavs in 2006. The Mavs got the Heat in 2011. This one will officially be the rubber match 18 years in the making. Let’s hope everybody plays in this one. LA Clippers at Philadelphia 76ers, 6 p.m. on League Pass: James Harden revenge game! Maybe Paul George will be able to play and have his own revenge game! Honestly, let’s just hope Philadelphia makes it competitive because this is getting rough. After Dalton Knecht dropped 37 points on the lowly Utah Jazz on Tuesday night, there was a bit of a debate in one of my group chats about the Los Angeles Lakers rookie. We were debating if he’s already really good. Low first-round pick. Dropped 27 and 37 in consecutive nights on the two worst defenses in the league. Also had 20 total points over a five-game stretch and really hasn’t done much against good teams so far. We’re also super early into the season. He might be another Duncan Robinson. He might even be more than that. At one point, it led to me making the joke, “Knecht is what Jason Kapono is supposed to be.” That led to a friend calling Kapono “a 6-foot-8 5-11 guy,” which made me laugh. That’s when we all ventured down the rabbit hole that is a late-night basketball discussion about a random player. It’s the stuff group chats were created to do. I started trying to figure out if my memory about Kapono was accurate. It was and wasn’t. I correctly remembered that Kapono was once on an episode of “Sports Science” to see if you could get a shot off in a quicker amount of time than the NBA rulebook says. Do you know about the “Trent Tucker Rule?” Back in 1990, Tucker hit a 3-point shot to give the New York Knicks the win over the Chicago Bulls. He caught the ball with 0.1 seconds on the clock, fired, and it went in. This led to the NBA implementing the rule that you legally can’t get a jump shot off in less than 0.3 seconds. Only tip-ins are legal when there’s less than 0.3 seconds on the clock. It was put into the NBA rulebook by the very next season. On that episode of “Sports Science,” Kapono was tasked with trying to get a shot off with less than 0.3 seconds on the clock. He had a glove with sensors to help them truly measure when the ball left his fingertips. They also brought in Jordan Farmar to do the inbound pass to Jason, and generously called Farmer “one of the game’s rising young stars.” No offense to Farmar, who did play in 504 NBA games over 10 seasons. But that’s a ridiculous way to frame his presence. Although he did finish 11th in Sixth Man voting the year this episode came out. They let us know it takes 0.3 seconds to blink an eye. That’s how quick this shot has to be. Kapono’s first attempt was 0.38 seconds, and he made the shot. On the next attempt they showed, he actually broke the rule. He took and made a 3-point shot in 0.22 seconds, which doesn’t even sound real.  Where my memory failed me is how many NBA games Kapono played in. I would have guessed about 200, give or take a few. I couldn’t have been more wrong. He played in 509 career games. Tack on another 10 for playoff games, including getting a ring in 2006 with the Miami Heat. While Kapono did win back-to-back 3-point contests in 2007 and 2008, I fully blocked out his career with the Heat. He played there for two seasons after his rookie year in Cleveland (same rookie year as LeBron James) and his second season with the Charlotte Bobcats. In Year 2 with Miami, Kapono led the league in 3-point percentage with 51.4 percent on 3.1 attempts per game. Advertisement That led to a discussion in the group chat about whether or not Pat Riley used him correctly in the 2006-07 season. I couldn’t believe the Heat won 44 games with Kapono playing 26 minutes per game. The other side of the Kapono discussion was how Riley had him fourth in 3-point attempts behind James Posey (37.5 percent), Jason Williams (33.9 percent) and Antoine Walker (27.5 percent). This delighted me because Walker was always one of my favorite good-bad players. He was a star on the Boston Celtics for years, before moving on to the Heat after brief stops in Dallas and Atlanta. Walker was such a star in Boston that NBA Live 99 made a commercial with the video game version of Walker, “Cyber ‘Toine,” spliced into real highlights.  It’s how my friends and I referred to Walker for years. Cyber ‘Toine. He spent two years with the Heat. He was productive and helpful as a sixth man in the title run in 2006. Then, in 2007 — the same year Kapono hit 51.4 percent of his 3-pointers on fewer attempts (3.1) per game than ‘Toine (3.9) — Walker had what I described as “a perfect ‘Toine season.” He averaged 8.5 points in 23.3 minutes for Miami. He took more shot attempts (668) than he scored points (660). He also had more turnovers (141) than assists (130). I mentioned he shot 27.5 percent from deep, and I’ll remind you he once said he takes so many 3-pointers because there are no 4-pointers. He shot 32.5 percent from deep for his career. It may sound like I’m just making fun of Walker, but I promise I mean this all as a celebration. I love gunners who live by one unwavering principle, which is to get shots up and score points. I truly appreciate that concept on so many levels. Walker was so much more than that for a good portion of his career, but ultimately he was always a gunner at heart — apparently one Riley trusted more than Kapono.

The league’s only international destination for the 2025 regular season will be Tokyo, for the opening series between the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers, March 18-19. “We’re not going to San Juan,” commissioner Rob Manfred said. “We did not have, despite a lot of efforts, an arrangement that made economic sense for us. We’d still like to do San Juan, and what’s available kind of changes year to year, and I’m hopeful it works out in the future.” Advertisement A return to Mexico City is likely in 2026, Manfred said. “We had a really, really aggressive international play undertaking last season. … But we’ve been to Mexico the last few years in a row, and we’re taking one year off. We’ll be back, though.” The current collective bargaining agreement, which covers the 2022 to 2026 seasons, includes a tentative schedule for international play. MLB listed four destinations for 2025: Tokyo for Opening Day, Mexico City in June, Paris in June and San Juan in September.  The Paris plan went by the wayside last year because the league couldn’t find a promoter.  “Tokyo is really our focus right now for very, very good business reasons,” Manfred said. The original schedule has the league going to Mexico City in May 2026, London in June and San Juan in September.

They’re all on the 2025 Baseball Hall of Fame ballot that was unveiled this week. I don’t know if Ichiro is about to get 100 percent of the vote. But I was 100 percent certain you’d have lots of fun, thoughtful questions about that — and a bunch of other storylines swirling over this year’s Hall election. Advertisement Of course, you didn’t let me down. The questions were great. I apologize that I couldn’t get to them all. So now let’s dive into another edition of our ever-popular Hall of Fame subscriber mailbag. Note: Submitted questions have been edited for clarity and length. If the Hall of Fame had a special “best of the best” wing (for people like Ruth, Gibson, Mays, etc.), and you had a vote, would you put Ichiro in it? Why or why not? Psst. I would. 🙂 — Mathew P. Hey Mathew! You’re really trying to get me into trouble here. No matter how I answer, why do I think there might be a few billion people who disagree? Aw, whatever. Here’s my big question: How large would this wing be, anyway? Ten players? How about 25? More? Less? I need help with that, because it would determine how I would answer your question. You did cause me to hand out a homework assignment — to myself — to try to list who else would be in that wing. I got to 20 position players pretty easily. I haven’t done that list with pitchers yet, but I’m guessing I wouldn’t have any trouble finding 20 of them, either. So as long as your wing had 50 plaques, here’s my verdict: Ichiro belongs! And yes, I’m aware that he has fewer wins above replacement than Sal Bando and the same career OPS+ as Rance Mulliniks. To me, that’s a lesson in why we need to look at more than just WAR and OPS+ when we go through the voting process. Everything else about Ichiro screams all-time Hall of Famer, as you obviously know. We would probably have to acknowledge the Japan years to get him there, but I’m cool with that if you are. Once we include his Japan statistics, we’re talking about a player who got more hits than anyone who ever lived! And if that doesn’t get a guy into the Best of the Best wing, it’s time to find a new name for that wing. Fun question! Advertisement How much do voters take international achievements and stats into account? Of course, Ichiro would have been a Hall of Famer just based on his MLB numbers alone, but I think it’s because of his 1,278 hits in Japan that we have elevated him to potentially unanimous territory. If Yoshinobu Yamamoto has Mark Buehrle’s exact career, would his time in NPB be enough to put him in? Is it fair to only account for NPB stats but not other leagues like KBO? — David P. David, I know I just wrote two paragraphs ago that I’d take Ichiro’s Japanese feats into account if I were deciding who gets into the “Best of the Best” wing. But ignore that! That’s just the tiebreaker in deciding admission to a wing that doesn’t even exist in real life. You know what does exist in real life? The actual Hall of Fame plaque gallery. And we are definitively not supposed to use international stats in that voting. We’re instructed to vote on a player’s career in the “major leagues” — which does not include the NPB, KBO or any other international leagues. So Yamamoto’s Hall of Fame meter started ticking in 2024, not on the other side of the Pacific. Thanks for the excellent question.

How anyone could leave Ichiro off their ballot is beyond me, but I do admit that I appreciate a voter throwing their hat into the ring for, say, Billy Wagner in the hopes of keeping him on the ballot. — Carl M. All right, let’s do one more quick Ichiro question because it’s not just Hall of Fame season. It’s Ichiro season! Your question is right on point because ballot management is a thing these days for a lot of voters. A few years ago, the Baseball Writers’ Association of America asked the Hall of Fame to let us vote for more than 10 players on the ballot. The Hall said: Sorry! So here we are. Advertisement That means that in a year like this one, with such a deep ballot, it’s going to be tempting for some voters to say: I know Ichiro is getting in, so I’d better vote for Félix Hernández to make sure he isn’t one and done. It stinks that we have to think that way and vote that way. But I’m convinced that’s why Derek Jeter and Ken Griffey Jr. weren’t unanimous. So would it shock me if it happens again to Ichiro? Ha. How could it? How can you justify voting for Billy Wagner with dozens (if not hundreds) of pitchers left out of Cooperstown who inarguably contributed more to their teams than Wagner? Personally, I think it’s a joke that Wagner is considered a viable candidate when someone like Bret Saberhagen is thought of as a non-candidate — and for that matter, that Jack Morris was regarded as borderline before he was inducted. Note: I wouldn’t vote for Andy Pettitte either, but you could fit four of Wagner’s careers into one of Pettitte’s. — James S. James, my friend, I hate to break this to you, but “relief pitcher” is a real position. In fact, you might have noticed that relief pitchers are beginning to take over the Baseball Earth, while starting pitchers try to avoid extinction. I’m not trying to go all Jurassic Park on you. I’m just making a point. I’m not a fan of the decline of starting pitching. If I were the king of baseball, I’d do everything I could to fight that. But here in the real world, our mission is to look at the world that exists — not the world we wish would exist. And since “closer” was a real job for all 16 seasons that Wagner pitched in the big leagues, I think my assignment as a voter is to assess where he ranked among the closers of his time — and of all time. As I’ve written for a decade, he was such a dominator within the definition of that job, he owns the best ERA, WHIP and strikeout rate of any left-handed reliever ever. So why do I vote for him? That’s why. As my friend Brian Kenny from MLB Network always says, we’re not talking about a guy who was the eighth-best or 12th-best. He was THE best. So to dismiss Wagner because he pitched fewer innings than Pettitte isn’t fair, just as it wouldn’t be fair to Pettitte to say: I’m not voting for that guy because he didn’t have rate stats as good as Billy Wagner’s. I hope that makes sense. That’s how I look at it anyway. I know not everyone does — and that’s why we vote on this stuff! Advertisement Wagner’s postseason numbers have been used against him for Hall consideration. Please restate your position on how misleading these numbers are for your fellow voters. — Richard T. Thanks, Richard. Look, it’s hard to argue that any voter should just ignore Wagner’s 10.03 postseason ERA. All I’ve tried to do is go game by game and see what that tells us. What it told me is that his teams had a shockingly hard time getting him the ball with the lead at the end of these games. This guy only had four postseason save opportunities in 16 seasons. Four. And he blew only one of them — the first one. So as much as we want to compare him to Mariano Rivera, Mariano got 47 of those postseason save opportunities. Here’s the other stunning thing I found: In a decade and a half in the big leagues, Wagner faced only 30 hitters with a lead in the postseason. Again, is it fair to compare him to Mariano — who faced over 400? When I vote, I prefer large samples over small samples. So if you believe the postseason is the reason not to vote for this man — as opposed to 900 innings of regular-season domination — that’s too small a sample to disqualify him, at least for me. I understand that for closers, October is never irrelevant. But where does that fit in the big balancing act we do with almost every candidate? All I can do is explain where it fits for me. GO DEEPER How a broken arm — and an unbroken spirit — took Billy Wagner to the doorstep of the Hall CC (Sabathia) was a good pitcher but is a compiler at best. He has 62 WAR, which averages to 3.3 WAR (per season). — Pep V. Pep, I appreciate your perspective. I just could not disagree with it more. CC pitched for a long time (19 seasons). That’s not the same thing as being “a compiler.” I think a “compiler” is a guy who strings together a bunch of league-average seasons, one after another, but never rises above that level. Someone like Edwin Jackson (with all due respect to his long career) — he’s a compiler. Sabathia is almost the opposite of that. Advertisement A guy who owns a Cy Young Award and five top-five finishes is not a compiler. … A guy who led his league in shutouts four times is not a compiler. … A guy who got traded in midseason, as Sabathia did in 2008 to Milwaukee, and said, “Jump on my back. I’ll make five straight starts on short rest to save our season” — that’s not a compiler. … A guy who got signed to a huge contract with New York in 2009, then had a sub-2.00 postseason ERA (over five starts) as his team went on to win the World Series — that’s not a compiler. Obviously, in the last five years of his career, he wasn’t That Guy anymore. But don’t let those back-end years obscure the great years. And don’t just look at the WAR column when you’re evaluating him — or anyone on this ballot. Look at literally everything. When you do that with CC, you see so much more than “compiling.” It’s obviously not going to happen this year, but will (Dustin) Pedroia ever make it into the Hall? It’s such a shame his career ended the way it did right in the middle of his peak years. Is he a Koufax candidate? Short but massively impactful career. — Andrew W. Andrew, I was hoping someone would ask me about Pedroia — one of the most fun, most watchable and most charismatic players of the 21st century. He’s a tricky Hall case. So I think we’ll be talking a lot about him over these next couple of months. We’ll never know how his career would have unfolded if that Manny Machado slide hadn’t happened in 2017. But we do know Pedroia was on a Hall of Fame track when it did. It’s never easy to decide what we should do, as voters, with players like him. I thought David Wright was a very similar player when he arrived on last year’s ballot, so I made sure to vote for him just to help him make it to Year 2. I could see myself doing the same with Pedroia, because he’s comparable not only to Wright but also to Chase Utley, another force of nature at second base whose career totals were stifled by injuries. Utley got 28 percent of the vote last year, so I think that offers hope for the Pedroia fans. And as I wrote in my Five Things to Watch on the Hall of Fame ballot column, I have a feeling Utley will get elected someday. That’s because I see our philosophy as voters evolving over the next few years — away from the counting numbers of yesteryear and toward players with dominant peaks, whose impact on winning was undeniable. And doesn’t that describe Dustin Pedroia? Advertisement During the 10 seasons from 2007-16, he ranked fifth in the entire sport in WAR — behind only Robinson Canó, Adrian Beltré, Albert Pujols and Miguel Cabrera — and won an MVP, Rookie of the Year and two World Series along the way. I’m really curious to see what his vote total looks like as he goes through the next decade. But first, we have to make sure he gets enough votes to stay on the ballot this year! Please explain the differentiation between Andruw Jones and Jim Edmonds. (And for that matter Dale Murphy, Kenny Lofton, etc.) Jones and Edmunds had nearly identical WAR, home runs, All-Star (appearances), etc. Both were elite Gold Glove center fielders. Jones had slightly more RBIs and Gold Gloves; Edmonds had more hits and a better batting average, slugging percentage, OPS and OPS+ plus a World Series title. Jones keeps getting votes/consideration, but Edmonds was one-and-done. In my opinion, they’re either both HOFers or neither. — Jordan H. Jordan, you’re firing that question at a guy who didn’t vote for Andruw Jones for six elections in a row — for that very reason. I’ve brought up the Jones versus Edmonds comps so many times, but this is the perfect occasion to do it again. I’ve been open about what always stopped me from voting for Jones — that he drove his career over a cliff at age 30 and was such a non-presence, he was worth a total of 1.7 WAR from ages 31-35. So how could people justify comparing him to Willie Mays, which still happens all the time? The player we should be comparing him with is Edmonds, who played in the same era, but was still collecting Gold Gloves at 35. Edmonds won eight Gold Gloves, had a career 132 OPS+ and didn’t even make it to a second year on the ballot. Jones won 10 Gold Gloves, but also had a 111 OPS+ and wasn’t even a league-average defender in his 30s. There is also this: Seasons with a Gold Glove and 120 OPS+ or higher Jim Edmonds — 8
Andruw Jones — 4 Advertisement I’m still embarrassed that Edmonds (and Lofton) fell off the ballot so fast. In Edmonds’ case, he got crushed by an overloaded 2016 ballot that included 11 future Hall of Famers, plus Billy Wagner — not to mention Curt Schilling, Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Gary Sheffield, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Jeff Kent. But whatever the reason, it took me all the way until the 2024 election to finally vote for Andruw Jones. In large part, that was because Edmonds’ shadow hung over my evaluation. And you know what? It still does. If Jones makes the Hall, I’m good with it. But if he does, let’s just say I sure hope the Contemporary Baseball Era Committee is paying attention. And speaking of those Era committees … Dick Allen has another chance on (the Classic Baseball Era ballot). Is the third time the charm? — Kevin M. Believe it or not, Kevin, this is actually Allen’s seventh time on one of these Era Committee/Veterans Committee ballots. The first was over two decades ago. But I know you’re referring to the last two, when he missed by only one vote — 10 years ago and three years ago. I’ve served on these committees, and I appreciate their value. But I also know how they work. So I highly recommend not trying to predict how they’ll vote. That’s especially true with this committee, which will meet in a couple of weeks — since right now, we still don’t even know the 16 members who will be voting. OK, now that I have that preamble out of the way, if I were on this committee, I’d vote for Dick Allen. And his combination of credentials and narrative seems as if it would make him the kind of candidate most likely to show up on 12 of the 16 ballots. For one thing, he’s already gotten 11 votes twice. And everyone who got more votes in those two elections now has a plaque in the gallery. That seems helpful. Advertisement But you know what’s even more helpful? Allen has a Hall of Fame case that feels more aligned with these times than those times. Over his 11-year peak, from 1964-74, he led the entire sport in OPS+ (165), with a parade of legends and Hall of Famers behind him. He was second in slugging (.554) in that glorious era, behind only Henry Aaron (.561). And Allen and Aaron were the only two players in baseball with at least 300 homers and 100 stolen bases over those years. Add in an MVP, a Rookie of the Year award and two home run titles — and it gives the committee a reason to downplay Allen’s lack of counting numbers (1,848 hits, 351 career homers) and the controversies that hung over him during the turbulent times in which he played. It was those counting numbers and controversies that kept him from gaining any real traction on the writers’ ballot. But that was then. This is the 2000s. This committee also will be well aware of how close he came in the previous two elections — and that, sadly, he didn’t live to see the Induction Day that now feels inevitable. So it feels as if his stars are finally aligned. But have I mentioned that predicting these committees is a really bad idea? That was true two decades ago — and it’s one thing about modern Hall of Fame voting that hasn’t changed.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Sara Errani serves up another tennis trophy for Italy at the Billie Jean King Cup,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936031/2024/11/21/sara-errani-tennis-player-italy-serve/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:01:10 GMT","The 37-year-old completed a career Golden Slam in 2024, and has built a remarkable career behind one major weakness.","Tennis MALAGA, Spain — Sara Errani stands at the baseline and exhales deeply. She is about to hit a second serve, with Italy up match point against Poland. A place in the Billie Jean King Cup final is at stake. So Errani does what she has done many, many times before: she hits an underarm serve. The ball floats into the service box and onto the racket of Iga Swiatek, one of two women’s players who can claim to be the best in the world. Swiatek is on to it in a flash and hits her return deep to Errani’s forehand. Errani again does what she has done many, many times before: she gets the ball back. Advertisement She does the same on her opponent’s next shot, hoisting a backhand lob into the air. Swiatek loops a forehand volley long and Italy is through to the final for the second year in a row. Errani collapses to the ground in relief, celebrating with her partner Jasmine Paolini and shaking hands with the defeated opponents a few seconds later, before allowing herself a what-have-I-just-done smile.  For Errani, 37, it was another successful heist in a career full of them. On Wednesday, she added a fourth Billie Jean King Cup title (three of which came when it was the Federation Cup) to the career Golden Grand Slam in doubles she completed this year by winning gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics alongside Paolini. It has been a stunning year for Errani, who also won the mixed doubles title at the U.S. Open with another Italian, Andrea Vavassori. She thought 2024 would be her last on tour, having won her last major 10 years ago. “My thought last year was to play in the Olympics and then stop playing tennis, but we’re playing great in doubles and I’m having so much fun,” she said in an interview in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, at the WTA Tour Finals earlier this month. Completing the doubles Golden Slam in Paris put Errani in an elite group of just seven women. When looking back on her career, the underarm serve to Swiatek on Monday will feel like a defining moment for a player who uses the contentious tactic more consistently and more particularly than anybody else. Her story with the underarm serve goes to the heart of her tennis life. The underarm serve is one of tennis’s most curious shots, caught between the poles of disrespectful trick shot and tactical masterstroke. Big servers like Nick Kyrgios can use it to take advantage of opponents who are standing back anticipating a 140mph rocket. There is an element of showmanship too; this is very much the case with Alexander Bublik. He might be blessed with a big serve, but he is also the current player probably most synonymous with the cheeky alternative. Advertisement Other players use it against specific opponents. World No. 68 Alexandre Muller told The Athletic at Wimbledon that he had specifically practised the shot to use it against Daniil Medvedev, who has one of the deepest return positions in the sport. Corentin Moutet, a master of the shot, started practising underarm serves after a shoulder injury. He has since incorporated them into his game, doing so to great acclaim at this year’s French Open. He used the underarm serve 12 times in his third-round win against Sebastian Ofner, winning nine of those points. He is the opposite of a player like Kyrgios, using the underarm serve because he doesn’t expect to win free points behind his first serve; there is no drop-off in expected value. GO DEEPER How Corentin Moutet's 12 underarm serves shook Roland Garros Errani’s reason for using the shot will be familiar to many amateur players: she just doesn’t trust her serve. Errani stands at 5ft 5in (164cm) which is diminutive by modern tennis standards — just like her partner Paolini, whose serve has some heat despite her height of 5ft 4in. Errani does not have this pace, and her height has contributed to a shot often derided as the worst serve in the sport. Smiling, she says it would be amazing to be a bit taller. “Many times, I think about that.” Instead of letting her serve become a complete albatross, Errani has used her ground skills, tactical nous and the shock factor of a serve that regularly registers around 60mph (96.5kph) on the speed gun to reach the very top of tennis in singles and doubles. She reached the 2012 French Open final in singles and cracked the world’s top five a year later, despite her opponents feeling that they ought to break her every single game. Instead, they are bamboozled by her incredible dexterity at the net or from the back of the court, as well as struggling to read and return her serve. “It comes so slow and it kind of floats in the air,” Mirjana Lucic-Baroni said in a news conference after losing to Errani in the 2014 U.S. Open fourth round, a match in which Errani’s average serve speed was 76mph. “It was really difficult to time the balls.” Errani’s serve became something of a meme in 2024 after Daniil Medvedev completely failed to return it at all during a mixed doubles match at the Paris Olympics. Advertisement Errani herself said in a news conference after that match that she has a different approach to serving from most players: “I don’t try to make winners,” she said. “I just try to make kick, make slice, try to change my game. I need to start the point where I want. So sometimes is better for me to serve not that fast, because if you serve fast the ball is coming (back) faster.” That conviction hasn’t always been there. Her serve reached a nadir in April 2019 when she was only recently back from a 10-month doping suspension for ingesting letrozole, which was increased from an original two months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Errani said she was “really disgusted” by the length of the ban, saying that her case was because of contamination after her mother, who was taking letrozole for breast cancer, dropped pills on their kitchen counter where they prepared meals. At the Copa Colsanitas in Bogota, Colombia, Errani served 18 double faults per match in three consecutive matches (all of which she won) before hitting around half her serves underarm in a quarter-final defeat to Astra Sharma. Later that year at a low-level event in Asuncion, Paraguay, Errani took the nuclear option by serving underarm for the entire tournament. She reached the final, copping a huge amount of social media abuse in the process. In response, she wrote on Instagram: “In Italy, I keep being insulted by a lot of people, regarding mainly my serve. “If it is not ok for you, send a letter to WTA asking to change rules about serve or ask them to disqualify me for awful serve. If instead you just have other problems with me, send a letter to Santa.” Five years on, she says her serve had completely overtaken everything else. “I couldn’t compete. I was thinking all the time about my serve,” she says. Advertisement “My coach said: ‘Do one tournament all underarm and just compete.’ It was to try to make my head free from, not panic, but the tough moments.” Despite recovering from those yips, Errani then endured an anxiety dream of a service game at the 2020 French Open during a second-round defeat to Kiki Bertens. Errani was given two time violations after five aborted ball tosses and landed only one overarm serve, with one attempt missing the baseline. Serving for the set, she was broken to love.  “Sometimes it’s there and it can come out, but I try to manage it,” she says of the nerves that can grip her when serving. “When I was practising, my serve was good. But then in matches, I was feeling the block, the panic. I know it’s still there. It’s not like it’s in the past.” Errani, an unwitting trailblazer, can laugh at the fact that the underarm serve has come back into fashion, certainly on the men’s side, over the past few years. “If it can be a good tactic, why not?” she laughs. Against Swiatek, the decision was more of a vibe. “I just advised Jasmine after the first serve, so it’s just I feel it and I did it, just like that, not thinking too much,” she said in a news conference after the match. At 37, Errani is the Italian team’s most experienced player, and as her team-mates chorused in Wednesday’s celebratory news conference she is “the brain of the team”. Errani resembles her compatriot Jorginho, the Brazilian-born Italy and Arsenal midfielder who is so intelligent that he is a reference point for everybody else despite not being the most physically gifted. GO DEEPER Jorginho exclusive: Arsenal 'energy', no-hop penalties, love for Havertz, knowing strengths Paolini, who is the world No. 4 in singles and a two-time Grand Slam finalist this year, constantly looks to Errani for guidance on the doubles court. “She wants me to tell her what to do every point – even when she serves, she likes me to tell her where to put it and I’m trying to push her to tell me what she’s feeling more,” Errani said. Whatever the tactics, the Errani-Paolini partnership is contributing to a golden period for tennis in Italy. On the men’s side, Jannik Sinner is the world No. 1 and has won two Grand Slams this year. He is part of an Italy team that is hoping to defend the Davis Cup this week and make it a double with the victorious BJK Cup group. Errani, who lived through a period when she was one of the ‘Fab Four’ Italian women who all reached a Grand Slam final and the world’s top 10 between 2010 and 2014 (Francesca Schiavone, Roberta Vinci and Flavia Pennetta were the others), believes that all the current top players from her country are pushing each other to greater heights. Advertisement And Errani has no desire to leave the golden age behind just yet.  “I said to Jasmine: ‘I’ll continue next year for sure and then we’ll see,’” she says. After the genre-defining underarm serve against Swiatek, this wily veteran still has at least one last heist in her.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Raiders' Brock Bowers having a historic rookie season despite team's struggles,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936372/2024/11/21/brock-bowers-raiders-rookie-tight-end-oroy/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:00:55 GMT","The Raiders have lost six straight games amid major turmoil on offense, but their first-year tight end is putting up incredible numbers.","NFL HENDERSON. Nev. — Brock Bowers is a man of few words. Davante Adams dubbed the rookie “Business Man” because of his stoic demeanor. As of late, though, the Las Vegas Raiders tight end is starting to loosen up. After scoring a touchdown against the Miami Dolphins last week, he hit a viral dance to celebrate. When passing quarterback Gardner Minshew II at team headquarters Wednesday, Bowers blew him a kiss. He’s getting more comfortable and confident, and it’s translating to his play on the field. 🕺 #LVvsMIA pic.twitter.com/VYJFcO8DAj — Las Vegas Raiders (@Raiders) November 17, 2024  “At the beginning of the year, stuff was flying everywhere,” Bowers said Wednesday. “With each game, the game’s slowed down.” Bowers has been historically good this season. He has 70 catches (second in the NFL) for 706 yards (10th) and three touchdowns (tied for fifth among tight ends). He’s on pace to break the single-season rookie record for catches regardless of position and could set the rookie mark for receiving yards by a tight end. Advertisement Only one tight end has won the Offensive Rookie of the Year award — Mike Ditka in 1961 — but Bowers is building a strong case to become the second. Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels, Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix and New York Giants receiver Malik Nabers also have strong OROY cases, but none have been as productive relative to his peers as Bowers. Bowers leads all tight ends in catches and receiving yards. Travis Kelce, Trey McBride and George Kittle are all putting up excellent numbers at the position, but Bowers’ receiving production leads the pack. “It’s unbelievable,” Minshew said Sunday. “We’re putting so much emphasis on him. … In every situation, we’re calling on him and he’s delivering, man.” Bowers is coming off the best game of his career. Against the Dolphins, he had 13 catches (the most ever in a game by a rookie tight end) for 126 yards (career high) and a touchdown. The 21-year-old sensation is only getting better. Brockin' and Rollin!#LVvsMIA | 📺 @paramountplus pic.twitter.com/tUq5NzKADV — Las Vegas Raiders (@Raiders) November 17, 2024  “At the end of the season, you get to relax and reflect a little bit,” Bowers said of appreciating his accomplishments, “but we’re not there yet.” The area where Kittle maintains a decisive edge over Bowers is as a blocker. While Bowers has been better than expected in that realm, Kittle still has a leg up when it comes to being the best all-around tight end in the league. And while Kelce is so-so as a blocker and has slowed as a receiver, his longevity and lengthy playoff resume can’t be dismissed. Regardless, a rookie simply being in the conversation with the likes of Kittle and Kelce is wildly impressive. That success hasn’t gone to his head. “There’s always another week coming,” Bowers said. “I’ve always got something to prove.” Advertisement Raiders tight ends coach Luke Steckel knew Bowers was capable of making this type of impact the first time he watched his college film. He saw a naturally gifted player who jumped off the screen. His physical traits (speed, size, play strength and athleticism) were alluring, but he also displayed a nuanced skill set that featured crisp route running, an ability to find favorable angles to come back to the quarterback and exceptional ball skills. “He’s probably the best tight end I’ve ever evaluated coming out of college,” Steckel said Tuesday. “We’ve had really high expectations for him, and he’s certainly lived up to those.” It’s tough to find a recent comparison for Bowers’ college career. In three years at Georgia, he amassed accolades that included three All-America selections, three All-SEC selections, two John Mackey Awards and two national championships. But while there was little doubt Bowers was one of the best players in the 2024 draft, the Raiders didn’t feel like a fit. Las Vegas had bigger needs at quarterback, offensive line and cornerback, and it had just taken tight end Michael Mayer in the second round the year before. That led to a lukewarm external reaction to the pick despite Bowers’ talent. But general manager Tom Telesco viewed him as the best player available, and the coaching staff concurred. “The day he walked in the door, we knew we were getting a blue-chipper,” coach Antonio Pierce said in September. And just 10 games into Bowers’ career, it’s looking like the right move for the Raiders. “It means we picked the right guy in the draft,” Pierce said Monday. “(He’s a) tremendous talent.” GO DEEPER Raiders' baby steps with new offensive staff aren't enough in sixth straight loss Perhaps the best part of Bowers’ game has been his ability to create yards after the catch. He has 378 yards after the catch this season (seventh in the NFL). “His ability to run after the catch is obviously pretty big,” Mayer said Sunday. “It’s huge — being that size and being able to wiggle around and find the space and find open spots.” Advertisement Bowers said, “I just catch the ball and run with it,” earlier this season when asked what makes him so good after the catch. That’s a bit of an oversimplification. “He’s so strong with the ball in his hands,” Steckel said. “He’s got a natural forward lean when he runs. So when he’s tackled, he’s always going to be falling forward for an extra 3 or 4 yards. … You see him catch the ball, run with good ball security, have that forward lean and really have the strength in his lower body to run through defenders. And then when they fall asleep on him, I think he’s got a little twitch in his system to make guys miss, as well. … His natural ability just takes over.” Bowers has a knack for getting open, but that’s partially a result of his cerebral approach to the game. He’s had growing pains like any other rookie, but he’s learned from his mistakes. “He’s a really smart player,” Steckel said. “He sees the game clearly. He’s able to process information quickly. … The learning curve certainly wasn’t as steep for him as it is for other rookies coming in, in my experience. … And then the results just speak for themselves.” GO DEEPER How did the Raiders roster get so bad? A series of unfortunate events The knock on Bowers coming out of college was his blocking ability. He spent most of his time at Georgia lined up as a slot receiver and is a lighter tight end at 230 pounds. He certainly has room to grow in the blocking department, but he’s been able to hold his own. “As a tight end, you’ve got to have the mentality that you’re a blocker first,” Steckel said. “That physical element of the game and that toughness that’s required to go do your job on the line of scrimmage, he’s done that every time he’s called upon. Obviously, he does so much for us in the pass game that we try to utilize as much as possible, but we’re not afraid to put him in a 3-point stance and have him block a defensive end. … That’s something that separates him from a lot of other tight ends in this league who have a lot of success in the passing game is he excels as a blocker, as well. There’s really no limitations to his game.” Bowers’ performance this season has come despite poor quarterback play, unreliable pass protection, a non-existent run game, a mediocre receiving corps and a change in offensive coordinator and play caller. That paints an exciting picture of what he could do in a more functional offense. Advertisement Since Adams requested a trade in Week 5, Bowers has been the Raiders’ No. 1 receiving option. The coaches have moved him around often to find favorable matchups — he lines up as an in-line tight end, slot receiver, outside receiver and in the backfield — but opposing defenses have still found ways to send extra help his way. Yet that hasn’t stopped the rookie from being productive every week. The Raiders’ collective struggles could ultimately be what prevent Bowers from winning OROY. Nix has kept the Broncos (6-5) in the playoff picture, and the same goes for Daniels with the Commanders (7-4). Meanwhile, Bowers and the Raiders sit at just 2-8. That may not seem fair to Bowers, but team success has historically factored into voting for awards. Regardless of the postseason plaudits, what’s clear is that the Raiders have landed a star. Moving forward, the hope is he’ll be a cornerstone for the offense that helps change the franchise’s fortunes. “We’re trying everything we can to feature our best player (on offense),” Pierce said. “We just need more and more guys to keep making more plays like him.” Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Anthony Richardson shined in his Colts return, but one great game isn't enough",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935963/2024/11/21/colts-anthony-richardson-consistent-lions/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:00:21 GMT",Richardson has shown flashes of brilliance before. What he needs to show now is that he can become a consistent force leading the Colts.,"NFL Mo Alie-Cox could feel it. As one of the last players in the Indianapolis Colts locker room who played alongside Andrew Luck, the veteran tight end remembers what it’s like to witness a great quarterback take over. The word he used to describe Richardson’s fourth-quarter performance against the Jets? “Cooking,” Alie-Cox said, laughing, as he reflected on New York’s helplessness. GO DEEPER Anthony Richardson's revival, Brock Bowers' brilliance, more Week 11 thoughts: Quick Outs Richardson didn’t look like the erratic second-year pro who had many people questioning whether he could ever become a franchise QB. He looked like a player accessing the peak of his powers, with his body and mind operating so harmoniously that it didn’t matter what Jets defenders did — even if they were in a position to stop him. Advertisement Richardson still had a counter. “The coaches can always go draw it up, but then you can step on the field, and something might not be the look you were expecting,” Alie-Cox said. “That’s when the players come to play, and then with him, you see what he’s capable of.” After Richardson’s clutch, three-touchdown performance, the question now becomes: Can he do it again against the Detroit Lions, arguably the best team in the NFL? “I wouldn’t say there’s any desire to prove anything, honestly,” Richardson said of his motivation to play well against the Lions. “It’s just really a desire to just keep stacking up my process and … putting in the work, so I can get better each and every week.”  Despite Richardson’s attempt to downplay what another strong game against Detroit could do for his confidence — and his teammates’ confidence in him — he will likely need to be at his best to help the Colts pull off an upset. The Lions are the NFL’s No. 1 scoring offense with 33.6 points per game. They’ve scored more than 40 points four times and more than 50 points twice, including last week’s 52-6 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. Detroit also boasts the No. 5-ranked scoring defense, limiting opponents to 17.7 points per game. Safety Kerby Joseph, who has a league-high seven interceptions, is someone Colts offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter says his team must locate “at all times” because of his elite ball-tracking skills. However, when Richardson was asked about his level of “concern” in the matchup, he quickly dismissed using that word to frame his team’s upcoming game. “Definitely no concerns, honestly,” Richardson said. “Every week, you’re playing a great team, but we all know this is a pretty good team that we’re getting ready to go up against. But I feel like we’re a great team, as well, so I feel like we just gotta prepare like that and just get ready to go out there and compete.” Advertisement The Colts haven’t won back-to-back games in more than a month, while the Lions haven’t lost a game in more than two months. Richardson’s teammates are confident he’ll be up for the challenge, mainly because they believe the young QB has already moved beyond his performance against New York. On Wednesday, just four days removed from the best game of his budding NFL career, Richardson appeared to be completely over it as he fielded questions at his locker. His approach wasn’t unusual for a QB, as many of them subscribe to the nonchalance method of answering questions to help mitigate the spotlight they’re constantly under. But for Richardson, it was an obvious change in demeanor. I asked #Colts HC Shane Steichen how much he thinks QB Anthony Richardson can *really* change in 2-3 weeks: “He’s definitely still growing. But we’ve seen great strides like I said last week. And it showed. … I think it’s gonna pay huge dividends in the long run.” pic.twitter.com/PwJIqA3HuC — James Boyd (@RomeovilleKid) November 20, 2024  The happy-go-lucky young man he used to be is likely still inside him, though that version of him seems to be buried deep down following his two-week benching. What’s emerged to replace it is a 22-year-old who is now trying to carry himself like a 10-year veteran. “In the meeting room (Wednesday), we were going over stuff, and he was a little bit more vocal,” Alie-Cox said. “Coach (Shane Steichen) was asking like, ‘What do you have (on this play)?’ and he was answering it immediately like, ‘You check to this,’ and things like that. You can see he’s been locked in even more than he already was. “He just wants to keep proving to everybody that they made the right decision in going back to him.” GO DEEPER Colts' Anthony Richardson played with renewed confidence; Shane Steichen deserves credit But on the other side of Richardson’s hunger to deliver for those who never lost faith in him, there also must be a part of him that wants to silence his doubters — even if he’ll never explicitly say so himself. Richardson’s teammates can still sense the edge beneath his now stoic exterior. The young signal-caller was scrutinized on national TV for weeks, some of it fair and some of it foul. The external criticism will never dwarf his own, as Richardson has routinely said he doesn’t seek validation from people outside of the Colts franchise. Advertisement But fuel can come in many forms. “He’s out there to prove everybody wrong,” wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. said. “Everything that everybody’s been saying about him, he is just out there to show them that he’s here and he’s here to stay. And he’s gonna do it his way.” Richardson’s way worked well last week, with the Colts building their offensive game plan around his legs. The 2023 No. 4 pick scored two rushing touchdowns against the Jets and has seven rushing scores through his first 11 NFL games, which is the fourth-most in league history and one more than Bills superstar Josh Allen, whom Richardson is often compared to. Alie-Cox said he can see Richardson’s tantalizing ceiling even more clearly after he torched New York, and he’s excited to see his QB tap deeper into his “MVP-caliber” potential. The veteran tight end is also fully aware Richardson still has a long way to go, but Alie-Cox firmly believes Richardson can one day elevate a franchise. Steichen said Richardson is “still growing,” and the coach has continued to remind his quarterback that he must key in on the details behind the scenes so that he can shine bright on game days. Sunday’s game against the Lions isn’t the biggest stage Richardson hopes to play on in his career, but it can serve as a barometer for where he’s at currently and where he intends to go. “They’re gonna bring it to us. We gotta bring it to them,” Richardson said of his mindset. “Just trusting my guys each and every play, like I did in that fourth quarter (against the Jets), and just trusting my ability. I feel like I’m a decent football player, and I like to make plays.” Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Watch F1 while clubbing? Las Vegas GP general admission gets an upgrade in Year 2,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936657/2024/11/21/f1-vegas-tickets-cheap-general-admission/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:00:06 GMT",Getting the Las Vegas GP experience may not cost fans an arm and a leg in 2024.,"Formula 1 LAS VEGAS — The Formula One Las Vegas Grand Prix has been criticized for pricing out the average race fan, drawing headlines for exorbitant hospitality experiences like the $12,500 Bellagio Fountain Club. However, those with a case of sticker shock may have overlooked the LVGP’s influx of 10,000 additional general admission tickets available for 2024, bringing the total GA capacity to nearly 13,000. That includes the new “GA+” experience in an area called the South Koval Zone, which was previewed Wednesday by The Athletic and appears to offer quite a good value by both F1 and Vegas standards. Advertisement Though originally listed at $1,350 for a three-day pass, an all-access ticket to the South Koval Zone was running at $749 for the weekend on StubHub.com as of this writing; a single-day ticket to Thursday’s practice sessions was listed as low as $72. Race organizers added the “plus” option this year to appeal to those who wanted an upgrade over the other GA areas without spending $1,500 on the cheapest available reserved grandstand seat. But upon entering the Heineken-branded South Koval Zone, it doesn’t exactly scream “lower-tier.” The highlight is an area between the two grandstands of unreserved bleacher seating called the “Turn 3 Club.” And when we say “club,” we mean club — as in a trackside, open-air dance club just feet from one of the circuit’s high-speed DRS zones. Adjacent to a shimmering, checkered flag dance floor, DJs will spin tunes from a booth with cars ripping down the straightaway behind them. Despite the name, the “club” is hardly exclusive. Anyone with access to the South Koval Zone can grab the first-come, first-serve seating at group-friendly high-top tables or oversized white chairs made to resemble couches (they’re not plush). Another feature of the GA+ zone is the Heineken trophy tower, which will feature the race trophy displayed atop an 80-step climb. The tower’s platform has a partial glass floor and glass walls offering a unique view: From the platform, spectators can watch the cars twist into view through Turn 4 before rocketing down the Koval Straightaway toward the Sphere. Groups of 20 people at a time will be permitted atop the tower, with each group allowed three-to-five-minute chunks before yielding to the next. (The exact length will depend on the line of people below.) Emily Prazer, Chief Commercial Officer of Formula 1 and the Las Vegas GP, told reporters this summer that much of the feedback from Year 1 focused on providing a variety of additional price points for fans. “Initially, we were like, ‘Right, it’s a big, sexy new event, we’re going to have a ton of hospitality,'” Prazer said. “We learned that lesson. We now have much more accessible tickets, GA zones and something for everybody versus something for just the high end.” To that point, the look of the South Koval Zone has changed considerably. Heineken had a presence in the South Koval Zone in 2023, but it was part of a swanky hospitality area called the “Heineken House.” Musician Anderson .Paak performed an energetic DJ set (as his alter ego, DJ Pee .Wee) and guests were served food identical to what was available in the luxurious Paddock Club overlooking the paddock area. This year, the GA+ experience in the South Koval Zone also includes food in the ticket price — but it’s of the pub fare variety, not a Michelin-star chef. (Non-alcoholic beverages are also included, but attendees have to pay if they want to drink the night away.) There are less expensive GA options as well. T-Mobile Zone at Sphere, for example, has live entertainment from the likes of Ludacris, OneRepublic and Alesso ($1,050 three-day pass); another, the Flamingo Zone ($600), has standing-room-only viewing platforms but no free food. Advertisement All of the GA sold out quickly for Saturday, though some tickets are still available for Thursday’s practices and Friday’s practice/qualifying sessions. Of course, F1 didn’t come to Vegas to market itself to Joe Race Fan. Tickets for wealthier clientele are still available for those who want to spend $5,000 apiece (and higher) on hospitality options that would make some high rollers jealous.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Cardinals' division to lose? Projection model ranks contenders in wild NFC West,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5933021/2024/11/21/nfl-playoffs-projection-cardinals-rams-49ers-seahawks/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:00:04 GMT","The odds are good only one team from the NFC West will make the playoffs. Can the Rams, 49ers or Seahawks chase down the Cardinals?","NFL It’s wild times in the NFC West. We’re 11 weeks into the NFL regular season, and every division contains at least one team with at least seven wins or seven losses — except the NFC West. The Arizona Cardinals pace the division at 6-4, while the San Francisco 49ers sit in last place (due to tiebreakers) at 5-5. The Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks are squeezed in between them at … 5-5.  As you can imagine, with all four teams so tightly packed together and plenty of division games left to be played between them, the chaotic fight to the finish will be fascinating. GO DEEPER NFL playoff projections 2024: Bills beat Chiefs; can they take AFC No. 1 seed, too? It will be especially intriguing because the rest of the NFC has been so good that, at this point, it’s highly likely only one team, the division winner, will make the playoffs. So, which team is most likely to win the division title? Will it be the team with the best roster or the one with the easiest schedule? That’s what we’re here to find out. Let’s use my NFL Projection Model to take a deeper dive into why I think each team is still alive to win the NFC West. Advertisement The Cardinals don’t project as the best team in the NFC West, according to my model, but they are the most likely to win the division. The primary reasons are pretty simple. First, they have a one-game advantage over every other team in the division. Second, they have the easiest remaining schedule of these four teams, and it’s not particularly close. The Cardinals are currently slated to face the 12th-easiest schedule remaining in the NFL. Meanwhile, the Seahawks face the ninth-hardest remaining schedule, the Rams the fifth-hardest and the 49ers the second-hardest. GO DEEPER James Conner and the punishing style and leadership that fuel the Cardinals The Cardinals still have matchups with the lowly New England Patriots (3-8) and Carolina Panthers (3-7). If they take care of business against those teams, that brings them to eight wins, and it might take only 10 to win the division. That means they’d have to win just two more games in a slate that features two matchups against the Seahawks, one at the Vikings, one at the Rams and the season finale at home against the 49ers. That seems pretty doable. However, if there is one area I’m worried about with the Cardinals, it’s the defense. They rank 23rd in EPA/play and 31st in success rate, according to TruMedia. They may luck out with the schedule, but the defense will need to improve and supplement Kyler Murray and a Cardinals offense that has played at a top-10 level this season. The story of the Rams’ season has been injuries, and they’ve endured quite a few. The offensive line was gutted early in the season, and that’s on top of star wide receivers Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua missing time. This led to a 1-4 start and sunk their playoff hopes — my projection model had their playoff odds at a season-low 6% on Sept. 22. GO DEEPER NFL Power Rankings Week 12: A new pair at the top, plus coaching hot seat check-in But with the return of Kupp and Nacua, coupled with the offensive line getting healthier over the last few weeks, the Rams have reversed course and have gone 4-1 since their Week 6 bye. It’s apparent that when you’re able to give quarterback Matthew Stafford time to throw to stars like Kupp and Nacua, this offense is lethal. And that’s without even acknowledging Kyren Williams and a healthy rushing attack. Pair that offense with a defense that is third in the league in pressure percentage while blitzing at only a league-average rate, and you have a legitimate contender. Advertisement Los Angeles Rams to win the NFC West +550: I think the Rams have the most value, as they win the division nearly a quarter of the time in my model’s simulations. The defense has some holes — especially in the secondary — but when Stafford, Kupp and Nacua are healthy, they have a shot to win every game. For the record, my model has them as the favorite in four of their final seven games, with the weekend’s home matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles a pick’em.  The 49ers still have the best roster in the division, and if they can just stay healthy (a big ask) in the second half of the season, they’ll likely find themselves in contention to win the West. Their biggest problem has been the inability to close out games. They’re 2-4 in one-score games, and in three of those losses, they blew either a double-digit lead or a fourth-quarter lead. I thought the return of star running back Christian McCaffrey might be the answer to closing out those games, but in two weeks since his return, he hasn’t looked nearly as explosive. GO DEEPER 49ers mailbag: Is Kyle Shanahan losing the locker room? Is the window closing? There’s no denying it: Things are bleak in San Francisco right now. Their playoff odds have fallen below 25% in my projections. And if they lose the next two weeks, which is very possible at Green Bay and at Buffalo, it would likely spell the end of their postseason dreams.  The Seahawks kept their division hopes alive by beating the 49ers on Sunday. Give them credit: Their front seven on defense was decimated by injury earlier this season, so to still be in the hunt is a testament to coach Mike Macdonald and the rest of this team. While their odds of winning the West are the lowest among the four teams, their schedule does provide some opportunities. They have two games against sub-.500 teams (the Jets and Bears) that are essentially must-win. They also have two games against the division-leading Cardinals, which means they can control their own destiny to a degree. Getting two wins against the Cardinals would obviously pay huge dividends. But even going 1-1 against Arizona and 2-0 against the Jets and Bears would put them right in the thick of things come Week 18. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Broncos' biggest turnaround this side of Bo Nix: A run defense with real bite,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935854/2024/11/21/broncos-run-defense-malcolm-roach/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:00:02 GMT",The Broncos have jumped from last in yards per carry allowed in 2023 to fourth this season.,"NFL ENGLEWOOD, Colo. — Bo Nix has surged into the national spotlight after his rousing performance in Sunday’s game against the Atlanta Falcons. He was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week on Wednesday — the first rookie quarterback in team history to win the award — after completing 28 of 33 passes for 307 yards and four touchdowns. It was his seventh game this season with no turnovers. The fervor around Nix’s massive game was such that head coach Sean Payton on a Monday morning conference call said, “Let’s not send this kid to Canton quite yet, please.” GO DEEPER Bo Nix’s latest career day illustrates Broncos' ceiling: ‘You’re trying to win MVP' As significant as Nix’s growth has been since the first month of the season, it’s not the only turnaround that has helped push the Broncos into the thick of the playoff race as the season reaches its homestretch. The about-face Denver has made as a run defense has had a transformative impact on how the team can win games. Advertisement It’s why Payton signed off Monday after taking bushels of questions about Nix’s performance by asking one of his own. “Nothing on the defense and holding the Falcons’ rushing (attack) down?” Payton asked. “It was a Bo Nix day, huh?” Wednesday's #DENvsLV injury report: 📰 » https://t.co/NHkoVQSfnV pic.twitter.com/CIjTXBuhO8 — Denver Broncos (@Broncos) November 20, 2024  It was a fair critique. The Broncos enter Sunday’s road game against the reeling Las Vegas Raiders ranked fourth in opponent yards per carry (3.8), tied for third in rushing touchdowns allowed (six) and third in TruMedia’s defensive rush EPA (expected points added). Denver last season ranked 32nd in yards per carry allowed (5) and 28th in rush EPA. The latest installment of the Broncos’ dominating performance as a rush defense came Sunday, when they limited Falcons running back Bijan Robinson to only 35 yards on 12 carries. It was the second-lowest output for Robinson since a 16-carry, 31-yard performance in a Week 3 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. In the six games prior to Sunday’s game in Denver, Robinson had averaged 87.3 yards per contest and 5.24 yards per carry while scoring five touchdowns. If solving the quarterback conundrum after releasing Russell Wilson this offseason was the top priority, rebuilding a struggling run defense was a close second. The Broncos had handed out big free-agent contracts the prior two offseasons to nose tackle D.J. Jones (2022) and defensive end Zach Allen (2023), but there wasn’t enough depth around them. It made it too easy for opponents to exploit weaknesses in Denver’s defensive front. It became a fatal flaw as the Broncos lost three of their final four games. Limited in free agency by the $53 million in dead money the Broncos were eating on Wilson’s contract — with $32 million more to come in 2025 — any path to success for them would require making the most of economic signings. It starts with a quarterback playing at a high level in the first year of a rookie contract, but that was only part of the puzzle. The Broncos identified former Saints defensive tackle Malcolm Roach as an impact addition at an economical price (two years, $7 million). The signing has been a hit by every measure. Roach notched his first full sack Sunday when he dragged down Kirk Cousins, but his most significant impact has been in the run game. He ranks second among all defensive tackles with a run-stop rate (percentage of tackles made for zero or negative yards) of 15.6 percent, according to Next Gen Stats. Advertisement The Broncos then added a big name at a relatively small price when they traded a sixth-round pick to the New York Jets before the draft for defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers, then reworked his deal to lower his cap hit this season to a palatable $5 million. Franklin-Myers has five sacks, just one off the career high he set with the Jets in 2021. Allen also has five sacks and will set a new career-best mark with his next takedown. The same tough decisions they create for offenses — Who do we use extra resources to block? Who do we leave one-on-one? — extend to the run game, and the Broncos have frequently left opponents with few good options. D.J. Jones fights through a double and John Franklin-Myers wins instantly to blow up the run pic.twitter.com/gMBU88Dd00 — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 19, 2024  “It starts with our D-line and them creating pressure in the backfield,” said cornerback Pat Surtain II, who is having his best season in run support on top of limiting opponents to a 44.3 passer rating when targeted, according to Pro Football Reference, by far the best mark of his career. “When runners get a ball, all they see is a wall. It’s hard for running backs and their rushing game to get going when our D-line is striking and putting the O-line in the backfield.” The Broncos have a league-high 39 sacks entering Week 12. That leaves them on pace to challenge the franchise record of 57 sacks, set in 1984. There are numerous factors for Denver’s success in harassing opposing quarterbacks. Defensive coordinator Vance Joseph’s play calling, Nik Bonitto’s breakout (already a career-high nine sacks, tied for second most in the league), the hard-to-defend interior pairing of Allen and Franklin-Myers are among them. But the rushing success defensively, particularly on early downs, has set the table for everything else. “If an offense has got a run rhythm, you’re defending a lot of different elements,” Payton said. “If an offense, at some point, becomes one-dimensional, you’re only defending one element. So I do think there’s a correlation there.” GO DEEPER Marvin Mims Jr.'s new role highlights Sean Payton's creativity with Broncos offense The Raiders, who have lost six straight games, don’t profile as a team that will pose a major threat on the ground. They are averaging a league-worst 75.2 yards per game. The biggest challenge for Denver’s defense will come from rookie tight end Brock Bowers, who had 13 catches for 126 yards and a touchdown in last week’s loss to the Miami Dolphins. He had eight catches for 97 yards in the Raiders’ Week 5 loss to the Broncos in Denver, including a 57-yard touchdown reception on the opening drive. Bowers ranks sixth among all NFL players in targets this season with 89, four more than Broncos wide receiver Courtland Sutton. Advertisement “He can move, he can be outside, he can run a route tree different than most tight ends,” Payton said. “He goes up to make the first touchdown catch against us. When it’s happening week in and week out, you see that with the player in Detroit (Sam LaPorta). Obviously, you see it with (Travis) Kelce and (George) Kittle. That’s a weapon and it becomes a little more challenging (to defend) when they’re at that position.” One question for the Broncos is whether they’ll have starting safety Brandon Jones back Sunday. He missed the game against the Falcons with an abdomen injury and was limited in practice Wednesday. Left guard Ben Powers, meanwhile, missed practice with a shoulder injury. In other injury news, the Broncos decided to let safety Delarrin Turner-Yell’s 21-day activation window expire without activating him Wednesday, meaning he’ll remain on the physically unable to perform list for the rest of the season. Payton said it was a difficult decision and Turner-Yell, who suffered an ACL tear late last season, has a “bright future,” but the Broncos, by virtue of a largely healthy roster, didn’t have the space to bring Turner-Yell back.

In the modern era of women’s basketball, there is UConn — and by extension, Geno Auriemma — and there is everyone else.  At one point it was Tennessee and everyone else. Now it might be South Carolina and everyone else. But for over two decades, Auriemma and the Huskies have been the standard. Last night, we saw the coronation: Auriemma is now the winningest coach in college basketball history.  Two important points of that story you may not know:  Here we are, 1,217 wins later. Auriemma has won 88 percent of his games, better than previous record holders Tara VanDerveer (82 percent) and Mike Krzyzewski (77 percent). Just look at the pace, too: Auriemma, at 70, is arguably the greatest basketball coach to ever live. He is the best program builder, at least. He won his first national championship in 1995 and his most recent in 2016, with nine others in between. In there was a 111-game winning streak. He is not slowing, either. The presumed No. 1 WNBA Draft pick — Paige Bueckers — plays for him, and the team is ranked No. 2 in the country, behind only South Carolina. UConn (4-0) also has the second-best title odds behind the Gamecocks, according to BetMGM.

Pep Guardiola has agreed to a new contract at Manchester City, quashing fears (for now) that the legendary manager, 53, would leave after creating a modern soccer dynasty. The new contract is just for one year, and City — winners of four straight Premier League titles — have struggled of late, but still sit second in the EPL table.

NFL legend Ray Lewis has shown significant interest in the vacant FAU head-coaching job, a source told The Athletic’s Bruce Feldman, just two days after former coach Tom Herman was fired. The 49-year-old Hall of Famer is inspired by Deion Sanders’ route to Colorado, though Lewis has no coaching experience at this point.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Willie Green's job security, the tanking question and more: Pelicans mailbag",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936507/2024/11/21/pelicans-mailbag-willie-green/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 11:30:48 GMT",What should the Pelicans make of under-the-radar success stories like Yves Missi and Brandon Boston Jr.?,"NBA It’s been a long time coming, but the first New Orleans Pelicans mailbag of the season is finally here. It might be a struggle for the Pels to keep their players on the floor these days, but that won’t stop us from answering some of the questions you have about this team’s present and future. Let’s jump right into it. (Some questions have been edited for clarity and length.) Advertisement Do you get any sense that Willie Green’s job is in jeopardy? Beyond the injuries, this team often doesn’t play hard. And why can they never run a play on offense? — Bill C. Outside of the injuries, this seems to be the main topic of discussion for many Pelicans fans in recent weeks. It’s not surprising, considering how the season has started for a team that came into the year with legitimate hopes of winning 50-plus games. As frustrating as it may sound, it’s hard to feel like Green’s job is in danger when he’s being asked to win games with Brandon Boston Jr., Jeremiah Robinson-Earl and Javonte Green in the starting lineup. Have there been a few games that slipped away this season that Green could’ve done more to salvage? Perhaps. I wrote on Wednesday about his reluctance to take timeouts at the end of the losses to the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets that might come back to bite this team. Considering how tough the schedule has been lately, anyone expecting this group to be playing .500 ball with Brandon Ingram and a bunch of two-way guys has to be more realistic. Are there areas where Green needs to improve as an in-game coach? Absolutely. What matters more is that CJ McCollum, Jordan Hawkins and Herb Jones all have a pretty good chance of being back on the floor before the end of the month. Dejounte Murray will also be back in the mix within the next couple weeks. Once the Pelicans start looking like a real NBA team again, the spotlight on Green will be extremely bright. If he can’t get things turned around, then he’ll deserve the harsh criticism. Some of the Pelicans’ struggles in close games must be a thing of the past. Every win will make a huge difference the rest of the way. But until some of the regular rotation guys are back on the floor, it’s hard to put much blame at Green’s feet. Advertisement Shouldn’t the Pels be tanking given the injuries? — Phil T. With every loss the Pels suffer, the calls to “Sag for Flagg” or “Brace for Ace” will get louder. The appeal of having a high pick in this year’s draft is extremely high considering the talent at the top of the board, led by Duke’s Cooper Flagg and Rutgers’ Ace Bailey. The easiest path to adding a superstar will always be selecting one at the top of the draft. But as bad as their record is now, it’s hard for me to see the Pelicans remaining bad enough to have one of the three or four worst records in the league by the end of the season. Like I said above, McCollum, Hawkins, Jones and Murray are all expected to be back in the lineup relatively soon. With that much talent on the perimeter, along with Ingram and Trey Murphy III, the Pelicans will have enough to compete every night. Not to mention, there won’t be much of an appetite for taking a step back when the head coach and the lead executive, David Griffin, are already getting some heat from the fan base. Plus, Murray, Murphy, Jones and Zion Williamson are locked in with long-term contracts. Even if they finally pull the plug and ship Ingram to another team, the Pels would still have enough to win. The most important thing for this team the rest of the way will be getting Murray, Murphy, Jones and Williamson on the court together as much as possible and seeing what that core looks like on both ends of the floor. How do you find the other pieces to bring the best out of those four guys? That’s where the future of the team lies. Besides, ask the Detroit Pistons how fun it is to watch a team tank all season and not end up with a top-3 pick. Are all of the soft-tissue injuries, e.g., hamstring strains, just bad luck or are they a symptom of poor conditioning or poor performance by the training staff? — Anonymous First off, I’m not a doctor, so I’m a terrible person to ask these kinds of questions. Advertisement However, there are different kinds of soft-tissue injuries, and just because one team has two or three guys dealing with hamstring injuries at the same time doesn’t mean all of them are out of shape or that the medical staff is terrible. It’s easy to point at Williamson and say his hamstring injury is because he’s out of shape, but Murphy suffered a pretty severe hamstring strain on the second day of training camp. Is anyone saying his injury was a result of being out of shape? Sometimes, injuries do tell a bigger story about how a medical staff is working or how much a player is taking care of their body. And there are also times when injuries are just bad luck. The one area of concern that I find hard to overlook is when a player starts suffering repeated soft-tissue injuries to the same part of the body. Murphy hasn’t dealt with hamstring injuries much during his time in the league. But Williamson had issues with both of his hamstrings this season, and he was forced to miss the playoffs last season after suffering a hamstring injury in the Play-In Tournament against the Lakers. He also missed four months of the 2022-23 season because of hamstring issues. This is where it’s fair to start asking some serious questions: What’s been done to address these hamstring problems? How much added treatment is being put in place to make sure these problems won’t continue? Is there a common issue that’s been the cause behind these injuries? I don’t have a problem chalking up Murray’s broken thumb or Jones’ shoulder injury to bad luck. But Williamson’s hamstrings and the work being done to make sure they won’t become an issue again is something that both he and the team have to address. Will, where do you think Brandon Boston Jr. will be slotted once the regulars come back? He’s done a fabulous job during this time. — Jim C. There’s no doubt Boston has earned a spot in the regular rotation once everyone is back. He’s proven he can knock down 3s as a catch-and-shoot guy or off the dribble. He can make plays with the ball in the open court. And he moves with confidence. Advertisement If we’re looking at what the rotation will be once most of the guys are back, but Williamson and Alvarado are still out, I’d say the starters will be Murray, McCollum, Jones, Ingram and Yves Missi. That leaves Murphy, Hawk, Javonte Green, Robinson-Earl and Boston as the top reserves. If we had to chop the rotation down to eight guys, I’d still keep Boston in over Green. This team’s need for outside shooters is too important. I think it’ll get very interesting if Boston keeps playing well up until it’s time for Alvarado to come back. As much as I like the idea of having a backup point guard with Boston’s size and shooting, the energy Alvarado brings on defense is a crucial part of this team’s identity. His feel for playing in the passing lanes and creating turnovers is such a rare asset. I’d probably play Alvarado over Boston if push came to shove, but Boston will have some time over the next few weeks to shift my opinion — and the coaching staff’s. Does the front office want to stick with Missi all year, or trade for a starting center until Missi’s ready? — Autumn C. Missi’s play has been one of the few reasons to be excited about what’s going on with the Pelicans lately. I think he’s done enough to earn a chance to hold down the starting center spot the rest of the season. Once most of the team is healthy again, I wouldn’t be surprised if Green finishes a few games with Robinson-Earl or Jones at center so it’ll be easier for them to space the floor and switch everything on defense. Still, Missi has proven he can bring a ton of value as a lob threat, an offensive rebounder and an energy guy. Life will be a lot easier for him once he gets to play with guards who can create easy looks for him again. If Ingram ends up getting moved before the trade deadline, I wouldn’t be surprised if a veteran center is included in that deal to add some depth in the frontcourt. Regardless, Missi deserves an opportunity to show what he can do as a full-time starter with some of the regulars. The best-case scenario for this team is if they can go into the offseason and feel pretty good about Missi as the starting center going into 2025-26. With the financial crunch the Pels will be working around, having a starting big man on a rookie-scale contract will make building out the rest of the roster a lot easier. Advertisement I’d also add that giving out assets to grab another veteran center doesn’t make sense when this team still has so much work to do to get back in the playoff race. Giving up any real assets with the hopes of saving this season would be extremely short-sighted. Do you think the Pelicans regret not keeping the Lakers pick last year? — Krishazure Although Dalton Knecht would be a fantastic fit in New Orleans, considering how tight the financial crunch was for this team last summer, it would’ve been really difficult for them to add another $3.8 million in guaranteed money to this year’s books. Maybe they could’ve used that first-rounder to make another deal, but we also have to remember that most teams and experts were down on last year’s draft. The more sensible move was to bet on a potential Lakers collapse in 2025 (which looks unlikely now, but was hardly impossible to envision) or to have another pick in a 2025 draft that looks better and deeper. At the very least, Pels fans can be happy that drafting Missi at No. 21 last summer looks like a success. (Top photo: Sean Gardner / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

George’s injury came in the 76ers’ first game with stars George, Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey all healthy at the same time. But the team suffered yet another injury setback when George, the team’s marquee free-agent acquisition, exited with a hyperextended left knee early in the second half of a 117-111 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. Advertisement After the game, the team said George will not undergo an MRI, which could be a positive sign. George’s hyperextended knee is the same knee he injured in the preseason, which caused him to miss the first five games of the season. George appeared to suffer the injury early in the third quarter while jumping for a rebound. He would later be ruled out, ending his night after 17 minutes with just two points on six shots. Maxey, returning from a hamstring injury and on a minutes limit, also struggled, finishing with eight points on 13 shots. Embiid notched a season-high 35 points in his fourth game of the campaign, but it wasn’t enough. “It sucks. I know how it feels, I’ve been there,” Maxey said of George’s injury. “I just lost six or seven games to injury, so it hurts to see a teammate get hurt.” With George’s injury, plus Embiid’s absences due to left knee injury management and a three-game suspension for shoving a local columnist, the Sixers have gotten off to their slowest start in years, falling to 2-12 with Wednesday’s loss. They sit in last place in the Eastern Conference standings. (Photo: Justin Ford / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Why the Chiefs’ Patrick Mahomes-Xavier Worthy deep-ball game isn't clicking,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936235/2024/11/21/chiefs-patrick-mahomes-xavier-worthy/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 11:05:54 GMT","Since Week 4, Mahomes has thrown eight passes with the ball traveling at least 30 yards past the line of scrimmage with no completions.","NFL KANSAS CITY, Mo. — As Buffalo Bills fans roared after a third-down sack by their defense, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes trotted off the field, tossed the ball to an official and took his seat in the middle of the bench. Soon after, Mahomes felt disgusted. He grabbed a tablet and rewatched the All-22 view of the Chiefs’ first-down snap early in the second quarter of their defeat to the Bills. Advertisement “If I throw it in bounds, it’s a walk-in touchdown,” Mahomes said of his longest pass in Sunday’s game. “I just have to be better there.” Technically, Mahomes’ deep pass was in the field of play by about a yard. But rookie receiver Xavier Worthy failed to keep both feet in bounds while catching the ball, leading to perhaps the Chiefs’ most critical incompletion. Part of Worthy’s left foot was out of bounds, which led CBS broadcasters Jim Nantz and Tony Romo to groan when they watched the replay of the rookie’s mistake. Xavier Worthy unable to stay inbounds pic.twitter.com/kweNz7FeWH — NFL on CBS 🏈 (@NFLonCBS) November 17, 2024  Instead of a 40-yard completion — one that would’ve put the ball at the Bills’ 30-yard line — the Chiefs offense never gained a yard on the possession, instead going backward for a 9-yard loss with the sack of Mahomes. “Pat could have seen him earlier,” coach Andy Reid said Monday after he reviewed the play. “That’s part of it, but once you’re there, (Worthy) could have dragged his foot to keep it in. He’ll be able to chalk that one up to (a lack of) experience. That combination, those are the little things, though. “(You’re talking) about 7 points there against a good team. We’ve got to make sure (that) we take care of business on both ends.” GO DEEPER How the Chiefs' little mistakes added up to their first loss of the season However, Mahomes and Worthy’s failure to connect on deep shots is not a new problem. The last time Mahomes completed a pass to Worthy with the ball traveling at least 30 yards past the line of scrimmage was Week 4 against the Los Angeles Chargers, according to TruMedia. Since that game, Mahomes has thrown eight similar deep passes. Seven have fallen incomplete, including five intended for Worthy. The other was intercepted by Bills linebacker Terrel Bernard.  The Chiefs traded up (with the Bills) in the first round of the 2024 draft to pick Worthy believing he could revitalize their deep-passing attack. A three-year starter at Texas, Worthy ran the 40-yard dash in a record-setting 4.21 seconds at the NFL combine. Reid and general manager Brett Veach envisioned Worthy outrunning a one-on-one defender for a deep pass with the defense also having to account for tight end Travis Kelce and receivers Rashee Rice and Marquise Brown. The Chiefs practiced those plays over and over and over during training camp. Advertisement “Right now, I feel like it’s just a little bit of thinking going through my head,” Worthy said a couple of weeks ago. “I’m still trying to figure things out.” Similar to just about every aspect of the Chiefs offense this season, Worthy’s role has been altered because Brown (shoulder surgery) hasn’t played a snap and Rice (knee surgery) has been out since Week 4. In essence, all of the burden for the Chiefs’ deep passing attack has been placed on Worthy. “As a rookie, you don’t really see a lot until you actually play in the games,” Worthy said. “Every game, I feel like I’m seeing more and more (coverages) and I’m getting comfortable with what’s thrown at me.” GO DEEPER NFL QB stock report, Week 12: Patrick Mahomes drops; Caleb Williams deserves your patience The Mahomes-Worthy misconnections began in Week 7 against the San Francisco 49ers. The Chiefs’ opening play after halftime failed: Mahomes missed Worthy, who was wide open on a slick post route, for a potential 71-yard touchdown. Two plays later, Worthy stumbled and fell while running a corner route against man coverage. Mahomes threw the ball as Worthy fell and cornerback Deommodore Lenoir intercepted the pass. “For Xavier being one of the fastest guys in the league, running at that much speed and having to stop on the sideline, not a lot of people can do that,” veteran receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster said. “For him, it’s just working at it every single day. As a young guy, I’ve had those moments, where you can’t really see where the sideline is at when the ball is in the air. “I’m not worried about him at all. He’s a guy that’s going to correct it. He’s a guy that takes accountability, too. He needs to work on that. He’s always looking to get better and move forward. He’s not a guy who knows it all. He’s a sponge.” MAHOMES TO WORTHY FOR A 54-YARD TD. 📺: #KCvsLAC on CBS/Paramount+📱: https://t.co/waVpO909ge pic.twitter.com/ZAYGWXNr1V — NFL (@NFL) September 29, 2024  Earlier this month in a win against Tampa Bay, Worthy noticed the Buccaneers’ Cover 2 early in the game, adjusting his route alongside the sideline, giving Mahomes a bigger throwing window for a potential 33-yard touchdown. The mistake was that Worthy fully turned his body toward the ball and caught the pass while his right foot was out of bounds. The Chiefs failed to score on the drive. Advertisement The next week, in a win over the Denver Broncos, the offensive line gave Mahomes a clean pocket — a rarity that day — while Worthy was wide open against man coverage from cornerback Riley Moss for a potential 51-yard touchdown. Mahomes, though, missed Worthy and the field. His deep pass landed out of bounds. “As the season has gone on, he’s playing faster,” Mahomes said Wednesday of Worthy. “He has more confidence. It’s about me being on the same page as him. We can practice it all we want, but until we start doing it in the game, there’s not much more I can say about it.” Sunday’s game against the Bills was a perfect example for Mahomes. Before the deep incompletion, Worthy sprinted past safety Taylor Rapp. Mahones acknowledged he should’ve thrown his pass more toward the numbers on the field than the sideline. One issue, though, was that Mahomes couldn’t use proper footwork on the pass as he faced pressure from defensive end A.J. Epenesa (57 in the NFL Pro screenshot below).  “There’s little things here and there,” Reid said Wednesday. “It could be (Mahomes), it could be him not being able to see (Worthy from) where he is (in the pocket), or the way the defense is playing or possible pressure. It’s been a variety of things.” “It will happen. It’ll click.” Reid said that because he felt the rest of Worthy’s performance against the Bills was positive, an encouraging sign of his progress. GO DEEPER How the Chiefs felt watching a different superstar QB beat them with a superstar play Reid and Nagy designed the Chiefs’ first offensive snap for Worthy, who gained 7 yards on a nifty end-around. Worthy finished the game with 61 receiving yards on four receptions, including a 10-yard touchdown. But the Chiefs scored just 7 points after halftime as Mahomes didn’t target Worthy. “You can tell he has more confidence in himself and what he can do within the offense,” Mahomes said of Worthy. “Whenever he’s playing confident, and not thinking, he’s playing fast and it’s hard for people to account for how fast he is. I’m excited for him. I thought that was a good jumping-off point. We’ve got to keep him more involved in the offense throughout the second half.” WORTHY SPEEDS IN 🏃‍♂️ @XavierWorthy pic.twitter.com/l2TicCUNkY — Kansas City Chiefs (@Chiefs) November 17, 2024  Mahomes said he also believes his deep passes to Worthy will start to connect. The sooner the better. “Once it starts happening,” Mahomes said, “the offense is really going to take off.” Injury update: Running back Isiah Pacheco (broken fibula) and defensive end Charles Omenihu (torn ACL) were limited participants in Wednesday’s practice.

In a ceremony at the Rose Garden, President Joe Biden congratulated Brad Stevens, Joe Mazzulla and the rest of the Celtics for winning the title last season. Here are notes from the Celtics’ day in Washington, D.C. Advertisement Oshae Brissett, who remains a free agent after declining a player option to stay with the Celtics, joined his former team at the White House. Since he did not attend the banner ceremony on opening night, when the current Celtics received their rings, Tuesday also gave him an opportunity to pick up his ring. Derrick White enjoyed seeing his old teammate. “Obviously, we have pretty much the same team back,” said White. “It’s not like we haven’t seen each other a lot. But it was really cool to see Brissy again and have him be a part of it. Obviously, he was a big member of our team last year and so it was great to have him here and a part of it and just kind of get the whole gang back together.” Assistant general manager Mike Zarren said it was fun to see Brissett. “He hasn’t been around this year obviously but it was cool for him,” Zarren said. “We got him his ring. That was a neat moment.”  According to Zarren, a Celtics group was scheduled for a meeting at the White House about “a bunch of policy issues that our community groups have been working on.” Co-owner Steve Pagliuca, who was part of that meeting, said he and other members of the team sat with the White House’s policy advisors. Zarren said the Celtics were focused on two issues. “One is Raise the Age, where we’re trying to raise the age of which people will be treated as juveniles,” Zarren said. “And the other’s our Curbside Care program, where we’ve got a first-of-its-kind program, an ambulance that’s been altered inside to effectively be a care unit for mothers in underprivileged communities. Often times those people don’t get the care that they need. So this is a first-of-a-kind program in the country and we’ll be bringing that up in meetings today.” GO DEEPER Inside the Celtics' championship march to Banner 18: 'We made all the sacrifices' For the Celtics figures who also experienced the 2008 championship, Thursday provided a chance to reminisce. Zarren said he recreated a photo he took with Danny Ainge in the White House 16 years ago. This time, in the same spot, Zarren took the photo with Brad Stevens instead. “It was neat to see this team in the same places the team was in ‘08,” Zarren said. “It’s kind of cool, it’s a whole different group.” Advertisement Another photo from the day featured even more star power than the Stevens-Zarren combo. Celtics co-owner Wyc Grousbeck said he, his wife Emilia and Mazzulla took a selfie with President Biden. “We have a selfie with Joe Biden that he took,” Grousbeck said. “So just an amazing, warm encounter with really a great man, great person.” “This was a very moving, very exciting and moving day,” added Grousbeck. “We had not been focused on this. We got through the banner and opening night and then it was all business, led by Joe (Mazzulla). Joe really doesn’t want us to dwell too much on the past. He wants us to move forward. Having said that, everybody here including Joe really seemed to have a great time. And we really got some time to personally connect with the President. Emilia and I spoke with him directly. Joe was right there. Steve Pagliuca and others. But we really got to know him and spend time. It was just a meaningful day. We all thought his remarks about the Celtics really were amazing and we took them to heart and appreciated them. The whole thing, it was a very special day.”   (Photo: Adam Glanzman / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Forward Jordan Ayew also withdrew from the Ghana squad after sustaining an injury against Angola, with the Ghana Football Association saying MRI scans showed “significant issues” with his knee, but Cooper has played down the significance of the issue. “Jordan has come back injured as well, but it is not as a serious injury as reported in Ghana and hope is he may be available for the weekend,” said Cooper. Leicester are already without defender Ricardo Pereira, who has been ruled out for four months with a hamstring injury. Jamie Vardy missed November’s defeat to Manchester United with a back problem, while Facundo Buonanotte is suspended for Saturday’s visit of Chelsea after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season against United. GO DEEPER 'His long-term plan was to go to Europe and learn' - Abdul Fatawu's journey to Leicester Fatawu’s injury absence for the rest of the season is devastating for the winger but an even bigger blow for Leicester City. As his performance at Manchester United showed, Fatawu was just starting to show his potential on the Premier League stage before his ACL injury. The injuries are mounting for manager Cooper. Pereira has already been ruled our for four months and young defender Ben Nelson is also set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines, but it is the attacking options that are being depleted. Advertisement Ahead of the return of former manager Enzo Maresca with Chelsea, Cooper also has doubts over Bobby De Cordova-Reid, Ayew and Vardy, although Patson Daka is set to return from his spell on the sidelines. If Leicester are to beat the odds and survive in the Premier League they need a cutting edge in the final third. The transfer window is just around the corner and Leicester will need to be active to give themselves the best chance. (Michael Regan/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Roki Sasaki’s agent calls rumors of Dodgers handshake deal ‘poor sportsmanship’,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936992/2024/11/21/roki-sasaki-dodgers-agent-rumors/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 10:00:42 GMT",Joel Wolfe of Wasserman denied the allegation on Wednesday.,"MLB NEW YORK — In the last year, as anticipation built that highly coveted Japanese pitcher Roki Sasaki could sign with a Major League Baseball team this offseason, front-office executives have continuously speculated behind closed doors that the outcome is predetermined. The officials suspect that Sasaki has some sort of unwritten agreement to join the Los Angeles Dodgers. Advertisement Executives have brought some of those rumors, at least informally, to the commissioner’s office, and Dodgers higher-ups have heard them as well, according to people briefed on the discourse who were not authorized to speak publicly. Sasaki’s agent, Joel Wolfe of Wasserman, denied the allegation on Wednesday, hours after commissioner Rob Manfred also tried to quell the topic. “While a bunch of executives who should know me better and do a lot of business with me insult my integrity by insinuating that I would be a part of some type of nefarious agreement,” Wolfe told The Athletic, “in reality, this is just poor sportsmanship.” Responding to a question about the rumors at MLB headquarters, Manfred said he expects Sasaki will not sign until after the new year. That could in theory diminish the Dodgers’ chances of signing the pitcher. Sasaki, 23, is soon to be an international amateur free agent under baseball’s rules, which means teams must bid on his services using their international bonus pool money. MLB rules forbid teams from reaching unwritten agreements with those players before they are eligible, and Sasaki’s Japanese team has yet to formally post him for bidding. The Dodgers have $2.5 million left in their bonus pool for the 2024 signing period, which ends on Dec. 15. That’s more than any other team, and the fact they saved that much has further prompted finger-pointing that they expect to land Sasaki. But Manfred said Sasaki likely will be signed only once the new international signing period opens on Jan. 15, making him part of the 2025 class. At that point, every team enters the signing period with a fresh allotment of money, making for a theoretically more even playing field. The Dodgers, who declined comment, will be among the teams with the least available money to spend in the new period at $5.1 million. At the high end, some teams will have a little more than $7.5 million. Advertisement “In my media training, they told me never to answer questions that involve suspicions, so I could pass all together,” Manfred said when asked about the money the Dodgers had preserved in their 2024 pool. “Just one clarification. It kind of looks like the way it’s going to shake out, the signing there — just because of the timing — will happen in the new pool period. So that’s kind of a significant fact. “But you know, we’re going to see what happens there. If there’s any reason to believe that there was a violation of one of our rules, you can rest assured that we will thoroughly investigate and try to get to the bottom of it.” The Chiba Lotte Marines of Nippon Professional Baseball announced earlier this month they will post Sasaki for bidding, setting the stage for a fierce competition for his services. The World Series champion Dodgers have been linked to Sasaki in part because they already have two former NPB stars, Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, on their roster. Although unwritten agreements with international amateurs are banned, they happen all the time in Latin America, where most international amateur players hail from. There are no known published reports of the Dodgers violating the sport’s rules in their pursuit of Sasaki. Speculation, however, has persisted. Dallas Keuchel, a former Cy Young Award winner who was Sasaki’s teammate on Chiba Lotte this year, told the New York Post earlier this month, “I heard some rumblings about a done deal with the Dodgers — you know, having a plan for him.” Preventing teams from gaining unfair access to foreign players isn’t a new topic for the commissioner’s office. In March, the league banned “working agreements” between MLB clubs and four formally recognized foreign leagues: the top circuits in China, Korea, Japan and Mexico. Advertisement MLB teams were also newly forbidden from working directly with any employees or associates of teams in those leagues. Before March, MLB had allowed working agreements, so long as they were submitted to the league office for approval. But the league went a step further in the spring after some teams complained about other teams’ arrangements, said one high-ranking club official who was not authorized to speak publicly. “There are certain things — exchange of information, whatever — that (were) perfectly allowable,” Manfred said Wednesday. “The concern with those agreements comes when, for example, the American club has some priority access to players that are under control because it would allow them to expand the number of players they have under control. And we’ve always been scrupulous about not allowing those.” (Top photo of Roki Sasaki: Eugene Hoshiko / Associated Press) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Ahead of Las Vegas GP, Lando Norris admits his first F1 title fight will likely end in defeat",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5937041/2024/11/21/lando-norris-f1-championship-max-verstappen-vegas/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 07:56:50 GMT","Verstappen leads the driver standings with 393 points, 62 points ahead of Norris with three races and a sprint to go.","Formula 1 LAS VEGAS — It may be the start of the final tripleheader of the season, the stint kicking off with Formula One cars zipping down the Strip, but all eyes aren’t on the glitzy and glamorous show like in the Las Vegas Grand Prix’s 2023 debut. A driver championship battle could be decided in Las Vegas come Saturday night. Advertisement Lando Norris sat in the FIA news conference Wednesday evening, fielding question after question about the title fight. And the McLaren driver seems to have come to terms with the fact Max Verstappen could wrap up a fourth consecutive world championship as soon as Saturday. “I kind of know the position I’m in now, and probably I have less to lose now,” Norris said. “You know, the gap to Max is … for the first time, probably when I’ve looked at the gap myself and had the realization of where things stand, and I think post-Brazil was a tough one for me because it was the first moment realistically when I’m like, it’s tough to achieve first position now. “We were on such a good run of form, little by little, you know, it’s hard to get any big points on Max, because he didn’t have any bad races, but I had a tough week because things just didn’t go our way, and my kind of real fight for the championship was slimmed by the biggest margin of almost of the whole year.” Verstappen leads the driver standings with 393 points, 62 points ahead of Norris with three races and a sprint to go before the checkered flag falls on the 2024 season. All the Dutchman needs to do is finish ahead of the Briton to seal the title. Norris said that his approach won’t change heading into this weekend, adding that “my approach has been correct.” “So from my side,” he said, “I need to not change anything (for Saturday’s race), but I think I can probably just go out and enjoy a little bit more.” It’s been the closest world championship battle F1 has seen since Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton went head-to-head in 2021. Since then, the Red Bull driver has won two more titles largely unchallenged. On Wednesday evening, Norris called Verstappen’s win in São Paulo two weeks ago “a defining moment” in this year’s battle. Verstappen won the race by more than 19 seconds, while the McLaren driver finished sixth after an unlucky day. Advertisement “For a week I was pretty down after Brazil because I had that realization that things are pretty much out of my control now, not within reach necessarily,” Norris said. “That’s a tough realization when your hopes and your belief is so high for it to get knocked down so much all of a sudden was pretty demoralizing and not the best of feelings. You learn to accept that. That’s life.” It’s not been a clean season for Norris by any means. Sure, he won his first F1 race in Miami and has bagged two more victories, multiple podium finishes and several pole positions since then. But mistakes have been made, whether on his side or McLaren’s. “I definitely was not at the level I needed to be at the beginning of the year and even Miami point of the season,” Norris said. “Since the summer break, I feel like I’ve done a very good job and performed very, very well, by far some of my best performances that I’ve done. So I’ve been very happy, actually, with how the last few months have gone, honestly. I wouldn’t change many things that have happened. But I still need to make tweaks. I still need to improve on things. That’s clear. You know, I’m not completely satisfied with how I’ve done. I definitely know I need to make improvements.” But the biggest lesson he’s learned through these ups and downs and battles is that he has what it takes to be a world championship contender. “For the first time, I’m confident to say that I have what I think I need to fight for a championship. Doesn’t mean I’m complete, doesn’t mean I’m perfect, that’s for sure,” the 25-year-old said. “And when you’re competing against drivers who are close to that, like Max, you have to be close to perfect if you want to challenge him, you know, and challenge the teams we’re around. “So I’m confident and I think the main thing I can take away is I have faith that I have got what it takes to fight for a championship.” Advertisement The championship is still up for grabs, and Norris is not saying it is over. There is still a chance the McLaren driver can catch Verstappen or at least push the fight to Qatar (which is a sprint race weekend). He’ll need to outscore the Dutchman by three points in Las Vegas, though, for the battle to be extended. “I won’t say it’s over until it is, but you know it’s very far out of reach at the minute, and we’ve been performing well, but I need a lot of luck if anything, if I can,” he continued when asked whether this was “check” like in a chess game, “and it’s pretty much like I’ve got to win three races and Max has to not finish three races in a way. So, yeah, it’s check. And I’m all alone. And Max has all his pawns ready to attack me. “But that’s probably all I know.” (Top photo of Lando Norris: Clive Rose / Getty Images) Madeline Coleman  is a Staff Writer for The Athletic covering Formula One.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Raiders owner Mark Davis agrees in principle to sell 15 percent of team: Source,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936783/2024/11/20/raiders-sale-egon-durban-silver-lake/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 03:56:23 GMT",The agreement comes just over a month after Mark Davis sold about 10.5 percent of the Raiders to a group that includes Tom Brady.,"NFL HENDERSON, Nev. — Las Vegas Raiders owner Mark Davis has agreed in principle to sell 15 percent of the franchise, according to a league source. Silver Lake co-CEO and Endeavor board chairman Egon Durban and Discovery Land Company founder and chairman Michael Meldman have each bid separately to acquire equal 7.5 percent stakes in the Raiders, the source said. Advertisement The NFL finance committee has reviewed the terms of the transaction. The committee could bring the sale up for a vote among NFL owners at the special league meeting from Dec. 10-11 in Irving, Texas. For Durban and Meldman’s bids to become official, at least 24 of the league’s 32 owners would need to approve them in a vote. The agreement comes just over a month after Davis sold about 10.5 percent of the Raiders to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, co-founder of Knighthead Capital Management Tom Wagner and former NFL defensive lineman Richard Seymour. Brady and Wagner purchased stakes worth about 5 percent each while Seymour purchased a 0.5 percent stake. Davis will remain the controlling owner of the Raiders even if Durban and Meldman’s bids are approved. If he wanted to, he could sell nearly all his stakes and still keep decision-making power. That’s because, as of 2022, the NFL dropped the minimum percentage of a team that a longstanding owner must control from 5 percent to 1 percent for teams with the same owner for at least 10 years. Davis has owned the team since his father Al died in 2011, so he would fall into that group. Davis and a Raiders spokesperson did not immediately respond to The Athletic’s request for comment. The reasons why Davis has been selling shares of the Raiders are multifaceted. Part of the appeal in bringing in Brady and Seymour is that they can help Davis make football decisions. Before buying into ownership, Seymour was on the Raiders’ hiring committee that led to the hiring of general manager Tom Telesco and coach Antonio Pierce this offseason. Brady hasn’t had that type of formal involvement yet — he’s been busy working as a Fox analyst — but Davis said he could help the Raiders “select a quarterback in the future and potentially train him as well.” He plans to lean on Brady’s football knowledge and called it a “huge benefit to the organization.” Advertisement As for the transactions with Wagner, Durban and Meldman, the primary motivator appears to be Davis becoming more liquid. The value of the Raiders has skyrocketed since their relocation from Oakland to Las Vegas. Earlier this year, CNBC valued the franchise at $7.8 billion. To be clear, that’s not the number that Davis will be paid based on because a valuation is based on the estimated price the Raiders would draw if Davis sold the entire stake. While the exact terms are unknown, Davis still raked in hundreds of millions of dollars by selling stakes to Brady, Seymour, Wagner, Durban and Meldman collectively. Something that could complicate Durban’s purchase is that Endeavor, the parent company of WME, has a sports agency arm that represents NFL players and other athletes called WME Sports. Durban owns an interest in WME Sports through Silver Lake, which owns part of Endeavor. NFL rules don’t allow individuals with an ownership stake to represent players and coaches, so for Durban to buy into the Raiders, Endeavor would have to divest WME Sports’ football representation business. According to the Sports Business Journal, Durban has told the NFL finance committee that would happen within four months of the Raiders deal getting done. Again, that’s all expected to be discussed at the NFL special league meeting next month. If things get hashed out, Davis and the Raiders will welcome more members to the ownership group.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Warriors' De'Anthony Melton to undergo season-ending left knee surgery,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936594/2024/11/20/deanthony-melton-injury-acl-warriors/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 02:02:36 GMT",The 26-year-old guard signed a one-year deal with the Warriors last summer. His season ends after just six games in a Golden State jersey.,"NBA The Golden State Warriors’ early-season momentum was dealt a significant blow Wednesday as the team announced guard De’Anthony Melton will need surgery for a partially torn left ACL and will miss the remainder of the 2024-25 season. The 26-year-old Melton, who recently played himself into the starting shooting guard spot next to Steph Curry, signed with the Warriors on a one-year, $12.8 million deal this summer, a contract that was considered team-friendly. He was available at that rate because he was limited to 35 games last season with the Philadelphia 76ers due to a tricky back injury. Advertisement Melton joined Golden State believing he could improve his value with a strong season and re-enter a friendlier free-agent market next summer. That plan has been dashed in the opening month. After turning heads with a strong preseason, Melton looked sharp in his six games with the Warriors. At the end of a recent 4-1 road trip, coach Steve Kerr announced him as the perimeter starter in the backcourt, believing his defensive versatility, offensive playmaking and floor-spacing shooting ability made him a perfect fit next to Curry. Melton was terrific in a home win over the Dallas Mavericks last week, but tweaked his knee during the game and was spotted limping. He still closed the contest, but it was later revealed he suffered an ACL injury. Melton searched out several opinions for the partially torn ACL before season-ending surgery was deemed the best long-term route. The Warriors plan to apply for the $6.4 million disabled player exception, team sources said, but can’t currently use it. They are less than $1 million under the first apron, where they are capped. But it’s possible it could be used later in the season in conjunction with other roster moves, though a scenario where it could prove useful is exceedingly unlikely. In Melton’s place, Kerr is starting Lindy Waters III, a low-price offseason trade target who has impressed with his shot-making. Kerr said second-year guard Brandin Podziemski could eventually elevate into that starting shooting guard spot, but he prefers to keep the bench rotation stable. Podziemski is currently mired in a slump, shooting 38 percent overall and 19 percent from 3. “He’s not shooting the ball with much confidence right now,” Kerr said. “That’s obvious. It’s part of being in the NBA. Everyone goes through stretches where you don’t quite feel it. The way he shot it at the end of last year, all summer, watching him in camp, he’s a really good shooter. He’ll find it.” The Warriors need him to find it, especially without Melton for the rest of the season. (Top photo: David Richard / Imagn) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Geno Auriemma becomes all-time winningest college basketball coach in 40th year at UConn,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936477/2024/11/20/geno-auriemma-uconn-winningest-coach-college-basketball/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 01:48:05 GMT","Geno Auriemma earned his 1,217th win Wednesday night to pass Tara VanDerveer for the record.","NCAAW STORRS, Conn. — UConn women’s basketball coach Geno Auriemma passed Tara VanDerveer as college basketball’s all-time winningest coach with the Huskies’ win over Fairleigh Dickinson on Wednesday night in Storrs. Auriemma earned his 1,217th win. The Huskies’ depth, a rarity the past few seasons due to a rash of injuries, was on full display in the 85-41 victory. UConn used 11 players, including Azzi Fudd, who missed the beginning of this season and all of last season after suffering a knee injury in November 2023. Despite the comfortable win, Auriemma spent the game pacing the sideline, throwing his arms up at missed layups and turnovers. In that way, it felt less like a historic victory and just like any other Huskies’ win. Advertisement “This is yet another outstanding milestone in a career filled with them for Geno Auriemma,” VanDerveer said in a statement. “The level of success he has maintained at UConn over four decades will never be duplicated. But his tremendous legacy extends far beyond any number of wins. “It lives in the lives of the countless young women he has positively influenced throughout his career. Congratulations to Geno and Chris on this incredible accomplishment.” Auriemma, 70, is in his 40th season as a head coach — all at UConn. He has led the Huskies to six undefeated seasons (the rest of women’s college basketball accounts for four total), 11 national titles and 23 Final Fours. Alone, he has more NCAA Tournament wins than any program in men’s or women’s college basketball. Auriemma has won the Naismith Coach of the Year award eight times, and he experienced just one losing season — his first at UConn. The Huskies have produced 26 All-Americans (including 17 multi-time honorees), 27 WNBA first-round draft picks and five No. 1 picks, with UConn senior Paige Bueckers expected to go No. 1 to Dallas in the 2025 WNBA Draft. Understanding that Auriemma would surpass VanDerveer with a win over Fairleigh Dickinson, UConn planned to celebrate the anniversary of Auriemma and longtime assistant Chris Dailey’s hiring. More than 60 program alumni — including Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi, Maya Moore and Napheesa Collier — attended the game. Auriemma and Dailey were honored at halfcourt with a tribute video and glass-blown basketball engraved with “40 seasons of excellence” before the game. The sheer number of alumni at Gampel Pavilion, and how well-known so many are because of their storied college and WNBA careers, speaks to Auriemma’s longevity and consistency. He reached the record by winning 88 percent of his games thus far. VanDerveer, who retired from Stanford after last season, won 82 percent during her career while former Duke men’s coach Mike Krzyzewski, who held the record before VanDerveer, won 77 percent of his games. Auriemma arrived in Storrs as a first-time coach in 1985. UConn’s program had experienced just one winning season in its 11-year history. Auriemma thought he would stay for a few years until a more well-established program came calling. After the Huskies’ first trip to the Final Four in 1991, Auriemma didn’t receive any calls, but by then, his thoughts on the program had changed and he believed that he and Dailey could build sustainable success in Storrs. With the commitment of All-American Rebecca Lobo in 1991, the program’s fortunes began to turn. In 1995, Lobo’s senior season, UConn won its first national title. Advertisement That national title run put the Huskies on the map and allowed Auriemma’s recruiting to improve significantly. In 1998, he signed a class that could still be argued as the best recruiting class in women’s basketball history — Sue Bird, Swin Cash, Ashja Jones and Tamika Williams. That core won the program’s second and third NCAA titles and those four players were drafted in the top six of the 2002 WNBA Draft. By the early 2000s, UConn had officially established itself as one of the nation’s blueblood programs alongside Tennessee and Stanford. Taurasi, Tina Charles and Moore carried the Huskies’ success through the rest of the 2000s, ushering in the Breanna Stewart era and the most dominant stretch in college basketball. From 2013 to 2016, the Huskies won four national titles and set a college basketball record by winning 111 consecutive games. With his success in the college ranks and with so many UConn players in the national team pool, it wasn’t a surprise when Team USA tabbed Auriemma as coach in 2009 to lead the U.S. for the 2012 and 2016 Olympic Games, becoming the only coach in women’s Olympic basketball history to lead the team twice.

Madden 25 announced Wednesday evening that its latest update will add the Philadelphia Eagles running back’s impressive play as a playable move in the game. The move, dubbed the “spin hurdle” by the Madden team, was executed by Barkley in the Eagles’ win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. The play left the league — fans and players alike — in utter disbelief. Eagles coach Nick Sirianni called it “the best play I’ve ever seen,” adding, “He’s probably the only one in the world that could do that.” Advertisement It even took Madden’s developers by surprise. Game designer Spade said he and the rest of the Madden team knew right away they wanted the move in the game. “It’s rare, this day and age, to see something that’s never been done before. That’s when we knew we wanted it in-game,” said Spade via EA Sports’ notes from the development team.     A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  Barkley himself couldn’t quite put the moment into words. “I kinda just let go, and let my body just react,” Barkley said after Week 9. “That play was cool.” This is not the first viral moment Madden has added to its games. The franchise has been quick to add player celebrations to the game, like Justin Jefferson’s “Griddy” dance or Aaron Rodgers’ “championship belt” celebration. Madden has also immortalized signature plays, like Odell Beckham Jr.’s signature one-handed catch from 2014 with the New York Giants.

MLB News,Snell has met with these teams (report),https://www.mlb.com/news/blake-snell-rumors,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 13:24:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and rumors surrounding Blake Snell. Nov. 21: Snell has started meeting with teams (report)After lingering on the market until mid-March in his first try at free agency last offseason, Snell isn’t wasting any time in his second go-round. According to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required), the left-hander has already met with the Red Sox and Dodgers. It’s possible he also met, or will meet, with the Orioles and Blue Jays, per Rosenthal's report. Other clubs could be in the mix for Snell as well. During his Wednesday chat on Bleacher Report, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman mentioned that Yankees and Giants are interested in Snell. (Heyman also tied the Dodgers to Snell.) The left-handed ace spent the 2024 season with the Giants and was one of the best starters in baseball over the second half of the season. Heyman said he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if Snell re-signed with the club. ""[Snell] loved San Francisco and he thrived in San Francisco, and if you love San Francisco, there's a good chance you end up in San Francisco,"" Heyman said. The Yankees are focused on bringing Juan Soto back to the Bronx, but if they do so, Heyman said he doesn't think the team will also spend the money necessary to get a pitcher like Snell. Nov. 16: Snell reportedly in talks with Red SoxESPN's Jeff Passan said during Friday's edition of the Baseball Bar-B-Cast podcast that the Red Sox are talking to Snell as well as fellow left-handed ace Max Fried. Last week, MLB.com's Mark Feinsand identified the Red Sox as one of the top suitors for Snell, who is a free agent for the second straight offseason and whose stock on the open market should be higher this year than after he won his second Cy Young Award in 2023. Signing Snell would give Boston two things its rotation didn't have last season: a left-hander and a bona fide No. 1 starter. Nov. 6: How many teams are in on Snell?Following his fantastic second half of the 2024 season, Blake Snell is expected to draw interest from many big-market clubs. MLB.com's Mark Feinsand has listed the Giants, Yankees, Mets, Red Sox, Dodgers, Orioles and Blue Jays among the left-hander's potential suitors. An industry source also told Katie Woo and Will Sammon of The Athletic (subscription required) that the Rangers could be in the mix as well. However, that source added that the extent of interest from Toronto and Texas depends on Snell's price tag. Snell opted out of his two-year, $62 million deal with the Giants last week. Although Snell carried a 9.51 ERA through his first six starts with San Francisco and went on the injured list twice within the season's first three months, he was one of the most dominant starters in the Majors over the final three months. That period included 114 strikeouts over 80 1/3 innings and a .382 opponents' OPS. Of course, Snell is just one year removed from winning the NL Cy Young Award with the Padres, the second of his career. Feinsand wrote that Snell's next contract should exceed $27 million in annual average value -- the AAV of Carlos Rodón's six-year deal with the Yankees that he signed prior to the 2023 season. However, Snell's deal might come with fewer guaranteed years since he is entering his age-32 campaign. Rodón was 30 when he joined the Yanks.",2024-11-21,0,0.59,0.41
MLB News,Are Cubs looking to trade this former MVP?,https://www.mlb.com/news/cubs-rumors-latest-trades-and-signings,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 14:35:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of all the latest Cubs-related free agent and trade rumors right here. Nov. 21: Cubs want to trade Bellinger (report)Although outfielder/first baseman Cody Bellinger exercised his player option for 2025, it’s not a guarantee that he’ll be with the Cubs on Opening Day. According to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required), rival executives say that the Cubs want to trade the 29-year-old. Bellinger’s contract -- he’s owed $27.5 million in 2025 and can earn $25 million in 2026 by picking up his player option -- could limit the return for the Cubs. But if they are truly motivated to move him, they should be able to find a suitor. Bellinger’s production regressed in 2024, but he still had a solid 111 OPS+. He has also proven capable of handling center field, a weak position in this year’s free-agent market. Rosenthal mentions the Yankees as a possible fit for Bellinger if they aren’t able to re-sign Juan Soto, noting that the Bronx Bombers have shown interest in Bellinger in the past. Bellinger could potentially be a backup option for some of the other teams involved in the Soto sweepstakes as well. Trading Bellinger would add more payroll flexibility for the Cubs to address their top priority this offseason, which is pitching. But while Chicago’s interest in adding a starter is clear, there have been conflicting reports about which arms the team might target. On Wednesday, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman mentioned the Cubs among the teams in the mix to sign one of the three aces currently available via free agency: Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell and Max Fried. However, The Athletic's (subscription required) Sahadev Sharma reports that the Cubs have “ruled out” that tier of free-agent hurlers and could also stay away from other pitchers who declined a qualifying offer, including Sean Manaea, Luis Severino and Nick Pivetta. Sharma mentions Yusei Kikuchi, Nathan Eovaldi and Jack Flaherty as possible options. Nov. 20: Cubs acquire Morgan and Thaiss, DFA WisdomThe Cubs acquired reliever Eli Morgan from the Guardians in exchange for outfield prospect Alfonsin Rosario (No. 21 on Pipeline’s Top 30 list for the Cubs) on Wednesday. The Cubs also shored up their catching depth on Wednesday, acquiring Matt Thaiss from the Angels. To clear room on the 40-man roster for their new acquisitions, Chicago designated Patrick Wisdom and Trey Wingenter for assignment.",2024-11-21,0,0.6,0.4
MLB News,Teams to win 2 of 3 major BBWAA player awards,https://www.mlb.com/news/same-team-won-mvp-cy-young-and-rookie-of-year-award,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 23:26:00 GMT","No club has swept MVP, Cy Young and Rookie of the Year honors","Paul Casella No MLB team has swept the three major Baseball Writers' Association of America player awards -- Most Valuable Player, Cy Young and Rookie of the Year -- in a single season. While that continued in 2024, we saw one team, the Yankees, take home two of the three honors: Luis Gil received the AL Rookie of the Year Award, and Aaron Judge was named AL MVP for the second time in his career. Overall, 56 teams have claimed two of those three awards in a single season. Prior to 2024, it last occurred in 2019 when the Astros and Mets won their respective league's Cy Young Award (Justin Verlander, Jacob deGrom) and Rookie of the Year Award (Yordan Alvarez, Pete Alonso). Houston's Alex Bregman finished as the runner-up to Mike Trout for AL MVP, leaving the Astros on the doorstep of an awards sweep. Those 56 instances include 19 times when the same club produced specifically the MVP and Cy Young winner (not including years in which a pitcher won both awards on his own). It's happened only four times since the league expanded to 30 teams in 1998, with the most recent occurrence coming in 2013. That was when Tigers teammates Miguel Cabrera (AL MVP) and Max Scherzer (AL Cy Young) earned the honors. Below is a breakdown of each of those four instances, followed by a closer look at teams that came close to making history by sweeping the three awards. 2013 Tigers: Miguel Cabrera (AL MVP), Max Scherzer (AL Cy Young)One year after earning the 2012 AL batting Triple Crown and edging out Trout in the AL MVP race, Cabrera again held off the Angels superstar in '13 AL MVP voting. Cabrera took home his second straight AL MVP honor after hitting .348/.442/.636 with 44 homers and 137 RBIs. That was good enough to earn 23 first-place votes, while Trout claimed only five as the runner-up. The AL Cy Young race was even more of a runaway, with Scherzer claiming 28 of the 30 first-place votes after going 21-3 with a 2.90 ERA and 240 strikeouts. Tigers teammate Aníbal Sánchez earned one of the remaining two first-place votes, while the other went to Chris Sale. In fact, the Tigers nearly completed the awards trifecta after a midseason three-team blockbuster brought José Iglesias to Detroit. The infielder, who began the year with the Red Sox, finished as the AL Rookie of the Year runner-up behind Tampa Bay's Wil Myers. 2006 Twins: Justin Morneau (AL MVP), Johan Santana (AL Cy Young)While Morneau narrowly edged out Derek Jeter in a tightly contested battle for the 2006 AL MVP Award, Santana was a unanimous winner for the AL Cy Young Award. Santana took home all 28 first-place votes after going 19-6 with a 2.77 ERA and 245 strikeouts for the Twins. Morneau, meanwhile, racked up 34 homers and 130 RBIs en route to receiving 15 first-place votes for the AL MVP Award. That was enough to keep Derek Jeter (12 first-place votes) from earning his first MVP honor, despite the Yankees shortstop hitting .343 with 14 homers, 97 RBIs and 34 stolen bases. Minnesota teammate Francisco Liriano finished a distant third in AL Rookie of the Year voting, with future ace Justin Verlander claiming 26 of the 28 first-place votes in his impressive rookie campaign. 2005 Cardinals: Albert Pujols (NL MVP), Chris Carpenter (NL Cy Young)Pujols held off Braves outfielder Andruw Jones to win the first of his three NL MVP Awards in 2005. The then-Cardinals first baseman hit .330 with 41 homers, 117 RBIs, 16 stolen bases and a 1.039 OPS to receive 18 first-place votes. Jones was a close second, garnering 13 first-place votes after finishing with 51 homers and 128 RBIs, albeit a .263 average and .922 OPS. Carpenter, meanwhile, earned 19 first-place votes after going 21-5 with a 2.83 ERA and NL-leading 213 strikeouts to beat out Dontrelle Willis (11 first-place votes) and Roger Clemens (two first-place votes) for the NL Cy Young Award. The Cards did not have anyone earn an NL Rookie of the Year vote, though skipper Tony La Russa finished second in NL Manager of the Year voting behind Bobby Cox. 2002 Athletics: Miguel Tejada (AL MVP), Barry Zito (AL Cy Young)Both of these voting results could have turned out very different if conducted today. Tejada beat out Alex Rodriguez in a bit of a controversial race, as Tejada had an .861 OPS, 34 homers, 131 RBIs and a 5.7 WAR, while A-Rod put up a 1.015 WAR, 57 home runs, 142 RBIs and an 8.8 WAR. Zito also won a close battle, holding off Pedro Martinez thanks, in part, to wins and innings pitched. Though Zito had more wins (23 to Martinez's 20) and pitched 30 more innings, it was Martinez who had a sizable edge in ERA (2.26 to 2.75), strikeouts (239 to 182) and WHIP (0.92 to 1.13). Regardless, it was Zito who claimed the AL Cy Young Award after receiving 17 first-place votes to Martinez's 11.

It's happened only 37 times when removing years in which the same player accounted for both, such as Kershaw winning the NL MVP and Cy Young Awards for the ‘14 Dodgers, or Ichiro Suzuki taking home AL MVP and Rookie of the Year honors for the '01 Mariners. Of those 55 instances, that same team was responsible for the runner-up for the third award just nine times. That number drops to seven when removing cases that include the same player vying for multiple awards. In other words, only seven times in MLB history has the same team had three different players account for winning two of the awards and finishing second for the other. Below is a list of those nine times the same team won two of three awards and produced the runner-up for the third. ^Indicates player was a runner-up Obviously, not every runner-up finish is created equal. Jason Bere finished second in the 1993 AL Rookie of the Year race, but the White Sox right-hander did not receive a single first-place vote in his quest to join teammates Frank Thomas (AL MVP) and Jack McDowell (AL Cy Young) in the winner's circle. Angels outfielder Tim Salmon was voted the unanimous AL Rookie of the Year that season. Likewise, Cardinals left-hander John Tudor received zero first-place votes in his runner-up finish for the 1985 NL Cy Young Award (Dwight Gooden was the unanimous winner). Orioles right-hander Jim Palmer was also second to unanimous '73 AL MVP winner Reggie Jackson, though Palmer at least took home the AL Cy Young Award that season, while teammate Al Bumbry was named the AL Rookie of the Year. While those three runners-up did not receive any first-place votes, Dennis Eckersley and Reggie Smith each received exactly one first-place vote, respectively, in the 1988 AL Cy Young and '67 AL Rookie of the Year races. Eckersley lost out to Frank Viola, who received the other 27 votes, while Smith yielded way to Rod Carew. That leaves three truly close calls -- the 2019 Astros, 1974 Rangers and '65 Dodgers. While Verlander and Alvarez claimed the AL Cy Young and Rookie of the Year Awards, respectively, Bregman finished as the runner-up in AL MVP voting to Mike Trout. The Astros third baseman received 13 first-place votes, but Trout claimed the remaining 17 first-place votes en route to winning his third AL MVP Award. Trout edged out Bregman in total voting points by a margin of 355-335. As for the 1974 Rangers, outfielder Jeff Burroughs held off a trio of Athletics -- Joe Rudi, Sal Bando and Reggie Jackson -- for the 1974 AL MVP Award. Teammate Mike Hargrove won the AL Rookie of the Year Award in decisive fashion, beating out Bucky Dent and George Brett. That left only the AL Cy Young Award. Texas right-hander Fergie Jenkins went 25-12 with a 2.82 ERA, 225 strikeouts and 29 complete games in 1974 -- but it wasn't enough. Jenkins' 10 first-place votes were two fewer than Oakland righty -- and fellow future Hall of Famer -- Catfish Hunter, who received 12 votes after posting an identical 25-12 record to go along with a 2.49 ERA, 143 strikeouts and 23 complete games. Moving on to the 1965 Dodgers, Sandy Koufax was the unanimous Cy Young Award winner at a time when the award was given to only one player across the Majors, instead of one from each league. That same year, Dodgers infielder Jim Lefebvre easily claimed Rookie of the Year honors over future Hall of Famer Joe Morgan. As for the NL MVP race, the Dodgers actually had two of the top three finishers -- and three of the top five. Koufax received six first-place votes to go along with his Cy Young Award, and teammate Maury Wills received five first-place votes. Neither had enough to edge Giants outfielder Willie Mays, who received the other nine first-place votes after racking up 52 homers and 112 RBIs. Though those are the three closest calls since the Cy Young Award was first handed out in 1956, it's worth mentioning the 1952 Philadelphia Athletics. Left-hander Bobby Shantz won the AL MVP Award, while teammate and fellow pitcher Harry Byrd won AL Rookie of the Year honors. The Cy Young Award did not exist yet, but it stands to reason that Shantz would have won the award for the league's best pitcher, considering he won the AL MVP Award in convincing fashion -- and the MVP on the NL side was outfielder Hank Sauer.",2024-11-21,1,0.24,0.76
MLB News,"With 'extreme urgency,' Red Sox pursuing star FAs",https://www.mlb.com/news/red-sox-rumors-latest-trades-and-signings,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 21:45:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of all the latest free-agent and trade rumors involving the Red Sox right here. Nov. 21: Red Sox meet with Snell; Boston also talking to Burnes, Fried (report)The Red Sox have made their pitch -- or at least an initial one -- to Juan Soto. They are apparently trying to convince one of the top starting pitchers on the market to come to Fenway, too. According to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required), the Red Sox have met with free-agent southpaw Blake Snell. Per Rosenthal, they are ""covering their bases"" by talking to Corbin Burnes and Max Fried as well. Boston was previously linked to both Snell and Fried by ESPN's Jeff Passan. Red Sox president and CEO Sam Kennedy confirmed to The Boston Globe on Wednesday that the Red Sox did meet with Soto and said there is ""extreme urgency internally"" for the team to do whatever it takes to compete for an AL East title in 2025. That includes the possibility of taking the team's payroll beyond the Competitive Balance Tax threshold of $241 million. ""We are investing more than we did last year,"" Kennedy said. ""... Look, we have to add, and that’s what we’re trying to do, but I think we’re in a good position to add right now."" As for what Boston will add, Kennedy said ""everything is on the table,"" but singled out pitching as a ""high priority."" Boston's starting staff tied for seventh best in ERA this past season (3.81) and has three solid arms in the prime of their careers coming back next season: Brayan Bello, Tanner Houck and Kutter Crawford. The club also expects to get Lucas Giolito back next year after he missed all of 2024 while recovering from right elbow surgery. However, Boston has a vacancy to address on its starting staff after free agent Nick Pivetta turned down the team's qualifying offer. Adding one of the elite arms on the market would not only fill that hole but also give the Red Sox the bona fide ace they've lacked since Chris Sale was in his prime. Nov 15: Soto has 'productive' 3-hour meeting with Red Sox (report)The Red Sox met with Soto and his representatives, including agent Scott Boras, in Southern California on Thursday night, according to a report from Sean McAdam of MassLive. The meeting, which was of an introductory and informative nature, lasted for three hours and was deemed as “productive,” though neither money nor terms were discussed between the parties. Soto was reportedly “impressed” by Boston’s presentation, which included a video noting the franchise’s history of star players from the Dominican Republic, Soto’s native country. The Red Sox also detailed their plans for the future, highlighting a promising group of prospects who could potentially team up with Soto to help the club be successful in the years to come. Soto is expected to continue to meet with more teams in Southern California over the next few days. Nov. 12: Red Sox have Soto atop their 'want list'The Red Sox are expected to meet with Juan Soto this week, per a report from ESPN's Jeff Passan (subscription required). He adds that Boston has Soto ""at the top of its want list."" The Red Sox join the Mets, Yankees and Blue Jays as teams that have meetings scheduled with Soto -- Toronto's meeting will be first, according to Passan -- while teams such as the Dodgers and Rays have shown interest. Passan expects Soto to sign with a team before the end of the year, and maybe even by the MLB Winter Meetings, which begin on Dec. 9. He writes that the Mets and Yankees are still the favorites to land the 26-year-old superstar. Boston has other free agents in its sights besides Soto. Passan reports that the club is in on left-handed starter Max Fried and right-handed slugger Teoscar Hernández. The Red Sox would also like to bring back outfielder Tyler O'Neill and are interested in trading for White Sox ace Garrett Crochet. Nov. 7: Are Red Sox the favorites to acquire Crochet?The Red Sox have six position players on MLB Pipeline's Top 100 Prospects list, including three in the top 10. They also have a few attractive pieces already at the big league level who are not yet eligible for arbitration. That group includes first baseman Triston Casas, catcher Connor Wong and Gold Glove outfielder Wilyer Abreu. With so much high-quality position-player depth, ""there’s a widespread sense that the Sox can trade for nearly anyone,"" according to The Boston Globe's Alex Speier (subscription required). Many starters could be options for the pitching-needy Red Sox, but one who stands out is White Sox left-hander Garrett Crochet. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi said Thursday from the General Managers Meetings that the Red Sox are ""the team I think a lot of people around here are looking at very carefully"" regarding a Crochet trade. White Sox general manager Chris Getz said Tuesday that there is more interest surrounding Crochet now than at this season's Trade Deadline and that Chicago is focused on adding position players in trades. As such, the Red Sox and White Sox seem like a good match to make a deal. Crochet, 25, is under club control for two more seasons. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. But it's not a lock that Boston will add a notable starter via trade. Instead, it could get what it needs via free agency. According to The Boston Globe's Pete Abraham, the Red Sox have told multiple agents at the GM Meetings that they ""plan to be active in the free-agent market."" Corbin Burnes, Jack Flaherty, Blake Snell and Max Fried are some of the top starting pitchers on the open market. But no matter how they do it, the Red Sox need to add a front-line starter this offseason. Nov. 5: Red Sox extend qualifying offer to Pivetta, who has 'surprisingly strong' marketThe Red Sox gave the qualifying offer to starting pitcher Nick Pivetta on Monday. The right-hander has until 4 p.m. ET on Nov. 19 to either accept or decline the one-year offer, which would pay him $21.05 million for the 2025 season. If Pivetta accepts, he returns to Boston on a one-year deal. If he declines, he can negotiate a free-agent deal with all teams, including the Red Sox. By extending Pivetta a qualifying offer, the Red Sox ensured they will get a comp pick in the 2025 MLB Draft if he signs with another team. Pivetta, 31, was one of 13 MLB players to receive a qualifying offer on Monday. From 2012 (when the system was implemented) through 2023, only 13 of the 131 players who received a QO accepted it. It's an ""interesting decision"" for Pivetta, according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Accepting the QO would represent quite a raise for the right-hander, who made $7.5 million this season. But there appear to be multiple teams interested the 31-year-old. Per MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi, Pivetta has a ""surprisingly strong"" market. Although he turned in a 4.14 ERA this season, Pivetta's expected ERA was significantly better (3.59). Pivetta has also increased his strikeout numbers over the past two seasons and ranked among MLB's top 10 starting pitchers this year (minimum 140 innings pitched) in K-BB rate. His 22.9% mark sat sixth between Jack Flaherty and Logan Gilbert.",2024-11-21,1,0.48,0.52
MLB News,3 reasons Sasaki should thrive in the Majors,https://www.mlb.com/news/roki-sasaki-statcast-preview-for-mlb,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 04:07:55 GMT",,"David Adler The Monster of the Reiwa is coming to Major League Baseball. So let's take a look at Roki Sasaki's monstrous stuff. The 23-year-old fireballer has dominated in Japan, and he has the electric arsenal to do the same in MLB. We know he does. We saw it on the international stage at the 2023 World Baseball Classic -- where there was Statcast tracking for both of Sasaki's starts, against the Czech Republic and Mexico. That means we have data on Sasaki already. And the early numbers show you why he's going to be one of the most coveted Japanese superstars ever to jump to the Major Leagues. Here's a preview of the type of stuff we're hoping to see from Sasaki in MLB, based on what we saw from him at the World Baseball Classic. 1) He should have one of the highest-octane fastballs in the Majors Sasaki's four-seamer in the WBC averaged 100.3 mph. He topped out at 101.9 mph, hitting that mark three times. Forty-seven of his 65 tracked fastballs -- 72%, nearly three-quarters -- reached triple digits. A dozen of those were at least 101 mph. Let's take a look at the Major Leagues in 2024. The only starting pitcher to hit 100 mph that many times in the full season was Paul Skenes … the phenom whose status Sasaki will rival as one of the most-hyped MLB pitching prospects ever. Skenes threw exactly 100 pitches 100 mph or faster in his rookie season. Sasaki's best heater of the tournament was a 101.8 mph fastball to blow away Randy Arozarena. Sasaki threw it right down Broadway; Arozarena still couldn't catch up. Roki Sasaki, 102mph ⛽️ pic.twitter.com/UZAy7HjI4w Sasaki also got whiffs on four-seamers clocked at 101.3 mph (a strikeout of the Czech Republic's William Escala), 101.3 mph again, 100.7 mph, 100.2 mph and 100.1 mph. He generated a 35% whiff rate overall. He also showed good ride on his four-seamer in the WBC, averaging 17 inches of induced vertical break -- which would make it an above-average ""rising"" fastball that would likely get swings-and-misses -- as well as 12 inches of arm-side run. Because Sasaki's start against Mexico in the WBC semifinals was at the Marlins' loanDepot park, it was tracked by Hawk-Eye high-speed cameras. So we can see just how a Sasaki fastball explodes toward the hitter via 3D tracking. If Sasaki brings anything close to his WBC fastball to the big leagues, it'll be a big-time heater, similar to the ones some of MLB's top power pitchers throw. The questions are what that velo and rise will look like over a full Major League season instead of a short tournament where pitchers let it rip with everything they have -- especially after Sasaki's velo dipped in the 2024 NPB season. He averaged close to 99 mph over the 2023 season after returning from the World Baseball Classic, but this year, Sasaki's four-seamer averaged just under 97 mph, according to available NPB data. That may have been due to him dealing with injuries during the season -- an oblique injury as well as arm issues that have been reported as arm soreness or shoulder fatigue. If Sasaki arrives in the Majors at full health, and his fastball velo is back up to where we've seen it, look out. Shohei Ohtani 102 mph vs. Roki Sasaki 102 mph pic.twitter.com/9agDHl0MdM 2) His splitter might be the best in the world Triple-digit fastballs turn heads, but the gem of Sasaki's arsenal is his splitter. It might be the best splitter in the world already, and it could be the best splitter in the Majors in 2025. Sasaki's splitter in the WBC averaged 90.9 mph. He threw it as hard as 93 mph -- and that one got a swing-and-miss from Alex Verdugo. Only three Major League starters averaged a 90-plus mph splitter in 2024: the Angels' José Soriano (92.6 mph), the Rays' Taj Bradley and the Dodgers' Yoshinobu Yamamoto (90.2 mph), in whose footsteps Sasaki will be following. You can count Skenes' 94 mph splinker, too, if you want -- it gets classified as a sinker but it's a hybrid pitch with splitter movement. At that high velocity, Sasaki's splitter movement is just filthy. It drops a ton, averaging 33 inches of downward vertical movement in the WBC. As for the horizontal break? That's kind of unique. Sometimes Sasaki's splitter fades … sometimes it cuts. It can break in either direction, and that makes it even more unfair.

Rōki Sasaki, 99mph Fastball and 91mph Splitter, Overlay. pic.twitter.com/kxw6dTI9TT The World Baseball Classic hitters' swings against the Sasaki split-finger showed just how unfair. He induced a 60% whiff rate with his splitter in the tournament, getting 18 whiffs on 30 swings. He got eight strikeouts on the pitch -- all swinging. That absurd swing-and-miss rate has stayed true in NPB, even with Sasaki's splitter velocity dropping a little bit, like his fastball, from right around 90 mph in 2023 after the WBC to just above 88 mph in 2024. His splitter whiff rate was 52% in 2023 … and 57% in 2024. Those whiffs should translate straight to MLB -- after all, he was making plenty of MLB hitters look silly in the WBC. Here's what some of those splitters look like with 3D tracking. Like Skenes with his ""splinker,"" Sasaki has a wipeout offspeed pitch that steals the show from his 100 mph heaters. Of all the great Japanese aces who've brought elite splitters to MLB -- Shohei Ohtani, Yamamoto, Shota Imanaga, Kodai Senga -- Sasaki's just might be the best one. Rōki Sasaki, 92mph Splitter and 102mph Fastball, Individual Pitches + Overlay pic.twitter.com/pSu8cvaW9n 3) His slider has nasty potential Sasaki barely even needed his slider in the World Baseball Classic, thanks to his ridiculous fastball-splitter combo. But he does throw a slider, and it does have the makings of a plus No. 3 pitch that he can use in the big leagues -- especially if he can throw the hard, bullet slider that a lot of MLB aces do. Roki Sasaki's arsenal in slow motion 🤩Fastballs: 100 mph, 101 mphSplitters: 92 mph, 91 mphSliders: 89 mph, 90 mphPitches from his 11-strikeout gem to outduel Yoshinobu Yamamoto pic.twitter.com/3WqftblbwY Sasaki's slider in the WBC looked close to that kind of hard slider/cutter hybrid style of pitch, as he averaged 88 mph with about six inches of horizontal break, getting pretty tight movement. He got some nice swings-and-misses on it, too, including one against Arozarena at 88.2 mph and a nasty strikeout of the Czech Republic's Martin Muzik at 89.1 mph. Here's what a Sasaki slider looks like in 3D. Sasaki will need to get that ""hard slider"" velocity back when he comes to MLB. His velo on that pitch dropped a lot in NPB this year, from close to 88 mph in 2023 following the WBC all the way down to under 84 mph in 2024. As pitching analyst Lance Brozdowski notes in his great breakdown of Sasaki's repertoire, he doesn't seem to have enough spin on his slider to be able to turn it into the slower, more horizontal ""sweeper"" variety as a Major Leaguer. But if Sasaki is throwing his World Baseball Classic slider in the big leagues, that's a different story. If he has the fastball, splitter and slider all working, like he showcased in 2023, then MLB will have its next great young ace.",2024-11-21,0,0.55,0.45

Many industry insiders expect Burnes to land a deal worth more than $200 million, a number Fried is not projected to approach.

Will the Braves try to bring the lefty back, or will he wind up in a new uniform? Let’s take a look at how Fried's offseason might play out. BLUE JAYSToronto is eager to rebound from a tough 2024 season, and with one year left until both Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette become free agents, the Blue Jays need to make some additions this winter to get back into the postseason picture. They’ll take a run at Juan Soto, but adding a top starting pitcher to go along with Kevin Gausman, Chris Bassitt and José Berríos could be the best path to contention. BRAVESAtlanta hasn’t been afraid to hand out extensions to its stars in recent years, locking up Ronald Acuña Jr., Austin Riley, Matt Olson, Ozzie Albies, Spencer Strider, Sean Murphy and Michael Harris II with long-term deals. The Braves allowed Fried to reach free agency, and after he declined the qualifying offer, Atlanta will recoup Draft picks if he signs elsewhere. A return to the Braves isn’t out of the question, but it doesn’t seem likely. DODGERSGiven the Dodgers’ injury issues within the rotation last season, adding a dependable starter would seem to be on their to-do list this winter. Fried has thrown at least 165 innings in four of the past five 162-game seasons, and as a Southern California native who grew up going to games at Dodger Stadium, he won’t have to be sold on the perks of living in Los Angeles. GIANTSBlake Snell’s decision to opt out of the final year of his contract has the Giants looking for another ace to pair with Logan Webb, and Fried and Burnes are among the top candidates. Oracle Park’s pitcher-friendly dimensions have made it difficult for the Giants to recruit top hitters, but free-agent starters will have a far different view of the ballpark. METSEven as they try to win the Juan Soto sweepstakes, the Mets have a lot of work to do with their rotation, with Sean Manaea, Luis Severino and Jose Quintana all free agents. The Mets are very familiar with Fried, who is 9-5 with a 2.48 ERA in 23 career outings against New York, including a 4-3 record and 2.57 ERA in 14 outings at Citi Field. ORIOLESBaltimore faces the loss of ace Burnes, potentially leaving a huge hole atop the rotation. Fried doesn’t have a Cy Young Award like Burnes, but he’s been an All-Star in two of the past three seasons and would be a more-than-suitable replacement as the Orioles’ No. 1 starter. RANGERSNathan Eovaldi’s decision to test free agency could leave the Rangers with a sizeable hole atop their rotation, with Max Scherzer and Andrew Heaney also free agents. Jack Leiter and Kumar Rocker could move into the rotation, but adding a top starter should be a priority, especially if Eovaldi signs elsewhere. RED SOXThe Red Sox appear to be all in on starting pitching this offseason, with hurlers including Fried, Burnes and Snell all drawing interest. Fried is a high school teammate of Boston righty Lucas Giolito, who could help recruit the longtime Braves starter to join him in Boston. YANKEESThe Yankees’ current focus is re-signing Soto, but should they lose the superstar slugger, they seem likely to pivot to another top free agent. Gerrit Cole’s return erased the need for an ace, but adding Fried or another top starter to a group that already includes AL Rookie of the Year Luis Gil, Carlos Rodón, Nestor Cortes, Clarke Schmidt and Marcus Stroman would give the Yankees incredible pitching depth. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. “Coming off a strong season, Fried is sure to get a sizeable pay bump. One of the considerations of giving Fried the long-term contract at the average annual value he is looking for is that he has only thrown 170 innings twice in his career, though both came in the past three years. Other than a Tommy John surgery early in his career, Fried’s injury history hasn’t stopped him from being a mainstay in the Braves' rotation, so his consistency should land him a strong nine-figure contract.” Fried’s 8% walk rate in 2024 was his highest since 2020, marking the second straight season that number has gone in the wrong direction. His 24.1% whiff rate was also down, coming in at his lowest mark since his rookie year in 2017. One other number to watch: Fried’s 34.6 hard-hit percentage was his highest since 2019, though he remained in the top 20% of the league in that category. Carlos Rodón was entering his age-30 season when he reached free agency, while Fried will be 31 in January, but Fried’s track record is far lengthier than Rodón’s was when he landed his six-year, $162 million deal with the Yankees. Aaron Nola was heading into his age-31 campaign when he signed his seven-year, $172 million deal with the Phillies last year, though Fried might not a find a deal of that length. A five- or six-year deal with an average annual value between $25 million and $28 million should be within Fried’s reach.",2024-11-21,0,0.76,0.24
MLB News,Which teams are vying for the top FA starting pitchers?,https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-rumors-trades-and-signings,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 14:40:00 GMT",LATEST FREE AGENT & TRADE RUMORS,"MLB.com We're keeping track of all the latest free agent and trade rumors. The demand is high, but the supply is low. That's the story for teams looking to sign a frontline starting pitcher in free agency this offseason. The best arms available are Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell and Max Fried. You could add Japanese right-hander Roki Sasaki to that group, but he hasn't yet been posted for MLB teams, so he's not officially a free agent at the moment. As for those other three pitchers, at least seven teams have been connected to them in recent reports. Dodgers: The reigning World Series champions are one of the teams that have met with Snell already but are also talking to Burnes and Fried, according to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required). They ""like Snell a lot,"" per MLB Network insider Jon Heyman. The Dodgers are considered among the favorites for Sasaki, but Heyman reported last week in the New York Post that L.A. will try to sign one of the Big Three even if they land the Japanese phenom. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi sees the Dodgers as one of the two leading candidates for Burnes. Red Sox: Like the Dodgers, the Red Sox have met with Snell already but are keeping their options open with Burnes and Fried, Rosenthal reports. Orioles: With Burnes a free agent after spending 2024 with Baltimore, Orioles general manager Mike Elias said Friday that the team’s new ownership group has given him the flexibility to engage with the top starting pitchers on the free-agent market. Rosenthal hears the team is currently more focused on Snell and Fried, both of whom could have lower price tags than Burnes. Blue Jays: Rosenthal reports that Toronto is pursuing Burnes, Snell and Fried. Yankees: Heyman directly mentioned the Yankees' interest in Snell, but he added that New York's willingness to go after one of the top starters may be contingent on whether it can re-sign Juan Soto. Heyman said that if Soto doesn't come back to the Bronx, the Yankees ""will be more focused"" on these aces. But if Soto is back in pinstripes, Heyman thinks the Yankees won't spend the money necessary to get one of the top pitchers. Giants: Heyman said he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if Snell returns to San Francisco after the left-hander enjoyed his time there during the 2024 season. Mets: Another club that's focused on Soto, the Mets will also be looking to upgrade a rotation that could lose Sean Manaea, José Quintana and Luis Severino in free agency. Although outfielder/first baseman Cody Bellinger exercised his player option for 2025, it’s not a guarantee that he’ll be with the Cubs on Opening Day. According to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required), rival executives say that the Cubs want to trade the 29-year-old. More > Juan Soto's decision on where to sign this offseason is the most anticipated in baseball, and according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, ""the feeling around the industry"" is that the decision could be made before the annual Winter Meetings get underway in Dallas on Dec. 9. Soto reportedly has already met with the Blue Jays, Red Sox, Mets and incumbent Yankees. Yanks owner Hal Steinbrenner confirmed Wednesday that the club had a ""good meeting"" with Soto. Soto has a couple more meetings reportedly on tap. He is scheduled to meet with the Dodgers next. And according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman, the Phillies plan to meet with Soto at some point, though nothing has been scheduled yet. Per Heyman, it's believed that no offers have been made to Soto yet. You can follow the latest rumblings on Soto here. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said Wednesday that Sasaki is expected to be part of the 2025 international amateur signing class, which means the Japanese right-hander likely won't sign with a club before Jan. 15. ""It looks like ... the signing will happen in the new pool period,"" Manfred said via The Athletic's Evan Drelich. More > While this year’s free-agent class has its share of attractive options with significant closing experience, including Tanner Scott, Kenley Jansen, Blake Treinen, Clay Holmes, Carlos Estévez, Kirby Yates and David Robertson, MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi expects the closer trade market to be active as well. Morosi has heard that the Brewers’ Devin Williams, the Cardinals’ Ryan Helsley and the Nationals’ Kyle Finnegan are available. Morosi even went as far as predicting that at least two of those closers will be traded before the end of the calendar year. Williams, Helsley and Finnegan all have one year of team control remaining and could be more cost effective than signing a closer in free agency. The latter two are perhaps more likely to be dealt, given the Cardinals and Nationals are both building for the future, but a Williams trade can’t be ruled out. Teams with serious postseason aspirations typically aren’t looking to trade away top stars from their Major League roster, but the Brewers have shown a willingness to be proactive in the past with players nearing free agency, trading Josh Hader in 2022 and Corbin Burnes last offseason. Williams could be next, though figuring out when to do it is a tough call for Milwaukee. A rival executive who spoke with MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand at the GM Meetings suggested that the Brewers would be better off waiting until the summer to put Williams on the trade block to maximize the return. However, it's possible they will look to deal Williams this offseason to avoid a repeat of the Willy Adames situation. Milwaukee didn’t trade Adames at the Deadline this past summer because it was leading the NL Central, and now the shortstop can depart as a free agent, leaving the club with nothing but a Draft pick in return. Thirteen players were tendered a qualifying offer (a one-year, $21.05 million deal for 2025) this offseason, but Reds right-hander Nick Martinez was the only one who accepted prior to Tuesday's 4 p.m. ET deadline. The following 12 players rejected the qualifying offer and will remain free agents: Since the system was implemented in 2012, only 14 players to receive a QO have accepted it. You can read more about year's QO decisions here. Roki Sasaki isn't the only marquee Japanese pitcher who is expected to make the jump to the Majors this offseason. The 35-year-old Tomoyuki Sugano doesn't possess Sasaki's top-notch velocity, but as a two-time winner of the Sawamura Award -- the Japanese equivalent to the Cy Young Award -- Sugano should have his fair share of suitors. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi has identified one team to watch for Sugano: the Angels. More > The Orioles could be one of the big players on the free-agent market for starting pitchers in their first offseason under their new ownership group. General manager Mike Elias said Friday that the Orioles have ""engaged"" in conversations with high-end starting pitchers in free agency. ""We are looking at the whole menu, the whole spectrum and I credit the ownership change toward putting us in a position to do that,"" Elias said. The highest of the high-end starters on the open market is Corbin Burnes, and the Orioles would welcome his return to Baltimore, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan (subscription required). The Orioles also have been linked to left-handed ace Max Fried. Additionally, Baltimore is among a host of clubs interested in acquiring White Sox southpaw Garrett Crochet via trade. However, given all of the young talent they have traded in the past year, The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required) hears that the O's are more focused on the free-agent market right now. Yankees broadcaster Michael Kay said on his radio program on Monday that according to a source, Mets owner Steve Cohen is willing to beat any other club's offer to Juan Soto by $50 million. More > MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reports in an article for the New York Post that the Yankees met with superstar slugger Juan Soto in Southern California on Monday as they look to retain him after he helped lead them to the World Series. More > According to Ken Rosenthal and C. Trent Rosecrans of The Athletic (subscription required), the Royals and Reds are discussing a trade that would involve right-handed starter Brady Singer going to Cincinnati in return for infielder Jonathan India. However, sources told The Athletic that a trade involving Singer and India was not close on Saturday and is just one of several possibilities both teams are considering. Singer is reportedly drawing interest from other clubs while India is just one of the hitters the Royals are targeting. Singer and India were college teammates at the University of Florida and 2018 first-round MLB Draft picks by their current clubs. Singer is coming off a year in which he recorded a 3.71 ERA and 170 strikeouts over a career-high 179 2/3 innings. India, the 2021 National League Rookie of the Year, has been hampered by injuries during his career, but he had 15 homers and a .750 OPS in 151 games this past season. Both players are under club control through the 2026 season. The Red Sox have reportedly made their pitch -- or at least an initial one -- to Juan Soto. They are also trying to convince the top starting pitchers on the market to come to Fenway, too. ESPN's Jeff Passan said during Friday's edition of the Baseball Bar-B-Cast podcast that the Red Sox are talking to Blake Snell and Max Fried. More > Willy Adames is drawing “broad” interest across the Majors, according to MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi. While Adames’ market includes teams that have an opening at shortstop, there are also a number of clubs eyeing him as a third baseman. More > With Max Fried and Charlie Morton both free agents, adding rotation help is a priority for the Braves this offseason. Nathan Eovaldi ranks near the top of Atlanta’s wish list (per a source), but he isn’t the only free-agent starter the team is said to be considering, as MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi hears the Braves also have interest in Walker Buehler. Returning from his second Tommy John surgery, Buehler struggled to the tune of a 5.38 ERA over 16 starts this past season. However, he finished the year on a high note, tossing 10 straight scoreless innings in the postseason and closing out the Dodgers’ title-clinching win over the Yankees in Game 5 of the World Series. Buehler, 30, was one of baseball’s top starters from 2018-21, recording a 2.82 ERA (146 ERA+) with 620 strikeouts and 137 walks in 564 innings. Atlanta could be an attractive landing spot for Buehler in more ways than one. The right-hander has ties to two nearby states, as he was born in Kentucky and attended Vanderbilt in Tennessee. Buehler also just watched the Braves have success with another reclamation project, Chris Sale. Atlanta acquired Sale from the Red Sox last offseason after several injury-plagued seasons. The lefty stayed healthy in 2024 and is the overwhelming favorite to win the National League Cy Young Award. In addition to their interest in Eovaldi and Buehler, the Braves have been linked to White Sox lefty Garrett Crochet on the trade market, though it's unclear if they have enough prospect capital to swing a trade. Fried is still a possibility, too, but paying top dollar for free agents is not part of president of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos’ typical M.O. MLB Trade Rumors predicts Fried will sign a six-year, $156 million contract, compared to one year, $15 million for Buehler and two years, $44 million for Eovaldi. The Dodgers are viewed as one of the top contenders to sign Japanese right-hander Roki Sasaki once he is posted by his Nippon Professional Baseball team, the Chiba Lotte Marines. However, The Athletic's Jim Bowden (subscription required) doesn't see it that way. Based on his conversations with league sources, Bowden thinks it's ""unlikely"" Sasaki will sign with the Dodgers. And Bowden mentioned a few reasons why. More > Although the Yankees are going to make a strong effort to bring back Juan Soto, there’s a real chance the superstar outfielder signs elsewhere, which means New York needs to have a backup plan in place. That backup plan appears to have no limits. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Thursday in the New York Post that the Yankees are ""in on everyone."" One day earlier, during his live chat for Bleacher Report, Heyman was a little more specific on which non-Soto players the Yanks might target. More > The Phillies sign Alex Bregman. That is the prediction of one rival evaluator to ESPN's Buster Olney. The Phillies don't have an opening at third base right now, but they could create one by dealing Alec Bohm, who is on the trade block, per ESPN's Jeff Passan (subscription required). Bohm and Bregman had similar offensive production this year (the former had a 117 OPS+ while the latter had a 118) and both were plus defenders according to outs above average. However, Bregman, a 2024 Gold Glover, has a much longer track record of stellar defense at the hot corner. His has 28 OAA for his career at the position while Bohm has minus-8. Bregman would also bring a large dose of World Series experience to a club that has been thwarted in the postseason in recent years and hasn't won it all since 2008. The Astros have made it clear that re-signing Bregman is their biggest priority of the offseason, but he isn't expected to make his decision any time soon. MLB.com's Mark Feinsand said during a Reddit AMA on Tuesday that he thinks Bregman's chances of remaining with Houston are 50/50. Although the White Sox didn't move Garrett Crochet prior to the Trade Deadline, there appears to be little doubt about their intentions for the left-hander this offseason. ""They're going to trade him this winter,"" a rival evaluator told ESPN's Buster Olney at the GM Meetings last week. ""It's not a matter of if; it's a question of when."" Olney shed some light on Crochet's potential market in an article for ESPN+ (subscription required) on Wednesday, noting that general manager Chris Getz is looking for ""a package of prospects constructed around at least one high-ceiling youngster to anchor the deal,"" with a preference for that main piece to be a position player. Based on conversations with industry sources, Olney names the Phillies, Padres, Yankees, Dodgers, Braves, Orioles, Red Sox and Mets as teams that could pursue a Crochet trade. You can follow the latest rumblings on Crochet here. ESPN's Jeff Passan breaks down the markets for the key free agents and trade targets in his 2024-25 offseason preview (subscription required). Here's what he's reporting on potential landing spots for some of the top hitters and pitchers available: FA hitters FA pitchers Trade market The players Passan cites as potentially being available on the trade market this winter include: Pitchers -- White Sox ace Garrett Crochet, Brewers closer Devin Williams, Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley, Cardinals right-hander Sonny Gray, Mariners right-hander Luis Castillo, D-backs left-hander Jordan Montgomery, Rockies reliever Justin Lawrence Position players -- Cubs second baseman Nico Hoerner and outfielder Cody Bellinger, Phillies third baseman Alec Bohm, Cardinals third baseman Nolan Arenado, Guardians first baseman Josh Naylor, Rays second baseman Brandon Lowe and first baseman Yandy Díaz, Giants first baseman LaMonte Wade Jr., Rockies second baseman Brendan Rodgers According to a report from USA Today’s Bob Nightengale, Christian Walker is a popular name on the free-agent market, with at least six teams planning to “aggressively pursue” the first baseman. Walker received a qualifying offer from the D-backs, but he will likely decline it. Nightengale names the Yankees, Mets and Nationals as teams that are expected to join Arizona in pursuit of Walker, who should come with a lower price tag than that of fellow free-agent first baseman Pete Alonso, given the age disparity between the two players. (Walker is four years older.) The Yankees and Mets are also two of the top contenders for Juan Soto, the No. 1 free agent on the market, but both clubs need to address first base as well. With his expected price tag, signing Walker likely wouldn't impact either team's pursuit of Soto, who is headed for one of the largest contracts in MLB history. Walker doesn’t have quite the same power as Alonso, but he’s no slouch with the bat, having recorded 95 homers and an .813 OPS over the past three seasons. In that same time, Alonso has produced 120 homers and an .826 OPS. Walker, meanwhile, is a far better defender, winning three straight Gold Gloves and leading his position with +38 Outs Above Average since the beginning of 2022. Alonso has produced -17 OAA in that span. In addition to the teams Nightengale mentioned, the Astros, Twins, Mariners, Cardinals and Padres could also be involved in the first-base market to some extent.",2024-11-21,0,0.87,0.13
MLB News,Premier12 super-round results,https://www.mlb.com/news/premier12-super-round-scores-and-results,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 13:22:00 GMT",,"Michael Clair TOKYO -- Four teams are left to battle for the title of Premier12 champions -- the international tournament that pits the top 12 ranked baseball nations against each other and has helped spur the career of many future Major Leaguers. The top two teams from each group -- Venezuela and the United States from Group A and Japan and Chinese Taipei from Group B -- advanced to the super round, where they will now play a three-day round robin to determine which two teams will face off in the championship game on Sunday. There will be two games held each day at the Tokyo Dome (start times are 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. ET) and the action is available to be streamed with a subscription to DAZN in the United States and Canada. As we work toward the championship game, we’ll keep you updated with the outcomes of each super-round game in this story. Super-round Game 1: Venezuela 2, Chinese Taipei 0 Venezuela powered its way through the group stage, going 4-1 to take first place thanks to an experienced lineup with plenty of pop. On Thursday afternoon at the Tokyo Dome, that trend continued: Carlos Eduardo Pérez (one of two catchers named Carlos Pérez on the roster) -- who saw Major League action in parts of five seasons, most recently with the A’s in 2023 -- hit a two-run home run in the fourth inning to give Venezuela a lead that it would never relinquish. 🇻🇪💪 Arepa Power, Carlos Perez with the Home Run! #Premier12 || @Premier12 pic.twitter.com/75nvEJtxLU After Nivaldo Rodriguez -- who went 10-4 with a 2.16 ERA in the CPBL this past season, making him very familiar with the Chinese Taipei lineup -- pitched four shutout innings, Venezuela manager Omar López then utilized his bullpen to perfection. Seven relievers followed -- five of them recording just one out (there is no batter minimum in the Premier12 tournament) -- to finish off the shutout. ""The reason why we're getting stronger is because we have the Venezuelan name on our chest,"" López said after the game. ""And when you have the Venezuelan name, when you wear the jersey, there is nothing better than that. Nothing. Nothing. It's pride, it's honor and it's privilege."" Game 2: Japan 9, United States 1 For four innings, it was one of the most unlikely pitching duels you'll ever see: On one side was 44-year-old USA starter Rich Hill, a veteran of nearly 400 big league games who befuddled and bewitched Samurai Japan batters with an endless bevy of slow curves that at times barely crested 70 mph. On the other was Hitaro Takahashi, the young Japanese ace who is half Hill’s age, armed with a 98 mph fastball and diving low-90s split-finger. Despite the difference in styles, the two matched each other: Hill gave up one hit and struck out five. Takahashi, with dreams of the big leagues and MLB scouts in attendance, gave up two hits and struck out eight. Once pulled though, the runs came: A’s No. 7 prospect Colby Thomas, who hit 31 home runs in the Minors last year, blasted a solo shot to right-field in the top of the fifth, flapping the ‘USA’ on his chest as he rounded the bases. 🇺🇸😤 Colby Thomas destroyed that baseball! #Premier12 || @Premier12 | @USABaseball pic.twitter.com/bHt0Ht9IPT That was no match for Japan’s second baseman Kaito Kozono. Despite hitting just two home runs in 588 PA for the Hiroshima Carp this season, he went supernova on Thursday: Kozono hit a two-run triple in the fifth, a three-run homer in the 7th, and capped it off with a two-run shot in the 8th. That was enough for the seemingly unbeatable Japan, who extended their international winning streak to a remarkable 25 games.

Between 1996-2016 and 2018-19, the Barons played one game -- the Rickwood Classic -- at Rickwood Field each Minor League season. As a ballpark that was the homefield of a Negro Leagues franchise that competed for several seasons on circuits now recognized as Major League level, Rickwood Field is a living monument to the thousands of Birmingham fans who filled its stands and the hundreds of Black baseball pioneers who competed between its lines -- including Baseball Hall of Famers Satchel Paige, Willie Wells and Mule Suttles.

MLB News,Steinbrenner addresses Yanks' hot topics at Owners Meetings,https://www.mlb.com/news/hal-steinbrenner-discusses-juan-soto-gerrit-cole-owners-meetings-2024,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:38:41 GMT",,"Bryan Hoch This story was excerpted from Bryan Hoch's Yankees Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. The image at the far end of Yankee Stadium’s first-base dugout was instantly poignant. Juan Soto clutched a bat, ballcap and glove in his left hand, placing his right hand across his heart. He looked skyward, expressing thanks for what the star outfielder would moments later say had been a “really special” year wearing pinstripes. Then Soto was gone, out the door into the great unknown of free agency. The organization has every intention of ensuring that moment after Game 5 of the World Series will depict the beginning of a long story, not the conclusion of one, which is why the Yankees’ most essential decision-makers traveled to express their interest to Soto and agent Scott Boras earlier this week in Newport Beach, Calif. Speaking with reporters on Wednesday at the Owners Meetings in Manhattan, N.Y., Yankees managing general partner Hal Steinbrenner described a “good meeting” that included “a very honest, back-and-forth dialogue” with Soto and Boras. Steinbrenner said he understands why the fans want Soto back so desperately; the team does, too. Will their mission be successful? Steinbrenner declined to speculate, replying: “No idea. We’ll be in the mix. I’ll leave it at that.” Steinbrenner touched upon numerous other topics of interest during the group interview session, which took place in the lobby of Major League Baseball’s offices on Sixth Avenue. Steinbrenner remarked, ""I don’t think you can ever have enough pitching,” noting that the team would “take a deep dive” into the starting rotation and the bullpen. First base, second base and left field are also areas of need. Since the World Series, the organization has been busy evaluating every free agent in the marketplace. “We do have other things to add, whether that’s via a free agent or whether that’s via a trade,” he said. “We’ve got some things we need to improve. Every club does.” While Steinbrenner has said that he does not believe a repeat of last year’s payroll is sustainable, he said that he does not have a set payroll for 2025, adding that he told general manager Brian Cashman: “Just have your people [bring] every possibility out there. I want it coming my way, and we’ll just keep talking.” World Series reaction Steinbrenner said that “it still stings” to think about the Yankees’ loss to the Dodgers in the World Series, their first appearance in the Fall Classic since 2009. “It’s interesting, when you’re that close and you don’t get there, it stays with you for a while,” Steinbrenner said. “All of us feel the same way. We’re just going to have to get right back at it in March and get there again, and get the job done next year.” Steinbrenner said he disagreed with the criticism that followed the loss, suggesting that the Yankees lack fundamentals on the basepaths and defensively. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. “Listen, we did not play a clean World Series. I think we all know that,” he said. “But those fundamentals got us to the World Series. Our play, for the most part, we saw during the course of the year. That’s why we won a pennant for the first time in 15 years. No doubt, in the World Series, they just played better than us. Period.” Rays at Steinbrenner FieldWith Tropicana Field unplayable due to hurricane damage, the Rays will become the Yankees’ tenants for the 2025 season at George M. Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Fla., with the Yankees receiving $15 million in the transaction. We are thrilled to play in Tampa Bay. 🩵 Steinbrenner said leasing the facility was “the right thing to do for their fan base, many of whom are my neighbors and friends that live in Tampa.” Steinbrenner said that the challenges will come in logistics, such as ensuring that vendors have enough food and beverages for long homestands and adding storage. The visitors’ clubhouse will be modified at the responsibility of the Rays, and lights will be added to an adjacent field, where the now-displaced Single-A Tampa Tarpons will play for a season. Extensions on deck for Boone, Cole? Steinbrenner said that “step one” of the offseason was exercising manager Aaron Boone’s contractual option for 2025, and that he plans to speak with Cashman soon concerning a possible extension for Boone. Said Steinbrenner: “There’s no huge rush to it, but I will have those discussions as to what we should do next.” As for Gerrit Cole, Steinbrenner said that there were “a number of factors involved” after Cole exercised his opt-out on Nov. 3, acknowledging: “I wasn’t in a position where I was comfortable going to a fifth year [to extend Cole’s contract through 2029]. “… But let me just say, that doesn’t reflect in any way, shape or form what we think of Gerrit. We want Gerrit to be a Yankee for life. I believe he wants to be a Yankee for life. And adding one more year or not adding one more year should have no meaning when it comes to that.”",2024-11-21,1,0.47,0.53
MLB News,Every franchise's BBWAA award winners,https://www.mlb.com/news/major-award-winners-for-every-mlb-team,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 23:56:00 GMT",,"MLB.com The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) honors MLB's best with its four annual awards: MVP, Cy Young, Rookie of the Year and Manager of the Year. On Wednesday, Chris Sale brought home his first Cy Young Award and the Braves' eighth. That's the second-most of any franchise behind the Dodgers' 12 Cy Young Awards. On Thursday, Aaron Judge captured the 22nd MVP Award in Yankees franchise history -- the most for any team. Of course, some teams have had bigger hauls than others over the years. What follows is a breakdown of each of the 30 franchise’s winners in those four categories. It’s worth noting that these awards cover different time frames.

MLB News,Consecutive MVP winners in MLB history,https://www.mlb.com/news/players-to-win-back-to-back-mvp-awards,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 23:51:00 GMT",,"Andrew Simon Winning one MVP Award is hard. Defending that title the next year is even more difficult. However, Shohei Ohtani makes everything look easy. On Thursday, the Dodgers superstar not only won his second consecutive MVP Award, he became the first player to do so after changing leagues. There have been 34 individuals who have won more than one MVP Award in their careers (including versions of the award that predate the modern Baseball Writers' Association of America MVP Award). But since the BBWAA began handing out the coveted hardware in 1931, just 14 have gone back to back -- with one doing so multiple times. Here is a look at the members of this exclusive club, beginning with Ohtani. Shohei Ohtani (2023 American League, 2024 National League)In ‘23, Ohtani ended his six-year stint with the Angels by earning his second AL MVP honor. He hit 44 homers and pitched to a 3.14 ERA over 132 innings that year. The following season, Ohtani joined the Dodgers and even though he was unable to pitch as he recovered from elbow surgery, he was sublime as a full-time hitter. Ohtani celebrated his third MVP win after batting .310 and establishing the 50-homer, 50-stolen base club. He ended the year with 54 dingers and 59 steals. Miguel Cabrera: 2012-13 (AL)While some disputed Miggy’s MVP claim in both cases, due to the all-around brilliance of an emerging superstar in the AL, Cabrera easily beat out Mike Trout for the honor in both 2012 and ‘13. His argument was pretty straightforward. In ‘12, Cabrera became the first player to win a Triple Crown since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967. He won another batting title the next year, while matching his home run total (44) and finishing with 137 RBIs, just short of his total (139) from '12. Albert Pujols: 2008-09 (NL)Pujols was already a veteran of the MVP race at this point, having finished in the top four in six of his first seven seasons, including a win in 2005. But ‘08 and ‘09 were perhaps the two best years Pujols had during an incredible run in St. Louis, as he hit a combined .342/.452/.656 with 84 home runs and 251 RBIs. He even stole 16 bases in '09. Barry Bonds: 2001-04 (NL)No other player in MLB history has won four MVP Awards in an entire career. Bonds won four in a row with the Giants -- when he already had three in the bank (see below). These were the four years when Bonds broke the single-season home run record (2001) and just about broke baseball entirely. He had a .559 OBP, an .809 slugging percentage and 755 walks over that span. Frank Thomas: 1993-94 (AL)The Hall of Fame slugger was in just his third full season, at age 25, when he was a unanimous selection in 1993 after racking up 41 home runs and 128 RBIs for the White Sox. The Big Hurt was even better the next year, but unfortunately, the strike halted a campaign in which he was batting an absurd .353/.487/.729 with 38 homers in 113 games. Bonds: 1992-93 (NL)Bonds, who won his first MVP Award in 1990, took his second in his final season with the Pirates, ‘92, when he led the Majors in OBP (.456) and slugging (.624). He was even better the next year after signing as a free agent with the Giants, slashing .336/.458/.677 with 46 homers and 123 RBIs. Dale Murphy: 1982-83 (NL)Coming off a disappointing 1981 campaign, Murphy enjoyed a big season, smacking 36 homers and driving in an NL-high 109 runs as he led the Braves to their first postseason appearance since ‘69 (and second since moving to Atlanta in ‘66). The Braves didn’t quite make it back the next year, but Murphy led the NL in RBIs again (121), along with slugging (.540) and OPS (.933).

Mike Schmidt: 1980-81 (NL)Despite hitting at least 36 home runs and driving in at least 100 runs five times apiece in his first seven full seasons, Schmidt had not been named MVP. That all changed as the slick-fielding, hard-hitting third baseman got his due in two straight years. Schmidt is the most recent player to win a regular season and World Series MVP in the same season, doing so in 1980. Joe Morgan: 1975-76 (NL)This was at the height of the Big Red Machine in Cincinnati, as the Reds won a combined 210 games and two World Series in these two seasons. Morgan was the best player on both of those star-studded rosters, combining Gold Glove defense at second base with great speed (127 steals), on-base skill (.456 OBP) and power (44 homers). Roger Maris: 1960-61 (AL)In December 1959, the Yankees acquired Maris from the Kansas City A’s. It was good timing. Maris’ first year in pinstripes featured 39 homers and 112 RBIs. His second featured the breaking of Babe Ruth’s single-season home run record, as Maris swatted 61. The Yankees won AL pennants both years, and the ‘61 World Series. Ernie Banks: 1958-59 (NL)As was the case for much of Banks’ career, the Cubs were not a very good team in these two seasons, with back-to-back sub-.500, fifth-place finishes. Banks transcended his situation by producing a combined 92 home runs and 272 RBIs while playing shortstop. Mickey Mantle: 1956-57 (AL)A young Mantle, in his prime, was basically unstoppable. He launched 52 home runs and drove in 130 in 1956, and put together a combined line of .358/.487/.686 in these two seasons. He was worth 11.3 WAR both years, making him one of four position players in history to reach the 11-WAR mark twice in a career. Yogi Berra: 1954-55 (AL)Before Mantle and Maris, it was Berra winning consecutive MVPs for the Yankees. The catcher already had one to his credit (1951), part of a run in which he finished in the top four in the voting for seven straight seasons. Berra topped 20 homers and 100 RBIs in both of these years, while working behind the plate. Hal Newhouser: 1944-45 (AL)The only pitcher on this list, Newhouser led the Majors in wins and strikeouts in both seasons, going a combined 54-18 with a 2.01 ERA. The left-hander led the Tigers to the 1945 World series, had a rough time in his first start, then came back for complete-game victories in Games 5 and 7, as the Tigers beat the Cubs. Jimmie Foxx: 1932-33 (AL)In 1932, Ruth’s career was starting to wind down. Meanwhile, Foxx was becoming the game’s top slugger. The Philadelphia A’s star led the Majors in homers, RBIs, slugging percentage and OPS in both ‘32 and ‘33, going deep a total of 106 times and batting .360/.460/.726.",2024-11-21,1,0.3,0.7
MLB News,Players with most MVP Awards in MLB history,https://www.mlb.com/news/most-mlb-mvp-awards-c294414636,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 23:55:00 GMT",Just 30 players have won the annual honor more than once,"Manny Randhawa In baseball history, there are precious few players who have ever won more than one Most Valuable Player Award. Here's a look at each of the 30 individuals to do so since the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) began voting for MVP in 1931, including a select group of 12 to do it three times or more. Barry Bonds, 7 (1990, '92, '93, 2001-04)Bonds hit .301/.406/.565 with 33 home runs and 52 steals to earn his first NL MVP Award in 1990 with the Pirates, and .311/.456/.624 with 34 homers and 39 steals in '92 with Pittsburgh. After signing as a free agent with the Giants, he slashed .336/.458/.677 with 43 home runs and 29 steals in '93 to win his third MVP honor. He won the the award four more times with some of the greatest offensive seasons in baseball history from 2001-04, including a record 73-homer season in '01. He finished his 22-year career with records of 762 homers, 2,558 walks and 688 intentional walks. Shohei Ohtani: 3 (2021, '23, '24)Arguably the most talented player the game has ever known, Ohtani won two MVP Awards through his first six seasons in the Majors because of his incredible ability to operate simultaneously as an elite power hitter and a starting rotation ace. Each of his two AL MVP seasons with the Angels included at least 40 homers and a .950 OPS at the plate coupled with a 140 or better ERA+ across more than 130 innings pitched. That made him the only player in MLB history to win multiple MVPs by a unanimous vote -- but he didn’t stop there. After signing with the Dodgers as a free agent, Ohtani (rehabbing from Tommy John surgery throughout 2024) immediately showed that he was still a worthy MVP (and once again, a unanimous MVP) even while playing exclusively as a DH. In doing so, he joined Frank Robinson as the only two players to take MVP honors in both the AL and NL Mike Trout, 3 (2014, ‘16, ’19)Trout’s third MVP also marked his seventh top-two finish in AL MVP voting out of eight full seasons as a Major Leaguer. He is the only player to garner seven top-two showings in a span of eight seasons, and he now stands tied with legends Stan Musial and Albert Pujols for the second-most top-two MVP finishes behind Barry Bonds’ nine. Trout’s 2019 season was on pace to possibly be his best before a foot injury cut his season short in September. But he still finished with 8.6 fWAR after hitting .291/.438/.645 and bashing a career-high 45 homers across 134 games. Albert Pujols, 3 (2005, '08, '09)Pujols turned in prodigious seasons at the plate from his very first year in the Majors, but he won his first MVP Award in 2005, hitting .330/.430/.609 with 41 homers for the Cardinals. Pujols would win again in 2008 and '09, a pair of seasons over which he hit .342/.452/.656 with 84 home runs. Alex Rodriguez, 3 (2003, '05, '07)It was in 2003 that Rodriguez broke through and claimed his first MVP Award, though he actually had better numbers in the two seasons prior for the Rangers, posting OPS marks of 1.021 and 1.015, respectively, in 2001 and '02. In '03 he slashed .298/.396/.600 with 47 homers and 17 steals for Texas. Rodriguez was named MVP again in '05 with the Yankees (1.031 OPS, 48 homers, 21 steals) and '07 (1.067 OPS, 54 home runs, 156 RBIs, 24 steals).

Mike Schmidt, 3 (1980, '81, '86)Schmidt won the first of three career MVP Awards in 1980, a year in which he also led the Phillies to a World Series championship. During the regular season that year, Schmidt hit .286/.380/.624 with 48 homers and won his fifth consecutive Gold Glove Award. He was named NL MVP again the next year, slashing .316/.435/.644 with 31 homers in a strike-shortened season (he played in 102 games), while winning another Gold Glove Award. Schmidt's final MVP season was 1986, when at age 36, he hit .290/.390/.547 with 37 homers and won his 10th Gold Glove Award. Mickey Mantle, 3 (1956, '57, '62)Mantle finished in the top five for AL MVP voting nine times in his career, winning in 1956, '57 and '62. In '56 and '57, he was at his peak at age 24 and 25, hitting .358/.487/.686 with 86 home runs in that span. In '62, Mantle was limited by injury to 123 games, yet was still named MVP after slashing .321/.486/.605 with 30 homers and his only career Gold Glove Award. Yogi Berra, 3 (1951, '54, '55)Berra won his first AL MVP Award in 1951, when he hit .294/.350/.492 with 27 home runs to help the Yankees earn a meeting with the Giants in the World Series, where they defeated their cross-town rivals in six games. The catcher won again in '54 and '55, during the best offensive stretch of his career; in '54, he posted an .855 OPS with 22 home runs, and the following season, he posted an .819 OPS with 27 homers. Roy Campanella, 3 (1951, '53, '55)Though his career was cut short after he was involved in a 1958 car accident that left him paralyzed, Campanella was one of the best players in the game during his 10-year career with the Brooklyn Dodgers. He won his first NL MVP Award in 1951, hitting .325/.393/.590 with 33 homers. Two seasons later, he won his second MVP honor, posting a 1.006 OPS with 41 home runs and a league-leading 142 RBIs. And in '55, he helped lead the Dodgers to their first World Series title in a victory over the Yankees, slashing .318/.395/.583 with 32 home runs during the regular season. Stan Musial, 3 (1943, '46, '48)Musial won the NL MVP Award three times over a 22-year career spent entirely with the Cardinals. In his first MVP season -- 1943 -- a 22-year-old Musial hit .357/.425/.562 with 48 doubles, 20 triples and 13 home runs to help St. Louis reach the World Series. After missing a season to serve in World War II, Musial returned to hit .365/.434/.587 with 50 doubles and 20 homers to claim his second MVP Award. And in '48, Musial won his third, slashing .376/.450/.702 with 46 doubles, 18 triples and 39 homers. Joe DiMaggio, 3 (1939, '41, '47)The Yankee Clipper hit .381/.448/.671 with 30 homers in '39 to win his first MVP Award. In '41, a season forever remembered for his record 56-game hitting streak, DiMaggio hit .357/.440/.643 with 30 homers to win his second MVP honor. In his third MVP season, in '47, he slashed .315/.391/.522 with 20 homers in 97 games before earning his sixth World Series ring in a victory over the Dodgers. Jimmie Foxx, 3 (1932, '33, '38)Foxx hit 534 home runs over a 20-year career, 106 of which came in just two seasons for the Philadelphia Athletics from 1932-33. Over that span, he hit .360/.460/.726 and won back-to-back AL MVP Awards. He won again in '38, a year in which he posted a 1.166 OPS with 50 home runs and 175 RBIs. Taken together, these three seasons are some of the greatest offensive campaigns in MLB history. Aaron Judge: 2 (2022, ‘24)Even another great Ohtani season in 2022 couldn’t overcome Judge setting the AL’s single-season home run record with 62, to go along with a ridiculous 210 OPS+ and 131 RBIs. At the time, it seemed like that would obviously be Judge’s peak, but amazingly, it wasn’t. While Judge didn’t quite match that home run total two years later, hitting 58, he had more RBIs (144) and was a better hitter on a rate basis. In modern AL/NL history, no right-handed batter has ever topped Judge’s 223 OPS+ in 2024. With Ohtani on the NL side this time, Judge’s second MVP came unanimously. Bryce Harper: 2 (2015, '21)Harper added a second NL MVP Award to his resume with a monster 2021 campaign. Following a 2012 NL Rookie of the Year Award and his first MVP honor in 2015, the slugging right fielder ""quietly"" continued to put up excellent, if not headline-grabbing, numbers, posting an .899 OPS (133 OPS+) with 135 home runs from 2016-20. But in '21, he couldn't be denied the highest award for an NL position player after hitting .309/.429/.615 with 35 homers, leading baseball in doubles (42), slugging (.615), OPS (1.044) and OPS+ (179). Miguel Cabrera: 2 (2012-13)Cabrera won back-to-back AL MVP Awards in 2012 and '13. His first came after the slugger turned in the first Triple Crown season since Boston's Carl Yastrzemski's in 1967. Cabrera hit .330 with 44 home runs and 139 RBIs while helping the Tigers win the AL pennant. In '13, he had an even better year, hitting .348/.442/.636 with 44 homers. Juan Gonzalez: 2 (1996, '98)Gonzalez was one of the premier sluggers of the 1990s, hitting 339 home runs during the decade and winning two AL MVP Awards. The first came in 1996, when he slashed .314/.368/.643 with 47 homers in 134 games for the Rangers. He won his second MVP Award in '98, hitting .318/.366/.630 with 50 homers and 157 RBIs for Texas. Frank Thomas: 2 (1993-94)The Big Hurt won AL MVP Awards in 1993 and '94, at the peak of his prodigious slugging powers. He helped the White Sox win their first division title in a decade by slashing .317/.426/.607 with 41 homers. He followed that up with an even better campaign in the strike-shortened '94 season, hitting .353/.487/.729 with 38 homers in 113 games. Cal Ripken Jr.: 2 (1983, '91)Ripken won a pair of AL MVP Awards nearly a decade apart. His first came as a 22-year-old in 1983. That year, he led the league in runs scored (121), hits (211) and doubles (47) while slashing .318/.371/.517 with 27 homers, also leading the Orioles to a World Series victory over the Phillies. Ripken's second MVP Award came in '91, when he hit .323/.374/.566 with 34 homers. Robin Yount: 2 (1982, '89)Yount led the AL in hits (210), doubles (46) and slugging percentage (.578) en route to winning his first MVP Award in 1982. The Brewers star hit .318/.384/.511 with 21 homers and 19 steals in '89 to win his second MVP honor. Dale Murphy: 2 (1982-83)In 1982, the Braves slugger slashed .281/.378/.507 with 36 home runs and 23 steals to win his first MVP Award. The encore was even better, when in '83, he hit .302/.393/.540 with 36 homers and 30 steals to win a second straight MVP honor. From 1982-87, he won those two MVP Awards, five Gold Glove Awards, and was an All-Star every season. Joe Morgan: 2 (1975-76)Morgan was the NL MVP in 1975 and '76, the years the Big Red Machine won back-to-back World Series championships. In '75, he hit .327/.466/.508 with 17 homers and 67 steals, leading the league in walks, on-base percentage and OPS. He followed that up with a season in which he increased the power numbers, posting a .320/.444/.576 slash line, 27 homers and 60 steals. He led the league in both on-base and slugging percentage.   Johnny Bench: 2 (1970, '72)Bench, considered by many to be the greatest catcher of all-time, won the honor in 1970 and '72. In '70, he slashed .293/.345/.587 and led the league in homers (45) and RBIs (148). Two seasons later, he again led in homers (40) and RBIs (125), hitting .270/.379/.541 for Cincinnati.   Frank Robinson: 2 (1961, '66)Robinson won the first of two MVP Awards at age 25 in 1961 for the Reds. The slugger slashed .323/.404/.611 with 37 doubles and 22 steals. He won the award again in '66, but this time in the AL for the Orioles. In his first season with Baltimore, he won the Triple Crown by hitting .316 with 49 home runs and 122 RBIs. He was also named MVP of that fall's World Series as the Orioles swept the Dodgers.   Roger Maris: 2 (1960-61)Maris will forever be remembered for breaking Babe Ruth's single-season home run record with 61 homers in 1961, but he was already the reigning AL MVP entering that season. In '60, he hit .283/.371/.581 with 39 homers, and won his only career Gold Glove Award. He then set the home run mark in '61, hitting .269/.372/.620 with 141 RBIs to win his second straight MVP Award.   Ernie Banks: 2 (1958-59)""Mr. Cub,"" famous for his ""Let's play two"" saying, was the NL MVP in 1958 and '59. The shortstop led the NL in slugging (.614), home runs (47) and RBIs (129) to win his first MVP honor in '59, and then hit .304/.374/.596 with 45 homers and a league-leading 143 RBIs to win his second consecutive MVP Award the following year. Willie Mays: 2 (1954, '65)Mays, considered one of the greatest all-around players in baseball history, was the NL MVP in 1954, and then again 11 years later. In '54, the 23-year-old center fielder helped lead the Giants to a World Series sweep of the Indians, making his famous over-the-shoulder catch in center field in Game 1. But before all of that, he hit .345/.411/.667 with 41 homers after returning from military service. In '65, he slashed .317/.398/.645 with a career-high 52 homers to win his second MVP honor. Ted Williams: 2 (1946, '49)The ""Splendid Splinter won his first AL MVP Award the season after returning from service in World War II. In 1946, he slashed .342/.497/.667 with 38 home runs and a league-leading 158 walks. His second MVP season was in '49, when he hit .343/.490/.650 and led the league in doubles (39), homers (43), RBIs (159) and walks (162). Hal Newhouser: 2 (1944-45)Newhouser won back-to-back AL MVP Awards with the Tigers in 1944 and '45. Over those two seasons, the left-hander had a 2.01 ERA over 625 2/3 innings, leading the league with 399 strikeouts. Hank Greenberg: 2 (1935, '40)Greenberg hit 36 homers and drove in 168 while slashing .328/.411/.628 to win his first MVP Award in 1935 with the Tigers. In 1940, he had another monster season at the plate to win his second MVP Award, hitting .340/.433/.670 with 41 homers and 150 RBIs for Detroit. Carl Hubbell: 2 (1933, '36)Hubbell, one of three pitchers to ever win multiple MVP Awards, won in 1933 and '36 with the Giants. In '33, he posted a 1.66 ERA over 308 2/3 innings and then tossed 20 scoreless frames in the World Series, which the Giants won over the Senators. Three seasons later, he was named MVP again by posting a 2.31 ERA over 304 innings before a 2.25 ERA in two starts during the World Series, a loss to the Giants. Before the BBWAA took over MVP voting in 1931, the award existed in other forms, and with differing rules, between 1911-14 and 1922-30. If these earlier versions were combined with the modern MVP Award, four other Hall of Famers would join the list of multi-time winners: ^Unofficial, pre-BBWAA voting",2024-11-21,1,0.46,0.54

The Capitals captain and current NHL leading goal scorer suffered the injury during Monday night's win over the Utah Hockey Club. Ovechkin had a leg-to-leg collision with Utah forward Jack McBain and fell to the ice immediately. He tested out the leg with a brief skate minutes later before later exiting the game and he did not return. Alex Ovechkin to the dressing room after this sequence 😩 pic.twitter.com/5KQdnRfFT6 — Brady Trettenero (@BradyTrett) November 19, 2024 The Capitals, who are second in the Eastern Conference with 28 points, will be without Ovechkin for the longest period of his career since he entered the NHL in 2005-06. The 39-year-old has missed only 35 games due to injury and other absences were due to suspensions and being in COVID-19 protocol. Ovechkin's previous longest stretch of missed games was six due to an upper-body injury in November 2009. “Everyone’s bummed out,” said Capitals forward Tom Wilson, a teammate of Ovechkin's since 2013. “We were sitting there saying: ‘This is weird. Like, it’s unbelievable that he’s actually hurt.’ It’s one of those things where like, he’s going to miss games? I’ve been around a long time, and it’s new to me.” Ovechkin has had a red-hot start to the season and had scored five goals in his previous two games before the injury. His 15 goals this season puts him at 868 for his career, 26 behind the NHL record of 894 held by Wayne Gretzky. Many had believed Ovechkin could catch The Great One sometime during the 2025-26 season, but his play early on was changing minds to believe the record could be broken this season.

That’s the question. If he really cared about a World Series ring, Judge, who was named the unanimous 2024 AL MVP on Thursday, would sell his fancy new trophy on eBay and give the proceeds to Yankees general manager Brian Cashman so the club can sign another bullpen arm for 2025. That’s what a real captain would do. Derek Jeter, the perfect example of Yankees leadership, had the perspective and wherewithal to never play well enough to warrant winning such a selfish award. Look, I’m not saying that Judge should play worse during the regular season next year; that’s preposterous. But if he melted the AL MVP trophy down and had it remade into a sculpture of the 2024 Dodgers celebrating their world championship and then put that sculpture on his bedside table so he could wake up every morning properly motivated, it wouldn’t be the most inappropriate thing. It’s tradition for MVP winners to accept their awards at the annual BBWAA New York Chapter dinner in January. And while I’m sure fans would love to see Judge there, he should honestly be spending that time in the gym or the batting cage GRINDING for the 2025 season. A night in a tuxedo with boring writers like me isn’t working toward the ultimate goal of a Yankees parade. As they say, if you aren’t getting better, you’re getting worse. Shohei Ohtani, the unanimous 2024 NL MVP, is a different story, his own overlooked postseason struggles aside. Sure, the Dodger dynamo’s October OPS was only 15 points higher than Judge’s, but Ohtani is a winner who won. With Judge, that’s clearly not the case. And don’t forget: The last time Judge won this award, back in 2022, the Yankees were a train wreck the following season, missing out on the playoffs. Does the Yankees captain really want to tempt fate again? Might be best to let Bobby Witt Jr., who finished second in AL MVP voting, take the award. People speak volumes about Judge’s steadiness and consistency during the marathon of a 162-game season. That’s pretty cool, I guess, but I’d rather have a totally erratic teammate who wakes up hungover on Oct. 1 and clobbers 15 playoff bombs. Not somebody like Judge, who finished this past postseason with a ... .752 OPS, which ... actually isn’t that bad? Huh. How 'bout that? You know what? Maybe it’s best to hold multiple thoughts in our heads at the same time. Yes, Judge underwhelmed by his lofty standards in a 14-game postseason sample, but maybe, just maybe, that doesn’t invalidate what was an all-time magnificent offensive performance in the regular season. Judge’s 2024 was, by OPS+, the best season by a hitter since Barry Bonds put up a 263 OPS+ in 2004. The titanic Yankees outfielder finished the season with a comical stat line: 58 home runs, a .322 batting average, an 1.159 OPS and an adjusted OPS 123% better than league average. Only three players in MLB history have posted an OPS+ higher than Judge’s 223 mark this year: Bonds, Babe Ruth and Ted Williams. Not too shabby. And sure, as my idiotic ramblings above alluded to, Judge’s struggles on the big stage leave an unfortunate haze over our collective memory of his season. It’s a fact, one he knows and one he has owned: When the games mattered most, Judge was not at his best. Whether that’s because he can’t handle the spotlight or because baseball is difficult and random is up to the eye of the beholder. Just remember that the Yankees’ World Series Game 5 capitulation was so total and complete that it’s impossible to pin on any one soul. Maybe I’m being the “Steph Curry arguing against nobody” meme, but whatever. Judge's outstanding 162 cannot simply wipe away his autumnal stumble. Yet at the same time, his substandard October shouldn’t completely overshadow six months of downright dominance. Both are true, both are important, and both tell the story of Aaron Judge’s 2024, a season that we’ll remember for a long, long time. Hopefully, for all the right reasons.",2024-11-21,0,0.7,0.3

Commissioner Rob Manfred told The Athletic's Evan Drellich on Wednesday that the league will test an automated ball-strike challenge system in spring training in 2025, with the hope that the system can be implemented in the regular season in 2026. The system will reportedly give teams two challenges per game, with teams retaining them when they are correct. Not every spring training ballpark will reportedly have the ABS cameras, but all teams will have the opportunity to play with the new system. From The Athletic: “I think we will have a spring training ABS test that will provide a meaningful opportunity for all major-league players to see what the challenge system will look like,” Manfred said. “From my perspective, there’s two sides to that test: It’s what clubs think about it, and also, what do the players think about it? And we’re gonna have to sort through both of those.” MLB has experimented with ABS systems in two formats in the minor leagues going back to 2019. Some games have seen the robo umps used to call every pitch, while others have used the challenge system about to hit spring training. The challenge system was used full-time in Triple-A, and you can see it applied to end a game here: Upon further review... @GoStripers win it!@Braves prospect Hayden Harris records all of his outs via strikeout to earn the save -- with the final one coming on an ABS challenge: pic.twitter.com/dlnBOvUoOs — Minor League Baseball (@MiLB) September 18, 2024 At one point last year, MLB said teams had a 47% success rate with challenges. Robo umps once felt like a radical change for MLB, but they've become something of an inevitability given how MLB has approached them. Because they've been around the minor leagues for years, an enormous chunk of current major leaguers have experience with the system. It has been a very slow transition for the league, but it appears to almost be over.

The school got a verbal commitment from five-star QB Bryce Underwood on Thursday. The Michigan native is the No. 2 player in the country, according to Rivals, and had previously been committed to LSU. If Underwood signs with Michigan in December’s early signing period or the normal signing period in 2025, he’ll be the school’s highest-ranked recruit since Rashan Gary committed to the Wolverines in 2016. Underwood would also be the first Rivals five-star to sign with the Wolverines since DB Will Johnson in 2022. Johnson has become one of the best defensive backs in college football and is a likely first-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. The verbal commitment from Underwood comes on the same day that Colorado landed a verbal commitment from five-star QB Julian Lewis. He's the No. 6 player in the country and had recently de-committed from USC. Underwood plays for Belleville High School, the same school that currently employs disgraced ex-Michigan staffer Connor Stalions. Yes, really. Stalions has been serving as an assistant for the school after his alleged advance scouting scheme was the storyline of the 2023 college football season. It's the second high school job for Stalions this season. He started the season at Detroit Mumford. The connection with Stalions aside and any role the former staffer may or may not have played in Underwood's recruitment, it's hard to overstate the significance of Underwood's flip for Michigan. The Wolverines have missed out on high-profile in-state QBs in recent years and drastically need a solid quarterback to overhaul the offense under first-year head coach Sherrone Moore. The coach was understandably excited about the news on social media. YES SIR ! #GoBlue🔵 The Best players in Michigan go to Michigan ! #ProcessoverPrize25 — Sherrone Moore (@Coach_SMoore) November 21, 2024 Michigan is just 5-5 with two games to go in the regular season thanks largely to porous QB play. Three different players have started at QB for Michigan this season and they’ve combined to complete less than 60% of their passes and throw nine TDs and nine interceptions. Overall, Michigan QBs are averaging just six yards per passing attempt. If Underwood signs in December, he'll have the opportunity to enroll early at Michigan and participate in spring practices. The only player ranked ahead of Underwood in Rivals' rankings is QB Tavien St. Clair. He has been verbally committed to Michigan's archrival Ohio State since June of 2023. The Buckeyes added two top quarterbacks in the class of 2024 in Air Noland and Julian Sayin. After Underwood's commitment, Michigan's 19-person class now provisionally ranks No. 11 in Rivals' rankings.",2024-11-21,1,0.45,0.55

On Thursday, Charania reported that George has a bone bruise and will miss Philadelphia's next two games. He'll be reevaluated on Monday. The knee is the same knee that caused George to miss the first five games of the season due to a bone bruise from a previous hyperextension.

Now it could bring his family millions at auction.,"The past few weeks have been a whirlwind for Zachary Ruderman. He's the 10-year-old Dodgers fan who ended up with one of the most significant baseballs in team history — the one his favorite player, first baseman Freddie Freeman, hit for a walk-off grand slam during the 10th inning in Game 1 of the 2024 World Series against the New York Yankees. Since then, Zachary has seemingly become one of the most famous people living in Venice. “It’s a lot more attention than my son has ever had,"" his father, Nico Ruderman, said. ""He’s spoken to so many media outlets, so many interviews. People recognize him. I mean, literally everywhere we go people stop him and want to take pictures with him. He’s really actually been loving it. It’s been a fun experience for him.” Read more: Kid thought he was going to dentist. Dad took him to World Series and he caught Freddie Freeman's grand slam That experience is entering a new phase. On Wednesday, SCP Auctions announced the ball will be up for bid from Dec. 4-14. Coming just weeks after the Dodgers won their eighth World Series championship — with Freeman hitting four home runs and winning MVP honors, all on a badly sprained ankle — SCP founder and president David Kohler said his company thinks ""the sky's the limit"" for what the auction could bring. ""We think this is gonna bring seven figures,"" Kohler said. ""We think it’s one of the most historic baseballs ever, with the moment of this World Series, the first walk-off grand slam, the whole story of Freddie Freeman, the Dodgers, Game 1, extra innings. Just everything about it. I mean, it’s one of the most historic moments in sports and we feel that people are going to appreciate that."" Last month, Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani's 50th home run ball was sold by Goldin Auctions for a record $4.4 million. Could the Freeman ball be worth even more than that? “It could be. You never know,"" Kohler said. ""We’re gonna find out. Certainly the Ohtani ball was very, very significant and Ohtani is beloved, but this is more of the history of the game of baseball and just the moment — seeing that happen was just incredible.” Zachary, along with his father and mother Anne, were part of that moment. After Freeman blasted his game-winning shot into the right-field pavilion, the ball rolled next to Zachary's feet. The fifth-grader batted it over to his father, who pounced on it, stood up and handed it back to his son. “They’re just amazing memories,"" Zachary said Thursday, looking back on that night. ""Like after we got it, no one was mad. No one was trying to take it from us. Everyone was just super happy.” His father added: ""We just feel so lucky and honored to be a small part of such a huge moment in Dodger history.""

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",How Roki Sasaki’s arrival to MLB could upend the entire 2025 Latin American signing class,https://sports.yahoo.com/how-roki-sasakis-arrival-to-mlb-could-upend-the-entire-2025-latin-american-signing-class-221050714.html,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 22:10:50 GMT","The overwhelming majority of international amateur free agents are Latin American teenagers, but once in a blue moon, a player such as Sasaki makes the leap and upsets the system.","Roki Sasaki’s impending MLB arrival should be cause for complete and total celebration. The 23-year-old Japanese phenom will immediately become one of the game’s must-see players. Whichever team signs him will have itself a potential frontline starter for the next six seasons. And Sasaki, as talented a young hurler as we’ve ever seen, will get to test his abilities at the highest level. Unfortunately, there’s also a much darker side to the story. And it has very little to do with Sasaki himself. Sasaki, as a non-American, non-Canadian player under the age of 25, will enter stateside baseball as part of international amateur free agency. The international market is an intricate, often unsavory world in which the overwhelming majority of players involved are Latin American teenagers. It is also an incredibly fragile ecosystem, one built upon handshake agreements and verbal promises. That means Sasaki’s entrance into the market has the potential to upend much of the 2025 international signing class, leaving a tornado of mayhem in its wake. There remains a small chance that Sasaki will sign within the 2024 international window, which ends Dec. 15 — that would greatly simplify this process — but commissioner Rob Manfred told reporters Wednesday that he expects Sasaki to sign in the new year. That’s because his Japanese team, the Chiba Lotte Marines, will receive more money by making him available in 2025. But to understand how Sasaki’s MLB arrival could throw the international amateur market into disarray, it’s vital to first understand how the system works. Each year, all 30 MLB teams have a fixed amount of money that they can spend on signing bonuses for international amateur players, known colloquially as the “bonus pool.” The overwhelming majority of those players are Latin American teenagers, but once in a blue moon, a player such as Sasaki or Shohei Ohtani — an established professional from a foreign league who happens to be under the age of 25 — makes the leap and upsets the system. The size of each team’s annual budget depends on (1) a club’s market size and (2) whether the club signed a high-priced free agent who received a qualifying offer in the preceding year. For the upcoming 2025 window, the Dodgers and Giants have the smallest bonus pool size, at $5,146,200, while an octet of teams share the largest sum, at $7,555,500. But while teams cannot officially sign players in the 2025 class until Jan. 15, most amateurs have had verbal agreements in place for years, even though such “early deals” are technically against the rules. In other words, many MLB teams have already allocated their bonus budgets for the upcoming window. Which makes Roki Sasaki — a worthwhile, unexpected cost for the team that signs him — an agent of chaos. Sasaki’s decision to come to MLB now and not two years from now, when he would be a traditional free agent available to the highest bidder, suggests that maxing out his earnings is far from his top priority. The 23-year-old right hander is set to forgo at least $100 million. However, Sasaki isn’t going to sign for free, and there’s certainly a chance that the difference between $2.5 million and $5 million matters in the end. As a result, and because all deals for the 2025 amateur window are, for now, only verbal, a team interested in Sasaki is incentivized to renege or rework any big-ticket agreements currently in place to free up bonus money for the Japanese flamethrower. Here’s a theoretical example. One of the consensus top players in the class is a Dominican shortstop named Elian Peña, who has a verbal agreement with the New York Mets for a bonus north of $4 million. If the Mets think they have a strong chance at Sasaki and believe a few extra million in bonus money could make the difference, they could go to Peña’s representation and try to push down his agreed-upon bonus number. Peña’s reps, who under the current system have little leverage, could do one of two things: accept a reworked deal from the Mets or reopen negotiations with other teams. But while option No. 2 could recoup more money, that money might not be available anywhere. Remember, most teams have already allocated most of their budget. This is where things, according to sources familiar with the international market, could get even more complicated and chaotic. Teams not seriously involved in the Sasaki sweepstakes, knowing that talented amateurs could reenter the market at the last minute, might attempt to renegotiate verbal deals of their own in order to swoop in on those discarded players. That could create a disastrous domino effect in which clubs and players are attempting to rework deals at the 11th hour in a tumultuous, frantic game of musical chairs — all because Sasaki, a pitcher with nearly 400 career innings thrown in the world’s second-best league, somehow falls into the same category as a yet-to-be-paid 16-year-old. Others were skeptical that Sasaki’s arrival would create such a massive ripple effect, citing the importance of maintaining relationships with the trainers and agents who work with most of Latin America’s top amateurs. A team backing out of a deal at the last minute could create lasting discord with one or more of the region’s top power brokers. There’s also a chance that Sasaki, having already left so much money on the table, won’t be overly concerned with his final bonus amount, instead prioritizing the team with which he feels most comfortable. Sources indicated that the order of operations around Sasaki and any cutting of bonuses remains up in the air. It’s unclear whether teams will preemptively renegotiate deals before Jan. 15, the first day signings can be finalized, or wait until the fallout from Sasaki’s signing. But no matter the sequence, it's a near certainty that at least one unfortunate amateur is going to end up with a smaller bonus because of Sasaki’s odd fit within the system. The problem with the entire dynamic is that Sasaki and amateurs seven years his junior are lumped into the same structure. Sasaki will spend the entirety of 2025 in the major leagues; his fellow 2025 signees likely won’t debut until 2030 at the earliest. Sasaki could receive Cy Young votes next year. Most international amateurs will spend 2025 in the Dominican Summer League, the lowest level of professional affiliated baseball. The only other precedent here involves soon-to-be three-time MVP Shohei Ohtani, who made the leap across the Pacific after the 2017 season. But Ohtani’s entrance into the market did not create a whirlwind of chaos in Latin America because (1) his arrival was less of a surprise than Sasaki’s and (2) the signing deadline at the time was in July, not January, meaning Ohtani showed up in the middle of the fiscal year. Even so, Ohtani’s involvement in the international amateur system, a system meant for players of an altogether different type, didn’t make much sense at the time. And since then, that problem has not been fixed. In fact, it has gotten worse. One source called the system “a mess.” Another called it “broken.” Most teams are negotiating with players as young as 12, even though a player must be at least 16 years old on signing day. Some of the amateurs set to sign in the upcoming window verbally agreed to deals as early as spring 2021, around the time that Sasaki debuted in NPB. Yet because of the current international bonus rules, Sasaki’s contract will take money out of someone else’s pocket — which is not at all his fault. It’s like comparing apples and motorcycles. Every team would rather have Sasaki, particularly at such a low price, than any other player available in the 2025 class, and it’s not remotely close. Sasaski is the only proven commodity on offer. As one evaluator put it: “I would much rather sign Sasaki than wait six years to figure out if [a player from the 2025 international class] is good.”",2024-11-21,0,0.56,0.44
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Can UConn pull off a historic three-peat? The next three weeks will provide some answers,https://sports.yahoo.com/can-uconn-pull-off-a-historic-three-peat-the-next-three-weeks-will-provide-some-answers-215112738.html,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 21:51:12 GMT",Dan Hurley is trying to run it back with only one returning starter from last year's championship squad.,"Dan Hurley began his postgame news conference this past Tuesday by laying a printout of the box score on the table in front of him and staring at it with disdain. For the next 10 minutes, the UConn men’s basketball coach acted like he couldn’t find a single positive thing to say about a performance he deemed “comically bad.” Rebounding? “So far below our standard,” Hurley moaned. Ball security? “It’s been a long time since we’ve been that bad,” Hurley howled. Defense? “The amount of times we were driven!” Hurley lamented. “No one played well tonight,” Hurley insisted. “You can have bad shooting nights, but you can’t play like that. That’s not acceptable.” If viewers didn’t know better, they would’ve surely assumed UConn lost to East Texas A&M. In reality, the Huskies won by 35. They opened a double-digit lead in the game’s first nine minutes, extended it to 22 by halftime and coasted to an 81-46 rout. Hurley’s scathing assessment of his team’s performance wasn’t merely a product of UConn’s season-high 19 turnovers against East Texas A&M’s switching defense or the 17 offensive rebounds the Huskies surrendered. The infamously hard-to-please coach clearly wanted to refocus the undefeated Huskies right before their schedule gets a whole lot harder. The next three weeks will serve as the ultimate litmus test for whether two-time reigning national champion UConn is capable of a historic three-peat, a feat no men’s college basketball program has achieved since John Wooden’s UCLA dynasty. The second-ranked Huskies (4-0) will likely play six games during that stretch against teams receiving votes in the current AP Top 25. It begins Monday when UConn opens the Maui Invitational against an undefeated Memphis team that has already toppled the likes of Missouri and UNLV. Up next is either unbeaten Colorado or a Michigan State team that recently pushed No. 1 Kansas deep into the second half. Looming on the other side of the Maui bracket are Auburn, North Carolina and Iowa State, all top-10 teams in the AP poll and many computer metrics. The gauntlet continues after a one-game reprieve against Maryland Eastern Shore. On Dec. 4, 13th-ranked Baylor comes to Storrs. Four days later, UConn visits Texas. Then on Dec. 14, in their final game before Big East play, the Huskies travel to New York for a showdown against third-ranked Gonzaga at Madison Square Garden. That stretch will expose where UConn stands in the early season pecking order. Did Hurley assemble another title contender despite only retaining one starter from last season’s 37-win juggernaut? Or did the loss of NBA lottery picks Donovan Clingan and Stephon Castle and fellow draft picks Tristen Newton and Cam Spencer leave too many holes for Hurley to fill? The way Sacred Heart coach Anthony Latina sees it, comparing this year’s UConn team to the previous one is “probably not fair.” That team completed the best two-year run in modern men’s college basketball history by sweeping the Big East regular season and conference tournament titles with startling ease and laying waste to six straight NCAA tournament opponents by at least 14 points apiece. “That was probably one of the best teams certainly in the last 20 years and maybe in the history of college basketball,” Latina told reporters after UConn trounced his team 92-56 earlier this month. This year’s Huskies aren’t quite as sublimely talented, according to Latina, but they’re still “an elite team” and “going to be right there.” “Are they going to win every NCAA tournament game by double digits?” Latina said. “I think that’s asking too much, but this is a legitimate top-five team, a legitimate Final Four contender, no question.” Le Moyne assistant coach Ben Swank also came away impressed after UConn demolished the Dolphins 90-49 earlier this month. When his teams face a high-major program, Swank is used to marveling at the opposing players’ size, strength and athleticism. UConn had all that, Swank said, plus the Huskies to a man were also highly skilled. “That was a big eye opener to me,” Swank told Yahoo Sports. That’s how you could tell, OK, this is a top-tier program in the country. This just isn't just any high major out there.” The return of Hurley and versatile forward Alex Karaban are the two biggest reasons UConn can dare to dream of a three-peat. Hurley swatted aside the chance to become Kentucky’s next men’s basketball coach and passed on the Los Angeles Lakers job after a whirlwind courtship. Karaban might have come off the board as early as the late first round and almost certainly would have been the fifth UConn player selected had he remained in last June’s NBA Draft. On offense, Karaban has gone from complementary piece to focal point without sacrificing any of his trademark efficiency. The 6-foot-8 junior is scoring a team-high 16.3 points per game by knocking down spot-up jumpers, attacking close-outs and staying active on the offensive glass. If anything, UConn needs Karaban to get more aggressive hunting shots because 8.3 field goal attempts per game isn’t enough. On defense, Karaban is UConn’s vocal leader and most dependable on-ball and help defender. He has even blocked 13 shots already this season, a product of his positional size, anticipation, motor and knack for sliding his feet to stay in front of his man. “He’s a very high-IQ, very high-level player,” said Swank, who put together his program’s defensive game plan against UConn. “He’s going to find ways to score the ball. You try to guard some screens this way or that way, and he’s really good at reading it and putting himself in a great position.” For this UConn team to accomplish what the previous two have, Hurley needs his returning role players to shoulder more responsibility and some of his prized newcomers to make an instant impact. Already, sophomore guard Solomon Ball has validated preseason projections that he’d produce a breakout season, freshman Liam McNeeley has lived up to his reputation as a skilled 6-foot-7 shotmaker and sophomore Jayden Ross has flashed immense potential. Questions remain, however, at the five spot and at point guard. Can the combination of transfer Tarris Reed Jr. and career role player Samson Johnson come close to duplicating the interior scoring and rim protection that Clingan provided last season? And can either fifth-year senior Hassan Diarra or Saint Mary’s transfer Aidan Mahaney evolve into a Newton-esque point guard capable of initiating the offense and making shrewd decisions with the ball in their hands? The lack of a point guard who can consistently get in the paint and make plays for others is generally regarded as UConn’s most glaring weakness, but Swank argued that’s selling Diarra and Mahaney short. Diarra, Swank said, is “unbelievably solid and composed” and “did a little bit of everything well” against LeMoyne. Mahaney has come out of the blocks slowly, Swank admitted, but the LeMoyne assistant suspects he just needs more time to adjust to his new teammates. “One that Mahaney has lacked is a scoring threat going to the rim,” Swank said. “I know he missed one or two easier ones against us. I think that will come once he gets a feel for his team, but that’s something he could definitely do better.” Until last year, only two men’s college basketball programs had won back-to-back national titles since Wooden’s heyday at UCLA that ran into the early 1970s: Florida in 2006 and 2007 and Duke in 1991 and 1992. All five Florida starters bypassed the NBA Draft to return to chase a second championship. Christian Laettner, Bobby Hurley and Grant Hill were among the four Duke starters who did the same. What UConn accomplished last season was an even more audacious feat. Hurley didn’t have the luxury of bringing his team back intact in a quest for a repeat. Five of his first title team’s top eight players moved on after the Huskies ripped through the 2023 NCAA tournament. Now Hurley is again trying to reload on the fly — and again his greatest enemies are bad habits and complacency. He’ll twist himself into knots seeking ways to motivate his team, even after a 35-point home victory in the fourth game of the season. “Once we got up 37 with 12 minutes to go, it turned into just a debacle out there,” Hurley groused. Message delivered. Loud and clear.",2024-11-21,0,0.65,0.35

The guys start with the big number, which is 826 this week. That's the number of 3-point shots LeBron James has made since joining the Lakers. If you don't think that's a lot, tune in to hear which Hall of Fame players never made that many 3-point shots in their entire career. But it's the efficiency of LeBron's season that has really caught the eye of both Tom and Dan. He is currently posting career highs in points created per 36, points scored on plays where LeBron is in the pick-and-roll and percentage of his baskets that are assisted. The success of the 10-4 Lakers, as well as the success of rookie forward Dalton Knecht, can be directly attributed to the increased efficiency and proficiency of LeBron James, who turns 40 in about six weeks. That's crazy. Is there a case to be made that he's having his most impressive season?

According to ESPN, Miller is being investigated for potentially betting on Temple games in which he played. At the end of last season, Temple games had been flagged for unusual wagering activity. From ESPN: Temple spokesperson Steve Orbanek told ESPN that the school is ""aware of the deeply concerning allegations of sports wagering last season."" He said the university had not ""received any requests for information"" from state or federal law enforcement but ""will cooperate fully should we be contacted."" The NCAA declined to comment. In a statement, the FBI said it would neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation. In early March, U.S. Integrity said there was notable line movement ahead of Temple’s game against UAB. The line moved five points in the Blazers’ direction and they closed as 7.5-point favorites. UAB covered the spread easily in a 100-72 win. That flag by the gambling service came after it had been reportedly monitoring Temple games for “a while.” In Temple’s game before it played UAB, the line quickly moved in Tulsa’s favor. Tulsa beat Temple by five points in that contest. Miller played three seasons at Temple and was the team’s leading scorer in 2023-24. The Owls were just 5-13 in conference play but won four games in the AAC tournament as part of a remarkable run led by Miller’s scoring outburst. The Owls took down UTSA, SMU, Charlotte and Florida Atlantic to get to the AAC title game. There, the Owls lost to UAB again, 85-69, and failed to make the NCAA tournament.

The weekend features three games between ranked teams and one of those contests is in the Big 12. No one will mistake the Big 12 for an elite conference this season, but it's been extremely fun and extremely even. Nine teams are still mathematically alive for the conference title. If you love chaos, you want some upsets over the final two weeks of the season. BYU and Colorado are tied atop the conference at 6-1 and both head on the road in Week 13. The Cougars are underdogs at third-place Arizona State, while Colorado is a slight favorite at a Kansas team that just ended BYU's undefeated season. Here's a look at what to watch in Week 13. (All times are Eastern and all odds are from BetMGM.) Time: Noon | TV: Fox | Line: Ohio State -13.5 | Total: 51.5 Here’s Indiana’s big test. The College Football Playoff discussion has been unfairly dominated by Indiana’s undefeated record against the teams on its schedule. The Hoosiers had a weak non-conference slate and, well, a weak Big Ten conference schedule too. Either Michigan or Washington is the best team the Hoosiers have beaten this season. That conference schedule isn’t Indiana’s fault. And the Hoosiers haven’t scheduled non-conference games like a team needing to post its schedule strength for the College Football Playoff because, well, they haven’t been in playoff contention. After years of being in the same division as Ohio State, Michigan and Penn State, we think the Hoosiers deserved a season where they didn’t have to play all three teams. Indiana is powered by an efficient passing offense led by fringe Heisman contender Kurtis Rourke and a defense that’s forcing nearly two turnovers per game. DB Amare Ferrell has four interceptions while defensive lineman Mikail Kamara has 9.5 sacks. Ohio State enters the game down two starting offensive linemen following center Seth McLaughlin’s torn Achilles on Tuesday. The Buckeyes have done a fantastic job moving pieces around on the offensive line following left tackle Josh Simmons’ injury. Can they adequately replace the Alabama transfer too? The Buckeyes are giving up the fewest points per game of any team in college football after allowing just seven points over their last two games. Only Oregon has scored more than 17 points against Ohio State all season. Indiana’s going to need to score more than 17 to win. Time: 3:30 p.m. | TV: Fox | Line: Colorado -3 | Total: 59.5 The Buffaloes carry a four-game win streak into Arrowhead Stadium to face a team that just ruined BYU’s undefeated season. Colorado has scored at least 34 points in each of those wins as Shedeur Sanders is playing like one of the best quarterbacks in the country. Sanders is completing 73% of his passes and has already thrown for over 3,200 yards. If Colorado makes the Big 12 title game, he’s got a great chance to throw for over 4,000 yards before the postseason. It’s a good thing that Sanders is picking opposing defenses apart, because Colorado still can’t run the football. The Buffaloes average just 77 yards per game on the ground as Isaiah Augustave is the team’s leading rusher with 362 yards and four touchdowns. Kansas isn’t far from being a team with a winning record. The win over BYU was KU’s sixth one-possession game and just the first one the team has won this season. The Jayhawks held BYU to just one TD as the Cougars turned the ball over twice. QB Jalon Daniels has played better as Kansas has won three of its last four games. But the key to another upset could be RB Devin Neal. Opponents had rushed for more than 100 yards in every game against Colorado until Utah could only put up 31 in Week 12. Time: 3:30 p.m. | TV: ESPN | Line: Arizona State -3 | Total: 48.5 It’s time to start paying attention to Arizona State if you haven’t been. The Sun Devils are fresh off a win at Kansas State and have won three straight games since a loss at Cincinnati led coach Kenny Dillingham to call for open tryouts at kicker. The Sun Devils are led by RB Cam Skattebo. He’s rushed 198 times for 1,098 yards and 11 TDs and has also added 31 catches for 448 yards and two scores. In addition to being ASU’s leading rusher, he’s also the team’s second-leading receiver behind Jordyn Tyson. Michigan State transfer Sam Leavitt has thrived after taking over for Jeff Sims at QB. He’s averaging 4.5 yards a carry and has 21 total TDs in nine games. Eight defensive players have tallied an interception so far this season, as safety Myles Rowser leads the team in tackles. A win likely puts Arizona State a victory away from the Big 12 title game too. BYU’s path to the Big 12 title game simply lost its margin for error with the defeat to Kansas. The Cougars are in the championship game with two more wins. But it’s easy to wonder if the luck ran out against Kansas. The Cougars have been the inverse of the Jayhawks so far this season. That Week 12 game was BYU’s fifth one-score game of the season and just the Cougars’ first loss. The BYU offense needs to do a better job of scoring TDs against Arizona State. The Cougars had scored at last 34 points in six straight games before its 22-21 win over Utah. And now BYU has scored just 35 points combined in its last two games. Time: 7 p.m. | TV: NBC | Line: Notre Dame -14.5 | Total: 44.5 How long can Army hang around with Notre Dame? The Black Knights’ triple-option offense is not built to post a quick comeback. Just ask Navy. The Midshipmen were buried by turnovers in the first half of their game against the Fighting Irish earlier this season and had no chance of a comeback. QB Bryson Daily leads the team with 174 carries for 1,062 yards and 21 scores, while RB Kanye Udoh has 856 rushing yards and nine TDs. Watch out for RB Noah Short as a big-play receiving threat too. He has 11 catches for 259 yards and three TDs. Army gives up just over 10 points per game, though the Black Knights have also played a very manageable schedule. Before Notre Dame, the toughest opponent for Army has been East Carolina. That game came before ECU fired coach Mike Houston and reeled off three straight wins to get bowl eligible. Notre Dame is also stingy on defense. As Ohio State ranks first in scoring defense and Army is second, Notre Dame is third at 11.4 points per contest. So the under may be a good play. Possessions will be at a premium as Notre Dame’s offense is also heavily run-based. The Irish are averaging six yards a carry so far this season compared to QB Riley Leonard’s 6.9 yards a pass attempt. Leonard has been a much better passer over the second half of the season, but the offense is powered by his legs along with RBs Jeremiyah Love and Jadarian Price. Time: 7:30 p.m. | TV: ESPN | Line: Texas A&M -2.5 | Total: 46.5 Maybe this is the week that Auburn puts a complete game together against a good SEC opponent. Oddsmakers certainly think there’s a chance of that happening. The Tigers are 1-5 in the SEC this season and need to beat both Texas A&M and Alabama to make a bowl game. Auburn is averaging nearly two turnovers per game, though the mistakes have abated in recent weeks. After two five-turnover games in the first four weeks of the season, the Tigers haven’t turned the ball over more than once since. But Auburn is still minus-11 in turnover margin for the season thanks to a defense that has failed to force a turnover in six games so far this season. Yet when the defense shows up, the offense can’t do its job. Just look at the Vanderbilt game. Auburn held Diego Pavia to 9-of-23 passing for 143 yards and 227 yards overall, yet the Commodores won 17-7. Marcel Reed is still the starting QB for the Aggies since taking over for Conner Weigman against LSU. He threw for two TDs and rushed for another a week ago against New Mexico State. A&M is tied with Texas atop the SEC and needs the win to make next week’s rivalry game a semifinal for the SEC title game. If both Texas and Texas A&M win on Saturday, the winner of the regular-season finale is guaranteed a spot in the conference championship. No. 9 Ole Miss at Florida (Noon, ABC): Florida is a win away from bowl eligibility, while Ole Miss needs to win its final two games to likely qualify for the College Football Playoff. The Gators upset LSU at home a week ago, though freshman QB DJ Lagway could be haunted by the Ole Miss pass rush given his lack of mobility because of his hamstring injury. No. 13 SMU at Virginia (Noon, ESPN2): Like Florida, Virginia needs one more win to qualify for the postseason and hosts a team that has playoff hopes of its own. The Mustangs can clinch a spot in the ACC title game with a win thanks to Clemson’s loss to Louisville earlier this season. No. 4 Penn State at Minnesota (3:30 p.m., CBS): Are the Nittany Lions going to be on upset alert? They’re two-score favorites, but Minnesota is good to muck up a game or two and we wouldn’t be surprised if this one is bit closer than expected. Penn State needs to win its final two games and get a lot of help to advance to the Big Ten title game. No. 12 Boise State at Wyoming (7 p.m., CBSSN): Boise State is a big favorite in this one. We only have it in this category to remind you that Ashton Jeanty has a great chance of surpassing the 2,000-yard mark on Saturday night. A four-TD night would also give Jeanty 30 rushing TDs for the season.",2024-11-21,1,0.46,0.54

The defensive back and wide receiver put the obvious on the record in a news conference with reporters on Thursday and said that the 2024 college football season would be his last before entering the NFL Draft. Hunter is a possible top-five pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. “That’s definitely for sure,” Hunter said when asked about the 2025 draft. Hunter is the prohibitive favorite for the Heisman Trophy with two weeks to go in the regular season. His odds are -400 at BetMGM. Boise State RB Ashton Jeanty is the No. 2 favorite at +400. Hunter also said that he believed he could be a two-way player in the NFL like he is in college football and said that “nobody has stopped me from doing it thus far.” What Hunter is doing is unprecedented in modern college football and would be unprecedented in the modern NFL. He has 74 catches for 911 yards and 10 total TDs despite missing a half in two of Colorado’s 10 games so far this season. He also has 24 tackles and three interceptions to go along with eight passes defensed. Hunter has surpassed the numbers he put up over nine games in his first season at the top level of college football. Hunter arrived at Colorado ahead of the 2023 season from Jackson State when Deion Sanders took the Buffaloes job. As a sophomore last season, Hunter had 57 catches for 721 yards and five TDs while recording 30 tackles. He was named a first-team All-American as an all-purpose player and is assuredly going to be an All-American again in 2024. Hunter’s excellence has helped put Colorado in the mix for the Big 12 title. If the Buffaloes win their final two games of the season against Kansas and Oklahoma State, they will play in the Big 12 title game. A win in the Big 12 championship would give Colorado an automatic bid to the College Football Playoff.",2024-11-21,1,0.37,0.63
"Yahoo!

Once upon a time, this was the most famous rivalry in the land, a war that bewitched the entire country. Americans waited anxiously for newspapers, gathered around radios, stared into the glow of massive early television sets to learn which of these titans would claim the year’s finest, most important game. Army-Notre Dame inspired both the greatest lede in the history of sports journalism — Grantland Rice’s “Outlined against a blue-gray October sky, the Four Horsemen rode again” — and the greatest pregame speech in sports history, Knute Rockne’s “Win one for the Gipper” plea. It’s the wellspring of sports as myth, of coaches as stern but loving father figures and players as doomed or exalted heroes. So it’s somehow perfect, narratively speaking, that this rivalry, which has fallen so far from its 20th-century heights, could once again alter the trajectory of an entire sport. The business of college football today would be unrecognizable to Rockne, Red Blaik, Ara Parseghian and other legends of the Notre Dame-Army rivalry, but the primary focus — size up that man on the other side of the line, beat him and let the cards fall where they may — would be warmly familiar. Army and Notre Dame claimed 16 national championships in the 20th century, including seven in the 1940s alone (technically six, since they share 1946). They’ve fallen far since then; Army’s last title season was in 1946, and Notre Dame’s was in 1988. The Irish have fought their way back to prominence since then, using limitless resources, a de facto personal broadcast network and a nationwide recruiting footprint. The far more interesting transformation is happening in West Point, where Army is in the midst of making history on multiple fronts. The 9-0 Black Knights are one win away from just the fourth double-digit win in the entire 131-year history of the program. You have to go all the way back to 1958 to find Army’s last undefeated season. Aside from one seven-year stint in Conference USA around the turn of the millennium, Army has been a proud Independent until this year, when it stomped into the AAC and took control of the joint. The miracle here is how Army has put itself into this position despite not being able to take advantage of college football’s two earth-shattering weapons: NIL and the transfer portal. The Army doesn’t permit its players to take NIL money, and one doesn’t just parachute into West Point for a single mercenary season. But it’s not hard to see how Army’s old-school ethos is a counterintuitive benefit. While other AAC schools were getting raided for their best talent, or trying to slap together a crew of one-off bounty hunters, Army is building a team. (Yes, this sounds like a commercial. That doesn’t make it any less true.) Quarterback Bryson Daily, for instance, played exactly one game as a freshman and didn’t throw a pass. He played five as a sophomore, and scored two touchdowns on 12 rushing attempts. He took over the starting job as a junior, and now, as a senior, leads all FBS quarterbacks in rushing yards and ranks second in rushing touchdowns with 21. That’s the kind of wait-your-turn, be-ready-when-called mindset that the portal and NIL have already devastated across the country. As Florida State has demonstrated to chilling effect, it’s not enough to bring in a bunch of starred recruits, toss them a ball and expect them to win games. Team cohesion helps, too, the kind of cohesion you get from living, eating, practicing and bleeding together for three or four seasons. NIL can paper over a lot of college football’s sins, but it can’t replace that. Army beats its opponents by grinding them into dust, holding the ball for massive chunks of the game and using opportunistic turnovers and a conservative, ball-control offense to own the tempo. It’s a way to defeat a physically superior opponent; stay in the conversation long enough and you can take control of it … both in the game and in the season. Granted, despite its unblemished record, Army’s strength of schedule is a real concern. The Black Knights rank 19th in the current CFP standings, behind a raft of one-, two- and three-loss teams. The SEC and Big Ten can squabble about who’s the better conference; no such debates exist with the AAC. That’s what makes this weekend’s Notre Dame rematch so compelling, and so crucial. Army now has the chance to upend the entire playoff structure. All it has to do is overcome a projected 14.5-point spread and break a 15-game losing streak that dates back to 1958. But if Army can manage that, everything opens up — a new Group of Five team works its way into the playoff conversation, and the Irish are either out of the mix entirely or trying to justify their way in over a fellow two-loss SEC squad. And once the playoff begins, who knows what could happen next? We’re in uncharted territory here. Sure, Army-Notre Dame might not ever return to its glory days when it determined the fate of the college football universe. But it’s back to being a crucial, must-watch matchup, and that’s one of so many elements of this season that’s worth celebrating.",2024-11-21,0,0.65,0.35

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",'I'm in a good spot': Bulls' Zach LaVine is turning some heads amid trade rumors,https://sports.yahoo.com/im-in-a-good-spot-bulls-zach-lavine-is-turning-some-heads-amid-trade-rumors-180518432.html,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:05:18 GMT",The Bulls star is reminding the NBA world of what he can do when healthy.,"DETROIT — It was almost as if Zach LaVine was playing possum, watching teammate Nikola Vučević feast on a lax Pistons defense — and then, he exploded. It was one triple in the fourth, then another, and another, and another. You could see it in his gait, the light steps, the easy release. The only ones who didn’t seem to notice LaVine on a heater were the Pistons, who were trying to reach the benchmark of .500, as a true show of progress. Only LaVine ruthlessly snatched it away with six 3-pointers in the fourth quarter of the Bulls’ 122-112 win at Little Casears Arena on Monday night. He had only seven points entering the fourth, but exploded for 18, finishing with 25. After playing just 25 games last year before right foot surgery ended his season in February, the discussion surrounding LaVine was more about his max contract, trade rumors and his rocky relationship with coach Billy Donovan. In fact, it was about everything but his game, and it didn’t go unnoticed. “I heard everything,” LaVine told Yahoo Sports on Monday. “I read everything. Sometimes you gotta take that accountability and put a chip on your shoulder. There’s a lot of things people said I had to prove. I think my resume speaks for itself, the type of player I am, the type of person I am, but it is what it is. “You can always turn some heads.” LaVine smiles easy and jumps even easier, even after multiple operations that would’ve sapped the athleticism of most players. But there is an edge to him this season. He’s playing with more force while also working within the scheme of Donovan’s guard-heavy roster. Always efficient, LaVine is playing above his usual numbers, shooting 51% from the field and 43% from 3-point range (both career highs) on over seven 3-point attempts a night, and averaging 22 points, 5.2 rebounds and 4.2 assists. In this luxury-tax-apron world, where teams have seemingly put themselves in worse positions in terms of player movement, every dollar is counted. So conversations surrounding acquiring LaVine often start with the five-year, $215 million deal he signed in the summer of 2022. And when players are injured, it’s easy to forget how good they are, or can be when active. “I don’t know,” LaVine said. “It’s not for me to try to make everybody like me. I’m happy for what I got, what I deserved. And some people may not feel that way and you may judge it off that. But regardless, I know who I am and what I’ve done in this league.” It’s no secret the Bulls were shopping LaVine the past couple of years, and as time moves on with his deal, there’s no doubt a better market will form if the franchise wants to reengage. After next season, he’ll have a player option in 2026-27 for $48 million, and he can hit free agency again at 32 years old. But for now, he’s a bright spot on an up-and-down Bulls team. He came into training camp about 10 pounds lighter, ostensibly to take pressure off his knees. He spent the summer training at The Box training center in Costa Mesa, California, where he learned, “You don’t play boxing.” He sparred with Jesús Soto Karass, a former welterweight and junior middleweight boxer from Mexico. “I got in the ring with him and I jabbed him one time too hard during one of our sparring sessions, and he beat my ass,” LaVine said with a full laugh. “If I’m ever in the wrong situation, I can defend myself, but you don’t play boxing with those dudes.” It served its purpose, though, as he looks healthier and still bouncy — ready to take over those fourth quarters again. He’s a long way away from the two-time dunk champion; he’s a more complete player on both ends, picking his spots until he can put a stamp on games. “I’m in a good place and I feel sharp right now,” LaVine said. “Being able to be one of the veteran guys on the team and still being able to do what I do. Help win in any way I can. Defense one day, facilitating, whatever they call for.” The occasional defensive lapses don’t come as often, and even though he hasn’t advanced past the first round of the postseason in his career, it’s been more a failure in team building than in LaVine’s personal exploits. [Why Josh Giddey is a power forward, not a point guard] The one time the Bulls had real hope over the past six or seven years was the short-lived period when LaVine and DeMar DeRozan could terrorize opponents, buoyed by a healthy Lonzo Ball. LaVine ceded space for DeRozan to take over fourth quarters and the two worked together easily. DeRozan had numerous game-winners, and LaVine, as the better deep shooter, could play that role. Both were All-Stars in 2022, the only year all three were healthy going into the season. “I had plenty of games where I’ve had to take over, but the respect you give DeMar, you don’t want to take away from what he does best,” LaVine said. “I had to take a step back off the ball because you don’t put DeMar in the corner. It’s not gonna be what’s best for him or the team. I can play off the ball. “I’ve seen how DeMar plays in the fourth and how he calms down. And just for me, a learning experience. I tip my hat to DeMar, I love DeMar, but there’s a lot of work I put into this, too.” It goes back to the good place he spoke of. The self-awareness about where he is, his contract, his standing in the league. He doesn’t seem stressed about the situation in Chicago, the future. LaVine is also relishing the opportunity to show how his game has grown, and how it applies in a winning situation. One can assume a handful of teams are watching. “I’ve gone through ups and downs with that,” LaVine said. “I've had some really good, good games, and years. I've had some times where I've had some turnovers and some bad games. And I think that's all with the experience of being in the NBA. “I'm in a good spot and understanding what the game means for me at the time, and how to try to contribute to winning.”",2024-11-21,0,0.6,0.4

To help you make them, here's a look at six players with bust potential in Week 12. Something to keep in mind as you're reading: a ""fade"" or ""bust"" designation doesn't automatically mean you should sit a player, depending on the depth of the rest of your roster or available options on your waiver wire. It's really difficult to imagine fading a fantasy quarterback throwing to Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua on any given week — especially in what could be a high-scoring matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles with plenty of offensive firepower on both sidelines. However, this feels like the ultimate trap game ... in particular for Rams QB Matthew Stafford. Stafford is coming off his best fantasy performance of the season in Week 11, going 18-of-27 for 295 passing yards and 4 TDs against the New England Patriots, resulting in 27.8 fantasy points as the overall QB5 on the week. While it would appear that a matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles could be intriguing at first glance, it bears repeating that this Eagles secondary is not the same as it was last year. The unit that ranked top-three in net passing yards per game (255.7) and second-most passing TDs all season (38) is no more; it's the Reed Blankenship, Cooper DeJean and Quinyon Mitchell show now. Joining Darius Slay and C.J. Gardner-Johnson in the secondary, this group of defensive backs has been massively underrated, allowing the second-fewest pass yards per game (172.2), a league-low 5.0 yards per pass attempt and tied for the third-fewest passing touchdowns all season (9). Heat check 🔥 Unless you're in a two-QB or Superflex league, Stafford is better left on fantasy benches this week, even despite an intriguing 49.5-point projected total from oddsmakers this week. Carolina Panthers RB Chuba Hubbard has had a standout season in 2024 and was handsomely rewarded for his production (on one of the league's worst offenses, mind you) with a nice, big contract extension. He showed he was worth it in the game immediately following, too, posting 169 scrimmage yards and a score in Week 10 ahead of their bye. Despite his recent dominance this season, there are two glaring reasons to suspect Hubbard won't keep up the path of production. The first of those reasons is the matchup; this week, the Panthers will face the Kansas City Chiefs, who have been among the most prolific run defenses this year, holding opposing RBs to a league-low 3.11 yards per carry and giving up a league-low 522 rushing yards over 10 games. Their 12.82 fantasy points per game allowed to the position ranks dead last in the league. Paired with the difficult matchup on deck is the planned debut for second-round rookie RB Jonathon Brooks, who will play in his first NFL game coming off a torn ACL which has held him out so far this year. It doesn't seem likely that he'll hold a significant role in Week 12, but any chunk of the pie he gets is a piece off Hubbard's plate. Heat check 🔥 You'll likely be in a position where you need to start Hubbard given the six teams that are on a bye this week. However, it's best to expect something closer to an RB3/RB4 performance from him, rather than his standard top-12 finish, even if Brooks does handle a minimal role. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. The Chicago Bears have undergone a significant shift over the past two weeks, firing former OC Shane Waldron and promoting passing coordinator Thomas Brown to call plays in the meantime. In Brown's first game calling plays, the offense managed its highest yardage total (391) since October 6's win over the Carolina Panthers — that's the good news. Usually, that would mean exciting things for the run game, but there's another side to that coin (the bad news). In Week 12, the Bears will get a matchup with the Minnesota Vikings, a matchup that has ranked among the league's most stifling this season. The Vikings defense is allowing the second-lowest YPC average (3.6), second-fewest rush yards after contact per attempt (2.4) and the third-lowest explosive run rate (9.3%) this season, giving up the second-least fantasy points per game to opposing RBs (14.54). Another interesting tidbit worth noting in terms of Swift's upside in the week to come is an increase in workload for backup RB Roschon Johnson last week. He saw a season-high offensive snap rate of 42% and earned a season-high 11 touches. The fact that this bump in usage coincided with the coaching shift is intriguing. Plus Swift is dealing with a groin injury that forced him out of practice Wednesday, though HC Matt Eberflus says he's hopeful he'll play. Heat check 🔥 Swift should be started in most leagues, barring much better options, as he's exhibited a fairly safe floor dating back to Week 4, with 10+ fantasy points in all but one game since then. However, a challenging matchup paired with an uptick in work for Johnson last week makes Swift less appealing than usual. We're fading the passer this week, so why not fade his top target? As noted above, the Philadelphia Eagles have had a sneaky-good passing defense since Cooper DeJean took over a near-full-time role in Week 6. Though he plays primarily slot corner, his presence has virtually transformed the secondary into a shutdown unit. Since Week 6, here's a look at the performance of the Eagles' secondary against targets to WRs lined up out wide and where it ranks among other defenses per Next Gen Stats: 36.8% passing success rate (league-low) 45.4 NFL passer rating (league-low) 45.6% completion rate (league-low) -0.15 EPA per dropback (second-lowest) 273 yards (third-fewest) The Eagles' secondary is also the only team to not allow a single touchdown to WRs lined up out wide in that span. Given that Nacua primarily plays along the boundary (74% snap rate this season) while teammate Cooper Kupp mans the slot at a 69% snap rate, there are realistic concerns that he could have an inefficient day. Heat check 🔥 Under no circumstances do you bench Nacua; he's a star with absurd play strength and does benefit from lining up alongside Kupp, which could help split coverage against this stingy Eagles' secondary. However, if this is the week you need a monster game, brace yourself for a potential disappointment. The DeVonta Smith experience has had its ups and downs in the 2024 season; he's averaging a career-high 74.5% catch rate with career-high slot usage (52.9% compared to his previous career-high of 31.1%). While that seems to have raised his overall floor for fantasy, having managed 64 or more receiving yards in six of nine games this year, it does seem as though his upside has been capped, yet to surpass the 90-receiving yard mark in any given game. In Week 12, he'll face the Los Angeles Rams in a sneakily challenging matchup against WRs lined up in the slot, which could mean another so-so performance for fantasy managers. Dating back to Week 6, the Rams are allowing a league-low 29% success rate on targets to WRs per NFL Next Gen Stats, giving up a 41.4 NFL passer rating (45.2% completion rate) and a ridiculous 1:5 TD:INT ratio on such plays. Heat check 🔥 As I've noted a few times in this article, this feels like more of a trap game for fantasy managers than it does the barn-burner we're all hoping for given the firepower of these respective offenses. Given Smith's lack of ceiling this year paired with a challenging matchup, Smith isn't a must-start in Week 12 if you have better options. If you do have to start him on a week full of byes, do so with tempered expectations. There was a point earlier this season (right around Weeks 4-8) where many suspected they'd found the answer to their tight end woes in second-year Packer Tucker Kraft. Unfortunately, his level of consistency as a red-zone weapon has tapered off in recent weeks, failing to produce a single catch in Week 11 coming off Green Bay's bye. Just in case you were holding out hope for a bounce-back performance, however, it doesn't seem likely to come up against the San Francisco 49ers in Week 12, even if they do layup some designed touches for him one week out from his goose egg. The 49ers have been a challenging matchup for opposing tight ends this season, failing to allow a single TE more than 10 fantasy points in a single matchup, giving up the second-lowest Y/A average on targets to the position in the league (5.5), only behind the Houston Texans. Their 44.6% success rate on pass attempts targeting TEs ranks fourth-lowest in the league, per Next Gen Stats, allowing just 356 yards (fourth-fewest) and 2 TDs (tied for ninth-fewest) to the position all season. Heat check 🔥 There's an expectation for a certain level of volatility every time you roll out a Packers pass catcher, but given the Niners' strengths over the middle of the field and history of shutting down more-than-capable TEs this season, Kraft is better left on your bench. Consider a streaming option like rookie Ja'Tavion Sanders, who has a favorable matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs this week.",2024-11-21,0,0.64,0.36
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",'From star-taking to star-making': How LA Galaxy returned to the top by shunning big names,https://sports.yahoo.com/from-star-taking-to-star-making-how-la-galaxy-returned-to-the-top-by-shunning-big-names-180026540.html,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:00:26 GMT","The Galaxy's resurgence is undeniable, but their ultimate validation awaits.","The juxtaposition, in January 2021, was stark. When Greg Vanney returned to Major League Soccer’s winningest franchise, the LA Galaxy, as head coach, he’d walk past statues and stocked trophy cases, into a club that seemed stuck in the past. “There wasn't really a scouting department,” Vanney said he remembers. The “sports science department … was one guy's computer.” And the result was that the kings of MLS 2.0 were getting left behind. The Galaxy once ruled this fledgling league. They transformed it with celebrity. They elevated it with spending. They became its most recognizable brand. And they won. A lot. They reached nine of the first 19 MLS Cup finals. They won five. They were the envy of the league, a destination for marketable stars, until MLS began to evolve. As its soccer got more sophisticated; and as its operations professionalized; and as club owners and sporting directors alike realized that the way to attract fans was with on-field quality more so than big-name stars, the Galaxy, for years, failed to evolve with it. And so, for nearly a decade, the Galaxy fell from their throne. Since their 2014 title, they have not advanced past the MLS quarterfinals; they missed the playoffs five times in seven years; they have not lifted a trophy of any kind. They also violated roster rules. Their transfer business often felt unscientific or chaotic. By 2023, their most loyal fans had had enough. Prominent supporters groups began boycotting home games. Attendance dipped. Losses accumulated. The external discontent, Vanney admits, began affecting the humans inside the club. That, in a nutshell, was the environment that Will Kuntz walked into last spring. His task, as senior vice president of player personnel and now general manager, was to revive this stumbling giant. And a “major” part of his plan — the plan that pushed the Galaxy back toward the top of the Western Conference, into a home quarterfinal vs. Minnesota on Sunday (6 p.m. ET, FS1) — was to shed the club’s superficial identity, to “care less about who a player is, in terms of pedigree.” “We wanted to shift away from star-taking,” Kuntz says, “to star-making.” The 29-year history of Los Angeles’ lone MLS original is littered with names you probably know. First, there were domestic stars, such as Cobi Jones and Landon Donovan. Then, there was David Beckham — and Robbie Keane, Steven Gerrard, Ashley Cole, Giovani dos Santos, Jonathan dos Santos, Chicharito and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. One would leave, another would arrive, because, well, why not? The Designated Player rule allows clubs to spend limitlessly on three stars. Who wouldn’t want well-known ones with experience at the tippy-top of the sport? Somewhere along the way, the why seemed to drift out of front-office equations. Or, perhaps, the equations strayed too far away from soccer. “There was a belief that, like, getting these big European stars was part of our ethos, and part of our culture, part of who we are,” Kuntz says. He saw it differently: “I think that's a byproduct of who we are, and why we won, but it's not really what is core to the Galaxy. What the Galaxy are really about is winning, being the flagship franchise of MLS, and representing the city of Los Angeles with a dynamic, fun-to-watch team. “And you can do that with really high-end international players at the end of their career,” he clarifies. “But that's not the most important thing.” This was his pitch to ownership as he took the job last spring, jumping from crosstown rival LAFC. This was the pitch as he approached his first offseason with two DP slots vacant. To fill them, he’d ask a single question: “How good is the player? What is he gonna bring to the group?” “It's really liberating,” he says, to be focused on only that one thing. And to answer the question, he relied on a scouting system and recruitment process that he, Vanney and others had been building and refining for years. When the head coach arrived in 2021, “a lot of scouting was done through relationships, connections,” and the occasional road trip. “It wasn't a robust system,” Vanney says. It lagged behind most other MLS clubs, who’ve been integrating data, full-time scouts stationed on other continents, and video. “So,” Vanney says, “our initial rebuild of the team wasn't done in a lot of advanced scouting. … It was like, ‘We need some players with speed, we need certain qualities to add to this team ... What's out there, and what can we get? What can we afford? Who's ready to move?’” Simultaneously, though, the club began to construct a scouting department. They crafted player profiles. They built and maintained shortlists of targets, position by position. “We started to get more proactive,” Vanney says. They stopped chasing big names or quick fixes, and instead developed a longer-term plan — which they stuck to last year, despite a rash of injuries and a 26th-place finish. Then, last winter, they dipped into the shortlists. And rather than look to soccer celebrities, they looked to Belgium, where they’d identified Ghanaian winger Joseph Paintsil; they looked to Brazil, where they’d found 23-year-old winger Gabriel Pec. They added American goalkeeper John McCarthy and Japanese defender Miki Yamane. They signed Spanish forward Miguel Barry, but stuck with Bosnian striker Dejan Joveljić as their No. 9. They didn’t actively shy away from stars — and, in the summer, signed German attacker Marco Reus as a free agent — but applied the same criteria to each target: “How good is he?” And they quickly realized that the collective answer was: Very. They realized their improvement, in many ways, before they’d even won a game. On opening weekend, they hosted the league’s newest glamor club, Inter Miami. They welcomed Lionel Messi and friends, but not with open arms. They outshot Miami 24-11; they out-created the eventual Supporters Shield winners, 3.4 Expected Goals (xG) to 0.6. “We played them up head to head, and we felt like we were the better team on the day,” Vanney says. “We were every bit as good as them.” At the final whistle, they were heated and somewhat deflated. Sergio Busquets had simulated a foul to get LA’s Marky Delgado sent off. Messi equalized in stoppage time. The match ended 1-1. In the locker room later, and in the stands all evening, everyone realized: “This team could be really good.” Week after week, players fed off that energy, the polar opposite of what they’d encountered last season. They sprinted to the top of the Western Conference, going unbeaten at home, and stayed there for much of the season. On Decision Day, they coughed up the conference lead to LAFC. But they instantly rebounded in the playoffs. Riqui Puig, perhaps the league’s top showman west of Florida, orchestrated a first-round rout of Colorado. The aggregate score over two legs: Galaxy 9, Rapids 1. And so, their resurgence has been undeniable, but its ultimate validation awaits. Sunday's quarterfinal clash against Minnesota represents more than just a playoff game; it's a litmus test for the club's redefined identity. A win puts them on a potential conference-final collision course with LAFC, their crosstown rivals and a modern MLS benchmark. They’re the second-favorites to host and win MLS Cup. Celebrities seem wholly unnecessary. A defeat could bring old doubts creeping back. For all the energy and optimism surrounding this team, the path to sustained success in MLS is rarely linear. Still, for Vanney and Kuntz, the bigger picture remains clear. “There's so much joy, and excitement, and energy in our building,” Vanney says. “And our players just cannot wait to come play, and run, and entertain.”",2024-11-21,0,0.65,0.35

Analyst Tera Roberts helps us sort through the mess!","With six teams on a bye in Week 12, fantasy football managers are presented with two major problems — they must trust the boom-bust players they’ve been avoiding and lean on the big-name players who have been letting them down week after week. This isn’t a week for the faint of heart. Playoffs are right around the corner, and this week’s choices could make the difference between playoffs or the consolation bracket. We’ll look at players from two perspectives this week — Big Names with Big Problems and Bye Week Booms. Heading into the season, I thought the Vikings would use Ty Chandler as a complementary back to ensure Jones wasn’t overused. Aside from the challenges of being a 29-year-old running back, Jones has never been a true workhorse. He’s been a back who produces as an RB1 within a committee. Instead of repeating this effective approach, the Vikings gave Jones significant volume. Through 10 games, Jones has logged 157 rushing attempts. If he continues at this pace, he’ll exceed his previous career high of 236 carries, which was way back in 2019. Earlier in the season, when his legs were fresher, Jones was explosive, efficient and effective. Over the past four games, he has struggled significantly, averaging just 3.5 yards per carry and 9.2 fantasy points per game in half-PPR formats. This is a sharp contrast to his first 10 games, where he averaged 4.6 yards per carry and 13.5 fantasy points per game. The Vikings realized the need for another back and traded for Cam Akers, who has logged 23 carries over the past two games. Will Jones make or break your lineup in Week 12? Akers has been predictably inefficient, but the team continues to give him volume, likely in hopes of alleviating the strain on Jones. Despite the addition of Akers, Jones is still seeing solid volume; he’s simply no longer capitalizing on it. This week, he faces an advantageous matchup against the Chicago Bears. While the Bears’ defense has been strong overall, they are clearly weaker against the run. Statistically, Jones should get a rushing touchdown in this matchup. Despite the struggles, Jones could break through and have an RB1 week. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Before we dive into any numbers, let’s call a spade a spade; Deebo Samuel Sr. has flat-out looked awful. It hasn’t been a season of perfect health for him, but that’s nothing new. Another common pattern for Samuel is his tendency to oscillate between good and bad seasons. After a terrible 2022, Samuel admitted he was out of shape and rebounded in 2023. Now, in 2024, it feels like we’re watching a repeat of 2022 — which, inevitably, means 2025 could be a bounce-back year, so make a note of that ... but we can’t wait for the 2025 bounce-back. We need Samuel now. Will Samuel make or break your lineup in Week 12? Samuel is a special talent and there’s still time for him to turn things around this season, but it’s tough to trust him right now. He has clearly taken a backseat to George Kittle and Jauan Jennings and has just two total touchdowns on the season. This week, Samuel faces a Green Bay defense that has generally been strong against the pass. On one hand, this is a good opportunity to take advantage of his rushing upside. On the other, it’s difficult to believe he’ll provide strong receiving production this week. Samuel is, yet again, a risky flex play with bust potential. If you’ve read my articles before, you’ll know I’ve been pleasantly surprised with Pollard for most of the season. Unlike Samuel and Jones, Pollard has no issues with his performance, despite being in a terrible offensive situation. Weeks 1 through 9, Pollard was a respectable RB22 in average points per game in half-PPR, averaging 13.2 points. He ranked seventh in total carries and averaged a solid 4.4 yards per carry. However, much of his high volume earlier in the season was due to Tyjae Spears dealing with injuries. Over the past two weeks, with Spears active, there’s been a sharp decline in Pollard’s usage. Pollard has had just nine carries in each of the past two games and has failed to reach double-digit fantasy points. Will Pollard make or break your lineup in Week 12? The Titans have stated they want to reduce Pollard’s workload, perhaps out of concern for his long-term effectiveness. While this makes him wildly unreliable for fantasy purposes, there’s a potential silver lining. Spears is currently in concussion protocol, and if he’s unable to suit up, we could see the return of the old 20-30 touch version of Pollard. I have long-term concerns for Pollard in this offense, but if Spears is inactive, even with a less-than-ideal matchup, he offers RB1 upside. Aside from his Week 1 start, Worthy is coming off his best performance of the year. He recorded four receptions on five targets for 61 yards and a touchdown. What made this even more impressive was that it came against a stout Buffalo secondary. While Worthy has had similar performances earlier this season, this was the first week where he truly felt like the Chiefs’ WR1. He felt like the star — consistent and poised for more. It’s starting to feel like we could be on the verge of a rookie breakout in the second half of the season. Fantasy managers may understandably want to dive in headfirst, especially with a matchup against a seemingly good matchup in the Panthers. However, the Panthers haven’t allowed a receiving touchdown since Week 6 (to Drake London). Volume is still possible, but the Panthers’ secondary seems to be developing and trending in a positive direction. Will Worthy make or break your lineup in Week 12? I’m actually a bit hesitant to lean into Worthy given the matchup. Comparatively, the Panthers have allowed the 11th fewest fantasy points to opposing receivers but the most fantasy points to opposing running backs. If I’m predicting the Chiefs’ offensive approach to this matchup, pushing extremely high volume through the air doesn’t make sense. They’ll likely rely on their ground game, lean on their defense and limit Worthy’s involvement. He’ll likely see a maximum of five targets and will need a touchdown to have a productive day. Bateman is having the best season of his career, already surpassing his previous highs in receiving yards and touchdowns. Unfortunately, his leap in production hasn’t come with consistency. Calling it a lack of consistency might be underselling it. He can finish as the overall WR2 one week and WR78 the next. He’s a boom-or-bust player who is heavily touchdown-dependent due to a lack of volume. The good news is that Bateman’s boom games aren’t difficult to predict, as the Ravens’ offensive approach is fairly straightforward. Against weaker pass defenses, Baltimore tends to attack through the air and Bateman often thrives. His touchdowns this season have come against Dallas, both Cincinnati games and Tampa Bay — all defenses with clear struggles against the pass. Will Bateman make or break your lineup in Week 12? Bateman faces the Chargers who are very average against the pass, allowing the 16th most fantasy points to opposing receivers. Recently, they’ve been lit up by big-play receivers and even secondary receivers like Xavier Worthy and Calvin Austin III have had success against them. This matchup profiles as a strong opportunity for Bateman to deliver another big performance. It’s risky but he’s a high-upside bye week fill-in. Busted coverage or not, I’m ready to give Jim Harbaugh Coach of the Year purely for taking Quentin Johnston from arguably one of the worst receivers in the league to a shockingly usable fantasy asset. That said, it does feel a bit uncomfortable to fully lean into Johnston. A significant portion of his production has come from coverage breakdowns and it’s clear he still has some development to do. Will Johnston make or break your lineup in Week 12? Last week, Johnston caught two of his eight targets for 48 yards and scored a touchdown, delivering another solid fantasy outing. However, his fantasy value remains heavily reliant on touchdowns. He has three touchdowns this season and has finished inside the top 30 in those weeks. With Justin Herbert playing at an elite level, the Chargers have a beautiful matchup this week against the Baltimore Ravens — a game where Johnston could thrive. Johnston has legitimate flex value and with his boom-bust nature, could provide week-winning upside in Week 12.",2024-11-21,0,0.66,0.34

Scott Pianowski offers some help.,"Week 11 wasn't a perfect week with the sleeper page, no week ever is. Russell Wilson was a significant letdown and Audric Estimé didn't do much in Denver. But Taysom Hill and Jerry Jeudy smashed their projections, and Will Dissly was a strong play, too. We'll take that hit rate every time. Week 12 is probably the most challenging week of the fantasy season. It's not just the six teams on bye, but the quality of those collective rosters (Bills, Bengals, Falcons, Jets, Jaguars, Saints). You might be scrambling, and hopefully, we can help. Just remember, you'll probably need fewer points than usual to win your fantasy game this week. When the Chargers hired Jim Harbaugh, the team's identity immediately changed. Harbaugh brings a physical, run-focused nature to any roster he coaches, and it's been part of the success story this year. But don't mistake the LAC offense for some unit that deflates the ball and only passes out of desperation. The Chargers rank middle of the pack (19th, to be exact) in pass rate over expectation. It's not the Air Coryell Chargers, sure, but this isn't a leather-helmet offense, either. And now the Chargers host Baltimore, a good team that's struggled against the pass all year. The Ravens have given up the most fantasy points to wideouts this year, and it's not close. Johnston's development in his second year has been a fun story in Los Angeles. He's scored touchdowns in three straight weeks and he's coming off a season-best eight targets against Cincinnati. This is the week he graduates from the sleeper page and pushes his roster tag over 50%. I understand anyone's reluctance to believe in Will Levis. Most of his key passing metrics are well under the league average. But the Titans have a narrow passing tree, and since the DeAndre Hopkins trade, Westbrook-Ikhine has been a key part of that tree. Westbrook-Ikhine has touchdowns in five of six games, and while the early part of that run was a series of short touchdowns, he's also shown he can get downfield (consider last week's 98-yard catch and run). And it's important to recognize that Westbrook-Ikhine rarely comes off the field now; he's logged a 94% snap share since Hopkins was traded. Houston's secondary also presents a plus matchup for opposing wide receivers. We saw last week that Anthony Richardson's return was nothing to fear — the second-year quarterback was excellent in the comeback win over the Jets. And Richardson and Pierce have shown rapport all year — Pierce has a solid 60% catch rate on Richardson targets this year, and his average reception from Richardson is over 20 yards. The Colts are going to take deep shots. The Lions defense has quietly become one of the best units in the league — it's not just Ben Johnson's high-flying offense sparking the Detroit revival. But the Lions are down two critical members of the defense (pass-rushing ace Aidan Hutchinson, star linebacker Alex Anzalone), and Detroit has actually allowed the seventh-most points to opposing wideouts on a weekly basis. Pierce can get home in this matchup. I'm surprised Dissly hasn't graduated from this column yet, but it's coming soon. He's the TE12 over the past five weeks, including a TE5 showing last week. He's in the Justin Herbert Circle of Trust. Explosive plays aren't part of the story here (9.5 YPC), but Dissly has a reliable catch radius. This pick is obviously predicated on Jake Ferguson's status — if Ferguson (concussion) can't go, Schoonmaker steps into a sizable role. We saw Schoonmaker return a TE10 finish in Week 2 when Ferguson couldn't play, and Schoonmaker collected 10 targets and six catches in an emergency spot last Monday. As a non-starter in Dallas, he's run plenty of reps with current QB Cooper Rush. Rapport matters. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. It's been a tricky year for running back sleepers, given the overall health at the position. But you might need some unusual picks for Week 12, so we trudge forward. Johnson has punched in five touchdowns as Chicago's regular goal-line back, and it's possible Johnson could need more touches this week with D'Andre Swift nursing a groin injury. Minnesota's defense is a horrible draw for the Bears, but if you play Johnson this week, you're gambling on some touchdown deodorant. Maye's fantasy profile isn't dissimilar to what Bo Nix was offering a month or so ago. There's a rushing backboard here, and Maye's passing has been better than expected, despite the ordinary supporting cast around him. The Miami defense is a bad draw, no ducking that. But Maye is a solid bet for resourceful running and passing volume, especially when you consider New England is a 7.5-point underdog in this spot — game script will probably help his fantasy bottom line. I know a lot of fantasy managers will be hesitant to go back here. Javonte Williams was great last week, Estimé was not, and Williams has the starting baton. But Sean Payton has made it clear this is a hot-hand situation, and as poorly as Estimé played last week, he still scooped nine touches by the end of the game. He carries similar equity into a game the Broncos should control, road favorites against the two-win Raiders. Estimé can't be seen as a fantasy floor play, but you can squint and see some upside.",2024-11-21,0,0.77,0.23

Fantasy basketball analyst Dan Titus reveals what you should do with them now that Barnes is about to take the court again.,"The three-ball has become arguably the staple of scoring in the NBA — so we figured we'd take some shots from way downtown, too. Here, fantasy basketball analyst Dan Titus will break down three things fantasy basketball managers need to know each week. Or, he'll break down multiple three-point pieces of advice, analysis and more — it just depends on how open he is From Deep. Fantasy managers got a pleasant surprise on Wednesday afternoon when Raptors beat writer Josh Lewenberg posted that Barnes practiced in full and was upgraded to questionable ahead of Thursday's matchup against the Minnesota Timberwolves on X. He'll wear goggles to protect his eye, but by all indications, we should see one of the most versatile fantasy players back in the mix. He has missed the previous 11 contests with a fractured orbital bone and in his absence, the Raptors distributed his workload between RJ Barrett, Jakob Poeltl and Gradey Dick. Now that Barnes is on the cusp of returning, what does this mean for that Raptors trio? The pros: Barrett's been playing the best basketball of his career. Unfortunately, he'll undoubtedly see less usage when Barnes re-enters the lineup. With Barnes off the floor this season, Barrett averaged 23.4 points, 6.5 rebounds and 6.8 assists with a career-best 31% usage rate. He has been inefficient, but the boost in assists and steals has helped him become a top-25 player in points leagues. The cons: Barrett and Barnes shared the court once this season, but when combining his numbers from last season with Barnes', Barrett saw a 24.6 usage rate while posting 20.6 points, 6.3 rebounds and 3.8 assists per game. It's not a significant drop-off, but the assists are less prominent. The efficiency, however, significantly improved with Barnes. Barrett shot 54% from the field and 40.1% from three with fewer turnovers. Final verdict: All this to say, Barrett remains a great option for points leagues, and fantasy managers might have a buy-low window emerging since most expect Barnes' return to drive Barrett's numbers down further. An efficient version of RJ is worth considering in 9-cat leagues. The pros: Speaking of career years, Poeltl is averaging 39 fantasy points per game this year. Kelly Olynyk's been out with a back injury, leaving the Austrian big man with minimal competition for frontcourt minutes. It's resulted in Poeltl playing 30-plus minutes a night, which is the most of his career. Poeltl is providing fantasy managers with steady volume as a rebounder and defender. Coming into this season, his best finish in 9-cat leagues was 71st. Poeltl is on pace to finish as a top-50 player now that he's put up nearly 19 points, 12 rebounds, 3 assists and 3 stocks per game sans Barnes. The cons: Poeltl's scoring will likely regress once Barnes returns, but the rebounds and stocks should stick. I see the argument in selling high, especially after witnessing what he's done over the last three games. Absurd work. Jakob Poeltl's last three games:30 PTS | 15 REB35 PTS | 12 REB25 PTS | 18 REBWhile averaging 71.9 FG% pic.twitter.com/nqFJgmwyuk — StatMuse (@statmuse) November 19, 2024 Final verdict: I'm not selling at this point, but his elite play will likely draw interest from contenders once the trade deadline rolls around. Either way, Scottie Barnes' return shouldn't impact Poeltl as much as RJ Barrett from a pure counting stat perspective. The pros: Coming into Thursday, the second-year pro hasn't endured much of a sophomore slump offensively. Dick's increased his scoring output by 10 points per game this season, going from 8.5 points a night to 18.7 points per game. He's been slightly more efficient this year, too. Dick's true-shooting percentage climbed from .545 to .563. Basically, he's become less accurate with more shot volume, but his ability to get to the line (4.3 attempts/g) and knock down 91% of his freebies counters the efficiency lost in the field. He's also making the most of his opportunities on offense. His 22% usage rate is solid, but Dick is averaging the highest points per touch of any Raptor playing at least 20 minutes. He's their best shooter in the mid-range and, with Barnes' playmaking back in the fold, we should see Dick get better looks from beyond the arc as well. The cons: While that all sounds promising, Dick scored 15.4 points per game with Scottie in street clothes compared to 12.6 points when Barnes suited up. The scoring is coming down. Another issue with Gradey is that he does little outside of scoring and 3s. He'll get 30-plus minutes, cool — but in four games playing alongside Scottie this year, Dick averaged 1.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists. He ranked as the 98th player in 9-cat leagues over that four-game sample, and while it's been up ever since, I don't see the upside if he's not contributing to more categories. Final verdict: Fantasy managers have been abandoning ship with Dick's rostership down by over 5% since Wednesday. While he's exceeding expectations, I support the decision to drop him in most points and 9-cat leagues.",2024-11-21,0,0.7,0.3

If you like what you see, you can subscribe for free here. On Tuesday morning, when you launched your league homepage to scope out this week’s lineup decisions, you probably recognized the terrible predicament NFL schedule-makers created for us.‌ Six different teams are on bye this week, none of which are irrelevant in fantasy. We will be without our Falcons, Bills, Bengals, Saints, Jets and Jaguars. Put another way: We are missing the overall QB2, QB4, RB3, RB4, RB6, RB8, RB14, WR1, WR4, WR5, WR9, WR10, WR21, TE6 and TE7, among other useful pieces. Just an absolute fantasy nightmare. It doesn’t have to be this way, of course. But who are we to tell the NFL how to handle its business? Our role is simply to help you manage around the chaos. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Whenever one of these mega-byes arrives — and another is ahead of us in Week 14, just so you know — it’s important to remember that amid the messiness, we can also find opportunity. Every active manager in your league placed multiple waiver claims this week, which of course means everyone in your league was dropping players. We happen to be in one of those weeks in which the second-wave of pickups might actually be better than the first. Here’s a partial list of players who took a significant roster-percentage hit in Yahoo leagues when waivers ran overnight on Tuesday, each of them dropped by over 3,000 managers: Kirk Cousins Aaron Rodgers Russell Wilson (ahead of a beatable matchup on TNF) Sam Darnold Keenan Allen Jaylen Waddle 👀 Cedric Tillman (the week’s most obviously bad drop decision) Darnell Mooney Rico Dowdle Travis Etienne Jr. (OK, this one brought sweet relief to the dropper) Tank Bigsby Jonathon Brooks (ahead of his regular-season debut!) Tyler Allgeier Jordan Mason Raheem Mostert Ray Davis T.J. Hockenson (no idea what this is about) Dalton Kincaid Jake Ferguson Kyle Pitts Evan Engram Tucker Kraft Detroit Lions D/ST (they get Indy this week and still have both Bears games remaining) So, yeah, it’s a pretty great week to dumpster dive. Every name above is either playable or stashable, depending on your league’s specific format. We just mass-dropped most of the premium backup running backs and almost 50% of the preseason top-12 tight ends.‌ If you haven’t made a regular habit of reviewing the mid-week drops … well, it’s certainly not too late to start. There’s never been a better time, in fact. When trade deadlines are behind us, often the best way to fill a roster need is by sifting through other people’s fantasy trash.",2024-11-21,0,0.77,0.23

Appearing on the ""SI Media with Jimmy Traina"" podcast, Magnus said of the 91-year-old Brown, ""I don’t think there’s a single human being that’s ever had a longer association with professional basketball.” “We are going to give Hubie one last shot on a game. He deserves that,” Magnus said. “We think the world of him. I think it’s absolutely remarkable the level he still calls games at age 90-plus … We’re going to honor Hubie this year during the regular season at some point to be determined and send him off in style."" After a short playing career, Brown entered coaching in 1955 at the high school level. After a decade, he moved up to the collegiate ranks as an assistant at William & Mary and Duke before joining the staff of a Milwaukee Bucks team in 1972 that featured future Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson. Brown earned his first head coaching job in 1975 with the American Basketball Association's Kentucky Colonels, who won the ABA Championship in his first season. Following the ABA-NBA merger, Brown was hired as head coach of the Atlanta Hawks. He was named NBA Coach of the Year in 1978 before being fired late in the 1980-81 season. Following the retirement of legendary head coach Red Holzman in 1982, Brown was hired by the New York Knicks. He coached parts of five seasons before being fired early in the 1986-87 season. After taking on broadcasting gigs in between jobs, Brown became a regular on television following his dismissal from the Knicks. He joined the NBA on CBS coverage until the league's media rights moved to Turner Sports in the early 1990s. In 2002, 16 years after his last NBA coaching job, Brown, at age 69, was hired by the Memphis Grizzlies after Sidney Lowe was dismissed following an 0-8 start. The next season, his first full one in charge, the Grizzlies improved by 22 wins with a 50-32 record and made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. That success led to Brown being named Coach of the Year for a second time. Brown's tenure in Memphis wasn't for long. Twelve games into the 2004-05 season he resigned, citing medical reasons. Out of coaching again, Brown was hired by ABC for their NBA coverage and called the 2005 and 2006 NBA Finals. He's been a part of ABC/ESPN telecasts ever since. For his contributions to the sport, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2005 as a contributor. He's also a part of the College Basketball Hall of Fame and National Sports Media Association Hall of Fame. It hasn't been an easy past six months for Brown. In June, his wife, Claire, passed away at age 87. His son, Brendan, died earlier this month due to health complications at age 54.",2024-11-21,1,0.24,0.76

SANTA CLARA — Quarterback Brock Purdy appeared to experience discomfort in his right shoulder as he threw some passes before the start of 49ers practice on Thursday. San Francisco's head athletic trainer, Dustin Little, was seen rubbing Purdy’s throwing shoulder. Then, Purdy left the field before the start of practice. Purdy’s status for the 49ers’ critical Week 12 game against the Green Bay Packers appears to be in question due to the condition of his right shoulder. Backup quarterback Brandon Allen would get the start if Purdy were unable to play. Purdy took part in limited practice on Wednesday, but did not throw any passes during the warm up periods in which reporters were allowed to observe. Coach Kyle Shanahan expressed optimism on Wednesday that Purdy would be able to play against the Packers when asked about his level of concern. “Not much right now,” Shanahan said. “We’ll see how this week goes. But he is limited today, so I think that's good news.” Purdy has started all 10 games for the 49ers this season. He is completing 66 percent of his pass attempts for 2,613 yards with 13 touchdowns and eight interceptions. He also has run the ball 51 times for 267 yards, with a team-leading four touchdowns on the ground. In 16 games last season, he rushed for 144 yards on 39 attempts. Allen, 32, has made just nine starts in his NFL career. His last start was in the final week of the 2021 season, when he completed 15 of 29 pass attempts for 136 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions for the Cincinnati Bengals in a 21-16 loss to the Cleveland Browns.

Dalton Del Don attempts to identify misleading numbers that are worth a closer look. Yes ... The Numbers Do Lie. Stafford has averaged nearly as many fantasy points (14.3) this season as Daniel Jones (14.2), who’s been moved possibly to QB4 on New York’s depth chart. But Stafford’s fantasy rank is misleading, as he’s a weekly top-12 QB when the Rams are healthy. Stafford has averaged 296.4 passing yards, 2.2 TDs and 19.0 fantasy points (~QB7) in games with Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua this season; he’s averaged 215.0 passing yards, 0.4 TDs and 8.9 fantasy points (~QB40) without them (h/t FTN). And Nacua was ejected from one of those games early. Stafford is also due for touchdown regression. He ranks sixth in red-zone passes and leads the league in end-zone targets (33) but is tied for 12th in TD passes. Stafford is the QB13 in expected fantasy points despite being the only quarterback in the league without a single scramble. The Rams have the fourth-highest neutral pass rate over the last month and have passed on 63% of their red-zone plays since Kupp and Nacua returned. Unfortunately, difficult matchups will remain a hurdle. After having the league’s fifth-hardest QB schedule up until now, L.A. has the sixth-toughest rest of season. The Rams get an especially tough matchup this week against an Eagles defense leading the NFL in EPA/play over the last six weeks while shutting down opposing passing attacks. Still, Stafford looks like a top-12 QB down the stretch if Kupp and Nacua can stay healthy. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Taylor has averaged 10.3 (half-PPR) fantasy points (RB30) in two games with Joe Flacco this season, but he’s averaged 15.7 fpg (RB8) while scoring all five of his touchdowns in six games with Anthony Richardson. AR made a triumphant return last week, and he’ll remain Indianapolis’ starter over the rest of the season, health permitting. Taylor has handled 100% of the Colts’ RB rush attempts in three of the last four games, and he’s due for touchdown regression; Taylor has the third most carries (13) inside the 5-yard line (despite missing three games), but he’s tied for 15th in rushing scores. Taylor gets a tough matchup this week against a Lions’ defense that ranks second in EPA/play, but his schedule eases up afterward. Indy’s offense has experienced far more success (especially rushing and on early downs) with Richardson starting this season, so Taylor will benefit from the move back to the young quarterback. McConkey ranks No. 11 out of 120 pass catchers in ESPN’s Receiver Score, and he’s 13th in the league in first downs per route run. The Chargers have posted a positive DBOE in four of six games since their bye, and Justin Herbert is playing fantastic. While Joshua Palmer has failed to step up, McConkey saw a career-high nine targets last week and was among the league leaders in air yards. He gets a prime matchup this week against the league’s top pass-funnel defense; the Ravens rank 28th in EPA/dropback but second in EPA/rush. After matchups filled with low-scoring games and the league’s fourth-toughest WR schedule, the Chargers are set to play numerous shootouts and have the sixth-easiest WR schedule moving forward. More red-zone targets would be preferable, but McConkey is legit, and more volume down the stretch will lead to bigger fantasy production. Harrison Jr. hasn’t been a bust, but he’s been a disappointment while averaging fewer fantasy points than Quentin Johnston. Harrison Jr. started to finally run more crossing routes before Arizona’s bye, and hopefully, MHJ gets the proverbial rookie bump coming out of it. Harrison Jr. ranks seventh in air yards share (41.1%) and eighth in end-zone targets — tied with Ja’Marr Chase and CeeDee Lamb. Harrison Jr. has faced the league’s fifth-toughest WR schedule up until now (his QB has faced the toughest), but the rookie wideout gets the fourth easiest moving forward. Harrison Jr. has produced the second most fantasy points per route run against press this season, and he has four remaining matchups against defenses that use that coverage heavily (including this week versus the Seahawks). Kyler Murray got 9.1 YPA over his last three games before Arizona’s bye against three top pass defenses, so the Cardinals’ offense could score a bunch of points down the stretch. Harrison Jr.’s role should continue to rise just like his fantasy rank.",2024-11-21,0,0.83,0.17

McConkey had a rollercoaster of a performance in Week 11. He originally left his matchup against the Bengals with a shoulder injury. The injury appeared to be serious as he quickly went from the medical tent to the locker room. However, McConkey was able to return to the game and put up the best performance of his rookie season, finishing Week 11 with six catches for 123 yards on nine targets. All of these were season-highs, and he was relied on twice on the game-winning drive for gains of 28 yards and 27 yards. McConkey leads the team with a 24% target share, and he ranks 21st in yards per route run this season — strong numbers for a rookie. This week, McConkey will face the Ravens. Baltimore has been a fantasy wonderland for wide receivers all season, allowing the most receiving yards and fantasy points per game to opposing wideouts. McConkey is a must start this week and likely every week moving forward. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Robinson Jr. returned from a hamstring injury in Week 11 against the Eagles. Despite dealing with a knee and hamstring injuries over the past month, Robinson went back to operating as the Commanders clear RB1. He commanded 76% of the RB carries in this game which was his highest mark on the season. Robinson turned this usage into 72 total yards and a touchdown on 17 touches — a solid performance, especially when you consider he was facing the Eagles' No. 1 ranked defense according to PFF. But this week Robinson gets a much better matchup against the Cowboys. Dallas ranks 30th in run defense this season, and only the Panthers allow more rushing yards per game. In Week 11, Joe Mixon totaled 153 yards and three touchdowns against this Cowboys defense. Make sure Robinson is in your lineups this week. Flowers had a down game in Week 11 against the Steelers. He had just one catch for 23 yards until the Ravens final offensive play of the game where he caught a 16-yard touchdown. This saved his day as he finished with two catches for 39 yards and a score. Flowers also had two drops in this contest. It was an ugly day for him in a tough matchup against the Steelers' No. 3 ranked defense according to PFF. But despite the poor yardage total, Flowers still led the Ravens with a 22% target share in Week 11. He now leads the team in targets in nine of his 11 games this season. This week Flowers will get a matchup against the Chargers No. 4 ranked secondary. On paper, this looks like another tough spot for Flowers, but it might not be. The Chargers have allowed 104 yards per game to opposing No. 1 receivers over the past month of the season. Last week they gave up 148 yards and a score to Tee Higgins and 75 yards and two touchdowns to Ja’Marr Chase. This is a sneaky good spot for Flowers, who is a top-15 receiver this week. Keep him in your lineups. Williams and the Lions are coming off an offensive explosion in Week 11 against the Jaguars. The Lions put up 52 points and scored on all eight of their drives until kneeling the ball out on their final drive. Williams contributed to this big day on offense with a season-high 124 yards and a touchdown on six targets. This was the most usage Williams has seen since Week 2, and it was his best fantasy day since Week 1 against the Rams. Week 11 was a perfect matchup for Williams against a weak Jaguars secondary, but Week 12 may be even better. Williams will face the Colts this week who allow the seventh most receiving yards per game and the fourth most yards to opposing outside receivers this season. The Vegas total for this game is 50.5 points — the seonc highest on the week. Expect plenty of points for the Lions and Williams once again. Start Williams this week. White returns from his bye week and gets one of the best RB matchups you can find, taking on the Giants who allow the most rushing yards per play this season according to NFL Pro. But it gets even better because the Bucs are 6-point favorites this week against the Tommy DeVito-led Giants. There’s an increased chance Tampa plays with a lead which may fuel more rush attempts for Rachaad White and Bucky Irving. Before the bye week, White was operating as the lead back in all key situations for Tampa. White handled 100% of the goal-line snaps and 100% of the two-minute offense snaps in Week 10. Since returning from injury in Week 7, White is averaging 16.6 fantasy points per game and has scored a touchdown in every contest during this time. Expect the good times to continue against the Giants this week; White is a must-start in Week 12 with six teams on bye.",2024-11-21,1,0.48,0.52

We're gonna get another dose of divisional action tonight, as the 8-2 Pittsburgh Steelers travel to Ohio to take on the 2-8 Cleveland Browns. Now, the last few divisional matchups we've had on TNF have been pretty good for fantasy football purposes, so we have to hope this one doesn't turn into your typical AFC North (or rather, Steelers-specific) rock fight, where only the kickers and punters seem to have a day (looking at you, Chris Boswell). Let's go to the tale of the tape. As alluded to in the intro, the Steelers thrive in games that feature tough running, even tougher defense and a final score that looks more like a hockey game than a football one (okay fine, I'm exaggerating, but when you're invested in fantasy prospects, the Steelers aren't the best draw for your players). This style of play isn't exactly conducive to opposing receivers. Let's just look at the results of some high-profile pass-catchers facing Pittsburgh this season: Drake London (2-15) Courtland Sutton (1-26) Quentin Johnston / Ladd McConkey (combined 5-88-1) Michael Pittman Jr. / Josh Downs (combined 14-195-1) CeeDee Lamb (5-62) Brock Bowers (9-71) Garrett Wilson / Davante Adams (combined 8-91) Malik Nabers (7-71) Outside of the Joe Flacco mid-game eruption, the Steelers have, for the most part, kept opposing receivers in check, especially as the names and resumes have gotten brighter. But let's look at things from the context of this game specifically. The Steelers should defeat the Browns handily, as the better team. But we cannot ignore a major factor: Jameis Winston. Winston has been everything fantasy managers dream of: his usual gunslinger self, lifting the ceilings of every pass-catcher on the Browns, no matter the matchup or situation. The Browns have also been incredibly pass-heavy since Winston took over; whether that's because they know the pass game gives them the best chance to win or because they realize Nick Chubb will not return to form this season. Nonetheless, Winston's chuck-it nature has revitalized David Njoku, Cedric Tillman, Jerry Jeudy and Elijah Moore. Njoku, Moore and Jeudy had great games last week even though the Browns eventually fell, 35-14. Sure, the Saints' injury-battered defense pales in comparison to the Steelers', but with Cleveland adopting a pass-first (and then when the pass fails, pass again) mindset, these pass-catchers should all get their chances in this game. I am most worried about Tillman, who will likely get targets but will also be followed around by Joey Porter Jr.. So, while I expect more catches than last week, Tillman's ceiling might be capped. Thankfully, Winston is no stranger to spreading the ball around. I'm starting all of Tillman, Njoku and Jeudy, and I'm considering Moore in deep leagues. Now let's just hope the weather permits the pass — it's looking like rain during the game. It seems like ganging up on Najee Harris has been more common than singing his praises. He's too slow, he has no electricity in his runs, he has to share the load with Jaylen Warren, he doesn't catch passes. Blah, blah, blah. All Harris has done since Week 6 is produce. Even last week, when he was held under 70 rushing yards, Harris still collected 93 total yards thanks to four catches. As Matt Harmon has said this season, Russell Wilson has been a ""touchdown or checkdown"" quarterback (last week both Harris and Warren caught four passes apiece) in the context of the Steelers' run-heavy, play-action-pass offense. Basically, even in tough matchups, Harris has a safe floor and solid ceiling. He comes into this game riding a streak of a touchdown or 90 total yards in five straight games. Expect the streak to continue tonight. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Mike Williams joined the Steelers and immediately caught one pass for a deep touchdown. Basically, his bread-and-butter. And it's a skill that works well with Russell Wilson's deep-ball strengths. Of course, in his second game as a Steeler, Williams didn't receive a single target, putting up a big fat zero for deep-leaguers who took a chance on the big-play receiver in a plus matchup. Williams is rostered in just 16% of leagues, down 4% from last week, which is understandable. But I'd keep him stashed on the bench if you can — it's not out of the realm of possibility that Williams settles into the boom-or-bust MVS role, with the occasional 3-120-1 explosion. That likely wouldn't change the outlooks of George Pickens or Harris. Williams was fighting a losing battle in a crowded Jets' offensive-weapon room. But there's space for him to thrive on this Steelers team, with the way it's constructed and the way the offense likes to play. I'm remaining cautiously optimistic about the addition; if he can produce a big play or two in a plus matchup tonight, I'm adding him off the waiver wire. You're probably reading the above header and thinking one of two things: 1) ""Who cares about a non-top-10 TE?"" or 2) ""I'm not benching a starting tight end, not when Kyle Pitts, Dalton Kincaid, Evan Engram and Taysom Hill are on bye."" And I understand both sentiments. It's not fun for me, either. But the same way you're probably thinking one of those two things, you also need to understand two more things. 1) Pat Freiermuth (54% rostered) has seemingly been phased out of the Steelers offense save for the occasional short pass down the middle or scramble-drill red-zone target — he hasn't surpassed the three-target mark in any of his last six games, and 2) the Browns have utterly silenced opposing tight ends this season. Don't let the green on your fantasy app fool you — if you have a better option at TE this week (maybe you landed Will Dissly or Jonnu Smith or Zach Ertz or want to go deep with Ja'Tavion Sanders), fire 'em up.",2024-11-21,1,0.4,0.6

During McVay’s first seven seasons, Snead often observed McVay in the coach’s office, busily scheming plays. Reading motivational books. Meeting with coaches, players and team executives. So Snead was shocked last August when he witnessed something totally unexpected: McVay making faces and cooing baby talk on a video call. “Of all the things I thought I would see Sean McVay do,” Snead said, “that was not on the list.” On Oct. 24, 2023, McVay and wife Veronika welcomed a newborn son, Jordan John McVay. Read more: NFL Week 12 picks: Rams-Eagles and Chargers-Ravens ... who's ready for prime time? It was the latest personal milestone for McVay, who became the youngest coach in modern NFL history when owner Stan Kroenke signed off on making him the Rams’ on-field leader. NFL fans since have watched McVay literally grow up on the sideline while leading the Rams to five playoff appearances, two Super Bowl trips and a Super Bowl title to end the 2021-22 season. McVay, 38, also has come of age off the field. McVay and Veronika married in June 2022. The next season, as the Rams and McVay suffered through the worst Super Bowl hangover in history, McVay contemplated stepping away from coaching. But the impending birth of his son, and the opportunity to serve as an example of persevering through hard times, factored into his decision to return. Being a husband, and a father to Jordan, McVay said, has given him “real purpose” off the field. Also on it. “I definitely think it does make you a better coach,” he said. At the 2017 NFL owners meetings, a reporter asked Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll how he thought McVay would fare with the Rams. Carroll, a grandfather well into his third stint as an NFL head coach, said there was no question that the bright and knowledgeable McVay would excel. The challenges, Carroll noted, might come off the field because nearly all NFL coaches start families as college or pro assistants, before they ascend to the top job. McVay would navigate that path with the weight of an entire pro football organization on his shoulders. One year into fatherhood, McVay is managing fine.

McVay said his late grandfather John, a former NFL coach and longtime executive for the San Francisco 49ers, his father Tim and uncles Jim and John set great examples as fathers and mentors. So did former Rams defensive coordinator Raheem Morris, other current and former assistants and players such as former Rams offensive lineman Andrew Whitworth. “The way that they lead their families is unbelievable to me,” McVay said. Morris, now the coach of the Atlanta Falcons, became a father in 2010 before his second season as coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Morris, who worked with McVay at Tampa Bay and also in Washington before joining McVay’s Rams staff in 2021, often told McVay that becoming a father changes what happens when coaches cross the threshold of their home or greet family after a game. “You’re teaching your kids a lesson from that point on,” said Morris, who has three children. “Even when they’re at Jordan’s age, and you come in the house and you see those eyes looking at you, it’s a different deal. “You realize why you’re doing it and what you’re doing it for. And everything else is secondary when you look at those kids in that moment.” Whitworth, a father of four, signed with the Rams in 2017 and played until 2021, when he was 40. Being a father has provided the obsessively goal-oriented McVay something new to “chase,” Whitworth said. Read more: Rams tackle Andrew Whitworth on playing at 40: 'It's pretty wild' “He’s got a chance to look at Jordan every day and look at Veronika and say, ‘I would love to freak out about how practice went today, I would love to freak out about where we are as a team right now — that’s normally what I would do,’” said Whitworth, now a broadcaster for Amazon Prime. “‘But in this moment, I’m going to put Jordan in my lap and I’m going to have some perspective. … This is my priority and I want to be great at it.’” McVay and Veronika, who was born in Ukraine, met when McVay was an assistant coach in Washington and she was a student at George Mason University in Virginia. McVay spoke often about wanting to become a father, but actually becoming one “transformed” him in meaningful ways, amplifying qualities he already possessed, Veronika said. He is now more patient, empathetic, thoughtful and compassionate at home and at work, she said. “He prioritizes quality family time and being fully present even when he has those long days at the facility,” said Veronika, a real estate agent. “He’s just so excited to come home and see our little man. And Jordan always can put a smile on his face even on those toughest days.” In the offseason, McVay made it a point to be home in time to help put Jordan to bed. During the season, it is more of a challenge, but Friday nights and breakfast before home games are set aside for family time. “The things that he really cherishes in his life, the things that he loves — they’re not all in one basket anymore.” Rams receiver Cooper Kupp, on coach Sean McVay as a father And fatherly duties such as changing diapers. ""I've had some moments where I'm holding him, and you look down and you're like, 'OK, how did that end up on me?'"" McVay said, laughing. ""I get down and dirty with that."" McVay also prioritizes being present when working from his home office. “He comes in and out and says, ‘I need a mental break,’” Veronika said. Still, football is never too far from his mind. “Whenever he’s got an idea in his head, he’ll say, ‘I have to run back in there. I’ll be right back,’” she said, laughing. McVay’s parents see similarities in their son and grandson. McVay’s habit of being in constant motion dates to his childhood. “He was a busy guy,” his father said. So is Jordan, who often chases McVay in a rolling baby walker. “He’s very active like Sean, but he’s very chill like Veronika,” said McVay’s mother, Cindy, who paused a beat before laughing and adding. “And Sean was never chill.” In 2022, as the Rams stumbled to a 5-12 record, Rams executives watched McVay struggle to navigate the team’s faltering play. Afterward, with broadcast networks beckoning, McVay pondered taking a break from coaching. His son’s impending arrival led him to reconsider. “I never would have been able to look at him and say, ‘You know, when tough times hit, you push through it and grow from adversity,’” McVay said. “If I had run away from it, it would be, “Do as I say, not as I did.’” Last season, the Rams started 3-6 but McVay kept himself together. Jordan was born in the midst of the team’s second-half turnaround that resulted in a 10-7 record and a playoff berth. Fatherhood helped McVay balance that “kind of maniacal” sense that also makes him a great coach, Rams president Kevin Demoff said. “For someone who’s always searched for balance,” Demoff said, “this helps provide it in a much more natural way without searching.” Defensive coordinator Chris Shula has known McVay since they were college teammates at Miami of Ohio. They have coached together since 2017. McVay was always great around kids, said Shula, the father of two. But he did not have a true concept of fatherhood and taking care of a baby until he began to go through it himself. “He’s still getting here at 3 in the morning, so I don’t think it’s changed anything with the work ethic or the motivation,” Shula said. “But I think just the internal joy and doing it for others, I think that’s really what you see.” There also is external joy. “When he gets that picture texted to him or he’s on Facetime,” said offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur, a father of two, “it just instantly lights him up.” McVay’s enthusiasm while sharing video of his son apparently rivals his excitement when evaluating and discussing a top draft prospect. “He loves being able to say, ‘Look how wired this guy is!'” Snead said. “‘Look how alert he is. Look how intense, urgent, enthusiastic and passionate he is.’ “It’s really cool.” Throughout the first 15 years of his coaching career, McVay saw players not only as highly skilled athletes but also as developing men from a variety of backgrounds. His view further evolved when he became a father, Veronika said. “He sees them as young people who are navigating their own struggles and triumphs,” she said, “and he understands now in a way that only a parent can, that each kid out there has their own story and needs support in their unique ways.” Rams players, many of them also young fathers, noted subtle changes in McVay since he became a parent. “Something about his energy,” said safety John Johnson III, a father of a son. “His spirit is kind of different, kind of like he’s doing this for somebody, like he has more purpose. “I kind of feel that vibe.” McVay still pulls players aside for chats about their roles on the team. Or their assignments on the field. But now children also come into play. “I’m much more inclined to ask about those things,” McVay said, “because I’m now that dad showing the pictures and videos.” Read more: Rams-Patriots takeaways: With four TD passes, Matthew Stafford keeps breaking records Quarterback Matthew Stafford, a father to four girls, said “it’s football all the time” when the Rams are at work preparing for the season or opponents. But there’s also time to pause. “You can tell a story here or there of, ‘Hey, Tuesday afternoon I was playing goalie at my girls’ soccer practice … and my girls were yelling at me because I was afraid of the ball or something,’” Stafford said. “His son isn’t old enough to quite do some of those things, but I know he enjoys sharing stories back on what’s going on at home, which is cool to see.” Receiver Cooper Kupp began his Rams career the same year as McVay. Kupp, a father of three, said there is no mystery why McVay enthusiastically shares fatherhood experiences. “The things that he really cherishes in his life, the things that he loves — they’re not all in one basket anymore,” Kupp said, adding, “That helps give you perspective, and levels you out a little bit.” Players who do not yet have children also have heard McVay weave fatherhood into his coaching role. Occasionally, he references lessons passed down to him by his father. “He’ll kind of mention like, ‘My dad used to say …,’” defensive lineman Kobie Turner said. “He takes a lot of what he’s learned from real life and what it seems like he learned from his father and applies it. “He often tries to relate to the guys in the room and talk about how he’s trying to be the best version of himself, not only for us as a team but also like, he’s a dad now.” Last month, McVay reached another milestone. The Rams defeated the Minnesota Vikings at SoFi Stadium to give McVay his 80th victory, moving him past the late John Robinson as the winningest coach in Rams history. McVay achieved the feat on his son’s first birthday. “That was the coolest,” McVay said, “and felt like a little God-wink right there for you. That was pretty special.” Read more: All his players say it: 'John Robinson was hands down my all-time favorite head coach' McVay’s parents said it also has been special to watch their son grow. “For being so hard charging and driven, I believe he’s worked even harder on taking care of himself for this,” Tim said. “And that makes him a better overall dude at the office and in coaching.” And at home. Watching her husband embrace fatherhood has been “a gift,” Veronika said. “It’s changed his perspective on some things in the best way possible,” she said, “and I think he’ll just keep growing from that.” The McVays know there will be challenges ahead. As children get older, so do their opportunities for activities in sports, music and other areas. Cindy McVay speaks from experience. “He’s going to have to figure out some things when Jordan starts his own sports,” she said. “You really don’t want to miss that kind of stuff, so that’s all going to be kind of a learning thing.” McVay is not looking too far ahead. Whether asked about his personal situation or his team’s chances of making the playoffs, he often speaks about “being where your feet are.” McVay’s are happily planted with his wife and son. “It’s a love you can never know,” he said, “until you have it.” Get the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.

The Golden State Warriors announced Wednesday night that Melton will undergo season-ending ACL surgery. De'Anthony Melton injury update: pic.twitter.com/D9Vy3Wkx0p — Warriors PR (@WarriorsPR) November 21, 2024 Melton went down in the Warriors’ 120-117 win over the Dallas Mavericks last week, though it’s unclear exactly when he was hurt in that game. Melton, who was recently moved into the Warriors’ starting lineup, was then ruled out indefinitely with an ACL sprain in his left knee. Further testing in recent days determined that it would be in his ""best interest"" to have surgery rather than try to return to the court this season. Melton will now do that in the coming days. Melton joined the Warriors this past offseason on a one-year, $12.8 million deal after spending the past two seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers. He averaged 10.3 points and 3.3 rebounds in six games with Golden State. He put up 16.5 points and seven rebounds per contest once entering the starting lineup. The 26-year-old missed five games with a lower back strain, too. Though Melton should be ready to go for the start of the 2025-26 campaign, it’s unclear where he’ll end up. Melton will be a free agent this upcoming summer. While he looked solid for the Warriors early this season, the team may not be willing to sign him to another deal, especially with him coming off of an ACL injury. Melton was selected in the second round of the 2018 NBA Draft, and he spent time with the Phoenix Suns and Memphis Grizzlies before landing in Philadelphia. The Warriors entered Wednesday night’s game against the Atlanta Hawks with a 10-3 record, which has them in a slight lead in the Western Conference standings. They are undefeated after two games and are leading their group in the NBA Cup. The Warriors will take on the New Orleans Pelicans next on Friday in their third in-season tournament game.",2024-11-21,1,0.31,0.69

Middleton is still working to “feel physically ready” to make his season debut with the Bucks after he underwent a pair of ankle surgeries this past offseason, according to ESPN’s Shams Charania. Middleton has increased his on-court activity in recent weeks and participated in three-on-three play in practices, but he’s still not back to full participation. While the team is supportive of Middleton, his absence has been longer than many inside the organization expected it to be, per the report. It’s unclear when Middleton will make his debut with the team this season. The Bucks hope that he can participate in full scrimmages before he plays in a real game. ""He's looked good,"" Bucks head coach Doc Rivers said on Wednesday, via ESPN. ""He's working his butt off. Listen, I think he's close. And he's just going to keep working. This is the best I've seen him, I will say that."" Middleton averaged 15.1 points and 5.3 assists per game last season, his 11th with the Bucks. The three-time All-Star shot better than 49% from the floor last season. Middleton, however, has played in just 88 regular-season games since the start of the 2022-23 campaign due to various injuries, and he’s appeared in only 15 games under Rivers since he was hired to take over the team in January. The Bucks could use Middleton. They entered Wednesday’s game against the Chicago Bulls with a 5-9 record. While they have won three of their last four, the Bucks lost six of their first seven games of the season. Middleton will undoubtedly make a big impact for Milwaukee once he’s on the court again.

Terrell Owens did not mince words when dissecting Deebo Samuel's 2024 NFL season with the 49ers. In a campaign that the veteran wide receiver himself deemed the ""most frustrating"" of his six-year career, both Samuel and the 49ers' performance on the field has not lived up to expectations. And that includes the expectations of the Pro Football Hall of Fame wide receiver, who discussed Samuel's performance this season with 95.7 The Game's ""The Morning Roast"" on Thursday. ""Deebo is not really playing up to Deebo's standards,"" Owens told Bonta Hill and Joe Shasky. ""Deebo, it seems like he's more focused on his pregame attire than he is actually the game. So again, if we can shift that focus, maybe that can energize and create some more production from an offensive standpoint. Just kind of tongue in cheek with that."" While Owens clarified that his remark about Samuel's attire was tongue-in-cheek, he clearly does not believe the 49ers wide receiver's performance has lived up to expectations. In nine games this season, Samuel has 33 receptions for 490 yards and one touchdown through the air, while rushing 27 times for only 79 yards (2.9 yards per attempt) and one touchdown on the ground. The self-proclaimed ""wideback"" has not been nearly as effective as a dual-threat weapon this season as in years past, and even with star wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk sidelined for the remainder of the season, Samuel, on the season and in some games, has been San Francisco's third option in the passing game behind receiver Jauan Jennings and tight end George Kittle. In the 49ers' Week 10 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Samuel had the fourth-most receiving yards behind Jennings, receiver Ricky Pearsall and running back Christian McCaffrey. Samuel still has seven games to turn his 2024 season around, and the struggling 49ers certainly would benefit from a return to form. Download and follow the 49ers Talk Podcast",2024-11-21,1,0.47,0.53

But Johnson also doesn't want to call too many passes after the game is already in hand, for sportsmanship reasons. ""I think it's invaluable for him, going out there, you've got the lights shining on you, you've got people looking at you, it's not practice setting,"" Johnson said of Hooker playing in games.

TSN's Pierre LeBrun reported the Bruins will give Sacco a legitimate chance to become their full-time coach. He indicated they don't intend to start searching for a new bench boss and haven't reached out to any available candidates. Meanwhile, some observers are proposing new coaching destinations for Montgomery. The Hockey News' Adam Proteau suggested the Detroit Red Wings, Nashville Predators, and Pittsburgh Penguins. Meanwhile, The Athletic's Fluto Shinzawa included the St. Louis Blues and Montreal Canadiens on his list. Related: Three NHL Teams That Should Consider Hiring Jim Montgomery Those five teams are off to disappointing starts, putting varying degrees of heat on their current bench bosses. On Nov. 16, Detroit Hockey Now's Bob Duff observed the Red Wings' lifeless 4-1 loss to the Los Angeles Kings on Saturday. He wondered if coach Derek Lalonde needed a win on Monday against the San Jose Sharks to retain his job. Evidently not, as the Wings got a point in a 5-4 overtime loss to the Sharks. Lalonde's future could depend on the Wings' performance over the next six games, five of which are at home starting Thursday against the New York Islanders. A string of losses there could grease the skids for Lalonde's departure. Meanwhile, Jason Mackey of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wondered how long it'll take for Penguins ownership to drop the axe on coach Mike Sullivan. Mackey doesn't consider Sullivan a bad coach but believes the players are unwilling or unable to execute his orders, suggesting they've tuned out their long-time bench boss.

The Hockey News' Rob Couch cited reports claiming Trotz is rigorously searching the trade market for centers. As for the Blues, coach Drew Bannister said his slumping club must find ways to win games. His injury-depleted lineup could give him a longer leash than Lalonde, Sullivan, or Brunette. The Blues have three regular defensemen sidelined – Torey Krug, Nick Leddy and Philip Broberg.

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games","Juan Soto Watch: Top suitors, contract projections, latest news and rumors regarding top MLB free agent",https://sports.yahoo.com/juan-soto-watch-top-suitors-201930778.html,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 20:19:30 GMT","The Yankees, Mets, Dodgers, Red Sox, and Blue Jays are among the favorites to land the generational talent.","Juan Soto has dominated the first few weeks of the MLB offseason, and he deserves to do so. Excluding Shohei Ohtani, he’s the most highly sought-after free agent since Alex Rodríguez more than 20 years ago. Like A-Rod, Soto debuted as a teenager. So, he is hitting the open market having just turned 26 years old. That alone makes him a unicorn. Also, he’s had one of the best starts to a career ever. Among players who had played at least 500 games before turning 26, Soto has the third-highest on-base percentage (.421), is tied for the fifth-most home runs (201), and has the seventh-highest OPS (.953). He’s on pace to be a generational talent and this level of player changing teams is completely intoxicating. Below you'll find everything you need to know about Soto's market and where he might end up. Soto will break the proverbial bank this winter. Aaron Judge has the highest average annual value for a position player at $40 million. That feels like a paltry starting point for Soto. There was plenty of hoopla made over Ohtani’s $700 million deal last offseason, but with all of its deferrals the present-day value wound up around $460 million over 10 years. Those two deals will be the benchmarks for Soto’s contract. The question is whether or not he and his agent Scott Boras are dead set on trying to beat the public perception of Ohtani’s $700 million figure. That’s more possible than it may seem since Soto is so young and a team could be willing to offer him an unprecedented 15 or so year contract. Let’s just say 15 years at $45 million per year. That total value would come out to a jaw-dropping $675 million. That feels a bit rich. However, it’s hard to predict the competition of rivals on an open market or any deferrals that might be worked in. This whole situation could easily spiral out of control and the final dollar figure may be staggering. 2024 MLB Free Agency Tracker: Top players, newest signings, biggest contracts, best available, grades Where will Juan Soto, Pete Alonso, and Corbin Burnes sign this offseason?  D.J. Short , D.J. Short , Soto made it clear he would be willing to meet with “every single team” mere moments after the World Series ended. That should have made it extra-clear to the Yankees that there would truly be no frontrunner in this race. So, let’s run down who’s met with him so far. - New York Mets The Mets have emerged as the de facto frontrunners to sign Soto mostly due to Steve Cohen’s deep pockets. Their payrolls have been at or above $300 million for each of the last three years and crescendoed at $375 million in 2023 after the Mets’ last playoff berth. Cohen had the highest offer on the table for Yoshinobu Yamamoto last season before the Dodgers matched it and signed away the Japanese star. He’s already flown west to meet with Soto personally and there’s little doubt he will, once again, outbid the competition. That may be all it takes to woo Soto across town. - New York Yankees The Yankees presumably have the inside track after Soto spent the last year with them and reached the World Series with them. He seemed to revel in being a Yankee and Aaron Judge’s teammate. Those two were the best offensive duo in the league by far, which is a great selling point. He’s obviously declined their qualifying offer and reportedly needed assurances the organization was going to keep adding to their roster. Hal Steinbrenner said their initial meeting went well and that his Yankees were “in the mix” for Soto. - Los Angeles Dodgers No one wants to see this. It would be like Kevin Durant to the Warriors all over again. Yet, the Dodgers have taken an official meeting with Soto and have about $70 million of room under the final Competitive Balance Tax Threshold with gaping holes at corner outfield, middle infield, and in their rotation. Here’s to not spending all your money in one place, Dodgers. - Boston Red Sox Perhaps the Red Sox have learned their lesson after letting Mookie Betts walk out the door and don’t want to let another generational talent slip through their grasp – possibly to their biggest rival – without a fight. They have an elite farm system, enough money to make a serious offer, and took one of the first meetings with Soto. They should be considered a realistic destination. - Toronto Blue Jays Oddly enough, it was reported that the Toronto Blue Jays took one of the first meetings with Soto. They’ve struck out on every high profile free agent in the last few years despite being ‘considered’ by most of them. With deep pockets and a hint of desperation, the Blue Jays could find themselves in this race until the bitter end. - Philadelphia Phillies Jon Heyman of the New York Post reported Thursday that Soto likes the Phillies, though it's unclear if their scheduled meeting has actually taken place yet. Either way, Phillies president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski does not like losing and has been open about his willingness to shake up this roster and spend money after they were embarrassed by the Mets in the NLDS. - San Francisco Giants Aaron Judge left the Giants at the altar two offseasons ago and they’re another team that has been involved with plenty of marquee free agents without ever getting over the hump. Soto would be a serious splash for Buster Posey in his first year as the President of Baseball Operations, but they reportedly haven’t set up a meeting yet. - Chicago Cubs There has been no indication the Cubs are involved in the Soto Sweepstakes and that should sorely disappoint their fans. They spent the same percentage of their revenue on payroll as the Marlins and Mariners last season. That is not where this franchise should be if they are serious about competing for a championship. - The Tampa Bay Rays, apparently Jon Heyman reported a couple of weeks ago that the Rays reached out to Soto's reps, which elicited immediate giggles from the baseball public. They shouldn't be considered a serious suitor, and with the concern over the roof at Tropicana Field and their new ballpark maybe not working out after all, they have much bigger issues at the moment.",2024-11-21,0,0.59,0.41

NMcKeown said. 'And you can't have ""white people only"" come into my restaurant, and then you say, ""Well, no, we have a religious, spiritual nature to our restaurant, and when you get there, we serve you special food."" This seems quite different.' Olympus Spa was there appealing this decision from a lower court.  The right response to McKeown's inquiry is that it is correct to say that race and sex are inherent, immutable traits, which the law says cannot be discriminated against. That is the very definition of what makes them protected categories. If we agree that sex is an inherent, protected trait, then a traditional reading of all sexual protection laws suggest an appropriate separation of the two biological sexes in public and private venues, especially involving nudity. Instead of something logical like that with the thousands of case laws readily available, the lawyer goes down some weird trail about ""being welcome"" that the judge immediately shuts down as being the nonsense it is. Some reactions:     Will this case make it to the Supreme Court? Given the opinion Gorsuch delivered in R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes v. EEOC, I have my doubts.

I'll define ""genotoxic"" for you: Toxic (damaging) to DNA. Substances that are genotoxic may bind directly to DNA or act indirectly leading to DNA damage by affecting enzymes involved in DNA replication, thereby causing mutations which may or may not lead to cancer or birth defects. The study was carried out by researchers at the University of Western Australia, and was published in Addiction Biology. According to their findings, exposure to cannabis was associated with a range of cancers - breast, pancreatic, liver, thyroid, testicular and lymphoma - that also develop quickly and are more aggressive. In addition, links to birth defects were found, indicating that cannabis use could cause DNA mutations that pass on to children in utero. ""The link we've described between cannabis use and genotoxicity has far-reaching consequences,"" said Stuart Reece of the University of Western Australia, a co-author of the study. ""This new research shows how genetic damage from cannabis use can be passed down the generations."" Recreational marijuana use is legal in 24 states, 3 U.S. territories and the District of Columbia. While support for further legalization is gaining momentum, Reece added that he hopes the analysis ""reframes the discussion surrounding cannabis legalization from a personal choice to one that potentially involves multiple subsequent generations.""

This is the stuff they're hearing in the Illinois Supreme Court.   Yes, the convicted hate crime hoaxer, the man who has become known on both sides of the aisle as an actual joke, Jussie Smollett, is getting out of being punished for his crime. The 'Empire' actor was convicted in December 2021 of five felony counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly staging a hate crime against himself in 2019 and was sentenced to 150 days in county jail, plus 30 months of probation and $130,000 in restitution. This happened after the original charges against him were dropped in 2019. He was charged again after a special investigation and spent 6 days in jail before his sentence was suspended, pending appeal. In an opinion released on Thursday, the Illinois Supreme Court found that the special prosecutor's decision to retry Smollett violated his rights. Yeah, apparently the court is arguing that this was a case of double jeopardy and that he couldn't be tried again, even though he never stood trial for the original charges. Let this TV attorney explain the legalese:  'We are aware that this case has generated significant public interest and that many people were dissatisfied with the resolution of the original case and believed it to be unjust,' the court's opinion reads. 'Nevertheless, what would be more unjust than the resolution of any one criminal case would be a holding from this court that the State was not bound to honor agreements upon which people have detrimentally relied.' Yeah. He totally didn't get special treatment because of his celebrity or because he is a gay black guy or because his hoax was designed to stoke hate against Trump supporters. We all know the Illinois Supreme Court would TOTALLY do the same thing for a non-celebrity white guy who lied to paint Democrats in a bad light ... right?Good luck on tracking down the MAGA terrorists, Jussie.

After sparking, overseeing, and enabling a years-long unprecedented migrant crisis - despite Kamala Harris's famously deep understanding of the issue as border czar - they're doing their best to let as many illegal immigrants into the country as possible before they're forced to pack up their stuff and make way for Trump. According to The New York Post, the outgoing administration is rushing to loosen a bunch of immigration policies, with New York City the center of this particular chapter of insanity.  One bright idea is the launch of an ICE Portal app next month that will allow up to 100,000 illegal immigrants to skip in-person check-ins with ICE altogether. With reports that the software is ""glitchy and unreliable.""  Oh, and unlike in-person appointments, the app doesn't even check for criminal history or warrants for arrest. Again, what could possibly go wrong?!   Other policies being pushed under the radar include allowing illegal immigrants to push back against electronic tracking. Because when you're letting in tens of thousands of criminals with outstanding warrants, the last thing a sane government could want is the ability to know where those criminals are. It's obvious at this point we don't have a sane government. Instead, we have an insane government motivated by, as former acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan said, putting up ""as many roadblocks and obstacles and throw[ing] as many grenades as they can on their way out.""

Not only are they spending their time imposing sanctions on Israelis, funding Palestinian terrorists and trying their best to spark all-out-war in Europe, they're now focusing on the big bad wolf of Silicon Valley: Google. On Wednesday, Biden's Justice Department filed a 23-page manifesto asking a judge to rip apart Google's empire, including the sale of Google's Chrome web browser (you know, the one you're probably using to read this article) and to restrict Android phones from favoring Google's own search engine.  According to the DOJ, for the past decade, Google has been squashing competition. This follows a ruling in August by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that Google is a monopolist.  This is the first time in over two decades that a tech company of this size has been declared a monopoly. Ironically, the breakup of Microsoft in 2001 after years of court battles allowed for small startups like Google to seize control of the tech landscape in the aftermath.  Not only does the Justice Department want to stop Google from cutting multi-billion-dollar deals that make its search engine the default on every device - saving us the hassle of having to ask that idiot, Jeeves - they also want Google to open up its search data to rivals. (Because nothing builds competition like handing your competitors one of your biggest successes on a silver platter.) Regulators also want to ban Google from favoring its own products, like YouTube or its new AI platform, Gemini. Because in Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's America, self-promotion is just … not allowed. Right?  Google's legal team, led by Kent Walker, called the proposals ""radical"" and claimed they'd harm Americans and our global tech dominance. According to Walker, the DOJ's proposal would: Endanger the security and privacy of millions of Americans, and undermine the quality of products people love, by forcing the sale of Chrome and potentially Android. Require disclosure to unknown foreign and domestic companies of not just Google's innovations and results, but even more troublingly, Americans' personal search queries. Chill our investment in artificial intelligence, perhaps the most important innovation of our time, where Google plays a leading role. Hurt innovative services, like Mozilla's Firefox, whose businesses depend on charging Google for Search placement. Deliberately hobble people's ability to access Google Search. Mandate government micromanagement of Google Search and other technologies by appointing a ""Technical Committee"" with enormous power over your online experience. ""DOJ's approach would result in unprecedented government overreach that would harm American consumers, developers, and small businesses — and jeopardize America's global economic and technological leadership at precisely the moment it's needed most,"" Walker concluded. (Ironic that Google was the #1 corporate donor to Kamala's campaign though!) Follow Ian on Substack or X (@ighaworth).

The migrants are mainly from Central and South America. Some say they are hoping to reach the United States before Donald Trump's inauguration in January, saying they think it might be more difficult after that.  This comes after scumbag profiteers began urging migrants to begin packing for the border after Trump won:  But wait! I thought the U.S. government launched an ""app"" to help stem the tide of illegal migration into the country?  Per the AP: By extending the app south to Tapachula, officials hoped it would stem the rush north. But some migrants still want to be close to the border so that if they do get one of the cherished appointments, they can get to it quickly and not risk missing it. I think it's safe to say:

Look at that punk's smile.  This isn't his first arrest and he knows he will be back out again before long. Police say at about 2 a.m. Sunday he robbed a 38-year-old woman in the hallway of her Hell's Kitchen apartment building. He allegedly grabbed her purse, cell phone, and bank cards, and also performed a lewd act. The victim is a Manhattan Assistant DA, she is not injured. That lewd act: He exposed himself to her. I am happy she isn't hurt. However, I hope this helps open her eyes to just exactly what her and her boss's policies and actions are doing to people. They say that a conservative is someone who's been mugged by reality. We'll see if that happens here. The suspect is a migrant and police were able to track him down ... the suspect was using drugs on the street ... police believe he is part of Tren de Aragua ... he also has six prior arrests all from this year on similar crimes and he is believed to have arrived in the US in February of 2023. The man has been in the country for a year and he's been arrested in NYC SIX TIMES in 2024 for the same crimes over and over again. I don't know if we should criticize Bragg's soft-on-crime policy (which applies to everyone except Donald Trump and white Marines who try to save lives) or if we should criticize New York's sanctuary city policy.

Dude was going to blow up the New York Stock Exchange. Luckily, his plan was foiled by the FBI. Even though oftentimes I bash on them, they did their job here, and if they hadn't, who knows what would've happened. A Florida man [Muslim jihadi] was arrested Wednesday and charged with a plot to ‘reboot' the U.S. government by planting a bomb at the New York Stock Exchange this week and detonating it with a remote-controlled device, according to the FBI …  The FBI began investigating Yener in February based on a tip that he was storing ‘bombmaking schematics' in a storage unit. They found bomb-making sketches, many watches with timers, electronic circuit boards and other electronics that could be used for building explosive devices, according to the FBI. He had also searched online for things related to bomb-making since 2017, according to the FBI …In the last month, he had rewired two-way radios so that they could work as remote triggers for an explosive device and planned to wear a disguise when planting the explosives, according to court documents.

(Some free advice for you terrorists out there: Don't ever have a YouTube channel where you teach people how to build explosives.) Yener said he felt ""like Bin Laden."" From CBS 12: Yener planned to wear a disguise when he planted the explosive device outside the building and recorded a message to be delivered to the press about why he did it. The DOJ says Yener anticipated the impact of the explosion would be 'like a small nuke went off' and ""'[a]nything outside"" the building ""will be wiped out'"" and ""anything inside would be killed.'"" The undercover FBI employee gave a microphone to Yener for him to record his 'demand statement' that he intended to send to NBC News the day of or the day after the planned attack, where he said 'I feel like Bin Laden', according to documents. Another interesting tidbit from the AP because we live in a fascinating world with interesting mashups: He was also part of a small group that tried to join the far-right anti-government group the ‘Boogaloo Bois' and extremist group the Proud Boys but was denied membership because he said he wanted ‘to pursue martyrdom,' according to court documents.

	To celebrate Hubie Brown calling it a career, we looked back on how old he was during major events that happened in his lifetime.","Basketball fans are going to see broadcasts get a little worse sooner rather than later. That’s because Hubie Brown, the legendary former coach who has turned into a stalwart on ESPN’s coverage of the league, will only call one more game before he retires at 91 years old. “We are going to give Hubie one last shot on a game,” ESPN president Burke Magnus told Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated. “He deserves that. We think the world of him. I think it is absolutely remarkable the level in which he still calls games at age 90-plus. I don’t mean to be purposely mysterious here but we are going to honor Hubie during the regular season at some point to be determined and send him off in style.” That he is still capable of working at 91 is remarkable, but Brown is still sharp as a tack and as good as it gets calling basketball games, and while no one has deserved retirement more, it’s always a tough day when someone as highly-regarded as him calls it a career. There is, still, no one better at seeing something, pointing it out, and explaining why it’s a big deal than Brown, and he has terrific chemistry with his broadcast partners. We’re all going to miss Hubie, and to celebrate the end of his time in the booth, we wanted to celebrate him by having some fun and looking at everything he’s seen over his extraordinary life. You see, Hubie was born on Sept. 25, 1933, which means he has been around for, quite literally, every single game that the NBA has played — the league was founded in June of 1946, when he was 12 years old. That got us wondering: How old was he during some of the biggest moments in world, American, and NBA history over the last century or so? Let’s dive in. Start of WWII: 5 years old (Sept. 1, 1939)

	ESPN content president Burke Magnus explained that the network's biggest star ending up on its newest property is a bit tricky.","ESPN has about a year to figure out how it’s going to handle Inside the NBA. As part of Warner Bros. Discovery’s deal to remain in the NBA’s media ecosystem, it was announced that Turner will continue to produce Inside, but license it out to ESPN, which solves the network’s longstanding issues trying to put together a pregame, halftime, and postgame NBA show that viewers enjoy. An unsurprising question that popped up after this was whether Stephen A. Smith — who is in the middle of some high-profile contract negotiations with ESPN — would find a way onto the show. Smith is the guy ESPN has built its NBA coverage around, and while that has come under plenty of criticism, he’s famously close with the Inside crew and has appeared on it in the past. But apparently, as of now, the network doesn’t have any intetion of putting Stephen A. on their newest property. “We have no plans to do that,” ESPN content president Burke Magnus told Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated. “And that’s because, frankly, the construct of the deal really doesn’t — that’s not how it was conceived. What is conceived is that Turner, as they have always done with this show, with this cast, with the people involved behind the scenes, are going to continue to do what they’ve always done. And we’re going to distribute it on the ESPN platform. Frankly, that’s exactly what we want. We don’t want to change it. We don’t want to interject new talent into it. We don’t want to really do anything to it.” It is worth mentioning that the scuttlebutt around Smith’s contract negotiations revolves around him wanting to do more NFL stuff for ESPN, but considering how big Inside is and his relationship with the guys, it is fair to wonder if he’d want to have any sort of presence on the show as part of a new deal (if, of course, he comes to terms with the network on one). For now, the complexities of the deal with Turner gives ESPN a way to say they have no plans of putting him on Inside in any capacity, but we’ll certainly be waiting to see if that changes as Smith and ESPN sit down at the negotiating table.

(Credit: X /Bill Carl Johnson) Just hours after voting to finance repairs to the home stadium of the Tampa Bay Rays, the St. Petersburg City Council reversed course.  The Rays will now pay the division rival New York Yankees $15 million to play their home regular-season games at New York's spring training ballpark. That is now the only certain home the Rays will have until further notice.  The stadium's fiberglass roof was ripped clean off Oct. 9 when Hurricane Milton swept ashore just south of Tampa Bay. Then came the destructive water damage inside the venue, causing an estimated $55.7 million in damage. The extensive repairs cannot be finished before the 2026 season, city documents show. The city at least would have supplied some funding and started the process with its initial vote, which was a 4-3 decision.

Once that was done, crews would begin working on laying down a new baseball field and fixing damaged seating and office areas and a variety of electronic systems, which would require another vote to approve money for the remaining restoration. Members who opposed it said there wasn’t enough clarity on numerous issues, including how much would be covered by the ballpark’s insurance and what amount might be provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. TRUMP TO PRESIDE OVER HISTORIC SPORTING EVENTS — WHICH TEAMS AND STARS COULD SKIP WHITE HOUSE VISITS? The reversal on fixing Tropicana Field came after the council voted to delay consideration of revenue bonds for a proposed new $1.3 billion Rays ballpark. Just two days earlier, the Pinellas County Commission postponed a vote on its share of the new stadium bonds, leaving that project in limbo. ""This is a sad place. I’m really disappointed,"" council Chair Deborah Figg-Sanders said. ""We won’t get there if we keep finding ways we can’t."" The Rays say the lack of progress puts the new stadium plan and the future of Tropicana Field in jeopardy. ""I can’t say I’m confident about anything,"" Rays Co-President Brian Auld told council members.

""I’d like to pare it down and see exactly what we’re obligated to do,"" council member John Muhammad said. Several council members said before the vote on the $23.7 million to fix the roof that the city is contractually obligated to do so. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""I don’t see a way out of it.

The Philadelphia 76ers' front office bolstered the team's roster by adding Paul George and other key players in the offseason.  The addition of draft pick Jared McCain also contributed to high expectations the Sixers carried into the 2024-25 season.

He may not have broken his single-season home run record he set during his 2022 MVP season, but the New York Yankees captain was once again dominant at the plate to receive his second career nod as the MVP in the American League. Judge beat out Juan Soto, who he hopes to play with again in 2025 in pinstripes, and Kansas City Royals phenom Bobby Witt Jr., who received all 30 second-place votes. Judge led the league in homers for the third time in his career, launching 58 long balls while posting league highs in WAR (10.8), RBIs (144), slugging percentage (.701), on-base percentage (.458) and OPS+ (223).

It was eventually determined Ohtani did not know about the gambling, nor did he bet himself.

The home run ball that made history sold for a record $4.39 million. His 134 runs scored and 411 total bases were the most in the majors, and he led the National League in home runs (54), RBIs (130), on-base percentage (.390), slugging percentage (646) and a 9.2 bWAR.  His .310 average in the NL was second behind only Luis Arráez's .314, and his 59 stolen bases trailed only Elly De La Cruz, who swiped five more bags.

""Part of that wonderful tradition, celebrating the power of sports to bring people together. It’s a tradition that I’ve had the honor to continue. No matter the sport. What these champions all have in common are core values. … Hard work, teamwork, respect and the knowledge that no one of us is ever as good as all of us can be when we’re together,"" he said. After Biden's speech, he received a custom Celtics jersey and took a basketball with him as he walked down the stairs.

The 2023 champion Denver Nuggets did not attend a Biden White House visit, reportedly due to ""scheduling issues,"" the team previously told The Denver Post.  Prior to Thursday, the last NBA champion to visit Biden's White House was the 2021-2022 Golden State Warriors.

However, the only two teams to win the title under Trump prior to the COVID-19 pandemic were the Warriors, who Trump did not invite, and the Toronto Raptors, who are based in Canada.  Trump infamously declined to invite several major women's basketball championship teams to the White House during his first term, including every WNBA champion.  The Baylor women’s NCAA championship basketball team and their coach Kim Mulkey present President Trump with a jersey during a visit to the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., on April 29, 2019. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) The one time Trump's White House hosted a women's basketball team was the 2019 national champion Baylor Bears, led by former head coach Kim Mulkey.  The only two NFL teams to get invitations to Trump's White House during his first term were the New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles. The Patriots accepted both invitations in 2017 and 2019. The Eagles' visit was canceled, and the team released a statement saying it was in relation to Trump's stance on players standing for the national anthem. During Trump's first term, and even during his recent campaign, college football has been the sport to embrace him the most in the U.S. His appearances at games, including multiple Army-Navy games during his first term and a Georgia-Alabama game in September, were met with rousing applause. No college football national champion skipped a White House visit during Trump's first term. Georgia skipped a visit to President Biden's White House in 2023.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Trans volleyball player legal hearing opened with long and heated debate over what pronouns to use,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trans-volleyball-player-legal-hearing-opened-long-heated-debate-over-what-pronouns-use,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 16:33:52 -0500",The first 45 minutes of a hearing over a trans athlete&apos;s eligibility to play women&apos;s volleyball were dedicated to a debate on pronouns and identity.,"San Jose State University's women's volleyball co-captain Brooke Slusser says she is standing up for herself and her team on 'The Ingraham Angle' as sports journalist Michele Tafoya reacts. Who/what would have thought something so simple would take so long?  The athletic eligibility of San Jose State's volleyball team and trans athlete Blaire Fleming came under legal review on Thursday during an emergency hearing in Colorado. But it couldn't get started before a lengthy discussion on whether to use she/her pronouns when referring to Fleming.  Federal Judge Kato Crews, who was appointed by President Biden in January, dedicated the first 45 minutes of the hearing to a debate between the plaintiffs and defendants over what pronouns to use when describing Fleming and whether Fleming's name should be used during the hearing for the sake of privacy. Nearly an hour into the hearing, Crews declared that he would choose to use she/her pronouns, but that any other individual in the courtroom could use whatever pronouns they wanted to use. Crews also clarified that his decision to the she/her pronouns when referring to Fleming did not reflect his decision on what Fleming's biological gender is.  Crews also ruled that it was okay to use Fleming's name during the hearing.  ""While the court is not insensitive to the privacy issues ... the defendants have essentially affirmed there is a transgender player on the SJSU volleyball team,"" Crews said.  THE PRONOUN POLICE HAVE ARRIVED AND ARE COMING FOR YOU NEXT  Blaire Fleming of the San Jose State Spartans reacts during the second set against the Air Force Falcons at Falcon Court at East Gym on October 19, 2024, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  (Andrew Wevers/Getty Images) The verbal implementation of official pronouns when referring to individuals to avoid ""misgendering"" them has, in fact, been tied to legal repercussions in the U.S. in recent years.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) rolled out a new gender pronoun policy in November 2023. ""All applicants and employees should be addressed by the names and pronouns they use to describe themselves. Using correct names and pronouns helps foster workplaces free of discrimination and harassment,"" the U.S. Office of Personnel Management guidance states. ""This practice also creates an inclusive work environment where all applicants and employees are treated with dignity. The isolated and inadvertent use of an incorrect name or pronoun will generally not constitute unlawful harassment, but, as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has explained, continued intentional use of an incorrect name or pronoun (or both) could, in certain circumstances, contribute to an unlawful hostile work environment."" Heritage Foundation expert and former HHS official Roger Severino previously told Fox News Digital that the laws violate employee rights and will result in firings for ""misgendering."" SJSU WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL'S 1ST OPPONENT DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT TRASN PLAYER, SUGGESTS MATCH WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED Official and proper pronoun usage has been at the center of mockery and satire by right-wing figures in politics and media, including President-elect Trump, in recent years.  After liberal social media influencer and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. was discovered to have removed pronouns from her X bio after Trump's election win, the congresswoman became the subject of a viral mockery campaign by conservative and satirical users.  Former NCAA swimmer and OutKick contributor Riley Gaines didn't let Ocasio-Cortez off the hook in a tirade of insults on X on November 14.  ""How will we know what to call AOC now that her pronouns in her bio are gone?!"" Gaines wrote.  And thus, a hearing on the situation with Fleming and San Jose State, which has recently become a landmark event in the civil rights discussion around women's sports, fittingly included a pronoun debate for the ages.  The hearing came in response to a recent lawsuit filed against the Mountain West Conference for its policies on gender eligibility and identity. The plaintiffs, including multiple Mountain West volleyball players and Utah State University, contested the conference's policies that have let San Jose State player Blaire Fleming compete, despite being a biological male. San Jose State finished the regular season with a 14-6 record and a 12-6 conference record. Six of its conference wins came via forfeit by opposing teams amid the controversy. Those include forfeits from conference opponents Boise State, Utah State, Wyoming and Nevada. Wyoming and Boise State have each forfeited two matches against the Spartans.  The plaintiffs on Thursday were seeking to have the losses that those teams took for the forfeit be erased from their record and not counted against them in qualifying for the Mountain West Tournament. The plaintiffs were also seeking to prevent SJSU from rostering Fleming in any future games, including the upcoming tournament. Fleming has been one of the top players in the conference and an offensive anchor for San Jose State this season, even amid the controversy. Fleming is third in the conference in average kills per serve with 3.86 and amassed 297 total kills on the year despite playing seven fewer games than expected due to the forfeits. It's helped give San Jose State the third best hitting percentage in the Mountain West.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Blaire Fleming of the San Jose State Spartans attempts to block a shot during the first set against the Air Force Falcons at Falcon Court at East Gym on October 19, 2024, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  (Andrew Wevers/Getty Images) A Mountain West spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday that the conference is currently planning for San Jose State and Fleming to compete in the tournament in Las Vegas, starting November 27. That spokesperson also says the conference has a contingency plan in the event teams refuse to face San Jose State over Fleming's presence on the team.  That plan includes a willingness to recognize San Jose State as the conference champion if the Spartans advance to the final and win the match by virtue of forfeit from opponents.  ""If we get to a championship game, and it's San Jose State vs. whoever, if that institution forfeits the game, then San Jose State wins that match, and then they are tournament champions. And they would be the automatic qualifier out of the Mountain West,"" the spokesperson said.  However, Crews' eventual ruling could disrupt that plan and keep Fleming out of the tournament altogether. Crews concluded the hearing by saying he will deliver a ruling on the case in a ""timely fashion.""

Daniel Jones isn’t used to just sitting back and watching at New York Giants practices, but after being demoted coming out of the bye week, he understands his time as Big Blue’s franchise quarterback has come to an end after six seasons.  This certainly is not how Jones, the No. 6 overall pick of the 2019 NFL Draft, wanted his Giants tenure to end – a lost 2-8 season where his play has not justified him starting the rest of the year.  But head coach Brian Daboll made it official, with Tommy DeVito elevated into the starting role and Jones moved all the way back to QB4 with the team bringing in veteran Tim Boyle.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones during the Carolina Panthers game, Nov. 10, 2024, in Munich, Germany. (AP Photo/Lennart Preiss) Speaking for the first time since the move, Jones gave an opening statement to media members at the team’s facility in East Rutherford, New Jersey, where he was nothing but a class act.   ""The opportunity to play for the New York Giants was truly a dream come true,"" Jones began. ""I’m extremely grateful to the Mara and Tisch families for the chance to play here. The Giants are truly a first-class organization, and I have nothing but genuine respect and appreciation for the people who have built it and the people who carry on that tradition.  ""I take full responsibility for my part in not bringing more wins. No one wanted to win more games worse than me, and I gave everything I had on the field and in my preparation. Of course, this season has been disappointing for all and of course I wish I could’ve done more. I’m 100% accountable for my part. I did not play well enough, consistently enough to help the team get the results. The reality of the NFL is it’s hard to win games and requires consistent performance from everyone involved. We didn’t do that well enough, so the idea to change something happens and I understand. GIANTS LEGEND VICTOR CRUZ POSES BIG ARCH MANNING QUESTION AS FRANCHISE GETS SET FOR QUARTERBACK SEARCH ""I love the game, I love being a part of the team, and I’m excited for the next opportunity. I know there’s a lot of good football in front of me and I’m excited about that. To all the fans, I have deep respect for your passion and love for the Giants. The fans are a huge part of what makes playing for the Giants so special."" The writing was on the wall for Jones after his mishaps against the Carolina Panthers in Munich, Germany were the last straws for Daboll, GM Joe Schoen and the rest of the organization.  Jones said that conversations were had between Schoen and his agents, where the Giants’ GM explained what the move was going to be. And Jones wasn’t going to be backing up DeVito, as he has a $23 million injury guarantee built into his contract that would come into effect if he were to get hurt.  That’s why the Giants brought in Boyle and are keeping Jones far away from anything that could possibly lead to an injury. Usually in these cases – look at the Las Vegas Raiders with Derek Carr – teams will allow the player to simply stay home and prepare for what’s to come with their next team. For now, Jones is ""still kinda processing"" and wants to help. New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones passes against the Washington Commanders, Nov. 3, 2024, in East Rutherford, New Jersey. (AP Photo/John Munson) ""I’m doing the best I can to help Tommy prepare, help the team prepare and that’s what I’m going to do right now. Processing that, I think the decision was made and not playing,"" Jones said.  As for that injury guarantee, Jones didn’t say so directly, but it sounded like he was trying any way to stay on the field for the Giants. He was asked if he would waive the injury guarantee to get back on the field. ""I want to play. I want to be on the field,"" he said. ""I think I tried to do as much as I could to make that possible and create a situation where we were both comfortable, but most of those discussions went on with my agent and with Joe. I want to play, I want to be on the field, but it’s an unfortunate business side of the game. ""I got the injury guarantee, so that’s that and I understand it. They don’t want to take any risk. So, yeah, at that point it’s just do as you’re told."" Despite his efforts, Jones will continue to sit in the back during practice sessions, and help out wherever he can. But he, like everyone else, knows his NFL future is elsewhere, which is emotional, especially when he hears the support from his teammates.  New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones attends a news conference after a practice session in Munich, Germany, Nov. 8, 2024.

Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James has taken a break from social media ""for the time being,"" and many have shared their own opinions about this course of action by the NBA’s all-time leading scorer.  It also led to some defending of James, which came in the form of former ESPN employee Jemele Hill.  Hill applauded James’ move, which he had posted on X, by saying that ""Twitter has become largely untenable. Selfishly, I hope he deactivates his account."" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James (John E. Sokolowski-Imagn Images) That led to an argument in the comments under Hill’s post, with one user saying, ""I think being a sore loser and having to actually engage uncensored oppositional politics really annoys the left. It’s a soft move."" Hill answered by saying, ""You all are under the twisted belief that subjecting yourself to constant vitriol and engaging with a—holes is some kind of badge of honor.""

""Sorry, it’s not ‘challenging ideology’ calling somebody a c--- 100 times a day. And [Elon] Musk also changed the block features on the platform, too. And again, nobody owes you engagement."" Hill has defended James recently when it came to the presidential election as well, where she blasted San Francisco 49ers star Nick Bosa for his lack of explanation in wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" hat in support of President-elect Donald Trump prior to Election Day. Jemele Hill (YouTube) James had provided details about why he supported Vice President Harris in the election, saying that ""having a daughter, having a wife, having a mother and things of that nature, what (Harris) believes in when it comes to women’s rights, that’s what the future with my kids and where I see our country should be."" Hill used James’ detailed answer on why he was voting for Harris to blast Bosa.  ""Oh look, LeBron was asked about a public political statement that he made and he explained IN DETAIL why he did it. Nick Bosa doesn’t have the guts to do this,"" she said. James’ time off from social media came after he shared the screenshot of a lengthy X post from NBA agent Rich Kleiman, who ripped national sports coverage for its negativity. ""We can all acknowledge that sports is the last part of society that universally brings people together. So why can’t the coverage do the same? It’s only click bait when you say it,"" Kleiman wrote at the time. ""When the platform is so big, you can make the change and allow us all an escape from real life negativity. I for one find it all a waste of breath. The Olympics and JJ [Redick] and Bron’s show was the future of what this can and should all be.""

Months later, he repeated the offense, and he was sidelined for 25 games. In July 2022, Morant got into an altercation with some 17-year-olds, but a judge ruled he acted in self-defense. Four days earlier, Morant had allegedly ""threatened"" the head of security at a Memphis mall, and a member of Morant's group allegedly shoved him in the head.  In the 2022-23 season, the Indiana Pacers claimed that after an altercation between associates of Morant and the Pacers, a red laser was pointed at the team from an SUV that was carrying Morant, which the Pacers believed was a gun.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Giants legend Victor Cruz poses big Arch Manning question as franchise gets set for quarterback search,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/giants-legend-victor-cruz-poses-big-arch-manning-question-franchise-gets-set-quarterback-search,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 11:05:29 -0500","As the New York Giants begin another franchise quarterback journey after the benching of Daniel Jones, franchise legend Victor Cruz wonders if Arch Manning in 2026 is the target.","Giants legendary receiver Victor Cruz reacts after his former team benched Daniel Jones, while asking the Arch Manning question for a franchise in search of a new QB. The Daniel Jones Era in East Rutherford, New Jersey, has all but officially come to an end, as the New York Giants have benched their franchise quarterback with the expectation that they will opt out of his contract following what has been a tumultuous 2024 season.  Head coach Brian Daboll confirmed the reports that Jones was moved to third string and Tommy DeVito, who has been in that position all season, was vaulted to starting quarterback. DeVito won three games as a starter last season with Jones and Tyrod Taylor both hurt.  But DeVito likely isn't the future at quarterback for the Giants, despite being a fan favorite. That leaves Daboll, general manager Joe Schoen and the rest of the organization scrambling back into the war room to figure out the age-old question for any NFL team: Where can we find a franchise quarterback? CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones watches during the second half of an NFL football game against the Carolina Panthers, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Munich, Germany.  (AP Photo/Lennart Preiss) There are a few schools of thought, but Giants legend Victor Cruz has another question that will be answered in due time.  How badly do the Giants want Arch Manning – the nephew of the man who used to throw Cruz passes that led to his salsa touchdown celebrations, Eli Manning. ""Well, it’s interesting, right? I’ve already done this little mental deep dive on this,"" Cruz told Fox News Digital about the Giants' quarterback situation, while also discussing his partnership with Captain Morgan. ""So, the question is, if I’m a Giants GM, if I’m John Mara, if I’m those guys up top, do I want Arch Manning?"" GIANTS STAR DEXTER LAWRENCE ADMITS FEELING A ‘BIT OF CONFUSION’ WITH DANIEL JONES BENCHING: ‘HE’S THE QB1' Arch is a sophomore in the Texas Longhorns' football program, but he has yet to be a starter with Quinn Ewers running Steve Sarkisian's offense the past two seasons, including 2024.  However, the expectation is Arch will take his place as the next great Manning in the NFL at the quarterback position, and he's already shown flashes of what he can do this season when he had to take over for an injured Ewers.  So, while some Giants fans will expect a rookie quarterback to be drafted with a high pick – the Giants currently own the fourth overall pick if the season ended today – Cruz thinks this is the question that needs to be answered first in pursuit of the next great Giants quarterback.  Former New York Giant, Victor Cruz, interacts with the fans at MetLife Stadium, November 26, 2023. (IMAGN) ""Is it a thing where we have a stopgap year, where we just draft talent, we draft guys, we build our roster? And then the following year, you got to do everything you can to get Arch Manning,"" he detailed. ""Trade up, trade down, trade left, trade right. You gotta figure out how to get Arch Manning, if that’s what you want, because he’s going to put butts in the seats, he’s gonna have the Manning aura around him, which obviously New York fans know and love very well. ""Is it a stopgap year, and we go get Arch, or is it Shedeur [Sanders] or is it Cam Ward, which I love both of those guys, and I wouldn’t be mad if those guys were wearing blue next season as well?"" Sanders, the son of Deion Sanders, has shined for the Colorado Buffaloes, while Miami's Cam Ward consistently leads his team to victory even in the face of adversity, a quality Cruz likes to see from a quarterback.  Those two are expected to be among the top quarterbacks taken in the 2025 Draft, while Arch won't be able to declare until the following year. Ewers will also come out of Texas this year, making way for Arch to be the sole starter in Austin, where many believe his draft stock as a high first-rounder will be cemented. Arch Manning #16 of the Texas Longhorns scrambles in the third quarter against the Texas Tech Red Raiders at Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium on November 24, 2023 in Austin, Texas.  (Tim Warner/Getty Images) ""I think he’s also a baller,"" Cruz said of Arch. ""I think he’s faster than any Manning we’ve seen thus far. We can throw it, he has that thing about him, and I think he’s a great player."" There's no doubt the Giants' quarterbacks room will be vastly different in 2025, but the organization must figure out what the right move is in terms of filling it. Giving Arch the opportunity to follow down his uncle's path would likely mean having another down season to secure a high draft pick, or trading away a bunch of other picks to move up for the opportunity to take him.  And what's not to say Arch doesn't stay for his senior season in 2026, opting to come out for the 2027 Draft instead? To counteract that possibility, do the Giants simply use the top pick they're expected to have this year to grab a rookie quarterback, perhaps bring in a veteran as well, and hope they can compete again in 2025? It's never a thought any team wants to have heading into Week 12 of the season, but at 2-8 following the bye week, and the evaluation of Jones resulting in his benching, the Giants have to be thinking about what to do next even with a few games left on the slate.  Victor Cruz believes the Giants have a big Arch Manning question to answer in terms of their quarterback of the future. (IMAGN) GETTING CREATIVE WITH CAPTAIN MORGAN While Cruz is trying to answer the Giants’ quarterback question, he’s also excited about his latest collaboration with Captain Morgan, specifically what he and fashion designer KidSuper cooked up as part of the company’s ""Follow the Captain"" scavenger hunt.  Cruz discussed how much fun he had creating a crewneck sweater with KidSuper that pays homage to his trademark touchdown dance.  ""Our crewnecks are dropping with myself, Captain Morgan, KidSuper. [The crewnecks] definitely embody my style, like my swagger, got the little salsa love on there as well,"" Cruz said. ""I’m definitely excited about this one, not just for people to go out there and see it and wear it and purchase it, but to just be part of the crew. I think getting this crewneck makes you part of the squad, part of the team. So, when you see me outside, and you’re rocking your crewneck, and I’m rocking mine, it just brings it all together and brings that team atmosphere together.""

President-elect Donald Trump's new secretary of Education, Linda McMahon, is not exactly the school librarian type.  As the wife of WWE founder Vince McMahon, Linda has been heavily involved in the wrestling entertainment product for decades, much like Trump himself. She even led the WWE organization as CEO.  The new executive branch Cabinet member was even the recipient of violent wrestling moves during WWE events decades ago.  Clips of McMahon's body slams have resurfaced across social media in the days since the announcement of her appointment.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM In one event, Glenn Thomas Jacobs, also known as ""Kane,"" hit the new Education secretary with a tombstone piledriver that knocked her, apparently, unconscious on an episode of ""Monday Night Raw"" in the early 2000s.  In one of WWE's more infamous sagas of the era, she was featured in a series of skits that saw her hit her children, Stephanie and Shane McMahon. In some of those skits, her children hit back.  McMahon served on the Connecticut Board of Education for a year starting in 2009. She told lawmakers at the time that she had a lifelong interest in education and once planned to become a teacher. She attempted two runs at the Senate as a Connecticut Republican, losing the 2010 race to Richard Blumenthal and the 2012 race to Chris Murphy.  JOHN CENA TO COMPETE IN 2025 ROYAL RUMBLE EVENT AS WWE LEGEND EMBARKS ON FAREWELL TOUR Then-President Donald Trump shakes hands with Linda McMahon, the outgoing administrator of the Small Business Administration, as she sits beside him after announcing her resignation, at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, on March 29, 2019.

When McMahon was chosen for that role, she was praised by Blumenthal and Murphy, the two Connecticut Democrats who defeated her in Senate campaigns.

Former NCAA swimmer and conservative activist Riley Gaines shared the story of her marriage with fellow former University of Kentucky swimmer Louis Barker, who is originally from England, in a recent TikTok. Barker and Gaines were both swimmers while in college. Gaines joined the University of Kentucky's swim team and made the All-SEC freshman Team in 2019. She was also on the All-SEC Second Team in 2019 and 2020. Barker participated in the British Olympic Trials qualifier in 2016. Then in 2018, Barker participated in the 2018 Commonwealth Games Trials qualifier. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The two dated for two years, between 2019 and 2021. In December 2021, Barker proposed to Gaines, which she announced on social media. They were married in May 2022 in Nashville, Tennessee.  Now, Gaines, who has spoken out against illegal immigration and Vice President Harris for her poor handling of the border crisis, shared that her and her husband have been dealing with immigration issues themselves in recent years. Gaines says Barker, despite coming into the country legally, has not been able to attain citizenship or even a green card yet, despite the fact that the couple has been married for two years.  ""Maybe you think you think he's well on his way to the U.S. citizen, and you would be wrong. After two and a half years of marriage, he still doesn't have his green card,"" Gaines said. Gaines says the couple received a letter in the mail. The reason Barker has not been granted citizenship is that he does not have the COVID-19 vaccine.  ""Think about how hard our government has made it for people migrating into this country legally in comparison to those who break the law. Because if you just walk across the southern border, you're given housing, a driver's license, money."" RILEY GAINES REPEATEDLY TEARS INTO AOC FOR TAKING PRONOUNS OUT OF X BIO AFTER ADVOCATING FOR TRANS ATHLETES Elon Musk reposed Gaines' TikTok video on X with a message advocating for legal immigration reform. Musk himself is also a legal immigrant from South Africa who has also spoken in favor of immigration reform in the U.S. Musk has also denied a Washington Post report that alleges the tech billionaire began his career working in the U.S. illegally.  ""Legal immigration to America is ridiculously slow and difficult, even for super talented people. Needs to be fixed,"" Musk wrote.  Musk moved to Canada at 18 and got citizenship there via his mother and, a few years later, studied at the University of Pennsylvania.  U.S. immigration law requires immigrant visa applicants to obtain certain vaccinations prior to the issuance of an immigrant visa. The COVID-19 vaccine was added to that list under the Biden-Harris administration. Panel physicians who conduct medical examinations of immigrant visa applicants are required to verify that immigrant visa applicants have met the vaccination requirements, or that it is medically inappropriate for the visa applicant to receive one or more of the listed vaccinations.  Former competitive swimmer Riley Gaines speaks during a campaign rally for Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump at Desert Diamond Arena on Aug. 23, 2024 in Glendale, Arizona. (Rebecca Noble/Getty Images) However, none of this applies to people who sneak into the country illegally.  Gaines previously spoke out against illegal immigration in a social media spat with Mark Cuban.  After Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) released data to lawmakers in September revealing that tens of thousands of illegal immigrants with sex offenses and homicide convictions have crossed the border into the U.S. under the Biden-Harris administration, including 13,099 convicted of homicide and 15,811 of sexual assault, Gaines took aim at Cuban for suggesting Harris did a ""good job"" handling the border.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""We might have different standards for what qualifies as a 'good job,' but I don’t think the illegal entrance of 15,000+ rapists, 13,000+ murderers, and 320,000 missing children fits the bill,"" Gaines on X in response to Cuban.  Gaines' reference to the 320,000 missing children was from another report from the Department of Homeland Security released Aug. 21 that revealed the Biden-Harris administration had lost track of that number of migrant children who crossed the border without parents.  Meanwhile, ICE Boston announced on Wednesday the arrests of two illegal immigrants who have been charged with forcibly raping children in Massachusetts, as well as a third individual who was convicted of raping a child in Brazil, and was hiding in the U.S. after being caught and released at the U.S. border in 2022.

Purdy started to throw in practice, but stopped to get worked on by a trainer after just a few minutes — and then his scheduled media availability got pushed back to Friday. “He was still limited today,” 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan told KNBR Thursday afternoon. “He didn’t do as much yesterday but did a little bit more today. He went out there and did a little bit then went back in about halfway through and rested up. Hopefully, it will be feeling great on Sunday.” After surveying the scene, Cam Inman, a 49ers beat reporter for the Bay Area News Group, labeled Purdy’s status for Sunday’s game against the Packers as “growing grim.” Veteran backups Brandon Allen and Josh Dobbs are behind Purdy on the 49ers’ depth chart. The 49ers fell to 5-5 after losing to their division-rival Seahawks last week, and are already one loss away from hitting their preseason under total on the year.  Prior to practice on Thursday, NFL Media’s Tom Pelissero had been confident that Purdy would play Sunday. “Brock Purdy, from everything I’ve been told, should be fine for this game on Sunday against the Packers,” Pelissero told “Rich Eisen Show” guest host Mike Hill. “He’s got a sore shoulder. I know he dove—I’m not sure if that’s the play—but he dove for the pylon in the game last week, might have landed on it a little bit. But it’s not anything that’s like a major injury. Star pass rusher Nick Bosa and left tackle Trent Williams also missed practice for the 49ers on Thursday. The 7-3 Packers are three-point favorites over the 49ers, according to the latest odds on DraftKings.",2024-11-21,1,0.43,0.57

Answering questions Thursday for the first time since he was demoted earlier this week to end a disappointing six-year run as the starter, Jones essentially said goodbye to the Giants.  But he stopped short of admitting that he might leave the team before the end of the season. Jones appears to be behind new starter Tommy DeVito, backup Drew Lock and even new practice-squad addition Tim Boyle on the depth chart because the Giants do not want to risk playing him and activating the $23 million injury guarantee in his contract. “I’m still processing … how this decision was made and not playing,” Jones said, his voice cracking at times over the course of 11 minutes. “For now, I’m doing the best I can to help Tommy and the team prepare.” The normally unflappable Jones opened by reading from a 90-second prepared statement during which he thanked owners, teammates, coaches, fans and staff.  He used the past tense when he said “the opportunity to play for the Giants was truly a dream come true.” “There have been some great times, but, of course, we all wish there had been more of those,” Jones said. “I take full responsibility for my part in not bringing more wins. No one wanted to win those games worse than me. I gave everything I had.” Jones’ practice workload Thursday included slipping on a pinny and lining up as a scout-team safety during offensive install periods.  It’s not unusual for offensive players who are not playing Sunday to lend a hand in that walking/jogging situation, but it is unusual for a $160 million investment to be reduced to it. Why is Jones not merely the No. 2 quarterback? Start with the clause that if Jones cannot pass a physical by March, then the Giants’ dead-salary-cap charge for cutting him jumps from $22.2 million to $45.2 million — a nightmare for general manager Joe Schoen. “I have the injury guarantee, so that’s that,” Jones said. “They don’t want to take any risks. At that point, it’s just do as you’re told.” Whether the Giants give permission to Jones, 27, to return home or release him really is the only remaining question.  He declined to say if he will ask for his release or whether the Giants asked him to waive his injury guarantee before benching him. Derek Carr left the Raiders but Russell Wilson stayed with the Broncos in past similar situations tied to injury guarantees. “I wanted to play badly,” Jones said. “I think I tried to do as much as I could to make that possible and create a situation where we were both comfortable. Most of those discussions went on with my agent and Joe. I want to be on the field, but it’s the unfortunate business side of the game.” For salary-cap purposes, there is essentially no difference between releasing Jones today or any other day before March 12, when the new league year begins.  The Giants could gain a small amount of immediate salary-cap space by cutting Jones because his salary offsets and a new team would pay him the league minimum. But the Giants (2-8) run a potentially embarrassing risk of Jones signing with a team on their schedule and beating them head-to-head over the final seven games — like if he joined the Cowboys and supplanted Cooper Rush before Thanksgiving or teamed with Saquon Barkley on the Eagles and played in Week 18 as their starters rest for the playoffs. “I know that there is a lot of good football in front of me,” Jones said. “I’m excited about that.”

The Giants have the NFL’s lowest-scoring offense (15.6 points per game), and Jones’ play alone warranted a benching (3-13 over his last 16 starts).  But teammates have taken the blame for the Giants’ failures, with Dexter Lawrence even calling Jones “QB1” despite DeVito starting Sunday against the Buccaneers. “I’ve created a lot of great relationships here with the guys here and definitely appreciate the support,” Jones said in his most emotional moment. “But, it’s about the team and what’s best for the team. I know the guys will be ready to go.” The former first-round draft pick never returned to the level he reached in 2022, when he led the Giants to 10 wins, including the playoffs, and was rewarded with an extension that ultimately will pay him $82 million over two years.  The Giants made other excuses (offensive line, receivers, coaching changes) for the team’s struggles during most of Jones’ time, going 24-44-1 before pulling the plug and looking toward the 2025 draft for his replacement. “They’re looking to change things up. That was what was communicated,” Jones said. “Definitely not happy about it. Not what you want to hear. All those emotions you have. We’re in a business where you’re expected to get results, and we weren’t doing it. Have got to accept it and understand.” Jones admitted that the possibility of getting benched was “maybe a little bit in the back of [my] mind” after the Giants lost to the lowly Panthers in overtime. Giants fans have booed Jones and the offense at every home game (five losses) this season. “To all the fans, I have deep respect and appreciation for your passion and love for the Giants,” Jones said. “The fans are a huge part of what makes playing for the Giants so special.”",2024-11-21,0,0.6,0.4

The highly touted prospect made the announcement in a highly produced video that featured clips of Underwood when he was young pretending to announce his commitment to the University of Michigan.  The video also showed old clips of him as a kid in Michigan gear as well as clips of him playing over the years.  Now, several years later, Underwood seemed to have come full circle with the decision announced on Thursday.  Interestingly, Underwood plays high school football at Belleville High School, where former Michigan football staffer Connor Stallions currently serves as an assistant coach.  It had been reported by On3 last week that Michigan had made Underwood a $10.5 million NIL offer to get him to go to Ann Arbor.  A post shared by Bryce Underwood (@19bryce.__) Chatter had first popped up that Michigan was going hard at trying to flip Underwood back in October, according to On3, and now his decision would seem to paint Michigan as a potential contender next year.  “Premier arm talent who is one of the more gifted high school quarterback prospects in recent years. Combination of arm strength, pocket feel and processing ability makes him the top quarterback in the 2025 cycle,” On3 wrote in a scouting summary of Underwood.  Underwood first came to national prominence in 2021 when he threw for 2,888 yards and 39 touchdowns in his freshman year at Belleville.  Belleville is the favorite to capture its third state championship in four years this season.",2024-11-21,1,0.4,0.6

Pelech, as of earlier this week, had yet to begin skating on his own, so there is plenty of time for the situation to change regarding the young defenseman. But the first clue as to how the Islanders will handle what amounts to a choice between taking George or Dennis Cholowski out of the lineup when Pelech returns came Tuesday night in Calgary. With Alexander Romanov back in the fold, George was no longer needed on the top pair but still saw 22:16 of ice time to Cholowski’s 14:04, and that is even with Cholowski leading the team in power-play ice time at 2:10 in the Isles’ 2-1 loss to the Flames. Advantage to the young guy. “I thought it went good. We were good together,” George said of his first game alongside Ryan Pulock. “Great partner out there, so it was good.” The advanced numbers weren’t pretty for the two, and much of the night was indeed spent in the defensive zone for the Islanders as a whole.  But George displayed the same traits that have made his first NHL stint so eye-opening, skating his way out of trouble and getting the puck up ice with ease. The 20-year-old’s unflappability has been the most impressive thing about his game.  He doesn’t play like someone with fewer than 10 games under his belt at this level. “I think for the most part, guys around me, coaches and all that, have done a good job supporting me,” George told The Post before the Isles finished their five-game road trip against the Red Wings on Thursday. “Be prepared and be ready. I feel confident out there and ready to go. Obviously, there’s little things you just learn as you go, but overall, I feel like I’m prepared.” With Mike Reilly coming off heart surgery this week, it appears either George or Cholowski will be the team’s third-pair defenseman on the left side for the foreseeable future once Pelech returns. It’s not quite as simple as assuming George will get the job because he’s getting more minutes, though. Cholowski is getting strong reviews from coach Patrick Roy, as well, and the power-play minutes are a real question, with Roy saying the team didn’t want to overtax Pulock — who likely would replace Cholowski at five-on-four if he became a healthy scratch — by having him on that unit, as well as playing heavy five-on-five and penalty-kill minutes.

I’m very happy with him.” An argument also could be made that George’s development could benefit more from playing top-pair minutes in Bridgeport than on the third pair with the Islanders, but that might be a stretch given how comfortable George has looked in the NHL. On Thursday, he framed the jump from juniors to Bridgeport — where he played just four games before being called up — as a bigger adjustment than going from there to the NHL.  That is not what you usually hear, but it tracks with how he’s played as an Islander. “Obviously, it was a big change for me, just being in junior for the last three to four years.

And yet, despite all their troubles during the early going of the 2024-25 season, oddsmakers are still expecting the 76ers to make a postseason berth.  The Sixers are currently -215 at FanDuel Sportsbook to make the playoffs in the East, which are the eighth-best odds in the conference.  Luckily for Joel Embiid and Co., the East has been atrocious so far this season.  Only four teams — the Cavaliers, Celtics, Knicks and Magic — have a winning record, while the former two teams are the only ones in the conference with a winning percentage better than .600.  The West, by contrast, has 11 teams over .500 heading into Thursday’s play.  The 76ers came into the season with sky-high expectations after signing nine-time All-Star Paul George in free agency to pair next to Embiid and Tyrese Maxey.  Philly was roundly considered a top-five NBA title contender until things started falling apart shortly before opening night in October.  Embiid missed the first nine games of the season to manage a persisting knee injury. On Nov. 2, the star big man shoved Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Marcus Hayes in the postgame locker room and was later suspended three games by the NBA.  Paul George, who has been in and out of the lineup as well, re-injured his hyperextended knee on Wednesday night during a loss to the Grizzlies. After a loss on Monday, Maxey called out Embiid for being late “for everything” during a team meeting amid the spiraling season. Dylan Svoboda is a versatile writer and analyst across many sports.

ESPN analyst and former Jets and Bills coach Rex Ryan seemed to be campaigning hard to be considered as a candidate for the position during an appearance on ESPN New York’s “Bart & Hahn.”  Ryan argued against blowing up the Jets’ roster when he started to make a point that he would be able to get the team’s current talent pool to win.  “I look at it this way, blow it up? We’re going to blow the opponents up,” Ryan told hosts Alan Hahn and Bart Scott, who played for Ryan during his time on the Jets. “There’s way too much talent on this team to play the way we’ve been playing. How hard can you get a guy to play? That’s the thing. Nobody has seen a team that is going to play as hard as this team’s going to play in the future, trust me. If I’m the guy, trust me.” Ryan served as the Jets head coach through one of the franchise’s more successful periods in recent memory, though the vibe quickly shifted.  The Jets went 46-50 during Ryan’s run from 2009-14, which included back-to-back trips to the AFC championship game in his first two seasons.  However, the success quickly fizzled out, and he finished with losing records in two out of his last three seasons.  Ryan argued during Thursday’s radio appearance that there wasn’t another candidate out there that could embrace the Jets culture.  “That’s what is going to separate me from all these other guys you’re going to bring in. Your Grudens or whoever. Give me a break,” he continued. “They ain’t New York Jets. I’m all about the Jets. And the great thing is, yeah, you get a second chance at it and that doesn’t happen very often. Well, when it does it’s usually special. We’ll find out if I get that chance or not. If not, I hope they have one hell of a guy in place cause I still want to be a fan of the Jets. I still want to be, but when I look around I know nobody is better than me.” Ryan had used another ESPN New York show earlier this week to suggest that the Jets would be in a better spot than they are now if he was at the helm.  The former NFL coach said on “DiPietro & Rothenberg” on Monday that the team would be “probably undefeated” if he had the job.  The response came after he had been asked where he thought the team would be if he was still coaching them.  The Jets are 3-8 as they enter their bye week, as their season has all but come to an end after starting the year with Super Bowl aspirations.",2024-11-21,0,0.71,0.29

Alex Ovechkin has a fracture to his left fibula and is expected to miss four to six weeks in an early-season gut punch for the Capitals.  The Capitals star was originally placed on injured reserved and listed as week-to-week after he collided with Utah forward Jack McBain during the third period of Monday’s game on the road.  It puts Ovechkin’s season on pause at a time where he’s not only scoring goals at a prodigious pace, but also at a point where he is nearing NHL history.  With his five goals over the last two games, Ovechkin has 15 goals in 18 games this season, and, for his career, he’s at 868 goals — only 27 behind Wayne Gretzky for the all-time NHL record.  Now, the 39-year-old will miss at least a month as he nears the historic mark.  “Everyone’s bummed out,” forward Tom Wilson told reporters Thursday. “We were sitting there saying: ‘This is weird. Like, it’s unbelievable that he’s actually hurt.’ It’s one of those things where like, he’s going to miss games? I’ve been around a long time, and it’s new to me.” The stretch will almost undoubtedly be the longest period of games he’ll miss in his North American career, as he’s only sat out 35 games due to injury over his 20 seasons in the NHL.  According to NHL.com, the most consecutive games he’s missed was six when he was dealing with an upper-body injury in November 2009.  Even after two decades in the league, the three-time Hart Trophy winner has been a huge part of the Capitals’ success this year, as his 25 points rank second on the team only behind Dylan Strome.

The 25-year-old did not participate in the Blueshirts’ morning skate Thursday ahead of their game against the Flames at the ScotiaBank Saddledome. However, Chytil skated with the extras following the team practice. “He’s day-to-day,” head coach Peter Laviolette said, declining to say whether Chytil would play against the Oilers on Saturday. It’s an encouraging sign that Chytil was cleared both to fly and get back on the ice, but it appears the Rangers are understandably in no rush to plug No. 72 back into the lineup. Chytil was examined by specialists in New York after a scary collision with K’Andre Miller along the half wall in the Sharks game last week.  Doctors ruled that he did not suffer a concussion, which is what sidelined Chytil for 72 of 82 regular season games in 2023-24, as he endured what is believed to be the fourth such injury of his eight-year NHL career. The chances of Chytil playing in Edmonton are certainly higher, especially given the Rangers presumably wouldn’t have flown him out unless they wanted him to play. Otherwise, Chytil could’ve been resting further in New York ahead of his next game, though Chytil probably wanted to be around the team, anyway. The Rangers’ third-line center was off to a strong start, anchoring the team’s most consistent unit alongside Will Cuylle and Kaapo Kakko.

Smith is annoyed with the NFL.  The ESPN personality and sports talk host ranted on the latest edition of his eponymous podcast over the league’s decision to comment on its players doing a Donald Trump-inspired dance last weekend.  The dance, which has become a craze across the sports world, made headlines over the last week, and the NFL released a statement earlier in the week that it would not be handing out punishments over the moves.  Smith had no issue with the players doing the dance, but his issues stemmed from the fact the league even had to address the issue.  “Celebrations usually don’t warrant that. It doesn’t require a response from the league,” Smith said. “So why was it necessary this time? You know why? Because we got a bunch of people still living with their heads in the cloud acting like they get to protest every little damn thing. This is America. Donald Trump won the election, rather convincingly, I might add.” Among the players who did the Trump dance during Week 11’s slate of games were Raiders tight end Brock Bowers, Titans wide receiver Calvin Ridley and Lions defensive end Za’Darius Smith.  The week before, 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa did it as he celebrated a sack on Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield.  “And why am I ticked off?” Smith continued. “Because it was emblematic of the climate that we’ve been living in for years now, which is why I believe Donald Trump was really elected… woke culture, cancel culture, oh hell yes, that played a role. When you got people walking around wondering whether or not they’re echoing the right pronoun.  “Wondering whether or not that was gonna cost them their job or being PC because God forbid your opinion is different than the average folk walking around in America. Lord knows what would happen to you. That’s what America regressed to.” UFC fighter Jon Jones busted out the Trump moves after he won at UFC 309, and American soccer star Christian Pulisic also did it during the United State’s game against Jamaica this week. Trump has seemingly enjoyed the extra attention, writing on Truth Social this week: “TRUMP DANCE SWEEPS THE NATION,” with a video of players doing the moves.",2024-11-21,0,0.52,0.48

The Yankees captain won his second American League MVP Award in three seasons, beating out the Royals’ Bobby Witt Jr. and teammate Juan Soto unanimously in voting that was announced Thursday night. Judge, who set the franchise home run mark two seasons ago, has made further history in becoming just the seventh Yankee ever to win multiple MVPs.  He now stands with Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris and Alex Rodriguez. The award was deserved after threatening his own home run record and finishing with 58, which led the major leagues (as did his 1.159 OPS, 144 RBIs and 133 walks, among many other categories). After a slow April, Judge pieced together one of the best May-through-Septembers the sport has ever seen.  From May 3 until the end of the regular season, he hit .357 with a .492 OBP and 52 home runs in 125 games. Judge put together an all-around stronger year than his 2022 MVP campaign.  It included career highs in batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, OPS, hits, doubles, RBIs, walks, times on base, total bases, extra-base hits and games played.  He became the fourth player in MLB history to stroke at least 58 homers in multiple seasons, joining Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire and Babe Ruth. His OPS was the highest in a 162-game season since Barry Bonds’ 1.422 in 2004. A dream season ended with a nightmare, though. Judge struggled in a postseason in which he struck out 20 times in 64 plate appearances.  It was the failings of his glove that will be remembered most, his dropped fly ball in the fifth inning of the deciding Game 5 of the World Series helping open the door for the Dodgers to score five unearned runs.",2024-11-21,1,0.42,0.58

In 2021, Cespedes attempted a comeback, holding a showcase in Fort Pierce, Fla. that 11 teams attended, and briefly spoke with the Mets about a potential reunion, although talks fell apart when the outfielder reportedly claimed he was unwilling to play in the minors.  Cespedes, 39, has been out of professional baseball entirely since 2022-23 when he played for Águilas Cibaeñas in the Dominican Winter League.  The Mets traded for Cespedes at the 2015 MLB trade deadline in exchange for pitchers Michael Fulmer and Luis Cessa. Before the 2017 season, Cespedes signed a four-year, $110 million deal with the Mets.  Injuries, including separate surgeries to remove calcifications from both heels, which hampered him over the latter years with the Mets, playing in just 127 games from 2017-20.  During five total seasons in the orange and blue, Cespedes hit .279/.344/.539 with 76 home runs and 205 RBIs, including making the National League All-Star team and finishing 8th in NL MVP voting in 2016.  Cespedes played eight total seasons in the majors in stints with the A’s, Red Sox and Tigers, in addition to the Mets, after defecting from Cuba in 2011.",2024-11-21,1,0.32,0.68

They have vastly outperformed oddsmakers’ expectations in posting a 10-6-3 record, which has them holding down the third playoff spot out of the Pacific Division.  It’s hard to say if Calgary’s current process will continue to yield such strong results.  The goaltending tandem of Dan Vladar and Dustin Wolf has been surprisingly excellent thus far, achieving the league’s fourth-best save percentage.  Unlike the Rangers, who rank first in team save percentage, nobody projected the Flames tandem to be a strength this season.  Over the last 15 games, Calgary has been outshot by 3.13 shots per 60 and holds an expected goal share of 46.01 percent.  If Flames goaltending starts to falter, it should expose their subpar defensive play and lead to significantly worse results.  The Flames’ offensive core is led by aging veterans Nazem Kadri and Jonathan Huberdeau, and they lack dynamic offensive talent.  The Rangers, meanwhile, continue to achieve tremendous regular-season results with their combination of elite goaltending and clinical finishing talent year after year.

The superstar gymnast debuted a short bob haircut when she hit the red carpet solo at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville.  Biles’ husband, Jonathan Owens, was back in Chicago as the Bears are preparing for a matchup with the Vikings in Minnesota on Sunday.  It’s unclear when exactly Biles — who secured four medals, including three gold at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris — cut her hair.  The 27-year-old rocked a long ponytail on Sunday, when the Bears were defeated by the Packers 20-19 at Soldier Field in Chicago.  Before that, she sported stunning long curls for the Bears’ home loss to the Patriots, 19-3, on Nov. 10.  Biles opted for voluminous ’90s glam, according to celebrity hairstylist Justin Revenge. The Olympian wore a stunning metallic gown — a trend on the CMA Awards red carpet — which had one off-the-shoulder sleeve and pointed stilettos.  Biles had two outfit changes at the 58th annual show.  She wore a sparkling metallic pantsuit by VICI to present the award for Female Vocalist of the Year, which went to Lainey Wilson. Biles wore a black tank top underneath an oversized blazer and pointed black heels.  The gymnastics legend then switched to a strapless red mini dress and white cowboy boots for the CMA afterparty at Music City Center. Biles shared that she’s been resting after the Paris Olympics. “I try to rest as much as possible, but it’s always fun to get opportunities to come and do stuff like this because it’s fun walking the carpet and meeting new people,” she told ABC ahead of the CMA Awards.",2024-11-21,1,0.25,0.75

That’s according to GemRate, whose Iconic Tracker monitors the graded card population tallies for the hobby’s most popular cards.   PSA graded six of the 1952s with SGC and Beckett each slabbing one.  SGC graded ten of the 16 1951 rookie cards, with PSA grading four and Beckett labeling two. In all, 2,853 copies of the 1952 Mantle and just over 4,000 ’51 Bowman rookie cards have been authenticated since the 1990s.  One of the hobby’s hottest cards saw 32 examples newly encapsulated last month.  PSA graded 31 1984-85 Star Company Michael Jordan cards with BGS slabbing one.

As we reported last week, the multi-page paper, not surprisingly, was focused on sports, with Robinson chronicling the history and development of baseball, football and hockey.   Completed while Robinson was a UCLA student, it was purchased years ago from the estate of long-time UCLA assistant football coach A.J. Sturzenegger and was being offered at auction for the first time.  The final price, including an 18% buyer’s premium, was just above the pre-sale estimate. Among the other items sold in the auction were a completely graded 1956 Topps baseball set with each card rated 6 or better ($25,960) and a 1932 US Caramel Babe Ruth graded 1.5 by SGC ($12,390). —–  Bidding for the 1933 Goudey Babe Ruth graded PSA 8.5 is set to end Friday night.   No other examples of #149–one of four Ruth cards in the set–have been graded higher. The card appears well on its way to crossing the seven-figure mark via Fanatics Collect’s Premier Auction, which includes about 100 vintage and modern cards. —– A dozen lots of Connor McDavid game-used items are on the block at MeiGray Auctions. Among the items are the CCM helmet with Oakley shield McDavid was wearing when he recorded his 50th and 100th points of the 2022-23 NHL season.  The navy blue helmet has been photomatched to a total of 13 games played between October of 2022 and March of last season.  Others date to last season and include the game-used skates and puck from the assist that marked his 100th point and the stick from his 80th assist, photo matched to two games. A pair of pants worn across parts of two seasons and game-worn socks are also part of the auction that runs until Dec. 5. MeiGray offers regular auctions of memorabilia from McDavid, who recently scored the 1,000th point of his career. —– Vintage set breaks continue to be popular with some collectors.  The concept is similar to a modern break:  buy a spot and a random draw determines the card(s) you get.  Justin Farber of T206Cards.com says in addition to selling cards outright, his two-year-old company has already conducted 12 1986-87 Fleer basketball breaks, eight 1953 Topps baseball breaks and six of both 1955 and ’56 Topps sets, among others.  Some breaks are designed around high-end sets like T206 or high value cards from multiple sets. —– A group of collectors is celebrating five years of raising money for a children’s charity during the  holiday season.  Since 2000, the Facebook Vintage Wax and Packs group has raised over $23,000 through items donated and placed for sale on the group page.  Last year alone, they raised over $8,000 for The John Theissen Children’s Foundation (JTCF), a non-profit that helps sick and underprivileged children in the New York area. This year, they’re hoping to raise $10,000. They’re asking for donation commitments of vintage unopened items worth at least $100. The items are then offered for sale on the group’s page. Once sold, the person who made the donation ships the item to the buyer.  Those who donate are asked to provide photos with a recommended selling price. A tax receipt is available to all donors once your item is sold.  Those who would like to donate can reach out to Dave Eisenberg at [email protected]. —– If you’re a little new to the hobby and/or the whole grading thing, you might check out some tips on sports card grading that our friends at Just Collect have put together.

This potentially would bring women’s professional basketball back to Cleveland for the first time in over twenty years. The team would be the WNBA’s 16th franchise, joining the league’s growing roster as early as 2027 or 2028. The new franchise would play its home games at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse, which has undergone significant renovations in recent years. Additionally, the team would utilize the Cleveland Clinic Peak Performance Center, a new state-of-the-art training and business facility currently under development and set to open in 2027. “It has long been woven into our mission to utilize our platform to unite our community in ways that drive equal opportunities across the board,” said Rock Entertainment Group in a statement to Reuters. “To that end, we are actively pursuing bringing a WNBA expansion team to Cleveland.” Cleveland previously had a WNBA team, the Cleveland Rockers, one of the league’s original franchises. The Rockers played from 1997 to 2003, folding after then-owner Gordon Gund ceased operations and the league could not find a new owner.

Sports Weez,Double Chance Betting: Strategies for Consistent Returns,https://sportsweez.com/double-chance-betting/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:36:06 +0000","Double chance betting is one of the most straightforward and beginner-friendly ways to wager on sports.

It’s a strategic approach that offers bettors a higher chance of success by covering two potential outcomes of a match instead of one. While the payouts might not be as high as traditional single bets, double chance betting is perfect for those who prefer consistent returns over high-risk gambles. Let’s dive into how double chance betting works and explore strategies to make it work for you. Double chance betting allows you to bet on two of the three possible outcomes in a match—either a win, loss, or draw—ensuring you have a greater chance of your bet landing. It’s commonly used in sports like football, where matches can end in a draw. Here’s how it breaks down: For example, if Manchester United is playing Arsenal, and you bet on 1X, you win your bet if Manchester United wins or the game ends in a draw. The only way you lose is if Arsenal wins outright. Double chance betting is a lower-risk option compared to betting solely on a single outcome. It’s particularly useful in matches where predicting a clear winner is difficult or when underdogs have a decent chance of causing an upset. However, the lower risk comes with reduced odds, meaning your potential payouts will be smaller compared to traditional bets. One of the best ways to use double chance betting is to back underdogs that are capable of holding their own. For example, a mid-table team playing away at a stronger team might be underestimated by bookmakers. Betting on the X2 option can give you value, as a draw or an unexpected win for the underdog both result in a payout. While the odds for single double chance bets might not be high, combining several double chance bets into an accumulator can boost potential returns. For instance, selecting three matches with double chance bets can turn lower-risk wagers into a higher-reward opportunity, though the risk of losing increases with each added selection. If you’re confident about a team but still see a risk of a draw, a double chance bet can be a safer alternative to a straight win bet. For instance, if a team has been drawing a lot of matches but still looks likely to dominate, betting on 1X or X2 offers a safety net. Before placing a double chance bet, study the recent form of both teams. Look at their performance in the last 5–10 matches, their home and away records, and how they’ve historically fared against each other. Teams that often play conservatively or struggle to win outright can be great candidates for double chance bets. Some leagues, like Italy’s Serie A or international tournaments, tend to have a higher percentage of drawn matches. Games between evenly matched teams or those with defensive setups are prime opportunities for double chance bets, especially X2 or 1X options. For added value, consider combining double chance bets with other markets like over/under goals. For example, you could bet on 1X and Over 1.5 Goals, meaning your bet wins if the home team wins or draws, provided at least two goals are scored in the match. Occasionally, bookmakers might undervalue the probability of a draw or an underdog performing well. Double chance betting allows you to capitalize on these mispriced odds, particularly in games where the public heavily backs the favorite without much analysis. Live betting provides unique opportunities to place double chance bets when the match dynamics shift. For instance, if the favorite goes a goal down early, the odds for X2 may increase, providing a chance to back the underdog or a draw with better value. Double chance betting isn’t a get-rich-quick strategy, but it’s a fantastic way to reduce risk and maintain steady returns. By focusing on matches with high draw potential or underdog opportunities, you can outsmart the odds and build a disciplined, profitable betting approach. Double chance betting is perfect for those who value consistency and lower-risk wagers. By leveraging smart strategies, analyzing matches carefully, and targeting undervalued outcomes, you can use double chance betting to build a sustainable approach to sports betting. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned punter, this strategy can be a valuable addition to your betting arsenal.",2024-11-21,0,0.51,0.49

Keeping detailed records allows you to monitor your progress, analyze trends, and refine your strategies over time. Whether you’re a casual bettor or serious about turning a profit, a well-structured Excel sheet can be your secret weapon for success. Here’s how to create one that works for you. Open a new Excel sheet and label the first row with key categories. These will act as your columns and determine the type of data you track. Start with the basics: If you’re looking to dive deeper into your betting performance, add additional columns for more nuanced insights: After each bet, record the details in your spreadsheet. Be consistent—accurate records are essential for meaningful analysis. For example: Use Excel’s formulas to make tracking easier and insights clearer: Once your Excel sheet has enough data, start looking for patterns: Use Excel’s built-in chart features to create visual insights: These visuals make it easier to spot trends and evaluate your strategy at a glance. Maintaining your sports betting Excel sheet requires discipline. Update it after every bet, no matter the outcome. Consistent tracking ensures you’re always informed about your performance and helps you avoid emotional decisions based on short-term results. As your betting evolves, adjust your sheet to suit your needs. For instance, add new columns for metrics like implied probability, ROI (return on investment), or bankroll management percentages. Sports betting can be unpredictable, but data gives you an edge.

The club, in collaboration with Sony Pictures Television, is developing two fictional TV shows aimed at attracting new and younger audiences. While details of the shows have not been disclosed, the prospect of seeing top stars like Erling Haaland featured in cartoon form has been raised. According to Manchester City’s Chief Executive Ferran Soriano, the club has “a lot of ideas that we are developing” and is “working on shows for kids” that they are “excited about.” This move comes as the club already produces in-house documentaries, including the recently released “Together” film. Soriano emphasized that the club is confident in its “creativity” and “insights in football” to create compelling fictional stories that can compete with the likes of Netflix and Amazon. He expressed hope that fans will see some of these new projects on their screens in the next few years. This strategic venture into children’s television programming is part of Manchester City’s efforts to engage with younger fans and expand its reach beyond the traditional football audience.",2024-11-21,1,0.37,0.63

The dispute centers around the Premier League’s regulations on associated party transactions (APTs) – commercial deals with parties linked to club owners. Earlier this year, a tribunal ruled that sections of these rules were unlawful, particularly regarding the exclusion of shareholder loans from the league’s fair market value (FMV) test. Following the tribunal’s verdict, the Premier League assured clubs that amendments could be made “quickly and effectively. However, Manchester City has challenged this claim, accusing Premier League chief executive Richard Masters of attempting to mislead clubs in his communication. Now, Aston Villa has waded into the fray, writing to all top-flight clubs to “strongly recommend” that the proposed vote on potential rule changes be postponed. Sawiris explained the rationale behind Villa’s decision, stating: In our view, a vote in 90 days on amended terms taking into consideration the Tribunal’s findings will have a significantly greater chance of securing the unanimous support of all 20 Premier League clubs.” The Villa owner further emphasized the importance of presenting a “united front” to the upcoming Independent Football Regulator, set to be introduced by the government. Sawiris believes that delaying the vote until after the regulator’s arrival will result in a “more satisfactory outcome” for all clubs. Manchester City has also called for a delay in the vote, claiming the Premier League’s proposed changes remain “unlawful” and hinting at the prospect of further legal action. Despite the protests from City and Villa, the Premier League is reportedly determined to proceed with the vote on Friday, declining to comment on the ongoing dispute. This development adds another layer of complexity to the Premier League’s ongoing efforts to address the contentious issue of sponsorship rules and associated party transactions. As the vote looms, the unity of the league’s clubs remains a central concern, with Aston Villa and Manchester City seemingly aligning to challenge the league’s proposed changes.",2024-11-21,1,0.46,0.54

The 23-year-old Cameroonian winger has been in impressive form this season, scoring 8 Premier League goals – the same number as Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah. His performances have caught the eye of both Reds manager Arne Slot and Magpies boss Eddie Howe. Newcastle are believed to view Mbeumo as their top transfer target, with the club keen to bolster their attacking options after struggling for goals so far this campaign, netting just 13 times in the league. However, Liverpool are also said to be interested in the £50 million-rated forward as they look to potentially replace Salah, whose contract expires at the end of the season. Mbeumo’s versatility, able to play across the front three, has drawn comparisons to former Liverpool star Sadio Mane. Slot is reportedly impressed by the 25-year-old’s displays for Brentford. The Bees are reluctant to sell their prized asset in January, with Thomas Frank determined to keep the squad together as they push for a top-half finish. But a summer battle between the two Premier League heavyweights appears on the cards. Newcastle may look to sweeten a potential deal by including injury-prone striker Callum Wilson, who is yet to feature this season. However, Brentford’s £50 million valuation could prove a significant stumbling block for both clubs.",2024-11-21,1,0.45,0.55

The analysis shows that United have a staggering net spend of £1.08 billion (€1.3 billion) since 2015, more than any other club. This includes major signings like Harry Maguire (£80m), Casemiro (£60m), Mason Mount (£55m), Antony (£86m) and Rasmus Hojlund (£72m). In contrast, United have only won five major trophies in that period – two FA Cups, two Carabao Cups and a Europa League. The club’s lack of consistency has led to the recent dismissal of manager Erik ten Hag after just two and a half years, despite being backed with over £600m in new players. Chelsea rank second with a net spend of £1.07 billion (€1.2 billion), followed by Paris Saint-Germain (£825m), Arsenal (£661m) and Tottenham (£591m) to round out the top five. Reigning Premier League champions Manchester City are sixth on the list with a net spend of £585 million, while Liverpool are much further down in 17th place with £304 million. The report highlights the immense financial power of the Premier League, with English clubs accounting for a combined net spend of £19.18 billion over the past decade – more than double the next highest, Italy’s Serie A at £9.03 billion. With new ownership at Manchester United, the club will be hoping to find a more considered approach in the transfer market to deliver sustained success on the pitch.",2024-11-21,1,0.42,0.58

Striker Marcus Rashford, who has struggled for form this season with just four goals, praised Amorim’s training session, saying it was a “top session.

<h1>NHL Recap: Sabres Triumph Over Kings, 1-0, Amid Luukkonen's Stellar Performance</h1>
<h2>Luukkonen's Unyielding Defense</h2>
<p>Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen, the formidable goaltender for the <a href=""https://21sports.com/thrilling-shootout-victory-sabres-douse-flames-in-nhl-showdown/"">Buffalo Sabres</a>, displayed an awe-inspiring performance, parrying 24 attempts on goal during their Wednesday night face-off against the <a href=""https://21sports.com/los-angeles-kings-emerge-victorious-in-dominant-performance-against-columbus-blue-jackets/"">Los Angeles Kings</a>. Despite recently recovering from a lower-body injury that saw him benched for two games, Luukkonen was unstoppable, denying six attempts in the first period, an equal number in the second, and a commanding 12 saves in the final period. This marked his first shutout of the season, contributing significantly to the Sabres' momentum with five victories in their last seven games.</p>
<h2>Zucker's Game-Changing Goal</h2>
<p>The game-changing moment arrived 38 seconds into the third period when Jason Zucker capitalized on a power play, expertly redirecting Rasmus Dahlin's shot past the Kings' goaltender David Rittich. This marked Zucker's fourth goal of the season, giving the Sabres their only, yet decisive, score of the game. Dahlin has been instrumental in the Sabres' recent power plays, having contributed points in the last four consecutive games. His assist on Zucker's goal extended his overall point streak to seven games, with an impressive tally of four goals and six assists.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways from the Game</h2>
<p>Despite the absence of their leading scorer, Tage Thompson, due to a lower-body injury, the Sabres managed to secure the win. Thompson, though missed for the third consecutive game, had returned to practice in the days leading up to the match.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Kings, who have been notoriously inconsistent in their performances since the start of the season, failed to turn the tides in their favor, dropping to a 5-2-1 record on home ice.</p>
<h2>Crucial Statistics and Next Steps</h2>
<p>Heading into the game, Buffalo's away power play stats stood at a lowly 2 for 19 (10.5%), ranking 30th in the NHL. However, a 1-for-3 performance in this game was enough to clinch the victory.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the Sabres will be facing off against Anaheim on Friday night, while the Kings are set to host Seattle on Saturday.</p>

<h1>Joey Daccord Anchors Seattle's First Shutout Victory of the Season</h1>
<p>In a thrilling NHL showdown, Joey Daccord brilliantly denied 24 shots, steering <a href=""https://21sports.com/kraken-surge-seattles-spectacular-comeback-against-columbus-blue-jackets/"">Seattle Kraken</a> to an impressive 3-0 win over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/dustin-wolf-shines-bright-flames-edge-predators-in-a-goalkeepers-duel/"">Nashville Predators</a> on Wednesday. The victory, which marks the Kraken's first shutout of the season, was celebrated with goals from Daniel Sprong, Brandon Montour, and Yanni Gourde. The win extends the Kraken's impressive run, with five victories in their last six games.</p>
<p>Daccord's performance, which included six saves in the first period, eight in the second, and 10 in the third, culminated in his fourth career shutout. This is his first since his remarkable performance against Anaheim on March 26.</p>
<h2>Struggles for the Nashville Predators</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the Predators had a challenging outing. Despite Juuse Saros's commendable effort of 33 saves, Nashville lost for the fourth time in their last five games. The night turned sour for the Predators as they seemed to have scored with 9:21 left in the third period, only for Tommy Novak's goal to be disallowed for a kick.</p>
<h3>Key Contributions and Turning Points</h3>
<p>Sprong's late goal in the second period, his second of the season, broke the deadlock. This critical goal, Sprong's first since his November 8 acquisition from Vancouver, was followed swiftly by Montour's fifth goal of the season, just 23 seconds into the third period. Gourde rounded off the scoring with an empty-netter with just 2:43 remaining.</p>
<p>A rare penalty was incurred by the Predators at the start of the game due to an error in their starting lineup. Filip Forsberg, who was on the ice, was mistakenly replaced by Steven Stamkos in the lineup, resulting in a two-minute bench minor penalty for Nashville.</p>
<h2>Chandler Stephenson Shines for the Kraken</h2>
<p>Seattle's Chandler Stephenson was instrumental in the victory, assisting on all three goals and marking his third multi-assist game of the season. The defining moment came late in the second period when, despite the Kraken's clear advantage in shots, the score was still at a standstill. It was Montour's pass to Stephenson, positioned perfectly at the top of the crease, which set up Sprong's crucial goal.</p>
<h3>Looking Forward</h3>
<p>The Kraken concluded their season-high six-game homestand with a formidable 5-1-0 record. As for what lies ahead, the Predators will host the Winnipeg Jets on Saturday, while the Kraken will travel south to duel with the Los Angeles Kings.</p>

<p>In a thrilling clash of ice giants, <a href=""https://21sports.com/dallas-stars-top-scorer-robertsons-recovery-from-foot-surgery/"">Jason Robertson</a> ended his 10-match scoreless streak by not only netting a goal but also assisting two, in a match that saw the Dallas Stars outshine the <a href=""https://21sports.com/a-deep-dive-into-the-nhls-record-losing-streaks-featuring-the-san-jose-sharks/"">San Jose Sharks</a> in a 5-2 victory on Wednesday night. This marked Robertson's first multipoint match since Oct. 19, reinforcing his key role in the Stars' lineup.</p>
<h2>Key Players in the Stars' Victory</h2>
<p>Roope Hintz and Wyatt Johnston were also instrumental in the Stars' victory, each contributing a goal and an assist. Jamie Benn and Evgenii Dadonov further bolstered the scoreline for the Stars. Jake Oettinger, the Stars' goalie, had a busy night with 20 saves, extending his flawless 7-0-0 home record and conceding only 10 goals in total.</p>
<h2>Sharks' Effort Falls Short</h2>
<p>The Sharks put up a spirited fight, with Mikael Granlund achieving a short-handed goal and his 400th career assist. Jake Walman added to the Sharks' tally, while goalie Mackenzie Blackwood stopped 26 shots. However, their efforts were insufficient to fend off the Stars' offensive onslaught.</p>
<h3>Turning Points and Highlights</h3>
<p>With 6:35 remaining on the clock in the third period and the Sharks trailing by a narrow margin, Hintz and Dadonov sealed the Stars' victory with empty-net goals in the final 90 seconds. Robertson opened the scoring for Dallas with less than five minutes remaining in the first period and assisted Johnston's goal just 56 seconds into the second period, securing a 2-1 lead for the Stars.</p>
<h3>Injuries and Updates</h3>
<p>Granlund left the ice after being hit high by Ilya Lyubushkin with three minutes left in the match. His condition remained uncertain as Coach Ryan Warsofky did not provide an update post-match.</p>
<h2>Takeaways and Key Stats</h2>
<p>The Sharks' <a href=""https://21sports.com/macklin-celebrinis-overtime-goal-fuels-san-jose-sharks-victory-over-detroit-red-wings/"">Macklin Celebrini</a>, the recent No. 1 overall draft pick, managed a single shot on goal, split 14 faceoffs, and drew a penalty. The Stars' home power play continues to struggle, failing to convert any of their four opportunities and even conceding a goal. They now sit at 2 for 27 (7.4%), with their last 14 power plays yielding no goals.</p>
<p>Despite this, the Stars boast an impressive 8-2 home record, with one loss occurring during the Global Series played in Finland as the designated home team.</p>

<h1>Fraser Minten Shines in NHL Debut as Leafs Shutout Golden Knights</h1>
<p>In an electrifying display of skill and perseverance, rookie Fraser Minten netted his first NHL goal, propelling the injury-plagued <a href=""https://21sports.com/marner-propels-maple-leafs-to-victory-over-canadiens-a-hockey-night-recap/"">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> to a decisive 3-0 victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/vegas-golden-knights-triumph-over-edmonton-oilers-hanifins-double-steals-the-show/"">Vegas Golden Knights</a> on Wednesday night. With a power-play strike at the 3:01 mark in the third period, William Nylander chalked up his 13th goal of the season. The scoring was rounded off by Pontus Holmberg's empty netter, further sealing the Leafs' domination.</p>
<h2>Woll's First Shutout of the Season</h2>
<p>Joseph Woll, the Leafs' goaltender, was in fine form, deflecting all 31 shots on goal, earning his maiden shutout of the season. On the other end of the rink, Vegas' goalie, Adin Hill, put up a solid defense with 23 saves. The victory marks Toronto's sixth win in their last seven outings, while Vegas suffered its second consecutive defeat, delaying coach Bruce Cassidy's 400th career win.</p>
<h2>Matthews and Stone: Captains Absent from the Rink</h2>
<p>Both teams battled it out sans their captains – Toronto's Auston Matthews sidelined due to an upper-body injury, missing his seventh consecutive game, and Vegas' Mark Stone, out with a lower-body injury, absent for his sixth match. The Leafs' roster was further depleted with the absence of Max Domi, David Kampf, Max Pacioretty, and Calle Jarnkrok. Simultaneously, Ryan Reaves began serving his five-game suspension for an illicit check to the head against Darnell Nurse of the Oilers.</p>
<h3>Game-Changing Moment</h3>
<p>The match's dynamics took a turn when Leafs' forward Matthew Knies was floored by a mid-ice hit from Zach Whitecloud in the second period, right in front of the Leafs' bench. Whitecloud escaped without a penalty for the crippling hit but received a minor roughing penalty for his altercation with Simon Benoit of the Leafs, who earned a four-minute penalty for his attempted retribution. The game's intensity escalated post this incident. Unfortunately, Knies, suffering an upper-body injury, did not return to the match.</p>
<h3>Key Statistic of the Game</h3>
<p>The Leafs successfully fended off the NHL's second-best power play unit, restricting Vegas to 0 for 3 on their power plays.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>The Toronto Maple Leafs are preparing to conclude a three-match homestand on Sunday, facing off against the Utah Hockey Club, while Las Vegas is set to continue its five-game road trip in Ottawa on Thursday.</p>

The highly-rated midfielder has impressed despite coming into the season off the back of two underwhelming campaigns. Gravenberch had a disappointing season at Bayern Munich in 2022-23 after leaving Ajax and only managed 12 Premier League starts for Liverpool after his £35million move last year.   The 22-year-old has thrived this season under Arne Slot, a fellow Dutchman, having been deployed in a deeper role in Liverpool’s midfield.  Gravenberch’s change of role had followed Liverpool’s failed pursuit of Real Sociedad’s Martin Zubimendi in the summer transfer window. Man United legend Neville cited Gravenberch’s impressive performances, coupled with his change of role, as being behind his selection.      Ryan Gravenberch has starred for Liverpool operating in a deeper midfield role this season      Gary Neville said his displays in the position made Gravenberch his surprise player   ‘I am going for Graveneberch in terms of how he has played and the position he has played,’ Neville said on Stick to Football, brought to you by Sky Bet. ‘I feel quite strongly Gravenberch is a massive surprise in terms of how well he has played.  ‘I don’t think anyone expected him to be as good as he has been in that position [in midfield]. Curtis Jones has been very good too.’ Gravenberch would ultimately finish as the third biggest surprise after a discussion with Man United legends Roy Keane and Paul Scholes, Arsenal great Ian Wright and Lionesses hero Jill Scott.  The goalscoring form of Nottingham Forest star Chris Wood and Ipswich forward Liam Delap saw them edge ahead of Gravenberch. ‘Chris Wood with eight goals has got to be in the top three, Liam Delap with six goals for Ipswich,’ Neville added. ‘I’m not surprised by Danny Welbeck, he’s very good – his current form is better than any current [Manchester] United front player this season. Morgan Rogers at [Aston] Villa could be top notch.      Liam Delap, centre, was also highlighted having struck six times for newly promoted Ipswich   ‘I’d go Wood top, Delap number two and Gravenberch in three.’  Wright had highlighted Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo and Brighton’s Carlos Baleba as other potential options. The former Arsenal forward also put forward Brentford forwards Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo. Wright praised the duo for their performances, which he suggested have meant the Bees have not felt a significant impact of selling Ivan Toney.

Sportsdark,Dana White makes shock political U-turn after backing Donald Trump in the election,https://sportsdark.com/mma/dana-white-makes-shock-political-u-turn-after-backing-donald-trump-in-the-election/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 23:21:00 +0000","Dana White was a quasi-permanent fixture on Donald Trump&#8217;s campaign trial as he threw his full support behind the Republican candidate in his bid to seek re-election.  The UFC president, who is close friends with the 78-year-old, has been such an ardent supporter that he even stole the limelight during Trump&#8217;s victory celebrations at Mar-a-Lago [&#8230;]","Home - MMA News - Dana White makes shock political U-turn after backing Donald Trump in the election           Dana White was a quasi-permanent fixture on Donald Trump’s campaign trial as he threw his full support behind the Republican candidate in his bid to seek re-election.  The UFC president, who is close friends with the 78-year-old, has been such an ardent supporter that he even stole the limelight during Trump’s victory celebrations at Mar-a-Lago after beating Kamala Harris at the ballot box.   But now that Trump has sealed his return to the White House, the UFC chief wants nothing to do with the president-elect’s second term – or politics at all.    ‘I’m never f***ing doing this again,’ he told The New Yorker. ‘I want nothing to do with this s***. It’s gross. It’s disgusting. I want nothing to do with politics.’ It appears the GOP will not be able to rely on White for endorsement in the future with his alliance extending to Trump, and Trump alone.  With Trump’s presidential campaign marking the first and last foray into politics for White, it is no real surprise that the 45th president is the sole recipient of White’s political backing.        Dana White was a quasi-permanent fixture on Donald Trump’s campaign trial this year      But now the president-elect has sealed re-election, the UFC chief has sworn off politics White has been a long-time friend and ardent supporter of Trump with the former president echoing the support in his backing of UFC over the years. Trump tapped the UFC President and CEO to speak for him at the last three Republican National Conventions before inviting him to the onstage victory party following this month’s election triumph. White was invited to say a few words at the podium on the stage, and after some glowing praise for Trump, launched into what seemed to be a victory speech of his own. And the UFC president continued to praise Trump this week, hailing him as one of the toughest men he knows.  ‘Donald Trump is tougher and more badass than anybody,’ White also told The New Yorker. ‘You can only pray that you’re a quarter of the man that Donald Trump was when a guy tried to take seven shots at his head with a high powered rifle with a fucking scope on it.’  And Trump has reciprocated White’s support over the past few decades, publicly backing the UFC – even claiming to be its savior.  Trump has regularly attended fight nights, most recently arriving cageside at Madison Square Garden for UFC 309 with Elon Musk and White in tow last weekend.  ‘As the UFC has grown, there’s been a lot of people that have jumped on the bandwagon and became fans,’ White said. ‘Trump was there from the beginning.’       78-year-old Trump has been an avid supporter of White’s UFC throughout the years       Jon Jones celebrated his victory with Trump, who attended the UFC event on Saturday  Trump basked in his post-election glory at the UFC event – the first since his re-election – when American fighter Jon Jones appeared to dedicate his victory to the president-elect. Jones emerged victorious in front of the president-elect at Madison Square Garden where he got into the patriotic spirit after a knockout win over Stipe Miocic . Jones and Trump shook hands and capped a fight night charged with politics as much as punches inside a raucous MSG where ‘USA!’ chants echoed through the arena. ‘A big, big thank you to President Donald Trump for being here tonight,’ Jones said inside the cage before presenting Trump with the belt and imitating the president-elect’s now-iconic arm-shimmy dance. ‘I’m proud to be a great American champion. I’m proud to be a Christian-American champion.’ After leaving the cage, the UFC Heavyweight champion made his way over to where Trump was sitting with Musk and handed him his championship belt.

The former midfielder, 38, only took charge of the second tier Cypriot side Ayia Napa on October 29. He oversaw two 1-0 victories during his short tenure before his departure was announced on Tuesday after 21 days with the club.   The abrupt exit of the former top flight star raised eyebrows, but the reasons have become clearer now he has secured a new job. The figure, who is former Southampton, Millwall and Crystal Palace midfielder Jason Puncheon, has been appointed by Akritas Chlorakas as their new manager.  Akritas also play in the Cypriot second tier and sit one point and one place above Ayia Napa.      A Premier League cult hero has made a swift return to coaching after he left his previous role      Jason Puncheon exited Cypriot second tier side Ayia Napa after only two games on Tuesday      But, he has jumped straight back into coaching, taking over league rivals Akritas Chlorakas In a statement announcing his arrival, the club said: ‘We are excited to officially welcome Jason Puncheon as the new head coach of Akritas Chlorakas. ‘With his extensive experience as a player in top leagues and his leadership qualities, we are confident that he will bring fresh ideas, determination, and a winning mentality to our team. ‘Jason has shown his passion for football throughout his career, and we are thrilled to have him bring that same energy to Akritas Chlorakas.  ‘Together, we are ready to face the challenges ahead, work hard, and achieve great things. ‘Let’s give Jason a warm welcome to the Akritas family and show our support as he begins this new journey with us. Here’s to a successful and exciting chapter for Akritas Chlorakas.’ The new role will be the fourth managerial job of Puncheon’s career and comes after his exit from Ayia Napa was announced two days ago, with reports in Cyprus claiming the 38-year-old had bought out his contract to make the move. In a statement posted on Instagram on Tuesday, Ayia Napa – who are based in the famous party resort – had said:  ‘Ayia Napa Sports Club announces the mutual consent termination of its cooperation with coach Jason Puncheon. ‘Assistant coach Christos Tsapatsoulis also left our team. The board wishes both the best in their professional careers.’      Puncheon will manage his fourth different club in Cyprus after ending his playing career there      Puncheon was best known for his time at Palace and won both his games with Ayia Napa   Puncheon’s first match with Ayia Napa saw them beat Achyronas-Onisilos 1-0 away from home, before they defeated Doxa Katokopias by the same scoreline a week later. The back-to-back victories saw Puncheon’s former side rise from third bottom in the 16-team table up to ninth, with Ayia Napa having previously won just one of their six league games before the 38-year-old’s arrival.    Puncheon’s arrival at Akritas meaning he has now coached four clubs in Cyprus after also ending his playing career in the country. Puncheon’s first managerial stint saw him win eight of his 18 games in charge of Peyia 2014, although he spent only six months in the role. Puncheon then lasted less than a month at AEZ Zakakiou between February and March 2024, failing to win any of his seven matches at the helm.   Speaking to Mail Sport earlier this year, Puncheon revealed why he opted to move to Cyprus as his playing career came to a close in 2019.  ‘I had Championship options but Cyprus gave me a chance to play for a team that was fighting for something and having a good life with my family. It was an option I wanted to take,’ he said.  ‘Footballers should look at these opportunities and take them more than we turn them down because there’s so much to learn.      Puncheon previously urged others players to move abroad to gain opportunities in coaching, while crediting his former boss Alan Pardew with inspiring him to become a manager ‘It was route into coaching for me because the reality is I’m not Steven Gerrard or Wayne Rooney. ‘Maybe Crystal Palace would have said to me at the end of playing career ‘come and take the U15s’. ‘But I thought if I go to Cyprus and make a name for myself it may be easier for me to step into coaching which as always the end goal. ‘Whereas in England, once I retired I would maybe be waiting forever.’ After completing his UEFA A and B badges alongside Juan Pablo Angel, Djimi Traore and Carlton Cole, Puncheon put his decision to move into coaching down to former Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew.  The 38-year-old – who retired from playing in 2023 – spent nine seasons in the Premier League and enjoyed his most productive spell with Palace, netting 16 goals and adding 21 assists in 169 matches for the Eagles.  Arguably his most memorable contribution to the south London outfit was his opening goal in their 2016 FA Cup final defeat by Manchester United.  Puncheon also had spells with the likes of Huddersfield, Southampton, Plymouth, Barnet and MK Dons as well as three clubs in Cyprus. His abrupt departure from his most recent role means Ayia Napa are left searching for their third manager of the season.   In total, Puncheon has won 10 of his 27 games in the dugout and kicks of his Akritas tenure with a trip to Achyronas-Onisilos on Saturday.

Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca revealed at his press conference on Thursday that James will not be available for Saturday’s match with Leicester due to struggling with a hamstring problem. James has only played 654 minutes of football since being named Chelsea captain 15 months ago, and is now set for another spell on the sidelines.   But he gave a defiant message to his social media followers on Thursday night as he thanked fans for their support and vowed to overcome his injury blow. The England full back wrote on Instagram: ‘This message is to the people that understand & have respect for what I’m going through… I appreciate you so much, your support and kind words go further than you could ever imagine. ‘And just to touch on me… I’m doing okay, been better and also been worse. Another challenge ahead accepted. Eventually I’ll come out on top. Against all odds.’      Reece James has thanked fans and vowed to bounce back after his latest injury blow      Enzo Maresca revealed he will be without his captain for this weekend’s trip to Leicester      James has suffered multiple injury setbacks in recent years, and is now sidelined again The severity of James’ injury is yet to be determined, although Maresca appeared to indicate that his absence this weekend is a precaution and he could return to the pitch shortly. Maresca said: ‘He felt something. ‘He has to be out, for sure this weekend, and then we’ll see. At the moment we don’t know how long. We’ll see. ‘I know it’s not easy, but if every time he is getting an injury it becomes hard for him, for me it’s even worse. He has to accept that. He has to try to avoid it as much as he can. ‘But sometimes things happen, even if you want to avoid them. This weekend he’s not available. Unfortunately he felt something small. It’s a hamstring. It’s a muscle problem. We don’t want to take any risks for this weekend.’ James has endured a torrid time with injuries in recent years, and has missed the last two major tournaments with England after being unable to prove his fitness. He was also sidelined at the start of this season, and Maresca admitted last month that James is only capable of playing one match a week due to his ongoing physical struggles. James subsequently started three straight league matches against Liverpool, Newcastle and Manchester United, but was dropped to the bench for Chelsea’s last game before the international break as Maresca preferred the full back pairing of Malo Gusto and Marc Cucurella in the 1-1 draw with Arsenal. Gusto and Cucurella look set to start once more when Chelsea return to Maresca’s former club Leicester in Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off. Your email address will not be published.

Mularkey’s Titans went 9-7 during the 2017 regular season before losing to the Patriots in the divisional round of the playoffs. And while he knew that defeat would spell the end of his time in Tennessee, he told NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport that he was actually about to get a contract extension, as he revealed in a new interview.   ‘The best thing I did there at the end… was when I got called in that Monday morning after the New England game. I knew they were going to fire me,’ Mularkey began on Action Sports Jax’s ‘Brent & Austen’, per A to Z Sports. ‘So Sunday night, I called Ian Rapoport, and I said, ‘Hey, I don’t know if you know this, but I’m going to break it to you – I’m getting a new contract in the morning.’      Mike Mularkey is seen after the Titans lost the divisional round game to the Patriots in 2019      Ian Rapoport was told by Mularkey that he was getting a new deal, and reported as such

It was all over the country [that] I was getting [a] contract, knowing that I was going to get fired, but I just wanted to see the faces on the owner and the GM who was out to get me. And I’m pretty sure I got him for for a minute or two. When I walked in the next morning, there wasn’t a whole lot of conversation.’ Mularkey did in fact get fired from his Titans role, but not before Rapoport tweeted the coach’s misinformation out to his followers. Rapoport’s tweet was retweeted more than 2.2k times and received 2.4k likes. Notably, Rapoport had reported earlier that January that Mularkey could lose his job if the Titans lost to the Chiefs in the wild card round. Tennessee won that game but didn’t get any further as they fell to Tom Brady and the Patriots at the next stage. Mularkey, who also coached the Bills and Jaguars before getting to Tennessee, was last in the NFL in 2019 as the Falcons’ tight ends coach. Your email address will not be published.

Players are kept under close watch during road trips, as they are technically out of town on business like anyone else.       Taylor Swift cannot stay with Travis Kelce the night before every Kansas City Chiefs road game      There is no edict on who Chiefs players can have stay with them the night before home games  It is NFL players’ wives who get to enjoy the towns where their partners are playing, not those participating on the gridiron.  Chiefs players are also not allowed to drink alcohol the night before games, as that’s a privilege bestowed upon their WAGs to do for them if they choose.   Breaking any of these rules can result in fines or other punishments at the team’s discretion.  Even being late to team meetings can get players fined, with walkthroughs and last-minute coaching common before every game.  There is no edict for guests staying over before home, which could be part of the reason Swift has attended every Chiefs game at Arrowhead Stadium this season.   Your email address will not be published.

The 39-year-old arrives in Manchester with a stunning resume from his time in his native Portugal but more established managers have tried and failed at Old Trafford since Ferguson’s 2013 exit.  Ahead of the Portuguese’s first match against Ipswich, Mail Sport looks back at the first result of every Red Devils manager since the Scot waved goodbye to the United faithful.      Ruben Amorim will be the 10th manager to take charge of a Manchester United game since Sir Alex Ferguson left      The Red Devils travel to Ipswich to take on Kieran McKenna’s side, buoyed by their first win of the season      United are on a run of four games unbeaten and sit just four points outside the top four, despite being way down in 13th Dubbed ‘the Chosen One’ after Ferguson’s retirement, Moyes won his first game as United manager against Wigan. After winning the 2012-13 Premier League title, United faced the Latics in the Community Shield at Wembley, with a brace from Robin Van Persie securing Moyes’ only trophy for the Red Devils via a 2-0 victory. Less than a week later, the Scot also won his opening Premier League game with a 4-1 victory over Swansea City. However, United’s early promise under Moyes faltered and in April 2014, United sat seventh in the league and were eliminated from every other competition. Moyes was subsequently relieved of his duties just 10 months into a six-year contract. Result – Man United 2-0 Wigan       David Moyes won the Community Shield in his first game in charge, with United beating Wigan   As United’s most-capped player of all time, Giggs was appointed as a player-coach after Moyes was sacked. His first game ended in a triumphant 4-0 victory over Norwich in the Premier League. Braces from Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata capped off a dominant performance at Old Trafford. The Welshman made his 963rd and final appearance for the club after substituting himself on for Tom Lawrence in a 3-1 win over Hull City during his time in charge.  Giggs managed just four games for United, compiling a record of two wins, a draw and a loss. He was appointed as assistant manager the following season but left the club in 2016. Result – Man United 4-0 Norwich City       Ryan Giggs enjoyed a short stint as interim boss and won his first game against Norwich 4-0 Van Gaal was appointed by United in May 2014, becoming their first ever non-British or Irish manager. The Dutchman lost his first game in charge, a 2-1 defeat in the Premier League by Swansea. This was United’s first home loss against the Welsh side since 1931. Van Gaal came armed with 23 years of managerial experience, having previously coached the likes of Barcelona and Bayern Munich. However, despite winning the FA Cup in his second season, a fifth-place Premier League finish led to his sacking in May 2016. Result – Man United 1-2 Swansea City       Louis van Gaal’s tenure got off to the worst possible start as United were beaten by Swansea In typical Mourinho fashion, the ‘Special One’ led United to a trophy in his first game as manager as his side beat reigning Premier League champions Leicester 2-1 in the 2016 Community Shield. Goals from Jesse Lingard and new signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic marked the start of the Mourinho era for the Red Devils. He also enjoyed success in his first Premier League game, winning 3-1 away at Bournemouth, while the Portuguese went on to win the Europa League and League Cup in his first year at United. However, after a miserable run of form left his side 11 points off the top four, Mourinho was sacked a week before Christmas in 2018, midway through his third season in charge. Result – Man United 2-1 Leicester City       Like Moyes, Jose Mourinho managed to win the Community Shield in his first game in charge   Solskjaer was appointed as an interim manager the day after Mourinho was let go  and had three days to prepare for his first game against former club Cardiff, where he endured a difficult nine-month stint. In emphatic fashion, United beat them 5-1, marking the start of a fairytale run of form for the Norwegian. After winning 14 of his 19 games in interim charge, Solskjaer took over as manager on a permanent basis. He went on to lead United to sixth, third and second in the Premier League over his first two-and-a-half seasons in charge. However, despite Cristiano Ronaldo’s blockbuster return to the club in 2021, United had one of their worst starts to a Premier League season ever. Solskjaer was sacked after a disastrous 4-1 defeat by Watford, with his side languishing in seventh in the table. Result – Cardiff City 1-5 Man United       Ole Gunnar Solskjaer secured a thumping 5-1 win over Cardiff City after replacing Mourinho After serving as an assistant under Solskjaer, Carrick was named caretaker manager on November 21, 2021. United travelled to Villarreal in the Champions League just two days later. Late goals from Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho sealed a 2-0 win for the Red Devils and their advancement to the last-16 in the competition. Carrick only took charge of two more games, both in the Premier League. He drew his first league game 1-1 with Chelsea, then led his side to a 3-2 victory over Arsenal at Old Trafford. Stepping down as interim coach, he left United with immediate effect and joined Middlesbrough as permanent manager in October 2022. Result – Villarreal 0-2 Man United      Michael Carrick oversaw an impressive 2-0 victory against Villarreal in the Champions League   Rangnick was United’s top candidate as interim manager and replaced Carrick in December 2021.  His first game ended in a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace at home. He went on to lose only one of his next 10 games, before the Devils’ form dipped significantly. Rangnick’s efforts were only enough to earn a sixth-place league finish at the end of the season.  The original agreement for the German to stay at Old Trafford as consultant was abandoned, with Rangnick instead agreeing a deal to take over Austria, where he has been hugely successful. In poetic fashion, his last game at United was a 1-0 defeat by Palace in the Premier League. Result – Man United 1-0 Crystal Palace       Ralf Rangnick won his first game in charge before his brief tenure unravelled dramatically Erik ten Hag: Premier League vs Brighton      Ten Hag’s nightmare first game saw United shocked by Brighton as they were beaten 2-1 In April 2022, Ten Hag was appointed as United’s permanent manager, tasked with overseeing a major rebuild after a difficult end to the previous season under Rangnick. On August 7, he lost his first game in charge, a 2-1 league defeat to Brighton at Old Trafford.  It ensured the Dutchman endured a nightmare start after Pascal Gross’ first half doubled stunned home fans as United were completely outplayed. The following week, United were embarrassed away at Brentford, losing 4-0, with Ten Hag becoming the first United manager since John Chapman in 1921 to lose his first two games in charge. After leading the Red Devils to an eight-place finish in the Premier League finish last season, the board decided to keep him after he won the FA Cup. However, with United 14th in the league after nine games, the hammer fell on Ten Hag on Monday, as the club look to begin a new era under Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s ownership. Result – Man United 1-2 Brighton  Ruud van Nistelrooy: Carabao Cup vs Leicester City      Ruud van Nistelrooy bade an emotional farewell to Manchester Unite supporters after his unbeaten spell in charge  United had just three days until their next fixture after sacking Erik ten Hag last month. Naturally, the responsibility for leading the team in the short term fell to the Dutchman’s assistant, United legend Van Nistelrooy.  The 48-year-old, who scored 150 goals in 219 games for United between 2001 and 2006, had previously managed Eredivisie giants PSV and he showed his ease in the hot seat during his interim spell in charge.  The first of a four-game reign began with a Carabao Cup tie against newly-promoted Leicester. Despite their struggles in the Premier League, Steve Cooper’s side retain a threat and would almost certainly have caused problems for Ten Hag’s United.  But with the team now liberated of the former Ajax boss they immediately became a free-scoring outfit against and found the net five times – something they failed to do against another Premier League during Ten Hag’s reign.  The Foxes were similarly accommodating in their league fixture 10 days later, going down by the same margin. Those Old Trafford clashes with the east Midlands outfit bookended an impressive four-game spell that included a 1-1 draw with Chelsea and 2-0 win over Greek side PAOK.  Result – Man United 5-2 Leicester City  Your email address will not be published.
