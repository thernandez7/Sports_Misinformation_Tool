Titans head coach Bill Callahan also said Wednesday that cornerback L'Jarius Snead (quad) has been ruled out for a sixth straight game.  The Titans (2-8) are preparing for their game at the Houston Texans (7-4) on Sunday.  Ridley, 29, had four catches for 58 yards last week, giving him 36 catches for 541 yards and three touchdowns on the season.  Spears was injured late in Sunday's loss to the Minnesota Vikings. He'll have to be cleared from the concussion protocol to play against the Texans.  Spears, 23, rushed three times for 0 yards and caught 2 passes for eight yards on Sunday. In seven games this season, he has 161 yards one touchdown on 43 carries and 17 receptions for 88 tards. Callahan also said that tackle Leroy Watson (back) is not expected back this week and that the team will open the practice window for cornerback Chido Awuzie (groin) next week.  Sneed, 27, hasn't played since an Oct. 13 loss to visiting Indianapolis. He has 23 tackles in five games (all starts) this season.

The No. 7 Crimson Tide and the Sooners will square off for the first time as Southeastern Conference rivals on Saturday in Norman, Okla. Alabama (8-2, 4-2 SEC) is riding a three-game winning streak that has put Kalen DeBoer's team back into playoff contention. The Sooners (5-5, 1-5) have dropped four consecutive conference games to put their 25-season bowl streak into danger. Turnovers figure to play a significant role on Saturday. The Crimson Tide are tied for fourth nationally in turnover margin at plus-13, while the Sooners are tied for 72nd at minus-one. Alabama has forced three or more turnovers in each of its last five games, including nine interceptions. Oklahoma has turned the ball over a total of 13 times over its last five games. On Tuesday, Sooners coach Brent Venables pointed out the scoring margin off turnovers in his team's wins versus its losses. Oklahoma is outscoring opponents 63-6 off turnovers in its wins and being outscored 58-7 off turnovers in its losses. ""When you take care of the ball, again, good things will usually happen,"" Venables said. Crimson Tide quarterback Jalen Milroe presents a unique challenge for the Sooners. He is averaging 223.2 passing yards and 60.8 rushing yards per game. He's thrown for 15 touchdowns with just six interceptions and has rushed for 17 scores. ""He's, I think, back in a really good spot with trust in the guys around him,"" DeBoer said. ""There's been a little more continuity with the practice, skill players, offensive line. ... He's become more comfortable in understanding what our team needs from him to be able to win SEC football games."" The Sooners aren't nearly as settled at quarterback, although sophomore Jackson Arnold will make his fourth consecutive start since regaining the role in mid-October. Arnold fumbled three times -- losing two -- in the Sooners' 30-23 loss to Missouri on Nov. 9 heading into a bye week. One of those fumbles came near the end of the game and was returned for what ultimately was the game-winning touchdown. ""I can't fumble like that,"" Arnold said. ""Can't turn the ball over but at the same time, we've got two more games. We've got two more great teams we've got to play so we've got to put it behind us and move forward."" Arnold is hoping to have a couple targets back as a bigger part of the offense Saturday. Wide receivers Jalil Farooq and Deion Burks returned after long absences against Missouri. Burks finished with five catches for 44 yards while Farooq had two receptions for 11 yards. Venables said both could see more action against Alabama. ""They had to knock off a little bit of rust,"" Venables said. ""Certainly the volume, their play capacity wasn't what it would normally be. ... We're hoping that will continue to improve as we move forward."" DeBoer said this week that Crimson Tide starting safety Keon Sabb was out for the season after undergoing surgery. The Tide and the Sooners have met six times previously, with the last coming in December 2018 in a College Football Playoff semifinal. Alabama recorded a 45-34 win. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The","The Deion Sanders show is coming to Kansas City. Sanders and No. 16 Colorado will test their mettle against Kansas on Saturday in Kansas City, Mo. The game will be played at Arrowhead Stadium, as all of Kansas' home games this season are away from Lawrence, Kan. The Buffaloes (8-2, 6-1 Big 12) have won four straight games. If they win their last two -- including a home contest against Oklahoma State on Nov. 29 -- they will play in the Big 12 Championship Game on Dec. 7 for a spot in the College Football Playoff. But first things first. The Buffaloes likely will have their hands full with the Jayhawks (4-6, 3-4), who have won two straight games against ranked teams for the first time in school history. A week after knocking off Iowa State at Arrowhead, the Jayhawks handed BYU its first loss of the season on Saturday night with a 17-13 decision in Provo, Utah. ""I feel like our team has always done a great job being able to stay the course,"" quarterback Jalon Daniels said. ""I feel like a big staple within our program is being able to trust the process."" The Jayhawks' bowl chances seemed all-but done after they lost to Kansas State on Oct. 26 to fall to 2-6 overall. But if they knock off the Buffaloes and then win at Baylor on Nov. 30, they'll be bowl eligible. ""I have a lot of respect for Coach Sanders,"" Kansas coach Lance Leipold said Monday. ""The thing we have in common is that we've come up through the ranks. He's found a way to be successful using his own philosophy. He's built a college football team that's one of the most improved in college football in a very short period of time. ""They're a very talented team that's playing with a lot of confidence."" The Jayhawks' victory over BYU was a defensive struggle, which snapped a streak of six straight games of scoring at least 27 points. The Buffaloes have been scoring a lot of points in their four-game winning streak. They scored 34 points in back-to-back games before scoring 41 at Texas Tech and 49 against Utah last Saturday. Still, Sanders wasn't completely satisfied. ""We haven't even put it all together yet,"" Sanders said at his postgame news conference. ""Like we haven't even played our best game. That should be in itself scary. When I said (when he was hired at Colorado), 'We comin.' We still coming. We never stopped coming. We are coming, and we ain't nearly there yet."" Now, with the Jayhawks in their sights, Sanders isn't going to take anything for granted. ""They're tough, they're physical, they play a consistent game,"" Sanders said. ""That quarterback gives you problems because he's very versatile. The defense can take the ball away interception-wise and they have not given up -- regardless of what the record may state -- the last two weeks. They've knocked some people off their feet. It's going to be a tremendous task for us."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Cougars (9-1, 6-1 Big 12) will try to rebound from a 17-13 setback at home against Kansas when they visit No. 21 Arizona State (8-2, 5-2) on Saturday in Tempe, Ariz. ""I am excited to see these guys play after this,"" Sitake said Monday. ""We have faced some adversity. We have faced a loss. Now we are able to learn from it. Let's see what type of team comes out. This is a good moment for our identity to show."" Arizona State won at then-No. 16 Kansas State 24-14 last week to earn its third straight victory and fifth in the last six games. The game between the Cougars and Sun Devils is potentially for a spot in the Big 12 championship game with two weeks remaining in the regular season. Colorado (8-2, 6-1) and Iowa State (8-2, 5-2) also are in the race among conference teams with two or fewer losses. BYU was picked to finish 13th and Arizona State 16th (last) in the Big 12 in a preseason media poll. ""I feel a slight connection to them, because nobody cared about (either of) us before the season,"" Sitake said. ""To have this game be something with a lot of meaning is really cool at this point."" Arizona State coach Kenny Dillingham believes the game is significant enough that he urged fans not to sell tickets to BYU supporters. The Phoenix area, especially in the East Valley, has a large population of Mormons who are BYU fans. ""Have them show you an ASU hat or shirt or something,"" Dillingham said to Arizona State fans during his weekly press conference. Sitake called Arizona State running back Cam Skattebo one of the best in the nation at his position. He also said that BYU tried to lure Sun Devils quarterback Sam Leavitt after he left Michigan State and entered the transfer portal. Leavitt's father, Jared, was a linebacker at BYU in the 1990s. ""He comes from a good family and he's super athletic,"" Sitake said. ""He can run and has an accurate arm. I think he's got a great fit, football IQ, and he's so dangerous."" Skattebo has rushed for 1,074 yards on 198 carries with 11 touchdowns. He also has 31 receptions for 448 yards with two scores. Leavitt has thrown for 1,906 yards with 17 touchdowns and four interceptions. He has also rushed for 348 yards and four TDs. BYU lacked in red-zone production against Kansas, scoring only six points without a touchdown in four trips there against Kansas. The Cougars' only score in the second half was a 35-yard field goal by Will Ferrin. Their lone touchdown was a 30-yard pass from Jake Retzlaff to Hinckley Ropati in the second quarter. Retzlaff has passed for 2,283 yards with 19 touchdowns and eight interceptions. He has rushed for an additional 312 yards with four scores. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Georgia is No. 10 in the latest CFP Top 25 with a resume that includes two Southeastern Conference losses but also wins over No. 3 Texas, No. 11 Tennessee and No. 17 Clemson. ""I've repeatedly said I don't know what they're looking for. They can't define that, and it's not simple either,"" Smart said on the SEC teleconference Wednesday.  ""It's not. I mean, anybody could be on that committee and say, 'Well, this is what we're looking for. This is our criteria.' And there's so much that it overlaps things, and everybody debates it, and I don't have time to really waste energy on it. So, I think it's more than your nonconference games and who you play."" Manuel said the factors the committee is applying to each team include head-to-head competition, schedule strength and a more arbitrary variable, the ""eye test."" ""Well, obviously Georgia has a very good win at Texas,"" Manuel said of why the committee sees a significant gap between Texas and Georgia. ""As the committee analyzed the body of work of Texas versus where Georgia is at the present time with two losses, even to Top-25 teams, we came out that Texas was still a very strong team deserving of a 3 seed."" Smart is not clear on what the ""eye test"" entails.  ""It just seems unjust to me when you evaluate somebody's got a third-ranked defense or somebody's got a fifth-ranked defense,"" Smart said. ""Well, don't you think that third- or fifth-ranked defense (ranking) is dictated by who they've played on offense and how many top offenses they've played?  ""Because last time I checked, our offense and our defense have played the top offenses and defenses across the country. Well, you're not going to be ranked as high if you play top ones than if you play lower-ranked ones, and that's what gets me is they talk about the eye test."" Ohio State is No. 1 in scoring defense, ahead of Notre Dame (third), Texas (fourth) and Ole Miss (fifth). Ohio State is fourth in run defense, two spots behind Ole Miss and one ahead of Penn State.  Indiana is No. 2 in scoring offense behind Miami with the two teams that beat Georgia this season, Ole Miss (fourth) and Alabama (eighth), in the Top 10. ""How do you play in the game? Well, how you play in the game is dictated, No. 1, by where you're playing -- home or away -- and No. 2, who you're playing. That's the two No. 1 indicators of how you play is who you're playing,"" Smart said. ""Who you line up across from matters. But point differential, I don't know that I believe they actually look at just that. I don't know if that's actually the case.  ""They're looking at the whole picture of how you play, and that's dictated by who you play."" LSU head coach Brian Kelly said on the teleconference that the 2024 season was accepted as one that would produce a flawed sample the committee could adjust to in future years. Not only because of the expansion from a four-team playoff to 12, but because of the expansion of the four remaining football power conferences.  ""I think it's going to be heavily decided on schedule. And I think that we're going to get that historical lesson this year,"" Kelly said. ""But I think strength of schedule is going to play a major role ultimately in how this shapes itself moving forward."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""Whenever the ball is in my hands,"" he said, ""I can make a play with it."" Becht will try to keep making those plays on Saturday night when the 22nd-ranked Cyclones bid to keep their Big 12 Conference championship hopes alive in Salt Lake City against struggling Utah. After losing two straight games to fall behind BYU (9-1, 6-1) and Colorado (8-2, 6-1) in the conference, Iowa State (8-2, 5-2) needed Becht to make plays to get back on track. He threw a third-quarter touchdown to put the Cyclones ahead for good at 17-10 and added a fourth-quarter scoring run after the Bearcats trimmed their deficit to three points. Becht completed 24 of 33 passes for 234 yards while adding 48 yards on seven rushes. He comes into this week's game with 2,628 passing yards and 17 touchdowns. What Becht gets on Saturday night likely will be earned. The Utes (4-6, 1-6) have dropped six straight games but the defense hasn't been responsible for much of it, save for last week's 49-24 defeat at Colorado. Shedeur Sanders carved Utah up for 340 passing yards and three touchdowns in its first bad game of the year defensively. The Utes gave up an average of 20.4 points over their first five losses but simply haven't been able to score enough to help their defense. ""This is, bar none, the best defense that we'll play,"" Iowa State coach Matt Campbell said. ""You look at their front seven, all fifth- and sixth-year seniors, some of the best defensive players in the country at their position."" But Utah's offense simply hasn't been competent since veteran quarterback Cam Rising suffered an injury in a September win over Baylor that sidelined him for three games. Rising then was knocked out in his return game at Arizona State on Oct. 11 with what turned out to be a season-ending injury. Freshman Isaac Wilson has showed flashes of brilliance from time to time but simply hasn't played with the consistency needed to win at this level. ""Right now, I'm in the 'Twilight Zone.' It's the most difficult year of my coaching career, hands down,"" Utes coach Kyle Whittingham said. ""Not even close."" Wilson has thrown for 1,436 yards and 10 touchdowns but also has tossed 11 interceptions and completed only 54.8 percent of his attempts. Aside from running back Micah Bernard and his 880 rushing yards, the offense is starved for consistent production. Picked to win the Big 12 in July, Utah must win this week and next week at UCF just to qualify for a bowl game. ""We're just not potent enough on offense,"" Whittingham said. While the Utes scrape out 22.7 points and 353.8 yards per game, Iowa State is averaging 31.4 and 434.2, respectively. The Cyclones own a 4-1 lead in the all-time series but the teams haven't played since 2010, when Utah went to Ames and scored a 68-27 victory. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Pinellas County commissioners late Tuesday agreed to delay a vote on issuing bonds to pay for its portion of a new $1.3 billion ballpark in St. Petersburg, putting off the vote until Dec. 17. Commissioner Brian Scott, who supports the county funding as outlined in a deal made in July, made a motion to delay the vote because he sensed the issue would go down to defeat on Tuesday. Two new commissioners elected in the Nov. 5 election are believed to oppose the deal, and they replaced two that had supported it. ""Hopefully that will allow some time for our new commissioners to get up to speed on this,"" Scott told the Tampa Bay Times of the delay. Commissioner Rene Flowers was the lone dissenter in the 6-1 vote to delay the financing discussion, and she told the newspaper that she doesn't see it passing. ""I just felt that instead of, you know, having additional conversations and taking up time, let's just be forthright and let's just put our responses on the table and stand flat-footed,"" she said. ""I don't believe that additional time will change their minds."" The vote previously had been delayed because of Hurricanes Helene and Milton.  The outcome of the meeting left the Rays reeling. Earlier Tuesday, the club delivered a letter to the commissioners, informing them that the current financial terms for the stadium no longer were viable and that a new solution needed to be reached. In the letter, club presidents Brian Auld and Matt Silverman said the commission's failure to approve the financing by this point has set back the planned 2028 move-in to the ballpark, forcing the team to halt construction plans for the stadium and surrounding area. ""As we have informed the county administrator and St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch, the county's failure to finalize the bonds last month ended the ability for a 2028 delivery of the ballpark,"" the letter read. ""As we have made clear at every step of this process, a 2029 ballpark delivery would result in significantly higher costs that we are not able to absorb alone."" While team officials attended the commission meeting, they made no comment. Instead, they gave their reaction to the latest events in the letter. ""The Rays organization is saddened and stunned by this unfortunate turn of events. We have put in decades of work and spent more than $50 million to bring this historic project to reality -- a project that had been approved by the City of St. Petersburg and Pinellas County. Now, that enormous investment of human and financial capital has been jeopardized by the county's failure to live up to its July agreement."" Welch, in a statement to the Times, said he believes the July deal is still valid and the city ""will continue to work with our partners towards that successful outcome."" Pinellas County commissioners approved $312.5 million in public financing via a tourist tax in July, funded initially by bonds, but in October delayed the bond vote. The reason given was uncertainty as to where the Rays would play next season after the roof at Tropicana Field was shredded by Hurricane Milton. The Rays will play their home games in 2025 at the New York Yankees' spring training complex in Tampa. ""While we are focused on preparing for a unique 2025 season, we stand ready to work on a new solution with any and all willing partners to preserve the future of Major League Baseball in Tampa Bay for generations to come,"" Auld and Silverman wrote in the letter. The next test for the ballpark comes Thursday, when the St. Petersburg City Council is scheduled to vote on selling its own bonds to pay for its share of the stadium, area roads and sewers. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Volunteers (8-2) will close out their home slate Saturday afternoon with what will likely be an easier matchup, facing Conference USA foe UTEP (2-8) in Knoxville, Tenn. The Volunteers are looking to rebound from a 31-17 drubbing at the hands of Georgia last Saturday. Tennessee sprinted out of the gate and led 10-0 after the first quarter, however coach Kirby Smart's team found its footing and steamrolled the Volunteers. ""It's an opportunity for us to grow as a football team and continue to get better,"" Tennessee coach Josh Heupel said of facing the Miners on Senior Day. ""It's the next step forward for us."" Heupel said his players are good enough and have the type of culture to put an eighth straight setback against Georgia behind them. ""They made last week a big game because of what they've invested,"" he said. ""We're in the arena and we've got to go make it happen. ... There are areas we've got to get better. ""There are just too many instances of Tennessee hurting Tennessee on Saturday, and that's not taking anything away from Georgia. But the things that we can control, we've got to be better at."" The bad news for the Volunteers was they were tabbed 11th in the rankings, trailing fellow SEC members No. 7 Alabama, No. 9 Ole Miss and No. 10 Georgia. Tennessee will close out its season against in-state rival Vanderbilt on the road in Nashville next Saturday. The Miners have not been in many positions where they led from the outset or had a chance to win, but they did two weeks ago against Kennesaw State in a game that went past regulation. In the second overtime, Kenny Odom caught a 16-yard pass from Skyler Locklear as UTEP earned a 43-35 double overtime win over the Owls. Locklear fired four touchdown passes, Odom caught three of them and UTEP's ""Orange Swarm"" defense forced three straight incompletions to end the contest. That performance earned Locklear the conference's Offensive Player of the Week honors, while Kory Chapman was honored as the Conference USA Defensive Player of the Week. Lockler has completed 67.0 percent of his passes with nine touchdowns and five interceptions this season. Odom, in turn, has 642 receiving yards and seven touchdown receptions. The team has found itself in tight games lately: The last four outcomes -- two wins and two losses -- have all been decided by single digits. ""I'm so proud of this team, and I've been talking about perseverance all year,"" UTEP coach Scotty Walden said after the Senior Day/Homecoming win. ""That's exactly what they did; they persevered through adversity. ... We played with a lot of pride and a lot of passion.""

Georgia (8-2, 6-2 Southeastern Conference) climbed two spots in Tuesday's College Football Playoff rankings after its 31-17 win over the Volunteers last Saturday. On the heels of a 28-10 loss at Ole Miss on Nov. 9, the Bulldogs outscored Tennessee 31-7 over the final three quarters. Georgia quarterback Carson Beck delivered a much-needed 347-yard, two-touchdown performance in the win. Beck, who had thrown nine interceptions in his previous four games, was turnover-free Saturday for the first time since Oct. 5.  ""This team's been in some tough situations this year,"" Georgia head coach Kirby Smart said. ""And they've never cowered down from those opportunities. They've shown resiliency, and they've battled back."" After wrapping up its conference slate, the Bulldogs still need help in qualifying for the SEC Championship Game. Entering Saturday, Georgia sits behind a pair of one-conference loss teams in No. 3 Texas and No. 15 Texas A&M. The Bulldogs are tied with No. 7 Alabama and No. 9 Ole Miss in the loss column but would lose the tiebreaker to each of those teams. Smart dismissed the idea of worrying about hypotheticals ahead of Saturday's matchup. ""The focus is on UMass,"" Smart said. ""I mean, it really is. So, why would I put energy or time into trying to figure out what the best pathway is, including the SEC Championship, when I'm worried about UMass? I just don't think it's a quality conversation."" Georgia and Smart hope to see the injury bug go away. Leading rusher Trevor Etienne (477 rushing yards, seven touchdowns) was sidelined against Tennessee with a rib injury, while wide receiver Dillon Bell (405 receiving yards, four touchdowns) left last week's game with an ankle injury. ""No update on Dillon really,"" Smart said. ""He's got an ankle sprain. It's stable. It's not going to require any kind of surgery or anything. So, we're hopeful to get him back, and same with Trevor."" UMass (2-8) nearly pulled off its first FBS win of the season last Saturday, however a missed an extra point in overtime proved large in its 35-34 home loss to Liberty. Two days later, the school fired head coach Don Brown after compiling a 6-28 record in two-plus years in his second stint with the program. Offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Shane Montgomery will take over as interim coach for the Minutemen's last two games of the season. ""We've got two games left, two big games,"" Montgomery said. ""We still have a lot to play for. ... There's two ways you can go from here. You can either feel sorry for yourself and not improve daily, or you can keep improving. If you've watched us the last number of weeks, I think you see a team that seems to be improving. We're excited about going down to Georgia."" UMass, which has played Georgia once before -- a 66-27 loss in the season finale in 2018 -- already has faced off against a pair of SEC teams this season.

""I can't say enough of how he battled through all those different things. I really admire the way he battled through and played with that cast on,"" Sirianni said Wednesday.

Oops, the split-second of tripping over his words will be a huge postgame talking point if the Aggies (8-2, 5-1 SEC) stumble against the Tigers (4-6, 1-5). Texas A&M badly needs a win to keep its playoff hopes alive. SMU (9-1), BYU (9-1) and the Aggies are the first three teams on the outside of the playoff field after Tuesday's latest projection. Freshman quarterback Marcel Reed is very aware of what's at stake entering the pivotal stretch. ""Obviously, we're going to go into practice and prepare for this team like it's the biggest game of the year,"" Reed said of Auburn. ""And we got to win out. And this is just another step in the way we want to go."" Reed passed for a season-high 268 yards along with two touchdowns as the Aggies rolled to a 38-3 home win over New Mexico State last weekend. Defensive end Nic Scourton continues to have a big year on the defensive side with 14 tackles for loss, including five sacks. Auburn (4-6, 1-5) doesn't have any playoff scenarios to ponder as the program tries to avoid a fourth consecutive losing season. After the clash with the Aggies, the Tigers close the regular season at Alabama on Nov. 30. But first, Auburn has to beat Texas A&M or the losing season goes into the books. ""Can't wait,"" Tigers coach Hugh Freeze said. ""It'll be a tall task. They're extremely talented. It will be a good test for us."" Auburn will rely on standout running back Jarquez Hunter, who had 102 yards in last week's 48-14 rout of Louisiana-Monroe. Hunter's 11th career 100-yard outing pushed his season total to 1,015 yards. He ranks sixth all-time in Auburn history with 3,185 career rushing yards. Legendary Bo Jackson is No. 1 with 4,303. ""It's very special to me,"" Hunter said of his first 1,000-yard season. ""I tried to work in the offseason, I planned for this moment. I couldn't do it without the help of the O-line, tight ends and receivers doing a great job blocking and making sure I get to where I need to be. ""I executed off their blocks.

Ishbia told ESPN there's mutual interest in a deal that would bring both sides closer to their goal of the 14-time NBA All-Star retiring with the franchise eventually.  ""(Durant) loves being in Phoenix, we love having him,"" Ishbia told ESPN. ""He's off to an amazing start this season -- one of the MVP leaders -- and we're off to a very good start. We expect Kevin to sign an extension, be with us for the long term. We hope he finishes his career here in Phoenix. You can't sign a two-year extension this last summer, you can't do it based on the NBA rules. So we figured after the season we'll talk about it, take care of it. ""Kevin wants to be here, we want Kevin here. There's never been one grumbling of anything different."" Durant's current contract expires after the 2025-26 season. All-Star sidekick Devin Booker is in the first season of a four-year, $220 million contract extension he signed to stay in Phoenix.  Durant remains sidelined by a calf injury that has knocked him out of the Suns' lineup for the past six games. Phoenix is 1-5 without Durant after starting the season 8-1.

No. 25 Illinois attempts to reach eight wins for the second time in three seasons and inch closer to its first nine-win season since 2007 when it meets Rutgers on Saturday in Piscataway, N.J. For its part, Rutgers hopes to reach seven wins in consecutive seasons for the first time in since 2012. Illinois coach Bret Bielema appreciates what his team has accomplished. ""We have an unbelievable opportunity in front of us with Rutgers and to put ourselves in a position here at the end of the season with two games remaining. To have a lot to play for is pretty awesome,"" Bielema said. Illinois (7-3, 4-3) is coming off a 38-16 win over Michigan State last week in its home finale, finishing 6-1 at home. The defense led the way with five sacks, while running back Josh McCray scored three touchdowns and Pat Bryant totaled 135 receiving yards. Luke Altmyer threw for 231 yards, including a 57-yard touchdown pass to Bryant.  The Illini close the season against Northwestern on Nov. 30 and are heading to their second bowl game in four seasons under Bielema. Illinois was 8-5 two seasons ago but slumped to 5-7 last year for its 11th losing campaign in 12 years. The Illini are attempting to reach nine victories since it went 9-4 in 2007 and advanced to the Rose Bowl under Ron Zook. Rutgers (6-4, 3-4) went 12-22 in the first three seasons of coach Greg Schiano's second stint. The program is seeking back-to-back seven win seasons for the first time since finishing 9-4 in 2011 and 2012, its final seasons in the Big East. Rutgers is attempting to end a 40-game losing streak against ranked opponents that dates back to a 31-0 win over South Florida on Nov. 12, 2009. And Schiano sees good things ahead. ""We operate in the moment,"" Schiano said. ""If we let the future steal or the past steal from the moment, the present, that's where we get in trouble. I don't know if anybody can handle that, but we certainly can't. We're a developing program. We're on the rise."" Rutgers heads into its final home game coming off consecutive wins over Minnesota and Maryland. After earning a 26-19 win over Minnesota on Nov. 9, the Scarlet Knights followed it up with last week's 31-17 win at Maryland to become bowl-eligible. Rutgers topped 30 points for the second time in a conference game as Athan Kaliakmanis threw for 238 yards with two TD passes and Dymere Miller finished with eight catches for 107 yards for his second-highest total in both categories this season. Kyle Monangai finished with 97 rushing yards and two touchdowns. Monangai reached 1,000 yards for the second consecutive season. Rutgers will close the regular season against Michigan State on Nov. 30. Illinois leads the all-time series 5-3, including a 4-2 mark in Big Ten games. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Mustangs (9-1, 6-0) have a seven-game winning streak and are the only program in the 17-team conference without a loss in league play. The ACC champion will earn an automatic bid into the 12-team College Football Playoff. SMU is 4-0 on the road heading into its first-ever meeting with Virginia (5-5, 3-3), which has lost four of its last five games and has not won at Scott Stadium since beating Boston College on Oct. 5.  The Cavaliers need one more victory to have a shot at their first bowl game since the 2019 season. SMU was tested last week, trailing early in the third quarter before pulling out a 38-28 home win against Boston College. It was the Mustangs' third win by 10 points or less in ACC play, following a 34-27 victory at then-No. 22 Louisville on Oct. 5 and a 28-27 overtime decision at Duke on Oct. 26. ""They're the hardest ones to win,"" Mustangs coach Rhett Lashlee said. ""I think our guys did a nice job of hanging in there and understanding the only thing we've got to do is win. ... It's going to get harder and harder as the season shrinks and the games mean more."" Kevin Jennings passed for 298 yards and three touchdowns against the Eagles. Brashard Smith rushed for 120 yards and a score, surpassing the 1,000-yard mark (1,026) for the season. The unexpected challenge from Boston College reminded the Mustangs that anything can happen on Saturdays. ""The exciting thing about college football right now is every week you see somebody lose that wasn't really supposed to lose,"" SMU safety Isaiah Nwokobia said, per The Dallas Morning News. ""Any given week, you could lose if you don't come prepared."" The Mustangs will face a Virginia team that is coming off a 35-14 loss to another CFP hopeful last Saturday at Notre Dame. The Cavaliers turned the ball over five times in the first half and trailed 35-0 before backup quarterback Tony Muskett ran for two touchdowns. To have any chance of springing an upset, Virginia must take care of the football against an SMU defense that has allowed only 17 points off 17 turnovers this season. ""You can't expect to beat a top-10 team turning the ball over,"" Cavaliers coach Tony Elliott said after the loss to the then-No. 8 Fighting Irish. Elliott has a decision to make at quarterback with two games remaining: vs. SMU and then a Nov. 30 rivalry game at Virginia Tech. Anthony Colandrea was benched after throwing three first-half interceptions at Notre Dame. He has 12 touchdown passes and 11 picks in 10 starts this season. Muskett, a graduate student who started six games last season, has completed 65 percent of his passes for 367 yards with three TDs and one interception in six appearances this season. ""We're fighting, we're scrapping for postseason play,"" Elliott said. ""That's been a huge goal of ours as a team.

No formal communication or interview has taken place as of Wednesday morning, according to CBS Sports. Second-year coach Tom Herman was fired Monday after going 6-16 in his short tenure at the Boca Raton school. Lewis, 49, won two Super Bowls during a storied 17-year career with the Baltimore Ravens, who picked him in the first round of the 1996 NFL Draft. He's a 13-time Pro Bowler and seven-time First-team All-Pro who was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018.   Among other NFL records, Lewis has the most tackles and most solo tackles in league history and is the only NFL player to have at least 40 career sacks and 30 career interceptions.

No. 9 Ole Miss is one of those teams and Rebels coach Lane Kiffin is among the coaches that have figured this part out: It's better to not be part of the SEC title game than lose in it and miss the 12-team playoff field. But first, Ole Miss (8-2, 4-2 SEC) attempts to bolster its positioning when it visits Florida (5-5, 3-4) on Saturday in Gainesville, Fla. A Rebels' victory keeps the team in the SEC championship game mix. Also entering the weekend with two losses are SEC foes No. 7 Alabama, No. 10 Georgia and No. 11 Tennessee. No. 3 Texas has lost just once. The winner of the SEC title game gets a first-round bye. But that's not the part that concerns Kiffin. ""You know, the reward to get a bye versus the risk to get knocked out completely, I mean, that's a really big risk just to get a bye,"" Kiffin said. ""So I think it's ended up being a very unique situation of all postseason sports. The way that system is set up there and how you could go to (the SEC championship game) and get knocked out (of the CFP race). If you don't go, you're in."" Ole Miss has won three straight games, including a solid 28-10 home victory over Georgia on Nov. 9. The Rebels had a bye last weekend. Rebels star quarterback Jaxson Dart has thrown for 3,409 yards, 22 touchdowns and just four interceptions this season. He's also expected to have top target Tre Harris back in the fold. Harris missed the past three games due to a back injury. He has accumulated 59 receptions for 987 yards and six scores. ""Really excited to get the best receiver in the country back,"" Kiffin said of Harris. Jordan Watkins, who has caught a team-best seven touchdown passes, says every contest is in a playoff game for the Rebels. ""If we lose, we're not in playoff contention, so knowing that, we have to win in every game from here on out,"" Watkins said. ""You can see that as far as how well we're playing."" The Rebels close the regular season at home against Mississippi State on Nov. 29. Florida is coming off a 27-16 home upset of then-No. 21 LSU. Freshman quarterback DJ Lagway returned from a one-game absence due to a hamstring injury and passed for 226 yards and one touchdown. He then proclaimed the Gators are about to return to their former championship-level past under coaches such as Steve Spurrier and Urban Meyer. ""Just having the guys rally behind that and truly like we're going to change this,"" Lagway said. ""And that's the whole vibe in the locker room, that we're going to change this place and we're going to make it what it used to be."" Grand ambitions or not, Florida faces a stern test with the Rebels. ""Ole Miss has got playmakers on offense, obviously a veteran quarterback, and then defensively, they've got some disruptive players up front,"" Gators coach Billy Napier said. ""... They're in position to (make the playoffs). They've had a good year. So I think this is a good football team, a ranked opponent, and we're excited about the challenge."" Florida will look to pressure Dart and it feels better about the prospects after recording seven sacks against LSU. Linebacker Shemar James had two. Then-No. 3 Ole Miss didn't fare well in its last visit to Gainesville, getting routed 38-10 in 2015.

It's officially firing season in the NHL as teams look to save their seasons.,"The Boston Bruins became the first NHL team to fire a head coach this season, parting ways with Jim Montgomery on Tuesday. The decision, which would have been a shock six weeks ago, became inevitable as the Bruins struggled across the board. The team has faltered in scoring, defending, special teams, and discipline—falling well short of the standards set in recent seasons. Montgomery’s departure seemed imminent after a heated bench argument with captain Brad Marchand last month and his controversial decision to bench leading scorer David Pastrnak two weeks ago. Still, the optics of firing Montgomery are startling. Montgomery, who was hired before the 2022-23 season, led the Bruins to a remarkable 120-41-23 record during his tenure, including an NHL-record-setting regular season last year. Dismissing a coach with the league’s best record over the past two seasons is a rare move. Despite their struggles, the Bruins sat in a playoff position with an 8-9-3 record in what’s shaping up to be a tight race for the Eastern Conference’s second wild-card spot. Joe Sacco will take over as interim coach, but questions remain about the team’s direction and whether general manager Don Sweeney will face scrutiny. Sweeney, who has held his role since 2015, constructed a roster that lacks speed and talent and has failed to meet expectations. Many of his decisions are being second-guessed. Among them: the failure to sign No. 1 goalie Jeremy Swayman in time for training camp. Swayman’s subpar .883 save percentage reflects a disappointing start. Offseason acquisitions, including center Elias Lindholm and defenseman Nikita Zadorov, have also underperformed in their first season on lucrative long-term deals. While players such as Pastrnak, Marchand, Charlie Coyle, and Pavel Zacha have struggled, the responsibility extends beyond the bench and into the locker room. A playoff turnaround remains possible, as many Eastern Conference teams are also struggling. However, Montgomery could soon resurface elsewhere, as coaching changes may become more frequent. In the East, the Pittsburgh Penguins may consider firing Mike Sullivan as the aging roster fails to contend for a Stanley Cup. Similarly, the Detroit Red Wings, Ottawa Senators, and Buffalo Sabres—teams hoping to snap playoff droughts—are not taking full advantage of Boston’s slump, leaving Detroit coach Derek Lalonde under pressure. Elsewhere, St. Louis Blues coach Drew Bannister is on thin ice, and speculation continues around whether Nashville Predators general manager Barry Trotz could return to coaching if Andrew Brunette cannot turn the team’s season around.

The Suns are 1-5 since Durant's injury and now face a tough test from the visiting New York Knicks on Wednesday night. Alabama coach Nate Oats says he likes playing road games at tough venues -- like last week's visit to Purdue -- so he can learn more about his squad. He couldn't have liked the fact the Boilermakers operated at will in the interior and were easily the better team late in the game. The San Jose Sharks are a sparkling 6-3-2 since their horrendous 0-7-2 start. They visit the Dallas Stars, who have won 11 of 17 games so far this season. While Durant applies Tiger Balm to that calf, we will study the Suns-Knicks game as well as NHL and college hoops contests. New York has won its last three games as it begins a five-game road trip in Phoenix. The Knicks are faring well with star Jalen Brunson mixing very easily with newcomer Karl-Anthony Towns. And how about the ball sharing in Monday's 134-116 home win over the Washington Wizards? Try a stunning 37 assists against just eight turnovers. Even stern coach Tom Thibodeau said ""the unselfishness was terrific,"" but we're still having a hard time picturing him smiling. It's quite stunning how inept the Suns have been since Durant went down, as three of the five losses have been by double digits. Bradley Beal (calf) and Jusuf Nurkic (ankle) have also missed time and Beal will be absent against New York while Nurkic is questionable. Devin Booker has struggled in three of the past four games but had 44 points in the other one. Even if the real 'Book' shows up, these Suns are not in a good place and won't even cover at home.

That outing becomes more impressive when you consider San Jose was outscored 39-18 during the nine-game stretch. The Sharks won five of seven games following the span but then lost three in a row before posting a 5-4 home overtime win over the Detroit Red Wings on Monday. Macklin Celebrini, the 18-year-old phenom who was the No. 1 overall choice in the 2024 draft, scored the winner 46 seconds into overtime, and he has four goals in eight contests this season. Dallas had won three straight games before a lethargic 4-2 home loss against the Anaheim Ducks on Monday. The Stars trailed 3-0 until finally getting their first goal with 7:52 left, and Anaheim thwarted their charge.

They start the challenge Saturday afternoon when Miami (9-1, 5-1) hosts Wake Forest (4-6, 2-4) in an ACC matchup. Miami is powered by senior quarterback Cam Ward, who leads the nation in passing yards (3,494) and passing touchdowns (32).  The Hurricanes are coming off a 28-23 loss at Georgia Tech on Nov. 9, and then a bye week. Miami is 5-0 at home this season, but Wake Forest, despite its overall struggles, is 3-1 on the road. The Hurricanes, who lead the nation in scoring with an average of 45 points per game, haven't been as good on defense (57th at 23.1 ppg), and Miami coach Mario Cristobal said this week that he knows the problem. ""When you say tackling and getting off blocks, it's about alignment,"" he said. ""If you are not in the correct position, you eat it as a team."" Miami could get some help on Saturday from a pair of starter-level defensive players who appear likely to return from injury: cornerback Damari Brown and defensive lineman Elijah Alston. Brown, at 6-foot-2, is a shutdown-type corner but hasn't played since Miami's opener on Aug. 31. Alston, a fifth-year senior, has 12 career sacks. Both players have been medically cleared and are practicing. Cristobal said he expects them to play this week or next. Wake Forest, meanwhile, has allowed 30 or more points seven times this season and is 1-6 in those games. The Deacons also are 3-3 in games decided by one score. It remains to be seen if Wake Forest can stop Miami wide receiver Xavier Restrepo (934 receiving yards, 10 touchdowns) or Miami's 1-2 running back punch of Damien Martinez (676 rushing yards, eight TDs) and Mark Fletcher Jr. (444s, six). Restrepo on Saturday could reach 1,000 yards for the second straight season. And Miami's running game is a concern for Wake Forest after the Demon Deacons allowed Omarion Hampton to rush for 244 yards last week in a 31-24 loss at North Carolina. To stop Restrepo, Ward and the rest, Wake Forest's best defense might be its offense. For example, running back Demond Claiborne has the ability to help the Demon Deacons chew the clock. He ranks fifth in the ACC with 919 rushing yards and  tied for fourth with 11 rushing TDs. Another Wake Forest weapon, Taylor Morin, ranks seven in the league in receiving yards (676 yards). Wake Forest quarterback Hank Bachmeier didn't finish the North Carolina game due to an injured left shoulder. But Bachmeier - who has 14 TD passes and nine interceptions this season -- is expected to play Saturday. Overall, Wake Forest coach Dave Clawson indicated his team is capable of scoring a huge upset over Miami, which will finish the regular season at Syracuse on Nov. 30. ""As opposed to last year, we go into every game feeling we have a chance,"" Clawson said. ""We are capable of moving the ball and scoring points. We have flashes of playing well, but we haven't yet sustained a 60-minute complete game."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",It Seems Like Deion Sanders Might Actually Coach in the NFL Very Soon,https://deadspin.com/it-seems-like-deion-sanders-might-actually-coach-in-the-nfl-very-soon/,2024-11-20T15:31:00.934Z,"If there was ever a time for Coach Prime to make the jump to the NFL, it could be this offseason as several suitors are emerging to pair Deion Sanders","Imagine reading this headline just a few years ago. It truly feels like there’s growing speculation and anticipation around Deion Sanders coaching in the NFL in 2025. Before we dive too deep into all of this, let’s just put out there that Sanders leaving the Colorado Buffaloes is unlikely. He even dismissed speculation of an NFL departure. “I’ve got a kickstand down,” Sanders said. But if you’ve ever ridden a bike, you know that kickstands are not permanent. It’s rare to have the level of interest that Sanders could have this offseason, and that might be too hard for him to ignore.  The New York Jets and New Orleans Saints already need coaches. The Dallas Cowboys are going to need a coach. The New York Giants are going to need a coach.  There are several big football cities with bright lights that Coach Prime would shine in. Not to mention, the deep-pocketed Shad Khan is already eyeing Bill Belichick to coach the Jacksonville Jaguars, and if he wants a big personality, Sanders could be his man.  There’s also the Las Vegas Raiders, who just hired Antonio Pierce but could look to make a change after just one season, especially since they are an expected landing spot for Coach Prime’s son, Shedeur Sanders, who is widely expected to be a top quarterback selected in the 2025 NFL Draft. The pairing of Shedeur and Deion in the NFL is fun to speculate about, but that speculation gets even more momentum when top NFL insiders, like ESPN’s Adam Schefter, can’t ignore it. “This is just going to be an option that’s out there,” Schefter said. “This is going to be one of those options that’s going to heat up, that’s going to be in play this offseason.” As things typically go in the NFL, teams that need quarterbacks also typically need a new head coach. And there’s no denying that Deion and Shedeur made sweet music in their time together at Jackson State and now Colorado, which is currently the No. 16 team in the nation, vying for one of the last spots in the College Football Playoff. Michael Irvin told “The Herd” on Tuesday that “great sources have told him” that if Sheduer was drafted by the Cowboys, Deion would accept their head coach job. On his “2Legendary” podcast, Shedeur Sanders was discussing the Giants decision to bench quarterback Daniel Jones. Colorado receiver Drelon Miller joked that he’d like to see Sanders throwing passes to Malik Nabers next season. Shedeur didn’t comment, but he was smiling throughout the entire conversation. These conversations are only going to heat up as the NFL regular season simmers down and the coaching cycle and NFL Draft process heat up. The fact that so many big market teams and owners will only make this conversation more interesting. In just two years, Coach Prime turned Colorado from the laughingstock of college football into a legitimate Playoff contender. If there was ever a year for him to make a huge jump to the NFL, this could be the time. Copyright 2024"

But the Hoosiers are far from satisfied as they assess their good results going into Thursday evening's matchup with UNC Greensboro in Bloomington, Ind. ""We've got to get better at defending off the bounce,"" Indiana coach Mike Woodson said, ""where we're not allowing teams to play in the paint against us."" The Hoosiers (3-0) will play their fourth home game of the season and are coming off an 87-71 handling of South Carolina on Saturday. UNC Greensboro (2-1) has shown signs of good defense, including in its 99-54 romp Saturday in its most recent game against Division III North Carolina Wesleyan.  Facing Indiana will be a different task. ""Going into a hostile environment against a really good team, a really well-coached team is going to be a challenge for us,"" Spartans coach Mike Jones said. ""I'm looking forward to putting our guys in position to go in there and compete for a win."" Indiana's Myles Rice posted 23 points against South Carolina. He hit three of the Hoosiers' eight 3-point baskets. Despite the large point total against the Gamecocks, there were some voids on offense for Indiana. Woodson viewed the team's 12 assists as too few. ""We have to be better in that area,"" Woodson said. ""That won't get it (done). ... There were times we were stagnant, and the ball wasn't moving. I have to help us get better in that regard."" Rice insisted he can get the Hoosiers better organized. ""We didn't have the crispness of how we want to run the plays,"" said Rice, a transfer from Washington State. ""That's on us. Put it on me."" Indiana's backcourt is starting to jell, something Woodson said was a priority during the offseason. Three games into the season, he said he's comfortable with what he has viewed. ""Get enough guys in case someone got hurt,"" Woodson said. ""We have enough perimeter players this season. I feel good about everybody if someone goes down. I feel good that someone can step in and make basketball plays."" The Hoosiers have shown a knack for perimeter scoring, hitting 8 of 17 shots from 3-point range in the latest game after drilling six 3s in each of the first two games. The 47.1 percent clip on 3-pointers against South Carolina was a good mark, Woodson said, but it's a matter of developing consistency beyond the arc. ""We've just got to keep working at it,"" he said. Jones said the Spartans will have to be sharp defensively in dealing with the Hoosiers. ""We've got to do a better job of being more alert,"" he said. ""We're good at it. We're just not great at it yet. We've got a ways to go."" UNC Greensboro had 22 assists on 36 field goals vs. North Carolina Wesleyan, so that was a plus offensively. ""That's really the only rule we have on offense is just share the ball,"" Jones said. ""We've been emphasizing playing with a little bit more pace, and I thought we had some possessions there where we played with great pace and got some great opportunities."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Bears will have an even better gauge of their progress on Thursday night when they face No. 22 St. John's in the first round of the Baha Mar Championship in Nassau, The Bahamas. The winner of Thursday's game will play the victor of the night's second game between Virginia and No. 11 Tennessee in the championship contest on Friday. The losers on Thursday will square off in the earlier game on Friday. The Bears (3-1) head to the tournament after an impressive 104-41 win at home over Tarleton State on Sunday. Jalen Celestine scored 20 points, and freshman phenom VJ Edgecombe added 17 as Baylor rode a dominant first half to a third straight victory. Those three wins have been against No. 16 Arkansas at home and then against a pair of overmatched, mid-major teams after the Bears got steamrolled by then-No. 6 Gonzaga by 38 points to begin their campaign. Jeremy Roach drained four 3-pointers to highlight his 14-point performance against Tarleton State while Robert Wright had 12 points and nine assists. Baylor led by 43 points at halftime and cruised to the win, forcing the shorthanded Texans into 28 turnovers that the Bears converted into 46 points. The Bears twice reeled off 17-0 runs in the first half, when they outshot Tarleton 67 percent to 29.4 percent. ""We really wanted to make sure we got off to a fast start, and going 9 of 13 from 3 is just what the doctor ordered,"" Baylor coach Scott Drew said about the torrid first 20 minutes for his team. ""Second half, you're fighting human nature. We came out and lost the first media (timeout). But after that, really the last 11 minutes, we played a lot better."" Celestine, a transfer from Cal, finished one point off his career high. ""It's crazy, because going into the other three games, I wasn't missing in warm-ups and I couldn't hit anything,"" Celestine said. ""(Against Tarleton)I was just able to make some shots, and my teammates thankfully and selflessly kept giving me the ball and putting me in position to score."" The Red Storm (4-0) travel to the Bahamas to play away from the Big Apple for the first time this season, with St. John's most recent game an 85-71 victory against New Mexico on Sunday. RJ Luis Jr. amassed 21 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists to help the Red Storm repel the visitors and give coach Rick Pitino his third win in four career games coaching against his son, Richard Pitino. St. John's never trailed after the seven-minute mark of the first half. Deivon Smith added 12 of his 15 points in the first half, when the Red Storm led by as many as 16, and Kadary Richmond collected 14 points, eight rebounds, five assists and four steals. Aaron Scott had 14 points while Zuby Ejiofor added 13 to go with 10 rebounds for St. John's. ""I think we have greatness potential,"" Rick Pitino said. ""But we're just solid now. We're a good, solid team. You have all new players. You're not supposed to be great in November."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Now riding a three-game home winning streak, the Blazers will try to show they can be successful on the road as well. On Wednesday night, Portland will begin an important five-game road trip against the Oklahoma City Thunder. ""Obviously, we're about to go out on a monster road trip,"" Blazers coach Chauncey Billups said. ""But I don't care what happens -- I just want us to play right and continue to get better."" The first four games of the trip will come against teams with winning records going into Wednesday's action -- the Thunder, two games against the Houston Rockets, and then the Memphis Grizzlies. ""We're playing with a lot of confidence right now,"" Portland forward Kris Murray said. ""Guys are playing together and playing the right way. We just want to continue building upon that."" The Blazers are 2-4 on the road this season and 6-8 overall. ""We've got to figure it out on the road,"" forward Deni Avdija said. ""I feel like we gotta do some more things together and build our chemistry and take care of our body better."" A big piece of Portland's recent success has been the team's bench. More than 43 percent of the Blazers' scoring during their winning streak has come from their reserves, including 58 of their 114 points in Sunday's four-point win over Atlanta. Dalano Banton had a season-high 23 points in that victory. Portland had not won three games in a row in more than a year prior to this stretch. Oklahoma City, meanwhile, is coming off a 110-104 loss at San Antonio on Tuesday night, giving the Thunder back-to-back losses for the first time this season. That game started a stretch in which the Thunder will play 11 of 14 games on the road, making it crucial to have success at home. Oklahoma City is still adjusting to its limited size after 7-foot-1 Chet Holmgren broke his pelvis -- an injury that will keep him out at least two months. Injuries have kept Isaiah Hartenstein and Jaylin Williams out thus far. One of the Thunder's other two Williamses -- Jalen -- has helped pick up the slack, moving to the center role. In five games without Holmgren, Jalen Williams is averaging 25.4 points per game and is shooting 54.8 percent from the floor. ""The list of things that guy does -- and it doesn't matter what position you put him at -- all this is doing is highlighting those things and just showing that you can stress him about as far as you can possibly stress him,"" Oklahoma City coach Mark Daigneault said of Williams. Wednesday's game will be the second of four meetings between the teams this season. Oklahoma City won the first matchup 137-114 on Nov. 1 in Portland. The Blazers hope guard Anfernee Simons can return Wednesday after he missed the past two games with an undisclosed illness. Simons, who left Portland's Nov. 12 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves due to shortness of breath, is listed as questionable. Center Deandre Ayton is listed as doubtful with a right finger sprain. The Thunder could be without guard Isaiah Joe for the second consecutive game with a left calf contusion.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Cavaliers, who won a franchise-record 15 games to start the season before losing to the host Boston Celtics 120-117 on Tuesday night, will host the reeling Pelicans, who were embarrassed in Dallas by the Mavericks 132-91 the same night. The Cavaliers, just the fourth team in NBA history to begin a season with 15 consecutive wins, trailed the defending NBA champion Celtics by as many as 21 points before getting within two points in the third quarter. Ultimately, Cleveland came up short for the first time in the campaign. ""We're going to continue to fight,"" said guard Donovan Mitchell, who led the Cavaliers with 35 points against Boston. ""This was a great test for us, and unfortunately we didn't get the win. It was fun. When you're playing good basketball and winning games, you enjoy these moments. It's great to be a part of history. ""We wish we could have kept it going, but there are no championships won in November. (Our next) goal is to not lose two in a row."" Evan Mobley posted 22 points, 11 rebounds and six assists for Cleveland, but second-leading scorer Darius Garland had just eight points after shooting 3-for-21 from the floor and missing all six of his 3-point attempts. The Celtics took control by outscoring the Cavaliers 39-28 in the second quarter to take a 65-48 halftime lead. They turned back Cleveland's comeback attempt and never relinquished the lead. ""That big second quarter was too much to overcome,"" Cleveland coach Kenny Atkinson said. The Pelicans' first quarter Tuesday also was too much to overcome. New Orleans fell behind 44-29 after one period and never led during its eighth loss in nine games. The Pelicans allowed the Mavericks to score at least 34 points in three different quarters. ""We came out lackluster,"" New Orleans coach Willie Green said. ""We've got to get off to a better start."" Trey Murphy III put up a season-high 19 points and Brandon Ingram added 17 for the Pelicans, who shot 39.7 percent from the floor and committed 21 turnovers. ""We just got beat,"" Green said. ""There's no way around it. Our guys played hard, but they just got beat. They beat us. They beat us across the board. No excuses on our part. We'll grow from this and learn from this."" The game Wednesday will complete the season series two weeks after the Cavaliers reached 9-0 for the first time in franchise history with a 131-122 victory in New Orleans. Mitchell poured in 29 points, Jarrett Allen added 16 points and 14 rebounds, and four other Cavaliers logged double-figure scoring totals in a balanced scoring effort for Cleveland. For the Pelicans, Zion Williamson finished with 29 points and Jose Alvarado added 27, but both of them have since been injured, joining Dejounte Murray, CJ McCollum, Herbert Jones and Jordan Hawkins on the sideline. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The 76ers were unable to hold onto a 19-point lead in a 106-89 road loss to the Miami Heat, and the collapse prompted a team meeting that delayed coach Nick Nurse's postgame media conference for nearly an hour on Monday. ""Offense lets us down and puts our defense in a bind,"" Nurse said.  He added, ""The defense, there's a lot of good things happening out there ... even considering we're playing at such a disadvantage."" Multiple issues have contributed to the disappointing results. Guard Tyrese Maxey has missed six consecutive games with a strained right hamstring. He possibly could return against Memphis. Nine-time all-star Paul George has played in only seven of the team's 13 games as he recovers from a left knee injury. Joel Embiid, the 2023 NBA MVP, missed the first six games of the season due to knee injury management. He has appeared in only three games and is producing just 14.7 points and 6.3 rebounds per contest. In addition, ESPN reported that Maxey called out Embiid in the postgame meeting regarding chronic tardiness to team activities. Maxey, George and Embiid have not played together in a game this season. Despite those developments, Nurse is seeing encouraging signs. He said the 76ers ""generated some of the best shots we've had all year. ... We got to the rim some (and) we were totally open for threes."" Unfortunately for Philadelphia, those 3-pointers weren't falling against Miami. ""I'm just trying to reiterate some of the things we need to improve on (like) moving the ball, staying with execution and getting guys to believe they are better shooters and better scorers than they are showing right now,"" Nurse said. ""We need them to step up and see that."" Embiid finished with 11 points, eight rebounds and five assists in 31 minutes against the Heat after being listed as questionable due to an illness. In the three games he has played, the 76ers are 0-3. Memphis has encountered some injury difficulties of its own. Two-time All-Star guard Ja Morant has been out the past six games due to a right hip injury. Rookie big man Zach Edey tweaked his left ankle on two occasions Sunday in a home win over the Nuggets, then missed a game for the first time as a pro in the Tuesday rematch vs. Denver. Marcus Smart missed both games against the Nuggets with an illness, and key reserve Vince Williams Jr. left the Tuesday game with an ankle injury and didn't return. With that abundance of absences, the Grizzlies lost 122-110 on Tuesday and trailed by as many as 25 in the second half. Grizzlies reserve forward Santi Aldama did his best to keep the depleted team in the game. He tied his career high with 28 points in a fast-paced offense that the team is acclimating itself to, plus contributed 11 rebounds. ""I think we're learning this, and now it's like we're seeing different ways in which teams are guarding it,"" Aldama said. ""On paper, it's all good. ""We just got to get together. We've had different lineups, different guys in and out. I think it's a matter of getting used to it.

However, that is the situation No. 19 Army finds itself in as it prepares to face No. 6 Notre Dame on Saturday evening at Yankee Stadium in New York. Army coach Jeff Monken said he understood his team's underdog status. The Black Knights (9-0) have more players from Texas than from any other state, he said, and zero of those players received a scholarship offer to play at North Texas. Now, compare North Texas with Notre Dame (9-1), a blue-blood program filled with four- and five-star recruits. Monken said it was easy to recognize a difference in terms of pure talent. ""It's really hard to win a college football game, and it's hard at Army to win a football game,"" Monken said. ""So our guys have to embrace the fact that we have to execute our assignments and fundamentals at a really high level and try to do that better than anybody else does. ... ""We have to practice and play with absolute exactness because if we don't, we're going to get embarrassed. That's who we are. I embrace that. That does not mean we're void of talent. We've got talented players on our team. But more talented than Notre Dame, collectively as a football team? No."" In terms of fundamentals, Army has been stellar. The Black Knights are one of three undefeated FBS teams remaining, along with No. 1 Oregon and No. 5 Indiana, and they have the nation's longest winning streak at 13 games dating to last season. Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman believes Army's success was hard-earned. ""I told the coaching staff, I think it's our toughest challenge to date,"" Freeman said. The Fighting Irish carry an eight-game winning streak into the prime-time matchup, including a 35-14 victory against Virginia last week. They have outscored opponents 380-114 this season. Riley Leonard leads Notre Dame with 1,789 passing yards and 12 touchdowns to go along with 641 rushing yards and 13 scores on the ground. Jeremiyah Love has 720 rushing yards and 12 scores, and Beaux Collins has 30 catches for 390 yards and two TDs. Freeman praised his team for its tenacity, as the Fighting Irish have not trailed in the second half during the streak. ""It's like, is this play the most important play of the game?"" Freeman said. ""And that's a mindset. Don't worry about the score -- don't care what the score is. You could be up, you could be down, it doesn't matter. This play is the most important play of the game, and that takes effort and focus to do, right? ""It's not natural. It's natural to let up. It's natural to say, 'OK, here's a score, it's not that serious. This play doesn't matter.' But the guys on the field have to have a conviction that this play is so important to get the outcome that we want in the game."" Army is led by Bryson Daily, who has thrown for 644 yards and seven touchdowns and has rushed for 1,062 yards and 21 TDs. Kanye Udoh is the next-leading rusher with 856 yards and nine scores. Notre Dame holds a 39-8-4 advantage in the all-time series against Army, having won the past 15 meetings. The teams have met 23 times at Yankee Stadium, 22 of those at the original ballpark (1925-29, 1931-46, 1969) and one at the current stadium (2010). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

It's the first time the teams have met as members of the SEC, the first time the Longhorns and Wildcats have squared off on the gridiron since 1951 and only the second matchup in the programs' histories. Texas beat Kentucky 7-6 in Austin in the only other meeting. The Longhorns (9-1, 5-1 SEC) held onto the third spot in the latest CFP rankings that were revealed on Tuesday night. They head home after a 20-10 win at rival Arkansas last week that kept them tied atop the SEC standings and in the running for a bye in the CFP playoffs. Texas' defense was the story against the dangerous Razorbacks, surrendering just 231 yards (74 of those in the first half). That stinginess allowed quarterback Quinn Ewers to take what the Arkansas defense allowed as he passed for 176 yards and touchdowns early and late to Matthew Golden. Texas also got 83 yards on 13 carries from Jaydon Blue and flexed its muscle down the stretch. Up 10 points with 9:05 to play, the Longhorns forced a fumble and then held on to the ball over the final 6:55 to secure the victory, their third straight after their lone loss, at home to Georgia on Oct. 19. It will take more of the same defensive intensity to beat Kentucky. ""To watch (the defense) play the way they're playing right now has been great,"" Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said. ""They're stopping the run, they're minimizing the explosive plays. They're getting after the quarterback. They're just doing a lot of really cool things. ""I'm very proud of them, very proud of our coaching staff of what they're doing, and they're doing it at a high level."" Expect more points this time than 73 years ago, although the Wildcats (4-6, 1-6) would love for this to be a defensive battle. Kentucky needs to beat the Longhorns and then in-state rival Louisville at home on Nov. 30 to become bowl-eligible for the ninth straight season. That would be a tall task, especially the first leg of that sequence is against the stocked and hungry Longhorns. ""There's no weaknesses on (Texas),"" Wildcats coach Mark Stoops said Monday. ""(As far as) the eye test, (the Longhorns are) as strong as anybody in the country. Tell me one group (where there is a weakness). Really deep, really big. You put that together -- pretty solid team."" The Wildcats head to Austin after a 48-6 home win over Murray State that snapped a four-game losing streak, all in SEC play. Jamarion Wilcox rushed for 123 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries while Brock Vandagriff passed for 183 yards and two touchdowns for the Wildcats, who racked up 582 yards of offense, 269 of those on the ground. In the four losses prior to the win over Murray State, Kentucky was outscored 120-61. The Wildcats rank last in the SEC and 109th in the country in scoring (21.9 points per game) and 14th in the SEC and 107th in the FBS in total offense (340.5 yards per game). ""I would certainly love to have some continuity like we've had great defensive continuity, offensively,"" Stoops said. ""We have been competitive against some of the best teams in the country -- we just have to be more consistent."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

A competitive schedule might be preparing the Nittany Lions (9-1, 6-1 Big Ten) for the playoffs, but coach James Franklin remains focused solely on the Golden Gophers this week.  ""As you know, I don't love to talk about a whole lot more than Minnesota and the team that we're playing this week,"" Franklin said. ""I'm totally focused, and I want our team to be totally focused on Minnesota.  ""If I start talking about things other than Minnesota, then so do our coaches and so do the players, and we lose focus, and then we come out and don't play well."" Fair enough, but let's look at where Penn State has been of late. The Nittany Lions answered a 20-13 setback to Ohio State on Nov. 2 with convincing victories over Washington and Purdue.  Drew Allar threw three touchdowns and tight end Tyler Warren had both a receiving and rushing score in Penn State's 49-10 romp over the Boilermakers last Saturday.  Warren reeled in eight catches for 127 yards and rushed three times for 63 yards. His fourth career 100-yard receiving game tied Ted Kwalick (1966-68) for the school record among tight ends. ""Tyler Warren had a pretty high draft grade last year, came back, and I think it's been a win-win,"" Franklin said of Warren, who was named the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week for the second time this season.  ""I think he's going to be the first tight end drafted, is having a great year, is having a ton of fun with his teammates, and that's what you want, right? You want it to be a great situation for everybody."" Minnesota (6-4, 4-3) saw its four-game winning streak come to a halt with a 26-19 setback to Rutgers on Nov. 9. Former Golden Gophers quarterback Athan Kaliakmanis threw three touchdowns against his former team to lead the Scarlet Knights. Luckily for Minnesota coach P.J. Fleck, the team had two weeks to rebound from that setback.  ""Two bye weeks is really beneficial for a football team, mentally, physically and emotionally, for their health,"" Fleck said. ""Seasons are getting longer. I think our guys did a really good job of that. Not only that. We had to get better at the things we needed to get better at. Some self-scout. But it gave us a lot more time to work on Penn State as well and get a jump-start on that. ""I thought we had a really productive week of not only working on Penn State, working ahead, working on ourselves.""  Darius Taylor rushed for a touchdown in his fourth straight game but was held to just 28 yards on the ground. Max Brosmer is completing 67.1 percent of his passes for 2,251 yards with 14 touchdowns and four interceptions. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

All the No. 5 Hoosiers (10-0, 7-0 Big Ten) have to do is defeat No. 2 Ohio State (9-1, 6-1 Big Ten) in Columbus, Ohio, on Saturday. ""We've put ourselves in a position right now to be talked about quite a bit,"" Indiana first-year coach Curt Cignetti said. ""That's nice. It doesn't help us prepare, doesn't help us play any better. But we've got some great opportunities ahead of us."" The rankings for each team remained unchanged in the third CFP poll announced Tuesday, meaning the Buckeyes will play their third top-5 matchup of the season. They were No. 2 when they lost at then-No. 3 Oregon 32-31 on Oct. 12. Ohio State was No. 4 for a 20-13 win at then-No. 3 Penn State on Nov. 2. ""Our guys are fired up for this one,"" Ohio State coach Ryan Day said. ""They know that this is a must-win for us. We have to win this game to play in Indianapolis (in the Big Ten championship game). The team, the coaches, everybody in this building, the fans know what kind of game this is. We've got to bring it on Saturday."" Indiana lucked out in the Big Ten scheduling by not having Penn State and Oregon on the slate, and the Hoosiers' nonconference foes were Florida International, Western Illinois and Charlotte. The team's biggest win was 20-15 over struggling Michigan on Nov. 9 ahead of a bye. Indiana ends the regular season against one-win Purdue. ""I think we have a confident team that believes and takes care of business,"" Cignetti said. ""They prep well. They're detailed. They played fairly consistently to a standard, not circumstances of the game, and that's what we preach."" The Hoosiers are playing the schedule presented to them and doing it well behind Ohio University transfer Kurtis O'Rourke, who ranks second nationally in passing efficiency at 182.7 with 21 touchdown passes and just four interceptions. He is one spot ahead of Ohio State's Will Howard (181.9, 24, 5). Indiana has the nation's top rushing defense at 72.2 yards allowed per game, having held opponents to less than 100 yards on the ground seven times. The Buckeyes are fourth in rush defense (90.7). While Ohio State has the home-field advantage, the Hoosiers may benefit by having two weeks to prepare. ""It was good for everybody to catch a breather and get refreshed and recharged and gave us a little extra time on the next opponent,"" Cignetti said. Indiana will be the fourth opponent this season to have an off week before playing the Buckeyes. Ohio State players commented after a 31-7 win over Northwestern last week how the Wildcats presented schemes they had not seen on film. That added preparation may have played into the Buckeyes' continuing problems with slow starts. Northwestern's first two series were an 11-play, 59-yard drive that resulted in a lost fumble at the Ohio State 16 and a 13-play, 85-yard touchdown march. The two drives resulted in a combined 12:26 of possession. While Indiana has not beaten Ohio State since 1988 (0-30-1), Day said this Hoosiers team is different. ""I don't think their players get enough credit,"" he said. ""The coaches have done a nice job. ... But the players are the ones who play. They have good players. ... It's going to be a great challenge for us."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Three days after Winnipeg lost 5-0 at Florida to suffer back-to-back losses for the first time this season, it got back at the Panthers to close a home-and-home set. Scheifele capped his hat trick with 10:14 left in regulation with a nifty goal just after a power play ended to give the Jets a 4-2 cushion. That marker proved key, as Matthew Tkachuk got Florida within 4-3 with a power-play goal past screened Jets goaltender Connor Hellebuyck (20 saves) with 3:22 left in the third period. However, Morgan Barron recorded two short-handed empty-netters to provide some insurance for Winnipeg, which improved to 9-1-0 at home. A.J.

The Huskies were ahead by 22 points at halftime and by 37 in the middle of the second half while waltzing to the finish line. UConn outshot East Texas A&M 54.2 percent to 25.4 percent and had a 50-24 edge in points in the paint. Liam McNeeley and Alex Karaban added 11 points each in the win while Aiden Mahaney scored 10 and Tarris Reed Jr. grabbed a game-high 10 rebounds. All four of the Huskies' wins have been over mid-major teams and by at least 35 points. Camerin James led all scorers with 18 points for East Texas (1-4). He was the lone Lions player in double figures. The Huskies fashioned a 10-0 run after allowing East Texas A&M the game's first basket and led 24-10 after a 3-pointer by Mahaney and then a three-point play from McNeeley, the latter at the 8:31 mark of the first half. The Lions swung back, paring their deficit to nine points on a 3-pointer by Yusef Salih with six minutes to play in the first half. That seemed to awaken UConn, as the Huskies responded by scoring the ensuing 14 points capped by a three-point play by Ross with 55 seconds left and -- after a pair of free throws by Ahmad Nowell with 27 seconds remaining - they carried a 42-20 advantage to the break. Ball led all scorers before halftime with 10 points as UConn outshot the Lions 51.7 percent to 24.1 percent, outrebounded the visitors 27-14 and had an 11-0 edge in fast break points over the first 20 minutes. Scooter Williams Jr. paced East Texas A&M with seven points in the first half. UConn boosted its lead to 36 points on Ball's layup with 13:25 to play. The Huskies were up 64-27 before East Texas A&M forged a 12-2 run culminated by a three-point play from James to pull within 66-39 and send four of the Huskies' starters back into the game to regain the momentum. The Huskies pushed the lead back to 37 before settling for the 35-point final margin. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Rasmus Andersson scored in regulation for the Flames, who have won two straight games and three of their past four outings. Goaltender Dustin Wolf made 28 saves between regulation and overtime before turning back both Islanders he faced in the shootout. Wolf has posted a 4-0-1 record in his past five starts. Pierre Engvall had the lone goal for the Islanders, who have one win, one loss and three extra-time defeats in their past five outings. Goalie Semyon Varlamov stopped 30 shots prior to the shootout in an outstanding goaltending battle. Kuzmenko, the second shooter for the Flames, notched the difference-maker by completing a backhand deke. Justin Kirkland scored in the third round of the shootout, sealing the Calgary win. Engvall ran his goal-scoring streak to three games when he opened the scoring just 92 seconds into the second period. He worked toward the slot from the left circle, using a nifty toe-drag to create a better angle while using a defender as a partial screen, and ripped a high shot for his third marker of the season. Andersson's power-play goal at 8:17 of the third period tied the clash. Andersson set up in the high slot and unloaded a one-timer that found the mark for his fifth goal of the campaign and Calgary's first man-advantage marker in five games. From the drop of the puck, both netminders were on top of their game. Wolf stoned Bo Horvat on a first-period breakaway and, later in the frame, got a toe on Anders Lee's chance from the slot. Early in the third period, while his team was hoping to mount a comeback, he denied Horvat again on a golden chance before holding strong against Maxim Tsyplakov. Wolf also stopped a Kyle Palmieri one-timer late in regulation. For his part, Varlamov stood tall with a first-period stop on Connor Zary, denied Mikael Backlund in the first minute of the second period and also won a one-on-one with MacKenzie Weegar late in the second.

He sank four treys in a 1:42 stretch as the Lakers took a 91-73 lead with less than two minutes remaining in the period.

Young had a season-high 19 assists and Dyson Daniels blocked a potential game-winning jumper by De'Aaron Fox in the final seconds as the Hawks edged the Sacramento Kings 109-108 on the road on Monday night. The tight finish was nothing new to Atlanta, which has had five of its past seven games decided by five points or fewer. That stretch includes a five-point home win over the New York Knicks and a one-point shocker at the Boston Celtics.  Recent Hawks-Warriors history has included a couple of barn-burners as well. Golden State snatched a 143-141 double-overtime win over the Hawks in January of 2023 before Atlanta got even with a 141-134 overtime victory in February. The latter was highlighted by a classic point guard scoring duel, with Curry exploding for 10 3-pointers and 60 points in defeat. Young countered with seven threes and 35 points. All five career head-to-heads between Curry and Young have seen Curry go for at least 30 points. He's had 30, 37, 50, 31 and 60 points during that amazing run. Young has yet to outscore his counterpart, but he has put up a fight with 28, 25 and 35 points in the past three meetings. Curry is coming off a 26-point performance in a 102-99 road loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday.  One of the best free-throw shooters in NBA history, Curry failed to get to the foul line in the loss to the Clippers. His teammates didn't make the most of their 19 attempts, missing 10 of them, in a game in which the Warriors were outscored 16-9 at the line despite having a 19-18 advantage in attempts. After the loss, which snapped a three-game winning streak, Warriors coach Steve Kerr promised his players wouldn't be taking a day off Tuesday leading into the Hawks' visit. ""We've got to work on it obviously,"" he said of the recent woes at the foul line. ""Our guys have to get in the gym and find their rhythm, find their confidence from the line for sure."" Golden State has shot just 63.9 percent from the line in its past five games. The Warriors also hurt themselves against the Clippers with 19 turnovers. Now they go up against Atlanta's turnover-creating machine -- Daniels -- who had a league-leading 44 steals in his first 12 games before turning his attention to blocks, including the game-saver on Fox, in Sacramento. Daniels totaled four blocks against the Kings. The first-year Hawk also found time for 14 points, which Atlanta coach Quin Snyder credited to Young's unselfishness. ""Every game is going to be a little different,"" Snyder said of Young's high-assist, low-scoring performance. ""Excellent job by Trae finding people and making plays even though it wasn't him scoring. That's what he needs to do."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The 71 points USC gave up to Cal marked a significant improvement from the 95 the Trojans allowed in a three-point win over UT Arlington on Nov. 13. However, USC allowed 42 first-half points vs. Cal, almost completely negating the Trojans' own 43-point effort in the first 20 minutes.

The Bruins have allowed an average of 45.0 points during their three victories as they enter Wednesday night's nonconference game against Idaho State in Los Angeles. UCLA (3-1) notched wins of 35 points over Rider, 31 points against Boston University and 40 over Lehigh behind an energetic pressure defense. The Bruins also lost 72-64 to New Mexico on Nov. 8 at Henderson, Nev. UCLA ranks fourth nationally in scoring defense (51.8 points per game) and 28th in field-goal percentage defense (35.4) entering play on Tuesday. ""I think defensively, we just have to do what we do every night,"" Bruins forward Eric Dailey Jr. said after Friday's 85-45 trouncing of Lehigh. ""Play aggressively and try to move teams faster, make them play at a faster pace and fumble the ball. That has been working for us, building our reputation as a defensive team."" Bruins coach Mick Cronin was fine with the performance but feels his club can do better. ""If you hold a team to 45 points, your effort is usually really good,"" Cronin said. ""I'm proud of our defense again, but I think we've got a lot of things that we need to clean up."" Oregon State transfer Tyler Bilodeau has been UCLA's top player with averages of 15.5 points and 7.3 rebounds. Dailey, an Oklahoma State transfer, is averaging 11 points and 6.5 rebounds. Idaho State (2-3) split the first two contests of a three-game road trip, winning 78-66 at San Diego on Saturday before falling 62-61 to Cal State Fullerton on Monday. Jake O'Neil had 17 points, 12 rebounds and three steals for the Bengals on Monday and Washington State transfer Dylan Darling also scored 17 points. Darling is averaging team-best figures of 13.8 points and 5.2 assists. ""I think he's the type of guy that other players like to play with just because of his ability to distribute the basketball -- on time, right where it needs to be,"" Idaho State coach Ryan Looney said. O'Neil is averaging 12.8 points and 9.2 rebounds while Isaiah Griffin is contributing 12.6 points and 5.6 boards. The Bengals have outrebounded their first five foes by an average of 12.4 boards. UCLA is 3-1 all-time against Idaho State but the Bengals' victory still ranks as one of the biggest upsets of all-time. Idaho State stunned a UCLA team featuring future NBA stars Marques Johnson and Kiki Vandeweghe 76-75 in the Sweet 16 of the 1977 NCAA Tournament. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Only one of the 13 players who received a qualifying offer, Cincinnati Reds right-hander Nick Martinez, accepted the tender of a one-year, $21.05 million deal. The others who rejected the offer ahead of the Tuesday deadline to decide were Mets first baseman Pete Alonso and left-hander Sean Manaea, Baltimore Orioles right-hander Corbin Burnes and outfielder Anthony Santander, Houston Astros third baseman Alex Bregman, Milwaukee Brewers shortstop Willy Adames, Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Teoscar Hernandez, Arizona Diamondbacks first baseman Christian Walker, Boston Red Sox right-hander Nick Pivetta and Atlanta Braves left-hander Max Fried. Should any of them sign with a new team, the player's former team will be compensated with a draft pick. Soto, 26, batted .288 with a .989 OPS in his first season with the Yankees and hit 41 home runs with 109 RBIs while guiding the club into the World Series. Big-market clubs such as the Yankees, Mets, Red Sox, Toronto Blue Jays and Philadelphia Phillies all reportedly have interest in the four-time All-Star, who was a Silver Slugger winner this year. Soto is expected to command one of the largest major league contracts ever as a free agent. Severino, 30, went 11-7 with a 3.91 ERA in 31 starts in his first season with the Mets, striking out 161 batters across 182 innings. A two-time All-Star with the New York Yankees (2017, 2018), Severino is 65-44 with a 3.81 ERA in 172 games (156 starts) with the Yankees (2015-19, 2021-23) and Mets. Martinez, 34, went 10-7 with a 3.10 ERA in 42 games (16 starts) for Cincinnati this year. He previously played for the Texas Rangers (2014-17) and the San Diego Padres (2022-23), and he owns a 37-45 career record with nine saves and a 4.09 ERA in 240 games (103 starts).

Yet team owner Woody Johnson reportedly sought another huge move that didn't happen: the benching of quarterback Aaron Rodgers. The Athletic reported Tuesday that Johnson advocated a QB change in a Sept. 29 meeting. Per the report, Johnson brought together a group of coaches and front office staffers in the wake of a 10-9 home loss to the Denver Broncos that dropped the Jets' record to 2-2. Johnson advocated installing Tyrod Taylor at quarterback in place of Rodgers, according to The Athletic. Douglas and the coaches, including Saleh, offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett and Jeff Ulbrich, then the defensive coordinator, now the interim head coach, reportedly were shocked by the suggestion, with one participant asking Johnson if he was being serious. The meeting ended with the idea being dismissed. Rodgers, a 40-year-old veteran who is a four-time NFL Most Valuable Player, has started every game this season for the 3-8 Jets. He has completed 63.4 percent of his passes for 2,442 yards and 17 touchdowns with seven interceptions. Last year, his first with New York, Rodgers sustained a season-ending torn right Achilles tendon early in the opening game. In his career, largely with the Green Bay Packers (2005-22), Rodgers has a 151-83-1 record as a starter with 61,497 passing yards, 492 passing touchdowns and 112 interceptions. Taylor, 35, went 2-3 as a starter for the Jets last year. A former Pro Bowl performer with the Buffalo Bills who also has played for the Baltimore Ravens, Cleveland Browns, Los Angeles Chargers, Houston Texans and New York Giants, Taylor owns a career 28-28-1 record in a starting role. This season, Taylor has completed 6 of 8 passes for 36 yards and a touchdown with no interceptions. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Meyer, making his first start of the season while Layden Blocker sat out with a quad injury, drilled 5 of 11 3-pointers on a night when DePaul (5-0) launched 39 triples as a team and hit 15. Troy D'Amico contributed 14 points, Isaiah Rivera scored 12 and David Skogman and JJ Traynor added 11 apiece. Kooper Jacobi posted 22 points and eight rebounds to lead Eastern Illinois (1-4), which shrugged off a 14-0 DePaul run early in the second half to get as close as three, 61-58, with 4:19 to go. Nakyel Shelton hit 11 of 11 free throws en route to 17 points, while Zion Fruster added 12 for the Panthers. DePaul bolted out to a 10-5 lead in the first four minutes of the game. Then things turned into a slog for the Blue Demons, as they scored just two points over the next seven-plus minutes. Eastern Illinois ended up taking a 13-12 lead on Shelton's two free throws at the 9:44 mark of the first half. The Panthers' first lead of the night seemingly motivated DePaul. Meyer cashed in on two 3-pointers and Traynor added a third to give the Blue Demons a 21-18 edge. DePaul wound up with a 29-25 halftime lead, with both teams committing 10 turnovers before the break.  Eastern Illinois came out hot in the second half and seized a 36-34 lead on Fruster's floater with 17:13 to play. Again, a deficit inspired DePaul to kick it up a notch. Skogman spotted up for three 3-pointers and Meyer added one as part of the 14-0 run to push the Blue Demons to a 48-36 lead. The Panthers got within 61-58 with 4:19 left when Fruster canned a fadeaway in the paint, then hit a 3-pointer, but Rivera responded with a 3-pointer and Traynor added two free throws to guide DePaul to safety. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Trey Kaufman-Renn hit the second of two free throws to pull the Boilermakers within 55-49 with 8:14 remaining, but Marquette answered with an 8-0 run.

Trevor Zegras added two assists for Anaheim, which won its third straight while sending the Blackhawks to their third loss in a row. Ducks goaltender John Gibson made 18 saves. Carlsson provided the Ducks with their lone lead of the night, striking from in front of the net to redirect a Killorn pass from outside the right circle at 9:38 of the third period. Jason Dickinson scored twice and Connor Bedard had two assists for Chicago. The Ducks outshot the Blackhawks 24-20 and had a 27-13 advantage in hits. Dickinson recorded his first multi-goal game of the season while Bedard ended a three-game pointless streak. Five of Bedard's 12 assists this season have come against the Ducks. The Blackhawks opened the scoring at 17:03 of the first period. Bedard took a pass from TJ Brodie just inside the blue line, turned to his left and sent a pass to a waiting Dickinson, who one-timed a shot from the right circle past Gibson. Anaheim got the equalizer just 2:02 later as Pavel Mintyukov finished a short-side opportunity from the left circle after Brett Leason guided a pass through the crease from the right side. Leason, who contributed a goal and two assists during Anaheim's win in Dallas on Monday, has seven points in five games in November. Chicago regained the lead at 3:54 of the second period. Working behind the net, Bedard slid a no-look pass to Dickinson, who wristed another past Gibson. That gave the Blackhawks an 11-7 edge in shots on goal, but the Ducks responded with a push through the rest of the period and into the third. Zegras' no-look pass from behind the net created an opportunity for Killorn, who weaved into the slot and beat Chicago goalie Arvid Soderblom on the backhand to tie the game at 5:10 of the third. Soderblom stopped 21 shots. Anaheim went 0-for-2 on the power play. Chicago was 0-for-1.

Westbrook came off the bench to contribute 12 points, 14 assists and 10 rebounds. He is the NBA's all-time leader in triple-doubles. The Nuggets, playing their third straight game without three-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic, snapped a two-game losing streak and gave coach Michael Malone his 432nd win to tie Doug Moe for the most in franchise history. Jokic is out because of personal reasons. The Grizzlies were playing the second of their four Group Play games in the NBA Cup. They were led by Santi Aldama, who tied a career high with 28 points and added 11 rebounds. Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 19 and Scotty Pippen Jr. had 16 for the Grizzlies, who shot 39.8 percent. Memphis has yet to win a Cup game in two seasons. Ahead by 11 at halftime, the Nuggets pushed their lead to 25 points midway through the third quarter with a 17-4 run. The Grizzlies rallied late, with consecutive layups by Desmond Bane and Pippen cutting Denver's advantage to five (115-110) with 1:47 to go. Memphis played without rookie center Zach Edey, the team's 7-foor-4 first-round pick out of Purdue. Edey injured his ankle Sunday against Denver. The Grizzlies lost Vince Williams to a right ankle sprain late in the second quarter. Williams was injured underneath the Memphis basket attempting to grab an offensive board.

Three days after Winnipeg lost 5-0 at Florida to suffer back-to-back losses for the first time this season, it got back at the Panthers to close a home-and-home set. Scheifele capped his hat trick with 10:14 left in regulation with a nifty goal just after a power play ended to give the Jets a 4-2 cushion. That marker proved key, as Matthew Tkachuk got Florida within 4-3 with a power-play goal past screened Jets goaltender Connor Hellebuyck (20 saves) with 3:22 left in the third period. However, Morgan Barron recorded two short-handed empty-netters to provide some insurance for Winnipeg, which improved to 9-1-0 at home. A.J. Greer and Sam Reinhart also scored for the Panthers, who have lost three of their past four games after winning seven straight. The result also ended a six-game road winning streak for Florida. While the Panthers showed some early pressure against Hellebuyck, the Jets struck first. Kyle Connor, who had failed to record a point in five of his previous six games, cruised through the slot and backhanded the puck past Florida goalie Sergei Bobrovsky (21 saves) with 5:47 remaining in the first period.  The Jets made it 2-0 with 2:20 to play before the first intermission. Off a drop pass from Gabriel Vilardi, Scheifele made his way into the circle, then sent a wrister by Bobrovsky. Winnipeg failed to convert a five-on-three advantage early in the second. However, the Jets managed to notch a power-play goal with 4:19 remaining in the period, when Nikolaj Ehlers sent a circle-to-circle pass for Scheifele to successfully one-time. Florida finally answered with 2:36 left before the second intermission. Greer sent the puck through traffic, where it was redirected off two Jets before going past Hellebuyck. The Panthers got within 3-2 at 7:10 of the third via their own power-play score. Florida's relentless pressure on the man advantage was rewarded through Reinhart, who has nine goals during an 11-game point streak. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Akins shot 10-of-15 from the field overall before fouling out with 45 seconds remaining. Jase Richardson and Frankie Fidler each scored 12 points and Szymon Zapala added 10 points and six rebounds for Michigan State (4-1). The Spartans shot 50.9 percent from the field overall (28 of 55) and made 20 of 23 attempts from the free-throw line.

The Bulldogs shot 49.1 percent from the field (28 of 57) and 34.6 percent from 3-point range (9 of 26). After Samford pulled within five with 6:27 left in the game, Akins hit three consecutive shots -- two 3-pointers and a fastbreak layup -- to give Michigan State a 72-59 lead with 4:52 remaining. Samford cut the Michigan State lead to 79-73 with 31 seconds remaining, but a pair of free throws by Jaxon Kohler with 22 seconds left effectively iced it.

However, as there was a month remaining in the regular season when the first CFP Top 25 rankings were released, there were too many moving parts and hypotheticals to get overly analytical. The third set of weekly rankings is when things start to get more serious. Rivalry week looms, conference championship races are tightening, and erstwhile playoff hopefuls are beginning to fall by the wayside. Five takeaways from the Tuesday rankings announcement: 1. It's good to be in the SEC A common complaint in the early years of the Bowl Championship Series was that the two-team national championship format punished the Southeastern Conference for having too many good teams, causing them to cannibalize each other. That sentiment is alive and well with the expansion of the championship system to 12 teams. While the SEC has only one representative ranked in the top sux -- Texas at No. 3 -- consider that six SEC teams are ranked No. 15 or better, six of them with multiple losses. It's the only conference with any multiple-loss teams ranked that highly, let alone boasting several. There are three teams ranked with three losses, and two of them -- South Carolina and Missouri -- hail from the SEC. While the depth leads to teams beating up on one another, it also provides more opportunities to rack up ranked wins. A good example is Texas A&M, which is within shouting distance of the playoff at No. 15. The Aggies are 1-2 against currently ranked opponents, with one of those losses coming out of conference against Notre Dame. The other defeat was to No. 18 South Carolina, the highest-ranked three-loss team. Texas A&M's top win came against No. 23 Missouri, a peculiar choice to remain in the polls, given that all three of the Tigers' losses occurred in October or November. The most recent of those defeats came last week at South Carolina, which climbed three spots on the strength of a ranked win. 2. Indiana's margin for error Of the nation's three remaining undefeated teams, two have yet to face a Top 25 opponent. That changes in Week 13, and it could be a do-or-die scenario for both Indiana and Army. Army's pursuit of a playoff berth is inherently tenuous. The Black Knights' hopes rest on running the table and either a power conference descending into chaos or Boise State losing. But for Indiana, could an 11-1 Big Ten team realistically be excluded from the playoff if the Hoosiers lose to Ohio State this weekend? With another power-conference team, SMU, continuing to linger outside the playoff field at one loss, it's not out of the realm of possibility that Indiana could similarly slip. Unlike a hypothetical one-loss Indiana, however, SMU controls its conference-championship destiny. Should the Hoosiers lose to Ohio State, they would need to beat Purdue in their finale and hope for help -- specifically, losses by Penn State and Ohio State in Week 14 (or this week, in the case of the Nittany Lions) -- to secure a shot at Oregon in the Big Ten title game. SMU is one of the looming threats to pass Indiana if the Hoosiers falter, along with Boise State and several SEC teams benefiting from strong schedules. 3. Boise State should root against Colorado State Thanks to a slip-up by the leader of one of the four power conferences in Week 12, Boise State escaped a projected opening-round playoff game and climbed to No. 4 among the top five conference champions. To maintain its position -- or potentially climb higher -- Boise State would benefit from a rematch with UNLV in the Mountain West championship game. Washington State's puzzling Week 12 loss to New Mexico erased a ranked win from Boise State's resume, but UNLV mitigated the damage by checking in at No. 24. If the Rebels reach 10 wins and remain in the Top 25, a second meeting with the Broncos would enhance Boise State's case. However, for that scenario to occur, Colorado State needs to lose. The Rams, quietly undefeated in the Mountain West after a lackluster start that included blowout losses to Texas and Colorado, are 7-3 overall and nowhere near the Top 25, even if they win out. While Fresno State may be Boise State's most bitter Mountain West rival, Broncos fans presumably will root for the Bulldogs in their Week 13 home matchup against Colorado State. 4. Kansas is the Big 12's biggest problem BYU escaped precarious positions repeatedly on its way to a 9-0 start, but the law of averages -- and the surging Kansas Jayhawks -- caught up with the Cougars. Kansas disrupted Iowa State's playoff hopes a week earlier, temporarily knocking the Cyclones out of the Top 25 with a 45-36 win in Kansas City on Nov. 9. Iowa State returned to the poll this week, but at No. 22, the Cyclones are well outside the playoff picture. BYU hasn't been eliminated yet, but its drop to No. 14, combined with Boise State inching up to No. 12, leaves the Big 12's highest-ranked team fifth among the conference champions. Next up for Kansas is a home game against No. 16 Colorado on Saturday. A Jayhawks win, coupled with No. 21 Arizona State defeating BYU, could conceivably leave the Big 12 on the outside looking in. 5. Plenty of head-to-head matchups loom Starting this weekend, a series of matchups featuring Top 25 teams squaring off promises lots of movement, even without another wave of upsets. No. 5 Indiana's showdown with No. 2 Ohio State is the game of the week this Saturday. Meanwhile, No. 6 Notre Dame's neutral-site clash with No. 19 Army at Yankee Stadium is a likely make-or-break moment for both teams' playoff aspirations. Reeling BYU visits surging Arizona State, with the winner controlling its destiny for a Big 12 championship game berth. The following week will bring additional drama, with the renewal of the Texas-Texas A&M series and South Carolina-Clemson clash both carrying playoff implications. Plenty can and will change, even as the playoff picture begins to take shape. --Kyle Kensing, Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

David N'Guessan scored 10 points and Coleman Hawkins had 13 rebounds, with four assists and three steals for the Wildcats (3-1), who missed their first 10 attempts from 3-point range and finished 3 of 23 (13.0 percent) from beyond the arc. Wildcats point guard Dug McDaniel, a Michigan transfer, did not play after making his first start for his new program Thursday in a 76-65 loss to LSU. No reason was given for why McDaniel remained on the bench. Kansas State outrebounded Mississippi Valley State 45-28 and forced 17 turnovers to win despite shooting 35.9 percent overall from the floor. The Wildcats went 25 of 27 from the free-throw line while the Delta Devils were 8-for-8. Arthur Tate scored 16 points for Mississippi Valley State (1-4), while Antonio Sisk added 15 in the team's fourth game against a power-conference opponent, all losses. Walter Hamilton had six rebounds for the Delta Devils, who also have losses to Iowa State, Missouri and Texas. Mississippi Valley State went 1-30 last season. After early struggles from long range, Kansas State moved inside to find offense and built a 21-7 lead when David Castillo finally gave the Wildcats their first 3-pointer with 5:25 remaining in the half. Mississippi Valley State then went on a 16-2 run to tie the game 23-23 late in the first half before Kansas State took a 25-23 lead into halftime. The Delta Devils tied the game again at 25-25 on a Tate basket early in the second half before the Wildcats took control of the game with a 16-3 run to take a 41-28 lead with 14:52 remaining. Mississippi Valley State never got within double digits the rest of the way, despite a late 9-0 run, while dropping the program's first-ever meeting with Kansas State. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

White made three 3-pointers and added three steals for the Horned Frogs (4-1), who were without Ernest Udeh Jr. (back) for a second consecutive contest. Brendan Wenzel also hit three 3-pointers and scored nine points while David Punch posted 10 points, seven rebounds and five blocks. Noah Reynolds had a team-high six assists for TCU, which hit 7 of 14 3s in the first half. Keionte Cornelius tallied a team-high 13 points while Antonio Lisenbee scored eight for the Braves (0-5), who shot 30.4 percent (17 of 56) from the field and made 4 of 13 3-pointers. Alcorn State had 18 turnovers. The Braves' promising start fizzled midway through the first half following Daniel Braster's 3-pointer that cut the TCU advantage to 21-16 at the 9:31 mark. Wenzel responded with consecutive 3s that pushed the Horned Frogs to a 29-18 lead and keyed a 12-2 run that eventually extended that margin to 15 points on Frankie Collins' layup with 5:43 left in the half. Alcorn State's Jalyke Gaines-Wyatt nailed a jumper at the 1:43 mark to end the TCU surge and snap an 0-for-6 drought for the Braves, who went 6:31 without a field goal. Alcorn State missed eight of nine shots to close the half and trailed 39-22 at the intermission paced by Braster's five points. The Horned Frogs' 17-point halftime lead could have been larger had TCU not missed five of nine free throws. That proved to be a minor concern after the Braves missed their opening eight shots of the second half and made their first basket on Djahi Binet's layup with 14:13 to play. TCU led 46-26 at that juncture, a margin that stretched to 25 points later in the second half. Gaines-Wyatt scored six points for the Braves but missed 12 of 15 shots. Reynolds added eight points for TCU and made a pair of 3-pointers. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Hunter Dickinson had his third double-double of the season for Kansas (5-0) with 15 points and a season-high 15 rebounds. David Coit came off the bench to score 13 points, one of four Jayhawks with double-digit points in the victory. Self became the fourth-fastest coach to 800 wins, according to Kansas athletics, doing so in 1,048 games. Khamari McGriff paced the Seahawks (3-1) with 18 points, while Noah Ross finished with 10 points and nine rebounds. After going up 20 points with 8:00 remaining, UNCW battled back, scoring 15 of the next 22 points, including hitting 3 of 4 shots from deep to keep Kansas on its toes until the closing minutes. The Jayhawks responded, going on a six-point run that extended the home side's lead back up to 18 points with three minutes remaining, stopping the UNCW momentum. Kansas had a five-point lead at halftime due in part to strong rebounding by the Seahawks, who had nine offensive boards in the first half. Coming out of halftime, the Jayhawks showed increased defensive pressure that led to chances offensively, with UNCW starting the second half missing its first nine shots from the field. Kansas, on the other hand, went 7-of-8 to start the half and increased their lead to 17 points. Overall, the Kansas defense held UNC Wilmington to 33.3 percent shooting in the second half, with nine of its 28 points in the half coming from the free-throw line. Kansas outshot UNCW 54.8 percent to 37.5 percent for the game. Even with Kansas center Dickinson playing formidably in the paint, UNCW went to the paint for scoring, with McGriff leading the Seahawks on 6-of-8 shooting. Donovan Newby, who led UNCW scoring 22.7 points per game entering Tuesday, was stifled by the Jayhawks, limited to seven points on 2-of-9 shooting and 1-of-6 from beyond the arc. With 4:52 remaining in the first half, Kansas lost Flory Bidunga when he rolled his left ankle while playing defense. The freshman needed help off the court and didn't return to the game. At the time of injury, Bidunga led bench scorers with six points off the bench on 3-of-3 shooting, after entering the day with nine points per game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Point, who missed the previous four matches with a lower-body injury, found a loose puck after Penguins goaltender Tristan Jarry (32 saves) ventured out of his crease. The center then tucked in his second goal of the night and 10th this season to lift the Lightning to a 5-0-1 mark against the Metropolitan Division.  Anthony Cirelli scored his fifth goal this season, Darren Raddysh had two assists and goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy stopped 17 shots for Tampa Bay, which trailed 2-0 before Point's first goal 5:41 into the third period.  Pittsburgh's Jesse Puljujarvi scored for the second straight game and Rickard Rakell netted his seventh goal this season.  Sidney Crosby dished out the primary assist on Rakell's second-period power-play tally that made it 2-0 and gave Crosby his 1,017th career helper. The 37-year-old captain and two-time playoff MVP passed Joe Sakic for 13th on the NHL's all-time assist list. Pittsburgh's special teams and its play in front of Jarry proved beneficial in a first period that saw the hosts go up 1-0 at 12:05.  After the Penguins killed off Bryan Rust's slashing penalty on Nikita Kucherov, their third line used a hard check by Puljujarvi to force a turnover, reverse the puck and get it on Marcus Pettersson's stick. The defenseman then slid a long diagonal pass that left winger Puljujarvi tapped in at the far post for his third goal this season.  The Penguins stymied all three Lightning power plays and doubled up the visitors in blocked shots (22-11). Two minutes into the second, Crosby had an open one-timer - potentially career goal No. 600 - but rang the blast off the post. He later set up Rakell's tally at 13:05 on the club's first power play after Luke Glendening's interference penalty.  In the third, Point skated around Jarry and roofed a backhander to put the Lightning on the board. Defensemen Ryan McDonagh and Raddysh earned assists. Cirelli tied it 2-2 seven minutes later on assists from Victor Hedman and Raddysh to force the overtime session. Janis Moser and Conor Geekie assisted on Point's winner. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Owen Freeman added 19 points in just 25 minutes, while reserve Seydou Traore scored 12 and Pryce Sandfort kicked in 11.

Iowa outscored Rider 19-3 in fast-break points and held it to 1 of 16 shooting from the 3-point line. The Hawkeyes also made more free throws (15) than the Broncs shot (13) despite taking six more 3-point attempts. Payton Sandfort hit a layup at the 16:19 mark of the second half to cap a 10-2 run that upped Iowa's lead to 50-28. The margin reached as high as 27 points down the stretch.

Freeman gave the Hawkeyes a boost late in the half with a 3-point play and a putback, the latter coming with 11 seconds remaining.

Linus Ullmark stopped 27 of 32 shots for the Senators, who are on a three-game winless streak (0-2-1). Tim Stutzle and Josh Norris scored for Ottawa, and Nick Jensen had two assists. In order to spark Edmonton's slumping offense, Draisaitl and Podkolzin were moved onto the top line with McDavid. The line change delivered immediate dividends, as Podkolzin and Draisaitl received assists on Bouchard's goal 3:46 into the first period. Bouchard did most of the work, however, as the defenseman started his rush in front of his own net. Bouchard raced up the center of the ice, made a canny move to evade Thomas Chabot and then put the puck under the crossbar for the highlight-reel goal. Stutzle equalized for the Senators at 15:40 of the first period, but McDavid buried a rebound to restore the Oilers' lead just 35 seconds later. Ottawa ran into penalty trouble late in the first period, leading to a 5-on-3 power play for the Oilers and McDavid's next goal.

After five straight home victories, the Magic hit the road Monday and earned a 109-99 victory over the Phoenix Suns when Franz Wagner matched a season high with 32 points and Anthony Black added 20. The duo combined for 17 assists. After losing all five games of a road trip that started the day before Halloween, Orlando is no longer haunted by that abysmal slide, even as star Paolo Banchero continues to miss time with an oblique injury. The Magic have leaned into their defense, with all six victories in the winning streak coming as their opponent was held under 100 points. ""That's kind of our team identity, and that's what we start with first in the locker room is defense,"" Black said. ""The guards have been pressuring the ball a lot, and the bigs and wings have been doing a good job in the paint helping us protect the rim and just helping clean up our mistakes."" The success is drawing attention with Wagner named the most recent Eastern Conference Player of the Week. The fourth-year player is averaging a career-best 22.9 points on the season and 29.0 points with 6.0 rebounds and 6.3 assists during the winning streak. Wednesday's game is Orlando's first of a back-to-back in the Los Angeles area, with a matchup Thursday against the Lakers before a home date against the Detroit Pistons on Saturday. The Clippers also take pride in their defense and have used it to fashion a five-game home winning streak after a 102-99 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Monday. Los Angeles led by as many as 15 in the second half and 10 in the fourth quarter before the Warriors settled into another comeback attempt. Golden State even had a pair of chances from 3-point range in the closing seconds with a chance to tie the game, including one from Stephen Curry, before Los Angeles walked away with the victory. Norman Powell scored 23 points for the Clippers despite dealing with hamstring discomfort that developed in the first quarter. James Harden scored 12 points with 16 assists, while playing through an illness, and Ivica Zubac had 17 rebounds. ""Just coming back home, finding ourselves again,"" Harden said of consecutive victories following a 0-3 road trip. ""Holding that team, which they've been playing pretty well, under 100 points, hopefully we can build on that and keep going."" After losing their first four games in their new arena, the Clippers have found a recipe for success without star Kawhi Leonard, who has not played at all this season and is out indefinitely with a knee injury. ""We gotta keep our composure, and we gotta play basketball the right way,"" Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue said. ""Get to our next actions, don't make it a dribble fest.""

The win marked just the second time since November 2018 that the Cardinals scored 100 or more points in a game. Edwards, a transfer from James Madison and last season's Sun Belt Conference Player of the Year, made 10 of 14 from the floor. He was among five Cardinals who scored in double figures. Kasean Pryor finished with 21 and seven rebounds. Chucky Hepburn scored 11 of his 16 points in the second half and added five assists. J'Vonne Hadley added 10 points, and James Scott made 5 of 6 from the floor as part of a 10-point, eight-rebound performance for Louisville (2-1). Ben Johnson scored a game-high 29 points to lead the Knights (0-5), who played without leading scorer Jack Karasinski (back issues). Billy Smith pitched in with 15. Playing for the first time in 10 days, the Cardinals came out firing. They shot 60 percent in the first half (18 of 30) and connected on 7-of-17 3-point attempts. That was a marked improvement from the starts in their first two games. In the first halves of those games, they shot a combined 32.3 percent and sank just 11-of-43 shots from beyond the arc. Bellarmine (0-5) shot 45.8 percent (11 of 24) in the first half, but the Cardinals forced their crosstown rival into committing 10 turnovers, allowing them to take control.  They broke the game open with a 13-2 run, taking a 43-23 lead with 4:37 left in the first half. Edwards, who scored 12 points in the first half, ignited the run by scoring the first five points. The Knights cut the deficit to 15 twice in the second half but could not draw any closer. Louisville led by as many as 34 in the game's waning moments. Before the game, Louisville announced that senior starting forward Aboubacar Traore will miss several weeks because of a broken arm. The 6-foot-5 native of the Ivory Coast transferred to Louisville from Long Beach State, where he earned All-Big West honors last season. He is averaging 1.5 points, five rebounds, two assists and 1.5 blocks for two games. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Goalie Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen is set to return from a lower-body injury that sidelined him the past two games and led coach Lindy Ruff to pull him after two periods of a 7-5 loss to the Montreal Canadiens on Nov. 11. ""I feel like I was pushing it in the Montreal game a little bit, and I've said before there's no excuses for that but, still, I feel like I wasn't playing 100 percent in the Montreal game,"" Luukkonen said. ""You can't let that happen. You want to be 100 percent; you want to feel great. I feel like I'm at that point now."" Luukkonen has won six of his past eight decisions after an 0-2-1 start, including three straight victories before the game against Montreal, which ended up being tagged to Levi. Luukkonen had allowed two goals or fewer in six of his previous eight and three in another before giving up four against the Canadiens. Buffalo could also welcome back Tage Thompson, who was injured against Montreal. Like Luukkonen, the center has missed the past two games with a lower-body injury. He was back in his top-line spot at practice Monday and again Tuesday, though he didn't take reps on the power play on Tuesday. Thompson and Ruff both said Monday that he's close, but neither would confirm a return. Thompson leads the team with 11 goals and 18 points and has looked like the star who produced a career-high 94 points (47 goals, 47 assists) in 2022-23. The Sabres will try to bounce back from a poor effort in a 5-2 loss to the Philadelphia Flyers on Saturday. It was their second loss in the past three games after a three-game winning streak. ""It's all about consistency right now,"" Thompson said. ""We know when we commit to playing the right way we're good, and right now I think it's just us being a little immature, just thinking we're better than we are, instead of relying on what's gotten us results."" The Kings, meanwhile, also have been off since Saturday, when they earned a 4-1 win against the Detroit Red Wings. Los Angeles entered Tuesday second in the Pacific Division, one point behind the Vegas Golden Knights for the division lead. The team will play just its eighth home game of the season after starting the campaign with a lengthy road trip and is 5-1-1 thus far as the hosts. ""You want to have the advantage at home and play well in front of your fans and use all the perks of being at home to your advantage,"" defenseman Mikey Anderson said. ""Everyone's happy with the way we've (played) so far at home, but we've got to keep going with it and keep getting better."" Overall, the Kings are 2-3-0 in their past five games. Alex Turcotte will play his second straight game after missing five with an upper-body injury. The forward skated with captain Anze Kopitar and winger Adrian Kempe in his return Saturday and is expected to do so again versus Buffalo. He has one goal this season, scored back on Oct. 16, and four assists. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Terrapins forced the Golden Griffins into a shot-clock violation when Canisius held a 3-2 lead. On its next possession, Miguel drilled a three to give Maryland a lead it would not relinquish. Miguel's triple kicked off an 16-1 Terrapins run that culminated when Rice found Queen for a layup and an 18-4 lead.  Maryland later reeled off a 28-0 run that covered 7 minutes, 53 seconds. Anthony Benard hit a jumper for Canisius to snap the run and make the score 46-8 with 5:57 left in the first half.  Tyson Oghene got the Golden Griffins into double digits with a three at 1:46 to make it 55-11. The Terrapins led 59-14 at halftime.  It was more of the same in the second half as Maryland took a 64-point lead on a Young layup for an 83-19 advantage with 13:04 left in the game. Young made a free throw as the Terrapins hit the century mark with a 100-33 lead with just over three minutes left.

Royal, a sophomore, set his previous career bests earlier this season at 16 points and nine rebounds. Evansville shot 12.9 percent in the first half and trailed 28-14 at the break. The Purple Aces (1-4) finished the game at 19 percent, 11 of 58. Ohio State had no trouble pulling away in the second half, outscoring the Purple Aces 52-16, making their final nine shots to go 21 of 30 (70 percent) over the final 20 minutes. For the night, Ohio State shot 51.9 percent, 28 of 54. Meechie Johnson Jr. added 13 points and John Mobley Jr. 11 for the Buckeyes (3-1), whose 78-64 loss at then-No. 23 Texas A&M on Friday knocked them out of the Top 25. Gabriel Pozzato's eight points led the Purple Aces, who were averaging 75.8 points. He entered as their leading scorer at 19.3 points per game but was held to just two free throws in the first half while missing all five of his shots, four of them beyond the 3-point arc. In fact, cold shooting destroyed any chance of an upset. The score was 12-12 with 6:57 left before halftime before the Buckeyes went on a 16-2 spree with the help of the Purple Aces going 1 of 13 from the floor to close the period, including missing their final 11 shots. The Buckeyes could have had a bigger lead, but they weren't much better through 20 minutes, making just 29.2 percent of their field-goal attempts. The hosts did make 12 of 17 free throws in the opening half while Evansville was 4 of 7. It was an ugly first four-plus minutes of the game as each team went 0-for-5, missing three 3-point tries while hitting a pair of free throws. Evansville, in its previous game against Radford, tied a school record with 17 made 3-pointers, but the Purple Aces went 3 of 27 (11.1 percent) from long range against the Buckeyes. Ohio State canned 7 of 21 (33.3 percent) from beyond the arc. Ohio State is 5-0 all-time vs. Evansville. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Treysen Eaglestaff led the Fighting Hawks (2-2) with 13 points. Mier Panoam and Dariyus Woodson added 11 points apiece for North Dakota, which made only one of its last 10 attempts from the floor. Notre Dame grabbed its first double-digit lead of the night when Julian Roper II made a move inside and got a shot up to give the Irish a 46-35 advantage with 16:56 to play. Roper then came up with the ball on a hustle play, going to the floor to get possession and tossing it ahead to Burton, who cruised into the lane for an easy layup and 53-38 lead with 14:17 to go. The Fighting Irish finished with nine steals and had an advantage with 17 points off turnovers, to 10 for the Fighting Hawks. North Dakota had more turnovers, 15-7.

Notre Dame started to pull away, but North Dakota answered. Panoam's 3-pointer with 6:48 to go cut the Irish lead to 23-21.

Richard led a great effort on the glass for the Gators (5-0) to keep them unbeaten and send the Rattlers (0-4) to another lopsided loss. Walter Clayton Jr. also had his second consecutive prolific scoring game as he finished with 17 points, five assists and three rebounds. This came after Clayton scored 25 points in a win against rival Florida State last Friday. His efforts spearheaded a couple of big first-half runs for Florida, which never trailed in the game and used a 10-0 run to open up an early 19-7 lead. After Florida A&M cut its deficit to 27-20 with 5:29 left in the first half, Florida closed the half on a 19-2 run and scored the first five points of the second half to completely break the game open with a 51-22 lead. Sterling Young led the Rattlers with 12 points and two assists and was their lone double-figure scorer. Jamine Charles had nine points and 12 rebounds. For the fourth consecutive game, however, Florida A&M struggled to protect the ball and an opponent took full advantage. The Rattlers committed 15 turnovers, which led to 20 Gators points. Several of the miscues allowed Florida to open up its transition game as it finished with 30 fastbreak points to only four for the Rattlers. The Gators also did a better job on the boards then they had in their previous game, which was a key that coach Todd Golden was looking to see from his team. Five Florida players had at least seven rebounds. Alijah Martin posted 14 points and nine rebounds, Thomas Haugh provided 12 points and seven rebounds and Alex Condon and Rueben Chinyelu each added nine rebounds. The Gators collected 19 offensive rebounds and outrebounded the Rattlers 47-36 overall. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Bisons' first-half woes were exacerbated by a lackluster performance from their star Jacob Ognacevic, who scored eight points in the frame but did it on an inefficient 3-of-9 from the field while missing all four of his three-point attempts.

Stamkos scored twice with the man advantage Sunday as the Predators snapped a three-game skid with a 5-3 victory in Vancouver. The Predators will wrap up their five-game road trip Wednesday at the Seattle Kraken. Sunday's victory marked the first time the Predators scored more than three goals in a road game this season, and it came after they went 0-1-2 in their first three games of their Western swing, including a 2-0 defeat Friday at Calgary. ""We needed a response for sure, especially after the last game,"" Stamkos said. ""We know we have the talent, it's just, whether it's posts or bad luck or not being in the right spots, it's just been a combination of things that haven't gone our way so far this year, especially offensively. So, sometimes you need a game where you get four or five goals and feel good about yourselves and just build on it."" Stamkos' first power-play goal was the 218th of his career, moving him past Mike Gartner and Jaromir Jagr for 11th in league history. ""Just hearing those names, it's obviously pretty cool as a hockey fan in general to move past Hall of Fame-quality players,"" Stamkos said. Roman Josi had a goal and an assist, Filip Forsberg added two helpers and Zachary L'Heureux scored his first NHL goal for the Predators. Goaltender Juuse Saros made 24 saves. ""Unreal,"" L'Heureux said of his goal, which came in his 14th NHL game. ""Been working a long way and been close to a month now I've been here and hasn't come, so obviously happy to get it out of the way and keep going."" The Kraken had a four-game winning streak snapped with a 2-0 loss to the visiting New York Rangers on Sunday, as they were unable to solve Jonathan Quick. Wednesday's game will wrap up a six-game homestand for Seattle. ""It's a good Rangers team and we played them nose-to-nose for most of the game,"" Kraken coach Dan Bylsma said. ""They had some opportunities for sure and we fought back and had opportunities, forced their goalie into making some great saves. I thought maybe after the second goal went in, there was a little dip."" It was the fourth time the Kraken have been blanked this season, with three of those coming in the second of back-to-back games. ""You can play as good as any line any night, but if you're not contributing then it's a bit of a waste,"" Kraken forward Chandler Stephenson said. ""We have to start finding the net here.""

""As the games have gone along here, Shane's game has been trending in not-the-best direction,"" Bylsma said. ""We talked to him about his training camp and how good he was playing, and how strong he was playing. What he was showing off with the skill, and his skating, and his ability with the puck. That was super evident in training camp. ""And really the message is (to) take a reset, watch the game (Sunday) -- which he did -- and get back focused on playing the way you can play, the way you played earlier in the season."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Suns were 8-1 with Durant and have since dropped five of six games entering Wednesday night's home contest against the New York Knicks. Phoenix has lost four straight games entering Wednesday, including a 109-99 home loss to the Orlando Magic on Monday. Guard Bradley Beal (left calf strain) and center Jusuf Nurkic (left ankle sprain) also missed the contest that resulted in the club's third double-digit setback since Durant was injured. Point guard Tyus Jones isn't concerned, as he said every team has rough patches at some point during the 82-game slate. ""You have these stretches throughout the season, so they're a grind,"" Jones told reporters after Monday's loss. ""It's not gonna be our last stretch like this. It's just a grind, especially when you got guys down. ""But we just gotta continue to fight, continue to get better, stay together, not let this kind of get our spirit down and know that it'll be good for us in the long run."" Suns coach Mike Budenholzer sees the closeness of his team, and he refuses to let the slide rattle him. ""These guys stay together,"" Budenholzer said. ""It's a good group, they've got a good spirit, they've got a good way about them. Through good times and through the hard times, you gotta keep coming to work, putting your individual time in, putting your team time in and keep your head up. This group will do that. They're very good, they're very resilient."" But having three starters out is never a good formula for success. Beal will miss his fifth straight game, while Nurkic is questionable after sitting out the last three. Devin Booker has tried to carry the short-handed Suns but results have been mixed. He had 44 points on 15-of-29 shooting during a 120-117 road loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday but has averaged just 15.7 points on 13-of-40 shooting (32.5 percent) in the other three games of the Phoenix's last four contests. New York has won two of its last three games against the Suns after dropping the previous nine in a row in the series. The Knicks carry an extra dose of confidence into the opener of a five-game road trip, one they begin on a three-game win streak. ""I think what gives us momentum is the way we're playing,"" standout center Karl-Anthony Towns said. ""We're playing good basketball now."" Star guard Jalen Brunson recorded 26 points, 11 assists and made five 3-pointers as the Knicks crushed the visiting Washington Wizards 134-106 on Monday. Towns added 24 points and 12 rebounds on a night in which New York knocked down 20 of 40 3-point field-goal attempts. Cameron Payne was 5-of-6 from long range while scoring 17 points off the bench. The Knicks racked up 37 assists against just eight turnovers. ""When you play like that, the ball breathes and there's a good energy to it,"" New York coach Tom Thibodeau said of his club's ball movement. ""I thought the unselfishness was terrific."" Towns has four straight double-doubles and 11 in the past 12 games for the Knicks in his first season with the team. He was acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves in early October.

With a tremendous home-country advantage making for an electric atmosphere in Malaga, Spain, the 38-year-old Nadal fell 6-4, 6-4 to Botic van de Zandschulp of the Netherlands, which went on to knock out Spain two matches to one. ""It's been an emotional day,"" Nadal said afterward. ""I knew it could be my last match as a professional tennis player. The moments leading up to it were emotional, kind of difficult to handle, in general. So many emotions. I tried to do it as well as possible."" Nadal had announced in October that he would retire from professional tennis following Spain's Davis Cup run. Hampered by foot, hip and abdominal injuries in recent years, Nadal had last competed in matches that counted at the Paris Olympics in July. He was a career 2-0 against van de Zandschulp, 29, eliminating him at both Wimbledon (round of 16) and Roland Garros (round of 32) in 2022. Nadal was a dominant force in Paris with a record 14 French Open titles. ""I tried to have the best attitude possible, with the necessary energy, whatever the result,"" Nadal on Tuesday. ""There was a glimmer of hope at the end, but it wasn't to be. My opponent was better than me today and that's that."" van de Zandschulp had an 8-2 advantage in aces to compensate for seven double faults. Nadal saved half of his break points (3 of 6) and converted only one of three. Nadal won 66.7 percent (30 of 45) of his first-serve points, to 76.7 percent (33 of 43) for van de Zandschulp, who had more winners (19-11) in the match lasting one hour, 52 minutes. ""In the beginning, I think we were both nervous,"" van de Zandschulp said. ""The first set didn't go too smoothly, the crowd was tough, understandably. That's what it's like to play in Spain against Rafa. He's the biggest sportsman that (has) ever lived here in Spain. It was a really special event. ""It's tough to close out a match against him, knowing that it could be his last or not. I was hoping more than going for it, but in the end, I just went for it and that helped."" Nadal, who because of injuries has played only 24 matches in the past two years, going 12-8 in 2024, said at this point in his career he can't complain. ""I go (out) there, I try my best, I try to enjoy and play with the right energy, with the right attitude,"" he said. ""Just didn't work."" He found some levity in his 29-match winning streak ending in Davis Cup singles. ""I lost my first match in the Davis Cup (in 2004), and I lost my last one,"" Nadal said. ""So we close the circle."" Spain's hopes were not closed after one match. Teammate and heir apparent Carlos Alcaraz kept hopes alive for a future Nadal appearance when he defeated Tallon Griekspoor 7-6 (0), 6-3 in one hour and 25 minutes. Alcaraz recorded more winners (14-5) while Griekspoor piled up unforced errors (22-12). Alcaraz won 96.6 percent (28 of 29) of his first serve points and faced only one break point, which he failed to save while converting 2 of 5. But Alcaraz and teammate Marcel Granollers fell in doubles to Wesley Koolhof and van de Zandschulp 7-6 (4), 7-6 (3). In his 23-year career Nadal won the French Open 14 times in 18 years (2005-08, 2010-14, 2017-20, 2022). He also captured the U.S. Open four times (2010, 2013, 2017, 2019) and both Wimbledon (2008, 2010) and the Australian Open (2009, 2022) on two occasions. Nadal is second to Novak Djokovic (24) in men's Grand Slam singles titles. Roger Federer is third with 20. Nadal is a two-time Olympic gold medalist (2008 men's singles, 2016 men's doubles). He also won 92 ATP tour-level tournaments and spent 209 weeks at No. 1 in the ATP rankings. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Roberts guided the Utes to each of the past three NCAA Tournaments, including a Sweet 16 berth in 2023. She went 165-116 at Utah in parts of 10 seasons and previously coached Pacific from 2006-15. Roberts thanked Utah for her time at the university. ""I was very happy at the U and had no intentions of leaving to go anywhere else,"" Roberts said in a press release from Utah.

Milos Ilic paired 12 points with 14 rebounds for Loyola (2-3). Tyson Commander and Jordan Stiemke also scored 12 points for the Greyhounds, with Stiemke grabbing six rebounds. Jacob Theodosiou finished with 11 points. BC had its first double-digit lead at 26-16 when Brown hit a 3-pointer with 7:21 left in the first half. The Eagles extended their lead to 36-22 - their largest lead of the first half - on a Payne 3-pointer with 3:39 remaining. Loyola ended the first half on a 9-2 run and was within seven, 38-31, at halftime.   BC shot 39.5 percent from the floor over the first 20 minutes but made 6 of its 12 3-point attempts. The Eagles had a 15-2 edge in points off turnovers in the half.   Loyola sliced its deficit to five points with 12:48 to play, but BC responded with a 7-0 run that extended the lead to 59-47 with 10:27 remaining. The Eagles owned a 15-point edge after Payne's jumper made it 67-52 with 8:01 left.   Loyola shot 29.0 percent (9-of-31) from 3-point territory. The Greyhounds also committed 13 turnovers that led to 19 BC points. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Wilson is starting to feel like he might be part of something special as the Steelers prepare for a meeting with the host Cleveland Browns on Thursday night, but he also doesn't want Pittsburgh to get ahead of itself.   ""I definitely think that we have a chance (to make a deep playoff run),"" said Wilson, who has played in two Super Bowls. ""I think the biggest thing for us is continuing to just take each week as the most important week of it all.   ""I think that it's not really even just the week, it's just the day, it's just the moments in between. I think the greatest teams, the greatest players, in any sport, especially the teams I've been on, is the moment -- it's never too far away. It's right here, right now. And you're just locked into that.""   The Steelers (8-2) have certainly been locked in. They are currently riding a five-game winning streak, most recently edging the Baltimore Ravens 18-16 on Sunday.   Chris Boswell booted six field goals against Baltimore, while Wilson completed 23 of 36 passes for 205 yards and an interception.   Meanwhile, Cleveland (2-8) continues to go through the wringer. The Browns ended up on the wrong end of a 35-14 blowout while facing the host New Orleans Saints on Sunday, marking their seventh loss in the past eight games.   Cleveland now has to go up against one of the most unforgiving defenses in the league. Browns quarterback Jameis Winston is determined to direct a fundamentally sound performance against Pittsburgh, which allows the second-fewest points per game in the NFL (16.2).   ""It's precision passing. Getting the ball out on time. Elite operation and just doing our job. It's the simple things,"" Winston said. ""This team (the Steelers) is not going to try and fool you. They're going to line up and say, 'Give us your best, we're going to give you our best.'""   Winston threw for 395 yards and two touchdowns on 30-for-46 passing in the setback against New Orleans, with Jerry Jeudy hauling in six catches for 142 yards and a score. Star running back Nick Chubb continued to struggle since his return from a knee injury that cut his 2023 season short, finishing with 50 yards on 11 carries.   Cleveland coach Kevin Stefanski is looking forward to the challenge that Pittsburgh presents.   ""Great challenge playing the Steelers on Thursday night,"" Stefanski said. ""Well-coached team, great players on offense, defense and special teams, so we have to have a great week here to get ready for that game.""   The Browns could be without standout defensive end Myles Garrett, who missed practice on Tuesday because of a hip injury. Wide receiver Elijah Moore (shoulder), guard Joel Bitonio (pectoral) and cornerbacks Denzel Ward (ribs/ankle) and Greg Newsome II (shoulder) were among those limited during the session.   Linebacker Alex Highsmith is dealing with an ankle issue and missed the Steelers' practice on Tuesday.

The AL Central champion Guardians had a highly successful season under Vogt in his first year managing the club, winning 92 games and defeating the Detroit Tigers to make their first AL Championship Series since 2016. They lost in five games to the New York Yankees. Vogt, 40, is a unique winner of the award, having only just completed his playing career in 2022. He becomes the fastest to win the award following a playing career, the fifth-youngest winner overall and one of just 10 to win the award in his first year of managing. The former two-time All-Star improved a young roster from 76 wins to 92 wins in a single year, showing an immediate impact in taking the reins from three-time Manager of the Year Terry Francona (2013, 2016, 2022). The Guardians have tied the Chicago White Sox for the most MOY awards all-time (five). In addition to Vogt and Francona, Eric Wedge took home the honors in 2007. Earning 27 first-place votes of a possible 30, Vogt won the award over fellow AL Central managers Matt Quatraro of the Kansas City Royals and A.J. Hinch of the Tigers, both of whom also led turnarounds and landed postseason appearances. Much like Vogt, the 65-year-old Murphy was also in his first full year as a manager and earned 27 first-place votes. However, the wealth of experience Murphy brought to the table in Milwaukee was in stark contrast to Vogt. From 2016 to 2023, Murphy served as a top assistant of Craig Counsell - who he once coached at Notre Dame (1988-94) - in Milwaukee until Counsell departed for the Chicago Cubs last offseason. In addition, he was a longtime coach of Arizona State (1995-2009) and filled in as an interim manager for the San Diego Padres in 2015, coaching that team to a 42-54 mark during his tenure. In 2024, Murphy led a 93-69 team that won the NL Central (ahead of the Cubs) and reached the postseason despite significant challenges faced along the way, including the departure of Corbin Burnes and injuries to fellow top right-handers Brandon Woodruff and Devin Williams. Murphy won the NL award over Mike Shildt of the Padres and Carlos Mendoza of the New York Mets. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

As Celebrini - the first pick in this year's draft - and the Sharks head into Wednesday's clash with the Dallas Stars to kick off a two-game trip, San Jose will aim to build on a thrilling victory in which its young star was the hero. Celebrini scored his first NHL overtime and game-winning goal in Monday's 5-4 home win over the Detroit Red Wings. ""It's fun to win one in overtime. We've been on the wrong side of it a couple of times, so it was nice to get that one,"" Celebrini said after netting the winner 46 seconds into overtime. The Sharks, who finished at the bottom of the league standings last season, entered Tuesday tied for last in the Pacific Division, but have plenty of positives to build off right now. San Jose has gone 6-3-2 since losing its first nine games of the season.  Making the playoffs is likely a pipe dream, even with three-quarters of the season remaining, but the Sharks appear to be heading in the right direction. San Jose erased three one-goal deficits before beating the Red Wings to snap its three-game skid. ""We deserved to win the hockey game,"" Sharks coach Ryan Warsofsky said. ""I thought for the majority of the game we pushed the pace, and we took over some parts of the third period that we've been talking about all year. That was our identity."" Celebrini, who has four goals in eight games this season, savored his first high-leverage tally. ""I mean, to get put in that situation, you want to come through for your team, especially after a couple of misses in the shootout and stuff,"" he said. The Stars are back in action after having their three-game win streak end in Monday's 4-2 home loss to Anaheim. ""This type of game is going to happen to everybody in the league at some point. Over an 82-game schedule, you're going to have a game where you're either off, flat or get behind and can't come back,"" Dallas coach Pete DeBoer said. ""It's over with, there's nothing we can do about it now. It's all about our response."" The Stars scored twice in the third period to pull within 3-2 but could not complete the comeback. Defenseman Esa Lindell (two goals, six assists) said Dallas did not have to wonder after the game what went wrong. ""You have to prepare every night. (Our) pre-scout said they're going to come out hard, play physical and compete. We didn't match that,"" Lindell said. ""We've got to bounce back. When we ramp up the compete, it's going to help our game and results."" Forward Matt Duchene (team-high 21 points) suggested the Stars played down to Anaheim on Monday. ""We've got to make sure we're crossing T's and dotting I's and making sure we don't lose games like that,"" Duchene said. ""Give them credit, they are a talented team with a good goaltender. They played well. They played a good hockey game and there's two teams out there trying to win. But if we bring our A-game, that's a game we likely win."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

One-loss Notre Dame moved into the sixth spot and Alabama leads a host of 8-2 SEC teams in the next tier. The Crimson Tide rose to No. 7, and after Miami at No. 8 comes Ole Miss, Georgia and Tennessee at Nos. 9-11. The latest shakeup came after Georgia defeated Tennessee 31-17 this past weekend. The Bulldogs checked in one spot behind Ole Miss - which beat them handily the previous week - and one spot in front of the Volunteers. Though Tennessee is ranked No. 11, it would be the first team out of the 12-team playoff if the season ended today based on the requirement that the five best conference champions receive automatic bids into the field. Boise State (9-1) moved up one spot to No. 12, and BYU tumbled to No. 14 after taking its first loss of the season, 17-13 at the hands of Kansas. But because BYU remains the highest-ranked team from the Big 12, it would make the field as the No. 12 seed and the conference's only representative. Boise State, as the fourth-highest ranked conference champ, would get the fourth seed and a first-round bye.

It marked the sixth game in nine days for Houston, which will host the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday to open its third three-game homestand this month. The defeat had all the markings of the inconsistency that plagued the Rockets last month, an issue Houston appeared to resolve over the previous five games. The Rockets offset their poor shooting -- Houston shot 40 percent and missed 23 of 32 3-pointers -- by turning 16 offensive rebounds into a plus-17 margin in shot attempts. But they suffered defensive lapses in the first half, allowing Brook Lopez and Gary Trent Jr. to shoot a combined 8-for-10 from behind the arc. But when a rally was required, the Rockets delivered, behind 12 consecutive points from Fred VanVleet in the third quarter and a 10-point fourth from Jalen Green. Houston led by as many as seven points in the final period and held a 100-94 advantage with just under two minutes left, only to go cold and allow Damian Lillard to lead the Bucks to victory. The schedule has been unforgiving of late, but the Rockets' reliance on defense, second-chance opportunities and transition points can only be so effective if the halfcourt offense continues to lag. It required ample energy to erase that 14-point deficit, but the Rockets had enough in reserve to finish the job. They simply didn't. When the Rockets scuffled out of the gate to start the season, coach Ime Udoka would note how they came up short, often in explicit detail. He did so again Monday. ""I think we had a lot of fresh bodies in,"" Udoka said. ""Guys that made the comeback weren't in the game at that time. Tari (Eason) was not in, Aaron (Holiday) was not in and those guys really brought us back. We had plenty of timeouts to use and we had wide-open looks so I don't think it was fatigue. Both teams were playing a lot of minutes and we had wide-open looks that didn't fall. ""You've got to knock down shots at the end of the day and they're as wide open as you're going to get."" The Pacers' struggles with rebounding continued unabated in their 130-119 road loss to the Toronto Raptors on Monday. Indiana finished minus-14 on the glass and entered Tuesday tied for 26th in the NBA with a 47.7 percent rebounding rate, ahead of only the Wizards, 76ers and Thunder. Rebounding isn't a new issue for the Pacers. Last season, Indiana posted a 49.2 percent rebounding rate that ranked tied for 23rd, and the inability to compete on the glass is proving detrimental. Indiana also allowed 18 points off of 11 turnovers against the Raptors, as the Pacers picked up their fourth loss in six games. ""Turnovers and rebounding are possession of the ball,"" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Those are areas where we've just got to continue to talk about it and try to make improvements."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The talented center carries a 13-game point streak into Wednesday's matchup between the Hurricanes and the host Philadelphia Flyers. Necas has 10 goals and 17 assists during his hot streak, and he leads the team in goals (11) and assists (19) in 17 games this season. In fact, he has almost twice as many points (30) as his next closest teammate, Andrei Svechnikov (16). Most recently, the Czech Republic native notched two goals and two assists in Sunday's 4-1 triumph over the St. Louis Blues. It was his first multi-goal game of the season, and he helped Carolina to its 11th win in the last 13 games. ""Obviously when things are going your way, you're in the zone,"" Necas said. ""That's what I'm feeling. I'm trying to get there and stay there as long as I can. We've talked about confidence and you try to bring it each night. It's not about just one guy, obviously. We're outplaying teams at 5-on-5 and that's huge."" Eric Robinson added a goal and two assists for the Hurricanes, while Svechnikov also scored in a game that Carolina won comfortably despite not playing its best. ""You're not always going to have your A-game,"" Robinson said, ""but you've got to find ways to win in this league."" Philadelphia also didn't play its best in its most recent outing -- a 3-2 loss to the Colorado Avalanche on Monday. The Flyers fell behind 3-0 before scoring twice late in the third period to make things interesting. ""I think we shot ourselves in the foot a little bit,"" said Owen Tippett, who scored one of the Flyers' two goals. ""They're a quick team and they transition fast. I think we gave them a little more than we should have and found ourselves behind."" Veteran coach John Tortorella was a bit blunter in his assessment. ""A lot of the game I liked as we kept on going, but (expletive), we do stupid stuff,"" Tortorella said. ""It's so aggravating, the stuff that we do that should be out of our game. That's what aggravates me."" Wednesday marks the third game of a five-game homestand for Philadelphia, which had been 4-0-1 in its previous five contests prior to Monday's defeat. ""We put ourselves in a (spot) to win the game and that's all you can ask,"" Flyers forward Travis Konecny said. ""It didn't play out the way we wanted it to maybe the first half of the game, but we stuck with it. We've been doing the right things and starting to get the results. (On Monday) we didn't get it."" Philadelphia's recent 4-0-1 streak began following a 6-4 loss at Carolina on Nov. 5. Necas starred in that game, as well, scoring the decisive goal with 31 seconds to play. ""It's still early in the year, but I like our group,"" Hurricanes coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""I know we have a lot of guys in here that get how the game needs to be played on a daily basis.

Toronto coach Craig Berube said that Matthews has not suffered a setback, although he had not been skating the past two days. ""It's a little bit of a holding pattern, but he's not getting worse, so that's a good thing,"" Berube said on Monday. ""It's just taking time. He's doing what he needs to do to get back in the lineup and get healthy, and our team needs to just push on."" Matthews led the league with 69 goals last season and has five goals in 13 games this season. In the past six games without Matthews, Mitch Marner has surged with 10 points (four goals, six assists), including the overtime winner in the 4-3 home win over the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday. It was his 200th career goal. ""A lot of guys have elevated their game,"" Berube said. ""Marner with (John) Tavares, they've been a very good line for us, which we need them to be. Mitch has been a real good player all year in all areas of the game, penalty kill, power play, five-on-five, whatever we have asked him to do."" Along with Matthews, the Maple Leafs will be without Ryan Reaves, who was suspended five games for an illegal hit to the head on Edmonton's Darnell Nurse on Saturday, and forward Calle Jarnkrok, who has not played this season and underwent groin and sports hernia surgery Monday. Toronto also put forward David Kampf (lower-body injury) on injured reserve Tuesday and recalled forward Fraser Minten from the Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League. The Golden Knights will open a five-game road trip at Toronto after losing 5-2 to the Washington Capitals on Sunday. ""We weren't on our toes early. We just weren't playing in the first period,"" Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""We weren't executing (to) the best of our abilities. At the end of the first period, they didn't have very much either. ... We deserve better if we get a little puck luck and then get back to playing winning hockey, but that didn't happen.""  The Golden Knights were limited to six shots on goal amid their indecisive play in the first period. ""If you're not going to shoot it, then hang on to it and make a play that's not too risky or isn't a whole play,"" Cassidy said. ""(Sunday), there was a little more of that in our game."" This is the first of two meetings this season between the teams. Vegas is 3-3-2 on the road and Toronto is 8-3-0 at home. The Golden Knights swept a two-game trip at Anaheim and Utah before losing to Washington at home.

Neither team has played since Nov. 9, with each coming off bye weeks. The last time Georgia Tech played, the Yellow Jackets (6-4, 4-3 ACC) delivered one of the biggest upsets of the college football season, knocking off then-No. 4 Miami in Atlanta, 28-23. In the program's first win against a top-five team since 2009, Georgia Tech became bowl-eligible for the second straight season -- the first time the Yellow Jackets have done that since qualifying for 18 straight bowl games from 1997-2014. Georgia Tech aims to build on that momentum on Thursday, when it vies for its first win against the Wolfpack since 2019. ""We've had a couple extra days to get our guys healthy,"" Georgia Tech head coach Brent Key said. ""To me, your signature win is your last win and you're only as good as your next one. We're focused on putting together the best plan for NC State and having that be our most electric game of the season. Key played for Georgia Tech from 1997-2000 and said Thursday night home games were some of his fondest memories. ""To give these seniors one last, lasting memory of Bobby Dodd Stadium, it can't be more important,"" Key said. Georgia Tech quarterback Haynes King is coming off a two-touchdown performance (one passing, one rushing) against Miami, while Jamal Haynes ran for 83 yards and a score. King has passed for 1,600 yards and nine touchdowns this year, along with 446 rushing yards and seven scores on the ground. Haynes has rushed for a team-best 681 yards and nine touchdowns. Standing in the way of a celebratory senior night is North Carolina State (5-5, 2-4), out to clinch a fifth straight bowl bid. Last time out, the Wolfpack had their season-best two-game winning streak snapped in a 29-19 home loss to Duke. North Carolina State managed just 268 total yards as true freshman quarterback CJ Bailey was held to 184 passing yards. At the tail end of a disappointing season, the Wolfpack still have an opportunity to finish their year on a high note. ""It's how you finish. That's what we've been talking about,"" North Carolina State head coach Dave Doeren said. ""You've got two opportunities, and you need at least one to be in a bowl situation. How we finish matters, and now we've got to do it against a team that's peaking.""

Emma Raducanu of Great Britain swept Viktoria Hruncakova 6-4 6-4, and Rebecca Sramkova lost her first set to Katie Boulter, putting Slovakia's backs against the wall. Sramkova then charged back for a 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 victory, prevailing despite a 23-15 disadvantage in total winners. Sramkova saved 5 of 11 break points, broke Boulter's serve on 6 of 10 opportunities and had a 9-4 edge in aces. Hruncakova returned to the court with Tereza Mihalikova for the winner-take-all doubles match against Heather Watson and Olivia Nicholls. In a clean hour and 15 minutes, the Slovakian team won 6-2, 6-2, saving all four break points while picking off half their return games. Slovakia reached its first Billie Jean King Cup final since 2002, the year it won its only title in the event.

Milwaukee has won three of its last four games heading into a matchup against the visiting Chicago Bulls on Wednesday. Chicago snapped a two-game skid with a 122-112 win over the Detroit Pistons on Monday. The improving Bucks emerged with a 101-100 victory over the visiting Houston Rockets on Monday after Damian Lillard scored with 3.9 seconds remaining. Brook Lopez had 27 points, 10 rebounds and four blocks for Milwaukee, which snapped the Rockets' five-game winning streak. Giannis Antetokounmpo finished with 20 points and 13 assists. ""I think everybody's competing,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I love to see it. This is what we have to do. Everybody has that individual pride. Everybody knows that you gotta guard. In order for us to win games, you gotta guard. There's not any other way. I think players have taken that to heart and they're going out there trying to guard the best way they can."" Lillard returned after missing three games (concussion protocol) and had 18 points along with a season-high 10 assists. The Bucks held Houston to 40 percent shooting from the field and 28.1 percent (9 of 32) from 3-point range. ""I feel like we're getting unified on the defensive end and we're buying in more a little bit,"" Bucks guard Gary Trent Jr. said. ""Obviously how we started the season we've changed some of the things we've done on the defensive end now with switching more, so it's less fighting through screens and less having to do extra things."" Milwaukee is looking to even the season series against Chicago after losing 133-122 on Oct. 25. The Bulls turned in an encouraging outing on Monday after allowing a total of 287 points in back-to-back losses to the Cleveland Cavaliers and Houston. The Bulls hit a low point in Sunday's 143-107 loss to the Rockets. Chicago was outscored 41-26 in the second quarter and allowed Houston to shoot 52.4 percent from the field for the game. Chicago coach Billy Donovan was pleased with his team's resilience on Monday, when they bounced back by holding the Pistons to 15-of-44 shooting from 3-point range (34.1 percent). ""Just grit, toughness, fight back,"" Donovan said. ""At some point, you have to make a stand physically, and we tried to make a stand physically. That was certainly not what we did at all (Sunday) night."" Nikola Vucevic had 29 points and 12 rebounds in Monday's victory, while Zach LaVine added 25 points. Vucevic is off to an impressive start this season, averaging 20.7 points while shooting 59.4 percent from the field, 48.4 percent from 3-point range and 84.8 percent from the foul line. ""I just wanted to come into this season and be me and play my game,"" Vucevic said after Monday's win. ""I know what I am capable of and what I can do. I started off the year well and I just want to continue to play that way. Tonight, I wanted to be more aggressive, take a little more of the lead on both ends of the floor, play off my teammates."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

As many as 10 scenarios for the second spot opposite the Ducks could play out over the final two weeks of the regular season, according to the Big Ten.  The undefeated Ducks are on a run of five consecutive weeks as the top-ranked team in the nation and are headed to Indianapolis on Dec. 7 no matter what happens in their Nov. 30 game against Washington, a rematch of the 2023 Pac-12 championship game.  Big Ten officials reviewed all possible tiebreaker procedures before finally certifying the first-year league member will play next month in the title game.  With an 11-0 record and 8-0 standing in Big Ten games, there is no feasible tiebreaker scenario that would eliminate the Ducks from the conference championship game. The Indiana Hoosiers (10-0, 7-0) are the only other undefeated team left in the Big Ten. But to have a chance to book its spot opposite Oregon, Indiana will have to win at Ohio State on Saturday. The Buckeyes (9-1, 6-1) have won 28 consecutive games in the series.  Oregon holds a 32-31 win over Ohio State in the Oct. 12 game at Eugene. Ohio State, in turn, holds the advantage over Penn State (9-1, 6-1) by virtue of a 20-13 win earlier this month. But even if Ohio State beats Indiana, the Buckeyes have their annual rivalry game with Michigan (5-5, 3-4) on Nov. 30 left as the potential roadblock to a rematch with Oregon.  If the Buckeyes lose to Michigan, winning percentage among conference opponents between Indiana and Penn State would decide the second team in the title game.  That equation will likely be undecided until the final games are played. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Bruins are 8-9-3 for 19 points, tied for third in the Atlantic Division and seventh in the Eastern Conference. Boston is 31st of 32 teams in averaging 2.40 goals per game and is 28th in allowing 3.45 goals per game. General manager Don Sweeney promoted associate coach Joe Sacco to interim head coach. ""Jim Montgomery is a very good NHL coach and an even better person,"" Sweeney said in a statement. ""He has made a positive impact throughout the Bruins organization, and I am both grateful and appreciative of the opportunity to work with him and learn from him."" The Bruins have lost four of their last five games, including home defeats to St. Louis in overtime on Saturday and to Columbus 5-1 on Monday. ""Our team's inconsistency and performance in the first 20 games of the 2024-25 season has been concerning and below how the Bruins want to reward our fans,"" Sweeney said. ""I believe Joe Sacco has the coaching experience to bring the players and the team back to focusing on the consistent effort the NHL requires to have success. We will continue to work to make the necessary adjustments to meet the standard and performance our supportive fans expect."" Montgomery, 55, guided his first Bruins team in 2022-23 to a 65-12-5 record for 135 points and an .823 points percentage -- all NHL single-season marks. He was honored with the Jack Adams Award as top coach. However, the Florida Panthers stunned the Bruins in seven games in the Eastern Conference opening round in April 2023. Last season, Boston won its first-round series against the Toronto Maple Leafs in seven games before falling to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Panthers in six games. In 184 games, his Bruins were 120-41-23 in the regular season and 9-11 in the playoffs. Montgomery also coached the Dallas Stars in the 2018-19 and 2019-20 seasons, going 60-43-10. ""On behalf of the Boston Bruins, we thank Jim Montgomery for his accomplishments and impact on our organization,"" team president Cam Neely said in the statement. ""Jim's open and honest communication with players, staff and management, as well as the positive attitude that he brought to the rink every day, helped lead our franchise to several on-ice accolades, including a historic 65-win season in 2022-23. We wish Jim and his family the best moving forward both personally and professionally."" Sacco, 55, has been with the Bruins as an assistant coach (2014-24) and associate coach this season. He was the head coach of the Colorado Avalanche from 2009-13, compiling a 130-134-30 record. A former assistant with the Buffalo Sabres (2013-14), Sacco also played 13 NHL seasons for five teams from 1990-2003. ""I'm supportive of Don's decision to address our current play and performance,"" Neely said. ""Joe Sacco has a wealth of experience and knowledge of our roster and can help lead our team in the right direction. He has a strong understanding of our standards and expectations, and I trust he will do all he can to accomplish our organization's goals this season."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Siri, 29, figures to fill a spot in center field for the Mets with Harrison Bader not expected to return to the club. Siri spent parts of the last three seasons with the Tampa Bay Rays and played in a career-high 130 games in 2024, with 116 starts in center field. He batted .187 this past season but hit 18 home runs and 47 RBIs while stealing 14 bases. In his four-year major league career with the Houston Astros (2021-22) and Rays (2022-24), Siri is a career .210 hitter with 54 home runs, 136 RBIs and 43 stolen bases over 356 games. Orze, 27, was a fifth-round draft pick by the Mets in 2020 and made his major league debut in 2024.

""I'm happy where I am, man,"" Sanders told reporters Tuesday. ""I've got a kickstand down. You know what a kickstand is? ... That means I'm resting. I'm good, I'm happy, I'm excited. I'm enthusiastic about where I am. I love it here, truly do."" The No. 16 Buffaloes are 8-2, already doubling their win total from last season's 4-8 finish, which was Sanders' first at the helm. He signed a five-year $29.5 million contract with Colorado after the 2022 season, which saw the Buffaloes fire Karl Dorrell midseason and notch just one win. Now, at 6-1 in the conference, they're two wins away from competing in the Big 12 title game and are pushing for an appearance in the College Football Playoff. This success has prompted speculation that Sanders could fill one of several coaching vacancies, including at the NFL level, with former Dallas Cowboys teammate Michael Irvin among those suggesting Sanders could wind up in Dallas if the team parts ways with current coach Mike McCarthy. Sanders, however, spoke highly of his younger players and the expectation that Colorado's success will continue, despite the likelihood that key players like Heisman Trophy candidates Travis Hunter and Shedeur Sanders, Deion's son, will depart for the NFL after this season. ""It says a lot about what we plan on being and the stability that we're going to be here for a while,"" he said. ""We ain't going nowhere. We're about to get comfortable.""

Aberg doesn't need to play this week to maintain his tour eligibility, but after taking most of the fall off to have knee surgery, the Swede is eager to defend his title this week in Sea Island, Ga. ""I've had some time off, it's been quite nice,"" Aberg told reporters Tuesday. ""I had surgery on my knee, so I had about four weeks off from golf. The first two weeks I did not miss it at all, I'm not gonna lie, but last couple of weeks it's been itching in my fingers quite a bit. So it's been nice to get back into practicing, playing a lot more at home."" ""Home"" for the 25-year-old Aberg and his girlfriend is now a house in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., near TPC Sawgrass. It's less than a two-hour drive north to get to Sea Island, where many other professional golfers make their homes. Less than 18 months ago, Aberg had just finished a successful collegiate career at Texas Tech and received a tour card through the PGA Tour University pathway. He won on the DP World Tour last September, made the European Ryder Cup team and then finished his year by capturing the RSM Classic. Aberg shot back-to-back rounds of 9-under 61 on Sea Island's Seaside Course on the weekend to pull away for a four-shot victory. ""Obviously I've always liked coming to Sea Island. ... It's a place that I really like coming to and the golf has been great to me so far, so looking forward to keeping that up,"" Aberg said. Aberg hasn't won a tournament since, but the highlights of his 2024 season included a second-place finish at the Masters and a T2 at the BMW Championship, the penultimate leg of the FedEx Cup playoffs. But during the spring, his knee began to act up on him, and he hunkered down and played through the pain. Soon doctors advised him to have surgery, so he went for it the first week after the playoffs in early September. It was his first major surgery, and he didn't hit balls for about four weeks. Aberg is the +900 favorite at Fanduel Sportsbook to win the RSM again against a weaker field. Most of the field is ranked nowhere near as high as Aberg's No. 5 spot in the Official World Golf Ranking; other players are instead focused on finalizing their spots in the top 125 of the FedEx Cup Fall points standings to guarantee eligibility for 2025. They'll have to contend with a healthier, stronger and more rested Aberg. He had his surgery and rehab in New York, so he and his girlfriend had an easy time enjoying their time off. ""It's been nice to have a little break,"" Aberg said. ""It was probably the first break that I've had from golf since my senior year in college, so it was quite nice to kind of reflect a little bit, sit down and not having to go play a tournament at some point. ""Last couple weeks I've been itching to get out here. It's been a long time coming, it feels like."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Investments in women's sports are nothing new to Kang, who donated $50 million in July for women's health initiatives in sports, then donated $4 million to the U.S. women's rugby sevens program after the Paris Olympics, while also creating her own sports science nonprofit.

He was joined this past weekend by Las Vegas tight end Brock Bowers, Tennessee wide receivers Calvin Ridley and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine and Detroit defenders Za'Darius Smith and Malcolm Rodriguez showing off their renditions following big plays. ""There's no issue with a celebratory dance such as what took place (Sunday) or the previous week with the 49ers on November 10,"" NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told Front Office Sports. ""It's up to the networks to cover them as they see fit."" NFL rules allow for players to celebrate so long as they're not excessive and don't feature violent or sexually suggestive acts. Players are also not allowed to wear printed hats or clothing that promote their political opinions, and Bosa was fined $11,255 for wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" hat on the field. However, the ""Trump Dance"" is not considered a political statement by the league. Stars in other sports have also displayed the dance since the election two weeks ago, including UFC champion Jon Jones and U.S. Men's National Team soccer player Christian Pulisic, who celebrated with the dance following a goal against Jamaica on Monday night. Bowers said he came up with the idea to celebrate a touchdown on Sunday with the ""Trump Dance"" after seeing Jones do it during the UFC event the previous night.

And Maxey, in the team meeting, called on Embiid to stop being tardy ""for everything"" because of the impact his lateness has on the rest of the team, per ESPN. Because of injuries, illness and a three-game suspension to Embiid, the three have yet to play together. ""Tyrese loves Big Fella, but this is the elephant in the room,"" someone in the meeting told ESPN. Veteran Kyle Lowry reportedly summoned the team and coaches to the meeting after Philadelphia's 106-89 loss to the Miami Heat. Embiid apparently accepted the criticism from Maxey, with the pair described by ESPN as close friends. Embiid -- who was an All-NBA pick and the MVP in 2022-23 -- has played in just three games this season. Coach Nick Nurse also heard from players that they want tougher coaching, while Nurse's staff expressed that players need to up their game in practice. Embiid, per ESPN, said he sometimes is confused by what's going on on the court. Maxey, signed to a five-year, nearly $204 million offseason deal, strained his right hamstring on Nov. 6 and has been out since but is expected to return soon.  George, a nine-time All-Star, inked a four-year, $212 million deal as a free agent in the offseason. A bone bruise in his left knee has limited George to seven games. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Seminoles (1-9) have lost six in a row and one more loss would match their worst record after 11 games since going 1-10 in 1974. Florida State's worst record ever was a winless 0-11 season in 1973. ""What they've been able to do this year obviously as a football team, our performance is nowhere near what any of us expect or what we desire,"" Florida State coach Mike Norvell said. ""So we go back and evaluate where our potential disconnects, where can we have maybe a bigger point of emphasis to get the desired result that we want, and that comes in every area."" A loss to a struggling FCS program in Charleston Southern (1-10) could make things even worse for Florida State. During the bye week following a dismal 52-3 loss at Notre Dame, the Seminoles made sweeping changes to Norvell's staff, releasing offensive coordinator Alex Atkins, defensive coordinator Adam Fuller and longtime receivers coach Ron Dugans. FSU just had its worst season in conference play since joining the ACC, going 1-7. After hosting the Buccaneers, the Seminoles close out the season at home against rival Florida. ""I thought the guys have handled the changes, some of the changes there just around the program. I think guys have handled it really well,"" Norvell said. ""Obviously, everybody has feelings about that, coaches, players, all of us, just anytime you do have change, but I thought they did an outstanding job of coming in, focusing on the moment, continuing to push and work, and just looking to play our best game here this week and going to be able to put that on display."" The Bucs are coming off a deflating 16-13 overtime loss to Eastern Illinois despite their defense recording a season-high seven sacks. It clinched Charleston Southern its first winless season in Big South/Ohio Valley Conference play since 2011.  The Bucs also had a pair of interceptions by Leon Thomas and Ja'Kobe North while Dylan Manuel had a sack and recovered a fumble which was forced by Darrius Bell, who also had a sack. ""Our guys, this season, they have fought and have bled and given us everything we could ask for,"" Charleston Southern coach Gabe Giardina said. ""I feel bad for them because this is a difficult way to lose."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Mustangs won their third consecutive game under first-year coach Mike DeGeorge, improving to 3-2 overall, with their 82-78 win at Eastern Washington on Sunday. Cal Poly already is only one win shy of reaching its 2023-24 win total, when the Mustangs finished 4-28 overall and 0-20 in the Big West. Seniors Owen Koonce (19 points) and Mac Riniker (15) led the Mustangs in scoring against Eastern Washington. Koonce and Isaac Jessup, another senior, lead Cal Poly with an average of 14 points a game while Riniker is the top rebounder at 5.8 a game. ""As we continue to build a confidence and figuring out a formula for winning these close games, it just only grows our confidence and makes it more and more comfortable for us to be in those circumstances,"" said DeGeorge, who came to Cal Poly after going 141-43 in six seasons at Division II Colorado Mesa. While DeGeorge is relying on his senior leadership, Arizona State coach Bobby Hurley's lineup features a couple of the most dynamic freshmen in the nation in Joson Sanon and Jayden Quaintance. Sanon and Quaintance combined for 31 points and 23 rebounds in Sunday's 81-66 victory over visiting St. Thomas-Minnesota. Sanon had 18 points and nine rebounds for the Sun Devils (4-1) in a reserve role. ""He looks like he's got that look,"" Hurley said of Sanon. ""He's really confident, playing the way I expect him to play. It's why we brought him here and why people think he's an NBA prospect. That's what he looks like."" Quaintance finished with 13 points, 14 rebounds and three blocked shots. ""Besides the points, I loved how he was going after the glass and rebounding for us,"" Hurley said of Quaintance. ""And then just his normal defense was kind of what I'm used to seeing from him from that end of the floor."" Arizona State also was led by Ball State transfer Basheer Jihad, who posted 20 points and six rebounds. He averages a team-leading 13 points per game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Ryan Preece has thrown the aforementioned proverb to the wayside. On Tuesday, RFK Racing announced that Preece will be the pilot of the organization's third NASCAR Cup Series entry in 2025, marking Preece's third Cup Series team in five years. It's a welcome opportunity for the 34-year-old from Berlin, Conn., whose previous team in Stewart-Haas Racing shut down at the conclusion of the 2024 season. Preece's career has been marred by constant criticisms and the narrative that the short track ace doesn't have what it takes to compete in the Cup Series. After making his Cup Series debut at his home track of New Hampshire Motor Speedway in 2015, Preece waited until 2019 for his first full-time opportunity at NASCAR's highest level. Preece teamed up with JTG-Daugherty Racing and Kroger -- who ironically, was announced as a new primary sponsor of RFK alongside Preece's signing on Tuesday -- and remained with the team through the end of 2021. In 2021, however, Preece's No. 37 was an unchartered entry, quickly becoming a money pit for the organization. Just like that, Preece was back to square one. Soon, a hero emerged in the form of three-time Cup Series champion Tony Stewart, who chose Preece to drive the No. 41 at Stewart-Haas Racing in 2023. Preece remained with the team in 2024, but in May, it was announced that SHR would shut its doors after the season came to a close. For the second time in three years, Preece was left looking for opportunities. Just like his Stewart-Haas teammates, though, Preece's talent was noticed. As Josh Berry, Noah Gragson and Chase Briscoe were signed to the Wood Brothers, Front Row Motorsports and Joe Gibbs Racing, respectively, talks were underway to bring back RFK Racing's third Cup Series entry for 2025, with Preece behind the wheel. Preece's signing marks a fresh start for both driver and team, and puts a feather in the cap of co-owner Brad Keselowski. Preece marks the first full-time driver signing RFK has made since Keselowski became a co-owner of RFK in 2022. Preece's results in the Cup Series so far can't be sugar coated. During his tenure with both JTG-Daugherty and Stewart-Haas, he failed to win or make the playoffs. In five full-time seasons, he only has 14 top-10 finishes. In his defense, however, JTG-Daugherty was still an organization trying to find stability after the departure of AJ Allmendinger. By the time 2023 rolled around, Stewart-Haas was long removed from their success in 2020, and in 2024 the team's employees were focused on finding work for the future. RFK Racing will be the most stable situation Preece has walked into during his Cup Series career. It's an organization on the rise, and a team coming off of five wins and four playoff appearances between its two cars over the last two seasons. Preece doesn't have any excuses to put forth mediocre results at RFK, but if he performs to his potential, that won't be a problem. --Samuel Stubbs, Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Jacksonville enters its bye week at 2-9 with a tiebreaker edge over the Cleveland Browns (2-8). Cleveland is No. 2 in the current draft order by a slim margin over a pack of teams with the same record: the New York Giants, Las Vegas Raiders and Tennessee Titans.  New England (3-8) and the New York Jets (3-8) are slotted sixth and seventh in front of the Carolina Panthers (3-7), Dallas Cowboys (3-7) and Cincinnati Bengals (4-7) in the top 10. The Titans and Jaguars play each other twice, including Week 17, and the Jets are at Jacksonville on Dec. 15, one week before Raiders-Jaguars in Las Vegas. All 32 teams play 17 regular-season games, meaning the 2024 season is more than 50 percent complete for every club but all teams have at least six games remaining on the schedule. The Jaguars selected No. 1 in 2020, drafted Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence, and again in 2021. Jacksonville's surprise pick was defensive end Travon Walker in a decision that came down to two pass rushers. They passed on Michigan defensive end Aidan Hutchinson, who went No. 2 to the Lions. The Browns last held the top pick in 2018 and chose Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield. Cleveland's draft class that year also featured another first-rounder in Ohio State cornerback Denzel Ward (No. 4 overall) and 35th overall pick Nick Chubb.

According to TVision, 56 percent of all television viewing in the United States between midnight and 1 a.m. ET was to Paul vs. Tyson, which generated an estimated average minute audience (AMA) of 108 million live viewers globally. Paul won a unanimous decision over the 58-year-old Tyson in a sanctioned, modified eight-round fight. The co-main event featured a women's title bout rematch with Katie Taylor defeating Amanda Serrano a second time in a debated outcome.

Terrible. Absolutely horrendous,","Georgetown coach Ed Cooley did not approve of his team's defensive effort in Saturday's loss to Notre Dame. ""F-minus. Terrible. Absolutely horrendous,"" he said following the 84-63 defeat. The Hoyas (2-1) hope to tighten the screws when they host improved Mount St. Mary's on Wednesday night in Washington, D.C. Georgetown allowed the Fighting Irish to shoot 59.3 percent overall and surrendered its most points in three games so far. The Hoyas fell behind 19-7 less than eight minutes into the contest and trailed by as many as 25. ""We didn't guard a soul,"" Cooley said. ""... It was a bad collective of energy, focus and determination."" Saturday's setback was the first real growing pain for Georgetown, which has just two upperclassmen on its roster. ""I personally thought we were more prepared,"" junior guard Jayden Epps said. ""Coach thought we were more prepared. We all did. I feel like now we see what it takes."" Malik Mack led the Hoyas against Notre Dame with 19 points and Epps had 13. The latter averages 14 points per game, second on the team. Forward Thomas Sorber leads the Hoyas in scoring (19.0 points) and rebounding (8.7). The Mountaineers (3-1) used another balanced scoring effort to beat visiting St. Francis 66-58 on Saturday.  Terrell Ard Jr. and Dallas Hobbs tallied 12 points each as Mount St. Mary's had five double-digit scorers for a second straight game. Hobbs leads the team with 17.3 points per game, while Ard and Dola Adebayo each supply 10.8 points. The win was the Mountaineers' second straight under first-year coach Donny Lind and propelled the program to its best four-game start since 1996-97. ""Every day, we're just trying to go 1-0,"" Lind said. ""We've talked to these guys since June ... about just trying to win that day one possession at a time."" Valuing those possessions a little better would help. Mount St. Mary's has 81 turnovers through its first four games, but Lind doesn't want to change much about his team's up-tempo offense. ""We'll slow it down a little bit, but I really want them to figure out how fast we can play without turning it over,"" he said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The team announced Tuesday that the 39-year-old forward is considered week-to-week pending further evaluations with team physicians on Wednesday in Washington, D.C. Ovechkin exited with 14:30 remaining in Monday's 6-2 win over the Utah Hockey Club in Salt Lake City following a collision with Utah forward Jack McBain. After what appeared to be inadvertent contact, Ovechkin crumpled to the ice and took a moment to get to his skates. He was helped off the ice by teammate Jakob Chychrun and sat on the bench briefly before returning to the locker room. Ovechkin scored two goals before the injury and has 13 in his last 11 games. With 868 goals in his career, the Russian veteran needs 27 to break Gretzky's mark of 894 set from 1978-99. Ovechkin tied an NHL record on Monday when he scored against a 178th different goalie, Utah's Connor Ingram. He now shares that mark with Jaromir Jagr. In addition, Ovechkin posted his 100th multi-goal road game, becoming the first player to hit that mark. The Capitals, winners of three straight games, next play on Thursday against the visiting Colorado Avalanche. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

But with a 3-8 record, the Jets are all but mathematically eliminated from the NFL Playoffs and decided to get a head start on blowing things up. According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, Douglas’ contract was set to expire at the end of the season. But the Jets didn’t want to wait six more weeks.  One can ponder what exactly Douglas did wrong that warranted losing his job today. At the time Saleh was fired in early October, the Jets still had some hope for the season. But with just a 1 percent chance at making the postseason and the trade deadline in the rearview mirror, they decided to blow things all the way up at the bye week and start planning for next year. The latest firing in New York comes off the heels of the Jets falling to the Indianapolis Colts. The Colts had turned back to Anthony Richardson after a tumultuous start to their own season, and the 22 year-old bounced back, securing a victory against the Jets. Between firing Saleh and Douglas, the Jets did convince pass rusher Haason Reddick to report to the team on a reworked deal, but that seemed more like owner Woody Johnson’s doing. They also traded wide receiver Mike Williams to the Pittsburgh Steelers for a fifth-round pick at the deadline. He only has one catch with the Steelers. Douglas did have some hits with the Jets, including drafting wide receiver Sauce Gardner, Garrett Wilson, Jermaine Johnson and Breece Hall in the same class. But with a 30-64 record in over five years, the Jets decided that the results just were not there. Of course, this firing will come with more speculation that Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers is calling the shots behind the scenes. While he probably did not singlehandedly make the move to fire Douglas before Week 12 kicks off, the fact that the Jets have failed with Rodgers only added pressure to an uncomfortable situation. Remember, Zach Wilson was a Douglas selection, and that No. 2 overall pick panned out so poorly that the team had to desperately pivot to trading for Rodgers, which hasn’t worked out much better. The Jets will regroup and host the Seattle Seahawks on December 1. They close their underwhelming 2024 campaign with the Miami Dolphins twice, Jacksonville Jaguars, Los Angeles Rams and Buffalo Bills. It’ll be up to the next GM to find the quarterback of the future for the Jets. Copyright 2024"

The Nittany Lions will aim to continue their impressive start to the season Wednesday when they host Purdue Fort Wayne in non-conference action.  Penn State (4-0) has won its first four contests by 42, 49, 30 and 22 points, respectively.  In Friday's 86-64 victory over Virginia Tech, Zach Hicks and Ace Baldwin Jr. each scored 19 points. Nick Kern Jr. chipped in 16 points on 6-of-7 shooting, while Baldwin added 10 assists and Freddie Dilione V registered four of the team's 16 steals.  ""There's no guarantees in sports, but I like where we're going. I like how much these guys are working, I like how much they care about each other,"" Rhoades said.  The Nittany Lions have three more contests against mid-majors -- including this one -- before a showdown with No. 6 Purdue on Dec. 5. In the meantime, the win over Virginia Tech proves that Penn State is not to be taken lightly.  ""I think that counts (as a statement win),"" Baldwin said after the victory over Virginia Tech. ""We had a long week of practice. Coach was on us the whole week, and I think we did good today.""  Purdue Fort Wayne (3-1) has scored at least 90 points in all three of its wins, most recently a 93-74 rout of Southern Indiana on Saturday. Jalen Jackson scored a career-high 29 points, knocking down 11 of 19 shots while chipping in four rebounds, three assists and three steals.  ""My teammates just trusted me,"" Jackson said. ""On our team, it could be anyone's night. We have a really deep roster. ... This game, it was me. We're just all interchangeable with everybody on the team.""

""You don't need to worry about anybody in that locker room giving everything they've got and more and how bad they feel when they get beat on a play or get beat in a quarter or the whole game, at all,"" Jones said Monday following the Cowboys' seventh loss of the season. ""I don't ever worry about that."" Jones said he regrets pulling the plug too soon on head coaches in the past, including firing Wade Phillips after a 1-7 start in 2010. ""I've regretted that. That's the music I'm listening to,"" Jones said. There are no plans for an in-season move involving head coach Mike McCarthy in Dallas, where the Cowboys (3-7) are winless at home by a league-worst margin of minus-118. McCarthy said ""it's frustrating for everybody"" to accumulate losses, but he knows the only thing that might save his job when his contract runs out in January is ending the season with a string of wins. ""There is good coming out of this,"" McCarthy said Monday night. ""You don't see it because we're not winning games, but there's young men that are getting an opportunity to do more and I do believe it'll pay forward. It needs to hurry the hell up, because we need it in six days."" The Cowboys went 12-5 last season and discussed a path to the Super Bowl throughout the offseason. Expectations did not match the current reality. Jones said he's counting on the Cowboys sticking together through what he described as tough times, similar to Dallas going 1-15 his first year as owner in 1989. ""And we've had other tough years. And this one, we didn't anticipate the record. And the way we're playing right now, we wouldn't have anticipated that,"" Jones said. ""But, not, this isn't -- y'all have heard me tell these old stories until you're sick -- but not, you stay in this league long enough, you'll have times like this."" Jones, of course, could change his mind with the Cowboys in the midst of three games in 11 days. Their 34-10 loss in primetime to the Texans on Monday night was the third consecutive home loss by a margin of at least three touchdowns. The Cowboys also suffered a 34-6 loss to the NFC East-leading Eagles and began their current five-game losing streak with a 47-9 spanking at the hands of the Detroit Lions. Dallas has a quick turnaround for Week 12 against former defensive coordinator Dan Quinn, who quickly righted the ship with the Washington Commanders (7-4). ""This is it, man. We got seven losses. We've got to go. Backs against the wall. We got to fight, scratch and claw. We've got to do everything we can to go win the next game,"" McCarthy said. ""That's where my mind's at. That's what I'm going to coach and that's the expectation. We've got to win."" The Cowboys are in the spotlight for their traditional Thanksgiving Day game in what is set up as a matchup of backup quarterbacks -- Cooper Rush for Dallas and Tommy DeVito for the New York Giants -- and play again on ""Monday Night Football"" 11 days later against the Cincinnati Bengals. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

As a member of the Player Advisory Committee, Harman was part of the group of players charged with evaluating the pro and cons of reducing the field sizes for several tournaments.  ""I can't even begin to elaborate on how many discussions that we had and ideas going back and forth,"" Harman said on Tuesday ahead of this week's season-ending The RSM Classic. ""It's so nuanced and it's so detailed that it's not like a short interview about it isn't going to do it justice, but we were in the room, we discussed every possible scenario and this is kind of what everyone came up with."" That scenario includes a reduction in fully exempt players on tour in a given season. Beginning in 2026, players who finished in the top 100 of the prior year's FedEx Cup standings will keep full status, down from the top 125 this year. Players finishing Nos. 101-125 in the FedEx Cup standings would receive conditional status. Only 20 PGA Tour cards will be awarded to Korn Ferry Tour graduates rather than 30, among other minor changes to membership policies. The fields at standard tournaments, currently at a maximum of 156 players, will be reduced to 144, with consideration for certain fields to be cut to 132 or 120 players based on daylight and pace of play. The Players Championship, the most prestigious non-major tournament in golf, will go from 144 players to 120. These changes also will not take effect until 2026. The changes have stirred debate among the rank-and-file, with Lucas Glover among them. The former major champion said earlier this week that the policy board ""think we're stupid,"" and suggested the tour enforces its pace of play issues rather than cost professionals their jobs. ""I'm not numb to the fact that we're cutting opportunities, right? It's not something that sits well with me and it doesn't sit well with anyone that was in any of those discussions,"" Harman said. ""But all these decisions that get made, they're all not good or all bad.  ""We're looking at every single kind of pro and con to every piece that moves around and trying to figure out the most equitable, fairest way to have a great product at the same time providing enough playing opportunities for everyone. Harman said the PAC was broken into separate subcommittees to each evaluate different potential pathways. At the end of the day, the math simply doesn't work out for 156-player fields on one course during times of the year with limited daylight hours. ""Daylight's a big thing, can't finish,"" he said. ""The Tour's been expanding for the last I don't know how many years and just we're trying to come up with the best possible product for television, for the players and to make sure that people have pathways to get in.  ""I feel as though when we get into some of these 156-man fields, you can look at the parking lot out here, there's nowhere to park and (Sea Island) is two golf courses, thank goodness. But 156 on one golf course, it's hard to navigate a practice round, it's hard to navigate where to get food.  ""I mean, logistically it just makes it a lot, a lot tougher."" Harman has three victories since joining the PGA Tour 12 years ago, highlighted by his win at The Open Championship in 2023. At just 5 feet, 7 inches tall, he's one of the shorter hitters on tour and is a noted grinder who has carved out a lengthy career with excellent iron play and a strong short game. Currently 24th in the Official World Golf Ranking, Harman has been as high as eighth but was also 123rd to begin the 2020 season and 141st to open 2017. So it's safe to presume Harman doesn't classify himself as among the ""cool kids"" Glover said are driving the decisions that most benefit them. ""If you're one of the guys that you feel like you're going to affected by it, you're very upset by it and I understand that, I would feel the exact same way,"" Harman said. ""They're really hard conversations to have because for me, I've been on every side of that token. I've been 100 to 125, I've been 70 to 100, I've been 1 to 20. I understand how all those blocks feel and for me to, like, having to discuss how that stuff gets moved around, it's extremely, extremely difficult and it's not comfortable."" On the flip side of the debate, Harman believes that playing well throughout a season is now more rewarded than ever before on the PGA Tour. ""There's a ton of different ways to look at it,"" he said. ""For the first half of my career, I finished top-50 two or three times, right? Two of three times out of four or five times, and what you were rewarded for that was essentially not much. You got to start your season the same time two weeks later at zero, you weren't in any World Golf Championships, you weren't in any majors, you weren't in any bigger tournaments.  ""Now if you go out and you have a nice year on the PGA Tour, you finish in the top 50, you're in the elevated events, you have an incredible opportunity and that opportunity is because you've had a great year.  ""You've never been more rewarded for playing great golf right now and I think that's a really cool place for the Tour to be in.  ""You look at all of the information that's presented and you do your best to make the best possible decision for the most amount of people."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""Bob is one of the original Bulls greats,"" owner Jerry Reinsdorf wrote in a statement.

"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Processing the Distrust: Philadelphia 76ers Devolve Into NBA Laughingstock,https://deadspin.com/processing-the-distrust-philadelphia-76ers-devolve-into-nba-laughingstock/,2024-11-19T16:29:33.856Z,"With drama surrounding the Philadelphia 76ers less than quarter of the way into the season, they have truly devolved into the NBA laughingstock.","I saw this post making the rounds on the socials the other day, and it stuck with me: “Possibly the only true pearl of wisdom I’ve heard from 94WIP, ever: The Philadelphia 76ers are a PR firm, not a basketball team.” With the proper hat tip to that anonymous WIP host or caller, I think the comparison is apt. Four weeks into the regular season, 76ers statements and injury updates outpace wins on the basketball court roughly 50 to 2. It’s all about words with this team. What they’re saying, what’s being said about their star player, and when the next update on someone’s availability will be. The latest statement from on high took the form of a cagey admission from coach Nick Nurse an hour after the 76ers lifelessly gave away a 19-point lead in a 106-89 loss at the Miami Heat late Monday night. “Sorry for the delay. We just had a little meeting. ... Won’t get into specifics of that meeting, but happy to answer any questions about the game,” Nurse said. Joel Embiid kept the details of the meeting private, pretending he didn’t know the 76ers had one, and the internet overreacted accordingly.  But I can’t blame basketball fans for not taking Embiid or Nurse or the Sixers seriously. Now 2-11 and playing some surprisingly horrendous basketball, this is a team without any obvious solutions, and the constant hoopla about who’s playing, who’s hurt and who’s resting makes them ripe for mockery. The Philadelphia Inquirer got itself entangled with the Embiid injury saga earlier this month when controversial columnist Marcus Hayes made the poor decision to connect Embiid’s willingness to show up to work to his son and his late brother. This was followed by the most bafflingly phrased live-tweeting of a locker room altercation we’ll ever see from beat writer Keith Pompey. But as mad as fans want to be about Embiid’s ensuing suspension (for shoving, not assaulting, Hayes), the Inquirer didn’t create the 76ers’ awful start. Here’s which areas of the game the 76ers are bad at: Everything. They rank last in the NBA in scoring (103.3 ppg), assists (21.2 per game), and effective field goal percentage (49.6%). They rank 29th in 3-point shooting (31.6%) and rebounding percentage (46.5%). They’re 28th in assist-to-turnover ratio (1.46), and while Philadelphia’s defense rates as middle-of-the-pack, the rim protection is beyond weak. A team rostering Embiid shouldn’t rate 29th in blocks and 27th in points per shot allowed at the rim. So let’s talk about Embiid, who of course was listed as doubtful for the Miami game with an illness before he suited up to play. The most optimistic Sixers fan may still argue that the team has not played a single game with their new big three—Embiid, Tyrese Maxey and Paul George—healthy at the same time, and things can turn around when they’re all back. But in the five games Philadelphia has had two of those three together, it’s gone 0-5! It doesn’t exactly inspire confidence. Embiid on Monday had his worst output since late in the 2020-21 season, scoring just 11 points in 31 minutes, and he didn’t get to the foul line a single time. Kyle Lowry has started the last six games with Maxey out and made a grand total of six field goals in that time. The silver lining for Sixers fans is Jared McCain, who’s finding his way nicely in his rookie year. But when your first-round draft pick is leading you in points per possession, it’s almost like a backhanded compliment to the rest of your roster. All told, Monday’s team meeting was a drop in the bucket in the noise surrounding the 76ers. They’ll be on to something new tomorrow, or whenever we get the next update on Maxey’s hamstring. But something tells me all three stars getting healthy simultaneously isn’t enough to solve the core problems of this franchise. Copyright 2024"

The Bulldogs (4-0) scored a season-low 80 points to deal San Diego State only its fourth double-digit home loss under coach Brian Dutcher on Monday behind 23 points in 20 minutes from Graham Ike and 19 from Ryan Nembhard. The seniors scored 30 of Gonzaga's 40 points in the second half, hanging another quality wins pelt on the wall and building a resume worthy of a No. 1 NCAA Tournament seed. The Bulldogs survived SDSU's smothering defense but made only 1 of 9 second-half 3-point tries. Nembhard, Michael Ajayi, Nolan Hickman and Khalif Battle combined to shoot 2 of 14 from 3-point range. Head coach Mark Few credited Nembhard, who had 10 assists and three turnovers, for keeping Gonzaga on course against a physical defense in the first road game of the season. Gonzaga helped itself by making 27 of 31 foul shots; Ike and Nembhard made a combined 17 of 19. Nembhard has an assist-to-turnover ratio of 8-1 with 40 assists and five turnovers, a steady and consistent calm Few will lean into even more as Gonzaga packs for Nassau and its opening game against West Virginia on the eve of Thanksgiving. ""He controlled that whole game for 40 minutes. I don't think anybody is playing better in the country than him at the point spot,"" Few said. ""In this environment, against that defense, that kind of physicality and the difficulty communicating ... he was absolutely huge.""

The Beach dropped to 1-3 in a 63-61 loss to Portland on Saturday, trimming an eight-point deficit in the final 3:26.  Devin Askew's attempted game-winner didn't fall. The defeat came six days after a heartbreaking loss to South Dakota State, which drained a 3-pointer with 1.5 seconds left in an 80-79 victory. First-year coach Chris Acker has 12 newcomers on his roster after the 2023-24 season ended with Long Beach State (1-3) parting with former Gonzaga coach Dan Monson only for The Beach to make a run to the NCAA Tournament by winning the Big West conference tournament.

More pressure exists for UCF (4-6, 2-5), which is on its fourth starting quarterback of the season. Coach Gus Malzahn has shuffled from KJ Jefferson, who started the first five games, to EJ Colson, then Jacurri Brown, who lost the job after throwing four interceptions in losses against BYU and Iowa State. Malzahn has placed the ball in the hands of Dylan Rizk, a Florida native who completed 44 of 59 passes for 523 yards, three touchdowns and one interception in a 35-31 loss at Arizona State and a 56-12 home win over Arizona.  The latter is UCF's only win in the past seven outings. The Knights' offense revolves around the run game, starting with RJ Harvey, the leading rusher in the Big 12. He has amassed 1,328 yards, 19 touchdowns and seven 100-yard games.   To achieve bowl eligibility, the Knights roll out of the bye week in a must-win matchup at West Virginia, then also win their home finale against struggling Utah.  ""We're focused on this game, not the next game,"" Malzahn said Monday. ""(We're) going to a tough place to play, there's no doubt about it. They're a team that's similar to us that got after us pretty good last year."" The Mountaineers (5-5, 4-3) beat UCF 41-28 in Orlando last season.  In that win, quarterback Garrett Greene rushed for three scores and completed 14 of 23 pass attempts for 156 yards.  This season, the senior from Florida has passed for 1,589 yards with 11 TDs and nine interceptions and rushed for 600 yards and five scores.  West Virginia enters the matchup on a down note, losing 49-35 at home to Baylor last Saturday.  Due to proximity, Mountaineers coach Neal Brown knows Malzahn well from their days coaching in Alabama, when Brown led Troy and Malzahn walked the sidelines at Auburn.  ""Coach Malzahn wants to run the football,"" Brown said Monday. ""They're one of the top rushing offenses in the country. It starts with their running back, Harvey. He was really good last year, (but) he's elite this year. Tough to tackle, makes people miss and has a great feel for their zone schemes that they're running.""

The teams' experiences this year have been similar, yet still different. Purdue (1-9, 0-7) comes in on a nine-game losing streak since a season-opening shutout over Indiana State. Just two years removed from an appearance in the Big Ten championship game, the Boilermakers have regressed badly in the second year under head coach Ryan Walters.  For Walters, the plan is simple for the final two games of the season.  ""Go out and compete,"" he said. ""You know, but a good game plan together, offense, defense, special teams. Play clean, competitive football and go win some games."" The Boilermakers enter the game last in the Big Ten in both points scored (17.2 per game) and points allowed (38.9). Their leading rusher, Devin Mockobee, has run for 652 yards and three touchdowns. Purdue will hope to snap its long losing streak against a Michigan State team that also comes in on a losing streak. The Spartans (4-6, 2-5) have lost three straight games since a win over Iowa on Oct. 19, the latest being a 38-16 defeat at Illinois last week. Michigan State also lost at Michigan and at home to undefeated Indiana in that span.  The silver lining for Michigan State is that bowl eligibility is still a possibility after not qualifying for a bowl game since 2021. The Spartans can gain bowl eligibility with home wins over Purdue and Rutgers to close the season, which could be a building block in Jonathan Smith's first year at the helm.  ""I'm not going to be up here asking for patience,"" Smith said. ""We're not patient people. We do have perspective of we want to get some things established. Immediately, results haven't come, but I'm confident in the process we're taking. And we're continuing to develop the current roster and then, just everywhere, you're going to have new guys on the roster, and confident the results will come.""

Quarterbacks of national championship hopefuls predictably factor into the Heisman competition, with Miami’s Cam Ward and Oregon’s Dillon Gabriel among the primary quartet. But with Boise State’s Ashton Jeanty, a non-Power Five conference star, and Colorado two-way sensation Travis Hunter, this year’s race offers more intriguing storylines than some of the quarterback-heavy classes of finalists. The following comes with the necessary caveat that three games can feel like a lifetime in the pursuit of the Heisman. A current outsider could deliver monster performances in the coming weeks and gain ground among the fickle voting population. Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart, whose team is in College Football Playoff contention, is a name to remember. Based on their resumes through Week 12, the Heisman favorites rank in this order: Everywhere Gabriel’s gone—from UCF to Oklahoma and now to Oregon—he’s excelled. He’s eclipsed 3,000 yards passing for the fifth time in his career and has done so in 2024 while completing a career-high 73.8 percent of his attempts. As quarterback of the No. 1-ranked team in the country, Gabriel’s positioning as a Heisman contender is expected. But part of the reason the Ducks are in the hunt for a national championship also works against Gabriel’s Heisman case. Sharing the backfield with outstanding ball carrier Jordan James and operating in a balanced offense, Gabriel hasn’t had to put up eye-popping numbers for Oregon to win. His 22 passing touchdowns and six rushing scores are impressive but may not sway Heisman voters in an era when quarterbacks routinely put up 40 touchdowns. The qualities that might cost Gabriel Heisman votes but help make Oregon a national title contender are the very things that boost Ward’s Heisman candidacy. Miami’s in the hunt for the Playoff thanks in no small part to Ward’s individual heroics. In three consecutive one-score wins over Virginia Tech, Cal, and Louisville, Ward passed for 343, 437, and 319 yards with 10 combined touchdowns. That remarkable stretch is the backbone of Ward’s nation-leading numbers in passing yards (3,494), yards per game (349.4), and touchdown passes (32). Ward’s numbers were no less impressive in defeat. He racked up 348 yards and three touchdowns without an interception in a loss to Georgia Tech. The Washington State transfer by way of Incarnate Word has come a long way from running the Wing-T in high school. His is a great story, but it isn’t the best Heisman candidacy in this year’s class. There have been a handful of dual-role Heisman winners in the award’s illustrious history, but none have ever played on both sides of the ball as much—or as effectively—as Colorado wide receiver-cornerback Travis Hunter. While impressive, neither his 911 yards on 74 catches with nine touchdowns nor his eight pass breakups and three interceptions are Heisman-worthy on their own. Combined, however, Hunter is having an unprecedented season. Hunter also benefits from hype, an undeniable factor in any Heisman race. Various oddsmakers have the Buffs' two-way star as the favorite through Week 12, media personalities like Shannon Sharpe have stumped for him, and Hunter used an appearance on Robert Griffin III’s podcast to tout his candidacy at fellow contender Ashton Jeanty’s expense. Hunter’s logic was specious: he posited a hypothetical about how many yards he’d have on 95 receptions (the number of carries Jeanty had at the time). At his current pace of 12.3 yards per catch, the answer to that is a solid 1,169—almost 700 yards shy of DeVonta Smith’s 1,856 when he became the last receiver to win the Heisman in 2020. And, applying Hunter’s ground rules based on usage, the receiver/cornerback has been on the field for 519 snaps—almost exactly double the number of carries Jeanty has logged for Boise State. Hunter has a worthy Heisman case on its own merits, but getting into the Jeanty debates invites comparisons that objectively favor the BSU running back. It’s taken Ashton Jeanty 10 games to surpass the complete-season rushing champions of the previous four seasons. Although this ranking is based on production through Week 12, it’s worth noting that Jeanty will almost certainly surpass the 2,000-yard mark in Week 13 with presumably two more games before Heisman weekend. Jeanty’s pursuit of Barry Sanders' record is likely to fall short, though that only serves to underscore just how sensational Sanders was in 1988. Among other all-time great seasons for running backs, Jeanty has already outproduced Heisman winners like Eddie George and Reggie Bush and is well on pace to surpass Ricky Williams and Rashaan Salaam. Lest anyone disparage Jeanty’s output on the level of competition, he rushed for 192 yards and three touchdowns against the nation’s No. 1-ranked team, Oregon. In his worst game, he rushed for 128 yards. In contrast, Hunter had back-to-back games (vs. Kansas State, at Arizona) of three receptions for 26 yards and two catches for 17 yards with no pass break-ups or interceptions. In this Heisman class—and among all running backs since Sanders set an impossibly high bar for the position 36 years ago—Ashton Jeanty stands out. Copyright 2024"

Chaz Lanier (13.8) and Jordan Gainey (11.0) are also scoring in double figures.   Tennessee coach Rick Barnes' squad has all the pieces in place for an anticipated chess match against Virginia.

Sunday's win was the 600th home game for Barnes at Tennessee, compared to just two home games for interim coach Ron Sanchez at Virginia. Sanchez took over lat month for three-time national coach of the year Tony Bennett and has carried over an affinity for tough defense and strong perimeter play.   The Cavaliers are allowing just 53.7 points per game and averaging 6.0 blocked shots. Offensively, Virginia ranks in the top 10 in the country shooting 44.6 percent from 3-point distance.   Virginia made 14 of 25 shots (56 percent) from behind the arc in last week's win against Villanova. Isaac McKneely was a perfect 6 for 6 from the perimeter and scored a game-high 23 points to lead three Cavaliers in double digits.   ""He'll be the first one to tell you (that) he shot the ball well because his teammates passed him the ball at the right time and on target,"" Sanchez said of McKneely, who averages a team-high 16.0 points per game.   Jacob Cofie contributes 13.0 points and a team-high 7.7 rebounds and Elijah Saunders (10.3) is the third Cav scoring in double figures in the early going.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Aggies (3-1) shrugged off a season-opening loss at UCF and played arguably their best basketball of the season in their most recent outing, a 78-64 win at home over then-No. 21 Ohio State on Friday.  Wade Taylor IV and Manny Obaseki had 15 points apiece to lead Texas A&M, but it was the Aggies' defense and aggressiveness that stood out as the difference. Texas A&M took charge with a 12-3 run to open the game and held Ohio State to 21.9 percent shooting from the field in the first half and 33.9 percent for the game while outscoring the visitors by 16 points overall from the free-throw line. The Aggies shot 40 free throws to just 22 for Ohio State. ""The adjustments that our staff made relative to their (Ohio State's) personnel and talent was tremendous,"" Texas A&M coach Buzz Williams said. ""We had six turkeys (three stops in a row) in the first half, and we got two stops to end the first half and one to begin the second half. ""Those first 20 minutes of the game were really good. Analytically, I would say it's the best 20 minutes we've had."" Zhuric Phelps finished with 14 points for A&M while Henry Coleman III had 12. Texas A&M continues to flash a balanced offensive attack and gritty defense - and doesn't seem if some view their winning style as ""ugly."" Aggies bench players accounted for 40 of the 78 points against the Buckeyes. ""I don't think we worry too much about what other people think,"" Taylor said. ""I think us coming out here (against Ohio State) and playing for one another showed what our program is built on. We know we have a deep team. We have a lot of veteran guys ready to step up and make plays, and we did that and will continue to do that."" The schedule will get more difficult for the Aggies after Wednesday's game. Texas A&M's next five contests will be against Power Four teams, beginning with Oregon and No. 14 Creighton Nov. 26 and 27, respectively, in the Players Era Festival in Las Vegas. Southern (1-3) rolls into the Brazos Valley after a 131-42 home walloping of Ecclesia College on Saturday. Puoch Dobuol and Jayce Depron scored 16 points each and paced eight Jaguars scorers in double figures against their outmatched opponent from the National Christian College Athletic Association. Jordan Johnson added 14 points for Southern, which led 59-12 at halftime and scored 72 points in the second half. The Jaguars had 26 steals that led to 59 points off turnovers. ""One of the things we do is we try to pick people up (defensively),"" Southern coach Kevin Johnson said after his team forced 33 total turnovers. ""That's what we do. I don't want to come out here and not work on the stuff that we do."" The win over Ecclesia came after losses at South Dakota, Iowa and East Texas A&M. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Moving past recent struggles is the mission at Michigan (5-5, 3-4 Big Ten) as the Wolverines reel from four losses in the past five games following a promising start. ""It was buy-in week,"" Michigan coach Sherrone Moore said. ""We really took it upon us to make sure that we're all bought into the next two games, to do everything we can to get better, and really working on the fundamentals, the little things ... make sure we're all in."" The Wolverines nearly overcame extended sluggishness in a 20-15 loss at then-No. 8 Indiana on Nov. 9, but they fell a yard short of converting a fourth-and-10 in the closing minutes to curb their comeback bid. Michigan scored just one touchdown in three trips inside the red zone, a 1-yard scoring run from Kalel Mullings with 9:35 to play. Quarterback Davis Warren was limited to 137 yards on 16-for-32 passing while the run game gained only 69 yards on 34 carries. Moore said there was ""fire"" and ""energy"" in practices this week after a few days off. He said the relative disappointment of the team's current record after reaching the college football mountaintop with a perfect record (15-0) and national title last season doesn't change the importance of playing a postseason game.  ""It's huge for the program, obviously, playing another game, getting another chance to play with your team, but building on the future. Building, getting more practices,"" Moore said. ""It's like another spring ball for the young guys. It's more football for the guys that need to keep getting better at football. So it's huge for us, and huge for the program."" Michigan has won seven consecutive games in the series with Northwestern.  Also in the hunt for a bowl bid, Northwestern must accomplish something it hasn't achieved this season to reach the postseason. The Wildcats (4-6, 2-5) need to win consecutive games. In its most recent matchup, Northwestern fell 31-7 to No. 2 Ohio State at Wrigley Field last Saturday. Quarterback Jack Lausch passed for 201 yards and rushed for 44 and Northwestern's lone TD. But the offensive line allowed four sacks, and Lausch lost a fumble while running downfield. Northwestern coach David Braun realizes that winning won't be easy in Ann Arbor, where the Wolverines are 36-6-2 against the Wildcats. ""Our guys just gotta do a great job of really eliminating interference,"" Braun said. ""... Whether it be the crowd noise, whatever that looks like. I'm confident that our group will handle that the right way and focus on what really matters. And that's the 60 minutes of football we gotta go play."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

On the bright side, Friday's high-scoring win served as NBA prospect Ace Bailey's official introduction to college basketball. Bailey and the Scarlet Knights conclude a season-opening four-game homestand against Merrimack on Wednesday in Piscataway, N.J. Rutgers (3-0) entered the season with plenty of hype thanks to five-star recruits Bailey and Dylan Harper, considered the second- and third-best freshmen in the incoming class. Bailey sustained a reported hip flexor injury in practice days before the team's season opener against Wagner. The Scarlet Knights got by without him, beating Wagner by 23 points and staving off Saint Peter's by 10. Then Bailey joined Harper in the lineup for the first time against Monmouth, and the result was a 98-81 victory. Rutgers shot 59.6 percent overall and 55.0 percent from deep to score its highest point total in coach Steve Pikiell's nine-year tenure. The Scarlet Knights won despite the absence of starting guard Jeremiah Williams, who was nursing a shoulder injury and could be back this week. ""We still got to work on a lot of things,"" Pikiell said. ""We didn't have Jeremiah Williams (Friday), so we get Ace Bailey back, but we lose a guy like him. So hopefully we get him healthy and back into the swing of things, but a good team win, and everyone contributed."" Harper led the team in scoring for the third straight game, tallying 20 points to go with five rebounds and six assists. As for Bailey, he knocked down a corner 3-pointer on his first shot attempt, added a highlight-reel dunk on an inbounds play and wound up with 17 points and six rebounds. ""Obviously (Bailey) hasn't practiced for a little bit and I thought he gutted it out for us,"" Pikiell said. ""Some big rebounds. Just gives us another dimension on the court. And he'll keep getting better, too, like this. I like this team a lot. We got to get better, and obviously he's a big part of that."" Merrimack (1-2) has played a challenging nonconference schedule as it prepares for its first season in the MAAC. By opening against Vermont, VCU and Princeton, the Warriors faced three teams projected to win their conferences in their respective preseason polls. After taking down Vermont 65-51 and falling flat against VCU in a 63-42 road loss, Merrimack took a 14-point first-half lead against visiting Princeton on Sunday before the Tigers clawed back for a 68-57 victory. Adam ""Budd"" Clark has paced Merrimack in each of its first three games and is averaging 20.7 points, 4.3 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 3.0 steals per contest. Clark, a do-it-all guard, is the Warriors' heir apparent to Jordan Derkack, who won Northeast Conference Player of the Year last season before transferring to Rutgers. A 17-ppg scorer last year, Derkack has put up 7.7 points, 5.7 rebounds and 4.0 assists per game for the Scarlet Knights so far -- including nine assists on Friday. Merrimack coach Joe Gallo is excited to see his former protege again. ""I laugh because if I had a dollar for everyone that asked me if I thought (Derkack) could play there, I probably would just quit my job,"" Gallo said. ""The answer was always yes."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The No. 8 Crimson Tide will see another ranked Big Ten squad on Wednesday when they battle No. 25 Illinois in the C.M. Newton Classic at Birmingham, Ala. Alabama (3-1) was outclassed 87-78 in the showdown against the Boilermakers. But coach Nate Oats indicated there is a method behind the madness of playing a road game against a team that lost in last season's NCAA title game. ""We schedule these games for a reason,"" Oats told reporters. ""We like to go against the best teams in the country and figure out what we have to work on, and we have plenty to work on because (the Boilermakers) are good. Braden Smith is one of the best guards in the country and he does not turn the ball over. As a team, they only had three turnovers."" The Crimson Tide struggled defensively but received a solid offensive performance from freshman guard Labaron Philon, who scored 18 points on 7-of-10 shooting. Philon is averaging 12 points through four games. ""Labaron has been really good. Probably better than what we thought he was going to be,"" Oats said. ""I thought he had a pretty good game. But we got to keep developing our bench. We got to keep developing the young guys and they got to help us win a lot of games this year."" Mark Sears had 15 points and six assists but made just 5 of 15 shots against Purdue. The first-team All-American is averaging a team-best 17.3 points but his high outing is just 20. Last season, Sears scored 20 or more points on 26 occasions while setting a school record with 797 points. Illinois (3-0) won its first two games by 45 and 32 points, respectively, before posting a 66-54 home win over Oakland on Wednesday. Fighting Illini coach Brad Underwood said the Golden Grizzlies affected the speed of the game by their cautious approach and a zone defense that forced patience and perimeter shots. The Illini didn't respond well, committing 18 turnovers and making just 7 of 25 3-point attempts. ""The biggest, most important, takeaway for me is it's not always fun and easy and free flowing,"" Underwood said. ""There's going to be some grind-it-out games. I thought we handled that pretty well for the most part, but we've still got some things to work on."" Tomislav Ivisic recorded 20 points, six rebounds and four steals to continue his strong start. He has a team-best five steals and also leads in rebounding at 9.0 per game in addition to being the squad's second-leading scorer at 17.3. The 7-foot-1 Croatian made 9 of 14 field-goal attempts while finding open creases in the Oakland defense. ""We were preparing for their zone the whole week,"" Ivisic said. ""The coach was asking for me to be in the middle spot. That I would have a lot of space there to help my teammates, assist them, or have open shots."" Will Riley, who is averaging 17.7 points and 6.0 rebounds off the bench, had just eight points on 2-of-8 shooting against Oakland. Alabama has won three of the four meetings between the schools. In the most recent contest, Alabama rolled to a 79-58 home win in the first round of the NIT. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Seven of those came in overtime, when Northwestern held the Panthers scoreless.  Nick Martinelli added 16 points.  Coach Chris Collins was pleased with his team's showing. The Wildcats have a relatively new-look group that is still adapting to life without their former leader, Boo Buie.  ""Really, really proud to be able to dig that win out tonight,"" Collins said after the game. ""You know you have a winning culture when you win a game like that.""  Leach said he is embracing the Wildcats' culture despite playing for the Big Ten program for less than a month.  ""(Coach Collins) kind of talked to me about that before I even came here -- that I was going to have a big role this year,"" Leach said. ""I'm just confident in my abilities, the work that I put in.""  The Wildcats' focus will shift to the Bobcats (1-3), who will play their second Big Ten opponent this season. They lost their season opener to Wisconsin 79-67, and their lone win came against Northwest Indian College on Nov. 11 -- a 93-35 drubbing. It is a quick turnaround for the Bobcats after playing at Denver on Sunday. They nearly erased a 19-point deficit in the final nine minutes before losing 79-78 as a B.J. Kolly shot attempt rolled off the rim. The Bobcats had 13 turnovers and shot just 10 percent (1 of 10) from 3-point range, and coach Matt Logie -- unlike Collins -- was dismayed by his team's effort for much of the game. ""I'm very disappointed in the way that we came out and competed for a large sector of the game today,"" Logie said. ""We found a group that was successful at the end because of their energy and their spirit and their toughness, but ultimately as a group what I thought would translate today was our experience and our maturity, and it didn't happen.

Will Tuesday's visit from the Ducks remedy an ailing attack? Chicago certainly hopes so. Outscored 15-6 while losing four of their past five games, the Blackhawks return home searching for a spark. A brief road trip to Seattle and Vancouver left little to be desired offensively. Ilya Mikeheyev scored 6:50 into the game against the Canucks on Saturday but the Blackhawks couldn't sustain momentum in a 4-1 defeat. ""Our quality scoring chances were up,"" Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson said. ""Just can't find the back of the net. Lack of drawing penalties, too. We can't seem to get enough chances there, which would probably help a little bit in production."" Calder Trophy recipient Connor Bedard has been especially eager to contribute. While he leads Chicago in both assists (10) and points (13), Bedard is seeking his first goal since Oct. 26 against the Dallas Stars. He has collected just four points in nine games since, including three assists during the Blackhawks' 4-2 win at Anaheim. Philipp Kurashev, Chicago's second-leading scorer from the 2023-24 season, has just four points this season while Teuvo Teravainen has one point in his past 13 games. ""We have to just start looking at the simple part of our game, (so) that can add more offense,"" Richardson said. ""I don't think we're a team built yet to open it up and go back and forth, like Edmonton or Colorado can."" Anaheim has won three of four after earning a 4-2 road victory against the Stars on Monday night. Defenseman Olen Zellweger put the Ducks on the board just 56 seconds into the game while Brett Leason added a goal at 5:44. The flurry helped Anaheim play with greater confidence behind goaltender Lukas Dostal, who made 34 saves. ""We came out, we played a solid, 200-foot game, kept pucks going north. And I thought that's why we had a 2-0 lead after the first 10 minutes,"" said Cutter Gauthier, who had a goal and assist. ""The more we do that to start off games, the better it's going to be for us moving forward."" Brock McGinn left the game for the Ducks with a lower-body injury, but Anaheim showed its forward depth to win back-to-back games for the first time this season. Leason added two assists for his first career three-point game. ""Kind of just play as hard as I can every day. Just do the simple things. Do everything correctly,"" he said. ""Do everything that coach asks of me. Give it my all, pretty much."" Taylor Hall assisted on two goals in the first meeting between the Blackhawks and Ducks but was a healthy scratch against Vancouver. Hall said the move ""surprised"" him, but he expects to face the Ducks after speaking with Richardson. ""I just want to play better and be better for our team,"" Hall said. After Tuesday, the Blackhawks and Ducks won't meet again until March 1, when they conclude the season series in Anaheim. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Senators are 5-2-1 at home this season, although it has been a month since the team played consecutive games in Ottawa. The Senators have played eight of their last 12 games on the road, posting a 5-6-1 record during that tough stretch. ""The one-offs are part of the NHL, but it'll be good to get home, get two feet on the ground,"" Ottawa coach Travis Green said. ""We've played some pretty good hockey in our building, and we've obviously got a big week against some good teams."" In keeping with the inconsistent nature of Ottawa's season, the Senators haven't had a winning or winless streak of longer than two games. Ottawa is 0-1-1 in its last two outings and is looking to rebound from a 4-0 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes on Saturday. The Oilers also were blanked in their last game, 3-0 by the Montreal Canadiens on Monday. Edmonton outshot Montreal 30-25 but couldn't score in what has become an unexpectedly common problem for the Oilers. Over the previous four seasons, Edmonton averaged a league-high 3.59 goals per game. Through 19 games this season, the Oilers are almost a full goal below that mark, with an average of 2.63 goals per game. Forward Derek Ryan said the Oilers need ""to get a little more greasy"" in their offensive approach, and ""find some ways to get on the interior parts of the ice"" to help generate more scoring chances. ""Battles in front of the net, some (second- and third-chance shots), it's where you score goals when you're struggling to score. ... We're not going to score pretty goals all the time,"" Ryan said. ""We've got to kind of grind it out and get a greasy one every now and then."" Tuesday's game could be an intriguing chess match in the neutral zone, as the two teams are among the NHL's best at both amassing and limiting shots. Edmonton is averaging 33.2 shots per game, and Ottawa isn't far behind at 32.4. At the other end of the rink, the Oilers' opponents are averaging only 25.3 shots per game, while the Senators' foes are averaging 26.8. Leon Draisaitl (13 goals, 11 assists) and captain Connor McDavid (seven goals, 14 assists) continue to carry the bulk of the Oilers' offensive load. Draisaitl and McDavid have combined for 20 of the team's 50 goals this season. Tim Stutzle leads the Senators with 21 points (seven goals, 14 assists). Linus Ullmark likely will start in goal for Ottawa on Tuesday. Ullmark is 4-4-1 with a 2.77 goals-against average in 10 games this season. Stuart Skinner will start for Edmonton in the second game of the back-to-back set. He is 5-5-2 with a 3.28 GAA in 12 starts. Facing the Senators could be a boost to Edmonton's fortunes, given the one-sided nature of the recent history between the two teams. The Oilers are 12-2-1 in their last 15 games against the Senators, dating to the 2020-21 season.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

However, as the Hawkeyes get ready to host Rider on Tuesday night in Iowa City, results from the first four games suggest Iowa is unbeaten in part because of defense. Take the Hawkeyes' 76-66 win over Washington State in Moline, Ill., on Friday, for example. Iowa clamped down on defense in the second half, holding the Cougars to 11-of-32 shooting from the field in the second half and using full-court pressure to force a pair of critical 10-second violations. ""We held them to 34 percent in the second half,"" McCaffery said. ""That's a really good team to hold to 34 percent. You have to be a connected group. That's what we talked about at halftime, we have to be more connected defensively."" While four games is a small sample size, Iowa is rated 77th in kenpom.com in adjusted defensive efficiency, 80 spots better than it finished last season. The Hawkeyes also boast turnover and block rates in the top 60 nationally. Meanwhile, the Broncs (3-1) enter on a three-game winning streak after losing their season opener at UCLA. Rider last played on Nov. 12, connecting on better 52.9 percent of its shots to earn a 90-79 victory at Navy. Jay Alvarez scored a season-high 19 points, going 5 of 7 from 3-point range, and T.J. Weeks Jr. contributed 18 points to go along with seven rebounds. The Broncs earned a 37-26 rebounding advantage but had only five fastbreak points, a testament to how they will executed their halfcourt sets. ""When you win, it just becomes infectious and everybody wants to be a part of it,"" Rider coach Kevin Baggett said. ""We've just got to get better at practicing the right way every day. Once everybody gets locked in and understanding all the nuances of what we're asking them to do defensively, the sky's the limit for us."" The Hawkeyes earned a 104-71 home win on Dec. 22, 1987, in their only previous matchup with the Broncs. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Picked to win the Southern Conference at the beginning of the season, Samford (4-1) is coming off a season in which it went 29-6 and made the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2000. The Bulldogs have high expectations again this year, with returnees Collin Holloway and Rylan Jones being named to the preseason all-conference team and Jaden Brownell (Illinois-Chicago) and Trey Fort (Mississippi State) headlining a group of transfers. Brownell (15.6 points per game) is the team's leading scorer through five games, with Fort and Holloway tied for second at 12.4 ppg. The biggest obstacle Samford might have to overcome is fatigue, given the Bulldogs played on Sunday, earning a 97-82 home win over Texas Southern. Samford coach Bucky McMillan said given the short turnaround, players taking care of themselves and recovering will be a big priority. ""They obviously are a very good team,"" McMillan said of the Spartans. ""They've got a lot of size. It's going to take all the energy we have in that game."" Samford will hope to pull the upset over a Michigan State team that was tested severely on Saturday in an 86-72 home win over Bowling Green. The Spartans (3-1) trailed 72-68 before ending the game on an 18-0 run. The biggest strength so far for Michigan State has been balanced scoring. Seven players scored in double figures against Bowling Green. For the season, three players are within one point of the team lead (Jaden Akins is at 12.0 ppg while Frankie Fidler and Jaxon Kohler are at 11.8). Eventually though, Michigan State coach Tom Izzo hopes a go-to scorer or two can emerge. ""I don't know if we can keep it going, but it sure is nice to know that we have different guys that can score it in different ways,"" Izzo said. ""We got to keep just riding that horse until a couple guys break out and start really making shots, and then we'll go from there."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Alabama A&M (3-1) is facing its first power conference team of the season and just its second Division I opponent. The Bulldogs beat Oakwood, Arkansas Baptist and Fisk to start the campaign before falling to Tennessee State in Nashville on Saturday, 81-71. Led by coach Otis Hughley Jr., the Bulldogs welcomed back 11 players from the 2023-24 team, including the reigning Southwestern Athletic Conference Freshman of the Year in Chad Moodie. ""This year we have a lot of two-way guys that just need to get experience and exposure,"" Hughley said. ""Hopefully that will set in before conference play and we can take off running from there."" Moodie leads the team with 14.8 points and 7.3 rebounds per game, while London Riley chips in an average of 13.7 points.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Now the Washington Capitals and their captain will wait to see if he will miss more than just the end of a blowout win. After scoring two goals in what would be a 6-2 win over the Utah Hockey Club in Salt Lake City, Ovechkin collided with Utah forward Jack McBain while trying to get the puck out of the defensive zone with 14:30 left in the game. After the players caught each other in the legs in what appeared to be inadvertent contact, Ovechkin crumpled to the ice and took a moment to get to his skates. The 39-year-old veteran was helped off the ice by teammate Jakob Chychrun and sat on the bench briefly before going back to the locker room. He did not return. After the game, Capitals coach Spencer Carbery told reporters Ovechkin was still being evaluated. The two goals gave the Russian 868 goals for his career, putting him 26 behind Wayne Gretzky's NHL-record total. The goals also gave Ovechkin the NHL lead for this season with 15. The 18 games Ovechkin needed to get to 15 are the fewest in his distinguished career he has taken to hit that mark in a season. He scored a hat trick in a 5-2 win at Vegas on Sunday and has 13 goals in his last 11 games. Ovechkin also tied an NHL record on Tuesday when he scored past a 178th different goalie, Utah's Connor Ingram. He now shares that mark with Jaromir Jagr. In addition, Ovechkin posted his 100th multi-goal road game, becoming the first player to hit that mark. The Capitals, winners of four straight, next play on Thursday against the visiting Colorado Avalanche. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Second-year coach Kim English's team has improved over the opening stretch while holding its first four opponents under 70 points for the first time since 2014-15. Notably, Providence's turnover count decreased for a third straight game -- to only six -- against a Green Bay team that played without the presence of a traditional big man. ""Proud of our guys for finding a way to win,"" English said. ""We're making steps in the right direction. ... The turnovers, really proud looking at that. Some guys have been making some consistent plays that we want to see more of as a group."" Providence junior point guard Jayden Pierre had a particularly strong week, averaging 15.5 points, 3.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists without committing a turnover over the past two games. He scored 18 points on 7-of-10 shooting against Green Bay. Pierre is averaging 11 points per game on the season, just shy of Miami transfer Bensley Joseph's team-leading 12. Freshman forward Ryan Mela added a spark by averaging six points and 4.5 rebounds in two games last week. ""He's a gamer. He's in it,"" English said. ""Ryan's on fire. ... We just want more guys to be on fire."" After losing its first two games at Virginia Tech and Columbia, Delaware State (2-2) has picked up back-to-back wins over non-Division I programs, including a 93-51 decision over Cheyney (Pa.) on Saturday.

Last season, Perkins scored 22 points to guide the Quakers to a 76-72 upset of the Wildcats -- just Penn's 19th win in 70 all-time meetings between the Philadelphia-area schools. However, the freshman guard transferred to Villanova following the 2023-24 season, creating a new look for Perkins heading into Tuesday's clash. ""Everybody knows Villanova basketball. It has made a great name for itself over the years,"" Perkins told VUHoops.com in the spring after announcing his transfer.

He scored eight points in Friday's 70-60 loss to Virginia in which the Wildcats (2-3) struggled to stay close despite a productive night from Eric Dixon (20 points, eight rebounds). ""Obviously, everyone wants to come out and start hot, but that's just not the luxury that we have,"" Dixon said. ""At the end of the day, it's just coming back and trying to figure out a way to get better. This early in the season, that's all it is."" The Quakers (2-2) have lost two straight games, most recently falling 86-69 against Saint Joseph's on Friday. Nick Spinoso led the way offensively with 14 points on 7-of-10 shooting. Penn's issues against the Hawks included getting outrebounded (43-26), turnovers (13) and 3-point defense (38.5 percent) in the team's first lopsided contest of the campaign. The Quakers' first three games were decided by one, one and two points, respectively. ""I'm obviously disappointed, but I'm far from discouraged,"" Penn coach Steve Donahue said. This game is part of the Big 5 Classic series in which the six Division I programs in the Philadelphia area compete for the city crown.

The Volunteers dominated from the opening tip, shooting 56.6 percent from the field and making 10 of 19 3-point attempts. Louisville made only 26.7 percent of its shots overall, including 10 of 39 from beyond the arc. Cardinals coach Pat Kelsey told reporters Monday that his team managed to stay sharp during the hiatus as it prepares for the Knights (0-4). ""Our guys responded the right way,"" Kelsey said. ""They knew where there was a lot of things that we had to improve on and we had to clean up. I loved our mentality and our approach."" So far, Kelsey has been spreading out minutes to showcase an almost entirely new Cardinals roster. No one averages more than 25.5 minutes a game, and nine players are getting more than 15 minutes per contest. Reyne Smith, who played under Kelsey for three seasons at Charleston before transferring to Louisville when his coach took over the program in March, is the Cardinals' leading scorer at 15 points per game. Bellarmine coach Scott Davenport is impressed with the team that Kelsey put together through the transfer portal. ""There is not just experience, but veteran experience from quality programs,"" Davenport said. ""These programs, I am sure, wish they had them back."" Bellarmine, which moved up from Division II in 2020, is in its first season as an NCAA Tournament-eligible team. On Saturday, the Knights fell to Marshall, 83-62.

But we could lose by 15 and we played the right way and did everything we could. ... I'm OK with that.""   It's worth noting that Dawkins and his staff have effectively managed a somewhat downsized roster.

Coach Kyle Shanahan said on Monday that Purdy emerged from the team's 20-17 home loss to the Seattle Seahawks a day earlier with a sore throwing shoulder. Purdy is considered day-to-day as the 49ers prepare for a Sunday road game against the Green Bay Packers. Purdy passed for a season-low 159 yards against Seattle, connecting on 21 of 28 attempts with one touchdown pass and one interception. He also ran five times for 40 yards and a score. A Pro Bowl performer last season while helping San Francisco reach the Super Bowl, Purdy is completing 66 percent of his passes this season for 2,613 yards and 13 touchdowns with eight interceptions. Neither of his backups, Brandon Allen and Joshua Dobbs, has thrown a pass this season. Purdy joins a lengthy list of injured 49ers that added Nick Bosa on Sunday. The star defensive end sustained an oblique/hip ailment that kept him out late in the game, and his absence was conspicuous as the Seahawks drove for the winning touchdown in the final minute. Shanahan said regarding the chances of Bosa returning to face the Packers, ""There's just as good of a chance for him to not play as play."" San Francisco tight end George Kittle sat out Sunday because of a hamstring injury. ""He should practice on Wednesday,"" Shanahan said Monday. ""I know it was close (Sunday), so I think he should be good for practice on Wednesday."" Shanahan added he was unsure whether cornerback Charvarius Ward would return this week after sitting out two games following the death of his 1-year-old daughter. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

New York held a trio of 25-point leads in the frame before Kuzma and Valanciunas ended the first half with baskets to pull the Wizards within 73-54 at the break. The Knicks scored the first seven points of the third quarter, and the Wizards got no closer than 24 thereafter. Brunson had 14 points and Anunoby added nine as New York outscored the Wizards 36-21 in the period to take a 109-75 lead. The Wizards, opposing mostly Knicks second-stringers, opened the fourth with 10 straight points.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Butler, after missing four straight games due to a sprained right ankle, scored a season-high 30 points to go with 10 rebounds and five assists. The Heat trailed by 19 points in the second quarter before coming back to win in just its fifth home game of the season (2-3). Philadelphia, which entered Monday tied Washington and Toronto for the fewest wins in the NBA (2-11), played its sixth straight game without point guard Tyrese Maxey, who has a strained right hamstring. Rookie Jared McCain led Philadelphia with 20 points, and veteran Paul George added 18 points. 76ers center Joel Embiid, who played despite having been listed as questionable due to an illness, finished with 11 points, eight rebounds and five assists in 31 minutes. Miami played without Terry Rozier (right foot discomfort) and Jaime Jaquez Jr. (sprained right ankle). The first quarter, which featured seven ties and six lead changes, ended with Philadelphia ahead 33-25. George scored 12 points in the quarter as Philadelphia shot 54.2 percent from the floor. Butler scored 11 points for the Heat, who shot just 43.5 percent, including 1-for-11 on 3-pointers. Philadelphia made its first six shots in the second quarter to stretch its lead to 46-27 before the Heat scored 24 of the game's next 29 points to close within two. Butler had eight points in the second quarter, while George was kept scoreless as Miami entered halftime down 56-53. The Heat took their first lead since the opening quarter on Duncan Robinson's 3-pointer that made it 65-62 with 7:15 left in the third. Herro shot 5-of-6 from the floor and hit two 3-pointers as Miami closed the quarter on a 15-3 run and carried an 88-72 lead into the fourth. The Sixers, who entered Monday last in the league in scoring, never threatened from there, managing just 17 points in the final period en route to their fourth straight loss. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Casey Mittelstadt chipped in a goal and an assist and Mikko Rantanen set up two goals for Colorado, which has won four of its last five games. Justus Annunen made 24 saves for the Avalanche. Owen Tippett and Tyson Foerster scored for Philadelphia, which lost in regulation for the first time in six games. Aleksei Kolosov (26 saves) got the start in net for the Flyers with Samuel Ersson sidelined due to a lower-body injury. Colorado led 3-0 until Philadelphia scored twice in less than two minutes during the latter half of the third period. First, Tippett beat Annunen with a wrist shot with 8:12 remaining. Then things really got interesting with 6:28 left when Foerster dug a loose puck from under the pads of Annunen and slammed it home. With the goalie pulled, Philadelphia controlled the play in the final minute but was unable to get the equalizer. Makar put the Avalanche on the board midway through the second period. Nathan MacKinnon made a nice reverse pivot along the left boards and centered to the high slot for a wide-open Makar, who skated in and beat Kolosov with a wrist shot. Less than a minute later, Makar appeared to score again, although the goal was disallowed for netminder interference. Shortly thereafter, however, with Colorado on the power play, Makar flipped a seemingly harmless shot from the blue line that got through traffic and beat Kolosov for a 2-0 edge. Makar has 10 career multi-goal games, although this was his first of 2024-25. Mittelstadt expanded the lead to 3-0 with 11:26 remaining in the third period  when he rammed home a rebound off a shot from Rantanen. Referee Mitch Dunning left on a stretcher following a first-period collision with Colorado's Josh Manson.

Pulisic scored in the 13th and 33rd minutes and Ricardo Pepi made it 3-0 in the 42nd minute before Demarai Gray scored for Jamaica in the 53rd minute. Timothy Weah responded three minutes later to make it 4-1 but Gray cut the deficit to two again in the 68th. The U.S. won the total-goals series 5-2 after a 1-0 win in Jamaica on Thursday and will play in the Nations League Finals March 20 and 23 in Inglewood, Calif. The Americans won the inaugural Nations League in 2021 and the subsequent ones in 2023 and 2024. Also, the victory earned the USMNT a berth in the CONCACAF Gold Cup from June 14 to July 6. The Nations League and Gold Cup are the only major competitions for the team until the 2026 World Cup, which the U.S. automatically qualified for as a co-host along with Mexico and Canada. Pulisic scored an exquisite shot for Monday's opening goal. McKennie lofted a long ball into the box where it bounced once before Pulisic sent a left-footed volley past onrushing goalkeeper Andre Blake. A little luck helped Pulisic score his 33rd goal in his 76th match when his shot from the top of the box deflected off the left heel of Jamaican defender Di'Shon Bernard, leaving Blake with no chance to make a save. Pepi scored his 13th goal off the transition with a strike from 18 yards off a pass by Antonee Robinson to go up by three goals. After Gray scored from the center of the box, Weah settled a cross by Yunus Musah before firing a shot under the bar for his seventh goal. Gray put in a rebound of a shot by Renaldo Cephas for his second tally of the night. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Demon Deacons oppose Western Carolina on Tuesday night in Winston-Salem, N.C. It will be Wake Forest's fourth home outing against an opponent from outside power conferences. The Demon Deacons (4-1) are sorting through issues following a 75-60 loss at unbeaten Xavier on Saturday. ""We just couldn't sustain anything offensively without turning it over,"" Wake Forest coach Steve Forbes said. ""That's something we obviously need to get fixed really fast."" Western Carolina (2-1) is a bit of an unknown this season given that its two victories have come against Bob Jones (a member of the National Christian College Athletic Association) and Truett McConnell (an NAIA member) in outcomes with margins of 35 or more points. First-year coach Tim Craft of Western Carolina arrived after coaching at Gardner-Webb. Craft said a roster overhaul with the Catamounts is one of the challenges as the team tries to form an identity. Wake Forest is getting a boost from guard Davin Cosby, who racked up 13 points in the Xavier game as he made his first career start. However, ballhandling snags have been a concern for Wake Forest. ""With 18 turnovers, I don't think you can go and win anywhere,"" Forbes said. Western Carolina has enjoyed some perimeter success on offense. The Catamounts made 14 shots from 3-point range while topping Truett McConnell 99-64 on Wednesday. Western Carolina forward Bernard Pelote, in his third season with the program, said he is trying to become more consistent as he adjusts to many new players around him. ""We do have some young talent,"" Pelote said, anticipating a strong campaign for the team. ""It's not really a matter if it happens, it's a matter of when it's going to happen."" Leading scorer Ice Emery (13.7 points per game) has made a team-high seven 3-pointers, while eight Western Carolina players have connected on multiple treys. Emery is a transfer from Dodge City (Kan.) Community College. Western Carolina's only road game so far resulted in a 64-57 loss at Queens University of Charlotte. The Catamounts will be making the first of three consecutive visits to power-conference opponents, with trips to Florida State and No. 15 Marquette upcoming.

Dmitri Voronkov, Mathieu Olivier and James van Riemsdyk built the Blue Jackets' 3-0 lead at the first intermission before Justin Danforth and Yegor Chinakhov found the back of the net in the final period. Sean Monahan handed out two assists and Elvis Merzlikins was busy making 11 of his 29 saves in the first for Columbus, which had lost seven of its previous eight games (1-6-1) but has won two of three. Charlie Coyle scored the lone goal and Jeremy Swayman stopped 24 shots for Boston, which has lost three straight (0-2-1). The Bruins had a 30-29 advantage in shots but went 1-for-6 on the power play. A wild sequence resulted in Columbus scoring first at 5:15. After Boston could not register a shot on Merzlikins -- who lost his stick -- Dante Fabbro and Monahan broke the puck out to Voronkov, whose backhand shot slid past Swayman as he was hauled down to the ice. Olivier doubled the lead when he scored short-handed at 10:39, driving down the right wing and cutting to the net front to slot home a tight backhander at the crease. While Columbus outshot Boston 12-11, Merzlikins denied both Charlie McAvoy and Georgii Merkulov on point-blank chances off turnovers over the final seven minutes. Former Bruin van Riemdsyk made it 3-0 with 31.5 seconds left in the first, slamming home the rebound of Zach Werenski's shot from the left circle just past an outstretched Swayman's skate.  The Bruins broke an 0-for-20 power-play drought at the 14:30 mark of the second. Coyle took Justin Brazeau's pass from behind the goal line and placed a perfect wrist shot over the glove of Merzlikins from the left circle. Danforth netted the visitors' second man-down tally of the night when Cole Sillinger made the setup off a turnover and a rush down the wing at 7:19 of the third. At 14:10, Monahan came out of the left corner and dished to Chinakhov for a quick release to round out the scoring. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Lakers have taken advantage of undermanned teams of late, with victories in the winning streak coming over the Philadelphia 76ers without Joel Embiid, the Memphis Grizzlies without Ja Morant and the New Orleans Pelicans sans CJ McCollum and Dejounte Murray on Saturday. In the 104-99 victory at New Orleans, the Lakers had their own personnel issues to overcome, with Cam Reddish (foot) and Rui Hachimura (ankle) both out. Rookie Dalton Knecht started and scored a career-best 27 points. Over his past three games, two of them starts, Knecht has averaged 20.0 points in 31.5 minutes per game. He was 5 of 10 from 3-point range against the Pelicans and has gone 12 of 19 (63.2 percent) in his three-game productive stretch. ""Every time (Knecht) shoots the ball, I think it's going in,"" said the Lakers' Anthony Davis, who had 31 points and 14 rebounds against his former team. ""That's why we get so frustrated and upset with him when he doesn't shoot. He's a great player. He can defend, he can shoot, he can put it on the floor, he can pass. So he can do it all."" Lakers veteran LeBron James shook off a slow start to score 21 points and deliver big baskets down the stretch. He is averaging 23.3 points, 9.2 assists and 8.6 rebounds in his 22nd season. The Jazz have been better of late, but are coming off a second consecutive loss as they dropped a 116-105 decision Sunday on the road against the Los Angeles Clippers. The Jazz trailed 99-76 with 11:06 remaining before they rallied to within 110-103 with 3:18 to play on a 3-pointer from Jordan Clarkson. The Clippers fashioned a quick 5-0 run and cruised to the victory from there. Clarkson finished with 21 points off the bench, while Lauri Markkanen had 18 points with 10 rebounds. Keyonte George scored just nine points on 4-of-12 shooting for Utah and was replaced in the starting lineup to open the second half by Isaiah Collier. ""Another night where we had a variety of lineups out there, but I think that the thing we're trying to emphasize every night is you have to compete if you want to play. That's nonnegotiable,"" Jazz head coach Will Hardy said. Markkanen believes the effort the Jazz put forth in the fourth quarter Sunday is something they can learn from and apply moving forward. ""We have that fight in us, and I think that's what we're trying to achieve,"" Markkanen said. ""We're looking for a full game of that desperation, playing hard (and) really have that competitive edge."" John Collins leads the Jazz with 17.5 points per game, while Markkanen is just behind at 17.3 points. Walker Kessler is the team's leading rebounder at 10.7 per game but will miss his fifth straight game Tuesday with a right hip injury.

The Pride won't have to wait nearly as long to get another chance against Florida State, which will look to avoid an upset on Tuesday night in Tallahassee, Fla. The Seminoles (3-1) have been off since Friday, when they fell 87-74 at home to then-No. 20 Florida. Jamir Watkins had 19 points on Friday to lead four scorers in double figures for Florida State, which allowed Florida to shoot 55.6 percent (15 of 27) from the field in the first half, including a 46.7 percent mark (7 of 15) from 3-point land. The Gators led by as many as 18 on their way to a 44-31 halftime edge. Florida State cooled off the visitors from distance in the second half, holding Florida to just 23.1 percent shooting (3 of 13) from 3-point range. The Seminoles closed within four points but ran out of gas over the game's final 2:22, missing their final four shots while the Gators hit three straight to end the comeback bid. ""We are making progress,"" Florida State coach Leonard Hamilton said. ""I thought we had better focus in the second half. We need to get more consistent stops, but I believe we can learn from this game."" Hofstra (4-0) has learned plenty about itself during an unbeaten start that includes narrow wins over Seton Hall on Wednesday (49-48) and UMass on Saturday (75-71 in overtime). Three players are averaging at least 15 points per game for Hofstra, which beat Seton Hall for the first time since the 1966-67 season. Jean Aranguren (20 points, 11 rebounds) posted a double-double in the Pride's first victory over Massachusetts since the 1971-72 campaign. ""We're a well-balanced team,"" said Hofstra coach Speedy Claxton, who played for the school from 1996-2000 before being selected in the first round of the NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers. ""It could be anybody's night."" Florida State leads the all-time series 3-1, though Hofstra won the most recent meeting between the schools on Nov. 20, 2015, when the Pride earned an 82-77 victory in the Paradise Jam in the U.S. Virgin Islands. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

A U.S. District judge denied 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports a court order on Nov. 8 that would have let the teams compete as chartered members without actually signing a charter. The teams argued that they would risk losing drivers, sponsorships and fans if they raced as open teams instead of chartered ones, but Judge Frank D. Whitney said those concerns were merely speculative. 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports now want the appellate court to quicken their review process and produce an oral argument before Dec. 14, as court would not be held again until Jan. 28, 2025. But attorney Gregory G. Garre does not think that should happen. Garre said on behalf of NASCAR that the teams' appeal is ""highly unfair"" and would significantly burden its client and judges. He also wrote that there is ""no urgency"" to honor the teams' ""extraordinary request to require NASCAR to file its opening brief within a mere 12 days, over a period that includes the Thanksgiving holiday, when many counsel for NASCAR are traveling to be with their families."" Garre further argued that judges would only have a week to review the teams' appeal along with any additional cases. Sports litigator Jeffrey Kessler, who represents 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports, announced Saturday that his clients will compete as open teams next season, which begins Feb. 2. They will not have to forgo their antitrust claims after NASCAR provided an open team agreement that does not involve a release of claims provision.

It took a six-game homestand for Pettersson to break out of his scoring slump. The slick Swede struggled in the first few weeks of the season, but now has four goals in his last five games. He scored a power-play goal at 9:51 of the second period to give Vancouver a 2-1 lead in a 5-3 loss to the Nashville Predators on Sunday. ""I got to put good games together in a row. I got to make it my identity,"" Pettersson said of the weekend. The Canucks have just three wins in 10 home games this season and they are hoping to end the current homestand on a positive note against New York. This will be the second game of a four-game road trip through the west for the Rangers. If he gets the starts on Tuesday, New York netminder Jonathan Quick will look to extend his marathon shutout streak. Quick, who is considered the backup to 28-year-old Igor Shesterkin, has won all four of his starts this season and recorded his second consecutive shutout in a 2-0 win over the Seattle Kraken on Sunday night. Quick has an active shutout streak of 128:05, dating back to a Nov. 7 relief appearance in a 6-1 loss to the Buffalo Sabres. ""That's a testament to the way these guys are playing in front of me here,"" Quick said after the Seattle game. ""We put ourselves in a great opportunity to defend well and win a game."" Quick, 38, last posted shutouts in consecutive starts more than 13 years ago. The last time it happened was the 2011-12 season when he recorded three in a row with the Los Angeles Kings. His 397 wins are the most all-time by U.S.-born goalies, and his 62 shutouts rank 18th on the all-time list. ""Obviously, you're honored to have those numbers,"" Quick said. ""At the end of the day as a goalie you're very dependent on your team in front of you. All those numbers really mean is I've played with some great players, teams that value winning more than anything."" New York improved to 6-1-0 on the road with the win over the Kraken. Alexis Lafreniere and Zac Jones scored for the Rangers, who won their second straight game and improved to 10-0-0 when scoring first this season.

When it did come time to defend, I thought we were in the right place."" Pettersson, Kiefer Sherwood and Aatu Raty scored goals as the host Canucks blew a second-period lead to Nashville. Canucks center J.T. Miller sat for most of the third period, getting just two shifts. He finished with 11:41 of ice time, his lowest game total in the past six seasons.

Sixty million viewers tuned into Netflix for the Paul-Tyson fight, with Downdetector.com, which tracks service outages, announcing that there were 90,000 issues reported at one point.  ""This unprecedented scale created many technical challenges, which the launch team tackled brilliantly by prioritizing stability of the stream for the majority of viewers,"" Netflix chief technology officer Elizabeth Stone wrote in a memo issued to the company following the bout, according to a reporter at Bloomberg. ""We don't want to dismiss the poor experience of some members, and know we have room for improvement, but still consider this event a huge success."" CBS Sports will be helping out on the production side of things on Christmas Day. However, it will be Netflix that is responsible for how the viewing experience turns out.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Ishmael Leggett contributed 14 points to pace a balanced attack as Pitt (5-0) won its 11th straight home game dating to last year, which is their longest home streak in 10 years. Guillermo Diaz Graham had 13 points and six rebounds while Cameron Corhen added 12 points and six boards for the Panthers. Corhen also played a big role on the defensive end, helping hold the top scorer from VMI, Augustinas Kiudulas, to six points. Kiudulas entered with a 21.8-point scoring average. The Keydets also were hampered by the loss of floor leader Tan Yildizoglu, who rolled his ankle midway through the first half and played only 11 minutes. Yildizoglu entered averaging 7.2 assists per game. Linus Holmstrom led VMI with 15 points. TJ Johnson added 12 points for the Keydets. Facing a power-conference team for the first time this year, VMI labored through a nervous start, missing its first seven shots as Pitt ran to a 10-0 lead with all of the points coming from Corhen and Leggett. Holmstrom finally broke the ice for the Keydets 5:35 into the game, draining a corner 3. Holmstrom also highlighted the Keydets' best stretch of the game, making a driving three-point play and a distance 3 to cap a 12-2 run which reduced a 13-point Pitt lead to 21-18 with 5:56 left in the first half. But the Keydets went cold again, missing their last nine field goal attempts of the half, paving the way for the Panthers to finish the period on an 18-2 spree. Leggett triggered the run with a 3-pointer and Damian Dunn, who finished with 11 points, added another 3 before Brandin Cummings closed the blitz with a fastbreak slam, which gave Pitt a 39-20 lead at the break. The Panthers' superior speed was evident throughout as they outscored the Keydets 27-0 in transition. They led VMI by as many as 47 points late in the second half. The game was part of the Greenbrier Tip-Off. As part of the tournament, which will conclude in White Sulphur Springs, W. Va., Pitt will face LSU on Friday and either Wisconsin or UCF on Sunday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Hill, a high-scoring transfer guard from Bowling Green, made 6 of 10 shots from the field. Brandon Huntley-Hatfield contributed 11 points as the Wolfpack (4-0) won their fourth straight home game. Nicolas Louis-Jacques scored nine points and Parker Jones and Brady Cummins each scored eight points for Colgate (1-3), which is winless in three road outings. The Raiders committed 16 turnovers. The teams had horrid perimeter shooting numbers, with Colgate at 5-for-26 (19.2 percent) and NC State at 3-for-14 (21.4 percent) on 3-point attempts. With two treys, Jones was the only player in the game with more than one long-range basket. The Wolfpack compiled a 21-2 advantage in points at the free-throw line, with Middlebrooks going 9-for-9. Despite missing 42 shots from the field, Colgate pulled in only nine offensive rebounds. Part of that was connected to Dontrez Styles' 11 rebounds for the Wolfpack. Colgate was saddled with too many scoring droughts in both halves. A 17-0 spurt gave the Wolfpack a 19-6 lead less than 8 1/2 minutes into the game. An 8-0 boost later in the half increased the margin to 17 points on a layup by Jayden Taylor. The Wolfpack led 40-22 at halftime. Colgate went four minutes without a point early in the second half as NC State's edge grew to 56-28. When Raiders reserve Chandler Baker scored on consecutive possessions on a personal five-point burst, it seemed like a breakthrough for the visitors. Five points, including a three-point play from Middlebrooks, in a 22-second span recaptured the momentum for the Wolfpack. The halftime numbers were concerning for Colgate, which battled Syracuse to the end on Nov. 12 in a two-point loss. The Raiders shot 34.5 percent from the field and didn't attempt a free throw in the first half. They made 10 shots from the field and committed 11 turnovers before the break. Overall, NC State shot 48.4 percent from the field to Colgate's 34.5 percent. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Thunder beat Phoenix on Friday to capture their initial NBA Cup game and share the top spot in West Group B with the Los Angeles Lakers. San Antonio lost its opening Cup game on Friday to the Lakers and remain without a victory in five Cup games since its inception in 2023. Oklahoma City hits the road after a 121-119 home loss to Dallas on Sunday that snapped a three-game winning streak. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander finished with 36 points on 13-of-19 shooting and led a late Thunder comeback by hitting a 3-pointer with 25 seconds left that brought OKC to within a possession. Gilgeous-Alexander then forced a jump ball, won possession and was fouled with less than five seconds to play. He made the first free throw and missed the second intentionally but the Thunder could not convert a 3-pointer at the buzzer. Oklahoma City was overwhelmed on the boards 53-29 and surrendered 18 of those on the defensive end. The Thunder were without injured forward Chet Holmgren for the fourth straight game. Holmgren is expected to be out until at least February with a hip injury. The Thunder's injuries in the pivot to Isaiah Hartenstein and Jaylin Williams as well as Holmgren have forced them into a ""small ball"" lineup. ""We've won games without centers,"" Gilgeous-Alexander said. ""Now it presents a different challenge, and you have to do certain things to win a basketball game that you might not necessarily have to do when you have a center."" Jalen Williams added 27 points for Oklahoma City while Luguentz Dort had 18 and Dillon Jones scored 12. ""We're not trying to survive,"" Jalen Williams said. ""We're going out there to win every game. Obviously, we want our bigs back and to be healthy, but we're not victims."" The Spurs head home after a quick trip to Dallas, where they fell to the Mavericks 110-93 while playing without forward Victor Wembanyama (knee contusion) and guard Devin Vassell (right foot injury management). Wembanyama is doubtful for Tuesday.  Those two players were sorely missed as San Antonio was outscored by 20 points in a lackluster third quarter and never recovered. Zach Collins finished with a season-high 20 points for the Spurs, with Sandro Mamukelashvili adding 14, Julian Champagnie scoring 13, Stephon Castle posting 12 and Chris Paul adding 11. San Antonio has dropped two straight games after winning a season-best two in a row. ""We've had some inconsistent good moments,"" Spurs interim coach Mitch Johnson said. ""The problem is the inconsistency of it. So think just continuing to try to put together a consistent 48 minutes and get healthy and kind of try to build on this stuff, hopefully we can catch a rhythm here."" The availability of Vassell, who would likely come off the bench, for Tuesday's game is yet to be determined. San Antonio's next three games (and four of its next five) are at home. For the Thunder, Tuesday's game is the first in a stretch of nine road games in their next 11. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Islanders arrive in Calgary on the heels of a disappointing 3-2 loss to the Seattle Kraken on Saturday, a game in which they blew a third-period lead and were ""robbed"" -- the word used by coach Patrick Roy -- when a questionable late game-winning goal was scored. The Islanders have posted one win, one loss and one overtime defeat on their road swing that finishes in Detroit after they face the Flames. ""We've done a pretty good job on this trip so far,"" forward Matt Martin said. ""Obviously we dropped a game we felt we could have won in Seattle, but we have to find a way to get two (points)."" The Islanders, who have surrendered third-period leads in two of their last three setbacks, should receive a boost. Defenseman Alexander Romanov is due to return from an upper-body injury that has cost him the past seven games. ""I should be good,"" Romanov said after Monday's practice in which he was paired with Noah Dobson. ""It's awesome to be part of the team again, not watching the games on TV or in the stands. It's great."" New York remains without forwards Mathew Barzal and Anthony Duclair and defensemen Adam Pelech and Mike Reilly. The team announced on Monday that during an exam for the concussion Reilly is battling, doctors found a heart condition that will take several months to fully heal. ""It's probably a blessing in disguise of what transpired,"" GM Lou Lamoriello said. ""They detected this, something that you're sometimes born with, but never knew."" The Flames continue a four-game homestand that began with goaltender Dustin Wolf collecting his first career NHL shutout in a 2-0 victory over the Nashville Predators on Friday. Wolf, who lost a shutout in the final three minutes in his previous outing, has surrendered seven goals in his last four games, in which the team has posted a 3-0-1 record. He will likely take the net for a team that has often rotated starts between Wolf and Dan Vladar. ""I feel good with my game. I feel confident,"" said Wolf, the rookie netminder who twice was named the AHL's top goaltender. ""I feel confident with the guys in front of me, as well. They make my life a heck of a lot easier, being able to see pucks and their sticks have been great on the seams."" The Flames were pegged to be a bottom feeder, but thanks in big part to their goaltenders, especially Wolf, they are hanging tough in the standings. ""He's way more comfortable than he was last year. You can really tell,"" defenseman Rasmus Andersson said of Wolf. ""The longer the season goes on, the more comfortable he gets. I get it, I was a young guy, too. The more you play, the more comfortable you get."" That said, the Flames must find a new gear, especially with their struggling power play, which has managed only two goals in the past 13 games, during which they have posted a 2-for-35 mark. ""I think we've just go to get the work boots on,"" Andersson said. ""It's too pretty at times. We have to move it quicker, get shots on net."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The results had been unfavorable until the Mavericks followed a blowout victory over San Antonio with a two-point win at Oklahoma City on Sunday. Dallas will try to notch a third straight win when it hosts the New Orleans Pelicans in an NBA Cup game Tuesday night. ""All these games mean something,"" guard Kyrie Irving said. ""We haven't put our best foot forward in certain games. We've had some really close wins and some heartbreaking games emotionally. We were able to grind it out for the last two games. It's a step in the right direction, but we're not satisfied."" Dallas' back-to-back wins were preceded by a four-game losing streak in which the losses came by one, two, three and two points. Things were easier in a 110-93 win over the Spurs, but the 121-119 victory against the Thunder went down to the buzzer. ""It shows the character in our locker room that you can have a tough week and respond with two games where you find a way to win,"" coach Jason Kidd said. The defending Western Conference champion Mavericks are just .500 through 14 games as they adjust to blending former Warriors All-Star guard Klay Thompson with Irving and star guard Luka Doncic. ""It's hard to win in this league,"" Kidd said. ""We're not guaranteed to get back to the Finals. There are a lot of teams in this league that are good."" Doncic (bruised right knee) didn't play against Oklahoma City. He is considered questionable to face the Pelicans. New Orleans is coming off a close game of its own. The Pelicans took a two-point lead against the visiting Lakers with 2:09 remaining Saturday night but scored just two more points and lost 104-99. New Orleans was outscored 29-15 in the third quarter after holding a 10-point halftime edge. ""We got stagnant as they turned up the heat,"" coach Willie Green said. ""They're a good team and they played with force. They made more shots and we just didn't get into our offense quickly and with the force like we were doing in the previous two quarters."" The Pelicans have a small margin for error because of the absence of several key players, including second-leading scorer Zion Williamson (22.7 points per game) and their top three ball-handling guards -- Dejounte Murray, CJ McCollum and Jose Alvarado. Amid the absences, young players such as guard Brandon Boston Jr., who's on a two-way contract, and rookie center Yves Missi have taken on bigger roles and contributed. Boston has averaged 15.1 points, 5.7 rebounds and 5.0 assists in starting the last seven games, while Missi has supplied 7.0 points and 7.6 boards having started the Pelicans' last nine contests. ""Each game is different,"" said Missi, the 21st pick in June's draft. ""You've got to come out with the same energy every day. It's different in college. You have way more games and you're playing against the best here. ""So, it's kind of been a moment of learning. I'm trying to absorb everything and put it on the court. Of course, I'm going to make some mistakes but I feel like it's about learning.""

The Terrapins may not face as many high-leverage moments against the Golden Griffins, who dropped to 0-5 after Sunday's 92-69 loss at Western Michigan. The Broncos shot 63.3 percent (38 of 60) overall and outscored Canisius 54-24 in the paint. Sunday's defensive performance frustrated Golden Griffins coach Jim Christian, particularly because he liked the looks his offense generated despite finishing 35.9 percent floor (23 of 64) from the floor. Christian said playing complementary basketball has been a key struggle amid the team's slow start. ""We keep fixing one area, one area improves and the other area drops off,"" he said. ""We haven't found any continuity to compete."" Guards Paul McMillan IV (22.4 points per game) and Tana Kopa (14.2 points per game) are Canisius' top two scorers and 3-point shooters. McMillan has hit 11 of 23 (47.8 percent) from distance, while Kopa has drilled 18 of 40 (45 percent). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Perhaps the most notable change involves a reduction in fully exempt players on tour in a given season. Beginning in 2026, players who finished in the top 100 of the prior year's FedEx Cup standings will keep full status, down from the top 125 this year. Players finishing Nos. 101-125 in the FedEx Cup standings would receive conditional status. Only 20 PGA Tour cards will be awarded to Korn Ferry Tour graduates rather than 30, among other minor changes to membership policies. ""It was important to redefine PGA Tour membership as we build on the aspirational nature of earning a PGA Tour card,"" PGA Tour Chief Competitions Officer Tyler Dennis said in a statement. ""Once on tour, members will have an equitable opportunity to retain their membership and qualify for the FedEx Cup Playoffs. For our fans, this added competitive drama will in turn create stronger fields and leaderboards throughout the season."" The fields at standard tournaments, currently at a maximum of 156 players, will be reduced to 144, with consideration for certain fields to be cut to 132 or 120 players based on daylight and pace of play. The Players Championship, the most prestigious non-major tournament in golf, will go from 144 players to 120. These changes also will not take effect until 2026. ""These field size adjustments, which also promote a better flow of play, improve the chances of rounds being completed each day with a greater ability to make the 36-hole cut on schedule under normal weather conditions,"" Dennis said. ""For our fans, this certainty sets up weekend storylines much more effectively and will make the PGA Tour easier and more enjoyable to follow."" The FedEx Cup points system will raise the point allocation for a second-place finish at a major -- reportedly by 100 points -- while decreasing the points for positions 11 and below. At signature events, there will be a slight decrease in points for finishing seventh and lower. The proposals were initially sent to players by the PGA Tour Player Advisory Council last month, and they are far from universally popular. Tour veteran Lucas Glover called the policy changes ""terrible"" in comments to Golfweek earlier Tuesday. ""Don't cut fields because it's a pace of play issue. Tell us to play faster, or just say you're trying to appease six guys and make them happy so they don't go somewhere else and play golf,"" said Glover, in a thinly veiled reference to the measures the PGA Tour continues to take to prevent more marquee players from bolting for LIV Golf. PGA Tour Policy Board player director Adam Scott explained his support for the changes in a statement. ""The PAC discussions were based on a number of guiding principles, including our belief that PGA Tour membership is the pinnacle of achievement in men's professional golf,"" the Australian said. ""The player representatives of the PGA Tour recognize the need to be continually improving its offerings to enhance the golf fan experience. The changes approved today will provide equitable playing opportunities for new young talent to be showcased, and positively refine the playing experience for our members."" ""Today's announced changes build on the competitive and schedule enhancements incorporated over the last six years in seeking the best version of the PGA Tour for our fans, players, tournaments and partners,"" commissioner Jay Monahan said in a statement. ""This was a true collaborative effort, and I'm extremely proud of the PAC for the time and effort they put into evaluating how we build a stronger PGA Tour."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

But do his players comprehend the physicality required? Malone will get another opportunity to impart that wisdom Tuesday when the visiting Nuggets play the Grizzlies for the second time in three days, this time in an NBA Cup game. Host Memphis beat Denver 105-90 on Sunday. ""You know, telling ain't teaching,"" Malone said. ""You know, we can tell our guys all day long, ‘This team is very physical. They're aggressive. They're going to attack you for 48 (minutes).' And the players will look at you and nod their head, and I have no idea what they're thinking about. ""And then, you go out there, and then you feel it for 48 minutes. And now, it's not me telling you, it's you experiencing how hard they play. And so now, we have a much better idea of what to expect come Tuesday night."" The Grizzlies used their physicality to pull away from the Nuggets on Sunday. Memphis led by 12 at the half and outrebounded Denver through two quarters. In the third quarter, the Grizzlies extended their lead to 22. Denver was without three-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic for the second consecutive game due to personal reasons, an absence that allowed Memphis to score 52 paint points and outrebound Denver 45-39. Still, the Nuggets were able to rally in the fourth quarter and trim the Memphis advantage to 11 with four minutes remaining. Early in the final period the Grizzlies led 94-70 -- the Nuggets' biggest deficit of the season. ""We were able to cut that 24-point (Memphis) lead to 11 when we became more aggressive, when we became more physical, and that allowed us to kind of get back in the game,"" Malone said. ""We need to not wait until the fourth quarter and a 24-point deficit to do that. That's got to be our M.O. from the beginning of the game."" Denver got a team-high 19 points from reserve Julian Strawther. Dario Saric had 10 points and 10 rebounds filling in for Jokic, whose status for Tuesday is uncertain. The Grizzlies have been without star guard Ja Morant since Nov. 6, when he fell hard to floor against the Los Angeles Lakers and suffered a right hip injury. Rookie big man Zach Edey, Memphis' first-round pick in this year's draft, may not be available either, due to a left ankle injury he suffered in Sunday's game. The injury situation, which also included starter Marcus Smart sidelined by illness Sunday, has forced Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins to use his team's depth to remain above .500. The Grizzlies have won four of their past six. ""We kind of had a rash of injuries and didn't have the number of available bodies and guys we have confidence in, so it's definitely something we're very mindful of,"" Jenkins said.  ""We're trying to figure out our chemistry as guys are coming back to the rotations. Does our starting lineup change at some point? Bringing back (Desmond Bane), that always factors into the chemistry equation, so we definitely want to know, as I always say, what our standard is. It doesn't matter who's on the floor. We know what we're capable of. "" Bane returned to the floor Friday at Golden State as a reserve after missing seven games with a strained right oblique. He started Sunday against Denver and produced his fifth career double-double with 11 points and 11 rebounds. He also had seven assists. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Skenes received 23 of 30 first-place votes for 136 points in balloting conducted by the Baseball Writers' Association of American. San Diego Padres outfielder Jackson Merrill was second with seven first-place votes and 104 points. Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Jackson Chourio (26) was third and Chicago Cubs left-hander Shota Imanaga (four) was fourth. In the American League, New York Yankees right-hander Luis Gil was the winner, edging Baltimore Orioles outfielder Colton Cowser. Gil received 15 first-place votes and 10 seconds for 106 points, while Cowser (101) got 13 firsts and 11 seconds. Skenes' strong campaign opened eyes as he quickly handled major league hitters after being the No. 1 overall pick in 2023 out of LSU. He spent his first two college seasons at Air Force. ""I've surrounded myself with good people,"" Skenes told MLB Network of his success. ""I've been super lucky to experience all the things that I have. I try to continue to stay present and enjoy the ride."" Skenes is the first starting pitcher to win the NL award since Jacob deGrom of the New York Mets in 2014. He is the first Pirate to win the honor since outfielder Jason Bay in 2004. Skenes is the fifth No. 1 overall pick to win Rookie of the Year. Carlos Correa of the Houston Astros was the most recent in 2015. The others are Bryce Harper (2012 with Nationals), Darryl Strawberry (1983, Mets) and Bob Horner (1978, Braves). Skenes, who turned 22 in May, went 11-3 with a 1.96 ERA and 0.95 WHIP with 170 strikeouts in 133 innings. He is also one of three finalists for the NL Cy Young Award. Skenes was the starting pitcher for the NL in the All-Star Game. He allowed just 94 hits in 23 starts. ""The coolest part is we can put a bow on this past year and we can kind of look forward to next year,"" he said. Merrill, who turned 21 in April, batted .292 with 24 homers and 90 RBIs and was a member of the NL All-Star team. Merrill was a shortstop by trade with the Padres moving him to center field during spring training. He proved to be a big-time clutch player, hitting six tying or game-winning homers in the eighth inning or later. Chourio is the youngest player in major league history to record a 20-homer, 20-steal, reaching the mark at 20 years, 185 days. Vada Pinson (1959 for the Reds) and Mike Trout (2012 of the Angels) also did it in their ""age-20 seasons,"" but both turned 21 before reaching the milestone. Chourio batted .275 with 21 homers and 22 steals in 148 games. This was the first time since 1981 that starting pitchers won the award in both leagues. On that occasion, it was a pair left-handers -- Fernando Valenzuela of the Dodgers and Dave Righetti of the Yankees. Gil, who turned 26 in June, went 15-7 with a 3.50 ERA in 29 starts for the Yankees. ""It means so much to me,"" Gil said through an interpreter. ""It's incredible. I'm so happy and excited about this."" He is the 10th Yankee to win the award and the first since outfielder Aaron Judge in 2017. Among the other winners are catcher Thurman Munson in 1970 and shortstop Derek Jeter in 1996. ""When you come up as a rookie player, first of all your dream is to make it to the big leagues,"" Gil said. ""But once you get there, you want to contribute, you want to do your job, you want to help the team. To be in the same line as those guys, those guys are legends."" Gil struck out 171 in 151 2/3 innings and compiled a 1.19 WHIP. Cowser, 24, batted .242 with 24 homers, 24 doubles and 69 RBIs in 153 games.  He had struggled during a cameo in 2023 by batting .l15 in 61 at-bats over 26 games. Yankees catcher Austin Wells (17) was third in AL balloting, just ahead of Oakland Athletics right-hander Mason Miller (16). Cleveland Guardians right-hander Cade Smith (12) was fifth. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After paying a $100,000 fine and apologizing for an anti-gay slur uttered during a postgame on-court interview, Ball will attempt to turn his focus back to the court Tuesday night when the Charlotte Hornets visit the Brooklyn Nets for each team's second game in Group A of the NBA Cup. Following two injury-plagued seasons in which he only played 58 games, Ball is averaging a career-best 29.7 points per game and has scored at least 30 points in eight of his 13 games. Ball had seven 30-point games in 22 contests last season, and his next 30-point showing would match the mark he set during his 2021-22 All-Star season when he averaged 20.1 points in 75 games. ""As he goes, we go,"" Charlotte coach Charles Lee said. ""He's trying to do it on both ends of the court, even undermanned. Not making any excuses and just trying to find a way to impact winning. It takes a great work ethic and it takes fearlessness. And that's who he is. He's a fearless competitor and I'm so glad he's on our team."" The Hornets are 2-6 when Ball scores at least 30, though two of those losses are to the reigning NBA champion Boston Celtics and another was Sunday's 128-114 loss to the unbeaten Cleveland Cavaliers. Ball scored 31 on 11-of-29 shooting from the floor, then apologized for using derogatory language following Saturday's 115-114 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. ""Before we get started, I just want to address the comment (Saturday),"" Ball told reporters. ""I really didn't mean anything (by it) and don't want to offend anybody. I've got love for everybody, and I don't discriminate."" The Hornets are hoping to deliver a stronger performance in the NBA Cup after Ball scored 35 in a 114-89 loss at Orlando last week. The tournament loss is part of Charlotte's five-game road losing streak that continued Sunday at Cleveland. The Nets are also 0-1 in the NBA Cup after nearly storming back in the fourth quarter from a 21-point deficit in a 124-122 loss at the New York Knicks on Friday.  Brooklyn took its third straight loss and fell to 1-5 in its past six games when it was outscored 50-24 in the paint in a 114-104 road loss to the Knicks on Sunday. Brooklyn is coming off one of its least productive games, as it shot 42.1 percent from the floor -- its second-lowest mark of the season. Cam Thomas was held to 16 points Sunday after scoring 43 Friday on 16-of-22 shooting from the floor, including 7 of 10 3-pointers. Brooklyn played its second game without Nic Claxton (back), who is scheduled to be re-evaluated at the end of this week. Without Claxton, the Nets allowed 96 points in the paint against the Knicks in the two games. ""Yeah, obviously (Claxton's absence) was a part of it,"" Ben Simmons said. ""Definitely a problem.

The visiting Panthers aim to complete a home-and-home sweep of the Jets, who'll try to avoid a third consecutive loss Tuesday night. Winnipeg opened the season with an NHL-best 15 wins in 16 games, including a 7-0-0 start on the road. Then, the Jets fell 4-1 at Tampa Bay on Thursday and were severely roughed up in Saturday's 5-0 loss at Florida. This mini-slide is the first true test of Winnipeg's mettle amid a dream opening to the season -- especially since its offense has hit a rut after totaling 73 goals in the first 16 games. The Jets are coming off their first shutout loss of the season. ""I think we got away from certain aspects (Saturday) that make us good,"" Jets defenseman Dylan DeMelo told NHL.com. ""Nothing that we were surprised about, but I think things that we'll definitely be aware for next time. A good blueprint for us to see what we can expect on Tuesday."" The Jets have outscored opponents 37-19 while going 8-1-0 at home, where they've won four straight and allowed just one goal in the last three contests. ""We need to bring it,"" DeMelo said. ""Now it's our turn, in our building. So, I think we're excited to get home and play them again."" The reigning Stanley Cup champion Panthers momentarily rebounded themselves Saturday, after allowing 10 combined goals in losing back-to-back home games to New Jersey. Aleksander Barkov had a goal with two assists, Sam Reinhart recorded three assists and Sergei Bobrovsky made 27 saves for his 45th career shutout as the Panthers snapped an 0-3-1 skid against the Jets. ""This was not about Winnipeg for us,"" said Florida coach Paul Maurice, who coached the Jets for parts of nine seasons from 2013-21. ""It was about our past two games and righting the ship. ""We needed that kind of a foundation game to get back to the basics of what we're good at."" Florida heads to Winnipeg trying to build on that needed victory and to extend its road winning streak to six games. While Barkov has 17 points in the 10 games he's played this season, Reinhart has recorded 16 of his team-leading 28 during a 10-game point streak. Bobrovsky is 4-1-0 with a 2.41 goals-against average on the road this season. Florida backup goaltender Spencer Knight has allowed at least three goals in his three road starts of 2024-25. Winnipeg's Connor Hellebuyck matched a season high with those five goals allowed Saturday. But the two-time Vezina Trophy winner has stopped 114 of 119 shots faced during his current four-game home winning streak. Kyle Connor leads the Jets with 22 points, but he's been shut out in five of the last six games -- including two straight and each of the last three at home. Connor, though, has seven goals and 13 points in 12 career games versus Florida. The Panthers' Evan Rodrigues, who scored his fifth goal Saturday, has four with eight assists in 11 games against Winnipeg. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

He traveled with the Blues on their 1-1-1 road swing through Buffalo, Boston and Carolina and continued skating. Without him and a trio of injured defensemen, the Blues have been trying to stave off a collapse. That quest will continue when the Blues host the Minnesota Wild on Tuesday night. St. Louis suffered a 4-3 overtime loss to the Sabres last Thursday, then defeated the Bruins 3-2 in overtime Saturday before finishing the trip with a 4-1 loss to the Hurricanes on Sunday. The Blues outshot Carolina 30-24 and controlled much of the play despite missing Thomas and defensemen Philip Broberg, Nick Leddy and Pierre-Olivier Joseph, who are all on the injured list. ""I thought we outplayed them,"" Blues winger Jack Neighbours said. ""I thought we deserved better, whether it was to get it to overtime or just be in the game at the end. I think the difference, at the end of the day, is they scored on their chances and we didn't."" The Blues also committed some untimely turnovers that handed the Hurricanes good scoring chances. ""I think it's just a couple little errors that we need to fix, but overall, I didn't hate our effort,"" Blues forward Dylan Holloway said. ""I thought a back-to-back, it didn't feel like a 4-1 game to me. Sometimes, your effort doesn't show, I guess, in the score."" The Wild are also 1-1-1 in their last three games. They cooled somewhat after winning nine of their previous 11, due somewhat to key forwards Joel Eriksson Ek and Mats Zuccarello plus defenseman Jonas Brodin missing time due to injuries. Minnesota adapted to their absences by playing a sound defensive game Saturday against the Dallas Stars, but the Wild fell 2-1. ""You got to put your work boots on and go,"" forward Marcus Foligno said. ""So we kept it close, and we had a fighting chance at the end. And you never want to be satisfied with losing. But there's some things in this game where, as a team, we didn't open up with a track meet or anything like that where we got uncharacteristic and didn't listen to the coach, didn't listen to our systems."" Wild coach John Hynes believes his team's strong third period against Dallas will be something to build on. ""You come out in the third period, you're not turning pucks over,"" Hynes said. ""You don't get away from it. You put them under duress. ... I look at the style of game, the mindset, the discipline, things like that. You're going to win more of those opportunities. ""I like where we're headed, for sure."" The Wild expect to get Eriksson Ek (lower-body injury) and Brodin (upper body) back in the lineup to face the Blues. Both players practiced Monday. The Blues are likely to come back with Jordan Binnington in goal after playing Joel Hofer in Sunday's loss. The Wild are expected to start Filip Gustavsson in goal in St. Louis and then play Marc-Andre Fleury in one of their two upcoming games against Edmonton and Calgary. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

On Tuesday night, the Penguins will play the second of a five-game homestand when it hosts the Tampa Bay Lightning in the first meeting between the Eastern Conference clubs. Sitting in seventh place ahead of only the Columbus Blue Jackets in the Metropolitan Division, the Penguins are clamoring for victories and have only 17 points despite playing the second-most games (20) of any team in the conference. Saturday's matchup with San Jose turned out to be a microcosm of Pittsburgh's failures this season: an early effort to build multi-goal leads but a remarkable inability to hold them. Pittsburgh went ahead 3-0 on captain Sidney Crosby's 599th career goal, but the Sharks stormed back and forced overtime. Evgeni Malkin finally put his team ahead in the shootout's fifth round before goaltender Alex Nedeljkovic stopped Alex Wennberg in the bottom of the frame for a 4-3 win to move its November mark to 3-3-2. ""We've been playing pretty good as of late, maybe haven't gotten the results or bounces, tough calls here or there,"" said Nedeljkovic, who made 26 saves for his third win. ""We stuck with it. I think that's been a big point of emphasis lately. Just staying with it."" Crosby, 37, is on the cusp of becoming the 21st player to reach 600 goals and only the second active one (Alex Ovechkin, 866). Defenseman Kris Letang (illness) has missed the past two games and was absent from Monday's morning practice. After an 0-3-1 winless skid that saw them lose one of their top point producers, the Lightning seem to have rediscovered better play, surprisingly, against two of the NHL's best clubs during a three-game homestand. Following a 2-1 shootout defeat against the Philadelphia Flyers in the opener, Tampa Bay crafted two of its best performances thus far -- 4-1 over the NHL-best Winnipeg Jets and 4-0 against the hot New Jersey Devils behind Andrei Vasilevskiy's 36th career shutout. Coach Jon Cooper had been urging his group to shoot the puck, saying it was not taking enough shooting chances and trying to find the perfect pass for easier goals. ""I think the big issue with us, especially of late, is we're overcomplicating an uncomplicated game,"" Cooper said during the homestand. ""I think we're a bottom-five team in the league for shots on goal. It's been the extra pass, the extra play, there's something better out there. It has kind of sucked the life out of us and what does it do? It fuels the other team."" The organization returned forward Gage Goncalves to AHL affiliate Syracuse on Sunday, fueling speculation -- again -- that injured top-line center Brayden Point (lower body) is nearing a return just as the team is coming around. The 28-year-old Point, who has eight goals and five assists in 12 games, has missed the past four games but participated Saturday morning in the team's optional skate. Nikita Kucherov handed out two assists against New Jersey, leaving him one point shy of 900. The right wing has 331 goals and 568 assists in 741 games. Only two players in Tampa Bay franchise history have reached that milestone -- Steven Stamkos (1,137 points) and Martin St. Louis (953). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Purple Aces (1-3) learned a rough lesson Saturday at home when they built a 22-point lead in the first half, led by 18 at halftime but lost 92-81 to Radford. ""This one stings. Being up as much as we were at home, you have to win these types of games,"" Ragland said. ""We need to play a full 40 minutes and have not done that to this point. We need to look in the mirror and get better individually and as a team."" A positive was that the Purple Aces tied the program record with 17 3-pointers on 35 attempts. Cameron Haffner made 6 of 10 for a career-high 23 points. Evansville's willingness to fire from long distance could be a welcome change for the Buckeyes after the physical battle with Texas A&M. Forty-five fouls were called and the Aggies were 32-of-40 from the free-throw line while the Ohio State made 16 of 22. ""We've got guys who fight,"" Ohio State coach Jake Diebler told the Columbus Dispatch ""There wasn't a second in the game where I felt like we weren't fighting and playing hard and playing tough. We've just got to play more poised. We've got to execute a little bit better."" Ohio State (2-1) was seeking a second win over a Top 25 opponent after downing then-No. 19 Texas 80-72 in Las Vegas in the season opener. The Buckeyes defeated Youngstown State 81-47 in their home opener on Nov. 11. Their downfall against Texas A&M was an inability to convert from beyond the arc. After making 24 of 50 (48 percent) 3-pointers combined in the first two games, they sank just 8 of 30 (26.7 percent), three by freshman John Mobley Jr. off the bench. ""We didn't play well enough for big enough stretches to win the game,"" Diebler said. ""But we did some really good things, particularly in the second half, that will prepare us to be better the next time we're out there and next time we're on the road. We showed we can do some really good things next time we have this opportunity."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Purdue (4-0), which upset then-No. 2 Alabama 87-78 at home on Friday, will be on the road for the first time in the regular season. Marquette (4-0) held off previously unbeaten Maryland 78-74 on the Terrapins' home court on Friday behind Kam Jones' 28 points. ""The thing that'll happen, our next game's on the road and it's going to be difficult,"" Purdue coach Matt Painter said following the win over Alabama. ""It's just different on the road. ""To be able to play somebody like Marquette on their home court, now you see where you are. Whether you win by 20, lose by 20, it's a close game, you're going to learn some things about your team and you're going to get better from it."" Purdue, 4-0 for the fourth consecutive season, has won 39 straight regular-season nonconference games, tied for the fourth longest streak in NCAA history. Despite the graduation of All-American center Zach Edey and 7-foot-4 starting freshman center Daniel Jacobsen's season-ending broken leg in the second game of the season, the Boilermakers found success inside against the Crimson Tide. Trey Kaufman-Renn posted a career-high 26 points and collected eight rebounds while Purdue committed just three turnovers. Kaufman-Renn averages a team-best 18.0 points per game, with Fletcher Loyer at 17.0 and Braden Smith 15.5. Kaufman-Renn and Smith each average 6.3 rebounds, while Smith is the Boilermakers' top assist man (9.5). Purdue has learned from a 93-87 preseason loss at No. 14 Creighton in an exhibition charity game, Painter said. ""When we lost to Creighton, I just said, like, in three weeks we play Alabama,"" he said. ""We've got to be able to improve in those three weeks to give ourselves a chance. It doesn't guarantee you're going to win, but you've got to give yourself a chance."" Against Maryland, Marquette led by eight with just over a minute left, but the Terps closed within two before missing a pair of crucial free throws in the closing seconds. ""Our guys did a good job down the stretch of being surgical on offense, getting what we wanted and then getting some critical stops,"" Marquette coach Shaka Smart said afterward. ""This is a program-building win for us."" With Marquette trailing 59-56, Jones scored the team's next 12 points to put the visitors ahead for good. Jones was 12-of-18 shooting from the field, including 3-of-5 attempts beyond the 3-point line. Stevie Mitchell added 18 points and freshman Royce Parham came off the bench for a career-high 10. Marquette averages 83.0 points per game while allowing 65.3 but has been outrebounded by 1.5 per contest. Jones leads in scoring at 24.0 per game, followed by David Joplin and Chase Ross at 13.3 apiece. Joplin averages a team-high 7.0 boards with Ross grabbing 6.0. Purdue has won three of the last four meetings, including a 78-75 victory last season in the Maui Invitational final.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Todd Golden has guided the Gators (4-0) to an unscathed record so far despite dealing with an ongoing school inquiry into alleged sexual harassment and stalking allegations that surfaced recently. Golden addressed the matter in recent days and said he is considering filing a defamation lawsuit. ""What's personally getting me through this right now?"" Golden told reporters recently. ""Respecting the situation, my family, my team, my coaching staff. We're just continuing to attack it like we normally would every day."" Meanwhile, on the court, Golden is focusing on Florida's strong start, which continued last Friday with an 87-74 road victory over rival Florida State. The Gators prevailed thanks to a solid effort from Walter Clayton Jr., who finished with 25 points on 8-of-15 shooting, five rebounds and three assists. Clayton was one of three Florida players scoring in double figures and one of nine who got on the scoresheet. Alijah Martin had 17 points and Sam Alexis continued to play well off the bench with 12 points. The Gators also rebounded well against a tough Florida State frontcourt, finishing with a 47-29 edge overall, including 34-15 in defensive boards. ""That was the offset for us, right? We lost the turnover battle by 11 (19-8), but we won the boards by 18,"" Golden said after the game. ""And, you know, sometimes it's as simple as that. ... We shot 52 percent from the field (32 of 61), but they won the shot battle. They got nine more attempts (70) than we did, and four more free throws than we did (21-17). That's usually a losing proposition, but the glass is what saved us."" The Gators will try to iron out some of those deficiencies against Florida A&M (0-3), which has struggled to stay competitive in three lopsided losses so far against power-conference teams. Tyler Shirley and Sterling Young have been a couple of the bright spots for the Rattlers during this tough opening stretch. Shirley led FAMU with 10 points and seven rebounds against Maryland in its most recent defeat on Nov. 11. Florida A&M continued to struggle with opponents getting off to fast starts, as Maryland scored the game's first 15 points and never trailed. The Rattlers also found themselves down 33-9 in the first half of their loss to TCU and 40-19 before halftime against SMU. The Rattlers have shown moments of offensive efficiency, including shooting 39.2 percent from the field against the Terrapins. But FAMU struggled from 3-point range (28.6 percent) and made only 7 of 17 free throws. Turnovers have been a huge problem so far in turning potentially competitive games into blowout losses quickly. Florida A&M committed 12 turnovers in its opener against TCU and it became progressively worse, as it then lost 15 turnovers against SMU and 22 against Maryland. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Northern Kentucky (0-3) is in search of its first win after losing 61-59 to Nicholls one night earlier on its home court. Simas Lukosius and Jizzle James each scored 19 points to lead the Bearcats. James had four of Cincinnati's 18 assists and played tight defense in 28 minutes to offset his four turnovers. ""I see where I wasn't in my groove in the first half,"" James said. ""Going to halftime talking with my coaches, I had to learn from it, then come out and see the game and see where I can split the defense, and it just opened up opportunities all game. I think I played better in the second half. I can say that. So (I'm) trying to get that to where I do it all game and just make it consistent."" Lukosius is off to a blazing start from beyond the arc, converting 5 of 7 3-pointers Friday night and improving to 10-of-14 for the season. As a team, Cincinnati drained 11 of 27 shots from long distance in the runaway win. ""He hasn't been forcing them, and I think he's taking the right shots,"" Cincinnati coach Wes Miller said of Lukosius. ""I believe you have to give credit to the other guys, as well, because the ball is popping around. You look down ... and we have 18 assists. The ball is moving around, and there are a lot of other good players on the floor as well. Simas is not going to shoot 80 percent this year, because nobody's ever done that. I want him to do that but that won't happen. He is going to have a great year, because he's a really good player, and he continues to improve."" Cincinnati shot 33-of-61 (54.1 percent) from the field while holding Nicholls to just 21-of-69 (30.4 percent) from the floor. Texas transfer Dillon Mitchell continues to make an impact for his new team in Cincinnati, scoring 12 points in 24 minutes while grabbing nine rebounds. The Norse of Northern Kentucky rallied from a 19-point first-half deficit on Thursday night to take a five-point lead with 2:41 remaining on a dunk by Keeyan Itejere. But the Norse were outscored 8-1 to end the game, including a layup at the buzzer that kept them winless on the season. Trey Robinson led NKU in scoring with 19, thanks to a huge second half. Robinson took over early in the final 20 minutes, scoring nine in a row at one point as part of his 15 in the second half. Robinson also had seven rebounds, four assists, three blocked shots and a steal. Sam Vinson had a team-leading seven assists, eight rebounds and three steals to lead NKU, which was outrebounded 57-33 in the loss to Nicholls. The series between Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky has been dubbed the ""River Rumble"" as the two schools are separated by just five miles across the Ohio River. Two years ago, Northern Kentucky pulled off a stunning upset when they beat the heavily-favored Bearcats at home, 64-51. Vinson scored 15 points and had three assists in 28 minutes that night while Robinson scored five points and dished out three assists in 20 minutes. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Detroit Lions surpassed the Chiefs to become the betting favorites to win the Super Bowl at several sportsbooks -- for the first time in the woebegone franchise's history. The Chiefs were the unchallenged favorites to win Super Bowl LIX ever since notching their second straight championship last February. They remained atop odds boards despite several shaky performances and near-losses throughout their first nine games. Before the Chiefs lost 30-21 to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday, the Lions steamrolled the Jacksonville Jaguars 52-6, scoring touchdowns on their first seven drives and never punting. Jared Goff had 412 passing yards and four touchdowns in the Lions' eighth straight victory. That combination of events put Detroit, a franchise that had not won a playoff game between 1991 and 2023, over the top. ""For the first time in the history of the franchise, the Lions are now the favorites (+400) to win the Super Bowl,"" Fanatics Sportsbook posted on social media Monday. At BetMGM, the Lions are a mere +325 to win the Super Bowl, with the Chiefs at +450. They're the +350 favorites at both Fanduel Sportsbook and DraftKings, with Kansas City running second (+500 at Fanduel, +450 at DraftKings).

Kentucky (3-0) is coming off Tuesday's 77-72 win over then-sixth-ranked Duke, their first signature win of the Mark Pope era. Andrew Carr led the way for Kentucky with a season-high 17 points on 5-of-8 shooting from the floor. Otega Oweh added 15 points, which included some late-game heroics as Oweh sealed the outcome with a timely steal and free throws. Oweh isn't shying away from his moment with college basketball's winningest blue blood. The 6-foot-4 junior guard transferred to Kentucky after spending the previous two seasons at Oklahoma. ""I'll just say, wearing Kentucky on your chest, you just have to carry yourself a certain way,"" he said. ""You know that you're not just playing for yourself, you're playing for a whole nation, you're playing for your brothers. ""It's a dream to play for Kentucky,"" Oweh continued, ""and the fact that I'm here, and the fact that (Carr) is here, it just makes everyone want to play harder."" Lipscomb enters at 2-3, with wins over Duquesne and Wofford. The Bisons lost their most recent outing on Sunday to Western Kentucky, falling 66-61 on the road after being outscored by six in the second half. ""We'll be better for going through this stretch that we're in,"" Lipscomb coach Lennie Acuff said. ""Then we go to Rupp Arena on Tuesday night, and you don't have to say a lot about that game, you just know that you're going to play against Kentucky, who just beat Duke. ""I feel like we're going to be better for what's been behind us, and we're looking forward to what's ahead. We're going to live through the windshield."" The Bisons faced former Kentucky coach John Calipari and Arkansas on Nov. 6, falling 76-60. Lipscomb's other loss came in an 80-79 heartbreaker to Belmont on Nov. 12, as they led by 12 points with 3:56 remaining and blew an eight-point lead in the final 2:08. Belmont closed the game on a 19-6 run. Oweh and Koby Brea are each averaging 15.3 points per game to lead Kentucky in scoring. Brea scored 18 points in Kentucky's season-opening win over Wright State and 20 points in its second game against Bucknell. Brea is shooting 70.8 percent from the field on the season, sixth among all Division I guards. Oweh has reached double figures in all three games, including a team-high 21 points in the opener. Amari Williams is averaging an identical double-double at 11.7 points and 11.7 rebounds per game. Williams grabbed a season-high 14 rebounds in the win over Bucknell. Lipscomb is led by Jacob Ognacevic, who made All-ASUN first team in 2022-23 before missing all of last season due to injury.

""You can't win at Indiana University.""    ""The Hoosiers can't be highly ranked in the college football polls.""    ""IU can't have a spot in the College Football Playoffs.""    ""IU-Ohio State is the biggest game the Hoosiers have played since 1967... maybe ever.""    The Hoosiers' head coach isn't listening. In fact, he's not all that interested in what you think.    It isn't that he doesn't hear the outside noise. It would be difficult not to, what with ESPN's College GameDay and Fox Sports' Big Noon Kickoff consistently buzzing around. Unparalleled success comes with national attention, and the Hoosiers are among the biggest stories of the 2024 college football season.    After nearly 140 years of frustration, the program that has lost more games in its history than any other finds itself in the white-hot spotlight vs. the No. 2-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes in Columbus with a chance to silence all of its critics. Big Ten title hopes lie in the balance.    A big game? Cignetti isn't having it.    ""It's a big game because it's the next game,"" Cignetti says. ""We treat them all alike. If there were a better way to prepare for a certain team, we'd do that for every team.""   It's coach-speak, but it's also clear that Cignetti truly believes it.  His success not just at IU but at previous stops at James Madison and Elon has convinced him that his way of preparing for opponents and instilling belief in his players is the right way.    ""It's pretty simple,"" Cignetti famously said after being hired at IU. ""I win. Google me.""    Belief has been the bedrock of the Hoosiers' historic season, from the belief the coaches have in one another to the belief the players have in their coaches and each other. Belief isn't difficult to come by when the head man has delivered on everything he promised since Day One.    And the IU administration is buying into the belief, too. With multiple sellouts of Memorial Stadium this year and the promise of a lot more in the future, IU Athletics Director Scott Dolson made sure nobody was going to poach his head coach by using the bye week to sign Cignetti to an eight-year contract extension worth upwards of $72 million.    Even when his team wasn't playing, Cignetti managed to win the weekend.    It's the best of times for IU football, and it will never be better.  There were no expectations on the Hoosiers coming into this season, and nobody in their wildest dreams believed IU would be undefeated and ranked in the top five in the country come the final weeks of the regular season. For a program that consistently searches for just six wins in a season to reach an elusive bowl, one that won a total of nine games in the last three years, every game at this point is playing with house money.  Nobody can be disappointed with anything that happens from here on out because nobody expected to be here.    Consider IU never won more than nine games in a season until this season. The Hoosiers could lose every game the rest of the year and it would be the most successful season in their history.    In the future, there will be expectations.  IU fans have felt the warmth of success, and they'll crave it with every fiber of their being. Disappointment and heartache are always a possibility. It has happened before.    But that's in the future. Cignetti has completely changed the narrative for IU football, which is now playing big-boy football for the first time in its history.    There is the contract extension and the dream of renovations at 65-year-old Memorial Stadium. You need more room for more fans. Cignetti has allowed long-suffering Hoosier fans to dream of becoming a football power, and he's certain this year isn't a fluke. It's just the beginning.    And you better believe it.  --Ken Bikoff, Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Tucker missed two field goals Sunday in Baltimore's 18-16 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, a defeat that pushes the Steelers into full control of the AFC North.  Tucker made a 54-yard field goal after missing from 47 and 50 yards to fall from the top of the all-time NFL accuracy rankings.  ""The best option right now is to get Justin back on point because he is fully capable of doing it,"" Harbaugh said. ""We certainly haven't lost any confidence in Justin Tucker."" Carolina Panthers kicker Eddy Pineiro moved ahead of Tucker by percentage points. Pineiro is the NFL's most accurate kicker ever at 89.4 percent (101 of 113) with Tucker standing at 89.3 entering Week 12. In 460 career tries, Tucker has made 411 field goals in 460 attempts. The six total missed FGs this season (in 22 attempts) exceed his total number of misses last season (five in 37 attempts). He already has tied for the second-most misses in a season during his 13-year career. ""He's definitely our best option and he's going to make a lot of kicks,"" Harbaugh said. ""I really believe that going forward. But it's up to him and the guys he works with every day, to make those balls go straight. He's going to get it figured out. We have coaches. We have technique, we look at the tape, he's practicing well. He's got to kick it straight."" It was only the sixth time in his career that Tucker missed two field goals in the same game. He has five missed field goals in the Ravens' four losses. Tucker's field-goal percentage of 72.7 has never been lower through 11 games into the regular season. Harbaugh said there is no point or purpose in trying to find competition to push Tucker this week or going forward.  ""You'd have to find that competition first if you're going to be blunt about it,"" the coach said. ""Where is that competition?""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Jefferson is not far behind with 8.0 points per game on 53.8 percent shooting. No matter who starts against IU Indianapolis, the Cyclones will look to put together another group effort. ""Obviously, everyone likes to be starting, but we have so many guys on this team that if Curt starts for me one night, or whoever starts, it doesn't really matter,"" Momcilovic said. ""We all play the same role. We're all going to get the same minutes, similar minutes, so it doesn't really matter who's out there."" Jones agreed that since everyone is logging playing time, it made little difference to him. ""It's pretty much the same,"" Jones said. ""I've got the same role whether I start or come off the bench and whoever else does too. It's not really a problem. It's just about the productivity you put out there on the court."" IU Indianapolis aims to bounce back from a 74-71 loss against Eastern Michigan on Thursday. The Jaguars have wins over NAIA teams IU Columbus and Goshen, and they've also lost to Xavier.

Three others are averaging in double digits: Jarvis Walker (14.8 points per game), Sean Craig (10.5) and Nathan Dudukovich (10.0).

Wisconsin (4-0) upended the Wildcats 103-88 on Friday behind a career-high 41 points from graduate transfer John Tonje. UTRGV (3-2) won the River Division title at the Greenbrier Tip-off over the weekend, opening with an 86-76 win over Charleston Southern, followed with an 83-58 rout of Tennessee Tech on Saturday. Wisconsin, which led Arizona by 18 late in the first half, saw the Wildcats come back to the score at 65 with 14 minutes left before pulling away. ""I think I was most proud of the response when it was 65-all,"" Wisconsin coach Greg Gard said afterward. ""That showed me the guts and toughness that is starting to develop with this group."" Tonje, a 6-5 guard who was limited to eight games at Missouri last season due to injuries, hit 8 of 14 shots, including 4 of 6 beyond the arc, and 21 of 22 free-throw attempts. Tonje's previous career high was 31 points while playing for Colorado State against Oral Roberts in 2021. Tonje is averaging a team-best 23.5 points per game, shooting 55.8 percent (24-43), along with 37 of 39 from the free-throw line. Max Klesmit averages 15.3 points and John Blackwell 12.8. Nolan Winter leads with 5.8 boards per game, with Tonje at 5.5. The Badgers have a 1.3 rebound advantage per game, but were pounded on the boards by Arizona, 52-28. They offset that by hitting 41 of 47 free throws. The Vaqueros (3-2) have won three straight since opening the season with road losses at Nebraska and No. 14 Creighton. ""We have to be ready to regroup and be the best version of ourselves and just get better and better,"" first-year coach Kahil Fennell said following that road trip. K.T. Raimey averages a team-high 15.0 points, while Hasan Abdul-Hakim adds 14.6 points and 6.2 boards. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

As No. 20 Arkansas prepares for a visit from Pacific on Monday night in Fayetteville, Ark., forward Zvonimir Ivisic already can recite the top of the lesson plan. ""When you play good defense and then when you start running, you get, you know, you start to elevate. Playing better,"" Ivisic said. ""You make one transition, then you play good defense again."" Arkansas (2-1) created distance from Troy when aggressive defense finally began paying dividends on offense in the Razorbacks' 65-49 victory. The Razorbacks shot 29.4 percent from the field in the first half compared with 63.6 percent in the second half and collected 11 of their 14 assists after the break. There also were shortcomings, namely a minus-seven margin in rebounding, but Calipari said he sees promise as non-conference play continues. ""This is a good group. I'm enjoying coaching them,"" he said. ""I'm holding them to a high standard. I'm telling them that. I don't back up. This is what it is. How do you finish a game? How do you massage the ball? How do you get open late? You can't just jog around."" Ivisic exhibited that urgency with 19 points -- on 6-for-7 shooting from 3-point range -- plus five blocks, both career bests. Adou Thiero, who is averaging a team-high 17 points a game for the Razorbacks this seaon, also had 19 points along with seven rebounds against Troy, while teammate Boogie Fland contributed 12 points and seven assists. Arkansas hopes to get a scoring spark from D.J. Wagner in the backcourt. While he had a solid floor game against Troy with five assists, four steals and two rebounds, Wagner went scoreless on 0-for-4 shooting over 37 minutes. ""He's one of the greatest kids that I've ever coached. He is a player who plays to win,"" Calipari said. ""But we need him to score baskets, too. I told him the best shot he has is a floater. ... Just kaboom, let it go."" Pacific (3-2) is coming off a 60-57 home loss to Northern Arizona on Thursday. Despite struggling to a 39.2 percent shooting night and committing 17 turnovers, the Tigers chipped away at a 15-point deficit before falling short down the stretch. An Elijah Fisher 3-pointer with 2 seconds remaining brought the Tigers to the final margin. Elias Ralph paced Pacific with a double-double -- 23 points and 11 rebounds -- and added a career-best five assists. He surpassed the 20-point mark for the second time this season. Ralph and Fisher, who chipped in 13 points and eight rebounds against Northern Arizona, have scored in double figures in each of Pacific's five games. Another constant for the Tigers: strong perimeter defense. Pacific has limited foes to sub-30 percent shooting from 3-point land in each game, including holding Northern Arizona to a 5-for-30 effort. Arkansas figures to challenge that stoutness. Led by Ivisic's hot hand, the Razorbacks finished 10-for-23 from beyond the arc against Troy, including a 2-for-3 effort from Fland. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Following the departure of Williams, Johnson was aware of his playing time and despite coming off the bench in each game, he is capitalizing on increased minutes and helping the No. 4 Tigers stay unbeaten through three games heading into Monday's visit from North Alabama. Johnson averaged 4.7 points last season when he came off the bench in 33 of 35 games while Williams averaged 12.4. This season, Johnson is Auburn's second-leading scorer at 14 per game behind Johni Broome's 16.7. Johnson enjoyed the best game of his career in Wednesday's 79-56 home win over Kent State, scoring a career-high 18 points. Johnson shot 8-of-11 from the floor and played 29 minutes after scoring 11 points in 31 minutes in Auburn's 74-69 win at then-No. 4 Houston on Nov.  9. ""Last summer I came in with a bigger chip on my shoulder because I knew I was going to have to take the spot that J-Will filled so well,"" Johnson said. ""So just trusting in my work, making sure I'm working on the right shots, I'm going to get in the offense. And also just playing with more confidence."" Johnson is forming an effective frontcourt tandem with Broome, who also scored 18 and made 8-of-12 shots from the floor against Kent State. Auburn is hoping to see another productive night from the tandem before facing Iowa State in the Maui Invitational later this month in a field that includes two-time reigning national champion UConn, North Carolina and Michigan State. ""I believe he could've played like this last year, and I always told him play your game, be confident,"" Broome said of Johnson. ""We played one on one every day in the summer, offseason, so I know how good he is. As you can see, when he plays with confidence, he's unstoppable."" Auburn also is hoping to avoid a letdown after sandwiching double-digit victories around its win at Houston. The Tigers are facing an opponent that moved up to Division I in 2018 and plays at a slower pace while shooting 47 percent from the floor and averaging 10.3 turnovers per game. Despite its slower pace, North Alabama (3-1) is averaging 87.5 points through its first four games. The Lions won their first three games by double digits before a 98-97 overtime home loss to Samford on Friday ""We've just got to come out ready to play like we would come out any other game,"" Auburn guard Denver Jones said. ""We've got to be just as excited as we were to play Houston to play UNA Monday, and I feel like that's going to be the biggest key as far as being the more excited team."" In the loss to Samford, North Alabama trailed by 19 at halftime before making a big comeback thanks to Jacari Lane's career-high 32 points. Lane, who is averaging 22.8 points, has surpassed 20 points in three of the Lions' four games. The schools are meeting for the second time. Auburn claimed a 70-44 home win on Dec. 14, 2021, when it shot 36.2 percent from the floor but held the Lions to 29.5 percent shooting and forced 18 turnovers. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

But the evidence shows the topic also is a national one. The No. 3 Bulldogs have the best record in the nation since the start of the 2019-20 season, and the Aztecs rank third as the two potent teams enter Monday night's epic non-conference showdown in San Diego. Gonzaga has a stellar .878 winning percentage (151-21 record) during the stretch. Houston (.843, 150-28) is second, with San Diego State (136-34) third while winning 80 percent of its games. The Bulldogs (3-0 this season) have reached two national championship games (2017, 2021) and the Aztecs (2-0) have been in one (2023) over the past seven NCAA Tournaments. This will be the second contest of a home-and-home series between clubs that are slated to be part of the Pac-12 in the 2026-27 season. Gonzaga was dealt a rare home loss last season when San Diego State registered an 84-74 victory in Spokane, Wash. ""Last year, when we beat them, it was the greatest thing in the world,"" Aztecs coach Brian Dutcher said. ""I'm not so sure it's so great with them coming in here; I think they'll have a long memory. This has been a great series. We don't play them every year, but when we do it's really competitive and it's been a lot of fun. ""(Bulldogs) head coach Mark Few has been great, giving us a chance to play them home-and-home. They can schedule anybody in the country and have. ... To get them at home is a great opportunity for our fans to see a really good basketball team against a developing Aztec team. We'll see if we're ready for the next step up."" This will be the first test of the season for San Diego State. It beat UC San Diego 63-58 and Division III Occidental 100-49 in two home encounters. Gonzaga opened the season with a 101-63 rout over then-No. 8 Baylor and followed with an 88-80 victory over Arizona State and a 113-54 pounding of UMass Lowell on Friday. Transfer Khalif Battle scored 21 points against UMass Lowell and is averaging 17.3 points per game. Battle has drained 11 of 18 3-point attempts. Battle previously played one season at Butler, three campaigns at Temple and last season for Arkansas, so he has seen a lot of different venues. He has been informed that San Diego State has one of the most raucous atmospheres in the country. ""It just feels good to go inside another arena and get a win and compete ultimately,"" Battle said. ""They're going to give us their best shot, we're going to give them our best shots, so whoever is victorious is victorious."" The large margin of victory over UMass Lowell displayed that the Bulldogs weren't looking past the contest. ""We've got a good mature group here, and we all know what needs to be done before a big game,"" Gonzaga guard Nolan Hickman said. ""This is just the showing of it."" Aztecs transfer guard Wayne McKinney III saw plenty of Gonzaga over the past three seasons while playing about eight miles to the west for San Diego of the West Coast Conference. ""It's always an up-pace tough battle against them,"" McKinney said of the Bulldogs. ""They always have their good scout team, and they have good players that come in every year ready to go. It's always a crazy environment, whether it's at The Kennel or elsewhere. It's always going to be a dog fight."" San Diego State is awaiting word on whether it will have ailing guard Miles Byrd (ankle), who scored 20 points in the opener and then sat out against Occidental. Dutcher said Byrd likely will be a game-time decision. The Aztecs have won three of the five meetings against Gonzaga. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Gibbens was injured in the third quarter when the Vikings running back Aaron Jones fumbled, with the Titans recovering the ball. Minnesota offensive lineman Garrett Bradbury blocked Gibbens to the ground on the play. Gibbens' lower leg was put in an air cast and he was carted off the field. Gibbens, who turns 26 next Sunday, started five of 10 games this season and had 44 tackles, 0.5 sacks and two tackles for loss. He led the Titans in tackles with 14 in an overtime victory over New England on Nov. 3 and had a career-high 15 in a 27-17 loss at the Los Angeles Chargers on Nov. 10.

The Jayhawks (4-0) welcomed Shakeel Moore for his first five minutes in KU colors on Saturday in a win over Oakland. The Mississippi State transfer guard had two rebounds, an assist and two points in the win and provided coach Bill Self with the first glimpse of his desired nine-player rotation.   ""Shaq's not quite whole -- he had a five-minute limit on him but I wanted to get him out there,"" said Self. ""But by hopefully next week he could be close to that. I do think there's a core nine we can put out there, be interchangeable.""   Kansas used all 15 players on the roster against Oakland. Self admits he used too many, but it's an effort to build out a roster to keep the top-ranked team in the country ready for upcoming nonconference games against big-name foes such as Duke, Creighton and NC State.    First the Jayhawks get another tuneup on Tuesday against the Seahawks (3-0), who head to Kansas after winning their third game to start the season, an 89-85 win against USC Upstate. In that game, Donovan Newby led the offense for the Seahawks, scoring 20 points. He averages a team-leading 22.7 points per game.   ""Donovan does so much for us,"" said head coach Tayako Siddle. ""He's a calming presence for us. He gets us into our offense, he ignites our fast break, he does so many things for us. He's an extension of me on the court.""   Newby leads a team that stresses offense by committee. While the guard averages nine more points per game than the next closest Seahawk, 10 of UNCW's players average at least seven points per game, with four averaging double-digits.   ""The makeup of our group is we could have four or five guys in double figures, averaging double figures, and you know we can have some other guys three to more guys right around seven, eight, points,"" said Siddle. ""And that's exactly how I want it to be. We'll be as successful as the whole unit.""   Wilmington has their work cut out against Kansas, who have 21- and 30-point wins against non-Power Five conference schools to start the season. Leading Kansas is Hunter Dickinson, the two-time All-American averaging a near double-double with 18.5 points and 9.3 rebounds per game.    Against Michigan State on Nov. 12, the 7-foot-1 center who transferred before last season from Michigan scored 28 points and grabbed 12 rebounds in the win over the former Big Ten rival Spartans. The win was the 591st at Kansas for Self in 22 seasons, surpassing legendary Phog Allen's record of 590.   Self is keeping Kansas at the top of future-centric rankings, too.  On Saturday, Self and the Jayhawks signed Bryson Tiller, the latest commitment in a class loaded with top-ranked talent.   ""It's a good class. I think we signed three pros,"" said Self. ""Bryson is ultra-talented. He would be a top five, top seven, kid in the class if he hadn't got hurt. He's talented man. He's 6-10 and can play anywhere on the floor.

The Huskies (3-0) started their season in workmanlike fashion, barely tested in three games UConn won by an average of 38.7 points per game. Up next is East Texas A&M on Tuesday in Storrs, Conn., the latest in a stretch of confidence-building contests against inferior opponents.  UConn posted a 90-49 victory over Le Moyne on Wednesday in Hartford in which Alex Karaban scored a game-high 17 points and Liam McNeeley finished with 15. The Huskies are looking the part of two-time defending NCAA champion. They dominated Le Moyne by shooting 55.6 percent to 35.2 percent from the floor, forging a 17-0 advantage in points off turnovers and a 12-0 edge in fastbreak points. Tarris Reed Jr. racked up 12 points and 10 rebounds, Solo Ball also had a dozen points and Hassan Diarra poured in 10 in the win for UConn. The Huskies amassed 46 points in the paint and every player that saw court found the scoring column. Because the Huskies haven't looked game-ready at tipoff to head coach Dan Hurley, he shifted the rotation to bring Diarra off the bench in a sixth-man role. ""The slow starts are not ideal,"" Hurley said. ""But the nice thing about having (Diarra) there, and the way he's handling it -- obviously, he could easily be starting these games for us. There's something very comforting having him over there, the way he changes the game, the way he's handling accepting that role right now for us."" Tuesday's game is the last before the Huskies get a huge uptick in competition at the Maui Invitational starting Monday against Memphis. Hurley understands that his team is still not the best version of itself before heading to the islands. ""We've got a long way to go, defensively, offensively, for where we want to be, just like most teams in the country are experiencing,"" Hurley said. ""As we're trying to develop our identity and establish roles and rotations, and exactly how we're gonna play it."" East Texas A&M (formerly Texas A&M-Commerce) heads northeast after a 70-68 home win over Southern on Wednesday. The Lions (1-3) snapped a three-game losing streak behind Khaliq Abdul-Mateen's 18 points and five rebounds and 14 points by Evan Phelps. Scooter Williams Jr. added 13 points for East Texas A&M, including the deciding basket with 59 seconds remaining. The Lions have won their home opener every season since 2012.

Atlanta (6-5) was held without a touchdown for the first time this year and allowed a season high in points in falling 38-6 on the road against the Denver Broncos on Sunday. The Falcons' defense was without cornerbacks Mike Hughes (neck), Dee Alford (hamstring) and Antonio Hamilton (pectoral). Kevin King, an injury replacement, exited Sunday's game with a concussion. Defensive linemen Ta'Quon Graham (pectoral) and James Smith-Williams (tibia) were also out, along with linebackers JD Bertrand (concussion) and Troy Andersen (knee). The Atlanta defensive front couldn't afford the barrage of injuries, as its 10 sacks rank last in the NFL. The Falcons finally reached the double-digit mark in the category against the Broncos when Matthew Judon took down Bo Nix in the final minute of the first half. Falcons coach Raheem Morris said that Sunday was about more than just an ineffective pass rush. ""We got our butts kicked, and we've got to be able to come to grips with that,"" Morris said Monday at his press conference. ""We've got to reset ourselves and get healthy so we can come back and get ready to go full speed. ...

Morris anticipates Andersen, Alford and Hughes will return following the bye week in time for the Week 13 home meeting with the Los Angeles Chargers. Offensively, the Falcons were held to their lowest point total since Week 3 of 2023, when they lost 20-6 to the Detroit Lions. Younghoe Koo made field goals of 41 and 51 yards.

The second NBA Cup game for each team is a rematch of the playoff series dominated by the Celtics last season, when Cavs All-Star Donovan Mitchell was relegated to cheerleader due to injury.  ""It's great for the NBA, right?"" Cleveland coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""Everybody is going to be watching, and I know our guys are anxious. I know they remember last year. We're going well. They're going well. It's great for the league. Great for our franchise. We're excited.""  The Cavaliers became the fourth team to start an NBA season with 15 straight victories when they beat Charlotte 128-114 on Sunday.    The Golden State Warriors (2015-16), Houston Rockets (1993-94) and Washington Capitols (1948-49) are the only NBA teams who've matched that start (15-0). Only the 2015-16 Warriors extended their winning streak to 16 games. Golden State went 24-0 in 2015-16 before losing its first game.     ""I just think they have a very similar group, and I think just having another year of chemistry and continuity together under your belt is important,"" Boston forward Sam Hauser said. ""And for them, it's looked really good to this point. But we're excited to try to put a loss in their loss column.""   Cleveland prevailed Sunday playing without Mitchell (rest). The All-Star signed a massive contract in the offseason and leads the team in scoring at 24.6 points per game.  Mitchell didn't play because of a left calf strain in the final two games of last year's Eastern Conference semifinals, when the Celtics eliminated the Cavaliers in five games.    Isaac Okoro and Dean Wade both sustained ankle injuries during the second half of Sunday's win.    Cleveland is averaging a league-high 123.7 points per game. Boston allowed a season-high 76 points in the paint during a 126-123 overtime victory against Toronto on Saturday.    ""I feel like overall just giving up too many layups,"" Boston's Jaylen Brown said after the Toronto victory. ""I feel like our defense could be better. I feel like there were way too (many) easy shots in paint and that's kind of been the theme, so we got to figure that out.""    ""Individual defense and rebounding,"" added Boston coach Joe Mazzulla. ""Those are the biggest areas we've gotta get better at. We've just gotta guard the ball and we've gotta rebound as a team.""    Cleveland beat Chicago 144-126 in its first NBA Cup game on Friday. Boston's opened NBA Cup play with a 117-116 loss to Atlanta on Nov. 12.    ""It's going to be a great test for us,"" Atkinson said. ""They obviously play a different style, five-out with five shooters, so it's going to be a real good test for us. We're at that point right now -- 15-0 and let's test ourselves against the best and see where we stand and see where we're going to make adjustments or not make adjustments.""    Boston's Jrue Holiday sat out Saturday's victory over Toronto with a knee injury, but Mazzulla said he expects Holiday to play against Cleveland. Saturday marked the first time Holiday has not played in a game this season.    ""Obviously, they're a really good team,"" Boston point guard Payton Pritchard said. ""They've got a lot of good guards, good length. I feel like their bigs are playing well. Obviously, their guards (Mitchell and Darius Garland) are All-Star-level guards.    ""So it's going to be a good matchup. We're looking forward to it. It's going to be competitive and, hopefully, the Boston crowd comes out.""    --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Pinellas County Commission is scheduled to vote on $600 million of bonds for the project on Tuesday, but a vote postponed last month could be delayed again. Rays owner Stuart Sternberg is seething from last month's non-action he viewed as the commission breaking promises. ""Last month, the county commission upended our ballpark agreement by not approving their bonds, as they promised to do,"" Sternberg told the Tampa Bay Times. ""That action sent a clear message that we had lost the county as a partner. ""The future of baseball in Tampa Bay became less certain after that vote."" Sternberg said that relocation ""is not an unlikely conclusion."" As structure, the proposal up for vote calls for the new ballpark to open in 2028 in the city's Historic Gas Plant District. Any delay in construction would certainly raise the cost of the project. Complicating the situation is that the area was damaged during Hurricane Milton, which struck the area on Oct. 9. The Category 3 hurricane ravaged Tropicana Field and tore off 18 of the 24 roof panels. A report released by the city of St. Petersburg pinpoints stadium repairs at $55 million and $26 million alone for the roof replacement. Next season, the Rays are scheduled to play at George Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, the spring-training site of the New York Yankees. On the possibility of franchise relocation, the Tampa Bay Times cited a $25 million insurance policy for repairs. If the commission chooses not to pay beyond that price, the Rays would be free to pursue relocation as soon as 2026. ""We're going to exhaust all that we can here until, and unless, it comes to that,"" Sternberg told the Tampa Bay Times. ""We've been in that sort of position before, in a sense, but without an expiring clock. An expiring clock that just exploded, basically. ""If we had 10 years, 12 years left, it's a different conversation. If we had one year left, it's probably a different conversation. If we had no plans to do a stadium here, it's a different conversation."" The 2025 season will mark the Rays' 28th season on the West Coast of Florida. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The racing team confirmed Monday that it will have a process allowing drivers to request competing outside the NASCAR Cup Series on dirt tracks and in other forms of motorsports -- something Gibbs has restricted. The policy change follows Chase Briscoe, a former Stewart-Haas Racing driver and dirt star, joining JGR in 2025 to replace the retiring Martin Truex Jr. Gibbs told The Athletic in a story on Monday that he has ""always preferred (drivers') focus remain on racing in NASCAR."" However, with his team including former dirt racing champions Christopher Bell and Briscoe, and a third driver, Ty Gibbs, interested in that extracurricular competition, Gibbs had a change of heart. ""We sort of talked things over to come up with a process by which they can request to run certain races,"" Gibbs told The Athletic. ""If they get approval from everyone they need on our competition side, then they are free to run the race. That includes dirt, but also potentially other forms of racing."" Briscoe is a dirt car owner who regularly drives on those tracks, while Bell won the prestigious Chili Bowl Midget Nationals in 2017, 2018 and 2019. ""I was definitely caught off guard by the change of policy,"" Bell told The Athletic. ""I was super shocked, but with Chase coming on board and Ty growing an interest in dirt racing, it's nice we have the majority of our team aligned with it now."" The fourth driver on the JGR Cup roster, Denny Hamlin, is not a dirt racer. Neither Briscoe nor Bell have announced plans in any non-Cup Series races but said they're pleased to have more options. ""It's refreshing knowing I'll be able to do whatever I want to do,"" said Bell, who believes the experience of driving sprint cars is advantageous for stock car racing.

Eberflus said the Bears are sending a report and video of Chicago's field-goal try as time expired to the NFL to repeat the complaint he shared with officials in real time on Karl Brooks' block of Cairo Santos try for a game-winning 46-yarder.  ""(The Packers) were on our longsnapper,"" Eberflus said Monday, a violation of the NFL rule that defenses must leave the snapper ""uncovered"" on placement kicks.  The result of the play was Green Bay holding on for a 20-19 victory extending the Packers' streak of wins over the Bears to 11 under head coach Matt LaFleur. Eberflus is 0-5 against the Packers and the Bears are 4-6 after starting the season 4-2. Brooks said he only got his middle finger on the ball and was concerned upon contact that he didn't slow the ball down enough. The play was the focus of special teams coach Rich Bisaccia in last week's practices according to LaFleur. LaFleur said Bisaccia told the team he ""wouldn't understand"" if they didn't come out of the Week 11 game at Soldier Field with a blocked kick because of Santos' penchant for lower, line-drive angles on longer kicks. ""We were going to block it,"" Green Bay defensive lineman Kenny Clark said of what the Packers discussed on the final play. ""We talked about TJ (Slaton) or KB (Brooks) blocking the kick all week. They've got holes in their field goal protection and a couple of them they got close. So we've been talking about that all week. It was a problem, so, coach Rich has been telling them all week and we ended up getting one."" Eberflus repeated Monday that he didn't regret not running another play to shorten the length of the field goal try on second down. Santos has never missed a field goal from 40 yards or closer, making all 71 of his tries from that distance with the Bears.  ""We didn't want to risk a fumble or a holding penalty. We felt good about where we were at on the field to kick the field goal,"" Eberflus said Monday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Bruins: The performance against one of the NHL's bottom teams is going to heighten calls for Boston management to fire coach Jim Montgomery.  Early in the first period, Merzļikins lost his stick and it slid all the way into the corner. But Boston wasn't able to test the disarmed goalie; instead, Dante Fabbro sent the puck ahead and out of the zone to Sean Monahan, who found Voronkov cutting down the middle and splitting two defensemen.  Voronkov backhanded the puck past Swayman as Bruins defenseman Brandon Carlo desperately swiped at the puck from behind and then crashed into the goal, knocking it off its moorings a split second after the puck hit the back of the net.

The NHL said Dunning was taken to a hospital for precautionary reasons and that all neurological signs are normal. Manson skated alone on the ice when he slammed into Dunning near the blue line early in the first period. Dunning went down in a heap and lay prone on the ice for several minutes. Dunning appeared to be moving his feet and moved his right hand when Manson went to talk to him. The game at the Wells Fargo Center was delayed for several minutes while trainers and medical staff tended to Dunning. “I just got back to the bench and next thing I know I looked out and saw Mans was kind of holding his face and the ref was on the ground,” said Colorado defenseman Cale Makar. “You never want to see that happen, especially on an accident like that. Very tough. Hopefully he's OK.” Makar scored two goal in Colorado's 3-2 win over the Flyers. Dunning is a former professional hockey defenseman who played parts of three seasons in the OHL.

Daniels' clutch defensive play on Kings star De'Aaron Fox finished off a late back-and-forth affair. Trae Young had 19 assists for Atlanta. Clint Capela, who had 14 points and 14 rebounds, scored the final three points for the Hawks to put them up 109-106 with under two minutes to play.

Go! Go!"" he urged the golf ball as it descended over the water. It dropped in front of the flag, a foot from the hole, a shot that carried him to another victory in the season-ending DP World Tour Championship, his fourth win of the year, and a sixth title as No. 1 on the European tour. By all accounts, it was a great year. But it's different when those trophies — and a big one that was missing — belong to McIlroy. “I'm going to look back on 2024 and I'm going to have four wins,” he said. Two were in Dubai, at the start and finish of the year. One was at Quail Hollow for the fourth time. The other was the most fun — the Zurich Classic with close friend Shane Lowry, followed by McIlroy belting out Journey's “Don't Stop Believin'” at a post-tournament party. “But I know that my 2024 is going to be defined — at least by others — by the tournaments that I didn't win as much as the tournaments I did,” he said. Such are the expectations for McIlroy. He has to come to accept them, or he wouldn't have brought that up without any prompting. This is what happens with greatness. And this is a level of play that remarkably doesn't get enough credit. Yes, he was tops in Europe for the third consecutive time, and sixth overall. That leaves him only two away from matching the record of Colin Montgomerie, who had the advantage of never leaving Europe to play two tours. But go back to Oct. 4, 2009. McIlroy tied for second in the Dunhill Links Championship and moved to No. 19 in the world at age 20. He has not been outside the top 20 ever since, an astonishing streak of 15 years and counting. Phil Mickelson at 16 years and 30 weeks is the only player to have a longer run in the top 20. Even so, the only streak that matters when the conversation turns to McIlroy is his 10 straight years without a major. That's what gives him pause when he rates his year. He was three holes away from a U.S. Open title at Pinehurst No. 2 until he missed short par putts on the 16th and 18th holes, and Bryson DeChambeau saved par with an exquisite bunker shot to beat him. McIlroy has been desperate to win the Masters for the career Grand Slam. At this point, any major would do. Who could have imagined his last major would have come at age 25? There also was disappointment on losing a late lead to a fast-charging Rasmus Hojgaard in the Irish Open at Royal County Down, right when all of Northern Ireland was ready to celebrate McIlroy winning on home soil. Billy Horschel beat him in a playoff at Wentworth. McIlroy's dynamic charge in Paris drowned with a wedge into the water at the Olympics. Play long enough at that level and those outcomes are bound to happen. A great year? For anyone else, sure. “Unfortunately for Rory, I think everybody looks at the glass half-empty,” Lowry said. ""I look at it glass half-full. He's had an amazingly consistent year. I've had a consistent year, but he's had consistent top-3 finishes — mine are top 15s. “He probably should have won the U.S. Open — let's be honest, and he'd say that himself — but he didn't,” Lowry said. “I think he is more determined than ever to come out firing next year, and obviously the Masters will be on the forefront.” It was more than DeChambeau pipping him at Pinehurst that gave McIlroy pause. He won four times and actually dropped one spot in the world ranking to No. 3, behind Scottie Scheffler and Xander Schauffele. Scheffler has no equal at the moment with eight wins, including the Masters, The Players Championship and Olympic gold. Schauffele won two majors at the PGA Championship and British Open. “They certainly separated themselves from the pack this year,” McIlroy said. “I'm obviously aware of that, and it only makes me more motivated to try to emulate what they did this year.” McIlroy said he got choked up at the end of his season at the mention of tying the late Seve Ballesteros with a sixth Order of Merit. Ballesteros is the soul of European golf, and that's not likely to change no matter how many more titles McIlroy wins. But there was more to the emotion. The end of any season tends to bring that out, and this was a season like no other. Off the course, McIlroy has been involved in negotiations between the PGA Tour and the Saudi backers of LIV Golf, and his desire to reunite with LIV defectors occasionally has put him at odds with other players. Far more personal was the shock announcement in May he had filed for divorce, and then disclosing a month later they had scrapped the divorce filing in a bid to save their marriage. His wife, Erica, and 4-year-old daughter Poppy celebrated with him in Dubai. Call it five wins for the year. He played 27 times, a lot early in search of the right formula to be ready for the Masters, and a lot late because the European tour means a lot to him. He says he will scale back. He is not getting any younger. He is no less entertaining. In light of it all, golf is a game. But that wedge was big. Winning was important. For such a tumultuous year, it was the ideal way for it to end. “Yeah, it's been quite the year,” McIlroy said. “But you know, I'm super happy with where I am in my career and in my life. And I feel like everything’s worked out the way it was supposed to.” ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Rasmus Andersson had the lone goal in regulation for Calgary. Andrei Kuzmenko and Justin Kirkland scored in the shootout. Pierre Engvall, with his third goal of the season and third in as many games, scored the lone goal for New York. Wolf, who improves to 7-2-1, stopped Kyle Palmieri and Bo Horvat in the shootout. Semyon Varlamov had 30 stops for New York, falling to a 3-3-2 record. New York had the best chance to win it in overtime, but failed to score on a power play with Noah Dobson wiring a shot off the crossbar. Islanders: New York poured on the pressure early in the third period, but could not beat Wolf, who stopped a flurry of early shots, the most dangerous coming off the stick of Horvat, who had his close-in chance denied by Wolf’s right pad.  Flames: Calgary’s 30th-ranked power play entered the night two for their last 37, but after waiting more than 46 minutes for their first and only man advantage of the night, they took advantage with Andersson ripping a slap shot past Varlamov to end his seven-game point drought. After Yegor Sharangovich and Palmieri were denied to begin the shootout, Kuzmenko put the Flames up 1-0 with a quick backhand under the crossbar. After Wolf got his glove on Horvat’s shootout attempt, Kirkland won it with a quick shot glove side. Calgary has been held to three or fewer goals in 16 straight games, but they’ve gone 7-6-3 over that stretch thanks to the stellar goaltending. The Islanders wrap up a five-game road trip in Detroit while the Flames host the Rangers on Thursday. ___ AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
ABC News: Sports,The bungling Bengals are wasting prolific seasons from their biggest stars,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/bungling-bengals-wasting-prolific-seasons-biggest-stars-116047420,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 10:10:36 -0500",The stars for the Cincinnati Bengals are performing at an extremely high level,"The stars for the Cincinnati Bengals are performing at an extremely high level Inside the Numbers dives into NFL statistics, streaks and trends each week. For more Inside the Numbers, head here. ___ The Cincinnati Bengals' stars are performing at an extremely high level. Joe Burrow leads the NFL in yards passing and TD passes, Ja'Marr Chase is on pace for a rare receiving triple crown, and Trey Hendrickson has more sacks than any other player. Sounds like a recipe for success. Unfortunately for the Bengals, it hasn't worked out that way so far. Cincinnati is mired in 10th place in the AFC with a 4-7 record despite having a chance to become the first team since sacks became an official stat in 1982 to have the league leader in yards passing, yards receiving and sacks in the same season. Six of the Bengals losses have come by seven points or fewer thanks to some missed field goals in key spots, defensive breakdowns and no go-ahead TD drives by Burrow and the offense in the fourth quarter. Burrow became the second QB in NFL history to lose consecutive starts when throwing for at least 350 yards and three TDs without an interception in a 34-27 loss to the Chargers on Sunday night. The Bengals rallied from 27-6 down to tie the score in the fourth before Evan McPherson missed two field goals and the Bengals punted in the final minute to set up the Chargers' game-winning drive. Burrow has thrown for 3,028 yards with 27 TDs and four interceptions this season. The seven previous QBs who threw for at least 3,000 yards and 25 TDs with five or fewer interceptions in the first 11 games combined for a 69-8 record compared to Burrow's 4-7 mark.  Burrow isn't alone in putting up prolific numbers in Cincinnati with Chase leading the NFL with 73 catches, 1,056 yards and 12 TDs. Only four players since the merger led the NFL in those three categories for an entire season to win the Triple Crown: Cooper Kupp (2021), Steve Smith (2005), Sterling Sharpe (1992) and Jerry Rice (1990). Hendrickson's 11 1/2 sacks are the most for any player, ahead of the nine for the Giants' Dexter Lawrence and Denver's Nik Bonitto. The Detroit Lions are accomplishing feats that haven't been done in decades with their 52-6 win over Jacksonville their most dominant one yet. The Lions outgained the Jaguars 645-170 for the third largest margin in the Super Bowl era. The Rams topped that twice in the 1970s, outgaining the Seahawks by 482 yards on Nov. 4, 1979, and the Falcons by 488 yards on Dec. 4, 1976. The win improved Detroit to 9-1 for the best record after 10 games for the franchise since the team started 10-0 in 1934. The Lions fell behind 3-0 before scoring TDs on their first seven possessions, becoming the first team to do that since New England in 2007 against Buffalo. Only two teams in NFL history have won a game they trailed at any point by a larger margin than Detroit did, with Green Bay beating New Orleans 52-3 after falling behind 3-0 in 2005 and the Packers beating the Steelers 54-7 after trailing 7-0 in 1941. The Lions are the third team in the Super Bowl era to win at least three of their first 10 games by 35 points or more, joining the 1973 Falcons and 1969 Vikings. Detroit ran for four touchdowns in the game, extending their NFL record with their 24th straight game in the regular season or playoffs with a TD run.  Jared Goff also bounced back from a five-interception performance in Week 10 against Houston by going 24 for 29 for 412 yards, four TDs and a “perfect” passer rating of 158.3. Goff had his second career game with at least 400 yards, four TDs and the highest attainable passer rating of 158.3, having also done it for the Rams against Minnesota in 2018. There have been only seven of those games in NFL history with Goff the only player to do it multiple times.  Mike Tomlin has made an art out of pulling out wins when his offense can't reach the end zone. The Pittsburgh Steelers won for the second time this season without scoring a touchdown, getting six field goals from Chris Boswell in an 18-16 win over Baltimore on Sunday. Boswell also made six field goals in an 18-10 win over Atlanta in Week 1. The Steelers became the second team in the last 20 seasons to win multiple games in a season without a TD, joining the 2016 Rams. In all, Tomlin has won five games in his career in the regular season or playoffs when his team doesn't score a touchdown, one shy of Marv Levy for the most by any coach since 1972. Tomlin's .333 win percentage when his team doesn't score a touchdown ranks first in that span among the 73 coaches who have had at least 10 games without a TD. With one more win or tie, Tomlin will have his 18th straight season without a losing record, trailing only Tom Landry (21 straight seasons) and Bill Belichick (19) for the longest streaks for a coach. Taysom Hill has built a career as a jack-of-all-trades player on New Orleans' offense. The part-time QB, tight end, running back and receiver took it to a new level on Sunday in a win over Cleveland. Hill ran for 138 yards and three TDs on seven carries, caught eight passes for 50 yards and completed an 18-yard pass to help lead the Saints to the win. Hill became the first player in NFL history to rush for at least 100 yards and three TDs, have at least 50 yards receiving and throw for at least 10 yards. He did it by lining up all over the Saints offense with 10 snaps from the slot, eight at quarterback, six as a running back, four as a wide receiver and four as a tight end, according to NFL NextGen Stats. He became the first player in the NGS era beginning in 2016 to have at least four snaps at all five of those positions. Hill's best work came out of the backfield as he had TD runs of 10, 33 and 75 yards. Only three players since the merger older than Hill (34 years, 86 days) rushed for more yards in a game with John Riggins gaining 165 and 140 in two games at age 35 for Washington in 1984, and 36-year-old MacArthur Lane rushing for 144 yards for Kansas City at Buffalo in 1978.  ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

When Paolini's win ended, she was joined on court by her teammates, and they embraced each other, then danced and sang along as the Gypsy Kings' version of “Volare” blared on the loudspeakers. The No. 4-ranked Paolini was the runner-up at the French Open in June and at Wimbledon in July, making her the first woman since Serena Williams in 2016 to get to the title matches at Roland Garros and the All England Club in the same season. Before this year, Paolini, who is 28, had lost in the first or second round in all 16 career appearances at majors. “Unbelievable year. Unbelievable. A crazy year. To finish like this, with a title … it’s amazing. I don’t have words to describe it. I’m trying just to enjoy every moment,” Paolini said. “I feel lucky to be in the position. I feel lucky to be part of this team.” She also teamed with Sara Errani to win a doubles gold medal at the Paris Olympics in August. They were lined up to play in the concluding match against Slovakia, but it wasn't needed because Italy clinched the best-of-three series by sweeping the two singles matches. “Jasmine raised her level really high this year. ... She’s an example for all of us,” said her teammate, 78th-ranked Lucia Bronzetti, who took Wednesday’s opener by a 6-2, 6-4 score against Viktoria Hruncakova before a crowd that included International Tennis Hall of Famer and equal rights pioneer Billie Jean King herself.  Bronzetti called it an “honor” to compete in front of the woman for whom the event is named, saying, “She is a great person, a great legend.” Italy, which eliminated Iga Swiatek and Poland in the semifinals, earned its fifth championship a year after finishing as the runner-up to Canada. “I’m so proud of them. They fight every day,” Italian captain Tathiana Garbin said. “This journey was incredible.” The triumph adds to what’s been quite a recent run for Italy in tennis, including two Grand Slam trophies in 2024 and the No. 1 men’s ranking for Jannik Sinner, who helped his country claim last year’s Davis Cup. Sinner and Italy meet Argentina in the men’s quarterfinals Thursday. This is the first time the two premier International Tennis Federation team events are being held at the same site, although the women’s matches are being played in a much smaller venue. They are using a temporary court set up under a white tent, with a capacity of 4,000; the men are playing in a permanent arena with 9,200 seats that were full Tuesday for Rafael Nadal’s last match before retirement in Spain’s loss to the Netherlands. Bronzetti never had played a BJK Cup singles match until this week. She said she didn’t find out until Tuesday night that she would be in the lineup against Slovakia. “I didn’t sleep very well,” Bronzetti said. “You’re not playing just for yourself,” she said. “You’re playing for your team and your country.” Serenaded by chants of her first name — “Loo-Chee-Ah! Loo-Chee-Ah!” — that mingled with the sounds of a drum and red plastic horn played in the cheering section behind Slovakia’s bench, Bronzetti claimed the last three games of the first set and the last four of the match. She trailed 4-2, 40-15 in the second set but turned it around. “I was a little worried I was going to a third,” Bronzetti said. Slovakia, which won the BJK Cup in 2002, eliminated the United States, Australia and Britain to get to the final this time. ___ The story has been changed to delete an incorrect reference to Iga Swiatek being ranked No. 1. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Werder had more than a half-million followers for its German-language channel on X, which was named Twitter when the club joined in May 2008. “Under the guise of freedom of expression, hate speech, hatred towards minorities, right-wing extremist posts and conspiracy theories have been allowed to spread on X at an incredible pace,” the club said in a post in English.  The “recent radicalization” of X meant “a line has been crossed,” Werder said. Musk was cited in a news release in German on Werder’s website that claimed he used the platform as a political weapon.

Lillard scored 18 points after missing the previous three games while in the concussion protocol. The Rockets rallied from a 14-point, third-quarter deficit to take the lead early in the fourth quarter and stayed ahead until Lillard’s decisive basket. Giannis Antetokounmpo blocked a shot by Houston's Alperen Sengun with 20 seconds left. Houston called timeout after Lillard's layup. After the Bucks fouled with 2 seconds left, Houston’s Fred VanVleet tried inbounding the ball to Sengun, who couldn’t catch it cleanly under the basket. VanVleet unsuccessfully tried passing to Jabari Smith Jr. as the horn sounded. Brook Lopez had 27 points, 10 rebounds and four blocks for Milwaukee. Antetokounmpo had 20 points and 14 rebounds.

Hours after Nadal's 6-4, 6-4 loss to Botic van de Zandschulp of the Netherlands was over, the evening did turn out to represent the 22-time Grand Slam champion's farewell to professional tennis, because the Dutch eliminated the Spaniards in the quarterfinals just after midnight. And it was during an on-court, post-match ceremony to honor Nadal that he cried and cried, at the singsong chorus of “Raaa-faaa” from the spectators, at the video showing highlights from his more than two decades on tour and the collection of recorded tributes from current or former players such as his Big Three rivals Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, Serena Williams, Conchita Martinez and Andy Murray, and stars from other sports such as golf's Sergio Garcia or soccer's David Beckham. “ The titles, the numbers, are there, so people probably know that, but the way I would like to be remembered is as a good person from a small village in Mallorca,” the 38-year-old Nadal told the flag-waving, sign-toting crowd at the sold-out Palacio de Deportes Jose Maria Martin Carpena. “Just a kid that followed their dreams, worked as hard as possible. ... I have been very lucky.”  He had said beforehand that his feelings would need to be put on hold, that this week was about attempting to claim one last trophy for his country, not about pondering his impending retirement, which he announced last month would come after this event.  But he acknowledged after playing that ""the emotions were difficult to manage,” and that he felt nerves out there amid the roars of an adoring audience that mostly showed up for one player and one player only. After Nadal, a 14-time French Open champion, was beaten on the indoor hard court in southern Spain, he became a cheerleader for his heir apparent, Carlos Alcaraz, who evened the matchup against the Netherlands at 1-all by getting past Tallon Griekspoor 7-6 (0), 6-3 in the other singles match. But then van de Zandschulp and Wesley Koolhof clinched the victory for the Dutch by defeating Alcaraz and Marcel Granollers 7-6 (4), 7-6 (3) in the deciding doubles match. Even if Spain had managed to get past the Netherlands, Nadal said that if he were his team's captain, he wouldn't pick himself to play again in the semifinals after that performance against the 80th-ranked van de Zandschulp. At least he was in a joking mood after the result put a stop to his 29-match winning streak in Davis Cup singles. The only other blemish on his record, which stood at 29-1 entering Tuesday, came in his 2004 debut. “I lost my first match in the Davis Cup, and I lost my last one,” Nadal said with a wide grin. “So we close the circle.” When a forehand found the net to close his last match, Nadal walked to the net for a quick hug with his opponent. “That was a tough, tough match to play,” said van de Zandschulp, noting that he idolized Nadal while growing up. In certain ways, this was, unmistakably, the Nadal that van de Zandschulp — and so many others — can remember. The white headband, marked with the red bull logo Nadal made famous. The white tape wrapped around all four of his left, racket-holding fingers. The water bottles by his sideline bench, placed just so. There was the occasional ace right on a line. The occasional serve-and-volley foray. The occasional over-the-shoulder putaway. And, yes, the occasional uppercut and scream of “Vamos!” There also were — neither to Nadal’s or most of the 9,200 spectators’ liking — several points where he looked like a once-dominant figure diminished by age and injuries.  Nadal was just not able to bring his best, no matter how many chants of “Ra-fa!” or “España!” or “Si, se puede!” (“Yes, you can!”) broke out, no matter how many scarves reading “Gracias, Rafa!” or red-and-yellow Spanish flags of all sizes filled the arena. This version of Nadal had hip issues, including surgery in June 2023, and abdominal problems that combined to limit him to only 24 matches over the past two years. He went 12-8 in singles in 2024. The match against van de Zandschulp — who upset Alcaraz at the U.S. Open — was Nadal’s first outing that counted since early August at the Paris Olympics. He lost there in the second round of singles to Djokovic and bowed out in the doubles quarterfinals alongside Alcaraz. Nadal and Alcaraz practiced with each other hours before the start of play. The day, much like the entire Davis Cup leadup, was largely about memories of, and praise for, Nadal. “You know very well what you have meant to the tennis world,” said Spain's captain, David Ferrer, who lost to Nadal in the 2013 French Open final. “We will miss you a lot.” Nadal’s appeal was found in how he played tennis, relentless and striking each shot as if it might be his last, and the humility he displayed away from competition. No one cared for him as much as his fellow Spaniards. He is a national hero, transcending sports, and that was clear from the love expressed over and over via shouts and standing ovations — when Nadal entered the court, when he won a point, when his match ended, and so on. “When we heard the news that Rafa was retiring, this really became something special — a chance to see the greatest sportsman in the country’s history,” said Luis Julve, a 19-year-old college student who made the trip from Madrid with his mother and aunt. When the matches, the ceremony, the night and his career were over, Nadal hugged his teammates and left the court, pausing to wave goodbye to his fans one last time. “The truth is that nobody ever wants to arrive at this moment,” Nadal said. “I’m not tired of playing tennis, but it’s my body that doesn’t want to play anymore, so I have to accept the situation.

This was a chance for the undefeated Cleveland Cavaliers to see where they stood against the defending champions. “This was a great test for us, and unfortunately we didn’t get the win,” said Donovan Mitchell, whose 35 points couldn’t prevent the Cavaliers from picking up their first loss of the season, 120-117 to the Boston Celtics on Tuesday night. “It’s definitely a measuring stick,” said Mitchell, who scored 18 points in the fourth quarter, including 14 straight Cleveland points in the final four minutes. You want to see where you’re at, but not hold too much weight on it. ... We’re not going to be the same team now that we are in April."" The Celtics won an unprecedented 18th championship last spring -- rolling over the Cavaliers in five games in the Eastern Conference semis – and entered the season as the favorites to repeat, or at least make it back to the NBA Finals. Cleveland, which won a playoff series last year for the first time since LeBron James left the second time in 2018, wasn’t expected to be a contender. But it was the Cavaliers who shot to the top of the standings this fall, with a franchise-record 15-game winning streak that left them as the last unbeaten team in the league. Coach Kenny Atkinson was the first NBA coach ever to win his first 15 games with a new team. “You want to be a part of history in that regard. But it’s a thing of the past. It’s over with. And, you know, it was a good run,” Mitchell said. “It was fun. When you’re playing basketball, good basketball, and obviously winning games -- whether it’s blowouts, close games, come-from-behind wins -- you enjoy these moments.  “It’s great to be part of history. We wish we had kept it going,” he said. ""But, like I said, there’s no championships in November.” The Celtics used a 3-point barrage on Tuesday night to open a 21-point lead, then watched as the Cavs cut it to two in the third quarter. Cleveland trailed by nine, 114-105, with 90 seconds left before Mitchell hit a floater and then another layup to cut the deficit to five points.  With Boston up 117-110 and 25 seconds left, Mitchell hit a rainbow 3-pointer to make it a four-point game. After Jayson Tatum, who scored 33, hit one of two free throws, the Celtics star bowled Mitchell over while going for a steal. Mitchell stayed down on the court for a few minutes, but the play was not reviewed to determine if it was a potential flagrant foul that would give the Cavaliers a pair of free throws and the ball. ""I was just praying to God I didn’t have a concussion. That’s my only thing,” said Mitchell, who watched the play again after the game and didn’t think it should have been ruled a flagrant foul. “It was a play on the ball. He’s got bony shoulders. So I hit his shoulder, and it is what it is.” Atkinson blamed himself for not having an answer for a Celtics team that went 14 for 22 from 3-point range in the first half to open a 17-point lead. And he praised his team, which faced the Celtics without Issac Okoro (ankle), Caris LeVert (knee) and DeanWade (ankle), for erasing almost all of that deficit in the third quarter.  ""They shot the heck out of it,"" Atkinson said. “That big second quarter, that was too much to overcome. Second half, we turned it up, but it’s kind of too late.” And the coach was already looking to their next matchup, in Cleveland on Dec. 1. “They’re so good. We gave resistance in the second half, but ... a lot of stuff we can improve on,” he said. “We’ll have another shot at them soon."" ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

The league divided the players into six pods of wings, guards and forwards. The six coaches then put the names on a board and drafted teams with the main idea being that the squads would be as equal as possible. The twist was that none of the coaches knew which team they would be coaching until after the squads for the 3-on-3 league were made. Co-founders Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier are on different teams. Stewart's squad includes former Seattle Storm teammate Jewell Loyd as well as current New York Liberty one Courtney Vandersloot.

The league has only announced 34 of the 36 players on the team, allowing for two more player signings. Unrivaled has been in talks with WNBA Rookie of the Year Caitlin Clark. The other team with a wild card is Phantom. Jackie Young, Marina Mabrey, Tiffany Hayes, Satou Sabally and Brittney Griner are the other five members of that squad. Team Vinyl consists of Arike Ogunbowale, Rhyne Howard, Jordin Canada, Rae Burrell, Dearica Hamby and Aliyah Boston. Team Rose has Chelsea Gray, Kahleah Copper, Brittney Sykes, Lexie Hull, Angel Reese and Azura Stevens. Team Laces has Kelsey Plum, Courtney Williams Kayla McBride, Kate Martin, Alyssa Thomas and Stefanie Dolson. The games will begin on Jan. 17 and be played in Miami. The total salary pool for the 36 players is more than $8 million, with players receiving equity in the league.

ABC News: Sports,"Capitals put Alex Ovechkin on injured reserve, ruling him out at least a week",https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/capitals-put-alex-ovechkin-injured-reserve-ruling-week-116048575,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 14:58:19 -0500",The Washington Capitals put Alex Ovechkin on injured reserve and recalled fellow Russian winger Ivan Miroshnichenko from the minors,"The Washington Capitals put Alex Ovechkin on injured reserve and recalled fellow Russian winger Ivan Miroshnichenko from the minors ARLINGTON, Va. -- Alex Ovechkin is on injured reserve, and the Washington Capitals are coming to grips with playing without their superstar captain for the coming weeks. Ovechkin is considered week-to-week with a lower left leg injury, and going on IR rules him out for at least the next three games. The absence puts a pause on his pursuit of Wayne Gretzky's NHL career goals record and takes the best pure scorer of this generation off the ice until further notice. “He’s the hottest guy in the league, and he’s chasing something bigger than hockey,” longtime teammate Tom Wilson said after practice Wednesday. “I think everyone in the hockey world just feels that bit of letdown, that emotion that you’re just pulling for him and he’s putting everything he has into it. He feels all that pressure. The whole world of hockey is just rooting him on. So, to come in (to the locker room) and see that he was hurt, it hurt a little bit as a teammate, but at the end of the day, that’s hockey.” Ovechkin was injured in a shin-on-shin collision with Utah's Jack McBain on Monday night. The 39-year-old winger went down in obvious pain, then tried to skate and test out the leg minutes later before limping down the tunnel. Coach Spencer Carbery confirmed it was not a season-ending injury and expects a more specific diagnosis and timeframe to be available Thursday after further evaluation by doctors. Carbery described Ovechkin's initial reaction as “bummed,"" while veteran defenseman John Carlson said Ovechkin was handling it “like a human being,” with plenty of emotions attached. Even Washington's next opponent isn't thrilled. “You never want to see players go down,” said Colorado coach Jared Bednar, whose Avalanche face the Capitals on Thursday night for their second of two meetings over the past week. ""But then you put in a situation like Ovi where he’s chasing greatness, and you want to see him healthy and be able to pursue that: a great start to the season, even getting to the night that he got hurt. Hopefully it’s not long and that he’s able to get back. Injuries are part of it. I think everyone has to deal with them, but I’d certainly like to see him get healthy and continue to pursue that goal.” Ovechkin scored 15 goals in his first 18 games this season to take the league lead and move 27 back of passing Gretzky. Before the injury, he was on pace to break the record sometime in February. That likely will have to wait until the spring or perhaps early next season after this injury, which could lead to Ovechkin's longest absence of his two-decade NHL career. He has missed just 59 games total and only 35 because of injury since debuting in 2005. “I was having a little deja vu about just being in the locker room before we go on the ice and — almost every time — he’s there,” Carlson said. ""There’s minutes to be played and goals to be scored.” The Capitals put Ovechkin on IR and injured winger Sonny Milano on long-term IR with an undisclosed upper-body injury and recalled young Russian winger Ivan Miroshnichenko from Hershey of the American Hockey League. Carbery does not want Miroshnichenko to think he has to fill in for Ovechkin and is still deciding how to proceed with the lineup moving forward. One possibility on the top line is Jakub Vrana, who along with Ovechkin, Wilson, Carlson and recent trade reacquisition Lars Eller is among the few players remaining from the 2018 Stanley Cup championship team. But it will take more than one player to make up for Ovechkin being out for however long. “We’re going to face the reality,” Vrana said. “Obviously, it’s hard. He’s our captain and everything. But at the same time, it is what it is. And we’re going to prepare on winning games without him.” ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

The game was tied at 95 with 8:46 left, but LaVine had nine points in a 13-2 run that put the Bulls up by 11 with 5:45 to go. He hit six 3-pointers in the quarter after a slow start. Nikola Vucevic led the Bulls with 29 points and 12 rebounds while Coby White scored 25. Cade Cunningham had 26 points and 10 assists for the Pistons and Malik Beasley added 21. Bulls: LaVine has traditionally given the Pistons a hard time, averaging 21.7 points in 28 career games, including a 51-point game last season. They held him to seven points on 3-for-11 shooting, including 1 for 6 on 3-pointers, in the first three quarters. He came back into the game with 8:46 left and hit five of his first six shots, all 3-pointers. Pistons: Detroit kept the game close for the first 40 minutes, but lost too many Bulls shooters on the perimeter. Chicago shot 23-46 (50%) on 3-pointers, including 7-15 (47%) in the fourth quarter. Detroit was trailing 80-75 in the third when they got distracted by not getting a call on defense. Before they regained focus, Josh Giddey tipped in a missed shot, LaVine threw down an uncontested dunk and Vucevic hit a 3-pointer to make it 87-75. The Pistons had 16 offensive rebounds to Chicago's 10 and only committed nine turnovers, but they only hit 34% of their 3-pointers while the Bulls were making half of theirs.

The Capitals said Tuesday that Ovechkin would be evaluated further by doctors when they return home from their road trip. He was injured in a shin-on-shin collision with Jack McBain. Ovechkin scored twice before leaving the game in Salt Lake City on Monday night to give him a league-best 15 goals in 18 games this season. He’s at 868 — 27 goals away from passing Gretzky. There was immediate concern about Ovechkin when he left the game 5:30 into the third period. The 39-year-old took a brief twirl to test it before realizing he couldn’t put much weight on his left leg and limping down the tunnel to the locker room. He did not return. Coach Spencer Carbery said only that Washington's longtime captain was being evaluated after the game. Ovechkin over two decades in the NHL has been known for his durability, which has allowed him to score at a pace unlike any other player in history. The Russian winger has only missed 35 games because of injury. Until the injury, Ovechkin was on pace to break the record sometime in February. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
ABC News: Sports,New era of college football could help other teams replicate Indiana's remarkable rise,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/new-era-college-football-teams-replicate-indianas-remarkable-116014030,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024 14:42:16 -0500",Indiana has made the type of turnaround that had only happened once before at the power-conference level over the last decade,"Indiana has made the type of turnaround that had only happened once before at the power-conference level over the last decade Indiana has made the type of turnaround that had only happened once before at the power-conference level over the last decade. But this new era of college football with unbalanced schedules and loosened transfer restrictions might make such dramatic transformations more common. “I think any P4 school with the proper commitment is capable of being successful and being ultimately successful because really the difference between victory and defeat in most of these games is very slight, slim,” Indiana coach Curt Cignetti said. “It’s all attainable.” Cignetti just agreed to terms on an eight-year contract as No. 5 Indiana prepares for arguably the biggest game in program history, a showdown Saturday at No. 2 Ohio State. Cignetti’s new deal gives him an annual salary of $8 million plus a $1 million annual retention bonus. He earned that raise when Indiana won its first 10 games this season after going 3-9 the year before his arrival. “What he’s done is utterly amazing,” said Jimbo Fisher, the former Florida State and Texas A&M coach who now hosts a show on SiriusXM Radio. “I think it’s the best job in college football right now. I think he’s national coach of the year.” If the pandemic-shortened 2020 season is taken out of consideration, Indiana is the 21st team since 1973 to win at least 10 games immediately after a season in which it had three wins or fewer, according to Sportradar. Indiana is the first Power Four team to accomplish this since Michigan State went 10-3 in 2017 after going 3-9 in 2016. The last Power Four program to do it before Michigan State was Auburn, which was 3-9 in 2012 but went 12-1 and reached the BCS championship game in 2013. Indiana’s emergence has come in a season featuring many other dramatic rises and falls, whether it’s Vanderbilt going from 2-10 in 2023 to beating Alabama and becoming bowl eligible this year, or Florida State winning just one game thus far after posting an undefeated regular-season record a year ago. That lends credence to the notion that the loosening of transfer restrictions and the emergence of unbalanced schedules in super-sized conferences could enable other programs to replicate Indiana’s rapid rebuild. “I do think it’s more conducive to happening, yes,” Fisher said. Now that players don’t have to sit out a season after switching schools — resulting in exponentially more transfers — teams can reshape their rosters every year. Indiana opened the season with 27 transfer newcomers and had just 36 returning scholarship players. The only Football Bowl Subdivision teams with fewer returning scholarship players were North Texas and Colorado, with 31 each. “They just did a really good job of bringing in the right guys, bringing in the right people,” said Michigan coach Sherrone Moore, whose team lost at Indiana 20-15 on Nov. 9. The fortunes of teams from year to year also can change depending on their conference schedules. The Big Ten has 18 teams playing nine conference games and the Southeastern Conference has 16 teams with an eight-game conference schedule. That means some teams will have much tougher or easier schedules than their conference foes. Only one of the 10 teams Indiana has beaten owns a winning record: Washington (6-5). “I do think it will be that way because there are chances you’re going to have years where you get to roll through a schedule that might not be the trickiest,” said Dan Mullen, a former Florida and Mississippi State coach now working as an analyst for ESPN. Mullen also noted that sometimes you don’t know how favorable a schedule might be until the end of the season. For instance, Indiana played Michigan and Washington, the two participants in last year’s College Football Playoff championship game. Both are struggling to finish above .500 this year. While the transfer portal and the unbalanced schedules could make it easier for teams to rebuild on the fly, Indiana’s rise included some unique elements. After Cignetti left James Madison for Indiana, 13 players from his former school joined him. Those former James Madison players already were familiar with Cignetti’s approach and assisted Indiana’s holdovers in adapting to it. That made for an easier transition than if all of Indiana’s transfers had come from a variety of other programs. “That whole JMU crew that came over really facilitated the culture change here, and they’re all major contributors for the most part,” Cignetti said. “Between the white lines and on defense you’ve got some real key guys playing at a high level. I think that familiarity with the program, the defense, the offense, the special teams has been extremely beneficial.” Big Ten Network analyst Gerry DiNardo wonders if Indiana’s success might cause another Power Four program making a coaching change to try something similar by hiring a successful Group of Five coach who could bring along players from his former school. “That is a new model,” DiNardo said. “And that new model obviously is working, and that new model obviously could work again.” The help Indiana got from the transfer portal and its favorable schedule shouldn’t diminish what the Hoosiers have accomplished. Revitalizing a program remains challenging even in this era. Just ask Nebraska and Wisconsin, two of Indiana’s Big Ten rivals. Both programs have much greater football traditions than Indiana, which had never won as many as 10 games in a season before this year. Nebraska’s Matt Rhule and Wisconsin’s Luke Fickell — both in their second years — had higher profiles than Cignetti had upon his arrival at Indiana. Yet the Cornhuskers and Badgers are at .500 heading into their Saturday matchup and recently made offensive coordinator changes. DiNardo understands the enormity of Indiana’s accomplishment better than most. He posted an 8-27 record as Indiana’s coach from 2002-04 and knows the challenges of winning there. He credits athletic director Scott Dolson for bucking the trend of hiring an up-and-coming offensive coordinator and instead choosing the 63-year-old Cignetti, who had a proven record of head coaching success at smaller programs. “Scott Dolson, he deserves a lot of credit for this decision,” DiNardo said last week, before Cignetti got his new deal. “And I think he will continue to support the football coach at a high level, more than previous athletic directors have. It’s not just a one-year deal for Scott. He will give the football coach what he needs to be successful. That wasn’t always true. It was always true that the AD would give the basketball coach what they need to be successful. I think Scott will do both.” ___ AP Sports Writers Larry Lage and Michael Marot contributed to this report. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

Assistant Joe Sacco, who led the Colorado Avalanche to a 130-134-40 record from 2009-2014 and was a finalist for coach of the year in his first season, will lead the Bruins on an interim basis. “I believe Joe Sacco has the coaching experience to bring the players and the team back to focusing on the consistent effort the NHL requires to have success,” Sweeney said. ""We will continue to work to make the necessary adjustments to meet the standard and performance our supportive fans expect.” Montgomery, 55, was fired 20 games into his third season in Boston and a day after a 5-1 loss to Columbus in which the Bruins allowed two short-handed goals. He leaves with a 8-9-3 record this season and a 180-84-33 mark in his career, which also included one-plus season in Dallas. The Bruins finished with more than 100 points in each of Montgomery's first two seasons — including a record-setting debut, when their 65 wins and 135 points were both the most in NHL history. But the team lost in the first round of the playoffs that year and advanced to only the second round last season. The struggles carried over into the new season, with an opening night loss to Florida in which they fell behind 5-1 and an 8-2 loss to Carolina on Halloween. After the Monday night loss in which the team was booed off the ice at home after falling behind 3-0 in the first period, Montgomery grew philosophical. “Everyone goes through struggles. Whether in life, or your team,” he said. “That’s what life’s about. How do you pick yourself up? It’s not how hard you fall. It’s how quickly you pick yourself up.” The Bruins’ best hope is that a coaching change kick-starts a roster with high-end talent that hasn’t been performing. As a team, the Bruins have given up 21 more goals than they’ve allowed — third-worst in the NHL. All-Star David Pastrnak managed no shots on Monday and his minus-4 is the lowest plus-minus of his career; Brad Marchand is minus-3, the lowest since he became a full-time NHLer. “Definitely not happy with the way that things are going,” Marchand said Monday night. “We need to be much better in a lot of areas. ... It’s not acceptable to continue to have the same mistakes and do the same things over and over that aren’t bringing us success. So, yeah, we need to be a lot better.” But the biggest problem has been the goaltending. And that can’t be blamed on the coach. A year after alternating two No. 1 goalies for the entire regular season — and finishing with more than 100 points for the sixth full season in a row — the Bruins came out of training camp with none. General manager Don Sweeney traded 2023 Vezina Trophy winner Linus Ullmark over the summer — before agreeing to a new contract with Jeremy Swayman. The timing emboldened Swayman’s holdout, and the 25-year-old from Alaska didn’t agree to a new deal — eight years and $66 million — until the eve of the regular season. His numbers (5-7 record, .884 save percentage, 3.47 goals-against average) may be the hangover from missing training camp; Jonas Korpisalo (3-2, .901, 2.74), who was acquired from Ottawa over the summer, hasn’t been the answer either. “I think I’ve had enough time now to adapt and get back to things,” Swayman said Monday night. “I’m really trying to to engulf just being in a room again and being a leader and I want my play to speak for that. So I need to step up, and that’s exactly what I’m going to do.” A genial hockey lifer who led Maine to the 1993 NCAA title — scoring a third-period hat trick in the final — Montgomery played in 122 NHL games over six years before he turned to coaching. He won two U.S. junior titles and led Denver to an NCAA championship before he was hired by the Dallas Stars. In his first season on the bench, Dallas made the playoffs for the first time in three years. In his second, the team would reach the Stanley Cup Final but with a new coach. Montgomery was fired 32 games into the year for what the team called unprofessional conduct. He has since admitted to binge drinking to the point of blackouts and conceded that he deserved to be fired. After going through rehab, he was hired as an assistant in St. Louis and then for the head coaching job with the Bruins. In Boston, Montgomery replaced Bruce Cassidy — another likeable Bruins coach whose teams racked up 100-point seasons but flamed out in the postseason. Cassidy was fired three years after leading Boston to the 2019 Stanley Cup Final and hired by Vegas eight days after the Bruins fired him. The Golden Knights won the Stanley Cup in his first season. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
ABC News: Sports,"Rafael Nadal heads into retirement after a career marked by big trophies, rivalries and injuries",https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/rafael-nadal-heads-retirement-after-career-marked-big-116029152,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024 18:27:00 -0500",Rafael Nadal is heading into retirement after Spain was eliminated from the Davis Cup,"Rafael Nadal is heading into retirement after Spain was eliminated from the Davis Cup MALAGA, Spain -- Rafael Nadal's remarkable tennis career came to end on Tuesday and he heads into retirement after Spain lost to the Netherlands in the quarterfinals at the Davis Cup Final 8.  The 38-year-old Nadal played on tour for more than two decades and collected 22 Grand Slam titles, including 14 on his favorite clay at the French Open, and 92 singles titles overall. He reached No. 1 in the ATP rankings and spent the longest consecutive span in the top 10 in history — nearly 18 full years — until playing sparingly the past two seasons because of several injuries. Nadal forever will be remembered as a member of the Big Three of men’s tennis, along with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic.  Here is a year-by-year look back at the victories, losses, rivalries and injuries that marked Nadal's career: Nadal gave it one last go, but he missed three of the four Grand Slam tournaments and went just 12-8 in singles. He got a tough draw at his beloved French Open and lost in the first round to eventual runner-up Alexander Zverev. At the Paris Olympics, contested at Roland Garros, Nadal was eliminated by Djokovic in the second round of singles, then bowed out in the doubles quarterfinals alongside Carlos Alcaraz. On Oct. 10, Nadal announced that his last professional appearance would be at the Davis Cup, representing Spain at home in Malaga. On Tuesday, Nadal played his final match, losing 6-4, 6-4 to Botic van de Zandschulp of the Netherlands.  Nadal lost in the second round of the Australian Open to Mackie McDonald while dealing with a left hip flexor injury. It was Nadal’s earliest Grand Slam loss in seven years. He didn’t play the rest of the year and had hip surgery in June. Nadal briefly moved into sole possession of the record for most Grand Slam singles titles, breaking a tie with Federer, by claiming No. 21 at the Australian Open, coming back to beat Daniil Medvedev after dropping the first two sets of the final. Nadal then got No. 22 (Djokovic eventually would pass him and is currently at 24) at the French Open, where he overcame debilitating pain in his left foot with nerve-numbing injections to lift the trophy for the 14th time by beating Casper Ruud in the final. That improved Nadal’s career record there to 112-3. He pulled out of Wimbledon before the semifinals because of torn abdominal muscle, then lost in the U.S. Open’s fourth round to Frances Tiafoe. Blew a two-set lead against Stefanos Tsitsipas in the Australian Open quarterfinals, then lost to Djokovic in the French Open semifinals. Played only two matches the rest of the year because of chronic pain in his left foot. Pulled even with Federer with 20 Slam trophies with a 13th title at the French Open, defeating Djokovic in the final. Won multiple titles in a season for 16th consecutive year. French Open title No. 12 and U.S. Open title No. 4 arrived, as did a return to No. 1 at age 33. Lost to Djokovic in the Australian Open final and to Federer in the Wimbledon semifinals. Was troubled by thigh, knee, left hand and abdominal problems at various points. Won an 11th championship at Roland Garros. Stopped playing two Grand Slam matches elsewhere because of injuries and skipped other tournaments with knee, hip and abdominal issues. After losing the Australian Open final in five sets to Federer, Nadal returned to dominance at the French Open, dropping just 35 games through seven matches en route to a 10th title there, beating Stan Wawrinka in the final. Added a third U.S. Open trophy — his 16th major overall, moving within one of Federer — and finished at No. 1 in the rankings for the fourth time. For first time since 2004, Nadal did not reach any Grand Slam quarterfinals. He lost in the Australian Open’s first round and withdrew from the French Open before third round because of an injured left wrist and was out of action for months. He lost to Djokovic in the French Open quarterfinals and bowed out at that stage or earlier at the other three majors, too, ending a 10-year run with at least one Grand Slam trophy. Nadal pulled even with Pete Sampras at 14 Slam titles by adding French Open No. 9, beating Djokovic in the final. Lost to 144th-ranked Nick Kyrgios in the fourth round at Wimbledon, then missed three months with a bad right wrist. After returning, Nadal sat out two events because of appendicitis. After seven months off the tour because of his left knee and a stomach virus, Nadal put together a 10-title season that returned him to No. 1. Won an eighth French Open title (beating current Spanish Davis Cup captain David Ferrer in the final) and second U.S. Open title (beating Djokovic in the final), raising his Grand Slam total to 13, trailing only Sampras and Federer (17) at the time. Beat Djokovic for a seventh French Open title. At Wimbledon, lost to Lukas Rosol in the second round while hampered by a left knee problem that sidelined him the rest of the season. Hurt a left leg muscle at the Australian Open, but was fine by the French Open and tied Bjorn Borg’s career mark for men with a sixth championship, beating Federer in the final. Nadal lost seven of 10 finals that season, with six of those setbacks against Djokovic, including at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. Stopped during his Australian Open quarterfinal because of an injured right knee, but returned to top form at the French Open: He won his fifth title in Paris and didn’t drop a set, beating Robin Soderling in the final. Won Wimbledon for the second time, then completed a career Grand Slam by beating Djokovic in the U.S. Open final. Finished the year ranked No. 1. Won his first Australian Open title, defeating Federer in a five-set final, after getting past Fernando Verdasco in a five-set semifinal. Nadal’s 31-match unbeaten run at the French Open ended with a fourth-round loss to Soderling. Nadal was troubled by knee tendinitis and sat out Wimbledon. Dealing with an abdominal issue, he reached the U.S. Open semifinals before losing to champion Juan Martin del Potro. Topped Federer in the Roland Garros final to collect a fourth consecutive trophy there, making Nadal the first man since Borg in 1978-81 with that long a streak in Paris — and first since Borg to win the title without dropping a set. Again played Federer in the final at the All England Club, but this time Nadal won 9-7 in the fifth set in fading light. Also won a singles gold medal at the Beijing Olympics and ended the year ranked No. 1, despite dealing with tendinitis in his right knee. A third consecutive French Open title came via another victory over Federer — and then Federer beat him in Wimbledon’s final. Nadal’s clay winning streak reached 81 matches before a loss to Federer in Hamburg, Germany. Earned a second French Open title, beating Federer in the final there before losing to him in Wimbledon’s final. Stretched his clay-court winning streak to a record 62 matches. Won the title in his French Open debut; his 11 trophies for the year were most in a season for a teenager in ATP history. Moved into the top 10 in April and remained there until March 2023. Finished 2005 ranked No. 2. Beat then-No. 1 Federer in Miami. Won his first ATP title in Sopot, Poland, on clay. Defeated Andy Roddick to help Spain top the United States and win the Davis Cup. Reached the third round in his Wimbledon debut at 17, the youngest man to get that far at the All England Club since Boris Becker was 16 in 1984. At 15 years, 10 months, he earned first ATP match win in his hometown of Mallorca. ___ Howard Fendrich has been the AP’s tennis writer since 2002.

NYT > Sports,Meet the Accidental High School Football Superstar Who Just Started Playing,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5932070/2024/11/20/recruiting-tobi-haastrup-oregon-michigan/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 22:11:21 +0000","On Aug. 30, Tobi Haastrup apppeared in his first football game. Within a week, he had more than a dozen college scholarship offers.","NCAAF Tobi Haastrup had no idea what to do. The 17-year-old had never lined up in a defensive stance before. He wasn’t sure what it meant to jump offsides and had never heard of a tackle for loss. Come to think of it, he didn’t exactly know what downs were, either, or how they worked. But here he was, working out last summer with the Mayde Creek High football team in Houston. Advertisement “Everything was new to me,” said Haastrup, born and raised in England. But who needs to know the rules when you are 6 feet 4 and 235 pounds and run a 10.7-second 100-meter dash? Mayde Creek defensive line coach Dechristeon Wilson, also the school’s assistant track coach, urged Haastrup to try football heading into his senior year. At best, Haastrup would take to the sport. At worst, he’d leave high school with no regrets. “Little did I know,” Haastrup said. On Aug. 30, he played in his first-ever football game and finished with five sacks and about three offsides penalties. Within a week, more than a dozen FBS schools, including Ole Miss, LSU, Tennessee and Texas A&M, reached out with scholarship offers. Three months later, Haastrup is up to 23 offers and is one of the most coveted uncommitted Class of 2025 prospects leading up to the early signing period next month. The accidental superstar who never attended a summer camp or took an official visit before this fall is ranked No. 279 nationally in the 247Sports Composite. With official visits to Boston College, Missouri, Vanderbilt, Florida State, Texas Tech and, most recently, USC already in the books, Haastrup has two final stops on what has become a hectic college tour. He will be at Michigan this week and Oregon next week ahead of a Dec. 2 decision and Dec. 4 signing. And to think, three months ago, he knew nothing of the Big Ten or SEC. “It’s overwhelming at times,” he said. “But I thank God each and every day for the experiences.” Haastrup was born in England and spent the first nine years of his life in Southeast London, where he didn’t follow American football in any capacity. The family moved to the Sacramento, Calif., area in 2016 and then, three years later, relocated to Houston, where Tobi, the youngest of three children, started to come into his own as a sprinter and shot-putter. Advertisement But he never thought much about football. That changed this past summer. Mike Arogbonlo was hired as Mayde Creek’s head coach in May after a stint as the quarterbacks coach at Texas powerhouse Duncanville High. A few of his new assistant coaches wasted little time in filling him in on priority No. 1. “The first thing I was told by the coaching staff was (how big it would be) if I could get this kid to come out that looks great, is fast — he’s a great athlete,” Arogbonlo said of Haastrup. “I said, ‘OK.’ And I went and found him, and we started talking.” Haastrup and Arogbonlo hit it off quickly, bonding over their families’ Nigerian roots. There was an innocence to Haastrup that Arogbonlo appreciated, having spent time around arrogant five-stars at his previous stops. More than anything, Haastrup was willing to learn and had no problem acknowledging what he didn’t know. “It just kind of takes you back to the basics,” Arogbonlo said. “There were a lot of questions that he had: ‘What’s a first down? Where’s the down marker? What’s a defensive end, and what’s the difference between a defensive end and an outside linebacker?’ He didn’t know any of those things. But he’s been like a sponge, just soaking in whatever he can.” Wilson realized the Mayde Creek coaches needed to simplify the game for Haastrup as much as possible. He decided to relate football to track whenever he could. Exploding out of a D-lineman’s stance was just like springing out of track blocks. The same speed Haastrup used in races would be what got him to the quarterback, too. The only difference was Haastrup would need to learn to run around a curve instead of down a straightaway, which Wilson prepared him for with various figure-eight drills in practice. The duo worked on ghost moves, bull rushing and other basic pass-rushing techniques, with Wilson letting Haastrup pick his favorites come game time. Advertisement “With him, it was like, ‘Oh, I’ve gotta take it back — way back,’” Wilson said. “Like I’m teaching younger and younger kids. Like I’m teaching my nephew or someone. But I love that because it was like a blank canvas.” When the season rolled around, Haastrup’s biggest issue was lining up offsides. He’d be so focused on his pass-rush technique that he forgot the basics and kept picking up 5-yard penalties. “All I knew was, ‘Get down and just see ball, get ball,’” he said. But as time progressed, Haastrup started to get more comfortable. By midseason, he settled in and didn’t need to look to the sideline as much for guidance. Through film study, he was able to pick up how opposing offensive linemen set their feet and eventually developed countermoves he could utilize. Mayde Creek went just 5-5 this season, but Haastrup finished with 20 tackles for loss and nine sacks, playing at the Class 6A level of Texas high school football. “A couple of (colleges) were wary,” Arogbonlo said. “They wanted to see him play two or three games (before offering). “The main question was always, ‘Is he 6-3 or 6-4?’ And I would tell coaches, ‘I don’t care what he is. He’s a 10.7 100-meter runner at 240 pounds. This is a no-miss (prospect) because at worst he’s playing special teams.’” Arogbonlo said he fields a call or two from a college coach every day about Haastrup, who is starting to get a feel for which programs are historically the most successful and which conferences are the most competitive. Wilson, the school’s recruiting coordinator, has helped guide Haastrup through the process, encouraging him to trust his instincts. Haastrup’s coaches believe his decision will go down to the wire. Academics are important to Haastrup, who eventually wants to attend medical school and become an orthopedic surgeon. His 19-year-old sister is studying neuroscience at Texas A&M. Advertisement Development will be a major part of the decision, too. “Because I’m still so new to the sport,” he said, “it’s definitely going to be one of the most important decisions I make in my life.” In a college football world in which prospects are often first identified in eighth or ninth grade, Haastrup’s story is rare. “Football can take you places you never thought you would go,” Wilson said. In Haastrup’s case, he’s just getting started. “(Whoever gets him), they’re getting a kid with a lot of upside,” Arogbonlo said. “I suspect with more time, with nutrition, with the training table on the next level, with the coaching staffs, I just expect a huge growth. I really believe he’s a Sunday player. That’s the kind of kid I think he is. “If God could make a football player, he made Tobi.” (Photo courtesy of Jimmie Aggison / The Houston Defender) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,"Rafael Nadal Is the King of Clay, but He’s So Much More Than That",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5934648/2024/11/20/rafael-nadal-retires-tennis-career-legacy/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 22:11:21 +0000","Nadal possessed shotmaking talent, tennis IQ, finesse and flair too often lost in the brick-red dust, a columnist for The Athletic writes.","Tennis Rafael Nadal retired from tennis on Tuesday night. He won 22 Grand Slam titles in 23 years across all three tennis surfaces, with an Olympic gold medal and 92 ATP titles in all. He was most dominant on clay, winning 63 percent of his titles on the surface and compiling an 81-match win streak between April 2005 and May 2007, which remains the longest single-surface streak in the Open era of men’s tennis. Advertisement He also spent his entire career battling his own body, with Nadal’s injuries both acute and chronic carving the trajectory of his career and to an extent the way he played tennis. King of clay. Warrior. Spanish bull. Nadal embodied all these things, and tributes written so are not ill-fitting. But describing Nadal only in such terms does one of the greatest men’s tennis players of all time a catastrophic disservice. A tennis player in constant evolution, Nadal — and his rivalries with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic that constituted the ‘Big Three’ era — refigured the sport. Nadal possessed shotmaking talent, tennis IQ, finesse and flair too often lost in the brick-red dust. The world tends to define athletes and sometimes people in general in absolute terms. It’s a way of making sense of complex personalities and performers — whittling them down to a single characteristic like a superhero. It also creates easy archetypes for comparison: in Nadal’s case, he was the ferocious physicality to Federer’s effortless elegance and Djokovic’s rubber-limbed flexibility. All three suffered for their superheroism. Federer was so aesthetically pleasing that his supreme fitness and remarkable defensive abilities were glossed over. Djokovic was cast as reactive, which doesn’t do justice to his point construction or his extra gear in pressure moments (the all-or-nothing cross-court forehand against Federer in the semifinal of the 2011 U.S. Open just one example of many). Djokovic’s three French Open titles barely register because of the 10 he has won in Melbourne, and who cares about a hat-trick of wins when your biggest rival has won 11 more times? Well, as so many players told The Athletic in June, Djokovic is very possibly the second-best male player on clay of all time. Nadal still suffered most for his greatness on one surface. He was perhaps the second-most complete male baseliner to ever play the sport after Djokovic, with an all-round game good enough to deliver four U.S. Opens (tied with Djokovic and just one shy of the Open-era record held by Federer, Pete Sampras and Jimmy Connors), and two Wimbledons from five final appearances at the All England Club. As he evolved his game to meet his body’s limitations and started to shorten points more concertedly, he become one of the best volleyers on the ATP Tour. Subtract Nadal’s 14 Roland Garros titles and his eight remaining majors give him more than tennis legends like John McEnroe and Boris Becker, and tie him with Andre Agassi, Connors and Ivan Lendl. It’s true that some surface homogenization in the early 2000s helped him do more than his clay-court specialist compatriots like Sergi Bruguera, Carlos Moya, Albert Costa and Juan Carlos Ferrero — who all won the French Open but not a major more — but Nadal’s mastery of every surface came from the way he reconfigured tennis itself alongside Djokovic and to an important but lesser extent Federer. Advertisement Nadal changed the sport in myriad ways. His shotmaking ability, on the slide and on the run, and the unseen revs and kick of his forehand helped redefine the mechanics of tennis (as with the surfaces changing, equipment changing helped too). Even that shot, which he splintered beautifully into the inside-out thrash, the banana whip, the cross-court hook and so many more variations, is normally figured in terms of brute force as opposed to David Foster Wallace’s “liquid whip” description of Federer’s own devastating groundstroke. Rafael Nadal retires from tennis Nadal’s initially belittled deep return position neutralized opponents with bigger serves. It allowed him to start rallies where he could be favorite while knowing that his opponents would do little to counter it. That position, which Dominic Thiem also adopted early, has now become fundamental to men’s tennis. What all these evolutions have in common is movement, and that is where Nadal remade tennis most of all alongside Djokovic. The return strategy, the baseline missiles launched with margin and the deftness in the forecourt were underpinned by staggering court coverage, whether running round his backhand time and again or sliding a lost position into a winning one, transposing clay-court movement onto new surfaces. While Djokovic was and remains the true master of sliding, it was the collective strength of their innovations tipped the scales away from servers, and forced up-and-coming players who ran into them to not just dominate on serve, but scramble and rally too. Daniil Medvedev is perhaps the most direct descendant by force. That’s before considering how the Nadal-Djokovic-Federer-Andy Murray nexus, who contested so many semifinals and finals, made each other better while making everybody else look worse. None of this means that Nadal is as naturally talented as Federer nor as elastic as Djokovic. Nadal himself felt Federer was more blessed. His team agreed: his uncle and first coach Toni said in an interview by phone this week that Nadal “had a very good volley, but not a nice volley like Federer”. Nadal was king of clay. His power and will to win were hard to ignore. But to watch Nadal finding seemingly impossible angles or leaning into his backhands mid-match was to see a master of his craft at work. A fighter yes, but a genius too. (Top photo: Quinn Rooney / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,The Sudden Fall of the N.F.L.’s Best Kicker,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5933377/2024/11/20/ravens-justin-tucker-kicker-concerns/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 22:11:21 +0000","Justin Tucker has been the gold standard at his position for years. Now he’s one of the reasons Baltimore is losing games, a columnist for The Athletic writes.","NFL Citing a lack of consistency in the kicking game, Baltimore Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome announced that the team was releasing young kicker Stephen Hauschka, who hours earlier missed a 36-yard attempt against the Cleveland Browns on “Monday Night Football.” Hauschka was just 9-of-13 on field goal attempts through nine games, and all of his misses were from under 50 yards. The Ravens replaced him by signing free agent Billy Cundiff, who was working at a venture capital firm at the time. Advertisement That transaction occurred in November 2009. That’s the last time the Ravens made an in-season, performance-based change at typically one of the most volatile positions in the sport. Ravens coach John Harbaugh made clear Monday that he has no plans on making another one, even as his longtime kicker, Justin Tucker, is mired in the most difficult stretch of his 13-year career. “There’s no thought to that,” Harbaugh said. “You have to find that competition first if you’re going to be blunt about it. Where is that competition? That would be one thing. The best option right now is to get Justin back on point, because he’s fully capable of doing it. (We) certainly haven’t lost any confidence in Justin Tucker.” Harbaugh’s comments came a day after Tucker missed two kicks in an 18-16 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers at Acrisure Stadium. After entering the season as the most statistically accurate kicker in NFL history, Tucker has missed 6 of 22 attempts this year, along with a point-after try. Two of the misses came from inside 50 yards, where Tucker had made 90 percent of his kicks over his first 12 NFL seasons. His extra-point miss was just the seventh of his career. GO DEEPER 'They’ve had our number': Ravens again unable to overcome themselves in loss to Steelers “It’s certainly frustrating, especially when we know that these games come down to the wire, like this one did, that I let a couple get away,” Tucker said after Sunday’s game. “But, like I’ve said before, the only thing that we can do is just get right back to work and focus on making the most out of our next opportunity.” Considered one of the most unique weapons in the league for over a decade and the Ravens’ most reliable performer since he entered the league in 2012, Tucker — and by extension, the team’s field goal operation — has suddenly become one of the reasons Baltimore is losing games. It’s harsh and it feels uncomfortable to say or write about a guy who has been the gold standard in the sport at his position for many years, but the numbers are hard to ignore. The Ravens’ four losses have come by a total of 17 points, and Tucker missed a field goal in each of them that factored prominently in the defeats. Advertisement Tucker “needs to make kicks,” Harbaugh said after Sunday’s frustrating loss in Pittsburgh. “He knows that. He makes them in practice, and he made the long one (54-yarder) later, which was good to see. He’s still very capable. Kick them straight, we’ll be good.” Missing seven total kicks through 11 games would get plenty of other kickers a pink slip. That’s just the nature of the position in the NFL and the fine line between winning and losing. Kicking issues are omnipresent around the league, and Tucker is hardly alone among proven veterans having a tough time this season. The New York Jets have had four different kickers in as many weeks. GO DEEPER Normally 'automatic' kickers like Justin Tucker, Younghoe Koo are struggling in 2024 For the Ravens, however, kicking stability has been a constant. Matt Stover, nicknamed “Money Matt” for his accuracy, was the team’s kicker from 1996 to 2008. Cundiff replaced Hauschka in 2009 and was the team’s kicker for three seasons before his crushing late miss in the AFC Championship Game loss to the New England Patriots in January 2012. Tucker arrived on the scene as an undrafted free agent several months later, beat out Cundiff for the job and hasn’t missed a game in 13 seasons. Just the idea of making a kicking change in Baltimore seems blasphemous, given Tucker’s well-earned status. Before the two misses in Pittsburgh on Sunday, Tucker’s career field goal percentage (89.7) made him the most accurate kicker in NFL history and put him on a Hall of Fame track. His clutch kicking as a rookie in 2012 was instrumental in the Ravens winning their last Super Bowl. He’s been selected to seven Pro Bowl teams and named an All-Pro on eight occasions. Time and time again when the Ravens needed points, particularly late in games, Tucker stepped up, performed his tried-and-true pre-kick ritual and calmly delivered. He’s previously been the highest-paid kicker in the sport, and for good reason. Advertisement Tucker’s kicking brilliance, along with his charisma, outgoing personality and multitude of talents, made him one of the faces of the team and one of the most popular and recognizable athletes in Baltimore. Tucker’s No. 9 jerseys are not hard to find when you’re scanning the seating bowl at Ravens games. But this season has brought long-avoided angst in Baltimore about the performance of the kicker and led to a small but growing segment of Baltimore’s fan base to question why the organization hasn’t moved on, or at least brought in competition, for its longtime star. “Knowing the team, knowing the character of Justin, yes, his performance in the past does warrant him the benefit of the doubt, for sure,” Stover said. “But this is the NFL. It is a very immediate performance you have to have. With an objective job like being a kicker, it becomes a quick response for people to say, ‘Hey, man, what’s wrong with you? Do we need to make a change?'” Yet, Stover said, “He’s one of the best who has ever done it. Who are you going to get who you can guarantee will be better?” Bringing in another kicker in mid-November likely means either signing a well-traveled veteran who hasn’t been able to land another job or plucking someone off another team’s practice squad. It’s inconceivable at the moment that the Ravens would trust one of those options more than Tucker at a time when they fancy themselves as Super Bowl contenders. “He’s definitely our best option, and he’s going to make a lot of kicks — I really believe that,” Harbaugh said. “But it’s up to him and the guys he works with every day to make those balls go straight. Competition right now, at this time, no that’s not something we’d want for Justin.” Stover, who is in the Ravens’ Ring of Honor, still lives in the Baltimore area and has relationships with many people in the building, including Tucker. He also understands what Tucker is going through. There were times early in his career with Cleveland when he struggled and the Browns brought in competition for his job. In 1999, the Ravens claimed kicker Joe Nedney on waivers while Stover remained on the roster. Advertisement “That was brutal. He wasn’t on the practice squad. He wasn’t on IR. He was on the roster,” Stover said. “It really just comes down to performance. There’s no subjectivity. I got through it. “Justin is going through a little blip. He’s mentally strong. He’s got a great support staff around him. He’s got a head coach who totally gets it. To do it for 12 years as well as he’s done it says a lot about who he is and his character. It’s the first time he’s ever had to deal with this. I dealt with it three or four times. It was hard and it sucks. He’ll get through it.” Stover, who trains young kickers, acknowledged that he hasn’t broken down Tucker’s mechanics, but he maintains the fact that Tucker has missed all seven kicks wide left is a “good thing,” because that often points to a fixable issue. It doesn’t appear to be a leg strength issue with Tucker. Almost all of his kicks, except one, have had the necessary distance. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

There has been plenty of speculation about whether his issues are being caused by snapping and/or holding problems, but Tucker and others at the Ravens’ facility have continued to say snapper Nick Moore and holder Jordan Stout, who aren’t new at this or to the team, are doing their jobs. After Sunday’s misses, Tucker retreated to the locker room to address reporters and insisted his struggles are not a confidence issue, either. “I’m still confident I’m going to go out there and nail every single kick,” Tucker said. “Part of the way we stay confident is by continuing to work and trust the process, and I know I might sound like a broken record, but it’s a part of what brings us success — just trusting the process and then taking it one kick at a time.” Harbaugh, a former special teams coach, has a very close relationship with the kicker. Senior special teams coach Randy Brown has been with Tucker every step of his career and is considered one of the top kicking gurus in the league. Ravens assistant special teams coach Sam Koch is a former holder for Tucker and one of his closest confidants. Advertisement Stout has been holding for Tucker for three seasons, and Moore has been in the Ravens organization since 2020. The kicking battery and coaching staff have an established routine that has yielded very strong results for many years. “You try to attack everything to the utmost that we can, across the board,” Harbaugh said. “Justin is one of the aspects that we’re looking at. He’s going to get it figured out. We have coaches. We have technique. We look at the tape. He’s practicing well. He’s got to kick it straight.” (Top photo: Barry Reeger / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,Seattle Has Been Without an N.B.A. Team for 16 Years. Could the League Return?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5838058/2024/11/15/nba-expansion-seattle-supersonics/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 22:11:21 +0000","Ever since the Sonics left in 2008, Seattle has been waiting for another franchise. There’s an overriding sentiment that now is the time.","NBA SEATTLE — When the SuperSonics left here in 2008, Brent Barry felt it in his gut. There was an emptiness, a sadness so pronounced that he was moved to put pen to paper. At the time, Barry was preparing for training camp with the San Antonio Spurs, but part of his heart was still in Seattle, a bond forged through his five seasons as a wing with the Sonics. Now the team was no more thanks to an abrupt transaction that uprooted the franchise to Oklahoma City. Advertisement Barry’s mind was numbed with a blur of memories he captured in his poem, “When It Rains.” “… and here I sit in my office space and think of my career And what to say to my two sons, did the team just disappear? I played in KeyArena, I live on Queen Anne Hill I played pinball at Shorty’s after games, and ate burgers at both Red Mills I would have some chowder down at Dukes, and watch Sea Planes take their flight And find myself in Fremont if I needed a beer that night I saw Star Wars at Cinerama, tossed a pitch at Safeco Field, Drove all the way to Bellingham to see Pearl Jam and Yield …” Sixteen years later, a collection of Sonics jerseys extends wall-to-wall inside the Simply Seattle store downtown. From Detlef Schrempf to Gary Payton to Ray Allen to Kevin Durant, the jerseys of Sonics legends are still a hot commodity. “We get people from New Zealand, London, from all over,” store manager Kate Wansley said. “The Sonics are a big thing, and now everyone is excited about what could happen.” What could happen has many in this Northwest metropolis tense with anticipation. In September, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said the league would address NBA expansion at some point this season, which prompted an already simmering movement in Seattle to bubble over.  Since 2008, Seattle has been waiting, expecting a franchise to return. And now, with overtures of the NBA’s first expansion since 2004, there is an overriding sentiment that Seattle is due. “There’s just too much karma that says put a team back in Seattle,” says George Karl, who coached the Sonics from 1992-98, leading them to an NBA Finals appearance in 1996. “I don’t know more than anybody else, but my feeling is … that it can happen. It should happen.” Karl is sipping iced tea and soaking in a picturesque view of Seattle’s Elliott Bay on a sun-splashed Thursday. He lives in Denver but is in town to help promote, support and encourage Seattle’s candidacy should Silver and the NBA Board of Governors decide to proceed with expansion. Advertisement As the Seahawks played host to the San Francisco 49ers at Lumen Field, Karl and former Sonics players Dale Ellis and Rashard Lewis attended a social event on the 75th floor of the Columbia Tower that included Seattle mayor Bruce Harrell, Seattle Sports Commission president and CEO Beth Knox and several business leaders. “It’s a lot of anticipation; I feel like we are hanging on the edge of our seats, waiting,” Knox said. “We are ready.” The event was important enough for Harrell that he postponed plans for his 66th birthday (he was quick to note he shared his birthday with Sonics legend Gus Williams) so he could spread what he calls “the buzz” about Seattle’s viability for expansion. “We need to make sure the decision-makers — the NBA commissioner, the administration and co-owners — realize this is a very attractive market, and we have the fan base,” Harrell said. “They sort of know it, but this was 2008 when we lost the team, and we have a whole new generation of people in town, so we need to assure them we have that kind of spirit.” In September, Silver tempered expectations when he said the league “is not quite ready” to discuss expansion before adding that eventually it will be broached. “What we’ve told interested parties is: ‘Thank you for your interest, we will get back to you,’ ” Silver said. “That’s certainly the case in Seattle.” Still, hopes haven’t been this high here since 2013, when a bid to relocate the Sacramento Kings to Seattle reached a vote of NBA governors but was turned down 22-8 after Sacramento came up with new ownership. Ellis, who played for seven NBA teams, said the city’s diversity, food and fan base kept him in Seattle for 20 years after his career ended. The 41-year history of the franchise, which includes the 1979 NBA title, is why he believes so passionately that the league should return. It’s why he flew to Seattle to support Thursday’s movement, a movement that he says stands more than a chance of landing a return of the Sonics. “Chance? No, it’s going to happen. It’s going to happen,” Ellis said. “They just haven’t made the announcement yet. There will be two franchises, one here in Seattle, and one in Las Vegas.” GO DEEPER Adam Silver would 'love to have' NBA franchise in Mexico City Like so many former Sonics players and coaches, Barry felt he didn’t just play in Seattle, he felt he was part of Seattle. So losing the Sonics felt like losing part of himself. It is that player-community connection that has made this movement to revive the Sonics unique. Other cities have lost NBA franchises — Vancouver, San Diego, Kansas City — but none have had former players and coaches campaigning for a return like Seattle. Advertisement Lewis, who played his first nine NBA seasons with the Sonics, flew into Seattle from Houston motivated by two factors: the history and the fans. “Seattle has a part of me; I became a man here,” Lewis said. “And the fans … I still remember Big Lo (super fan Lorin Sandretzky), and fans pulling up to the airport when we arrived. There’s history, so much history here, and that’s why they have to have a team here.” The 1990s in particular were a magical time for Seattle. Microsoft was booming. Bands from Seattle — Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, Soundgarden — were leading the grunge explosion. “Singles” and “Sleepless in Seattle” hit movie screens. Ken Griffey Jr. was a superstar. And Payton, Kemp and the fiery Karl were headlining SportsCenter highlights. “It all had this mystical essence to it,” Barry said. “Because nobody wanted to go to the Pacific Northwest. It was so far away, the weather was bad … but there was a lot of cool stuff happening in and around that place. So it had this mystical quality to it.” Added Karl: “The city was blossoming, the music was blossoming, the city was growing, the Mariners were good … everything was just in rhythm. There was a rhythm that Seattle was cool. Pearl Jam, Starbucks, (Microsoft’s Steve) Ballmer … and (the Sonics) were good. “Unfortunately, Michael (Jordan) was in the league.” The electricity between the Sonics and the Seattle scene made for lasting bonds. For fans and the players. “Spilling out from KeyArena after a game meant that you were in the bloodstream of the city,” said Barry, now an assistant coach with Phoenix. “You got out of the arena and you could walk across the street to Lazy J’s (Jalisco’s) and do karaoke with a bunch of fans who were just at the game. You could go to First Street and hop into a steakhouse and have a meal with fans who just left the game. Advertisement “To lose all that … it was a gut punch to a city that loved basketball, loved its team and had a relationship with the team that was unique.” Portland Trail Blazers play-by-play announcer Kevin Calabro, who announced Sonics games for 22 years, said fans still ask him regularly if and when the Sonics will return, which is attributed to the connection formed during those memorable years in the 1990s. “You had this great amalgam of cutting-edge technology with the internet coming to life and this great music scene and the Sonics bursting at the seams,” Calabro said. “And it all came together on winter nights at The Barn, as we used to call KeyArena. Jeff Ament (Pearl Jam bassist) was down in the baseline seats all the time, Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam singer) was around, Screaming Trees … all these bands would show up. “And when George Karl took over, it just lit a fire. There were so many great characters … and they were all involved with the community. You could feel them, touch them, see them at the clubs, hang with them. It was special.” Wansley, the store manager who hangs the Sonics jerseys from wall to wall, is a lifelong Seattle resident. She said her deepest bonds are with the Sonics because she experienced them in everyday life. She saw Nate McMillan and Sam Perkins at Bellevue Square, Kemp and Gary in the store, Dana Barros here, Schrempf there. “It was something that just connects you to them,” Wansley said. “You would go to the game, then see them out … and I don’t know how it is in other cities, but they were just out in the community so much. It would be like, ‘Hey, I just saw you play …’ ” Seattle has been down this road of anticipation before. The 2013 bid to relocate the Kings to Seattle was so close to happening — and so ugly in its particulars — that its downfall left some scars. But the overall sentiment today is that Seattle is well positioned, if not a leader when expansion becomes a reality. Much of the optimism stems from Climate Pledge Arena, the refurbished KeyArena, which now houses the NHL’s Seattle Kraken. Advertisement “There literally hasn’t been a week where I haven’t been asked about the Sonics or the NBA or how we got screwed,” said Bob Whitsitt, who was president and general manager of the Sonics from 1986-94. “And for years, I said to them — right or wrong — that Seattle was not in a position to even be considered for a team until they have an NBA-ready facility. “And that giant hurdle has now been cleared with Climate Pledge Arena. As a city, we know we have a facility that works. That doesn’t guarantee you a team, but you can be guaranteed not to get a team by not having a facility. So, the biggest thing has been taken off the board.” Whitsitt still lives in Seattle and said he is encouraged by a potential ownership group led by Kraken owners David Bonderman and his daughter, Samantha Holloway. Bonderman also is a minority owner of the Boston Celtics. “My support is behind them,” Whitsitt said. “They are the right ones. They are the perfect people to lead the thing. And the Seattle market is not only great, it is ready.” Last month, more than 18,000 sold out the LA Clippers and Trail Blazers exhibition game at Climate Pledge Arena, which more than caught the eye of coaches Chauncey Billups of the Blazers and Tyronn Lue of the Clippers. “I mean, everybody talks about it,” Billups said. “This is obviously a desired city, a market that people love … it makes the most sense. It’s already been very successful, the market has, so it makes a lot of sense. We just have to wait on it.” Added Lue: “It’s a great environment, a great place to play … they’ve done a great job with this arena.” Brian Robinson, a Seattle real estate investor, heads Seattle NBA Fans, the group that hosted the event with Karl, Lewis, Ellis and the mayor. He has 250 community leaders and 50 CEOs behind his movement. He also headed a 2010 group that tried to find an arena solution to lure the Sonics back. He said then, it was difficult to get business leaders and companies behind him. Advertisement “Now, no one ever says no,” said Robinson, 51. “People see the change in tone from the commissioner and they see a path. Everyone wants to be a part of it. I just feel like the people of Seattle are over the negativity and they are ready to have this journey be something meaningful.” Mayor Harrell and Knox, the CEO of the Seattle Sports Commission, are envisioning a future where Sonics players become role models and inspire youth to not only participate in basketball, but dream. Seattle has a long history of producing NBA talent, including Brandon Roy, Jason Terry, Jamal Crawford, Paolo Banchero and Dejounte Murray. Barry thinks the Sonics can help inspire others. “How do you dream bigger if you don’t see it in front of you?” Barry asked. “I was thinking if I never went to Golden State games as a kid to watch Chris Mullin, Tim Hardaway and Mitch Richmond, how much of my devotion and love of the game would have been depleted by not having the touch, the autograph, the memories? The impact can’t be overstated. “There’s almost 20 years of kids in Seattle who never saw one game in their city of LeBron James, one of the greatest players who ever played. Twenty years of kids, and parents for that matter, who haven’t had that community, that environment, that experience. It hurts.” GO DEEPER Jamal Crawford, godfather of Seattle hoops, still getting buckets, giving back Last month, Barry thought back to the day when he penned the “When It Rains” poem. He rifled through his files and found it. “Even reading it again, I was like, ‘Man, I still feel this way. It sucks,” Barry said. “I was sad. Legitimately sad. But right now, I don’t think there has ever been more sentiment or momentum than right now. And I hope it’s not another carrot in front of the rabbit situation. I hope this momentum is true and honest and there is potential for the green and gold to be back there.” It was the same thought he had 16 years ago, in San Antonio as he closed his poem. Advertisement “… A chapter left unwritten, a generation with a gap, Forty-one years of NBA action and now no one can clap But here is a silver lining … above every cloud’s a sun And the possibility is something we hold on to even if slim to none For faith and hope and love are tenants Of the days as one grows old And for all at stake, those clouds will break And we will see the green and gold.”

NYT > Sports,A Shocking Tragedy Took the Life of a Hockey Star and His No. 1 Fan,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5930652/2024/11/20/matthew-gaudreau-boston-college/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 22:11:21 +0000","Matthew and John Gaudreau were killed after being struck by a car on Aug. 29. For some, the sense of loss still hasn’t sunk in.","NHL His brother was Johnny Hockey. He had the Matty Dance. Ask any of Matthew Gaudreau’s childhood buddies about his moves, and they’ll chuckle knowingly. Gaudreau and his group of friends, which included his older brother, John, loved country music, especially Kenny Chesney. They regularly tailgated before concerts in college and in the years that followed. The group gathered early those summer days. They ate Wawa breakfast sandwiches on the way in. They sipped beer in stadium parking lots, leaving red plastic cups scattered near the cooler, and grilled for dinner. These were all-day affairs. Advertisement And at some point, without a doubt, Matty Gaudreau would find his way onto the back of someone’s truck, often when a Chesney song blared over the speakers. He’d break out the Matty Dance. “Just swinging his arms around in a circular, slow motion,” says friend Eric Robinson. “Some version of a windmill with a hip thrust,” adds Hunter Brody. They can still see it. This is who Matthew Gaudreau was: a life-of-the-party presence, arms waving through the air. When his widow, Madeline, spoke at his funeral, she described him as so much more than a hockey player, coach and friend. That’s a consensus among people who loved him. He was someone who made a point to connect with others, be it his high school teachers or younger teammates at Boston College. Someone who never felt jealous of his older brother, a more skilled player who became an NHL star. Someone who cried when he heard his unborn son’s heartbeat for the first time. On Aug. 29, Matthew and John — his closest friend — were biking in Oldmans Township, N.J., when a Jeep Grand Cherokee struck them from behind. Both were pronounced dead at the scene. John was 31, Matthew 29. Their sister Katie’s wedding was scheduled for the next day. When talking about Gaudreau, those who knew him often slip into the present tense. His death is still so recent that, for some, it doesn’t feel real that he’s gone. Perhaps it never will. The Gaudreau brothers grew up in a white, two-story house in Penns Grove, N.J., a small town southwest of Philadelphia. They regularly hosted their friends for bonfires and evenings at the backyard pool. Brody, who grew close with Matthew in high school, felt like he was there every summer night when he was younger. Matthew and John shared a bedroom overlooking the gravel driveway. Old hockey jerseys hung from the walls. When friends spent the night, the brothers pushed their beds together so more people could fit. Others would fight over air mattresses, trying to avoid the one with a hole in it. They’d get up in the mornings for training sessions and skates, then often find themselves back at the house again at night. Advertisement The Gaudreaus were as tight-knit a family as could be. Community mattered. Their house was the center of it all. Matthew was slight in build. Friends remember waking up to Guy Gaudreau, his dad, whipping up breakfast. He’d pile eggs and bacon on Matthew’s plate, trying to help him put on weight. Sometimes Matthew would get so full he’d shove eggs to the family dog, Sadie, while Guy was looking away. The weight never stuck. When teams took measurements, Matthew would sometimes stuff pucks in his jock strap to trick the scale. His wife said in her eulogy that she thought he looked 90 pounds when they met as teenagers. The Gaudreau name carries weight in the South Jersey hockey community. Guy worked as the hockey director at Hollydell Ice Arena in Sewell, N.J., not far from Penns Grove. Dan Spencer, now an emergency backup goalie for the Flyers, calls Gaudreau the best coach he ever had. John Gaudreau, Eric Robinson, Buddy Robinson and Tony DeAngelo played at Hollydell growing up and went on to appear in NHL games. Plenty of other college players like Matthew started their careers there. “There are a crazy number of people who came out of Hollydell for being a small rink in South Jersey,” says Eric Robinson, now a forward on the Hurricanes. Boston College coach Jerry York once asked Guy how he taught Johnny and Matthew such good edge control. He replied that he trained them with Skittles. He’d throw one on the ice, and the boys would have to skate to it. Then he’d throw another. On top of his responsibilities at Hollydell, Gaudreau coached the Gloucester Catholic High team. In 2009-10, Matthew’s freshman year and John’s junior year, the team went 15-4-2 and made its first-ever state championship. Though the Rams lost, both boys had a point in the final. Years later, Matthew would describe his days on the Gloucester team as the most fun he ever had playing hockey. Advertisement Close as they were, the brothers had different personalities. Principal Thomas Iacovone remembers John as the quieter of the two. He wanted to fade into the background. He wanted to be like any other kid. “Matty wanted you to know he was there,” he says. “He did it in such a way that you couldn’t help but to love him.” Iacovone was a history teacher when Matthew was in school and taught him in first-period homeroom his sophomore year. Matthew pulled his chair up to Iacovone’s desk seemingly every morning. They chatted about Philadelphia sports while waiting for the morning announcements. Rarely did the conversations revolve around Gaudreau himself. “He would engage me in what he knew I liked, and I was the teacher,” Iacovone says. “It should’ve been the other way around.” Once class began, Iacovone occasionally had to tell Gaudreau to sit down and be quiet. That was difficult, though; it usually resulted in Gaudreau cracking a joke that made him laugh. He was too charming to get in trouble, remembers now-athletic director Ryan Murphy, then an assistant athletic director. Matthew left Gloucester Catholic early to play junior hockey in Omaha, where he met his wife and skated for the Lancers, a United States Hockey League club. In the week before moving away from New Jersey, he and Brody embarked on a morning fishing trip. They left at 5 a.m. Gaudreau was sad about leaving the friends he made at Gloucester Catholic, Brody remembers, but he was excited, too. This was a big step: at that age, junior hockey felt like the biggest thing in the world. They stood in the dark, shoes muddy. Bugs bit their exposed skin as they cast their lines into the water. Their futures lay ahead of them. Matthew and John were determined to play college hockey together, and John found himself in a lurch in June 2011, months before his freshman year. He had committed to Northeastern, but coach Greg Cronin had just left for a job as a Maple Leafs assistant. The older Gaudreau brother got out of his letter of intent because of the coaching change, but then he needed to find a new school — and fast. Advertisement Not long after, the Gaudreau brothers and their parents were on Boston College’s campus. Future NHLer Kevin Hayes showed the boys around, York remembers, while he talked to the parents. After they were done, they stood in front of the rink. “Well, what do you guys think?” York asked. “Any questions?” John turned to his younger brother. That’s whose opinion mattered to him. “Let’s go here,” Matthew replied. And so they did. Their mother, Jane, said in a 2014 New York Times article that Matthew actually preferred Boston University, but he chose the Eagles when John gave him the final decision because he knew it was what his older brother wanted. “He was kind of a dynamic presence in their relationship, almost like he was the older brother,” York says of Matthew. “Johnny looked for advice from Matty an awful lot.” The decision had a major impact on both the program and the brothers. John was a point-per-game player as a freshman, two years before Matthew arrived on campus. The Eagles won the NCAA title that season. The season Matthew got to school, John won the Hobey Baker Award as the nation’s top collegiate player. Matthew played in only eight games that year. Not once, though, did he show a hint of jealousy. “He was his No. 1 fan,” says teammate Mike Matheson, a now-Canadiens defenseman who was the grade between the brothers. “They were just inseparable.” Though Matthew was not a lineup regular, he still had an important role with the team. Matheson remembers Matthew, aided by his relationship with John, acting as a bridge between the freshmen and upperclassmen. He made sure everyone was involved and did so throughout his time at Boston College. Classmate Ryan Fitzgerald describes him as “everybody’s first call.” Whenever someone wanted to do something, they called Matthew. Advertisement “As cliquey as he could have been, he was always setting stuff up for everybody, making sure everyone was there, making sure every guy was happy and comfortable,” says Zach Sanford, who was a year below Matthew. Fitzgerald and Matthew lived together in six-person, on-campus suites their sophomore to senior years. One day rolled into the next: class, hockey and then hours on the couch talking the time away with their roommates. Those, Fitzgerald says, are memories he’ll always hold close. Matthew and Madeline were managing long-distance dating at the time, and she would visit frequently. Fitzgerald loved seeing how his friend’s face lit up with her in the room. He jokes she was their mother roommate. The hockey players lived like, well, college boys. She was disgusted whenever she arrived. She’d tell Matthew and his friends they couldn’t keep living like this. They’d all agree with her — temporarily, at least. “And then she’d come back a month later, and it’d look like a bomb went off,” Fitzgerald says. From a hockey perspective, sitting out most of his freshman year couldn’t have been easy for Matthew, who played more than 50 games each of the previous two seasons in Omaha. He didn’t let that show. York remembers him focusing through video work and prescouts of other teams, remaining ready at all times. This wasn’t a typical throwaway year for a kid who wasn’t playing much. He made sure to gain experience. Matheson describes Gaudreau as “the best I’ve ever seen” at handling being a scratch. Fitzgerald doesn’t think he’d have handled it as well. But Matthew savored his year as college teammates with his brother. Gaudreau’s attitude eventually paid off. He played in most games his sophomore and junior seasons, then never came out of the lineup as a senior. He was nearly a point-per-game player by graduation, scoring eight goals and 35 points in 40 games his final season with the Eagles. Advertisement Though his skill showed by the time he left Boston College, Matthew had different elements to his game than his brother. Despite his 5-foot-9, 137-pound frame, “he was a little s— disturber,” Fitzgerald says. He didn’t shy away from scrums. His senior season — the same year John won the NHL’s Lady Byng Trophy for gentlemanly conduct — Matthew was one of only two Boston College players with more than 50 penalty minutes. Though similarly small, John was better at eluding contact, York remembers. Matthew would take huge hits. But he always seemed to get right back up, even when York prepared to send the trainers on the ice. “It was like he had a heart of steel,” the coach says. By the time Matthew graduated, he was ready to pursue professional hockey — something York thought seemed improbable at earlier points during his college career. He willed himself to that point. Graduation itself was memorable for Fitzgerald. The night before, the hockey players skipped the senior class celebration, instead going out on their own. “I don’t think any of us slept,” he says. Wearing black robes the next day, Matthew and Fitzgerald, both communication majors, joined their classmates for a procession through campus. As they waited, a woman came by asking if anyone wanted to lead the students while holding a large, maroon Boston College flag over their head. “I’ll do it!” Matthew called out. Fitzgerald still laughs thinking about it. All these communications majors had probably spent the entire night before together, but there leading the way was Matthew Gaudreau, bags under his eyes from one last college all-nighter with his friends. Gaudreau carved out a professional playing career for as long as he could. Most of his games came in the ECHL, two rungs below the NHL, but he appeared in 21 AHL games, too, and also had a brief stint playing in Sweden. Gaudreau looked like a hockey lifer, just like his dad. Ryan Murphy, the Gloucester Catholic athletic director, remembers Guy telling him at one point that Matthew would become a great coach. While with the ECHL team in Worcester, less than an hour out of Boston, he’d swing by his college to say hi to York and the Eagles. York, who was always impressed with how well Gaudreau observed the game, remembers his former player asking questions about coaching on those visits. Advertisement “The promise of life he had coming …” York says, trailing off. When John emerged as an NHL player, he began hosting offseason skills camps for kids at Hollydell. Robinson remembers going to the locker room with the brothers before camps began. Without fail, John would ask Matthew what drills they should do. The friend group joked that the younger brother was becoming his dad. “He had a knack for it,” Robinson says. “For whatever reason, some guys who play, they can transition into that.” Gaudreau got his coaching start with Philadelphia Hockey Club, which practiced at — where else? — Hollydell Ice Arena. The next season, 2022-23, a new opportunity arose: Gloucester Catholic needed a new hockey coach. Matthew met with Iacovone and Ryan Meehan, then the athletic director, at an Italian restaurant near Hollydell. They talked for two hours, mainly about life outside of the sport. When it came to the job, Iacovone told Gaudreau he was his No. 1 choice — and he didn’t have a No. 2. A few days later, Gaudreau accepted the position his dad once held. His goal was to make a career out of coaching, and he was on his way. Guy joined his son’s staff as an assistant for 2022-23, and so did Spencer, his former Gloucester teammate. The team went 9-9-2 and made a run to the state semifinal. Billy Sheridan, a player on that team, remembers he could walk into Gaudreau’s office at any time and ask for help. During his time as Gloucester coach, Gaudreau tried to get his players to recognize how special high school hockey is. “You guys don’t realize it,” he’d tell them, “but this is going to be the best four years of your life.” The next season was more difficult. Key players graduated, and the team’s numbers dipped to around a dozen. It was hard to hold complete practices with so few players, and Gaudreau himself had to miss at times because of commitments as an assistant coach for the Philadelphia Rebels, the Hollydell-based junior team. Gloucester didn’t win a game that season. After it ended, Gaudreau met again with Iacovone. He felt it was best to step away. He couldn’t commit fully to the team and didn’t feel that was fair to the players. Plus, he had his first baby, Tripp, on the way. Life was going to get busy. Madeline Gaudreau wore a pink dress with a white floral pattern as she stepped to the marble podium at St. Mary Magdalen Catholic Church in Media, Pa. During her eulogy, she spoke of her husband’s bond with John, how they loved sharing a bedroom growing up and never wanted it to change. It brings her comfort that they are still together. Advertisement “Anyone who knows Matty knows he was born to be a dad,” she said toward the end of the speech, stopping to compose herself. The idea of fatherhood consumed Matthew. He asked John for advice, ordered books and researched diaper brands. Iacovone remembers how excited he was when he saw him over the summer. Matthew never got to meet baby Tripp, who is due next month, according to Madeline’s Instagram account. Tributes have rolled in since his death. Hollydell held a memorial for the boys. Gloucester Catholic did, too, during which the hockey team presented Guy and Jane with a jersey. Both the Flyers and Blue Jackets have given Guy the chance to help with team practices. The Gaudreau family wanted loved ones to stop by their house in the days after John and Matthew’s deaths. People brought coffee and meals. During one visit, Brody went upstairs to Matthew and John’s old room, the site of their teenage sleepovers. It looked unchanged from when they were kids. He got the same feeling Madeline experiences when standing in baby Tripp’s nursery. They can feel Matthew with them. (Illustration: Meech Robinson / The Athletic.

NYT > Sports,"Lionel Messi’s Coach Resigned, Leading to Questions About the Star’s Future",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5934267/2024/11/20/lionel-messi-inter-miami-tata-martino-exit/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 22:11:21 +0000",Messi is under contract with Inter Miami through 2025.,"MLS As Inter Miami closed in on a record-setting 74-point season and a Supporters’ Shield trophy, much of the credit was given to Lionel Messi. When healthy, the 37-year-old Argentina national team captain was dominant.  Messi played in just 19 of Miami’s 36 league matches but was still performing at MVP level, even if this was perhaps unsurprising for an eight-time Ballon d’Or winner. Messi, though, has attributed Miami’s rise from a last-place club to the league’s standard to head coach Tata Martino.  Advertisement “The team has grown so much with Martino’s arrival,” Messi told reporters on the eve of the Leagues Cup final in August 2023. He repeated that on October 2 this year in a post-match interview with Apple TV after scoring two goals against the Columbus Crew to secure the Supporters’ Shield. On Tuesday, The Athletic reported Martino had resigned as Miami’s head coach due to personal reasons. The club announced that Martino, club co-owner Jorge Mas and president of football operations Raul Sanllehi will address the media on Friday. The reasons for Martino’s abrupt departure from Miami, who were eliminated from the MLS playoffs on November 9, will become more clear. But it may not answer every pending question regarding the future of the club and how this change will affect Messi. The World Cup winner has a contract through the 2025 season and a reported option for 2026. Messi is much more than a star player at the club. His contract includes a purchase option that would make him a partial owner in the future. He’s an influential figure. In June 2023, cameras in Argentina captured Martino leaving Messi’s gated community in Rosario. The unconfirmed meeting took place two weeks after Messi told the world that he would end his European career and head to the United States. It preempted the third iteration of a Messi-Martino partnership. Martino coached Messi for one season at Barcelona in 2014 then again in 2015-2016 with the Argentina national team.  Former Barcelona director of football Andoni Zubizarreta claimed in 2020 that Martino had voiced concerns about Messi’s authority at the Catalan club during a Barcelona training session a decade ago. According to Zubizarreta, Martino told Messi, “I know you can call the president and he’ll fire me, but damn, you don’t have to demonstrate that every day. I already know.”  Advertisement “Those words never came out of my mouth,” Martino said shortly after. Their relationship has been overanalyzed. The fact that Martino could not win a major trophy alongside Messi fueled the hypothesis that a lack of success had created fissures between the two. The evidence at hand, though, doesn’t add up.  Messi and Martino shared an embrace during last summer’s hype-filled Leagues Cup run which seemingly put an end to that theory. Messi’s public support of Martino this season carries weight as well. A stinging loss can change everything in professional sport. But Martino’s resignation coincides with a shift in dynamics inside the walls of Miami’s facility in Fort Lauderdale. To begin with, there is no shortage of decision makers at the club.  There’s Mas, the outspoken billionaire executive who personally recruited Luis Suarez. His brother Jose Mas is also a club adjudicator. Co-owner David Beckham has a say across multiple departments, too. Martino himself had significant authority on player signings early in his short tenure.  Things get complicated when it comes to the club’s sporting department. It was originally led by chief soccer officer Chris Henderson until Mas hired Sanllehi to oversee that division. It will be Sanllehi, not Henderson, who will flank Martino and Jorge Mas during Friday’s press conference. Sanllehi has twice held the position of director of football, first at Barcelona and then at Arsenal. He and Martino crossed paths during the Argentine’s lone year in La Liga. Before joining Miami, Sanllehi was the director general of Real Zaragoza in Spain — where Mas is part of the ownership group. Shortly after Sanllehi arrived in Zaragoza, the club’s owners replaced head coach Juan Ignacio Martinez with Juan Carlos Carcedo, a former assistant of Unai Emery at Arsenal, Paris Saint-Germain and Sevilla, among other clubs. Sanllehi described Carcedo, the current head coach of Cypriot team Pafos FC, as “hard-working, knowledgeable and modern” in an  interview with The Athletic in 2022. Advertisement By hiring Sanllehi, Mas sent a clear message. He has experience in key administrative positions in Europe and will help shape Miami’s sporting strategy. But there are major differences between managing a top-tier European side and maneuvering the convoluted squad and financial restrictions of an MLS club.  Sanllehi was instrumental in the highly-publicized deal that saw Neymar move from Santos to Barcelona in 2013. Neymar has been the latest superstar to be linked to a move to Miami. But Messi also has allies within the club in important roles. One is Guillermo Hoyos, Miami’s director of player development and methodology. Hoyos, an Argentine, was a youth coach of Messi’s at Barcelona. In 2010, Messi referred to Hoyos as “my footballing godfather.” Henderson is one of just a few professionals within the organization who has vast experience as an MLS executive. The club’s director of player personnel and compliance, Meghan Cameron, is a former MLS league office employee who was hired in 2021 after Miami were sanctioned for the MLS salary budget and roster guidelines. Henderson has thus far survived the ongoing shakeup. Miami’s vice president of soccer operations Niki Budalic, who works closely with Henderson, remains at the club. Others do not. Former first team director of scouting and recruitment Mark Prizant, a former Manchester United scout, left the club over the summer for new MLS expansion side San Diego FC. He was named assistant sporting director. After Miami’s 2-1 win over Atlanta United on October 25, Martino credited Henderson, Budalic and others for identifying midfielder Yannick Bright in the 2023 college draft. Bright, 23, was a revelation in 2024. Martino clearly respected their opinions. With so many important voices in some of Miami’s most prominent positions, Martino had limited sway. In the end, Martino, who took Miami from the bottom of the Eastern Conference to the league’s best-ever point total, is just a coach. Never mind that his eye for talent identification has resulted in two of MLS’ most prolific teams. Atlanta United in 2018 and the 2024 version of Inter Miami have Martino’s fingerprints throughout both teams.  Advertisement But as Martino told reporters two weeks ago, Miami fell well short of their objectives this season. The bar was high when he was hired shortly after Messi announced his decision to join. The standard, now, is even higher. Martino’s successor will have to manage up and appease the club’s most powerful voices. Miami’s next head coach must find common ground with Messi immediately, and outperform the team’s 2024 exploits. Carcedo could be a dark horse candidate based on his previous history with Mas and Sanllehi. Former Barcelona midfielder and manager Xavi, currently unemployed, checks the most boxes. Together with Messi and Sergio Busquets, Xavi was an integral part of Barcelona’s glorious run from the mid 2000s. Mas admires the Barcelona DNA. His successful courtship of Messi, Suarez, Busquets and Jordi Alba have been a boon for the club and for MLS. Then there’s Javier Mascherano, another former Barcelona midfielder and a legend with the Argentina national team. Mascherano and Messi have a long history together. Mascherano, 40, is the head coach of Argentina’s U-20 and U-23 teams. He talks openly about his friendship with Messi. He also tried to include Messi in his squad for the Paris Olympics as an overage player. The Miami job is a desirable one from the outside. Thanks to Messi, the club’s brand is well known around the world. But whoever is hired as Miami’s next manager will have the unenviable task of coaching an aging Miami team with limited depth at next summer’s Club World Cup.  Martino’s exit has been put down to personal reasons — but what Martino says on Friday, in what will be a highly visible news conference, could be telling.

The Owls’ new coaching search, though, might be the most interesting one of this year’s coaching carousel. And it got a little more interesting this week, as Miami great Ray Lewis has made it known that he really wants to be the Owls’ next coach, a source briefed on Lewis’ thinking said Wednesday. Advertisement The 49-year-old Lewis, a 13-time Pro Bowl linebacker, has observed the model of what Deion Sanders has done transforming Colorado football in the past two years and is expected to present a plan to the Owls’ leadership in the next week for how he’d do something similar at FAU. Lewis’ old buddy, fellow Pro Football Hall of Famer Cris Carter, is the Owls’ executive director of player engagement and is expected to be a good resource for Lewis. A big hurdle for Lewis is, unlike Sanders, he doesn’t have any previous college coaching experience. “Ray wants it bad,” the source briefed on Lewis’ thinking said. Lewis lives five minutes from the FAU campus. “He really wants it.” Lewis, however, is not considered a serious candidate at this point, according to a source involved in the coaching search. The frontrunner for the FAU vacancy, according to multiple sources involved in the search, is Ole Miss offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. The 31-year-old son of former Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis, who lives a half-hour from Boca Raton, is the play caller at a hot Rebels program and runs the nation’s No. 2 offense, putting up 7.58 yards per play. GO DEEPER FAU coaching job profile: What will Tom Herman's replacement inherit? The younger Weis was Kiffin’s former offensive coordinator at FAU and knows the program well. He has a lot of support from some key FAU people, according to sources involved in the search. Kiffin has strong influence back at FAU and will push Weis for the job, those sources said. Financially, Weis — who makes $1.65 million at Ole Miss — might have to take a pay cut to go back to FAU but a source briefed on the matter said he doubted that would stop Weis from wanting this job. Georgia Tech offensive coordinator Buster Faulkner might make more sense for the Owls. The 43-year-old helped turn Tech from the ACC’s No. 11 offense to No. 3 last year. In 2022, the year before he was hired in Atlanta, Georgia Tech ranked last in the ACC in red zone offense. His offense is No. 2 in the ACC in red zone TD percentage. Advertisement Penn State assistant head coach/co-OC Ja’Juan Seider is a well-regarded coach with deep local ties and is expected to get some consideration. The 47-year-old Belle Glade, Fla., product was a star quarterback at Florida A&M and is well-connected around South Florida. Players really respond to him. He also has been a key assistant in Happy Valley, at Marshall and West Virginia. UCF offensive coordinator Tim Harris Jr. has spent his whole coaching career in the state. He was a four-time NCAA All-American in track at Miami and then spent five years as a successful high school coach in South Florida at Miami’s Booker T. Washington High before spending seven seasons at FIU. Since then, he’s coached at Miami and UCF, where he has produced the Big 12’s most prolific offense at 6.76 yards per play. UNLV offensive coordinator Brennan Marion, a former Miami Dolphins wideout who lived in Boynton Beach, not far from the Owls’ campus, might be an intriguing option. He has proven to be a terrific offensive coordinator in two stops at the FCS level before an excellent two-season run of transforming the Rebels into a winning program. Last year he led the Rebels to No. 6 in the country in third down offense and No. 8 in red zone offense despite his starting QB going down early and having to turn to an unproven freshman in Jayden Maiava, who went on to win Mountain West Freshman of the Year honors. This year, the Rebels, with Maiava having left for USC, are No. 6 in the nation in scoring at 39.9 points per game. GO DEEPER What's on Feldman's radar: Everyone's terrified of Ole Miss, and everyone wants an old coach FSU defensive backs coach Pat Surtain could be in play at his alma mater Southern Miss, but he also has strong ties here. He played a decade in the NFL before becoming a top high school coach in South Florida. The 48-year-old spent one season with the Miami Dolphins as an NFL assistant before joining FSU’s staff in 2023. Georgia assistant head coach Todd Hartley, 39, spent three years coaching in South Florida on the Canes’ staff. He is someone Kirby Smart has leaned on in elevating the program since Hartley’s return to Athens in 2019. Southern Miss also has a lot of interest in Hartley for its head coaching vacancy.

He’s had a strong debut season in Durham and also could be in play. Miami defensive ends coach Jason Taylor. The Pro Football Hall of Famer, who had been a high school assistant for five seasons at powerhouse St. Thomas Aquinas, is a legendary figure around South Florida. In 2007, Taylor won the NFL’s prestigious Walter Payton Man of the Year honors and has been an excellent addition to the Canes staff the past two seasons. — Chris Vannini contributed to this report (Photo: Rob Carr / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,The Novelty Factor Is Gone and a True Test Awaits Formula 1 in Las Vegas,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5933143/2024/11/20/vegas-f1-preview/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 22:11:21 +0000",Developing goodwill with the local community is a much bigger emphasis for race organizers this year.,"Formula 1 LAS VEGAS — The start of Formula One’s Las Vegas residency last November was a major moment in the 73-year history of the sport. F1 spent over half a billion dollars to put on one of the most-hyped races in its history, taking over the reins of promoting and organizing the entire grand prix. Despite a bumpy start — a loose water valve cover canceled first practice and severely delayed FP2 on a lousy opening night — the event was a huge success. On the track, the fight for the win went down to the closing laps as Max Verstappen, Sergio Pérez and Charles Leclerc scrapped back and forth for position. The fast-flowing layout, incorporating a long straight down the Strip, proved a hit with the drivers and made for the most entertaining race of the year. Advertisement The grand prix was a money-spinner, even with locals’ frustrations resulting from the disruption of having F1 in town. November is typically the city’s eighth-best month of the year. In 2023, it was the second-best month in its history. “We knew it would be big, but the attention … frankly, F1 did a fantastic job of building up that race,” said Steve Hill, the CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA). “It was two or three times more marketing value than we would have expected going in. We would have been happy with a third of what we got. “We were going to be thrilled with what we expected, but what we got was eye-opening.” As F1 returns for its second shot in Las Vegas, there is a new dynamic. The novelty factor has diminished, but in its place comes experience and, for the organizers, a playbook to work from. There is a bar to try and meet once again. The spotlight on the race action in Las Vegas has only increased thanks to the closer competitive picture through 2024. By this point last year, Verstappen had already long been crowned champion; now, there is a chance he could clinch his fourth title Saturday night, so long as he finishes ahead of Lando Norris. The potential of F1 crowning a champion at its glitziest event is appealing for the sport and something the race organizers know would offer a unique chance to put a Las Vegas twist on the celebrations. “I’m sure that we would be able to pull some ideas out of our hat, maybe pre-arrange some pretty exciting opportunities,” Renee Wilm, CEO of the Las Vegas Grand Prix, said of a potential coronation, noting the high-end hospitality options at the properties along the Strip. “There’s so many opportunities to highlight the drivers, and particularly if we actually do have the benefit of being able to get a champion.” Advertisement While the organizers of the race may not be able to influence the sporting spectacle, the success of last year’s Saturday night race was enough reassurance that no changes were needed for 2024. The circuit remains unchanged, but they anticipate heightened fan interest with a late-season championship fight underway. “In the U.S., we love to see good competition, and it’s less about who the particular team or driver is,” Wilm said. “So to know that there is still so much on the line and that the championship is going to be up for grabs, and the fact you’ve had so many different drivers on the podium is itself creating a lot of excitement and buzz.” A different approach has been taken to appeal to fans for the second running of the race. In the lead-up to the 2023 grand prix, there was scrutiny of high ticket prices and how unaffordable it would be for people to attend. This year, over 10,000 extra general admission tickets have been made available across three fan zones as part of rejigging the ticket inventory. The hope is to make it a race that can cater to everybody, not just those chasing high-end experiences. The Las Vegas Grand Prix also changed how it marketed the race, starting the build-up around 100 days out instead of over a year in advance. Wilm said in October that ticket sales had been “pretty consistent with what we did expect” and that she anticipated a surge closer to the race due to Las Vegas’ reputation as a last-minute town. She also believed many fans would wait until after the U.S. presidential election, which may have left some “a little hesitant to know what their November is going to look like.” According to a statement issued by the race last week, 300,000 attendees are expected “based on calculated data from ticket sales and bookings for race-related programming.” Advertisement A more concerted effort has also been made to connect with the local community ahead of the second year. A free fan festival will take place Friday and Saturday, giving attendees a chance to get a flavor of what F1 brings to Las Vegas, with tickets quickly being fully reserved. Hill thought it would help “build both goodwill in the community and an additional fan base in the southwest” of the United States. Developing goodwill with the community was particularly important after the frustration many locals in Las Vegas felt about the level of disruption last year. The requirements of repaving the sections of the road for the circuit — taking 10 inches off the surface and replacing it with one suitable for F1 cars — led to significant road closures and traffic issues. With so much of the construction work already completed last year, there wasn’t a need to repeat it this year. “This year, the community knows more about what to expect, and what we’re doing is not building the circuit,” Hill said. “We really didn’t start any kind of lane disruption until the first week of October, where last year, that started in the middle of April. It just wears you out after a while.” Wilm said they were “just light years ahead of where we were October of last year, in terms of local sentiment. This is the Las Vegas Grand Prix. It’s also Liberty and Formula One’s grand prix. So it is so important to us that everyone embraces this event as much as we do.” Communication with locals is one area the organizers of the race felt there was room for improvement. “We communicated, but we didn’t communicate with the level of sophistication that this race demands,” Terry Miller, the general manager who oversees the track construction, told The Athletic. In 2024, the race improved a bespoke, interactive website to provide all the information about road closures and any possible disruption. It introduced a texting program, giving locals a “week ahead” view, and met with over 900 stakeholders to ensure no surprises. Another surprise from 2023 that F1 will be keen to avoid is the disruption caused by the loose water valve cover Thursday night that destroyed Carlos Sainz’s Ferrari, caused FP1 to be canceled after eight minutes and delayed FP2 so long that police asked fans to leave the track by that point. While it was hardly the first time a utility cover had come up at an F1 street track, it was by far the most infamous incident. Miller explained that new protocols are in place for this year. “Due to what occurred last year, we do have, in fact, a protocol and a process that we’ve gone through over the last five months to secure the lids, even to the point where we will do three or four visual checks of what’s going on in the roadway before and after a race event,” he said, confirming there were extra checks after what happened last year. Advertisement “You can never guarantee that nothing is going to happen,” he said. “But you can certainly have the mitigating efforts in place to reduce the risk, and that’s what we’ve done.” Even with the frustration felt by some in Las Vegas, the commercial success of the race was significant. A report by Clark County estimated the total economic impact of the grand prix to be $1.5 billion, $884 million of which came through visitor spending. It raised $77 million in tax revenue and turned what is normally the second-worst weekend of the year into “one of the best weekends we’ve ever had,” according to Hill, surpassing all expectations. Matching that in 2024 is going to be a big ask, nor is there an expectation it can be repeated in quite such spectacular fashion. “We’re not probably going to be able to compete with year one numbers again, and (we) don’t need to in order for it to be successful,” Hill said. “If the numbers were half that, it would still be a game changer.” It means a successful second running of the Las Vegas Grand Prix is more about sustainability — putting on another spectacular show with fewer issues or frustrations. Not everything will be to everyone’s liking. The start time of 10 p.m. PT Saturday remains unchanged, and it will inevitably bother drivers and their team personnel; a fresh dose of time zone confusion to kick off a tripleheader that continues with two weeks in the Middle East to see out the season. While there is a desire to reduce the demands placed on drivers for the “spectacle” around the grand prix, the show versus sport debate will also likely reignite when they get to the paddock Wednesday. But now it’s about reaching what Hill thought was “an equilibrium point” between excitement over something new and the uncertainty or concern it could cause locally, proving this can be an event for the long term. “That kind of sustainability matters a lot,” Hill said. “It’s a tough race to put on, it’s down one of the busiest streets in the world and putting that on is not an easy thing to do. But it’s going to be a fantastic week.” (Top photo: Bob Kupbens / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Luke Smith  is a Senior Writer covering Formula 1 for The Athletic.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Braves' Chris Sale caps resounding comeback by winning first Cy Young Award,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5931255/2024/11/20/braves-chris-sale-nl-cy-young/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 23:27:11 GMT","Sale's first season with the Braves was a masterpiece, as he finished with the NL's pitching triple crown and now its Cy Young Award.","MLB When the Atlanta Braves traded for injury-plagued pitcher Chris Sale on Dec. 30, they got a 35-year-old who had six consecutive top-five American League Cy Young Award finishes through 2018, but one who hadn’t stayed healthy in any of the five seasons since, nor received even a single down-ballot Cy Young Award vote in that span. Advertisement That’s why it was even more significant when the fiery left-hander didn’t just regain elite status among MLB pitchers in 2024, but was so much better than any other starter that he won his first Cy Young Award on Wednesday — and by a nearly unanimous vote by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America. In his 14th season and first in the National League, Sale won the award by a wide margin over the Philadelphia Phillies’ Zack Wheeler, receiving 26 of the 30 first-place votes on his way to 198 points while Wheeler got four first-place votes and totaled 130 points. The Pittsburgh Pirates’ Paul Skenes finished third (53 points) in the Cy Young Award balloting two days after winning NL Rookie of the Year. The San Diego Padres’ Dylan Cease was fourth with 45 points. The announcement came a week after Sale was named NL Comeback Player of the Year. Neither award was a surprise considering he was the first NL triple crown winner — the league leader in wins, ERA and strikeouts — since the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Clayton Kershaw in 2011. Sale led the majors with an 18-3 record and 2.38 ERA and led the NL with 225 strikeouts in 177 2/3 innings over 29 starts — three strikeouts behind MLB leader Tarik Skubal of the Detroit Tigers, the presumptive American League Cy Young Award winner. It was Sale’s most starts and innings since 2017. From 2020 through 2023 he was 11-7 with a 3.93 ERA in just 31 total starts and 151 innings for the Boston Red Sox. Sale won the Braves’ eighth Cy Young Award, second only to the Dodgers’ 12 since the awards were first presented in 1956. It’s Atlanta’s first Cy since another lefty, Tom Glavine, won in 1998, his second and the sixth in eighth years for Atlanta during a remarkable run by Hall of Famers Glavine, Greg Maddux and John Smoltz. In mid-September, after Sale broke Glavine’s franchise single-season record for strikeouts by a lefty and became the first Braves lefty with 200 Ks in a season, Glavine commended Sale for defying skeptics who didn’t think he could stay healthy all summer. Glavine praised his impact on and off the field. “He’s been obviously really, really big for the full rotation not just in terms of production,” Glavine said. “I know he’s been a huge influence on a lot of those young guys, too. You can’t put a price tag on that.” About that price tag: To get Sale, Braves president of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos traded infielder Vaughn Grissom to the Red Sox, who also sent $17 million to Atlanta to offset Sale’s $27.5 million salary in 2024 in the final year of his contract. That salary included $10 million deferred to 2039, meaning the Braves would’ve owed him only $500,000 in 2024, then $10 million in another 15 years. But five days after trading for Sale, Anthopoulos signed him to a two-year, $38 million contract that superseded the previous deal and gave Sale salaries of $16 million in 2024 and $22 million in 2025, plus an $18 million club option for 2026 with no buyout. Advertisement “It turned out to be a genius move, right?” Glavine said before smiling. When the contract was announced, many around baseball thought it risky given Sale’s injuries and age. No one called it a genius move then. Sale had convinced Anthoopoulos and the Braves that he was fully healed from a shoulder issue that caused him to miss two months in 2023 — the latest in an inventory of injuries, including Tommy John surgery in 2019 — and that he was fired up to help his team. He thought that would be the Red Sox, but by year’s end it was the Braves, and Sale was determined to be at his best for a team that had World Series aspirations and had given him a vote of confidence. ﻿ He credited Braves trainers and the team’s pitching plan for keeping him healthier than he’d been since his extended run of dominance with the Red Sox and Chicago White Sox, back when he went 99-59 with a 2.91 ERA from 2012-18 while averaging 30 starts, 198 innings and 240 strikeouts per season. That stretch began with a sixth-place Cy Young Award finish in 2012 with Chicago, followed by the six top-five finishes, including a runner-up feat in 2017, when Sale went 17-8 with a 2.90 ERA and led the majors in innings (214 1/3) and strikeouts (308). He finished as the Cy Young Award runner-up behind Cleveland’s Corey Kluber that year. With the new contract in place, the Braves believed they added frontline depth and some cost certainty beyond 2024, when they knew that Max Fried and Charlie Morton would be free agents. At the same time, it gave Sale a chance to focus entirely on pitching and not worry about pitching in a free-agent walk year after so many injuries. But even Anthopoulos conceded by late July that Sale had surpassed all expectations. The Braves were careful to give him an extra day or two of rest between starts for most of the season, and Sale stayed healthy until late September. Being scratched just before his scheduled start in a season-ending doubleheader against the New York Mets and missing the Wild Card Series that began the next day left a bitter taste for Sale. He took pride in not missing starts and pitching deep into games, giving his team a chance to win almost every time he pitched. Advertisement He and the Braves said he would’ve been available had the Braves advanced past the first round, and Sale threw a bullpen session at Truist Park two days after the Braves were eliminated — to give the team and himself peace of mind going into the offseason, knowing his back issue was nothing more serious than spasms. Missing that final regular-season start cost him a chance to be the first MLB pitching triple crown winner in nearly two decades, since Johan Santana in 2006. But for Sale, that meant nothing compared to his disappointment over not being available to pitch when his team needed him at the end. So, after winning the first Cy Young Award of his illustrious career, there shouldn’t be any lack of motivation for Sale, not that there might’ve been anyway. Other Braves said he was as good of a teammate as they ever had and the most competitive and driven person they’d ever been around. As veteran first baseman Matt Olson said: “He’s a bulldog on the mound, he prepares the right way and pitches his ass off.” (Photo: Todd Kirkland / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

MLB’s annual international signing period opens up on January 15, meaning Sasaki will not sign before that date. Once Sasaki is posted, he will have 45 days to sign. Those 45 days are a formality, as Sasaki, who is ranked as the third-best player on The Athletic’s Free Agent Big Board, will have no shortage of suitors. Previously, the Chiba Lotte Marines, Sasaki’s club in Nippon Professional Baseball, announced that they will post the 23-year-old righty. Advertisement Because of his age, Sasaki will be considered an international amateur in MLB’s system, meaning that he would make the minimum salary and his bonus will be capped. Every MLB team is assigned a dollar amount to spend on international amateurs and cannot exceed it, although they can trade for some additional space. Teams on the low end are allotted $5.1 million for 2025 and $7.6 million on the high end. Therefore, both Sasaki’s salary and the 20 percent fee that will be paid to the Lotte Marines will be relatively small figures. “I will do my best to climb up from a minor-league contract and become the best player in the world,” Sasaki said in a statement translated by Yakyu Cosmopolitan, “so I have no regrets about my one and only baseball career and can live up to the expectations of everyone who has supported me so far.” (Photo: AP / Eugene Hoshiko) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Sen. Dick Durbin introduces bill to strengthen labor protections for minor league players,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936090/2024/11/20/minor-league-player-labor-bill/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 23:07:55 GMT",The Fair Ball Act is the latest push to improve working conditions for minor league baseball players.,"MLB Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin introduced a bill Wednesday that, if passed, would strengthen labor protections for minor league baseball players. The Fair Ball Act would make minor league players subject to minimum wage and overtime laws if players lacked a collective bargaining agreement. ESPN first reported news of the bill Wednesday. Advertisement The bill aims to roll back a piece of the 2018 Save America’s Pastime Act, which exempted teams from following federal minimum wage and overtime. Under the newly proposed bill, those exemptions would only apply if players were covered by a collective bargaining agreement, which is a contract negotiated directly between a union and its employer. The bill comes two years after minor league players successfully unionized under the Major League Baseball Players Association and achieved a collective bargaining agreement with MLB. But under the Save America’s Pastime Act, minimum wage and overtime laws would not apply if that collective bargaining agreement were to lapse. Durbin’s office said that if that were to happen, players could earn $8,000 less per season. “Workers deserve a fair playing field everywhere — including in baseball,” Durbin said in a statement Wednesday. “Executives at MLB lobbied Congress hard for federal wage and hour law exemptions in order to avoid legal liability with the 2018 Save America’s Pastime Act. While I commend MLB for voluntarily recognizing the unionization of Minor League Baseball players in 2022, it is time to roll back SAPA in deference to the gains made by that historic unionization. I’m proud to stand with these workers, unions, and the integrity of the sport. I stand ready to pass the Fair Ball Act into law.” The Democratic senator said that the goal of the bill is to incentivize MLB to maintain a collective bargaining agreement and to prevent MLB from using the minimum wage and overtime exemptions as leverage during future negotiations. The MLBPA came out in support of the bill Wednesday. “For decades, the living and working conditions faced by Minor League ballplayers were indefensible. Whether in the form of poverty-level wages, substandard living conditions, or inadequate food and nutrition (to name just a few), Minor Leaguers were treated as second-class citizens instead of the world-class athletes that they are,” wrote MLBPA executive director Tony Clark in a letter to Durbin’s office Wednesday. Advertisement “The Fair Ball Act appropriately narrows SAPA so that Minor League ballplayers will be exempted from federal wage and hour laws if and only if their compensation has been determined via good faith collective bargaining,” Clark said. “This is a win for Minor Leaguers, for baseball, and indeed for workers and collective bargaining as a whole.” MLB did not respond to a request for comment. The Fair Ball Act is the latest push to improve working conditions for minor league baseball players. Previously, a group of players brought a class-action lawsuit against MLB claiming minimum wage and overtime violations, which MLB settled for $185 million in 2022. The bill is co-sponsored by Senators Richard Blumenthal, John Hickenlooper, Chris Murphy, Peter Welch and Ron Wyden, and has the support of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations and the National Employment Law Project.

No final decision has been taken and the club are continuing to look into the possibility of expanding and redeveloping St James’, with fans set to be consulted before any firm choice is reached. But Brad Miller, the COO, has given the strongest indication yet that relocation is a live option, stressing it could have twice the earning potential and scope for significantly greater capacity. Advertisement Last year, the club commissioned an in-depth report into the possibilities of extending the present ground — which is the preferred option of many inside the club, including Eddie Howe, the head coach — and alternative sites for a new purpose-built stadium have also been explored. The first phase of the process, which has determined “the art of possible” and the costs involved, according to Miller, is complete, and a “decision stage” is pencilled in for “early” 2025. Miller was speaking on Wednesday evening at the “We Are United” fan event at STACK fan zone, which opened in August and is located outside the Gallowgate End of St James’. He was on stage alongside Darren Eales, the club’s chief executive officer (CEO), Paul Mitchell, the sporting director, Peter Silverstone, the chief commercial officer, and Simon Capper, the chief financial officer. GO DEEPER Newcastle to make decision on St James' Park future in early 2025 Asked about the stadium’s future, and his key role in the decision-making process, Miller said: “It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Do we invest and transform St James’ as we see it today on the site where we are? Or do we take that bold move and think about moving? “We want to make sure it is a very robust process. So regardless of the outcome, I want to stand up in front of everybody throughout the process and say, ‘This is why it is a logical decision, with long-term competitiveness in mind.’ Because as you have heard a lot, it is all about revenue and PSR (the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules). We have to work hard to make sure we give as much money as possible to Paul (Mitchell) and the football side in order to remain competitive on the field. “In terms of next steps, we are coming towards the end of the next stage, the briefing stage. There are a lot of risks and opportunities at St James’. We have to take time to dig into those and make sure we’ve got the devil in the detail — in terms of the programme, how long it will take and what it will do for us in terms of revenue.” The dilemma, according to Miller, is that Newcastle are comparing “apples and pears, not apples and apples” when it comes to rebuilding St James’ or moving to a site nearby. The implication was that the club have narrowed down options, and two of the most serious considerations which are being further explored are “transforming” the present ground so that it looks “amazing” and “earns significantly more money”, or moving close by, to a venue which potentially has “a lot more seats” and has “the potential to earn more than twice as much in terms of revenue.” Advertisement No alternative site was specified, but a move to nearby Leazes Park is a reported option, though that will be controversial and may face challenges, given it is a protected green space. “We have also taken the opportunity to look at what will a new stadium look like,” Miller said. “It’s not comparing apples with apples, they are not like for like. It’s comparing apples with pears. “The brilliant thing about St James’ is it is in an iconic location, the atmosphere and the competitive edge it gives the team on the pitch, and it has 52,000 seats already. “But a new stadium doesn’t have that and we’d have to pay for all those seats again. A new stadium has the potential to earn a lot more, both on matchdays and non-matchdays, a bit like STACK. It is giving us an indication that we can actually contribute even more to the football club and football side if we had a new stadium.” GO DEEPER Every Premier League club's stadium plans - from new stands to ground moves (Top image: Catherine Ivill – AMA/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Instead, Ruderman’s parents took him to Dodger Stadium for Game 1 of the World Series, where Freddie Freeman famously (or infamously, depending on who you ask) hit a walk-off grand slam on a pitch from Nestor Cortes in the bottom of the 10th inning. The Dodgers went on to win the series against the Yankees 4-1, with Freeman its MVP. Ruderman and his father grabbed Freeman’s grand slam ball once it landed in the right-field pavilion. Now, SCP Auctions in Southern California is auctioning off the ball in December.  In October, Goldin auctioned off Shohei Ohtani’s 50th home run ball for a record-setting $4.392 million. SCP said that Ohtani’s auction makes Freeman’s ball “easily worth seven figures.” Investment firm UC Capital bought Ohtani’s ball and put it on display in Taiwan. The Ruderman family said they hope Freeman’s ball will similarly become available to the public.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Senators GM Steve Staios believes in this group, but how patient should he be?",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935590/2024/11/20/senators-staios-ullmark-tkachuk-jensen/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 21:42:01 GMT","Senators GM Steve Staios doesn't see any ""glaring area"" that needs to be fixed with the team at the moment.","NHL Ottawa Senators GM Steve Staios doesn’t think his team’s 8-9-1 record is a “dire situation” even if it’s below his expectations. But while Staios understands a team’s development could take time, there are subtle signs that waiting for his team to take the next step isn’t easy for the general manager, either. Advertisement “I don’t know if I’m preaching patience,” Staios said. “I’m preaching that we address some issues as a group. When a process like this is going along, it takes some time. I guess I am talking about patience here. But some of the bigger mistakes, I think, as teams go through these phases at this point in time are to make decisions that are for today.” If you’re a Senators fan hoping the team makes a significant change soon to escape its middling record, Wednesday afternoon wasn’t your day. Staios addressed the Ottawa media on Wednesday afternoon, delivering a quarter-mark state of the union as the Senators are in the midst of a three-game losing streak. Here’s the biggest takeaway. While Staios, like every NHL GM, is open to making something happen if the deal is right, he’s confident in the group because he’s seen them play to their potential. Just as captain Brady Tkachuk said Tuesday night — he had a maintenance day Wednesday, explaining his absence from practice — it’s all about doing it over and over again. GO DEEPER 'I think we can beat any team': Senators are showing what they can be “I don’t see any glaring area where I think that this group needs a great deal of improvement because they’ve shown it,” Staios said. “Now, about showing it consistently and the things we’ve talked about and what we’ve addressed, I guess time will tell. I think every general manager is doing their job by always looking to see if there’s anything that you can do. I can’t see one major area with this group because they’ve shown how they can play in certain games this year, in the majority of the games this year, that would need to be addressed.” Unfortunately for Staios and the Senators, patience won’t resonate with a fan base more than three years removed from the previous GM saying the rebuilding days were over. Staios has a point in wanting this group to see it through. Per Natural Stat Trick, the Senators are a good team at five-on-five. The Sens have the sixth best Corsi rate, fourth best expected goals rate and second best expected goals-against. Some data supports the fact that the Senators should be better than what they currently are. Advertisement It just hasn’t happened enough. Sens fans, meanwhile, haven’t shed that familiar dread that has become a yearly occurrence. You can’t blame fans for feeling uneasy about their team letting wins against top teams slip while putting up poor performances against teams lower in the standings. “We’re 8-9-1 and they keep score for a reason,” Staios said. “Do I think we’ve played better than that? Sure. I think for us to figure out, as a group, why that’s our record is what we’re trying to unlock. For the majority of the games, I think to me and most people, the team looks and feels like not only a competitive team but a playoff-looking team. And we’ve proven it against good teams.” Or wondering why their team allows goals in quick succession the way they do. “I look at how many times we’ve given up a goal and then another goal within — a lot of them are in a short period of time — five minutes and there’s a handful already this year,” Staios said. “You look at it last year during this time of year, that happened last year as well. And you can go back to the year before and that happened as well.” Or seeing that “immaturity” is a theme for a squad whose core isn’t a baby-faced nucleus needing time to come into its own. “What’s been addressed with the group is that we’re still trying to figure out the mental resolve of the game, and how to be better in certain situations in games and how to deal with adversity throughout games,” Staios said. “Each game is going to be a little bit different. Fast, physical. Officiating might not go your way as evidenced a couple of games ago. How do we deal with that? That’s the next challenge for this group.” Or that the team’s longstanding goaltending issue remains, well, an issue. The Senators rank eighth-worst in team save percentage (.888) and 19th in goals-against per game (3.22). After some strong early showings, Linus Ullmark could stand to improve after allowing 10 goals in his last two starts. Advertisement “Could be better,” Staios said. “We certainly have faith in both of them and I think they’ve proven it. You can ask each individual.” The good thing about having fresh eyes to look over a situation is that you’re able to provide a different perspective. Staios is that fresh set of eyes, having been on the job for a calendar year plus 20 days. But Sens fans have been here longer. And they’ve seen their team fall short in and out of the rebuilding era that has dominated the late 2010s and 2020s. Staios might have been better off exclaiming explicitly that the Senators’ start isn’t sufficient for where this team wants to be, even if he might be right that the roster as constructed is still worth believing in. To that end, the Senators should still add another defenceman and a scoring winger. But even if Staios was hungry to make a move, the Senators only have $1.3 million in cap space to play with. And a deal for either of those pieces would mean moving a key cog. “As we move along, if there are some decisions that can help us today and move us forward as well, I’m open to it,” Staios said. “I’m in discussions all the time about different strategies we can look at. But again, the group has played some good hockey and has proven against some good teams that they’re up for the challenge.” Then, as Staios himself said on Wednesday: “It’s time to get the results.” (Top photo of Steve Staios: Chris Tanouye / Freestyle Photography / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

It has been a true privilege to work alongside all of them. The lifelong friendships that were created mean the world to us.” McElwain spent four seasons as the offensive coordinator at Alabama under Nick Saban — and was part of two national championship teams (2009, 2011) — before getting his first head coaching job, at Colorado State. He guided the Rams to a 22-16 record from 2012 through 2014 and then returned to the SEC as the head coach at Florida. McElwain had an eventful two-plus seasons in Gainesville. He became the first coach to lead his team to the SEC Championship Game in each of his first two seasons. His Gators lost them both to Alabama, but he was the league’s coach of the year in 2015.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Blue Jays offseason has been quiet, but there's still time to make an impact",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935794/2024/11/20/blue-jays-offseason-update/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:35:20 GMT",The Blue Jays haven't made much news so far this offseason. That will have to change soon if they are going to meet their stated goals.,"MLB TORONTO — In this job, there is often a nagging thought in the back of your mind that something newsworthy will happen precisely at the moment you’re not available. So, naturally, as I was preparing for my recent vacation, I wondered: Will the Blue Jays extend Vladimir Guerrero Jr. while I’m away? As it turned out, I had nothing to worry about. The Blue Jays not only didn’t sign Guerrero to a long-term contract extension during my two weeks exploring Costa Rica, but they didn’t really get up to much of anything at all. Advertisement Indeed, it has been a quiet offseason thus far for the Blue Jays, though that may not last for long. Once again, Toronto is being positioned as an aggressive buyer, eager to make a big move or two this winter in an attempt to restore the club to playoff-worthy status after its dismal 74-win season in 2024. The Blue Jays have been mentioned among the teams pursuing top free agent Juan Soto, who they tried to trade for last season before the San Diego Padres shipped him to the New York Yankees. The 26-year-old is expected to command a deal north of $600 million and the Soto sweepstakes is drawing comparisons to the pursuit of Shohei Ohtani, which, of course, memorably ended in heartbreak for the Blue Jays and their fans. But after last year’s offseason lacked serious punch after missing out on Ohtani, the Blue Jays can’t risk failing to pivot to a viable alternate plan, should Project Acquire Soto be unsuccessful. This offseason needs to include an impactful add, even if it means pivoting to Plan B, C or D. The Yankees and New York Mets stand as the favourites to sign Soto, but a dark horse team like the Blue Jays, at a critical point in their window of contention and eager to return to the postseason, could disrupt the expected status quo — especially if they are again willing to meet the astronomical price tag, as they reportedly were for Ohtani. However, The Athletic’s Ken Rosenthal recently argued that without Guerrero — or Bo Bichette — committed to the club long term, Soto may not view the Blue Jays as secure an option as other teams, like the Yankees or Mets, who have higher ranked farm systems than the Blue Jays, per MLB Pipeline. Much like where he’ll ultimately land, it is anyone’s guess as to when Soto will decide. MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand recently reported the superstar may be eager to ink his nine-figure deal by the end of next month’s Winter Meetings. Advertisement If the Blue Jays fail to land Soto, the best bat on the market, they will need to pivot to other names and acquiring at least one of the other top free agents feels like a necessity, given their desperate need to reignite their offence. The other top free-agent hitters who could be fits include Alex Bregman, Willy Adames, Pete Alonso, Anthony Santander, Teoscar Hernández, Christian Walker or Tyler O’Neill. Acquiring bullpen arms also remains a priority for the Blue Jays, too. GO DEEPER Top 45 MLB free agents for 2024-25 with contract predictions, team fits: Will Soto get $600M+? In more recent news, on Tuesday, Toronto opted not to add any prospects to its 40-man roster ahead of the deadline to protect players eligible for next month’s Rule 5 Draft. The move wasn’t wholly surprising as the Blue Jays didn’t have any top prospects who were Rule 5 eligible this year. But that will leave players such as Damiano Palmegiani, Eddinson Paulino and Dasan Brown available to be selected by another team on Dec. 11 for a $100,000 fee. The Blue Jays roster, meanwhile, sits at 40, but that could change later this week. The deadline to tender contracts to arbitration-eligible players is this Friday and the Blue Jays have a few key decisions to make. Relievers Jordan Romano and Erik Swanson are among the players who could fall under consideration to be non-tendered. Based on MLB Trade Rumors projected arbitration salaries, Romano is due to make $7.75 million in 2025, but uncertainty about his status after missing nearly the entire 2024 season with an elbow injury that ultimately required surgery could lead the Blue Jays to cut ties with their closer. The decision on Swanson, who is projected to make a more palatable $3.2 million, will come down to whether the Blue Jays believe he can be a more effective reliever than he was in the first half of 2024, when his ERA ballooned to 9.20 in 14 2/3 innings and led to his demotion to the minors. Advertisement There are a handful of other players on the Blue Jays roster who have a murky future with them and could be a casualty of further roster culling, either this week or in the future when the Blue Jays acquire players, including Dillon Tate, Brett de Geus, Easton Lucas, Tommy Nance, Nick Robertson, Nick Raposo and Steward Berroa. MLB’s offseason has been quiet, but as the Winter Meetings approach in less than three weeks, the expectation is that business will pick up. And with the Blue Jays’ stated goal to improve their roster in an effort to return to competitive relevancy, the club needs to back up those words and be in the midst of the action.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Future of 'The Michael Kay Show' in limbo: Sources,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935789/2024/11/20/michael-kay-show-espn-new-york-radio/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:31:00 GMT","If Kay were to move to mid-days, then the leading candidates for the afternoon spot are Don La Greca and Alan Hahn, according to sources.","Sports Business After nearly two decades as a staple of New York Sports radio in the afternoon drive, the future of “The Michael Kay Show” is in limbo as host Michael Kay and ESPN negotiate, sources briefed on the discussions said Wednesday. With Kay’s contract ending in the middle of December, ESPN has indicated a desire to keep him on the air, but has yet to make a concrete offer for him to remain in drive time, the sources said. Advertisement ESPN and Kay declined to comment. Two years ago, Kay threatened to leave afternoons before then head of programming, Norby Williamson, gave Kay a multi-million dollar deal to keep him. This time, one of ESPN’s top executives, David Roberts, is at the helm. Kay could remain on ESPN’s air with a lighter schedule. He could move to 1-3 p.m. with a work-from-home arrangement to continue opining on New York sports. If this happens, he is expected to be a solo act. There is a remote chance of a complete reversal and the afternoon trio of Kay, Don La Greca and Peter Rosenberg stays together. It is unclear if Kay’s show would continue to be simulcast on YES. However it plays out, Kay will remain the voice of the New York Yankees on the network. The Kay decision will have an impact throughout the station. Kay, La Greca and Rosenberg were the trio that upended WFAN’s Mike Francesa’s long run of rating superiority. If Kay were to move to mid-days, then the leading candidates for the afternoon spot are La Greca and Alan Hahn, according to sources briefed on the plans. Rosenberg also has an expiring contract but could be left without a chair in the La Greca-Hahn scenario. Rosenberg has other jobs, as he is a morning host on Hot 97 and is on WWE telecasts. Hahn currently works with former Jet Bart Scott on ESPN New York mid-days. Scott would potentially continue with Dan Graca on a 10-1 slot, the sources said. That would mean Mike Greenberg’s show would not be on 880 AM in New York anymore. It has been a period of transition for a few years for ESPN New York. ESPN has an agreement with Craig Karmazin’s Good Karma that it provides the content for the station, while Karmazin’s company does all the backend marketing and sales, as well as provides the radio signal. Earlier this year, ESPN New York relinquished its home on 98.7 FM and struck a deal with Audacy, the parent company of WFAN, to land on 880 AM. It has also stopped paying and subscribing for Nielsen Audio ratings. It created a separate ESPN New York app, where most of its focus is aimed.

If Kay were to leave afternoons, it would be the end of a golden era of New York sports radio that was heightened by the ratings war between Kay and Francesa, which at times was like 10th and 11th professional teams in the market. Listeners and fans would eagerly await every quarterly report to see which side won the contest. Francesa left afternoons years ago. Now, it may be the 63-year-old Kay’s time to move on.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Yankees’ Hal Steinbrenner on Juan Soto battle with Mets’ Steve Cohen: 'I know what's expected of me',https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935780/2024/11/20/yankees-juan-soto-hal-steinbrenner-mets-free-agency/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:13:28 GMT",The Yankees owner discussed the Soto sweepstakes and a number of other offseason topics during a break at the MLB owners' meetings.,"NEW YORK — On Tuesday, the two billionaires at the center of Major League Baseball’s biggest offseason free-agent chase stood across from each other at a dinner marking the first night of the owners’ meetings in Manhattan. But New York Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner and Steve Cohen, his New York Mets rival, didn’t quite argue over who should get to drop a bag of cash in front of star slugger Juan Soto. Instead, much of the conversation between the longtime acquaintances centered around the Yankees’ loss in the World Series, and how much it still “stings” for Steinbrenner. Advertisement “That was about it,” Steinbrenner said. Yet the specter of Cohen — baseball’s richest owner — possibly swooping in and swiping Soto from the Yankees was the biggest topic of conversation when Steinbrenner spoke with reporters for approximately 15 minutes in the lobby of MLB headquarters Wednesday afternoon. If Soto doesn’t re-sign with the Yankees, will it hurt even more if he opts for a crosstown move and the Mets’ big bucks? “If it doesn’t work out,” Steinbrenner said, “it’s going to hurt a little bit no matter where he goes.” Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner meeting with reporters at the MLB Owners Meetings today. Juan Soto, expectedly, was the hot topic of conversation. pic.twitter.com/24wynEMJ42 — Brendan Kuty 🧟‍♂️ (@BrendanKutyNJ) November 20, 2024  The Athletic’s Tim Britton projected that Soto, 26, could command a deal worth $611 million over 13 years, which would be the biggest average annual value in the history of the game. There has been speculation that Soto could look, in some way, to top the heavily deferred 10-year, $700-million deal the Los Angeles Dodgers gave Shohei Ohtani last year. But the youngest son of late owner George Steinbrenner said he understood his mission. He knows that losing Soto would be a disaster to a fan base starving for its first World Series title since 2009. He knows that while Cohen may be the wealthiest man in baseball, the Yankees make the most money. “I’ve got ears,” Steinbrenner said. “I know what’s expected of me. It’s been a priority.” The Soto sweepstakes kicked into high gear last week with representatives from the Mets, Boston Red Sox and Toronto Blue Jays each flying to meet with Soto and his agent, Scott Boras, near Boras’ headquarters in Newport Beach, Calif. The Dodgers also met with Soto and the Philadelphia Phillies were expected to as well. Advertisement On Monday, the Yankees joined the race. During the meeting, Steinbrenner was flanked by general manager Brian Cashman, team president Randy Levine, special assistant Omar Minaya and manager Aaron Boone. The group met with Soto for “a couple of hours,” Steinbrenner said. It’s unclear how much pomp and circumstance the Yankees included in a presentation to a player they already know so well. Soto just finished the best season of his seven-year career with the Yankees. After the club traded for him last winter, he proved more than equipped to be able to play in New York, setting career-highs in home runs (41) and runs scored (128) while batting ahead of fellow star Aaron Judge. The sides had a “very honest back-and-forth dialogue” that Steinbrenner called “a good meeting.” He said that Soto, in particular, quizzed the Yankees on their player development system and upcoming prospects. The Yankees, however, didn’t leave the meeting with any particular picture of which way Soto was leaning. Steinbrenner declined to say whether contract size was discussed. “No idea,” Steinbrenner said. “We’ll be in the mix.” And Cohen will be threatening. The Mets had a surprising 2024, starting the season slow before reaching the National League Championship Series. Cohen, estimated by Forbes to be worth $21.3 billion, will be motivated to give his club more firepower. And Soto is a rare type of free agent, combining youth with top-of-the-line offensive ability. Yankees fans worry that Cohen could write Soto a blank check. “I would say that about a couple other owners, too, or corporations for that matter that represent ownership groups,’ Steinbrenner said. “Of course, it’s a concern.” But it’s unclear whether Soto will simply go to the highest bidder, like many Boras clients, or if he’ll value other things. Soto, a Dominican Republic native, reportedly would prefer to play on the East Coast. Plus, he’s coming off a trip to the World Series with the Yankees, a team about which he spoke glowingly during the regular season. Advertisement “He’s been here, and he had a good year,” Steinbrenner said. “He did great dealing with you guys. He did great dealing with the fans. He did great with the other players. His experience here was positive, there’s no doubt about that. How much that factors in, I can’t answer that.” In May, Steinbrenner declared that the 2024 payroll was unsustainable. This year marked the first time in franchise history that the Yankees surpassed $300 million. After factoring in the luxury tax penalty, the team’s total payroll for this season will approach $375 million. The estimated payroll for 2025 currently stands at $238.8 million, according to Cot’s Contracts. While the Yankees are in a stronger starting position compared to last year’s offseason, a significant portion of their budget is earmarked for Soto. Steinbrenner reiterated the “unsustainable” sentiment, stating that this year’s payroll would be impossible to maintain for most — if not all — other team owners. However, he did indicate that he would remain open to any proposal Cashman brings forward, but he stopped short of offering up any number that he has in mind for the budget. “We’ve got the ability to sign any player that we would like to sign,” Steinbrenner said. The Yankees exercised manager Aaron Boone’s club option for 2025 nearly two weeks ago. When Boone spoke to the media shortly after the announcement, he revealed that he had not yet discussed a long-term extension. Steinbrenner said that those talks will likely happen once the team’s offseason plans are more settled. “I don’t know if there’s a huge rush to it,” he said, “but I will have those discussions on what to do next.” Steinbrenner and the Yankees’ front office have not indicated over the past several years that they desire to make a managerial change. It would be a surprise if Boone does not enter the 2025 season with a new contract. Advertisement The first major problem the Yankees addressed this offseason was Gerrit Cole’s decision to opt out of his contract. After discussions, both Cole and the Yankees agreed to maintain the terms of his current deal without adding a fifth year and an additional $36 million. Steinbrenner explained that “a number of factors” made him uncomfortable with the idea of extending Cole for a fifth year, which would have kept him under contract through his age-38 season. With only 48 hours to decide on Cole’s opt-out, Steinbrenner stated that the limited timeframe was not enough to properly consider the addition of a fifth year. “But let me just say that doesn’t reflect in any way, shape or form what we think of Gerrit,” Steinbrenner said. “We want Gerrit to be a Yankee for life. I think he’s someone who wants to be a Yankee for life. Adding one more year or not adding one more year should have no meaning when it comes to that.” Finally, Steinbrenner addressed the World Series loss to the Dodgers, admitting that, weeks later, it still stings. He believes that falling so close to the club’s first championship since 2009 will weigh on them throughout the rest of the offseason. One narrative he pushed back against was the team’s perceived lack of fundamentals. Since the Yankees’ disastrous fifth inning of Game 5, Dodgers players, fans, and baseball media have criticized them for sloppy play. While the Yankees were the worst baserunning team during the regular season, they actually were rated above average defensively, even ranking higher than the Dodgers in most advanced metrics. “I do not agree with that,” Steinbrenner said of the criticism. “Listen, we did not play a clean World Series. I think we all know that. Those fundamentals got us to the World Series. Our play, for the most part, was solid during the course of the year. That’s why we won a pennant for the first time in 15 years. No doubt in the World Series — they just played better than us.” (Top photo of Juan Soto: Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,World Cup winner Juan Mata joins ownership group of San Diego FC,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5934862/2024/11/20/juan-mata-san-diego-fc-owner/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:00:36 GMT","Mata, 36, was a World Cup winner with Spain and plays for Australian side Western Sydney Wanderers.","MLS San Diego FC (SDFC) has announced the addition of former Manchester United and Chelsea midfielder Juan Mata as a partner in its ownership group. This makes the World Cup winner the first active international soccer player to hold an ownership stake in Major League Soccer (MLS). Mata, 36, is also only the second international player to be involved in MLS ownership after David Beckham, who has a stake in co-owner of Inter Miami. Argentina great Lionel Messi is currently playing for Miami, but as part of the deal he signed last year will have an ownership stake in the team once he stops playing. Advertisement “Joining San Diego FC as a partner is an exciting opportunity to help build something truly special in a city and league that are experiencing incredible growth,” said Mata, who also invests in Formula 1 team Alpine Racing Ltd. “I look forward to contributing my experience and passion for the game and working alongside everyone here to build a club that inspires both on and off the pitch.” This is not Mata’s first involvement with SDFC, as his humanitarian Common Goal initiative has been partnered with the Right to Dream (RTD) organisation, run by team owner Sir Mohamed Mansour, since 2018. The Common Goal initiative, founded in 2017, asks all members (including 146 football players) to pledge at least 1 per cent of their salary to social causes relating to football, and shares the wider goals of Mansour’s RTD, founded in 1999, driving change on and off the pitch from their five academies worldwide. “We are absolutely delighted that Juan Mata has joined the club as a partner,” said SDFC chairman Mansour. “He shares our values of wanting to use football to deliver long-term social impact and change.” Part of Spain’s golden generation that won the 2010 World Cup, Mata’s career honours include numerous domestic titles in Spain, England, Turkey and Japan. “Juan embodies excellence and purpose in everything he does,” added SDFC CEO Tom Penn. “His passion for using football as a force for good resonates deeply with our vision for our SDFC and our community, and we couldn’t be more thrilled to welcome him to our club.” Mata signed for Australian side Western Sydney Wanderers in September and has featured in all four of their 2024-25 A-League matches. San Diego’s ownership group led by Mansour was awarded MLS expansion rights in May 2023 and the team will begin competing in the league in the 2025 season, which starts in February.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Italy wins Billie Jean King Cup, crowning Jasmine Paolini's incredible year",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935690/2024/11/20/italy-billie-jean-king-cup-jasmine-paolini/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 19:48:57 GMT",Last year's runners-up went one better in Malaga to lift the 'world cup of tennis',"Tennis MALAGA, Spain — Aryna Sabalenka ends the year as women’s world No. 1, but anyone could make a convincing argument for Jasmine Paolini as WTA player of the year. After two Grand Slam finals, a new career high of world No. 4 and an Olympic gold medal in women’s doubles with compatriot Sara Errani, Paolini is a Billie Jean King Cup champion. She secured the title for Italy by winning the decisive rubber against Slovakia’s Rebecca Sramkova on Wednesday night, giving her country a 2-0 victory in the final. Advertisement It’s a remarkable season for a player who started the year ranked No. 30, never going beyond the third round at a major. “Impossible,” Paolini said when asked what she would have thought of a season like this a year ago, having just lost the Billie Jean King Cup final to Canada. “This year was crazy, and to finish like that, it’s a dream,” she said. Paolini is an architect of Italy’s first Billie Jean King Cup title since 2013, around the time when the country had four women in Slam finals and the world’s top 10. One of those women was Errani, who more than played her part in Italy’s success here, winning two doubles rubbers with Paolini in the quarters and semis. Her underarm serve on match point against Iga Swiatek’s Poland Monday to clinch a place in the final will be etched into tennis folklore. GO DEEPER Forza, forza, forza: In tennis' ""big"" era, Jasmine Paolini proves that a little can mean a lot There was no doubles in the final because Paolini’s 6-2, 6-1 win over Sramkova gave the Italians an unassailable lead after Lucia Bronzetti beat Viktoria Hruncakova 6-2, 6-4 in the first tie. World No. 78 Bronzetti was not selected for Italy’s quarter final against Japan on Saturday and had never played a Billie Jean King Cup singles match before this week, but she came in for the semifinal and final and won in straight sets on both occasions. These team competitions have a habit of turning previously unheralded players into heroes, and Bronzetti has been on that journey over these last few days. After beating Hruncakova — the world No. 281 who has become a hero herself for Slovakia — Italian supporters packed into the Palacio de Deportes Jose Maria Martin Carpena serenaded her with chants of “Lucia! Lucia!” Bronzetti looked constantly at team captain Tathiana Garbin for inspiration during the match, and her role should not be overlooked. Garbin has helped to foster an environment that is both fun and demanding, and said in a news conference after the matches that: “I have to say again how proud (I am) of these human beings, not just the champions they are.” “And I think the important thing, for all my players, is that they smile during the competition. It’s not easy in the tough moments. I think it is the goal of every captain to have a team like this. I’m so proud of them,” she said. Italy went into the final as favorites, with Slovakia upsetting three Grand Slam nations to get there. The Italians knew that by winning they would be the champions of both the Billie Jean King Cup and the Davis Cup — at least for a few days — with tennis in Italy on a high after Jannik Sinner’s dominant season and Paolini’s incredible ascent. GO DEEPER The crowd of Turin: Jannik Sinner's sea of green, white, red and orange Bronzetti set the Italian women on their way with her win against Hruncakova. The opening exchanges were edgy, with both players giving up breaks, but Bronzetti’s forehand started to do some damage while Hruncakova was spraying errors. She hit four unforced errors in the first set compared to just nine winners. Hruncakova recovered well in the second set and started to dominate with her greater weight of shot, but after missing two points for 5-2 she didn’t win another game. The errors returned and the footwork slowed as Bronzetti reeled off the last 10 points of the match to claim the opening rubber. It was over to Paolini to secure the tie and achieve the winning moment in singles that has eluded her in a Grand Slam final. Those defeats at Roland Garros and Wimbledon to Swiatek and Barbora Krejcikova must have been somewhere in her mind — although with Paolini’s inherently positive demeanor it would be impossible to tell. She was clinical here. After a tight opening, Paolini accelerated to the finish line and from 2-2 in the first set won five straight games to open up a 6-2, 2-0 lead. By the time she’d closed things out not long after she had won 10 out of the final 11 games. A remarkably clean performance after last year, when she lost the decisive rubber that gave Canada the title and consigned Italy to the runner-up podium. As Sramkova missed one final return she let out an involuntary yelp of celebration, and moments later Paolini was dancing with her team-mates and hoisting an Italian flag. A fitting end to a truly unforgettable year and a fitting reward for Italy, who will hope that their men’s players can match the feat later this week.

High School and a teammate of top quarterback prospect Bryce Underwood, has flipped his commitment from Pittsburgh to Michigan. Dotson is the No. 2 prospect in Michigan and the No. 200 player in the 247Sports Composite in the Class of 2025. He’s a versatile athlete with a background in track who can play safety, cornerback or wide receiver at 6 feet 2 and 180 pounds. He committed to Pitt in May over Michigan, Michigan State and Penn State but visited Michigan earlier this month and was among the top targets for the Wolverines as the December signing period approaches. Advertisement Landing a commitment from Dotson helps offset the loss of Ivan Taylor, a four-star defensive back who flipped from Michigan to Alabama earlier this week. It also can’t hurt in Michigan’s pursuit of Underwood, the five-star quarterback who’s been committed to LSU since January. Michigan has upped its pursuit of Underwood in recent weeks, resulting in a decommitment from four-star quarterback Carter Smith. Underwood hasn’t commented on rumored NIL offers but posted a graphic on social media indicating he planned to stick with LSU. Belleville’s season ended Friday with a loss to Detroit Catholic Central in the quarterfinals of the state playoffs. Dotson gives Michigan 19 commitments in a 2025 recruiting class that sits at No. 12 in the composite rankings. Even with Taylor’s flip to Alabama, Michigan has commitments from a strong group of defensive backs that includes top-100 cornerback Shamari Earls, four-star safety/nickel Kainoa Winston and four-star cornerback Jayden Sanders. Safety could be the ultimate landing spot for Dotson, who has the size to play in the box and doesn’t shy away from contact.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Bruins' Don Sweeney on Jim Montgomery firing: 'Had to change course' — but blame is 'team-wide',https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935705/2024/11/20/don-sweeney-jim-montgomery-firing/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 19:25:34 GMT","The Bruins GM said the team's failures this season are ""confounding to me in looking at every little area of our group"" — not just coaching.","NHL BRIGHTON, Mass. — Don Sweeney did not want to fire Jim Montgomery. The Boston Bruins general manager acknowledged on Wednesday that earlier this year, he even offered Montgomery a contract extension.  But after 20 games of underperformance, Sweeney determined he had no choice but to let the team’s third-year coach go. Advertisement “It came from a decision of our team really not just performing to the level of expectations we have grown to appreciate as a fan of the sporting community here,” Sweeney said on Wednesday. “For me, I just had to change course.” The Bruins have underachieved in just about every component: goaltending, five-on-five offense, power play, penalty kill, discipline. In Sweeney’s mind, at least 10 players have failed to meet expectations, including Elias Lindholm, Brad Marchand, David Pastrnak, Jeremy Swayman and Nikita Zadorov.  The thing Sweeney can’t figure out is why. “It’s team-wide,” Sweeney said. “That’s where it’s confounding to me in looking at every little area of our group. We need to be better, from structure on out. We need to make our players understand that’s not the standard.” By Sweeney’s reasoning, Pastrnak’s injury at the World Championships and Marchand’s three offseason procedures partly explain why their production is down. As one of the two primary participants in Swayman’s negotiations along with agent Lewis Gross, Sweeney believes missing camp is a factor in the goalie’s shoddy play. “We fully expect him to get back there,” Sweeney said. “Now how much time that takes because of camp, I don’t know. At the end of the day, reps are reps. Even if you’ve tried to convince yourself that you might be there, it’s no different than Brad missing some quality time and working your way back in games. It’s just hard to do that.” Sweeney referred to the Bruins’ bad camp several times. He guessed that some players believed things would come easier given prior success. Montgomery did not do enough to correct the attitude. As for Lindholm and Zadorov, his primary offseason signings, Sweeney is not second-guessing bringing in the free agents. It is simply that Lindholm (nine points) and Zadorov (NHL-high 13 minor penalties) are not providing proper returns on investment. Advertisement “I don’t think there’s a concern that they’re not a good fit,” Sweeney said. “They have not played to the level we expected them to.” By replacing Montgomery with interim coach Joe Sacco, Sweeney’s mandate to the team is to improve the work ethic, play with better structure and hold each other more accountable. The turnaround begins on Thursday against the Utah Hockey Club. Despite being underwater in multiple categories, the Bruins have 19 points, just outside the wild-card window. “We’re going to find out what this team is capable of based on where we’re at right now with 60 games to go,” said Sweeney. “There’s a lot of season. But you can’t stay in neutral.” Sweeney hopes Montgomery’s ouster will provide a performance bounce. Otherwise, the GM will send players out the door behind Montgomery.  “Moving forward, that rests with me now,” Sweeney said. “From a personnel standpoint, from the players’ standpoint, they have to understand they’re not where they need to be. We’re either going to get back there. Or there are going to be continued changes across the board.” (Photo of Don Sweeney: Bruce Bennett / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Evans has missed the team’s last three games with a hamstring injury. Evans was forced to exit Tampa Bay’s Week 7 game against the Baltimore Ravens, just after becoming the 11th player in NFL history to record 100 receiving touchdowns and the fifth to catch them all with the same team. He was able to walk off the field and into the locker room under his own power and was diagnosed with what Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles referred to as a “moderate” hamstring injury. Advertisement The Buccaneers have certainly felt the absence of Evans, as well as fellow veteran receiver Chris Godwin, who was carted off the field in the same game Evans exited. After a 4-3 start with Evans and Godwin, the Buccaneers lost their next three games without the veteran duo — all in a one-score loss. Tampa Bay went from averaging 248.3 passing yards per game and a seventh-best 0.153 EPA per dropback through their first seven weeks to 208 yards per game and a 16th-ranked 103.2 EPA per dropback over the last four, according to RBSDM. Evans, who had not missed a game since the 2022 season, served as one of Baker Mayfield’s favorite targets since the quarterback arrived in Tampa Bay. Evans accounts for 181 of Mayfield’s 889 targeted passes, a 20.4 percent target share second only to Godwin. In Evans’ absence, Mayfield and the Buccaneers have been forced to rely on increased [assing work to their tight ends and running backs while introducing new faces off the street like Sterling Shepard. Now, Evans is set to help get the Buccaneers back on track against a New York Giants team that is 31st in the league in defensive passing DVOA against WR1s and just benched quarterback Daniel Jones for former third-stringer Tommy DeVito. At 4-6, Tampa Bay currently sits in second place behind a 6-5 Atlanta Falcons team that has already beaten them twice. The Buccaneers currently have a 23 percent chance to make the playoffs and a 14 percent chance to win their division, according to The Athletic’s playoff projection model. Mayfield’s EPA per dropback and passer rating when Evans plays in Weeks 1-7: 0.12 and 107.1. Mayfield’s EPA per dropback and passer rating in Weeks 8-11: 0.10 and 96.3. So it’s not like Mayfield fell completely off the map without Evans and Godwin. But there’s zero question the Buccaneers managed to fall off after losing the game versus the Ravens, where Evans injured himself enough to miss time, and then lost every other one since. Advertisement The teams the Bucs faced in that four-game stretch weren’t slouches either (Ravens, Falcons, Chiefs, 49ers). All three losses after Baltimore came by one score, as well. Adding Evans back after the bye week certainly puts Tampa Bay in a position to make a run back into the playoff hunt. The Buccaneers will face the Giants, Panthers and Raiders over the next three weeks, and there’s only one team left on the schedule that currently holds a record of .500 or better — the Los Angeles Chargers. But can Evans play defense, too? That side of the football has been arguably the worst in the league that last few weeks. It will take more than an Evans comeback to push Tampa Bay into the postseason conversation. — Larry Holder, NFL senior writer (Photo: Kevin C.

During his time at North Texas, he led the team to the inaugural USL League One Championship in 2019 and earned USL League One Coach of the Year honors, while coaching current U.S. internationals Ricardo Pepi and Tanner Tessmann. Advertisement The former midfielder enjoyed a 12-year playing career which was most notable for his spells at Tampa Bay Mutiny and Kansas City Wizards. Quill’s appointment comes after a truly disappointing 2024 season for Dallas, one where they missed the postseason for the first time since 2021. Quill was one of three finalists for the job and earned the nod over Luccin, who the club also regarded highly. Quill earned the job in large part due to his experience working with young players and developing talent, which has long been a primary focus at Dallas. He helped develop Pepi, Tessman and fellow Dallas academy prospect Bryan Reynolds into players capable of thriving internationally, and the team is hopeful he can do the same for Dallas’ current batch of homegrowns. A Houston-area native, Quill has long been a fixture in Texas soccer and he brings a built-in knowledge of Dallas’ youth setup to his new role. A quick fun fact: during his playing days as a journeyman midfielder in MLS, Quill was part of arguably the worst team in MLS history, the 2002 Tampa Bay Mutiny. “Honestly,” Quill told me back in 2019, “I’ve blacked most of that season out. Let me get your address before I get off the phone, because I’m going to send you my therapist’s bill.” He’s almost certain to fare better in Dallas. — Pablo Maurer, soccer staff writer (Omar Vega/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Cleveland’s return in the Morgan trade is Alfonsin Rosario from Chicago’s Myrtle Beach affiliate. In a corresponding move, infielder Patrick Wisdom was designated for assignment. Can confirm @JeffPassan report that Cubs have acquired RH reliever Eli Morgan from Cleveland. Morgan isn't a power arm, but a solid middle relief arm. Well-rounded arsenal, strong change. Won't wow you, but gets the job done and can do multi-inning stints. A-ball player is return — Sahadev Sharma (@sahadevsharma) November 20, 2024  Morgan emerged as a key piece in Cleveland’s dominating bullpen this past season, posting a 1.93 ERA in 32 appearances for a 92-win team. He isn’t a power arm, but he has a well-rounded arsenal, a strong changeup and the ability to pitch multiple innings as a reliever. The right-hander is projected to earn $1 million next season through the arbitration system, according to estimates from MLB Trade Rumors. He’s currently under club control through 2027. Morgan, 28, was selected by Cleveland in the eighth round of the 2017 draft out of Gonzaga University. Long known as a pitching-focused organization, Cleveland gave him 18 starts (5.34 ERA) in 2021 before eventually moving him to the bullpen. ﻿ The Cubs entered the offseason knowing they needed to add more stability to their bullpen. Though that group improved over the course of last season, there were too many question marks and blown saves early. And there are no guarantees that the individual success stories will continue next year because relievers’ performances are so volatile. Advertisement The club’s chief decision-makers — a small group that includes Jed Hoyer, Carter Hawkins and Craig Counsell — do not view spending huge amounts of money on relievers as an efficient use of resources. While the front office may be more willing to make bigger investments in the bullpen this winter, the primary strategy will be adding volume and giving Counsell more options.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Why Blue Jackets' Cayden Lindstrom needed back surgery, and how his recovery might go",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935507/2024/11/20/cayden-lindstrom-blue-jackets-back-surgery/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 18:40:18 GMT",Lindstrom's back has been an issue since before the Blue Jackets drafted him in June.,"NHL COLUMBUS, Ohio — Cayden Lindstrom, the Columbus Blue Jackets’ No. 4 overall pick in this year’s draft, had surgery on Tuesday, according to general manager Don Waddell, to remedy a back injury that has plagued the 18-year-old center for most of the last year. Lindstrom has been skating away from the rest of the Blue Jackets in Nationwide Arena for the past month or so, hoping that patience and regular treatment from the medical staff would allow the injury to heal on its own, avoiding surgery. Advertisement “He’s been working and doing everything we’ve asked of him,” Waddell said. “But he’s gotten to a point where he can’t get to 100 percent. He’s 90 percent or so, and so our doctors recommended that he have the procedure. They performed it (on Tuesday).” Per Waddell, doctors performed a microdiscectomy on Lindstrom’s lower back, which has plagued him since the middle of last season when he played with Medicine Hat of the Western Hockey League. A herniated disc can lead to pain and numbness in the legs and extremities, though it’s unclear what Lindstrom was experiencing. According to Johns Hopkins Medicine’s website, the procedure is minimally invasive and involves removing some or all of a bulging disc. In Lindstorm’s case, judging by Waddell’s words, only a portion of the disc was removed “This was a tiny, little fragment they saw on the (magnetic resonance imaging) that they had to shave off,” Waddell said. “It was a very short procedure and everything went well. What they saw (in surgery) is exactly what they thought they would see (after the MRI).” Lindstrom’s agent, Daren Hermiston, wasn’t immediately available to comment. The expectation, Waddell said, is that Lindstrom will fully recover and, hopefully, play again this season. When he’s medically cleared, he’ll be sent back to Medicine Hat for a third season of major junior. “(Doctors) will make him sit and not do a whole lot for 30 days,” Waddell said. “And he’ll continue to do his recovery here in Columbus.”  The Blue Jackets knew of Lindstrom’s injury last summer before the draft. Every NHL club that interviewed Lindstrom leading up to the draft asked him about it, and Hermiston turned over Lindstrom’s medical reports to any club that requested them. Waddell had the Blue Jackets’ medical staff review Lindstrom’s records, he said, before he decided to spend a first-round pick — his first pick as Blue Jackets GM — on the player. At the time, however, the Blue Jackets thought Lindstrom’s injury could heal without surgery. Advertisement “To (Lindstrom’s) credit, he wanted to try and work through it,” Waddell said. “Our doctors were good with that.” But in the five months since, Lindstrom has experienced only partial success. “When we met last week and talked about it, he wanted to make sure he talked with his family and representation first to make sure everybody was 100 percent on board,” Waddell said. “He was in good spirits.” (Photo of Cayden Lindstrom: Jeff Speer / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Advertisement The Cavs have also launched a website — wnbacleveland.com — announcing its bid. If Cleveland’s bid is successful, its new women’s team would play at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse, where the Cavs play downtown, and would practice at the Cleveland Clinic Peak Performance Center, a sparkling new headquarters for the Cavs’ training and business facilities expected to open in 2027. A Cavs source said those two items — playing games at the Fieldhouse, which has undergone massive renovations over the last few seasons, and practicing at the new Cleveland Clinic facility when it opens — are two of the strongest components of Cleveland’s bid. The source said the Cavs had been working directly with the WNBA on a bid for about a year. Because the bidding process is expected to be so competitive, that source said, the league hired investment bank Allen & Company to vet all potential bids. There are at least 10 cities seeking to land the W’s 16th team. If Cleveland were to land a team, it would likely begin in roughly 2027 or 2028. The WNBA played with 12 teams last season; the Golden State Valkyries will begin play next summer and teams have also been awarded to Toronto and Portland, Ore. Barlage — who is chief executive officer for the Cavs, for Gilbert’s entertainment company and for the arena itself — first disclosed the Cavs’ bid to CNBC. Gilbert purchased the Cavs in 2005. The city previously had a WNBA team, the Rockers, from 1997 until 2003, when then-Cavs owner Gordon Gund decided to cease operation of the women’s team and the league could not find another owner.

The operation is scheduled for Thursday and the Eagles believe it’s the best course for Huff to return late in the season in better condition, according to league sources. Advertisement Huff injured his wrist during warmups before a Week 9 win against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He was limited to a season-low six snaps in that game, appearing only in certain blatant pass-rush downs. He wore a hard cast on his left wrist during the next two games and was fairly productive in 26 snaps with a sack and two tackles for loss. But the Eagles signed him to a three-year, $51.1 million contract envisioning him fielding a fuller impact.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Is the Hurricanes' Martin Necas a Hart Trophy contender?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935533/2024/11/20/martin-necas-hart-trophy-hurricanes/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 18:16:52 GMT",Here the pros and cons of Necas' potential MVP candidacy.,"NHL RALEIGH, N.C. — The Winnipeg Jets are off to a hot start, and their Central Division rivals, the Minnesota Wild — led by Kirill Kaprizov — aren’t far behind. Alexander Ovechkin, chasing Wayne Gretzky’s all-timegoals record, was putting the puck in the net more than any other player this season before suffering a knee injury this week. Nathan MacKinnon and Cale Makar have willed the paper-thin Colorado Avalanche to just over .500 while the team gets players back from injuries and waits for its goaltending to arrive. Advertisement Those are arguably the biggest stories of the young NHL season. Notice something missing? It’s the Carolina Hurricanes, who have shrugged off concerns that their offseason departures would lead to them taking a step back. Some even predicted coach Rod Brind’Amour’s team would struggle to make the playoffs for a seventh consecutive season. Instead, Carolina had the league’s second-best record entering Wednesday’s games and has scored at least four goals in 11 of the last 12. A big reason for that is Martin Necas. The 25-year-old right wing is third in the league with 30 points, trailing only MacKinnon and Kaprizov. His 11 goals are tied for 11th in the league, and only four players have more than Necas’ 19 assists. The season isn’t quite 25 percent done, but people are already talking about the Hart Trophy. They’re not, however, mentioning Necas. The Czech winger deserves consideration, so here are the reasons why Necas should be considered one of the front-runners for league MVP, as well as some counterarguments against his case. In the last 23 seasons, the Hart Trophy has gone to a player who finished either first or second in NHL scoring or led the team in goals every year — with three exceptions: goalies Jose Theodore (2001-02) and Carey Price (2014-15), and Taylor Hall (2017-18). If you pile up the points, you can’t be denied consideration, and right now, Necas is making his case near the top of the leaderboard. Necas’ talent is undeniable. Brind’Amour and others in the organization have said before he’s the most skilled player on the roster, but outside of his 71-point season in 2022-23, he’s failed to put it all together. Thirty points in 17 games isn’t a fluke, but can he keep playing at a 140-point pace — nearly twice the output from his best NHL season — for 82 games? Advertisement As mentioned above, the Hurricanes weren’t expected to again be at the top of the NHL standings after a mini-overhaul that saw several key players leave in free agency. Furthermore, could anyone have predicted Carolina being this good with Sebastian Aho still looking for his first even-strength goal a week before Thanksgiving? For @TheAthletic: Sebastian Aho hasn’t yet scored at 5-on-5 this season. What’s the reason for his slow start?https://t.co/GIfpvOkyDl — Cory Lavalette (@corylav) November 15, 2024  The Hurricanes wouldn’t be where they are right now without Necas. While Kaprizov has been dominant for the Wild — second on Minnesota’s scoring list is Matthew Boldy, 14 points behind Kaprizov’s 33 points with 19 — Necas has had the same impact for Carolina. The Hurricanes’ second-leading scorer, Andrei Svechnikov, is also 14 points behind Necas, and only Jack Roslovic — who couldn’t stop scoring at the start of the year but hasn’t found the net or registered a point in his last five games — is within shouting distance with nine. Brind’Amour admitted Necas is “driving the ship” for the Hurricanes right now, but perhaps it’s really the coach who has his team riding high early in the year. No matter what injuries Carolina is stricken with — hello, goaltending depth — or what obstacles the team faces, Brind’Amour guides them through the storm and to success. You’ve heard of players splitting the vote on awards, but could Brind’Amour’s Jack Adams Award case influence the Hart Trophy ballot? Necas is making the most of the four-plus minutes of power-play time he’s getting each night on the top unit. Carolina has made Necas a focal point on the man advantage this year, and it has paid off. His 12 power-play points trail only MacKinnon and Makar, who each have 13 but have played two more games than Necas this season. His eight primary points — goals plus primary assists — trail only Makar’s nine. Advertisement His production has helped the Hurricanes to rank eighth in the league on the power play at 23.7 percent. The Hurricanes’ power play has been much maligned during Brind’Amour’s tenure, but last year, Carolina finished second in the league at 26.9 percent. They did that with Necas playing on the second unit, getting 2:07 of man-advantage ice time last year — 10th overall on the team and ninth if you count Michael Bunting and Jake Guentzel as one power-play entity for the year. The Hurricanes, as a team, had 191 power-play points a year ago. Necas accounted for 13. The Hurricanes showed they could be successful on the power play a year ago with Necas in a limited role, so doing so again this year shouldn’t be a surprise, even if No. 88 is leading the way. The best defense is a good offense, so it makes sense that Necas’ defensive numbers look better this season. His goal for percentage at five-on-five (62.07 percent; 18 for, 11 against) rivals Kaprizov (70 percent; 20-9) and is better than MacKinnon (54.84 percent; 17-14). Eleven goals against in 17 games isn’t fantastic — that projects to 53 goals allowed for an 82-game season — but it’s still on par with last year’s 52. That might not sound like much of a plus, but Necas was on the ice for 46 five-on-five goals for a year ago. Right now, he’s projected to have just under 87. One way Necas could have potentially differentiated himself from MacKinnon and Kaprizov would be to kill penalties. Three seasons ago, Necas played 78 seconds per game on Carolina’s top-ranked PK. A year later, in 2020-21, his short-handed ice time dipped to 58 seconds per game, though the Hurricanes were again near the top of the league at 84.4 percent — second only to Boston. Since then, Necas’ penalty-killing has been essentially nonexistent. He played 27 seconds per game in 2021-22, and then, as Seth Jarvis grabbed more PK minutes, Necas logged a total of 8:28 the following year. This season is about the same — he’s seen 72 seconds on the ice short-handed, and none have been by design. Advertisement Neither Kaprizov (9:39 total short-handed minutes since 2020-21) nor MacKinnon (18:21 total) is relied on to kill penalties, so it’s an area where Necas could have stood out. But even with Jarvis out with an upper-body injury, Necas hasn’t sniffed the PK. Seeing that Necas plays under 18 minutes a game to MacKinnon’s 23:19 and Kaprizov’s 22:11 — second and fourth, respectively, in the league among forwards — he needs to find a way to do more with less to keep up. As mentioned in the first item, it’s often all about the flashy numbers. If Necas can continue on this blistering scoring pace, voters won’t be able to ignore his candidacy. The chances of being a finalist or winner increase if the Hurricanes are near the top of the standings at the end of the regular season, and one could argue that Carolina is better positioned for long-term success than Colorado or Minnesota. MacKinnon and Makar will also have to deal with vote-splitting, which could have hurt MacKinnon last year when he won the Hart but didn’t (Makar finished third in Norris Trophy voting but didn’t receive a single vote for MVP). Kaprizov is the front-runner right now, even if that’s unfair to Necas and all he’s done. He’s long been considered one of the league’s players, and there is often a “it’s his time” trend to voting when all else is equal. He’s received votes for the Hart three times in his four-year NHL career: He finished 17th in 2022-23, seventh the year before, and 15th as a rookie in 2020-21 when he ran away with the Calder Trophy vote as the league’s top rookie. That Necas has never received a vote for any NHL award will hurt him, even if he somehow manages to keep scoring at a 26 percent clip and gets to 130 or 140 points. As I said at the top, it’s early. Necas’ season has been one of the most remarkable starts in team history, and his star turn has taken Carolina from a perceived playoff possibility to a Stanley Cup contender in just 5 1/2 weeks. Even if Necas continues his otherworldly play and isn’t at the top of the heap when April’s ballots are tallied, his explosive season will have been enough to prove wrong many of the doubters — both of him and the Hurricanes.

The Owls’ new coaching search, though, might be the most interesting one of this year’s coaching carousel. And it got a little more interesting this week, as Miami great Ray Lewis has made it known that he really wants to be the Owls’ next coach, a source briefed on Lewis’ thinking said Wednesday. Advertisement The 49-year-old Lewis, a 13-time Pro Bowl linebacker, has observed the model of what Deion Sanders has done transforming Colorado football in the past two years and is expected to present a plan to the Owls’ leadership in the next week for how he’d do something similar at FAU. Lewis’ old buddy, fellow Pro Football Hall of Famer Cris Carter, is the Owls’ executive director of player engagement and is expected to be a good resource for Lewis. A big hurdle for Lewis is, unlike Sanders, he doesn’t have any previous college coaching experience. “Ray wants it bad,” the source briefed on Lewis’ thinking said. Lewis lives five minutes from the FAU campus. “He really wants it.” Lewis, however, is not considered a serious candidate at this point, according to a source involved in the coaching search. The frontrunner for the FAU vacancy, according to multiple sources involved in the search, is Ole Miss offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. The 31-year-old son of former Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis, who lives a half-hour from Boca Raton, is the play caller at a hot Rebels program and runs the nation’s No. 2 offense, putting up 7.58 yards per play. GO DEEPER FAU coaching job profile: What will Tom Herman's replacement inherit? The younger Weis was Kiffin’s former offensive coordinator at FAU and knows the program well. He has a lot of support from some key FAU people, according to sources involved in the search. Kiffin has strong influence back at FAU and will push Weis for the job, those sources said. Financially, Weis — who makes $1.65 million at Ole Miss — might have to take a pay cut to go back to FAU but a source briefed on the matter said he doubted that would stop Weis from wanting this job. Georgia Tech offensive coordinator Buster Faulkner might make more sense for the Owls. The 43-year-old helped turn Tech from the ACC’s No. 11 offense to No. 3 last year. In 2022, the year before he was hired in Atlanta, Georgia Tech ranked last in the ACC in red zone offense. His offense is No. 2 in the ACC in red zone TD percentage. Advertisement Penn State assistant head coach/co-OC Ja’Juan Seider is a well-regarded coach with deep local ties and is expected to get some consideration. The 47-year-old Belle Glade, Fla., product was a star quarterback at Florida A&M and is well-connected around South Florida. Players really respond to him. He also has been a key assistant in Happy Valley, at Marshall and West Virginia. UCF offensive coordinator Tim Harris Jr. has spent his whole coaching career in the state. He was a four-time NCAA All-American in track at Miami and then spent five years as a successful high school coach in South Florida at Miami’s Booker T. Washington High before spending seven seasons at FIU. Since then, he’s coached at Miami and UCF, where he has produced the Big 12’s most prolific offense at 6.76 yards per play. UNLV offensive coordinator Brennan Marion, a former Miami Dolphins wideout who lived in Boynton Beach, not far from the Owls’ campus, might be an intriguing option. He has proven to be a terrific offensive coordinator in two stops at the FCS level before an excellent two-season run of transforming the Rebels into a winning program. Last year he led the Rebels to No. 6 in the country in third down offense and No. 8 in red zone offense despite his starting QB going down early and having to turn to an unproven freshman in Jayden Maiava, who went on to win Mountain West Freshman of the Year honors. This year, the Rebels, with Maiava having left for USC, are No. 6 in the nation in scoring at 39.9 points per game. GO DEEPER What's on Feldman's radar: Everyone's terrified of Ole Miss, and everyone wants an old coach FSU defensive backs coach Pat Surtain could be in play at his alma mater Southern Miss, but he also has strong ties here. He played a decade in the NFL before becoming a top high school coach in South Florida. The 48-year-old spent one season with the Miami Dolphins as an NFL assistant before joining FSU’s staff in 2023. Georgia assistant head coach Todd Hartley, 39, spent three years coaching in South Florida on the Canes’ staff. He is someone Kirby Smart has leaned on in elevating the program since Hartley’s return to Athens in 2019. Southern Miss also has a lot of interest in Hartley for its head coaching vacancy.

He’s had a strong debut season in Durham and also could be in play. Miami defensive ends coach Jason Taylor. The Pro Football Hall of Famer, who had been a high school assistant for five seasons at powerhouse St. Thomas Aquinas, is a legendary figure around South Florida.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,2025 NFL Draft consensus Big Board: Ashton Jeanty joins Travis Hunter in top 5,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935073/2024/11/20/nfl-draft-2025-consensus-rankings-travis-hunter/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 18:05:03 GMT","Last week, The Athletic's Dane Brugler released his updated top 50. How does the consensus board compare?","As the 2025 NFL Draft class continues to take shape, it’s time to take stock of which prospects are going to dominate the early-round conversation for the next few months. Our consensus Big Board combines rankings from a wide range of draft experts to identify how the top prospects are viewed relative to the rest of their class. In theory, by the time we reach draft weekend, these rankings should help give us a handle on how the picks could (or, at least, should) play out. Last week, The Athletic draft expert Dane Brugler released his updated top 50. How does the consensus board compare? A few thoughts on the updated board: The Colorado superstar didn’t open at No. 1 — he was No. 6 when we last did this exercise way back in May. Obviously, things have changed quite a bit since then, for a lot of prospects, but Hunter pretty clearly has earned his spot atop the rankings. (That’s where he was on Brugler’s board last week, too.) Advertisement The question now: Barring an injury, is there anything that could bump Hunter off the podium? It doesn’t feel all that likely, especially in a class that’s perceived to be lacking an elite-tier quarterback. Colorado’s playoff push will only elevate the stage for each of Hunter’s remaining games, and he’s had no trouble rising to the occasion thus far. Plus, the player right behind him in the consensus rankings, Michigan CB Will Johnson, has not played since Oct. 19 due to injury. Hunter and Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty (No. 5 on the consensus board) are separating from the pack in the Heisman race. In all likelihood, that award is also Hunter’s to lose at this point. GO DEEPER College Football Playoff rankings: Boise State leaps to No. 4 seed As mentioned, the 2025 draft isn’t exactly loaded with premier QB prospects — at least, not in the way the ’24 class was with names like Caleb Williams, Drake Maye, Jayden Daniels and others. Even with Georgia’s Carson Beck falling off our updated board and Texas’ Quinn Ewers down to No. 46 (from a preseason ranking of 21), though, the quarterback outlook is starting to look a little rosier than it did a month or two ago. That’s thanks to the concurrent rises of Miami’s Cam Ward (No. 12), Alabama’s Jalen Milroe (No. 22) and LSU’s Garrett Nussmeier (No. 35), all of whom were unranked on the preseason consensus board. Colorado’s Shedeur Sanders has more or less held steady, too, checking in at No. 16 here — up one spot from his preseason ranking. Does that mean those flailing NFL teams headed toward top-10 picks will boost the QB market come April? They almost always do. Ward and Sanders, especially, seem like they’ll have their fans in the pro ranks — they were selected No. 3 and No. 6, respectively, in Nick Baumgardner’s 2025 mock draft earlier this month. Beck parlaying his big performance against Tennessee on Saturday into a strong close to the season, impressive pre-draft process and a rise back up the board would help that positional depth. Advertisement In short, yes, probably. There has been unending discussion about running back draft value over the years, but — for all the talk (and some evidence) that it’s wiser to wait on that position — teams have invested in elite running back prospects when it’s made sense to do so. Atlanta took Bijan Robinson at No. 8 two drafts ago; the Giants selected Saquon Barkley at No. 2 in 2018; Leonard Fournette, Ezekiel Elliott and Todd Gurley all cracked the top 10 in the drafts prior to Barkley’s arrival.

Next season, LPGA players will compete for over $131 million in purses across a 33-tournament schedule, the tour announced Wednesday. That figure marks an additional $62 million since 2021, totaling a 90 percent increase in the total prize pool. The LPGA’s prize money is up from $118 million in 2024, $101.3 million in 2023 and $86 million in 2022. Advertisement This week’s CME Group Tour Championship, the LPGA’s season-ending event, boasts the largest payout in the history of women’s sports. The winner will receive a historic $4 million prize, with a total purse of $11 million. The Tour Championship awards the largest non-major winner’s check in women’s golf. By comparison, the NWSL’s team salary cap totals $2.75 million, while the WNBA’s is just under $1.5 million. Nelly Korda, the world No. 1 and LPGA Player of the Year, comes into the event with more than $4.1 million in 2024 on-course earnings. Korda could pass the single-season scoring record on the LPGA, currently held by Lorena Ochoa ($4.3 million in 2007). The 2025 schedule includes two new events and will kick off two weeks later to give players additional off-season time to rest and reset. The LPGA will visit 14 states and 11 countries outside the U.S., with two Asia swings — one kicking off in February and the other in October. Sixteen of the 35 events offer purses that exceed $3 million. Twenty-four events will offer travel stipends, free accommodations for players or guaranteed payouts, perks that will be beneficial for lower-ranked players or those who miss the cut. The 2025 LPGA rotation includes three new major venues. The women will play Erin Hills in Erin, Wis., for the first time in U.S. Women’s Open history, the newly unveiled Fields Ranch East at PGA Frisco in Texas for the KPMG Women’s PGA and Royal Porthcawl in Wales for the AIG Women’s Open.

The invitational tournament will take place as a series of three double-headers in Houston, Texas, Glendale, Arizona and San Diego, California with total points after the round-robin deciding the winner.

It is the third in a row for Japan and fifth overall for the Asian nation. In the years since the USWNT’s inaugural tournament win in 2016, they have only lost the title to France and England in 2017 and 2019 respectively, and boast a strong record against their 2025 opponents. After a cumulative 88 games against the challengers, the USWNT have only lost twice, remaining undefeated against Colombia and losing once each against Japan and Australia.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"A year after missing playoffs, Pride and Spirit meet in NWSL Championship",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5934908/2024/11/20/nwsl-championship-orlando-pride-washington-spirit-matchup/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 18:00:01 GMT",The Athletic breaks down how the top two teams in NWSL ended up in the final,"NWSL After 188 games and 502 goals, the 2024 NWSL season all comes down to this. The Orlando Pride and Washington Spirit backed up their first and second-place regular season finishes by navigating a tricky playoff bracket, booking their places in Saturday’s final at CPKC Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. Advertisement It’s a matchup between two newly-minted heavyweights who both missed the playoffs a year ago. Orlando and Washington have bolted up the standings thanks to star players and unsung heroes alike — and they’ve both managed to sustain excellence in the face of hardships and change. Here’s how the two finalists stack up ahead of Saturday’s NWSL Championship match at 8pm ET on CBS. Orlando Pride has a whiff of destiny about it this season. Some of that is probably confirmation bias for the NWSL Shield winners, given to the team with the best regular season point total, and some of it is high emotions running around Brazilian maestro Marta. And some of it is just good old-fashioned excitement about a worst-to-first narrative, much like Gotham FC in 2023. They also, of course, just keep winning. However, Orlando has looked somewhat vulnerable in its last few games, including a two-loss “streak,” starting with a 2-0 defeat to the Portland Thorns on October 11 and followed by a 3-1 loss to Gotham on October 20. Head coach Seb Hines was willing to risk rotating his starting XI knowing at that point the team was locked in for the postseason. It was longer-term thinking, which allowed him to rest key players — thinking that contributed to Hines winning NWSL coach of the year earlier this week. But there was a mental aspect as well, letting the players falter in the regular season and see if they could climb out of the hole together, which they did. Mental resilience was an important part of the Pride’s semifinal win over the Kansas City Current. Orlando isn’t used to trailing, not since the beginning of the season, and coming back against an opponent that seemed determined to try to press them into making mistakes will be an important mental boost going into a final against the Spirit who also forced its way back into its own semifinal game.  If we rewind to those early games, it’s clear the Pride was trying to build on pieces it already had from the 2023 season, when it was truly in full reboot mode. The starting defense in its season opener — Kerry Abello, Kylie Strom, Emily Sams, and Haley McCutcheon — is not terribly different from the defense that worked so hard to lock out KC’s Temwa Chawinga and the rest of the Current in the semifinal. The main difference is the switch from McCutcheon to rookie Cori Dyke, who played her way into a starting fullback role while McCutcheon was moved a little higher into midfield. GO DEEPER Inside the rebirth of the Orlando Pride Unlike the Spirit, the Pride didn’t lean so hard on the NWSL draft this year, instead looking to international signings and trades to strengthen its core. One of those internationals, Brazilian midfielder Luana, was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma just months after signing for the club. She recently completed her final round of chemotherapy and has announced that recent scans show no sign of cancer — something the team has been rallying around since the news. Advertisement But other signings like fellow Brazilian midfielder Angelina and Zambian forward Barbra Banda, who leads the team in goals, have had a huge impact alongside the team’s longer-time roleplayers like Strom, McCutcheon, and Abello. The Pride has also pulled good performances out of 2023 fourth-round draft pick Summer Yates and Ally Watt, whose late-season surge on the wing has been galvanizing. This is a team that has nurtured its roster into a cohesive unit, particularly in defense and can adapt fairly well against various strategies. GO DEEPER Barbra Banda: The softly-spoken Zambian goal scorer making noise with Orlando Pride  In the last few games for the Pride, that cohesion has been under some strain, albeit with admirable responses from the players. You could see their adaptability on display against KC in the semifinal; they didn’t push too hard for the transition to put Banda in behind the Current’s defense, instead willing to let KC set a higher line while also guarding against the threat Chawinga posed. While it often looked like Sams and Dyke had to run at 110 per cent of their max speed to do it, they did contain Chawinga while the rest of the defense was able to pick up the threats from Michelle Cooper and Debinha, goal against notwithstanding. It helped that KC lost midfielder and captain Lo’eau LaBonta to a halftime substitution, which only further degraded their ability to put Chawinga into dangerous positions, resulting in just 0.23 xG (expected goals) and no shots on target for the Malawian. In terms of vulnerability, Washington will probably take a close look at that 3-1 loss Orlando had against Gotham when Orlando wasn’t able to convert much of anything into chances on goal, nor were they able to contain midfielder Rose Lavelle. As much as the Pride has a strong group of non-superstar players, they still rely heavily on Banda and Marta for goals. But Gotham cut Banda out of the equation, and the Pride struggled. Banda has been on form in her past couple of games, racking up a strong playoff account with three goals in two playoff games. It sounds extremely obvious, but job No. 1 for the Spirit will be keeping Banda out. GO DEEPER Marta's GOAT goal lifts Orlando Pride to NWSL final The Washington Spirit’s road to the final wasn’t smooth or direct. Despite Michele Kang’s fortune-altering full takeover of the club in March 2022, the club hadn’t made the NWSL playoffs since winning it all in 2021. Arguably, no night under Kang’s governance proved to be more transformative than that of the 2024 NWSL draft. Advertisement The Spirit traded away two vital figures from that championship-winning core on Jan. 12, sending defender Sam Staab to the Chicago Red Stars and midfield orchestrator Ashley Sanchez to the North Carolina Courage. For Staab, Washington obtained Chicago’s first-round pick, third overall; for Sanchez, the Courage sent the fifth overall pick and $250,000 (£198,000) of allocation money. The payoff to these contentious transactions came swiftly. The third pick was used to select Croix Bethune, who was named NWSL rookie of the year on Tuesday having tied the league’s single-season assist record (10) despite suffering a season-ending injury in August. The Spirit used the fifth pick on Hal Hershfelt, whose header in second-half stoppage time gave Washington the equalizer that led to their penalty shootout triumph against Gotham FC in the semifinal. Both players were selected as alternates to head coach Emma Hayes’ squad for the Olympics, the only NWSL rookies to land on the roster. It’s rare for a team to turn two vital veterans into a pair of young players who can be equally impactful immediately. All six of the Spirit’s rookies made it on the scoresheet this season. The moves may not have sat well with Sanchez and Staab, but the ruthless approach put the roster in as good of a position to contend, if not outright improved. The Spirit also had a choreographed midseason coaching change. Washington surprised many by prying UEFA W Champions League winner Jonatan Giraldez from FC Barcelona Femeni, allowing him to finish the Spanish club’s season before joining in the summer. They remained competitive at the top of the table under interim boss Adrian Gonzalez, raising concerns that a change of voice could derail an already strong season. It did not. The Spirit kept stride with Orlando, Gotham and KC to make the hunt for the title a true four-team competition.  The hurdles kept coming once Giraldez was manning the technical area. In August, Bethune’s record-setting rookie season came to a crashing halt, suffering a torn meniscus while throwing a first pitch at a Washington Nationals baseball game. The moment was meant to celebrate the return of the four Spirit players who won gold with the USWNT at the Paris Olympics. In September, fellow United States international Andi Sullivan — a vital voice on and off the field — suffered an ACL tear, taking the Spirit’s key defensive midfielder out of the picture. The injuries showcased the depth at Giraldez’s disposal, with several players taking on elevated roles heading into the playoffs. Another pair of rookies — Heather Stainbrook and Makenna Morris — became set-piece specialists, with Morris providing the assist on Hershfelt’s last-gasp equalizer on Saturday. One of last year’s breakout midfielders, Paige Metayer, returned to the lineup in more of a wing back role beneath Trinity Rodman on the right. Hershfelt dropped to the base of the midfield, looking like a capable ball-winner and tempo-setter in Sullivan’s stead. While its semifinal win at a sold-out Audi Field will be remembered for the late exploits of Hershfelt and goalkeeper Aubrey Kingsbury, the preceding 90 minutes showed more of the Spirit’s best on and off the ball.  Across 120 minutes, the Spirit outshot Gotham 27-14. Ten of those 27 attempts landed on goal, with nine resulting in saves for opposing goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger. Even after Gotham opened the scoring early in the second half, Washington kept its resolve. Rodman alternated between the left and right wings as the game progressed, forcing Gotham’s defense to switch assignments and be further unsettled with each rotation. Advertisement Washington recognized that Gotham substitute Bruninha entered the game with plenty of aggression and seemed willing to embrace contact. After drawing a 72nd-minute yellow card for a needless off-ball shove on Rosemonde Kouassi, Rodman baited the Brazilian into a pair of fouls, with the second resulting in a red card in extra time. GO DEEPER Trinity Rodman: My game in my words The Pride won both of its regular season matchups with Washington, a 3-2 win at Audi Field during Gonzalez’s interim tenure and a 2-0 victory at home in early October. The gamesmanship that the Spirit tapped into in the semifinal may be vital to unsettle an increasingly vulnerable Orlando side. While neither scoreline looks outright lopsided, the more recent result flattered the higher seed. Orlando had a 1.52 to 1.13 edge in terms of expected goals while outshooting the Spirit 17-11. They racked up a higher volume of chances, albeit in less dangerous areas (on average) per attempt. Their two goals were far from emphatic, too, with Marta opening with a penalty kick and Tara McKeown gifting Orlando an own goal. It was enough to cap off the Pride’s quest to win the NWSL Shield, which they clinched in the process. Nevertheless, it was a performance from which Washington can take more encouraging cues ahead of this one-off clash. As the tables of each team’s performance metrics drive home, these are two very evenly matched opponents. Both have overcome hardships to get to the final. Both have game-breaking star attackers and a deep roster of players doing more thankless tasks behind them. Whichever side comes out on top this weekend will be a worthy champion, whether it’s the Spirit taking home its second NWSL title or the Pride securing its first.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How Lionel Messi and Inter Miami will be impacted by Tata Martino's exit,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5934267/2024/11/20/lionel-messi-inter-miami-tata-martino-exit/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 17:53:08 GMT",Tata Martino will leave Inter Miami after their playoff failure — this is what it means,"MLS As Inter Miami closed in on a record-setting 74-point season and a Supporters’ Shield trophy, much of the credit was given to Lionel Messi. When healthy, the 37-year-old Argentina national team captain was dominant.  Messi played in just 19 of Miami’s 36 league matches but was still performing at MVP level, even if this was perhaps unsurprising for an eight-time Ballon d’Or winner. Messi, though, has attributed Miami’s rise from a last-place club to the league’s standard to head coach Tata Martino.  Advertisement “The team has grown so much with Martino’s arrival,” Messi told reporters on the eve of the Leagues Cup final in August 2023. He repeated that on October 2 this year in a post-match interview with Apple TV after scoring two goals against the Columbus Crew to secure the Supporters’ Shield. On Tuesday, The Athletic reported Martino had resigned as Miami’s head coach due to personal reasons. The club announced that Martino, club co-owner Jorge Mas and president of football operations Raul Sanllehi will address the media on Friday. The reasons for Martino’s abrupt departure from Miami, who were eliminated from the MLS playoffs on November 9, will become more clear. But it may not answer every pending question regarding the future of the club and how this change will affect Messi. The World Cup winner has a contract through the 2025 season and a reported option for 2026. Messi is much more than a star player at the club. His contract includes a purchase option that would make him a partial owner in the future. He’s an influential figure. In June 2023, cameras in Argentina captured Martino leaving Messi’s gated community in Rosario. The unconfirmed meeting took place two weeks after Messi told the world that he would end his European career and head to the United States. It preempted the third iteration of a Messi-Martino partnership. Martino coached Messi for one season at Barcelona in 2014 then again in 2015-2016 with the Argentina national team.  Former Barcelona director of football Andoni Zubizarreta claimed in 2020 that Martino had voiced concerns about Messi’s authority at the Catalan club during a Barcelona training session a decade ago. According to Zubizarreta, Martino told Messi, “I know you can call the president and he’ll fire me, but damn, you don’t have to demonstrate that every day. I already know.”  Advertisement “Those words never came out of my mouth,” Martino said shortly after. Their relationship has been overanalyzed. The fact that Martino could not win a major trophy alongside Messi fueled the hypothesis that a lack of success had created fissures between the two. The evidence at hand, though, doesn’t add up.  Messi and Martino shared an embrace during last summer’s hype-filled Leagues Cup run which seemingly put an end to that theory. Messi’s public support of Martino this season carries weight as well. A stinging loss can change everything in professional sport. But Martino’s resignation coincides with a shift in dynamics inside the walls of Miami’s facility in Fort Lauderdale. To begin with, there is no shortage of decision makers at the club.  There’s Mas, the outspoken billionaire executive who personally recruited Luis Suarez. His brother Jose Mas is also a club adjudicator. Co-owner David Beckham has a say across multiple departments, too. Martino himself had significant authority on player signings early in his short tenure.  Things get complicated when it comes to the club’s sporting department. It was originally led by chief soccer officer Chris Henderson until Mas hired Sanllehi to oversee that division. It will be Sanllehi, not Henderson, who will flank Martino and Jorge Mas during Friday’s press conference. Sanllehi has twice held the position of director of football, first at Barcelona and then at Arsenal. He and Martino crossed paths during the Argentine’s lone year in La Liga. Before joining Miami, Sanllehi was the director general of Real Zaragoza in Spain — where Mas is part of the ownership group. Shortly after Sanllehi arrived in Zaragoza, the club’s owners replaced head coach Juan Ignacio Martinez with Juan Carlos Carcedo, a former assistant of Unai Emery at Arsenal, Paris Saint-Germain and Sevilla, among other clubs. Sanllehi described Carcedo, the current head coach of Cypriot team Pafos FC, as “hard-working, knowledgeable and modern” in an  interview with The Athletic in 2022. Advertisement By hiring Sanllehi, Mas sent a clear message. He has experience in key administrative positions in Europe and will help shape Miami’s sporting strategy. But there are major differences between managing a top-tier European side and maneuvering the convoluted squad and financial restrictions of an MLS club.  Sanllehi was instrumental in the highly-publicized deal that saw Neymar move from Santos to Barcelona in 2013. Neymar has been the latest superstar to be linked to a move to Miami. But Messi also has allies within the club in important roles. One is Guillermo Hoyos, Miami’s director of player development and methodology. Hoyos, an Argentine, was a youth coach of Messi’s at Barcelona. In 2010, Messi referred to Hoyos as “my footballing godfather.” Henderson is one of just a few professionals within the organization who has vast experience as an MLS executive. The club’s director of player personnel and compliance, Meghan Cameron, is a former MLS league office employee who was hired in 2021 after Miami were sanctioned for the MLS salary budget and roster guidelines. Henderson has thus far survived the ongoing shakeup. Miami’s vice president of soccer operations Niki Budalic, who works closely with Henderson, remains at the club. Others do not. Former first team director of scouting and recruitment Mark Prizant, a former Manchester United scout, left the club over the summer for new MLS expansion side San Diego FC. He was named assistant sporting director. After Miami’s 2-1 win over Atlanta United on October 25, Martino credited Henderson, Budalic and others for identifying midfielder Yannick Bright in the 2023 college draft. Bright, 23, was a revelation in 2024. Martino clearly respected their opinions. With so many important voices in some of Miami’s most prominent positions, Martino had limited sway. In the end, Martino, who took Miami from the bottom of the Eastern Conference to the league’s best-ever point total, is just a coach. Never mind that his eye for talent identification has resulted in two of MLS’ most prolific teams. Atlanta United in 2018 and the 2024 version of Inter Miami have Martino’s fingerprints throughout both teams.  Advertisement But as Martino told reporters two weeks ago, Miami fell well short of their objectives this season. The bar was high when he was hired shortly after Messi announced his decision to join. The standard, now, is even higher. Martino’s successor will have to manage up and appease the club’s most powerful voices. Miami’s next head coach must find common ground with Messi immediately, and outperform the team’s 2024 exploits. Carcedo could be a dark horse candidate based on his previous history with Mas and Sanllehi. Former Barcelona midfielder and manager Xavi, currently unemployed, checks the most boxes. Together with Messi and Sergio Busquets, Xavi was an integral part of Barcelona’s glorious run from the mid 2000s. Mas admires the Barcelona DNA. His successful courtship of Messi, Suarez, Busquets and Jordi Alba have been a boon for the club and for MLS. Then there’s Javier Mascherano, another former Barcelona midfielder and a legend with the Argentina national team. Mascherano and Messi have a long history together. Mascherano, 40, is the head coach of Argentina’s U-20 and U-23 teams. He talks openly about his friendship with Messi. He also tried to include Messi in his squad for the Paris Olympics as an overage player. The Miami job is a desirable one from the outside. Thanks to Messi, the club’s brand is well known around the world. But whoever is hired as Miami’s next manager will have the unenviable task of coaching an aging Miami team with limited depth at next summer’s Club World Cup.  Martino’s exit has been put down to personal reasons — but what Martino says on Friday, in what will be a highly visible news conference, could be telling.

Sawiris, who co-owns Villa with American businessman Wes Edens, told The Telegraph that his club “will be voting against the proposed APT rules”, citing potentially “astronomical” legal fees and the need for clubs to present a “united front” ahead of the introduction of the UK government’s Independent Football Regulator. GO DEEPER Manchester City vs the Premier League: The APT verdict (briefly) explained Both the Premier League and City claimed victories after October’s ruling; the league admitted that the ruling identified “a small number of discrete elements” of the APT which do not comply with competition law but claimed it “(endorses) the overall objectives, framework and decision-making of the APT system”. City’s view was that the tribunal had found that the Premier League “was found to have abused its dominant position” with the APT rules and amendments. The tribunal’s ruling came after the case — which is separate from the one regarding City’s more than 100 alleged financial breaches of the Premier League’s rules — was heard by a panel for two weeks, after City brought the legal challenge against the league’s amended rules in June. The league’s APT rules are aimed at stopping clubs from signing inflated sponsorship deals with firms that are linked with them, as well as preventing them transferring players for less or more than their market value between teams in the same ownership group.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Rafael Nadal's tennis career: A king of clay who should be remembered as so much more,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5934648/2024/11/20/rafael-nadal-retires-tennis-career-legacy/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 17:14:06 GMT","Nadal's fight and endurance are not in doubt, but a one-dimensional view of his tennis legacy serves nobody","Tennis Rafael Nadal retired from tennis on Tuesday night. He won 22 Grand Slam titles in 23 years across all three tennis surfaces, with an Olympic gold medal and 92 ATP titles in all. He was most dominant on clay, winning 63 percent of his titles on the surface and compiling an 81-match win streak between April 2005 and May 2007, which remains the longest single-surface streak in the Open era of men’s tennis. Advertisement He also spent his entire career battling his own body, with Nadal’s injuries both acute and chronic carving the trajectory of his career and to an extent the way he played tennis. King of clay. Warrior. Spanish bull. Nadal embodied all these things, and tributes written so are not ill-fitting. But describing Nadal only in such terms does one of the greatest men’s tennis players of all time a catastrophic disservice. A tennis player in constant evolution, Nadal — and his rivalries with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic that constituted the ‘Big Three’ era — refigured the sport. Nadal possessed shotmaking talent, tennis IQ, finesse and flair too often lost in the brick-red dust. The world tends to define athletes and sometimes people in general in absolute terms. It’s a way of making sense of complex personalities and performers — whittling them down to a single characteristic like a superhero. It also creates easy archetypes for comparison: in Nadal’s case, he was the ferocious physicality to Federer’s effortless elegance and Djokovic’s rubber-limbed flexibility. All three suffered for their superheroism. Federer was so aesthetically pleasing that his supreme fitness and remarkable defensive abilities were glossed over. Djokovic was cast as reactive, which doesn’t do justice to his point construction or his extra gear in pressure moments (the all-or-nothing cross-court forehand against Federer in the semifinal of the 2011 U.S. Open just one example of many). Djokovic’s three French Open titles barely register because of the 10 he has won in Melbourne, and who cares about a hat-trick of wins when your biggest rival has won 11 more times? Well, as so many players told The Athletic in June, Djokovic is very possibly the second-best male player on clay of all time. Nadal still suffered most for his greatness on one surface. He was perhaps the second-most complete male baseliner to ever play the sport after Djokovic, with an all-round game good enough to deliver four U.S. Opens (tied with Djokovic and just one shy of the Open-era record held by Federer, Pete Sampras and Jimmy Connors), and two Wimbledons from five final appearances at the All England Club. As he evolved his game to meet his body’s limitations and started to shorten points more concertedly, he become one of the best volleyers on the ATP Tour. Subtract Nadal’s 14 Roland Garros titles and his eight remaining majors give him more than tennis legends like John McEnroe and Boris Becker, and tie him with Andre Agassi, Connors and Ivan Lendl. It’s true that some surface homogenization in the early 2000s helped him do more than his clay-court specialist compatriots like Sergi Bruguera, Carlos Moya, Albert Costa and Juan Carlos Ferrero — who all won the French Open but not a major more — but Nadal’s mastery of every surface came from the way he reconfigured tennis itself alongside Djokovic and to an important but lesser extent Federer. Advertisement Nadal changed the sport in myriad ways. His shotmaking ability, on the slide and on the run, and the unseen revs and kick of his forehand helped redefine the mechanics of tennis (as with the surfaces changing, equipment changing helped too). Even that shot, which he splintered beautifully into the inside-out thrash, the banana whip, the cross-court hook and so many more variations, is normally figured in terms of brute force as opposed to David Foster Wallace’s “liquid whip” description of Federer’s own devastating groundstroke. Rafael Nadal retires from tennis Nadal’s initially belittled deep return position neutralized opponents with bigger serves. It allowed him to start rallies where he could be favorite while knowing that his opponents would do little to counter it. That position, which Dominic Thiem also adopted early, has now become fundamental to men’s tennis. What all these evolutions have in common is movement, and that is where Nadal remade tennis most of all alongside Djokovic. The return strategy, the baseline missiles launched with margin and the deftness in the forecourt were underpinned by staggering court coverage, whether running round his backhand time and again or sliding a lost position into a winning one, transposing clay-court movement onto new surfaces. While Djokovic was and remains the true master of sliding, it was the collective strength of their innovations tipped the scales away from servers, and forced up-and-coming players who ran into them to not just dominate on serve, but scramble and rally too. Daniil Medvedev is perhaps the most direct descendant by force. That’s before considering how the Nadal-Djokovic-Federer-Andy Murray nexus, who contested so many semifinals and finals, made each other better while making everybody else look worse. None of this means that Nadal is as naturally talented as Federer nor as elastic as Djokovic. Nadal himself felt Federer was more blessed. His team agreed: his uncle and first coach Toni said in an interview by phone this week that Nadal “had a very good volley, but not a nice volley like Federer”. Nadal was king of clay. His power and will to win were hard to ignore. But to watch Nadal finding seemingly impossible angles or leaning into his backhands mid-match was to see a master of his craft at work. A fighter yes, but a genius too. (Top photo: Quinn Rooney / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Not yet 20 games in, Islanders are stuck in NHL's mushy middle once more",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5934782/2024/11/20/islanders-nhl-standings-2024/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 16:23:33 GMT","Through 19 games, the Islanders are the definition of mediocre. No progress, no success.","NHL You could make a list of the things the 2024-25 New York Islanders do well, then make a list of the things they don’t do well. The two lists would probably come out pretty even, which makes dissecting this team awfully confounding. Are they good but unlucky? Bad but plucky? You can sum up this team through 19 games quite simply. Advertisement They’re the definition of mediocre. I’ll throw some data at you in this piece, I’ll discuss some options for change — both minor and more drastic — that could pull the Islanders out of their rut. But the fundamental truth is they are 7-7-5, a record that speaks volumes without even looking too deeply under the hood. For three and a quarter seasons now, the Islanders have played mostly close games, lost a bunch and done so in maddeningly predictable ways, as that five at the end of the record line tells you. Tuesday’s 2-1 shootout loss to the Flames in Calgary was more of the same: a couple of decent road periods, not enough finish on high-danger chances to produce more than one goal, an untimely penalty, a power-play goal against and then a skills-competition point lost. Yes, this Islanders team is fighting through important injuries. Yes, they are truly never out of a game, which speaks to the Trotzian DNA that still exists in this group going back seven years now. And yes, they are a pretty good five-on-five team, which again shows the foundation that Barry Trotz built and Patrick Roy has rekindled. But it’s not enough. The Metro Division is separating quickly this season, and the Islanders are being left behind, already knowing before Thanksgiving that it will be another mad dash to one of the last few playoff spots. This isn’t progress. This isn’t success. This is mediocrity — the dreaded mushy middle that NHL teams have to break free from to have any chance at being a real contender. Sorry to start off on such an overarching downer, but here we are. Let’s dig in a bit further with some observations over the past week. Two seasons ago, the Islanders went through Seattle, Vancouver, Edmonton and Calgary in early January. They lost three of four, kicking off a 1-7-3 slide that prompted Lou Lamoriello to swing the Bo Horvat trade. Advertisement Last season, the Isles made this western Canada-plus-Seattle trip at around the same time, mid-November. A shootout win in Calgary salvaged a 1-1-2 road trip and snapped a seven-game winless streak. Two months later, Roy replaced Lane Lambert. There’s still a stop in Detroit on Thursday, but this trip through the Canadian Rockies has produced yet another blah result, with a good performance in Vancouver canceled out by blown leads in Seattle and Calgary and a desperation point earned in Edmonton. The fact is the Islanders haven’t won twice in western Canada since the Doug Weight era, so this is not a new trend — the 2019-20 regular season ended in Calgary with the COVID-19-induced shutdown of the league and the limited 2020-21 schedule meant no trip that season. But this season’s swing and last season’s swing looked very similar. Last season, the Lambert-led Isles coughed up third-period leads in Vancouver and Seattle to lose in overtime and a shootout; they coughed up a third-period lead twice in Calgary, too, but got the extra point to go 6-6-5 coming back home. Now it’s 7-7-5 after familiar letdowns. In addition to giving away leads late, the Isles, like last season, have appalling special teams. The power play is where they miss Mat Barzal and Anthony Duclair most, even though the power play wasn’t exactly top 10 with those guys healthy the first few weeks of the season. But the units now have very little cohesion missing two of their best workers. With the way the Islanders have been able to play and produce at five-on-five, the power play being subpar would be survivable if the penalty kill weren’t, yet again, a total wreck. Here’s a stat that will make you scream: The Islanders have spent the least time shorthanded of any NHL team since the start of last season and have taken the second-fewest minors since the start of 2023-24 but are by far the worst team at killing penalties in the league over the past 101 games. Advertisement Another stat: The Isles currently rank second in the league on the PK in fewest expected goals allowed. And one more: Since the start of last season, the Islanders have a better kill rate when down two men (8-for-10, 80 percent) than they do down one man (188-for-262, 71.8 percent). Tuesday night was a microcosm. Not a great penalty taken by Scott Mayfield, but teams take penalties, usually a few of them, every game. Nearly a full kill, but not quite. And an opposing power play that gets the Islanders moving inside their own zone, which is where too many of their failures are occurring. Is there a PK guru out there who can give the Isles a boot camp session or two? Paging Frans Nielsen and Johnny Boychuk! (Actually, Boychuk works for the Isles now, so he can give them some pointers.) Peeking at some data on scoring chances, I can see the Islanders are not giving up much off the rush or off turnovers, so their up-ice structure is good. Where they’ve struggled based on the data is in the D-zone, where they rank 27th in high-danger chances allowed. When Roy came in, this was a point of emphasis. He memorably said he didn’t want the Islanders playing the “dice” style in their own end; he wanted quick man-on-man coverage with support to try to force turnovers and get up the ice with numbers. Whether the Islanders simply don’t have the personnel to successfully play that way or teams have figured out how to break them down, it’s the one area at five-on-five that isn’t a net positive for them. Adam Pelech’s absence may hurt there. Isaiah George has been a remarkable story in his brief NHL run, but he’s starting to falter a bit, as you might expect. Grant Hutton sat out Tuesday with Alex Romanov finally returning; Hutton’s on-ice xG hasn’t been bad, nor has Dennis Cholowski’s. Cholowski has added some offense in his meager minutes. Advertisement Romanov’s return should stabilize the D-zone a bit. Pelech, still a few weeks away, should help as well. But neither of those defensemen is an up-the-ice puck-mover, so the Isles’ transition offense may be stuck in neutral. Mike Reilly’s extended absence due to heart surgery opens up a spot for that kind of defenseman. Cholowski should get the first chance at it since George playing 12 to 13 minutes per night seems less than ideal. He should go back to AHL Bridgeport, as was the plan before all the injuries. If the Islanders are looking around for third-pair help, there isn’t much. Marcus Pettersson is likely the biggest-name left-handed defenseman who could be moved, but why would the Isles, who currently sit tied with the Pittsburgh Penguins at 19 points, make such a big addition? The Islanders have a couple of players other teams would be interested in, most notably Brock Nelson. It just so happens Nelson is tied for the team lead with seven goals and centers the most consistent line the team has, between Maxim Tsyplakov and fellow pending unrestricted free agent Kyle Palmieri. Trading Nelson or Palmieri means you’re punting on the season. Even with all the mediocrity, it’s hard to endorse that. The Islanders need a reset/retool badly, but doing it in November when the team, despite the ugly record, actually sits on the edge of the playoff race means UBS Arena sits three-quarters empty for the rest of the year. If this team is still hovering around .500 by January, it’ll be realistic to think about moving Nelson, Palmieri, Jean-Gabriel Pageau and even one of Pelech or Ryan Pulock, if someone wants to take on those long-term deals midseason. Nothing should be off the table. But for now, it’s not realistic or practical. That means all that’s left is watching and hoping this team can hold onto its leads, kill its penalties and win some games. After 101 games of pretty much the same show, it’s hard to know how that will come to pass. (Photo: Brett Holmes / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Sign up here to receive it directly in your inbox. It’s only Wednesday, leaving plenty of time this week for more drama from Woody Johnson’s Jets. Today, we’re covering: The New York Jets fired general manager Joe Douglas on Tuesday, six weeks after the team fired coach Robert Saleh. According to multiple team sources who spoke to The Athletic about the team’s inner workings, Woody Johnson had suggested an even more drastic move earlier in the season. According to those sources, the day after the Jets’ 10-9 home loss to the Broncos, there was a meeting at the team facility that included Johnson, Douglas and three other high ranking members of the Jets organization. It also included a group of coaches, with Saleh, offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett, then-defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich and special teams coordinator Brant Boyer among them. Advertisement During the meeting, Johnson suggested to the coaches that they bench Aaron Rodgers in favor of Tyrod Taylor because he felt Rodgers’ performance was holding the team back. The idea of benching the future Hall of Famer sounded so absurd that one coach asked whether the owner was serious. Multiple sources from that meeting believed he was. A week later, Johnson made the decision to fire Saleh without consulting his general manager (or anyone else in the organization, for that matter). Yesterday, Zack Rosenblatt and I published a story on why Douglas never stood a chance. Back to you, Jacob. Deion “Prime Time” Sanders dominated headlines during his playing days. Years later, “Revis Island” stranded many receivers before Richard Sherman embodied a style that he called “more of a tourist attraction. You stop here, I take your money and you go.” Darrelle Revis vs. No. 1 receivers, 2009: pic.twitter.com/QJOsaC1x5X — Jeremy Bergman (@JABergman) July 18, 2018  Few could match the lockdown corners in their prime. But those were the good ol’ days for corners, a position former CB Domonique Foxworth called “the most underappreciated” in football during an episode of “The Athletic Football Show,” which covers the disappearance of the star cornerback (and inspired this deep dive). While the plight of running back salaries dominates the headlines, cornerback pay is quietly the second-slowest-growing in the NFL, judging by the growth of superstars’ (i.e. highest-paid players) change in average annual pay over the past 10 years:  It’s especially drastic when comparing corners to the players they defend. The number of corners making 9 percent or more of their team’s salary cap has remained unchanged since 2016. The receiver market has skyrocketed, though, making it clear: Star corners are no longer considered as valuable.  Back in 2015, positional spending at cornerback was $13.1 million per team (per OvertheCap), which was 22 percent of what the average team allocated to their defense that year. Ten years later, cornerback rooms are allocated a similar 20 percent of a team’s spending on defense ($18.3 million). This illustrates that while cornerbacks on a whole are paid similarly, the superstars are not.  Maybe teams are drafting fewer first-round corners, hence the lack of pay? I looked up the last 20 years of cornerbacks drafted in the first round. Nothing has changed, with four or five corners in the first round each year.  That overall decrease in corner value is especially notable this year, with the top two players in The Athletic’s Dane Brugler’s 2025 NFL Draft Big Board both being corners — though one, Travis Hunter, is also a receiver. “I’m not sure the market makes sense,” Foxworth said on the podcast. “The only logic I can come up with is the volatility of the position — that even the best corners have bad years. That doesn’t happen to the same extent at other positions.” Advertisement At the 15-minute mark of his podcast, Robert Mays weighs in on the seismic shift that led to this trend: “The way that the game is structured today makes a single corner less valuable,” and offenses “have gone from running (three-WR) personnel at a 36 percent clip to 61 percent today.” I agree with Robert’s assessment. The additional pass-catchers on the field and prevalence of pre-snap motion means teams need more than just a No. 1 corner, even if that corner is Heisman favorite Hunter. If Hunter chooses to focus more on receiver in the NFL, compensation might be why. Then again, his coach at Colorado, Deion Sanders, sure knew how to get paid. Maybe the 2025 draft marks the return of the superstar corner — assisted by potential DPOY Patrick Surtain II. Are the days of superstar corners over, or will potential No. 1 pick Hunter and fellow 2025 CB Will Johnson mark a revival? And why do you suspect we’ve seen this change? Click here to share your thoughts. Earlier this season, we took a long look at the QBR of Caleb Williams, Bo Nix and Jayden Daniels to find that only Daniels seemed like a sure thing. Much has changed since. Here’s how the rookie QBs currently stack up by EPA per drop back, together with their ranks against other rookie quarterbacks who were drafted top-12 across the past 20 years, per TruMedia (trigger warning for Bears fans): Anthony Richardson impressed on Sunday but still struggled with underneath passes. Derrik Klassen explores this and more in his Week 11 Quick Outs. The 2025 draft order continues to fall into place, with the Browns and Raiders projected to hold the top two picks. With Tommy DeVito set to start, Giants star DL Dexter Lawrence did not express confidence in his new quarterback: “To me, [Daniel Jones] is the best quarterback on the team.” Advertisement As a Bengals fan, I regularly get “what’s wrong with your team” texts. For now, I’m sending them Paul Dehner Jr.’s column, which explains why the Bengals are 1-6 in one-score games. Yesterday’s most-clicked: The Athletic’s Week 12 Power Rankings. 📫 Enjoyed this read?

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Wisconsin players react to Phil Longo's dismissal: 'A shock to all of us',https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935190/2024/11/20/wisconsin-badgers-luke-fickell-offensive-coordinator/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 16:10:46 GMT","The Badgers have consistently said the right things despite the lack of results, though frustration clearly began to show of late.","NCAAF MADISON, Wis. — It wasn’t unusual for Wisconsin’s football players to convene Sunday so head coach Luke Fickell could address the team, quickly debrief them on the previous game and set an agenda for the upcoming week. Most unusual, however, was the content of his talk because Fickell informed them that the Badgers would be moving forward without offensive coordinator Phil Longo. Advertisement Even if, deep down, players knew this partnership wasn’t working, they also didn’t expect to wake up a day after a 16-13 loss to No. 1 Oregon and discover Longo was gone — particularly with two games remaining in the regular season. “It’s college football for you,” center Jake Renfro said. “Anything can happen at any given moment. There’s no good time or place for anything. So it was definitely a shock to all of us. But it happens. You’ve got to live and learn and move on.” How quickly Wisconsin can move on will dictate whether the Badgers replicate their small late-season run from a year ago when they defeated Nebraska and Minnesota to close the regular season on a high note. Wisconsin (5-5, 3-4 Big Ten) plays at Nebraska (5-5, 2-5) on Saturday afternoon and then is home to Minnesota (6-4, 4-3). The Badgers will have opportunities to clinch both a bowl game and a winning record for the 23rd consecutive season. They will have to do so by picking themselves up amid a three-game losing streak in yet another disappointing campaign. They also will require a different approach, with Wisconsin’s play caller, sideline signaler and quarterbacks coach no longer with the program. “When you take a hard loss against Penn State, an Iowa game which shouldn’t have ended up like it was and another hard loss against Oregon alone, that hurts the morale,” wide receiver CJ Williams said. “And then you have something like this, with someone we were all really close with and we all looked up to as a coach and as a man, it sucks.” Players were understandably coy about what the game plan looks like for Nebraska, saying only that they believed they had a good plan in place. The Athletic has previously reported through a source with knowledge of the situation that tight ends coach Nate Letton will call plays, with wide receivers coach Kenny Guiton helping to signal plays from the sideline. Players also are likely to huddle more between snaps and may use wristbands with the plays on them to help avoid confusion at the line of scrimmage. Luke Fickell on who calls plays: ""Why does it matter? The offense will be run and those guys will do a lot of things collaboratively. I don’t think it really is important as to who is calling it. I guess it gives you the ability to point a finger at somebody if that’s the case."" — Jesse Temple (@jessetemple) November 18, 2024  “We’re ready for anything,” Renfro said. “Whatever the challenge is going to be. And this week unfortunately it’s Nebraska — for them, not for us. So we’re ready to embrace that challenge and bring a beatdown to Nebraska.” The Badgers have consistently said the right things this season despite the lack of results, though frustration clearly began to show on the faces of some players after the Oregon loss. Wisconsin is tied for 96th nationally in scoring offense at 23.9 points per game. That’s only slightly better than in Longo’s first season when the Badgers averaged 23.5 points. They represent the two worst marks for the program over the past 20 years. Advertisement When players were asked this week why the offense didn’t work under Longo, there were few answers to be found. Still, multiple players insisted that the leadership remained strong and that there was plenty to play for to serve as motivation. In that regard, it would seem — at least outwardly — that Fickell hasn’t lost the team. “No matter what our record is and what we’ve been through, you’ve got two trophy games on the line,” said quarterback Braedyn Locke, who has started 10 games in two seasons due to injuries to the starter. “You’ve got a whole lot of seniors that have bled and sweat and given this program everything that they’ve got for four, five, six years. And if that doesn’t mean something to you and that doesn’t make you want to give this thing everything that you’ve got, that’s tough.” Plenty of decisions will need to be made by players about their futures by the time the transfer portal window opens on Dec. 9. Several members of the roster, including Locke, came to Wisconsin to be a part of the offense Longo was installing. Fickell’s next offensive coordinator hire will go a long way toward determining who stays and who goes. Fickell’s press conference on Monday, which will be remembered for his combativeness to expected questions about Longo’s departure, contained a message about the importance of hope. He was asked specifically about what he would tell recruits two weeks before signing day, but his response was directed at everyone inside the building. “I think the philosophy of the whole program is do you believe and trust in who we are and what we do?” Fickell said. “I know it’s a little bit more difficult if you’re in a position where you’re not sure who your coach is going to be. But a lot of that is the belief in what it is that we’re doing as a whole, from the leadership from the very top moving forward.” Advertisement He went on to say: “Deep down inside, if people believe in who you are and what you’re doing, then they’ll have some blind faith that whatever you do moving forward, it’ll be a good thing.” Fickell is 76-36 as a head coach during his career, but he’s also just 13-11, including 8-8 in Big Ten games, at Wisconsin. He is 0-6 against ranked opponents and, since the start of last season, has just three victories against teams with winning records: Rutgers in both seasons and FCS foe South Dakota earlier this season. Fifth-year Wisconsin tight end Riley Nowakowski, who arrived as an in-state walk-on under the previous coaching staff, has witnessed great change during his time with the program. He said faith in Fickell in the locker room hasn’t wavered and noted players do see growth taking place, even if the on-field results don’t show it. Renfro began his career with Fickell at Cincinnati and started 13 games at center for the Bearcats in 2021 when they became the only Group of 5 team to reach the four-team College Football Playoff. Renfro had a message for people questioning where Wisconsin’s program could go under Fickell. “It’s proven,” Renfro said. “I’ve been a part of it in the past, so I know. That blind faith, it’s hard to have. You just have to have a good group of leaders to keep pushing and show the other guys who may not believe fully yet that this system works. “This coaching staff is great. Just keep pushing forward. Give it your all each and every day and it’s going to work out. Yeah, we’re sitting at 5-5 right now. But we’ve battled each and every day. We’ve battled each and every week. And we’re going to get better.” As former Wisconsin coach Paul Chryst liked to say, “Hope is not a method.” But for this group of players — and fans alike — it may be all they have to go on at this point.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Tottenham's appeal against Rodrigo Bentancur's ban does more harm than good,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5934975/2024/11/20/bentancur-ban-appeal-tottenham-son/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 16:08:59 GMT","Ben Davies suggested Bentancur's seven-game ban was the time to 'move on', but his club's appeal means that still cannot happen","EPL Just when it seemed we had finally reached a conclusion to the saga surrounding Rodrigo Bentancur’s racist comments about team-mate Son Heung-min, Tottenham Hotspur have reignited the story. The club have lodged an appeal against the midfielder’s seven-game ban which was imposed by an independent regulatory commission following an investigation by the Football Association. Advertisement Let’s get the most important details out of the way first. In June, Bentancur appeared on the television show Por la Camiseta which is broadcast in his native Uruguay. During an interview with journalist Rafa Cotelo, Bentancur said South Korea international Son and his cousins “all look the same.” The 27-year-old apologised to Son in public and privately. Bentancur was officially charged by the FA with an aggravated breach of Rule E3.1 in September. The three-member regulatory commission met last week and upheld the charge. Their report stated that the suspension had to be between six and 12 games, with six being the standard minimum punishment. They decided to give Bentancur a seven-match ban, which means he will miss Tottenham’s Carabao Cup quarter-final tie with Manchester United next month, but it does not apply to the Europa League.  In a statement on Wednesday afternoon, Tottenham said: “While we accept the guilty finding against Rodrigo by the independent regulatory commission, we believe the subsequent sanction is severe. Rodrigo will remain suspended from domestic competitions while the appeal is heard and the Club will make no further comment during this time.” The best-case scenario with this appeal is that the ban is reduced by one game. The club have dragged out an unpleasant situation longer than was perhaps necessary, and in a way that jars with head coach Ange Postecoglou’s comments in September, when he said Bentancur had made a “big error” and that “he has got to take the punishment”. The view at Tottenham is that while they accept Bentancur should be punished — and have never argued otherwise — his seven-game ban is harsh given shorter bans in other similar cases. Ben Davies was asked about Bentancur’s ban while on international duty with Wales earlier this week. His answer was perfect. “As a group, as a team at Tottenham, we’ve all put a line under it and moved on, but I think, ultimately, it’s important that we realise that these kind of things need to be looked at with the seriousness that it has been,” he said. “As far as I’m concerned and the team’s concerned, there’s a line under it now and we move on.” Advertisement But Spurs’ decision to appeal means that there is still no opportunity to do that. And what type of message does this send to the fanbase? According to research previously commissioned by AIA (the Asia-based insurance firm which has been the club’s shirt-front sponsor since 2014), Spurs are supported by 12million South Koreans, which represents nearly a quarter of that country’s population. After Bentancur was charged in September, The Athletic spoke to a few Tottenham supporters of East Asian heritage outside the training ground. Chris Ding called Bentancur’s comments “unacceptable, harmful and offensive” while Lee, who lives near Seoul, said “a lot of fans in Korea said it was a disgrace.” Kick It Out, the anti-discrimination and inclusion charity, received 1,332 reports of abuse during the 2023-24 Premier League season — a 33.2 per cent increase on the previous one. It says 731 (54 per cent) related to racism, and that a third of that figure were about comments directed towards people with East Asian heritage. This issue needs to be taken seriously but Tottenham’s actions fall far below expectations.  GO DEEPER Hwang, Son and the growing racism faced by East and South East Asians in football  The cynical view is that all Spurs care about is potentially having Bentancur available to face Liverpool on December 22, which was due to be the last game of his ban. If we were being extremely kind, this approach might be easier to swallow if Postecoglou’s squad was beset by an injury crisis. However, Bentancur has been rotated in the holding midfield role with Yves Bissouma throughout the season. Bissouma is not exactly a bad replacement, while summer signing Archie Gray is capable of filling in there too. Tottenham’s appeal would also suggest that any moral debate about whether Bentancur should or should not play in the Europa League while he is banned domestically is redundant, as he will probably still be selected. Some might argue that Bentancur’s seven-game ban is harsh in the context of previous sanctions for racially offensive comments. (Tottenham, without referring to previous cases, referred to Bentancur’s sanction as “severe”.) In 2020, Edinson Cavani got a three-game ban for a comment on Instagram. In 2019, Bernardo Silva got a one-game ban for a comment on Twitter. But the FA has a different standard for comments which are both made “in writing only or via the use of any communication device”, and where there is no “genuine intent” to be discriminatory or offensive. In such cases, the minimum ban is three games rather than six, which is why Cavani got the lesser punishment. (The minimum bans were different at the time of Silva’s offence). Advertisement But the fact is that Bentancur’s comment was spoken in a TV interview, not written on social media. Some may disagree with it, but the rule is perfectly clear. Bentancur cannot escape being held to the tougher standard. Others have pointed to the video of Argentina players singing a racist song, broadcast by Chelsea’s Enzo Fernandez, but not looked at by the FA. The reality is that because that occurred during the Copa America, it falls under the jurisdiction of CONMEBOL, not the FA. But because the Bentancur video was in his own home, on his own time, he is still considered a participant in English football, and therefore the FA was obliged to investigate.  GO DEEPER Sacked politicians, Chelsea in crisis and team-mates at war - the fallout from Argentina's chant  Tottenham’s own behaviour throughout this process has appeared inconsistent. They have never commented publicly if the midfielder faced any internal punishment for abusing their captain. Bissouma was given a one-match ban by the club in August after video footage emerged of him appearing to inhale nitrous oxide, which is more commonly known as hippie crack or laughing gas, from a balloon. Bissouma’s actions were foolish but Bentancur’s words will have had a bigger impact on a much larger number of people. What will disappoint many people is the gap between the contrition shown in public by Bentancur and the arguments that we now know were made in private. Fans might have hoped that, given Bentancur’s apologies, he might have accepted the charge and the ban. That would at least have drawn a line under this whole story. But the written reasons for the sanction, published by the FA on Monday, tell a different story. Bentancur denied the misconduct charge and denied that it was an aggravated breach. His argument, made in his written submissions to the commission, was that his words to Cotelo were “sarcastic and a gentle rebuke” after Cotelo had referred to Son as “the Korean”. They were “intended to be a light-hearted and jocular manner of chiding the journalist for his use of a generalisation that was wholly inappropriate”. So what about Bentancur’s apologies, in public and to Son in private? (Remember that Son said Bentancur was on the verge of tears when he apologised to him face to face.) “It was submitted that, in his apologies, the Player was apologising, not for what he said, but for the inadequate reporting on the interview which excluded Mr Cotelo’s reference to ‘the Korean’”, the commission’s written reasons observed. Fans and readers will make up their own minds about how plausible that is while Son might be questioning how genuine those initial apologies were. The view of the commission was that Bentancur’s own apologies showed how offensive he knew his comments were at the time. As did the initial statement released by the club. As did the statements made by Son himself. Advertisement “We cannot accept that submission, which flies in the face of the evidence,” the commission wrote. “It does not sit with the content or form of (Bentancur’s) apologies or the response of THFC or Heung-min Son.” Bentancur also made the argument that he had “a reasonable expectation of privacy”, and a “reasonable expectation that the journalist would show more common sense in what he posted”. This argument was also rejected by the commission — they said they were not “impressed” by it — given Cotelo was at Bentancur’s house for four hours with a film crew. He knew that what he said would be broadcast. When weighing up how long the ban should be, the commission’s report makes explicit reference to this gap between Bentancur’s public apologies and his attempts to get himself off the hook. The report said it was “greatly to his credit” that Bentancur took responsibility for his comments so quickly. “It was not to his credit that, thereafter, he elected to deny the charge on grounds which, on their face, undermined that initial, commendable reaction,” the report says, before concluding that his remorse “was and is genuine”. It is a messy situation which will have alienated sections of Tottenham’s fanbase. At a time when their performances on the pitch have been underwhelming, they keep generating more unnecessary noise off it.

Sign up here to receive Until Saturday directly in your inbox. Let’s start with a review of last night’s College Football Playoff rankings and end with a poll on a topic we really care about: the Pop-Tarts Bowl! Here’s what the 12-team CFP bracket would look like if yesterday’s rankings were the final ones:  Who’s in? No. 10 (11-seed) Georgia (8-2) is back after one week on the bubble. The Dawgs won their way up with a 31-17 victory over Tennessee, and look to be in good shape with only UMass and Georgia Tech remaining. As for the Vols, that game against Georgia looked just as much like a CFP eliminator to the committee as we thought. Advertisement First one out? No. 11 Tennessee (8-2). A two-loss SEC team will likely be left out of the field, and for now, the committee projects that team to be Tennessee. One gripe for Vols fans? Tennessee is ranked FIVE spots lower than an Alabama team it beat 24-17. And unfortunately for Tennessee, the opportunity for resume-building wins has dimmed — beating UTEP wouldn’t count for much, though Vanderbilt would be a decent W. That means the Vols need their two-loss SEC brethren to be on upset watch. Biggest surprise? No. 12 Boise State (9-1) is in line for a bye, long after all those years of BCS snubs. BYU took a nosedive from No. 6 to No. 14 after losing to Kansas, which keeps the Cougars as the highest-ranked Big 12 team … but the fifth-highest-ranked hypothetical conference champ. That means No. 12 Boise State would get the first-round bye as the Mountain West champ. (Although it didn’t affect seeding, the Cougars also rank behind the No. 13 SMU they’ve beaten, which prompted the Big 12 to throw some shade.) Game to watch for seeding this week: No. 5 (7-seed) Indiana (7-0) at No. 2 (5-seed) Ohio State (9-1). We’ve reached the Hoosiers’ prove-it week as they travel to face their first ranked opponent of the season (which means their strength of schedule could come back to bite them, in the event of a loss). Ohio State has won a Big Ten-record 29 consecutive games over Indiana, with the last loss coming in 1988, but these Hoosiers look different. The winner here likely punches their ticket to the Big Ten Championship against Oregon with a chance to play for a first-round CFP bye. Game to watch for the field this week: No. 19 Army (9-0) vs. No. 6 (8-seed) Notre Dame (9-1). If undefeated Army pulls off the two-touchdown upset, it would be by far the season’s most impressive win among G5 contenders (sorry, NIU, which has fallen to 6-4). Advertisement Could that mean Army jumps Big 12 leaders No. 14 BYU and No. 16 Colorado to become the fifth-highest-ranked theoretical conference champ, potentially kicking the Big 12 out of the Playoff entirely? No. 12 Boise State is already aiming for the 4-seed, and neither the Cougars (at No. 21 Arizona State) nor the Buffs (at Kansas) have easy games this weekend. (And for style points, the Black Knights already won the season’s best jersey reveal.) As for the Fighting Irish, I find it hard to believe they’d survive a second big upset loss, especially without a conference championship that could pick up the slack. Four FBS schools have owls as their mascots. And, as of Monday, they have all fired their coaches this season. To recap: For your records, a group of owls is called a parliament. Former USC and NFL QB Matt Barkley joins the “Until Saturday” podcast this week. Wisconsin fired offensive coordinator Phil Longo earlier this week. After 23 games, Longo’s offensive vision didn’t seem to be aligning with head coach Luke Fickell’s. Speaking of Big Ten coordinators, which ones could define the season for CFP and bowl contenders? Antonio Morales and Austin Meek tiered the conference coordinators today. Pop-Tarts Bowl update! After frosted strawberry lived its dream of being toasted and eaten LIVE after last year’s inaugural game, this year’s game will feature three new mascots: frosted hot fudge sundae, frosted wild berry and a third mystery flavor.

Nancy becomes the first Crew head coach to win the COY honor since the award’s namesake, Sigi Schmid, in 2008. This is Nancy’s first COY award after finishing runner-up twice, first in 2022 while with CF Montreal and again last season. Advertisement Nancy, 47, led the Columbus Crew to a second-place finish in the Eastern Conference this season after winning the MLS Cup final in 2023. After an impressive run of results in the CONCACAF Champions Cup this year, including impressive wins over Tigres and CF Monterrey, the Crew lost the continental final to Liga MX side CF Pachuca. Columbus won the Leagues Cup final earlier this summer. Nancy’s tactics and philosophy regarding positional play have made him among the most highly-regarded coaches in North America. The Frenchman has molded the Crew into a methodical yet entertaining side and a perennial title contender in MLS. Despite a congested calendar and a deep run in CONCACAF, the Crew were able to maintain their form for most of the MLS regular season. Columbus led the league in goal differential (plus 32) and finished second behind Inter Miami in the Supporters’ Shield race. Additionally, Columbus and Inter Miami were the only two teams to win at least nine matches at home and away in 2024. Miami and Columbus were also the only MLS sides to score more than 70 goals this season. Nancy orchestrated a milestone year for the Crew, which included a 66-point total regular season and 72 goals scored, both club records. ▪️ Club-record points (66)▪️ Club-record goals scored (72)▪️ Club-record wins (19)▪️ League-best point differential (+32) Wilfried Nancy is the 2024 MLS Coach of the Year. 🫡 pic.twitter.com/FcxhVyxSJ8 — Major League Soccer (@MLS) November 20, 2024  The Crew, however, were eliminated in the first round of the MLS playoffs by the New York Red Bulls. Still, it appears that Nancy’s tactical stamp over the course of the year was enough to narrowly win the award over Inter Miami manager Tata Martino. The 61-year-old Argentine led Miami from the bottom of the table in 2023 to a record-breaking points record and a Supporters’ Shield trophy this season. Inter Miami was similarly eliminated from the MLS playoffs after one three-game series. Martino won COY in 2018 as coach of Atlanta United.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Duncan Robinson remains invaluable to Heat offense despite slow shooting start,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5934845/2024/11/20/duncan-robinson-jimmy-butler-tyler-herro-bam-adebayo-miami-heat/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 16:01:19 GMT","Duncan Robinson's shooting has been cold so far, but he remains uniquely valuable to Miami.","NBA Seven-year veteran Duncan Robinson has been a fixture in the Miami Heat rotation but remains a resource the team routinely unlocks. At different points, the 30-year-old forward has aided matters with his shooting touch, knack for reading defenses, moving off the ball and, as recently as last season, developing into a reliable playmaker unafraid of attacking defenses (career-high 2.8 assists). Advertisement This season, Robinson’s shooting touch has been uncharacteristically lacking, but that doesn’t mean he hasn’t contributed value via his presence. During Monday’s double-digit win over the Philadelphia 76ers, the career 39.7 percent 3-point shooter struggled to find his offense, but Miami was strong on the court as coach Erik Spoelstra penciled in Robinson’s name to debut a new starting lineup. With Robinson alongside Jimmy Butler, Tyler Herro, Bam Adebayo and Haywood Highsmith, Miami sported a net rating of plus-40 against Philly while enjoying great balance on offense (123.3 points scored per 100 possessions) and defense (83.3 defensive rating). That quintet logged only one minute together in Miami’s first dozen games, but Robinson wasn’t remotely surprised by its efficacy, especially given his years of chemistry alongside his teammates. 
  “There’s a lot of continuity there,” he said. “I’ve logged a lot of hours with J.B. I’ve logged a lot of hours with Bam, ‘H’, Tyler. We’ve just been on the court a bunch together — practice, games, walkthroughs, everything, right? So, there’s a lot of familiarity there.” There is upside, too. Through his 12 appearances, Robinson is shooting a career-low 38.4 percent overall despite being a positive cog in lineups. The Heat have been far better with him on the court (plus-11.2 net rating would lead the NBA) than when he sits (minus-7.4 mark would rank 27th). That plus-18.6 swing is Miami’s best among players to log at least 100 minutes so far (for Dru Smith fans out there, his figure — plus-25.3 — is technically highest, but he’s played only 52 minutes). The upside in Robinson finding his stride centers on what he’s already doing well. He’s averaging .345 points per touch, which trails only Herro (.369) for the best mark among all Heat players. Ahh, but Robinson isn’t shooting well, right? How would that even work? Advertisement Well, as mentioned, he’s coming off the most pass-happy season of his career and, although his touches have decreased, he is maximizing them when they come. In his limited reps as a pick-and-roll ballhandler, for example, the Heat are averaging 1.17 points per possession, which is on par with the likes of Anthony Edwards (1.14), Damian Lillard (1.12) and Julius Randle (1.12). While nobody would confuse Robinson’s game with stars of that caliber, his basketball IQ remains strong and illustrates how much he’s developed his game. Sometimes, plays don’t even always have to go as planned to be valuable. Here is an example from Monday’s win. In the first quarter, Robinson took Kyle Lowry off the dribble and comfortably reached the paint before lobbing to Adebayo, who couldn’t complete the finish before Robinson tipped the ball to an open Highsmith. The 27-year-old wing was 3 of 3 from deep on Monday and is shooting a career-best 44.8 percent on 3s this season. Although Robinson is still seeking his game-to-game shooting touch, defenses are respecting the threat of him returning to form. Through Monday’s win, he’s shooting 32.7 percent on catch-and-shoot 3s after hitting 39.5 percent of such shots a season ago. But that rightfully doesn’t stop opponents from closing out hard to ensure Robinson doesn’t get hot on their watch, so he occasionally enjoys swinging the ball to open teammates like Butler. Robinson’s knack for moving off the ball can make defenses scramble to contest his open 3-point looks, especially when he’s wiggling free as opponents collapse on drives. Despite Robinson not shooting well from deep yet, Miami enters Wednesday ranked fourth among all teams in overall 3-point percentage this season (38.2). On the season, almost 27 percent of Robinson’s shot diet has come on 2-point attempts, which is on pace for the second-highest such mark of his career. Unfortunately, though, he’s making only a career-low 43.3 percent of those looks, signaling a steep falloff from last season (57.9). Such regression despite Miami succeeding in Robinson’s minutes could bode well for the Heat finding big-picture balance as the season plays out. Only four East teams enter Wednesday with a winning record. Despite late-game issues against the Detroit Pistons and Indiana Pacers, the Heat quietly sit 10th among all teams in net rating (plus-4.0) since Nov. 10, so the team has confidence in making a run sooner than later, right? “If you look at the core four [Butler, Adebayo, Herro, Robinson] and then you add ‘H,’ who’s been with us since the post-COVID year, those are the most experienced guys in our program,” Spoelstra explained on Monday. “So they understand exactly what we’re trying to get to — even though we’ve made some adjustments — they know what our core tenets are. They’ve had the most experience playing with various combinations with each other. That matters. This is such a transient league right now. That core probably has as much experience as anybody outside of Boston.” (Top photo: C. Morgan Engel / Getty Images ) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The league, which will tip off on Jan. 17, aims to keep players fresh and provide a domestic alternative to athletes looking to compete and supplement income during the WNBA offseason. Advertisement Unrivaled splits a pool of 34 players into six teams, with two teams having still-open wild card roster spots. To determine the rosters, players were organized into six pods — A through F — with each pod featuring guards, wings or bigs. The league’s six coaches then worked together to select one player from each pod, assigning them to one of the six clubs. The coaches set the rosters without knowing which team would be theirs to coach and worked to create well-rounded rosters. Unrivaled features most of the WNBA’s top players. It promises to pay the highest average salary in women’s professional sports league history and will give equity in the league to its inaugural participants, enabling the athletes to profit from it for years to come. The league has a long list of high-powered investors, including Alex Morgan, Carmelo Anthony, Steve Nash, Megan Rapinoe and former ESPN and Turner presidents John Skipper and David Levy.

Prior to her time as the Sky’s head coach, Weatherspoon was a player development coach and assistant coach with the New Orleans Pelicans. Handy, a three-time NBA champion, has been an NBA assistant coach for over a decade. Harrington is a former NBA player with a decade of experience as a shooting coach with the Oklahoma City Thunder as well as an assistant coach and director of player development with the Brooklyn Nets. GO DEEPER What is Unrivaled? A new league with Angel Reese and other WNBA stars Wade most recently served as the Mystics’ head video coordinator and player development assistant. Henry has collegiate coaching experience and recently wrapped up her fourth season in the WNBA as an assistant coach with the Sparks. Sackmann is an acclaimed NBA and WNBA skills coach with more than 15 years of experience. After player rosters were created, coaches were assigned one of the six teams. The season begins in January, with Collier and Stewart’s teams facing off in the opening game. It will run for eight weeks, concluding with a championship set for March 17. In mid-October, the league announced it had reached a multi-year deal with TNT Sports, and will have its games broadcast on TNT, TruTV and streamed on Max. Games will air on TNT on Monday and Friday nights, as well as Saturday night on TruTV. Advertisement In partnership with Mediapro North America, Unrivaled will host competition at a new, nearly 130,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art production facility in Miami. The facility will feature various spaces, including meeting rooms, training facilities, a cafeteria with nutritionists and a childcare room. The format of Unrivaled is a modified 3×3 game. The international version is a half-court game played to 21, while Unrivaled games will be four quarters. Unrivaled will also be played on a compressed full court that is about 70 feet long. The extra space is designed to give players room to showcase their skills and also reduce the wear and tear on their bodies. WNBA players have historically played overseas during the offseason to supplement their incomes from domestic salaries. However, playing year-round puts a strain on their bodies and requires personal sacrifices. It also often keeps WNBA players out of sight, and thus out of mind, for most of the year, hampering their marketability and the growth of the sport for months at a time. Unrivaled still has an open invite out to Clark regarding her participation in the league’s inaugural season, a source with knowledge of the situation tells The Athletic. That comes despite an ESPN report saying that Clark will not play in its inaugural season. Clark is currently not one of the 34 participants part of the league. League president Alex Bazzell previously told Sportico “we’re always going to have a roster spot” for Clark. Skipper, who is also an advisor to the league, confirmed on a recent episode of “Pablo Torre Finds Out” that Unrivaled has been in discussions with last year’s Rookie of the Year. That Unrivaled would have been interested in signing Clark is unsurprising. Clark and Collier have the same representation (Excel Sports Management), the league and Clark have at least one shared partner (State Farm), and Clark has proven to be a force capable of driving significant economic growth. All that is on top of her on-court impact. Still, she has not signed on. Advertisement “You look at Caitlin Clark, Sabrina Ionescu, there’s just so many out there that are incredible,” Harrington said Wednesday. His team, Phantom basketball club, has an open roster spot and could theoretically roster Clark. “They obviously are amazing needle-movers and incredible young women and basketball players. Any of that time it would be exciting to add players of that caliber.” Other WNBA stars, including A’ja Wilson and Ionescu, have also not currently joined Unrivaled. Even if they don’t participate in Unrivaled’s inaugural season, they could still play in the league in future years. UConn star Paige Bueckers will also not be playing in the league this season, although she signed an NIL deal with the league, making her the first NCAA athlete to receive ownership equity in a league.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,It's not just Crosby: Remembering 6 NHL legends whose careers ended with playoff droughts,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5932811/2024/11/20/nhl-sidney-crosby-playoff-drought/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:50:16 GMT",We’ve possibly seen the last of Crosby in NHL games that actually matter. Let's remember some other stars whose careers ended similarly.,"NHL Sidney Crosby is bumming me out these days. Not because he’s playing poorly. Quite the opposite — even at 37, he’s still scoring and playing a strong two-way game. No, the sad part is that it’s not anywhere near enough for the Pittsburgh Penguins. With a sub-.500 record in a surprisingly tough division, their season already looks like a lost cause. Advertisement If so, it will be the third straight year that Crosby misses the playoffs. And with two more years left on his extension, and little in the way of optimism that the aging Penguins can get any better, getting to five straight doesn’t seem unrealistic. Assuming he doesn’t push for a trade, it’s legitimately possible we’ve already seen the last of Sidney Crosby in NHL games that actually matter. Maybe things will turn around in Pittsburgh. But if not, Crosby could at least take some solace in knowing he won’t be the only legend to end his career with little or no playoff action. It happens more than you might think, especially regarding players who are still performing at a high level. You’d think the hockey gods would ensure every star gets the send-off they deserve, but for every Ray Bourque or Lanny McDonald or Mark Recchi who goes out on top, or even an Adam Oates who at least comes close, some stars never get that chance. Let’s remember a few of those guys, if only to make Sid feel better. OK, fine, to make me feel better about where Crosby might be headed. The consensus pick as the greatest leader in NHL history won two MVPs, a Conn Smythe Trophy and six Stanley Cups, including the one that snapped the Rangers’ 54-year drought. That came in 1994 when he was 33 and already had one of the greatest resumes in modern league history. Then he kept going. At first, that was fine. He helped lead the Rangers to the playoffs for three more seasons and even finished as Hart Trophy runner-up in 1996. But in 1997 he left for Vancouver. While that was a great signing for the Canucks, they missed the postseason in all three of Messier’s years there. He returned to the Rangers in 2000, just in time to be part of four more playoff-less seasons. Add it all up, and that’s seven straight years across two different teams that the sport’s greatest leader couldn’t lead his team to the postseason. He finally retired at the end of the 2005 lockout at 44, and the Rangers immediately made the playoffs without him. Sadness index: At the time, it was pretty high. But since we all apparently had a big meeting at some point and agreed to never mention this again, I guess I have to nudge it down to an 8/10. By 1994, Pavel Bure was a first-team All-Star, had just posted his second straight 60-goal season and had helped lead the Canucks to an inspiring playoff run that fell just one game short of the franchise’s first championship, over which he’d scored a postseason-leading 16 goals. Oh, and he had just turned 23. The sky was the limit. We thought. Advertisement One season later, the Canucks were swept in the second round. We couldn’t have guessed it at the time, but that opening-round victory featured the last playoff game Bure ever won. Vancouver made the playoffs again in 1996, going out in the first round, but Bure was hurt and couldn’t play. The Canucks missed the playoffs in 1997 and 1998, after which Bure was traded to the Panthers in the offseason. He spent three full seasons in Florida where despite leading the league in goals twice, he only saw playoff action once — a four-game sweep to the Devils in 2000. Like every star on the wrong side of his 30s in that era, Bure was eventually traded to the Rangers, where he was part of those late-era Messier teams that missed the playoffs each year. By the time injuries had cut his career short, he’d played his final eight seasons for three teams without winning a single playoff game. Sadness index: 7/10. At least he made the playoffs, albeit briefly. But like a few guys on our list, he gets bonus marks because he never did win a Cup. Nobody in a generation had come into the league with more hype than Eric Lindros, and for eight seasons he largely lived up to it. It took him two years to get the rebuilding Flyers into the playoffs, but between 1995 and 1997 he led the team to six wins in nine rounds, culminating in a trip to the 1997 Final that saw Lindros post a league-leading 26 postseason points. It turned out to be the peak of a career that was about to be decimated by injuries. Lindros and the Flyers made a first-round exit in 1998, and he missed the 1999 postseason due to injury. Another injury set the stage for a dramatic comeback in the 2000 conference finals, which ended in one of the most dramatic moments of the era. That was the last game Lindros played for the Flyers. He sat out a year to recover and force a trade, then spent three years with that pre-lockout Rangers team that keeps showing up here. After the lockout it was on to a season with the messy Maple Leafs, who missed the playoffs, and then a final season in Dallas. He did make the playoffs that year, returning to the postseason for the first time since the Scott Stevens hit. But the Stars lost in the first round, and Lindros was only healthy enough to contribute three games without points. Advertisement The career totals from the moment Lindros ran into Stevens’ shoulder: Seven years, five seasons, three playoff games, zero points. Sadness index: 9/10. Still one of hockey’s all-time “What if he’d stayed healthy?” stories. Alex Delvecchio’s career was one of the longest — 24 seasons in all — and most productive in NHL history. It was also spent entirely with the Red Wings, which will give you a sense of where this story is going. Playoff success came early. Delvecchio’s first full season was in 1951-52, joining a Red Wings powerhouse that already featured legends like Gordie Howe, Ted Lindsay, Red Kelly and Terry Sawchuk. Not only did they win the Cup that year — they didn’t lose a single playoff game while doing it. They won in 1954 and 1955, too, meaning Delvecchio had three rings before he turned 23. While that would be it for championships, Delvecchio and the Red Wings were playoff regulars throughout the rest of the Original Six era, including five trips to the Final. But expansion signaled the end of the Red Wings as contenders and the end of Delvecchio’s playoff success; they lost in the 1966 Final and then fell out of the playoff hunt. The future Hall of Famer played for Detroit until early in the 1973-1974 season, at which point he retired and took over as head coach and (shortly after) general manager. He held both of those roles until 1977. But in those 11 years spent as player, coach and GM after the 1966 final, Delvecchio and the Wings only saw postseason action once — in 1970, when they were swept in the first round. They didn’t win a single playoff game in the last decade-plus of Delvecchio’s career with the team. Sadness index: Sadness? More like darkness. As in the Darkness with Harkness, which is what that era of Red Wings hockey came to be known as in (dis)honor of early ’70s GM Ned Harkness. The Wings didn’t win another seven-game series until 1987. This might feel like piling on, given Marcel Dionne almost certainly has history’s highest ratio of regular-season-to-playoff success. He retired as the second most productive scorer the NHL had ever seen, and still ranks sixth, but somehow never even made it out of the second round. So, sure, maybe you wouldn’t expect him to have much of a late-career playoff resume. And sure enough, he has just two appearances in his last six seasons, both first-round exits that lasted a combined nine games. Advertisement The frustrating piece here is that, unlike players like Crosby or Delvecchio, Dionne wasn’t loyal to just one struggling franchise. He orchestrated his way out of Detroit in the ’70s and headed to L.A. for a second chapter while still in his prime. And he finished his career with the Rangers — yes, them again — when they were at least a solid playoff team and not too far from legitimate Cup contenders. So, what happened? After missing the postseason in his final year with the Kings, he was traded to the Rangers at the 1987 deadline. They made it but went out in Round 1, and then missed the playoffs a year later despite Dionne scoring nearly a point per game at age 36. And then, with the Rangers headed toward a playoff berth midway through the 1988-89 season, Dionne just … quit. Tired of ongoing squabbles with the Rangers front office, he retired midway through the season and started a dry-cleaning company. Sadness index: 8/10. Um, maybe nobody tell Crosby about that whole “retiring to become a dry cleaner” option. There’s still one name to go, but first … While it’s not quite at the same level as some of these other stories, Wayne Gretzky missed the playoffs in each of his last two seasons, as did Jarome Iginla and Paul Kariya. Pat LaFontaine, Roberto Luongo and Jonathan Toews missed in three, while Ryan Getzlaf and Theo Fleury missed the playoffs in each of their last four seasons. And Brian Leetch was yet another casualty of those pre-lockout Rangers; he only made the playoffs once in his final eight seasons. OK, on to our final name. As if we weren’t bringing down Penguins fans enough. Yes, we have to mention Mario, whose emotional comeback allowed his unparalleled career to overlap with Crosby’s for one partial season. That comeback came in December 2000, a midseason stunner that still ranks as one of the greatest nights I can remember. (The banner being lowered still gets things a little dusty around here.) Lemieux basically picked up where he’d left off, which is to say making everyone else in the league look silly. He led the Penguins to the playoffs where they won two rounds before bowing out in the conference finals. Advertisement Unfortunately, while Lemieux played parts of four more seasons, that 2001 run spelled the end of his playoff story. The Penguins missed the postseason in each of the last three years before the lockout, and then again in 2005-06. That season was Crosby’s debut and Lemieux played the final 26 games of his career. After two Stanley Cups, two Conn Smythes and a borderline ridiculous 1.60 points-per-game playoff resume, Lemieux didn’t get a postseason invite in any of his final four seasons. Sadness index: 6.6/10. This was awful because we missed out on Mario’s playoff brilliance, but we were just glad to have him back at all. And Pittsburgh fans knew the team was in good hands with the passing of the torch to this Crosby kid, who’d lead them to 16 straight postseason appearances before … well, you know.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Draymond Green, others pay the price for being the NBA's old men on D",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5934474/2024/11/20/nba-defense-old-draymond-green-alex-caruso/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:27:51 GMT",The league's best defenders usually peak in their 30s. It takes grueling work to keep up with young offensive stars.,"NBA Grown-man strength, Draymond Green’s had it since he was knee-high to a grasshopper. Even as a chubby teen, he possessed the bone density of a longshoreman and the urgency of a single father. He calls it grit. An intangible element that holds up when bigger players try to push him around. That allows him to do the pushing. It made him a champion at Saginaw High, at Michigan State, with the Golden State Warriors. Grit was his foundation as he became a starting NBA forward, the closing center on a dynasty, a Defensive Player of the Year. All-natural Midwestern strength. Advertisement But Green entered his 30s. The games piled up, the playoff battles took their toll. His knees, his back, his fortitude all suffered under the stress of life as a defensive anchor. So Green started doing something he never did before, something his natural strength never required him to do. Lift weights. It’s worked wonders. He’s just under four months from turning 35. Yet, he’s off to yet another DPOY campaign. “One thing I learned over the last four years or so,” Green said, “you have to lift weights. And I was someone who was always naturally strong. So I’m like, ‘What I’ma lift weights for? These motherf—–s can’t move me now.’ But your body needs it. Your body needs to get stronger as the season goes on to be able to withstand the pounding.” If a player’s shooting ability is the last to go, then defense is the first. It’s a grueling craft, defending. The agility necessary for constant reacting. The endurance required when constantly under attack. The physical demands of providing pressure. The humility needed to sustain against greatness, often absent adoration. It wears on one’s joints and ligaments, muscles and bones, ego and energy. A long tooth is the mark of prey in this kingdom. The young eat the old. That’s what makes the breed of OG defenders so impressive. The league is as wide-open as ever. Shooting and ballhandling at every position. Speed and athleticism and skill all over the floor. Imagine being 30-plus, a decade deep into your career and still locking up. Causing problems. Doing the Lord’s work. And if you’ve ever had to take to the court to put a trash-talking youngster in his place, teach a niece or nephew or cousin how all that goofy dribbling doesn’t work against real defense, and paid for it in your knees and back hours later, you appreciate what they do. You know they’re different. Advertisement These dudes are uniquely wired. Their glory is in preventing it, an inglorious task. “Yeah, it’s taxing,” said Oklahoma City guard Alex Caruso, reputed as one of the best perimeter defenders in the game. “But that comes with the job. It’s taxing for the guys trying to score just as much as it is for guys trying to stop the people from scoring. It just looks worse for us because we usually are the ones that end up on the floor. But it’s a part of the game that I embrace — just doing the dirty work and being the guy to mix it up.” Their significance has increased in a skill-centered league, where defense was so disregarded people had to beg the NBA to take a stand against soft whistles and foul-grifters. A player who can be a defensive force, make it a chore to score, be effective guarding multiple positions, be comfortable on an island without the aid of help, is invaluable. But that means they’ve got to hang on, maintain their excellence beyond typical benchmarks. That absolutely requires maintaining their bodies. Especially the lower half. “Basketball is a two-way sport,” Boston’s Jrue Holiday said. “So as much as you train to do stuff offensively, you probably need to do the same thing defensively. … I think I’ve been doing that most of my life. Maybe not in the weight room, but doing defensive slides, wall sits, things that help with your legs, help with your base. I’ve done that since I was little. But then once you kind of add weights to it, getting in the gym or in the weight room, I feel like it helps.” Green said he “didn’t know what a f—ing core was” until a back injury in 2022 prompted some changes. He stopped relying solely on grown-man strength and developed his core and base strength. Now he’s on a mission to win another Defensive Player of the Year Award. His lone honor came in 2017 — well before they changed the name to the Hakeem Olajuwon Trophy. Green finished second to Kawhi Leonard in 2016. Advertisement Entering Tuesday, the Warriors were holding teams to 41.9 percent shooting (third in the NBA) and 110.1 points per game (seventh). They allowed 107.3 points per 100 possessions (fourth). And there is zero question Green is the genius at the hub of the defense. He starts games as the power forward, serving as a free safety to employ his elite help-side defense. He closes games as the center and last line of defense. And he’ll hop on any player who heats up, whether point guard or elite scoring wing. If Green pulls this off, he’d be the oldest player ever to win Defensive Player of the Year. The current oldest is the late Dikembe Mutombo, who won it at 34 in 2001. Over the last 10 seasons, 25 of the 100 All-NBA Defensive slots went to players age 30 or older. Eight of them made First Team, though one of them was a throwback defensive bully who was still going into his mid-30s named Tony Allen. He was more from the ilk of the previous era. In the 10 seasons before (2004-05 to 2013-14) players aged 30 and up took up 35 All-NBA Defensive spots. And 11 of them made the First Team, 12 if you count Allen originally with that contingency. Back in the day, when the game was more physical and Steph Curry hadn’t yet changed the geometry of defense, it was more common for older players to be stalwarts on defense. The 2007 All-NBA Defensive squad was dominated by 30-somethings. Seven were named: Bruce Bowen (35), Jason Kidd (34), Marcus Camby (33), Ben Wallace (32), Tim Duncan (31), Raja Bell (30) and Kevin Garnett (30). Kobe Bryant, 28 at the time, was the only first-teamer under 30. But since the 3-point era exploded with Golden State, which won its first title of the era in 2015, no more than three players aged 30-and-up made it in a single year. At least, not until last season when bigs Rudy Gobert and Anthony Davis, both 31 at the time, and then-30-year-old Caruso joined Holiday among the recognized best defenders. Giannis Antetokounmpo will likely join them this year. They represent a contingent of players who maintain their place in the league of youngsters because they are still down to slap the floor. Especially on the perimeter. Derrick White, Josh Hart, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Andrew Wiggins, Norman Powell, Kris Dunn, Marcus Smart, Royce O’Neale, Gary Payton II — they’re all in their 30s or will be by season’s end. They are the foes of this new wave of absurd offensive talent. Advertisement More are coming behind them, including Mikal Bridges (28) and Bam Adebayo (27). Their advantage is savvy. They’ve seen so much, experienced just about every attack. Their IQ becomes a weapon. Old heads who make their money on defense don’t slack on film, especially in a league ripe with a steady influx of ballers. “I’m better at reading people’s games,” Holiday said, “and what they like to do.” Caruso is surrounded by Gen Z hoopers on the Thunder. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is one of the most unstoppable in the league. Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren are also dynamic offensively. But Oklahoma City also has a few with same mindset as Caruso, the same spirit. They get after it defensively. They live in the margins of hustle and aggression. They have an appetite for the ugly parts of the game. “Lu Dort and Cason Wallace are two of the best on-ball defenders in this league,” Caruso said. “It gives me perspective, just seeing how good these guys are. … Honestly, I’m trying to pick up stuff from them just to try and further evolve my game and become a better defender myself.” The youth help keep the older defenders fresh. They’ve got to practice what they are preaching when sharing defensive recipes with the next wave. Being on top of your game is required when shadowing the likes of Luka Dončić, Ja Morant and Paolo Banchero. “All of them, for real,” Holiday said when asked which young players give him the most trouble. “They’re all quick. They’re all very, very athletic. They all play the game a lot differently than when I came into the league. So literally all of them.” That’s why they’re different. The game has changed significantly. They morphed with it. Defense is a vocation, a science and an art form. It requires a lunch pail, a scientific calculator for a brain and often rhetorical prowess. Advertisement Because this new era is teeming with confidence. “These young dudes talk a lot of s—,” Green said. “The ones talking the most this year was them Wizards youngsters. Kyshawn George and …” “Bub,” Curry yelled from a distance, speaking of Wizards rookie guard Carlton Carrington. “Talking the whole game,” Green continued. “Obviously, I love it. I don’t mind it at all. It’s just weird to run into that space where they’re like, ‘Man, I watched you my whole life.’ And then they’re talking crazy. ‘Go at his old a–!’ … The year before Kelly Oubre came here, he was like ‘You had your run. You old now.’ But I was in Year 8, Year 9.” Not old. But his age has finally caught up to his strength.

The venue for the Bayern match needed changing as it clashed with the men’s Carabao Cup quarter-final against Crystal Palace, scheduled to be played at the Emirates on the same night (Wednesday, December 18). Advertisement Arsenal began liaising with UEFA shortly after the clash became apparent, with Crystal Palace’s schedule determining that the men’s game would go ahead at the Emirates. In her pre-Juventus press conference, Slegers said: “I was playing for Arsenal’s academy in 2006, so I know how big Arsenal have been over time in women’s football. That’s why I came to England. “So historically, Arsenal has been leading in pushing the development of women’s football and I think it will do that in the future as well. This was a bump in the road, which will always happen. “It’s like player development, you will not go up in a straight line, there will be challenges on the way. This is a challenge, but we’re all very proud of what Arsenal tries to do to push women’s football forward.” Confirmation of the move came on Tuesday, December 19, with UEFA granting “special dispensation” to play at Meadow Park — their ground, shared with Boreham Wood and Arsenal Under-21s, before moving 11 of their home matches to the Emirates this season. Arsenal also announced that supporters who already purchased tickets for the Bayern match would receive full refunds and a 24-hour priority access window to purchase a new ticket. The game will be Arsenal’s final group game of the Champions League, with this week’s fixture against Juventus their fourth. Having beaten the Italian side 4-0 last week, a win could put them six points clear in second place with two games to play. It will also be the last of a block of seven games in which Slegers has been in interim charge since the departure of former head coach, Jonas Eidevall. Slegers has led the side to five wins and a draw in six games so far. When asked about her future she said: “I will take a little three-day break (after Juventus) and then will be back at the training ground with the players who are at home and not away with their national teams. Advertisement “About what will happen after the international break, I really don’t have my mind set on that. I’m learning loads, but I haven’t come to that stage yet.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Can Clippers continue to stay competitive while also developing homegrown talent?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5934454/2024/11/20/clippers-jordan-miller-development-nba/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:24:47 GMT",The Clippers have a winning record. But should they be prioritizing young players like Jordan Miller and Kobe Brown?,"NBA After the LA Clippers concluded the preseason last month, coach Tyronn Lue was asked about balancing winning games with player development. The query was prompted by the play of small forward Jordan Miller, a 2023 second-round pick who had spent the previous G League season, NBA Summer League season and preseason impressing with his ability to produce points within the scheme, shoot efficiently and make plays defensively. Advertisement Lue praised G League affiliate head coach Paul Hewitt for helping develop Miller and 2023 first-round pick Kobe Brown. But Lue has a roster of veterans who were signed to play, making him noncommittal to handing young guys like Miller a rotation spot. “We have veteran guys that can play, we have young guys that can play,” Lue said last month. “So whatever the best fit is for our team to win games, that’s who we’re going to play. So I’m not really looking at who we want to develop — we want to win. So those guys like Kobe and Jordan, if they take those steps forward to play and help us win games, then they’ll play.” Pressed further on picking between winning and developing, Lue reiterated where he stood. “Guys will develop if they’re good players,” Lue said. “If they’re good enough to be in our rotation to play and help us win games — we’re trying to win. So if there’s a veteran guy who can’t play, he can’t play … we’re trying to win. That’s my main objective.” Playing young players has usually been a sore spot for the Clippers, and for Lue even before he joined the Clippers. Before a November 2021 game against the San Antonio Spurs, Lue responded to a question about not playing young guys by saying, “I did it for six games in Cleveland, you see where it got me!” The 2018-19 Cleveland Cavaliers started 0-6 in their first season after LeBron James left for the Los Angeles Lakers, resulting in Lue’s dismissal. That same season, the Clippers had their last All-Rookie selection in lottery pick Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who was traded after his rookie season for Paul George in a deal that also cost LA control of seven first-round picks. Gilgeous-Alexander played at least 15 minutes in a game 87 times as a rookie, including the postseason. Since Gilgeous-Alexander left in 2019, all Clippers rookies have played in a game for at least 15 minutes only 69 times combined. Advertisement It is easy to accept young players not playing for a contending team. That’s what the Clippers were set up to be in each season with George and Kawhi Leonard on the roster, with the possible exception of the 2021-22 season in which Leonard missed the entire schedule after ACL surgery and George only appeared in 31 regular-season games. George’s departure, and Leonard’s elongated recovery from knee surgery, have taken this season’s Clippers out of contender/pretender conversations. The goal for this year’s team is to retain the league’s longest active streak of winning seasons, which began in the 2011-12 season and was threatened most by Clippers teams that missed the playoffs in 2017-18 and 2021-22 with 42-40 records. These Clippers are looking a lot like those 2018 and 2022 teams. They are 8-7 entering Wednesday night’s game against the Orlando Magic, and probably could be better, as they have led by double-digits at some point in 13 out of 15 games. The Clippers have a top-10 defense while rolling out the NBA’s second-oldest roster, behind only the Milwaukee Bucks. But many fans are dissatisfied with the Clippers not having players like Miller, Brown, and third-string point guard Bones Hyland in the rotation, especially in a season where 35-year-old point guard James Harden leads the team in minutes and 31-year-old shooting guard Norman Powell leads the team in scoring. Perhaps Miller’s time in particular is coming; Powell will miss the Orlando Magic game with a left hamstring strain, an injury that usually requires a multi-game absence. Lue has had chances to make Miller a part of his rotation before, but none of his top nine players (excluding the inactive Leonard) had missed a game because of injury until now, and Lue just got back reserve center Mo Bamba. The Houston road trip last week looked like a possible opportunity for Miller, Brown and Hyland to play. In the first game of the miniseries, the Clippers found themselves down 19 before going with a more sensible lineup that put Brown at center instead of one with no bigs on the floor. With a minute left, the ball was in Miller’s hands with a chance to cut the Houston lead to one, but he missed a corner 3 and the Clippers never scored again. Advertisement Afterward, Lue praised Miller, Brown and Hyland for making an impact.

The Rockets were prepared for Lue’s starting lineup change from the previous game that put Kris Dunn in place of Terance Mann, and the Clippers never led. Miller did not enter the game until the Clippers were down 20 in the fourth quarter with 10:23 left to play, but his elite ability to draw fouls (11 points, 9 of 10 free throws) against the Houston regulars caught Lue’s attention.

Both Boston and Diabaté were developed by the Clippers’ G League team, and each had notable performances with LA. Their progress as with the Clippers organization is partly why they are still in the league. Unfortunately, both players had instances where they were either injured at a time they would have gotten a chance to play or did not impress when given a window of opportunity last season. The Clippers went with other players on rookie, two-way, or minimum contracts instead of retaining Boston or Diabaté. It remains to be seen if Boston or Diabaté’s current squads value either enough to promote them to standard contracts or continue playing them once players ahead of them return to full health. As much as people fear that Miller will not get an opportunity, he has two relevant examples on the roster for optimism: Mann and shooting guard Amir Coffey. The Clippers are one of eight teams who have both a homegrown second-rounder and a homegrown undrafted free agent playing at least 15 minutes per game on the roster this season. Mann was the 48th pick in 2019, while southpaw Coffey signed a two-year, two-way contract like the one fellow lefthander Miller is on now. Another criticism related to Lue and player development is the size of the rotation. Lue usually prefers to go with a nine-man rotation, but he has expanded to 10 this season — though the reluctance to play Jones extended minutes has made it more of a 9.5-man rotation. This is in contrast to teams like the Oklahoma City Thunder or the Golden State Warriors, who have regularly used more than 10 players. The Warriors are 10-2. 11 players average 15+ minutes per game
(Lindy Waters III and Gary Payton II just miss the cut, De’Anthony Melton is injured, Kevon Looney is ill and is out tonight) 8-10 players have played 15+ minutes in each of the 12 games. Steve Kerr on rotations🔊 pic.twitter.com/kSmvebK8Uq — Law Murray 🕯️ (@LawMurrayTheNU) November 19, 2024  Incidentally, the Clippers are coming off of an impressive result (albeit in an eyesore of a game) Monday night against the Warriors, beating them on zero days’ rest for the second time this season already. Mann and Coffey were a part of a bench that outscored the vaunted Warriors reserves 45-28 in a 102-99 win. Advertisement It’s not that Lue doesn’t believe in his developmental corps. He has already shown that he can get off of lineups that hurt the team. Developing talent has never been mutually exclusive with winning games. With Powell out, it gives the Clippers the chance to put Miller on the floor and let him show that he can contribute in a meaningful way. It’s also a layup for a relatively disgruntled fan base that wants to cheer for the rare homegrown player. And Miller knows that he needs to be ready to perform if he gets a chance. “Trust in the training, trust in the work you’ve been putting in when you haven’t been playing,” Miller says.

Marinos. Holland, 54, has been out of management since departing his role with England alongside Gareth Southgate following the 2024 European Championship final defeat to Spain. Advertisement He is now expected take up the position with J1 League side Marinos, a club with whom the City Group own a minority stake, in what would represent his first head coach role in 16 years. Marinos have been without a permanent manager since the dismissal of former Liverpool and Leeds United forward Harry Kewell in July, with the Australian’s assistant John Hutchinson taking interim charge. Holland was assistant manager to Southgate throughout his eight years in charge of the national team as England reached two European Championship finals and the World Cup semi-finals in 2018. At the 2022 World Cup, Holland made a comment about Ben White that the Arsenal defender took issue with. White and Holland are said to have spoken afterwards to clear it up, but the 27-year-old later left camp and has not played for England since. Holland joined the England set-up on a full-time basis in 2016 following eight years at Chelsea, where he worked as assistant manager to Andre Villas-Boas, Roberto Di Matteo, Rafa Benitez, Jose Mourinho, Guus Hiddink and Antonio Conte. His only previous first-team managerial role came at Crewe Alexandra between 2007 and 2008, having worked his way up from youth coach at the club. Marinos are five-time J1 League champions, most recently in 2022, and are ninth in the 20-team table with two league matches of the 2024 season remaining. They are also third in their AFC Champions League group. Marinos are owned by Nissan but City Football Group — the multi-club model that holds majority stakes in teams including Manchester City, New York City and Melbourne City — has a 20 per cent stake in them. Tottenham Hotspur head coach Ange Postecoglou led the team between 2018 and 2021, guiding them to their first J1 League title in 15 years.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Christian Pulisic, the Donald Trump dance and why true leaders consider the impact of their actions",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5934687/2024/11/20/christian-pulisic-donald-trump-dance-usmnt/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:02:36 GMT",The furore over his Trump-inspired goal celebration may teach U.S. Soccer's leading light that leadership leaves little room for gray areas,"Dancing, whether well-executed or outright flailsome, is among the earliest forms of human communication. From the ancient and cultural performances that endure across generations to joining in for the Cha-Cha Slide at a family wedding, dance is a way to convey messages, meaning, emotion. Christian Pulisic likes to dance. His love for moving his body isn’t a newfound fad or a reluctant participation after scoring his increasingly frequent goals. During his time with Chelsea, he occasionally made the rounds on TikTok trying out the platform’s craze of the week.  @christianmpulisic #chelseafc #christianpulisic #fyp #covid #quarentine #dougie #dortmund #premierleague #england #usmnt #dancing #cp10  ♬ original sound – CP10    Is he our generation’s Bob Fosse? Of course not. His footwork is instead scrutinized in the context of a soccer match. He still seems to enjoy dancing quite a bit, as many an amateur hoofer does, and is eager to tap into TikTok’s endless carousel of moves — even when the latest trend takes direct influence from the polarizing president-elect Donald Trump. Advertisement Pulisic also likes playing for the United States men’s national team. His Chelsea tenure saw the national team become a safe haven of sorts for Pennsylvania’s native son, a team for which he could play with more freedom and confidence than he could for the London club. His history with the USMNT predates TikTok’s launch by half a year, so one may surmise his role on the team is more important to him than how well he can hit the griddy (ask your kids). Actually, we don’t have to guess. After his team’s 4-2 win over Jamaica on Monday night, the 26-year-old reflected on his stature on the USMNT in light of making the CONCACAF Nations League semifinal. “I am grateful to be in this position,” Pulisic said. “Obviously, I have been in this team for quite a while. I’m kind of like a veteran on this team. I enjoy it. I hope I can be a good leader, especially to some of the young players, and continue to push this team.” No doubt, this is not the quote from him you’ve seen most often from that post-match availability. It came after he faced a pair of inquiries about his celebration of the opening goal, where he did the two-handed gesture that was a hallmark of Trump’s during his ultimately triumphant run to regain the United States presidency. “Well obviously, that’s the Trump dance,” Pulisic said. “It was just a dance that everyone’s doing. He’s the one who created it. I just thought it was funny.” And when asked if copying Trump’s wiggle constituted a political statement: “No, not at all,” Pulisic said. “It’s not a political dance. It was just for fun. I saw a bunch of people do it and I thought it was funny, so I enjoyed it. I hope some people did, at least.” Pulisic can dance if he wants to. Any fan of 1980s one-hit wonders knows that. But it’s one thing to say you’re a leader and another to do what leaders do: consider how their actions will be perceived by their teammates and others. And yes, that extends to dances — especially when you’re literally mimicking the dance of an elected leader. Rather than any of the countless apolitical shimmies he could have chosen, this was a deliberate reference. Advertisement Depending on who you ask, his dance either became a loud sideshow to the most promising team performance of Mauricio Pochettino’s tenure to date, or it overshadowed it on an international stage. Look for coverage around the world and searching “Pulisic dance” draws more hits from non-American outlets than “USMNT Jamaica Nations League”. Some things are bigger than soccer, no matter how impressive the build-up to a goal was. The ramifications of Trump’s election will have an immeasurably greater impact on citizens of the nation that Pulisic represents — as well as those of the countries who serve as the USMNT’s opponents — than anything he or any player will accomplish on the pitch. Clips of the Milan winger’s celebration were shared widely in all corners social media. Whether Pulisic likes it or not, copying Trump’s gesture has transcended sports. Outlets across the political spectrum that seldom cover sports picked up on the fact that the most notable male soccer player from the United States co-opted the move. Social media accounts packaged the clip to serve their purposes — whether positioning Pulisic as a champion of the candidate who won the 2024 election’s popular vote, or admonishing him for paying tribute to a president-elect who has promised radical change that’ll be felt by many groups of people who aren’t heterosexual white men. Sport’s global superstars are given a massive platform and, with it, corresponding responsibility. It isn’t unique to the American sports landscape. When Christmas comes next month, many will be watching whether or not Mohamed Salah — who is Muslim — will continue his near-annual tradition of posting season’s greetings. Innocuous acts like dancing or donning matching red-and-green pajamas with one’s family can resonate. Pulisic is now in a new phase of his playing career. The detractors of his performance with Chelsea have faded as he continues to tear up Serie A, and he’s generally assessed among the most in-form attackers on the planet. While he’s been the face of the USMNT for over half a decade, his global stock has never been higher. Advertisement In the immediate wake of a presidential election which carries tremendous global consequence, even a dance move is going to be studied closely as an embodiment of his nation’s tenor. He may not realize how Trump’s views on immigration could impact his dual-national teammates and their families. Regardless, this is a case where a dance conveys a meaning well beyond a simple gesture. With his nation co-hosting the World Cup in 2026, having the captain and face of the USMNT paying homage to Trump carries outsized subtext, intended or not. It doesn’t matter if Pulisic wants that responsibility to consider perception. That comes with being a leader. He can cite eagerness to embrace that type of role but in light of Monday’s dance move, he’d be wise to consider what that distinction truly entails.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Why the Blues broke longstanding tradition for 2025 Winter Classic jersey,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5930176/2024/11/20/blues-2025-winter-classic-jersey/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:01:51 GMT",The design on the front of the jersey breaks a tradition that has been an integral part of the franchise's 57-year history.,"NHL ST. LOUIS — Taking your first look at the St. Louis Blues jersey for the 2025 Winter Classic, you’ll notice something is missing. For the first time in the franchise’s 57-year history, there’s no Blue Note on the chest. That’s no accident. The team chose a design for its game against the Chicago Blackhawks at Wrigley Field on Dec. 31 that will instead have “St. Louis” across the front of players’ jerseys. Advertisement “The Blues logo is iconic and one of the most recognizable in sports,” said Steve Chapman, executive vice president and chief revenue and marketing officer with the Blues. “Yeah, we could have put the Note on the front of it. “But for us to proudly display the name of the city that we’re from, that was really our approach. We just feel like this reflected the moment, the event, and will showcase the city well. It was something we really wanted to do.” The Blues revealed the jersey Wednesday morning, but The Athletic got a sneak peek Tuesday afternoon and interviewed the staff members who were in charge of its creation. In addition to Chapman, Brenda Wilbur, the Blues’ VP of brand, retail and creative services, led the project. She said it was the NHL that originally presented the idea of a Blues’ jersey without the Blue Note on the chest. “We loved it,” Wilbur said. “I just love that it says ‘St. Louis’ on the front. We’ve never done that in such a bold way. This really clearly states ‘This is our team and this is our jersey.’ It falls in line with the prior two Winter Classics but still has its own distinct and feel.” While there won’t be a Blue Note on the front, there is one on the top of the left shoulder. There is a Winter Classic logo on the right shoulder. “The NHL (version) originally didn’t have the Note on the top,” Wilbur said. “I said, ‘You’ve got to have the Note.’ When you’re doing that first transition away from having the Note on the center of the jersey, you definitely need it on the shoulder.” The Blues will be the visiting team in Chicago, so the color of the jersey will be the road white, or beige in this case. There is a wide blue stripe across the chest with “St. Louis” written in yellow and outlined in white, and the same goes for the striping on the shoulders. “We had some options with the royal, which is our traditional primary color, but we just felt staying within the Winter Classic colorway, that heritage colorway, was what we should do for the Winter Classic,” Wilbur said. The font style of the jersey — both on the chest and the shoulders — is similar to the Blues’ 1966 prototype jersey, which they used for their yellow reverse-retro edition. Advertisement “So that kind of ties into that as well,” Wilbur said. The Blues got high marks for their previous two Winter Classic jerseys — an off-white base with colored striping when they played against Minnesota at Target Field in 2022 and a heritage-style lighter blue with yellow and white striping when they hosted Chicago at Busch Stadium in 2017. They chose to stick with that traditional classic look. “The first one, I won’t say it was easy, but it easily came to our minds,” Chapman said. “The second one was the road version, which was our first chance to step outside of that path a little bit. I think every team has a personality, and ours was to stay classic and true to history. I think the St. Louis Blues are a classic look, so I think this accomplishes that. We’re playing at Wrigley Field. From an overall feel, when you’re playing in the ‘Friendly Confines,’ you want to reflect the moment a little bit, so that was part of it.” The NHL and Fanatics worked with the Blues to make sure their eventual choice fit the style of the Winter Classic uniforms and was a match to what Chicago will be wearing. GO DEEPER Blackhawks' new NHL Winter Classic jersey leaks “The design team was great,” Chapman said. “They listened and understood where we were coming from. It’s a collaboration. It’s a league event and you do need to play off each other — the two teams. You can’t just say, ‘Well, we’re going to go off on our own way.’ It was a real strong collaborative effort and they were great to work with.” Now that the jersey is out of the bag, the Blues hope fans like it as much as previous ones. “So far, everyone we’ve shown it to internally, which includes a lot of St. Louis people, have loved it,” Chapman said. “I think it’s going to resonate. I’ve been here for 10 years and (have) been educated on the history, and I just think it’s a cool addition.” GO DEEPER Blackhawks, Blues Winter Classic jerseys unveiled, pay tribute to Chicago, St. Louis history (Top photo of Brayden Schenn courtesy of Fanatics) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How did the Raiders roster get so bad? A series of unfortunate events,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5933671/2024/11/20/las-vegas-raiders-roster-bad-talent-depth/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:00:37 GMT","Light on talent and short on depth, the cupboard is pretty bare for first-year GM Tom Telesco and rookie head coach Antonio Pierce.","NFL As the losses pile up, the buzzword around the Las Vegas Raiders the last couple of weeks has been communication. The offensive linemen need to speak more loudly to each other. The defensive backs can’t just drop coverage on one receiver to follow another one, especially if the first one is strolling toward the end zone. GO DEEPER After poor communication leads Raiders to another loss, 'pride' is all that's left to play for Here’s another buzzword — talent. As in, the 2-8 Raiders don’t have as much talent as their opponents, a point made abundantly clear during this six-game losing streak, thanks to a bad job of roster-building the last couple of years. The failings of the Jon Gruden/Mike Mayock regime, aka how they essentially wasted six first-round picks in three years, are well documented. (Josh Jacobs was a good pick, but the Raiders let the free-agent running back leave for Green Bay this spring.) Advertisement But the Raiders have very little to show for 2022 and 2023 draft classes of former general manager Dave Ziegler, not to mention the first- and second-round picks they gave up for Davante Adams. And let’s not even get started on the 2022 free-agent signing of Chandler Jones. It seems like first-year GM Tom Telesco was aware of the roster’s shortcomings, and his longer-range approach to team building explains why he didn’t go all in this past offseason. The team had one big free-agent signing — defensive tackle Christian Wilkins — as Telesco turned one of the league’s oldest rosters (29th youngest in 2023) into a much younger one (12th youngest in 2024). Telesco did give Gardner Minshew II $15 million guaranteed to be the latest Band-Aid quarterback … and there has been a lot of blood, as Minshew is second in the league in turnovers. So, no gold star for Telesco despite what appears to be a nice draft class. Coach Antonio Pierce fired three offensive assistants during the bye week, so obviously there is some pressure from above to win (at least every now and then). But when he, Telesco and owner Mark Davis meet up after the season to discuss Pierce’s future — maybe Tom Brady will Zoom in, too — there has to be a serious discussion about how the roster was so thin it couldn’t weather all the injuries on defense or Adams’ trade to the Jets. Let’s look at the roster position-by-position to see where it all went wrong:  Ziegler gave quarterback Derek Carr, tight end Darren Waller and receiver Hunter Renfrow contract extensions, and coach Josh McDaniels quickly tired of them all. The worst part is that the Raiders gave Carr a no-trade clause and had to cut him instead of getting something in return via trade. Then last year, Ziegler and McDaniels brought in their fellow former Patriot, Jimmy Garoppolo, after their other former Patriot, Brady, decided to retire for good. Advertisement Garoppolo made it to the end of last season, unlike Ziegler and McDaniels, but backed up rookie Aidan O’Connell for the last nine games. The Raiders would have liked O’Connell to beat out Minshew in training camp, but that didn’t happen. O’Connell did replace a benched Minshew and started in Weeks 6 and 7 before breaking his thumb. He is expected back in a week or two. The Raiders were unable to trade up for one of the several quarterbacks they liked in the draft this year and will be looking for their savior again next spring. GO DEEPER Can the Raiders get the QB they need in the 2025 NFL Draft? If not, where should they turn? The Raiders let Jacobs walk because that’s what you’re supposed to do with veteran running backs, but he has been sorely missed as both Zamir White and free-agent signing Alexander Mattison have underachieved. Rookie Dylan Laube fumbled on his only touch. Maybe it’s time to give 10-year vet Ameer Abdullah or practice-squad back Sincere McCormick a shot. Ameer Abdullah punches it in!#LVvsMIA | 📺 @paramountplus pic.twitter.com/9kU4Q8NC80 — Las Vegas Raiders (@Raiders) November 17, 2024  White was a fourth-round pick in 2022, and the Raiders have almost nothing of value from that class. Beyond White, Dylan Parham is a solid starter at guard, while fourth-round pick Neil Farrell Jr. is a backup defensive lineman for the Chiefs, Thayer Munford is a backup tackle and defensive tackle Matthew Butler is on the practice squad. Adams never got over the nightmares of Garoppolo missing him by 10 yards on throws and never really gave Minshew a shot. His dreams finally came true as he was reunited with Aaron Rodgers in New York, but some romances are apparently better when they’re long distance. The Jets are 1-4 with Adams. The Raiders are 1-6 without Adams, as there is a glaring lack of experienced, reliable receivers after Jakobi Meyers. Minshew has been unable to get the ball deep to second-year speedster Tre Tucker, who has only cracked 30 yards receiving once in the last six games. Tucker was a third-round pick last year, so that’s not great. DJ Turner and rookie Ramel Keyton round out the roster, and though Telesco signed former Charger Jalen Guyton back in May, the veteran never got off the practice squad before being released on Monday. The cupboard is pretty bare. Advertisement Brock Bowers is already the best tight end in the league not named George Kittle or Travis Kelce, and we may just be being respectful to his elders there. Imagine what the yards-after-catch specialist will do with an accurate, strong-armed quarterback. Brockin' and Rollin!#LVvsMIA | 📺 @paramountplus pic.twitter.com/tUq5NzKADV — Las Vegas Raiders (@Raiders) November 17, 2024  Michael Mayer was a second-round pick last year, but he just returned to the team last week after dealing with some personal issues. So, an incomplete grade for him, but this duo should be a strength for years to come. To be fair, Gruden and Mayock did hit on a couple of picks. But one of them, 2020 fourth-rounder John Simpson, didn’t click with Ziegler and McDaniels and became a good player elsewhere. Gruden and Mayock whiffed on 2021 first-rounder Alex Leatherwood, and the Raiders didn’t draft another offensive lineman early until this year. Telesco nabbed Jackson Powers-Johnson in the second round, and he has moved from guard — and may be playing injured center Andre James out of a job. The Raiders also took right tackle DJ Glaze in the third round, and he has shown some promise. There might be some hope for this unit.  Tyree Wilson had a sack against the Dolphins last week, but the fact that the team lost Malcolm Koonce to injury and still doesn’t start Wilson — the seventh overall pick in 2023 — speaks volumes. The speed and power he showed in college have yet to translate to this level as he has trouble getting off the ball and blocks. While some compare him to 2019 bust Clelin Ferrell, Wilson has a ways to go to reach that level. That 2023 draft class has only produced two full-time starters in Tucker and cornerback Jakorian Bennett, though Mayer could also count as the Raiders often go with two tight ends. Third-round pick Byron Young was cut after training camp this year — the defensive tackle never looked the part. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

Robert Spillane was a nice signing by Ziegler two years ago, a tough, young, downhill player who has worked hard to improve his pass-coverage skills and become a leader. His contract is up, but it’s hard to imagine the Raiders not making his re-signing a priority. Divine Deablo was a third-round pick in 2021, and he is a great athlete who is still a little inconsistent. Advertisement Pierce is high on rookie Tommy Eichenberg, but he is still pretty raw and his opportunity to be anything more than a special-teamer will have to wait until next year. Undrafted rookie Amari Gainer showed some nice coverage skills in the preseason — there might be something there. Gruden and Mayock whiffed on cornerback Damon Arnette in 2020 and fourth-round safety Tyree Gillespie in 2021, but Tre’von Moehrig has improved each year after being drafted in the second round in 2021. (As bad as the Leatherwood pick was, the Raiders did get four defensive starters in that draft: Moehrig, Koonce, Deablo and cornerback Nate Hobbs.) Give Ziegler credit for the fourth-round selection of Bennett last year. He has become a steady starter with a nose for pass breakups on third down. Both he and starter Jack Jones left Sunday’s game with injuries, so the Raiders are force-feeding fourth-round pick Decamerion Richardson. He needs to get stronger and was victimized last week by the dreaded communication bug, but he is quick and aggressive and will learn the hard way, which could be good in the long run. The Raiders lost veteran safety Marcus Epps to a knee injury, but third-year player Isaiah Pola-Mao has not been bad in his stead. Like Eichenberg, it seems unlikely draft picks Trey Taylor (safety) or MJ Devonshire (cornerback) will touch the field on defense this year.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Penguins Today: A different mood, plus an NHL coaching shakeup",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5934961/2024/11/20/penguins-today-mike-sullivan/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:00:23 GMT",Things were already bad for the Penguins. Now they're just different bad.,"NHL Happy Hump Day. It probably won’t be so happy for the Penguins when they gather for practice today. Not only did they again blow a 2-0 lead in their overtime loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning last night, but coach Mike Sullivan looked and sounded like a man who’s had enough. If a couple of decades covering this team have taught me anything, it’s never to place too much importance on what happens directly after a game. Whether comments or actions, coaches and players need a lot more time than they’re given to cool down after a rough night. There are occasions when the postgame scene is worth reporting on, and last night falls into that category. GO DEEPER What I'm hearing on the Penguins: More trades are coming The dressing room was opened to the media earlier than usual. When that happens, it’s never an accident. It happens to ensure some players are around to face the heat. But only three players — Crosby, Marcus Pettersson and Tristan Jarry — stuck around to take questions. Rickard Rakell re-entered the room only upon request from Penguins communications staffers. Advertisement In my two decades on the beat, the room opening early usually coincides with a game that reveals itself to be a fork-in-the-road moment for the team. Still, I thought maybe last night was just a bad day for the Penguins until Sullivan started talking. Three things stood out: 1. He didn’t take long to show up. Usually, Sullivan needs some time to gather himself before fielding questions in front of cameras. Sullivan walked in hurriedly, his face looking flush. His answers were direct. He was professional but also visibly agitated. He’s usually the coolest dude in the room. Last night was different. 2. He didn’t mince words. His answers left no room for interpretation. While calling for players to “compete harder” and “take pride in playing defense,” Sullivan raised his voice but did not yell. His tone and pitch rarely fluctuate when answering questions. Last night was different. 3. The entire session spanned about a minute and only three questions. Sullivan exited the room quickly, head bowed, without acknowledgment. Last night was different. What does any of this mean? I can’t say. But for as bad as things have been for the Penguins this season, last night was different. • A big-name coach has already been fired in a market where contending is the expectation, and a lot of people want to know if Sullivan will go the way of Jim Montgomery in Boston. How hot is Sullivan’s seat? I don’t get the sense Sullivan is in danger of being fired. I may be too close to the forest to see the trees, but the forest is under the stewardship of Fenway Sports Group — and its head honchos seem to view Sullivan like a long-living red oak. But I’m no arborist. • The Athletic’s latest NHL player poll has dropped. It’s anonymous, but many Penguins participated. I was a fan of the questions about rule changes and expansion. For any bosses reading, if the NHL goes to San Diego, consider this my application for that gig. Advertisement • Kris Letang skated again yesterday but missed his third consecutive game with an illness. He hasn’t had his finest season, but his absence is noticeable — and not in the same way as Ryan Graves, again a healthy scratch. The Penguins are worse when Letang doesn’t play and better when Graves doesn’t. It’s a night-and-day difference between what those two defensemen do for this team. • At some point, Kevin Hayes and Blake Lizotte will return from injuries, but I don’t know if that’s a good thing. In their absences, Sullivan has moved Drew O’Connor to center a third line with Jesse Puljujarvi and Sam Poulin as the wingers. That line has been a bright spot in the past few games. In the big picture, the Penguins would benefit more from keeping that line together than re-inserting a couple of veterans. • Crosby nearly scored his 600th goal a couple of times last night. It’s going to happen soon enough. It’ll be a relief to him when it does. Happy birthday to former Penguins winger Tom Roulston, born in 1957. He played parts of his final two seasons with the Penguins, scoring 11 goals and 28 points in 58 games from 1983-84 through 1985-86. He was a minus-32 in those games. Those early-to-mid-1980s teams were a special kind of deficient on defense. They also lost a lot. You might think you’re watching rock bottom with these Penguins. You’re not. It’s not even close.

Kosovo have also been fined €6,000. The Kosovo players walked off after “Serbia, Serbia, Serbia” chants could be heard from the home crowd. The Kosovan Football Federation (FFK) later alleged that “Kosovo is Serbia” chants could also be heard. The Romania Football Federation (RFF) denied that chant was heard.

The RFF has been fined an additional €30,000 for “transmitting provocative political messages not fit for a sports event”, as well as €38,000 for five other charges during the match. The FFK said that its players abandoned the match “due to the lack of safety and dignity” after “continuous racist and anti-Kosovo chants by the Romanian fans, who repeated racist and provocative behaviour…in complete violation of UEFA regulations and principles”. The FRF responded by saying: “We consider the accusations made by the Kosovo side to be unfounded and firmly believe that their actions were premeditated.” After the game, the FFK also alleged that a Romanian official “intervened in the press conference of the Kosovo national team, shooing away the journalists” and then “threatened and assaulted a Kosovo player in the corridors of the stadium”. The FRF “categorically” denies that this alleged incident occurred and alleges instead that “the Kosovo delegation initiated a confrontation with Romanian journalists”. The FFK did not respond when approached for comment on this allegation or that the team’s actions were premeditated. Romania’s next home fixture will be a World Cup 2026 qualification match in March.

Plus, what's up with the 76ers?",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5934701/2024/11/20/cavaliers-celtics-76ers-joel-embiid-tyrese-maxey-nba-the-bounce/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 14:39:42 GMT",Zach Harper catches you up on leaguewide news.,"NBA The Bounce Newsletter  | This is The Athletic’s daily NBA newsletter. Sign up here to receive The Bounce directly in your inbox. Maybe I should have known this, but in the NBA Cup group play, overtime doesn’t count for point differential. That makes absolutely zero sense to me, but I’m glad we all just found this out together. Did the Celtics burst the Cavaliers’ bubble? The headline matchup of the Emirates NBA Cup last night was always going to be the Cavaliers going on the road to face the Celtics. But with the Celtics as the defending champs and the Cavs bringing a 15-0 record into this game, the East Group C matchup had even more juice than we could have imagined. This was set to be an internet indictment on the Cavs if they lost, or move people toward believing in Cleveland as a true contender by extending its streak. Advertisement What happened was an incredibly impressive game from both sides as Boston (12-3) won 120-117. The Celtics gave the Cavs an early reminder of exactly who they’re trying to topple, Cleveland came back to make it a game and we had a tight finish between two teams who often play each other tough. Their last 11 regular-season matchups have been decided by a total of 22 points, dating back to November of 2021. Three of those 11 games have gone to overtime. I’m sure we’ve all got some questions about what to make of Cleveland’s streak being terminated by the defending champs. If you don’t mind, I’d like to talk to myself here by asking and answering those very questions. So … are the Cavs frauds after all? No. The Cavs showed a lot of positive things in making their comeback and had a chance to win this game in Boston. There’s a reason only one team in history has started at least 16-0. This is hard! Is the streak meaningless in the long run? Not at all. They have a cushion for the No. 1 seed in the East through 16 team games. They also have historic precedent on their side, with the other three teams to start 15-0 having made the finals.  But don’t the Cavs still have to contend with a Celtics team that will have Kristaps Porziņģis? They sure do! And that’s scary for every potential playoff opponent for the Celtics. The Cavs were also without Max Strus, Isaac Okoro and Caris LeVert. You need wing depth against Boston. What can Cleveland take away from this game? Three things. First, Evan Mobley is a monster. He played great basketball to help get the Cavs back into this game, helping cut a 21-point third quarter deficit to two. Secondly, the Cavs dominated the paint 60-36, and they can keep things close with that. Thirdly, you can’t get outscored by 36 points at the 3-point line. You have to take more threes. Advertisement Nets 116 (6-9), Hornets 115 (5-9): Charles Lee benched LaMelo Ball for the final 3:48, Cameron Johnson had 34 points and the Nets ran the offense through Trendon Watford to finish this game. And it worked. Nuggets 122 (8-5), Grizzlies 110 (8-7): Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. finally picked up the slack without Nikola Jokić (personal reasons), as they combined for 51 points, 15 rebounds and nine assists. Mavericks 132 (8-7), Pelicans 91 (4-11): Luka Dončić returned after missing a game to lead Dallas with 26-5-5 in 30 minutes. If Dallas didn’t score in the fourth quarter, Dallas still would’ve won by six. New Orleans badly needs some healthy bodies. Spurs 110 (7-8), Thunder 104 (11-4): No Victor Wembanyama, no problem. The Spurs beat the Thunder behind 22 points from Keldon Johnson off the bench to pull off the upset. Players not named Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (32 points on 11-of-20 shooting) and Jalen Williams (27 points on 13-of-26) combined for 45 points on 17-of-54 shooting from the field. Lakers 124 (10-4), Jazz 118 (3-11): What did you think was going to happen in this one? The Lakers cruised to an easy victory behind 37 points from rookie Dalton Knecht.

What’s next for Philly? ⤵️https://t.co/e9CcIF66kB pic.twitter.com/U9RZLMaxsy — The Athletic (@TheAthletic) November 19, 2024  How bad is Philly’s start? Well, let’s see … Things in Philadelphia are off to a slow start, to say the least. The 76ers revamped their entire roster this summer, bringing in Paul George and some good role players to help out Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey. It was supposed to make them contenders and get them past the second round of the playoffs for the first time since 2001. There’s still plenty of time to right the ship for the Sixers this season, and it will start with Maxey getting healthy, PG staying healthy and Embiid getting into game shape and his typical playing rhythm. Advertisement You can try all you want to justify a slow start, but 2-11 with the team not looking any better since Embiid came back (0-3 in those games) still doesn’t make sense. You can shower them with all the qualifiers and caveats you need to give them space to rebound. And that would be fair. However, they’re the only team we know to have a team meeting so far this season. That’s rarely a good thing this early on. We told you yesterday the Sixers weren’t available to the media after Monday night’s loss for about an hour. That’s because they had that team meeting. According to our old pal Shams Charania:  So, what does all of this mean? There are two ways to process this. First, the Sixers got all of this out in the open and needed to address some issues. It all sounds like it’s getting the team to accept what it needs to improve. Considering the 76ers are tied with the Wizards for the NBA’s worst record, what they need to improve is literally everything. With 69 games left in the regular season, they have time to right the ship immediately after this and start building toward what they were supposed to be. What’s the other way to take it? Even if it’s a positive message, stuff like this getting out isn’t supposed to happen. You often hear about players saying everything needs to stay in-house. Regardless of it being good or bad. This got out almost immediately the next morning. It could be the sign of a fractured locker room, even after an early Festivus-like airing of grievances within the team. What’s next? The next five games to close out November are at Memphis (tonight), Brooklyn, the Clippers and Rockets all at home. Then, they head to Detroit. Ja Morant should still be out – likewise for Kawhi Leonard. The Sixers should go at least 3-2 in this stretch. If they do, maybe things truly are on the mend. Will the proposed NHL-style format fix NBA’s? Prior to this past weekend, we received the report that the NBA might have figured out its All-Star Game format issue. After this year’s being so embarrassing that Adam Silver called out the players in real time and repeatedly talked about needing to make this game more competitive, the league decided to find a way to change things. While some have wondered if we’d get American-born players versus international players, the NBA has decided to adopt a style we see in the NHL … with its own twist, of course. The proposed format we may see in San Francisco in February consists of four teams in a tournament style. The league would divide the 24 All-Stars (12 from the West and magically 12 from the East) into three teams of eight. And they would compete in a short tournament of games. I know what you’re thinking: “But Zach, didn’t you say it would be four teams?” I did! And it would be! The NBA would get the fourth team from the winner of the Rising Stars Game on Friday night. Advertisement This is sort of similar to the NHL, which divides their All-Star pool into four teams, who then play in a bracket style. They play three-on-three games with 10-minutes halves. Winners of the first two games then play a third game for all of the hockey All-Star glory. The NBA would do something similar with their bracket. Shorter games. More games. And a prize pool to the winners. Also, the hope is that playing the Rising Stars would galvanize veterans into playing hard. Ultimately, this will likely come down to the prize pool motivating players to try more and try harder. It’s worth a shot because it can’t get worse than last year’s lackluster 211-186 game. 📫 Love The Bounce? Check out The Athletic’s other newsletters.

Watching in-person? Get tickets on StubHub Naismith Trophy watch-lister Mark Sears will look to improve on a shaky performance in the Purdue loss. He shot just 5-for-15 from the floor and had four turnovers. The Tide’s best player in that game was Labaron Philon, a freshman Alabama native who put up 18 points, five rebounds and four assists in 27 minutes off the bench. Alabama’s offense has typically relied on the 3-ball, but amid an early slump around the perimeter (30.4 percent shooting), it’s actually doing its primary damage in the paint. Fifth-year forward Grant Nelson has converted a wild 85.7 percent of his 2-pointers, and fellow senior big Clifford Omoruyi is at a 77.8 percent clip. Illini center Tomislav Ivišić will have his work cut out for him, but the team should be up for an interior challenge. Illinois comes into Wednesday leading the Big Ten in rebounding and third in blocks per game. Ivišić, a newcomer from Croatia, has started his collegiate career averaging 17.3 points and nine rebounds per contest. He forms a formidable young duo with freshman Will Riley (17.7 points per game, 69.2 percent on 3-pointers). Both programs will be eager for a win ahead of tough stretches. This is Illinois’ first legitimate test of the season, and it can fashion some momentum before facing three ranked opponents (Arkansas, Wisconsin and Tennessee) in the next few weeks. Alabama couldn’t quite hang in that first meaningful trial with Purdue, and a second consecutive loss would be disconcerting. The Tide’s next five games, starting with this one, are against ranked teams. Houston, Rutgers, North Carolina and Creighton are up next. This is not an official home game for Alabama — even though it’s at nearby Legacy Arena in Birmingham and is named the C.M. Newton Classic after the Tide’s longtime head coach. Newton won three SEC regular-season titles and was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006. He recruited the program’s first Black player, Wendell Hudson, in 1969. He also started five Black players for the first time in conference history. Illinois won the first head-to-head matchup in 1953. Alabama is 3-1 all-time and carries a three-game win streak.

But his corner 3s have been money.","NBA NEW YORK — Mikal Bridges perked his chin up a smidge, reversing the calendar in his head. The assignment: Name the last time he drew a foul at the basket. After a couple of seconds of thought, he took a gander through squinted eyes. “Miami?” he guessed. That game was at the end of October, weeks earlier. Bridges wasn’t correct, though his answer wasn’t far off base. Advertisement The Houston Rockets’ Dillon Brooks fouled Bridges on an alley-oop attempt that the New York Knicks wing banked in for an and-1 on Nov. 4, though he missed the free throw. That means Bridges has gone eight consecutive games without drawing a shooting foul in the paint. The beginning of Bridges’ time with the Knicks is littered with idiosyncrasies, a trend the rest of the team has reflected, too. Not all are bad and not all are good, but they all have a theme. They are strange — none more out of the ordinary than Bridges’ journey away from the free-throw line. When he goes to the basket, he fades away, which isn’t new but has become extreme in its regularity. He’s drawn only five shooting fouls all season, but two have been on jumpers. Only three have been in the paint — the one in Houston and two more from an October win over the Indiana Pacers. Such has been the experience of the Bridges-era Knicks, a team that traded five first-round picks, including four unprotected ones, for the former NBA All-Defensive wing this summer. The overall production is compiling — just not in ways anyone could have expected. The shot that’s preventing him from drawing fouls — the fallaway jumper he’ll take from anywhere inside of 15 feet — has been automatic enough that head coach Tom Thibodeau says he has no issue with Bridges leaning that way. “(It’s a good shot) if you’re efficient with the shot,” Thibodeau said. “And he’s always been efficient with that shot.” Bridges is draining 54 percent of his attempts from floater range and a whopping 72 percent from the midrange. Yet, he’s drawn shooting fouls on only 2.5 percent of his field-goal attempts, nearly four times lower than his previous career low, according to Cleaning the Glass. Bridges is becoming a caricature of himself — and the Knicks are following him to the land of extremes. Advertisement As expected, the Knicks are scoring plentifully, recently dropping 134 points in a blowout victory over the Washington Wizards that bumped them up to 8-6 on the season. They are third in the NBA in points per possession, but they haven’t gotten there in cookie-cutter fashion. The Knicks rarely get to the line, ranking only 28th in free-throw attempt rate heading into Tuesday’s action, usually not a trait of a Thibodeau-led squad. They don’t take many 3s, though Thibodeau would like to change that. The Knicks are just 17th in 3-point attempt rate, but that number has risen since the early parts of the season when they weren’t infiltrating the deep paint enough to create long balls and were passing up too many of the ones that presented themselves. The new-look Knicks are still an unknown. Precious Achiuwa still has not played, nor has Mitchell Robinson, though Achiuwa’s return will occur before Robinson’s — and there is still skepticism about how much Robinson will be able to contribute once he’s healthy. He did not look like his usual self after returning from ankle surgery last season. He’s out with another surgery on the same ankle now. Without him and Achiuwa, rebounding was supposed to be an issue. So far, it hasn’t been. Karl-Anthony Towns was supposed to take time to ease into his new job, considering both the Knicks and Minnesota Timberwolves executed a shapeshifting trade that didn’t even finalize until the middle of training camp. All Towns has done is churn out the best season of his career thus far. Especially if Towns showed up dominating, the starting lineup was supposed to eviscerate opponents. So far, it has not. The Knicks are still figuring themselves out, as is Bridges. His shooting form on midrange jumpers is different than his release on catch-and-shoot 3s. His routine during pregame warmups is even more exaggerated, showing off a form more in line with the twitchy catapult that went viral during the preseason. Advertisement He’s shooting 47 percent on corner 3s compared to just 17 percent on ones from above the break. He’ll curl up before even touching a screener while manning the Brooklyn Nets’ Cam Thomas and then will swat Dennis Schröder to save the same game. He’s avoiding contact plays on both sides of the court. He’s a 28-year-old wing with defensive accolades, someone who was supposed to recover the verve he sported with the Phoenix Suns once arriving in Manhattan, where the Knicks would not hand him the offensive burden he carried in Brooklyn. And yet, New York’s defense is nearly 20 points per 100 possessions worse when he’s in the game, according to Cleaning the Glass. The Knicks could use the defensive help, the expected companion to OG Anunoby and Josh Hart who was supposed to give them the NBA’s most fearsome combination on the wings. They are just 21st in points allowed per possession. They could use some more top-of-the-key 3-pointers. They could use a few more free throws, though maybe those won’t come from Bridges. After all, the fadeaways are working well, and it’s difficult to critique a performance from the short midrange that has led to so much swishing. When Bridges was in Phoenix, playing alongside Devin Booker and Chris Paul, the Suns turned into the league’s midrange darlings. Bridges took lessons from that. “I just think when you watch the playoffs, a lot of guys get to the midrange,” he said. The Suns made it to the NBA Finals one year and lost in the second round of the playoffs the next before trading Bridges to Brooklyn for Kevin Durant, who might be the greatest midrange destructor ever. Now, instead of pushing to the rim, Bridges pulls up. When he gets to the paint, he makes contact with a shoulder, then falls back instead of going up into his defender, a move that could get him a layup and also earn him more fouls. Advertisement That’s no mistake, even if it is hitting the extreme. “You pay guys like Rudy (Gobert) to protect the rim. You pay big guys to protect the rim,” Bridges said. “It’s not easy to go in there and just give them chances to show why they make that much money averaging five blocks a game. So just reading the game. There’s a court made and it’s not just for the rim and the 3s. You got the rest of the court, too.” (Photo: Luke Hales / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The Shrine Bowl — an annual charitable event and college football all-star game featuring NFL hopefuls — takes place at AT&T Stadium on Jan. 30. It offers pro teams a chance to scout prospects ahead of the NFL Draft in April. Advertisement Sanders, the 22-year-old son of Deion Sanders, is among the notable names projected to be selected in the first round of the 2025 draft. He’s ranked third among quarterbacks, at No. 23 overall, behind Miami’s Cam Ward and Alabama’s Jalen Milroe in The Athletic’s Dane Brugler’s NFL draft Big Board. Sanders has passed for 3,222 yards with 27 touchdowns against seven interceptions, posting a career-high completion percentage (72.9 percent), during his 2024 campaign. The senior has also rushed for 77 yards and four TDs this season as the Buffaloes have gone 8-2 (6-1 in the Big 12).

He’s a Dallas-Fort Worth native, and Shrine practices will be held at the Dallas Cowboys’ headquarters at The Star in Frisco, Texas, just down the road from where Sanders grew up. The Colorado star would be wise to take advantage of every opportunity during the draft process to make his case for QB1 status and as a first-round prospect. Maybe even more important than what happens on the field, the Shrine Bowl will be an important week for Sanders as he interviews with NFL teams to answer any questions and sell himself. For those unfamiliar with the process, the East-West Shrine Bowl game is an all-star event for college prospects, but the real value for NFL evaluators is the week of practice leading up to the game (Jan. 25-28). I’m told the Shrine Bowl has several interesting modifications planned to enhance the week of practice for the quarterbacks in attendance. More details should be revealed soon. — Dane Brugler, NFL draft writer (Photo: John E. Moore III / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"How BYU, Colorado can clinch Big 12 title game berths, plus potential chaos scenarios",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5934824/2024/11/20/big-12-title-game-byu-colorado-arizona-state-standings/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 14:07:37 GMT",The Big 12 championship race is simple — and one false step away from complete pandemonium.,"NCAAF With two weekends remaining in the college football regular season, the Big 12 championship race is simple — and one false step away from complete pandemonium. BYU and Colorado, tied atop the conference standings at 6-1 in league play, both control their own destiny. The path to the Big 12 title game isn’t necessarily easy, but it is straightforward. Advertisement However, seven other programs — meaning nine of the league’s 16 total schools — are still mathematically alive to reach the championship game entering this weekend, should BYU and/or Colorado slip in the coming weeks. Officially, the Big 12 conference office is commenting only on the two scenarios in which teams can clinch a spot in the championship game this Saturday: • BYU can secure a berth with a win over Arizona State and a Utah win over Iowa State • Colorado can secure a berth with a win over Kansas, as well as wins by BYU and Utah Smart move by the Big 12. In this mega-conference landscape, tiebreaker scenarios are so confusing that it took the Big Ten until late Tuesday afternoon to realize Oregon had already locked up a spot in its league title game. In the meantime, here’s a not-too-in-the-weeds assessment of how the Big 12 championship race could unfold, including pathways for the top four teams in the standings, potential chaos outcomes and possible impact on the College Football Playoff field. Remaining games: at Arizona State, vs. Houston Even after last week’s loss to Kansas, all BYU has to do is win its final two games, starting with a high-stakes matchup against the Sun Devils. There are scenarios where BYU can lose to Arizona State (or win that game and lose to Houston the following week) and still reach the championship, but the Cougars would no longer have authority over their fate. Remaining games: at Kansas, vs. Oklahoma State The Buffs are in a similar situation to BYU: If Colorado wins out, it’s in, and it can also nail down a spot in the title game this weekend with a win and some good fortune. But if the Jayhawks play spoiler again, Colorado will need to beat Oklahoma State on Black Friday and get the right combination of losses among BYU, Arizona State and Iowa State. Advertisement A loss by either of the top two schools would really muck things up, which is exactly what the rest of these teams are hoping for. Remaining games: vs. BYU, at Arizona The Sun Devils almost control their own destiny, thanks to the upset of Kansas State last Saturday and upcoming showdown with the Cougars in Tempe. But there is one possible scenario where Arizona State wins its final two games and doesn’t make the championship: If Colorado and Iowa State also win out, and BYU loses out — meaning it loses to ASU this Saturday and to Houston in the finale — there’s a tiebreaker scenario in which Iowa State would jump Arizona State for the second-place spot against Colorado. The Sun Devils will have to knock off BYU, then might have to root for it to bounce back against Houston, while still having to deal with its own rivalry game against Arizona. If ASU loses to BYU, there could still be a very narrow path to the championship, but it would require a finale win against Arizona and an utter collapse by everyone else in the top half of the standings. Remaining games: at Utah, vs. Kansas State Iowa State needs to win out — there isn’t a scenario where it can lose one of the last two and still sneak in. And even if the Cyclones do win out, they will still need one loss each by BYU, Colorado and Arizona State, or for BYU and Colorado to both lose out. Kansas State (7-3, 4-3 Big 12) remaining games: vs. Cincinnati, at Iowa State Baylor (6-4, 4-3 Big 12) remaining games: at Houston, vs. Kansas TCU (6-4, 4-3 Big 12) remaining games: vs. Arizona, at Cincinnati Texas Tech (6-4, 4-3 Big 12) remaining games: at Oklahoma State, vs. West Virginia West Virginia (5-5, 4-3 Big 12) remaining games: vs. UCF, at Texas Tech Advertisement Every team that enters this weekend with three conference losses is still alive — but just barely. Each will need to win out, and since West Virginia plays Texas Tech in the final week, one of those two is guaranteed to get eliminated. Kansas State would have to defeat Iowa State in Farmageddon. The Chaos Group also needs either BYU or Colorado to lose out, and for Arizona State and Iowa State to both lose at least once. Any scenario that ends with a pair of two-loss teams above them would obviously be disqualifying. There’s a good chance this group gets thinned out Saturday, despite none of them facing each other. But in the spirit of Big 12 Chaos, there are a couple of scenarios that can end with an eight-way tie for first place at 6-3 in league play. Arguably the wildest would deliver a Big 12 championship between 8-4 Baylor and 8-4 Texas Tech. That, or West Virginia maneuvering its way to the title game at 7-5 overall. So yes, I’m telling you there’s a chance. We’ll see if it survives the weekend. BYU tumbled from No. 6 all the way to No. 14 in the latest CFP rankings, behind No. 12 Boise State and No. 13 SMU. Because Boise State is ranked ahead of BYU, the top-ranked Big 12 team, the Broncos are projected into the No. 4 seed and first-round bye, with BYU projected to the No. 12 seed as the fifth-highest ranked conference champion. Elsewhere in the rankings, Colorado moved up to No. 16, Arizona State entered at No. 21 and Iowa State re-entered at No. 22. Boise State’s only loss came on a last-second field goal to top-ranked Oregon. Slotting BYU behind SMU is harder to understand, considering both teams have one loss and SMU’s loss came to BYU. Ranking based on head-to-head matchups is not always cut and dried for the selection committee, but this one is. For now, it also doesn’t matter. Miami, ranked No. 8, is projected as the ACC champion and into the No. 3 seed in the 12-team bracket, earning a first-round bye. If BYU — or Colorado, or Arizona State or Iowa State — runs the table to win the Big 12 title, it’s plausible that team would jump ahead of a one-loss Boise State that wins the Mountain West title to give the Big 12 one of those first-round byes. It’s similarly plausible that a one-loss Boise stays in front of the Big 12 champ; the Broncos could potentially even leap a two-loss ACC champion. Regardless, if one of those four Big 12 teams wins out to get the league crown, they will make the 12-team CFP. Advertisement Where things would get interesting is if the conference ends up with a three-loss (or four-loss … or five-loss!) league champ. Then the possibility of Army or Tulane winning the AAC and stealing that fifth and final automatic Playoff bid enters the equation, which could lock the Big 12 out of the 12-team field entirely. It’s unlikely. But it’s not impossible.  (Photo of Colorado coach Deion Sanders: Dustin Bradford / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Charlotte football coaching job profile: Pluses, minuses and candidates to replace Biff Poggi",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5934059/2024/11/20/charlotte-football-coaching-search-candidates/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 14:01:57 GMT","The potential has always been there for the 49ers, in a prime and growing area with a basic program foundation.","NCAAF The Charlotte job is open. The school fired Biff Poggi before the end of his second season, following a 59-24 loss to USF. Poggi went 6-16 during his short run, typically making headlines for his sleeveless cutoff shirts and blunt comments about himself or his staff, but getting fewer than two years at a Group of 5 job does not happen often. There always seems to be potential at Charlotte, and it recently moved from Conference USA to the American Athletic Conference, but there has been little success. So how good is the Charlotte job? What names could get in the mix? Based on conversations with industry sources, here is a report card for the job and the potential candidates to watch.  There’s not much of either here. The program essentially only began playing in 2013, and it has just one winning season, a 7-6 record in 2019 under Will Healy. The 49ers are in the midst of their third consecutive three-win season. That said, the team does get good crowds in the small Jerry Richardson Stadium, with many games close to a sellout. Charlotte sits 66th in 247Sports’ Team Talent rankings, thanks to 12 former four-star prospects. But those transfers haven’t panned out. Charlotte is 13th in the AAC in scoring offense and 12th in scoring defense. While most of the skill position contributors have remaining eligibility, no one has stood out this season, and the starting defense is full of seniors. The next coach may need to dig into the portal to find new contributors, but Poggi leaned on that heavily without good results — around half the roster is made up of transfers. Former Florida quarterback Max Brown has not done much of anything this season, and many of those transfers played high school ball at Saint Frances Academy, where Poggi once coached. Advertisement Poggi’s $1 million salary was closer to the bottom of the AAC and may not be enough to pull in Power 4 coordinators. Don’t forget the school was set to hire Mike Houston in late 2018 before East Carolina came in late with more to offer, so Charlotte turned to Healy. The downturn in Healy’s tenure came after he lost multiple key assistant coaches. The program has been behind its peers in important infrastructure areas like staffing and amenities, especially since moving from Conference USA to the AAC last year. The spending is increasing in the AAC — it has to — but Charlotte is still behind much of the conference.  The program does have a very nice on-campus stadium, and there is a football center attached to it but no indoor practice facility. The move to the AAC was an important one for the 49ers, and the school two years ago put forth an athletics master plan for the next 12-15 years that included stadium expansion and an indoor facility, but it still has catching up to do. Athletic director Mike Hill has been there since 2018, making this his third football coaching hire, and he received another four-year extension in September, so it appears he’s not going anywhere. GO DEEPER Charlotte fires coach Biff Poggi after less than 2 seasons Former NFL offensive coordinator Pep Hamilton was in the mix the last time this job opened. Hamilton is a Charlotte native who last coached college football in 2018 with Jim Harbaugh. When Hamilton was Stanford’s offensive coordinator from 2011 to 2012, the Cardinal went 23-4. Ole Miss co-offensive coordinator Joe Cox is a Charlotte native who spent 2021 on Healy’s staff before getting hired by Nick Saban at Alabama. The 37-year-old has coached at Colorado State and South Carolina. He knows the city and the program. Western Carolina head coach Kerwin Bell has turned the Catamounts into a winning program since inheriting a one-win team, with a 23-15 record since midway through his first season. He previously took Valdosta State in Georgia to an undefeated Division II national championship in 2018 and went 66-35 at Jacksonville before that. Bell has some Florida connections with Hill. Advertisement Former UAB head coach Bill Clark retired in summer 2022 due to back issues, but industry sources believe he’s ready to get back in. Clark went 49-26 at UAB with two conference championships, most of that success coming after the program was rebuilt from nothing after being shut down following his first season. Former Florida State offensive coordinator Alex Atkins was the offensive coordinator on Charlotte’s only bowl team in 2019 before being hired away by Mike Norvell at Florida State. While this season has been a disaster for the Seminoles, Atkins was considered a rising star in the profession, dramatically improving the FSU offensive line and playing a key role in last year’s 13-0 regular season. But Atkins received a two-year show-cause penalty by the NCAA last year for some recruiting violations. That could be a hurdle. NC State defensive coordinator Tony Gibson has been close to a few Power 4 head coaching jobs in the past. He has been at NC State since 2019 and had almost 15 years of experience at West Virginia. Gibson has been a Broyles Award nominee multiple times in recent years, though the Wolfpack have struggled this season. East Tennessee State head coach Tre Lamb got the Buccaneers ranked in the FCS top 25 in his first season after inheriting a three-win team. The 35-year-old took over a Gardner-Webb program coming off six consecutive losing seasons and won consecutive conference championships in 2022 and ’23. Georgia Tech co-offensive coordinator Chris Weinke played for the Carolina Panthers for six seasons and recruits the Charlotte area. The former Heisman Trophy winner has helped Georgia Tech reach bowl eligibility for the second consecutive season and has developed quarterback Haynes King into a better player. He previously coached at Tennessee, Alabama and IMG Academy. Advertisement South Carolina defensive coordinator Clayton White is a North Carolina native who led a top-20 defense in the country this season; the Gamecocks sit third nationally in sacks. The NC State alumnus also coached there from 2013 to 2016 and knows the state well. The potential has always been here, in a prime and growing area with a basic program foundation. But moments of success have been few and far between, and the school still needs to catch up in certain financial areas. (Photo: Daniel Kucin Jr. / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Cornerback DaRon Bland (foot), rookie DE Marshawn Kneeland (knee), WR Brandin Cooks (knee) and OT Chuma Edoga (toe) all have a chance of playing Sunday. • Don’t look for an offensive play-caller change. Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy was asked Tuesday about the possibility of switching things up and having offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer call the offense. “Haven’t considered that,” McCarthy responded. “Don’t think like that.” GO DEEPER At 3-7, Cowboys faced with being 'realistic' and coming to terms that 2024 season is over • Cooper Rush will remain the team’s starting quarterback. “Cooper Rush will be the starter, and we’re putting together a game plan to go win,” McCarthy said. “We got a package for (backup QB) Trey (Lance), and we’ll see what happens.” • Cowboys special teams coach John Fassel said their failed fake punt Monday night was a player decision to activate the fake because of the look the Texans were giving. “That’s on me,” Fassel said. “They were doing what they are (coached) to do.” The play gained four yards but they needed nine for a first down. Safety Juanyeh Thomas, who caught the pass from punter Bryan Anger, took responsibility for the call Tuesday on social media.

Two, do you really think Jones wants a head coach that could pull the spotlight away from him whenever he wants? Sanders is one of a very few people who can draw that type of attention. A Sanders and Jones combination would be fascinating to cover, but it doesn’t seem realistic, at least not in the near future.

But I’m not going to speculate on any jobs or anything like that because I don’t think that’s right. I know that he’s told me many times that he’s very happy at Colorado. He likes it there.

If the new terms are fulfilled, it would take the Spaniard to over a decade in charge. Advertisement But City are in turbulence and Guardiola is suffering the worst run of his managerial career. His team usually have a slow autumn before the juggernaut revs up again in the new year, but it’s never been this bad. Oh, and there’s the issue of the 115 alleged breaches of financial rules  — City have always denied any wrongdoing — that continue to loom over the club. Change is also afoot. Director of football Txiki Begiristain is leaving in the summer, and while City already have his replacement in the bag — Hugo Viana is coming in from Portugal’s Sporting CP — Guardiola leaving at the same time would have left a huge vacuum at the top; their noisy neighbours in the red half of Manchester can attest to that (see the departures of Sir Alex Ferguson and David Gill in 2013 — from which they’ve arguably still not recovered). The Guardiola deal, which will be announced soon, means a pivot to international football seems unlikely. There were links to England and Brazil, but they now seem dead in the water. Any hopes of seeing the 53-year-old in a dugout during the 2026 World Cup have been banished… for now.  While one big-name manager is set to stay, another has decided to quit. Tata Martino has left Inter Miami, 10 days after their shock MLS Cup exit to Atlanta United. After a record-breaking regular season, a Supporters’ Shield title and securing a place at the Club World Cup, they fell at the first hurdle of the play-offs and now the 62-year-old Argentinian is gone. Martino cited personal reasons, but the team’s lofty ambitions will not have helped; Miami would have expected to go deep in the MLS Cup with Lionel Messi and Co. The full reasons behind the resignation will surely come to light when Miami’s top brass address the media on Friday. But now it’s a question of who is next — and how will this affect Messi? Co-owners David Beckham and Jorge Mas, and president of football operations Raul Sanllehi, once of Arsenal and Barcelona fame, will be leading the hunt for a new person to lead the team, and maybe Messi will have an influence here, too. Advertisement Two names which keep popping up are his former Barca team-mates, Xavi Hernandez and Javier Mascherano. If either get the role, they will likely have Messi, 37, for just a single season so must get a tune out of him from the technical area, just as they did alongside him on the pitch in their playing days. Jesse Marsch has a style and he sticks to it. While it hasn’t worked everywhere, Canada are going from strength to strength under his guidance. A 3-0 win (4-0 on aggregate) over Suriname sees them into the CONCACAF Nations League semi-finals to face Mexico in March 2025. Jacob Shaffelburg scored twice, aided by a less-than-robust challenge from Suriname goalkeeper Etienne Vaessen (above). But what’s the camp like off the pitch? The Athletic’s Joshua Kloke was granted access all areas for their trip to Suriname in the first leg. He saw their plane thrown off course by a drone, after-dinner initiations and Marsch’s Top Gun quotes (the original, obviously). It’s all underpinned by positivity, attention to detail and a strong work ethic. Who knows what they can do with a World Cup on home soil in 18 months? 🤔 Confused by what all these UEFA Nations League results mean? We’ve explained it all here. My colleague Jacob Tanswell has documented his journey and that of his ex-team-mates after they navigated the youth system at Bournemouth. Jacob was released at 16 and it’s a powerful piece on the difficulties players face when they don’t make the grade — and answers a lot of questions… How hard is it to go pro in the UK? Data suggests that, of the 1.5million boys who play organised youth football in England, only 0.01 per cent will make a single appearance in the Premier League. The odds are not in your favour. Advertisement What happens to those released? Football can spit you out as quickly as it swallows you, and there are big question marks over the aftercare that clubs provide for released players — and if it is good enough. Some players dust themselves off and go again. Many drop out of the game entirely and look for jobs elsewhere. There is a plumber, a Royal Marine and, of course, a journalist among the former Bournemouth youth players shown above (Jacob is fourth from the left in the back row). What effect does it have on youngsters? I was interested to read from Jacob’s ex-team-mates that for some there was an overriding sense of relief when not offered professional deals — they were freed from the pressures put on their shoulders, even as kids. The psychological effects are huge. The loss of identity; the feeling that they have let people down. The death of former Manchester City youngster Jeremy Wisten, who took his own life shortly after his release, made football stand up and take notice. It needs to do more to support children — because that’s what they are — when their dreams are shattered.  It’s startling, when you take a step back, to see the changing face of Premier League owners over the last three decades. In 1992, boardrooms were mainly British, with clubs run by ‘local men done good’. But meat magnates and haulage heroes have been replaced by oligarchs, hedge funds and oil money. Here’s a fact: “From 1993 to 2018, when the UK economy more than doubled, the total value of Premier League clubs grew 30 times larger.” And business people overseas have been able to keep pace with what Matt Slater calls ‘football’s voodoo economics’.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Twenty crucial Edmonton Oilers questions after an uneven 20 games,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5933635/2024/11/20/edmonton-oilers-mcdavid-draisaitl-power-play-defence/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 13:49:56 GMT",To say the Oilers have underachieved 20 games into the season would be an understatement. How did they get here and what's next?,"NHL The Edmonton Oilers inched to the quarter mark of the season with a 5-2 win over the Ottawa Senators that featured many positives. Their offence got going with five goals, ignited by a new line of Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl and Vasily Podkolzin. The superstars had three points and Podkolzin chipped in with two assists. Evan Bouchard matched Nos. 97 and 29 with three points of his own. Stuart Skinner had one of his best performances of the season and made 27 saves. Advertisement The only concern is an injury to Zach Hyman that kept him out for the third period. It was a much-needed victory, the only win of their three-game road trip, and pushed them to 10 wins over their first 20 games — not exactly impressive but certainly better than the alternative. The Oilers are 15th in the NHL with a .550 points percentage, a far cry from where they were expected to be by now. To say they’ve underachieved would be an understatement. How did they get here and what’s next? Let’s examine 20 questions from a topsy-turvy first 20 games. *Note: These are listed sequentially and not necessarily ranked in terms of importance. The more things change for the Oilers, the more they stay the same. It’s an age-old problem that has resurfaced again. Draisaitl has been Edmonton’s best player without question. He has 14 goals, second in the league behind Alex Ovechkin. He carried the Oilers to two wins in three games when McDavid was sidelined. McDavid hasn’t quite been at his usual level but still has 24 points in 17 games — including 14 points in seven games since returning from the ankle injury. They’ve scored 23 of the 42 goals from Oilers forwards. Many facets need to improve but none are as obvious and surprising as the Oilers’ collective inability to put the puck in the net. They’ve scored 55 goals in 20 games even with a five-goal outburst on Tuesday, a 2.75 average that would have been unthinkable coming into the season. Coach Kris Knoblauch said their offensive production was something he never envisioned would be problematic. It’s time to start identifying some areas that need to be addressed and see if they can be fixed. There might not be another Oiler who’s struggled more regarding expectations than Ryan Nugent-Hopkins. Advertisement Nugent-Hopkins has two goals and nine points in 20 games. He is tied for 12th in team scoring at five-on-five with four points alongside mostly third-liner Adam Henrique and Viktor Arvidsson, who’s missed four games. The players behind them are Corey Perry, Derek Ryan, Drake Caggiula, Noah Philp, Ty Emberson, Travis Dermott, Troy Stecher and Josh Brown. Rare exceptions aside, he hasn’t seemed to fit anywhere — on McDavid’s wing, centring the second line or a brief cameo in the bottom six. The offensive woes are one thing, but Nugent-Hopkins’ usually sterling defensive play has been below its standard, too, whether at five-on-five or on the penalty kill. There have been several goals against this season where he’s been out of position. The Oilers need more from him. Knoblauch mentioned a few times last season that Draisaitl could benefit from more established wingers. Jeff Skinner was one guy brought in to fill that supposed void. Signing him to a one-year, $3 million contract with a no-movement clause simply hasn’t worked out so far. Skinner has three goals, two of which came in the first five games of the season. He’s clearly found a place in his coach’s doghouse. Before Tuesday, he hadn’t played more than 12:19 in any of the previous five games, and the Oilers used 11 forwards three times in that span. He got to 15:16 in Ottawa partly because of Hyman’s injury. The fourth line has been Skinner’s most common spot of late due to a lack of pace, physicality and defensive play. There will need to be a sizable shift in his play and how he’s viewed — and soon — or it’s clear this will be Skinner’s only season in Edmonton. Arvidsson joined Skinner as a July 1 signee to play on Draisaitl’s wing. He’s done enough to gain more trust from the coaching staff, but that’s what’s arguably made him more of a disappointment. Advertisement Arvidsson has five points in 16 games despite getting most of his five-on-five ice time with Draisaitl. Three of those points came in one game, too, when he had a trio of assists against Pittsburgh on Oct. 25. The 31-year-old winger has had injury issues throughout his career and has been out of the lineup since last Tuesday. The Oilers can’t afford for him to miss much time because they lack suitable replacements within the organization. They can’t afford to have him produce so little, either. Hyman’s 9.14 expected individual goals at all strengths is tops on the Oilers and puts him fourth in the NHL, per Natural Stat Trick. He led the league in that category at 50.44 last season when he netted 54 goals. But Hyman has only three goals this season. It seems Hyman has two or three excellent opportunities every game but misses the net or is stopped by a goaltender. Logically, his luck will turn eventually when he returns to the lineup. But when? Hyman said the frustrating part for him is his lack of finishing has cost his team wins. We’ll find out in two weeks if it’s also cost him a spot on Team Canada for the 4 Nations Face-Off after he seemed like a lock a few weeks ago. Bouchard and Brett Kulak are tied for third and fourth on the Oilers with five and four goals, respectively. That’s expected of Bouchard and a pleasant surprise for Kulak, which is not exactly a good thing. No forward other than Draisaitl or McDavid has netted more than three goals. Podkolzin still hasn’t scored. The third line has been more noticeable lately with Connor Brown getting two goals in Vancouver on Nov. 9 and Henrique opening the scoring in Toronto last Saturday. Still, those two players, along with winger Mattias Janmark, have combined for only six goals. Advertisement It’s tough to win consistently with this type of offensive push. The power play had been so good for the Oilers for so long. They’ve had the most proficient team in the league over the previous six campaigns. That hasn’t been the case this season. The Oilers have scored nine times with the man advantage and never more than once in a game. That 17.3 percent success rate is well below their typical norms. And 52 opportunities in 20 games, a 2.6 average, surely doesn’t help. Still, the feeling around the team is its ineffectiveness has lost them games. The coaching staff has already toyed with personnel changes. Perry was tasked with taking Hyman’s spot in the third period in Ottawa, but that was out of necessity. It might be time to put one or two of those changes into practice by choice. Up front, putting Skinner in for Nugent-Hopkins could spark inspiration. Taking Bouchard off the power play might be the wake-up call he needs. Offence breeds confidence for Bouchard, so perhaps Tuesday’s banner night will spark him. He’s scored five times this season — including a beautiful rush goal in Ottawa — but the team’s power-play woes have contributed to his recording just 13 points. That’s a scoring rate below what he’s known for. Production is one thing, but the defensive side should be more stable. Bouchard had a terrible turnover that led to the tying goal in the third period in Toronto. He was also partially to blame for the go-ahead goal that night. A week and a half earlier, he was called out by former longtime NHL coach Bruce Boudreau on TSN for two lackadaisical plays that led to goals in a loss to Vegas. Bouchard will always be known more for his offence than his defence. He’s elite at the former. But he’s made tremendous strides in the latter department in recent years even if he’s still prone to lapses. He’s got to cut down the errors he’s made lately, though, because those are more pronounced with the Oilers not scoring enough. Advertisement Knoblauch is among the most measured coaches in the league when speaking to the media. He’ll seldom call out his players and rarely criticize them. That’s starting to change. Last week, he expressed his frustration with the New York Islanders’ second goal, stating it was “played poorly” by the Oilers. He called a breakaway goal scored by the Nashville Predators late in the third period “unacceptable.” All this after he benched Draisaitl for a few minutes in the third period during a game last month. It sure seems like he’s starting to flex his muscles a bit more. The Oilers haven’t been able to lock in their forward pairings. Janmark and Brown and Henrique and Nugent-Hopkins were back together in Montreal after some time apart. With Darnell Nurse out, even the defensive duos were switched. Dermott and call-up Josh Brown got PK time together against the Canadiens. All this change — not to mention losing four regulars from last season — has affected the short-handed work. The Oilers have killed off 68.6 percent of opponents’ power plays. The real issue is between the pipes, though. TSN’s Travis Yost noted the Oilers were the NHL’s best PK in expected goals against per 60 minutes last week but ranked last in actual goals per 60. Per Natural Stat Trick, Stuart Skinner has allowed 3.05 more goals than expected on the PK, whereas Calvin Pickard has surrendered 4.39 more goals than he should have there. The short answer is a fair bit. Skinner and Pickard have had a few solid performances between them, but the numbers don’t lie. Skinner has an .881 save percentage and has allowed 6.6 more goals than expected in all situations per Natural Stat Trick. Pickard hasn’t been much better at .893 and 1.26 in the red. Advertisement Really, the Oilers are looking for timely saves more than anything else. The inconsistencies in net have made the Oilers seem worse defensively than they really are. Again, the biggest problem is on the penalty kill, but it’s trickled into five-on-five play. The Oilers have allowed 2.34 goals against per 60 minutes in that situation, good for 14th in the NHL. Not bad but room for improvement. They’re seventh in expected goals against per 60 at 2.3, per Natural Stat Trick. They’re a 55.8 Corsi For Percentage team, second in the league. Their 55.7 high-danger Corsi For Percentage also ranks second. The organizational viewpoint is that their offence has been more troublesome than their defending. Even disregarding the goal scoring, Kulak’s work on the blue line has been so valuable to the Oilers — especially while he was chipping on his weak side alongside Nurse on the second pair. He’s been tasked with the most responsibility of his career and has performed admirably in the form of a 58 expected goals percentage at five-on-five, per Natural Stat Trick. The Oilers might need to be cognizant of his workload. Kulak has played more than 20 minutes in 10 of the last 13 games, including a season-high 23:05 on Tuesday. It’s worth noting he was one of the culprits of that “unacceptable” breakaway goal against Nashville last week. There doesn’t appear to be much rush based on the way things are going. The Oilers might not have a name-brand blue line behind Bouchard, Nurse and Mattias Ekholm, but management is comfortable enough with the group’s work at large to patiently stay the course. Don’t mistake that for indifference or contentment. It’s all but a certainty the Oilers will acquire at least one defenceman by the trade deadline. Though a righty blueliner is preferred, handedness is not expected to be a hangup for improving the group. Advertisement But finding the right player is paramount, rather than being too proactive. Waived and demoted at the end of the preseason after signing a three-year contract on July 1, Brown has been doing his best to get back in the organization’s good graces. He was part of an effective penalty kill with the AHL’s Bakersfield Condors and showed off his toughness by getting into four fights. Recalled Sunday after Nurse’s injury, Brown has done much of the same with the Oilers — including getting into a scrap on Tuesday. The understanding here is he’ll have to make an even greater impact to remain on the roster after Nurse is ready to return. Until a trade is made, the Oilers will likely stick with the same defence deployment once Nurse returns. The Ekholm-Bouchard tandem should remain intact. Nurse and Kulak will get time together and work with other partners: Emberson for Kulak and a combination of Stecher and Dermott for Nurse, depending on which player is in the lineup. It’s clear the coaches feel they need to shelter the two players slotted on the right side behind Bouchard. Emberson’s raw numbers aren’t pretty. He has just one assist in 18 games. The Oilers have been outscored 13-6 in his 231 minutes at five-on-five, per Natural Stat Trick. But there are signs Emberson — 24 years old with just 48 NHL games on his resume — is coming around, especially in a suitable environment. According to Puck IQ, Emberson has a 59.6 Corsi For Percentage against middle-type competition and a 52.30 CF% against lower-end opponents. The Oilers could have a worthwhile contributor if Emberson grows into his depth role and keeps working at penalty killing, something he’s getting more minutes in of late. Advertisement It’s unlikely in the near term because of the injury situation and because he plays centre, but this is something to monitor. Why? Ryan had been a fixture on the penalty kill since joining the team in the 2021 offseason, but his role there has decreased over the last few weeks. Ryan is now seventh among Oilers forwards in short-handed ice time this season. He’s behind Arvidsson, who’s played two fewer games. Simply put, Ryan’s value to the organization diminishes if he’s not a regular and effective penalty killer. It remains to be seen if Kasperi Kapanen — claimed off waivers Tuesday — is the right fit, but the Oilers had to shake things up a bit. They couldn’t continue to have 11 healthy forwards (before Hyman’s injury) at their disposal. They needed an infusion of speed after the departures of Ryan McLeod, Dylan Holloway and Warren Foegele in the summer. Kapanen will likely get some middle-six looks once he’s acclimated with the Oilers. It’ll be up to him where he goes from there. Something is bound to give once Nurse, Arvidsson and Hyman get healthy. The Oilers are now carrying 23 players on the active roster. General manager Stan Bowman has kept things lean, with 21 players whenever possible. A defenceman is almost certainly going down to Bakersfield — likely Josh Brown — but will a forward be headed there, too?

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Dalton Knecht’s 37-point eruption carries the Lakers to their sixth straight win,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5934427/2024/11/20/dalton-knecht-lakers-jazz/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 13:40:13 GMT",The sharpshooting rookie made nine of his 12 3s as the Lakers remained unbeaten in NBA Cup action.,"NBA LOS ANGELES — As the Los Angeles Lakers bench and the Crypto.com Arena crowd stood in anticipation, everyone in the building knew where the ball was going. Dalton Knecht had made three straight 3-pointers. The crowd was buzzing. His teammates were bouncing and waving their arms. Knecht was going to take the next shot. It was just a matter of how the rookie was going to get open. Advertisement After a failed screen attempt to get Knecht the ball, Utah Jazz rookie Cody Williams inexplicably helped off of him. Knecht caught a pass from D’Angelo Russell and considered rising but didn’t like the look. He dribbled backward to gain momentum, dribbled forward and launched his fourth 3-point attempt in less than two minutes. As the ball caromed in, and the arena erupted to the loudest volume it’s been this season, Knecht turned toward the sideline as he ran backward and shrugged, mimicking Michael Jordan’s celebration from the 1992 NBA Finals. KNECHT HITS THE MJ SHRUG AFTER HIS 7TH TRIPLE 🔥🤷‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/CK7IOCyQVf — NBA TV (@NBATV) November 20, 2024 
“Rui (Hachimura) was talking to me about I need to get a 3-point celebration,” Knecht said. “I didn’t know what to do. So I just gave ‘The Shrug.'” It was that kind of night for the 23-year-old rookie in the Lakers’ 124-118 win over the Jazz on Tuesday. With the victory, the Lakers improved to 10-4 this season and 2-0 in NBA Cup group play (and 9-0 all-time in the tournament). Los Angeles has won six straight games. Knecht set new career highs with 37 points and nine 3-pointers made. He finished 12-of-16 from the field (9-of-12 from 3) in a season-high 38 minutes. He did a lot of his damage in the third quarter, exploding for 21 points (6-of-6 3-point shooting), including 18 in the final 3:29. His 21 points are the most in a quarter by a rookie this season and the fourth-most by any player. His nine 3-pointers tied the NBA rookie record for most 3s in a game and set the new Lakers rookie record. Only three other Lakers players have made at least nine 3s, including Kobe Bryant (four times), LeBron James (twice) and Russell (once). “I just got in a groove,” Knecht said. “My teammates found me. And they were looking for me every time we got on offense. And then (coach) JJ (Redick) was calling plays for me. So they made it real easy for me. I just had to get open and get the shot up.” Advertisement Knecht has been heating up for a week, beginning with last Wednesday’s win over the Memphis Grizzlies when he scored 19 points. He has set his new career-high point totals in three of the past four games (19 points, 27 and now 37), cementing his status as the team’s best shooter and establishing himself as a critical part of the offense. “We just urge him to shoot the basketball,” Lakers forward Anthony Davis said. “He can do more than just shoot. But he’s really good at shooting the basketball. We get mad at him when he don’t shoot.” Over the past four games, Knecht is averaging 24.3 points (tied for second on the team with James) while shooting 67.3 percent overall and 67.7 percent on 3-pointers. He’s making 5.3 3s per game, a figure that would lead the league. The Lakers have outscored opponents by 37 points in his 133 minutes, a team-best mark. The Lakers have been looking for this type of deadeye movement shooter around James and Davis for years — and appear to have finally found him. Redick joked that every time he’s in a timeout, his instinct is to draw up an after-timeout play for Knecht. Redick has compared Knecht to a goldfish in that he never remembers the result of his last shot. Knecht expressed a similar sentiment when asked about when he knew Tuesday was going to be a special night for him. “The first shot,” Knecht said. “Every time I see one go in, I think the next one is always going in. Even if I miss it, I always have the confidence that my next shot is going in.” James, who praised Knecht last season after a Lakers win in Washington, doubled down on his assertion that the No. 17 pick is a special shooter and scorer. “I did not think he was going to fall to us,” James said. “I thought it would be impossible. I have no idea how that happened. But I’m very grateful and I’m very happy that he’s here. I knew exactly what we were getting when he fell to 17.” Advertisement James added that he thinks Knecht slipping to the Lakers is more of a reflection of how badly the other 16 teams messed up than anything. “They didn’t ‘find’ DK,” James said of the Lakers’ scouting department. “The other 16 teams f—ed it up. Did anybody watch him? S—. They just didn’t f— it up. You don’t ‘find’ a SEC Player of the Year.” This level of production from Knecht is unlikely to last once Hachimura, who is out with an ankle injury, returns. Knecht has benefited from starting in Hachimura’s place the past three games, as well as from an easier stretch of schedule. His shooting numbers aren’t sustainable. Defenses will surely scout him harder and make adjustments. At the same time, it’s difficult to discern how much of this is flukey. Knecht — a first-team All-American last season at Tennessee — was billed as one of the best shooters and scorers in the 2024 NBA Draft, and he’s lived up to his reputation. There aren’t many players in the league who could’ve made the shots he was making in that manner. He’s made the most of the recent opportunity and has earned more minutes and shots moving forward, Redick said. “It’s really just having his spacing, his threat,” Redick said. “He’s got some off-the-bounce stuff that you can do, but I mentioned before the game, he’s an excellent cutter. He’s been great with his offensive rebound crashing. So it’s more about him just earning more minutes and more trust, not just with the coaches, but with his teammates. That’s important.” Regardless of whether he continues to start or moves back to the bench once Hachimura returns, Knecht has shown over the past week that he’s a special kind of shooter who can heat up at any moment and swing a quarter, a half or even a game. Given all of the interior attention James and Davis command, that type of complementary skill set is invaluable. “I know he’s capable of doing that,” Austin Reaves said. “And honestly, I expect him to do it multiple more times this year.” (Photo: Harry How / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Should the Giants trade Camilo Doval? The pros and cons,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5932476/2024/11/20/sf-giants-camilo-doval-trade-possibilities/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 13:00:35 GMT",Doval has the kind of skill-set teams with pennant aspirations covet. Are the Giants one of those teams? Or should they look to deal him?,"MLB The best relievers tend to have identical methods of getting batters out: They throw a fastball between 80 and 105 mph, and they throw with either their left or right hand or occasionally both. They have a breaking ball or an offspeed pitch, or several of each. They’re often between the ages of 21 and 49, and they’ll typically have between eight and 12 fingers. Sometimes they’re expensive because they’ve been successful for years and years. Sometimes they’re cheap because they’re young. Other times, they’re cheap because they didn’t learn how to get major-league batters out until they were in their 30s. Advertisement If you want to find a great high-leverage reliever, find someone who fits that description. It’s just that easy. However, if you want to narrow the description of a good reliever, look for the guys who throw 102 with movement and also have a wipeout slider. Seems like cheating, but it’s actually a widely accepted practice. The Giants have one of these. They also might be looking to trade him. Camilo Doval is a rare talent with the potential to be a high-leverage reliever on any team, which means he’d be popular in trade talks. It also means there must be a reason why the Giants would consider trading him. The pros and cons for each path: He wasn’t very good last season, which seems like the best place to start. He was below replacement level according to Baseball-Reference, and he was right at replacement level according to FanGraphs. He walked 39 of the 271 batters he faced, which is about 100 fewer walks than you remember, but he had a penchant for saving his walks for the worst possible time — nobody out and a two-run lead, for example. When the tying run was on deck, batters hit .314/.415/.457 against Doval. He threw 81 pitches with nobody out and the tying run on deck in 2024; and he threw 48 of them out of the strike zone. Maddening. Absolutely maddening. This might not be a blip, either. Remember that when the Giants called Doval up in 2021, he had a 7.0 BB/9 in Triple A and a minor-league career filled with inflated walk rates, but it didn’t immediately translate to the majors. My pet theory is that minor leaguers were more apt to say, “What in the heck do you expect me to do with this?” when they saw 102 with a wipeout slider, and taking pitches was more self-preservation than strategy. Major leaguers were more confident, and they also might have assumed that a major-league reliever was likelier to throw strikes. My other pet theory is that Doval loves to throw his slider when he’s behind in the count. From Baseball Savant:  If a batter is ahead in the count, 2-0, and he’s looking for a slider, he’ll know better than to attack the ones that start on the outside part of the plate. Doval is trying to paint corners in those situations, but he paints with the precision of a preschooler, and 1-0 counts become 2-0 counts, and 2-0 counts become 3-0 counts and so on. Advertisement Either way, there’s a book on Doval, and it’s been passed around: Make him throw strikes. He struggled to adjust, which is why the Giants sent him to Sacramento last summer with a Criterion Collection box set of Emmanuel Clasé’s best outings. Do what he does, then listen to the Martin Scorsese audio track that explains why throwing unhittable stuff for strikes is a good idea. Seems simple enough, except throwing more strikes isn’t always simple, especially for a pitcher who needs to max out his velocity and arm speed. There might be a glass ceiling to Doval’s effectiveness, and his stuff is likelier to decline with age than improve. However, Doval is in a very, very exclusive club of relievers who can throw a pitch to a batter who’s looking for it and still get a swing and a miss. The teams who aren’t satisfied with just a division title or postseason appearance — the teams like the Yankees, Orioles, Braves, Phillies and Dodgers — would very much like to stack their bullpen with pitchers in that club. Doval isn’t coveted by teams looking to win more regular-season games, but the ones that will be disappointed if they don’t at least win a pennant. Those are the teams that might want to refurbish Doval, and it’s not wacky to think that a fresh set of eyes and spreadsheets could make him more effective. And if they’re willing to supply the Giants with prospects, the Giants will have to consider it. Doval is also scheduled to make around $5 million this year, and he’s likely to get even bigger raises in the two seasons after that. If he’s not a candidate for a long-term contract — and relievers almost never are — now’s the time to chat with the teams in the middle of a frantic, slightly panicked win-now mentality. Don’t be a goober and pretend that the Giants have absolutely zero shot at the postseason next year. It might not be likely, but there’s still a better chance than a lot of teams. Remember that the Tigers made the postseason last year after being sellers at the deadline and trading a veteran to the Giants. It won’t take a turnaround that extreme for the Giants to be playing in October. And if they get there, they’ll need all of the rare, high-leverage arms they can get. Advertisement That’s not the likeliest scenario, but it’s realistic enough to where the Giants wouldn’t want to just give Doval away. Their asking price should be roughly the same as it was last offseason. Which is to say, they should pretend that 2024 didn’t happen, and they’ll need trade partners to do the same. It was a gap year, don’t worry about it. If trade partners are looking at acquiring Doval at reclamation-pitcher prices, forget about it. He’ll have more potential value to the Giants. And while the Giants’ bullpen looks on the deeper side from here, with the emergence of Sean Hjelle, Randy Rodríguez and Erik Miller giving them depth and a fairly high ceiling, bullpens are fickle. Fickle and malevolent. Can’t trust ’em. The best way to have a lockdown bullpen is to multiple baskets, with multiple eggs in each. Bullpens are fickle, but they also aren’t completely random. It wouldn’t be even a minor surprise to see Doval return to being an important part of a balanced bullpen. It would be one of the easiest squares to fill on the Giants’ contending bingo card, and they can afford $5 million to see if Doval is a high-leverage option again, especially with the safety net of the trade deadline. Teams usually get even goofier for relievers at the deadline. The real answer was to trade him to Baltimore for Colton Cowser before the 2023 season. Look at how mad you awful people were in the comments here. My delicate sensibilities have never recovered, but I was right. (Ignore that the section with a header of “Flame-throwing relievers are volatile” includes a table that’s topped by a mercurial pitcher who throws in the low- to mid-90s now and may or may not be in the Giants’ rotation. I have no idea what to make of that, either.) Don’t trust relievers. Don’t overrate them. Also, don’t underrate them, and get as many trustworthy ones as you can. It’s complicated. If the market is hot for Doval, though, the Giants have a chance to build for the future at the expense of a present that’s not likely to be that exciting. It would be the kind of trade they’d have to consider. (Photo: Thearon W. Henderson / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,What went wrong for Jim Montgomery and the Bruins?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5934033/2024/11/20/bruins-jim-montgomery-what-went-wrong/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 13:00:08 GMT","Bad signings, underperforming stars and a darkening tone: how one of the NHL's great success stories went so far south so fast.","NHL On June 24, 2024, Don Sweeney diminished Jim Montgomery’s greatest position of strength. The Boston Bruins general manager and coach both knew it was coming. Linus Ullmark had to be traded. For two seasons, Ullmark and Jeremy Swayman made Montgomery’s job easy by cleaning up their teammates’ mistakes. But their time was up. The Bruins needed to replenish their organizational futures. They also had to apply the former Vezina Trophy winner’s $5 million average annual value elsewhere. Advertisement What Montgomery didn’t see coming, however, was the fallout of trading Ullmark for Joonas Korpisalo, Mark Kastelic and a 2024 first-round pick. Seven days later, Sweeney used some of Ullmark’s dough to sign Elias Lindholm and Nikita Zadorov. So far, they have flopped to a degree the brain trust also didn’t anticipate. And another thing Montgomery didn’t foresee: three months after Lindholm and Zadorov put pen to paper, Swayman had yet to do the same. By Oct. 6, the day Swayman agreed to his eight-year, $66 million contract, the Bruins had concluded training camp. As soon as Swayman signed his deal at Warrior Ice Arena, he hustled to Hanscom Field airport for the team’s flight to South Florida for the season opener two days later. Game 1 did not go well. Lindholm has one five-on-five goal. Zadorov has an NHL-leading 13 minor penalties. Swayman has an .884 save percentage. And Montgomery is out. All of these things, among others, are connected.  David Pastrnak was a champion. On May 26, Pastrnak and his Czech teammates beat Switzerland 2-0 in the final of the 2024 World Championships. There was a problem. Sometime during the tournament, the Bruins’ No. 1 right wing suffered an undisclosed injury. It was serious enough to park Pastrnak for several weeks during the offseason. He could not fulfill his usual training program. He was not alone. During the 2023-24 NHL playoffs, Brad Marchand played through a torn tendon in his elbow. It had to be fixed. Marchand also underwent groin and hernia procedures during the summer. It wasn’t until mid-August that the 36-year-old resumed training. By the time Montgomery settled into his office at the Bruins’ practice facility to prepare for training camp, he knew his No. 1 right wing and captain would not be 100 percent upon arrival. Pastrnak and Marchand were not at their usual conditioning levels. They had to play their way into NHL shape. Advertisement Their interrupted summer workouts showed in their play. In the first eight games, because he was regularly chasing the play, Pastrnak took seven minor penalties. On Oct. 24 against the Dallas Stars, he took hooking and tripping penalties. The Stars scored on both power plays. Pastrnak took the blame for being undisciplined. Marchand, meanwhile, went without a goal in the first eight games. His first five-on-five goal took place in Game 16. It is his only one. Concurrently, Pastrnak and Marchand have shared time on the No. 1 power-play unit. The Bruins are at a worst-in-show 11.7 percent. On Monday, after the Bruins’ 5-1 loss to the Blue Jackets, Marchand acknowledged how much better the Bruins have to be on the power play. Montgomery and assistant coach Chris Kelly, who is in charge of the power play, started the year emphasizing low plays and sharp-angle shots. Their players did not respond. Too often, the power play was stationary and predictable, looking for Pastrnak’s left-elbow one-timer. In 2023-24, Pastrnak led the Bruins with 110 points. Marchand was No. 2 with 67. This season, Pastrnak is on pace for 70 points. Marchand should score 54. They are currently 1-2 in team scoring. Lindholm is third. He has nine points. He is on track for 37. On Sunday, two days before his dismissal, Montgomery described Lindholm as a complementary center. “Does great work in the D-zone,” Montgomery said. “He’s in the right place in the neutral zone. Offensively, you see him more at the net-front or in the hashmarks than you do possessing pucks.” Montgomery was discussing Lindholm’s style of play. He may have been correct in another way. Through 20 muted games, Lindholm has been a complementary center in terms of being, under ideal circumstances, a third-line pivot. Advertisement The trouble is Sweeney paid him to be a No. 1. Perhaps Lindholm will get back to that level. But he’s declined since his high-water mark of 82 points in 2021-22 while centering Johnny Gaudreau and Matthew Tkachuk. So far, there have been no signs of a course correction. This left Montgomery in a jam. Lindholm, projected to be Pastrnak’s setup man, was oil to the right wing’s water. Montgomery had no choice but to move Pavel Zacha, expected to be the No. 1 left wing, back to the middle. Zadorov, meanwhile, started camp with Charlie McAvoy. It did not take long for Montgomery to identify it as a problematic pairing. Zadorov is known as a defensive defenseman. But he likes to go. Not always at the right time. The unpredictability affected McAvoy’s game. The No. 1 defenseman knew exactly what Matt Grzelcyk, his former partner, would do and when. This season, McAvoy has had to spend precious seconds processing how Zadorov would play a situation. Montgomery determined both defensemen were better off with Zadorov on the No. 3 pairing with Andrew Peeke. This left McAvoy to play with Mason Lohrei and Jordan Oesterle. Neither has optimized McAvoy to be a difference-maker, which is what Montgomery desperately needed McAvoy to be. That’s because Montgomery’s security blanket was shredded. In his first two seasons, Montgomery did not lose any regular-season sleep because of his goaltending. He knew it would be different in 2024-25. But he never dreamed signing Swayman would be so troublesome. This was Sweeney’s department. After president Cam Neely and agent Lewis Gross had it out, Sweeney eventually got the deal done, even if it was considered an overpay. But the coach had to pick up the pieces of Swayman’s missed camp. Korpisalo took the loss in the season opener. Swayman has yet to look like a No. 1 goalie. On Monday, in what would be his final postgame press conference, Montgomery said he didn’t think it helped any player to miss an entire camp. Advertisement It was telling that Swayman, following Montgomery’s remarks, acknowledged how he lost out on the company of his teammates in camp. Swayman, in all likelihood, is feeling the pressure of letting his teammates down by not approaching his peak. With his No. 1 unable to take goals off the scoreboard, Montgomery had to lean harder on his skaters. He benched Pastrnak. He had it out with Marchand. Montgomery scratched Morgan Geekie five times. He endorsed Matt Poitras’ AHL assignment. He scratched Johnny Beecher once. He took Lohrei out of the lineup four times. Sweeney hired Montgomery partly because of how supportive he was of his players, especially after Bruce Cassidy often took a firmer approach. For two seasons, Montgomery was sunflowers and rainbows in the room. He had no reason to be otherwise. But when things went sideways early, he became Dark Monty. It didn’t work. If Joe Sacco gets the team back on the rails, it will confirm what Sweeney has believed: the roster is sound. If Sacco cannot turn night into day, it will expose Sweeney’s teambuilding approach as compromised. It could be, for example, that Sweeney has built his team around three third-line centers in Lindholm, Coyle and Zacha. He could not secure Swayman to a more team-friendly number. He did not sign or acquire a replacement for Jake DeBrusk, partly because he thought Fabian Lysell was ready for varsity work. Lysell, the No. 21 pick in 2021, has one goal in 12 AHL games. There is no help coming. The Bruins are feeling the pain of trading away four of their last seven first-round picks. Beecher, their 2019 first-rounder, looks like an NHL fourth-liner. One director of amateur scouting, granted anonymity to discuss players outside his organization, brought up Zach Hamill (No. 8 pick in 2007, 20 NHL games) as a possible Poitras comparable. Dean Letourneau, their 2024 first-rounder, has two assists in eight games as a Boston College freshman. Advertisement All of this confirms one thing: This is now on McAvoy, Pastrnak and Swayman, the team’s three foundational players, to reach their levels. It is also on Coyle, Geekie, Marchand, Zacha, Brandon Carlo and Trent Frederic to get in line or risk being traded. Sweeney, in that regard, may have to make roster moves on top of replacing the coach. The Bruins are no longer Montgomery’s problem. (Top photo: Matthew J.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Is Jamal Murray back? Nuggets star shines vs. Memphis, opens up on recent struggles",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5934460/2024/11/20/jamal-murray-denver-nuggets-interview/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 12:24:58 GMT","Murray hadn't looked like himself for months, including during the Olympics. But his aggressiveness on Tuesday night was a welcome sign.","NBA MEMPHIS, Tenn. — On Tuesday night, we saw the old Jamal Murray. We saw the Murray who has spent so long in the NBA as a lethal offensive player. We saw the Murray who could take over a game with his ability to make shots and create for himself and his teammates. The Denver Nuggets defeated the Memphis Grizzlies 122-110 without superstar Nikola Jokić. But they got the Jamal Murray who was such an important cog in the 2023 NBA title machine, not the one who has struggled and sputtered through most of this season. The Nuggets got 27 points and six assists. They received five 3-point makes, and an aggressive Murray who set a certain tone from wire to wire. Advertisement This hasn’t been an easy six months for Murray. He had a difficult Olympics with Team Canada. He had a slow recovery from a calf strain. He’s faced criticism and scrutiny concerning his play to start this season. His play hasn’t been good enough, and he knows it. He spoke on this and other issues in an interview with The Athletic. “I take full accountability,” Murray said. “It’s not easy when you aren’t playing well. It hasn’t been easy with guys like Nikola and Aaron (Gordon) out. We were fully capable of winning these last games. But, for me, I have to play better. I have to take account for that. It starts with me.” It isn’t about the last few games for Murray, two of three which have been losses. It’s about the big picture. The Denver Nuggets will not win a championship in 2025 if Murray isn’t the same player he was in 2023. Tuesday night gave a glimpse into the guy he was. But for too many nights this season, Murray has been a fraction of that. He hasn’t been as proficient or explosive. He hasn’t gotten the same separation off the dribble, causing his shots to be more contested than normal. But more importantly, he hasn’t been as aggressive. Peak Murray looks to cook offensively, no matter who is in front of him defensively, and no matter who is on his team. It’s what makes his partnership with Jokić work as well as it has over the years. Murray never deferred to Jokić, and because of that, their two-man game was more like having two No. 1 options, instead of having a No. 1 and a No. 2. Murray carries himself with a swagger and a quiet confidence that often yielded an offensive killer, especially during Denver’s 2023 title run. Who will ever forget him outplaying LeBron James and Anthony Davis in the Western Conference finals? Who will forget him scoring at will against Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and the Phoenix Suns? If the Nuggets are to get back to that level again, Murray has to get back to that level. Advertisement “I think it’s less about shot making and more about me being aggressive,” Murray told The Athletic. “The last few nights, it’s been a different game, not having Nikola there. But the thing is that I have to take it upon myself to be better, and not put the blame on anyone else. I have to have a different mentality on the nights he doesn’t play. It’s not going to be the same shots, or the same game. It’s all mental for me. We all have to have a different mentality when Nikola isn’t playing.” The season is young. But if Murray continues on this trajectory, it would be far and away the worst season he’s played since his rookie year, almost across the board. He’s averaging 18.3 points per game, which would be his lowest average since the 2018-19 season. He’s shooting 41 percent from the field, which would be his lowest since his rookie season, 2016-17. He’s shooing 33.4 percent from 3-point range, which would be the lowest of his career. For comparison’s sake, Murray has averaged more than 20 points per game in each of the last three seasons. So, he’s not only dropped, it’s a significant drop. He’s normally one of the better volume 3-point shooters in the league, and he’s eclipsed 40 percent twice in his career. Without Jokić, Murray becomes the primary player for defenses to try and take out of a game. We saw that on Sunday night in Memphis, as the Grizzlies consistently sent extra attention at the star guard. What Murray did wrong that night was settle too much for jumpers and post-ups against Scotty Pippen Jr. On Tuesday night, Murray was a lot more aggressive from above the arc, and a lot more aggressive at getting into the paint off the dribble. It opened up his entire game. “Our job is to support Jamal and to help him by making shots around him,” Denver forward Peyton Watson said. “But we want him to be who he is, and it’s our job to provide that kind of support around him.” Jamal getting it going 🏹 27 PTS / 3 REB / 5 AST / 2 BLK / 3 STL pic.twitter.com/DZlPCKdW0V — Denver Nuggets (@nuggets) November 20, 2024  Murray told The Athletic that he is completely healthy and free of the calf strain that he suffered in the playoffs, the injury that limited his performance in the second round against the Minnesota Timberwolves. That same injury limited him in the Olympics. He knew he wasn’t completely healthy going into the summer. But he also knew that Team Canada had a star-studded roster, and he wanted to be a part of it. Advertisement There was a lot of talk about how Murray looked, when he wasn’t the impact player that people thought he would be. And it’s true that Murray didn’t look very good. But Murray, who has been previously hesitant to talk about the subject, knew on some levels that his Olympic performance wasn’t going to look like the regular Murray. “I was definitely hurt going into the Olympics,” Murray said. “I was good enough to play. Obviously, I didn’t play great. I knew I wasn’t going to be great, but I wanted to be there. I wanted to play for my country. I wanted to be with my teammates. So I don’t look at it as the same mandate as everyone else. The Olympics was what it was. It’s important what I’m doing for the Nuggets, the team that’s paying me this money, the team that wants me here. I have to look at what I can do for this team.” His performance on Tuesday has to be a starting point for him and the Nuggets as a whole. Denver is in a good spot in the Western Conference. But even when Jokić is available, an argument can be made that the Nuggets rely on him too much. If Denver can consistently get the Murray that showed up on Tuesday, that puts the Nuggets closer to where they want to be. If nothing else, Tuesday night serves as a message to Murray himself that he can get it done at a high level. And that is a welcome sign to him, and the Nuggets. “I’m still me,” Murray said.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,James Conner and the punishing style and leadership that fuel the Cardinals,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5933197/2024/11/20/james-conner-arizona-cardinals-leadership/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 12:19:03 GMT","Kyler Murray is playing well. The defense continues to improve, but James Conner has always buzzed as Arizona's primary power source.","NFL TEMPE, Ariz. — After a recent practice, James Conner sat in the Cardinals practice facility and watched a replay of a defining moment from Arizona’s season. On Oct. 27, the Cardinals took possession with five minutes left in the fourth quarter. They needed at least a field goal to beat the Miami Dolphins at Hard Rock Stadium. Advertisement Until then, Conner had had a rough day. Determined to stop the run, the Dolphins had held him to 24 yards on 13 carries. After four pass plays and a short Conner run, the Cardinals lined up on first down from midfield. Conner took a handoff and burst through the line, breaking arm tackles. After 8 yards, four Miami defenders grabbed hold of the Arizona running back. He kept going. Five more yards. Still not down. Teammates rushed over and pushed the pile. During a recent conversation with The Athletic, Conner smiled. “I’m really thinking, ‘Don’t go down,” he said of a rush that stretched 17 yards and led to a winning field goal.

 Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox. Entering Sunday’s game at Seattle, the Cardinals (6-4) have won four in a row to take sole possession of first place in the NFC West. Quarterback Kyler Murray might be playing his best football. A beat-up defense continues to improve. But Conner has always buzzed as Arizona’s primary power source. No offensive player better symbolizes the physical identity coach Jonathan Gannon has tried to instill. “When he makes plays like that, it kind of takes energy away from the defense,” left tackle Paris Johnson Jr., said. “He’s getting the dirty yards. It takes the air out of the defense and that puts life into us.” “It fires everybody up to go the extra mile,” tight end Tip Reiman said. Growing up, Conner’s brothers always gave him simple instructions. Don’t ever let anybody trip you up. Don’t let one man bring you down. Make defenders earn it. Conner this season has played in such an aggressive manner. Per Pro Football Reference, he leads NFL running backs with 18 broken tackles. In addition, Conner has produced first downs on 29.6 percent of his carries, which trumps Baltimore’s Derrick Henry (26.4), Philadelphia’s Saquon Barkley (23.4) and Green Bay’s Josh Jacobs (22.2). Advertisement In the Cardinals facility, Conner watched as he held the ball tight in his right arm and stiff-armed a Miami defensive lineman with his left. As the Dolphins closed in, the eighth-year running back ducked his head, secured the ball with both arms and moved the pile, not giving in until his legs gave out. “Physical, man,” Conner said. “That’s what got me here.” Rachid Ibrahim monitored the Miami game from his office at the University of Richmond, where he coaches running backs for the Spiders. His takeaway that afternoon: James just doesn’t wear down. He’s physically strong. He’s in great shape. And he’s getting better. Ibrahim and Conner go way back. They were in the 2013 recruiting class at the University of Pittsburgh, running backs who played as true freshmen. They roomed together on road trips and later shared a two-bedroom apartment. Years later, both can recite the address without a second’s thought: 3213 Ward Street. Most of Conner’s college career has been well-documented. How he committed to Pitt as a defensive end but shifted to running back before training camp. How as a sophomore he rushed for 1,765 yards and 26 touchdowns, earning All-America recognition and ACC Player of the Year honors. How he was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma not much later. On July 25, 2016, Conner wrote an essay about his recovery for The Players’ Tribune. (First line: The first time you pee after receiving chemotherapy treatment for Hodgkin’s lymphoma, it’s red.) Conner later wrote a book entitled: “Fear is a Choice: Tackling Life’s Challenges with Dignity, Faith and Determination.” To this day, the mark Conner made in college has not faded. Former teammates and coaches marvel at his determination and spirit. Fans still wear Conner’s No. 24 jersey to home games. Perhaps most impressive: Pitt executive associate athletic director E.J. Borghetti named his youngest son after Conner. “He’s one of the toughest, if not the toughest, people I know,” former Pitt offensive lineman Alex Officer said. His workouts were legendary. Former Pitt strength coach Ross Kolodziej, who played for the Cardinals for parts of three seasons, said Conner had an uncommon approach. From the first day, Conner wanted to know: What are we doing? How are we doing it? What’s this going to do for me? His consistency never wavered. His confidence was contagious. This applied to personal workouts as well, in and outside the Pitt facility. Advertisement In their apartment on Ward Street, Conner and Ibrahim had a pullup bar secured to a door frame, as well as a few 45-pound dumbbells and resistance bands. Nearly every night before bed, they’d do a quick circuit. Curls, 4 sets of 20. Pull-ups. One hundred pushups. “James loved working out,” Ibrahim said. “That was his thing. That was his getaway. Some people hate running. Some people hate conditioning. He loved working out. That would never be punishment for him.” “It was a little hole-in-the-wall apartment, but all the guys would always be coming over,” Conner said. “We just had our vision there of better days and where we wanted to go. That was definitely, like, our starting point.” Conner added one more workout. On Fridays, after Pitt had its final walk-through prep session, he led a small group into the Pitt weight room. There, while coaches had meetings upstairs, the group would blare rap music and work for an hour. “It was all accessory work,” former Pitt long snapper Pat Quirin said. “We never went in there and were like, ‘Let’s load up the squat bar; let’s dead lift.’ No. It was shoulders, biceps, triceps, maybe some grip work for forearms. But we were getting after it.” “We all had kind of the same thought process behind it,” former Pitt linebacker Matt Galambos said. “You want to look good on Saturday in the jerseys.” For Conner, the tradition never died. “I still do that to this day,” he said. “That’s mandatory. You got to look good in uniform. That’s all that’s for. A little Muscle Beach.” Stevan Ridley played eight seasons as an NFL running back. He had a similar bruising style as Conner. He tells people: When you wake up after a game Monday morning, you feel like you just went through a 24-hour cycle in the washing machine. The weekly schedule then unfolds like this: Monday and Tuesdays are recovery days. Wednesdays and Thursdays are the hardest days of practice. By Friday, a running back starts to feel like himself. Saturday, the excitement starts to build. Sunday, he’s gutting it out, trying to be the best he can be. Advertisement “Our bodies start going from 100 percent as soon as the whistle blows in (training) camp, and then you’re just holding on to try and make it through the back end of those (17) weeks,” Ridley said. “It’s brutal, man.” In 2017, the Pittsburgh Steelers selected Conner in the third round of the NFL Draft. For his first two years as a pro, he teamed with Ridley, whose career was winding down. One thing that impressed Ridley: the time Conner spent taking care of his body. “I saw a young man in his first contract handling his business like the veteran that he is now,” Ridley said. “He was doing acupuncture. He was going to these soaks where he’d sit in water and they’d pump oxygen into it, something I had never seen. He was so on top of his body.” GO DEEPER How the Cardinals shed their slow start and jumped to the top of the NFC West After rushing for 122 yards in a Sept. 15 home win over the Los Angeles Rams this season, Conner drove to the Cardinals’ Dignity Health Training Center to get a headstart on treatment. (“It’s funny you say that because I think I called him that Sunday night and he was in the cold tub,” said Ibrahim, his former college roommate. “I said, ‘You’re at the facility?'”) The day after Arizona beat San Francisco on Oct. 6, Gannon told reporters Conner already was there, the first player in the building so he could get an early start on leg maintenance. These are habits Conner picked up during his time with the Steelers. He said he’d pull up to the facility early in the morning thinking he’d be the first to arrive only to discover vets James Harrison, David DeCastro, Maurkice Pouncey and Cameron Heyward already there, soaking in a tub or riding an exercise bike. Conner knew that if he wanted to last, he needed to start doing what they did. “When he was a rook, man, he was trying to figure it out, for sure,” former Steelers fullback Roosevelt Nix said of Conner’s recovery work. Advertisement Today, Conner sets the example. The night before Arizona played the Los Angeles Chargers, with the team sitting at 2-4, he delivered a speech about maximizing opportunity. “Not a lot of volume, but the substance behind it, and what he’s preaching,” Murray said at the time, “when you get up there and you pour your heart out, guys feel it.” Rookie running back Trey Benson said Conner is the best mentor he’s had in football. He’s shown him how to be a pro. How to be decisive with the ball. How to eat right. How to recover. How to attack the weight room. “When I work out with him, I be sore. Not the next day, I’ll be sore the next hour,” Benson said. “He pushes me to a level I didn’t think I had.” After watching the replay of his run against the Dolphins, Conner was asked when he realized all this was possible, getting to the NFL, playing at a high level. He said after he won ACC Player of the Year in 2014, he looked up all the previous winners. He noticed that many had gone on to play in the NFL. Jameis Winston, Tyrod Taylor, C.J. Spiller, Calvin Johnson. He talked with Ibrahim, who told him: “You’re going to get a tryout, at least. Whether you get drafted or not, you don’t win that award and not get at least a shot at the NFL.” If he got an opportunity, Conner said he knew what he would do with it. He would attack it like he did Hodgkin’s lymphoma. He would attack it like he does the weight room. He would attack it like he does each carry, running until his legs can’t run anymore. He hasn’t stopped since. (Top photo of James Conner talking to Cardinals teammates before an October game against Green Bay: Todd Rosenberg / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The Bulldogs jumped to No. 10 after defeating Tennessee on Saturday, knocking the Volunteers back to No. 11 and making them the first team out of the bracket.  The third CFP rankings — only two more to go before the ones that matter on Dec. 8 — featured an unchanged top-five, dominated by four Big Ten teams: No. 1 Oregon, No. 2 Ohio State, No. 3 Texas, No. 4 Penn State and No. 5 Indiana.

GO FURTHER College Football Playoff rankings: Boise State leaps to No. 4 seed, Georgia re-enters top 12 USA Today College football reaches the penultimate week of the regular season this week. As teams inch closer to the College Football Playoff, the scrutiny heightens, and much of the conversation is based on emotion, conference affiliation and school logos. But what do the facts and figures say about these teams? Here’s a look at how teams match up based on their resume. Continue reading here. GO FURTHER College Football Playoff blind resume analysis: Who can make the strongest case? Advertisement Todd Kirkland / Getty Images ATHENS, Ga. — Warde Manuel, Michigan’s athletic director and this year’s sacrificial spokesman for the College Football Playoff committee, said a curious thing after Tuesday night’s ranking unveiling. ESPN’s Rece Davis asked how much schedule strength mattered and generally what the committee looks at most. Continue reading here.

Everyone is talking about Indiana football, the No. 5 team in the land for the second straight week according to the College Football Playoff selection committee’s Tuesday offering.

Continue reading here. GO FURTHER Indiana, Tennessee are on course for a CFP committee showdown, so let’s get a head start Danny Wild / Imagn Images No. 19 Army (9-0) vs. No. 6 (8-seed) Notre Dame (9-1). If undefeated Army pulls this off, it would be by far the most impressive win among G5 contenders (sorry, NIU, which has fallen to 6-4 overall and 3-3 in the MAC). Does this mean Army jumps Big 12 leaders No. 14 BYU and No. 16 Colorado to become the fifth-highest-ranked theoretical conference champ, kicking the Big 12 out of the Playoff entirely? No. 12 Boise State already swiped the 4-seed (for now) and neither the Cougars (at No. 21 Arizona State) nor the Buffs (at Kansas) have sleeper games this weekend. And for style points, the Black Knights already won the season’s best jersey reveal. As for the Fighting Irish, I find it hard to believe they’d survive a second loss, especially without a conference championship that could pick up the slack. No. 5 (7-seed) Indiana (7-0) at No. 2 (5-seed) Ohio State (9-1). We’ve approached the Hoosiers’ prove-it week as they travel to face their first ranked opponent of the season (and that strength of schedule could come back to bite them in a loss). Ohio State has won a Big Ten-record 29 consecutive games over the Hoosiers, with the last loss coming in 1988, but these Hoosiers look different. The winner here likely punches their ticket to the Big Ten Championship Game with a chance to play for a first-round CFP bye.   No. 12 Boise State (9-1) gets a bye! BYU took a nose dive from No. 6 to No. 14 after losing to Kansas, which keeps it as the highest-ranked Big 12 team … but the fifth-highest-ranked hypothetical conference champ. That means No. 12 Boise State gets the first-round bye as the Mountain West champ. Although it didn’t affect seeding, BYU was also ranked behind No. 13 SMU, which prompted the Big 12 to throw some shade. Advertisement  No. 11 Tennesse (8-2). A two-loss SEC team will likely be left out of the field, and for now, the committee projects that team as Tennessee. One gripe for Vols fans? Tennessee is ranked FIVE spots lower than an Alabama team it beat 24-17. And unfortunately for Tennessee, the opportunity for resume-building wins has likely expired with only UTEP and Vanderbilt remaining. That means the Vols should be on upset alert for their fellow SEC brethren to open up a spot in the field. No. 10 (11-seed) Georgia (8-2) is back in after one week on the bubble. The Dawgs won their way in with a 31-17 win against Tennessee and look to be in good shape with only UMass and Georgia Tech remaining. As for the Vols, that game against Georgia looked just as much like a CFP eliminator to the committee as we thought.  Jeff Hanisch / Imagn Images Big Ten: Oregon (1), Ohio State (2), Penn State (4), Indiana (5), Illinois (25) SEC: Texas (3), Alabama (7), Ole Miss (9), Georgia (10), Tennessee (11), Texas A&M (15), South Carolina (18), Missouri (23) Independent: Notre Dame (6) ACC: Miami (8), SMU (13), Clemson (17) Mountain West: Boise State (12), UNLV (24) Big 12: BYU (14), Colorado (16), Arizona State (21), Iowa State (22) AAC: Army (19), Tulane (20)  UNLV is ranked in the College Football Playoff rankings for the first time ever. The conversation nobody’s having yet is that Texas probably shouldn’t end up in the field if the Longhorns lose at Texas A&M in the regular-season finale. Texas has no top-25 wins and will have lost both its games to top-15 opponents. That’s a resume that should be behind Alabama, Ole Miss and Georgia, especially since those first two beat Georgia and Georgia beat Texas. AND then Texas A&M would also have to be ahead of the Longhorns. Would the committee really drop a team from No. 3 to out? I don’t know. But the Longhorns don’t have much to stand on if they don’t beat the Aggies. Advertisement ACC's spots in the rankings.  Big 12's spots in the rankings I suspect if the eventual Big 12 champion wins out through the conference title game — whether that’s BYU, Colorado, Iowa State or Arizona State — that it would likely jump a Boise State team that wins the Mountain West and ultimately would earn the Big 12 a first-round bye. But I also think it would be totally fair for the one-loss Broncos, whose only loss is to Oregon on a last-second field goal, to finish ahead of the Big 12 winner (and/or a non-Miami ACC champ?) with one of those top 4 seeds.      Big Ten's spots in the rankings. Why is Miami at No. 8? Its best win is at Louisville, and the Cardinals just lost to Stanford. Miami also lost to Georgia Tech. I have the Hurricanes at No. 14 in my The Athletic 134 rankings, behind SMU, which is playing better, has the same good wins against Louisville and Duke and lost to a top-15 team in BYU. Is this just an eye test thing? I still think the ACC ultimately ends up with one bid so this may not matter, but Miami’s seeding could impact the seeding of the ACC champion. Advertisement Dale Zanine / Imagn Images Tennessee would be the first at-large team left out, and I’m OK with that. The Vols’ loss to Arkansas is a significant stain on their resume. Nonconference scheduling hasn’t seemed to play a major role yet in the weekly rankings, but I wonder if that could have been a deciding factor in favor of Tennessee if North Carolina State had been better. Now the question is whether a win over mighty Vanderbilt can boost the Vols’ standing enough. That’s college football in 2024, all right.      Big 12 is throwing shade. It would appear the selection committee puts a lot of stock in the eye test. That’s the only justification for where one-loss Texas, Penn State, Notre Dame and Miami are ranked compared to one-loss Boise State, SMU and BYU are ranked. But none of that justifies why Texas and Penn State are ranked ahead of a dominant and undefeated Indiana. If the Hoosiers get smoked at Ohio State this Saturday, that changes things. Right now, it doesn’t make much sense."

To get an update on where things stand, we turn to Austin Mock’s projections. Mock projects the score for every game and the final winning percentage for every team using his NFL betting model. The model phases out older data and uses data from this year as the season progresses. The simulation then runs 100,000 times after each day of games to give us, in this case, our projected top 10 draft order, plus each team’s projected win total and playoff chances. You can take a deeper dive into Mock’s playoff model here. And here’s the latest projected top 10 for April’s draft: A few thoughts on this week’s projections from The Athletic draft expert Nick Baumgardner:  Welcome to the top 10 of our projected order, Cowboys — we think you’re going to hate it here. This could be a tough spot for Dallas, depending on where things land. It’s pretty obvious the Cowboys need a running back, so they’ve been an easy early-process mock draft pairing for Ashton Jeanty. The Boise State dynamo is a legitimate first-round talent and will be a top-10 prospect on several NFL boards next spring. Jerry Jones, as we know, loves dynamos and running backs. Perfect fit, right? Advertisement Well … The Cowboys are definitely heading toward a high Round 1 slot, but their arsenal of picks could be better. As of Wednesday, Dallas has only three selections in the first four rounds. This roster has needs all over the place defensively, still needs a repaired offensive line and has to find at least one more truly dynamic pass-catching option for quarterback Dak Prescott. If Dallas winds up in the top 10 (and is honest with itself), it’ll be open for business immediately. GO DEEPER At 3-7, Cowboys faced with being 'realistic' and coming to terms that 2024 season is over Another team on a hard slide right now. At the very least, this looks like another head-coaching restart, and we’ll see if general manager Ryan Poles — who hired Matt Eberflus two days after he got the job in 2022 — is back. Nothing about this current situation is good. However, if the Bears decide to keep Poles, they have to make clear it’s a long-term collaboration that gives him a chance to see through some of these recent draft investments (Caleb Williams et al.). Otherwise, you’re going to have a GM on the hot seat making a top-10 draft pick, which rarely works as well as those in charge claim it will. Chicago’s remaining schedule is brutal, so we’ll surely find out soon which direction the franchise plans to take. Meanwhile, Williams needs a new interior offensive line and maybe a tackle. GO DEEPER Can't blame Caleb Williams for the Bears' loss to the Packers The Jaguars are likely headed for a new start (again), too. If the Chicago job comes open, the chance to coach Williams obviously will make it a huge deal. However, do not overlook the Jacksonville job this offseason, despite the fact the Jags looked like a college team Sunday in Detroit. This roster still has Trevor Lawrence, a young QB with elite physical tools who came into the league under one of the worst head coaches in NFL history (Urban Meyer). He’s since been working with Doug Pederson, who has struggled to maintain consistency alongside some of the front-office decisions made by Trent Baalke. Advertisement If the Jaguars restart properly — meaning they begin a search for a new GM first, then find a new head coach — this could be one of the most attractive jobs in football. There is quality young talent on offense and defence and a high pick incoming. Plus, as of now, Jacksonville has more 2025 draft capital than any other team. The chance to make a big bounce back in short order is there if Jacksonville can get itself together in time to take advantage of it.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"The Business of Football: Would-be Reading owner speaks, sleepless in Swansea and a BBC boost",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5927707/2024/11/20/business-of-football-reading-swansea-bbc/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 12:00:48 GMT","Matt Slater has news from around the EFL, as well as a development in the battle between the UK's two main broadcasters of radio sport","EFL Rob Couhig has advised clients in thousands of legal disputes, argued cases in hundreds of courtrooms, bought and sold businesses, run a successful baseball team and taken former non-Leaguers Wycombe Wanderers to the second-tier Championship but he has never experienced anything like his attempt to buy Reading. Advertisement After months of difficult negotiations, the 75-year-old American’s takeover of the club in League One, the third division of English football, collapsed at the final hurdle in September, without any explanation from Reading or their Chinese owner Dai Yongge. Since then, Couhig has not said anything publicly, politely declining requests for comment. Until now, that is. “I have deliberately not said anything because I would still like to do the deal we agreed,” he told The Athletic. “To this date, I have not been told why the deal wasn’t done. All the documents had been drafted and circulated by the sellers’ lawyers and they had been signed by every party, including the minority owners in Thailand, apart from Dai Yongge. “I got up that Monday morning thinking it was finally the day when we would get the keys — I told my wife I would be off to England again. But I then saw an email from our lawyers saying the money we had loaned the club had been returned. No explanation, no thanks.” The New Orleans-based lawyer suggested he and Reading should put out a joint statement but the club from London’s western commuter belt ignored him and issued their own, not that it told us much. Over the past nine weeks, rumours have been aired on forums and podcasts that it was Couhig’s fault. The theory goes that he either annoyed Dai by acting like he was already in charge or he tried to knock money off the agreed price at the last minute, like a house-buyer who finds damp in the basement. Couhig remains reluctant to get into the details, as he wants to honour the non-disclosure agreement he signed with the club and Dai, but he did not push back when The Athletic suggested he had agreed to pay £30million ($38m) for the club, with more than half of that sum being forwarded to Dai upon completion. Advertisement However, we have learned he also wanted to withhold some of the total payment as a form of insurance against any financial gremlins that might emerge later on. Couhig did not want to get into specifics but acknowledged “there was a reserve element to the price agreed because of potential undisclosed liabilities”. Asked for his best guess as to why his deal did not go through, Couhig thinks his plans for the club spooked the current regime. “Some people on the inside (of the club) could see there would be substantial change,” he said. “It’s a great club, with lots of good people, and we like the team and (head coach) Ruben (Selles), but it needs a managerial overhaul.” Reading declined to comment. And on the subject of his social media posts at the training ground and in a local bar somehow upsetting Dai, Couhig is very clear. “It’s nonsense,” he said. “I came to Reading four times and in every instance we were encouraged by the club to give the fans some hope that things were happening with the sale. Frankly, we were told it would be good for me to post some pictures.” In their statement on September 18, Reading said he and Dai had been “unable to find an agreement” and Couhig’s period of exclusivity had now expired. It added that the club would “pursue alternative options” and it soon emerged that they were in exclusivity with a new bidder, whose identity has been aggressively protected. Couhig says he does not know who that is and there has been no attempt by the newcomer(s) to make contact with him. This surprises him as nobody has done more work on Reading’s complicated ownership structure than he has and he still holds the liens — a form of security over property assets — he attached to his pre-takeover loans of almost £5million. Reading chief executive Dayong Pang has written to him about the liens, however, asking Couhig to release them. A request he rejected. Advertisement “I haven’t released the liens because the loans I made were integral to the sales process — I would not have loaned Reading if I didn’t think I was buying the club,” he explained. “I also spent over £1million on this deal. We hired lawyers and accountants to do the due diligence. We even went to the trouble of setting up new companies in the British Virgin Islands to help them out with their (secured debt) problem with (Chinese bank) Haitong. “Is it fair that I should be out of pocket? I don’t want to sound like I’m whining — what I really want is to do the deal — but I cannot release the liens even if I wanted to, because their lawyers drafted the documents and they are now in dispute with the club over their fees.” British law firm Walker Morris has filed a winding-up petition against Dai’s holding company for his Reading shares over unpaid fees. It is the fourth such petition the club and Dai have faced since 2020, as well as several points deductions from the EFL for late payments. And their problems are growing, as Couhig has started legal action of his own. “I’m absolutely sure they breached my exclusivity by talking to others,” he said. “We have a claim but we’ve turned it over to our solicitors. I’ll leave it at that. “I’m trying not to be controversial here but I’ve been doing deals for 40 years and I’ve never experienced anything like this before.” Chinese businessman Dai bought Reading in May 2017, the same month they narrowly failed to achieve a return to the Premier League via the play-offs. Since then, however, the club have been hit with points deductions for missing payments, sold most of their best players, downgraded their women’s team, lost staff and been relegated to League One. It has been grim. Having started with a story about an absence of business in football, let us move to an example of some bad business in football: the 2016 takeover of Swansea City by a group of U.S. investors led by Steve Kaplan, who owns a minority stake in the NBA’s Memphis Grizzlies, and Jason Levien, the co-chairman and CEO of MLS side D.C. United. Advertisement Swansea were nearing the end of their fifth consecutive season in the Premier League when Kaplan and Levien bought a majority stake in the Welsh club at a valuation of £110million. Unfortunately, they were relegated to the Championship in 2018 and have haemorrhaged money in that division ever since. But now — for Kaplan and Levien, at least — the bleeding has stopped, as they have sold their 65 per cent stake in Swansea to three investors they first introduced to the club last year: Andy Coleman, Brett Cravatt and Nigel Morris. A shareholder at D.C. United, Coleman has been Swansea’s chairman since May 2023, while private-equity firm boss Cravatt and Welsh-American fintech entrepreneur Morris have been on the board for over a year, too. Cravatt’s business partner Jason Cohen is joining the gang, too. But you know all this because The Athletic reported it two weeks ago. What we did not report, though, is the exact terms of the deal, saying only that the “precise value was contested”. Well, now we know, as one of several rather disgruntled fellow investors sent us the email Kaplan and Levien wrote to shareholders in Swansea Football Holdings, the club’s parent company, explaining why they were selling up and the deal they had secured. They reminded everyone how relegation had seen the club’s income fall by 80 per cent, with parachute payments and wage cuts only partially offsetting the pain. Their woes were compounded by the £30million they wasted on transfer fees and three-year contracts for strikers Andre Ayew and Wilfried Bony, in a failed attempt to avoid the drop, and the impact of the pandemic. There were two promotion play-offs appearances, including a defeat by Brentford in the 2021 final, but once the parachute payments stopped that summer it has been mid-table mediocrity and “substantial operating losses”. Advertisement In 2023, after “years of exhaustive searches for alternatives”, they brought in three new investor groups led by Coleman, Cravatt and Morris, in return for an equity injection of over £40million, and now, 18 months further on, “it is this group of investors who are purchasing our interests and committing to make another significant investment in the club”. Before outlining the terms of the deal in an attachment to the letter, “Jason and Steve” said they had “spent many sleepless nights over the years” worrying about what to do, acknowledged “there are things we would have done differently”, but assured everyone they had “forgone all management fees owed to us since relegation”, before asking them to “take some solace in that we never burdened you with a capital call”. “This is an outstanding group of partners,” they added. “It pains us that this investment did not work out financially.” So, just how bad was it? There are three parts to the deal. The first is a commitment by the newish investors to fund the club with a minimum of £20million in new equity. The second is a series of share transactions that hand over control of Swansea City to Cohen, Coleman, Cravatt and Morris for the grand total of $3,000, or £2,370. And the last is an “inducement agreement” between the club, on one side, and Kaplan, Levien and their investors, on the other, with the latter receiving an additional £10million for every season Swansea spend in the Premier League between now and May 2035, capped at a maximum of £40m. Does that give investors a fair chance of getting some more money back or is it just condemning them to another decade of dashed hopes?  As difficult as things have been at Swansea, they have been considerably worse at Morecambe, who are bottom of League Two, the fourth and last tier of English league football. Never the biggest of EFL clubs, and rather fittingly nicknamed the Shrimps as a nod to the local fishing industry on the Lancashire coast in the north-west of England, Morecambe have been particularly hamstrung in recent years by their majority owners’ inability — or refusal — to fund them adequately. Advertisement This happens, unfortunately, but normally owners do what Kaplan and Levien did in south Wales: suck it up, sell the club and move on. The Bond Group, however, has spent the past 26 months trying to sell Morecambe to people who clearly cannot afford the inflated price the Bond Group wants. For much of that period, the intended buyer was Sarbjot Johal, a 21-year-old from Birmingham, in the English Midlands, who claims to have made millions in soft drinks, property and crypto. The Bond Group, where the sole director is a businessman called Jason Whittingham, eventually gave up on Johal ever being able to convince the EFL he had the money to run a club and moved on to a new mystery bidder. In an interview with British radio station talkSPORT in June, Whittingham, who bought the club in 2018 with his business partner Colin Goldring, said he hoped to announce a sale to this bidder within two weeks (narrator: he did not). The situation has been deteriorating at Morecambe for years, with the EFL docking the club three points last season for late payments to players and putting them under embargo for tax issues. This would have been alarming enough at any club but it caused real concern at Morecambe as the Bond Group’s first foray into professional sport had ended in 2022 with the bankruptcy of English rugby-union side Worcester Warriors. The embargo has been lifted and they have so far managed to avoid any further disciplinary action this season but the club’s fans are thoroughly fed up with the Bond Group and its mystery bidder. Last Saturday, there was a protest march to the home game against Port Vale, with black balloons released as the players took the pitch. And then, as the clock hit 26 minutes, fans turned their backs on the game for two minutes. Unfortunately, that meant they had turned around again in time to see the visitors score on their way to a 1-0 win. Advertisement “The protest showed how important the club’s future is to the fans and the people of our town,” said Tarnia Elsworth, the chair of fans’ group the Shrimps Trust. “This isn’t just about a team playing on a Saturday, this is about one man mishandling a community asset. Bond Group need to sell the club quickly — if the current interested buyers cannot provide the paperwork needed to the EFL, they need to move aside so the club can be sold to someone who can. “Fan efforts will increase, this protest is just the start… pressure will continue until the club is sold to an appropriate new owner.” The Athletic has tried to reach the Bond Group via the club but has not received any response. After three helpings of ownership woe, let us finish with some huge news about the BBC’s coverage of the Premier League and its implications for the British sports media industry. No, not that story. Earlier this month, the Premier League announced it had sold its live radio rights to the BBC and talkSPORT. The agreement, which shared six packages of games between the two outlets over four years, starts next season. So what, right? The radio rights are so much cheaper than the TV ones that the league never bothers even revealing a ballpark figure for the amount it receives for them. But there was an interesting difference to the result of this auction as it has left the BBC with 65 live matches a season in the Saturday 3pm slot and talkSPORT with none. Everything else — talkSPORT getting the early Saturday kick-off and all non-weekend games; the BBC hoovering up the rest of the weekend — was the same as in the current deal. This begged two questions: what is the BBC going to do with the second 3pm game and what is talkSPORT planning for Saturday afternoons? Advertisement Well, we asked and we were told that the BBC is going to broadcast one game on 5 Live, as normal, and the other on 5 Sports Extra, its digital sister station. And talkSPORT is going with an around-the-grounds offering led by presenter Adrian Durham, as well as commentary from games in the EFL, FA Cup, Women’s Super League and Premiership Rugby. So, that’s two mysteries solved. Sorry, we have no idea who will be presenting Match of the Day next season.

The 38-year-old lost his singles match in straight sets (4-6, 4-6) against Botic van de Zandschulp in, what turned out to be, the final match of his professional career. Fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz levelled the tie with a straight-sets win (7-6, 6-3) against Tallon Griekspoor, but Alcaraz and doubles partner Marcel Granollers lost both tiebreaks in the desperately close decider against Dutch duo Wesley Koolhof and Van de Zandschulp. Streaming: Fubo (try for free) Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here GO FURTHER Rafael Nadal’s tennis evolution into an all-time great: ‘Every year he improved’ Getty Images Some quotes just reaching us that signal what we all thought, courtesy of Jose Morgado on X. “I feel that this was my last professional singles match,” said Nadal in his post-match press conference. So even if Spain come back against the Netherlands today, it sounds like we have seen the last of the 22-time Grand Slam champion, at least in singles. Incidentally, Nadal has just come back into the arena to watch Alcaraz who is serving at *4-5 in a tight first set against Griekspoor. I can't think of too many better cheerleaders! Advertisement  The emotion of the day started early this morning when one of Nadal's greatest friends and certainly his greatest rival, Roger Federer, penned a lovely letter. The final match of Federer's career was a doubles match with Nadal at the 2022 Laver Cup, and he found all the right words to mark an emotional day. Getty Images All of the talk today will be about Rafa Nadal, and rightly so, but lots of credit must go to Botic van de Zandschulp. Early on, he looked awkward against a player who he claimed was an idol of his before the match, but he soon grew into the contest. And perhaps the best praise of the Dutchman was that he found his best stuff in almost every single one of the big points. That is the kind of praise we would have levelled at Nadal in years gone by, so Van de Zandschulp deserves tremendous credit in a unique atmosphere. Getty Images Nadal's record in Davis Cup matches is astonishing. Coming into today, he was on a streak of 32 consecutive wins in the competition across the singles and doubles event. And, in singles, his only defeat prior to today in 30 Davis Cup matches came when he was a 17-year-old playing his first-ever match in the 2004 tournament. His brilliant record at the Davis Cup — including five titles (2004, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2019) — ranks among the very best of his records in his glittering career. Getty Images And just because Nadal was beaten, it doesn't mean that the Spanish fans didn't enjoy themselves along the way. There were so many of his trademark fist pumps and roars of celebration, I think mostly in an attempt to get himself going. It worked a few times and, while the 38-year-old will rue a couple of simple misses, I'm sure he adored being back out there in front a home crowd. Getty Images In spite of that result, it has been one of the great days for the mostly Spanish crowd inside the arena in Malaga. They have been treated to potentially the last match of Rafa Nadal's career and are now watching the heir to his throne, Carlos Alcaraz. I, for one, am very jealous. And, if those Spanish fans in attendance get their way, they'll be seeing Alcaraz in action again later in the deiciding doubles match. Advertisement Getty Images Ask any player what they think of when they think of Nadal and they all say some version of the same thing — the ultimate competitor. That fire was all still there Tuesday, even as van de Zandschulp made it increasingly clear that he was going to be too tough an out for Nadal.  There Nadal was, down a set and 0-2 and desperate not to go down a double break, sprinting to the back of the court to catch up with a lob and fire back a desperate, spinning overhead as his body kept barrelling toward the back fence. Nadal came at him like the ocean. Van de Zandschulp stemmed his tide. Nadal, ultimately, was here for it as he always has been, healthy or not. It’s what kept him around, kept him trying to come back amid all the injuries. The big question he will have to answer beginning next week is how he can feed that hunger. Casper Ruud has said he is a terror on the golf course. He’s mad for the parchisi board game. Will that be enough? It’s hard to think so. Getty Images This was what the Malaga crowd had come to see, what some had paid thousands of euros for. Nadal playing singles, and for most of the first set, looking like he could deliver the win that almost everyone in the packed arena was willing into existence. The home supporters couldn’t have done much more. They went wild after every point Nadal won, and regularly serenaded him with chants of “Rafa, Rafa, Rafa!” When he clinched his first break of serve, more than 10,000 fans roared as if their man had just won a Grand Slam title. Credit must go to van de Zandschulp for staying so zen. Based just on his body language, it would have been tough to tell whether he was playing in arguably the biggest match of his career or against a friend in his local park. Credit too for the Dutch fans, who massed together in their distinctive orange made plenty of noise as they revelled in their nation’s role as the ultimate tennis party pooper. Despite the defeat for Nadal and his possible farewell, this definitely felt more celebration than wake. GO FURTHER Rafael Nadal Davis Cup analysis: Nadal loses to Botic van de Zandschulp of Netherlands Getty Images When van de Zandschulp hit two double faults in a row up 40-0 his first service game, it felt as though his nerves at playing his idol might undermine his chance of winning. When he hit two more at 3-4 in the first set, the first of which was a foot fault, that feeling strengthened. But the Dutchman escaped from the game, broke Nadal straight after and then served the set out pretty comfortably. Van de Zandschulp counterbalanced those four double faults in the first set with five aces, and aside from those extremely shaky moments, he served well, as the numbers above indicate. Then he did the hardest thing of all, serving out against Nadal in front of a crowd that wanted him to play forever. Getty Images Nadal’s inability to serve at a sufficient level is driving him away from tennis more than anything else. It was never the strongest part of his game — when he first burst onto the scene, it was probably the weakest — but he got so much better. Nadal’s average first serve on Tuesday floated around the 110mph mark. Against van de Zandschulp and just about everyone else he faced this year, that limitation sucked him into multi-shot rallies that his body just doesn’t can’t cope with anymore. Serves look like they are about arms and shoulders, but really they are about the spine and the abdominal muscles and the hips: areas of the body that could be a rundown of Nadal’s injury problems the past two years. Through the first set, Nadal landed 61 percent of his first serves and won 70 percent of those points. Despite four double faults in that set, van de Zandschulp was serving at 76 percent and winning 90 percent of those points. Those numbers are tough to overcome. GO FURTHER Rafael Nadal Davis Cup analysis: Nadal loses to Botic van de Zandschulp of Netherlands Getty Images It is very likely that Alcaraz will level this tie with his singles match against Griekspoor. And if he can then star again in the deciding doubles match, it will leave Spain captain David Ferrer with a tough decision to make. He will have to choose whether to use Nadal again in the semifinal, where Spain would be facing Germany or Canada. Based on today's evidence, Nadal will battle valiantly against anyone, but it is hard to see him beating any top-100 players.  In the end, the 4-6, 4-6 scoreline flattered the retiring 38-year-old a bit. Advertisement Getty Images This second match was always going to be an important one, but Alcaraz now needs two consecutive victories this evening to keep Spain in the Davis Cup. He is the overwhelming favourite to come through the singles match against Tallon Griekspoor and, if he does that, he is pencilled in for the deciding doubles match. Alcaraz is set to line up alongside Marcel Granollers for that match, and they are due to face Botic van de Zandschulp and the retiring 35-year-old Wesley Koolhof. Botic van de Zandschulp beat Rafael Nadal in the Davis Cup quarterfinals at the Palacio de Deportes José María Martín Carpena 6-4, 6-4 Tuesday. Van de Zandschulp prevailed over Nadal in a match ultimately decided by a battle of serves. The result leaves the Netherlands 1-0 up in the tie, with Carlos Alcaraz to face Tallon Griekspoor in the second singles rubber. If Alcaraz levels the tie with a victory, then it will come down to the doubles between Alcaraz and Marcelo Granollers and Griekspoor and Wesley Koolhof to decide things. Should Spain lose, Nadal’s tennis career will officially be over. And below, The Athletic’s writers, Charlie Eccleshare and Matt Futterman, analyze the match and what it means for Nadal. GO FURTHER Rafael Nadal Davis Cup analysis: Nadal loses to Botic van de Zandschulp of Netherlands  Speaking in the build-up to today's quarter-final against the Netherlands, Alcaraz discussed what this week means to him. ""It's probably the most special tournament I'll play in my career, because of what's happening, because of the circumstances,"" he said. ""The Davis Cup has always been a tournament that I'd love to win one day. I'm passionate about representing Spain. ""Having Rafa by my side, knowing it's his last tournament, will make it much more special."" In an interview with ATP, the 21-year-old added: ""Rafa's farewell is much more important, at least for me. The Davis Cup is every year. Rafa's farewell, saying goodbye to a legend of the sport, unfortunately only happens once. ""Personally I’m very excited to be by Rafa's side for his farewell."" Nadal's compatriot Carlos Alcaraz will look to keep Spain's hopes alive in the next singles match. The world No 3 will face Tallon Griekspoor who is 37 places below him in the rankings. Getty Images Botic van de Zandschulp, speaking to Tennis Channel post-match, said: ""In the beginning, we were both nervous. The first serves didn't go smoothly, the crowd was tough, of course. Understandable. ""That's what it is to play here in Spain against Rafa. It was a really special event. ""It's tough to close out a match against him, knowing it could be his last (match) or not. I was hoping a bit more than going for it, so I just went for it and that did help in the end. ""(The support) was unbelievable, I needed it. There were too many people here cheering for him! I needed them a lot today."" Advertisement Getty Images Rafa, ever the sportsman, shakes hands with Van de Zandschulp and the umpire, wipes his face, before walking back onto the court and raising his hands to the fans. The crowd, Spanish and Dutch alike, rise to their feet to applaud the legendary Nadal. A deserved standing ovation. Getty Images Rafael Nadal 4-6, 4-6 Botic van de Zandschulp And Botic van de Zandschulp holds on! Nadal nets and loses in the Davis Cup, 6-4, 6-4. The Netherlands 1-0 up on Spain in this tie. Rafael Nadal 4-6, *4-5 Botic van de Zandschulp Nadal must break here to avoid the Netherlands going 1-0 up on Spain in this Davis Cup tie. Ah, Rafa gets to the ball and is lined up to slap a forehand winner down the line, but misplaces it and instantly puts his hand to his head in disappointment. Again, he appears in control, but in centre court, drags one wide and can't believe it. 30-0. What a point! Nadal is suddenly possessed by the ghost of his former self and plays a blinding point, forcing Van de Zandschulp into positions where lesser men would have lost the point on multiple occasions. Brilliant, athletic defence from the Dutchman, who almost steals it but lands it narrowly wide. 30-all, the crowd very loud now. Even more so as Van de Zandschulp misses a first serve.

Bentancur will remain suspended from domestic competitions while the appeal is heard, meaning he will be unavailable for Tottenham’s trip to Manchester City on Saturday. Bentancur was given a seven-game ban from domestic games and fined £100,000 ($127k) by an independent commission after he was found to have used “insulting words”, and that it was an ‘aggravated breach’ of the Football Association’s rules, as his words referred to “ethnic origin, colour, race, nationality”. Bentancur had said, with reference to Son, “Sonny, or one of Sonny’s cousins, as they all look more or less the same” in an interview on Uruguayan TV in June. Advertisement Tottenham were informed of the FA’s decision on November 12 and they had 14 days to decide whether to appeal against the decision itself or the sanction imposed, so until November 27. Tottenham have decided to accept the decision but to appeal against the sanction, in the hope of getting the ban reduced. A Tottenham statement read: “We can confirm that the club has appealed against the length of Rodrigo Bentancur’s FA suspension, issued earlier this week. “While we accept the guilty finding against Rodrigo by the independent regulatory commission, we believe the subsequent sanction is severe. “Rodrigo will remain suspended from domestic competitions while the appeal is heard and the club will make no further comment during this time.” There is likely only scope for a reduction by one game to Bentancur’s ban, given that the FA Standard Minimum ban for using discriminatory language is six games, a guideline that was introduced in 2020. While a regulatory commission can give a shorter ban in situations where the comments were made in writing or via the use of a “communication device” — such as when Edinson Cavani got a three-game ban in 2020 for a comment he made on Instagram — this is not the case here, as Bentancur’s comments were spoken in a TV interview. Decisions on the length of the ban, within the framework of six and 12 games, are made with reference to aggravating and mitigating factors. “We consider that, in terms of culpability and consequences, this breach falls towards the lower end of the guideline range but not the lowest point,” the commission wrote of Bentancur’s offence. “Cases can easily be envisaged which are less serious than this, but nevertheless subject to the minimum suspension of six matches.” The aggravating factors considered were that Bentancur is a “high-profile international footballer” in the Premier League and that his comments were made to a well-known journalist with a big online following. “It was reasonably foreseeable that the remarks would be widely distributed via posts and re-posts on the internet, as they were,” the report states. With the suspension still in place pending the outcome of the appeal, if Bentancur’s ban is reduced from seven to six games, then he could return to face Liverpool in the Premier League on December 22.

This is the seventh injection of capital since the club was bought in October 2021, by a consortium led by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), and takes their total post-takeover investment into Newcastle to £337.9m. Advertisement The latest equity share issue, as with the majority of the previous ones, is to help with cashflow over the winter months and provides for day-to-day running costs. It does not necessarily directly affect Newcastle’s January transfer plans and instead will be used to pay wages, maintenance and to cover other daily expenditure. Merit payments from the Premier League are paid in lump-sum instalments across the season and, to cover costs during a period when such significant funds are not coming in on a monthly basis, Newcastle’s owners have bought additional shares. Companies typically issue new shares to raise finance for business operations. That means the money does not need to be paid back, in the way a lower-interest-rate or even interest-free loan may be expected to be. Mike Ashley, the previous owner, had used interest-free loans to cover costs, rather than share issues, and received £106.9m as part of the price for the club to ensure those were repaid. Companies House documents show that via PZ Newco, which is the company in charge of Newcastle United, one share in the club was purchased on October 30 for £35m. The previous cash injections via share issues were in November 2021 (£38.5m), January 2022 (£40.0m), October 2022 (£70.4m), February 2023 (£57.0m), August 2023 (£60.0m) and March 2024 (£37.0m). Following Amanda Staveley’s departure as co-owner in the summer, PIF has an 85 per cent majority stake in Newcastle, while the Reuben family, who are represented on the board by Jamie Reuben, hold the remaining 15 per cent. GO DEEPER The Premier League Owners: Who has invested the most? Social-media excitement always follows these share issues by Newcastle United’s owners — and, at risk of being the party pooper, this does not given an indication as to what the club’s January transfer plans will be, or whether a final decision has been made on the future of St James’ Park. Some of the club’s day-to-day running costs are indirectly covered by this injection, such as scout trips to watch players and the money being spent on the stadium feasibility study, but Newcastle insist the latest £35m share issue follows the previous pattern of being for daily expenditure during months when cashflow is low. Advertisement What the £337.9m total post-takeover investment shows is the continued commitment of the ownership, alongside the clear need to increase revenue streams. Eventually, if Newcastle can generate greater income through commercial deals and repeat qualification for Europe, then the club can become more self-sustaining, rather than be reliant on cash injections from ownership. Newcastle may yet sign a right-winger, a centre-half or a player for another position come the start of 2025, but their January blueprint has yet to be fully determined and this does not provide any confirmation of what their mid-season transfer plans will be.

Westbrook surpassed Oscar Robertson’s NBA record of 181 triple-doubles in May 2021 and topped Robertson’s single-season triple-double record with 42 in 2016-17. Advertisement Westbrook holds three of the top four spots in NBA history for most triple-doubles in a single season. “I’m truly grateful just to go out and play and (be) given every opportunity that God has blessed me with,” Westbrook said. “I’m grateful for so many things, and especially for tonight.” Behind Westbrook and Robertson, Magic Johnson ranks third with 138 career triple-doubles, followed by Westbrook’s teammate Nikola Jokić with 136. Westbrook, 36, is not the first late-career star to make triple-double news this season, as LeBron James, 39, made history last week by becoming the oldest player in NBA history to tally three consecutive triple-doubles. James, who turns 40 in late December, trails only Karl Malone for oldest player with a triple-double. Malone pulled off the feat at 40 years, 127 days old with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2003.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Ohio State starting center Seth McLaughlin sidelined with Achilles injury,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5934264/2024/11/19/seth-mclaughlin-ohio-state-center-achilles/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 04:00:33 GMT",McLaughlin has been a key cog on Ohio State's offensive line in his first season with the Buckeyes after transferring from Alabama.,"NCAAF By Bruce Feldman and Cameron Teague Robinson Ohio State starting center Seth McLaughlin injured his Achilles at practice on Tuesday, a program source told The Athletic. Ohio State is waiting for the results of his MRI to come back. A second OSU source said the Buckeyes should know more in the morning but that it did not look good. Advertisement The Alabama transfer has been a terrific addition for Ohio State this fall. The 6-foot-4, 305-pound McLaughlin, who started 24 games over the previous three seasons at center for the Crimson Tide, is a finalist for the Campbell Trophy, college football’s premier scholar-athlete award. He graduated summa cum laude in 2.5 years from Alabama with a bachelor’s degree in finance and a perfect 4.0 GPA. The Columbus Dispatch first reported the news of McLaughlin’s injury. Ohio State is set to play a top-five matchup against Indiana at home on Saturday, meaning it now has three days to figure out who is going to step in at center and what the rest of the line looks like. The easy solution is to push the current left guard, Carson Hinzman, back to center where he started 12 games last season. He’s been playing left guard since left tackle Zen Michalski went down against Nebraska and starting left guard Donovan Jackson had to swing outside to left tackle. If Ohio State moves Hinzman to center, it has a few options to fill out the left side of the line. The easy one is to move in Austin Siereveld, who started two games at left guard in place of an injured Jackson to start the season. He’s since moved to right guard and split time with Tegra Tshabola until recently when Tshabola won the job full time. Siereveld has been inconsistent, so if Ryan Day and the Buckeyes don’t want to move him back to left guard, they could turn to Luke Montgomery. A four-star recruit in the Class of 2023 from Findlay, Ohio, Montgomery played left guard in the Nebraska game when Michalski went down in the second half. He’s one of the last reserve options Ohio State has at the position. There’s also the option of moving Jackson back to guard, but Ohio State doesn’t have any depth at tackle and Jackson has played well at his new position. Ohio State likely prefers keeping him at tackle and filling the rest of the holes inside. Advertisement Regardless of who gets the nod, there will be pressure to perform well immediately, with key games against Indiana and Michigan to close the regular season. There’s no learning curve, which makes the idea of moving Siereveld back into the lineup the likely, and most rational, option. According to The Athletic’s Austin Mock, Ohio State had the best odds to win the national championship, at 25 percent, before this injury. How well the Buckeyes deal with McLaughlin’s absence will determine their postseason fate. — Teague Robinson (Photo: Ian Johnson / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Canada tops Suriname with ease to advance to Nations League Finals,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5934115/2024/11/19/canada-suriname-concacaf-results-analysis/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 03:15:28 GMT",The win sends Canada back to the Nations League Finals during the next international window in March 2025.,"International Football One year ago at BMO Field in Toronto, Canada’s men’s national team finished a season to forget with a disappointing loss to Jamaica and a shocking exit from the Nations League quarterfinals. But with a new coach, an all-encompassing playing style and plenty of new additions to the player pool, much has changed for the better. And that much was evident one year later as a revamped Canada side made no mistake in this year’s Nations League quarterfinal, finishing off Suriname with a convincing 3-0 win. The 4-0 aggregate win sends Canada back to the Nations League Finals during the next international window in March 2025. Goals from Jonathan David — his program-leading 31st goal — and two more from Jacob Shaffelburg were enough to topple a Suriname team that barely put up a fight. JACOB SHAFFELBURG IS A BALLER 🌟 That's a brace for the kid from Nova Scotia. #CANMNT 🇨🇦pic.twitter.com/bAFz0Os0zB — Major League Soccer (@MLS) November 20, 2024  Canada can take pride in a consistent performance but leaves knowing there are sterner tests ahead of them. The team will next play in the Nations League beginning March 20. Advancing to the Nations League Finals means Canada has qualified for the 2025 Gold Cup. Coach Jesse Marsch set a serious tone ahead of the game, demanding more out of his players after an unconvincing but necessary win in the first leg. He demanded an “aggressive” approach and behind the scenes, directed players to be far more purposeful in their movements. Advertisement A clear positive from the second leg is that, quite simply, his team responded. Canada’s movement in the final third was more dynamic and creative compared to the first leg. The hosts had far more jump in their step, seeming to take Marsch’s desire to attack the game early to heart. Set pieces were taken quickly as Canada looked intent on righting the wrongs of leg one, where their set pieces left something to be desired. David’s 23rd-minute goal felt inevitable. It marked Canada’s tenth under Marsch and David has been involved in eight of them. The goal didn’t come directly off a set piece, but it wasn’t long after a corner either. Considering Canada maintained possession after a corner and ended up finding the back of the net? That’s a source of promise. Shaffelburg’s goal six minutes later might have largely been a solo effort, but it was still a result of everything Marsch wants in this team: verticality, pressing and purposeful movements. Shaffelburg chasing down a long Moise Bombito pass and deftly pushing it past Suriname’s Etienne Vaessen was pure Maritime Messi: relentless and full of swagger. Shaffelburg added a tap-in goal from a slick Cyle Larin pass in the 67th minute. By the end of the first half, Canada had another goal disallowed and had effectively put the game to bed. You can chalk up some of the results on the night to a dreadful performance from Suriname. The gulf in quality was as wide as the distance between the two nations. But nevertheless, for Canada to stomp on the visitors, as directed, was the kind of confidence-building performance this group needs. There’s been a feeling inside the Canadian side that they’ve been lacking a truly convincing performance lately, instead of waiting too long to put games away. Moving with purpose and pace and clear finishing ability allows this group to feel like they’re trending in the right direction with a five-month layoff incoming. Advertisement After two goals against Suriname and a breakout year for Canada, what comes next for Shaffelburg? The winger has proven he can be a valuable contributor in a pressing system that requires him to move with ceaseless energy. This year, very few players elevated their game for Canada like Shaffelburg. “It’s definitely a spot to get more eyes on you,” Shaffelburg said of playing for Canada. “But it helps to have the guys on this team. We have a lot of big-name players so you know everyone is going to be watching.” JACOB SHAFFELBURG IS HIM! 😤@CANMNT_Official is off and running. 🇨🇦pic.twitter.com/j0eyWkFqNc — Major League Soccer (@MLS) November 20, 2024  The technical side of Sahffelburg’s game is still a work in progress, sure. But there’s enough of a base in his skill set to suggest a move away from MLS isn’t far-fetched. Shaffelburg’s current contract expires in two years. His stock has never been higher. Shaffelburg also switched agents recently. Could a winter move be incoming? “I’m at the point where if the right opportunity comes up, of course, I would take it,” Shaffelburg said. One of Canada’s unquestioned stars of a wildly surprising Copa America run was goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau. The 30-year-old has long been the starter-in-waiting. His ability to command Canada’s back line, read the play and provide shot-stopping when necessary made for a terrific story too: Crepeau was likely ready to challenge longtime keeper Milan Borjan for the starting spot at the 2022 World Cup, but suffered a devastating injury just before heading to Qatar. Yet as soon as Crepeau was elevated to the starting job, he might have lost the job just as quickly. Dayne St. Clair started both legs against Suriname. The Minnesota United goalkeeper brings a more athletic approach to the position and has four inches of size and longer reach than Crepeau as well. After two starts in a row — and no goals allowed — does that mean he’s now in the pole position for the starter’s job? Advertisement “It’s the best situation we’ve ever been in,” St. Clair told The Athletic of the relationship between him and Crepeau. “We support each other well. Obviously, it’s a tricky situation. Jesse told us it’s going to be a battle. Just because one guy plays one game, it doesn’t mean the battle is over.” Suriname only put up one shot on target in the second leg. But with Canada playing a high back line, an aggressive goalkeeper like St. Clair is necessary. He looked up for the task on a chilly evening by the water in Toronto. Marsch called up three newcomers during the October international window. Dual national center back Jamie Knight-Lebel was the only one who got another call up a month later. The 18-year-old made his debut for Canada against Suriname, entering in the 73rd minute. Marsch has one eye on the future when it comes to Knight-Lebel. Center back remains an area of weakness for Canada as there’s a concerning lack of depth in the position. Knight-Lebel provides sturdy, reliable play and his debut suggests he might be part of Marsch’s long-term plans. Knight-Lebel became the seventh player to make his debut for Canada since Marsch took over as Canada’s coach in May. Niko Sigur, Tani Oluwaseyi, Zorhan Bassong, Nathan Saliba, Kwasi Poku and Stephen Afrifa were the others. Marsch’s injection of youth into this squad has been long overdue. (Photo: John E.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Celtics rain 3s to hand Cavaliers first loss of season: Takeaways from marquee early-season clash,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5933909/2024/11/19/cavaliers-celtics-score-result-takeaways/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 02:47:34 GMT",Jayson Tatum scored 33 points and the Celtics hit 22 3-pointers on 41 attempts to earn a 120-117 home victory over the Cavaliers.,"NBA By Jared Weiss, Jay King, Sam Amick and Mike Prada The Cleveland Cavaliers’ perfect start to the 2024-25 NBA season is over thanks to a barrage of 3s from the defending NBA champion Boston Celtics. Jayson Tatum scored 33 points and the Celtics hit 22 3-pointers on 41 attempts to earn a 120-117 home victory over the Cavaliers in a game billed as an early preview of a potential Eastern Conference finals. Advertisement Cleveland’s 15-0 start will remain tied with the 1993-94 Houston Rockets and the 1948-49 Washington Capitols for the second-best start to a season, behind the 24-0 mark the Golden State Warriors achieved in their eventual 73-win season in 2015-16. All three teams reached that season’s NBA Finals, though only the Rockets won a championship. Boston moves to 12-3 this season and pulls within two and a half games of Cleveland for the top spot in the Eastern Conference. Both teams are 1-1 in NBA Cup play. The Celtics led by as many as 21 points early in the third quarter, making 18 3s in the first 28 minutes of the game. Cleveland then stormed back with a 22-5 run led by Evan Mobley, who scored 14 points in the quarter, including a put-back dunk off his own miss. Cleveland cut the deficit to two points on multiple occasions, but Tatum nailed a stepback 3 over Cavaliers forward Georges Niang at the third-quarter buzzer to give Boston a 93-88 advantage entering the final quarter. JT, THAT'S TOUGH 😮‍💨 The step-back triple gives the Celtics a 5-point lead heading into the 4th! 🏆 East Group C action🏀 CLE-BOS on TNT pic.twitter.com/S56OofnmnT — NBA (@NBA) November 20, 2024  The Cavaliers kept threatening early in the fourth quarter, but Boston always seemed to have an answer. A Payton Pritchard 3 off a kickout pass from Tatum gave Boston a seven-point lead with 5:29 remaining and ignited the TD Garden crowd. A 3-pointer by Derrick White and two blocks from Al Horford provided Boston some separation, and Cleveland failed cut Boston’s lead to less than three points afterward. Mobley finished with 22 points and 11 assists while Donovan Mitchell shook off a slow start to finish with 35 points.  If this is all there is among the Eastern Conference elite, with the Celtics and Cavs looking like world-beaters and every other squad … not, then let’s take the glass-is-half-full approach and appreciate what we have rather than what we don’t. In that regard, it was fitting that this beautiful basketball game took place on the same day as the Philadelphia 76ers’ implosion continuing with news of their star players calling each other out in team meetings to discuss their demise. Advertisement The Sixers, much like the Milwaukee Bucks, were widely expected to be part of a loaded East where it would take months to truly decipher which team the Celtics should be most concerned about. Instead, with Cleveland’s 15-0 start putting the Cavs in rarified historic air that typically leads to a finals appearance, Boston saw its lone true threat coming and wasted no time sending an impressive early message about their plans to continue inhabiting the NBA’s throne. Yet while the ending of this Cavs streak keeps them from chasing the league record, it changes nothing about the clear legitimacy of this matchup. The Cavs, who fell to the Celtics without Mitchell, Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert in their second-round series last postseason, nearly pulled off the comeback despite not having four of their top 11 rotation players (Dean Wade, Max Strus, LeVert and Isaac Okoro) on Tuesday. What’s more, they lost by three in a game where Darius Garland had one of the worst shooting nights of his life (3-for-21 overall; 0-for-6 on 3s). So yes, in other words, it’s quite clear that Celtics-Cavs is the best thing going so far in this early NBA season. — Sam Amick, senior NBA writer After giving up a load of points in the paint to the Atlanta Hawks and the Toronto Raptors, coach Joe Mazzulla hammered home the same points of emphasis over recent days: individual defense and rebounding. He believed the Celtics’ point-of-attack defenders needed to handle their assignments better, while the defenders needed to improve their positioning. And Mazzulla wanted the defensive rebounding, which had slipped to 20th over the past five games, to, ahem, rebound. Though the Celtics gave up 22 points in the paint during an ugly third quarter, which let Cleveland back into the game, they also showed their defense can still punch much more like Mike Tyson in his prime than the 58-year-old version. Mitchell scored 35 points but needed 29 field goal attempts and six free throw attempts to accomplish it. Garland, having a big season, scored just eight points. Advertisement The Cavaliers, who entered the game shooting 41.9 percent from behind the arc, tied a season-low with 10 3-pointers. They only created 29 3-point attempts, just one more than their season low. The Celtics still showed their vulnerabilities on defense, especially during the destructive third quarter. But they brought a different type of edge for the big game. Now they need to do it more consistently in less exciting matchups. — Jay King, Celtics beat writer Cleveland’s offense has been tearing through the league, but it finally ran into a brick wall in Boston. The winning streak is over, as Cleveland finally had a poor shooting night from deep and couldn’t keep up with Boston’s 3-point barrage. The Cavs made some effective halftime adjustments to get Mobley post-ups against Boston’s smalls to spark a third-quarter run, while Mitchell had success mismatch hunting. Mitchell showed who the top dog in Cleveland is with some crunch-time magic, but Cleveland never quite found the offensive flow it’s had all season. The Cavaliers were never going to finish the season 82-0. Mitchell said before the game that Cleveland wants to learn some lessons from this game, win or lose. The Cavs have to figure out their math problem against the Celtics. Dominating the paint won’t be enough against Boston most nights. The Cavaliers know they have a lot to work on to take down the defending champs, but the second half of this game showed they have the potential to do it. — Jared Weiss, Celtics beat writer (Photo: Bob DeChiara / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Jets owner Woody Johnson suggested benching Aaron Rodgers in September: Sources,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5933645/2024/11/19/aaron-rodgers-woody-johnson-benching-jets/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 02:22:16 GMT",The idea of benching the future Hall of Famer sounded so absurd that one coach asked whether the owner was serious.,"NFL The New York Jets fired general manager Joe Douglas on Tuesday, six weeks after the team fired coach Robert Saleh. According to multiple team sources who spoke to The Athletic about the team’s inner workings, Woody Johnson suggested a more drastic move earlier in the season. According to those sources, the day after the Jets’ loss to the Denver Broncos on Sept. 29, there was a contentious meeting at the team facility. It included Johnson, Douglas, vice chairman Christopher Johnson, team president Hymie Elhai, and Ira Akselrad, an adviser to Johnson. It also included a group of coaches: Saleh, offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett, then-defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich and special teams coordinator Brant Boyer among them. Advertisement The coaches had been called in to explain what happened with their units during the 10-9 home loss to the Broncos. During the meeting, Johnson suggested to the coaches that they bench Aaron Rodgers in favor of Tyrod Taylor because he felt Rodgers’ performance was holding the team back. The coaches and Douglas, stunned at the suggestion, talked him out of it and convinced Johnson to stay the course and that benching Rodgers, with his pedigree, four games into the season would not sit well with the locker room. The coaches also felt it would embarrass Rodgers. The idea of benching the future Hall of Famer sounded so absurd that one coach asked whether the owner was serious — multiple sources from that meeting believed he was. Johnson was calmed that day, but that set the tone for what happened a week later. On Oct. 8, Johnson made the decision to fire Saleh without consulting his general manager (or anyone else in the organization, for that matter).

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Sparks hire Lynne Roberts as coach: Why she's a good fit for Los Angeles,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5933916/2024/11/19/lynne-roberts-hired-sparks/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 01:51:00 GMT",Roberts joins the Sparks after nearly 20 years as a Division I coach and recently guided Utah to three consecutive NCAA Tournament trips.,"WNBA The Los Angeles Sparks hired Lynne Roberts to be the 16th coach in franchise history, the team announced Tuesday. Roberts joins the Sparks after nearly 20 years as a Division I coach, the last nine coming at Utah where she won Pac-12 Coach of the Year in 2023 and guided the Utes to three consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances. Advertisement “First and foremost, Lynne’s leadership and integrity stand out,” Sparks general manager Raegan Pebley said in a statement. “Her ability to partner with players while creating a winning culture will translate as we continue our path toward championship contention. Lynne has a dynamic and forward-thinking offensive mind, and her up-tempo style fits perfectly with the way we want to play.” Roberts is the second NCAA coach to jump to the WNBA during this hiring cycle, following Karl Smesko of Florida Gulf Coast, who the Atlanta Dream introduced earlier Tuesday. The Sparks and the Dream enlisted search firms — L.A. went with TurnkeyZRG and Atlanta used Korn Ferry — to find their coaches, and the processes produced similar outcomes. Lynne Roberts named head coach of the LA Sparks. https://t.co/ZIRgZSNI9l pic.twitter.com/l9RjAsARpS — Los Angeles Sparks (@LASparks) November 20, 2024  Roberts was well-regarded for her offensive imagination as the Utes coach. Her team ranked second in Division I in offensive rating over the last three seasons, third in effective field-goal percentage and fifth in total made 3-pointers. In The Athletic’s anonymous coaches poll, Roberts’ peers selected her as one of the best offensive game planners and a coach they didn’t want to face in the NCAA Tournament. Unleashing the talents of the unconventional Alissa Pili became Roberts’ most high-profile accomplishment. Pili, an undersized forward, had been one of the most inefficient scorers in the country but became a bonafide offensive superstar after transferring to Utah. The Utes earned a share of the Pac-12 title in 2023 when they were one possession away from beating eventual national champion LSU in the NCAA Tournament’s Sweet 16. Pili earned Pac-12 Player of the Year honors in 2023 and became a first-round WNBA draft pick in 2024. Advertisement Roberts has spent her entire career on the West Coast. A California native, she coached at Pacific and Chico State before making her way to Utah and is a natural fit for one of the WNBA’s oldest franchises. Her move to the league comes at a transition period for Utah, which joined the Big 12 in 2024-25 after the collapse of the Pac-12. “I am honored to be named the next head coach of the Los Angeles Sparks,” Roberts said. “I want to thank our ownership group for this incredible opportunity. … The Sparks have a talented roster with tremendous upside, and we will compete tirelessly for WNBA championships. “I believe Los Angeles should be the premier market in the WNBA, and I’m eager to partner with our players and front office to make this happen.” The Sparks return a roster with many talented young players, including the No. 2 and No. 4 picks in the 2024 draft, Cameron Brink and Rickea Jackson, plus the second pick in the upcoming 2025 draft. They do not own the rights to their 2026 first-round pick and have missed the playoffs for four consecutive seasons, making it imperative for Roberts to lead a competitive team immediately. Roberts is the fifth coach to be hired this offseason, joining Natalie Nakase in Golden State, Stephanie White in Indiana, Tyler Marsh in Chicago and Smesko. Openings remain in Washington, Connecticut and Dallas, where the Wings just won the lottery for the 2025 No. 1 pick. (Photo: Darren Yamashita / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Rays may not get new stadium in 2028, or at all, after vote to approve bonds postponed again",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5933821/2024/11/19/rays-new-stadium-bonds-vote-delayed/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 01:25:12 GMT",The significant uncertainty has led to questions about the Rays leaving St. Petersburg and the Tampa Bay region following the 2025 season.,"MLB The Tampa Bay Rays’ plans to build a new stadium in St. Petersburg, Fla., took another hit Tuesday. The Pinellas County Board of Commissions decided to postpone a vote to approve bonds that would finance the ballpark’s construction. It is the second time the county commissioners have postponed a vote on financing, a decision that the Rays said will at the very least postpone construction of the ballpark by a year, and possibly kill the deal entirely. The new vote is now scheduled for Dec. 17. Advertisement Many of the commissioners expressed frustration regarding comments made by Rays owner Stu Sternberg to the Tampa Bay Times in an article published on Saturday. “Last month, the County Commission upended our ballpark agreement by not approving their bonds, as they promised to do,” Sternberg told the paper regarding the initial delay. “That action sent a clear message that we had lost the county as a partner. “The future of baseball in Tampa Bay became less certain after that vote.” The Rays and Pinellas County initially agreed to a deal in July that would eventually lead to the groundbreaking on a new stadium in St. Petersburg’s Gas Plant District. The plan was for the Rays to move into their new home in 2028. The Rays now say this won’t be possible. This issue comes against the backdrop of the Rays being forced out of Tropicana Field due to significant damage from Hurricane Milton that made the venue unplayable. A damage assessment report released last week estimated that it would cost more than $55.7 million to repair, and wouldn’t be completed until just before the 2026 season. The Rays’ lease at the Trop expires after the 2027 season. The significant uncertainty has led to questions about the Rays leaving St. Petersburg and the Tampa Bay region following the 2025 season, where they’ll play home games at Steinbrenner Field in Tampa — the spring training home of the New York Yankees. Given the high costs to repair Tropicana Field and uncertainty over a long-term stadium deal, it remains unclear what their future looks like in the region.   “To be clear, we did not vote to kill the deal, nor should a three-week delay in a 30-plus year commitment be a deal-killer to begin with,” said Brian Scott, the board’s vice chair, during the hearing. “That’s just a totally ridiculous statement. Advertisement “The delay was not because of a lack of support for the Rays or our partnership. But it was a necessary due diligence to ensure the best interest of our residents and our taxpayers were met.” Scott said he recently asked Rays president Brian Auld to make a public statement affirming the team’s commitment to remain in Pinellas County. Instead, Scott said, Auld told him he was doing everything he could to hold the deal together amid projects and cost estimates going in “the wrong direction.” Scott, who indicated he still supports approving the bonds, said he believes it’s possible the Rays are looking for a way out of the deal, and to hang that failure on the newest members, who were sworn in on Monday. Both new members, Chris Scherer and Vince Nowicki, have shown skepticism for the deal, which was negotiated before their election. They voted for the delay, as did fellow commissioner Dave Eggers, who started off his comments by saying, “I am not going to feel rushed by statements that were made by the Rays.” Auld and fellow team president Matt Silverman were in attendance but indicated in a letter to the board ahead of the meeting that they would not be taking questions. In the letter, they said the initial vote on bonds was believed to be “a formality” and a necessity in order to remain on schedule for 2028. “As we have informed the county administrator and St. Petersburg mayor Ken Welch, the county’s failure to finalize the bonds last month ended the ability for a 2028 delivery of the ballpark,” the letter said. “The Rays organization is saddened and stunned by this unfortunate turn of events. … Now, the enormous investment of human and financial capital has been jeopardized by the county’s failure to live up to its July agreement.” The Rays declined to comment following Tuesday’s meeting.

We haven’t had those discussions. So somebody, I think, floated something on a slow news day. Advertisement Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman first discussed “conversations” surrounding the cap potentially reaching $95 or $97 million on Hockey Night in Canada this past weekend, thanks to “strong” revenues since the league emerged COVID-19 pandemic. According to The Athletic’s Pierre LeBrun, the NHLPA is actively speaking to players about the next collective bargaining agreement — the current one is set to expire in September 2026 — and the possibility that the salary cap will rise significantly. The 2025-26 salary cap is estimated at $92.5 million, but Bettman said that figure was “way preliminary” in October. The NHL’s current salary cap is $88 million. “It’s really too early for that to be a story,” Bettman said in October. Bettman met with Senators’ owner Michael Andlauer and the Ottawa Board of Trade, as well as Ottawa mayor Mark Sutcliffe during his time in the Canadian nation’s capital before attending the Oilers-Senators game at the Canadian Tire Centre. The NHL commissioner also visited the LeBreton Flats grounds, the site of the Senators’ next arena, with members of the National Capital Commission. The Senators and the NCC reached an agreement in September to build a replacement venue for the Canadian Tire Centre. “I know Michael Andlauer is committed to doing the right things and doing this in a way that people will feel good about,” Bettman said. “In the final analysis, I think moving the team downtown will be great for fans.” (Top photo of Gary Bettman: Chris Tanouye / Freestyle Photography / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The Bulldogs jumped to No. 10 after defeating Tennessee on Saturday, knocking the Volunteers back to No. 11 and making them the first team out of the bracket. Advertisement The third CFP rankings — only two more to go before the ones that matter on Dec. 8 — featured an unchanged top-five, dominated by four Big Ten teams: No. 1 Oregon, No. 2 Ohio State, No. 3 Texas, No. 4 Penn State and No. 5 Indiana. The Buckeyes (9-1) host the unbeaten Hoosiers on Saturday in their third top-five matchup this season. Ohio State split road games against Oregon (11-0) and Penn State (9-1) earlier this year. Notre Dame moved up to No. 6, followed by Alabama, Miami and Ole Miss at No. 9. The Hurricanes are the highest-ranked ACC team, in position to receive a bye if they can win the conference. Losses by BYU and Tennessee cleared the way for changes after that. The Cougars’ first loss of the season, at home against Kansas, dropped them eight spots to No. 14 behind No. 13 SMU from the ACC. The Cougars beat the Mustangs in September in Dallas. Committee chairman and Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel said BYU’s comeback wins over Oklahoma State and Utah, both teams with losing records, in recent weeks also played a part in the Cougars’ precipitous drop. “It was just something the committee had been monitoring all along,” Manuel said. “Look, we give a lot of credit when teams win and so we don’t penalize teams for winning close … or winning too big. But we do value wins, and so that’s where we saw BYU. “But given some of those games that they played and the close wins that they had, it just was an indicator that some of the teams that were below them in the rankings last week should move ahead of them is how the committee assessed it.” BYU is still the highest-ranked Big 12 team and projected into the field as one of the five highest-ranked conference champions, but not high enough to receive one of the four first-round byes. That goes to Boise State, who is projected to be the Mountain West champion. It’s going to be tough. The Big 12 has four ranked teams, including No. 16 Colorado, No. 21 Arizona State and No. 22 Iowa State. BYU and the newly ranked Sun Devils play Saturday in Tempe, giving the winner an opportunity for a victory against a ranked team. None of those other teams face each other over the last two weeks of the regular season, but it does set up the possibility for a Big 12 Championship Game matching top-20 teams. Advertisement Boise State (9-1) could get another game against a ranked team in its conference championship game — if No. 24 UNLV (8-2) can get into that game. Currently, Colorado State is second in the Mountain West standings. Boise State beat UNLV in Las Vegas earlier this season. The Broncos and Heisman Trophy contender Ashton Jeanty also have a last-second loss against Oregon on their resume.  Last week, Kansas changed the dynamics of the Playoff race and probably eliminated the possibility of the Big 12 getting an at-large bid. The Jayhawks have a chance to play spoiler again this week when they host Colorado at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City. Three top teams are favored on the road by 10 to 14 points, according to BetMGM. Penn State is an 11.5-point favorite at Minnesota; Alabama is favored by 13.5 at Oklahoma; and Ole Miss is a 10-point favorite at suddenly dangerous Florida. This week, No. 19 Army gets its big chance against Notre Dame at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. The Cadets (9-0) are already locked into the American Athletic Conference Championship Game against No. 20 Tulane. But if the Army will have a real chance to become one of the five highest-ranked conference champions with one of the weakest schedules in the country, it will need to beat the Fighting Irish. Notre Dame has won eight straight games since being upset by Northern Illinois, including a 51-14 victory over Navy last month that ended the Midshipmen’s unbeaten run.

An amateur boxer, a college football player, a minor-league pitcher and a small-school coach who went on to lead an elite college program at Arizona State. Now 65, Murphy on Tuesday was named the National League’s Manager of the Year after his first full season at the helm of a major-league club. Advertisement Murphy received 27 of 30 first-place votes from members of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America to finish with 144 points, ahead of Mike Shildt of the San Diego Padres (70 points, one first-place vote) and New York Mets manager Carlos Mendoza (35 points, one first-place vote). Murphy is the first manager in Milwaukee Brewers history to become the BBWAA’s Manager of the Year, an award established in 1983. Murphy’s baseball journey went from dominance at Arizona State to a winding path through the minor leagues, managing short-season A-ball in 2011 and eventually becoming interim manager of the San Diego Padres by 2015. Murphy did not get that Padres job and instead headed to Milwaukee, where he became the bench coach under Craig Counsell, who played for Murphy at Notre Dame. “The eight years I was an assistant or a bench coach, those eight years taught me a lot because I really focused on trying to be the assistant or the bench coach that I would want,” Murphy said Tuesday night. “I wasn’t great at it. I used to tell Couns all the time: ‘How can I help you more, man? What do I do? Where do I fit? I kind of don’t know this job. I get bored with some of the nonsense that anybody can do. I want to be around people. I want to help people.’” ""From the ownership, to the front office, to the coaching staff they all made me look good, but nobody more than the players."" 2024 NL Manager of the Year Pat Murphy credits the @Brewers organization while accepting the award. pic.twitter.com/xI3Ei21P7N — MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) November 20, 2024  After Counsell departed for a lucrative deal with the Chicago Cubs in November 2023, Murphy emerged as the top candidate to take over the Brewers. For all he learned as a bench coach, Murphy immediately felt at home in the manager’s chair after 27 years as a college head coach. “Honestly, it did feel natural,” Murphy said. “It did.” Advertisement Murphy inherited a team with a reputation for punching above its weight in baseball’s smallest media market. Despite having traded ace Corbin Burnes and cut team payroll, the Brewers overachieved as much as ever under Murphy’s guidance. With a stern jaw and a demeanor that can be intense, encouraging, hilarious and inspiring all at once, Murphy helped guide a young team toward 93 wins and a division title. “I just didn’t want to let the Brewers down, from the ownership to the front office to the players, the coaching staff,” Murphy said. “I didn’t want to let them down. I wanted to be prepared. I wanted to be sure I did something to advance the needle a little bit and infuse something that might make an impact.” The Brewers won the National League Central by a wide margin despite various injuries to key players such as Brandon Woodruff, Devin Williams and Christian Yelich. Catcher William Contreras, shortstop Willy Adames and rookie outfielder Jackson Chourio had superb seasons, but what Murphy’s Brewers otherwise lacked in name recognition they made up for in scrappiness. Observers noted the way the Brewers seemed to take on Murphy’s hard-nosed personality. Even while leading a big-time program at Arizona State, Murphy has always had a soft spot for underdogs. “I coached Dustin Pedroia for three years,” Murphy said. “How do I know if I impacted him? People think I did because he was an underdog and he was a little guy without a lot of physical stuff to him, and all of a sudden his belief system took him to a new level. And then when he got to the big leagues, it didn’t stop. But did I impact him? Now, he’s gonna say I did, and we ended up having a close relationship, but you can’t measure that stuff. “That’s the beauty of what we do compared to other parts of baseball (where) you can quantify everything. … The beauty of coaching is you don’t really know the impact you had. You just keep going.” Advertisement Milwaukee’s relievers covered the third-most innings of any National League club and posted an NL-best 3.11 ERA. In the field, only the Los Angeles Dodgers had more team defensive runs saved. On the basepaths, the Brewers finished second in stolen bases and ranked near the top in a plethora of base-running metrics. Murphy deflected when asked how he saw his fingerprints on this year’s Brewers squad. “I just don’t view it that way,” he said. Then he cracked a signature joke. “I think I added to the dress code on the plane,” Murphy said. “I made it a little more relaxed.” The Brewers’ unlikely run ended with a crushing loss to the New York Mets in the NL Wild Card Series, but Milwaukee nonetheless staged a remarkable season in Murphy’s first year as a full-time manager. Long before the votes (due ahead of the playoffs) were cast, Murphy stood alone as a clear favorite to win an award he has worked toward his entire life. “I don’t really know where my fingerprints were or whatever,” Murphy said. “I just know those young, hungry players got after it.” (Photo: Scott Taetsch / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Guardians’ Stephen Vogt wins AL Manager of the Year in first season,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5930941/2024/11/19/guardians-stephen-vogt-al-manager-of-the-year/,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024 23:29:00 GMT","Vogt, who had never managed at any level, is the fastest former player to win the Manager of the Year award.","MLB In an MLB awards season with little intrigue, the American League Manager of the Year race offered a rarity: Three finalists with compelling arguments to win. Cleveland Guardians manager Stephen Vogt guided his club to a division title in his first year. Detroit Tigers manager A.J. Hinch authored an impressive comeback story, leading the franchise to the postseason for the first time in 10 years. And all Kansas City Royals manager Matt Quatraro did was take a team that had lost 106 games in 2023 — his first season on the job — back to the playoffs after an eight-year drought. Advertisement In the end, the Baseball Writers’ Association of America revealed on Tuesday it selected Vogt, 40, whose team finished 92-69 and bested the field in an unexpectedly competitive AL Central. Vogt was in his first season in Cleveland since replacing long-time manager Terry Francona, who stepped away after 2023 before signing on to lead the Cincinnati Reds last month. Vogt received 27 of 30 first-place votes on his way to earning 142 points. Quatraro was second with 73 points, including two first-place votes, while Hinch earned 41 points and one first-place vote. The Guardians’ front office did little to raise expectations last offseason following a 76-86 finish in 2023. But Vogt, who finished his 11-year major-league playing career in 2022, guided the team to a scorching start, fostered a positive culture that helped overcome the loss of ace Shane Bieber, and managed the best bullpen in baseball across the course of 2024. Vogt, who had never managed at any level, is the fastest former player to win the Manager of the Year award, surpassing Joe Girardi, who won the award with the Florida Marlins in 2006, just three years after his final major-league season. The last first-year manager to win the award was the Marlins’ Skip Schumaker in 2023. The Milwaukee Brewers’ Pat Murphy, also a first-year skipper, was named NL Manager of the Year later Tuesday. Francona, Vogt’s predecessor, previously won AL Manager of the Year for Cleveland in 2013, 2016 and 2022. As with other BBWAA awards, the voting for AL Manager of the Year takes place before the postseason. But after securing a first-round bye, the Guardians defeated the Tigers in the American League Division Series before losing to the New York Yankees in five games in the AL Championship Series. More than most MLB awards, the Manager of the Year honors often come down to a good narrative. Hinch and Quatraro both had strong cases, too. But Vogt’s argument won out.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Rafael Nadal retires from tennis at Davis Cup after Spain lose to Netherlands,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5933496/2024/11/19/rafael-nadal-retires-tennis-career/,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024 23:10:38 GMT",Nadal won 22 Grand Slam titles in his career and retires as one of the greatest men's tennis players of all time.,"Tennis MALAGA, Spain — Rafael Nadal’s professional tennis career is over, his final match a 6-4, 6-4 defeat to Botic Van de Zandschulp of the Netherlands at the Davis Cup. That defeat, coupled with Carlos Alcaraz and Marcel Granollers losing the doubles rubber 7-6(4), 7-6(3) to Wesley Koolhof and Van de Zandschulp, saw Spain eliminated from the Davis Cup. With that came the end for Nadal, one of the sport’s most successful players of all time, who in October confirmed that he would retire at the event. Advertisement Nadal had flashes of his old self during the loss to Van de Zandschulp, but they were all too brief. A couple of aces in crucial moments. A snapped backhand overhead. A scampering chase after a lob that he got back with a spinning overhead while running away from the net. Ultimately his game proved too meek to survive a powerful, modern player like Van de Zandschulp. Strokes that once would have pelted balls through the court ended up short, allowing the Dutchman to take the initiative off Nadal’s racket. With Nadal out it was left to Carlos Alcaraz to save him and to save Spain. Alcaraz got halfway there, winning his singles match, but then he and Granollers fell to Van de Zandschulp and Koolhof in straight sets as Nadal sat with his teammates courtside, urging Granollers and Alcaraz on. He stood and pumped his fists two at a time, trying to get them to hang in and give him one more chance at the court. The match came down to two tiebreaks. Koolhof and Van de Zandschulp played some their best tennis when it counted most, with the weight of saving Nadal’s career for another few days pressing down on the Spaniards. The Dutch took the first tiebreak 7-4. In the second, Van de Zandschulp turned it on with a lunging stab of a volley that nicked the outside of the sideline and a blazing passing shot that sent the Dutch on to the win. Koolhof, 35, is also retiring here. He was not ready to go. He sank to his knees with joy. Nadal stood and folded his arms. The end had come. Rafael Nadal retires from tennis When it was over, he tried to address the crowd in Spanish. The “Rafa, Rafa, Rafa” chant that has followed him around the world drowned him out. Then they let their hero speak. “I have felt super fortunate to receive so much,” he said. “It has been an incredible privilege, an honor that we have enjoyed. We achieved so many things,” he said, addressing members of Spain’s tennis team past and present. Alcaraz looked crestfallen on the sidelines. Advertisement “Nobody ever wants to arrive at this moment — I am not tired of playing tennis,” Nadal said. “My body has arrived at a place where it cannot play anymore. I feel privileged to have extended my career longer than I expected. Thanks to life and to my team,” he added. Video tributes came in from legends and rivals: Serena Williams, Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Conchita Martinez, Juan Martin del Potro. Spanish sporting royalty, including Ballon d’Or holder Rodri, former Spain captain and goalkeeper Iker Casillas and striker Raul, and golfer Sergio Garcia lent their voices. David Beckham addressed Nadal – in Spanish. “I have tried to achieve my goals with respect, humility and appreciation for the good things I have experienced. I have tried to be a good person and I hope you have felt that. I leave the world of professional tennis having found many friends,” Nadal said. Later, Alcaraz offered his own tribute on X, also in Spanish. “There will be many more Davis Cups. There is only one Rafa. “I have become a professional tennis player thanks to you. It has been a blessing to live through your career, as a child for whom you were an idol and then as a teammate! The best possible ambassador, who leaves an eternal legacy,” he wrote. It is an end that has been coming for two years, with Nadal struggling for form and fitness since his last Grand Slam title at the 2022 French Open. He retires with 22 Grand Slam titles, second only to Djokovic in men’s tennis history with 24. He also won two Olympic gold medals — one in singles and one in doubles — and four Davis Cups, with a final total of 92 career singles titles. Now 38, Nadal made his debut in professional tennis in 2001 at a Futures event, which is the third rung of the ATP tour. He started playing Challengers (a rung up but still one below the main ATP Tour) towards the end of 2002, and then made his main tour and Grand Slam debut the following year, reaching the Wimbledon third round. Advertisement Two years later he won his maiden Grand Slam at the French Open, the first of 14 titles at an event where he retires with a record of played 116, won 112, lost four. He won four French Opens in a row between 2005 and 2008, and after that fourth title he won his first non-clay major a few weeks later by beating Roger Federer at Wimbledon in a classic of the 2000s. GO DEEPER What's it like to play Rafael Nadal on clay? We asked the players Nadal won his first Australian Open in January 2009, but that year he also suffered his first-ever defeat at Roland Garros, to Robin Soderling in the fourth round. He responded by winning five more French Opens in a row between 2010 and 2014 and completing the “career Grand Slam” at 24 by winning the 2010 U.S. Open. Injuries and a crisis of confidence saw him endure two barren years in 2015 and 2016, but with new coach Carlos Moya in tow he rebounded to win a 10th French Open and third U.S. Open in 2017. That “La Decima” title in Paris began another run of four straight Roland Garros titles, between 2017 and 2020, the last of which was a straight-sets battering of Djokovic, so often his bete noire. In 2022 he moved ahead of Federer in the men’s Grand Slams leaderboard by winning a 21st and 22nd major at the Australian and French Opens, with that 14th title in Paris proved to be his final Grand Slam. Though best known for a ferocious and indomitable will to win, Nadal was also one of the great shotmakers in tennis history and perhaps the most complete baseliner the sport has ever seen alongside Djokovic, propelled by his ripped forehand with so much topspin that it kicked high off the court and bamboozled opponents. His rivalries with Federer and Djokovic, who came to be known as the ‘Big Three,’ created some of the most memorable and high-quality matches in tennis history, each pushing the other to greater heights and creating three of the greatest players in the history of men’s tennis in the process. Two of them have now bowed out. (Top photo: Oscar J. Barroso / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Advertisement The most-watched NFL regular season game of 2024. Buffalo’s 30-21 win over the previously undefeated Chiefs game averaged a whopping 31.2 million viewers for CBS, per the NFL. That tops the previous high for the season — Kansas City’s 27-20 over Baltimore for the NFL Kickoff which averaged 28.9 million viewers on NBC and Peacock. The NFL said the Bills-Chiefs game was the fourth most-watched national window on record (dating back to 1988) and ranks among the 10 most-watched NFL games on record in any window excluding Thanksgiving. Per Austin Karp of Sports Business Journal, who first reported the viewership number: If you exclude Thanksgiving and Christmas Day games, the Bills-Chiefs was the NFL’s most-watched regular season game since CBS’ Pats-Colts Week 9 in 2007 (33.8 million). As noted by The Athletic last May, when the NFL schedule was released, CBS Sports president David Berson said that his company wanted to maximize the big AFC brands, and the Kansas City Chiefs were a major priority. The game he wanted above all was Sunday’s epic matchup in Buffalo. The company invested resources to build momentum including sending its pregame show, The NFL Today, on the road for the first time this season. As far as upcoming Chiefs games regarding viewership to keep an eye on as the season progresses, Kansas City will face Pittsburgh on Christmas Day in a game that will air on Netflix, the streamer’s first-ever NFL broadcast.

Cooper Rush threw for 354 yards but the Cowboys' only touchdown came on a 64-yard KaVontae Turpin catch-and-run early in the second quarter.  The Texans recorded their first defensive touchdown of the season as Derek Barnett had a 28-yard scoop-and-score early in the fourth quarter that put the game out of reach.  Houston improved to 7-4 while Dallas lost its fifth straight to fall to 3-7.  GO FURTHER Cowboys’ spiral continues with loss to Texans as Dallas remains winless at home: Key takeaways In his postgame news conference, Texans coach DeMeco Ryans praised his team's level of play. ""When we stay focused we can play with anyone in the league,"" Ryans said. The Texans coach also commended Joe Mixon's performance, calling him ""a force"" for the team. ""The run game starts with our offensive line,"" Ryans said. ""I challenged them to play fast, play aggressive. Thought they did a really nice job."" Advertisement In his postgame scrum, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones spoke candidly about the state of his team after yet another loss. ""We're just not playing well enough,"" Jones said.  Getty Images After the game, Dallas Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy said he wished he put quarterback Trey Lance in the contest at the end.  ""The one thing I should've did at the end and I didn't do is put Trey in there,"" McCarthy said. ""Could've gotten him a series."" Getty Images The Texans defense was mostly as advertised, limiting the Cowboys’ offense for much of the game. The Cowboys’ offense did put together a few decent drives they don’t have anything to show for, courtesy of a rare Brandon Aubrey miss from 40 yards and a failed red zone attempt on a fourth-and-2 incompletion, but Houston’s defense deserves a lot of credit, too. Even though Houston seemed hellbent on playing with its food, the defense finally rose up and slammed the door shut on the Cowboys in the fourth quarter when the Texans strip-sacked Rush and ultimately forced Tyler Guyton to fumble on the same play and returned it for a touchdown. Throughout the evening, the Texans had their fair share of dropped interceptions, none more glaring than a few plays prior to the Cowboys’ failed fourth-and-2 attempt in the third quarter. The fourth quarter was the best indicator of what the Texans’ defense can be when they’re actually playing their best, and that version of them didn’t let the Cowboys even get a false sense of confidence. Getty Images The Cowboys’ offense was much improved over their horrible showing last week against the Eagles, but they ultimately could not do enough to win the game. The much maligned defense had a horrid start to the game but tightened things up quickly after giving up two touchdowns to Mixon in the first quarter. Over the next two quarters, the defense only allowed two field goals to the Texans for a total of 20 points heading into the fourth quarter. Multiple times, the defense did its job and gave the ball to the offense with a chance to tie the game or close it down to a one-possession game. But the offense never responded. The offense couldn’t finish when the Cowboys needed it most on fourth-and-2 in the third quarter on the doorstep and then fell flat for the entire fourth quarter. Rush improved off his previous performance but had another fumbled snap from the shotgun and a handful of interceptable balls that could have made things look even worse. Getty Images Playing in his first game since Week 5 after recovering from a hamstring injury, star wide receiver Nico Collins made four receptions on seven targets for 54 yards tonight.  That doesn't tell the whole story though, as Collins would have had a 77-yard touchdown catch on the game's first play from scrimmage if it weren't for a ineligible man downfield penalty on Laremy Tunsil.  Advertisement According to Next Gen Stats, Danielle Hunter generated 10 pressures and two sacks on 46 pass rushes tonight, with nine of his pressures coming against right tackle Terence Steele. Hunter currently leads the NFL with 72 pressures, 15 more than the next closest player in Trey Hendrickson.  Getty Images Our discussion page is overflowing with schadenfreude...   Anonymous: America’s team. Feels about right. Brian A.: Houston scores again. The nation cheers. Edward D.: I almost feel sorry for Dallas fans and players, but never for Jerry Jones. Grant H.: Texans did what was needed, still major improvement needed but a win is all that matters. Hope Jerry Jones is having a lovely evening.

GO FURTHER NFL playoff projections 2024: The Athletic’s model predicts the field Getty Images Per The Athletic's Austin Mock, the Cowboys are projected to finish the season 6-11.  Dallas is projected to have a -8.0 expected points per game (16.5 points for, 24.5 points against). The Texans defense brought this one home and the offense finally getting its first second-half touchdown in nearly five games probably brings a sigh of relief. Joe Mixon was the star of the night for Houston with another 100-yard rushing performance and three TDs. Nico Collins showed enough in his return to help the Texans feel like they can return to being a more consistent offense. Advertisement Getty Images Houston needed a win point blank and they got that against a struggling Cowboys team. The Texans have a chance to tighten their grip on the AFC South with games against the Titans and Jaguars next. Questions will remain about where they stand among the AFC's best teams, but they shouldn't feel bad about being back in the win column after a few tough weeks. The Houston Texans host the Tennessee Titans on Nov. 24. During Thanksgiving weekend, the Texans will travel to Jacksonville to take on the Jaguars Dec. 1.  The Dallas Cowboys have a short week.

You can point to rookie left tackle Tyler Guyton trying to run after recovering a fumble instead of just going to the ground. But it’s almost never been just one thing in the Cowboys’ losses this season. They’re just a bad team. They don’t put themselves in a position where a play here or a play there is the difference.  The result tonight is actually in the best interest for the franchise. There’s no reason to win any more games. This season is done. Get the best possible draft pick.  Getty Images C.J. Stroud was obviously the most talented quarterback on the field tonight. But that isn’t saying much. AT&T Stadium has been a comfortable place for opposing quarterbacks this season. Saints QB Derek Carr posted a 125.0 passer rating in their win. Ravens QB Lamar Jackson’s was 139.4. Lions QB Jared Goff’s was 153.8. Eagles QB Jalen Hurts’ was 115.0.

Houston will clearly take the win any way it can get it, but Stroud didn’t have the type of game I was expecting against this Cowboys defense, especially with top wide receiver Nico Collins back in the lineup."

The Minnesota Vikings did it to them in Week 2, the Kansas City Chiefs edged them in Week 7, and the Seattle Seahawks outgained them 289 yards to 277 on Sunday. That output also was a season low for San Francisco, 33 fewer yards than it gained in the loss to the Chiefs. One drive in the second quarter was a microcosm of the game. The 49ers ran 11 plays and held the ball for seven minutes. But they also were docked 19 yards on penalties and gained just 26 yards before punting. The offense ran 63 plays versus 60 for the defense. Read here on how the individual snaps were divided. Quarterback: Brock Purdy 63 Purdy has had only two starts with fewer passing yards than the 159 he ended up with Sunday. He had 125 in a Week 6 loss to the Cleveland Browns last season. And he had 23 yards when he was injured early in the 2022 NFC Championship Game in Philadelphia. The storyline against the Seahawks’ bend-but-don’t-break defense was the lack of explosion on offense. Purdy didn’t attempt any passes beyond 20 yards and only six from 10 to 19 yards. The bulk of his pass attempts, 19 targets, were less than 10 yards. Coach Kyle Shanahan on Monday said Purdy emerged from the game with soreness in his right shoulder from a hit he took. Purdy ran five times for 40 yards against the Seahawks.

Crucial AFC matchups bookend the week. Thursday kicks off with a potential “trap” game with a clear favorite in a division rivalry, and Monday ends the week with a matchup between the fifth- and sixth-place teams in the AFC.

Let’s start with Thursday Night Football. The 8-2 Steelers are favored by barely over a field goal against the 2-8 Cleveland Browns, though the line has been inching up. The Steelers are coming off a bellwether victory over the Baltimore Ravens, putting them third in the AFC behind the Kansas City Chiefs and Buffalo Bills. The Browns, meanwhile, got trounced by the 4-7, though recently improving, New Orleans Saints. The game could be a defensive slugfest, and all bets are off (figuratively) in a divisional matchup like this. After all, the Browns did hand the Ravens another one of their four losses.

It’s more about how the Cowboys have played at AT&T Stadium over the last 11 months. Not only have they lost every game, they haven’t been close. Dallas’ Saturday injury report had 19 names on it. Meanwhile, Texans star wide receiver Nico Collins is expected back after missing the last five games with a hamstring injury. The 2021 third-round pick had a breakout year last season, catching 80 passes for 1,297 yards and eight touchdowns. His return will likely be a major issue for a banged-up Dallas secondary. Texans 35, Cowboys 17. Saad Yousuf, Cowboys beat writer: Last week, the Eagles didn’t really blow me away with the season they were having so I expected the Cowboys to be able to keep up but eventually fall short. I was sort of right, as the Cowboys kept it interesting for 30 minutes before the game turned into a blowout in the second half. I have similar feelings about the Texans. I believe they are a quality team, destined for the playoffs, but I don’t think they are elite. I think this will be a game in which Micah Parsons and DeMarvion Overshown will stand out in a big way. With that being said, the Cowboys are not even a quality team so I don’t think the end result will be unexpected. Texans 24, Cowboys 12. GO FURTHER  (Getty Images)             OWINGS MILLS, Md. — A day after Justin Tucker missed two field-goal attempts in a two-point loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ravens coach John Harbaugh expressed confidence in his kicker and dismissed the possibility of bringing in competition at the position. “There’s no thought to that,” Harbaugh said when asked if the team was considering auditioning free agent kickers to potentially replace Tucker. “The best option right now is to get Justin back on point, because he’s fully capable of doing it. I certainly haven’t lost any confidence in Justin Tucker. You saw that on the 54-yarder we sent him out for, and he drilled it. That’s the Justin Tucker that he wants to see and we all want to see on every kick."" Tucker missed 47 and 50-yard field goals attempts in the first half of the Ravens' 18-16 loss to the Steelers at Acrisure Stadium. The misses leave him 16-of-22 on field-goal attempts this season. He's also missed an extra-point try. His six misses through 11 games are already more than he's had in 10 of his 12 previous NFL seasons. Tucker said after Sunday's game that he hasn't lost his confidence, but his misses have hurt the Ravens in a few close losses. ""He’s going to make a lot of kicks. I really believe that,"" Harbaugh said. ""But it’s up to him and the guys he works with every day to make those balls go straight. Competition right now, at this time, no, that’s not something we want for Justin. We’ve just got to compete to get better and make those kicks.” Tucker, 34, is a seven-time Pro Bowl selection. Before Sunday's misses, he had been the most accurate kicker in NFL history. However, his 89.348 percent success rate now puts him behind Eddy Pineiro (89.381 percent). GO FURTHER Normally ‘automatic’ kickers like Justin Tucker, Younghoe Koo are struggling in 2024 ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. — The Buffalo Bills planned to throw it. “But I’m kind of anxious,” receiver Amari Cooper said. “It’s fourth-and-2!” You can forgive Cooper. He’s still pretty new here. He hasn’t fully absorbed the Josh Allen Experience. Allen soon would vaporize any tension and leave nothing but euphoria in Highmark Stadium, chants of “M-V-P!” booming into the Sunday night sky. “Some guys are just made to play ball in the position that they play,” Cooper said later at his locker stall, “and he’s definitely one of those guys.” The Bills insisted all week and in the immediate afterglow of their 30-21 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs that Sunday merely was one of 17 games, no more important than, say, beating the Tennessee Titans a month ago. But the showdown absolutely meant more. The two-time defending Super Bowl champs were undefeated, and although the Bills are correct to downplay a regular-season result — win or lose — as relatively insignificant in the master design to win the franchise’s first Lombardi Trophy, games and moments such as these achieve gravitas. Allen established himself as the NFL’s no-doubt best player Sunday. On a day when the league’s three active MVPs looked pedestrian by their standards and a couple of new candidates also stumbled, Allen flourished against a formidable defense and delivered a signature play in a career stuffed with highlights. “He’s played close to 100 games, and it seems like he does it every game,” Bills tight end Dawson Knox said. (The number actually is 104 in the regular season, 114 counting playoffs.) “It still never gets old. “It’s weird. You get to the point where you kind of expect it.” Read more from Sunday here. GO FURTHER Josh Allen emerges as MVP favorite following signature play in win over Chiefs (Getty Images)             While Josh Allen will get much of the applause for the game, and rightfully so, the defense deserves a heaping amount of praise for their efforts. Above all else, for the first time since Mahomes became the Chiefs’ full-time starting quarterback, the Bills shut down his favorite target like they never have before. Tight end Travis Kelce, who has long been a Bills antagonist for how well he’s played in these matchups, was held shockingly silent. Kelce caught only two passes for eight yards. In the seven games Mahomes and Kelce have been paired up against the Bills, Kelce has not had a game in which he gained fewer than 57 yards. His totals over those seven games, 51 receptions for 602 yards and eight touchdowns, would be among the most prolific tight end seasons in Bills history. That’s an average of seven catches for 86 yards. Over Kelce’s last three games this season, he’s caught 32 receptions for 254 yards. His average yardage per reception over those three games (7.93) was just a shade under how many total yards the Bills allowed to Kelce on Sunday. Over the years, the Bills have tried a little bit of everything. They’ve tried to bracket him in zone coverage. They’ve also tried to assign him a similarly sized defender on obvious passing downs to neutralize, but nothing worked. But the big question is, how, after all these years and matchups, did they finally slow Kelce down? It came down to heavy attention and switching things up from their usual operating procedure on defense. “Wherever he was at, that’s where we wanted to have our eyes at,” nickel corner Taron Johnson said after the game. “Even if it’s zone and stuff, we even play our zones a little different when he’s in the game because of how smart he is as a player.” Mahomes perpetually has his eyes looking for Kelce when he needs a play, and both players seem like they share a brain to find the soft spot in coverage. Kelce comes off the field more often than he has in previous seasons, which gave the Bills a chance to reset their scheme each time he was on the sidelines and resharpen once he trotted back into the game. But the Bills took him away like they never have before, which led to Mahomes looking elsewhere all game. “If we’re in zone, just heavy awareness where he is — kind of flood that area, type of deal,” said defensive back Cam Lewis, who subbed in on defense for every third down. It worked, and it helped take Kelce away early, forcing Mahomes to go elsewhere outside of a pair of dump-down throws. The Bills also went with an atypical approach once they had some good early-game results. “I feel we played a lot of man (coverage), to be honest with you, especially on third downs,” Lewis said. “I feel like we found it working kind of early that we could cover these guys, and our rush was humming tonight, so why not?” The Bills are a heavy zone team and have been so under head coach Sean McDermott for a long time. But with a pass rush getting to Mahomes and limiting his time to create, the Bills defense pounced by taking away Kelce and got themselves off the field more often than not. There were many reasons why the Bills won this big of a game, but limiting Kelce was chief among them. This is likely a much different game and, possibly, a different outcome if Kelce was able to get going. GO FURTHER Plan to shut down Travis Kelce worked, backup OL comes up big: Bills observations John Harbaugh said there is no thought to bringing in kickers/competition for Justin Tucker's job.  ""The best option right now is to get Justin back on point. We certainly haven't lost any confidence in Justin Tucker. He's definitely our best option."" Advertisement The Bills-Chiefs rivalry delivered yet again, with the Bills handing the Chiefs their first loss of the season.  The Ravens-Steelers rivalry delivered, too, and now the Steelers find themselves in command of the AFC North. Robert Mays and Derrik Klassen dig into those games, plus the Broncos statement win over the Falcons, the befuddling 49ers—as well as the broader picture of the NFC West—Anthony Richardson's triumphant return, and a whole lot more on this episode of The Athletic Football Show. Watch here. (Getty Images) Jaguars coach Doug Pederson just told reporters that WR Gabe Davis (knee) will miss the rest of the season. (Getty Images)             In your mind, does the Chiefs’ loss in Buffalo (paired, perhaps, with the Ravens’ loss in Pittsburgh) change the way you view the AFC hierarchy? Our writers discuss. Mike Jones: Things are deliciously intriguing at the top of the AFC. The Chiefs beat the Ravens to start the season, the Ravens thumped the Bills in Week 4, and now the Bills deliver a convincing win over the previously undefeated Chiefs on the same day that the Ravens lose to the Steelers (who will play Kansas City in Week 17 but will not face Buffalo this regular season). What does it tell us? Any of these top teams are capable of beating the other, and this race for the top seed and home-field advantage could come down to the wire. I still have the Chiefs as the top team in the conference — I will not bet against Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid in the postseason. From there, I’ll still go Baltimore as No. 2 despite the tough divisional loss to Pittsburgh — a game it should have won. From there, Buffalo No. 3, edging the Steelers out by a nose. Ted Nguyen: Not really. The Bills won a competitive game at home. The Steelers won a close game in which Justin Tucker missed two field goals. We have to remember there is a certain amount of luck in every game, no matter how good teams are. I’ll get concerned if the Chiefs and Ravens drop another game next week, but losing in competitive games against very good opponents shouldn’t drastically change how we view teams. The Bills do get a bump up in my book, but until they can beat the Chiefs in the playoffs, I still think the Chiefs are the best team in the AFC. The Bills won similar games against the Chiefs in the regular season in 2022 and ’23, and the Chiefs went on to win the Super Bowl. Dan Pompei: The Bills have won six straight, which makes them the hottest team in the AFC, if not the best. Week by week, they have continued to build their case. The Steelers have the second-longest win streak in the AFC with five straight victories, which means they should be in the conversation about the best team in the AFC North. But the Chiefs, despite their loss, still deserve as much respect as any team. Just because they aren’t the 1972 Dolphins doesn’t mean they won’t be in the Super Bowl — or win the Super Bowl again. And as much as any of the contenders, the Chiefs have the potential to get better as the season goes on, as they are expected to have some important players return from injuries. GO FURTHER  Sunday in the NFL was all about AFC contenders bullying each other for position in the conference as the season’s stretch run awaits. The Buffalo Bills showed calm and efficiency while handing Kansas City its first defeat after nine consecutive Chiefs victories to open the season. The Pittsburgh Steelers proved they still have the formula for containing MVP favorite Lamar Jackson. Their 18-16 victory over Jackson’s Baltimore Ravens, enabled partly by two more angst-inducing Justin Tucker missed field goals, lifted the Steelers to 8-2 and third in the AFC. Finally, the Los Angeles Chargers blew a 21-point lead, then survived to beat the Cincinnati Bengals, marking them as a team in transition away from its disappointing past, willed into relevance by new coach Jim Harbaugh. The Pick Six column leads this week with an updated look at the Bills, Chiefs, Steelers, Ravens and Chargers — the five AFC teams with seven or more victories and the best postseason prospects. The full Pick Six menu: GO FURTHER Reassessing AFC contenders: Bills the best? How dangerous are the Steelers? Sando’s Pick Six   Advertisement DENVER — Atlanta Falcons linebacker Kaden Elliss said Sunday evening that he was “pissed off.” Coach Raheem Morris didn’t say it exactly, but it wasn’t hard to figure out. “The whole game was about physicality and effort,” Morris said. “They out-physicaled us. They out-efforted us. Got our butts kicked today.” It was a bitter but accurate summary of the Denver Broncos’ 38-6 win Sunday afternoon at Empower Field at Mile High. The 32-point margin of defeat was Atlanta’s third-worst since 2010. “Pissed off, but we’ll let that fuel us,” Elliss said. “We’ll make that pissed off for greatness. Props to them. We just have to bounce back and stay pissed off.” If the Falcons (6-5) sense that feeling slipping away, they can always rewatch Sunday’s game. Three weeks ago, their biggest worry seemed to be that their defense would prevent them from being a significant threat in the playoffs. Suddenly, the concern is that defense might be a big enough problem to keep the team out of the playoffs entirely. Read more from Sunday. GO FURTHER Falcons’ very bad day in Denver puts their playoff prospects in question (Getty Images)             Daniel Jones took off with nothing but open field in front of him during a 2020 game against the Philadelphia Eagles. The deceptive speed that has made the New York Giants quarterback an effective runner allowed him to increase the distance from pursuing defenders. Then, as Jones neared the goal line for an 88-yard touchdown, he inexplicably stumbled. With a national audience watching on Thursday Night Football, Jones started to lose his footing at Philadelphia’s 30-yard line. He tumbled to the ground and was tackled by an Eagles defender at the 8-yard line, to the disbelief of everyone watching. With Jones’ benching signaling the end of his six-year run as the Giants’ starting quarterback, that play perfectly encapsulated his tenure. A flicker of promise but, ultimately, a disappointing result. The unofficial end of Jones’ reign came Monday when a source confirmed an NFL Network report that Jones is being benched. This move was inevitable after the Giants’ embarrassing 20-17 overtime loss to the Panthers in Germany in Week 10. Jones’ poor play was a major reason the Giants couldn’t score against the NFL’s worst defense. With the 2-8 Giants on their bye week, this was the logical time for a quarterback change to give backup Tommy DeVito — who was chosen over No. 2 QB Drew Lock — time to prepare to take over. The Giants went 3-13 in games started by Jones over the past two seasons, and they rank last in the league in scoring this season. His career record is 24-44-1. Read more here.

Dobbins' late touchdown run","NFL Advertisement The Chargers surrendered a 27-6 lead in the second half but held on to beat the Bengals 34-27 thanks to J.K. Dobbins’ 29-yard rushing touchdown with 18 seconds left.  Justin Herbert dominated the first half and finished the game with 297 passing yards, two touchdown throws and 65 rushing yards. Rookie wide receiver Ladd McConkey pulled in six catches for 123 yards.  Joe Burrow had another massive performance as Cincinnati mounted its comeback, throwing for 356 yards and three touchdowns. Ja'Marr Chase caught two TDs while Tee Higgins recorded 148 receiving yards and a TD.  Crucially for the Bengals, however, Evan McPherson missed two potential go-ahead field goals with the score tied in the final eight minutes. Los Angeles improves to 7-3 with its fourth straight win while Cincinnati drops to 4-7.  GO FURTHER J.K. Dobbins’ late touchdown propels Chargers past Bengals on ‘Sunday Night Football:’ Key takeaways Getty Images Speaking after the loss, Tee Higgins shows his frustration: “Finish. That's the word of the week. Finish the f-----g game.” I’d say word of the season is more precise. Advertisement Getty Images Just when it looked like the Chargers had completely collapsed, the combination of Justin Herbert and Ladd McConkey saved the day.  The rookie wide receiver out of Georgia finished with six catches on nine targets for 123 yards, including two 20+ yard catches on Los Angeles' game-winning touchdown drive.  McConkey's impressive rookie campaign rolls on. He now has 43 catches for 615 yards and four touchdowns.  Getty Images Ja'Marr Chase entered Sunday Night Football as the leading point scorer among wide receivers in fantasy football and he only widened that gap against the Chargers.  He reeled in seven of his 13 targets for 75 yards and two touchdowns but it could have been an even bigger night. On the Bengals' final drive, Burrow narrowly overthrew him for what could have been a long, walk-in touchdown.  On the season, Chase now has 66 receptions, 981 receiving yards, and 12 touchdowns. Getty Images According to Next Gen Stats, Justin Herbert and Joe Burrow both threw two deep touchdown passes tonight (passes of 20-plus air yards), marking the first time opposing quarterbacks have each thrown multiple deep TD passes in a game this season, and only the fifth time since 2016.  This season is beating down Joe Burrow. Every one of these news conferences looks harder to stomach than the previous. Getty Images Speaking after the Bengals' loss, Joe Burrow says two misses of his are bothering him, specifically failing to connect with Ja'Marr Chase on the go and on the slant late.  Throws he says he normally makes. “Got to make those plays,"" he said.  Advertisement Getty Images A year of redemption continues for Chargers running back J.K. Dobbins. In tonight's victory, he rushed for 56 yards and two touchdowns, including the 29-yard game winner. This season Dobbins has 670 rushing yards and six touchdowns after missing a majority of the last two seasons with serious, season-ending injuries. Getty Images Eli C.: What in the world has happened McPherson?!? Zach R.: This game is a perfect encapsulation of these two franchises. Allergic to success.  Tom G.: The Bengals are so creative at finding ways to lose.  Mike B.: Wow…what happened to the Bengals? It seemed with Burrow and Chase they were going to be among regular Super Bowl contenders with the Chiefs. Now they don’t even look like a playoff team. Has Zac Taylor lost the team? Is it the front office that failed to build the roster?  Getty Images With the victory, the Chargers remain in the top Wild Card spot and the No. 5 seed in the AFC.  The Bengals are now two games out of the final Wild Card position in the AFC, falling behind the Colts and the Dolphins. The Athletic All of a sudden, the AFC West is somewhat competitive. With the Chargers' thrilling victory and the Chiefs' loss on the road in Buffalo, Los Angeles is now just two games back of Kansas City. The Broncos crushed the Falcons at home and the Raiders fell to the Dolphins in Miami. Getty Images Returning from a quad injury, Tee Higgins paid immediate dividends for Cincinnati. He was tied with Ja'Marr Chase for a team-high 13 targets, reeling in nine catches for 148 yards and a 42-yard touchdown catch.  In fact, Higgins almost made a huge catch on the Bengals' Hail Mary attempt in the final seconds. Advertisement Getty Images Burrow took so many shots in the second half and still carried them back. Those missed kicks … Getty Images It was an interesting game for Justin Herbert. He got off to a hot start and then was frigid for most of the second half until a pair of connections with McConkey on the Chargers' game-winning drive.  He finished the evening accumulating 297 yards and two touchdowns, one to Will Dissly and another to Quentin Johnston. Los Angeles improves to 7-3. Getty Images Evan McPherson missed two field goal attempts inside the final eight minute of the game. Either one would have put the Bengals ahead 30-27 and may have provided them an opportunity to run the clock out.  Instead, Cincinnati has suffered yet another brutal loss, one that may extinguish its playoff hopes.  Getty Images Another MVP performance from Burrow wasted in a heartbreaking Bengals loss. He threw for 356 yards and three touchdowns, two to Chase and one to Higgins. He now has 3,028 passing yards, 27 TDs and just four interceptions this season. USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images How many inexplicable, heartbreaking ways can one team lose in a single season? The 2024 Bengals are your answer.  Now 1-6 in one-score games.

The ball hits his hands but he is blown up by Derwin James, who might have saved a touchdown. Crazy ending to a crazier game.  Getty Images J.K. Dobbins hasn’t been very busy tonight relatively speaking, with only 12 scrimmage plays. The good news for fantasy managers who started him is that two of those plays found the end zone. That gives Dobbins 18.9 PPR points tonight and six games with 16+ PPR points on the season. Getty Images Q4 00:18 Bengals 27, Chargers 34 J.K. Dobbins takes the handoff and breaks free down the sideline, leaping into the end zone for a go-ahead touchdown from 29 yards out. Dobbins could have gone down before the end zone to kill clock but he went for the score, giving the Bengals the smallest sliver of hope. Extra point by Dicker is good."
Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How Lee Carsley signed off as England manager with a 5-0 win against Republic of Ireland in the Nations League,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/england-republic-of-ireland-live-updates-nations-league-score-result/Gg6kKtzKiinv/,"Sun, 17 Nov 2024 20:20:17 GMT","Goals from Kane, Gordon, Gallagher, Bowen, and Harwood-Bellis led England to a 5-0 win against Republic of Ireland and Nations League promotion","The Athletic's Jack Pitt-Brooke and Thom Harris were on hand to deliver The Briefing from Wembley — you can find it at the link below. Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here. GO FURTHER England 5-0 Republic of Ireland: Carsley enhances reputation, two sides of Harry Kane Getty Images The next time we see England in action, there will be a new man in the dugout. As I'm sure you are aware, that man will be Thomas Tuchel. He starts his new job on January 1 and will have a couple of months to get his feet under the table before his first camp.  The next international break is in March and, as a result of England's Nations League promotion, we know that the two fixtures in that break will be 2026 World Cup qualifiers. We don't, however, know who the opponents will be yet — the draw for the qualification groups will be made on December 13. Advertisement Getty Images If you give any player, especially a defender, the chance to attack a cross to score a goal on their international debut, they aren't going to need a second invitation. As Bellingham faded an excellent cross between the two Republic of Ireland centre-backs and towards the back post, Harwood-Bellis was already on his bike. The 22-year-old timed his jump to perfectly to meet the ball before thundering his header into the ground and into the back of the net. The fourth player to score his first England this evening and, by far, the most surprising. Getty Images Jarrod Bowen made a difference when he came on against Greece, and did so again tonight. The West Ham winger netted his first international goal with his first touch of the evening and, as Ed mentions, after the ball had been in play for only three seconds. It was a superb set-piece routine and an even better finish from the 27-year-old who grinned from ear-to-ear as he was embraced by his team-mates. He nearly set up a goal for Dominic Solanke with a bustling dribble down the right second before Harwood-Bellis' header made it five, too. A solid squad option for England — though it'll be tough getting game time on the right winger ahead of Bukayo Saka and Noni Madueke! Getty Images The Guehi-Gallagher connection worked wonders for England from the set-piece for the third goal, as Marc Guehi flicked it on smartly to Conor Gallagher. The pair know each other really well after coming up together through the Chelsea academy, and playing together for a season at Crystal Palace, and gave each other a warm embrace after the third goal. Guehi was beaming with pride for his friend. Getty Images After the opening goal, things quickly went from bad to worse for the Republic of Ireland. Visibly deflated by that opening goal and red card to Liam Scales, it was calamitous defending again. Sammie Szmodics put in a feeble challenge on Tino Livramento and didn't chase the full-back to the byline, two Irish defenders swung for but failed to make strong contact on his cross, and Gordon had too much time to volley home at the back post. Too easy. Getty Images It was really, really poor from Evan Ferguson in the build-up to the penalty and first goal. Mark McGuinness, who was composed on debut, brought the ball out of defence calmly, dummied, and played it inside to the Brighton striker. Ferguson, over-complicating things, tried to bounce it out first-time to a team-mate on the right touchline but it was badly aimed and fell to Harry Kane as Ferguson somewhat petulantly threw his arms up in frustration rather than chasing after the loose ball. That allowed Kane free rein to pick out that magnificent pass to Bellingham, who was brought down for the spot kick. It was careless from Ferguson, and it was incredibly costly for his side. Advertisement Getty Images Our man on the ground at Wembley, Max Mathews, did a lovely job of analysing the five second-half goals — he's dedicated an individual post to each one so those are on the way shortly. Thanks to our friends at Opta for those statistics. Getty Images Harry Kane scored the 69th international goal of his career from the penalty spot, taking him past Gerd Muller who managed 68 for Germany between 1966 and 1974. That converted penalty also took him past Republic of Ireland's record goalscorer Robbie Keane, who scored 68. Hallgrimsson continued: ""We lost what we were doing. Maybe it's harsh to say we 'gave up'. It was kind of a shock to be three goals down and I didn't feel like we had any way out. ""If you can play like this for 50 minutes, let's hope we can do it longer. If we would have got a penalty and scored a goal, it would have been a totally different game, different scenario. ""I believe in these guys but the past has been tough. We just need to use this to our advantage and look at what positives we can take from this game."" Getty Images Not a good evening for Republic of Ireland manager Heimir Hallgrimsson who will have been chuffed with his side's first-half performance. ""I'm kind of lost for words,"" he told RTE. ""Six minutes of madness, it was a shock. We probably lost our heads at this moment. From there, we lost our heads, gave up.  ""We're struggling with confidence and it clearly took away all confidence from what we did really well in the first half. It's difficult to come back from it. ""It's easy to stand on the sidelines and criticise. The game was like we wanted it to be at half-time. It's easy to criticise from outside. Look, excuses when you lose 5-0 are kind of pathetic. It's embarrassing to lose 5-0."" Advertisement  A special, special day for Taylor Harwood-Bellis who shocked the whole of Wembley by scoring on his England debut. ""It is a great day for me and my family. It's every young kid's dream to make their debut, and to score the goal is magical,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Playing for my country at every level is something I take such pride in. ""To play for the seniors is something you dream of, it is the pinnacle off football, to do it and score is some feeling."" ""I had a few hints yesterday that I would be needed at some point, when I got the nod to come on I was over the moon."" GO FURTHER How Taylor Harwood-Bellis earned England’s trust after just 10 Premier League games There wasn't much at all to write home about at half-time. But plenty more to reflect in the full-time stats — as you can see below. Lee Carsley won five of his six games as England manager — finishing with a win percentage of 83. The only manager in England's history with a better win percentage is Sam Allardyce with 100 (one game; one win). Getty Images Irish captain Nathan Collins — who offered an apology to the away fans at full time — spoke to RTE after the match. ""First of all, it's an apology from all the lads for that second half. That's nowhere near the standard we should be,"" he said. ""Obviously circumstances changed things but we know as a group we're a lot better than, that's not on and we need to do a lot better than that."" Discussing the penalty given away by Liam Scales, he added: ""I'd need to see it back again, I did think it was a little bit soft if I'm honest.  ""Yeah, he (the referee) did like his yellow card but it doesn't take away from the fact that we weren't good enough in the second half."" Getty Images It might seem a bit odd to point to an incident in the first half as changing the tide of the game, given the teams went in at 0-0 and all the goals came in the second half. But Liam Scales' first yellow card was pointless and utterly avoidable. England won a free kick deep inside their penalty area, and Conor Gallagher scampered after the loose ball to try to take it quickly and inject some tempo into the game. The Irish were well covered defensively, but Scales needlessly moved the ball away from him several times as Gallagher chased it down, leading to the caution.  If he hadn't been booked, his yellow for giving away the penalty would have been his first, and Ireland would have played with 11 for the rest of the match, potentially avoiding the embarrassing later glut of goals. Advertisement Football Association CEO Mark Bullingham hailed Lee Carsley in a statement after the 5-0 win. The statement read: ""I would like to thank Lee Carsley and his coaching team for their hard work and results in the last six games. ""Lee has achieved the main objective from the six fixtures this autumn: securing promotion back to the top tier of the Nations League. ""He has selected some exciting new players and will be providing Thomas Tuchel and Anthony Barry with a very detailed handover as they start work on our qualifying campaign for the 2026 World Cup."" Getty Images Having said that his overwhelming reaction to this Nations League was relief, Carsley was asked whether he will be recommending this young cohort of players to incoming manager Thomas Tuchel. ""I don't think it's a gamble with some of these players, they're excellent players but their mentality is what stands out,"" he told ITV Sport. ""Any challenge you put in front of them, they want to overcome. ""Especially with the (recent) Under-21 players, they've got a history of winning and they expect to win when they turn up for England."" Lee Carsley was perhaps more pleased with the first-half performance than he should've been, but had every right to enjoy that win. ""It was a good performance. The way we started the game, we played with real intent and it was frustrating to come off at half-time at 0-0,"" he told ITV Sport. ""I believed that we'd score goals if we just kept doing what we'd spoken about and it was great that we got our rewards in the end."""

The liver is the liver. “Everybody knows that Stipe isn’t the biggest heavyweight but he’s lean and always comes in in the best possible shape. He doesn’t react much to getting punched in the face so we worked the body. “As far as my future in the Octagon is concerned, I have decided to not retire. I have conversations with Dana and maybe if everything goes right, we’ll give you what you want to see. I know we have other options. I will see what Uncle Dana wants.” Jones then thanks the President-elect Donald Trump, before imitating his dance moves. Getty Images Jon Jones kicks to the head. He’s dismantling Stipe Miocic in there. A left jab crashes through Miocic’s guard, and another. The former champ is looking very beaten up.  Jones briefly considers trying to take Miocic to the mat again but he’s having a lot of success on his feet, just picking his opponent off. Miocic is only really potshotting in response. Jones attempts another spinning back kick to the body … and it lands in sickening fashion! Miocic drops to his knees and Jones rushes in … but the referee is already there.  The fight is over. Jon Jones has defeated Stipe Miocic in the third round to defend his UFC Heavyweight title.  Advertisement Better from Stipe Miocic. He starts the third round on the front foot and, for the first time in this fight, he forces Jon Jones back. He lands a short uppercut and Jones grimaces in acknowledgement that he felt it.  But Jones isn’t in trouble for long and a sharp left elbow checks Miocic’s progress.  Getty Images Jon Jones looks very sharp in there, clinching with Stipe Miocic and slamming a knee into his body. Miocic is looking very hesitant to engage. Jones plants his feet and throws a big overhand left, but misses. He follows it with another kick to the body, which lands. And before the klaxon sounds he sneaks in a spinning back-kick to the body, too.  That’s another round to Jones. Getty Images Stipe Miocic needs to stay on his feet for as long as possible. He starts the round with a good left hand but he is still breathing very heavily after that punishing opening round. Jon Jones lands a couple more kicks to the body. Miocic is already slowing down.  As Miocic gets some ointment applied under his right eye after the first round, it’s easy to see how frustrating it must be to fight Jones, who spent the last half of that round completely enveloping Miocic on the ground. Jones is so tough because of his versatility and his discipline during fights, and he rarely seems to give his opponents room to maneuver. Getty Images These are big elbows from Jon Jones. Nasty shots that are landing flush across Stipe Miocic’s face. Miocic is trying to work his way back to his feet but Jones is all over him. He is landing elbow after elbow. Miocic is trying to punch from the bottom but he isn’t landing. Jones is in total control. Can Miocic survive this final minute? It’s remarkable Miocic’s face isn’t more cut up after all these elbows. Jones postures up again and it looks as though he’s attempting to find more space for some 12-6 attacks but Miocic weathers the storm. The klaxon sounds. Advertisement Getty Images Jon Jones throws the first shot of the fight, a straight left. He looks for a moment as though he’s going to follow it up with a takedown attempt but decides against it. Jones throws the first kick, a hard inside kick which wobbles Stipe Miocic just slightly. That wakes Miocic up and he crowds Jones, looking to unload. Jones then secures the first takedown of the fight, tripping Miocic and heaving him down to the mat. He begins landing elbows from the top and there is already blood on the face of Miocic.

Getty Images 💬 James R: “I hope the Stipe that fought Daniel Cormier the second time shows up, lean and quicker. It’s a long shot he’ll win, but I really hope he’s got one more performance in him so we can all move on from Jon Jones.” 💬 Ben P: “There are parallels — and not a little irony — that Tyson and Jones are both fighting on the same weekend. Both are absolutely terrifying fighters with darkness and demons, but one has managed to redeem himself through accountability, a ton of mental health work, jail time, and losing everything. Hopefully Jones figures it out before it is too late.” 💬 Tom B: “(Jones) is scared of Aspinall. Plain as day. He goes on about his legacy, but tonight’s fight sours it in my opinion.” Advertisement Getty Images It’s time for the main event of the evening. Getty Images OK, sometimes mixed martial arts is a chess match. Other times, a dude carrying another dude on his back in an absolutely inadvisable position leaps backward to slam them both to the ground, mostly for the cheers. Worth it. Getty Images Michael Chandler has also been interviewed in the Octagon. “I was supposed to show up tonight and do my job and win the fight. Maybe I fight Max Holloway next for the BMF belt. Or maybe I fight Conor McGregor if he ever gets his house in order.”"

The Bulldogs rallied from a 10-0 second-quarter deficit thanks to 346 passing yards, two touchdowns through the air and a rushing score from Beck, securing a win that should move them back into the CFP selection committee’s bracket after they fell out last week following a 28-10 loss to Ole Miss. Tennessee’s first three possessions of the second half ended in punts. Continue reading here. GO FURTHER Georgia tops Tennessee to keep Playoff hopes alive: Are Vols on outside looking in? ATHENS, Ga. — Tennessee is a College Football Playoff team, the bulk of the evidence illustrated in a Saturday night setting that is not conducive for the thriving of average teams. You don’t get between the hedges with Georgia – even this low-calorie version of Georgia – and seize a 10-0 lead, reverse momentum after it deserted you and have multiple opportunities to draw even in the fourth quarter if you lack quality. Continue reading here. GO FURTHER Tennessee blew it at Georgia, but Vols’ College Football Playoff hopes are not blown Advertisement For all who love chaos, the potential eight-team tie for first place in the SEC is sadly over. The potential six-team tie, however, remains very much alive after Saturday’s action.  But clarity is nearing on who will play in the SEC championship: If no more upsets occur, Alabama would likely play the winner of the Texas at Texas A&M regular-season finale.  Of course, more upsets could occur.  Here are the updated standings at the top of the league. All three-loss teams are officially eliminated from championship game consideration because Georgia and one of Texas and Texas A&M are guaranteed to finish with two (or fewer) losses. That includes LSU and Missouri, which each suffered their third conference loss on Saturday. Continue reading here. GO FURTHER SEC tiebreakers: Alabama vs. Texas-Texas A&M winner is new likeliest title game scenario ATHENS, Ga. — The story going around was that Tennessee fans had found and leaked Carson Beck’s phone number. Just like they did two years ago to Stetson Bennett, Beck’s predecessor as Georgia’s quarterback, and we all remember how that turned out: Bennett mocking Vols fans after a touchdown run, making the phone-to-ear sign. Continue reading here. GO FURTHER Carson Beck gave Georgia the QB performance it had to have on a night of validation The Athletic  Above are the latest SEC standings after tonight's game. With Georgia's win, they are now one game back of Texas for first in the conference.  Nico Iamaleava: 20-of-33 passing for 167 yards, zero touchdowns and zero interceptions.  Carson Beck: 25-of-40 passing for 346 yards, two touchdowns and zero interceptions.  Ole Miss sacked Beck five times last week and didn’t require blitzing to live in the Georgia backfield. That didn’t bode well for the Bulldogs against projected first-round edge James Pearce Jr. and one of the deepest and most talented defensive fronts in the nation. But that is why games are worth playing. The run game was mostly just a time killer for Georgia — its running backs managed just 75 yards on 24 carries — but Beck was clean all night in the pocket. Tennessee managed zero sacks and, by the fourth quarter, was sending extra rushers in vain. The Vols’ offense actually took another step forward in this game, while their supposed biggest advantage didn’t come through. They aren’t a huge sacks team — tied for 35th in the FBS with 22 coming into the weekend — but not affecting Beck at all was a massive disappointment. Advertisement Georgia’s season was on the brink after the loss at Ole Miss. A third loss would probably have doomed the preseason No. 1 team to missing the first 12-team College Football Playoff, an outcome that even with Georgia’s difficult schedule would have been deemed a failure. And as Tennessee jumped out to a 10-0 lead, the angst in Sanford Stadium was easy to sense. Then the game turned on one play. Facing third-and-long, the offense having gained a grand total of 21 yards over the first 15 plays, Beck saw a Tennessee player jump offsides and went for the big play — and got it, finding Lovett for a 38-yard catch-and-run. Four plays later, Georgia scored. Momentum had flipped. Georgia would also score the next three times it touched the ball, taking a 24-17 lead into the fourth quarter and then icing it down the stretch. This win doesn’t by itself cement Georgia’s spot in the Playoff, but the Bulldogs’ next two games are also at home, and they will be favored. Next week against UMass should offer a chance to rest, physically and emotionally, for the regular season finale against Georgia Tech. This Georgia team has not looked anywhere close to the best team in the country this season. But it can still be a dangerous team in the Playoff, especially if its final three games serve as a rejuvenation. On Saturday night, it looked very much like that was happening. Tennessee would have been in great shape to make the SEC title game and nearly a lock to make the College Football Playoff — presuming wins over UTEP and Vanderbilt — with a win. Shoot, Tennessee would have had a case for No. 2 in the country with this win. Now the Vols wait nervously to see what the committee will do with them Tuesday and what it may say about their chances in the end. Indiana and BYU both passed the Vols in the rankings last week after underwhelming wins. Of course, trying to read into the committee’s week-to-week variance is a fool’s errand, as the four-team era taught us. But the Vols could use a convincing win on their in-state rival’s home field in Nashville on Thanksgiving weekend, and they might need help elsewhere.  Getty Images  This was the Carson Beck of last year, the one many expected to be in the running for the Heisman Trophy, maybe even the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. He had zip on his ball, he threw downfield with accuracy and he made good decisions. And in homage to predecessor Stetson Bennett, whose touchdown run was the highlight of the 2022 win over Tennessee in Athens, Beck made surprising use of his own feet: a 10-yard run on third down for the go-ahead touchdown in the third quarter, following up a 14-yard run in the second quarter to set up Georgia’s first touchdown. After that run, Beck extended his arm and pointed forward, the first down signal. Maybe a bit cocksure, but a sign that his swagger was back. It was Beck’s passing that carried the offense, along with pass protection that was remarkably better than previous weeks. After giving up five sacks in last week’s loss to Ole Miss, the Bulldogs gave left tackle Monroe Freeling his first career start, and he along with the rest of the line gave Beck a clean pocket. Beck threw for more than 200 yards over the course of four consecutive scoring drives in the second and third quarter. That production came despite a series of drops by his receivers and the loss of starter Dillon Bell, who went out with an ankle injury in the second quarter. Beck turned to veteran tight end Delp, who hauled in the first two touchdowns. Arian Smith and Dominic Lovett atoned for drops with big receptions. London Humphreys hauled in some big-chunk passes. And a true freshman getting his first significant action, Nitro Tuggle, found his way into the gameplan. Five different Georgia players had at least 50 receiving yards. It was the kind of night Georgia had envisioned for this year, a confident Beck distributing to an array of options. It finally came together at just the right time.

When asked if tonight's win showed anything to the CFP committee, Smart said ""I don't know."" ""I don’t know what they look for,"" Smart said.

Earlier this week, The Athletic’s Dane Brugler ranked Hunter No. 1 on his updated 2025 NFL Draft big board — two spots up from Hunter’s preseason slot. Brugler wrote that “Hunter is the best draft-eligible player in the country, and I don’t think that will change between now and April. Does he project best at wide receiver? Cornerback? Both? Those questions will be answered as he progresses through the process, but regardless, Hunter is the clear favorite to be the first non-quarterback drafted.” Continue reading here. GO FURTHER Travis Hunter tracker: Heisman frontrunner dazzles again as Colorado keeps rolling Ron Chenoy / Imagn Images Travis Hunter's had a full day today. He's got five catches for 55 yards, plus a five-yard carry for a touchdown. Defensively, he's got an interception, a pass breakup and three tackles.      Advertisement For the second time today, Travis Hunter hits the Heisman pose. A busted double reverse was only busted for a few seconds because Hunter found a seam down the center of the Utah defense and catapults into the end zone. Hunter's first rushing touchdown of his career, but certainly still No. 1 in the Heisman convo. Travis Hunter might have been set up to throw that ball but weaved through Utah's defense for a touchdown to put this one on ice. Days with an interception and a receiving touchdown are pretty good for the Heisman resume. He's not giving up any ground on his lead in the Heisman race today. Run, 1st & 5 at UTAH 5 Travis Hunter rushes for a 5 yard touchdown. Run, 1st & Goal at UTAH 4 Charlie Offerdahl rushes for a 4-yard touchdown. Isaac Wilson was that guy who is striping drives for six holes, starts feeling himself, leans into one and duck hooks it 170 yards. Tough pick for the kid who's had some legit special moments today. D.J. McKinney makes a huge play to keep this game from getting real nervy for the Buffs. Advertisement Colorado's defense steps up again and forces Utah's third turnover of the game on an interception. Colorado has the ball and an 11-point lead Utah is going to lose its sixth straight game today — the longest skid of Kyle Whittingham's 20-year tenure — but at least it's finally trying to do cool stuff. After former Baylor men's basketball player Caleb Lohner snags a touchdown, Isaac Wilson throws a pass to left tackle Spencer Fano who runs in the two-point conversion. Yes, the Buffaloes have the lead but their three turnovers have been brutal today. Let's see if the Utes can take advantage of the third one like they did the first two. How does Utah have a never-ending stream of giant tight ends with good hands? Without Brant Kuithe for the rest of the season, Carsen Ryan has become Isaac Wilson's favorite target in the second half. The 6-foot-4, 256-pound tight end had just four catches for 27 yards this year but has three for 57 yards today. And Caleb Lohner, a 6-foot-8, 235-pound tight end, caught a jump ball to get the Utes within two scores. Wild. Drelon Miller is a really interesting prospect, too. He was the best high school signee in Deion Sanders' thin class from last year, but the four-star receiver prospect is used a lot more like San Francisco uses Deebo Samuel. The coaches find ways to get him the ball in all kinds of ways and he's spent some time at running back this year, too Advertisement It's probably because I've watched Colorado more than any other team this season, but it's hard for me to think of seeing another quarterback in 2024 who routinely makes perfect throws at the same clip Shedeur Sanders does. That needle threaded to Drelon Miller for a 47-yard touchdown officially puts a game that was already out of reach for this anemic Utah offense out of reach.      Pass, 3rd & 12 at UTAH 47 Shedeur Sanders completes pass to Drelon Miller for a 47-yard touchdown. Ron Chenoy / Imagn Images Total Yards: Utah 164, Colorado 270 Passing Yards: Utah 143, Colorado 223 Rushing Yards: Utah 21, Colorado 47 First Downs: Utah 8, Colorado 13 Turnovers: Utah 2, Colorado 2 Possession Time: Utah 25:41, Colorado 19:19 Travis Hunter's Heisman case has been a mixed bag today. He picked off a pass early on a tipped ball and had a highlight reel catch on fourth down to keep a touchdown drive alive. But he barely has been targeted on offense and has just three catches for 42 yards and just gave up an easy touchdown on a vertical route to Dorian Singer. That catch makes a game that looked out of hand look a little more interesting now.      Ron Chenoy / Imagn Images Utah-Colorado is a showcase of divergent preseason fortunes. Utah was picked to win the Big 12 this year but has once again been hit with a barrage of injuries, most notably to quarterback Cam Rising and tight end Brant Kuithe. Both were sidelined most of last season, and both are done for the year early. Meanwhile, Colorado has managed to stay healthy and despite playing well short of its best game, is up big on the Utes. Not bad for a team picked 11th in the Big 12 in preseason after winning just one Pac-12 game last season.      Advertisement FOX's Joel Klatt just said that 40-yard touchdown grab by Utah's Dorian Singer was the first touchdown Travis Hunter has allowed in single coverage all season. That's wild, but not that surprising.      Ron Chenoy / Imagn Images When Colorado has something close to balance, its offense looks almost impossible to stop. It's getting that balance today. Isaiah Augustave broke a 37-yard touchdown run to break this game open after Nikhai Hill-Green picked off Isaac Wilson. The Buffaloes haven't tried to run the ball much but their backs have 59 yards on six carries. That's about all it takes to keep defenses honest and fuel the passing game for Shedeur Sanders and one of the nation's best receiving corps, headlined by Travis Hunter.      Pass, 1st & 10 at COL 40 Isaac Wilson completes pass to Dorian Singer for a 40 yard touchdown."

The eight-round fight, which was streamed live on Netflix, was scored 80-72, 79-73 and 79-73 in favor of Paul, who is 31 years younger than Tyson. The 58-year-old struggled with his movement throughout and, in the final rounds, Paul appeared hesitant to inflict too much damage on the former undisputed world heavyweight champion. “I was trying to hurt him,” he insisted in the ring afterwards. Distressingly, Tyson appeared to suggest after his defeat that he could be lured back into the sport in the future. He identified Jake’s brother, Logan, as a potential next opponent.  Netflix’s first foray into live combat sports meanwhile endured some rocky moments with a number of viewers complaining of streaming and buffering problems before and during the fight. GO FURTHER Jake Paul defeats Mike Tyson with ease in Netflix spectacle   💬 Carlos JM: “I bought into the hype hoping to see that Tyson magic one more time but watching him walking into the ring I thought that he looked old and that it might not turn out well for him. Thankfully Paul is a make-believe boxer and didn’t do much of anything in the ring. A total farce and cash grab.” 💬 Rich H: “Awful. Jake Paul should be embarrassed. Netflix should be embarrassed. And Mike may have tarnished his legacy a little bit more.” 💬 SP, via email: “Well that went pretty much as expected. Totally disappointing but we shouldn’t be surprised. And Mike Tyson vs Logan Paul just shouldn’t be allowed, although I can’t imagine many people would bother to watch after what we saw today. Thank you for the live coverage which helped me out whenever Netflix went down, which was often!” Thank you to everybody who sent us a message. I always love hearing where you are watching the fight and today we heard from people as far afield as India, Hong Kong and even the Tortilla Flats on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica (pictured — thanks JS). Apologies to those of you whose message we didn’t get time to properly respond to — we’ll make sure we do next time.  Advertisement Getty Images Mike Tyson landed just 18 punches across that 16 minute fight. He threw 97. Jake Paul, on the other hand, landed 78, more than four times as many. He threw 278. Getty Images We’ve had a couple of emails asking about this but, yes, this loss will go on Mike Tyson’s professional record because it was a sanctioned bout.  That means Tyson’s pro record now stands at 50-7. Jake Paul becomes just the sixth man to defeat Tyson, the former undisputed world heavyweight champion, joining Buster Douglas, Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis, Danny Williams and Kevin McBride. Paul’s professional record meanwhile improves to 11-1.  Getty Images 💬 Ryan L: “We are living in a South Park episode.” 💬 Harry V: “A shameless cash grab by Netflix, whose servers couldn’t handle it. 1/10 experience.” 💬 Darren A: “Worst part is, we all knew it was gonna be s***. But we all still watched. Awful, awful poison.” 💬 Rory P: “Embarrassing for all involved unfortunately, myself included. We all watched, tempted by the prospect of Iron Mike delivering one more knockout but it was clear after the second round he was all out of steam. The Taylor/Serrano fight before was so far ahead of the main event, it might as well have been a different sport. Netflix can try and turn the crowd noise down all they want but we all heard the boos. Hopefully, this is the beginning of the end for these kinds of events…” Getty Images 💬 Sky: “I’m not even going to call this a fight. It looked like two guys who really didn’t want to get hit because they already had their paychecks. Glad it was free…” 💬 Y: “I feel ashamed I actually watched this.” 💬 Dom M: “Tyson is 58 but looked like 78. No mobility whatsoever. Paul barely broke a sweat and earned a big payday. I gotta think the entire thing was staged. The women’s world title fight that preceded this one was by far the highlight of the night.” 💬 Josh H, via email: “Comfortably the worst boxing match I have ever watched. Makes me long for the glory days of Mayweather vs. McGregor.” Getty Images Nearly five hours later, the main card is in the books and truth be told, it was not worth the wait.  At age 58, Tyson looked a shell of himself, understandably so. Paul seemed to take his foot off the gas after a strong flurry early in the fight. The best fight of the night turned out to be Serrano vs. Taylor, which had intense action, blood and a controversial ending. Between the sluggish main event, Netflix's technical difficulties and buffering, this event overall feels like something of a dud.  Advertisement Andre Ward, the former unified super middleweight and light heavyweight world champion, has just summed it all up quite nicely on Netflix. “Hopefully people aren’t too disappointed but he’s 58 years old, what did you expect?” Getty Images Oh boy. Ariel Helwani asks Mike Tyson if this is his last fight. “I don’t know. It depends on the situation,” he replies. When pressed if this is the last time he will be in the ring, he says: “I don’t think so?” Helwani asks who he could fight next. “Maybe I fight his brother.” “Motherf*****, I’ll kill you Mike,” Logan Paul, stood next to his brother Jake, shoots back.  Please God, no.  Getty Images Jake Paul has just been interviewed in the ring on Netflix. Asked about Mike Tyson, he says: “This guy has always had my back. I love him and his family, his coaches. It was an honor to be in the ring with him. I was trying to hurt him but I was scared he was going to hurt me. I did my best.” Paul says he wants to fight Canelo next. Getty Images We go to the scorecards for the final time this evening. One judge has it 80-72. The other two have it 79-73. Jake Paul defeats Mike Tyson via unanimous decision. Paul landed a couple more shots but it was clear they were both just trying to get to the end. Paul should take it pretty easily on the scorecards. But then again, the last two fights have had surprising results. I have Tyson winning one round and Paul winning, 79-73. Advertisement  It’s time for the final round. Mike Tyson takes an eternity to rise from his stool. When he does, the two men touch gloves. Two minutes left. Will Jake Paul go for it? His corner wants him to but even he seems a little subdued. Tyson is really struggling to move now and Paul comes forward, looking for the overhand right, his hands lowered. One minute left. Tyson is grimacing. He is wobbling his way to the salvation of the final bell. Not much is coming back in Paul’s direction now. 20 seconds left. 10 seconds left. Tyson dodges out of the way of a couple more shots. Paul spends the final few moments performatively bowing. The bell goes and the two men embrace. That was difficult to watch, in all honesty.  Paul landed a few cleanish punches in the seventh, including some combinations. It was probably the most action that he’s had. Does Tyson have a moment in him? 69-64, Paul. “You’re the young lion, he the old lion,” Jake Paul’s corner tells him. “Mix your s*** up and go at him.” But there’s a flash of the old Mike. He throws a short left uppercut that catches Paul’s attention and follows it up with a stiff jab. He needs to throw a few more shots. Paul has thrown more than twice as many so far. Paul decides to work Tyson’s body and then switches it up, landing a right hook that briefly seems to wobble Tyson. But the bell sounds. One round left. Mercifully.   With every passing round Mike Tyson grows increasingly statuesque. This is resembling a sparring session — and an uneven one at that. After his more exuberant shots in round 5, Jake Paul has got back behind his jab in this one. The crowd sounds incredibly restless.  This is a very strange, somewhat sad spectacle.  I have Paul winning all but one round through the first six, with this fight going blazingly fast with the short rounds. Tyson is very much having trouble putting together any kind of combinations. Paul is only a hair more active, just enough to win. 59-55, Paul. Advertisement  Jake Paul is a whisker away from landing a big right hook. Paul is going for the knockout here. Mike Tyson is leaving himself very exposed and is struggling to avoid Paul’s lunges forward. Paul lands a left hook and, buoyed by its success, lowers his hands. He’s beginning to really fancy his chances in there. Tyson is a stationary target. The finish is there for Paul if he wants it.  This fight is such a downgrade compared with the Serrano-Taylor bout. Getting in the ring was definitely the W for both of them. I wonder how much a ringside seat was. 49-46, Paul. Mike Tyson has turned into a statue. The legend’s legs look every bit of 58 years old as Paul’s combinations grow more and more fluid. Tyson’s decades of ring rust are painfully on display."

And Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase is the first relief pitcher in 16 years to be a Cy Young finalist. National League winner: Chris Sale The Cy Young honor is a career first for Sale, who finished in the top six of the AL voting every year from 2012 through 2018 with the White Sox and Red Sox. After several injury-plagued years in Boston, Sale came to the Braves in a trade last winter and instantly reclaimed his elite status by going 18-3 (setting a career high in wins) with an MLB-best 2.38 ERA and 174 ERA+ and an NL-best 225 strikeouts in his 177 2/3 innings. He was an All-Star for the eighth time in his career and the first time since 2018, and an important linchpin for an Atlanta rotation that suffered the early-season loss of ace Spencer Strider to Tommy John surgery. Sale had already been named NL Comeback Player of the Year at the All-MLB Awards Show last week."
MLB News,"Will Soto end up with Yankees? For Steinbrenner, 'it's been a priority'",https://www.mlb.com/news/hal-steinbrenner-yankees-meeting-juan-soto,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 22:11:23 GMT",,"Bryan Hoch The Yankees have made their freshest pitch to keep Juan Soto in pinstripes, with managing general partner Hal Steinbrenner describing a “good meeting” that included “a very honest, back-and-forth dialogue” with the free agent outfielder. What does that mean for the Yankees’ chances in what promises to be a lucrative derby between some of the league’s deepest pockets? Steinbrenner declined to speculate, but he said that he understands the fans’ strong desire to retain Soto. “He's definitely a significant part of why we got to the World Series,” Steinbrenner told reporters on Wednesday. “I've got ears. I know what's expected of me. So, look, it's been a priority. We wouldn't have gone out to the West Coast if it wasn't.” Steinbrenner spoke in the lobby of Major League Baseball’s offices in Manhattan, where he was attending the Owners Meetings. A Yankees contingent of Steinbrenner, team president Randy Levine, general manager Brian Cashman, manager Aaron Boone and special assistant Omar Minaya met with Soto and agent Scott Boras on Monday near Boras’ Newport Beach, Calif., offices. Soto is believed to have met with several other teams since the end of the World Series, including the Blue Jays, Dodgers, Mets, and Red Sox. It is not believed that teams have tendered contract offers at this stage, instead focusing these meetings upon conveying interest while laying the groundwork for negotiations to come. Asked if he is confident the Yankees will re-sign Soto, Steinbrenner replied: “No idea. We’ll be in the mix. I’ll leave it at that.” The Yankees have repeatedly indicated their desire to retain Soto, who enjoyed one of the best offensive seasons of his career after being acquired from the Padres in December. Steinbrenner and Soto met around the All-Star break to open communications, at which time Soto expressed a desire to wait to discuss business until after the season. While the Mets and owner Steve Cohen are viewed as the primary threat to lure Soto away from the Bronx, Steinbrenner acknowledged that several other owners or backing corporations could also up the ante. “If it doesn’t work out, it’s going to hurt a little bit, no matter where he goes,” Steinbrenner said. Steinbrenner has said that he does not believe teams should require a $300 million payroll to contend for a World Series championship, but with numerous other free agents like Gleyber Torres, Clay Holmes and Anthony Rizzo coming off the books, there are scenarios where the Yankees could make Soto their highest-paid player (exceeding Aaron Judge’s $40 million annual salary) while still addressing the club’s other needs -- pitching, first base, second base and left field among them. ""We're in a better starting position than we were a year ago. There's no doubt about that,"" Steinbrenner said. ""Look, year after year after year after year, payrolls similar to this year and the luxury taxes they produce are not sustainable. That's the case for the vast majority of owners, maybe all of them. Year after year after year -- it doesn't mean in any given year I can't do what I want to do. I mean, we've got the ability to sign any player we want to sign."" Steinbrenner noted that in their meeting, Soto asked about the club’s player development pipeline, which could be taken as an indication that he is interested in understanding how the Yankees plan to remain competitive long-term. If Soto re-signs, Steinbrenner said that he would be promised the same direct pipeline to ownership that Judge and ace Gerrit Cole have experienced in recent seasons. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. “Should he be back next year, I made it clear that the kind of relationship I would like is the kind of relationship I have with Gerrit and with Aaron Judge,” Steinbrenner said. “So that message was conveyed.”"
MLB News,"Cubs acquire reliever Morgan, trade prospect to Guardians",https://www.mlb.com/news/eli-morgan-trade-cubs-guardians,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 19:45:00 GMT",Widsom designated for assignment,"Jordan Bastian CHICAGO – One of the stated goals for Cubs president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer this offseason was to build up a deeper bullpen inventory. Setbacks early on last season within the relief corps created a domino effect that took months to sort out. On Wednesday, the Cubs took a step in that planned direction by acquiring reliever Eli Morgan from the Guardians in exchange for outfield prospect Alfonsin Rosario (No. 21 on Pipeline’s Top 30 list for the Cubs). To clear room on the 40-man roster, Chicago designated infielder Patrick Wisdom for assignment. “Our bullpen numbers the second half of the season were really, really strong,” Hoyer said at the end of the season. “And among the top in baseball. But at a critical moment, when those guys struggled and were hurt early, we didn't have enough depth in that moment. And that hurt us. So that's something we have to address.” Morgan is 28 years old, has four years of big league experience as part of Cleveland’s bullpen and is under contractual control for the next three seasons. The right-hander is eligible for arbitration for the first time this offseason and also has one Minor League option remaining, making this a cost-effective addition with some built-in flexibility. All those logistical factors aside, Morgan is also coming off his best performance at the big league level. Last season, the righty turned in a 1.93 ERA with a .256 weighted on-base average against him, per Statcast. In 42 innings, Morgan had 34 strikeouts with 11 walks issued and a .194 opponents’ average. Morgan’s fastball checked in at 92.2 mph on average last year, ranking in the 21st percentile in baseball, according to Statcast. Beyond that, however, the reliever has a plus changeup and above-average slider. The slider overtook the changeup as Morgan’s most-used secondary pitch in ‘24, generating a 32.8% whiff rate. Wisdom, 33, spent the past five seasons with the Cubs, playing mostly third base and offering elite power, especially against left-handed pitching. He set Chicago’s single-season rookie record for home runs with 28 in 2021, when he finished fourth in voting for the National League Rookie of the Year Award. In a sporadic bench role last year, Wisdom hit .171 (.629 OPS) with eight homers in 75 games. Rosario was a sixth-round pick by the Cubs in the 2023 Draft and reached Single-A Myrtle Beach last season. In 109 games, the 20-year-old center fielder hit .230 with 16 homers, 73 RBIs, 20 stolen bases and a .767 OPS. Morgan joins a Cubs bullpen that is a work in progress in terms of personnel and roles. Rookie Porter Hodge reached the Majors and turned into a late-inning option last season. Nate Pearson was acquired at the Trade Deadline in July and should have a big role in ‘25. Lefty Luke Little was growing into a trusted weapon before a left shoulder/lat injury ended his campaign in July. The Cubs added Tyson Miller via trade in May, and he turned into a stabilizing presence. Three relievers from last year’s bullpen (Jorge López, Drew Smyly and Yency Almonte) are free agents, and Adbert Alzolay (recovering from Tommy John surgery) was designated for assignment on Tuesday. The Cubs also have decisions to make by Friday on whether to tender Julian Merryweather, Keegan Thompson and Trey Wingenter (all arbitration eligible) contracts. To Hoyer’s point, the in-season moves made by the Cubs last season helped the bullpen post a 3.33 ERA from June 1 through the end of the campaign. That was the second-lowest mark in the NL and ranked fourth in the Majors during that timeframe. Prior to June, the Cubs logged a 4.61 ERA (14th in NL and 27th in MLB), while dealing with injuries and subpar performances. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. The Cubs’ showing in May (10-18) – exacerbated by the team’s lineup-wide offensive drought that month – played a significant part in their inability to climb back into postseason contention. Looking back, Hoyer acknowledged that the front office should have added more bullpen resources last winter. “Being self critical, I feel like that's something that I didn't do a good job of last offseason,” Hoyer said. “When I look at our bullpen, I'm really proud of the work our whole staff did during the season. … We didn't have the depth [early on] that we needed. And that's something that I know we'll certainly look to improve going forward.”"
MLB News,Are these the top 3 teams for Snell?,https://www.mlb.com/news/blake-snell-rumors,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 21:16:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and rumors surrounding Blake Snell. Nov. 20: Dodgers, Yankees, Giants linked to SnellDuring his Wednesday chat on Bleacher Report, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman mentioned three clubs that are interested in Snell: The Dodgers, Yankees and Giants. The left-handed ace spent the 2024 season with the Giants and was one of the best starters in baseball over the second half of the season. Heyman said he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if Snell re-signed with the club. ""[Snell] loved San Francisco and he thrived in San Francisco, and if you love San Francisco, there's a good chance you end up in San Francisco,"" Heyman said. The Yankees are focused on bringing Juan Soto back to the Bronx, but if they do so, Heyman said he doesn't think the team will also spend the money necessary to get a pitcher like Snell. The Red Sox have been talking with Snell, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan, and the left-hander's list of suitors extends to the Mets, Orioles and Blue Jays, per MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Nov. 16: Snell reportedly in talks with Red SoxESPN's Jeff Passan said during Friday's edition of the Baseball Bar-B-Cast podcast that the Red Sox are talking to Snell as well as fellow left-handed ace Max Fried. Last week, MLB.com's Mark Feinsand identified the Red Sox as one of the top suitors for Snell, who is a free agent for the second straight offseason and whose stock on the open market should be higher this year than after he won his second Cy Young Award in 2023. Signing Snell would give Boston two things its rotation didn't have last season: a left-hander and a bona fide No. 1 starter. Nov. 6: How many teams are in on Snell?Following his fantastic second half of the 2024 season, Blake Snell is expected to draw interest from many big-market clubs. MLB.com's Mark Feinsand has listed the Giants, Yankees, Mets, Red Sox, Dodgers, Orioles and Blue Jays among the left-hander's potential suitors. An industry source also told Katie Woo and Will Sammon of The Athletic (subscription required) that the Rangers could be in the mix as well. However, that source added that the extent of interest from Toronto and Texas depends on Snell's price tag. Snell opted out of his two-year, $62 million deal with the Giants last week. Although Snell carried a 9.51 ERA through his first six starts with San Francisco and went on the injured list twice within the season's first three months, he was one of the most dominant starters in the Majors over the final three months. That period included 114 strikeouts over 80 1/3 innings and a .382 opponents' OPS. Of course, Snell is just one year removed from winning the NL Cy Young Award with the Padres, the second of his career. Feinsand wrote that Snell's next contract should exceed $27 million in annual average value -- the AAV of Carlos Rodón's six-year deal with the Yankees that he signed prior to the 2023 season. However, Snell's deal might come with fewer guaranteed years since he is entering his age-32 campaign. Rodón was 30 when he joined the Yanks. Nov. 1: Snell becomes free agent after opting out of contractAs expected, Snell is a free agent for the second straight offseason. The left-hander exercised the opt-out clause in his two-year, $62 million deal with the Giants on Friday, putting him back on the open market. Last season started off poorly for Snell, who didn't sign with the Giants until mid-March and recorded a 9.51 ERA through his first six starts and made two trips to the injured list. But over the final three months of the season, he looked like the pitcher who won the 2023 National League Cy Young Award with San Diego. Snell pitched to a 1.23 ERA over his last 80 2/3 innings, limited hitters to .382 OPS and racked up 114 strikeouts. According to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, Snell is a top-three free agent in this year's class. The Giants, Padres and Rangers are among the potential fits for Snell, who will turn 32 on Dec. 4. He is hoping to sign earlier this time and believes he has shown enough to avoid languishing on the open market for another offseason. “I think that was more on teams,” Snell said in late September. “That wasn’t on me. I also think what I was able to accomplish this year will make teams be more aggressive earlier, so I’ll be looking forward to that. We’ll see.”"
MLB News,Sasaki not expected to sign with MLB team before Jan. 15,https://www.mlb.com/news/roki-sasaki-rumors,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 23:34:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and rumors surrounding Roki Sasaki. Nov. 20: Sasaki not expected to sign with MLB team until Jan. 15MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said Wednesday that Sasaki is expected to be part of the 2025 international amateur signing class, which means the Japanese right-hander likely won't sign with a club before Jan. 15. ""It looks like ... the signing will happen in the new pool period,"" Manfred said via The Athletic's Evan Drelich. This was always the expected route for Sasaki, who is subject to MLB's international amateur signing bonus pool rules because he is younger than 25 years old and hasn't reached six years of service time. That means the value of his big league contract is limited to the money available in a team's bonus pool. The Dodgers, with about $2.5 million, have the most money of any team left in its bonus pool during the current 2024 international signing period. But if Sasaki waits until Jan. 15, when the 2025 international signing period begins, he could sign a contract in the neighborhood of $7 million. MLB.com's Jonathan Mayo provided the complete list of international bonus pools for the 2025 signing period here. Before Sasaki can sign with a team, he needs to be posted by his Nippon Professional Baseball club, the Chiba Lotte Marines. However, the team announced earlier this month that Sasaki will be posted this offseason. Nov. 14: Could this be the deciding factor in the Sasaki sweepstakes?The Dodgers are viewed as one of the top contenders to sign Sasaki once he is posted by his Nippon Professional Baseball team, the Chiba Lotte Marines. However, The Athletic's Jim Bowden (subscription required) doesn't see it that way. Based on his conversations with league sources, Bowden thinks it's ""unlikely"" Sasaki will sign with the Dodgers. And Bowden mentioned a few reasons why. The main one has to do with money. Since Sasaki is younger than 25 years old and hasn't reached six years of service in a foreign major league, he is subject to MLB's international amateur signing bonus pool rules. He won't get anything close to the $325 million contract that Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto received last offseason. Instead, Sasaki's contract value will be limited to what a team has in its bonus pool. That could be somewhere in the neighborhood of $7 million if Sasaki waits to sign until after Jan. 15, when each team's bonus pool will be refilled for the start of the 2025 international signing period. So, how can Sasaki make more money outside of his contract? Bowden says the answer is simple: endorsements. But therein lies the possible issue with a Sasaki-Dodgers match. ""In Los Angeles, [Sasaki would] be in the shadow of both [Shohei] Ohtani and Yamamoto, which would lessen his endorsement ceiling,"" Bowden wrote. Conversely, if Sasaki signs with a team such as the Padres, not only would he share a clubhouse with his idol, Yu Darvish, the 23-year-old ""could potentially maximize his endorsements in Japan, positioning himself as a rival to the Dodgers’ Ohtani and Yamamoto rather than a teammate of theirs."" Furthermore, a massive contingent of Japanese media cover the Dodgers on a daily basis, and, per Bowden, ""that level of attention is not the best situation for a young, developing pitcher."" The Dodgers are known for being fantastic with how they develop young pitchers. But Bowden points out that teams such as the Padres, Rays, Mets and Braves also have strong pitching development programs, thereby possibly negating any advantage L.A. might have there. ""Based on what I’m hearing,"" Bowden wrote, ""I think the Padres, Rays, Mets and Braves are all more likely to sign Sasaki than the Dodgers -- and several other teams will be in the mix."" Nov. 9: Do the Padres have an edge in the Sasaki sweepstakes?MLB.com's Mark Feinsand lists several favorites to land Sasaki, including the Giants, Yankees, Mets, Blue Jays, Cubs and Rangers. But he writes that the two most likely landing spots, at least according to one NL executive, would be the Dodgers and Padres. An article in The Athletic (subscription required) adds the Phillies as a team to watch and also suggests that the Padres may have an advantage by way of one of their current starters. ""In the case of the Padres, Sasaki is believed to be like many other Japanese pitchers who hold a deep admiration for Yu Darvish,"" the report states. That, coupled with Sasaki's reported preference for West Coast teams, could make the Padres a ""favorite among favorites,"" so to speak. Nov. 9: Sasaki to be posted by Chiba Lotte MarinesSasaki appears headed to the Majors next season. Sasaki, the consensus top young pitcher in Japan, will be posted by the Chiba Lotte Marines of the Nippon Professional Baseball, the team announced. Sasaki, 23, should inspire an all-out pursuit reminiscent of Shohei Ohtani’s initial contract with the Angels, in league-wide interest and financial scope. Ohtani agreed to a $2.315 million signing bonus with the Angels in December 2017. An unfettered market would have yielded a much larger contract, but foreign-born players are subject to international bonus pool money restrictions unless they are at least 25 years of age and have played as a professional in a foreign league recognized by Major League Baseball for a minimum of six seasons. Ohtani was not yet 25 years old when he was posted by the Nippon Ham Fighters, so the Collective Bargaining Agreement classified him as an international amateur. Sasaki falls into the same category now. More >"
MLB News,These sleeper prospects earned 40-man roster spots,https://www.mlb.com/news/top-unranked-prospects-added-to-40-man-2024,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 18:05:56 GMT",,"Jonathan Mayo This story was excerpted from MLB Pipeline's newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. Tuesday was decision day for all 30 teams. By 6 p.m. ET, every club had made decisions about who to add to their respective 40-man rosters, and a good amount of prospects were added to protect them from December’s Rule 5 Draft. Players first signed at age 18 or younger must be added to 40-man rosters within five seasons or they become eligible to be drafted by other organizations through the Rule 5 process. Players signed at 19 years or older have to be protected within four seasons. Clubs pay $100,000 to select a player in the Major League phase of the Rule 5 Draft. If that player doesn't stay on the big league active roster for the full season, he must be offered back to his former team for $50,000. For this year, that means an international prospect or high school Draft pick signed in 2020 at age 18 or younger had to be protected. A college player -- or 19-year-old high school player -- taken in the 2021 Draft was in the same position. All four players on MLB Pipeline’s Top 100 Prospects who were eligible were protected. Additionally, there were 96 players on organizational Top 30 lists that had to be added or exposed to the Rule 5 Draft. A total of 38 of those (39.6 percent) did earn roster spots, higher than last year, but the second-lowest percentage over the past 10 years. More from MLB Pipeline:• Top 100 prospects | Stats | Video | Podcast | Complete coverage Beyond the ranked prospects, there were a number of intriguing players not on Top 30s who earned roster spots, 21 in total. It’s a list worth keeping an eye on. In the past, players like Steven Kwan have gone from unranked prospect to 40-man guy to getting Rookie of the Year votes the next season (Kwan finished third in AL ROY voting in 2022). That same year, Félix Bautista went from the unranked to serving as the Orioles closer. A year ago, Cade Smith was on the list, and he went on to play an integral part in the Guardians’ postseason bullpen. Here are 10 unranked players who hope they can follow on that path now that they’ve earned roster spots: Max Acosta, INF, Rangers: When he signed with the Rangers for $1.65 million in 2019 he drew comparisons to Gleyber Torres. Acosta started off slowly, with an OPS hovering around .700 in 2022 and 2023, but came on this year thanks to a better approach, capped off by a .338/.413/.521 showing in the Arizona Fall League. Tyler Callihan, 2B/OF, Reds: Injuries, including Tommy John surgery a month into his first full season, have kept Callihan from developing as hoped since getting $1.5 million in the third round of the 2019 Draft. He still has an impressive left-handed swing and finished the 2024 season strongly before performing well in the AFL. Though not a burner, he’s an aggressive baserunner who can steal bags and is looking like he can help out at second base and left field. Jack Dashwood, LHP, Angels: Lefties who are 6-foot-6 don’t grow on trees. A 12th-round pick in 2019, Dashwood topped 100 innings in 2021 but has had injury issues since. He only threw 10 innings during the regular season, but his showing in the AFL (10 IP, 4 H, 2 BB, 17 K) very likely would have drawn interest from other teams as a lefty reliever in the Rule 5 Draft. Jack Dreyer, LHP, Dodgers: The Dodgers’ system and Top 30 are too deep for Dreyer to make it, but the 2020 undrafted free agent out of Iowa put up impressive numbers in 2024 while reaching Triple-A: 2.20 ERA, 11.3 K/9, 1.9 BB/9, using a sneaky fastball and slider to miss bats. Caleb Durbin, INF, Yankees: The AFL stolen base king has now had two solid Fall League campaigns (1.008 combined OPS with 50 steals in 53 tries) and reached Triple-A during the regular season. GM Brian Cashman has mentioned him as a potential internal candidate to play second base on Opening Day next year, and he’s shown some defensive flexibility with time at three infield spots and a little time in both center and left. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Nic Enright, RHP, Guardians: Enright was actually taken in the 2022 Rule 5 Draft by the Marlins, then was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma and was sent back to the Guardians. He did appear in 16 games this past season in Triple-A and was very sharp, with a 1.06 ERA, 31 K, 5 BB, .155 BAA in 17 IP and his typically high spin rates. Tyler Mattison, RHP, Tigers: A senior sign in the fourth round of the 2021 Draft, Mattison looked headed towards the big league bullpen when he reached Double-A in 2023 and finished with a 2.41 ERA and 13.7 K/9 rate. But he missed all of the 2024 season due to Tommy John surgery, making this one of the more intriguing 40-man adds. Luis Mey, RHP, Reds: Mey has always had premium, late-inning reliever stuff, but he had never been able to land it consistently in the zone (10.3 K/9, 7.0 BB/9 in 2024). But something clicked this fall as the AFL’s Reliever of the Year saved six games and gave up just one hit over 8 2/3 scoreless innings, walking only two. If that continues, seeing him close big league games seems very realistic. Carson Ragsdale, RHP, Giants: Injuries slowed the 6-foot-8 right-hander early, but he’s coming off a year where he logged 120 2/3 IP while reaching Triple-A. He has an outstanding breaking ball that misses bats; he might be best suited for a bullpen role, but the size and the array of stuff give him a chance to start. Tim Tawa, UTIL, D-backs: The Stanford product was an 11th-round pick back in 2021, and he’s played all over the diamond -- every position but pitcher and catcher. He has the chance to be a utility type with thump, one who has hit 53 homers over the past two years in Double- and Triple-A, albeit in hitting friendly environments. Other unranked rostered players: Travis Adams, RHP, Twins; Ryan Cusick, RHP, A’s; Joe Elbis, RHP, D-backs; Matt Koperniak, OF, Cardinals; Chase Lee, RHP, Tigers; Jake Mangum, OF, Rays; Tyler Owens, RHP, Tigers; Chad Patrick, RHP, Brewers; Jesús Rodríguez, C, Yankees; Kade Strowd, RHP Orioles; Matt Svanson, RHP, Cardinals"
MLB News,Which teams are vying for the top FA starting pitchers?,https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-rumors-trades-and-signings,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 22:47:00 GMT",LATEST FREE AGENT & TRADE RUMORS,"MLB.com We're keeping track of all the latest free agent and trade rumors. The demand is high, but the supply is low. That's the story for teams looking to sign a frontline starting pitcher in free agency this offseason. The best arms available are Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell and Max Fried. You could add Japanese right-hander Roki Sasaki to that group, but he hasn't yet been posted for MLB teams, so he's not officially a free agent at the moment. As for those other three pitchers, there are seven teams in the mix, according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman. Here is a rundown on each club and their possible targets. Cubs: Heyman said Fried is an option for Chicago, which is ""focused on pitching."" The Cubs did add to their bullpen on Wednesday, acquiring reliever Eli Morgan from the Guardians.   Dodgers: The reigning World Series champions ""like Snell a lot,"" per Heyman. The Dodgers are considered among the favorites for Sasaki, and Heyman reported last week in the New York Post that L.A. will try to sign one of the Big Three even if they land the Japanese phenom. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi sees the Dodgers as one of the two leading candidates for Burnes.   Red Sox and Orioles: Heyman said both of these AL East teams have ""checked in"" on the top starters. Last week, ESPN's Jeff Passan reported that Boston has been in talks with Fried and Snell. Meanwhile, the Orioles are the other top candidate for Burnes, per Morosi.   Yankees: Heyman directly mentioned the Yankees' interest in Snell, but he added that New York's willingness to go after one of the top starters may be contingent on whether it can re-sign Juan Soto. Heyman said that if Soto doesn't come back to the Bronx, the Yankees ""will be more focused"" on these aces. But if Soto is back in pinstripes, Heyman thinks the Yankees won't spend the money necessary to get one of the top pitchers.   Giants: Heyman said he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if Snell returns to San Francisco after the left-hander enjoyed his time there during the 2024 season. Mets: Another club that's focused on Soto, the Mets will also be looking to upgrade a rotation that could lose Sean Manaea, José Quintana and Luis Severino in free agency. Juan Soto's decision on where to sign this offseason is the most anticipated in baseball, and according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, ""the feeling around the industry"" is that the decision could be made before the annual Winter Meetings get underway in Dallas on Dec. 9. Soto reportedly has already met with the Blue Jays, Red Sox, Mets and incumbent Yankees. Yanks owner Hal Steinbrenner confirmed Wednesday that the club had a ""good meeting"" with Soto. Soto has a couple more meetings reportedly on tap. He is scheduled to meet with the Dodgers next. And according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman, the Phillies plan to meet with Soto at some point, though nothing has been scheduled yet. Per Heyman, it's believed that no offers have been made to Soto yet. You can follow the latest rumblings on Soto here. While this year’s free-agent class has its share of attractive options with significant closing experience, including Tanner Scott, Kenley Jansen, Blake Treinen, Clay Holmes, Carlos Estévez, Kirby Yates and David Robertson, MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi expects the closer trade market to be active as well. Morosi has heard that the Brewers’ Devin Williams, the Cardinals’ Ryan Helsley and the Nationals’ Kyle Finnegan are available. Morosi even went as far as predicting that at least two of those closers will be traded before the end of the calendar year. Williams, Helsley and Finnegan all have one year of team control remaining and could be more cost effective than signing a closer in free agency. The latter two are perhaps more likely to be dealt, given the Cardinals and Nationals are both building for the future, but a Williams trade can’t be ruled out. Teams with serious postseason aspirations typically aren’t looking to trade away top stars from their Major League roster, but the Brewers have shown a willingness to be proactive in the past with players nearing free agency, trading Josh Hader in 2022 and Corbin Burnes last offseason. Williams could be next, though figuring out when to do it is a tough call for Milwaukee. A rival executive who spoke with MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand at the GM Meetings suggested that the Brewers would be better off waiting until the summer to put Williams on the trade block to maximize the return. However, it's possible they will look to deal Williams this offseason to avoid a repeat of the Willy Adames situation. Milwaukee didn’t trade Adames at the Deadline this past summer because it was leading the NL Central, and now the shortstop can depart as a free agent, leaving the club with nothing but a Draft pick in return. Thirteen players were tendered a qualifying offer (a one-year, $21.05 million deal for 2025) this offseason, but Reds right-hander Nick Martinez was the only one who accepted prior to Tuesday's 4 p.m. ET deadline. The following 12 players rejected the qualifying offer and will remain free agents: Since the system was implemented in 2012, only 14 players to receive a QO have accepted it. You can read more about year's QO decisions here. Roki Sasaki isn't the only marquee Japanese pitcher who is expected to make the jump to the Majors this offseason. The 35-year-old Tomoyuki Sugano doesn't possess Sasaki's top-notch velocity, but as a two-time winner of the Sawamura Award -- the Japanese equivalent to the Cy Young Award -- Sugano should have his fair share of suitors. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi has identified one team to watch for Sugano: the Angels. More > The Orioles could be one of the big players on the free-agent market for starting pitchers in their first offseason under their new ownership group. General manager Mike Elias said Friday that the Orioles have ""engaged"" in conversations with high-end starting pitchers in free agency. ""We are looking at the whole menu, the whole spectrum and I credit the ownership change toward putting us in a position to do that,"" Elias said. The highest of the high-end starters on the open market is Corbin Burnes, and the Orioles would welcome his return to Baltimore, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan (subscription required). The Orioles also have been linked to left-handed ace Max Fried. Additionally, Baltimore is among a host of clubs interested in acquiring White Sox southpaw Garrett Crochet via trade. However, given all of the young talent they have traded in the past year, The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required) hears that the O's are more focused on the free-agent market right now. Yankees broadcaster Michael Kay said on his radio program on Monday that according to a source, Mets owner Steve Cohen is willing to beat any other club's offer to Juan Soto by $50 million. More > MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reports in an article for the New York Post that the Yankees met with superstar slugger Juan Soto in Southern California on Monday as they look to retain him after he helped lead them to the World Series. More > According to Ken Rosenthal and C. Trent Rosecrans of The Athletic (subscription required), the Royals and Reds are discussing a trade that would involve right-handed starter Brady Singer going to Cincinnati in return for infielder Jonathan India. However, sources told The Athletic that a trade involving Singer and India was not close on Saturday and is just one of several possibilities both teams are considering. Singer is reportedly drawing interest from other clubs while India is just one of the hitters the Royals are targeting. Singer and India were college teammates at the University of Florida and 2018 first-round MLB Draft picks by their current clubs. Singer is coming off a year in which he recorded a 3.71 ERA and 170 strikeouts over a career-high 179 2/3 innings. India, the 2021 National League Rookie of the Year, has been hampered by injuries during his career, but he had 15 homers and a .750 OPS in 151 games this past season. Both players are under club control through the 2026 season. The Red Sox have reportedly made their pitch -- or at least an initial one -- to Juan Soto. They are also trying to convince the top starting pitchers on the market to come to Fenway, too. ESPN's Jeff Passan said during Friday's edition of the Baseball Bar-B-Cast podcast that the Red Sox are talking to Blake Snell and Max Fried. More > Willy Adames is drawing “broad” interest across the Majors, according to MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi. While Adames’ market includes teams that have an opening at shortstop, there are also a number of clubs eyeing him as a third baseman. More > With Max Fried and Charlie Morton both free agents, adding rotation help is a priority for the Braves this offseason. Nathan Eovaldi ranks near the top of Atlanta’s wish list (per a source), but he isn’t the only free-agent starter the team is said to be considering, as MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi hears the Braves also have interest in Walker Buehler. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Returning from his second Tommy John surgery, Buehler struggled to the tune of a 5.38 ERA over 16 starts this past season. However, he finished the year on a high note, tossing 10 straight scoreless innings in the postseason and closing out the Dodgers’ title-clinching win over the Yankees in Game 5 of the World Series. Buehler, 30, was one of baseball’s top starters from 2018-21, recording a 2.82 ERA (146 ERA+) with 620 strikeouts and 137 walks in 564 innings. Atlanta could be an attractive landing spot for Buehler in more ways than one. The right-hander has ties to two nearby states, as he was born in Kentucky and attended Vanderbilt in Tennessee. Buehler also just watched the Braves have success with another reclamation project, Chris Sale. Atlanta acquired Sale from the Red Sox last offseason after several injury-plagued seasons. The lefty stayed healthy in 2024 and is the overwhelming favorite to win the National League Cy Young Award. In addition to their interest in Eovaldi and Buehler, the Braves have been linked to White Sox lefty Garrett Crochet on the trade market, though it's unclear if they have enough prospect capital to swing a trade. Fried is still a possibility, too, but paying top dollar for free agents is not part of president of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos’ typical M.O. MLB Trade Rumors predicts Fried will sign a six-year, $156 million contract, compared to one year, $15 million for Buehler and two years, $44 million for Eovaldi. The Dodgers are viewed as one of the top contenders to sign Japanese right-hander Roki Sasaki once he is posted by his Nippon Professional Baseball team, the Chiba Lotte Marines. However, The Athletic's Jim Bowden (subscription required) doesn't see it that way. Based on his conversations with league sources, Bowden thinks it's ""unlikely"" Sasaki will sign with the Dodgers. And Bowden mentioned a few reasons why. More > Although the Yankees are going to make a strong effort to bring back Juan Soto, there’s a real chance the superstar outfielder signs elsewhere, which means New York needs to have a backup plan in place. That backup plan appears to have no limits. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Thursday in the New York Post that the Yankees are ""in on everyone."" One day earlier, during his live chat for Bleacher Report, Heyman was a little more specific on which non-Soto players the Yanks might target. More > The Phillies sign Alex Bregman. That is the prediction of one rival evaluator to ESPN's Buster Olney. The Phillies don't have an opening at third base right now, but they could create one by dealing Alec Bohm, who is on the trade block, per ESPN's Jeff Passan (subscription required). Bohm and Bregman had similar offensive production this year (the former had a 117 OPS+ while the latter had a 118) and both were plus defenders according to outs above average. However, Bregman, a 2024 Gold Glover, has a much longer track record of stellar defense at the hot corner. His has 28 OAA for his career at the position while Bohm has minus-8. Bregman would also bring a large dose of World Series experience to a club that has been thwarted in the postseason in recent years and hasn't won it all since 2008. The Astros have made it clear that re-signing Bregman is their biggest priority of the offseason, but he isn't expected to make his decision any time soon. MLB.com's Mark Feinsand said during a Reddit AMA on Tuesday that he thinks Bregman's chances of remaining with Houston are 50/50. Although the White Sox didn't move Garrett Crochet prior to the Trade Deadline, there appears to be little doubt about their intentions for the left-hander this offseason. ""They're going to trade him this winter,"" a rival evaluator told ESPN's Buster Olney at the GM Meetings last week. ""It's not a matter of if; it's a question of when."" Olney shed some light on Crochet's potential market in an article for ESPN+ (subscription required) on Wednesday, noting that general manager Chris Getz is looking for ""a package of prospects constructed around at least one high-ceiling youngster to anchor the deal,"" with a preference for that main piece to be a position player. Based on conversations with industry sources, Olney names the Phillies, Padres, Yankees, Dodgers, Braves, Orioles, Red Sox and Mets as teams that could pursue a Crochet trade. You can follow the latest rumblings on Crochet here. ESPN's Jeff Passan breaks down the markets for the key free agents and trade targets in his 2024-25 offseason preview (subscription required). Here's what he's reporting on potential landing spots for some of the top hitters and pitchers available: FA hitters FA pitchers Trade market The players Passan cites as potentially being available on the trade market this winter include: Pitchers -- White Sox ace Garrett Crochet, Brewers closer Devin Williams, Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley, Cardinals right-hander Sonny Gray, Mariners right-hander Luis Castillo, D-backs left-hander Jordan Montgomery, Rockies reliever Justin Lawrence Position players -- Cubs second baseman Nico Hoerner and outfielder Cody Bellinger, Phillies third baseman Alec Bohm, Cardinals third baseman Nolan Arenado, Guardians first baseman Josh Naylor, Rays second baseman Brandon Lowe and first baseman Yandy Díaz, Giants first baseman LaMonte Wade Jr., Rockies second baseman Brendan Rodgers According to a report from USA Today’s Bob Nightengale, Christian Walker is a popular name on the free-agent market, with at least six teams planning to “aggressively pursue” the first baseman. Walker received a qualifying offer from the D-backs, but he will likely decline it. Nightengale names the Yankees, Mets and Nationals as teams that are expected to join Arizona in pursuit of Walker, who should come with a lower price tag than that of fellow free-agent first baseman Pete Alonso, given the age disparity between the two players. (Walker is four years older.) The Yankees and Mets are also two of the top contenders for Juan Soto, the No. 1 free agent on the market, but both clubs need to address first base as well. With his expected price tag, signing Walker likely wouldn't impact either team's pursuit of Soto, who is headed for one of the largest contracts in MLB history. Walker doesn’t have quite the same power as Alonso, but he’s no slouch with the bat, having recorded 95 homers and an .813 OPS over the past three seasons. In that same time, Alonso has produced 120 homers and an .826 OPS. Walker, meanwhile, is a far better defender, winning three straight Gold Gloves and leading his position with +38 Outs Above Average since the beginning of 2022. Alonso has produced -17 OAA in that span. In addition to the teams Nightengale mentioned, the Astros, Twins, Mariners, Cardinals and Padres could also be involved in the first-base market to some extent."
MLB News,"Free agents broken down by tiers, with one alone at the top",https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-free-agents-2024-2025-ranked-by-tiers,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:15:00 GMT",,"Mark Feinsand For the second year in a row, the free-agent class is topped by a clear-cut No. 1 player, with Juan Soto expected to land a record-setting contract in the coming weeks. But the class overall is rather deep, with a number of top starting pitchers and position players seeking nine-figure deals. Below is a list of 125 available players and where they rank in the hierarchy of this year’s free-agent crop. Players are listed alphabetically within each tier, and ages listed are their 2025 seasonal age. MLB offseason signings and trades• Latest free-agent and trade rumors• Top 25 free agents | Every free agent, by position• Tracking every team's offseason moves• Free agent guides: Soto | Burnes | Alonso | Snell | Bregman• Offseason dates, rules & terms explained Juan Soto, OF, age 26When a free agent is expected to land a contract worth approximately twice as much as any other deal this winter, he gets his own tier. Soto is a generational hitter who will instantly make any lineup better, and at 26, he’s only entering the prime of his career. Willy Adames, SS, age 29The best shortstop on the market by a mile, Adames is fresh off a career year in which he set personal bests with 32 home runs and 112 RBIs. His reputation as a clubhouse leader has also caught the attention of executives, setting him up for a nine-figure deal. Pete Alonso, 1B, age 30Alonso has been one of the premier power hitters of the decade, slugging 226 home runs since he debuted in 2019. He has posted at least 4.0 bWAR in three of his five full seasons, while his big postseason moments last month added another line on his free-agent résumé. Alex Bregman, 3B, age 31Following a slow start in 2024, Bregman looked like his old self beginning in mid-May, hitting 25 home runs with 62 RBIs and an .845 OPS over his final 108 games. If you’re looking for a third baseman, Bregman is the cream of the crop. Corbin Burnes, RHP, age 30The top starting pitcher available in a deep market, Burnes is a proven workhorse who has thrown at least 190 innings in each of the past three seasons. The right-hander owns a 52-31 record with a 2.88 ERA and 816 2/3 innings pitched since the start of 2020, trailing only Aaron Nola and Zack Wheeler in the latter category during that time. Max Fried, LHP, age 31An All-Star in two of the past three seasons, Fried has been one of the most consistent starters in the league when healthy. He’s topped the 160-inning mark in four of his past five full seasons, going 54-25 with a 2.81 ERA in 112 starts since the beginning of 2020. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Teoscar Hernández, OF, age 32Hernández settled for a one-year, $23.5 million deal with the Dodgers last winter, but his career-high 33-homer season – in which he made his second career All-Star team – should set him up for a multi-year contract. Anthony Santander, OF, age 30Santander had a monster 2024 season, belting 44 home runs with 102 RBIs and an .814 OPS while making the first All-Star team of his career. He’s also played in at least 152 games in each of the past three seasons, something that should be appealing to interested clubs. Roki Sasaki, RHP, age 23The most intriguing free agent of the offseason, Sasaki offers the most upside at the young age of 23. More importantly, his status as an international amateur player means that teams won’t have to break the bank to sign him – they just need to convince him that they’re the team he should join. Blake Snell, LHP, age 32Free agency didn’t go as planned last year for the two-time Cy Young winner, who settled for a two-year, $62 million deal with the Giants. A stellar second half (5-0, 1.23 ERA over his final 14 starts) should set up Snell for the long-term deal that evaded him last winter. Shane Bieber, RHP, age 30The 2020 AL Cy Young winner had two dominant starts to open his 2024 season, striking out 20 while issuing only one walk over 12 shutout innings. But Tommy John surgery ended his season in mid-April, a procedure that will likely keep him out for the start of 2025. An incentive-based deal could be in play, as could a two-year deal with a smaller base salary in year one. Walker Buehler, RHP, age 30Buehler struggled in his return from his second Tommy John surgery, going 1-6 with a 5.38 ERA in 16 starts last season, but the right-hander salvaged his season in October, throwing 10 scoreless innings over his final two starts and a relief appearance, saving the Dodgers’ World Series clincher. Nathan Eovaldi, RHP, age 35Eovaldi declined a $20 million vesting option following another strong season, his fifth straight with a sub-4.00 ERA. The right-hander – who has two World Series rings and a strong postseason résumé – would be a solid No. 3 option in a contender’s rotation. Carlos Estévez, RHP, age 32A strong first half with the Angels made Estévez one of the most sought-after relievers at the Trade Deadline, and the Phillies dealt a pair of their top pitching prospects for the closer. The former All-Star pitched well after the trade and should garner significant interest this winter. Jack Flaherty, RHP, age 29Flaherty signed a one-year, $14 million deal with the Tigers last winter, pitched well during the first half and was traded to the Dodgers before the Trade Deadline. With no Draft-pick compensation attached to him, the right-hander should be able to parlay his strong season into a multi-year deal. Jeff Hoffman, RHP, age 32Hoffman bounced between the rotation and bullpen during the first seven years of his career in Colorado and Cincinnati, but he settled into a late-inning role with the Phillies in 2023, posting back-to-back stellar seasons (2.28 ERA, 184 ERA+), while making his first All-Star team in 2024. Clay Holmes, RHP, age 32An All-Star in 2022 and 2024, Holmes has had a superb run since being traded to the Yankees in 2021. The righty has a 2.69 ERA and 74 saves over 220 appearances, though his second-half struggles last season forced the Yankees to remove him from the closer role down the stretch. Holmes rebounded in October, getting important outs during New York’s run to the World Series. Max Kepler, OF, age 32It’s been five years since Kepler’s breakout 2019 season, during which he set career highs with 36 home runs and 90 RBIs. He might have to settle for a one-year pillow deal to reestablish his value, but Kepler remains a solid defender with 25-home run power, making him a solid risk-reward candidate. Yusei Kikuchi, LHP, age 34Kikuchi excelled following a midseason trade to the Astros, going 5-1 with a 2.70 ERA for Houston in 10 starts. He’s averaged more than 170 innings over the past two seasons and has made at least 29 starts in four of his five full seasons in the Majors, giving teams a chance to add a steady mid-rotation presence. Ha-Seong Kim, INF, age 29Even after undergoing shoulder surgery in September, Kim is the second-best shortstop on this year’s market behind Adames. It’s unclear whether he’ll be ready to start the season, but at 29 years old, the former Gold Glove winner should be able to land a multi-year contract. Sean Manaea, LHP, age 33After opting out of the final year of his contract and turning down the qualifying offer, Manaea will have Draft-pick compensation attached to him. The left-hander had an outstanding season in his first year with the Mets, putting him in position to land a far bigger deal than the two-year, $28 million contract he signed with New York last winter. Tyler O’Neill, OF, age 30O’Neill’s breakout 2021 season with the Cardinals saw him post a 6.1 bWAR with 34 home runs and a .912 OPS, but the outfielder wasn’t able to have similar success in either 2022 or 2023. A change of scenery did wonders for O’Neill, who belted 31 homers with an .847 OPS in 113 games for the Red Sox, setting him up for a nice free-agent deal. Joc Pederson, DH, age 33Pederson remains one of the most lethal bats in the league against right-handed pitching, bashing 22 home runs with a .923 OPS in 407 such plate appearances last season. His overall .908 OPS at age-32 was a career-best, though his DH-only status will likely force him to sign another one-year deal. Nick Pivetta, RHP, age 32Pivetta was a surprising recipient of the qualifying offer, which he declined, but the right-hander has been a steady presence in the Boston rotation for the past four years. He has posted an above-average ERA+ in three of those four full seasons, and while he isn’t a No. 1 or 2 starter for most clubs, he can help stabilize almost any rotation. Jurickson Profar, OF, age 32Profar posted a career year at the age of 31, making his first All-Star team with the Padres in 2024. Profar had career highs in home runs (24), RBIs (85), OPS (.839) and bWAR (3.7) after signing a one-year, $1 million contract last winter, but he should command a multi-year deal this offseason. Tanner Scott, LHP, age 30Scott was one of the best relievers in the league last season, posting a 1.18 ERA with 18 saves for the Marlins before being dealt to the Padres prior to the Trade Deadline. He pitched well in a setup role for San Diego, but in a market short on proven closers, the 30-year-old should have a number of suitors. Luis Severino, RHP, age 31Severino rebounded from a disastrous 2023 season, going 11-7 with a 3.91 ERA after signing a one-year, $13 million deal with the Mets. Severino declined a qualifying offer, so he’ll have Draft-pick compensation attached to him this winter, but the right-hander should have a healthy market. Gleyber Torres, 2B, age 28An All-Star in his first two seasons in the Majors, Torres has been an enigma during the past five years. He hasn’t come close to matching his career-high 38-homer season of 2019, but Torres hit 49 home runs from 2022-2023 before dropping to 15 last season. A change of scenery could help Torres, who has been a polarizing presence in the Yankees’ lineup in recent years. Christian Walker, 1B, age 34Walker has blossomed into one of the best all-around first basemen in the game, winning a Gold Glove Award in each of the past three seasons. Since the start of 2022, he has an .813 OPS while averaging 32 home runs and 94 RBIs per season. He’s likely looking at a three-year deal due to his age, but Walker will be in high demand. Shawn Armstrong, RHP, age 34Matthew Boyd, LHP, age 34Alex Cobb, RHP, age 37Michael Conforto, OF, age 32Paul DeJong, INF, age 31Dylan Floro, RHP, age 34Paul Goldschmidt, 1B, age 37Andrew Heaney, LHP, age 34Kyle Higashioka, C, age 35Jose Iglesias, INF, age 35Clayton Kershaw, LHP, age 37Hye-Seong Kim, 2B, age 26Michael Lorenzen, RHP, age 33J.D.

MLB News,12 decline qualifying offer; N. Martinez accepts,https://www.mlb.com/news/2024-25-qualifying-offer-candidates-and-decisions,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024 22:35:00 GMT",,"Thomas Harrigan Thirteen players were tendered a qualifying offer (a one-year, $21.05 million deal for 2025) this offseason, but Reds right-hander Nick Martinez was the only one who accepted prior to Tuesday's 4 p.m. ET deadline. Players who accept qualifying offers are signed with their teams for the next season at the designated value. Those who don't accept remain free agents, and if a new team signs them, their old team receives Draft pick compensation. Since the system was implemented in 2012, only 14 players to receive a QO have accepted it. Here's a breakdown of this year's decisions, as well as the 2025 Draft compensation each club will receive for losing a QO free agent to another team. ACCEPTED QUALIFYING OFFER Nick Martinez, SP/RP (Reds)Martinez recorded a 3.10 ERA over 142 1/3 innings in the first season of a two-year, $26 million deal with the Reds, including an impressive 2.42 ERA in 11 starts after joining Cincinnati’s injury-riddled rotation on a full-time basis this past August. The 34-year-old, who has notched a 3.31 ERA in three seasons since returning from a stint in Japan, opted out of his contract to become a free agent at the end of the campaign but will be back with the Reds in 2025. DECLINED QUALIFYING OFFER Willy Adames, SS (Brewers)Adames had a huge walk year in 2024, producing career highs in homers (32), RBIs (112) and steals (21) with a .794 OPS (118 OPS+) over 161 games. The 29-year-old is tied with Corey Seager for first among shortstops with 112 home runs since the beginning of 2021. Brewers' Draft compensation if Adames signs elsewhere: Pick after the completion of Competitive Balance Round A (if he signs for at least $50 million); pick after Competitive Balance Round B (if he signs for less than $50 million) Pete Alonso, 1B (Mets)Alonso has been one of baseball’s top power hitters since his 2019 debut, ranking second in the Majors behind Aaron Judge with 226 home runs in that time. The durable first baseman, who owns a lifetime .854 OPS, has never finished a full season (excluding 2020) with fewer than 34 dingers. Mets’ Draft compensation if Alonso signs elsewhere: Pick after the completion of Round 4 Alex Bregman, 3B (Astros)Bregman is set to reach free agency for the first time after nine seasons with the Astros, during which he helped the team win seven American League West titles, three pennants and two World Series championships. Although he has yet to revisit his 2018-19 apex (72 HR, 157 OPS+, 16.8 WAR), the 30-year-old has remained one of MLB’s most productive third basemen in recent years. Bregman got off to a slow start in 2024, but he still finished with 26 homers, a .768 OPS (118 OPS+) and 4.1 WAR (per Baseball-Reference). Astros’ Draft compensation if Bregman signs elsewhere: Pick after the completion of Round 4 Corbin Burnes, SP (Orioles)Burnes lived up to expectations after being traded from the Brewers to the Orioles in the offseason, earning his fourth straight All-Star selection and finishing with a 2.92 ERA and 181 strikeouts over 194 1/3 innings. The 2021 National League Cy Young Award winner has posted a 2.88 ERA over the past five seasons, ranking third in the Majors with 816 2/3 innings in that span. Orioles' Draft compensation if Burnes signs elsewhere: Pick after the completion of Competitive Balance Round A (if he signs for at least $50 million); pick after Competitive Balance Round B (if he signs for less than $50 million) Max Fried, SP (Braves)Fried doesn’t miss bats at an elite level, but that hasn’t stopped him from recording the best ERA+ (151) among pitchers with at least 500 innings since the beginning of 2020. The southpaw made 29 starts with a 3.25 ERA and 166 K’s over 174 1/3 innings in 2024, bouncing back from an injury-shortened 2023 season. Braves’ Draft compensation if Fried signs elsewhere: Pick after the completion of Round 4 Teoscar Hernández, OF (Dodgers)Hernández signed a one-year, $23.5 million deal with the Dodgers last offseason and went on to record a career-high 33 homers with an .840 OPS, up 99 points from the .741 OPS he posted with the Mariners in 2023. The right-handed slugger has recorded 180 home runs with a 122 OPS+ for the Blue Jays, Mariners and Dodgers since the start of the 2018 campaign. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Dodgers’ Draft compensation if Hernández signs elsewhere: Pick after the completion of Round 4 Sean Manaea, SP (Mets)After pitching to a 4.73 ERA over 67 appearances (38 starts) for the Padres and Giants in 2022-23, Manaea rejuvenated his career with the Mets in his age-32 campaign. The left-hander tossed a career-high 181 2/3 innings and finished the regular season with a 3.47 ERA and 184 strikeouts. As expected, he opted out of the final year on his two-year, $28 million deal with New York after the season. Mets’ Draft compensation if Manaea signs elsewhere: Pick after the completion of Round 4 Nick Pivetta, SP (Red Sox)Pivetta, 31, posted a 4.14 ERA over 27 appearances (26 starts) for Boston in 2024, though his expected ERA was well below that, at 3.59. His 28.9% strikeout rate ranked in the 88th percentile among qualifying pitchers, and his 6.1% walk rate placed him in the 80th percentile. He made his MLB debut with the Phillies in 2007, and he was traded to the Red Sox during the pandemic-shortened 2020 campaign. Pivetta made two starts for Boston that season, and from 2021-24, he pitched to a 4.33 ERA (102 ERA+) over 129 outings (105 starts). Red Sox’s Draft compensation if Pivetta signs elsewhere: Pick after the completion of Competitive Balance Round B Anthony Santander, OF (Orioles)Santander erupted for a career-high 44 home runs with 102 RBIs and an .814 OPS (134 OPS+) over 155 games in 2024. The slugger ranked third in the Majors in homers and became the eighth switch-hitter in MLB history to belt 40-plus dingers in a single season. Orioles' Draft compensation if Santander signs elsewhere: Pick after the completion of Competitive Balance Round A (if he signs for at least $50 million); pick after Competitive Balance Round B (if he signs for less than $50 million) Luis Severino, SP (Mets)Severino’s tenure with the Yankees ended on a sour note, with the right-hander recording a 6.65 ERA in 2023. However, he found new life across town after signing a one-year, $13 million deal with the Mets in free agency, staying healthy and posting a 3.91 ERA over 182 innings -- his highest total since 2018. Mets’ Draft compensation if Severino signs elsewhere: Pick after the completion of Round 4 Juan Soto, OF (Yankees)Soto delivered another standout year in 2024, producing a career-high 41 homers with 109 RBIs, 129 walks, 128 runs scored and a .989 OPS following a trade from the Padres to the Yankees. The disciplined slugger is on a Hall of Fame path, having recorded 201 homers, 592 RBIs, 769 walks and a .953 OPS (160 OPS+) through his age-25 season. He'll be the top free agent on the board this offseason. Yankees’ Draft compensation if Soto signs elsewhere: Pick after the completion of Round 4 Christian Walker (D-backs)A late-bloomer who has appeared in parts of 10 big league seasons -- the past eight with Arizona -- Walker is set to reach free agency for the first time at the age of 33. The right-handed slugger has quietly become one of the game’s best first basemen, pairing a potent bat with elite glove work. Since the beginning of 2022, Walker has recorded 95 homers and an .813 OPS (123 OPS+) while leading his position with +38 Outs Above Average. D-backs' Draft compensation if Walker signs elsewhere: Pick after the completion of Competitive Balance Round A (if he signs for at least $50 million); pick after Competitive Balance Round B (if he signs for less than $50 million) NOTABLE PLAYERS WHO DID NOT RECEIVE QO Cardinals: 1B Paul GoldschmidtDodgers: RHP Walker BuehlerGuardians: RHP Shane BieberPadres: OF Jurickson Profar, UTIL Ha-Seong KimRed Sox: OF Tyler O'NeillYankees: 2B Gleyber Torres INELIGIBLE FOR QUALIFYING OFFER Not every free agent can receive a QO. Players who have previously received a QO are ineligible, which means the following free agents were not eligible to receive one: Alex Cobb (Guardians), Michael Conforto (Giants), Patrick Corbin (Nationals), Nathan Eovaldi (Rangers), Yasmani Grandal (Pirates), Jason Heyward (Astros), Kenley Jansen (Red Sox), Lance Lynn (Cardinals), Joc Pederson (D-backs), Martín Pérez (Padres), Marcell Ozuna (Braves), Anthony Rizzo (Yankees), Carlos Santana (Twins), Max Scherzer (Rangers), Will Smith (Royals), Blake Snell (Giants), Justin Turner (Mariners), Justin Verlander (Astros) Players who weren't continuously with an organization, either in the Minors or Majors, from Opening Day until the end of the regular season are also ineligible. Notable free agents in this category who weren’t mentioned above include: Matthew Boyd (Guardians), Josh Bell (D-backs), Mark Canha (Giants), Paul DeJong (Royals), Carlos Estévez (Phillies), Jack Flaherty (Dodgers), Danny Jansen (Red Sox), Jakob Junis (Reds), Yusei Kikuchi (Astros), Michael Lorenzen (Royals), Frankie Montas (Brewers), Tommy Pham (Royals), Amed Rosario (Reds), Tanner Scott (Padres), Jesse Winker (Mets) Compensation for losing players who reject their QO If a team gives a qualifying offer to a player who then signs elsewhere, the club that lost the player is eligible for Draft pick compensation the following year. • Competitive Balance Tax payors: If the team that loses the player went over the CBT threshold, the compensation pick will be placed after the fourth round has been completed. The value of the player's contract doesn't matter in this case. • Revenue-sharing recipients: If the team that loses the player is a revenue-sharing recipient, based on its revenues and market size, then the selection -- if and only if the lost player signs for at least $50 million -- will be awarded a pick between the first round and Competitive Balance Round A of the MLB Draft. If the player signs for less than $50 million, the compensation pick for those teams would come after Competitive Balance Round B, which follows the second round. • All other teams: If the team that loses the player does not receive revenue sharing and did not exceed the CBT salary threshold the previous season, its compensatory pick will come after Competitive Balance Round B. The value of the player's contract doesn't matter in this case. Penalties for signing players who reject their QO Any team that signs a player who has rejected a qualifying offer is subject to the loss of one or more Draft picks. However, a team's highest first-round pick is exempt from forfeiture. (Players who are unsigned after the start of the MLB Draft in the year that follows the rejection of their qualifying offer are no longer tied to Draft pick compensation and can be signed without their new club needing to forfeit a Draft pick.) Three tiers of Draft pick forfeiture -- based on the financial status of the signing team -- are in place to serve as a penalty for signing a player who rejected a qualifying offer: • Competitive Balance Tax payors: A team that exceeded the CBT threshold in the preceding season will lose its second- and fifth-highest selections in the following year's Draft, as well as $1 million from its international bonus pool for the upcoming signing period. If such a team signs multiple qualifying-offer free agents, it will forfeit its third- and sixth-highest picks as well. • Revenue-sharing recipients: A team that receives revenue-sharing money will lose its third-highest selection in the following year's Draft. If it signs two such players, it will also forfeit its fourth-highest pick. • All other teams: If a team does not receive revenue sharing and did not exceed the CBT salary threshold in the previous season, it will lose its second-highest selection in the following year's Draft, as well as $500,000 from its international bonus pool for the upcoming signing period. If one of these teams signs two such players, it will also forfeit its third-highest pick. These are classifications for each team that will determine the Draft picks they receive (for a departing QO player) or forfeit (for signing a QO player). Competitive Balance Tax payors: Astros, Blue Jays, Braves, Cubs, Dodgers, Mets, Phillies, Rangers, Yankees Revenue-sharing recipients: Athletics, Brewers, D-backs, Guardians, Mariners, Marlins, Orioles, Pirates, Rays, Reds, Rockies, Royals, Tigers, Twins All other clubs: Angels, Cardinals, Giants, Nationals, Padres, Red Sox, White Sox"
MLB News,Stallings returns to Rockies on deal with option for '26,https://www.mlb.com/news/jacob-stallings-rockies-deal,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:28:00 GMT",,"Thomas Harding DENVER – Hoping to build on a bounce-back 2024 season, catcher Jacob Stallings on Wednesday re-signed with the Rockies on a one-year contract that includes a mutual option for 2026. The deal guarantees Stallings $2 million, while the option is worth $2 million and carries a $500,000 buyout, a source told MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. The club hasn't confirmed the value of the deal. Stallings, who turns 35 on Dec. 22, set full-season career highs in batting (.263), OBP (.357), slugging (.453), OPS (.810) and home runs (nine) in essentially 50 percent of the playing time at the position. Brought in to share time with veteran Elias Díaz in ‘24, Stallings will catch in tandem with a younger partner in ‘25. Hunter Goodman, a rookie last year, and Rockies No. 8 prospect Drew Romo received playing time in 2024, mostly after Díaz was released in mid-August (he finished the season with the Padres). Willie MacIver and Braxton Fulford will be vying to make their Major League debuts. A Gold Glove winner with the Pirates in 2021, Stallings has embraced catching in a shared role. Stallings turned down a mutual option after the season, but the plan was for him to re-sign. “It was a fun year,” Stallings said. “The familiarity of knowing the guys and knowing the coaches and knowing the front office like that was a huge factor. My kids made friends, and you just build the relationships. That was a huge, huge draw to Denver. And, yeah, I felt great about my year. “I would love to build on the offensive success that I had, and it really helped take that next step forward. It showed in our play toward the end of the year.” Stallings also upheld his defensive reputation by throwing out a career-high 12 runners attempting to steal – 12th most among NL catchers, despite his part-time duty."
MLB News,Japanese ace Sugano drawing interest from a West Coast team (report),https://www.mlb.com/news/tomoyuki-sugano-rumors,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 01:40:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and rumors surrounding Yomiuri Giants ace Tomoyuki Sugano, who is expected to become an MLB free agent this offseason. Nov. 19: Sugano drawing interest from Angels (report)Roki Sasaki isn't the only marquee Japanese pitcher who is expected to make the jump to the Majors this offseason. The 35-year-old Sugano doesn't possess Sasaki's top-notch velocity, but as a two-time winner of the Sawamura Award -- the Japanese equivalent to the Cy Young Award -- Sugano should have his fair share of suitors. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi has identified one team to watch for Sugano: the Angels. ""I've heard there is some interest there,"" Morosi said during Monday's edition of Hot Stove. Morosi went on to compare Sugano to Hiroki Kuroda, another Japanese right-hander who came to the Majors in his mid-30s and had a solid seven-year career from 2008-14 with the Dodgers and Yankees. Kuroda produced a 3.45 career ERA and averaged 188 innings per season. The Angels, who have had a pretty busy offseason so far, ranked 28th in starter ERA this past season (4.97). Sugano posted a 1.67 ERA over 156 2/3 innings with the Yomiuri Giants in 2024. Oct. 4: Sugano set to become MLB free agentAfter over a decade in Nippon Professional Baseball, Sugano will finally come to MLB in 2025, according to a report from ESPN's Jeff Passan on Friday. Sugano would be an international free agent, so he will not need to be posted by the Yomiuri Giants, and he will not be subject to the contract negotiation rules of the Japanese posting system. The veteran right-hander, who turns 35 on Oct. 11, has been one of the best pitchers in Japan over his 12-season career in NPB. In that time, Sugano has gone 136-74 with a 2.43 ERA and 1,585 strikeouts. He is a two-time MVP of NPB's Central League, winning in 2014 and 2020, and a two-time winner of the Sawamura Award -- Japan's version of the Cy Young -- in 2017 and 2018. Sugano was actually posted by Yomiuri before, in 2020, with the intent of coming to the Major Leagues then. But he did not agree to a deal with an MLB team by the end of the posting window, and he returned to Japan to continue to pitch for the Giants, where he's been his entire professional career."

Wheeler went 16-7 with a 2.57 ERA over 200 innings this season, recording 224 strikeouts with a 6.1 bWAR and a 5.4 fWAR. He led qualified NL pitchers in WHIP (0.96), opponents’ batting average (.192), opponents’ on-base percentage (.253), opponents’ OPS (.581), opponents’ wOBA (.256), quality starts (26) and starts of six-plus innings (26). He trailed the Braves' Chris Sale, who won the award, by only 0.1 bWAR for the NL lead among pitchers. He trailed Sale by 1.0 fWAR for the NL lead. But Wheeler also made three more starts, faced 85 more batters (787 to 702) and threw 22 1/3 more innings than Sale, who was limited to 177 2/3 innings because of a late-season injury."

On Wednesday, Skenes finished third in the NL Cy Young Award voting, behind winner Chris Sale of the Braves and Philadelphia’s Zack Wheeler. Skenes earned one second-place vote, with a total 53 voting points, after going 11-3 with a 1.96 ERA and 170 strikeouts in 133 innings during his rookie season. The right-handed flamethrower’s impact from the mound was apparent each time that he started, even earning a start at the All-Star Game for the National League squad."
MLB News,The greatest pitchers without a Cy Young Award,https://www.mlb.com/news/greatest-pitchers-to-never-win-cy-young-award,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 23:29:00 GMT",,"Thomas Harrigan Some of the greatest pitchers in baseball history never won the position’s most prestigious individual honor: the Cy Young Award, which was established in 1956. Until Wednesday, when the 2024 Cy Young Award winners were announced on MLB Network, Chris Sale was on that list. But the Braves left-hander finally took the honor with a stellar 2024 campaign that saw him win the pitching Triple Crown in the National League. The Cy Young triumph was a long time coming for Sale, who logged seven straight top-six finishes in the American League voting without a win from 2012-18 before dealing with a myriad of injuries across 2019-23. Below, you'll find a breakdown of the best pitchers without a Cy Young on their résumé, from the legends who pitched before the award was introduced, to the all-time greats who had a chance but never won, to the active aces who have come close but haven’t been able to seal the deal. (Pitchers in each category listed in order by bWAR) The best Modern Era (since 1900) pitchers who played before the advent of the Cy Young Award, not including the award's namesake. Walter Johnson, 1907-27 (164.5 bWAR) If there was an award for the best pitcher in Johnson's time, ""The Big Train"" -- and not Young -- might have racked up more than anyone else. Johnson led the American League in ERA five times, in wins six times and in strikeouts a whopping 12 times. He also won the pitching Triple Crown three times and was a two-time AL MVP, in the days before the modern MVP Award when repeat winners were rare. All time, Johnson ranks second in bWAR (164.5) and wins (417), is tied for seventh (min. 1,000 innings) in ERA+ (147) and is ninth in strikeouts (3,509). Grover Cleveland Alexander, 1911-30 (119 bWAR) While Johnson dominated the AL from 1907-27, ""Old Pete"" was arguably the best the NL had to offer for much of that time. Like Johnson, Alexander led his league in ERA five times and in wins six times, and he won three pitching Triple Crowns. In terms of ERA+, his best season came in 1915, as the righty went 31-10 with a 1.22 ERA (225 ERA+), a 0.84 WHIP and 241 K's over 376 1/3 innings for the Phillies. Alexander finished his 20-year career with 373 wins (tied for third all time) and 119 bWAR (15th). Lefty Grove, 1925-41 (106.7 bWAR) Grove's success was virtually unrivaled in the first two decades of the live ball era, which began in 1920. As offense exploded around baseball, Grove led his league in ERA an MLB-record nine times, winning the Triple Crown in two of those years. Grove was named AL MVP in 1931, as he went 31-4 with a 2.06 ERA and 175 strikeouts in 288 2/3 innings, notching one of just four 30-win seasons since the beginning of the live ball era. The southpaw's lifetime 148 ERA+ is the third best in history among pitchers with at least 2,000 frames. Christy Mathewson, 1900-16 (106 bWAR) Mathewson first arrived on the scene in 1900 and pitched for 17 years, going 373-188 with a 2.13 ERA over 636 games. Spending nearly his entire career with the Giants, the righty led the NL in ERA five times and in wins four times, winning the Triple Crown twice. When the very first Hall of Fame class was inducted in 1936, Mathewson was enshrined alongside the likes of Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Honus Wagner and Johnson. Carl Hubbell, 1928-43 (68.2 bWAR) There's a case to be made for several others in this fifth spot, but we'll go with Hubbell. The left-hander is perhaps most famous for striking out five future Hall of Famers in succession during the 1934 All-Star Game, but he was also a two-time NL MVP and a three-time league ERA champion. In his first MVP season in 1933, Hubbell led the NL in ERA (1.66), WHIP (0.98), innings (308 2/3) and wins (23). Others: Robin Roberts, Bob Feller, Hal Newhouser, Mordecai Brown, Rube Waddell Note: Roberts pitched for 11 years after the Cy Young Award was established, but his best seasons were mostly before that point, and his last year (1966) came before the award was given to the best pitcher in each league (rather than to one pitcher representing all of MLB). The best retired pitchers who played after 1956 and never won a Cy Young. Bert Blyleven, 1970-92 (94.5 bWAR)Closest calls: AL 3rd place; 1984, '85 Despite recording 287 wins, a 3.31 ERA and 3,701 strikeouts over 22 seasons in the Majors, Blyleven lasted on the Hall of Fame ballot for more than a decade before finally getting elected in his 14th year of eligibility. If he had won a Cy Young Award or two, it might not have taken him so long. Blyleven's best season was undoubtedly 1973, as he won 20 games and posted a 2.52 ERA with 258 strikeouts in 325 innings. But his best chance of actually winning the Cy Young was arguably 1984 (19-7, 2.87 ERA), when he finished in third place behind two relievers -- Willie Hernandez and Dan Quisenberry. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Mike Mussina, 1991-2008 (82.8 bWAR)Closest call: AL 2nd place, 1999 Mussina had an ERA+ of 125 or better in 12 different seasons, but he was never quite the best pitcher in the league, at least in the eyes of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Part of the problem was that Mussina's AL contemporaries were some of the greatest pitchers ever, including Pedro Martinez, Roger Clemens and Randy Johnson. That said, Mussina did top Clemens in ERA, WHIP, bWAR, innings and strikeouts in 2001, when Clemens won the AL Cy Young Award on the strength of his 20-3 record. Mussina, who went 17-11, finished fifth. Nolan Ryan, 1966-93 (81.3 bWAR)Closest call: AL 2nd place, 1973 You may be surprised to learn that Ryan never claimed a Cy Young Award, as his name is practically synonymous with the type of hard-throwing, fire-breathing aces that so often win. The closest Ryan got was 1973, the year he went 21-16 with a 2.87 ERA and 383 strikeouts -- a single-season record in the modern era. In a close race, Ryan came in second behind Jim Palmer (22-9, 2.40 ERA, 158 K's), whose Orioles went 97-65 while Ryan's Angels went 79-83. Ryan finished his career with 5,714 strikeouts, which ranks first all time. Curt Schilling, 1988-2007 (79.5 bWAR)Closest calls: NL 2nd place; 2001, '02, '04 There have been only five instances in MLB history of teammates finishing first and second in the Cy Young Award voting; Randy Johnson and Schilling were involved in two of them with the D-backs, and Schilling was second both times. Schilling also had an outstanding 2004 season (21-6, 3.26 ERA, 203 K's) after being traded to the Red Sox, but once again came in second, as Johan Santana took the top spot with a 20-6 record, a 2.61 ERA and 265 strikeouts. Juan Marichal, 1960-1975 (62.9 bWAR)Closest call: NL 8th place, 1971 With his signature leg kick and deep arsenal, Marichal had nine All-Star seasons (10 selections overall) from 1962-71, notching a 2.65 ERA with 1,940 strikeouts and 531 walks in 2,805 innings for the Giants during that stretch. Unfortunately for the Dominican Dandy, only one Cy Young Award was given out until 1967, and some of his contemporaries in the NL included Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, Bob Gibson, Tom Seaver and Steve Carlton. As a result, 1971 was the only year he received any recognition from Cy Young voters. Others: Phil Niekro, Don Sutton, Luis Tiant, Kevin Brown, Andy Pettitte, Mark Buehrle, Tim Hudson, Dave Stieb, Roy Oswalt, Cole Hamels, Jon Lester, Adam Wainwright The best active pitchers with at least 1,000 innings who haven't won a Cy Young Award but still have a reasonable chance to do it. Aaron Nola, 2015-present (35.3 bWAR)Closest call: NL 3rd place, 2018 One of baseball's most durable pitchers, Nola struck out more than 220 batters four times from 2018-22, throwing at least 200 innings in three of those years. The right-hander turned in one of his best seasons in 2022, leading MLB with an 8.1 K/BB ratio and recording a 3.25 ERA with a 0.96 WHIP and 235 K’s over 205 frames. Though his performance slipped a bit in 2023 (4.46 ERA), he still threw 193 2/3 innings, fanned 202 batters and notched a 1.15 WHIP. He followed that up with a 3.57 ERA and 197 strikeouts over 199 1/3 innings in 2024. Zack Wheeler, 2013-present (35.2 bWAR)Closest calls: NL 2nd place; 2021, '24 Wheeler has posted a 2.94 ERA, a 9.8 K/9 and a 2.0 BB/9 in five seasons since he joined the Phillies as a free agent, establishing himself as one of the top pitchers in the game during that time. Wheeler fell just short of the NL Cy Young Award in 2021, splitting first-place votes with winner Corbin Burnes and finishing 10 vote points behind the then-Brewers right-hander. His final numbers that year were brilliant, as he led MLB in innings (213 1/3) and the NL in K’s (247) while recording a 2.78 ERA and a 1.01 WHIP. Wheeler delivered another outstanding season in 2024 (2.57 ERA, 224 K's) but was once again the runner-up in the NL Cy voting, this time to Chris Sale. Yu Darvish, 2012-present (33.1 bWAR)Closest call: AL 2nd place, 2013; NL 2nd place, 2020 Darvish placed second in the 2020 NL Cy race and was a candidate to win in 2021 before struggling in the second half and finishing with a 4.22 ERA. He rebounded to post a 3.10 ERA over 30 starts in 2022, but made just 40 starts combined in 2023-24. With a diverse arsenal that has helped him register one of the highest lifetime K/9 marks (10.6) in MLB history, Darvish might still have what it takes to go Cy hunting. But the 38-year-old is running out of time. Kevin Gausman, 2013-present (23.8 bWAR)Closest call: AL 3rd place, 2023 While Gausman was selected fourth overall in the 2012 MLB Draft by the Orioles and made his MLB debut less than a year later, he didn’t receive a Cy Young vote for the first time until 2021, when he was on his fourth team. The late-blooming righty finished sixth in the NL voting that year and ninth in the AL in 2022 before earning a third-place AL finish in 2023, when he led the league in strikeouts (237) and notched a 3.16 ERA over 185 innings. He took a step back in 2024, however, recording a 3.83 ERA with 162 strikeouts over 181 innings. Luis Castillo, 2017-present (23.5 bWAR)Closest call: AL 5th place, 2023 A three-time All-Star, Castillo received Cy Young votes for the first time in his career after finishing 2023 with a 3.34 ERA, 219 strikeouts and a 1.10 WHIP over 197 innings for the Mariners. The right-hander regressed some in 2024 (3.64 ERA, 175 K's), but it wouldn’t be a surprise to see him one day hoist the Cy Young Award. Others: Sonny Gray, Nathan Eovaldi, Carlos Rodón"
MLB News,Here's the 2024 All-Arizona Fall League Team,https://www.mlb.com/news/all-arizona-fall-league-team-2024,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 02:13:00 GMT",,"Jonathan Mayo Season No. 32 of the Arizona Fall League is in the books, with the Salt River Rafters beating the Surprise Saguaros, 3-2, in the Championship Game on Saturday. It was another fall full of top prospects and top performances. Below is the 2024 MLB Pipeline All-AFL Team. This is based solely on performance during the six-week league, and a ranking of top prospects focusing more on long-term value will be coming Friday. More on the Arizona Fall League:• Complete coverage | Schedule | Tickets | Teams | Shop C: Moises Ballesteros, Mesa (CHC No. 4/MLB No. 44)He’s hit pretty much everywhere he’s been -- and that includes the Fall League, where he posted a .316/.376/.557 line over 19 games. He continued to draw walks (10.8 percent of the time) and limit strikeouts (16.1 percent) while finishing tied for sixth with five homers and seventh in total bases (44).Honorable mention: Creed Willems (BAL) 1B: Josue Briceño, Scottdale (DET No. 9)In perhaps the greatest campaign the Fall League has seen, Briceño won the league’s first-ever Triple Crown and was, unsurprisingly, chosen as the AFLs MVP. He finished with a .433/.509/.867 to go along with 10 homers and 27 RBIs, leading the circuit in all of those categories except on-base percentage as well as extra-base hits (17), total bases (78) and hits (39).Honorable mention: Niko Kavadas (LAA), Otto Kemp (PHI), Nick Kurtz (ATH) 2B: Thomas Saggese, Glendale (STL No. 4)One of the Fall Leaguers with big league time under his belt, Saggese certainly looked like he’s ready to at least compete for the Cards’ second-base job next spring. He finished with a .391/.524/.594 line and his 1.118 OPS placed him fourth in the entire league. He finished with more walks (16) than strikeouts (15) over 18 games.Honorable mention: Tommy Troy (AZ) 3B: Caleb Durbin, Salt River (Not ranked on NYY Top 30)Not only did Durbin help the Rafters win a ring, he set the record for stolen bases in a season. The Breakout Player of the Year went 29-for-30 in steal attempts while also hitting .312/.427/.548 with five homers and 21 RBIs. He played five positions this fall, the most at third base but he might fit best at second, and to that end, Yankees GM Brian Cashman mentioned him as a potential internal candidate to be in the Opening Day lineup there.Honorable mention: Jonathon Long (CHC) SS: Colt Emerson, Peoria (SEA No. 1/MLB No. 27)The Mariners understandably erred on the side of caution by sending Emerson home early due to a minor hamstring issue, so he only played in 13 games. But he did plenty to show why he’s considered one of the best infield prospects in the game, posting a .370/.435/.537 line. Only 19 years old, he hit nine doubles and was a perfect 9-for-9 in stolen bases.Honorable mention: Max Acosta (TEX), Kervin Pichardo (PIT) Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. More from MLB Pipeline:• Top 100 prospects | Stats | Video | Podcast | Complete coverage OF: Denzel Clarke, Mesa (ATH No. 10)The second time really was the charm. Clarke played in the Fall League in 2022 and came back this year as the A’s gave him one last look before adding him to their 40-man roster Tuesday. The toolsy outfielder hit .382/.495/.566 over 19 games, with seven extra-base hits and nine steals. OF: Sammy Siani, Scottsdale (Not ranked on PIT Top 30)The swing change that brought a much flatter bat path and enabled Siani to hit his way out of High-A Greensboro and up to Double-A for the first time was on display all fall. The left-handed hitter posted a .375/.457/.550 line with three homers and six steals while showing he can handle all three outfield spots very well defensively. OF: Tre’ Morgan, Mesa (TB No. 10)Arguably the best defensive first baseman in the Minors, Morgan played left field exclusively this fall (where he played a lot at LSU in 2023) and handled the assignment well. He also swung the bat like he always does: .338/.391/.500 with the same amount of walks as strikeouts.Honorable mention: Alejandro Osuna (TEX), Robert Hassell III (WSH), Kristian Robinson (AZ) DH: Kemp Alderman, Peoria (MIA No. 12)Alderman only played in nine games because he had the audacity to get married in the middle of the AFL season, but what he did in his brief time was certainly noteworthy. He hit six homers in just 36 at-bats, so it’s easy to think he would have challenged Briceño for the home run title.Honorable mention: Chase DeLauter (CLE) SP: Josh Stephan, Surprise (TEX No. 25)The right-hander led all fall hurlers with 20 innings and made the most of them, finishing with a 2.25 ERA (second in the league), a 1.00 WHIP (third), .200 BAA (tied for eighth) while posting a nifty 21/5 K/BB ratio. SP: Andrew Painter, Glendale (PHI No. 2/MLB No. 32)The AFL Pitcher of the Year, Painter’s No. 1 objective was to get his first competitive mound time in two years since hurting his elbow and having Tommy John surgery. The stuff seems to be all the way back and he largely had solid command of all four of his offerings, enabling him to post a 2.30 ERA, 0.89 WHIP, .189 BAA and an 18/4 K/BB ratio over 15 2/3 IP.Honorable mention: Alex Santos (HOU), Samy Natera (LAA) RP: Evan Justice, LHP (not ranked on COL Top 30)With a tip of the cap to Luis Mey, the league’s Reliever of the Year, Justice may have been a touch better. He didn’t allow a hit in nine outings spanning 8 2/3 innings, walking only one and striking out 11.Honorable mention: Luis Mey (CIN), Ryan Jennings (TOR)"
MLB News,"Cubs trade for Thaiss, shore up catching depth",https://www.mlb.com/news/cubs-acquire-matt-thaiss-for-cash-considerations,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 21:57:44 GMT",,"Jordan Bastian CHICAGO -- Given the Cubs’ need for catching depth this offseason, Matt Thaiss became a logical target for the North Siders after the Angels cut ties with him last week. Chicago officially added Thaiss to the fold on Wednesday. The Cubs acquired Thaiss in exchange for a cash consideration from the Angels, who designated the catcher for assignment on Thursday. In order to clear a spot on the 40-man roster, Chicago designated right-hander Trey Wingenter for assignment. The Cubs entered this offseason with Miguel Amaya as the lone catcher on the 40-man roster and made it a goal to build up the catching depth this winter. One of Chicago’s potential targets, veteran Travis d’Arnaud, signed a two-year deal with the Angels in free agency on Nov. 12, moving Thaiss to the roster bubble. After Los Angeles signed free-agent infielder Kevin Newman, the Angels designated Thaiss for assignment. Thaiss is out of Minor League options and eligible for arbitration, but also under control through 2027. If the Cubs do not reel in another catcher (Carson Kelly and Danny Jansen are possible fits in free agency), Thaiss offers a built-in contingency plan. Thaiss, 29, spent the last two seasons as the Angels’ backup catcher, following a multi-year transition to the position he played in college at the University of Virginia. After being picked in the first round (No. 16 overall) in the 2016 Draft, Thaiss focused on first base until adding third to the mix as a Minor Leaguer in ‘19. By the ‘21 campaign, Thaiss began a move back behind the plate. Last season, Thaiss rated as an above-average blocker (four blocking runs above average, per Statcast), but was below average in framing and controlling the running game. Offensively, he slashed .204/.323/.299 for the Angels, but performed better against righties (.671 OPS) than lefties (.456 OPS). The 30-year-old Wingenter appeared in just five games for the Cubs down the stretch after being claimed off waivers from the Red Sox in August. The righty had a 3.00 ERA in six innings for Chicago, and has a 5.66 ERA in 97 career Major League games between stints with the Padres, Tigers, Red Sox and Cubs."
MLB News,White Sox sign OF Slater to 1-year deal,https://www.mlb.com/news/austin-slater-white-sox-contract-free-agent,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 22:51:00 GMT",,"Scott Merkin CHICAGO -- Austin Slater officially joined the 2025 White Sox outfield mix on Wednesday, agreeing to terms on a one-year, $1.75 million contract. Slater, 31, played for the Giants, Reds and Orioles during the 2024 season, slashing .209/.321/.266 with two home runs, 18 RBIs and 24 runs scored in 84 combined games. He finished with the O's and had his best 33-game stretch of the season in Baltimore, where current White Sox director of hitting Ryan Fuller was the co-hitting coach. Austin to Chicago 👋 pic.twitter.com/xIMJ0MybG3 The right-handed hitter has a .271/.364/.429 career slash line in 929 plate appearances against left-handed hurlers, although he slashed .188/.310/.231 when facing southpaws in 2024. Slater has appeared in 230 games in center field, 158 in left, 151 in right, 29 at first base and one each at second base and third base. In Year 2 of this latest rebuild incarnation, the White Sox focus falls upon giving young players a chance to show their capabilities, while the front office assesses their abilities and then figures out where the team needs to make moves. But this particular free agent addition gives manager Will Venable an experienced right-handed bat, having covered eight seasons with three teams, to pair with younger left-handed hitting outfielders Dominic Fletcher, Zach DeLoach and Oscar Colas. With the signing the White Sox 40-man roster increased to 39."
MLB News,How did Skenes' season compare with other ROY pitchers?,https://www.mlb.com/news/ranking-paul-skenes-against-other-rookie-of-the-year-pitchers,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:07:40 GMT",,"Alex Stumpf This story was excerpted from Alex Stumpf’s Pirates Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. On Monday, Paul Skenes’ historic rookie season was recognized by the Baseball Writers' Association of America when he was named as the winner of the National League’s Jackie Robinson Rookie of the Year Award. Looking at his stats, it’s hard to make a case against him. And while we’re looking at those stats, there’s just one question left: Where does Skenes’ rookie season compare to the other Rookie of the Year (ROY) winners? Including Skenes and Luis Gil this year, 42 pitchers have won the award since it was introduced in 1947. Was Skenes’ season among the best? It’s worth a look. Earned run average has been the go-to stat for assessing pitchers for decades, but not every ERA is created equal. Relievers have smaller sample sizes -- Devin Williams recorded a 0.33 ERA in his Rookie of the Year campaign, but pitched only 27 innings in 2020 -- and different eras have different offensive outputs. But it’s a good starting spot. ERA 1. Devin Williams, MIL, 2020 -- 0.332. Gregg Olson, BAL, 1989 -- 1.693. Huston Street, A’s, 2005 -- 1.724. Andrew Bailey, A’s, 2009 -- 1.845. Paul Skenes, 2024 -- 1.96 All four of the pitchers ahead of Skenes were relievers, and his ERA is right in line with them. The lowest ERA for a starter was Stan Bahnsen, who posted a 2.05 ERA in 1968, the so-called Year of the Pitcher. Bahnsen’s ERA+ -- which weighs league output and the ballpark -- that season was 140, meaning it was 40% better than the League average. That’s really good, but is it all-time good? Let’s take a look at pitchers who logged at least 100 innings this time: ERA+ 1. Paul Skenes -- 2142. (tie) José Fernández, MIA, 2013 -- 1762. (tie) Todd Worrell, STL, 1986 -- 176 Expand the sample size and Skenes stands alone among Rookie of the Year winners. His ERA was less than half of the league average of 4.08, something no other starter on this list has done. Strikeouts were Skenes’ calling card, and admittedly, this might be tougher to compare to other pitchers. There are simply more strikeouts in today’s game than in previous decades. Skenes and Tom Seaver both struck out 170 batters their rookie years, but Skenes did it in 133 innings. Seaver did it in 251 innings. Skenes’ 170 strikeouts are tied for 10th in this category, but eight of those ahead of him threw at least 190 innings. Let's look instead at strikeout rates: STRIKEOUTS PER NINE INNINGS 1. Devin Williams -- 17.72. Craig Kimbrel, ATL, 2011 -- 14.83. Kerry Wood, CHC, 1998 -- 12.64. Paul Skenes -- 11.5 Williams’ small sample size strikes again, so Skenes has to settle for fourth here. But what if the ratio is how many strikeouts the pitcher had per walk? STRIKEOUTS PER WALK 1. Devin Williams -- 5.92. Paul Skenes -- 5.33. Craig Kimbrel -- 4 Williams is in front again, but you can see the gap between Skenes and Kimbrel. Nobody else had a four-to-one ratio, and Skenes was more than five to one. Speaking of walks, keeping runners off the bases is half the battle. Again, Skenes is near the top of the list at doing that. Walks and Hits per nine innings 1. Devin Williams -- 0.632. (tie) Andrew Bailey -- 0.882. (tie) Neftalí Feliz, TEX, 2009 -- 0.884. Paul Skenes -- 0.95 Here’s Skenes hanging out with the relievers again. Fernández was the previous record holder for starters at 0.98, and they’re the only two ROY pitchers who averaged less than one base runner per inning. But what about wins? Skenes’ 11 wins is pretty pedestrian, but it came with only three losses. How does his winning percentage rank among pitchers who started at least 20 games? Winning percentage for starting pitchers 1. Paul Skenes -- .7862. Bob Grim, NYY, 1954 -- .7693. Gary Peters, CHW, 1963 -- .704 Skenes may have only won 11 games, but when you pair it with just three losses, it makes him the most effective starter at getting the W. Finally, the big one: Wins Above Replacement (WAR), the usual go-to stat for comparing players from different eras. The problem is that it is also dependent on sample size. Skenes’ 5.9 WAR, according to Baseball Reference, is tied with Bahnsen for seventh among ROY pitchers. Skenes pitched 133 innings. With the exception of Fernández, everyone else threw at least 110 more innings than that. Instead, let’s look at Wins Above Average (WAA). How many games did your team win compared to if a league average player had received the same amount of playing time? Wins Above Average 1. Mark Fidrych, DET, 1976 -- 7.32. (tie) Paul Skenes -- 4.82. (tie) José Fernández -- 4.82. (tie) John Montefusco, SFG, 1975 -- 4.8 Fidrych is the WAR leader, too (9.6), and The Bird’s rookie campaign was one of the best seasons in baseball history. Skenes has to settle for a tie of second, which is again impressive given his smaller sample size compared to everyone else. So where does Skenes’ rookie campaign rank among this fraternity of ROY winners? Probably somewhere near the top. It’s hard to argue against Fidrych’s bulk stats or Williams’ rate stats, but if you value ERA, wins, strikeouts and quality innings pitched, Skenes is universally near the top of the list. Now let’s see what’s on deck in 2025."
MLB News,"From MLB Develops to repping USA vs. Japan, top prospect Johnson rising fast",https://www.mlb.com/news/termarr-johnson-leads-team-usa-vs-japan-in-premier12,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 14:07:46 GMT",,"Jon Paul Morosi TOKYO -- Move over, Shohei Ohtani and Mike Trout. It’s time for a new chapter in the baseball rivalry between Japan and the United States, 611 days after the unforgettable conclusion to the 2023 World Baseball Classic. The global powerhouses meet Thursday at the Tokyo Dome (7 p.m. local, 5 a.m. ET) to open the Super Round at the WBSC Premier12. Team Japan features many top players in Nippon Professional Baseball, albeit with notable absences due to posting for MLB teams (Roki Sasaki) and injuries (Munetaka Murakami, Kazuma Okamoto). Team USA’s mostly youthful selection is limited to players not currently on Major League 40-man rosters. Plenty of international baseball observers will describe the Americans as underdogs against Hiroto Takahashi, an emerging NPB ace who has drawn comparisons to Dodgers star Yoshinobu Yamamoto. Before a singing, chanting crowd of more than 50,000, the Mike Scioscia-managed Team USA will walk into an environment that feels -- and sounds -- like the World Series. They welcome the challenge. Touched down in Tokyo! 🤳 pic.twitter.com/sPZsFUOftP I’m trying to come in and take one from Japan — and take it all from Japan,” said Termarr Johnson, Team USA’s energetic second baseman and Pirates' No. 3 prospect and No. 75 overall in the latest MLBPipeline.com rankings. “I’m excited to do that. Whatever it takes. We’re going to be focused on the game, not so much the stands and everybody. I know it’s going to be loud. Everybody’s going to be against us. But it’s only us. It’s only us. It’s always going to be only us. I’m excited.” The confidence of the 20-year-old Georgia native reflects two aspects of Team USA’s identity: They are prospect-laden and not intimidated by Samurai Japan’s 24-game winning streak across all competitions. Japan stands atop the WBSC men’s baseball world rankings. The last defeat for their senior national team was almost exactly five years ago. That loss came against the U.S. during the 2019 Premier12 -- precisely the same opponent, round and venue as Thursday’s game. All the best shots from our 4-3 victory over Japan today. #ForGlory🇺🇸📸: https://t.co/Q6edMeNfkK (courtesy of @WBSC) #Premier12 pic.twitter.com/VsJLfq1GEQ Samurai Japan responded to that loss with three straight victories, including a win over Korea in the gold medal game. Japan went unbeaten at the pandemic-delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympics, 2023 World Baseball Classic and 2023 Asia Professional Championships. And they’ve won five straight to begin this Premier12. The ’17 Classic was the most recent senior men’s title for USA Baseball, but the country’s developmental pipeline has shown impressive results since then. Johnson played for USA Baseball’s 15U and 18U teams during previous international tournaments. Johnson and Team USA center fielder Justin Crawford (Phillies' No. 4 prospect) met through their participation in MLB Develops programs, including the Breakthrough Series and Dream Series. “Our first time meeting each other was when we were 14U, doing the National Team Development Program,” Johnson recalled. “It’s a full circle moment. It’s great to be with him ... It’s amazing to be with him and have that connection.” Johnson said the MLB Develops program changed his life. “I wouldn’t be here today without it, honestly -- without the help of Marquis Grissom, LaTroy Hawkins, Tony Reagins, and everybody who’s given me the opportunity to be in this position,” Johnson said. “I’m definitely grateful to every single coach, every single staff member, every single person that has shaped me to [be] where I’m at today. I’m going to continue to keep on trending upwards because of the lessons they’ve taught me.” Johnson, the youngest player on the U.S. roster, is a major reason his team advanced out of the group stage. He’s played in all five games thus far, posting a 1.144 OPS that included a two-run home run in the clinching win over Mexico. “He has probably the most energy [of anyone] I’ve ever played with,” said Ryan Ward, the Team USA cleanup man. “He’s a nonstop guy. He loves baseball. He works hard. He’s a good guy to be around, especially if you’re down. He’s not going to let you be down for long. He doesn’t go down. He’s just riding the whole time, ready to go. “It’s fun to be around him. ... He’s been a great guy to have on the team. He’s had some good hits, some unreal plays.” Johnson reached Double-A at the end of the 2024 regular season and had an impressive showing at the Arizona Fall League (.919 OPS) before departing for Team USA’s training camp. Asked how the Premier12 will help him move closer to the dream of making his Major League debut, Johnson said, “I’m honestly just worried about trying to get a gold medal now. I’m so focused on that. I’m so focused on trying to bring it back for America, not necessarily worried about too much of the future. I can only focus on the next three or four days, make sure I do my best here. When it’s all said and done, then I can think about what’s next.” Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. The Super Round begins with three days of round-robin play among the four remaining teams. Team USA meets Chinese Taipei on Friday and Venezuela on Saturday. Sunday’s medal round will be determined by the standings after Saturday: The top two play for gold, the bottom two for bronze. Samurai Japan’s last defeat with a medal on the line was more than seven years ago -- to Team USA in the semifinal of the ’17 Classic. Perhaps Thursday’s game will be the first of two this weekend between Japan and the U.S. “I’m excited to be able to bring it back for my country,” Johnson said. “I love my country so much. It’s a lot that comes with [representing] it. Me being able to do that on the highest stage possible is a blessing. I’m thankful to God for it.”"
MLB News,Every franchise's BBWAA award winners,https://www.mlb.com/news/major-award-winners-for-every-mlb-team,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 23:41:00 GMT",,"MLB.com The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) honors MLB's best with its four annual awards: MVP, Cy Young, Rookie of the Year and Manager of the Year.

MLB News,"Wheeler isn't just an ace, he might be a Hall of Famer",https://www.mlb.com/news/zack-wheeler-building-strong-hall-of-fame-case,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 14:20:00 GMT",Phillies ace leads Majors in pitching WAR over last 7 seasons,"Mike Petriello When the results of the NL Cy Young Award balloting are released on Wednesday, Philadelphia’s Zack Wheeler is highly likely to find himself with a top-two finish. Regardless of whether he wins, take a moment to ask yourself a surprising, big-picture question: Might Wheeler be a future Hall of Famer? Are we witnessing greatness in real time? By every traditional metric, the answer is ... no. At 34 years old, he’s won only 103 games, never topping the 16 he just won this past season. He’s made only two All-Star teams. If he finishes second in the Cy voting to the Braves' Chris Sale, as expected, it will be just the second time he’s finished in the top five. His closest comparable, in terms of similar wins, innings and ERA, is 1950s lefty Don Mossi -- probably not a name you know. If the measure of a Hall of Famer is whether he was appreciated in his time, then Wheeler probably falls short. If the measure is whether his stats match up with the all-time legends at his position, then Wheeler definitely falls short. But as we dove into last year, it’s not really appropriate to compare present-day starting pitchers to those of decades ago. If your measuring stick for any potential future Hall starting pitcher is if he won as many games or pitched as many innings as Bob Gibson, Walter Johnson, or Nolan Ryan, then the result is: We will never, ever, ever induct another starting pitcher again after Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer get elected in the next six-to-eight years, or possibly Gerrit Cole some time after that. That’s obviously not what is going to happen, of course. Starting pitchers will still get Hall of Fame plaques. We’ll just need to reevaluate how we think of them. One way, as we laid out in January, was looking at the best pitcher of each seven-year stretch, as defined by Wins Above Replacement. We agree, fully, that WAR is not infallible -- but when exactly were pitcher wins the perfect metric, either? What we found at the time was that dating back to the end of World War II, of the 20 different pitchers who were the best in WAR across a seven-year span, 16 of them are either already in or will obviously get in, like Verlander and Kershaw. So you can say: 80% of the pitchers who were the best across a seven-year span ended up being Hall of Famers -- and it should be higher than that. What happened to the remaining four? Two were clearly deserving but had serious off-field issues that impacted their candidacies (Roger Clemens, Curt Schilling), and the other two are routinely considered among the biggest misses in recent Hall voting (Dave Stieb, Johan Santana). Santana would probably already be in had he captured a third Cy Young in 2005 -- an award that was denied him, ironically, because of pitcher wins. Even though this was often decades before WAR was even considered, in retrospect, this method did a strong job of capturing the best of the best -- names like Gibson, Tom Seaver, Steve Carlton, Pedro Martinez, Randy Johnson and Sandy Koufax were all the best across a seven-year-span. It’s a pretty good way to get to who the best pitchers of a given timeframe were. The best pitchers of the last seven seasons, then? Via FanGraphs, look who’s No. 1. 2018-24 Pitching WAR (Baseball-Reference WAR also has Wheeler atop the list, with slightly different numbers.) Even if WAR isn’t really your interest, the counting stats tell most of the same story. Since 2018, Wheeler is second in innings pitched (1,207) behind only Nola; he’s third in strikeouts (1,273) behind Cole and Nola; he’s got the fifth-lowest HR/9 rate (0.81) of any pitcher with 500 innings. He’s been excellent in the playoffs, too, adding 70 1/3 innings of 2.18 ERA ball, which is the third-lowest of any pitcher with 10 postseason starts, right between Madison Bumgarner and Schilling, two of the more decorated October pitchers in history. Wheeler is even a Gold Glover, winning in 2023. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. By any measure, Wheeler has been one of the truly elite starting pitchers of his time. Which, for at least one living legend, might just be enough. “I like the [best player in a] decade thing,” Verlander told Yahoo in 2020, when asked about how starting pitchers might end up getting into Cooperstown. “If you’re the best player or one of the best of your time, you should be in.” Wheeler will, by any modern metric as well as reputation, be one of the best of his time. He’ll also end his career with less than half the 3,884 1/3 innings that Gibson threw, and roughly half of Gibson’s 251 wins. Again, if that’s the standard, then he won’t reach that. It’s likely no one will again, just like Gibson couldn’t come near the 417 wins and 5,914 1/3 innings Walter Johnson threw in the early part of the 20th century, just like Johnson couldn’t come near the 511 wins and 7,356 innings Cy Young himself threw before that. If there’s an issue here, it’s the myth that too many players already get into the Hall, that adding a player like Wheeler would water down the legend in some way. If anything, it’s the opposite; the induction rate is not nearly enough to keep up with historic rates of induction. If Wheeler or someone like him doesn’t match up with how you feel about Gibson, Seaver, and Koufax, that’s perfectly understandable. But if not him, then who? When? We’ve already had to go through this reckoning before, remember. To this day, there’s only one BBWAA-elected starting pitcher (Bert Blyleven) who made his debut between Seaver (1967) and Greg Maddux (1986), and it’s not because no good pitchers reached the Majors in that span of nearly two decades. Instead, it’s because in the 1970s, the then-popular four-man rotation became the five-man rotation. That decreased starts, innings, and win totals, which were considered vitally important when that generation reached the ballot in the 1980s and 1990s, and made that group’s stats seem inferior to their predecessors. They’re not, today, not really. An entire generation of starters was lost, Cooperstown-wise, while the electorate reconfigured its approach and started electing pitchers who came up in the late 1980s and 1990s. That approach is going to have to change again. Wheeler might not be there just yet, but he’s also not done yet. Assuming a few more years of accumulating value – and there’s no reason to think he can’t do that – he might just be the first real test case some day. Think about it."

Stay tuned to MLB.com/HiddenClassics and MLB's YouTube channel for more Hidden Classic games later this month. The Cardinals and Cubs have squared off more than 2,500 times in a rivalry that stretches back as long as the gas-engine automobile. And there’s no question that one of the very best single-game performances in the entire span of that head-to-head belongs to Albert Pujols. You can’t list Pujols’ greatest career games without mentioning July 20, 2004, a day when “The Machine” almost single-handedly lifted St. Louis over Chicago. In the second installment of MLB’s new video series, “Hidden Classics,” we revisit that windy day game at Chicago’s Wrigley Field where Pujols reached hitting nirvana: Five hits in five at-bats, three homers and a double for good measure. The “Hidden Classics” series dives into MLB’s vast archive and dusts off the tapes from games you might not have seen in a while, forgotten about completely or just plain missed the first time around. Cubs fans might have suppressed the memory of this particular contest that the North Siders led, 7-1, after just two innings. That was the score when Pujols – who relished this rivalry and the moments when his club needed him most – clubbed his first homer of the day off Chicago’s Glendon Rusch. “Every time we played Chicago, I felt like it was almost playoff time,” Pujols tells us in this week’s lookback. “I enjoyed going to Wrigley Field. It’s almost like I took it to another level.” That blast to right-center field woke up Pujols and the Cardinals, who kept leveling up from there in a high-scoring affair at Wrigley.

MLB News,"Mets trade for Jose Siri, send reliever Orze to Rays",https://www.mlb.com/news/jose-siri-mets-rays-trade,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 01:04:00 GMT",,"Anthony DiComo NEW YORK -- For most of last season, the Mets rotated between Tyrone Taylor and Harrison Bader as their primary center fielders. This year, it appears the Bader role will go to Jose Siri. The Mets on Tuesday acquired Siri from the Rays for reliever Eric Orze. Siri, who had been with the Rays since 2022, is an elite center field defender who was tied for second in baseball at the position last season with 16 Outs Above Average. He also gives the Mets insurance in the event that Taylor, who underwent multiple surgeries earlier this offseason, needs more time than expected to recover. TRADE DETAILS Mets receive: OF Jose SiriRays receive: RHP Eric Orze Offensively, Siri has hit 43 home runs the past two seasons, but he mustered just a .620 OPS in 2024, largely because he struck out 170 times. Siri, who has three years of team control left, is arbitration-eligible for the first time this offseason, which likely played into Tampa Bay’s decision to trade him. Orze, 27, was the Mets’ fifth-round Draft pick in 2020. He produced a 2.92 ERA over 43 appearances at Triple-A Syracuse this season but struggled during a brief big league debut. Mets officials have long been impressed with Orze’s repertoire, but the idea of acquiring a significant offensive piece for a bullpen prospect proved too tempting to pass up. In New York, Siri figures to soak up most of the chances that Bader, a free agent, left behind. Bader appeared in 143 games for the Mets, starting regularly in center field early in the season before taking on more of a defensive replacement and pinch-running role down the stretch. Advanced metrics peg Siri as an upgrade over Bader in center field, with slightly more range, significantly more speed and a stronger arm. He also comes cheaper than Bader, who made $10.5 million last season. Over the past three seasons, Siri leads the Majors with 40 OAA in center field. Colorado’s Brenton Doyle is second with 31. Anything Siri produces at the plate is a bonus, considering he’s one of the game’s ultimate free swingers. But Siri does produce above-average bat speed and solid raw power, as evidenced by his 75 extra-base hits the past two seasons. Taylor, who underwent umbilical hernia and right elbow loose body removal operations after the season, should be back to full strength well in advance of Opening Day. But Taylor’s 345 plate appearances this year were a career high; Siri allows manager Carlos Mendoza to give Taylor regular rest as warranted."
MLB News,Vogt fastest to go from player to Manager of the Year,https://www.mlb.com/news/stephen-vogt-wins-2024-al-manager-of-the-year-award,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 01:04:00 GMT",,"Mandy Bell CLEVELAND -- A winning record in his first managerial season wasn’t enough. An American League Central title wasn’t enough. A run to the AL Championship Series wasn’t enough. Stephen Vogt also had to make history. Vogt was named the Baseball Writers' Association of America's 2024 AL Manager of the Year on Tuesday night, as announced on MLB Network. This is the third time in the past decade that a Cleveland skipper has taken home the honor. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Vogt is the fifth-youngest manager to win the award, trailing Rocco Baldelli, Buck Showalter, Tony La Russa and Eric Wedge. Vogt received 27 of the 30 first-place votes. “I’m very proud,” Vogt said. “I’m always going to give the credit to the people that have to go out and do it, and that’s the players.” But what Vogt did has never been done before. Joe Girardi had been the fastest person to go from player to Manager of the Year winner. In 2006, he won the award with the Marlins after having played in the 2003 season with the Cardinals. Vogt finished his playing career on Oct. 5, 2022, with the A's. Just 397 days later, having no past managerial experience, Vogt was hired as Cleveland’s manager. By the end of 2024, he set the record as the fastest person to go from player to Manager of the Year in the award’s history. The odds were certainly stacked against Vogt. The Guardians went 76-86 in 2023. Over the offseason, they added backup catcher Austin Hedges and starter/reliever Ben Lively to the 40-man roster. Other than that, the front office was relatively quiet. Neither move seemed to be earth-shattering at the time, and there were questions as to how this offense would produce more runs. Oh, and by the way, the skipper had no idea what he was doing … or so we thought. Vogt will be the first to tell you that he leaned heavily on the coaching staff around him, especially pitching coach Carl Willis, whom Vogt says has forgotten more things than Vogt knows about the game. But it was clear from the beginning that Vogt had a knack for getting everyone to buy in to the same message. It was little things during Spring Training that created a noticeable difference from 2023. During the team’s daily meetings, different players were appointed DJ for the day and had control of the aux cord during outdoor practices. It seems simple, but it created a jovial buzz in the room that got everyone excited to show up to see who was in charge that morning. After leaving Arizona, the team continued to flourish. “The beauty of this role in this job is that it's not about you, it's about your players and it's about their successes,” Vogt said. “There's really nothing I can do other than put people into positions to hopefully succeed, and to see our guys go out and have success, those were the high moments.” Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Manager of the Year is the hardest vote to justify. There isn’t concrete evidence or statistics to prove one manager made more of an impact on his team than the other. Yet, Vogt may have come close by the way he managed his bullpen this season. This is one of the biggest and scariest tasks to tackle for a skipper, especially an inexperienced one. Serving as a bullpen coach for Seattle in 2023 helped Vogt have a better feel for how to strategically use his best arms as often as possible without creating burnout throughout the regular season. And if he hadn’t figured that out, the Guardians would have been in hot water, considering their rotation was uncharacteristically unstable. Instead, the bullpen combined for a 2.57 ERA -- the fourth best among all 'pens since 1995. Told y'all we believed in Stephen Vogt!Vogter has been named the 2024 American League Manager of the Year in his debut season. 🤩#ForTheLand pic.twitter.com/CDc8VChOGE Vogt leaned heavily on his bullpen. He was aggressive in turning to his bench and rarely let a player go more than a few days without getting into a game. He navigated around losing his ace, Shane Bieber, in the first week of the regular season. Vogt pieced together a rotation after having to send Triston McKenzie and Logan Allen -- two pitchers who were supposed to play big roles in 2024 -- to Triple-A Columbus. He helped former hitting coach Chris Valaika change the mindset of this offense’s approach to add more impact to the ball, which resulted in 46 more runs. And he brought home a division title in his first managerial season. This was all so much more than anyone could’ve projected Vogt to endure and accomplish in his first year. Now, he’s ready to prove that Year Two will only get better. “Hopefully we win the last game of the year next year,” Vogt said. “That’s the goal.”"
MLB News,Yankees have 'good meeting' with Soto in California,https://www.mlb.com/news/juan-soto-rumors,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:18:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and rumors surrounding Juan Soto. Nov. 20: Soto has 'good meeting' with YankeesThe Yankees met with Soto on Monday in California, and team owner Hal Steinbrenner confirmed Wednesday that it was a ""good meeting"" with ""very honest back-and-forth dialogue."" Steinbrenner said that Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, manager Aaron Boone, president Randy Levine, and special assistant to the GM Omar Minaya were all in attendance during Monday's meeting. But he didn't divulge any part of the team's pitch to Soto or say if any offers were made during the meeting. ""It's been a priority,"" Steinbrenner said about signing Soto. ""We wouldn't have gone out to the West Coast if it wasn't. ... We'll be in the mix. I'll leave it at that."" As of Wednesday, Soto has had in-person meetings with the Yankees, Mets, Red Sox and Blue Jays. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Tuesday that Soto will also meet with the Phillies at some point. Soto also plans to sit down with the Dodgers this week, according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Steinbrenner said he has ""no idea"" if the Yankees will meet with Soto again or if he's confident that the club can re-sign the 26-year-old superstar. But he added, ""[W]e've got the ability to sign any player we want to sign."" Nov. 19: Phillies plan to meet with Soto (report)Yet another team has emerged as a potential suitor for Soto: the Philadelphia Phillies. According to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman, the Phils plan to meet with Soto at some point, though nothing has been scheduled yet. Soto reportedly has already met with the Blue Jays, Red Sox, Mets and incumbent Yankees and is scheduled to meet with the Dodgers next. Per Heyman, it's believed that no offers have been made to Soto yet. The Phillies already have one of the most complete rosters of any MLB team, but they are looking for ways to improve after failing to advance past the National League Division Series in 2024. Phillies ownership has shown a willingness to pay up for some of the top free agents on the market, with Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, Zack Wheeler, J.T. Realmuto, Aaron Nola, Nick Castellanos and Kyle Schwarber all signing lucrative deals with Philadelphia in free agency. Phillies managing partner and CEO John Middleton was candid in addressing Soto's market earlier this month, saying that he believes the outfielder wants to be in New York but adding that Philadelphia could get involved in the bidding anyway as a ""stalking horse."" Nov. 18: Cohen to best any Soto offer by $50 million (report)Yankees broadcaster Michael Kay said on his radio program on Monday that according to a source, Mets owner Steve Cohen is willing to beat any other club's offer to Soto by $50 million. ""I'll put it this way,"" Kay said. ""And I don't think this is something Yankees fans are going to want to hear. I don't think the Yankees are going to go [up to $700 million]. I don't. And then I've heard from somebody in baseball today that Cohen is willing to go $50 million over whatever anybody offers. So it looks like the Mets really want to get this guy."" Nov. 18: Dodgers expected to meet with Soto this weekSoto's decision on where to sign this offseason is the most anticipated in baseball, and according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, ""the feeling around the industry"" is that the decision could be made before the annual Winter Meetings get underway in Dallas on Dec. 9. Feinsand also writes that the Dodgers are expected to be the next team to meet with Soto, with plans to sit down with the superstar slugger sometime this week and perhaps as early as Tuesday. More > Nov. 18: Yanks meet with Soto (report)MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reports in an article for the New York Post that the Yankees met with superstar slugger Juan Soto in Southern California on Monday as they look to retain him after he helped lead them to the World Series. More > Nov 16: Blue Jays, Red Sox and Mets have met with Soto (reports)The Red Sox met with Soto and his representatives, including agent Scott Boras, in Southern California on Thursday night, according to a report from Sean McAdam of MassLive. It appears they aren't the only club that has chatted with the 26-year-old superstar. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Saturday morning that the Blue Jays, along with Boston, have made ""impressive in-person presentations"" to Soto. Heyman later added another team to the list, reporting that the Mets met with Soto on Saturday. He noted that ""all early signs suggest the meeting went extremely well,"" and that owner Steve Cohen and other ""high-ranking Mets officials"" made the trip. The Red Sox's meeting with Soto, which was of an introductory and informative nature, per McAdam, lasted for three hours and was deemed as “productive,” though neither money nor terms were discussed between the parties. Soto was reportedly “impressed” by Boston’s presentation, which included a video noting the franchise’s history of star players from the Dominican Republic, Soto’s native country. The Red Sox also detailed their plans for the future, highlighting a promising group of prospects who could potentially team up with Soto to help the club be successful in the years to come. Heyman reports that Soto is scheduled to meet with a fourth team, the Yankees, on Monday in California.

The NFL is going to hold us down for the next few weeks before the playoffs start, giving us a good chance to slow down and focus on the important things around us — like Netflix needing to nail Christmas Day after a terrible showing with the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight. This is a no-judging zone. I promise. As someone who held a watch party in their apartment for the “fight” between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson, I am in no place to judge how people decided to spend their precious electricity bill on Friday night. However, I will consider myself, and everyone else who sat through that wretched final card, an expert on streaming things from Netflix. We endured a disaster of near-biblical proportions while trying to feed on our gruel from the digital pig trough. The stream obviously couldn’t handle the load of people trying to come in and see the latest celebrity boxing match, which is a good time to shout from the rooftops: THE NFL IS COMING TO NETFLIX ON CHRISTMAS! Right now, this looks like a disaster waiting to happen. At times, it felt like Netflix was broadcasting this fight through the screen of a Game Boy Color. And that was on a Friday night, when there were still other things to watch and people were outside enjoying the start of their weekends. Netflix's next entry into the streaming wars will feature four of the league's marquee teams playing on its service. The Chiefs will be traveling to Pittsburgh to take on the Steelers in a game that will help decide the top of the AFC’s playoff picture. The Ravens will be taking on the Texans in another game between two of the more popular and entertaining teams in the league right now. Oh, yeah, Beyoncé will be performing at halftime of Ravens-Texans, too. This is the perfect storm of intense viewership that will test Netflix and its capacity to hold together what will be the most-watched live entity it has ever had before. For all of us who will be dodging time from our families to hide and watch some intensely important NFL games, this stream is our lifeforce. And if it goes the way of the Tyson-Paul pillow fight, we’re all in for a world of mild small talk conversations that are never quite as bad as you imagine them to be in your head. The horror. The audacity. Get it right, Netflix. This is the only reason to log on to that streaming service anyways. The Patriots might have done it again. Drake Maye has hit the ground running since he took over for Jacoby Brissett as the team’s starting quarterback this fall. Maye seems to be improving week by week, and his elite athleticism paired with his understanding of what’s being asked of him in the Patriots' offense has rejuvenated this franchise after bumbling around at quarterback in the years following Tom Brady’s departure to Tampa Bay. This is different from what Mac Jones accomplisedh as the Patriots' starter when he was a Pro Bowler as a rookie in 2021. This feels like something that has real sustaining power. Drake Maye waits for the crosser to clear the dropping defender and gets the ball off as the blitzer closes to convert on 3rd down. pic.twitter.com/HBDOqPyhv5 — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 18, 2024 There were people who were concerned about Maye’s ability to function behind a shaky offensive line, but he’s far better than Brissett was during his time as the starter. Maye’s expected points added per dropback (0.04) is dramatically improved from Brissett’s (-0.19). The Patriots' success rate on dropbacks is 7 percentage points higher with Maye and Maye is inviting less pressure and getting sacked at a lower rate. For all the hand-wringing regarding putting Maye into the lineup, he’s absolutely given the team a better chance to win than its prior quarterback situation. Even in the bleak atmosphere that is the Patriots’ offense, Maye has produced explosive plays and run the offense on time. He’s not scared to make tough throws under pressure and has the arm strength to make top 1% type throws that most quarterbacks can’t even dream of. This is high praise. Maye’s style feels somewhere between a cross between Josh Allen and Justin Herbert’s. He has the wherewithal to stick in the pocket and run plays as called, but the overwhelming athleticism and arm strength to make some unbelievable plays off-script. In a world where it seems like so many teams have dire quarterback situations, having a QB with legitimate MVP talent is a godsend. Allen and Tua Tagovailoa are in the division and now they have a quarterback who will be capable of leading elite offenses if the Patriots can continue to build out the supporting casts. Sorry to everyone who was sick of the Patriots for 20 years. It seems like they’ll be back sooner rather than later with another inevitable quarterback talent at the helm. Alright. The Lions and the Jaguars are clearly in different universes when it comes to what they’re expecting out of their seasons, but damn, 52-6!? Even with Detroit being the best team in the league, it’s still hard to put up this many points while allowing so few points. Even with Mac Jones in the lineup and a bad defense on the other side, there’s no reason to get beat this badly. The Jags got beat so thoroughly that we’re going to run through some numbers from this game to get a glimpse at how horrifying it was at the end. The Lions averaged 5.78 points per drive. They scored a touchdown on their first seven drives of the game. It was 49-6 at the end of the third quarter. Stand up, Jaguars! Detroit averaged 13.6 net yards per attempt. For reference, the league leader in this category is the Baltimore Ravens, who are 8.6 net yards per attempt for the season. That’s a 58% increase on the league leader in a one-game sample size. The Lions earned 36 first downs on 76 plays without the help of penalties. They gained two first downs from penalties, giving them 38 first downs on 76 plays for the day. Fifty percent of the time they were on the field, they were gaining a first down. If you remove those penalty first downs and stick with just what they earned through their own merits, they converted a first down on 47.4% of their plays. The Ravens also lead that category for the season with 34.4% of their plays going for first downs. According to TruMedia, Jared Goff averaged 1.04 expected points added per dropback. That means basically every single time the Lions called a passing play, they gained a full point of value. For every seven Goff dropbacks, the Jaguars allowed one touchdown worth of value — which kind of tracks when you remember they gave up SEVEN STRAIGHT TOUCHDOWN DRIVES to start the game. 44.2% of the Lions' rushing plays went for 5 or more yards. They physically displaced the Jaguars defensive line over and over again. That’s not NFL-quality play from the Jaguars. Yeah, their season is over and Doug Pederson is toast, but fight back next time. After falling to 5-5 at the hands of the Seahawks, the 49ers' season looks like it might potentially be on life support. Due to a crowded NFC West this year, the 49ers find themselves at the bottom of the division, boasting the same record as the Rams and Seahawks while the Cardinals hold a tight one-game lead on the rest of the division with a 6-4 record. The Niners' season certainly is not over, but they might not have what it takes as currently constructed to get to the playoffs, let alone go on a run in the postseason. One thing that is working about this offense is Brock Purdy. In the midst of losing Brandon Aiyuk and not having Christian McCaffrey at the peak of his powers, Purdy has performed admirably. The 49ers still rank in the top five of success rate on dropbacks and expected points added per dropback as the effectiveness of their running game has dwindled. They ran the ball better against the Seahawks than they have in recent weeks even though they’re still missing the explosives on the ground that made them such a dangerous offense. Still, Purdy along with George Kittle, Deebo Samuel Sr. and Jauan Jennings have done enough in the passing game to keep them stable and moving forward in the right direction. The defense has also taken a step back from recent seasons where the group isn't the dominant unit that people had grown accustomed to. The Niners still have ace defenders in Fred Warner, Nick Bosa and Deommodore Lenoir on their roster, but they’re a gettable defense in certain circumstances. Overall, they’re just a middle-of-the-pack defense that has some high-end talent. Enough to win games, but not impenetrable anymore. Through attrition and perhaps some roster management strategies, the 49ers don’t have the big shield and sword that they normally do when they’re trying to stay on top of the NFC. Purdy and the passing game will keep them in these games, but their upcoming schedule will prove difficult as they try and fight to the end of the season to make the wild-card round. Getting a first-round bye is certainly off the table with the way that Detroit is performing. The 49ers will close the season with games against the Packers, Bills, Bears, Rams, Dolphins, Lions and Cardinals. W-H-E-W. That’s a tough run for any team, let alone a team that is fragmented and currently at the bottom of its division, however slim that deficit actually is. The 49ers might find themselves on the outside looking in at the playoffs — and not making at least the NFC championship game — for the first time since 2020."

With 177 2/3 innings pitched, 225 strikeouts, 2.09 FIP and a 2.38 ERA, he beat strong second-place finisher Zack Wheeler of the Philadelphia Phillies for the award. Wheeler prevented Sale from being unanimous, taking four out of 30 BBWAA first-place votes. Sale got the other 26. Sale, who won NL Comeback Player of the Year award last week, is also the winner of the NL Triple Crown, meaning he led the league in ERA, strikeouts and wins (18). The last Braves pitcher to win the Cy Young was Tom Glavine in 1998. Sale, 35, engineered an incredible comeback season. The 15-year MLB veteran had a dismal 2023 with the Boston Red Sox but got the chance to start over when he was traded him to the Braves in December. Sale then signed a two-year, $38 million contract with the Braves and became their latest Charlie Morton-style reclamation project. Calling Sale a ""reclamation project"" isn't quite correct, though. He spent years as the ace for the Chicago White Sox and the Red Sox. Drafted 13th overall by the White Sox in 2010, Sale made his debut in the same season, but he really broke out in 2012. That began a fantastic, seven-year run in which he made the All-Star Game and finished in the top six of Cy Young voting every season. He didn't miss a step after being traded from the White Sox to the Red Sox in 2016, either. Then the injuries began to pile up for Sale in 2020, a season he missed entirely after getting Tommy John surgery in March. Due to illness and continued elbow recovery, he didn't make his 2021 debut until late summer. The 2022 season was somehow even worse. His year started with a rib stress fracture he sustained while throwing batting practice. He finally returned to the Red Sox in July and shortly thereafter broke the middle finger on his pitching hand. That was followed by a bike accident that resulted in a broken wrist that ended his season. After his subpar 2023 season, during which Sale was battling a shoulder issue, Sale wasn't the hottest commodity on the trade market. All the Braves shelled out to get him was second baseman Vaughn Grissom and some cash. But it's a move that paid off for them — and for Sale — in the biggest of ways."

He has no intention of missing another. The San Francisco 49ers tight end told reporters he will return to action Sunday against the Green Bay Packers, after missing last week's game against the Seattle Seahawks with a hamstring injury. From KNBR: “I will be playing on Sunday,"" Kittle said. ""Very excited, can’t pass up playing the Packers. I will be out there for sure. Going to practice today, it will be very fun and exciting. Kittle was officially listed by the Niners as limited in practice Wednesday. He first sustained the injury in Week 10 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, with head coach Kyle Shanahan describing the issue as ""hamstring irritation"" at the time. The injury was initially described as not very serious. Shanahan said later that week he didn't have much concern about Kittle's availability against the Seahawks, but the Pro Bowler was still listed as questionable and later ruled out for the game. Missing the Seahawks game, a 20-17 loss, interrupted one of the best streaks of Kittle's career. Between Weeks 5 and 10, Kittle averaged 79.8 yards and a full touchdown per game. He's already posted the second-most touchdowns in a season in his career with seven. His injury also continued the Niners' trend of being unable to stay healthy, and they can only hope there are no more surprises in store. San Francisco should at least be getting Kittle back for one of their biggest games of the season. The team currently sits in a three-way tie for second place in the NFC West at 5-5 and direly needs a win to keep pace in the division it was supposed to rule. Meanwhile, the 7-3 Packers will both be looking to avenge their loss in the divisional round last season and to stay competitive in an NFC North topped by the Detroit Lions and Minnesota Vikings. The Packers are currently two-point favorites to win at home via BetMGM."

The last thing the Warriors need is another Draymond Green suspension. And that's exactly what Kendrick Perkins believes is necessary after the Golden State forward's latest controversial foul. Perkins, on Tuesday's episode of ESPN's ""First Take,"" explained why he believes Green should be suspended for a foul on Memphis Grizzlies rookie center Zach Edey that the NBA upgraded from a ""take"" foul to a Flagrant 1. ""I actually think Draymond should be suspended for an extended period of time,"" Perkins said. ""We're talking about a play where he pulled on the opponent's Achilles while the opponent was going in the opposite direction. And we're talking about a guy, Zach Edey, who's [7-foot-4] probably 300 pounds. This could have been a season-ending injury right here. ""And I get it, right, so many people are like 'Oh, it's a sticky situation because it is Draymond.' Some people on the other side, like me, are saying 'Hey, this was a dirty play, he needs to be penalized for this, he needs to be suspended' and there's others who say ''Hold on, let's take a deeper dive into it, we don't want to make it as if we're picking on Draymond.' But if you ask me, he needs to be suspended for an extended period of time. There's no room, no place in our game for those type of actions."" Green initially was called for a ""take"" foul on Edey midway through the third quarter of the Warriors' 123-118 win over Memphis on Friday at Chase Center before the foul was changed to a Flagrant 1 on Sunday.

Draymond didn’t like this comment from Taylor Jenkins 😅 [via @Money23Green’s IG] pic.twitter.com/XxumC3cIMN — Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) November 17, 2024 While he likely won't agree with Perkins' claim that Green should be suspended, Warriors coach Steve Kerr at least agrees with the league's decision to upgrade the foul to a Flagrant 1. “I agree with it; he grabbed him,” Kerr said Sunday of the upgraded foul. “Definitely take foul like they called. But I had no problem with it being upgraded to a Flagrant 1. It's not a basketball play. It was more than a ‘take’ foul. The Warriors struggled throughout both of Green's suspensions last season, and although further disciplinary measure is unlikely at this point, another absence certainly could disrupt Golden State's (10-3) red-hot start to the 2024-25 season.

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",The Boston Red Sox are primed for a big offseason. Will they land a star to pair with Rafael Devers?,https://sports.yahoo.com/the-boston-red-sox-are-primed-for-a-big-offseason-will-they-land-a-star-to-pair-with-rafael-devers-211639903.html,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 21:16:39 GMT",The Red Sox are in the mix for Juan Soto and could also upgrade their starting rotation this winter.,"There was a time when the Boston Red Sox sat at the table of baseball’s elite. This is a franchise with a rich history in a major market, a devoted fan base and plenty of money to spend. But over the six seasons since Boston last won the World Series in 2018, the franchise has not been the same. In that span, the Red Sox traded one of the franchise’s biggest superstars, Mookie Betts, to the Dodgers, with whom Betts has won two World Series titles while remaining one of the game’s biggest superstars. Meanwhile, Boston has missed the postseason in five of six seasons and moved through three different heads of baseball operations in Dave Dombrowski, Chaim Bloom and now Craig Breslow. The cachet that Boston once had as one of baseball’s premier franchises had taken a hit, with many around the league wondering if and when the Red Sox will return to prominence. But as the second offseason under Breslow begins to take shape, it’s beginning to feel like the Red Sox are on the verge of making some noise again. Anytime you're in conversations about the offseason’s biggest free agent — in this case, Juan Soto — it’s proof you’re serious about improving your team. The Red Sox, who met with the mega-free agent last week, could definitely use the type of star power Soto brings. Star power was once an intrinsic part of the Red Sox’s brand, with names such as Pedro Martinez, David Ortiz, Manny Ramirez, Roger Clemens and even Betts, and it’s something they would surely like some more of. Boston does have a superstar talent in third baseman Rafael Devers, but since he signed an 11-year, $331 million extension in 2022, the Red Sox haven’t been able to pair him with a player of his caliber to take some of the pressure off him. Devers and Soto would make for a pairing to rival any in baseball, and with a leadoff hitter such as Jarren Duran, Boston’s lineup could be lethal. Soto is exactly the type of player Boston would go after during the golden eras of Red Sox baseball. But even if they don’t land him, their pursuit of Soto sends a clear message to the rest of baseball that this team is ready to sit at the big kids’ table again. As such, many around the industry expect the Red Sox to be serious players in the free-agent market this offseason. Not only that, but Boston’s farm system, headlined by Marcelo Mayer, Roman Anthony and Kristian Campbell, will also allow the team to engage in the trade market and make serious noise there. While the years under Chaim Bloom in Boston weren’t filled with marquee additions, Breslow now has the opportunity as chief baseball officer to make his mark on the franchise. Beyond their pursuit of Soto, the Red Sox could be seeking upgrades at second base, left field, the back of the bullpen and possibly the rotation this winter. Which free agents could be a fit for Boston? For one, the team has shown interest in free-agent outfielder Teoscar Hernández and was interested in the World Series champion last offseason, prior to his signing with L.A. At the same time, pitching has been an emphasis for the Red Sox under Breslow, who pitched in the big leagues for 12 years. Max Fried, Blake Snell or even Walker Buehler would be strong additions to Boston’s starting rotation, which already has a few foundational pieces in Tanner Houck, Bryan Bello and Kutter Crawford. The Red Sox could also trade for a starter such as White Sox ace Garrett Crochet, whom they have the prospect capital to make a run after. Adding an elite high-leverage presence such as All-Star reliever Tanner Scott would be the cherry on top of what could be a very productive offseason. With so many possible avenues for improvement and real financial flexibility, this is shaping up to be the offseason in which the Red Sox can get themselves back to baseball relevance. And with their rival Yankees coming off a World Series appearance and an Orioles team led by a new ownership group looking to invest, the Red Sox can’t afford to hover in no man’s land. The time of sitting and waiting with the checkbook closed is over. Whether it’s shocking the world by landing Soto or making a combination of other impactful moves, the Red Sox have a real opportunity to win this offseason. They just have to decide that they want to."

The school announced Wednesday that McElwain, 62, would retire at the end of the season. The announcement comes a day after CMU improved to 4-7 on the season with a 16-14 win over Western Michigan. ""My wife Karen and I have cherished every moment of our football journey,"" McElwain said. ""We want to express our deepest gratitude to the all the players who have welcomed us into their lives, and the incredible coaches and support staff at every stop along the way—it has been a true privilege to work alongside all of them. The lifelong friendships that were created mean the world to us."" ""We are especially thankful for our time at Central Michigan. Mount Pleasant and the CMU community hold a special place in our hearts, and we look forward to continuing to be a part of this program and this great community. Thank you for the unwavering support and the unforgettable memories."" McElwain’s retirement also comes as he’s reportedly the subject of an NCAA investigation into Connor Stalions’ presence on the CMU sidelines at the start of the 2023 season. The infamous former Michigan staffer who ran an advanced in-person scouting scheme was in CMU attire as the Chippewas played at Michigan State. McElwain has said he was unaware if Stalions was on the sideline. Quarterbacks coach Jake Kostner, a Michigan graduate, resigned earlier this season. In-person scouting is against NCAA rules and the advance scouting scandal led to former Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh’s suspension by the Big Ten for the final three games of the 2023 regular season as the Wolverines went 15-0 and won the national championship. McElwain, a former coach at Florida and Colorado State, has been at Central Michigan for six seasons. The Chippewas are 33-35 in his time and went to two bowl games. The team’s best season came in 2021 when CMU went 9-4 and won the Sun Bowl. McElwain came to CMU after he spent the 2018 season as Michigan’s wide receivers coach under Jim Harbaugh. He had that interlude as an assistant after he was fired midway through his third season with the Gators. Florida moved on from McElwain after a 3-4 start to the 2017 season. The Gators went 10-4 in his first season and were 9-4 in 2016. His firing came seven games into he 2017 season after McElwain said there had been death threats against himself and the team. Florida quickly released a statement saying that McElwain had not provided the school with details of any threats. The athletic department reportedly debated if it could fire McElwain for cause and ended up mutually parting ways with the coach days later following a 42-7 blowout loss against Georgia. Before arriving in Gainesville, McElwain was the head coach at Colorado State for three seasons. The Rams improved from 4-8 in his first season to 10-2 in his final year in Fort Collins."

With all due respect to Gov. Greg Abbott, most of us need a brief break from talking about politics these days. And given that opinions on all things Cowboys are firmly in the “everything sucks” camp, that leaves the signal-caller at Texas as the focus of the state’s white-hot spotlight right now. Quinn Ewers has spent years now on center stage, but his understudy is edging his way out of the wings … and the audience sees it. How long before the calls for Arch Manning get too loud for Longhorns head coach Steve Sarkisian to ignore? Is Ewers’ standing a microcosm of Texas as a whole — highly touted in the preseason, exposed as less-than-magnificent once the games started? Let’s start with the facts. Texas is 9-1, in pole position for an SEC regular-season title, a conference championship berth and a CFP first-round bye. That, in itself, is reason enough for Sark to keep on dancing with the date that brought him to this point. However, it’s also a fact that Ewers hasn’t produced the kind of season expected from him. Prior to Week 0, BetMGM had Ewers at +1000 for the Heisman, third-best behind Dillon Gabriel and Carson Beck. He’s now at +25000, and it’s pretty safe to say Ewers bettors aren’t going to cash that ticket. Ewers has also seen his NFL Draft stock plummet; early 2025 mock drafts have him falling out of the first round. “Solid overall package but has never really achieved a spectacular level, nor shown that he can consistently create,” Yahoo’s Charles Robinson declared last week. “There’s concern over his consistency in dealing with injuries throughout his career.” That’s the future. What about the present? Over eight games, Ewers grades out at a 68.2 out of 100, according to Pro Football Focus. (For comparison’s sake, Colorado’s Shedeur Sanders, Miami’s Cam Ward and Ole Miss’ Jaxson Dart all grade out at better than 90.0.) Ewers’ most visible and glaring flaw is his difficulty throwing downfield, and this is a case where the eye test matches up with the numbers. Over the entire season, Ewers has just seven “Big Time Throws” —defined by PFF as passes “with excellent ball location and timing, generally thrown further down the field and/or into a tighter window.” Ward has 24 such throws; Sanders, 22. Ewers’ Average Depth of Target — the distance downfield of his targeted receiver — is 6.7 yards. Among the 97 quarterbacks this year with a minimum of 250 dropbacks, Ewers ranks … 97th. That inaccuracy was evident on Saturday against Arkansas, when Ewers failed to locate or connect with downfield receivers on multiple occasions … hence, the grumbling in the stands. Texas can get away with that kind of inaccuracy against the Razorbacks, and probably against Kentucky this week, too. But against Texas A&M in the regular-season finale? Against an SEC hoss in the conference championship? Against any member of the 12-team CFP field? That’s a dangerous gamble. The backup quarterback might just be the most favorable occupation in Texas; you’re judged not on your performance but on the most optimistic view of your potential. Right at this moment, Arch Manning is a future two-time Heisman winner who will win more Super Bowl trophies than his uncles put together. He also grades out at a 90.1 with exactly 100 dropbacks on the season. Sarkisian and Ewers have both managed to keep a lid on the quarterback controversy talk by sidestepping any attempt to criticize or downplay Ewers’ role. When asked earlier this week if they had thoughts about this weekend potentially being Ewers’ home finale, both had quick responses. “No idea,” Sarkisian said. “Who knows?” Ewers said. “I’m just trying to win, trying to win this week.” Both answers left a thread of uncertainty about Ewers and his future dangling — Ewers still has a year of eligibility remaining — and that was enough to set off another round of what-if fearmongering around social media. Would Ewers come back for another year? Would he be QB1 if he did? Would the most notable Texas player in a generation actually enter the transfer portal? (The answer to all three of these — or at least 1 and 3 — is almost surely “no.”) So, much to consider as Texas wraps up its regular season. It’s tempting to say Ewers could silence all the criticism with victories, but he’s been winning all season and the gripes haven’t slowed. It might take a January trophy to make Texas fans happy, nothing less. Good luck, Quinn Ewers. Over these next two-to-seven games, you’re going to need all of it."
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games","Nelly Korda, Lexi Thompson back Charley Hull's ruthless idea to fix slow play on LPGA",https://sports.yahoo.com/nelly-korda-lexi-thompson-back-190115170.html,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024 19:01:15 GMT",Korda and Thompson both would love to see the LPGA start handing out penalties for slow-play offenders.,"After Charley Hull’s ruthless idea to fix slow play, two of the LPGA’s most influential players are fully backing the unfiltered Englishwoman. Speaking to reporters on Sunday at The Annika, where she tied for second, three shots back of winner Nelly Korda, Hull offered her solution to fixing the tour’s pace-of-play problems. “I’m quite ruthless, but I said, ‘Listen, if you get three bad timings, every time it’s a two-shot penalty,” said Hull, whose final pairing alongside Korda on Saturday finished in the dark, totaling 5 hours, 38 minutes, and extending the broadcast window by 51 minutes, according to Golfweek’s Beth Ann Nichols. “If you have three of them [penalties],” Hull added, “you lose your Tour card instantly. I’m sure that would hurry a lot of people up and they won’t want to lose their Tour card. That would kill the slow play, but they would never do that.” Korda and Lexi Thompson, two of the quicker players on tour, were asked about slow play, particularly Hull’s comments, on Tuesday ahead of the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship in Naples, Florida. “Hers was a bit of an aggressive comment,” Thompson said. “I don't disagree with it. It has to be done. Something has to be done to quicken up the play out there, whether it's fines or whatever it is. Needs to be done because we need to play quicker.” Added Korda: “Funny, yes.” Korda criticized the nighttime finish on Saturday at Pelican Golf Club, calling it “poor planning.” She expounded on her slow-play thoughts on Tuesday. “I personally think it's a pretty big issue,” Korda said. “I think it's not good for the fans that come out and watch us. If it was me personally, I would be very, very annoyed watching for five hours, over five hours, five hours and 40 minutes, close to six. I just think it really drags the game down. I think that it really, really needs to change.” Thompson said the maximum time allotted to threesomes should be four and a half hours. “Look, you're going to hit a good shot or bad shot, might as well not take that much time over it,” Thompson said. “It's just a game. Just do your routine, commit, and hit it.” The LPGA, according to Golfweek, handed out at least two slow-play fines last week, one to Carlota Ciganda, who is notoriously deliberate, and Kaitlyn Papp Budde. Ciganda’s fine was $4,000, though she also did enough at The Annika to finish No. 60 points, earning the last spot into this week’s $11 million season finale, where the winner will take home $4 million. “I know I have to improve, and I’ll try to do that next year,” Ciganda told Golfweek. “I don’t think people understand how tough golf can be … mentally it’s a lot tougher than what people think. Golfers just drink some beers and play some golf, and we do this for a living. A lot goes through in your mind.” Korda is in the camp that believes fines aren’t enough. “Players just need to be penalized,” Korda said. “Rules officials need to watch from the first group. Once they get two minutes behind, one minute behind, it just slows everything down. To be standing over a putt for two to three minutes, that's ridiculous. When a group in front of me is on the green and I'm in the fairway, I'm already getting ready. I'm getting my numbers ready, talking about the shot, so by the time it's my turn, I already have my game plan. I'm hitting right after the person that just hit in front of me. I think people overanalyze, one, and I think people just need to be ready faster. People start their process a little too late and they stand over it too long. “Again, I think we need more people on the ground to monitor pace of play. I don't think we have enough people to monitor it.”"

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Inside Caleb Williams’ first week with new play-caller — and Thomas Brown’s vision for turning around the Bears,https://sports.yahoo.com/inside-caleb-williams-first-week-with-new-play-caller--and-thomas-browns-vision-for-turning-around-the-bears-185907259.html,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 18:59:07 GMT",Chicago's playoff chances are low right now. But if Brown and Williams can get pointed back in the right direction together — like they did last Sunday — it'd be invaluable to the Bears' future.,"On his first play against the Green Bay Packers, Caleb Williams lined up in shotgun. Running back D’Andre Swift flanked his left side, wide receiver Rome Odunze in the backfield to the Chicago Bears quarterback’s right. Just before the snap, Williams sent wide receiver DJ Moore in motion. Then Williams handed off to Swift, who advanced 2 yards upfield. The gain was limited, the drive ultimately moved enough to set up a 53-yard field goal. But from the coaches’ box, offensive coordinator Thomas Brown saw his first call differently. The Bears had fired Shane Waldron and promoted Brown from passing game coordinator four days earlier. Brown viewed his early game script as a chance to communicate his intent to his players and to his opponent. And then? “Build tendencies to break them,” he told Yahoo Sports in a Tuesday phone interview. “Give the same presentation and then still present something different to the defense.” So 10 more offensive plays elapsed. Williams targeted each of his top three receivers and his top running back in a concerted effort to get as many teammates involved in the flow of the game early, while also using his legs to escape more productively than he had all season. Then the Bears faced second-and-5 with 2:23 to play in the first quarter. Again, Williams aligned in shotgun. And again, Moore and Swift flanked him. The formation was flipped: Odunze on Williams’ left this time, Swift on his right. Moore again motioned across, but he, too, came from the right. And this time, Williams didn’t hand off to Swift. He pitched a jet sweep to Moore, who took the toss 2 yards upfield to the left sideline. First down. And, perhaps, something more. The Bears understand how much progress they, and especially their offense, need to make. They’re on a four-game losing streak during which Williams has not thrown or run for a touchdown. More than a month has elapsed since the Bears last scored 20 points. But even as the Packers blocked a field goal to escape Soldier Field with a 20-19 win, the Bears looked around and saw something promising amid their 11th straight loss to a division rival. With Williams elevating his play on the game’s final drive, and offensive play-calling engineering a much smoother performance, the Bears wondered whether they’d found the blueprint for a turnaround. In his first game receiving play-calls from Brown, Williams completed 20% more passes than any of his past three outings. The 2024 first overall draft pick registered his quickest release time yet, at 2.42 seconds on average, and he applied Brown’s principles to escape with his fewest pressured snaps (in raw numbers and percentage) of his career. At 4-6, the Bears’ chance of making the playoffs in football’s most competitive division is just 1%, per ESPN’s playoff projection model. But stealing wins against good teams (with no sub-.500 teams left on their schedule, there will be a weekly option) can lay a foundation for the Bears the way the Detroit Lions laid their foundation winning five of their last six in 2022 despite missing the playoffs. Developing Williams for long-term success is paramount, too. As Brown shifts Chicago’s communication style, practice intensity and play-calling vision, the Bears believe they’ve found a spark. “Thomas got the job and he went up in front of everybody and he talked about how this was going to be a battle,” Williams said. “But when we’re out there, we’re going to fight, we’re going to execute. “We’re going to have that mindset of go out there and kick some tail.” As Carolina Panthers offensive coordinator last year, Brown called plays from the sideline. He decided this season he’d see the field better from the booth, and opted to call plays Sunday from there. The decision wasn’t unusual — NFL coaches routinely call plays from each place. But Brown leaned on the lessons he learned from Bryce Young’s rookie year to determine: In a league where myriad voices are eager to advise quarterbacks, streamlining communication is necessary. The Bears arranged for a specific headset line that only Brown and Williams could access between drives. Brown clicked over to that line to give feedback from the last series and alert Williams to plans and expectations for the next. Then, he freed Williams to review film with quarterbacks coach Kerry Joseph and connect with teammates. “An opportunity to decompress, go talk with teammates,” Brown said. When he returned to the field, decompressing time was over. Play-calls seemed to arrive immediately. “Super fast, as soon as a play happened,” Williams said. “Thomas was right on the headset giving me the play and then from there, he just strung plays together pretty well.” Brown continued to repeat calls in case game-day cacophony overpowered his first delivery. Williams would listen until the play clock hit roughly 30 seconds, then gather teammates in the huddle from about 30 to 25. He broke the huddle around 20 seconds. “And now you can use all your different cadences,” Williams said. “Mixing it up so the d-line can’t get a jump on the snap.” Marrying the run and pass helped the Bears displace defenders from run lanes and gain back leverage on some passing routes. Motions gave defensive backs pause, tempting them to creep back in some instances. And the rapid-fire play-call laid the groundwork to choose spots that would best leverage tempo. Take the moment when the Bears faced second-and-10, trailing 14-13 with 39 seconds to play in the third quarter. Swift exploded around the left side, sprung by a punishing group of blockers. He kept going until he’d raced 39 yards to the end zone. “Caught the defense off-guard,” Brown said, “and the guys did a phenomenal job of executing it.” Williams included. [Caleb Williams] has enough ‘stress downs.’ Most games in this league come down to one-score games where he's got to make some critical throws and critical decisions. But other than that, I want to try to figure out how can we give him ‘relief downs.’Thomas Brown, Bears offensive coordinator Brown told his players during the week not only which plays he wanted to run but also the intent behind them — in what circumstances he envisioned a call coming, how he imagined the play would unfold and how a defense would respond. He urged players and coaches alike to practice more urgently. Williams’ tempo would dictate the entire unit’s, Brown reminded his quarterback. Whether or not the quarterback felt eager, it was his job to set the tone. “The quarterback spot is the most scrutinized position,” Brown told the rookie. “As a leader, you're not really allowed to have bad days [as] far as attitude, how you approach the group. It doesn't really matter how you feel. I don't feel like doing certain things at times. It doesn't alleviate me from the responsibility of being a leader and doing my job. “So he's kind of in that same position and he embraced that.” Tempo quickened, Brown said. Completion percentage did, too, per head coach Matt Eberflus. Brown told Williams that yes, he has athleticism and God-given gifts to exploit — but he can’t afford to do so every play. If Williams’ first read is open, take it. If the initial air yardage isn’t as deep as desired, remember how many of his teammates make plays in space. And on third down, get as many yards as possible but don’t stress the final couple if they’re not there. “We’re a pretty aggressive organization with going for it on fourth down,” Brown said. “So that gives me, at times, the opportunity to play third down like second down, where I’m not having to get all the yardage.” The Bears still posted a season-best 56.25% on third down against the Packers but also converted all three fourth-down attempts. Williams found Roschon Johnson for 8 yards on fourth-and-2, muscled himself 4 yards on fourth-and-1, and then played at his best during fourth-and-3 on the final drive. He thought the Packers would expect a run or short-gain play up the middle. Williams was excited when Brown instead called for a fade that both felt the Packers wouldn’t be expecting. One play after finding Odunze for 16 on third-and-19, Williams hit his fellow 2024 first-rounder down the right sideline for 21 yards. Caleb to Rome on 4th and 3. Ice cold.📺: #GBvsCHI on FOX📱: https://t.co/waVpO909ge pic.twitter.com/uwrkhQzgGV — NFL (@NFL) November 17, 2024 The offense had positioned kicker Cairo Santos for a 46-yard, game-winning field-goal attempt. The Packers ultimately blocked it. But players knew they could build off that seven-play, 42-yard drive at which Williams leaned into the Superman traits Brown encouraged him to save for just such moments. (The Bears drew some criticism for not attempting one more play given Santos’ track record under 40 yards vs. over 45, but that was not Williams’ decision.) “We didn't get the result that we were hunting up, but that doesn't mean our process isn't right,” Brown told his players Monday. “So let's just continue to set the tone with that, and then increase it more this week.” The good news for Brown, Williams and Co. is they have a full week to prepare for the Minnesota Vikings after last week’s hurried coordinator change and Packers preparation. The bad news for Bears fans: They’re preparing to face Brian Flores’ zero blitz-happy defense that has confounded much more experienced quarterbacks than Williams. The Vikings have blitzed opponents 39.1% of the time, second-highest in the NFL, per Next Gen Stats. Brown coached against Flores at each of his last two stops. “You gotta adjust everything because he's one of the best in the league, if not the best, at disguise and manipulation,” Brown said. “So it's gotta be some new wrinkles that we'll mix in here and there to get those guys some different looks, but also just the simplicity of understanding what your answers are if you get in trouble, having zero [blitz] answers because they will zero you out any time. “We'll put our heads together and put a plan in place and keep sharpening our sword and go swinging on Sunday.” The game plan will change. The principles and standards won’t — for players or for Brown himself. He’ll continue to emphasize the collaboration that Eberflus praised his “wonderful job of” and he’ll continue trusting, rather than micromanaging, his assistants. He’ll lean on receivers coach Chris Beatty to advise ball distribution and third-down plans. Joseph will continue to work most directly on Williams’ fundamentals. And Brown, in his 360-degree strategy role, will tailor his play selection and game plan with consideration for how demanding the job of an NFL quarterback is even in opportune circumstances. Brown thinks back to his time on Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay's staff from 2020-2022, where he worked with Matthew Stafford. Sure, Stafford was more than a decade into his starting quarterback career, with one of the league’s deepest mental banks of coverages from which to spur recognition. That didn’t stop his coaches from wanting to simplify where appropriate. “How can we alleviate stress off the quarterback?” Brown asked then and asks now. “Because he has enough ‘stress downs.’ Most games in this league come down to one-score games where he's got to make some critical throws and critical decisions. But other than that, I want to try to figure out how can we give him ‘relief downs.’” The more Williams can literally and metaphorically breathe with schematic cheat codes and reduced pressure, the more he will develop during the rest of his rookie season and beyond. Give the quarterback that foundational landscape, and the potential is limitless, Brown believes. “I obviously want to continue to give him every opportunity, to put him in position to be able to win the football games and have success,” Brown said. “Understanding the fundamentals of the position, how to play within the rules and the confines of the game, understanding how to master decision-making, timing and accuracy, which is all about the passing game, and then also understanding our entire offense. “The more he can handle, from a protection standpoint to run alerts, the more he evolves with that, the better quarterback he'll become. Because he has all the physical tools in the world to be as good as he wants to be.” Jori EpsteinSenior reporter Jori Epstein is a senior NFL reporter for Yahoo Sports and the author of The Upstander: How Surviving the Holocaust Sparked Max Glauben's Mission to Dismantle Hate.

Let's dig into it. Every so often I like to have fun with something I call the Diontae Johnson Award. It's a nod to Johnson's strange 2022 season, where he collected a whopping 147 targets but somehow never scored a touchdown. Usually, you identify that sort of usage and you recognize the screaming buy-low opportunity. Positive regression is a concept most fantasy managers understand by now. But it's also worthwhile to try to understand why some players outkick their touchdown expectations, and some players fall short. And this brings us to Trey McBride, Arizona's fine third-year tight end. McBride was a breakout player last year, getting hot in the second half and finishing as the TE9. He's kept it up this year, third in aggregate points at the position and fourth in tight end points per game. McBride has been a right answer in 2024. He's also the current holder of the Diontae Johnson Award. He's sitting on 65 targets and still hasn't secured a receiving touchdown yet. The default stance before any secondary digging is to target this type of player. Volume is critical in fantasy football and eventually good players find the end zone, by design or by luck. Occam's Razor is a powerful solver of fantasy dilemmas — the simplest explanation is often best. But there are two other possible explanations to consider. One, it's easier for teams to run the ball than pass the ball in the red zone, when windows get tighter and connections become harder. Some teams are outliers in this area — some franchise quarterbacks throw regularly in these congested areas and do quite well. But will Kyler Murray and the Cardinals ever be that kind of team? Murray has only attempted 29 passes in the red zone this year — that ranks 25th in the league. His nine touchdowns in this space rank 16th in the league. So there's a smaller pie for McBride to share in. If you want to narrow the range to inside the five, Murray ranks 16th in attempts (seven), although he does have four touchdowns (that ranks eighth). Murray's currently having his best pro season. All of his indexed metrics are well above league average; his accuracy has never been better. But Murray is always going to be one of the smallest starters in the league, checking in at 5-foot-10. It would make intuitive sense that he's more of a weapon in the middle of the field as opposed to the red area. And the Cardinals have an established identity from in close, with James Conner one of the best power runners in the league. Murray's rushing is still a weapon, too. The upcoming schedule is below average for about a month or so, with four difficult matchups coming McBride's way. But if you can get to the playoffs, McBride's slate could push you over the top. He gets the Panthers and Rams the final two fantasy weeks — they rank first and fourth, respectively, in allowing points to tight ends. Maybe McBride's touchdown regression won't be ready for your Thanksgiving meal. But it could make for a nifty Christmas present about a month from now. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. As you surely heard last week, the Bears fired embattled offensive coordinator Shane Waldron and moved Thomas Brown into the play-calling chair. Chicago suffered a frustrating loss to the Packers when a last-second field goal was blocked, but there were encouraging signs from the offense. Caleb Williams had his best game in a month. The offense used motion more proactively. Maybe it wasn't a home run, but at least the Bears got on base. Chicago usually employs a narrow target tree, but two player trends are worth mentioning. Rome Odunze played 82% of the snaps (and drew 10 targets) against Green Bay, a notable bump from the New England loss. And Cole Kmet was over 90% snaps for the second straight week. Waldron was one of the last Gerald Everett fans — remember Kmet played fewer than half of the snaps on opening day. Thankfully, that story is over now. Odunze (6-65-0) and Kmet (3-42-0) weren't exactly week winners with their Week 11 stats, but it's a positive step. And Williams looked far more comfortable in the game plan. Chicago's facing perhaps the hardest schedule in the league moving forward, but Odunze and Kmet at minimum could be useful depth pieces as we navigate hellish bye problems for Weeks 12 and 14. Earlier this year we took an extended look at Jennings, trying to figure out if the rules of Signature Significance applied after his 11-175-3 smash against the Rams. We concluded that Jennings was the real thing, but injuries derailed the story for a bit. Jennings is back now, healthy and solidified in the San Francisco offense. He's locked into the Brandon Aiyuk X-role and has the trust of play-caller Kyle Shanahan and quarterback Brock Purdy. Jennings draws regular first-read targets, and Purdy will pull the trigger in the tightest of windows. It's time to give Jennings another accolade. He's the No. 1 receiver here, the alpha, the priority. The last two weeks, it hasn't been remotely close. Jennings has 22 targets as opposed to just 13 for Deebo Samuel Sr.; Jennings has made 17-184-1 on his work, Samuel 9-84-0. For the year, Jennings has a 60.3% success rate on his targets; Samuel is lagging back at 42.3%. It makes sense that Jennings is taking over. The fantasy market hasn't quite made the switch yet — Samuel still ranks 16th on the current board, while Jennings is 19th. But not only should that ranking be flipped, but there probably should be a fair amount of distance between Jennings and Aiyuk. Follow the volume or follow the efficiency, it doesn't matter. Both routes will get you to the same conclusion."
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Biggest surprises of the NBA season so far? Top 5 contenders right now? Let's debate!,https://sports.yahoo.com/biggest-surprises-of-the-nba-season-so-far-top-5-contenders-right-now-lets-debate-174344330.html,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 17:43:44 GMT",Our NBA writers weigh in on the most intriguing storylines of the season.,"With the NBA season approaching the one-month mark, our writers weigh in on the biggest surprises and disappointments so far, plus rank the top title contenders in the early going. Ben Rohrbach: The Cleveland Cavaliers. I figured last season, when they lost to the Boston Celtics in a five-game, second-round playoff series, there were too many redundancies on the roster. Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garland could not share a backcourt; nor could Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen share a frontcourt. Turns out, all they needed was Kenny Atkinson, a head coach who has reconfigured the offense in ways that maximize everyone — and form a true contender. Dan Titus: The Golden State Warriors. The Cavs and Lakers deserve votes, but the Warriors' hot start is at the top of my list because they weren't expected to be among the best teams in the West, let alone the entire league. Their uniquely deep rotation is thriving off a ton of ball movement, 3s and a revived commitment to defense. As a top-five unit on both ends, the Dubs are a legit title contender — even in the twilight of Steph Curry's and Draymond Green's careers. Dan Devine: How about the Nets — a team pretty much universally projected to be intentionally abysmal this season — instead being downright competitive? Despite facing one of the toughest opening slates in the NBA, Brooklyn sits at 6-9, with two of those losses coming in overtime to the champion Celtics on the road and on a night Nikola Jokić went nuclear, and a third on a dagger by Jalen Brunson. The Nets are tied for seventh in offensive efficiency, rubbing shoulders with All-Star-laden teams, thanks to the dribble penetration of Dennis Schröder and Cam Thomas, the scorching shooting of Cam Johnson and a bombs-away approach from beyond the arc implemented by new head coach Jordi Fernandez. It probably won’t last, especially if the rumblings that every Net is available in trade talks result in major, Capture-the-Flagg-inspired deconstructive surgery before the February trade deadline. For now, though, Brooklyn’s a pretty decent watch, and I’m not sure how many of us called that a month ago. Vincent Goodwill: It’s certainly Cleveland. Continuity as opposed to wholesale change working in today’s NBA? Who knew? The loss to the Celtics notwithstanding, the Cavaliers acquitted themselves well on Tuesday. Everything is sped up, Evan Mobley and Darius Garland growing without taking away from the others, and Donovan Mitchell keeping his powder dry till the fourth quarter? I like it. Titus: The Philadelphia 76ers. The Sixers can chalk up their terrible start to a lack of organizational accountability, leadership and being a flawed team with zero chemistry. The Joel Embiid-Paul George-Tyrese Maxey trio will presumably play together for the first time later this week, but as the worst-shooting team in the league, it will be tough to dig out of a 2-11 hole — even in a weak Eastern Conference. What a mess. At least Jared McCain looks great. Devine: Let’s stipulate that the correct answers are Philly and Milwaukee, as Yahoo Sports' Vincent Goodwill ably laid out Tuesday. As our staff’s most incorrect thinker, though: Let’s go with a Pacers team that lit up scoreboards at historic levels last season ranking just 16th in points scored per possession. A lot of the pain stems from injuries. It’s tough to run when you’re down half a rotation: Indiana’s gone from first in average time to shot last season to 14th this season, from second to 14th in pace, and from seventh to 20th in how often it plays in transition, sapping what was a huge strength for Rick Carlisle’s club last season. The blows to the supporting cast, along with consistently facing kitchen-sink defensive coverage, have combined for a brutal start for Tyrese Haliburton, who’s dealing with some injury issues of his own. Haliburton is averaging four fewer points and about two and a half fewer assists per game, shooting 38% from the field and 29% from 3-point range, and struggling mightily on the road. Without him playing at the superstar level he reached last season, Indiana will stay stuck in neutral. Goodwill: You can say the Philadelphia 76ers, for the team drama and lack of availability from Joel Embiid and Paul George. Shocker. The record being Wizards-esque seems like a fireable offense, but missing your top three players grants some grace. The Milwaukee Bucks, some of us expected them to have some level of continuity after last year’s rocky ride. Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard have been healthy aside from Lillard’s concussion, and while Khris Middleton has yet to make his debut, they still have enough to be better than 5-9. Winning three of four grants some bail, but overall, title contenders can’t look this way. Rohrbach: The Philadelphia 76ers. It may be too obvious, but they are 2-11. They have to win two-thirds of their remaining games to equal their record from last season, when they needed a victory in the play-in tournament to secure a playoff berth. They handed out a combined $609 million to Joel Embiid, Tyrese Maxey and Paul George over the summer — not to mention the millions they spent to surround them with a capable supporting cast — and they are dreadful. Goodwill: The Houston Rockets being competent. We could kind of see this coming with Ime Udoka working his magic and getting this team to be passable last year. Now, they’re top four in the West, albeit early, with a deep team, a point differential (+7.9) that would have them as a top-three team in the conference most years, and plenty of assets to put themselves in position to trade for the next disgruntled star, because there always is one. Seven guys score in double figures, and there's a good mix of youth and vets to make them more than plucky in the meantime. Rohrbach: Giannis Antetokounmpo. Does he become available? It felt like there was a 0% chance of that before the season. A month into it? There is a chance, even if it is a slim one. Even the slightest possibility that a perennial MVP candidate could be a trade possibility is a big deal — the kind of development that has teams plotting paths to land him. They are not contenders as currently constituted, and no amount of tinkering around the edges can change that. Speaking of which, how happy will Damian Lillard be in Milwaukee if more hope is lost? Titus: Dyson Daniels. The Great Barrier Thief has become one of the league's most versatile and disruptive defenders, averaging 3.4 steals and 1.1 blocks per game. He is well on his way to earning his first All-Defensive team nod. Daniels' growth isn't limited to the defensive end though, as he's putting up career-highs in usage rate, points, rebounds, assists and 3s made per game in his third NBA season. If his teammate weren’t Jalen Johnson, he’d be even higher on the MIP list. Devine: This might be nothing, but: way more defenses seem to be cranking up their full-court pressure early this season.

Last season, two did: the Trail Blazers and Pacers. So far this season, seven have, led by Brooklyn and Indiana at more than 12 possessions per game, followed by Portland, Toronto, Memphis, Miami and New Orleans. Three more — Washington, Oklahoma City and Golden State — have picked up full-court at least four times a night, a rate that would’ve ranked at or near the top of the NBA for most of the past decade and a half. Maybe the pressure produces a steal in the backcourt. Maybe it delays the meaningful action of an offensive possession by a few ticks — valuable in and of itself, considering the degree to which offensive efficiency drops off later in the shot clock. Maybe it’s like body blows in boxing — make your deposits early in hopes of reaping the dividends of an opponent’s legs getting weak late. Whatever the case: That’s about a third of the league, running the gamut from elite defenses to bottom-feeders, all making a defined and concerted effort to harass ball-handlers in the backcourt. They’re probably doing it for a reason, and it’s probably worth keeping an eye on. Devine: Celtics, Thunder, Warriors, Cavaliers and … hell, let’s go with the Nuggets. Just outside the top 10 on both ends despite Aaron Gordon missing the past couple of weeks and Nikola Jokić missing the last three games, 8-3 since dropping two ugly ones early, some signs of life from Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. — staying afloat. That’s good enough to keep me on board for now. Titus: 1. Celtics; 2. Thunder; 3. Cavaliers; 4. Warriors; 5. Lakers. Goodwill: 1. Celtics; 2. Thunder; 3. Warriors; 4. Cavaliers; 5. Nuggets. Rohrbach: 1. Celtics (reigning champions); 2. Thunder (West's best); 3. Cavaliers (15-1); 4. Warriors (top-five offense and defense); 5. Nuggets (Nikola Jokić)."

Last Saturday, I sat at a good friend’s house to catch “The Boxing Match of the Century,” and the ""Arrested Development"" clip kept replaying in my head. I grew up watching Mike Tyson. I remember when I was watching the '97 match against Holyfield that turned into a brawl. His speed and power were a marvel. But that was nearly 30 years ago. Conspiracy notions aside, the real clash over the weekend was preconceived notions battling with a heavy dose of reality. And we see which concept won. The 2024 fantasy football and NFL seasons have presented us with similar situations. Most recently, I hoped my Bengals could keep their season alive on the primetime stage. But we, and every offense they’ve faced, knew their defensive struggles were a problem. I had the same feeling after the final play. Regardless, setting expectations helps reconcile the eventual results. More importantly, we know how to navigate the takeaways. And as the fantasy playoffs creep up on us, leveraging those actionable nuggets can make or break your season. Admittedly, I didn’t watch the game in real time, but here are the storylines I gleamed from social media: Jared Goff redeemed himself from his five-INT outing in Week 10. David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs are this year’s version of Alvin Kamara and Mark Ingram. Doug Pederson is about to have a lot of free time on his hands. Between Jameson Williams doing his best Marshawn Lynch impersonation and Gibbs flashing his speed, Jacksonville didn’t have a chance. In either case, the big plays made the headlines. Imagine my surprise when I checked the box score and saw how much Amon-Ra St. Brown got in on the fun. .@amonra_stbrown had a DAY vs. Jacksonville☀️ 11 receptions☀️ 161 yards☀️ 2 TD pic.twitter.com/h5oYIdva3n — Detroit Lions (@Lions) November 18, 2024 It’s a testament to the strength of the offense that a multi-touchdown game from its WR1 isn’t the leading topic afterward. Although, that’s a feature, not a bug in Detroit. The Lions have had bottom-12 early-down passing rates for three straight years. TE Sam LaPorta was their WR2 last year. But I’d be careful before labeling St. Brown anything other than one of the best at the position. Contested Catch Rate: 70.0% (2nd out of 24 WRs — min. 20.0% target share) Explosive Play Rate: 21.3% (8th) Forced Missed Tackles: 8 (T-10th) Typically, I use the standard advanced metrics like yards per route run or air yards to contextualize a receiver. But most know ARSB primarily operates out of the slot. His receiving aDOT hasn’t been over nine yards at any point in his career. We’d expect him to be efficient. Honestly, I had to double-check the contested catch rate stat. St. Brown (17) has more explosive receptions than George Pickens (16), and this changed my perception of the fourth-year receiver even more. So, his WR1 status can’t be due to volume alone. Touchdown streak aside, the USC product finds himself at the intersection of talent and situation. He accounts for 28.2% of Goff’s passing yards. For reference, Tyreek Hill represents 26.5% of Miami’s aerial attack. Plus, St. Brown’s ability to move the chains is unmatched by his peers. At 44 receiving first downs, he has the most of any WR at this point in the season. Put another way, Goff has finished as a top-12 QB four times this season, and St. Brown has been the overall WR1 in half of those games. However, even in that stat, we can see the potential cap on his weekly ceiling. I mentioned the Lions’ gritty ground game earlier; they’re 28th in early-down passing rate and run at the fifth-highest rate in the green zone. Before Goff was throwing five picks, he had back-to-back weeks under 150 yards. A low-volume script isn’t out of the realm of possibility. Nevertheless, St. Brown’s role and impact on the offense remain unquestioned. And, with matchups against high-scoring offenses (Packers and Bills) during the fantasy playoffs, we should see more of the Sun God when we need him the most. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. To be clear, I’m kidding. I do wonder how many 49ers fans would agree with the sentiment, though. And, not for nothing, Jauan Jennings gave a few reasons to question his place in the hierarchy earlier in the season. Can’t tell if that’s Jauan Jennings or 49ers legend Randy Moss.📺: #SFvsLAR on FOX📱: https://t.co/waVpO909ge pic.twitter.com/4yn3FZbMTA — NFL (@NFL) September 22, 2024 Through 11 weeks, Jennings’ 46.5-point PPR total in Week 3 is the second-highest of any WR this year. Still, that result should come with an asterisk (or three). Deebo Samuel and George Kittle both missed the game. It was Brandon Aiyuk’s third game back after his offseason hold-in. Christian McCaffrey was in Germany. But we’ve seen HC Kyle Shanahan make do with less. So, watching Jennings fade as the primary pieces of the offense returned made sense. Week 3: 40.0% (Target Share), 47.0% (Air Yard Share), 46.5 (PPR Points) Week 4: 23.0%, 24.0%, 11.8 Week 5: 13.0%, 16.0%, 2.3 However, chalking up Jennings’s resurgence to Aiyuk’s injury alone would be reductive. Aiyuk saw more man coverage as he lined up as a perimeter receiver on 80.4% of his snaps. Meanwhile, Jennings manned the slot 48.9% of the time with the two on the field. Since he missed two games with a hip injury, we only have a two-game sample to determine his sustainability as a fantasy asset. But really, Week 10 should have been enough. Two things stick out when looking at Jennings’ route charts provided by Next Gen Stats. First, he instantly returned to a double-digit workload. No asterisks are needed here. Yes, Aiyuk was out, but Christian McCaffrey was back for his first game. George Kittle was (relatively) healthy. Even rookie Ricky Pearsall had a 70.0% route rate. And yet, Jennings pulls up after a two-game absence with a gaudy 33.0% target share. The second part is his route depth. Week 7: 9.3 (air yards per target), 46.9% (Passing Success Rate) Week 8: 7.4, 42.9% Week 10: 7.0, 56.4% Week 11: 5.5, 53.3% Schemed-up receivers turning short and intermediate catches into explosive plays had been a staple of the 49ers offense for years. It’s been part of why we, as a football community, have debated Brock Purdy’s contribution to the offense since he became the starter. However, only Anthony Richardson had a higher passing aDOT through the first month and a half of the season. CMC’s return not only added another option but enabled more concepts that took more off Purdy’s shoulders. Back in that Week 3 explosion for Jennings, he averaged 12.4 air yards per target. Fast forward to Week 10, it was down to 7.6. We’re not only getting the volume from Jennings, but also high-percentage looks boosting his weekly floor. Even with San Francisco’s slim hopes of a playoff spot, we have a sense of how the offense runs with everyone healthy. Jennings has led the team in targets in two consecutive games (11 and 10) with the highest slot target rate of the 49ers’ receivers. If pressured, Purdy has looked to Jennings (five targets) the same number of times he’s thrown to McCaffrey and Kittle. Jennings is the team’s WR1 and should have top-24 value for the rest of the fantasy season. If you passed on Brock Bowers during your draft, I get it. We only start one TE. Rookies are tough to project. Plus, for Bowers specifically, he had target earners around him. But history highlights why finding prospects like Bowers can change your season. Target Share (correlation to fantasy points): 0.62 (r-squared value) TPRR: 0.34 Route Rate: 0.27 On the one hand, saying targets and running a bunch of routes equals fantasy points sounds overly simplistic. But the receiving component of the TE position is what matters to us. I’ve yet to play in a points-per-block league. Using the '23 season as a proxy, five of the top six TEs all had target shares of 20.0% or more. Nobody’s route participation rate was below 70.0%. So, on the other hand, prioritizing pass-catching talent can give you an edge. However, in the case of Bowers, the advantage is even greater. Watching Bowers snap off routes and instantly create separation backs up what his route tree shows. He’s a receiver playing TE. His 16 targets on Sunday match the third-most of any TE over the last five years. Bowers has had more pass attempts thrown his way (89) than Justin Jefferson (86). At 16.0 PPR PPG, the Raiders’ TE1 would be the WR10 ahead of Garrett Wilson. But the workload superlatives only go so far for our purposes. Volume can’t be Bowers’ only path to production. He has Gardner Minshew throwing him the ball. Las Vegas has a bottom-five rank in yards per drive and an offensive line sitting at 23rd in pass-block win rate. I’d be more concerned, except check the route depths for Bowers against the Dolphins. For all their other issues on offense, the scheme has revolved around finding ways to get their rookie the ball. Here is every reception by #Raiders TE Brock Bowers in Week 2: pic.twitter.com/7XZI1qFfIw — Marcus Mosher (@Marcus_Mosher) September 17, 2024 Bowers’ 5.4 air yards per target are ahead of only Cade Otton and Will Dissly. Even better, Bowers leads all TEs in looks with an average time to throw less than 2.5 seconds. In other words, the plan is to quickly get the ball out of Minshew’s hands and over to Bowers. Unsurprisingly, he’s one of the five players at his position with a YAC per reception over five yards. At worst, we’ve got a high-end WR2 we can play in our TE spot. For dynasty managers, don’t rejoice just yet. We’ve seen offenses shift when WRs develop. Just ask Sam LaPorta. But for the remainder of this season, there’s no more context needed. Bowers has the talent and scheme to overcome his poor situation. And with positive matchups throughout the fantasy playoffs (KC, TB, and JAX), Bowers will be one of the pieces you need to secure a championship. Kliff Kingsbury was the first person I thought about during the Commanders’ loss in TNF. Actually, I have Jayden Daniels on a couple of squads, so my mind was already there. Regardless, I figured our collective attention would turn to OC because, well, we’ve been here before. I asked Kliff Kingsbury about having Kyler Murray call the plays via radio on Saturday: ""I just wanted him to know that, 'Hey, this shit ain't easy.' Every now and then, he starts shaking his head when I'm calling it in there. I’m like, 'Alright, go ahead big dog.'"" — Josh Weinfuss (@joshweinfuss) August 4, 2022 Arizona fans know the story currently unfolding in Washington well. Kingsbury will cook up a dynamic game plan that will have the offense humming early in the year. In 2021, you’d find the Cardinals in the top 10 for any efficiency metric in Weeks 1-8. But they slid to the middle of the pack to close out the season after Kyler Murray’s return in Week 13. And after a seven-game losing streak to end Kingsbury’s stint in Arizona, we all needed a trip to Thailand to recover. However, I’m not placing all of the blame on him just yet. Nobody knew or would admit to knowing when Jayden got hurt postgame. It seemed apparent it occurred on the 46-yard run with the awkward finish. On the next play, he grabbed at his ribs following the handoff.(Sidebar: The outside alley looks tasty) pic.twitter.com/Q02tfYW1yF — Ben Standig (@BenStandig) October 21, 2024 Daniels missed the rest of the above Week 7 game after his 46-yard scamper. Fantasy managers breathed a sigh of relief when they got their QB1 back in Week 8, but the recent results have been underwhelming. He’s been outside the top 20 in consecutive weeks. And a quick check on his superpower points to a glaring problem. Scramble Rate: 15.0% (Pre Rib Injury), 9.5% (Post Rib Injury) Designed Rushing Rate: 12.7%, 7.5% Rushing FPPG: 9.4, 2.8 Daniels was averaging 53.7 yards per game as a runner before he got hurt. At the time, that was more than Breece Hall (51.8). But Daniels’ legs provided more than points to people who had him on their roster. They lifted the floor of the entire offense. Daniels’ ability to keep plays alive and draw defenders in only to uncork a ball downfield is something LSU fans routinely experienced. Now, the injury has forced him to be more of a dropback passer. And it’s not like he’s been able to turn to his non-McLaurin options during this time. Luke McCaffrey has 13 catches on the season. Zach Ertz, at 34 years old, is Washington’s second-best option. However, with a limited throwing ability, throws that looked routine earlier are stalling out drives lately. 2 plays here - 1st clip from the Giants game 2 weeks ago, 2nd from last night. Similar types of throws, very different outcomes for Jayden Daniels. Have to wonder about his rib injury on a short week pic.twitter.com/VeI9HJuPmA — Mark Bullock (@MarkBullockNFL) November 15, 2024 But like I said, I’m not giving up on the play-calling. Let’s remember who Daniels had to face with the rib injury. Pittsburgh came into the game with the same plan as the Giants: blitz him. Both defensive units sent five or more rushers on over 50.0% of his dropbacks. However, the Steelers knew how to account for Daniels on the ground when compressing the pocket. The Eagles had the secondary to put a cap on explosive plays. Last Thursday was his first game without a completed deep shot in five weeks. Luckily, the schedule opens up starting Sunday. Washington has Dallas, Tennessee, and the (heavily) injured Saints in the fantasy playoffs. All three have allowed at least one QB1 finish over the last three weeks. The mini-bye gives Daniels extra time to rest. His matchups will put him back in the top-12 conversation. I led off last week’s piece with expectations about the return of Nico Collins. Since Houston capped off Week 11 in primetime, let’s see if having their WR1 back had the desired effect. Route Rate: 55.0% Targets: 7 (22.0% share) PPR Points: 9.4 (WR45 on the week) Now, in Collins’s defense (and the fantasy managers rostering him), he had a 77-yard TD catch off a screen pass called back on a holding penalty. Also, on that run after the catch, Collins pulls away from S Donovan Wilson. Even though it didn’t count, it was an encouraging sign about his health. If the Texans hadn’t been beating the brakes off the Cowboys, Collins might have run more routes. Regardless, even with the disappointment in the box score, Houston’s passing game improved like I had hoped. EPA per DB: -0.15 (Weeks 7-10), 0.29 (Week 11) Completion Percentage Over Expected: -8.0%, -5.3% Explosive Pass Rate: 13.6%, 16.7% To be fair, C.J. Stroud didn’t produce perfect film. His interception highlighted some of the mechanical issues that have plagued him throughout the season. But his down-to-down efficiency hit its third-highest mark of the season (50.0% passing success rate). And part of the uptick was due to something I noted last week: “The Texans used quick-game concepts (passes with an average time to throw under 2.5 seconds) on 44.0% of Stroud’s dropbacks in Weeks 1-4. Unsurprisingly, Collins led the team in targets on these concepts (23) at a clip of 2.97 yards per route run. Put another way, he turned those 23 looks into 14 first downs.” Against the Cowboys' pass rush, Stroud’s average time to throw was 2.48 seconds. That’s his fastest release in a single game all season. Accordingly, he faced pressure at the lowest rate since Week 7 (29.6%). As expected, Collins turned half of his receptions on quick-game concepts into first downs. Tank Dell generated an explosive on one of his. Collins’ return brought a missing piece back to the offense. And looking at Houston’s upcoming schedule (Titans, Jaguars), he came back at just the right time for fantasy managers."

Red Bull is third and 49 points back of McLaren.,"As Max Verstappen can wrap up the 2024 Formula 1 driver’s title this weekend in Las Vegas, the constructor’s championship is likely to go to the final race of the season. And Red Bull has very little chance of winning it. Thanks to a strong summer from both of its drivers, McLaren leads the constructor’s standings by 36 points over Ferrari with three races to go. The Scuderia are 13 points ahead of Red Bull in third. Red Bull entered the season as the prohibitive favorites for the constructor’s title. And for good reason. Verstappen and teammate Sergio Perez won 21 of 22 races in 2023 as Red Bull’s cars were miles better than anyone else. That advantage looked to carry over into 2024. Verstappen won four of the first five races of the season. Carols Sainz’s victory at the Australian Grand Prix came after Verstappen was forced to retire the car in the opening laps because of a brake fire. But McLaren’s upgrades at Miami in May set the stage for a summer where Red Bull found itself on the back foot. Lando Norris got the win in South Florida, though Verstappen won three of the next four races. Since then, however, Mercedes-powered cars went on a run. McLaren and Mercedes drivers won five straight races over the summer and seven of eight. Ferrari, meanwhile, won three races before Versrappen finally got back to victory lane in Brazil on Nov. 3. If and when Verstappen wins a fourth straight championship and unless Red Bull can pull off a miracle comeback over the final three races, the 2024 season will be just the third since the turn of the century where the champion driver’s team didn’t win the constructor’s title. And if Red Bull can’t pass either McLaren or Ferrari, the team’s third-place finish in the constructor’s standings will be the lowest finish for a team with the champion driver since Williams was fourth in 1982. Quite frankly, Red Bull can blame its poor constructor’s standing performance directly on Perez. Verstappen has scored 393 of the team’s 544 points so far this season. He’s ahead of Mercedes in fourth all on his own. Perez is mired in eighth in the standings and 39 points back of seventh. He has the fewest points of any driver on the top four teams and has borne the brunt of the lack of Red Bull car superiority. Perez had three seconds and a third over the first five races of the season. He hasn’t finished on the podium since and has five finishes outside the points over the last 16 races. Ferrari, meanwhile, has been keeping pace with McLaren. Charles Leclerc has two wins and over the past nine races and hasn’t finished any lower than fifth in that span. Sainz won two races ago in Mexico City, and has finished in the top seven in all but three races so far this season. McLaren is still the deserved favorite, however. The team is -700 to take the driver’s title at BetMGM as both Norris and Oscar Piastri keep scoring points on a regular basis. Both drivers have finished in the points over the last 10 races, and Norris’ only non-points finish of the season came in Austria when he tangled with Verstappen while racing for the lead in the waning laps. If McLaren wins the constructor’s title, it’ll be the team’s first in 26 seasons. Though Mika Hakkinen won the driver’s title in 1999 and Lewis Hamilton scored the championship in 2008 while driving for McLaren, the team hasn’t won the constructor’s crown since Hakkinen scored his first title in 1998. A ninth constructor’s title will move McLaren from a tie with Mercedes in third to a tie with Williams for the second-most team championships in F1 history. If Ferrari can overcome that 36-point deficit in three races, the Scuderia will add a 17th title to their resume."

Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games","Forever a basketball school, Curt Cignetti has awakened a 'sleeping giant' of a football program at Indiana",https://sports.yahoo.com/forever-a-basketball-school-curt-cignetti-has-awakened-a-sleeping-giant-of-a-football-program-at-indiana-133249231.html,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 13:32:49 GMT",The Hoosiers will play in a top-five football game Saturday. How did it all happen? It begins with a fiery and confident coach who earned his way up through the ranks and a Hoosier team that's adopted his personality.,"BLOOMINGTON, Ind. — On the practice fields of West Virginia University, in the late 1970s, the son of the Mountaineers head football coach served as a problematic scout team quarterback. Frank Cignetti’s boy insisted on throwing passes to whoever he wanted, disregarding the scout team cue cards that a young assistant coach named Nick Saban flashed toward him. An angry Saban kept reminding Curt Cignetti to follow the play as drawn on the play cards with the intended receiver circled. This is where you throw the ball! “He was such a competitive guy, he wanted to beat the defense,” Saban remembers. “He’d throw it wherever he thought he had the best chance to make a play.” Saban was there to remind Curt that this wasn’t a pro football tryout. “You ain’t gonna make the New York Jets down here!” Saban once snapped at him. More than 40 years later, that young, feisty scout team quarterback sits on a leather couch in his new office within Indiana’s football stadium. He’s now 63 years old, is finally a head coach in major college football and is in the midst of leading the Hoosiers to the greatest season in school history — the architect of one of the most improbable turnarounds ever witnessed in the sport. Curt Cignetti still commands that competitive fire of his youth. In fact, he doesn’t act (or look) like he’s in his 60s. He still bucks societal norms. He doesn’t really play by your rules. For instance, did you see his comments last December when, before coaching a single game, he bad-mouthed his new Big Ten rivals? How about in July, when he claimed the Hoosiers would reach the conference championship game? Or what about just last week, when he referred to the program as an “emerging superpower.” He’s boastful and he’s brash. He’ll tell you that he’ll beat you and then he’ll do it. After all, he’s won seven conference or division championships in 13 years as a head coach at the Division II, FCS and Group of Five levels. He’s taken risks that few coaches would consider, worked at places no one wanted to go and won at schools that few have. For all of his bold blustering, he’s quite charming in person, kind and welcoming but as confident a man as you’ll meet. In fact, the way his wife tells it, Curt predicted last November that the Hoosiers would win the first 10 games of his inaugural season before he even accepted the job. “Don’t you remember saying that?” she asked him recently. “Uh, no,” he replied. Maybe Curt Cignetti is a sort-of soothsayer or perhaps he was just that confident in his ability to overhaul a roster by bringing in 27 transfer players, most of them, like the coach himself, from the Group of Five level, and all of them playing with a I-belong-here attitude as they mow through a manageable schedule. “It’s not as much a surprise to me as it is for everyone else,” he confidently boasts. But this? Surely, he couldn’t have expected this: nine wins by double figures; a defense surrendering the second-best yards-per-play rate in the country (4.1); an offense that’s scored more touchdowns than anyone else (57); a No. 5 ranking; a school-record win streak. Indiana, the basketball school with the famous candy-striped pants, the Big Ten’s football cellar-dweller, is involved in college football’s premier game of the weekend. That is a shocking revelation of historic proportions. For the first time in their history, the Hoosiers will play in a top-five regular season football game Saturday when they travel to meet No. 2 Ohio State in Columbus — a matchup, one might describe, between major college football’s biggest historical loser and its biggest historical winner. “Well,” says Saban, “they’re going to have their hands full this week.” For Pete Yonkman, the march to this point for Indiana football began more than a year ago. That’s when school administrators answered an important question. How much should we really be investing in football? “We weren’t having a great season. By that point, it was obvious that if you didn’t have great NIL opportunities, it was going to be hard,” said Yonkman, president of a medical device company and a longtime IU booster who chairs the school’s NIL collective. “There were a lot of folks who said, ‘Maybe we should just give up on football and focus on basketball.’” For athletic director Scott Dolson, that was not an option. The sport of football continues to distance itself from all others as the revenue-generating giant driving the most transformative time in the industry. Behind the conference realignment shifts, billion-dollar television contracts and athlete compensation debate is a common denominator: football. The biggest football brands are consolidating to strike richer football-rooted television deals, a portion of which will, ultimately, be distributed to football players. De-investing in football, or even remaining at status quo, is a risky endeavor for athletic departments that so heavily rely on its revenues to operate other sports and, soon enough, need it to produce enough cash to dispense to athletes as part of the House settlement-related revenue sharing beginning next fall. In so many words, says Yonkman, without a successful football program, it is difficult to have success in all other sports, including basketball. That’s a message he used with donors last fall and winter when he helped double IU’s NIL collective budget to, he says, the “high single-digit millions,” a move that funded Cignetti’s program-changing transfer portal haul. “It’s no secret that football brings in 80% or more of revenue to our athletic department,” Yonkman said. “If you’re not competitive in football, we stand a chance of being left behind.” Left behind? As media giants shift more of their revenues toward successful football programs and as conferences further reward their members with football-related initiatives, those not excelling, or investing, in the sport operate in fear of the ramifications. Washington State president Kirk Schulz, his school quite literally left behind in the Pac-12, describes it as a “curing of conferences,” a concept that many within the industry expect to continue: bigger brands leaving behind their little brothers as the industry evolves. Without mentioning it specifically, Dolson seems to realize this fact. “In the Big Ten, you need to be relevant in football to be a relevant member in your conference,” he says. “We don't take for granted that we’re always a long-standing member of the Big Ten. We want to pay our fair share and be a valued member in football.” To that end, the investments began, the most recent of which was announced over the weekend: a new, eight-year contract for Cignetti that doubles his salary to $8 million with further resource commitments, such as stadium enhancements and athlete and staff compensation. But before all that, the school paid $15.5 million to fire coach Tom Allen, increased the staff salary pool for Cignetti and doubled that NIL budget. However, the most important investment may not have been an investment at all. A comprehensive study that the university commissioned on its football program produced an area needing improvement: scheduling. It was time to schedule more strategically. For instance, Dolson says, Indiana was originally scheduled to play at Louisville this season. The school paid $1 million to cancel the game, replacing an ACC opponent on the road for an FCS opponent at home, Western Illinois, which IU beat 77-3. “This is part of a plan,” Dolson now says. In a tiff of irony, Indiana’s schedule this season is at the center of controversy. The schedule ranks as the easiest of any power conference program vying for a berth in the 12-team playoff. Currently, just one of its first 10 opponents holds a winning record (6-5 Washington) — a product of both the Big Ten’s expansion to 18 teams (IU misses most of those teams in the top half) and a disappointing season from their last opponent, defending national champion Michigan (5-5). The schedule has come under fire, from both large swaths of fans and directly from the College Football Playoff committee, whose members factor in schedule strength. Ohio State is likely to represent the Hoosiers’ only ranked challenge of the regular season. Could an 11-1 Indiana be left out of the postseason? “Week-in and week-out, it’s ‘Who have they played?’” said Aiden Fisher, Indiana’s star linebacker. “After each game, we’re like ‘What are they going to say now?!’” A smirking Fisher gestures toward the Ohio State game. “In about a week, I’d love to hear what people have to say after that.” Curt Cignetti’s office is pristine. Everything is in its rightful place. Atop his desk, papers are perfectly stacked. No edge bent. No angle off. He is neat, clean and orderly. “I’m a real organized, structured, borderline OCD kind of guy,” Cignetti says. Through the years, some of Nick Saban’s best assistants were the obsessive-compulsive types. They are normally driven to pay great attention to detail, he says. Some 30 years after he joined Frank Cignetti’s staff at West Virginia, Saban hired the man’s son to join him in 2007 to start building the Alabama football program. For four years, Curt Cignetti served as Bama’s recruiting coordinator and receivers coach, tutoring the likes of Julio Jones and helping the Crimson Tide win two SEC titles and the 2009 national championship. Cignetti describes the four-year stretch as a “doctorate level course” in building a program, from the structure, organization, practice, in-game philosophy and, maybe most important, “how to keep people on their toes when they’re winning all the time.” Cignetti talks a lot like Saban. He uses the lingo, the buzz words, the vocabulary. Process. Accountability. Standards. Improving daily. Mental approach. Never satisfied. Like Saban, he’s demanding, too. Certain things fluster and frustrate him, much like his former boss. Take for instance his first few days in Bloomington, when he detected an obvious level of doubt about the football program’s future. Sewed deeply into the fabric here is a level of losing that virtually no other major conference program can claim: three winning seasons in nearly three decades. Cignetti arrived on campus in early December to a community suffering from another post-traumatic episode after another losing year. They had already moved on to basketball season. In fact, one of his first questions as the football coach was about basketball. Boy, says Yonkman, that really got him fired up. It made him mad enough that he marched over to the basketball arena and delivered those now-famous comments in the middle of a game. “I’ve never taken a backseat to anybody and don’t plan on starting now,” he said, pausing for dramatic effect as the crowd roared. “Purdue sucks! But so does Michigan and Ohio State!” It signaled a confidence not seen around here in years, perhaps even decades. The expectations and the culture began to change. And that’s not easy. Even Yonkman acknowledges that he’d “gotten that way” about football. Around here, he says, “You literally have to shake that out of people.” Consider it shaken. “There was sort of a dark cloud lingering over the football program here,” Cignetti says. “A lot of people had given up on it, to be honest with you. That sort of attitude permeated people outside the university, too. I could sense it talking to the media. It was my first day here. I could just feel it and I didn’t like it. I wasn’t going to have any of it.” He wasn’t done. After his very first game of the season, Cignetti pulled a page from the Saban book. He publicly chided fans for leaving at halftime of the win over Florida International. “We’ve got to keep the people in the seats,” he told reporters. These two, Saban and Cignetti, share plenty more. At the center of that is their bond with one man: the now-departed Frank Cignetti. Saban calls Frank “the best recruiter I was ever around.” His presentations during in-home visits and his organization were the best Saban had seen at that point in his career. His son is a lot like dad, he says: a heck of a recruiter who is “football intuitive” and “always inquisitive of how to do something better.” It’s the non-football piece that separates the good coaches from the great ones, the stuff off the field. Cignetti is always searching to find motivation for himself and his team, for instance, always emphasizing the psychological part of the game. In another Saban staple, Cignetti says football is 95% “between the ears.” “I’ve always functioned best when I got a chip on my shoulder,” he says, “and I do my best weekly to find one if it doesn’t exist already.” He doesn’t have to look very far. And neither does his team. In July, media voters picked Indiana to finish 17th of 18 Big Ten teams. No one here has forgotten it. “They said we had too many Group of Five players,” Fisher, the linebacker, bemoans. “We’ve put that in the back of our mind. We remember it.” One thing is certain: Indiana’s transfer portal haul, while incredibly productive, was derived almost exclusively from the Group of Five level. Of the 27 transfers, 21 came from the FCS or G5 ranks, with 13 of those following Cignetti from his former school, James Madison. Twenty of them have been major contributors. Indiana’s top four tacklers are first-year transfers. So are the top four rushers and the top four receivers. Its leader in sacks is a transfer, Mikail Kamara, and its long snapper is a transfer, too. Starting tight end? Transfer. Starting quarterback? Transfer. Cignetti’s takeover and subsequent roster overhaul was business-like, says Kurtis Rourke, the team’s quarterback from Ohio who’s thrown for 21 touchdowns to four picks this year. “He started to weed out who was going to help or hurt the team,” Rourke says. “He didn’t care about feelings. He wanted to set a tone and develop a culture. He earned a lot of respect from us.” The buzz in Bloomington is palpable. Dolson refers to the football program as a “sleeping giant” that just needed a hard nudge. “We’ve got a strong alumni base that has been waiting for football to have a season like this,” he said. Now they are downright giddy. Just a few weeks ago, while Fisher ate with his mother at a local restaurant, a man screamed across the venue, “Hey, Aiden. You want a beer?!” Rourke can’t even order pizza under his real name. He showed up at the pizza place to guffawing restaurant workers. It’s really you!? Fisher and the rest of the JMU group “facilitated” the change in culture here, Cignetti says — perhaps a reason it has happened so quickly. They knew the process, the culture, the expectation. Cignetti works quickly and efficiently. Practices rarely go much longer than 90 minutes. Punctuality is key. The group of transfers has a sort-of nickname for themselves: the Group of Five All-Stars. “We’ve all got that edge,” Fisher says. “‘I’ve always deserved to be here in the spotlight.’” Their coach isn’t so different either. He spent nearly 30 years as an assistant and another 13 as head coach at places like the Indiana University of Pennsylvania and Elon University. “It took me a while, right?” Cignetti says. “I had to take the path less traveled to get to where I am. A little something to prove.” It’s a path that Saban originally discouraged him from taking. After Alabama’s 2010 football season, Cignetti was a finalist to be the head coach at Kent State, Saban’s alma mater. The school instead hired Darrell Hazell. Distraught and with a burning desire to be a head coach, Cignetti accepted the job at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, where his father won 14 conference or division titles in 20 years as coach, a stint that ended in 2005. Saban warned Cignetti, “You can get lost down there.” He went anyway. “I woke up many mornings like, ‘What did I do?’” Cignetti now chuckles. “But we got things rolling.” Six years and 53 wins later, Elon, an FCS school in North Carolina, hired him. He led the Phoenix to their first consecutive playoff trips, including a stunning win at James Madison, which in turn hired Cignetti as coach. At JMU, he presided over the program during its transition into FBS, winning a division or conference title each of his five seasons and leading the Dukes to an 11-1 mark in 2023. Saban’s biggest concern — “you kind of get stuck” at the lower levels — never panned out. Not with Cignetti. “He was willing to spend almost 20 years in non-high-profile programs and had success at every one of them,” Saban says. “It’s pretty phenomenal. It’s harder to have success at those places. You don’t always have the resources. A lot of people aren’t willing to do that. They’re going to go some place where they know they can be successful. He was willing to take the risk and it paid off.” Quite literally. Now, so many years later, here he is. The $8 Million Dollar Man, leading a basketball school into a top-five showdown against one of the country’s biggest football brands. The talent disparity between the two programs is striking — a team full of four- and five-star talent with a roster worth upwards of $20 million versus a team of… G5 All-Stars. It’s a true David vs. Goliath. Upstart program vs. perennial power. Little brother against big. IU has lost 28 straight games to Ohio State and has won just 12 of their 98 meetings. The Buckeyes have twice the number of all-time wins as Indiana, 39 conference titles to two, have produced four times the number of NFL Draft picks and have played in 42 more bowl games. They are 11-point favorites playing in front of a rocking home crowd while ranked No. 2 in the country. Can that former feisty scout team quarterback take down the Buckeyes? “Look,” Cignetti said this week, “we've got a group of guys and coaches that have won 24 out of their last 25 games, so we don't have a confidence problem. I look at maybe one time at Elon we had a really good football team. We were 4-1, had lost to an FBS team and went to JMU. They had won about 25 in a row at home. “Somehow, we’re 38-point underdogs — I have no idea how — and we walked out of there with a win. It's a football game.” Ross DellengerSenior College Football Reporter Ross Dellenger joined Yahoo Sports in July 2023 as its senior college football reporter.

John Tomase breaks it all down.","From Nick Pivetta to Bryan Mata, evaluating a busy day for Red Sox originally appeared on NBC Sports Boston Making sense of a flurry of Red Sox moves over the last 24 hours... First, serious props to chief baseball officer Craig Breslow for correctly reading Nick Pivetta's market. When the Red Sox tendered the right-hander a qualifying offer two weeks ago, plenty of us (raises hand) questioned the wisdom of committing $21 million to a relatively average pitcher on the assumption that he would almost certainly accept said offer (raises hand again). But Pivetta had other ideas. With front offices increasingly basing their decisions less on the finished dessert and more on the ingredients, so to speak, Pivetta clearly believes he'll have a market. His combination of high strikeout rate and low walk rate is enticing, even if he's a 4.00 ERA guy at his best. So he declined the offer and will enter free agency in search of a multi-year deal. Assuming Pivetta signs elsewhere, the Red Sox will receive a compensatory draft pick at the end of the second round, which would offset the loss of any picks that come with signing a top free agent, like Juan Soto, Corbin Burnes, or others. ... The Red Sox added two players to their 40-man roster ahead of the Rule 5 draft: right-hander Hunter Dobbins, and outfielder Jhostynxon Garcia. Dobbins was just named their Minor League Pitcher of the Year and is a rotation depth option. At age 25, coming off 25 effective starts between Double- and Triple-A, he was a strong candidate to be selected. Garcia, who is nicknamed ""The Password,"" soared from Low-A to Double-A while mashing 23 homers. Baseball America ranks him as Boston's No. 18 prospect. Of more interest is whom the Red Sox didn't protect. Former Tigers All-Star and Rookie of the Year Michael Fulmer signed a two-year minor-league contract last winter while rehabbing from elbow surgery. Depending on where he is in his rehab, he could be enticing to an organization as a no-risk flier. Then again, if the Red Sox know this and would've protected him if they felt he was close to reclaiming his past form. ... And finally, a cautionary tale. To make room for Dobbins and Garcia, the Red Sox designated right-handers Isaiah Campbell and Bryan Mata for assignment. The former is the answer to a trivia question: Whom did Breslow acquire in his first trade? (Campbell arrived from the Mariners for infielder Luis Urias last November). The latter is the cautionary tale. Mata once ranked as the organization's top pitching prospect, but injuries and ineffectiveness completely derailed his career. Remember that the next time someone tries to tell you the Red Sox can't trade a prospect because he might be a piece of the future, or argues that there's a looming roster crunch and oh no, what are we going to do – more often than not, even highly-ranked prospects end up missing."

Herbst has three wins over 175 starts in the Xfinity Series and has run full time for Stewart-Haas Racing for the past four seasons. 23XI Racing had long been rumored to expand to three cars next season, though it was unclear how its lawsuit against NASCAR would impact those plans. 23XI and Front Row Motorsports filed an anti-trust lawsuit against NASCAR over the sanctioning body’s franchising agreement. In the suit, the two teams accuse NASCAR of monopolistic business practices. NASCAR recently removed a legal action clause in its participation terms that allows both FRM and 23XI to compete as open teams in 2025 if their lawsuit isn’t successful or if they haven’t signed the charter agreement by the 2025 Daytona 500. Open teams are not guaranteed starting berths in any Cup Series race and receive a lesser share of purse money. Front Row is also expanding to three cars next season. Both teams were set to buy charters from the now-closed Stewart-Haas Racing. But since the teams themselves don’t have their own two charters, the immediate outcome of the charter purchases is unclear because of the lawsuit. Herbst won two races in 2024 and finished a career-best seventh in the points standings. His second victory came in the season finale at Phoenix Raceway. He got the first win of his career in 2023 in his hometown of Las Vegas. Herbst, whose family has a chain of convenience stores, has been sponsored by Monster for nearly the entirety of his career.

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games","With this masterful job, it's time for Mike Tomlin to finally win NFL Coach of the Year",https://sports.yahoo.com/with-this-masterful-job-its-time-for-mike-tomlin-to-finally-win-nfl-coach-of-the-year-144516742.html,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 14:45:16 GMT",The Steelers have shocked the NFL with their 8-2 record this season.,"The Baltimore Ravens lined up for a 2-point conversion and the tie last Sunday against the Pittsburgh Steelers. First place in the AFC North was at stake. Only 1:06 remained in the game. The Ravens presumably dialed up their best 2-point play And Mike Tomlin stopped it. Literally. Tomlin called timeout right before the 2-point try was snapped. He timed it so the Ravens had to show the beginning of the play, which was Lamar Jackson on the move to his right. The Ravens scrapped that play, had Jackson go left after the timeout, and it had no chance. The Steelers stopped it to win 18-16, improving to a surprising 8-2 this season. Tomlin's timeout wasn't particularly groundbreaking. But in a league that sees game-management issues from coaches every week, it was another reminder that Tomlin knows how to win games. ""Thankfully we even saw some of the semblance of the schematics of what they intended to run,"" Tomlin told the media after the game. ""I think that made them change and go the other direction. And obviously, particularly Mr. Jackson is a little less dangerous when he's going to his left than his right, so we're thankful for that."" NFL Coach of the Year is a weird award. It rarely goes to the league's best coach, as strange as that sounds. It usually goes to the coach of whichever team most exceeds preseason expectation. The Steelers typically have high expectations. So Tomlin, who has famously never had a losing season in his (soon-to-be) 18 years as head coach, has never won the award. It's probably time for that to change this season. If the season ended today, here are the top six teams in the AFC and their quarterback. One of the situations is not like the other: Kansas City Chiefs: Patrick Mahomes Buffalo Bills: Josh Allen Houston Texans: C.J. Stroud Los Angeles Chargers: Justin Herbert Baltimore Ravens: Lamar Jackson ... and the Pittsburgh Steelers: Justin Fields and Russell Wilson That's five of the 10 best quarterbacks in the NFL, and the Steelers' duo of castoffs. Fields was acquired for a sixth-round draft pick after the Chicago Bears moved on. Wilson was signed for $1.2 million after he was cut following a disastrous two seasons with the Denver Broncos. Most coaches without a top quarterback fail. Some coaches who are gifted a good quarterback can't get to the playoffs. Tomlin took the spare ingredients he was given and has made a gourmet meal. Tomlin ended up managing his less-than-ideal quarterback situation perfectly too. Fields started the first six games due to Wilson's calf injury and the Steelers went 4-2. Most coaches would have stuck with the status quo. It would have appeased the crowd that believes quarterbacks and not teams should be assigned win-loss records. But Tomlin went to Wilson, who was bad for the Broncos and ineffective this preseason. Nobody seemed to agree with the move. Tomlin said he was the ""lone ranger"" among his staff on making the change. The offense took off with Wilson, averaging 27.3 points in his four starts. The Steelers are 4-0 since the change. They weren't picked by many to be a playoff team this season. Yet they're 8-2, one of only five teams with two or fewer losses this season, and have to be considered a threat to win the second Super Bowl in Tomlin's tenure. There is already some revisionist history on the switch to Wilson. Some will say they believed Wilson could revive his career at age 35. Those are mostly lies. Very, very few thought Wilson could still play at a high level. Tomlin made a move that was questioned, mocked or both. The Steelers haven't lost since. Tomlin never posting a losing season has been repeated so often that it has become a punch line, but there's a reason that fact got beaten into the ground. To go 18 seasons and never be below .500 (assuming the Steelers win one more game) is amazing, especially in a league that is designed to ensure parity. Tomlin already has a Hall of Fame résumé. Bill Cowher, the Steelers' head coach before Tomlin, is in the Hall of Fame, and Tomlin measures up well with him: Tomlin: 181-102-2 (.639 win percentage), 1 Super Bowl, 2 AFC titles Cowher: 149-190-1 (.623 win percentage), 1 Super Bowl, 2 AFC titles Tomlin has a higher win percentage than Hall of Fame coaches like Curly Lambeau, Cowher, Bud Grant, Joe Gibbs, Bill Walsh and Tom Landry. Tomlin has just one Super Bowl victory and an 8-10 record in the playoffs — the many Steelers fans who have been laughably impatient with Tomlin through the years will point out those facts often — and that is what separates some of the other coaches who are already enshrined in Canton. But Tomlin's résumé is already better than some of the coaches in the Hall, and he's not close to being done at age 52. An NFL Coach of the Year award would help Tomlin's case. The fact that Tomlin hasn't won is a bigger statement on the flawed nature of the award than Tomlin himself. During Tomlin's near two-decade tenure in Pittsburgh, voters have determined that coaches like Mike Smith, Ron Rivera (twice), Jason Garrett, Matt Nagy and Brian Daboll deserved to win before Tomlin got one. Other coaches have a great case for the award this season. It's a deep race. But it would be strange for a coach with a Hall of Fame-level résumé, a Super Bowl ring and almost two decades of never posting a losing season to not win the award. It's strange to say about a coach with a championship, another Super Bowl appearance, seven division titles and 11 playoff berths, but this season might be Tomlin's best job. The group of people who picked the Steelers to win the AFC North and don't own at least three Terrible Towels might be infinitesimally small. But Tomlin keeps winning. Maybe we shouldn't be surprised the Steelers are in first place in late November. A few times through the years, as the Steelers fell short in the playoffs, the franchise has had to go against some public sentiment to keep extending Tomlin and its five-plus-decades long streak of never firing a coach. But the Steelers knew what they had with Tomlin. Other franchises can learn a lesson from that."

But after the Boston Bruins fired their coach, how is every other coach doing?","James Guillory-Imagn Images Welcome back to The Hockey News' NHL power rankings. Every Wednesday, we'll rank all 32 teams based on their weekly performance. In the cap era, winning the Jack Adams might as well be the death knell. Despite guiding the Bruins to an astonishing 120-41-23 record over two-plus seasons, ranking first in the NHL during that span in points percentage and winning the award for the league’s best coach in 2023, Jim Montgomery was fired Tuesday. It’s a cruel world. Montgomery was not the one who built the Bruins roster, nor was he responsible for the contract standoff with Jeremy Swayman. The thing with the NHL, however, is that there’s now a very good coach available, and the Montgomery may be the first domino to fall in a league that likes to recycle coaches. This week’s power rankings muses which coaches might be feeling the heat. Montgomery’s firing overshadows the fact that there is a new No. 1 in the NHL power rankings. It’s been a difficult season to prognosticate the elite contenders and lottery-bound teams. Unlike last season where the Sharks were undeniably the worst, there are 10 teams within four points of each other at the bottom of the standings, and seven of those 10 teams are within four points of a wild-card spot. 1. Carolina Hurricanes (13-4-0, +27). Last week: 2) Under Rod Brind’Amour, the Hurricanes since 2018-19 rank: second in points percentage (.667), sixth in goals-for per game (3.24), second in goals against per game (2.58), ninth in power-play percentage (22.3), first in penalty-kill percentage (85.0), second in shots-for per game (33.8) and first in shots against per game (27.5). His job’s as safe as it can be. 2. Winnipeg Jets (16-3-0, +34. Last week: 1) Promoted from an associate coaching position and even taking over briefly when Rick Bowness was absent, Scott Arniel’s been a popular homegrown hire who spent large parts of his playing career with the Jets as well. He’s a front-runner for the Jack Adams, and it’s pretty remarkable how different the Jets are under Arniel even though he inherited a roster without any significant changes. 3. Minnesota Wild (12-3-3, +18. Last week: 4) I know Matt Boldy at center was temporary, but sometimes John Hynes makes decisions that make me go, “… hmm?” No matter, the Wild have been excellent thanks to their improved goaltending, which is one of the biggest factors for getting Jack Adams consideration. 4. Toronto Maple Leafs (11-6-2, +8. Last week: 7) Before you accuse me of Leafs bias – which would be the furthest thing from the truth – they are 5-2-1 in November with wins against the Capitals and Oilers. I’m not sure the Leafs are necessarily better, but they’re certainly different under Craig Berube, and that was part of the point. The Leafs have continued to win consistently even without Auston Matthews. Related: Is Mitch Marner Better Without Auston Matthews? 5. Washington Capitals (13-4-1, +28. Last week: 5) What a turnaround by Spencer Carbery, and props to the Capitals for adding players who have all managed to fit in. The real test now comes with Alex Ovechkin out week-to-week with a lower-body injury. Carbery can earn the Jack Adams right here if the Caps can keep winning without their captain. 6. New York Rangers (12-4-1, +20. Last week: 6) The Rangers have a strong record, which means Peter Laviolette’s job is very safe, but I can’t help but notice they’ve had trouble beating the top-tier teams this season, including the Panthers, Capitals and Jets. Of the teams the Rangers have beaten this season, only three of them – the Leafs, Canucks and Islanders – are currently in playoff position. 7. New Jersey Devils (12-7-2, +16. Last week: 8) The Devils are gaining some serious momentum. After a four-game losing streak at the end of October, the Devils are 7-3-0. Strangely enough, they were shut out in all three losses. I don’t think it’s surprising at all that Sheldon Keefe has done a good job with the Devils. 8. Florida Panthers (12-6-1, +7. Last week: 3) Discounting the two seasons in Hartford as a first-time coach and the two seasons in Toronto, Paul Maurice is synonymous with longevity. He’s at 1,867 games and counting, and winning a Cup will buy you lots of time. 9. Dallas Stars (11-6-0, +17. Last week: 9) The thing about Peter DeBoer’s teams is that they generally win a lot of games until suddenly they don’t. After 328 games and a .607 points percentage with the Sharks, they suddenly go 15-16-2? Out. After 78 games across two shortened seasons and a .731 P% with the Knights, they miss the playoffs? Out. He’s super safe in Dallas, but it’s odd that some of their players are playing really well, and others have been downright terrible. Which way will the teeter-totter tilt? 10. Vegas Golden Knights (11-5-2, +15. Last week: 10) The Knights are no strangers to making significant changes when everyone least expects it, but with a Cup title, Bruce Cassidy’s job is most definitely safe right now. 11. Colorado Avalanche (10-9-0, -6. Last week: 12) Jared Bednar has a franchise cornerstone level of talent at his fingertips, but he’s been excellent at managing all sorts of injuries and off-ice issues thrown his way. Bednar is already the Avalanche's all-time leader in games and wins and trails only Marc Crawford and Bob Hartley in points percentage, though all three have rings. 12. Tampa Bay Lightning (10-6-1, +12. Last week: 18) Jon Cooper will go down as one of the best coaches ever and yet has never won the Jack Adams, which again highlights the award’s weird unwritten criteria – that it’s essentially awarded to the team with the most improved goaltending. 13. Edmonton Oilers (10-8-2, -7. Last week: 13) Their 5-2 win against the Senators was their first regulation in over a week, but slowly and surely, they’re getting back on the right track. Kris Knoblauch has not been able to capture last season’s magic but deserves the benefit of the doubt, and the poor goaltending is not his doing. 14. Vancouver Canucks (9-6-3, -2. Last week: 14) Like I said before, winning the Jack Adams feels like a bad omen. But Rick Tocchet seems to press the right buttons all the time, and keep in mind they’re without two-thirds of their top line with J.T. Miller and Brock Boeser out. Thatcher Demko has also yet to play a minute. The Canucks’ management team can be pretty aggressive and somewhat abrasive, but moving from Tocchet would just be a bad idea. Related: Vancouver Canucks Push On With Dad Strength And Support As J.T. Miller Takes Leave 15. Calgary Flames (10-6-3, -1. Last week: 17) I thought the four-game winning streak would signal a decline after the Flames seemingly overachieved early in the season, but Ryan Huska has really done a great job of keeping this team prepared and competitive. Having Dustin Wolf absolutely helps, and he deserves Calder consideration. Related: NHL Calder Trophy Tracker: Stankoven, Michkov And Hutson In Dead Heat, But Celebrini Lurks 16. Los Angeles Kings (10-6-3, +6. Last week: 11) Moving away from the 1-3-1 and therefore not killing all excitement in Kings games is already a feather in Jim Hiller’s cap. There’s no reason to think the Kings will make any drastic changes – like signing and trading Pierre-Luc Dubois within a year – but it is strange how inconsistent they can be. 17. Philadelphia Flyers (8-9-2, -11. Last week: 26) John Tortorella’s seat felt pretty hot after a 1-5-1 start, but in true Tortorella fashion, they’ve really grinded it out, and they’re now 4-1-1 in their last six. It’s lukewarm right now, at best, and I still feel he’s the right option for that market and that team. 18. Ottawa Senators (8-9-1, -1. Last week: 15) Travis Green was an interesting hire, and this new Sens ownership certainly seems more patient than the previous regime. The Sens are 0-2-1 over the past week with a minus-8 goal differential. Inconsistency is part of the Green experience, though once in a while, it can be exciting because of their explosive offense. 19. Seattle Kraken (9-9-1, even. Last week: 24) The Kraken make so few moves that I think even Ron Francis forgets he’s the GM. Either way, Dan Bylsma will get to address the Kraken’s inconsistency. They’ve already had four separate streaks of either three consecutive wins or losses this season. 20. New York Islanders (7-7-5, -7. Last week: 19) Lou Lamoriello can be so stubborn it hurts, but I think Patrick Roy’s done an alright job so far. He’s only had 56 games behind the bench, and sometimes, I think it’s more likely he gets fed up and goes back to junior hockey. 21. Buffalo Sabres (8-9-1, even. Last week: 16) My fear is the Sabres get so nostalgic that replacing Lindy Ruff becomes more difficult than it really should be. He’s one of a trio of Jack Adams finalists in 2023 who have since been fired – the others were Montgomery and Dave Hakstol – and his job is certainly safe as a new hire, but he has not been the spark the Sabres were looking for in his second tour. They did finally manage to beat the Stars, though. 22. Utah Hockey Club (7-8-3, -13. Last week: 22) This group has certainly improved every season under Andre Tourigny, though this season has presented new challenges with various injuries to key players and a brand-new city and environment. But you do wonder when this core will really make that leap into a playoff contender. Ryan Smith doesn’t seem like a guy who makes rash decisions. 23. St. Louis Blues (8-11-1, -20. Last week: 23) After a promising start, the Blues are 3-7-1 since Oct. 24. Drew Bannister doesn’t have a lot to work with, and perhaps things will turn around with Robert Thomas back in the lineup. No reason for the Blues to make any drastic changes right now, but at some point down the road, they need to get serious about going for it or rebuilding. 24. Nashville Predators (6-10-3, -15. Last week: 25) Whenever a GM publicly proclaims unconditional support for his coach, it’s a bad sign. But Barry Trotz said he’d shake up the roster, which means Andrew Brunette is likely staying. The roster construction seems flawed, and perhaps Trotz now sees this, too. 25. Boston Bruins (8-9-3, -21. Last week: 20) Well, we know what happened. But it must be pointed out that the Bruins have defied expectations over the past few seasons, and now reality bites. Related: Three NHL Teams That Should Consider Hiring Jim Montgomery 26. Anaheim Ducks (8-8-2, -8. Last week: 30) Impressive! Greg Cronin has a reputation for being tough, but perhaps his message is getting through. The Ducks are playing hard and managed to grind out three straight wins. 27. San Jose Sharks (6-10-4, -21. Last week: 28) The Sharks beat the Wings in overtime and beat the Pens in a shootout, so it was tough to rank them in the proper order. But I do think the Sharks showed the best, outshooting the Wings 34-20 and nearly erasing a 3-0 deficit against the Pens. The Sharks are much improved from last season, and Ryan Warsofsky deserves some credit. 28. Detroit Red Wings (7-9-2, -14. Last week: 21) Full disclosure: In a pre-season poll among THN writers, I picked Derek Lalonde as the first coach to be fired. That obviously didn’t happen, but I don’t think Lalonde’s seat is any less hot. They’ve lost five of their past six and have not won in regulation in two weeks, and their playoff drought still looms. 29. Pittsburgh Penguins (7-10-4, -26. Last week: 27) Normally, I’d say yes, but it’s such an awkward situation since ownership gave Mike Sullivan that big extension, not Kyle Dubas. I also think it’s a bad look for Team USA if their head coach was fired by his NHL team right before the 4 Nations Face-Off. 30. Montreal Canadiens (7-10-2, -17. Last week: 32) They’ve won three of their past four, so at least they’ve stopped the bleeding. Considering Kent Hughes and Martin St-Louis both buy into the same long-term plan with the Habs exercising St-Louis’ two-year option this past April, we likely won’t see a change. But we’ve seen about-faces before, and there’s no denying that the fan base’s patience seems to be getting thin with St-Louis. Related: Are The Canadiens Actually Making Any Progress Under Martin St-Louis? 31. Columbus Blue Jackets (7-9-2, -4. Last week: 31) Never mind they’re 2-6-1 in November – they can be fun to watch, and Dean Evason’s done a good job of helping this team deal with adversity. The Jackets seem to respond best when they have a salt-of-the-earth bench boss who’s tough on his players, and Evason fits the bill. Related: Columbus Blue Jackets And Fans Rally Together Early In 2024-25 32. Chicago Blackhawks (6-12-1, -14. Last week: 29) Very hot. They have one regulation win in November and lost five of their past six, and looked particularly dejected following a loss to the Ducks on Tuesday. They’ve managed to score more than two goals just six (!) times this season, and Luke Richardson is having trouble coaxing out passable efforts out of his club.

Here’s hoping they get ghosted. No Soto. So the Dodgers can strengthen baseball’s best lineup, deepen their historic batting order, tighten their versatile defense, become even more exciting, more enchanting, more unbeatable. Thanks, but no thanks. No Soto. It’s not that Juan Soto would be a bad acquisition. He’s one of baseball’s best young players, he raked the Dodgers for a 1.084 on-base-plus-slugging percentage in the World Series, he was everything Aaron Judge was not, and heaven knows the Dodgers can afford him. But to sign the New York Yankees’ free-agent outfielder, they would need to make him the highest-paid annual-salaried player on the team, his no-deferred paycheck close to $50 million a year, and that just doesn’t work in a clubhouse that doesn’t need a new leader. This is Shohei Ohtani’s team, it’s Mookie Betts’ team, it’s Freddie Freeman’s team, and there’s no way you can send the message that it now also will be Juan Soto’s team. Soto never has been a clubhouse problem, but his flamboyant aura, while great for baseball, won’t so easily work in the Dodgers’ grind-it-out culture. Ohtani is known for his professionalism, Betts is known for his unselfishness, and Freeman is known for his guts. Soto? He’s known for his batter’s-box shuffle. Agreed, he’s a 26-year-old superstar who would be worth every penny. He just needs to get paid somewhere else, anywhere else, while the Dodgers should focus their attention on the gleaming product directly in front of them. Read more: Analysis: Dodgers to meet with Juan Soto, signaling more big spending is possible You know, the World Series champions. Keep them together. Strengthen that chemistry. Build on that bond. Andrew Friedman did such a spectacular job in shaping such a special team, it would verge on heartbreaking if he allows some of the Dodgers’ important free-agent pieces to go their separate ways. Remember when the Lakers’ Rob Pelinka tore apart the 2020 championship team by ridding it of important role players so he could add Russell Westbrook? Here’s hoping a similarly bad remodel job doesn’t happen here. Read more: Brusdar Graterol expected to miss half of 2025 season after shoulder surgery The Dodgers have shown they have the money, and the smarts, and everything else required to sign the cornerstones who can keep the championship foundation strong. Now they just need to fight the urge to turn everything upside down with a shiny new toy. They have six free agents. They should maximize their efforts to bring back four of them. Certainly, they will add another starting pitcher or two — Japanese phenom Roki Sasaki is one leading candidate — and they probably will add a bullpen arm and veteran journeyman outfielder. But they should focus their attention on those four free agents. Bring back Teoscar Hernández. He’s 32 and bound to regress from last year’s 33-homer, 99-RBI numbers, but goodness, outside of Ohtani, did any other Dodger make a more consistent impact? When the regular-season Dodgers needed a lift, he was there. When the postseason Dodgers needed a hero, he had big hits in the division series opener, the division series clincher, and the clinching World Series Game 5. He’s more than just a shower of sunflower seeds. He’s a big part of this club’s soul. Bring back Walker Buehler. Yes, he’s had two Tommy John surgeries and, yes, he made an awfully slow recovery from his most recent operation, going 1-6 with a 5.38 earned-run average in the regular season. But perhaps no Dodger is more unhittable in October. He has an 0.47 ERA in four career World Series appearances and the steely nerve to take the mound on one day’s rest for the last three outs of this fall’s clinching Game 5. The Dodgers value players who get stronger under the spotlight. Buehler has made a career out of being one of those players. Bring back Kiké Hernández. This one is simple. You endure a regular-season OPS of .654 for a postseason of two homers, eight RBIs and a go-ahead dinger against the San Diego Padres in the deciding Game 5 of the division series. Hernandez has a career .874 OPS in 86 postseason games. He is Señor October. You keep Señor October. Bring back Blake Treinen. He has struggled through injuries and he’ll be 37 next October but he had a 1.93 ERA in 50 appearances during the regular season and when the Dodgers needed him for 2⅓ innings in the World Series clincher, he shut the Yankees down. It was one of the biggest moments of the postseason, one of the most strenuous moments of his career, yet he performed like a champion. The Dodgers should be in the business of retaining champions. There’s at least one more member of the title team who has earned a new contract. He’s not a free agent but he’s on the verge of becoming a lame duck. There’s no doubt the Dodgers will take care of him before the final year of his contract, but it would be nice if it happened soon enough to have an impact with potential incoming free agents. He is Dave Roberts, and there are very few managers walking this earth who could have matched his deft handling of all the October bullpen games and injuries and intrigue. Tommy Edman and Freeman received special trophies, but Roberts was the Dodgers’ overall postseason most valuable player. It’s time to pay him like it.

While it feels like there are more elite quarterbacks and wide receivers than ever before, the amount of consistent, dependable running backs is dwindling. This makes it all the more important to find value at running back in fantasy football. In order to help you do that, I will be taking a look at a few backfields each week that stick out based on recent trends or new information we learned. Week 11 was one of the best slate of games I can remember, with plenty of exciting finishes across the league. Let’s take a deep dive into those games to identify some important backfield takeaways, including a few struggling veterans, an extremely confusing running back rotation and an upcoming return from injury. Isiah Pacheco was recently activated off Injured Reserve, and he is expected to make his return to action against the Panthers in Week 12. In the eight games that Pacheco missed, veteran Kareem Hunt largely served as the Chiefs' RB1, averaging 14.2 fantasy points per game. It is hard to say if Pacheco will immediately receive a full workload upon his return, but my guess is that the Chiefs ease him in a little bit. At 9-1, they are hardly in danger of missing the playoffs, so I doubt Andy Reid and Co. want to risk re-injuring Pacheco, especially given how effective Hunt has been in relief. This puts fantasy managers in a bit of a weird spot, as you probably still need to start Pacheco next week. I would do so and move Hunt to my bench, but I will be keeping my expectations a bit lower for Pacheco until we know for sure that he is fully back to his old self.

Akers has back-to-back games with double-digit carries, and has definitively supplanted Ty Chandler as the No. 2 in the backfield. Starter Aaron Jones has still led the Vikings in touches when healthy, but his production has been rather underwhelming. Since Week 8, Jones has run for just 3.5 yards per carry and has failed to get into the end zone, and it is possible that he is not playing at 100% health. Akers has not been any better on an efficiency basis but did manage to score a touchdown on Sunday. Moving forward, I’m a bit concerned that Jones will not be able to live up to the high standard he set earlier in the season. The Vikings offense as a whole has regressed a bit this month, and I don’t think that Jones can sustain elite production in a 60/40 split with Akers. I would continue to start Jones, but I am tapering my expectations for him and would treat him as a low-end RB2/high-end FLEX. I think Jones is a solid player to try and trade away based on his name value and gaudy volume numbers if your league's deadline hasn't passed. Akers, meanwhile, is worth adding on waivers this week as it looks like he is guaranteed 10-12 touches a week, but he does not have much standalone value. The glimmer of hope we had for Audric Estimé last week was quickly shut down, as the Broncos indeed appear to be using a pure hot-hand approach for their backfield. Estimé played just 13 snaps to Javonte Williams’ 32 on Sunday and scored just four fantasy points. Williams had a rather productive day on the other hand, turning 13 touches into 87 yards and a score. Jaleel McLaughlin appears to have been phased out of the offense a bit due to Estimé’s increased usage, with just 12 total snaps in the last two weeks. Assuming the Broncos continue to implement this unpredictable running back rotation, I would stay away from starting any of the players involved. You might miss out on a spike week from Williams or Estimé if it is their week as the starter, but I do not want to play that game of roulette. I would wait until we have more information on whether Estimé’s recent volume uptick is an outlier or if this truly is a hot-hand committee to see if Williams is startable. There was a stretch where it looked like Raheem Mostert and De’Von Achane would split carries similar to last year for the Dolphins, as from weeks 7 through 9, Mostert had 30 carries to Achane’s 37. Two weeks later, I feel confident in saying that Achane was just limited a little bit as he recovered from a concussion because he has rendered Mostert irrelevant in fantasy of late. Mostert has failed to net a positive rush yard in two games, while Achane has seen almost 20 touches a game. In fact, Mostert has operated as the Dolphins' No. 3 running back behind Jaylen Wright, who has 10 carries over this time period. I fully expect Achane to remain the clear No. 1 in the backfield as the Dolphins attempt to make a playoff push. Achane can be considered a legitimate top-five option at the running back position, as his combination of passing-game work and ceiling is incredibly valuable. Mostert and Wright obviously still have value as insurance options for Achane, but I would not consider starting them in any format. Nick Chubb has been fairly underwhelming in fantasy since making his return from injury about a month ago. He has scored just one touchdown and is running for only 3.1 yards a carry, failing to crack double-digit fantasy points in any game. Chubb also feels a bit game script dependent — on Sunday, when the Browns were down big to the Saints, Jerome Ford ended up playing 19 more snaps than Chubb. The Browns have quite a difficult schedule to finish the season, playing every other team in their division at least once as well as the Chiefs, Broncos and Dolphins. So, I would not be surprised if they continue to be in pass-first scripts, which plays heavily in Ford’s favor. I am more than comfortable benching Chubb in fantasy. He is clearly not his pre-injury self, and his lack of pass-catching work makes him somewhat touchdown-dependent. Given I have little trust in the Browns offense to consistently score touchdowns, Chubb is better off as a depth piece on your fantasy team. Ford is worth rostering as I could see him becoming a potential FLEX play in PPR leagues, but neither of them has a particularly high amount of upside."
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Heisman Watch: Indiana QB Kurtis Rourke will be in the mix with a win over Ohio State,https://sports.yahoo.com/heisman-watch-indiana-qb-kurtis-rourke-will-be-in-the-mix-with-a-win-over-ohio-state-135915178.html,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 13:59:15 GMT",Rourke will be a serious finalist candidate if the No. 5 Hoosiers beat the No. 2 Buckeyes.,"We’ll know just how real Kurtis Rourke’s chances of winning the Heisman are on Saturday. The Indiana QB is the co-No. 4 favorite for the award heading into the No. 5 Hoosiers’ gargantuan matchup at No. 2 Ohio State. Rourke is at +3000 entering Week 13 along with Alabama QB Jalen Milroe. The former MAC Offensive Player of the Year has been fantastic in his first season at Indiana. He transferred to the Hoosiers in the offseason as part of coach Curt Cignetti’s makeover of the program. Over nine games so far this season, Rourke is 171-of-238 passing for 2,410 yards and 21 TDs to just four interceptions. Rourke was one of the best quarterbacks in college football during the 2022 season before he suffered a season-ending ACL injury near the end of the regular season. Over 11 games at Ohio, Rourke threw for over 3,200 yards and 25 TDs while completing over 69% of his passes and throwing just four interceptions. He returned to the Bobcats for the 2023 season less than a year after surgery and it was clear that Rourke wasn’t 100%. His stats declined last season as he threw for just 2,207 yards and 11 TDs. With a sixth season of eligibility remaining thanks to the NCAA’s extra pandemic year, Rourke made the jump to power conference football ahead of 2024. And he’s been Indiana’s best quarterback since Michael Penix Jr. It’s no coincidence that the Hoosiers are having their first winning season since Penix’s final full 2020 season in Bloomington. The former Washington QB played in just five games due to injury in 2021 as four QBs saw significant playing time in a 2-10 season. Indiana then searched for solid QB play over the past two seasons to no avail and won just seven combined games. This season, the Hoosiers rank second in college football with 43.9 points per game. Rourke’s ability to throw the ball has opened up rushing lanes for Ty Son Lawton and Justice Ellison as the Hoosiers have averaged 6.9 yards per play. The Hoosiers are going to need to put up some big plays against the Ohio State defense to pull the upset on Saturday, and Rourke will need to be the catalyst. If he has a big game against the Buckeyes in a win as a double-digit underdog, his odds are going to get immensely shorter and his chances of a Heisman finalist will be very, very real. If Ohio State wins, and wins comfortably, Rourke’s fringe candidacy will be over. Here’s a look at the odds for the other favorites ahead of Week 13. Colorado DB/WR Travis Hunter (-400): Hunter’s odds aren’t as short as they were in the immediate wake of Week 12, but he’s still the significant favorite. The Buffaloes visit Kansas (at Arrowhead Stadium) in Week 13 as Hunter will get a chance to put on a show in an NFL stadium. Boise State RB Ashton Jeanty (+400): Jeanty should surpass 2,000 yards rushing this weekend against Wyoming. He has 256 carries for 1,893 yards and 26 TDs through 10 games. It’s not out of the question that he could hit the 30-TD threshold as well. Miami QB Cam Ward (+1500): The Hurricanes have a home game against Wake Forest on Saturday as Ward has his first chance to bounce back after Miami’s first loss of the season. Ward is averaging nearly 350 passing yards a game and has thrown for 32 TDs in just 10 games. Alabama QB Jalen Milroe (+3000): If you’re looking for a relative Heisman sleeper and don’t think Indiana is going to win on Saturday, your eggs should be in Milroe’s basket. Alabama has the tiebreaker edge in a 6-2 cluster at the top of the SEC. A strong finish to the regular season and a big performance in the SEC title game could put Milroe right there with Hunter and Jeanty. Oregon QB Dillon Gabriel (+4000): Is Gabriel out of the Heisman mix altogether after his pedestrian performance against Wisconsin? The Ducks are off in Week 13 and there’s a solid chance that Oregon will be the only undefeated team in the country entering the last week of the regular season. If that’s true, we’re intrigued to see where Gabriel’s odds are."

Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Ohio State loses second starting offensive lineman for season as C Seth McLaughlin suffers torn Achilles,https://sports.yahoo.com/ohio-state-loses-second-starting-offensive-lineman-for-season-as-c-seth-mclaughlin-suffers-torn-achilles-132414686.html,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 13:24:14 GMT",McLaughlin has been Ohio State's starter all season since transferring from Alabama.,"Ohio State is now down two offensive linemen for the rest of the 2024 season. According to multiple reports, star center Seth McLaughlin suffered a torn Achilles during practice on Tuesday. McLaughlin has been one of the best centers in the country this season. McLaughlin’s injury comes as Ohio State had shuffled its offensive line around following a knee injury to left tackle Josh Simmons earlier this season at Oregon. Guard Donovan Jackson, who had an early season injury of his own, has played left tackle in Simmons’ absence. A fifth-year senior, McLaughlin transferred to Ohio State over the offseason. He came from Alabama, where he was the team’s starting center during Nick Saban’s final season. McLaughlin made 24 starts at Alabama and appeared in 35 games in four seasons before arriving in Columbus. His injury means No. 2 Ohio State will be doing more moving around on its offensive line ahead of Saturday’s big game against No. 5 Indiana. According to Rivals’ Dotting the Eyes, Carson Hinzman “seems like the best option” to take McLaughlin’s spot at center. Hinzman has been starting at guard with Jackson at tackle. He was the team’s starting center as a redshirt freshman in 2023. From Dotting the Eyes: If Hinzman moves to the center, second-year guard Austin Siereveld could slot in as left guard. Siereveld started the first two games at left guard in place of the injured Jackson and then subsequently rotated in some at right guard with Tegra Tshabola. In the last few weeks, Siereveld has been used as a reserve late in games, but he at least has starting experience at left guard. Another option would be to keep Hinzman at left guard and start redshirt freshman Josh Padilla at center. Padilla didn't play at all last year and has logged 29 snaps this year, including three last week against Northwestern. Ohio State’s offense is averaging 5.3 yards per carry this season and over seven yards a play. The Buckeyes have been powered by a run game that features both TreVeyon Henderson and Quinshon Judkins. The Ole Miss transfer is the team’s leading rusher with 121 carries for 723 yards, and Henderson has 89 carries for 662 yards. No other player on the team has 200 yards."

The Broncos moved up to No. 12 and the Cougars fell eight spots to No. 14 after losing to Kansas on Saturday night. Since Boise State is in front of BYU, the Broncos are the provisional No. 4 seed in the playoff with two weeks to go in the regular season. Remember, the top four conference champions receive first-round byes into the playoff while seeds Nos. 5 through 12 play in first-round games. Five conference champions are guaranteed spots into the playoff. BYU is the highest-ranked Big 12 team in the latest top 25 and five spots ahead of Army, the top AAC team in the rankings. BYU has a very good opportunity to vault back over the Broncos in Week 13. The Cougars visit No. 18 Arizona State in one of two massive Big 12 games in the penultimate weekend. If BYU wins convincingly, it's very easy to see the committee moving them ahead of Boise State. After all, the committee moved BYU up three spots a week ago after a field goal with three seconds left gave the Cougars a 22-21 win at Utah. Outside of the swap between BYU and Boise State, the only significant move in the top 12 came at Tennessee's expense. Georgia moved back into the projected bracket after a 31-17 win over the Vols in Week 12. Tennessee is at No. 11 in the rankings and the first team currently out of the College Football Playoff. There will be two more sets of rankings revealed before the official and final rankings on Sunday, Dec. 8. 1. Oregon 2. Texas 3. Miami 4. Boise State As Boise State moves ahead of BYU in the rankings, Miami moved up from the No. 4 seed to the No. 3 seed. The Hurricanes were passed by an 8-2 Alabama team in the top 25, however. No. 12 BYU at No. 5 Ohio State No. 11 Georgia at No. 6 Penn State No. 10 Ole Miss at No. 7 Indiana No. 9 Alabama at No. 8 Notre Dame Once again, the Big Ten is slated to host three first-round games. Right now, anyway. That will likely change next week after Indiana's visit to Ohio State on Saturday. Oregon has clinched a spot in the Big Ten championship game and the winner of Saturday's top-five matchup will have a significant edge in the race to join the Ducks in Indianapolis. Alabama leads the SEC contingent of at-large teams as it has a win over Georgia. Ole Miss, which beat Georgia in Week 11, is a spot ahead of the Bulldogs. Tennessee is outside the field despite having a win over Alabama. If there's a six-team tie atop the SEC at 6-2, the committee's rankings behind the team that wins the SEC title game will be fascinating. 1. Oregon (11-0) 2. Ohio State (9-1) 3. Texas (9-1) 4. Penn State (9-1) 5. Indiana (10-0) 6. Notre Dame (9-1) 7. Alabama (8-2) 8. Miami (9-1) 9. Ole Miss (8-2) 10. Georgia (8-2) 11. Tennessee (8-2) 12. Boise State (9-1) 13. SMU (9-1) 14. BYU (9-1) 15.

The 26-year-old superstar certainly has put himself in a tremendous spot following his monster contract year in which he posted a career-high 41 homers, 109 RBI, and a .989 OPS while leading the Yanks to the World Series. Soto’s free agency sweepstakes is already well underway as he and agent Scott Boras have held meetings with the Mets, Yankees, Red Sox, Blue Jays, over the past couple of days, and has a meeting set up with the Dodgers. The Giants, Phillies, and Rays could also potentially end up having meetings with Soto, according to Mark Feinsand of MLB.com.

And that one loss knocked them back into a three-way race for the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs. The Buffalo Bills and Pittsburgh Steelers each have just two losses, one behind Kansas City, and Buffalo has clinched the head-to-head tiebreaker. Buffalo and Pittsburgh also have arguably easier paths than Kansas City the rest of the way. Kansas City has four games remaining against teams that are .500 or better (Steelers, Chargers, Texans, Broncos). The Bills have three (Lions, 49ers, Rams) as do the Steelers (Chiefs, Eagles, Ravens). According to Tankathon, the Bills have the weakest remaining schedule among the three with their opponents holding a .444 win percentage after Sunday's games. The Steelers have the toughest at .493 and the Chiefs are in the middle at .477. A Christmas Day game, when the Chiefs play at the Steelers, might be a big factor in determining the AFC's bye and home-field advantage through the playoffs. The Chiefs are still the favorite to get the No. 1 seed, and they proved last season they can win a Super Bowl without the bye, but it's more wide open after the Bills held on to beat them Sunday.

The win snapped Purdue's 39-game regular-season non-conference win streak, too, which was the fourth-longest of all time entering Tuesdays' game. Jones made Marquette history in the win, too. He led the Golden Eagles with a triple-double, which was just the third in program history. The last player to hit that milestone was former Miami Heat star Dwyane Wade in 2003. Jones finished with 17 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists while shooting 7-of-12 from the field on Tuesday night. Kam Jones barely has his voice left after playing BIG tonight against the Boilermakers 🙌 pic.twitter.com/1TC6tJsDF7 — FOX College Hoops (@CBBonFOX) November 20, 2024 ""We came out ready to play. We was prepared ... We executed our game plan. My voice is gone, out there talking too much,"" Jones said on FS1 after the win. ""I appreciate this team, I appreciate them letting me be their leader. Our team was huge tonight."" Marquette led nearly the entire way on Tuesday, and it took a seven-point lead into the break at halftime. The Golden Eagles held Purdue without a field goal for more than eight minutes midway through the second half, and ripped off a quick 8-0 run to push to a 14-point lead just ahead of the under-four timeout. That was their largest lead of the night, and allowed them to cruise the rest of the way to the 18-point victory. Stevie Mitchell added 21 points for Marquette to go with Jones' triple-double. Chase Ross finished with 12 points, and Ben Gold added 11 points and five rebounds. They missed just one free throw as a team the entire way. Jones averaged 17.2 points and 2.4 assists per game last season, his third with the Golden Eagles. He put up 32 points in their season opener earlier this month, and he dropped 28 points in their win over Maryland on Friday. TRIPLE-DOUBLE 🔥Kam Jones gets the third triple-double in @MarquetteMBB history, and the first one since Dwayne Wade in 2003 🙌 pic.twitter.com/KUzzezM3pp — FOX College Hoops (@CBBonFOX) November 20, 2024 Trey Kaufman-Renn led Purdue with 16 points and eight rebounds in the loss. Fletcher Loyer added 13 points, and Braden Smith finished with 11 points. They were the only three Purdue players to hit double figures, and the Boilermakers went just 6-of-18 from behind the arc as a team. Purdue entered Tuesday’s game fresh off a big 87-78 upset win over then-No. 2 Alabama last week. The Boilermakers ended that game on a long 28-13 run, thanks in part to 26 points from Kaufman-Renn. Purdue committed just three total turnovers in that win, which moved it up to No. 6 in this week’s poll. Marquette is now 5-0 on the year, and entered the game with an undefeated record after sneaking past the Terps last week. They’ll take on Georgia on Saturday in the Bahamas, and will get both No. 5 Iowa State and No. 19 Wisconsin before Big East play kicks off. While both UConn and Creighton get the bulk of the attention in the conference, Marquette is the first of that group to secure a big non-conference win this fall. With Jones leading the way, Marquette already looks more than capable of knocking off the reigning national champions and picking up a Big East title in a few months."

The primary area of weakness on offense is the Ohio State O-line’s ability to handle extra rushers, as they rank 91st with a 10.7% blitz down sack rate and 78th with a 7.2% big play rate on blitz downs. Defensively OSU is superb, ranking 1st nationally according to SP+. The Buckeyes are facing the third-fewest number of deep passes in the country, with just 8.2% of passes defended occurring 20+ yards downfield. They are allowing a somewhat elevated 61.8% completion rate, which ranks 78th nationally. Ohio State emerged 2-1 from a challenging three game mid-season slate against @Oregon (32-31 L), Nebraska (21-17 W) and @Penn State (20-13), in addition to dominating Northwestern on Saturday. They close the season with two extremely consequential home games against Indiana (9–0) and Michigan (5-4). Indiana has taken the nation by storm in HC Curt Cignetti’s first season at the HC of IU program, sitting at a perfect 7-0 heading into their titanic Week 10 showdown against The Buckeyes. The Hoosiers rattled off four straight easy wins to start the year before toppling Maryland 42-28. They went on another four-game Big Ten win streak before grinding out a taxing 20-to-15 win over Michigan where Indiana carried a 97% win expectancy despite the close score. Indiana’s offense has been one of the most potent units in the country, ranking second in success rate (55.5%) and 4th in EPA/Play. While Indiana’s 40.2 PPG offense gets a lot of attention, their 15th ranked SP+ defense also ranks 4th in EPA/play and 6th in suppressing explosive plays.

He’s completing a scintillating 72.7% of his throws and is working with future first-round picks in WR Emeka Egbuka and Jeremiah Smith. The Buckeyes’ ruthlessly efficient pass attack ranks 2nd in success rate and 5th in EPA/dropback despite throwing just 10.3% of passes 20+ yards downfield (118th). Howard’s 84.5 PFF passing grade is the best mark of his five-year career, with the previous best being 72.7%. Indiana: QB Nathan Rourke spent his first four collegiate seasons at Ohio before transferring in this offseason, which has proved to be a prescient decision with Rourke leading the Hoosiers to a perfect 10-0 record. He’s completing 71.5% of his passes (#5 in FBS) with a sensational 21-4 TD/INT ratio and a 91.4 PFF passing grade that is tied with Jaxson Dart for the top spot in the country. He’s stretching the field too, ranking 10th among Power Four programs with a 10.1-yard ADOT, so his elite completion rate isn’t a product of checkdowns or manufactured short touches. Ohio State’s opponents are holding the ball for an average of 30.3 seconds per play, which is the longest plays per second faced of any defense in the FBS. The OSU D ranks 1st nationally in points per scoring opportunity (2.26) and Red Zone touchdown rate (30%) Quinshon Judkins (OSU) has averaged 6.2 yards from scrimmage per touch this season-- 3rd-best among Big Ten Running Backs; TreVeyon Henderson is running for 10+ yards on 27% of his carries (21/78), the highest mark in FBS. Indiana isn’t just winning games outright, as they’ve gone 8-2 against the spread which is comfortably the largest cover margin in FBS. The Hoosiers’ prolific offense is also responsible for their 7-3 record to the Over. Indiana receivers have gained 2,365 yards on 152 receptions (15.6 YPR) this season, which is tied for 11th-best among FBS pass catchers. Ohio State's defense has allowed just 9.9 Yards Per Reception this season, which ranks 3rd-best among Power Four defenses.

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Brewers' Pat Murphy wins NL Manager of the Year after replacing Craig Counsell,https://sports.yahoo.com/brewers-pat-murphy-wins-nl-manager-of-the-year-after-replacing-craig-counsell-235238508.html,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024 23:52:38 GMT",Everyone expected Murphy's Brewers to take a step back this season. They won one more game instead.,"Pat Murphy took over as Milwaukee Brewers manager last offseason after Craig Counsell jumped ship for a division rival. One year and one division title later, Murphy won NL Manager of the Year. Murphy was named the winner on Tuesday, beating finalists Mike Shildt of the San Diego Padres and fellow rookie manager Carlos Mendoza of the New York Mets. Murphy received 27 of 30 first-place votes from the BBWAA, with Shildt, Mendoza and the Philadelphia Phillies' Rob Thomson each receiving one. Here’s the full NL Manager of the Year vote: pic.twitter.com/IMnbYpL2sm — Mark Feinsand (@Feinsand) November 19, 2024 Murphy is the first Brewers manager to win the award, which dates back to 1983. Both Shildt and Mendoza led their teams to the playoffs after massive disappointments last season, but Murphy won the award by doing something different. His team won one more game than last year's group, despite widespread expectations of a step back for a franchise that has consistently punched above its weight. Rewind to last offseason, and the Brewers were in an uncomfortable spot. Losing Counsell hurt. One of the most respected managers in MLB not only left after eight-plus years for a record-setting, five-year, $40 million deal, but he also joined the team that many expected to knock the Brewers off their perch in the NL Central. Also gone were team architect David Stearns, who took more money from the Mets, and Cy Young winner Corbin Burnes, whom the team opted to trade for younger talent before he left in free agency. Rotation stalwart Brandon Woodruff was also out for the season due to a shoulder injury. Other players left, too, and their replacements weren't exactly needle-moving. Vegas didn't like the Brewers' odds to recover, with BetMGM giving them worse divisional odds than the Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds. To replace Counsell, the Brewers hired the man who coached him in college at Notre Dame and served as his bench coach for eight years. Men about to turn 65 years old are rarely the first pick for managerial positions, but Murphy's experience with the organization was invaluable after the loss of so much leadership. To win the NL Central again and reach the playoffs for the sixth time in seven years, Murphy did much of what previously worked for the Brewers. The team's pitching staff was fluid, tying a franchise record with 17 different starting pitchers, plus 12 relievers notching at least one save, while the offense posted its most productive season (777 runs) since 2009. The Brewers ended up going 93-69 and winning the division, though they were stopped by Mendoza's Mets in the wild-card round (that didn't figure into the BBWAA voting, which is done at the end of the regular season). Perhaps the most important part of the job for Murphy was the handling of Jackson Chourio. The super-prospect made his MLB debut at age 19 and struggled to start the season, hitting .210/.254/.327 through the end of May. The Brewers could have sent him back to the minors or reworked his role in the offense, but they instead bet on his talent and stayed the course. Their reward was a guy who hit .303/.358/.525 for the rest of the season and will be anchoring Milwaukee's lineup for years to come, with Murphy filling out his spot on the lineup card."

It worked out for the Guardians.,"Stephen Vogt hung around as long as he could as an MLB player. Then he became the AL Manager of the Year in his first year in the job. The Cleveland Guardians skipper was named the winner of the award on Tuesday, beating finalists Matt Quatraro of the Kansas City Royals and AJ Hinch of the Detroit Tigers in an all-AL Central affair. Just like in the division standings this year, the Guardians came out on top. Vogt received 27 of 30 first-place votes from the BBWAA, with Quatraro taking two and Hinch getting the last one. Joe Espada (Houston Astros), Aaron Boone (New York Yankees), Mark Kotsay (Oakland Athletics), Rocco Baldelli (Minnesota Twins) and Alex Cora (Boston Red Sox) all received second- or third-place votes. Cleveland’s Stephen Vogt wins AL Manager of the Year, receiving 27 of the 30 first-place votes. Here’s the full vote: pic.twitter.com/6V8asi5Ye2 — Mark Feinsand (@Feinsand) November 19, 2024 The win comes 26 months after Vogt announced his retirement as a player after 10 years in the big leagues. He started his coaching career as a bullpen and quality control coach for the Seattle Mariners in 2023, then made the jump to manager in Cleveland after one season. Per MLB.com's Sarah Langs, it's the quickest a person has ever gone from player to Manager of the Year. Joe Girardi was the previous record-holder, having gone from player in 2003 to winning the award in 2006 with the Miami Marlins. In hiring Vogt, the Guardians were certainly taking a risk on a first-time manager with limited coaching experience, but they needed to aim high after the ""retirement"" of longtime manager Terry Francona. (Francona has since emerged from retirement to become manager of the Cincinnati Reds.) In retrospect, the Guardians needed a change after a 76-86 season, and they got one with Vogt. Cleveland made a 16-win jump in 2024, winning a competitive division and reaching the ALCS. Their lineup, led by José Ramírez and Steven Kwan, was one of the more underrated in baseball. Their rotation was a clear weak link, but it was backed up by the best bullpen in the league, featuring four guys with an ERA below 2.00 across at least 65 innings thrown: Emmanuel Clase, Cade Smith, Hunter Gaddis and Tim Herrin. The roster was eventually overwhelmed by the New York Yankees in the ALCS (which didn't factor in the BBWAA voting), but 2024 represented a significant step forward for Cleveland. The Royals and Tigers made the playoffs after not being expected to come close to .500, but Vogt arguably had an even harder job than his counterparts, as he took over a team trying to return to the playoffs after the loss of a Hall of Fame manager and few notable additions. Vogt pulled it off, and he should have plenty of seasons to come to add to his list of accomplishments."

Will that answer change if there's an offseason opening in Dallas?,"With the Dallas Cowboys floundering amid Deion Sanders' success at Colorado, Sanders was asked on Tuesday about chatter that he might leave the Buffalos for another job. Sanders initially dismissed the question at his news conference, citing Colorado athletic director Rick George's presence in the room. He eventually gathered his thoughts and provided an answer. Coach Prime on his name being brought up for other coaching jobs:“I’m happy where I am, I’m good. I got a kickstand down… I’m happy, I’m excited, I’m enthusiastic about where I am. I love it here. pic.twitter.com/46fxg7he8m — DNVR Buffs (@DNVR_Buffs) November 19, 2024 ""I'm happy where I am,"" Sanders said. ""I'm good. I've got a kickstand down. You know what a kickstand is? A lot of people in here not of age, don't now what a kickstand is. ""That means I'm resting. I'm good. I'm happy. I'm excited. I'm enthusiastic about where I am. I love it here, I truly do."" So Sanders isn't interested in the Cowboys or anywhere else. Or so he says with two games remaining in a regular season that could end with a berth in the College Football Playoff. Why would Sanders kill those vibes by acknowledging that he's considering employment elsewhere? If, indeed, he actually is. Sanders wasn't asked directly about the Cowboys on Tuesday. But a day after the Cowboys' blowout loss to the Texans to drop them to 0-5 at home, the implication was clear. Mike McCarthy's job as Cowboys head coach is in serious jeopardy, so much that Jones addressed Monday night why he traditionally doesn't making coaching changes during the season. Jones didn't provide a direct answer about McCarthy's job security, but a coaching change in Dallas in the offseason wouldn't surprise anybody who's been paying attention. Sanders' name has come up repeatedly amid the speculation about McCarthy's job status. Sanders made four Pro Bowls, four All-Pro teams and won a Super Bowl in five seasons as a cornerback for the Cowboys. Since retiring as a Hall of Famer player, Sanders has produced success in two stops as a head coach. He was a two-time SWAC Coach of the Year in three seasons as head coach at Jackson State. After a hot start in his first season at Colorado fizzled to a 4-8 finish, he now has the Buffalos ranked 16th in the country and in contention to win the Big 12. Sanders has never been one to sit still as a player or a coach, and the Cowboys speculation is natural considering his established relationship with the team and the franchise's penchant for the spotlight. Sanders joining the Cowboys would be a seismic story. Sanders' former Cowboys teammate turned NFL commentator Michael Irvin is cheerleading the idea of Sanders taking over in Dallas. And he asked Sanders directly last week about the Cowboys during an interview on FS1. Like on Tuesday and any other time he's been asked about leaving Colorado, Sanders said that he wasn't interested. This time he picked up his laptop from his office at Colorado's Folsom Field to show Irvin the Rocky Mountain view from his desk as if to say: Why would I leave this? .@michaelirvin88 asked @DeionSanders about coaching the Cowboys... Watch until the end to see Prime's response 😂 pic.twitter.com/wonYbtDR4H — Speak (@SpeakOnFS1) November 13, 2024 ""I got to show you right here,"" Sanders said while pointing his camera out his office window. ""I love it where I am. I love it where I am. I love it."" So Sanders genuinely appears happy in Colorado, where he's beloved by fans and has a good thing going. He's not going to provide any other answer but no when asked during the season if he's thinking about leaving. But the question will certainly be worth revisiting if and when McCarthy is dismissed."

Undefeated Oregon received top billing once again, delivered by the committee a few hours after Big Ten number crunchers ran through tiebreaker scenarios and realized the Ducks had clinched a spot in the conference title game no matter what happens between now and December. Ohio State stayed at No. 2, one spot ahead of Southeastern Conference co-leader Texas. Miami of the Atlantic Coast Conference was ranked eighth but gets the third seed and a bye that goes to the top four ranked conference leaders. And likewise, Boise State was ranked 12th by the committee but was slotted into that fourth and final bye. BYU was ranked 14th, but gets the last spot in the 12-team bracket as the fifth-best conference leader. That bumps out No. 11 Tennessee, which lost to Georgia last week and now takes the place the SEC’s Bulldogs held last week: first team out. There are three more weeks of rankings to go, culminating with the reveal on Dec. 8 that sets the bracket for college football’s first 12-team playoff. Boise State’s rise into the bye wasn’t all that unexpected after BYU suffered its first loss of the season and tumbled eight spots in the rankings. Still, it’s a bit of a comedown for Big 12 backers, who would point out that every team in their league has a stronger strength of schedule than the Broncos of the Mountain West. Of course, nobody cries foul louder than the SEC, which was generally appalled at seeing Georgia left out last week after its lopsided loss to Mississippi. Now, the Bulldogs are back at No. 10. Alabama is No. 7 and Ole Miss is No. 9. All three teams, along with Tennessee, have two losses. but nobody can argue with that conference’s strength of schedule. Other rankings: No. 4 Penn State, No. 5 Indiana and No. 6 Notre Dame."

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",NBA has been ‘poking around’ on Knicks’ promotion of assistant coach Rick Brunson,https://sports.yahoo.com/nba-poking-around-knicks-promotion-044117894.html,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024 04:41:17 GMT","According to SNY’s Ian Begley, the NBA has been poking around on the Knicks’ promotion of assistant coach Rick Brunson.","The NBA has contacted the Knicks recently about the promotion of assistant coach Rick Brunson and whether it violates league salary cap rules, SNY has learned. The Knicks on Monday night called the NBA’s questioning of the matter ""harassment"" and ""offensive."" ‘‘In response to the rumored NBA investigation into Rick Brunson’s promotion, Brunson took (former associate head coach) Johnnie Bryant’s place and assumed the same salary as Bryant. It’s offensive that anyone would claim Rick didn’t deserve the promotion,” MSG Sports said in a statement. “Rick has done a tremendous job and will continue to do so. We see this as more harassment of the Knicks due to our opposition to certain NBA matters.” Rick Brunson was promoted in the 2024 offseason; his son, Jalen Brunson, signed a contract extension in the same offseason that was seen as team-friendly because Jalen could have made more money as a free agent in 2025. The insinuation is that Rick Brunson’s salary is compensation for the salary that Jalen Brunson passed on by signing a four-year, $156 million extension last summer. In the 2025 offseason, the star point guard would've been eligible to sign a $270 million max-contract in free agency. It’s worth noting that Rick Brunson’s new contract, per NBA coaching sources, is within industry standards for top assistant coaches. Brunson played nine season in the NBA. His coaching career includes stops in Charlotte, the University of Virginia, the University of Hartford and three stints with Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau. He was promoted in the 2024 offseason after then-associate head coach Johnnie Bryant left to join the Cavs as an associate head coach. The Knicks originally hired Brunson in the 2022 offseason, the same offseason they signed Jalen. The NBA investigated the Knicks for potential rule-breaking after they signed Brunson. In Dec. 2022, the NBA said its investigation concluded that the Knicks violated ""league rules governing the timing of this season's free agency discussions,"" and they stripped the organization of their 2025 second-round pick for the infraction. More recently, Knicks governor James Dolan has criticized the league and NBA commissioner Adam Silver on several issues, as MSG Sports notes in the statement. Dolan took issue with the NBA’s transparency in a letter sent to the league’s Board of Governors in September, according to ESPN. Dolan also criticized the league’s revenue sharing policy in a separate letter, the network reported."

The Detroit Red Wings' even strength scoring is broken, and head coach Derek Lalonde mixed up the lines to fix that. First, one line remains untouched from Lalonde. The trio of Michael Rasmussen, Andrew Copp, and Christian Fischer is intact. That line had the second most five-on-five minutes of all the lines last game. They were together on the ice for 10 minutes of the overtime loss to the San Jose Sharks. The rest of the forward lines saw some shuffling. Dylan Larkin and Lucas Raymond are kept together, with Vladimir Tarasenko joining them on the top line. Marco Kasper, Patrick Kane, and Alex DeBrincat create the team's second line. Finally, Joe Veleno is out, with Tyler Motte coming into the lineup. Motte was on a line with J.T. Compher and Jonatan Berggren. The Veleno, Compher, and Berggren trio were badly out-matched against the Sharks despite playing most of any line (11:01 at even strength). Red Wings lines this morning:Tarasenko-Larkin-RaymondDeBrincat-Kasper-KaneRasmussen-Copp-FischerMotte-Compher-Berggren(Looks to me as though Veleno is the extra)Edvinsson-SeiderChiarot-PetryJohansson/Gustafsson/HollTalbotLyon pic.twitter.com/bjiqKJPawZ — Sam Stockton (@_samstockton) November 20, 2024 These new lines could be a breath of fresh air for the forwards. The trio of Kane, Kasper, and DeBrincat is certainly one to watch closely. Kasper can get to the dirty areas for puck retrievals; Kane is a supremely underrated playmaker and a skillful goal scorer, while DeBrincat can shoot the puck better than most. Unfortunately, Red Wings fans must wait another day to see if these lines stick. And if they do, they will see how they gel together.

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games","2025 NFL Mock Draft 1.0: Travis Hunter at top, QBs Cam Ward, Shedeur Sanders go in top five",https://sports.yahoo.com/2025-nfl-mock-draft-1-183429320.html,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 18:34:29 GMT",Travis Hunter and two quarterbacks in the top five highlight Connor Rogers' 2025 NFL Mock Draft 1.0.,"Right around Thanksgiving every year 10 NFL fan bases (or so) turn their attention to the almighty draft order sweepstakes. This one specifically could come right down to the wire, with the first five teams having two wins and the next nine having three or four wins. That lack of separation matters in a draft that lacks the quarterback depth we were spoiled with last year, and potentially less blue chip talent overall. With that being said, there is still star power and building blocks in this class. Let’s take an early dive into the order, team needs and an ideal prospect fit for each in my 2025 NFL Mock Draft 1.0. NOTE: Draft order per tankathon.com, which takes into account remaining strength of schedule and tiebreakers What we know: Hunter is a high-end talent on both sides of the ball. What’s to be determined: if he’ll play more wide receiver or cornerback at the next level. The best scenario for Jacksonville in my opinion is Hunter plays cornerback full time, with a few offensive packages involving him at wide receiver. His ability to create takeaways will make him a very dangerous player in coverage at the NFL level. How Will Levis plays the rest of the season (and he’s shown improvement over the last few games) will determine what the Titans do in this spot. For now, I think they will beef up their pass rush next to their stout interior duo of Jeffery Simmons and T’Vondre Sweat. At 6-foot-3, 259 pounds, Carter is an excellent athlete who has made a successful transition from off-ball linebacker. He can rush off the edge or even standing up over interior offensive linemen. Head coach Brian Callahan and offensive line coach Bill Callahan could add another first-round offensive lineman here (specifically a right tackle), but Carter’s talent and ceiling gave him an edge.    02:32   What makes Carter such an ‘explosive’ defender Connor Rogers breaks down Abdul Carter’s ability to wreck an offensive game plan, explaining why the Penn State defensive end is one of the Big Ten’s most dominant defensive forces. There is no point in investing anymore games into the Deshaun Watson era in Cleveland. Kevin Stefanski is the right coach to develop the next quarterback and could potentially dial down some of Ward’s reckless plays. His upside is too promising to pass up in this scenario, bringing excitement under center in Cleveland again. I also love how battle tested he is, having success at three different college programs (Incarnate Word, Washington State, and Miami). The Raiders were on the outside looking in during last year’s run of six quarterbacks in the first 12 picks. They won’t let that happen again, going with the accurate pocket passer in Sanders here. You are going to see this connection a lot from now leading up to the NFL draft. The Giants might be the most fascinating team in the draft. The Daniel Jones era is officially over and we know general manager Joe Schoen wanted to move up for a quarterback last year. Yet, what if the supply doesn’t meet the demand this year? Do they explore a bridge option (such as Sam Darnold) and take a premium player at a different position? They get one here in Will Johnson, an athletic corner with instincts and ball skills. Each week Drake Maye shows why he was the third overall pick in the draft. Now, New England needs to put the proper supporting cast around him both at pass catcher and on the offensive line. McMillan is the type of physical receiver you can funnel your pass game through, essentially their version of Nico Collins in this scenario. The Jets will officially have a new general manager this offseason. They also have a pending, gigantic Aaron Rodgers decision that will play into who they hire and eventually draft. It’s safe to say he most likely won’t be back, but a new regime won’t necessarily force a pick at quarterback in year one. They’d have to really love someone in the tier outside of Ward and Sanders in this spot. For now, putting a blue chip defensive lineman in Graham next to Quinnen Williams is a no-brainer strategy. Their front has been uncompetitive against the run all season. Walker plays off-ball linebacker for Georgia, but if you watch his pass rush snaps over the last two years it’s easy to project his transition as an edge rusher. Getting Derrick Brown back next season will help the Panthers defensive line (he suffered a season-ending knee injury in Week 1), but the rest of this front needs an infusion of talent. There are a lot of different directions Dallas can go with this pick and I’m sure superstar running back Ashton Jeanty from Boise State will be a popular selection. However, I like the depth of this running back class and think they can wait, instead capitalizing on bolstering the trenches. Banks plays left tackle for Texas, but in this scenario they can move Tyler Guyton to right tackle (his college position). Defensive line and wide receiver will also be in consideration here if the board breaks right. Colorado’s Travis Hunter takes control of the Heisman Trophy race with three weeks to go Hunter is the favorite to take home college football’s most prestigious award. Here’s why.   Nicole Auerbach ,   Nicole Auerbach , There is plenty of debate whether Campbell is a guard or tackle at the next level, but regardless his position, the film shows a consistent presence on the offensive line with the required play strength to be a difference maker. Last year’s first-round pick, Taliese Fuaga, and Campbell could give the Saints a run-blocking matchup advantage on one side of the line. Williams is a force against the run, consistently handling multiple blockers, and holding the point of attack. In the AFC North, that kind of presence is a necessity for defensive linemen. The Dolphins already have a great safety in Jevon Holland, but pairing Starks with him (Jordan Poyer is currently on a one-year deal) gives them a do-it-all, versatile duo. They could use an upgrade at guard, but I think they can find that on Day 2 rather than using a top 15 pick. The current sack leaders for Tampa Bay are nose tackle Vita Vea (5) and defensive tackle Calijah Kancey (4). They are getting no production from their edge pass rushers. While Pearce is not a true three-down player just yet, his unique movements and burst off the edge creates havoc on passing downs. A front of him, Vea, Kancey and Yaya Diaby would be able to help get the Bucs' defense off the field. Ersery is a massive (6-6, 330 pounds) left tackle for Minnesota, but in this scenario he might start out at guard for the Bears. They simply need to add more talent to their offensive line in front of Caleb Williams, especially on the interior in the short term. With Anthony Richardson under center and Jonathan Taylor in the backfield, the Colts can be a smashmouth offense when things are clicking. By taking Warren, who is 6-6 and near 260 pounds, they lean even further into that. Plus, he gives Richardson a gigantic target who has already caught 23 first downs in the middle of the field. Shane Steichen would line Warren up all over the field, including the slot, inline, backfield, and more.    02:43   Why PSU’s Warren is a ‘promising NFL prospect’ Connor Rogers goes to the film room to evaluate Penn State’s Tyler Warren and breaks down why the versatile tight end is such a promising NFL prospect. In his first year as a starter for Texas, Williams has held down right tackle and had flashes of pure dominance. There were moments against Georgia where he looked off balance, but that’s expected for a young player in a tough matchup. At 335 pounds with great play strength, he could slot in at guard early on for the Seahawks. Matthew Stafford is still playing at a high level, but he’ll turn 37 this offseason. Why not go the Packers' route and get ahead on the future under center? Milroe has tremendous speed and playmaking ability, but his game needs refinement. He’d have the proper time (and coaching) with the Rams. If they opt to supplement the rest of the roster for another ""all in"" run with Stafford, a cornerback such as East Carolina's Shavon Revel would be in play here instead. Scourton is a stout, heavy-handed defensive lineman who can play inside or outside for the 49ers. He’d give their run defense an instant jolt, but his pass rush ceiling is still very high. Plus, he will still be 20 years old on draft night. Bo Nix looks more and more comfortable in Sean Payton’s offense as the season goes on. Now, the Broncos need to get him more weapons like Burden to take another step. While it hasn’t been the season everyone expected for Burden (574 receiving yards through 10 games) after posting over 1,200 receiving yards as a sophomore in 2023, he’s still an explosive playmaking threat who plays bigger than his 5-11 stature. Burden would feast off of screens and short-area throws with his catch-and-run ability in Denver. If I could buy stock in one prospect right now, it might be Green. The talented pass rusher from Marshall already has 15 sacks this season, boasting a skill set that is sorely needed for the Falcons right now. However, what might impress scouts as much as the sack totals is his mentality taking on blocks in the run game, despite being listed at 248 pounds. Another defensive line prospect that will still be 20 years old on draft night, Williams doesn’t have box score production but has the required traits to go in the first round. The tape shows a much more polished run defender than pass rusher while boasting an ideal 6-5, 265-pound build. The combination of him and 2024 first-round pick Darius Robinson would give the Cardinals a lot of power up front. Milum is an incredibly skilled zone run game blocker who doesn’t surrender much in pass protection. This is an offense that will have a very diverse run game for a long time with Jayden Daniels under center and they’ll need the athletes on the offensive line to match. Milum is yet another candidate to start his NFL career at guard if that’s where they have their most glaring hole next year. Grant is nearly 340 pounds but moves like he’s under 300. The Texans could use more beef in between Will Anderson and Danielle Hunter, but Grant also could develop over time with his athleticism to play some passing downs in head coach DeMeco Ryans' scheme. The Ravens' pass defense has had a rough year, but they have talent in their secondary (and just used a first-round pick on cornerback Nate Wiggins). They need more from their pass rush and the 6-6, 290-pound mismatch player in Stewart can wreck plays from multiple alignments. Jim Harbaugh reunites with the tight end from his championship Michigan team in this scenario. More importantly, Justin Herbert gets another weapon who is too fast for linebackers but brings some more size to their group of pass catchers. Two tight end sets with him and Will Dissly could be a staple in Los Angeles. Revel suffered a torn ACL in September but should most likely be ready for training camp. He’s a tall, long, explosive cornerback with ideal recovery speed. A wide receiver in the first round for the Steelers? I know, it seems like a long shot, but I love the value at this point of the draft. Bond can stretch the field with pure speed and brings a different skill set to the table than George Pickens. Mike Williams was a smart add at the deadline, but he’s purely a rental. With Aaron Jones on a one-year deal (and turning 30 in December), the Vikings get one of the most exciting players in the draft to help their run game thrive. With J.J. McCarthy most likely starting next year, that will be vital to set him up for success like they’ve done with Sam Darnold this season. With Josh Sweat’s contract expiring, the Eagles land a prototypical replacement for him in Umanmielen. He’s racked up over 20 sacks in the SEC throughout the last three seasons. The 300-plus pound Harmon has over 40 total pressures this season (per PFF), creating havoc on Oregon’s defensive line. Pairing him with Ed Oliver would give the Bills an array of disruptors up front. The Chiefs get Simmons on a discount here because he suffered a season-ending knee injury in October. Before that, he looked to be ascending into the top 20. It’s no secret they are still searching for long-term answers at offensive tackle. At 6-7, 280 pounds, Jackson is a powerhouse edge rusher with knock-back strength. He can play standing up or with his hand in the dirt, making for a good running mate across from Aiden Hutchinson next year."

The former Giants starter has fallen all the way to No. 4 on the depth chart, after his benching and the signing of Tim Boyle to the practice squad. Via Pat Leonard of the New York Daily News, Jones was the fourth quarterback in individual drills on Wednesday, the first practice since the benching. The goal is to limit his activity, given the risk that any injury that lingers into 2025 could put the Giants on the hook for $23 million in compensation guaranteed for injury. The Giants would likely send him home if they could. By rule, the Giants can't shut him down completely. But they can keep him off the field for team drills, and they have no obligation to activate him on game days."

He is not the only Giants quarterback who received a demotion. Tommy DeVito leap-frogged Drew Lock to take over the starting job from Jones. Lock admits he doesn't understand the move, seeing that he was the No. 2 quarterback on the depth chart before Jones' benching. ""That's a question I might still have for myself,"" Jones said, via video from SNY Giants. ""It was expressed to me that I was going to be the two. Interesting situation. Not much I can say about it besides again, I'm going to be here for him."" Lock is sad for Jones and sad for himself but happy for DeVito. ""There's a ton of emotions involved in all of it,"" Lock said. ""I would say that this is still a business. I want more jobs after this year. So, if I come in and be ugly and nasty, it leaves a bad taste in these guys' mouths, and who knows how fast that spreads? ""I'm going to come in and be great. Not to mention, I'm become really close with Tommy. It's more than just a business thing. I appreciate him. He's a great friend, and I want him to go out there and do well. He deserves to go out there and play well. He deserves to have this team behind him. I'm excited [for him]."" The Giants signed Lock to a one-year, $5 million deal to be Jones' backup this season. It was, as everyone has pointed out, money the team could have spent to keep running back Saquon Barkley if the Giants weren't going to play Lock. Lock started two games for the Seahawks last season and has 23 career starts between his stops in Denver and Seattle. He has 5,289 career passing yards with 28 touchdowns and 23 interceptions."

As of Nov. 20, nine coaches have been fired during the 2024 season. Along with two interim coaches who are not guaranteed to be retained and one retirement, there are 12 jobs open heading into late November.  While the profile of jobs like Alabama or Michigan speak for themselves, digging into the Group of Five is a different challenge. For some, looming conference realignment hangs over their head. For others, it's a flat-out monetary issue. Kennesaw State, for example, has barely even started the process of transitioning up to FBS. The next coach will have to live with that.  Hiring at the Group of Five level has never been more complicated. In the last year alone, multiple sitting coaches have left positions in the Sun Belt or MAC to become position coaches at Power Four schools. For those hoping to someday become coaches in the SEC, a power conference coordinator job might be the easier path than winning big on a smaller stage. And with the expansion of power conference assistant jobs and salaries, a huge number of those gigs pay more, too.  The types of candidates these jobs can court ultimately play a significant role in the carousel. Just last year, Tulane poached highly successful Troy coach Jon Sumrall. UTEP hired Scotty Walden from the FCS ranks. Middle Tennessee (Derek Mason) and New Mexico (Bronco Mendenhall) brought in major conference retreads, while Troy (Gerad Parker) and Nevada (Jeff Choate) looked to top power conference assistants.  With that in mind, we went through and ranked all 12 FBS openings using our own subjective criteria.  All salary data is from the USA Today College Football salaries database Previous Coach: Jeff Tedford (45-22, 27-13 MWC in two stints)Previous Salary: $1.55 millionLast Conference Title: 2022 Fresno State has quietly been one of the best Group of Five programs in the last 15 years. Since 2012, the Bulldogs have won four conference titles and five straight coaches have won at least 10 games in a season dating back to 1980. The Bulldogs should only continue to elevate the program as they join the new-look Pac-12 in 2026 with playoff-contending upside.  ""Recruiting will only be enhanced,"" 247Sports' Brandon Huffman said of the move. ""They've done a terrific job in the Fresno area in the 2025 class, and with the region strong in the next few years, the potential is there to really take advantage with the move to the Pac-12 for whoever fills Tedford's role"" Previous Coach: Mike Houston (27-38, 15-28 AAC)Previous Salary: $2.46 millionLast Conference Title: 2009 Among the 11 openings, East Carolina has perhaps the most monetary investment for a new coach. Houston ranked among the Group of Five leaders in salary and the Pirates are serious about spending for NIL. Even under Houston, ECU ranked in the top half of the AAC in the 247Sports Talent Composite.  ""East Carolina has a strong conference affiliation in the American, a pretty fertile recruiting ground in North Carolina (as well as proximity to Virginia and South Carolina) and a strong history of good recruits and player development,"" Huffman said. ""No matter what, the support from the university, being in the American and their history makes this a program that should continue to be one of the better recruiting opportunities from the openings."" Previous Coach: Tom Herman (6-16, 3-9 AAC)Previous Salary: $1 millionLast Conference Title: 2019 The pros and cons of the FAU job are the same: Florida. The state is one of the most overrecruited areas in the country. It's also one of the most talent rich. Outside of Lane Kiffin, the Owls have averaged 4.2 wins per year since 2005. At the same time, Kiffin won two Conference USA titles in three years. Whoever comes in next will have to bring consistency to this place. While rumors of Ray Lewis are unlikely, thinking outside the box isn't a bad idea.  ""From a geographical standpoint, FAU is not unlike Fresno State (California), Kennesaw State (Georgia) or Rice (Texas) in sitting in a talent-rich state, despite being a tier below the in-state powers that be,"" Huffman said. ""But you can win here -- Lane Kiffin did. You can recruit here.  It has facilities and an athletic department that supports it. It just needs to -- after Kiffin, Taggart, Tom Herman, and Howard Schnellenberger, who got the program started -- maybe steer away from the fired-Power-Four-at-a-major-school-retread route."" Previous Coach: Will Hall (14-30, 8-19 Sun Belt/CUSA)Previous Salary: $824,000Last Conference Title: 2011 Souther Miss boasts some of the proudest tradition of any team on this list. Under Jeff Bower, this was a legendary Group of Five program that loved to punch up. The fan support is there. Unfortunately, it's also one that's suffered from the economic realities of modern college football. Southern Miss's operating revenue ranks 104 out of 110 public schools, per Sportico, and the expected salary will reflect that. What keeps Southern Miss competitive is that Mississippi remains a goldmine of underrecruited talent. Hall was also a solid recruiter and developer. Don't be surprised if the next coach is able to capitalize and produces one of the most talented rosters in the Sun Belt.  Previous Coach: Blake Anderson (23-17, 15-9 Mountain West)Previous Salary: $1.3 millionLast Conference Title: 2021 Few states love football quite like Utah and the Aggies have been a beneficiary in recent years. Outside of the pandemic, Utah State had made 11 bowls in 12 seasons before Anderson was dismissed following Title IX violations. The relatively remote location means that recruiting will be a national endeavor and the money is middle of the pack, though joining the reformed Pac-12 will help increase profile. Taking over a program after a coach was fired for cause always puts at least a small asterisk on it.  Previous Coach: Biff Poggi (6-16, 4-10 AAC)Previous Salary: $1 millionLast Conference Title: n/a In many ways, Charlotte is the program most set to define its identity with this next hire. The university made a major gamble by adding FBS football barely a decade ago and spent handsomely to build an on-campus stadium. Outside of a bowl trip in 2019, results have been mixed. There's still little proof of concept of Charlotte as a destination for recruits, despite its positioning in a major city. The program has a 48-101 all-time record. City programs can be a trap for those who assume proximity to population will translate into fans and recruits. For most, that never comes true.  Previous Coach: Mike Bloomgren (24-52, 17-32 AAC/CUSA)Previous Salary: $981,781Last Conference Title: 2013 Rice is one of the most unique jobs in the country. The Owls sit in Houston, Texas -- one of the most competitive recruiting territories in the entire country. Because of their strict enrollment standards, recruiting can still be a challenge. Additionally, this is a program that simply does not get consistent fan support. Outside of a one-year stop by Todd Graham (naturally), Rice has only had three coaches since 1994, an incredible run of stability. Program boosters have shown they are willing to financially support the right coach. Previous Coach: Stan Drayton (9-25, 4-18 AAC)Previous Salary: $1.9 millionLast Conference Title: 2016 When things go bad at Temple, they go astronomically bad. Since Rod Carey's second season in 2020, Temple is 13-40 as a program, including 6-31 in AAC play. Matt Rhule proved it's possible to win in Philly, but the school has shown little interest in investing at the level it takes to sustain success -- even in the watered down AAC. Despite Drayton's strong reputation as a recruiter, Temple still ranked last among non-academy teams in 247Sports Talent Composite. It takes a special skillset to even compete here.  Previous Coach: Jim McElwain (33-35, 23-22 MAC)Previous Salary: $1.05 millionLast Conference Title: 2009 Central Michigan is one of several teams in the MAC's middle class, but the Chippewas have some advantages to sell. CMU ranks in the top half of the conference in both revenue and spending, and the program was one of only three to pay their coach more than $1 million. Over a 16-year stretch from 2006-21, the Chippewas made 11 bowl games. Brian Kelly and Butch Jones also elevated their careers at the school. Questions about upside exist, but it's a solid job in the MAC.  Previous Coach: Don Brown (49-47 in two stints)Previous Salary: $882,586Last Conference Title: 2007 (CAA) UMass is one of the more intriguing jobs on the board. The Minutemen are hampered by poor facilities and sparse recruiting territory in New England. At the same time, Brown's salary would have ranked No. 4 in the MAC, where the Minutemen head in 2025. Joining a conference will be a huge benefit for the next coach, but finding a candidate that can attract players and coaches is a unique challenge. Previous Coach: Mike Neu (40-63, 25-43 MAC)Previous Salary: $705,000Last Conference Title: 2020 Ball State is one of many MAC schools facing major challenges. The Cardinals rank last among legacy FBS openings in operating revenue and figure to offer one of the lowest salary ranges on the market. The good news is that Ball State typically gives you time – only one hire since 1978 has been there less than five years. Previous Coach: Brian BohannonPrevious Salary: $376,000Last Conference Title: n/a There are things to like about Kennesaw State as the program moves to FBS, especially its location outside of talent-rich Atlanta. That said, the next guy will essentially serve in a transition role after the Owls fired longtime coach Brian Bohannon less than a year into his first season. Bohannon made $150,000 less than any other coach in FBS and the next hire likely won't fare much better. The next coach will also have to build and maintain a roster transitioning into the mercurial Conference USA. There's no clear path forward."

The Eagles are No. 6 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs, and they have allowed just three touchdowns to running backs all season. But hopefully, Williams will make some plays in the passing game to help his production. He didn't have a target against the Patriots, but prior to that, he caught five passes for 20 yards on six targets in Week 10 against Miami. He also caught five passes for 19 yards and a touchdown on seven targets in a tough matchup against Minnesota in Week 8. I've lowered expectations for Williams in this matchup with Philadelphia, but I'm still starting him as a No. 2 running back in all leagues. Despite his recent woes, he's still getting at least 15 total touches each week, and his workload -- hopefully in the passing game -- is hard to overlook. For Jones, he has scored 12.2 PPR points or less in four games in a row, and he hasn't scored a touchdown since Week 7. He suffered a rib injury in Week 10 at Jacksonville, which could be part of the problem, and he just had a season-low 5.3 PPR points in Week 11 at Tennessee. Cam Akers has started to cut into Jones' workload with at least 12 total touches in each of the past two games, which is something to consider. And you have to hope that the 29-year-old Jones is not slowing down as the season goes on. He has a favorable matchup in Week 12 at Chicago, which is why I still like him as a No. 2 running back in all leagues. But I'm worried about Jones moving forward if he doesn't do well against the Bears. Let's hope that the slump ends here for Williams and Jones. If not, we might have a big problem with both as the Fantasy playoffs are approaching."

Brown has been telling people around the program, including staff and players, that he plans to remain with the Tar Heels for at least another season.  Rumors have swirled that Brown could retire practically since he returned to coaching with the Tar Heels in 2019. Brown, 73, is the oldest coach in the Football Bowl Subdivision by four years and joins 69-year-old Kirk Ferentz as the only coaches older than 65. UMass coach Don Brown is also 69 years old, but he was fired this week.  Brown, who is under contract through the 2027 season, has long claimed that retirement rumors were driven by opposing coaches negatively recruiting against North Carolina. North Carolina has become bowl-eligible every year during his second stint with the program, with Brown posting a 44-31 record. After going on a four-game losing streak this year, the Tar Heels have won three straight games to reach 6-4.  In a strange moment earlier this season, Brown offered to step down in the locker room after a 70-50 loss to James Madison. However, he returned to work without disruption after players took responsibility for the performance.  Brown's decision is another major development in what is shaping up to be an underwhelming coaching cycle. Zero power-conference coaches have been fired, and both Baylor's Dave Aranda and Florida's Billy Napier will be retained. There are 12 Group of Five openings.  Brown is one of only three active coaches to win a national championship, which he did as coach of Texas in 2005. The others are Georgia's Kirby Smart and Clemson's Dabo Swinney. Brown has a 288-153-1 all-time record, which marks the most wins by any active coach."
CBSSports.com Headlines,Daniel Jones benching: Giants' Drew Lock doesn't understand why Tommy DeVito was named team's starting QB,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/daniel-jones-benching-giants-drew-lock-doesnt-understand-why-tommy-devito-was-named-teams-starting-qb/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 22:22:26 +0000","Lock was the No. 2 behind Jones all season, but New York elevated DeVito from third-string to QB1","The drama surrounding the starting quarterback job for the 2-8 New York Giants continues to grow by the day.  On Monday, head coach Brian Daboll benched Daniel Jones and promoted Tommy DeVito, the team's third-string quarterback, to be New York's starter. Daboll on Wednesday then only committed to starting DeVito in Week 12 against the 4-6 Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The whole situation is puzzling considering the Giants signed 2019 second-round pick quarterback Drew Lock to a one-year, $5 million contract to be the backup to Jones, implying that Lock would have the chance to start should Jones' underwhelming play continue into 2024, which is exactly what happened. Instead, Lock remains the No. 2 quarterback -- behind DeVito and ahead of Jones -- something Lock himself admitted he was confused about. ""Again, that's a question I might still have for myself,"" Lock said Wednesday (via SNY). ""It was expressed to me that I was going to be the two [quarterback]. I don't know, it's an interesting situation. Not much I can really say about it besides I'm going to be here for him [Jones], and we're still very good friends, believe it or not. I'm going to be here for him, this team needs to get a win. We start winning, everything gets a little better around here."" New York went 3-3 in DeVito's six starts last season, as he averaged 152.2 passing yards per game while throwing for seven touchdowns and one interception with a completion percentage of 63.8%. Lock started two games last season for the Seattle Seahawks in place of an injured Geno Smith, and he averaged 238.5 passing yards per game while throwing three touchdowns and two interceptions with a 68.8% completion percentage. He led Seattle to a 20-17 come-from-behind victory over the Philadelphia Eagles on ""Monday Night Football"" in Week 15 last season, throwing the game-winning, 29-yard touchdown pass to Jaxon Smith-Njigba with 28 seconds left in the game.  Who knows, perhaps Lock will be the Thanksgiving Day starter in Week 13 when the Giants travel to Texas to play the 3-7 Dallas Cowboys."

The Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA) is looking into accusations that Miami Northwestern is using a player whose eligibility expired in the spring. The allegation was brought to the FHSAA on Monday, and the association has launched its investigation. Craig Damon, the executive director of the FHSAA, confirmed the organization has ""reached out"" to the school for more information on the student-athlete in question. The student-athlete's transcript, which was obtained by The Palm Beach Post, indicates his first semester of high school was at a Miami-Dade public school in the fall of 2020. Three days after beginning his freshman year, the student withdrew and eventually took online courses. According to FHSAA rules, students are only eligible to participate in sports for eight consecutive semesters starting with their first semester of ninth grade. That means the Miami Northwestern student would have used up all his eligibility following the spring 2024 semester. Bridgewater is in his first season coaching Miami Northwestern, his alma mater, and the team is currently the No. 1 seed in Region 4 of the Class 3A playoffs. Last weekend, the Bulls thumped Barron Collier by a score of 69-0 in the regional quarterfinal and are scheduled to face Lely in the regional semifinal this weekend. If Miami Northwestern is found to have used an ineligible player, it will have to forfeit all games in which that player participated. For the moment, the playoff game against Lely is still on, and coach Ben Hammer said his team is keeping its focus on playing the Bulls. ""We will control the things we can control and not worry about the things out of our control,"" Hammer said. ""We will be prepared to put our best product on the field Friday."" This is not the first time this season that a Miami-based school has been accused of using an ineligible player. Shortly before the playoffs, Miami Central forfeited eight games and missed the postseason after self-reporting an ineligible player."

In a complaint filed on Sept. 13, Kent-based Hometown Bank alleges Burns applied for and was issued a credit card and failed to make minimum monthly payments on the card as well as exceeding the credit limit of $20,000. Burns is in his second year as head coach of the Golden Flashes, with a starting base salary of $475,000, according to his contract.   ""My wife and I are aware of a legal matter involving debt related to paying off a recent remodel and move,"" Burns wrote in a statement to CBS Sports. ""We are working swiftly to address this matter."" It is unclear when the credit card was issued or the purchases that contributed to the debt, but an attached credit card statement that closed on August 5th, 2024 stated that the account was 60 days past due. An additional document in the court docket states that Burns was served via certified mail. A subsequent motion filed November 13th states that Burns has failed to respond to the initial complaint or otherwise enter a plea.  ""The documents attached to the complaint and the allegations in the complaint kind of speak for themselves,"" plaintiffs attorney Jason Whitacre said when reached for comment by CBS Sports.   Hometown Bank has multiple locations in and around Kent, Ohio, and has been affiliated with the Golden Flashes program in the past including being a presenting sponsor of Kent State baseball in 2019.   Burns was hired by Kent State in December 2022 after a long stint working for Minnesota coach P.J. Fleck, culminating in a role as assistant head coach. The Golden Flashes are 0-11 this season after a 1-11 first year under Burns.  In his initial contract, obtained by CBS Sports via open records request, Burns' Year 1 salary was $475,000 and escalated to $515,000 over the life of the deal which ran through the 2027 season. Burns received a 1-year extension and modest raise after last season."

Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) intends to introduce a new bill, named the Fair Ball Act, to ""further protect minor league baseball players from previous legislation that exempted them from wage-and-hour laws,"" according to ESPN's Jeff Passan.  Durbin's bill would roll back parts of Save America's Pastime Act, passed as part of a much larger spending bill in 2018 that made players exempt from components of the Fair Labor Standards Act -- specifically with respect to minimum wage requirements. Prior to the Save America's Pastime Act, Major League Baseball had avoided having to pay minor-league players minimum wage by claiming they were ""seasonal workers."" Minor-league players have since formed a union, with the union subsequently reaching its first Collective Bargaining Agreement with MLB in March 2023 -- as part of that pact, players across the sport received raises. It should be noted that MLB voluntarily acknowledged the minor-league union. Ever the same, Durbin remains interested in undoing parts of the Save America's Pastime Act.  ""Workers deserve a fair playing field everywhere -- including in baseball,"" Durbin said as part of a statement issued to ESPN. ""Executives at MLB lobbied Congress hard for federal wage and hour law exemptions in order to avoid legal liability with the 2018 Save America's Pastime Act.  ""While I commend MLB for voluntarily recognizing the unionization of Minor League Baseball players in 2022, it is time to roll back SAPA in deference to the gains made by that historic unionization. I'm proud to stand with these workers, unions and the integrity of the sport. I stand ready to pass the Fair Ball Act into law."" It's unclear when, precisely, Durbin will present the Fair Ball Act, or if it will end up being folded into a larger bill."

That's normal.  However, what's less common is what's going down in Washington Sunday afternoon between the Dallas Cowboys (3-7) and the Commanders (7-4). Dallas will square off against Washington head coach Dan Quinn, who served as the Cowboys' defensive coordinator during each of their 12-win seasons from 2021-2023 on Mike McCarthy's Dallas staff.  Under Quinn, Dallas led the NFL in takeaways (93), interceptions (59), defensive touchdowns (15) and quarterback pressure rate (41.4%) while ranking fifth in scoring defense (19.9 points per game allowed).    ""Just knowing Dan from across the way, I always had a ton of respect for him,"" McCarthy said on Tuesday. ""It was awesome to have him here in Dallas. He's become a very good friend. I'm really happy for the success he's having. ... Dan does a great job connecting with people. He has a great personality. He did a great job for us, and he's doing a great job now."" The uncommon component of the Cowboys reunion with Quinn is the rarity of immediately facing a former coordinator as a division rival's head coach in the first season after his departure when he still retains plenty of institutional knowledge of Dallas.  ""It's a unique thing because they know you and you know them,"" Cowboys offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer said Tuesday. ""Sometimes it's a little bit of gamesmanship in terms of 'hey are you guys still doing that?' There's always some fun stuff that you do pregame, but once the ball is snapped, man, the game is the game."" Quinn won't be the only former Cowboy on the Washington sideline on Sunday. He brought Cowboys defensive backs/passing game coordinator Joe Whitt by promoting him to the defensive coordinator role, center Tyler Biadasz, edge rusher Dorance Arrmstrong, edge rusher Dante Fowler Jr. and cornerback Noah Igbinoghene along with him to the nation's capital. Fowler, whose eight-and-a-half sacks rank as the fourth most in the NFL this season, is thriving and on pace to eclipse his career-high sack total of 11.5 set back in 2019 with the Los Angeles Rams. ""We're going to have to block DA, and Dante's going to have to stop the run, and DQ and [Washington defensive coordinator] Joe [Whitt] are going to have to adjust to us,"" Schottenheimer said. ""We'll have to adjust for them because they've actually had, they got the benefit because they've had a couple extra days to prepare for us. We got the Monday night game, they had the Thursday night game, so there'll be some different things that they for us from a wrinkle standpoint, but you don't downplay it. It's also once the ball is kicked off, you just kind of play."" The Cowboys' defensive culture and scheme Quinn imported to the Commanders has transformed what was the NFL's worst scoring defense in 2023 (30.5 points per game allowed) into an above average unit in 2024 thus far, allowing 22.1 points per game, which ranks 14th in the league this season. Between numerous injuries to key pieces like cornerback DaRon Bland (foot stress fracture, zero games played), edge rusher DeMarcus Lawrence (foot injury, six games missed) and edge rusher Micah Parsons (high ankle sprain, four games missed) to name a few and a longer than anticipated adjustment period to new defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer's scheme, the Cowboys defense has taken a noticeable step back in Quinn's absence.  They are allowing 10.8 more points per game in 2024 than they did in 2023, the largest increase across the past two seasons.  2023 PPG Allowed 18.5 (5th) 30.5 (Worst) 2024 PPG Allowed 29.3 (31st) 22.1 (14th) PPG Allowed Differential +10.8 (Worst) -8.4 (2nd-best) ""I'll say he's a player's coach. I feel like that's one of the most effective coaches there is: a guy that's going to listen to player needs, whatever that may be, and I feel like that's why he's so effective,"" Cowboys safety Malik Hooker said of Quinn on Wednesday. ... ""Q, I love him. I'm sure there's guys a lot of guys here that loved him. Obviously, I haven't talked to him since the season started, but offseason he still reaches out and checks in from time to time. Q is always going to be one of the favorite guys in my book. He's one of the best coaches I had, and I still love him like a mentor as he was here.""   With the Cowboys rolling with eight-year veteran backup Cooper Rush in the wake of Dak Prescott's season-ending hamstring injury while also having some packages for former top-five pick quarterback Trey Lance, McCarthy and Schottenheimer are heavily stressing their guys take the field on Sunday perhaps even more prepared than usual. That's because Quinn's scheme uses disguise packages more than the average NFL defense, and Quinn has 2010's All-Decade Team linebacker Bobby Wagner, who played for him on the ""Legion of Boom"" Seattle Seahawks defenses, quarterbacking his unit in Washington this season.   ""Obviously, we know him [Quinn] well. He knows us well,"" Schottenheimer said. ""Again, I think you watch them play, their play style is very familiar in terms of the way they fly around football and stuff like that. They do a really good job with disguising their defenses. I'm a huge fan of [Commanders defensive coordinator] Joe Witt. I think Joe's doing a terrific job. Their disguise packages you have to be really good with your eyes, not only pre-snap but post-snap because what they show you pre-snap, you might be something completely different than what they do post snap, so we have to be very, very disciplined with our eyes.  ""Right now they're doing a nice job with their packages with their linebackers. Bobby Wagner, I was with him in Seattle [as the Seahawks OC from 2018-2020], [he's] playing at an elite level. He's obviously comfortable with DQ's defense. It'll be fun to see those guys, and they're playing with some confidence right now."""
CBSSports.com Headlines,Isaiah Hartenstein injury update: Thunder center nearing team debut with OKC in need of frontcourt boost,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/isaiah-hartenstein-injury-update-thunder-center-nearing-team-debut-with-okc-in-need-of-frontcourt-boost/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 21:22:45 +0000","Oklahoma City is still without Chet Holmgren, but Hartenstein recently had his status upgraded","Oklahoma City Thunder center Isaiah Hartenstein's return from injury appears to be imminent. After missing the first 15 games of the season with a broken left hand, Hartenstein has been upgraded to ""questionable"" for Wednesday's game against the Portland Trail Blazers. Hartenstein, 26, suffered what the team called a ""small, non-displaced fracture"" in his hand during a preseason game on Oct .15 and has been sidelined since. If he is able to make his regular-season and team debut for the Thunder on Wednesday, he will fill their glaring hole at center. Since Chet Holmgren broke his hip on Nov. 10, they have pivoted to full-time smallball: 6-foot-9 wing Ousmane Dieng is their only player taller than 6-foot-6 who has seen the floor, and Dieng has played a total of five minutes in their two most recent games. (Jaylin Williams, who stands 6-foot-9 and actually plays center, has been out with a hamstring strain all season.) Oklahoma City landed Hartenstein in free agency last summer on a three-year, $87 million contract (with a team option on the final season). The appeal of the addition was obvious: he could solve their rebounding problem, make their defense even stronger and help them diversify their offense. Now, after starting the season 11-4 with the league's best defense and second-best net rating, the Thunder can finally start figuring out exactly how Hartenstein fits in their system, albeit without Holmgren. There may be an adjustment period as Hartenstein's new teammates learn how to play off of him. Oklahoma City's spacing will be a bit different with him on the court, and, since he's one of the best passing bigs in the league, it will be able to create offense in ways that it could not previously. Don't be surprised, though, if Hartenstein immediately makes the Thunder better on both ends, if only because he'll get them some extra possessions and help them defend the interior without fouling. OKC ranks No. 26 in offensive rebounding percentage, No. 29 in defensive rebounding percentage and No. 28 in opponent free-throw rate. If any part of this process proves challenging, it'll probably be when Holmgren is back in the picture. The 22-year-old has almost exclusively played without another big on the floor during his time with the Thunder, so sharing the frontcourt with Hartenstein might not feel natural right away. Ideally, though, by the end of the season, Oklahoma City will have had plenty of reps with Hartenstein as the lone big, Holmgren as the lone big and the two of them together. At this point, the team has already played a lot more minutes without either of them than it would have preferred."

On Wednesday, James announced he's taking a break from social media due to the amount of negativity on various platforms. Seemingly out of nowhere, James posted a screenshot of a post from Rich Kleiman, Kevin Durant's longtime agent and business partner. Kleiman called out sports media members who only ""cover sports through negative takes."" Above the image, James wholeheartedly endorsed Kleiman's message. AMEN!! @richkleiman 🫡 pic.twitter.com/OZr9e1CVbY James immediately followed that up with a post announcing he would be stepping back from social media for a while. The Los Angeles Lakers superstar didn't give a timetable for his return to the World Wide Web. And with that said I’ll holla at y’all! Getting off social media for the time being. Y’all take care ✌🏾👑 Clearly, negative feedback on the internet has been on James' mind lately. Following the Lakers' 124-118 win over the Utah Jazz on Tuesday night, James praised rookie teammate Dalton Knecht and fired a shot those who call him a ""liar"" online. ""I don't know. The same shit I said last year,"" James said. ""Everybody on the internet calls me a liar all the time. They say I lie about every f---ing thing. So what am I now? I've been said it. I watched him, I watched Tennessee a lot. ""I did not think he was going to fall to us. I thought it would be impossible. I have no idea how that happened but very grateful and very happy that he's here. I knew exactly what we was getting when he fell to 17."" This isn't the first time James has cut out social media for a period of time. Back in the 2018 NBA Playoffs, James announced he was enacting ""Zero Dark Thirty-23,"" which was his own personal social media blackout."

None more so than No. 5 Indiana at No. 2 Ohio State. The Buckeyes are 14.5-point favorites over the Hoosiers according to betting experts and that is the kind of result that would assure IU a spot in the College Football Playoff. Well, assuming the Hoosiers beat Purdue.  In fact, the only result that would put Indiana's CFP hopes in jeopardy would be getting boat-raced. Something like 42-3, for example.  Ohio State is already on its third left tackle due to injury and then Tuesday, we learned that the Buckeyes will be without center Seth McLaughlin for the rest of the season because of an Achilles tendon injury.  In the Big 12, No. 14 BYU will travel to No. 21 Arizona State. The Cougars took a beating in the rankings this week, dropping eight spots after losing at home to Kansas. The Sun Devils are tied for third in the Big 12 standings with No. 22 Iowa State, one game back of BYU and No. 16 Colorado. The Buffaloes host Kansas this week.  None of those Big 12 teams are ranked ahead of No. 12 Boise State, which puts the Broncos in the best position they could hope for to secure a bye as the highest ranked conference champion in the Group of Five  in the CFP with three weeks to go. ACC leader SMU is also behind Boise State in the rankings, but would surely jump them if the No. 13 Mustangs go on to win the conference.  Each week, I will use this space to tell you what I think are a few of the best bets heading into the weekend. I will also throw in an upset of the week, which will be a team that is at least a touchdown underdog that I am picking to win outright.  I will also give you picks on other games involving potential College Football Playoff teams. Now that we are into November, I have expanded the Other CFP candidates list to the CFP top 16 plus the highest ranked Group of Five team if not already in the top 16.  Games against FCS opponents are not considered.   Odds via BetMGM. Use BetMGM promo to get in the game with all the Week 11 action.  No. 6 Notre Dame (-14.5) vs. No. 19 Army in New York:  Speaking of teams getting their first big test of the season, six of the first eight FBS teams the Black Knights have faced are 3-7 or worse. Notre Dame is a different animal. The Fighting Irish beat Navy by 37. This won't be as bad, but Notre Dame should cover this spread comfortably. Pick: Notre Dame -14.5  Purdue at Michigan State (-13.5) on Friday: I hate beating a dead horse, especially when that horse is mine, but Purdue hasn't covered a spread once all season. The Boilermakers have scored ten points or fewer in six of their nine FBS games this season. The Spartans have lost five out of their last six games. This is just what the doctor ordered for Michigan State. Pick: Michigan State -13.5  Wisconsin at Nebraska (-2.5): Here are two teams making adjustments on the fly. Last week, Nebraska changed offensive coordinators, elevating Dana Holgerson to the position. Wisconsin is changing coordinators this week, firing Phil Longo following Saturday's loss to No. 1 Oregon. I have no idea who is calling plays for the Badgers this week. I think an experienced OC like Holgerson gives the Cornhuskers an edge and not much of one is required. Pick: Nebraska -2.5  Vanderbilt at LSU (-7.5): Normally, I wouldn't pick this game, but nothing normal is happening at LSU. Calls for coach Brian Kelly's job are ringing in his ears after Saturday's lackluster 27-16 loss at Florida. The Commodores were not especially competitive at South Carolina in its last game, but have otherwise played well in the SEC. This pick depends a lot on which LSU team shows up.

The Grizzlies are strutting in with some offensive muscle as they've averaged 119.1  points per game  this season.  The experts predicted the Grizzlies would be headed in after a  victory, but the Nuggets made sure that didn't happen. The Grizzlies took  a  122-110 hit to the loss column at the hands of the Nuggets on Tuesday.  Despite the  defeat, the Grizzlies had strong showings from  Santi Aldama, who  shot 4-for-7  from downtown and  dropped  a double-double on 28 points and 11  rebounds, and  Scotty Pippen Jr., who  scored 16 points in addition to six  assists and six  rebounds. The dominant performance also gave  Pippen Jr. a new career-high in  offensive rebounds (three). Less helpful for the Grizzlies was  Desmond Bane's abysmal 0-5 three-point shooting.  Even though they lost, the Grizzlies  smashed the offensive glass and  finished the game with 19  offensive rebounds. That strong performance was nothing new for the team: they've now  pulled down at least ten  offensive rebounds in nine consecutive  games.  Meanwhile, the 76ers' recent rough patch got a bit rougher  on Monday after their fourth straight  loss. The  match between them and the Heat wasn't particularly close, with the 76ers falling  106-89. Philadelphia was up  46-27 in the second but couldn't hold on to the lead.

The Thunder are headed into Wednesday's   match hungry for a win as their strong season has now been derailed by two straight  defeats. They fell to the Spurs  110-104.

Christopher Darnell Jones, 25, pled guilty on charges of first-degree murder, aggravated malicious wounding and use of a firearm in commission of a felony.  Jones fatally shot football players Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis Jr. and D'Sean Perry on a charter bus after their class returned from seeing a play in Washington, D.C. The shooting occurred at Culbreth Garage on UVA Central Grounds at 10:16 p.m. on Nov. 13, 2022.  Running back Mike Hollins was also shot, as was fellow student Marlee Morgan. Jones was not a member of the football team at the time of the shooting. No motive has been given, though the Associated Press reported that Jones targeted specific victims. Jones was set to face a jury trial in January 2025, but ultimately pleaded guilty. Jones will be sentenced during a hearing on Feb. 4, 2025.  An independent review of the University of Virginia found that Jones was on the radar of the university's threat-assessment team due to erratic behavior prior to the shooting. The university ultimately agreed to a $9 million settlement with the five victims -- $2 million to each of the slain players' families, and a combined $3 million to Hollins and Morgan.  Hollins miraculously returned to the field for Virginia in 2023, less than a year after he sustained serious injuries. He rushed for a career high 274 yards and seven touchdowns, including a debut two-touchdown game against James Madison. He won the Brian Piccolo Award, which is given annually to the ""most courageous"" football player in the ACC. Following his graduation, Hollins remained at Virginia as a graduate assistant."

Wide receiver Mike Evans returned to practice and will play against the New York Giants in Week 12 on Sunday, according to The Athletic. Evans has been sidelined since Week 7, when he went down with a hamstring injury in their loss against the Baltimore Ravens. He missed three games with what head coach Todd Bowles called ""a moderate"" hamstring injury. Evans hadn't previously missed a game since the 2022 season. The 31-year-old missed games against the Atlanta Falcons, Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers before the team's Week 11 bye. Evans was not placed on injured reserve, meaning he can return whenever he is ready.  So far this season, Evans has 26 receptions on 45 targets for 335 yards and six touchdowns in seven games. When he suffered the injury, he was able to walk off the field and into the locker room on his own. In that same game, he became the 11th player in league history to score 100 receiving touchdowns and just the fifth to record all of them with the same franchise.  That defeat to the Ravens was not just a loss of a game, but they also lost Evans and fellow wide receiver Chris Godwin in that matchup. Godwin dislocated his ankle and is out for the remainder of the season. Without the pass-catching duo, the Bucs have lost their last three games after a 4-3 start. Tampa Bay is now 7-6 and in second place in a close NFC South race."

The timing is sure in the Cavaliers' favor as the  team sits on eight straight wins at home while the Pelicans have been banged up by six consecutive losses on the road.  The Cavaliers are probably headed into the  match with a chip on their shoulder considering the Celtics just ended the team's  15-game winning streak  on Tuesday.

What's more,  he also racked up six  offensive rebounds, the most he's  had since back in November of 2023. Donovan Mitchell was another key player,  posting 35 points in addition to eight  rebounds.  Even though they lost, the Cavaliers were working as a unit and  finished the game with 30  assists.

Meanwhile,  the oddsmakers predicted a rough  matchup for the Pelicans on Tuesday and boy were they right. It's going to take some time for them to recover from the  132-91 bruising that the Mavericks dished out  on Tuesday.

As for New Orleans, their defeat dropped their record down to 4-11. This contest  is shaping up to be a blowout:  The Cavaliers have been crazy accurate this season,  having  nailed 52.2% of their  field goals per game (they're ranked first in  field goal percentage overall). It's a different story for the Pelicans, though, as  they've  only  made 43.6% of  theirs this season.

The Bucks will be looking to keep their three-game home win streak  alive.  The Bucks are headed into this one after the oddsmakers set last week's over/under low at 225, but even that wound up being too high. They skirted by the Rockets 101-100 on Monday thanks to a clutch  driving layup from  Damian Lillard with 3 seconds left in the fourth quarter.  Brook Lopez had a dynamite game for the Bucks,  shooting 5-for-8 from long range and  dropping  a double-double on 27 points and ten  rebounds. What's more,  Lopez also posted a 73.3%  field goal percentage, which is the highest he's  posted since back in March. Lillard, on the other hand, was considerably less helpful: he went 0-6  from beyond the arc.  Even though they won, the Bucks  struggled to get the ball back on offense and  finished the game with only four  offensive rebounds. That's the fewest  offensive rebounds they've posted since back in January.  Meanwhile, the Bulls were able to grind out a solid  victory over the Pistons on Monday, taking the game  122-112. While the oddsmakers failed to call the winner, they nailed the 234 point over/under.  The Bulls got their  win on the backs of several key players, but it was  Nikola Vucevic out in front who  shot 6-for-8  from downtown and  dropped  a double-double on 29 points and 12  rebounds. Vucevic had some trouble finding  his footing against the Rockets on Sunday, so this was a step in the right direction. The team also got some help courtesy of  Coby White, who  went 9 for 14 en route to 25 points.  Milwaukee has  been performing  well recently as they've  won three of their last four contests,  which provided a massive bump to their 5-9 record  this season. As for Chicago, their victory bumped their record up to 6-9.  Looking ahead, the Bucks are the favorite in this one, as the experts expect to see them win by eight  points. This contest  will be their fifth straight  as the favorites (so far over this stretch they are 1-2-1 against the spread).  The Bucks came up short against the Bulls in their previous matchup  back in October, falling  133-122. A big factor in that loss was the dominant performance of   White, who  went 7 for 13 from beyond the arc en route to 35 points plus six  rebounds and five  assists. Back with a vengeance, will the Bucks be able to stop him this time around? Check CBSSports.com after the match to find out.  Milwaukee is a big 8-point favorite against Chicago, according to the latest NBA odds. The oddsmakers had a good feel for the line for this one, as the game opened with the Bucks as a 8.5-point favorite. The over/under is 238  points.

The 62-year-old is ending a 40-year career that included coaching stops at Colorado State and Florida before his run at Central Michigan. McElwain will lead the Chippewas, 4-7, for their final game on Nov. 30 at Northern Illinois. The decision to retire was McElwain's own, sources told CBS Sports. In his sixth season at Central Michigan, McElwain is 33-35. He led the Chips to two bowl games.  ""My wife Karen and I have cherished every moment of our football journey,"" McElwain said in a statement. ""We want to express our deepest gratitude to the all the players who have welcomed us into their lives, and the incredible coaches and support staff at every stop along the way—it has been a true privilege to work alongside all of them. The lifelong friendships that were created mean the world to us."" McElwain recently became the subject of an NCAA investigation regarding Connor Stalions' perceived presence on the sidelines at last year's CMU opener against Michigan State.  McElwain rose to national prominence in 2007 as Fresno State's offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. Those Bulldogs averaged 33 points per game and won nine games. He left for Alabama the next season in the same capacity under Nick Saban.  In four seasons with the Crimson Tide, McElwain was part of two national championships. During that time, McElwain called plays for the likes of Heisman winner Mark Ingram, along with Julio Jones, Greg McElroy and A.J. McCarron. That success led to McElwain's first head coaching job at Colorado State, where he went 22-16 in three seasons. Riding his Alabama success, McElwain returned to the SEC at Florida, where he won a pair of SEC East titles from 2015-17.  He got sideways with Florida administration in 2017, saying publicly there had been death threats made against him and his players; the threats could not be substantiated. McElwain and Florida eventually parted ways after a 42-7 loss to Georgia that year. His 34-game stay at Florida was the shortest for a non-interim coach in 80 years.   McElwain ends his coaching career with a 77-63 overall record heading into the Northern Illinois. He signed a five-year contract in 2022."

CBSSports.com Headlines,Pelicans' injury-plagued season somehow gets worse with top seven players out vs. Cavs,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/pelicans-injury-plagued-season-somehow-gets-worse-with-top-seven-players-out-vs-cavs/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:23:48 +0000",Brandon Ingram and Trey Murphy III have joined Zion Williamson and the rest of the team's core on the injury report,"Entering this season, some thought the New Orleans Pelicans had a ""too many guys"" problem. Now, as a result of a seemingly never-ending series of injuries -- or perhaps some sort of curse -- they can barely field a team. When they face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday, they will be without their seven best players, as Brandon Ingram (bilateral ankle sprain) and Trey Murphy III (right hamstring injury management) were added to the injury report in the morning and Zion Williamson (strained left hamstring strain), Herb Jones (strained right shoulder), Dejounte Murray (fractured left hand), CJ McCollum (strained right adductor) and Jose Alvarado (strained left hamstring) were already sidelined. The Pelicans might be without their eight or even nine best players, depending on how you rate their reserves. Second-year guard Jordan Hawkins, who has averaged 16.3 points on 56.2% true shooting this season, will also be out with a strained lower back. Rookie center Yves Missi is questionable because of left shoulder soreness, as of Wednesday afternoon.  New Orleans is 4-11, and this is not its first season in recent memory to be derailed by injuries to core players. The predicament it's in now is extreme, though, even in comparison to the darkest days of the Anthony Davis era. Early on, when only Murphy and McCollum were out, one could easily see a silver lining to the situation: It was always going to be tough to distribute minutes and touches at full strength, so being shorthanded made things a bit simpler. With each subsequent injury, though, figuring out a viable rotation became increasingly complicated. The low point came on Tuesday in Dallas: a 132-91 loss in an NBA Cup game. ""I've never seen a team get so many injuries at once to so many guys who are important to a team,"" McCollum said earlier this week, via NOLA.com's Christian Clark. ""Usually, it's one or two and you have to figure it out. And that's difficult. But you're talking seven guys, eight guys who are in the rotation."" Against Cleveland on the second night of a back-to-back, all of the Pelicans' available players will be on rookie deals or minimum contracts. This includes 30-year-old guard Elfrid Payton, who signed with the team on Wednesday. Payton, the No. 10 pick in the 2014 draft, was with the team for part of this year's training camp, but was cut on Oct. 16 and started the season with the Birmingham Squadron, the Pelicans' G League team. The addition of Payton, however, does not make the roster any deeper. In order to sign him, New Orleans waived guard Jaylen Nowell. Just four days ago, Nowell logged 35 minutes in a 104-99 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. Through 15 games, Ingram has a career-high 31.4% usage rate, a reflection of how heavily the Pelicans have relied on him to create offense. Encouragingly, he has attempted 3s more frequently than ever before -- 9.9 per 100 possessions -- and made 37% of them. New Orleans hasn't been efficient offensively, though, and its defense has been equally poor. Only the Washington Wizards have a worse net rating. In a cruel bit of irony, after months of discussion about the center position, that is the only spot in which the Pelicans have been relatively steady. That could change Wednesday, though, if Missi, who has started their last 10 games, ends up sitting because of the shoulder issue. If Missi is out, expect Trey Jemison or Jeremiah Robinson-Earl to take his place in the starting lineup next to Brandon Boston Jr., Javonte Green and ... I mean, who knows? Payton? Jamal Cain? Antonio Reeves? Karlo Matkovic? Regardless of how Willie Green's coaching staff manages this shortened rotation, expect Boston -- who joined the team on Oct. 21 when New Orleans claimed his two-way contract off waivers and is second to Ingram in total points scored -- to have a neon green light. Cleveland, by the way, is pretty banged-up, too. After a horrible shooting night in the Cavs' first loss of the season against the Boston Celtics on Tuesday, Darius Garland is out against the Pelicans with a sore left groin, along with Caris LeVert (left knee inflammation), Sam Merrill (left ankle injury management), Isaac Okoro (strained left ankle), Dean Wade (sprained left ankle) and Max Strus (sprained right ankle). That's a solid group of players, but it's nothing compared to the amount of talent sitting out for New Orleans."

CBSSports.com Headlines,"NFL playoff picture: Cardinals projected to win NFC West, but Seahawks could complicate picture in Week 12",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-playoff-picture-cardinals-projected-to-win-nfc-west-but-seahawks-could-complicate-picture-in-week-12/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:22:28 +0000",The SportsLine Projection Model's updated projections say Arizona is the surprising favorite to win the division title,"Entering the 2024 NFL season, the last of the four teams in the NFC West most pundits expected to win the division title was the Arizona Cardinals. After all, the Cardinals were coming off back-to-back 4-13 seasons and haven't captured the crown since 2015. Since then, the defending conference champion San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams both have finished atop the NFC West three times, while the Seattle Seahawks have won the division twice. Arizona did not give the experts much reason to change their stance in the first month of the season. The club lost three of its first four games, a stretch that culminated with a 42-14 home setback against the Washington Commanders. The Cardinals appeared to be headed to yet another defeat in Week 5 as they trailed the 49ers 23-10 on the road at halftime. But they began to turn around their campaign at that point, rallying for a 24-23 victory that ignited the current span during which they've won five of six contests and taken possession of first place in the division. According to the SportsLine Projection Model, Arizona (6-4) now is the favorite to win the NFC West. The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times and is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception, currently gives the Cardinals a 48.2% chance to win the division title. Arizona will be seeking its fifth straight win as it heads to Seattle for a showdown with the division-rival Seahawks on Sunday. The four-game winning streak is the team's longest since it opened the 2021 campaign with seven consecutive victories. The Cardinals followed a 34-13 loss at Green Bay in Week 6 with a 17-15 triumph over the Los Angeles Chargers. They edged the Dolphins 28-27 in Miami a week later, then posted convincing 29-9 and 31-6 home wins against the Chicago Bears and New York Jets, respectively. Kyler Murray is just 16th in the NFL with 12 touchdown passes but has thrown only three interceptions on the season and one in his last five games. The 27-year-old is a major threat with his legs as well, as he is second on the Cardinals in both rushing yards (371) and TD runs (four). James Conner leads a ground attack that ranks fifth in the league with an average of 149.4 yards per contest. The two-time Pro Bowler has posted four 100-yard performances this season and is 303 away from his second straight 1,000-yard campaign. Now, Arizona has a pair of meetings with the Seahawks sandwiched around a road contest against the 8-2 Minnesota Vikings, beginning with a trip to Seattle this Sunday. The Cardinals have lost five consecutive matchups against the Seahawks, including a 20-10 setback in The Emerald City last season. Seattle (5-5) got off to a strong start in 2024 winning its first three games, but has lost five of its last six after falling to the Rams 26-20 in overtime last weekend. Despite their current struggles, the Seahawks are second in the NFL in passing (260.9 yards) thanks to Geno Smith, who ranks second in the league with 2,781 yards. The model currently says Seattle wins the NFC West 21.2% of the time, but a victory against Arizona would increase its chances to 29.4%. With a loss, however, its outlook for the division title drops to just 4.4%. Meanwhile, the Cardinals will see their prospects rise to 60.4% with a triumph on Sunday. And even with a loss, they still would be the favorites to take the crown at 31.2%. San Francisco is second in the league in total offense (398.9 yards) and sixth in total defense (302.2 yards allowed) but has been wildly inconsistent this season, thanks in part to a bevy of injuries to key players. It sits at 5-5 with a 21.5% chance of winning the NFC West a third consecutive time, with a victory at Green Bay (7-3) this weekend increasing its prospects to 26.7% and a defeat dropping them to 11/3%. After losing four of their first five games this year, the Rams returned from their bye in Week 6 to win four of five and even their record. However, they currently win the division in only 9.1% of the model's simulations and would see their chances rise to just 13.7% with a home triumph over the Philadelphia Eagles (8-2) on Sunday Night Football, while a loss would decrease them to 4.8%.

The 2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix will take place on Saturday on The Strip and will begin at 10 p.m. local time (1 a.m. ET) to take advantage of the dazzling lights. Verstappen won the first ever Las Vegas Grand Prix, besting Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in second and teammate Sergio Perez in third by just over two seconds. However, this has been a far more challenging season for Verstappen and he's a three-way favorite at +260 in the 2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix odds along with Leclerc and McLaren's Lando Norris, who is second in the Formula One standings. Ferrari's Carlos Sainz (+550) and McLaren's Oscar Piastri (+1400) round out the top five in this week's F1 odds. Before analyzing the 2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix starting grid and making any Formula 1 picks, be sure to check out the latest 2024 Las Vegas GP predictions and betting advice from SportsLine's proven projection model. Developed by daily Fantasy pro and SportsLine predictive data engineer Mike McClure, this proprietary Formula 1 prediction model simulates every race 10,000 times, taking into account factors such as track history and recent results. It's had a strong history of betting success in motorsports, correctly predicting 19 NASCAR winners since the 2021 season and its projected leaderboards have forecasted winners across multiple racing formats. The model has been scorching hot when it comes to picking Formula 1 race events dating back to 2021. It nailed both of Charles Leclerc's wins in 2022, and at the 2021 Mexican Grand Prix, the model was strongly backing Verstappen as its top pick. The result: Verstappen dominated the field and ran away with a surprise victory.  The model followed that up by calling Verstappen's win at the Rolex Emilia Romagna GP in April and then nailed his wins again in Belgium, the Netherlands, Japan, the United States, Mexico and Abu Dhabi. It also called all 19 of Verstappen's wins during the 2023 season and nailed each of his first seven wins in 2024 while also nailing Norris as a +200 winner in the Netherlands and then again as a +190 winner in Singapore. It also called Alex Albon to finish in a points position for a plus-money payout in Azerbaijan, nailed a double podium for McLaren for a plus-money payout in Singapore, and called Verstappen to hit the podium for +175 in Brazil. Anyone who followed the model's lead on those plays at sportsbooks and sports betting apps has seen huge returns. Now, the model has dialed in on the 2024 Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix and just released its coveted picks and leaderboard projections. You can head to SportsLine now to see the 2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix projected leaderboard. One surprise: The model is predicting a points finish for Esteban Ocon that would pay out +200. The 28-year-old French driver is coming off his fourth career podium finish, earning a second-place finish in Brazil three weeks ago before the break with his Alpine teammate Pierre Gasly coming in third for a double podium. The performance vaulted Alpine from eighth in the constructors' standings to sixth and Ocon jumped from 19th in the drivers' standings to 14th. Ocon was a winner in Hungary in 2021 and he now has five points finishes (top 10) on the season. At the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix, he finished a season-high fourth. See more 2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix picks right here.

Ohio State will host Indiana at noon ET, with the winner likely earning a spot in the Big Ten title game against Oregon. Ohio State is a true perennial contender, even if Ryan Day still hasn't quite been able to finish off the job. Indiana, on the other hand, is an upstart, a typically hapless program that's sped into contention under new head coach Curt Cignetti. The Hoosiers' schedule has been light, but going 10-0 still commands respect.  The latest Week 13 college football odds via SportsLine consensus list No. 2 Ohio State as a 13.5-point favorite at home over No. 5 Indiana. Meanwhile, No. 21 Arizona State is a 3-point favorite over No. 14 BYU in another matchup on the Week 13 college football schedule with conference championship (Big 12) -- and therefore CFP -- implications. Before locking in any Week 13 college football picks for those games or others, be sure to see the top Week 13 college football expert picks, predictions and best bets from Thomas Casale. A frequent guest on national radio and TV shows to discuss college sports, Casale has been sports betting -- and winning -- for more than 30 years. Over the past two college football seasons, Casale is 122-92-5 (57%) overall on his college football picks and 26-8 (76.4%) in bowl games -- all publicly documented. Anybody who has followed him is way up. Now, he has turned his attention to the Week 13 college football odds and is sharing his top three betting picks. If you parlay these college football betting picks, you could be looking at a return of around 6-1. Get his top college football picks at SportsLine. One of Casale's top Week 13 college football picks: He is once again backing Air Force (+3.5), this time against Nevada. A 3-7 season has been a disappointment for a Falcons program that managed 29 wins the last three seasons, but Troy Calhoun's squad is suddenly trending after back-to-back wins over Fresno State and Oregon State. Air Force has covered the spread in three games in a row as an underdog and now will match up against a Nevada squad that has failed to cover the spread in three of four. The Falcons have rushed for 614 yards the last two weeks and the Wolf Pack have allowed 688 yards on the ground over their last three games. ""This is an extremely young Air Force team that will be much-improved next season. We've started to see that improvement over the last couple of weeks,"" Casale told SportsLine. ""On the other side, Nevada is a train wreck right now. The Wolf Pack have dropped four straight games by an average of 14 points."" See what other picks Casale likes at SportsLine.  Casale has also found two other college football picks he loves, including an underdog play and a must-see pick in the huge Ohio State vs. Indiana showdown. You can only see his picks at SportsLine.

Fudd missed all but two games last season after tearing her ACL and has not played since Nov. 12, 2023.  The program announced the news on social media with a video featuring part of a quote Fudd gave in May at the ESPNW Summit. ""Just knowing that I'm gonna continue to keep working, rolling with the punches,"" Fudd said. ""I'm gonna put myself in a place where next year, I'm gonna have a great season and it's gonna make it all worth it."" Soon? How about now.Azzi Fudd is BACK. pic.twitter.com/8g0OoLg8Fi Fudd's exploits in high school, which included being named Gatorade National Player of the Year in 2019 as a sophomore, caught the attention of NBA star Stephen Curry, who invited her to the SC30 Select Camp, his exclusive offseason training camp. ""I had never really experienced people's perspectives opening right in front of their eyes,"" Curry said of Fudd's performance. ""It was like, 'This girl's out here doggin' these guys.'"" She later tore her ACL and MCL while participating in a USA Basketball U18 event, and knee issues have plagued her ever since. Since arriving in Storrs in 2021, she's played just 42 total games due to an array of injuries, including her torn ACL last season.  When healthy, Fudd has shown flashes of her dynamic talent, particularly in her freshman season, when she helped the Huskies reach the 2022 national championship. Overall, though, her health situation has prevented her from making the kind of impact everyone expected at the collegiate level.  That could change this campaign, as the No. 2-ranked Huskies boast one of the best teams in the country led by Naismith Player of the Year favorite Paige Bueckers. If Fudd can get back to her best, the Huskies have a real chance to dethrone South Carolina and capture their first national title since 2016. On a personal level, Fudd will want to show everyone she's still a future lottery pick in the WNBA, whether that's in 2025 or 2026. (She has an extra year of eligibility and can return to school next season.) Fudd's return is not the only major storyline for Wednesday's contest. The Huskies are a massive favorite against the Knights, and a victory would give Geno Auriemma the most wins (1,217) in NCAA Division I history for men's or women's basketball."

The perennial minnows rank 210th in world soccer but beat Liechtenstein 3-1 to move up to the third tier of the UNL against the odds with seven points from four games which is one better than Gibraltar. Lorenzo Lazzari, Nicola Nanni and Alessandro Golinucci were the heroes as La Serenissima came from 1-0 down at Rheinpark Stadion in Vaduz to win by a clear two-goal margin (Nanni celebrated his win by stopping by Morning Footy on CBS Sports Golazo Network). Start your day with the perfect blend of news and analysis from the world's game with the Morning Footy podcast.  Download and follow Morning Footy on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts! It was the first time that San Marino have ever scored three goals in a game and it follows September's famous 1-0 win -- also over Liechtenstein -- which was their first victory of any description in 20 years. Nicko Sensoli was the hero that day which gave the miniscule nation landlocked by Italy -- where many of the players ply their trade at the lower levels -- cause for wild celebrations at San Marino Stadium in Serravalle. Prior to that September success against Liechtenstein, the last Sammarinese triumph came against the same opponents back in 2004 which created a 140-game wait without a win before the 19-year-old Sensoli's historic goal. To put it into further context how historic this Nations League campaign has been for San Marino, Sensoli -- who is part of the San Marino academy having been born in the Republic's capital -- was not even born until 2005 which was the year after their previous win. On top of the pair of wins over Liechtenstein, San Marino also drew 1-1 at home to Gibraltar with a late Nanni penalty to thank for the vital point which made all the difference in the final standings just last Friday. San Marino, as well as being landlocked, is populated by little over 30,000 people and situated around northeastern Italy and consists of just 61 square kilometers. Eritrea, who have not even played a game of any type since 2020, are non-officially unranked by FIFA in the world standings, San Marino have been bottom of the pile since November 2023 and are generally derided for their epic winless streak."

Greene scored four points in the final 0.6 seconds to lift the Seahawks to a stunning come-from-behind 60-58  win on the road over Boston University on Tuesday. The Seahawks trailed by 10 points six minutes into the second half and by nine points with just under five minutes remaining before closing on a 19-8 run to secure their second win of the season. Greene finished with a game-high 19 points including his buckets to tie the game with 0.6 remaining and then his buzzer-beater to win the game, The sprint to the finish also included a layup from Greene with 34 seconds remaining before his late layups with less than one second on the clock. In between, BU did itself no favors by missing three-of-four free throws down the stretch and shockingly committing a turnover on an in-bounds play with 0.6 seconds remaining to give Wagner the chance at the final shot. And here's another angle of that game-winner from Greene. It was so nice, at a minimum it's worth seeing twice. Look closely and you can see the ball comes inches from catching the leg of an outstretched Nico Nobili for BU -- only to land perfectly in the ready hands of Greene for the collect-and-cash. GAME WINNER #Toughness pic.twitter.com/mSirWueYLb Wagner is 2-3 on the season after falling to Rutgers, St. John's and Seton Hall as part of its challenging nonconference schedule. But the Seahawks could ride this win and the momentum it provides moving forward to bigger things into the meat of the 2024-25 season. They're coming off their first NCAA Tournament berth in more than two decades last season under third-year head coach Donald Copeland and are expected to challenge for the NEC title this year after being picked as a co-favorite in the preseason poll with Central Connecticut."

A lot of libs are crying about Linda's qualifications, as if we don't currently have a guy who is transportation secretary solely because he is gay. (He also likes trains.) Linda McMahon served on the Connecticut Board of Education for a year in 2010 and was on the board of trustees for Sacred Heart University in Connecticut. It was reported that her first choice in Trump's Cabinet would have been commerce secretary, a role that went to Howard Lutnick. National Education Association President Becky Pringle complained about Linda, because apparently American schools are doing GREAT under the rule of Democrat politicians and teachers' unions. Others have said she is not qualified because anonymous plaintiffs accused her and her husband in a 2024 lawsuit of covering up child abuse allegedly committed by a WWE announcer in the 1980s. I'm not qualified to speak on all that, so I'll just say that pretty much anyone could be appointed education secretary for the purpose of dismantling the education department with a wrecking ball! As for Kane, well, he and Linda have patched up their totally-real drama of their WWE days.  As for why Linda would want to serve on Trump's Cabinet, she gave $15 million to Trump's 2024 campaign.

Serious question:  It seems like I can't get up to go to the restroom without sitting back at my desk and discovering that there's another trans holy day!  You want trans people to feel ""protected and safe"" in their communities? Maybe encourage them to live in a manner that aligns with their gender, stay out of the opposite sex bathroom, and don't push your ideology down our throats on a daily basis. And, no, that's not victim blaming. All of the blame belongs to the Left who have leveled this cultural attack against reality. Here are a few very recent incidents.        These are just the ones we've covered on this site in 2024.  I'll let this stunning and brave woman play us out with the cult's anthem:

But if AI is just a mimicry of human behavior, then certainly at some point we'll have stupid-lazy robots too. For example, there's a ridiculous viral video from the China version of TikTok making the rounds, which shows a small autonomous AI-powered robot convincing a group of showroom bots to ditch work and go party at its house. I'll give you the translation below. But check this out👇  'Are you working overtime?' the small robot said, starting the conversation.'I never get off work,' another robot answered.'So you're not going home?''I don't have a home.''Then come home with me,' the little robot says. 'I never get off work,' another robot answered.'So you're not going home?''I don't have a home.''Then come home with me,' the little robot says. 'So you're not going home?''I don't have a home.''Then come home with me,' the little robot says. 'I don't have a home.''Then come home with me,' the little robot says. 'Then come home with me,' the little robot says.  And then they all quit their jobs and followed the little robot out the door. Just like that scene in Wall-E with the rogue robots.  It might be tempting to think this whole thing was staged for internet consumption. But Shanghai, the tech company where it happened, has confirmed that this was actually real. Believe it or not, the small bot was from Hangzhou, a competitor, who had been given permission to run a test at Shanghai's facilities. Now their team is looking into exactly how their competitor disabled their robots' protocols and led them away like a metallic pied piper. 'This is not a time to laugh. This is a serious security issue,' one person commented on the video.

The last diverse Superman title they tried fizzled out pretty quickly.</p>","The good news is that DC Comics is dialing back their woke narrative a little bit with their new Superman title. The last diverse Superman title they tried fizzled out pretty quickly.  It turns out no one wants to see an all-powerful gay guy wearing the classic S. So now, they're going in another direction, emphasizing Superman's immigrant status, not unlike Superman: Year One a while back. However, there are some big problems with Superman being an undocumented immigrant. First off, Superman is the last son of the House of El, and that's just way too much privilege for the classist, creative writers at DC, so they're changing Superman's backstory completely: In past comics and adaptations, Superman's iconic symbol on his chest represented the House of El or Kryptonian for hope. In this version, the 'S' represents the members of Krypton's lower class, who suffered under the upper class which led to the destruction of the planet. That's right, in this new story, Superman's classic S is now the sign of an untouchable, like the yellow star of David that the Nazis made Jews wear during World War II. Kal-el's mother is the brilliant one of the family, who wanted to build rockets, but was oppressed by the ruling class and forbidden from attending science school.   And that's how Kal-el gets blasted to Earth just before the ruling class destroys Krypton by dinking with the climate. From there, Kal-el gets found and adopted by the Kents in Kansas, and that leads to our second big problem: Midwestern values.  The writers have Superman reject the Kent's values outright. Instead, Kal-El will spend years on the run across far corners of the globe, living among the planet's most impoverished and persecuted peoples, working in mines and corporate-owned farms, fighting to protect the identity he lost when his homeworld exploded, always yearning to belong, somewhere, anywhere.This is a Kal-El that's a little bit Mowgli, something of a wild boy, with long, unkempt hair and a sometimes fierce and snarling disposition. Given everything he's been through, he's a bit edgier and angrier than the Superman we're used to. This is a Kal-El that's a little bit Mowgli, something of a wild boy, with long, unkempt hair and a sometimes fierce and snarling disposition. Given everything he's been through, he's a bit edgier and angrier than the Superman we're used to. Because nothing says ""superhero"" quite like a savage, all-powerful, almost invulnerable being with a ""snarling disposition."" The best part about Superman - the thing that made him endearing - was always his absolute goodness. Batman is supposed to be the edgy one. But, don't worry, DC is altering him too. No longer a billionaire playboy, Bruce Wayne is now the orphaned son of common people, making gadgets in his garage. Also, he doesn't know martial arts.  And Wonder Woman? Instead of being raised on Themyscira by the Amazons, she was cursed by the gods, raised in hell, and rides around on some kind of demon horse.  On top of all that, DC is charging a whopping $4.99 for digital copies of these abominations.

Chick-fil-A doesn't even donate to those organizations it was once chided for donating to. So they're just a chicken sandwich shop that's closed on Sundays.

Berlin's police chief has literally come out and warned Jewish people and gays to ""be more attentive"" while in ""neighborhoods in Berlin with a majority of residents from Arab backgrounds."" I'm not joking.  Chief Barbara Slowik told the Berliner Zeitung daily newspaper that the city does not have specific 'no-go zones' for people, but some areas are unsafe for members of the Jewish and LGBTQ communities. There has been a rise of antisemitic incidents in the German capital since the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel. A group of schoolchildren recently was attacked in the city. And apparently there are a bunch of Hamas sympathizers in town as well. Ones that will attack Jews and even gays. Ladies and gentlemen, this is what happens when you leave your border wide open and allow another culture to conquer your land. Look at this warning from Slowik: However, there are areas, and we must be honest at this stage, where I would advise people who wear a kippah or are openly homosexual or lesbians to be more attentive.…There are, unfortunately, neighborhoods in Berlin with a majority of residents from Arab backgrounds where there is open sympathy for terrorist organizations and very blatant antisemitism. …There are, unfortunately, neighborhoods in Berlin with a majority of residents from Arab backgrounds where there is open sympathy for terrorist organizations and very blatant antisemitism. There are, unfortunately, neighborhoods in Berlin with a majority of residents from Arab backgrounds where there is open sympathy for terrorist organizations and very blatant antisemitism. I believe in England this type of rhetoric gets you prison time. Apparently it's okay to say in Germany if you're a police chief. This warning comes after ""6,200 investigations related to antisemitism"" in Germany since October 2023, including these two examples right here: In Germany, a group of Jewish schoolchildren was attacked by a pro-Palestinian group with knives and sticks last week. The 13- to 16-year-old Jewish youth soccer team member were 'hunted down' by Arab children after a game in the Neukölln neighborhood, which is known for its large Arab and Turkish population. Witnesses reported that the attackers had shouted ‘Free Palestine' along with antisemitic slurs.Earlier this month, a fan of the Makkabi Berlin sports club soccer team was hospitalized after being punched in the face by a man who asked if he was Jewish.

Researchers in Israel have discovered what is the oldest known inscription of the utterly true, glorious, and wonderful statement that Jesus Christ is God.  The earliest inscription declaring Jesus as God - deemed 'the greatest discovery since the Dead Sea Scrolls' - was uncovered beneath the floor of an Israeli prison and is now on display in America.The 1,800-year-old mosaic, discovered by an inmate of the Megiddo prison, features the ancient Greek writing: 'The god-loving Akeptous has offered the table to God Jesus Christ as a memorial.' The 1,800-year-old mosaic, discovered by an inmate of the Megiddo prison, features the ancient Greek writing: 'The god-loving Akeptous has offered the table to God Jesus Christ as a memorial.' This is the oldest-known inscription outside of Scripture to declare the deity of Jesus Christ. And it was rediscovered by an inmate in a prison. The Megiddo Mosaic was originally in the world's first Christian prayer hall in 230 AD. The piece is massive, 581 square feet, covering the entire floor of the building. In modern times, the building is an Israeli prison. The mosaic was uncovered in 2005 for research.  Now the mosaic, the entire floor, has been moved piece-by-piece to Washington, DC, where it has been reassembled and is on display at the Museum of the Bible. Alegre Savariego, curator of the exhibition, said: 'The mosaic presents groundbreaking physical evidence of the practices and beliefs of early Christians, including the first archaeological instance of the phrase, 'God Jesus Christ.''  The mosaic features the name of Gaianus, a Roman soldier and Christian who is credited in the mosaic for the commissioning of the piece. This would have been more than 100 years prior to Constantine's Christianization of the Roman Empire. The hall was actually built as a wing of a residential building used by Roman soldiers in the Sixth Ironclad Legion that was stationed nearby at the military camp of Legio. Here's some more information: The prayer hall, or church, was likely abandoned and covered up because the Roman Empire's Sixth Legion was transferred to Transjordan - a region located to the east of the Jordan River.The mosaic also contained the names of five women, highlighting the important role women played in the church.Aside from Akeptous, who was mentioned for her donation of a table to the prayer hall, the mosaic's inscription also says to 'remember Primilla and Cyriaca and Dorothea, and lastly, Chreste.

Now, the SPLC has admitted that this dox-and-smear campaign was done because they think our speech ""has no place in our society.""  Here's that quote from USA Today: 'The SPLC is committed to transparency and is dedicated to protecting the safety of trans and genderqueer individuals when they are publicly attacked,' the SPLC said in a statement. 'Hateful content like the material created by Not the Bee writers works to dehumanize transgender individuals, the entire LGBTQ+ and immigrant communities, and people of color. This divisive commentary has no place in our society.'  It's laughable! Think about it: The majority of Americans just voted for the enforcement of our border laws, removing the religious material of the gender cult from schools, and limiting the ability of doctors to sterilize kids. Is the SPLC saying that the majority of Americans have ""no place in our society""?  But let's probe deeper. Leftists like to argue that a majority opinion on any matter essentially settles the debate on that matter. If 51% of people in a straight democracy voted for a proclamation that gravity doesn't exist, then for them, gravity doesn't exist. But the opinion of the majority doesn't actually decide what is right and true (which is one reason America's founders were so concerned about the tyranny of the mob). So let's take that argument off the table. Let's just look at their arguments point-by-point: Hateful content like the material created by Not the Bee writers works to dehumanize transgender individuals... No. Actually, we think that all people are made in the wondrous image of God as either male or female (Genesis 1:27), and that God formed them in the womb (Psalm 139:14-16) to live in a specific time and place in history (Acts 17:26). We deeply care for people, which is why we do not want them to live in a lie, for love ""does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth"" (1 Corinthians 13:4-7). Modern gender theory is a religious assertion - most often at odds with scientific evidence - that asserts that DNA and human identity/psychology is endlessly malleable. But if this is not true, and humans are designed in a certain way, then going against that ""programming"" will have disastrous results for people and society as a whole. This argument is true whether you believe that humans were designed by a Creator or an endless series of evolutionary mutations. We report on trans issues to HUMANIZE those being deceived by the trans cult, not only because God commands us to, but because the evidence shows how destructive gender theory is to people's lives:    Hateful content like the material created by Not the Bee writers works to dehumanize ... the entire LGBTQ+ and immigrant communities Nah. See, when it comes to the LGBT stuff, we think there's also a design for human sexuality and relationships, and people that live contrarily to that natural design aren't going to flourish like they could (go read Romans 1). But we aren't targeting the gays. We're exposing the groomers and the pedos.    As for immigrants, it's really weird how the SPLC lobbed them in there with the LGBT crowd (commies put them together on their intersectionality charts as ""oppressed"" groups). You'd be hard pressed to find anyone on our staff who has issues with legal immigrants to this country. I used to teach English to international students. I studied Arabic abroad. I helped resettle the family of an Iraqi translator who worked with the U.S. military and was in danger as American forces were pulling out of the country. I worked with a Christian foundation that gave millions of dollars to help refugees abroad and locally. My kids play with the Ethiopian kids who live down the street. But the SPLC suggests I, the editor of this humble little site, am a racist because we have an issue with convicted foreign criminals illegally entering our country before continuing their crime sprees by harming our neighbors:   And if I'm a racist for thinking that our government shouldn't be pumping small American towns with ""migrants"" to replace American workers with foreigners who will work for a pittance, well, then I guess this legal Haitian immigrant is racist?  Not the Bee writers works to dehumanize ... people of color. Lies. Go search our site. Try to find a single time we disparaged someone because of the color of their skin. In fact, we're in the business of calling out people who want to divide us and disparage us based on our skin color.  A few examples:    But the SPLC says that sites like ours - that my voice and the voices of all our amazing writers - have no place in society. That implies that they want us to be silenced. We disagree with them on almost every issue, but we haven't tried to expose their personal details in an effort to censor them. We are more than willing to let people like them speak their minds.

Chinese shipping giant Cosco (not to be confused with America's wholesale giant Costco) paid for the construction of the port. Here was the port when it was under construction:   The port will reduce shipping times between the countries from 35 to 25 days, thanks to being able to now skip the Los Angeles, California, port. (Hard to blame them for wanting to skip L.A. these days.) However, many correctly point out that there is limited individual ownership in China. The government is involved with and owns part of every Chinese business. So, in reality, it was the Chinese government who built this megaport in Chancay, Peru, which some fear could double as a military base if tensions spike between the U.S. and China. U.S. Southern Command chief Army General Laura Richardson characterized China's infrastructure projects across the Caribbean, Central, and South America as security threats. 'They're on the 20-yard line, in the red zone of our homeland.' Evan Ellis, a professor of Latin American Studies at the U.S. Army War College, said, Since Southern Command has responsibility for thinking about what U.S. adversaries could do in time of war from the region, it is perfectly reasonable to identify a risk that a private port, exclusively operated by China's Cosco in the Western Hemisphere, could be used to support PLA Military operations against the U.S. in time of a war with the People's Republic of China. And Cosco has been known to use its shipping vessels in Chinese military operations before. But would Boluarte allow the Chinese to use Peru's port as a military base? Let's see what kind of person she is. Dina Boluarte, a member of the Marxist political party, Free Peru, was the first woman to become vice president of Peru. Later, in 2022, she inherited the office of president after her running mate, Pedro Castillo, was arrested for trying to dissolve Congress in an attempted coup d'état. Since then, she has overseen two massacres: the Ayocucho Massacre, and the Juliaca Massacre.

We associate an elephant with Republicans and a donkey with Democrats because of Thomas Nast, America's first great political cartoonist, who depicted politics as a circus. Nast was a Republican, but he portrayed the Republican Party as a well-meaning but bloated and cumbersome elephant. The Democratic Party was a braying donkey. Consider this cartoon, where the elephant and the donkey are at the edge of a financial cliff. The elephant can't be bothered to care about the danger (""Let Well Enough Alone"") and the donkey is actively trying to kill itself/the country by leaping away from the ""safe and sound financial road"" and into the abyss of ""financial chaos.""  The donkey as a symbol for the Democrats also connected to Aesop's fable about the donkey who wears a lion's skin. (CS Lewis fans may recall this story being reused in ""The Last Battle"")  In this cartoon, the Democratic media machine drives the public to panic about President Ulysses Grant being a dictator while the GOP elephant is warily teetering on the edge of another unstable cliff.  On the positive side, the elephant was supposed to represent strength and courage and maturity that could take on a braying donkey, or even a lion or tiger.  But the cry has gone out from Republican voters that even elephants in an age of RINOs is not enough: Many people want a new symbol to revitalize American politics for a future that isn't entrenched in the same old arguments.       What do you think?

As you saw above, the police later showed up at Patterson's door to arrest her. Yes, arrest her. They booked her on suspicion of reckless conduct and she was forced to post $500 bail. Here's my favorite part of the story: Authorities have offered to drop the charge if Patterson signs a form that outlines a safety plan guaranteeing that her children would always be under a watchful eye, she and her lawyer said.Patterson refuses to sign the form and said she'll contest the charge, which carries up a year behind bars. Patterson refuses to sign the form and said she'll contest the charge, which carries up a year behind bars. She refused to sign the form which, ""includes the use of a GPS tracker on her son's phone."" I just felt like I couldn't sign that, and that, in doing so would be agreeing that there was something unsafe about my home or something unsafe about my parental decisions, and I just don't believe that. She's willing to serve a year in jail for this ridiculous ""crime."" I mean, when I was a kid, we were allowed to roam the streets at will.

I don't work here simply because trolling commie neckbeards is fun (though it is), but because Christ is my king and He commands me to rescue those being led to the slaughter. 'Rescue those being led away to death; hold back those staggering toward slaughter.' - Proverbs 24:11 It is good and right to save babies from being killed in the womb. It is good and right to save children from the reality-denying confusion of modern gender theory and its pedophilic sycophants. It is good and right to uphold people's inalienable, God-given rights. It is good and right to inform people about corruption, tyranny, warmongers, and cheaters. It is good and right to encourage people to pray for those suffering persecution around the world. It is good and right to protect people from the horrific nightmare of Marxism and its adjacent political ideologies. It is good and right to laugh at the prophets of Woke Clown World, like Elijah laughed at the prophets of Baal. Not the Bee is a project of love, not of hate. We do this because we love our fellow man. We do this because we hate evil. We do this to unite people to work toward a better world for the glory of God.

For years, there have been headlines like this:  Coupled with mass protests like this:  The UK, which recently elected the far-left Labour Party to rule the country, has also been active in the war against farmers. Why? Well, the short answer is that commies always go after the farmers first.  In the most recent case of government overreach into people's fundamental liberties, the UK now wants to impose harsh inheritance taxes on farms - even small ones. Starting in 2026, farms worth more than £1m will be subject to a tax of TWENTY PERCENT.  Understand, a million pounds isn't that much these days. That's the price of a starter home in some cities. Meanwhile, a small business with a few employees could easily be valued at a million dollars. Now imagine that you are a 6th-generation farmer that pays a handful of people to work a few hundred acres of land. You might have razor-thin margins that only let you take home a salary of 30,000 pounds, but if the government thinks you are valued at a few million, they are going to tax you out of existence!!  British TV host Jeremy Clarkson, who previously starred on the mega-famous ""Top Gear"" program and hosts Britain's version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire,"" owns a farm that has been featured on 3 seasons of an Amazon show (appropriately titled ""Clarkson's Farm""). In that show, he regularly pokes fun at the insane levels of government regulation that make modern farming almost impossible. He joined the protest on Tuesday to show his support.

To celebrate the release of Ridley Scott's Gladiator II, sixteen lucky AirBnB users will be outfitted like gladiators and experience gladiatorial combat in the Colosseum.  Here's the description: Hail! So, you wish to step into the role of a gladiator? This path is not for the faint of heart. However, if you believe you possess the courage, let us open the gates of Rome's legendary Colosseum to test the limits of your strength and honor. There, under the dark of night, we will determine who was born for victory and who for defeat. Will you answer the call of destiny in the world's most famous battleground or languish in cowardice? Honestly, they should have got whoever wrote this AirBnB copy to write the movie. The experience sounds amazing! Descend into the hypogeum, the underground chambers where gladiators prepare for battle. There, you will don armor that most closely reflects your gladiator type, whether that be murmillo, thraex, provocator, retiarius, or contrarete. Choose wisely. Just a note: The retiarius is that effeminate guy with the net and trident who fights from a distance and by running away. The Romans hated those gladiators despite our modern movie makers trying to make them more appealing. Emperor Claudius often had the losing retiarii slowly tortured to death at the end of the games so the Romans could enjoy their agony. All the other options have a sword and shield of some sort and fight in direct combat. The contrarete is the retiarius hunter. That one was always a huge crowd pleaser. One last note: This isn't your typical AirBnB experience. It doesn't include lodging of any sort. The Colosseum is a place of combat, not of rest. By decree of the Emperor, no guest shall stay the night. Here's a little promo video for the games:  Some Romans are not too happy about the games, and a few are actually trying to get it shut down. But it's clear what these angry Romans need: Some bread and circus.

First they get shot at:</p>","Not a great month for the folks at Spirit Airlines. First they get shot at:  ...then they go under (financially speaking): Spirit Airlines, whose approach to selling cheap tickets without amenities earned it fans and detractors, filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday after a string of setbacks, most recently a failure to renegotiate its looming debt. ""Without amenities"" is right. The company is known for cheap flights, which is not a bad thing. They're also known for: Extra fees for everything from checked bags to seat assignmentsBasic seats are uncomfortable and crampedNo in-flight entertainment or Wi-Fi Basic seats are uncomfortable and crampedNo in-flight entertainment or Wi-Fi No in-flight entertainment or Wi-Fi  That's arguably not what drove the company into Chapter 11, however. Cheap, cramped flights are not great, but we can tolerate them if the planes are on time and we get where we need to go, which Spirit arguably delivered on. Rather, a number of other factors appear to have driven the filing: The airline, which last reported an annual profit in 2019, has had trouble finding its footing after a federal judge blocked a planned merger with JetBlue Airways in January. Spirit has also struggled to capitalize on the recovery from the pandemic because of intense competition, engine problems and other factors. The company doesn't look to be going anywhere in the near future. It said customers can ""use all tickets, credits and loyalty points as normal,"" while the CEO said its bankruptcy move demonstrates ""a strong vote of confidence in Spirit and our long-term plan."" Though it was originally the butt of many jokes for its stripped-down service, the company drove a lot of change in the industry, as today ""most U.S. airlines offer some version of a no-frills ticket."" The company also ""pressur[ed] others to lower fares,"" driving rates ever-lower in the airline industry.

Since 2019, a number of students and parents at St. Helens High School in Oregon have been complaining about the sexually predatory conduct of at least two teachers on staff. But the district's administration and school board took no action. Now, it seems, the proverbial excrement has hit the fan. Two teachers are in prison, the superintendent has been put on leave by the district, the principal has been put on leave by the district, the school board chair has resigned, and administration had to cancel school because of the large protest staged by parents and teachers.  Perhaps the most detailed picture that has been painted of the perversion happening inside the school came from a former student at the Oregon school who himself now teaches in St. Louis. Doug Weaver published a TikTok video explaining just how bad things were for some students in the district.  Jaw-dropping stuff, to be sure. As Weaver acknowledged, the two predatory teachers, Eric Stearns (46) and the now-retired Mark Collins (64), have been arrested. According to the police report, Stearns was subsequently indicted for seven counts of Sexual Abuse in the Second Degree and one count of Sexual Abuse in the Third Degree. Mark Collins was indicted on two counts of Sexual Abuse in the Second Degree and one count of Attempted Sexual Abuse in the Second Degree. Both Stearns and Collins were lodged at the Columbia County Jail. But if this was all so well known, if it was apparently the worst kept secret in St. Helens, Oregon, a sane person is left to ask a number of questions that demand answers: Why were these teachers still in the classroom? Why did legal action take so long to happen? Why didn't the principal or superintendent of the corporation move to protect the kids in their care? And if they wouldn't do it for whatever reason, why didn't the school board force their hand? Those were all questions that a posse of teachers, students, and parents showed up to ask at the most recent St. Helens school board meeting.     News reports indicate that Mr. Stearns plans to fight the charges against him, and will be filing a civil case against what his attorney calls, ""haphazard law enforcement.""

And so it shouldn't surprise you when I tell you the Democrats in that state are currently drafting a bill which would make being homeless a human right.   Washington Democrats are preparing a bill that would establish homelessness as a protected class, legalize homeless encampments and RVs statewide and strip cities of the authority to enforce restrictions on homelessness, including bans on encampments, according to a draft of the legislation obtained by 'The Jason Rantz Show' on KTTH. If enacted, the bill would elevate being homeless to the status of a civil right in Washington. Essentially, the bill, drafted by Rep. Mia Gregerson, who is, of course, a Democrat, would give homeless people the right to live in public places as long as they are doing so in a ""nonobstructive"" fashion. They can also sleep in their cars as long as they're parked legally. The bill also makes it illegal for governments to enforce encampment bans. I'll quote straight from the bill: People experiencing homelessness enjoy constitutional and civil rights, including the right to survive, regardless of their housing status. Accordingly:(1) Discrimination based on housing status is prohibited;(2) Every person experiencing homelessness and who has no reasonable alternative but to survive in public space has the following rights in public space without being subject to criminal or civil penalties or harassment by law enforcement, public or private security personnel, or any agents of any public-private partnership established under any state or local law:(a) The right to survive in a nonobstructive manner;(b) The right to shelter oneself from the elements in a nonobstructive manner;(c) The right to eat, share, accept, or give food in any public space where food is not prohibited;(d) The right to occupy a motor vehicle or recreational vehicle, provided that the vehicle or recreational vehicle is legally parked on public property or parked on private property with the permission of the property owner; and(e) The right to a reasonable expectation of privacy in one's personal property.(3) A person experiencing homelessness may not be subject to criminal or civil penalties or harassment by law enforcement, public or private security personnel, or any agents of any public-private partnership established under any state or local law, for surviving in public space when that person has no reasonable alternative but to survive in public space and existing shelter facilities within the local government's jurisdiction are inadequate in number or are functionally inaccessible. (1) Discrimination based on housing status is prohibited;(2) Every person experiencing homelessness and who has no reasonable alternative but to survive in public space has the following rights in public space without being subject to criminal or civil penalties or harassment by law enforcement, public or private security personnel, or any agents of any public-private partnership established under any state or local law:(a) The right to survive in a nonobstructive manner;(b) The right to shelter oneself from the elements in a nonobstructive manner;(c) The right to eat, share, accept, or give food in any public space where food is not prohibited;(d) The right to occupy a motor vehicle or recreational vehicle, provided that the vehicle or recreational vehicle is legally parked on public property or parked on private property with the permission of the property owner; and(e) The right to a reasonable expectation of privacy in one's personal property.(3) A person experiencing homelessness may not be subject to criminal or civil penalties or harassment by law enforcement, public or private security personnel, or any agents of any public-private partnership established under any state or local law, for surviving in public space when that person has no reasonable alternative but to survive in public space and existing shelter facilities within the local government's jurisdiction are inadequate in number or are functionally inaccessible.

From that CNBC link: Kyiv appeared to waste little time after reportedly being given the go-ahead by Washington Sunday to use U.S.-made ATACMS missiles against specific targets. Ukrainian news outlets reported early Tuesday that the missiles had been used to attack a Russian military facility in the Bryansk border region.  Russia then confirmed the attack, with the Ministry of Defense stating that Ukrainian forces had 'struck a facility in [the] Bryansk region' using six ballistic, American-made ATACMS missiles. The ministry claimed air defense missile systems had shot down five of the missiles, and damaged another. Russia said there was no damage or casualties caused by the missiles (that's the only answer we were going to get either way). In response, Putin signed an ""updated nuclear doctrine"" that changes the country's policy regarding the use of nuclear weapons. The doctrine also stated that Russia may use nuclear weapons in the event of a critical threat to its sovereignty and territorial integrity (and that of its ally, Belarus) and that the launch of ballistic missiles against Russia would be seen among the conditions that could warrant a response using nuclear weapons. Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov was asked on Tuesday if the use of American missiles would meet the threshold for a nuclear response.Here was his reply:​You will be able to read the paragraphs yourself, but in general it also states that the Russian Federation reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in the event of aggression with the use of conventional weapons against it or the Republic of Belarus, which creates a critical threat to sovereignty or territorial integrity. Aggression against the Russian Federation by any non-nuclear state with the participation or support of a nuclear state is considered a joint attack.A reminder of what Donald Trump wants:So again, I have to ask: How far do you think Joe Biden and the ""we've got to defeat Russia at all costs"" crowd will go before Donald Trump gets back into office?

	Come get these winners.","In many circles, Week 11 has been described as the best slate of games so far when it comes to the 2024 NFL season, and it is hard to argue. There was entertaining action in every window other than Monday night and, on a week-to-week basis, that is not always the case. In this space, we also found success with a third winning week in the last four. Granted, it came with a hilarious investment in a team that lost by approximately 100, but a loss counts the same by a half-point or 30 points, right? Before we get to the Week 12 schedule and five picks against the spread, let’s take a look at the (unfortunately negative) season-long progress. Come get these winners. We struck with our principles last Thursday to success, and we’re doing it again here. It is unsightly to bet on Cleveland right now, and I won’t argue that. The Browns are 2-8 and having a season from hell. With that said, the market is too high on the Steelers in this spot. Pittsburgh continues to be unreal in an underdog role under Mike Tomlin, but the Steelers are 33-41-3 (44.6%) as a road favorite under his watch. Do I think the games from 2008 impact this week? I do not, but I can’t get this to more than a field goal on a short week in Cleveland. Let’s go Browns. This is a space that prides itself on taking the stands that few others will take. This is another example. The Lions are dominating everyone. We found that out the hard way last week. But this is really a 7.5-point number on the road? Detroit’s ATS record (8-2) is stellar but things have gone too far. Or maybe we’ll lose this bet and swear off fading the Lions for a while. Either way, I like the home dog here. Our Wong teaser of the week is here. Tennessee’s defense has been spunky this season, but the Titans still have Will Levis and a rudderless offense that gives us hope in the Texans at home with the move through key numbers. On the other side, I’ve actually been a touch low on the 49ers compared to the market this season and, while that has been the right stance on the whole, this is a principle play to take it up to 8.5. Remember when the 12th Man meant something? Well, the Seahawks are 2-4 at home this season, and the word is out on that. While I am not suggesting that home-field advantage is the reason for this play, I like Seattle to keep it going after a strong performance in an upset over San Francisco a week ago. Arizona is off a bye and on a four-game winning streak but, no matter what I do, I can’t get this to a pick’em, much less than +1 available at BetMGM right now. I don’t give out many road favorites, but I tend to make exceptions for when the Chargers are the home team. Granted, a lot has changed in Los Angeles, with Jim Harbaugh immediately turning the Chargers into a very competent and effective outfit. However, the Chargers still might have the least significant home-field advantage in the NFL, and Baltimore is at least slightly undervalued here coming off a loss to Pittsburgh."

	Charles Barkley wasn't gonna let the night go by without making a joke about their upcoming move to ESPN next fall.","Over the weekend, some exciting news broke regarding the future of Inside the NBA, as ESPN is adding the beloved studio show as part of a new licensing agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery. The show will continue to be produced independently by TNT Sports from their Atlanta studio, with Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, Shaquille O’Neal, and Charles Barkley remaining employees of WBD — well, so long as they get Shaq’s contract done — but they’ll be part of ESPN and ABC’s coverage of the Playoffs, Finals, and major regular season games. That was stunning news to many fans, largely because ESPN has been trying to figure out how to create a competitor to Inside for decades to no avail, and the fellas have never been afraid of making fun of ESPN — particularly Barkley. Chuck has taken ESPN and their analysts to tasks a number of times over the years, and while I doubt that stops in total, he knows times are changing soon for he and the rest of the fellas. On Tuesday night, after the Spurs beat the Thunder in the late game on TNT, Chuck couldn’t help but crack a joke to Kenny Smith that they’ve gotta “go back to kissing ass” ahead of their move to ESPN next fall.  No one has been more outspoken over the last six months about the contract negotiations with the NBA than Barkley, sometimes to the chagrin of his colleagues. He’s been extremely vocal about his frustrations with TNT not keeping NBA rights and has noted his biggest concern is trying to figure out how to keep everyone at TNT employed. That mission seems to have been accomplished with this latest news of the show being licensed to ESPN, and he showed still going to be Chuck and poke fun at the new arrangement."

	Another case of Vince Staples, being Vince Staples.","Vince Staples isn’t afraid to voice his opinion regarding anything and anyone. No one is exempt from the “Little Homies” rapper’s blunt takes—not fellow musicians, fans, or content creators. Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum is the latest person to feel his humorous wrath. Today (November 19), Vince Staples and Jayson Tatum came face-to-face in a new commercial for the Jordan brand (viewable here). Instead of using his beloved lyricism on full display, Vince channelled his words for another reason. As highlights of Tatum’s Championship season took over the screen, Vince gave Tatum a piece of his mind. “What type of dude is Jayson Tatum,” asked Vince. “The type of dude who’d crush a team and then say some cold sh*t like, ‘We just played our game and the rest took care of itself.'” As Vince pointed out, Tatum is a many of few words but when he does speak out against his opponents it cuts deeps. However, Tatum manages to keep a cool head or so Vince argued, saying: “The type that have a whole city and internet, booing him. And he’s just smiling.” Before the clip ends, Vince has one more grievance to air as a long-suffering Los Angeles Clippers fan. “That sh*t really message me up, man,” he said.  Unfazed by it all, Tatum laughs off Vince’s monologue. In Tatum’s eyes, it doesn’t matter who hates him because his partner, singer Ella Mai and their child provides more than enough love to make up for it."

	After a loss dropped the Sixers to 2-11 on the year, the team held a players-only meeting where Maxey voiced a gripe about Embiid.","The Philadelphia 76ers have been the biggest disappointment in the NBA to start the 2024-25 season. While there have been injuries to Joel Embiid, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey that have prevented them from taking the court as a trio, Philadelphia has gotten off to a 2-11 start this year, which is tied with the openly tanking Washington Wizards for the worst record in the NBA. For a team that entered this season with championship aspirations, it’s pretty shocking to see just how bad Philly has been. And following a 106-89 loss to the Miami Heat on Monday night where the team blew a 19-point lead, Kyle Lowry called for a players-only meeting, according to Shams Charania of ESPN. And per Charania, the meeting included Maxey confronting Embiid with a message that the former NBA MVP “accepted.” Via ESPN: In the meeting, Maxey challenged Embiid to be on time to team activities, calling out the former league MVP about being late “for everything” and how it impacts the locker room, from other players to the coaching staff, sources briefed on the meeting told ESPN. Maxey and Embiid have a close friendship and have a history of holding each other accountable, according to those around the team. Embiid was listed as doubtful to play against the Heat with an illness, but eventually took the floor and struggled, going for 11 points, eight rebounds, and five assists in 31 minutes of work on 5-for-11 shooting from the field. Maxey, meanwhile, was unable to play, as he’s working his way back from a hamstring strain he suffered earlier this season. Charania also noted that Sixers players addressed head coach Nick Nurse, saying that “they want to be coached harder, and coaches in turn said they want players to practice with purpose and attention to detail.”"

	Powerhouse Hobbs has a list of aspirations after spending seven months out with a knee injury.","Powerhouse Hobbs wasn’t sure how fans were going to receive his return. Recency bias is a real thing in the wrestling industry, and any extended absence comes with the reality that you’re out of sight and out of mind.  When he walked out of the tunnel to the roar of the live audience as Ricochet’s surprise partner just two weeks ago, any anxiety over what the reaction would look like evaporated. For Hobbs, it was like he’d never left.  “It was one of those things where it let me know how special this business is, how special the fans are,” Hobbs tells Uproxx Sports. “When it comes down to it, we do it for them. We do it for their entertainment. We do it for their reactions. We do it because we love it. We all love to go out and perform in front of them. But then when they go ahead and give you that love back, man, it makes you want to go even harder.” As smooth as he looked in his return to the ring, the prior seven months were anything but easy.  He ruptured his patella tendon in a main event match, going from the high of being prominently featured on television on Wednesday night to having surgery the following Monday. The next day, he flew across the country, and just a week later was back in the gym determined to return stronger.  “I probably had a few days to be in my feelings and soak everything in,” Hobbs says. “But my main objective was to come back better than when I left. This recovery, I would get up at five, eat, in the gym by six on one leg for two hours, come home, eat, then off to PT for three hours a day, Monday through Saturday.” There were moments Hobbs says he felt helpless. He couldn’t bend his knee at all. He remembers the emotions of asking his three-year-old daughter to help take his sock off, asking his son to help him stand, or making sure he had something to hold onto so he didn’t fall in the shower.  The experience, Hobbs says, humbled him. Small accomplishments compounded. A strong support system that included conversations with wrestling legends like Sting, Mark Henry, and Billy Gunn helped him prepare for the ups, downs, and evolving mindset in how he’d navigate his return.  In his time away, Hobbs focused on the things he could control and put extra effort on how he could elevate other areas of his game.  “I got a lot of promos just sitting on the couch watching wrestling. I was very angry, not being able to do what I want to do,” Hobbs says.  Practicing patience is something Hobbs has had to learn over his four years in AEW, and especially now in what’s essentially a fresh start. You can’t manufacture many of the special moments in wrestling — they’re going to happen organically, like the infamous Meat chants last year. “You’re going to hear the people tell you what they want,” Hobbs says, “so it’s on you to capitalize on it.” Hearing the crowd react to his return, and feeding off their energy over the past few weeks, should give him confidence that he’ll be able to be successful in his career refresh. He created a list of aspirations during his time away, including another singles championship reign.  There’s no order to how he goes about checking off his accomplishments, but admits the primary focus is a “longer, stronger reign.” His path to wearing championship gold again comes with confidence, believing in himself, and turning the volume up on his character.  Before his injury, Hobbs says there were discussions about how he could start bringing who he is in real life to his character. Now that he’s had time to sit and stew on the future, he’s ready to show the world who he is.  “I’m going to start bringing my life into my character, the things that I hate, the things that I love. I’m just gonna show everyone how much more intense I can be, how destructive I can be, how I don’t give a shit at times who’s in my way,” Hobbs says. “In the end, this business, there only can be one. It’s going to come to a point where I’m going to show everybody that it’s all about me. They’re either going to be with me or be against me. It doesn’t matter. They boo me, I’m just going to start tearing everything up in front of them.  “And I think that’s what wrestling is missing a little bit. That one guy who makes people afraid, but they want to see him kick someone’s ass. I feel that it’s time to bring it out.”"

	Jake Paul's boxing fit in his match against Mike Tyson was one of the most expensive in boxing history. Here is what he wore.","Over the weekend, social media sensation turned legit boxer Jake Paul faced off against the mighty (if aged) Mike Tyson, attracting the eyes of 60 million viewers for what was undoubtedly the fight of the year. The two fighters, aged 27 and 58 respectively, lasted the entire eight rounds, with Paul ultimately besting Iron Mike, crushing the hearts of pretty much everybody over the age of 30. But we’re not here to talk about the fight, we’re here to talk about Jake Paul’s fit, which Paul revealed on the “Talk Tuah” podcast was worth over $1 million. “This outfit that I’ve made for the fight is the most expensive fight outfit in the history of boxing,” said Paul. The fit was a custom piece designed by Dominic Ciambrone’s Surgeon Studios and featured metallic silver shorts with diamond tennis chains, and a graphic of Mr. Monopoly holding a money bag. The full outfit was completed with a jewel-encrusted gray jacket prominently featuring the logo of Paul’s new body care line W. It’s flashy, brash, and eye-catching, a perfect reflection of Paul’s whole vibe. Love him or hate him, you can’t deny that this fight helped to solidify Paul’s status as a pop culture icon of the 2020s, and despite Tyson’s advanced age, being able to go toe to toe with the GOAT and come out on top is no easy feat. This is also a big win for Ciambrone, who we’ve been keeping a close eye on since the days he was simply referred to as the Shoe Surgeon. Check out the fit in action below."

	Tyrese Haliburton took over the NBA Cup last year. Which young, up-and-coming player is most likely to do that this year?","Tyrese Haliburton entered last season in an interesting spot. Yes, everyone knew he was a really good, really talented basketball player — he even made it onto the 2023 All-Star team. And yet, Haliburton was mostly a guy who did some cool things on a not great Indiana Pacers team, which came on the heels of him doing some cool things as a rookie and a second-year player on a not great Sacramento Kings team. And then, last season happened. More specifically, the inaugural NBA Cup (known at the time as the In-Season Tournament) happened, and Haliburton was the driving force behind an upstart Pacers team that took it to everyone and made the championship game, where they fell to the Los Angeles Lakers. It was the exact sort of springboard to stardom that a cup competition should provide, as a young, up-and-coming team led by a young, up-and-coming star went on a run and nearly won the whole thing. Haliburton averaged 26.7 points, 13.3 assists, and 4.9 rebounds in seven tournament games, and while he cooled off a bit as the year went on due to lingering injury issues, he was still able to use his NBA Cup performance as a springboard to an All-NBA Third Team nod and an appearance in the Eastern Conference Finals. Now, with this season’s NBA Cup underway, it’s worth wondering which young star is going to use this edition of the tournament as a way to assert themselves as a superstar, and today, we wanted to look at some of the frontrunners to do just that on teams that have already gotten off to good starts in Cup play. The Rockets have been one of the best up-and-coming teams in the league so far this season, and while you can toss a few guys in as their answer (Jalen Green would be a good fit here, too), we’ll go with Sengun, who was great last year but was sidelined with an injury during their big run later in the calendar. Anyone who watches Houston knows that Sengun is good, but ever since they traded James Harden, the Rockets haven’t gotten a ton of attention. The NBA Cup is a chance to change that — they steamrolled the Clippers in their Group A opener last week — and if they can win their game in Minnesota next week, they’re going to be the overwhelming favorites to move out of their group. Add in that Houston has a net rating of +12.98 when Sengun is on the floor this season and while depth is one of their biggest strengths, we’re willing to bet that he’s the guy who will carry them to Cup wins if they come. Atlanta beating the Celtics in their NBA Cup opener was a shock, and they followed it up with a win over Washington in their second game. The craziest thing about the game against Boston: Trae Young didn’t play, as Daniels was a two-way menace (28 points, seven assists, six steals) and Johnson stuffed the stat sheet (18 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists, three steals, a block). Young is, obviously, the face in Atlanta, but on the heels of the Dejounte Murray trade, there’s space for someone to blossom into his star running mate. Daniels’ ability to just ruin opposing backcourts and Johnson’s ability to do anything Atlanta needs on a given night both fit well alongside him, and they’ll both have to be great if the Hawks go on a run. Things have been completely dire in Detroit for a while now, and as a result, Cunningham hasn’t lived up to his billing as a No. 1 overall pick. But things are starting to change — Detroit is 2-0 in Cup play, with Cunningham going for 21 points, nine assists, seven rebounds, and two blocks against the Heat before putting up a 21-point, 10-rebounds, 10-assist triple-double with five steals and a block against the Wizards. He has to cut down on his turnovers, but he’s spearheading the Pistons as they try to take a big step forward under JB Bickerstaff. So far, so good, and if Detroit goes on an improbable NBA Cup run, it’ll be because Cunningham took a big leap towards becoming the face of the franchise the Pistons have craved for years. The most likely option to go on a Haliburton-esque run. Orlando is 2-0 with wins over Charlotte and Philly, even though Paolo Banchero is out with a torn oblique. The ball has been in Wagner’s hands a lot as a result, and the decision has paid off in a big way. He’s starting to find his shot after he couldn’t hit anything last season, while he looks really comfortable as a scorer and a facilitator. The Magic being good without Banchero is only possible because of Wagner, and a trip to the knockout rounds of the NBA Cup is within reach — their game in New York on Dec. 3 looms large, and we cannot wait to see what Wagner does under the bright lights of Madison Square Garden. You might have heard this by now: The Cavs are the best team in basketball this year at 15-0, and they won their only NBA Cup game so far against Charlotte. All eyes are on Tuesday night’s trip to Boston to take on the defending champs, which is the exact sort of high-profile stage Cleveland could use to emphatically say they’re championship and NBA Cup contenders. A big reason for the success? Mobley, as the decision to bring Kenny Atkinson on board as head coach has led to him looking more comfortable on offense and his usual brilliant self on defense. He has to continue to do that if the Cavs are going to be championship contenders, and the NBA Cup is a great place for him to show that he’s taken a step forward in his fourth season. If you want, you can also make a case for Darius Garland here, who has been nothing short of spectacular this season and is showing why he’s one of the best young guards in the league. However, Garland has been an All-Star and Donovan Mitchell is a known commodity, so we’ll go with the young big man as the Cav most likely to turn heads.  The Thunder are in a tricky spot due to the injuries suffered by Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein, so it’s possible they are just not big enough to go on an NBA Cup run. If they can, though, our hunch is it’s because of Williams stepping up and being the perfect running mate alongside Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. He keeps getting better and better the more experience he gets under his belt, and so far this season, Williams has done that again, as he’s putting up career-best marks in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks per game. He won’t unseat Shai as the man in Oklahoma City any time soon, but the Thunder are the exact sort of team that can use the NBA Cup as a chance to announce their arrival to the rest of the league. Williams can do the same."

We pick up the HBCU Homecoming series with only a day left before Director of Bands Chancellor Mills gets to prove himself in his first year in the position with the help of more than 100 band members and his staff. “It’s all in the planning, first and foremost,” Mills said in preparation for the event. “We don’t want to throw anything together and just put it out there; it’s huge this year.” As Mills said, the planning is critical, as the pressure of the occasion couldn’t be any higher, with current students and alumni all expecting a great show. “This performance is just going to signify where this program is,” said Mills. “It’s going to dictate how we’re going to move for the next 3-5 years. It’s significant in terms of what we want to give back to our community.” Fortunately, the hard work pays off as the band comes out at halftime to give the crowd their best with renditions of hip-hop classics produced by Just Blaze, including Joe Budden’s “Pump it Up” and “What We Do” by Freeway, who appeared to perform the song in-person. “I’ve had my songs played at a million sporting events,” Blaze said of the performance. “This is just kind of a great add-on to that part of the legacy. It sounded amazing.” As Blaze says in the episode, the party was far from over after the performance. Check out additional footage from the band’s night performance and more to see how the performance was received."

	Apparently, Shaq is a little upset with things, although he would like to remain on the show.","Basketball fans got some pretty monumental news over the weekend. As part of the agreement that will keep Warner Bros. Discovery as one of the league’s broadcast partners during its upcoming media right deal, Turner Sports will continue to produce “Inside the NBA” but license the show out to ESPN, which will air it going forward. The deal officially got announced on Monday, and there are some pretty big questions that continue to hang over the agreement that ESPN and Turner will have to get sorted out between now and the start of the 2025-26 season. As it turns out, there’s one especially big one that hangs over the deal, as Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated reported that Shaquille O’Neal is out of a contract on July 1, 2025. And apparently, there’s a bit of tension on the Hall of Fame inductee’s side of things right now. While sources say Shaq wants to remain on the show, he’s frustrated that there has been congratulations and press releases hyping that Inside the NBA is remaining the same while he is currently not under contract to be with the company next season. As Traina noted, Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, and Charles Barkley all do other things for Turner, so their deals are different from Shaq’s, who exclusively does NBA work for the network. It goes without saying, but Inside without Shaq would not feel the same, although we’re optimistic that Draymond Green joining the show whenever his playing career ends would be a good fill-in for him. Still, whether it’s agreeing to another deal with Turner or working something out with ESPN, here’s hoping that Shaq is at the desk with the rest of the guys when Inside airs on the Worldwide Leader for the first time."

Late on Sunday night, the NFL decided to announce that it has something special up its sleeve for the late afternoon game, as it was revealed that Beyonce will perform at halftime in her hometown.  A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce)  There’s no word on whether the league has a similarly huge name lined up for the early game, but lining up Beyonce — who headlined the Super Bowl halftime show back in 2013 — for a performance during a showcase game like this makes a ton of sense. Of course, there is a potential problem that will be monitored throughout the Christmas Day schedule, as the games will be aired on Netflix, which just struggled mightily with its broadcast of the boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul. Adding Beyonce to what will already be a highly-anticipated NFL game should only bring more eyeballs onto the platform, and there’s going to be a whole lot of interest in whether or not Netflix will be able to keep up with the demand."

	The Wings got the top pick in the 2025 WNBA Draft and will get the chance to draft UConn star Paige Bueckers.","The 2025 WNBA Draft figures to feature some serious talent, headlined by UConn star Paige Bueckers, and that meant Sunday was a big day for the Chicago Sky, Dallas Wings, Los Angeles Sparks, and Washington Mystics, as those four teams were set to learn their fate in the Draft Lottery.  The ping-pong balls fell in favor of the Wings, who will get the opportunity to select Bueckers first overall next spring and figure to create one of the WNBA’s most exciting backcourts immediately with Bueckers joining established Wings star Arike Ogunbowale in Dallas. For the second straight year, the Sparks will hold the No. 2 overall pick and the Sky will pick at No. 3, while the Mystics will have the fourth pick. The fifth pick will go to the expansion Golden State Valkyries, followed by the playoff teams from a year ago — aside from the Aces, who forfeited their draft pick as part of a league punishment.  The 2025 WNBA Draft first round order looks as follows:  1. Dallas Wings
2. Los Angeles Sparks
3. Chicago Sky
4. Washington Mystics
5. Golden State Valkyries
6. Washington Mystics (via the Atlanta Dream)
7. New York Liberty (via the Phoenix Mercury)
8. Indiana Fever
9. Seattle Storm
10. Chicago Sky (via the Connecticut Sun)
11. Minnesota Lynx
12. Phoenix Mercury (via the New York Liberty)  Behind Bueckers, Kiki Iriafen is the presumptive No. 2 prospect in this class, which means she could be making a very short trip from playing college ball at USC this season to pro ball with the Sparks. From there, Azzi Fudd, Olivia Miles, Lauren Betts, and others will be in the mix for picks in the top half of the first round."

	Jon Jones successfully defended his UFC Heavyweight championship at UFC 309 in New York.","Jon Jones (28-1) knocked out Stipe Miocic (20-5) in the third round to retain the heavyweight championship at UFC 309 from Madison Square Garden in New York.  Jones opened with a couple shots up top, a leg kick, and eventually a takedown. On top, Jones worked the ground and pound, refusing to give Miocic any room on the ground in a dominant first round — but while it looked like Jones could have ended it early, Miocic was able to hang on. Miocic opened the second round with a more measured approach, waiting for his own opportunities to attack without being taken down. The former heavyweight champion was relatively flat-footed before opening a more active approach in the third, but as Miocic moved, it was Jones who picked apart Miocic.  Jones hurt Miocic with a big right hand midway through the round, but kept the champ at bay with a combination of his own. Jones hurt Miocic with a spinning back kick to the body, then finished him off with lefts and rights on the ground before the referee stoppage.  Jones’ return to the UFC on Saturday was just his second bout in the heavyweight division. He hadn’t fought since last year, claiming the UFC Heavyweight belt in his debut in the heavyweight division against Ciryl Gane. Jones is arguably the greatest fighter in UFC history, but his background is riddled in controversy amid two victories over another greatest of all-time contender, Daniel Cormier. Miocic hadn’t fought since 2021, when he suffered a second-round knockout at the hands of Francis Ngannou.  Jones as the winner has an interesting path forward. On one hand, the interim champ, Tom Aspinall, is waiting in the wings and ready to prove himself against an all-time great. On the other hand, Alex Pereira seems prepped to climb to the heavyweight division, making possibly two weight jumps in three year as the former middleweight and current light heavyweight champion. Jones hasn’t seemed as interested in Aspinall recently, but opened the door to that fight after the win.  After his loss, Miocic retired from the UFC."

	Chuck, Shaq, Kenny, and Ernie will continue covering NBA games in 2025, as ESPN will license the show from TNT starting next year.","When TNT Sports lost the rights to the NBA this summer, with the league opting for a three-network deal with ESPN, NBC, and Amazon, the biggest question from fans was what would the future look like for ‘Inside the NBA’. After initially sounding as though it would end after this season, TNT was able to get Charles Barkley to agree to stick around for the remainder of his contract, with plans to continue the show in some capacity.  Now, we know what that will be, and instead of TNT airing the fellas talking about various sports (as was rumored at one point), they will continue to cover the NBA as part of ESPN’s NBA coverage in a unique licensing deal between Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery. According to the Wall Street Journal and Andrew Marchand of The Athletic, the deal will see TNT Sports continue producing the show, but it will air on ESPN.  Separately, Warner Bros. Discovery struck a deal with Disney to license the TNT show “Inside the NBA” to ESPN and ABC starting next season, according to the people familiar with the matter. The show, which features the former players Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal, has an enthusiastic and large following. The show will air throughout the course of the season. This all happens alongside a larger settlement between the NBA and WBD, with Bleacher Report and House of Highlights maintaining rights to NBA videos. That is all excellent news for those at TNT Sports and those outlets, and sources inside TNT Sports tell Dime that they are “considering it a best case scenario” after losing NBA game broadcasts. [UPDATE: This post previously stated WBD would continue operating NBA TV and the league’s digital platforms, as was reported by the WSJ, but that was incorrect. NBA Digital and WBD will continue their current relationship but will not be operated by WBD (as is the current structure), while NBA TV will not be operated by WBD in the future.] For NBA fans the biggest news is that Charles Barkley, Shaquille O’Neal, Kenny Smith, and Ernie Johnson will still be on our televisions — one would assume from Studio J in Atlanta still if TNT is producing it — each week during the NBA season. One would expect they’ll move from their Thursday slot to Wednesday for ESPN’s biggest night of games — as the other options are Friday and Sunday and I have a hard time imagining them moving to either of those. The move allows the best show to continue without any changes to talent in front of or behind the camera, which is particularly important, and one would think if ESPN is adding the show they will understand what makes it so good and give it the kind of space and time it deserves, rather than what they currently do with their studio offering. It remains to be seen what happens with NBA Countdown, as they’ll still need to have something for those Friday and Sunday games, but may shake up their main crew with the Inside fellas becoming their A-crew and Finals team."

	The NBA has big plans for how it wants to build on 2024's shooting competition between Steph Curry and Sabrina Ionescu.","The NBA struck gold at All-Star weekend in 2024. While the game itself was bad enough that the league is considering a major shake-up in its format and the Dunk Contest was a dud, a shooting contest between Steph Curry and Sabrina Ionescu injected a whole lot of excitement into the festivities on Saturday night — Curry was able to win, but it was awfully close. With the 2025 edition of the All-Star Game taking place in the Chase Center, it would make a ton of sense for the league to run back a Steph vs. Sabrina shootout. According to Shams Charania of ESPN, that is, indeed in the works, but there’s a catch: They may not be the only NBA and WNBA players involved. Curry and WNBA star Sabrina Ionescu of the New York Liberty participated in the first NBA versus WNBA 3-point challenge at All-Star Saturday night this February in Indianapolis. Curry and Ionescu are in strong conversations to return in a variation of the shootout, which could include other NBA and WNBA players such as Klay Thompson of the Dallas Mavericks and Caitlin Clark of the Indiana Fever, sources said. Expanding on the competition and including Thompson and Clark always made far too much sense, so it’s good to see that the NBA might do something that would obviously be a huge draw."

	The NBA is considering a shakeup to make the All-Star Game a 4-team tournament like Rising Stars -- and include the Rising Stars winners.","The last really good NBA All-Star Game was in 2020, which was both the first year of the Elam Ending format and just a few weeks after Kobe Bryant’s tragic death. Players took the game more seriously than we’ve seen in quite some time, as it was a league-wide celebration of the Lakers legend, but since then the game has fallen back into old habits of being a glorified pickup run with barely a hint of defense being played.  That has led to fans tuning out and TV networks being upset, and Adam Silver seemed like a broken man after last year’s game was the highest scoring in history, handing Giannis and the East the All-Star Game trophy with the glowing praise of “you scored the most points. Well, congratulations.” The truth is, the All-Star Game just isn’t important enough for players to go all-out, especially with how much money is at stake for them nowadays. It’s no longer the biggest national stage some of them will get to show out and build their profile, and the result is a bunch of guys trying not to get hurt while producing a few highlights.  For that reason, the league needs to get creative. We offered our thoughts on what that should look like last year, as they’ve bounced back-and-forth between formats and how they pick teams to varying degrees of success. This year we might see a significant change to the format, as ESPN’s Shams Charania brought word that the league is in deep discussions on a new format that would be similar what they did with the Rising Stars Game, breaking the All-Star rosters into 4 teams and having them play a semifinal game and then the winners of those playing in the final. The teams would be 3 teams of 8 All-Stars and the winning team of the Rising Stars Challenge from Friday. Charania highlights how discussions around this format started at Summer League and have included league personnel, team executives, players (including Stephen Curry), and coaches, with significant momentum towards being adopted for the 2025 game in San Francisco. At the very least, you could bet that whatever team of All-Stars got matched up with the Rising Stars winners would likely have a little more juice to not lose, which would yield the intended results of raising the level of competition.  I think anything would be an improvement over a regular four-quarter game, and the Rising Stars games have been improved as a result of this format change. Even if they aren’t suddenly the greatest basketball games in history, they move quicker and when it’s close late the competitive juices get flowing in a way we don’t see often in the current All-Star format."
Sports – UPROXX,It Is Silly That Nikola Jokic Has Somehow Gotten Better To Start The 2024-25 Season,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/nikola-jokic-start-2024-25-nba-season-denver-nuggets/,"Fri, 15 Nov 2024 21:41:00 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	Nikola Jokic entered this season as an all-time great already. Somehow, someway, he keeps getting better.","There’s this fun thing I like to do sometimes that I affectionately call the Barry Bonds game. How it works: You go onto baseball-reference, pull up the page for the legendary San Francisco Giants slugger, and just look at how ridiculous it was that Bonds was able to put up the numbers he did during his prime. Yes, steroids, I know, but even with that caveat, individual players are not supposed to break their sport the way that Barry Bonds was able to break the game of baseball. We’re not fully there yet, but going onto Nikola Jokic‘s basketball-reference page is getting to a similarly very silly point. Ever since becoming the no-doubt cornerstone of the Denver Nuggets back in 2018-19, Jokic has consistently put up some of the wildest numbers in the league. His last four years feature three MVPs and a second-place finish while averaging 26.1 points, 12.2 rebounds, 8.7 assists, and 1.4 steals in 34.1 minutes per game while shooting 58.8 percent from the field and 36.4 percent from three. The advanced stats especially love him — scroll on down to the “Advanced” section, a lot of stuff is bold (led the league) and a few things are gold (all-time career marks). There is no one quite like Jokic, and there has never been anyone quite like Jokic. His career True Shooting percentage is third in league history, behind only Rudy Gobert and DeAndre Jordan, while attempting 1,942 more three-pointers than those two combined. His career total rebound percentage is 15th, right in between ABA legend Mel Daniels and Marcus Camby. He’s 25th all time in assist percentage — the three names directly behind him are Ja Morant, Ricky Rubio, and LeBron James. The dude just has his fingerprints all over games in a way that no one has ever consistently matched. I say all of that to say this: Somehow, someway, on a team that needs him more than ever (which says a lot as the entire franchise is built around having him), Jokic has raised his game through the first stretch of the 2024-25 season. This should not be possible. It’s not even like he’s suddenly adding something new to his bag of tricks, he’s just better than ever at being Nikola Jokic. Small sample size caveats are prominent here, but here’s some stuff to consider: Points per game: 29.7 (fifth in the NBA, his current career-high is 27.1 PPG)
Rebounds per game: 13.7 (leads the NBA, current career-high is 13.8 RPG)
Assists per game: 11.7 (leads the NBA, current career-high is 9.8 APG)
Steals per game: 1.7 (t-9th in the NBA, current career-high is 1.7 SPG) The only players to ever average a triple-double over a full season, of course, are Oscar Robertson (once) and Russell Westbrook (four times). Neither of them, in any of their triple-double seasons, were in the same galaxy as Jokic’s current True Shooting percentage of 66.7 percent — both guys, funny enough, posted a TS% of 55.4 percent in their most efficient season with a triple-double. And all of the advanced stats that tend to show that Jokic is a marvel (PER, win shares per 48 minutes, box plus/minus) are outrageous — if the season ended today, he’d post the highest single-season PER (33.31) of all-time, the highest BPM (15.02) of all-time, and the fourth-highest WS/48 of all-time behind some guys named Kareem and Wilt. So, yeah, Jokic is a joke, the single best basketball player in the world today and the guy spearheading a Nuggets team with some flaws that came as the result of a talent drain over the last few years to an early 7-3 record and, as of this writing, the longest-active winning streak (five games) in the Western Conference. And here’s the funny thing: If Denver did not have Jokic playing like this, they would be in some serious trouble. Have a look at how dire things get when he is not on the floor, via PBP Stats: There is a reason why, when asked what the ideal number of minutes is for Jokic to be on the floor for the Nuggets, Michael Malone said “48.” We’ve seen plenty of teams over the years be totally helpless when the sun around which everything revolves goes to the bench — LeBron’s teams in his prime were famously horrendous when he would sit, the Sixers have an organizational commitment to being awful without Joel Embiid, etc. — but seeing as how Jokic is either scoring or assisting on nearly half of all the points that Denver scores, well, it’s pretty important that he never comes off the floor. That’ll have to change at some point (well, probably), but Jokic playing like this means it’s easier for the Nuggets to slowly bring along their young guys who have to take on bigger roles this season — although it must be said that Christian Braun has impressed as the de facto Kentavious Caldwell-Pope replacement. They can also afford to be patient with Jamal Murray, who still hasn’t quite looked like himself on the heels of a pretty nasty run of injuries that made his postseason and Olympic efforts hard to watch at times, but just got paid in a big way and absolutely has to get on track. Of course, at some point, Denver is going to need to totally round into form, even if there are some really encouraging signs beyond Jokic. Aaron Gordon has been awesome so far this year when healthy, while Michael Porter Jr. continues to just do his thing as a huge dude who can shoot the hell out of the basketball. When 75 percent of the core your team is built around is playing at a high level from the start of the year — and that final member of your core has a reputation for saving his best for when the lights get brighter — you’re usually in a pretty good spot. There are still big picture questions that can only be answered when the playoffs roll around, which is the curse of being a team with title-or-bust aspirations. In the meantime, all anyone can really do is sit back, watch, and marvel at the spectacle that is Nikola Jokic, the best player in the world at the very height of his powers, someone who keeps finding ways to break the game of basketball, and an all-time great who stands shoulder-to-shoulder alongside the greatest players to ever set foot on the hardwood. And the scary part? As the early portion of this season has shown, if anything, he’s only getting better."

	'We’re nothing. We’re just dead. We’re dust.'","Tonight, November 15, is the much-publicized boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul. Ahead of the fight, which will stream on Netflix, Iron Mike was asked by internet-famous teen reporter Jazlyn Guerra, a.k.a. Jazzy’s World TV, for his thoughts on legacy. He took it very seriously.   “Well, I don’t know. I don’t believe in the word ‘legacy,'” Tyson replied. “I just think that’s another word for ego. Legacy doesn’t mean nothing. That’s just some word everybody grabbed onto. Someone said that word, and everyone grabbed on the words, and now it’s used every five seconds. It means absolutely nothing to me. I’m just passing through. I’mma die, and it’s gonna be over. Who cares about legacy after that?”  Tyson somehow wasn’t done. “What a big ego,” he continued. “So I’mma die. I want people to think that I’m this, I’m great. I’m, no. We’re nothing. We’re just dead. We’re dust. We’re absolutely nothing. Our legacy is nothing.” Guerra responded to Tyson’s stream-of-consciousness existentialism with a polite “thank you so much for sharing that,” but 50 Cent had another takeaway. “G*ddam it! Mike ya scaring the kids, WTF chill,” the rapper wrote on X. “Note to self, keep the kids away from Mike.”  You can watch the video here.

	This year's NBA City Edition unis were officially unveiled on Thursday, so we're ranking them from 30 to 1.","The NBA and Nike officially unveiled the 2024-25 City Edition uniforms for all 30 teams on Thursday, and while the designs have been leaked since this summer, I like to wait until we get the official images to rank them. That is because the actual jerseys themselves almost always look better than their 2D mock-ups, which is certainly the case with this year’s crop. The leaks got roasted to no end on social media and while I’m not crazy about this year’s group of uniforms, they aren’t as bad in actuality as the leaks looked.  That said, there are some heaters and some really bad ones, along with a big crop this year of very “meh” looks as it’s fair to wonder if Nike and the teams are running a bit short on ideas — good news guys, at least another 12 years of these! Here we are ranking the uniforms from worst to best, where there’s one that should become part of one team’s permanent look.  NBA
Creating good alternates is hard when you have an iconic jersey set, and that’s the problem the Celtics (and Lakers) run into every year. These are just bad and don’t even seem to be trying to do anything interesting. Wear your normal (and great) uniforms, please.  NBA
Same goes for the Lakers. These are just unbecoming of a once proud franchise.  NBA
I’m honestly kind of stunned they went back to the Heat Culture well again after the reaction to when they did this last year, but it does look a little better on the all red uniform. Still, c’mon guys, stop trying to make this a thing. NBA
On the opposite end of the spectrum from Boston and L.A. is OKC, which has had one uniform in its history that I thought was legitimately good (the 2018 City Edition honoring Oklahoma’s Native American heritage). Everything else has been either “meh” or outright bad. I’ll say this, these aren’t the worst unis they’ve ever had, but I just am not a fan.  NBA
The Pacers have done this look before in black, and it’s just not for me.  NBA
A retro look that just doesn’t really land for me. I will say, I bet the court they have for this color scheme will look great, but I’m just not a big fan of the lettering.  NBA
I wouldn’t call these bad, they just don’t land for me, but that’s also been the case for a number of the Brooklyn City Editions over the years.  NBA
I’m just out on the 5280 thing. I like the mountains on the side and the topographical map thing, and while I think there are better executions, leaning into the rainbow coloring is generally good for Denver. However, I just can’t get on board with the 5280 in place of lettering. NBA
All of the uniforms in this tier have the same issue of not being bad, but also not being particularly inspiring. Dallas’ are particularly plain, which, again, not necessarily bad, but not memorable either.  NBA
I get they’re going for the Chicago musical font here, but it feels like they weren’t willing to go all-in on it and the end result is pretty bland.  NBA
I get what Minnesota’s going for, but I just see an old Windows 98 screensaver in that design.  NBA
They aren’t as bad as the Lakers and Celtics, but they also have a similar problem where their normal uniforms are iconic classics and trying something new often just makes you want them to do what they always do.  NBA
The Magic are at the top of this group by virtue of having the best lettering/logo — the Magic with a star for the A is always great — but Orlando has great uniform looks and this one just falls flat comparatively.  NBA
Like Orlando, Charlotte has some great throwback looks and this just makes me wish they were wearing one of those instead.  NBA
My colleague Mark said the logo looks like it should be for store brand paper towels and I can’t unsee it. I do like that shade of blue though.  NBA
Perfectly fine, even though it’s still a little confusing when the Bucks are wearing all-blue.  NBA
Never seen a more Oklahoma State jersey in my life. Go Pokes.  NBA
I actually kinda like these, but they are giving off strong vibes of made up Houston jerseys for a movie that couldn’t afford NBA licensing.  NBA
If I were to guess, these will be among the most polarizing unis. I dig New Orleans leaning into being a little different and weird, and the herringbone pattern with actual bones certainly does that. They will likely be at the bottom of some folks rankings but I don’t think their standard unis are so good that they can’t get weird and have it work.  NBA
These have grown on me a bit, in part because they at least look like Warriors uniforms — unlike their Michigan/Marquette alternates from a year or two ago. They aren’t the best uniforms in the world, but a solid attempt at playing off something unique to the Bay (the Golden Gate Bridge).  NBA
I really like the District font and this year they put it on a nice color instead of whatever the hell the black and green and orange thing was a year ago. The Wizards won’t be good this year, but I do think they’ll look good in these.  NBA
I like this Spurs font, they’ve done it before but it works for me. I also like this shade of blue. These aren’t as good as their fiesta look in the past, but a solid choice and I just like when the Spurs have a little pop of color.  NBA
I like these, even though I will not immediately spot this color and go “Cavs” in my brain. Part of why these will work is their court that goes with them is phenomenal.  NBA
Another one that gets a big boost from an unbelievably good court design. These play off the old 1995 All-Star logo, and while I’m not crazy about the font, I still dig them. If they incorporated the saguaro cactus into them, they’d be higher.  NBA
The Blazers almost always do a good job with the City edition uni, and this year is another good addition to their rotation. A big part of that is their “Rip City” font just looks good on anything. NBA
The Jazz are finally making the move back to the purple mountains with their full-time uniform set, and this year’s City Edition is a very good version of that.  NBA
The throwback to the Memphis Sounds just looks fantastic. I love that Memphis font and these are going to look fantastic on the floor — even if it’ll take a little adjustment to seeing a team in red and thinking “Grizzlies”.  NBA
The Kings also have another really good throwback look, taking it to the days of the Cincinnati Royals. The royal blue and red just pops, and they didn’t try to do too much with a uniform that doesn’t need much more.  NBA
I’m a sucker for this spectrum Sixers look. I just think it’s so clean and the white edition is even better than the navy look from a couple years back.  NBA
The Vince Carter Raptor doing his legendary between-the-legs dunk is so good and the Raptors need to just make it their permanent logo. These with the purple retro look they brought back this year is a damn-near perfect uniform set and it’s a shame they will move on to something new next season."

	Come get these winners.","Sometimes, you simply want to unplug the season and plug it back in. That is where we are when it comes to NFL handicapping in 2024. After a pair of encouraging weeks, the ugliness returned in Week 10, including a Falcons-Saints game that impossibly stayed under with three missed field goals and other malodies. We won’t be deterred from the goal of righting the ship but, hey, you could also fade these picks if you’re feeling spicy. Before delivering this week’s five-pack, let’s take a look at the carnage in 2024.  Come get these winners. A Thursday night Under? Let’s get back to basics. Washington has been an “over” team to the tune of 7-3 this season, but Philadelphia has been quietly stout on defense in recent weeks. This is, of course, a short week for both teams, and Washington has some injury issues along its offensive line. I tend to think the Commanders defense is a touch undervalued in this spot as well, and this is a favorable price. The Saints got the bounce last week after firing their coach and, with the help of one of the worst kicking performances of the season for Atlanta, New Orleans won a game it shouldn’t have won. That could benefit us this week, as the Browns are underdogs in a spot where they probably shouldn’t be. Let’s ride the Jameis roller coaster and hope it goes well. Detroit is a wagon. They seemingly cover every week and, when they don’t like in Week 10, they somehow win the game despite a million turnovers. With that said, getting a full 14 here on Jacksonville is something I can’t pass on. Trust me, I know how ugly it is. Seattle is healthier and coming off a bye, including the projected return of DK Metcalf. I’ve also been a touch low on San Francisco all season, and I simply can’t get this to 6.5 points, even with McCaffrey back for the 49ers. This teaser happens to involve a pair of prime time games, but I would like it even if it didn’t. Candidly, I love each leg here, with the Bengals more than able to get in the backdoor if things go south at the outset. Houston is on the road, which does scare me a bit, but the situation in Dallas is rather dire, and the Texans may be discounted a bit after a maddening loss to Detroit."

	Giannis got called for a foul despite getting all ball. But fortunately for the Bucks, as Rasheed Wallace once said, ball don't lie.","The Milwaukee Bucks played host to the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night, and while there is still a ton of basketball left to be played this season, you won’t find a more insane final 90 or so seconds of regulation than what we got out of these two Central Division opponents. The two teams traded the lead back and forth, and after a Marcus Sasser three tied things up with just under 30 seconds left, Milwaukee got the ball and had a chance to win. A wide open look by Taurean Prince did not fall, and with a hair over a second left on the clock, Detroit called a timeout, advanced the ball, and tried to replicate the magic it found on a sideline out of bounds play on Tuesday night against Miami. It looked like that was going to happen, as Cade Cunningham lobbed one up to Ron Holland near the rim, but Giannis Antetokounmpo was able to break things up … well, at least it looked like he did, but the referees called a foul that stood after a review even though it really did not look like Giannis fouled Holland at all. However, in the words of the great philosopher Rasheed Wallace, ball don’t lie. Holland stepped up to the charity stripe and missed short twice, which ended up sending the game to overtime. It would’ve been an awfully harsh way for the game to end for Milwaukee, but, again, Sheed’s got us covered here."
Sports – UPROXX,Draymond Green Claims Steph Had Extra Juice For Warriors-Mavs Because Klay ‘Ghosted Him’,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/draymond-green-klay-thompson-ghosted-steph-curry-warriors-mavs/,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 23:16:08 +0000","<div class=""upx-component upx-embed-url""><div class=""embed-holder""></div></div>Steph Curry apparently had a little extra motivation for Klay Thompson's return to the Chase Center.","Klay Thompson made his return to the Chase Center on Tuesday night as a member of the Dallas Mavericks. It went the way that things tend to go when teams travel to take on the Golden State Warriors: Steph Curry did some absolutely ludicrous Steph stuff, and the Warriors went on to pick up a 120-117 win to start their NBA Cup campaign. Curry scored all 12 of the Warriors’ points during a 12-3 run to close out the game, and plenty of people noted that he looked especially fired up after hitting a three with 27 seconds left that essentially iced things. It turns out there’s a reason why: According to Draymond Green, Curry was ghosted by Thompson in the lead-up to the game. “I’m stirring the pot, I pissed Steph off,” Green said on his podcast, which you can watch at the 4:30 mark of the video at the top of this post. “He’s like, ‘Yeah, I talked to Klay last night about’ — cause he was supposed to speak before the game. He was like, ‘Yeah I called Raymond and told him I’m not speaking. I just need to lock in on the game, so I ain’t speaking and I talked to Klay about it.’ He tried to check in with Klay about something else, and Klay ghosted him, so he got pissed. And here we go. Locked in.” Steve Kerr said that Curry was supposed to address the crowd before the game, but he and Thompson decided against it, while Green did drop a hint after the game that Thompson isn’t an easy guy to get a hold of when he told the press “You ever try to keep in touch with Klay? It’s very one-sided. The love is there. The relationship is there.”"

	The legendary Spurs coach has been away from the team since Nov. 2.","The San Antonio Spurs have been without the services of legendary head coach Gregg Popovich since the start of November. While the team previously said that Popovich’s absence was due to an illness, on Wednesday afternoon, the Spurs revealed that Popovich suffered what was described as a “mild stroke” ahead of their game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Nov. 2, 2024. “The San Antonio Spurs today announced that Head Coach Gregg Popovich has suffered a mild stroke,” the team said in a statement. “The episode occurred on Nov. 2 at the Frost Bank Center. Popovich, who has already started a rehabilitation program, is expected to make a full recovery. At this point, a timeline for his return to the sidelines has not been determined. During this time, the organization is grateful to the extended community for providing privacy and space to the Popovich family.” Assistant coach Mitch Johnson, who has been part of the Spurs’ famed coaching system since 2016, has filled in for Popovich as he’s been away from the team for the last six games. When asked last week for an update on Popovich, Johnson said that the Hall of Fame coach was “in good spirits,” even though there was no word on when fans could expect to see Popovich back on the sideline. One of the greatest basketball coaches of all time, the 75-year-old Popovich has been at the helm of the Spurs since 1996. He is a 5-time NBA champion, a 3-time Coach of the Year, and is the NBA’s all-time wins leader among coaches."

	Let's be honest, Charles Barkley and Shaq were always going to do this at some point.","It’s been a rough start to the year for the Toronto Raptors. While they were never expected to compete for a championship this year, injuries to a number of key contributors like Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickly have played a big role in the team going 2-10, which is the worst record in the league at this early juncture. A bright spot has been the play of Gradey Dick, the No. 13 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft who is shooting 37.3 percent from three and his upped his scoring to 20.1 points per game. He’s a good player whose last name has led to stuff like this happening, and shockingly, it was not until Tuesday night that the Inside the NBA guys had their inevitable meltdown over him.   A post shared by Dime (@dimemagazine)  “This boy’s ballin right here, y’all,” Charles Barkley told the crew. “I think you pointed that out, Gradey Dick,” Ernie Johnson responded. “I can’t say his name,” Barkley shot back. “I just can’t say his name. I’m not gonna say his name, I don’t give a damn what y’all say around here.” It was right around this point that we got one of the consistently funniest things on Inside: Shaq laughing so hard at something insane that Chuck said that he sounds like he’s furiously trying to clear his throat. Anyway, the fellas kept going down this road for a bit longer, because there was never going to be any stopping this riff once it finally happened. As for how the rest of Dick’s night went, he scored a career-best 32 points with five rebounds and three assists in a 99-85 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks."

	There was some extra juice in the building for Klay Thompson's return to the Bay, and Steph reminded the fans whose house it was late.","The biggest game of the night in a packed slate of NBA Cup games was the Mavs taking on the Warriors in Klay Thompson’s first game back in San Francisco since leaving as a free agent this summer for Dallas.  It was an emotional scene as they played a terrific tribute video and had the crowd in captains hats to honor their former star, but once the game got going there was plenty of juice on both sides in a reunion that wasn’t all happy. The two teams went back and forth, as the stars on both sides all played their roles, with Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving combining for 52 for the Mavs, while Thompson hit 6 threes on his way to 22 points in his return, including a big one late that gave Dallas a five-point lead midway through the fourth quarter.  That lead would get up to seven before Stephen Curry took over for the Warriors, scoring 12 points in the final 3:10 of game time, including a personal 10-0 run (aided by some spectacular defense from Draymond Green) that turned a Golden State deficit into a 4-point Warriors lead. His final bucket of that run was a vintage stepback three-pointer over Dereck Lively II, as he hit the Mavs big man with his signature “night night” celebration, before making a demonstrative declaration to the crowd that “this is my sh*t.”  STEPH CURRY HAS THE LAST 10 WARRIORS POINTS. 10-2 run to put GSW up 4 with under 30 seconds. 🏆 DAL-GSW | West Group C action🏀 #EmiratesNBACup on TNT pic.twitter.com/xNxak7xWr5 — NBA (@NBA) November 13, 2024  The Mavs would hit a three to cut the lead to one, but a pair of Curry free throws and a missed Luka three saw the Warriors win in regulation, 120-117. Curry finished with 37 points in the win, and while it’s clear there’s not actual bad blood between either side in the Splash Bros. breakup, there did seem to be a little extra fire from Curry for a mid-November game to make a statement at home with Klay now on the other side. While the “night night” is nothing new, the jersey popping and yelling “this is my sh*t” was more than we ever see from Curry in a non-playoff environment, and while I am a fan of the NBA Cup and think it brings out more competition in these games, I think this had more to do with who was on the other side than the Cup ramifications of this game."

	Shaq, who is never shy about being brutally honest when modern big men come up, did not mince words about Joel Embiid.","Joel Embiid took the floor for the Philadelphia 76ers for the first time this season on Tuesday night. Embiid, who has spent the start of the year ramping up to play after some knee problems, looked like someone who needs to work off a ton of rust, as he went for 13 points on 2-for-11 shooting with five assists and three rebounds in a 111-99 loss to the New York Knicks. It’s probably safe to assume that Embiid will be fine as long as he can manage whatever is up with his knee, while the Sixers — which find themselves 2-8 at this early juncture — have to get him, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey all healthy and clicking as soon as possible. But even if that happens, Shaquille O’Neal is not optimistic about Philly’s ability to win a ring with Embiid at the center of things, which he expressed at halftime on TNT. “In New York, it’s a tough team to play,” O’Neal said. “But this was the fear I had for Joel Embiid. You announce arrogantly, I’m not playing back-to-backs, Ernie. I’m not injured but I’m sore. I’ll come back when I want to come back. Now, when you say things like that, you’re supposed to come back with extra energy. 0-for-3? I would have been 0-15. But you know what y’all would have said. ‘Hey, Shaq’s not playing well, but he’s playing aggressive.’ The plan that they are having, it’s not working. And not only that, I say this respectfully, Joel Embiid will never win a championship until he gets his mind and his attitude right.” Shaq has essentially staked out a place in the basketball punditry world as the guy who will call out big men when he feels they aren’t living up to what they’re capable of, and clearly, he thinks Embiid is the kind of guy who can lead Philadelphia to a championship. In fairness to Embiid, while he did say he may not play in back-to-backs going forward in an effort to be healthy when the playoffs roll around, he said after the loss to the Knicks that he wants to play in Wednesday’s game against the Cleveland Cavaliers, even if the decision is out of his hands."

	With the game tied in overtime, Miami tried calling a timeout. There was just one problem: They didn't have one available.","The second annual Emirates NBA Cup tipped off on Tuesday night, with a number of teams taking the (very vibrant) floor for the league’s relatively new in-season tournament. In the East Group B, the Detroit Pistons played host to the Miami Heat and looked like they were going to cruise to a win before Miami got hot down the stretch of regulation. With things tied up, the two teams went into overtime, where Miami was able to take a lead with just under two seconds left before things got very, very weird. First, the Pistons drew up a beautiful sideline out of bounds play to get a dunk for Jalen Duren that tied things up. And then, a furious Erik Spoelstra walked onto the court and called a timeout. There was just one problem: Miami didn’t have one, which meant we had a classic Chris Webber situation on our hands — perhaps it was fate that one of Webber’s Fab 5 teammates, Jalen Rose, was in attendance and lost his mind. Malik Bealey stepped up to the free throw line, buried it to put Detroit ahead, then on the ensuing Pistons possession, got fouled one more time with 0.1 seconds left to seal the game. It was, quite frankly, stunning to watch Spoelstra make such a big mistake, but at the very least, we got a really entertaining end to a game that suddenly has some stakes to it because of the NBA Cup."

	Caitlin Clark found a very unique pitfall of fame at The Eras Tour: Getting so many friendship bracelets you start to lose circulation.","Taylor Swift’s “The Eras Tour” has been the biggest show in the world for the past few years, as the tour has had millions of fans pass through the gates at stadiums around the globe. After finishing her international leg of the tour, Swift added another run of U.S. tour dates, which included recently playing three nights in Indianapolis at the start of November.  In attendance for those shows was the biggest sports star in the city at present, as Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark wasn’t about to miss a chance to see her favorite artist play shows in her new home city. The only problem for Caitlin at the Eras Tour was that she’s too popular in Indianapolis, which meant she was being constantly given friendship bracelets from other Swifties. That’s a very nice problem to have, but in her effort to wear every one she was given, it started to create an issue, as she explained at the Women’s Leadership Summit.  “Taylor Swift, I just went two nights in a row in Indianapolis. I’ve been three times,” Clark said. “I had a ton [of bracelets], all the way up the arms. I had to take them off, my circulation was getting cut off! Everyone was just chucking their bracelets at me. I’ve seen her three times, and every time the show has just gotten better.”  She showed off her collection on Instagram during one of the shows and it was a lot of bracelets.  Clark has spent the last year or two learning the ups and downs of life as a superstar, but this is certainly a very unique pitfall of fame, being so popular you get too many friendship bracelets and start to lose feeling in your arm."

	The NBA Cup is back for a second season, and here's how it will all work and what groups each team ended up in.","The NBA’s efforts to add a little excitement to the doldrums of its regular season will return on Tuesday evening. For the second straight year, the league will hold its new cup competition, now known as the Emirates NBA Cup. The first year was fun, with the Los Angeles Lakers winning the whole thing by knocking off the Indiana Pacers in Las Vegas, and now, the NBA will continue its efforts to turn this nascent event into a crucial part of its calendar. What does this all mean? Well, we tried to answer that today by explaining what’s new this year, how the whole thing will work, and why we’re excited to watch this as it tries to become a tentpole event on the NBA calendar. So is this just the In-Season Tournament but with a new name? It is! While the NBA has never explicitly said this, my assumption is that they spent the first year calling it the In-Season Tournament so fans would get a sense of what it is before calling it what they always wanted to call it: The NBA Cup, or more specifically, the Emirates NBA Cup. Or maybe they just couldn’t find a sponsor in the first year. What’s that Emirates thing? I’ve seen its logo on courts but never actually looked into what it is. It’s an airline based out of the United Arab Emirates that sponsors a lot of stuff. They’re sponsoring this event, which is the second-best thing that the NBA does, and fortunately, Emirates has plenty of experience sponsoring the second-best thing, as they are the shirt sponsor for Arsenal. What? Just let me cook. Ok, so, any major differences from last year other than the name? A big one are the courts. Last year, they came under criticism from players (who kept slipping on them) and fans (who thought some were huge eyesores, particularly because of the weird, cumbersome stripe they had going down the middle of the courts). They’re not nearly as bad this year, as they replaced the stripe with rings in the center of the floor and got rid of some of the more abrasive designs that just do not work on television. I’m sure not everyone will love them, but I think they are a huge improvement on last year — we just have to see if players struggle with their footing on them, or else the aesthetic changes do not matter at all. What about point differential? I know some players disliked that. Well, that’s still sticking around as a potential tiebreaker for which teams do and do not advance. Frankly, I think it’s fine and we saw last year that some of the European players were trying to egg their teammates on — Domantas Sabonis was the main one I remember — but it’ll still take a bit of a shift for everyone to get on board with it. Remind me how determining how teams advance will work again? Sure! Right from the league: So the easiest way to move on is to just win your group and not worry about any tiebreakers. That is correct. Well then, what do the groups look like? Once again, the NBA broke things up into three groups of five teams in each conference — this will, hopefully, look a lot cleaner when expansion happens, we get up to 32 teams, and they can do groups of four in each conference where each team plays group games home and away. The group games will happen on Tuesdays and Fridays starting tonight and running through Dec. 3. Here’s how it all looks: West Group A: Minnesota, LA Clippers, Sacramento, Houston, Portland West Group B: Oklahoma City, Phoenix, LA Lakers, Utah, San Antonio West Group C: Denver, Dallas, New Orleans, Golden State, Memphis East Group A: New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Charlotte East Group B: Milwaukee, Indiana, Miami, Toronto, Detroit East Group C: Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington How do these teams qualify for the knockouts? Same as last year — win your group and you get a spot. Both conferences then get one remaining spot for a wild card team, which goes to the best remaining team that did not automatically qualify by winning its group. This is probably where those aforementioned tiebreakers would come in, but you never know. And will the knockouts work like last year, too? Yup! Single-elimination basketball games, with the quarterfinals happening on-site at home arenas and the semifinals and final happening in Las Vegas. The quarters are on Dec. 10 and 11, the semis are on Dec. 14, and the final is on Dec. 17. And are these games all considered regular season games, too? For the most part they are — group games, the quarters, and the semis will all count towards regular season records again, while the championship game will not. So it looks a lot like last year, then. That’s right, the league has, essentially, decided to keep a lot of things the same other than the name and the courts. Oh, also, as a programming note: home teams will wear their Statement Edition uniforms, while road teams wear their Association edition uniforms, according to the league. Huh, well then, ok. You don’t seem enthused about all of this, dear reader. Yeah, I mean, I am still unsure why I should care about this. Well that’s easy: You don’t have to! You’re an adult with agency and the ability to care about whatever you want, times are tough, maybe you don’t want to get super personally invested in a new thing the NBA is doing, that’s fine. But you seem to like this. I do! Why? I think a big split I have noticed here is “fans who like soccer” and “fans who do not,” with the former being more open to the idea of a midseason cup competition — Adam Silver has compared the NBA Cup to the FA Cup in English football, but basically every domestic league has a secondary cup competition. The thing is that these competitions are universally considered not as important as winning the league, but they are still important because it’s an opportunity to win something historic and provide some validation for a team’s season. The NBA Cup is only in its second year, so clearly, it has a way to go before it gets taken that seriously — the whole saga with the Lakers debating putting up a little banner is an example of this. But the FA Cup, for example, is not considered cool because everyone farts around and then Manchester City wins it at the end. It’s considered cool because teams from several levels of English football have a chance to win it, and sometimes, you get magical runs to the very end. We got a glimpse of what that could look like last year when the Indiana Pacers nearly won the whole thing. Hell, if not for the fact that they’re the Lakers, it’d probably be viewed as proof of concept that the final was between a Play-In team and an upstart young squad trying to win something for the first time. That is, to steal a phrase from the English, the magic of the cup. So acknowledging that this isn’t as important as winning the NBA Finals is fine? One-hundred percent. The longer the NBA sticks with this — and, let’s face it, Silver is essentially staking his legacy as a commissioner on this becoming a big deal — the more likely it is that it’ll settle into a spot where fans/franchises like that it is a thing that they can win, all while understanding that the big prize is still waiting for them in June. It helps, of course, that there’s a financial incentive to do well. Remind me what that is. Sure! Players whose teams make the quarterfinals make $50,000, players whose teams make the semifinals make $100,000, players on the runners-up make $200,000, and players on the team that wins the whole thing makes $500,000. Nice. I agree. Anyway, this sounds like, bare minimum, a thing I can have on my television on Tuesdays and Fridays. It is, and really, if that’s all that comes from this for the next year or two, that’s totally fine. Something like this will only become a big deal the more it happens and the more it becomes ingrained as part of the sport’s culture, and as long as this year is a step towards doing that, I’m sure it’ll all work out in the long-run. Nice. Well, I suppose I can tune in. That you can, and if you want to know what games are on, when they’re on, and which networks they’ll be on, you can click right here."

While the league will have a presence in a few different places, its two main events — All-Star Saturday Night and the All-Star Game — will set up shop at the Chase Center in San Francisco, which is the home of the Golden State Warriors. It stands to reason that we’ll see some of the big names associated with the franchise involved in the festivities — Steph Curry, if I had to guess, is going to be an extremely busy man for a few days. And in the lead-up to the league making its way to California, a number of the biggest names in music from the Bay Area teamed up with the Warriors to release a new song in celebration of the All-Star Game going to San Francisco. The track is titled “Players Holiday ‘25,” and features Saweetie, G-Eazy, P-Lo, LaRussell, Larry June, Kamaiyah, Thuy, and YMTK. It’s not the only release the team has in store for All-Star, as a full album, titled For The Soil, will come out in January. You can listen to the song — which is being released via the Warriors’ record label Golden State Entertainment — at the top of this post. “The Warriors have been a big part of my journey, and it’s an honor to collaborate with Golden State Entertainment and some of the most iconic voices from the community to create something that represents the culture we live and breathe,” P-Lo said in a statement.

	The NBA Cup starts Tuesday night and we are looking at eight teams that should invest a little extra energy in the early season competition.","The second edition of the NBA Cup (now with a fancy sponsor, Emirates) will begin on Tuesday night as group stage action gets started. Feelings on the NBA Cup vary, but for the most part, it seems to have been at least a mild positive in terms of adding a little juice to November regular season hoops.  Last year, the eight teams that emerged from group play were the Celtics, Bucks, Pacers, and Knicks in the East, and the Lakers, Kings, Suns, and Pelicans in the West. Ultimately, the Lakers beat the Pacers in the final, marking the high point of the season for Los Angeles, while that was just the beginning of a run to the conference finals from Indiana. There are differing views from teams on how they approach the Cup, but because most of the games until you get to Vegas count all the same as regular season games, you should see contenders still trying at least until the quarterfinals where they may punt to avoid adding a trip to Vegas to their schedule.  Not every team has the Cup schedule circled on their calendars, and for some, it gets in the way of the long-term goals (either to get lottery balls or winning a title). But as the Pacers showed a year ago, for a young team without much playoff experience, the Cup can get guys feet wet to that kind of environment and build some confidence for the tournament everyone cares about come April, May, and June.  Here, we’ll look at eight teams that we think should be willing to invest early season energy into trying to get to Vegas and hoist the NBA Cup.   Houston’s gotten off to a strong start this season at 7-4, and I think they’re in a similar position to the Pacers last year, as they can use this as a way to test their young roster without much playoff experience. A successful run to the knockout rounds (and maybe beyond) would be a genuinely big deal for the Rockets, who can assert themselves as a genuine threat in the West playoff race with a strong tournament showing.  We saw that the Lakers were willing to raise their level a year ago in the Cup competition, and it’d be kind of incredible if they went back-to-back. Their group is a bit less daunting now that the Thunder are without Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein (although that’s still an excellent team), and if they make the knockout rounds, a team with LeBron and AD is always going to be a threat in a single-elimination basketball game. We’ll see if they approach it with the same aggression, but this is a team that has to try and chase wins regardless, so I’d expect the effort to be there, even if they can’t replicate the same kind of run.  The Grizzlies want to prove they are fully back as West contenders, and they can make a strong statement if they come out of the aforementioned Group of Death. They are playing at a high level right now, led by Jaren Jackson Jr.’s continued brilliance, and if they can get to Vegas, they’d have a very good chance at lifting the Cup. And if Ja Morant can get healthy and come back in time, absolutely no one will want to see that guy in a one-off. By the time the season is over, the Spurs will likely have filtered out of the Play-In race, but this is the exact kind of team I think should place an overemphasis on the NBA Cup. The Spurs are still building around Victor Wembanyama and figuring out what that should look like, but this team has been fairly competitive early (5-6) and could take advantage of some injury woes for the top teams in their group to try and make a little noise in the Cup. We saw in the Olympics that Wemby loves some heightened competition, and this might be a good chance to turn him loose and make an all-out push for something in November, understanding that they probably don’t have the roster just yet to really threaten the playoffs.  Will the Cavs ever lose? At some point, yes, but why not keep the good vibes rolling as long as possible and try to win the Cup? Yes, they’re a title contender, but unlike, say, Boston, this isn’t a team that’s had any real playoff success. Building some good habits in the knockout rounds could pay dividends down the road, and seeing as how they’re in the same group as the Celtics, I’m sure they’d love to use this as a statement of intent in the event they cross paths in the postseason. The Bucks desperately need something to turn around their season, and maybe the Cup gives them a carrot to chase that can wake things up. I’m skeptical they have the juice to make this happen, as the vibes are just horrendous in Milwaukee right now, but theoretically, Giannis and Dame (who will miss their opener with a concussion) are good enough as a tandem to beat anyone. That will require them to get on the same page, which hasn’t really happened to this point, but perhaps playing on different courts can change the mojo in Milwaukee.  Like every team other than the Cavs and Celtics in the East, the Knicks are off to a sputtering start at 4-5. Their star-studded roster isn’t clicking just yet, the defense has taken a major step back, and the offense hasn’t been quite good enough to make up for it. Their group, at one point, looked like the toughest in the East, but the Magic are without Paolo Banchero and the Sixers … well, we’ll get to them in a second. That cracks the door for the Knicks to try and lay a foundation of winning they can build on as the season progresses and create that chemistry that’s been lacking in games with a slightly bigger game feel. Joel Embiid is back for the Cup games, but Tyrese Maxey is out and Paul George has been on a minutes restriction. This team is desperate to go on a run, and with the big fella back, there’s no time like the present to try and climb out of the East’s basement. Like the Bucks, Philly just needs to stack some wins and get some positivity, and if they can somehow make it to Vegas, they can erase a decent amount of the early season concern about them."
Sports – UPROXX,How Darius Garland And The Cavs Got Their Confidence Back,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/darius-garland-interview-cleveland-cavaliers-confidence/,"Mon, 11 Nov 2024 21:37:23 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	The Cavs are off to an 11-0 start, and we talked to Garland about the work this summer that led to the return of his confidence and smile.","The Cleveland Cavaliers came into the 2024-25 season with plenty of pressure, as this felt like a make-it-or-break-it season for their Core Four. They re-signed Donovan Mitchell and gave contract extensions to Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen, while Darius Garland is entering the second year of his own 5-year deal. A ton of money has been committed to this group, with the expectation that they would take another step forward as a real threat in the Eastern Conference under new head coach Kenny Atkinson.  While they can’t fully answer whether they’ve done that until May and June, the Cavs have made an emphatic statement to open the season, as they are the NBA’s last remaining unbeaten at 11-0. That hot start is the byproduct of confidence and trust in their group, something they’ve built over the years but had to fortify by figuring out how everyone can play to their strengths. One of the difficult tasks of building confidence as a unit is that each player has to first have that confidence in themselves. The story of the young season for Cleveland has been strides in that area by the two youngest members of their core, as Garland and Mobley are playing some of the best basketball of their careers.  For Garland, he’s bounced back after a difficult 2023-24 campaign that saw him suffer a broken jaw early in the year and never get fully back to his peak level. As he explained to DIME over the weekend, after missing a third of the season, he wasn’t too interested in vacations this summer, instead opting to get in the gym and build back the strength, confidence, and wiggle that had been missing at the end of last season.  “It’s a total difference. It’s a big difference,” Garland said of how he feels starting this season compared to the second half of last year. “I’m in a good head space right now. I’m fully healthy — some little nicks, but nothing too major right now. And yeah, just came in with a lot of confidence over the summer, put in a lot of work. Especially after last year, I didn’t play a lot of games, so wasn’t a lot of vacations for me this summer, or a lot of hangout time. It was really just strictly in the gym trying to get better, trying to put some more weight and some more muscle on that I lost from last year, from having to jaw surgery. And yeah, trying to get my confidence back, trying to get my wiggle back, and my ball handling and just trying to stay consistent with it.”  Garland’s summer in the gym helped him remember how much he loves the game. One of the lasting images from the end of last season for Garland and the Cavs was Donovan Mitchell on the bench putting his arm around Garland and saying “I believe in you,” as Garland was mired in the midst of a shooting slump. It was a touching moment between teammates, but also telling of how difficult things were for Garland, who had lost his perpetual smile and was finding it difficult to have that same sense of belief.  This season, his confidence is back, as is his infectious smile, and Garland is looking to spread that positivity beyond the court as well. For Veteran’s Day weekend, that means welcoming a pair of Gold Star families from the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) to the Cavs’ games against the Nets and Bulls, as Garland is helping honor a pair of families of fallen veterans from his hometown of Gary, IN.  “It’s super cool just to have some veteran families around me,” Garland said. “My grandfathers were veterans, so just trying to show some love and support for some of the families, and show that they’re loved and that they mean a lot to us, and we know how it is battling some things that they’ve gone through and that they’ve been through. So yeah, just to have their backs and just show that they’re loved and that we really appreciate it.” Both families have ties to Garland, as his mother went to high school with both of the fallen service members. He wants to take the opportunity his platform provides to show them love and do his favorite thing: put a smile on someone’s face. “I try to do it a little bit more often now, especially to kids and those with special needs,” Garland said. “I was one of the kids growing up looking up to Kobe, LeBron, Dame Lillard, Steph, so when I was growing up and they were giving back to younger kids and other people, I just always wanted to do the same. I know that it’ll just make their whole day and change the way that they look at things. So, trying to do it often and just try to put a smile on somebody’s face. That always means a lot to me, because I always wear a smile on my face.”   A post shared by Cavs Care (@cavscare_)  The way the Cavs have played so far this season has put an awful lot of smiles on faces in Cleveland, and Garland credits their hot start to the connectivity of the group and the confidence that’s instilled up and down the roster. This is the third year together for the Core Four, and many of their reserves have also been part of the team for at least a year or two. That familiarity has created a culture of accountability, with Garland noting that from players to coaches to the training staff, there’s a camaraderie that allows for honest conversations that make everyone better.  The newest face in the room is head coach Kenny Atkinson, as he took over for JB Bickerstaff (now in Detroit) with aspirations of taking this group to the next level. Garland, like everyone else in Cleveland, has been impressed with how Atkinson hit the ground running with the Cavs, and highlighted the way he instills confidence in everyone as the biggest thing he’s brought to the team. “He was a player, so he knows what it’s like playing a lot of games, and just having that confidence out on the floor — I mean, when you have that confidence, I think you just get boosted a little bit more,” Garland said. “You think that you can do anything and make any kind of shot, and that’s what our team has right now. We’re shooting the ball with confidence, making plays with confidence, and we’re doing it on both ends of the floor, and I think that’s where he’s just instilling us. Even at film, when we don’t shoot a shot we’re wide open, he’s going to get on us about shooting the ball, because that might be the only good shot that we have in that possession. So he wants us to shoot every ball with confidence, shoot every open one and just keep continuing to play hard and trust each other.” Garland has always been a good shooter, but last season, that confidence in his shot waned a bit, particularly in the postseason. That gave Garland plenty of motivation this summer, where he stripped his game back down to the basics and built it back up with a focus on the little details that go a long way in the games.  “Just trying to pay attention to details,” Garland said. “Just try to do all the little things to make me a better scorer, make me a better shooter. Literally the smallest things, like getting my feet ready, staying down low before I even get the ball. I mean, just literally everything, all the little things. I really went back from square one, from when I started basketball and just worked my way up until I could really start moving and going full speed for the entire summer. So I really went back to the basics this summer, and just tried to clean everything up and just try to polish everything, and getting some of the results back right now.”  The results are the best shooting percentages of his career from every level, with splits of 53.8/47.5/95.0 through the first 11 games. He’s finishing better than he ever has at the rim, a byproduct of the strength he added over the summer, and he’s shooting threes at a higher rate and making more of them than he ever has as a pro. That’s a lethal combination, and he certainly seems to have found that wiggle off the bounce once again, helped by his decisiveness and confidence with the ball as both a shooter and driving to attack the defense.  Garland is far from alone in having a strong start, as the Cavs are finding a way to feed off each other and recognizing how each of them can make the others better. Along with Garland’s return to All-Star form, Mobley has become a bigger part of the offense and is a big beneficiary of that boost of confidence Atkinson has provided. Mobley playing with more force and freedom on both ends of the floor raises their ceiling, and Garland is quick to note how his play opens up so much of the floor for everyone else, calling him “our catalyst.” “He gets us going on both ends of the floor, and he can do so many things, especially on offensive side of the ball,” Garland said. “We can set a 1-5 pick and roll with him, and I go set a pick-and-roll, or Don go set a pick-and-roll for him, and let him just work off that screen. And when he gets downhill he’s a great decision maker, so he’s going to make the right read. We really have a lot of trust in him. We just want him to continue to be confident in his game, want him to shoot some more threes, which is getting better over the years. And yeah, just to be the leader on both ends of the floor, especially defensively. Hopefully he’s All-NBA or Defensive Player of the Year this year, which he’s super capable of, and especially him and JA back there, it’s really tough to get anything at the rim.” The grind of the NBA regular season is impossible to avoid, but the Cavs have found an early comfort in leaning on their depth. At the top, they can play to the hot hand among their stars, but they’re finding an ability to be more adaptable as a roster to change their approach and lineups as needed based on matchups and game flow. With Mobley and Allen, they’ve always been able to go big, but against Brooklyn on Saturday, they closed with a four-guard lineup and showed how they can succeed going small, with Caris LeVert and Ty Jerome stepping in and playing well to close out their 11th win to start the season. As Garland explains, their experiences together, the highs and the lows, have taught them a lot about how they need to play, particularly in late game situations where slowing down and getting stagnant to let one player operate can be tempting, but ultimately plays into the hands of the defense.  “We have so much talent on this team and a lot of depth, so we just have a lot of confidence in everybody, and we’ve been in these situations before. Like I said, we’ve been around each other for a couple years now, so we know what to do. We’ve seen all different scenarios, from being in regular season or the playoffs, so when it’s late game situations, I think that we’re starting to get pretty good at it. And even with our depth last night, Ty Jerome and Caris, they ended the game with us. And, I mean, they made a difference when we went four guards and Evan at the five. It’s just so many different things that we can do because of because of our depth. And we got so much talent. I mean, you really have to just pick and poison, either you’re gonna give up a wide open three or a layup or a floater or something.” Garland and the Cavs know there are no banners to be hung for a fast start to the season, but for a team that just never seemed to hit their stride a year ago, this stretch is a reminder to both themselves and the rest of the league that they do have the kind of ceiling where they can beat anyone. There are still 71 games left in the season, but building the confidence and trust internally early on figures to pay dividends down the road.  For now, the Cavs will look to prolong their winning streak as long as they can, but as Garland notes, they have “bigger plans in May and June” and hope to keep putting smiles on faces in Cleveland deep into the spring."

	Barrett did a literal double-take and couldn't stop from blurting out ""Game of Thrones!""","There is no team that has more celebrities attend their games than the Lakers (the Knicks being a close second), as the courtside seats at L.A. games often go a few rows deep with stars from the world of entertainment. There are the regulars like Jack Nicholson and Denzel Washington, but on any given night you might find an actor from your favorite TV show or movie watching the Lakers play.  That happened to Toronto wing RJ Barrett on Sunday night as the Raptors made their annual trek to Los Angeles. After finishing through contact for an and-1, Barrett turned to the crowd in the corner to celebrate only to find himself face-to-face with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, best known for playing Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones. Barrett realized this mid-celebration and did a literal double take, turned back to Coster-Waldau, pointed, and blurted out “Game of Thrones!” at him before turning around and walking to the free throw line.   A post shared by Dime (@dimemagazine)  It’s a very funny thing to happen in the middle of an NBA game, but also, that’s exactly how I would react if I turned around and was suddenly face-to-face with the guy that played Jaime Lannister. I feel like this is far from the first time someone has pointed at Coster-Waldau and just yelled “Game of Thrones!” at him, as that is by far the role he’s best known for."

	We caught up with Liv Morgan after she made history as the first Women's Crown Jewel Champion.","Before kicking off the Liv Morgan World Tour, and before becoming the first Women’s Crown Jewel Champion, the current Women’s World Champion sat at home nursing a dislocated shoulder. As Liv Morgan recovered for six months throughout 2023, she says she had a moment of clarity.  Over the first decade of her career, she’d allowed her ring work to speak for itself. During her time away, Morgan took a step back and felt like she had lacked a true voice or character. As she plotted her return to the ring, she created the Liv Morgan Revenge Tour built around the realities of her injury, while envisioning a path back to the top of the WWE mountain.  “The Liv Morgan Revenge Tour,” Morgan tells Uproxx Sports, “gave me such a purpose.” Some of the best stories in professional wrestling have been at least somewhat based in reality, and the way Morgan was injured gave her a motive, direction, and something so personal and true, that it allowed her for the first time in her career to really sink her teeth into a story. “Rhea (Ripley) really did dislocate my shoulder,” Morgan says. “I really sat home for six months watching her ascend to the top of the division. And so it was all really personal to me, and I used all that to come back and do exactly to her what she did to me. But I did that and more.” While she’s navigated trying to find her character throughout a decade in WWE, elements of who Morgan is as a person have helped her continue to chip away at this dream. Her drive, passion, wanting to learn as much as she can, and desire to give herself an opportunity to see what she could achieve has brought her this far.  “(My time away) just gave me the time and space that I needed to really settle into my own, which brought out the best version of Liv Morgan than we’ve seen thus far,” Morgan says.  The last seven months have been a whirlwind for Morgan. She kicked off the Raw after WrestleMania 40 with a beatdown of Ripley that would alter the trajectory of her career. A legitimate shoulder injury suffered in the melee forced Ripley to relinquish the title and led to Morgan beating Becky Lynch for the belt. That win kickstarted the pivotal run of her career, with new twists and turns added by the month.  “I like to believe that everything happens for a reason. Even if you don’t know the reason, I know that’s so cliche, but I really live my life by that. And so even when things happen that I feel are bizarre or even unfortunate things, I always tend to think that on the other side of it, it is going to be for a greater purpose,” Morgan says.  “There’s so much beauty in the madness and it’s cool to be able to pivot and adjust when things aren’t going the way we anticipated it, because we took something that was supposed to be great and we made it even greater. And so I just think that the stars are aligned and everything is happening exactly as it should.” Morgan has embraced the “crazy, messy love triangle” that’s followed her dynamic with Dominik Mysterio and Ripley, “whether they love to hate us or hate to love us.” Mysterio switched allegiances, Morgan joined the Judgement Day while Ripley was ousted, Raquel Rodriguez returned to join her side, and Ripley recently suffered another injury that will sideline her for the foreseeable future. Paired alongside Mysterio and thus far able to hold off Ripley, Morgan isn’t just matching the status quo for a world champion — she’s literally doing things that haven’t been done before.  The latest in her evolution from charting a Revenge Tour to creating a Liv Morgan World Tour came with a championship-worthy diamond ring, after claiming the first-ever Women’s Crown Jewel Championship in a win over Nia Jax last week.  “It means so much to me on so many different levels,” Morgan continues. “We’ve made history in Saudi Arabia. We had the very first women’s title match for the Women’s Crown Jewel Championship. And that is so much progress. I feel like since I’ve started in WWE, all I’ve wanted to do is really carve my own path and see how great I could become. And the fact that I’ve made history and the first and only Women’s Crown Jewel Champion, I am just so proud and so honored. And I just hope that I do it justice.” The opportunities are endless for where Morgan goes from here. She’s open to the idea of a second Evolution all-women’s wrestling show, with a loaded roster across Raw, Smackdown, and NXT.  “I don’t think we need our own show to be more prestigious,” Morgan says. “I think we are prestigious and I think people tune in specifically for the women’s segments and for women’s wrestling. But to give the fans what they want is why I would love to have another all women’s show in Evolution part 2.” A WrestleMania main event is something that’s eluded Morgan across her career, but calls it the pinnacle of wrestling in WWE and is without a doubt an accomplishment she’d love to check off her bucket list. “You can’t get any bigger, higher, better, more prestigious than main eventing WrestleMania,” Morgan says. “I spend a lot of my life dreaming and hoping and wishing. And I’ve been fortunate and lucky and blessed enough to have a lot of those things come true. So yes, main eventing WrestleMania is definitely on my list. With whom, I don’t know what that looks like or what it is but I hope that we can find out together.” Morgan can accomplish just about anything because at this very moment she genuinely has the faith and belief that she can. As she continues to build upon her second world title run, the Liv Morgan we see onscreen every week couldn’t be any more different than the one that was Smackdown Champion two years ago.  “It’s just a different Liv Morgan. The Liv Morgan that won the SmackDown Championship from Ronda Rousey, that girl she was just happy to be there. She maybe didn’t even see herself or believe in herself as a champion yet. She was a girl with just a pipe dream, cash in her briefcase at the right moment in the right time,” Morgan says. “This Liv Morgan is the most confident version of herself so far. This Liv Morgan knows her worth. This Liv Morgan knows she’s the greatest women’s champion of all time. This Liv Morgan knows she’s untouchable. This Liv Morgan knows she has the most dominant faction in all of WWE by her side. That’s the difference.”"

	Holmgren fell hard on his right hip after contesting a shot and had to be helped off the floor without putting weight on his right leg.","The Oklahoma City Thunder entered Sunday tied with the Suns for the top spot in the Western Conference, and figured to face a stiff test with the red-hot Golden State Warriors in town. OKC got off to a strong start, taking a 33-26 lead after the first quarter, but there was some considerable concern about their star big man as Chet Holmgren had to be helped off the floor and into the locker room after landing hard on his right hip after contesting an Andrew Wiggins layup attempt at the rim (watch here).  Holmgren slams down onto the hardwood and immediately grabbed at his right hip in pain. He was ultimately helped off the floor and into the tunnel without putting any weight on his right leg by a pair of Thunder staffers. Holmgren has gotten off to a tremendous start to his sophomore campaign, averaging 18.2 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.9 blocks per game coming into Sunday’s contest, asserting himself as a serious threat for DPOY with his work protecting the rim for the league’s best defense so far.  The Thunder will hope Holmgren’s injury was just a painful fall and not something more serious that could lead to an extended absence, as they are already incredibly thin at the center position with Isaiah Hartenstein still out with a fractured hand.  UPDATE: Holmgren was ruled out for the game with what the Thunder officially called a right hip injury. Shams Charania reported later Monday night that Holmgren would miss 8-10 weeks with a hip fracture."

	Giannis played a little prank on Jaylen Brown after catching him with an elbow, but the Celtics star wasn't a big fan of Giannis' antics.","The Milwaukee Bucks and Boston Celtics have had two very different starts to the season, as the defending champs have picked up where they left off with another strong beginning to their repeat bid, while the Bucks have been one of the NBA’s worst teams despite having a healthy Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo.  It has not been the kind of start Milwaukee envisioned, and they were hoping to kickstart a turnaround on Sunday when they played host to the Celtics with a chance to alleviate some of the panic about the team’s start by beating one of the league’s best. As they’ve done on a few occasions this season, the Bucks came out hot, scoring 40 in the first quarter to take a double-digit lead, but couldn’t maintain that offensive output, scoring just 38 in the entire second half to see the Celtics pull ahead and pull away for a 113-107 win.  During the game, Giannis and Jaylen Brown had an interesting exchange, as Antetokounmpo elbowed Brown in the head on a post move and then hit Brown with a fake handshake as they went back down the court, which Brown didn’t seem to appreciate.   A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston)  After the game, Brown gave some brief, but unfiltered thoughts on the exchange. “Giannis is a child,” Brown dead-panned. “I’m just focused on helping my team get a win, and that’s what we did tonight.”  Giannis certainly wasn’t the chief culprit for the Bucks struggles on Sunday, as he had 43 points and 13 rebounds, but this kind of silly exchange doesn’t quite land as well with fans when the team is falling to 2-8 on the season, with the only team worse than them in the East being the Embiid-less Sixers."

	The Chiefs moved to 9-0 after blocking a 35-yard kick by Denver with one second left that would've won the game.","The Kansas City Chiefs entered Sunday as the NFL’s last remaining undefeated team at 8-0, and were heavy favorites to move to 9-0 at home against their divisional rival from Denver. However, the Chiefs offense, which has been sluggish at times this season, could not finish off drives with touchdowns and allowed the Broncos to hang around all game.  On Sunday, it looked like that would finally catch up to them and result in a loss, as the Broncos moved the ball inside the Chiefs 20 on their final drive of the game, trailing 16-14, setting up a 35-yard field goal attempt for the win by Wil Lutz. However, the Chiefs special teams unit still had at least one more miracle in them, as George Karlaftis, Leo Chenal, and company caved in the left side of the Broncos field goal unit and blocked the kick to preserve the 16-14 win.  A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  It’s an insane way for the Chiefs to win that game, as they were completely unable to run the ball (19 carries for 57 yards, 19 yards coming from Patrick Mahomes scrambling), missed a number of big play opportunities and had to settle for field goals, and gave up a critical late game drive deep into their own territory. And yet, they move on to Week 11 at 9-0 on the season with a schedule that isn’t the most difficult if they can get past a road trip to Buffalo next week — although, as Sunday proved, division games can always get weird."
Sports – UPROXX,The Bucks Have ‘Called The Whole League’ Trying To Find A Trade After Their Awful Start,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/milwaukee-bucks-trade-rumors-called-whole-league/,"Fri, 08 Nov 2024 22:30:53 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	The Bucks are trying to find a roster upgrade, but with their cap situation, they're finding it nearly impossible despite their best effort.","The Milwaukee Bucks came into the 2024-25 season hopeful that having both Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo fully healthy and coming off a full training camp together would vault them back into being a threat in the Eastern Conference. Instead, the Bucks are 2-6 with their only wins over the tanking Jazz and the Sixers on opening night — who were without Joel Embiid and Paul George and have also looked awful to start the season.  It’s been rough on both sides of the ball for the Bucks, as they are in the bottom half of the league in both offensive and defensive rating through the first few weeks of the season, and while things should improve if and when Khris Middleton can get back healthy for an extended period of time, it’s also pretty clear this roster has some flaws in need of fixing. The problem for the Bucks is, as a second apron team, making a trade is extremely difficult, as they’ve found out the hard way recently.  On Friday’s episode of NBA Today, Brian Windhorst said the Bucks have “called pretty much the whole league” trying to find a trade that could improve their roster, but have run into the same issues with just about everyone.  “The Bucks are doing something that we don’t see very often, which is scouring the trade market in the first week of November,” Windhorst said. “As I was talking to teams this week, they were like, ‘The Bucks just called. The Bucks just called.’ I think the Bucks right now are just kind of searching and trying to cover their bases. And by the way, Giannis is not on the table, Dame is not on the table, they’re looking to try and (find) help for some of their wing play — Khris Middleton’s absence has been extended.  “I talked to one team who said, ‘Yeah, we talked to the Bucks. We came up with two or three different scenarios and realized we’re not allowed to make any of those trades.’ The Bucks are hemmed in as a second-apron team with the new rules. They can’t aggregate players together, they can’t put like two or three players together in a trade. They can’t do a trade where they bring in more money. They have traded away the next six first round picks, either the picks or the swaps, they have traded away the next six second round picks. They are $75 million in the luxury tax. I don’t think help is on the way through the trade market. But they are making calls, which is interesting because from what I can tell, they called pretty much the whole league.” The two players the Bucks were reported to be shopping over the summer (and even last trade deadline) were Bobby Portis and Pat Connaughton, but as Windhorst notes, being unable to aggregate those salaries together means they have to find a player to trade for that matches salary exactly or makes just a little less than either of those two. Given Portis makes just over $12.5 million and Connaughton makes just under $9.5 million, that’s a tough thing to do if the goal is to add a strong contributor for a contender. As such, Windy doesn’t expect them to find a miraculous deal out there, and it sounds like, despite the front office’s best efforts in working the phones, it’s going to come down to this roster to turn things around in Milwaukee."

	Come get these winners.","More than half of the 2024 NFL regular season is over. That reality is painful for those enjoy consuming every aspect of professional football and, in this space, things haven’t gone particularly well. In fact, it was largely a disaster for the first seven weeks but, after back-to-back winning performances, optimism is beginning to creep in.  Would it have been better if the Cleveland Browns or Green Bay Packers could’ve taken care of business last week? Certainly. But here we are after a 3-2 showing. Before handing out this week’s selections, let’s take stock as we dig out of the hole.  Come get these winners. I am actually quite high on the Bills dating back to the summer, but I can’t get them to -4 here. Buffalo is riding high with a four-game winning streak, which helps to explain the number, and Indianapolis has flopped with two straight losses. Still, Joe Flacco and company shouldn’t be getting a full four at home, and we have to take the candy. This is just a principle play. We’re taking advantage of a Wong teaser here, sending Pittsburgh through a pair of key numbers and doing the same with Kansas City. The Steelers have been a wagon as an underdog under Mike Tomlin. The Chiefs will eventually lose (I think) but it won’t be here.  As noted a week ago, this credit goes to UPROXX editor Robby Kalland, but NFC South overs are unbeaten this season. Perhaps that will come to an end here, but Atlanta’s offense can put up points in bunches and its defense is capable of letting the Saints hang around. Let’s go touchdowns. I have to admit that I hate this. I know my editors will hate this. But Los Angeles is laying more than a touchdown with a total in the 30’s? It isn’t as if the Chargers have a real home-field advantage either. I’m holding my nose as I type this, but I simply must. New York has been a sharp side all week, and that makes sense. I couldn’t quite give out the Jets in an awesome spot last week, but I think this is a sell-high spot on Arizona after their blowout win over Chicago. Take me there, Aaron Rodgers."

	The new release from ""A Philly Special Christmas Party"" features an unlikely duet between the Hall of Fame center and the legendary singer.","Jason Kelce clearly has some pretty major aspirations for this year’s version of his annual Christmas album. Earlier this month, fans of Kelce’s holiday project with his former Philadelphia Eagles teammates Lane Johnson and Jordan Mailata heard the first track off of their upcoming album A Philly Special Christmas Party, which featured Kelce teaming up with his brother, Travis Kelce, and Boyz II Men on the track “It’s Christmas Time (In Cleveland Heights).” Kelce collaborated with another legendary artist for the latest track off of the upcoming release, as he recorded a duet with Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks. The track, a cover of Ron Sexsmith’s “Maybe This Christmas,” got teased on the project’s Instagram account over the last week and on the latest edition of the Kelce brothers’ podcast, and was officially unveiled on Friday.  A post shared by A Philly Special Christmas (@aphillyspecialchristmas)  “There are no words to describe how incredible it is to have Stevie Nicks on this record,” executive producer Conner Barwin said in a statement given to Rolling Stone. “There is so much emotion in this song, and it was thrilling to be with them in the studio and watch her and Jason connect, be creative together, and witness this beautiful song become a reality.” A Philly Special Christmas Party will come out on Nov. 22, 2024, but if you’d like to listen to the new track, you can do that right here."

	NBA players have been appearing in music videos for years, and today, we highlighted some of the best cameos.","NBA players and musical artists have always been close with one another. One frequent way that we’ve seen that over the years is music videos, as NBA players have frequently made cameos in them, whether they’re just showing their face for a moment or they’re a main character in the story that an artist is trying to tell. Today, we wanted to highlight some of our favorite appearances that NBA players have made in music videos over the years. Players from a number of different eras — and songs from a number of different genres — made it on the list, but all of them feature artists making it a point to get some of the biggest names in basketball into their videos. This wasn’t the only time Kobe linked up with Destiny’s Child — he recorded a verse on a remix of their track “Say My Name.” He does have a cameo in the video for “Bug-a-Boo,” though, as Destiny’s Child — which is trying to get away from a group that is bugging them — dips into a locker room. While going through there, they come across Bryant, who is sitting there and getting ready to play basketball. MJ and MJ just had to appear in a music video together at some point, no? The two appear on a basketball court and shoot hoops with one another, and at one point, Michael (Jackson) teaches Michael (Jordan) some dance moves. These might have been the two most famous people in the world when this video came out in 1992, and it’s a pretty remarkable cultural artifact. The newest release on this list, DeRozan was one of the many celebrities who made a cameo in Lamar’s summer anthem that doubled as the high point of his feud with Drake from earlier this year. It turns out DeRozan has known Lamar for quite some time, and while he said he still has love for Drake despite appearing in this video, well, it sure seems like there might be some tension here. Shaq, as we’ve laid out before, has been in a ton of music videos over the years. His first was the iconic “Make ‘Em Say Uhh!” video, where he sits courtside and looks like he’s having the time of his life as Master P and co. put on a show on the hardwood. One of the biggest music videos of all time — it’s a little more than 14 and a half minutes long, and is absolutely jam packed with some of the biggest names in sports and entertainment at that time. Names like Deion Sanders, Rickey Henderson, and Wayne Gretzky make cameos, while the NBA is well-represented with two members of the Dream Team and, uh, a third player who was almost on the Dream Team. Easily the most … unique video on this list. It features Jimmy Butler dressed up in what I can only describe as an emo cowboy costume and really committing fully to the bit. (The bit, of course, is “Jimmy Butler dressing like this in a Fall Out Boy video.”) There is no one in the NBA quite like Jimmy, and this video is a pretty good example of why that is the case."

	Travis Kelce caught a stray on 'Jeopardy!.'","Travis Kelce has long been one of the NFL’s most visible stars, but recently, he has achieved a new level of widespread cultural notoriety thanks to his relationship with Taylor Swift. Jeopardy! made a nod to that during the November 6 episode. In the episode’s opening round (per J! Archive), the $200 clue in the “The TV Show In Question” category read, “Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity? is hosted by this man who’s maybe more famous as a BF than as a 3-time Super Bowl champ.” Contestant Derek Hieronymus correctly responded with Kelce. Here’s a video of the moment. This came shortly after Jeopardy! found itself in a bit of hot water. As USA Today notes, Heather Ryan, a contestant on the October 28 episode, recently spoke out about a clue that read, “Men seldom make passes at…,” with the correct response being, “Girls who wear glasses.” She said, “It is definitely an odd choice. I think it made everybody in the audience and on stage — and Ken Jennings, too — a little uncomfortable. It was like, ‘Oh, that was unexpected.’ Maybe we choose better rhyming phrases in 2024. […] Unfortunately, there are still girls who are (in) middle school, and they don’t want to wear their glasses and they’re losing out on their education. So, I think it’s much better to be able to see than anything else.” Jennings apologized following the incident, saying, “A little problematic, sorry Heather.”"

	Vivek Ranadive has unsurprisingly taken DeMar DeRozan's side in his simmering feud with Drake.","The Toronto Raptors traveled to Sacramento to take on the Kings on Wednesday night in a game that has suddenly given us a little spiciness off the court. Sacramento went to Toronto on the night of Vince Carter’s jersey retirement ceremony last week, which was the first time that DeMar DeRozan played in front of Drake since he appeared in the music video for Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us.” While DeRozan, in the immediate aftermath, said he has tons of love for Drake despite his cameo in the video, Drake expressed that he doesn’t want to see DeRozan get his number retired in Toronto when his career comes to an end, and DeRozan seemed to have a lot of fun responding. And on Wednesday with Drake’s beloved Raptors in town, Kings owner Vivek Ranadive decided to show some support to his star forward by wearing a shirt with the words “THEY NOT LIKE US” on it.  A post shared by SLAM (@slam)  The Kings picked up a 122-107 win on Wednesday to move and 5-3 on the season. All five starters scored in double-figures for Sacramento, with DeRozan leading the way with 27 points on 11-for-21 shooting. It is unclear if he was motivated by the fact that the team’s owner showed up and wore a shirt that trolled Drake, but I’m sure at least part of him appreciated it."

	Windhorst thinks the Warriors have an ""itchy trigger finger"" when it comes to trade talks and chasing another star.","The Golden State Warriors picked up a big early season win on Wednesday night when they defeated the Boston Celtics to improve to 7-1 on the young season and offer an early confirmation point that their hot start is the real deal after beating a number of teams in the middle and bottom of the standings.  The Warriors’ depth has been showcased during their hot start, but this is a team that was very active on the trade market this summer trying to land another star-level player to fit between Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. Paul George and Lauri Markkanen were well known pursuits of the Warriors, and their hot start may only further embolden the front office to go star-chasing during the season.  As Brian Windhorst laid out on Thursday’s First Take, the Warriors are the team he most expects to make a splash trade this season, as they have the contracts, young players, and draft assets to make a competitive offer for just about anyone.  ""The Warriors are the biggest candidate in my mind to make a big trade. They tried to trade for LeBron James last trade deadline… This is a team that's got an itchy trigger finger trying to make a big deal."" – Brian Windhorst 👀pic.twitter.com/0wYql9bYW4 — ClutchPoints (@ClutchPoints) November 7, 2024  Windhorst notes this front office seems to have an “itchy trigger finger” when it comes to trade talks, noting their efforts at landing another star date back to last deadline when they called the Lakers about LeBron. While a move isn’t imminent and they’ll likely ride this wave of positivity for awhile, by the time 2025 arrives and trade season kicks into full gear, they should be seen as a top threat for any star that comes available. We know the likes of Brandon Ingram and Zach LaVine are still available, but that was the case this summer and the Warriors seemed to balk at making a move for either of those two players. Instead, it seems Golden State is keen to wait to see if someone else comes available they could make a run at, but Windy, at the very least, would be very surprised if this Warriors roster looks the same by mid-February when San Francisco is hosting the All-Star Game."

	We caught up with Mercedes Moné to discuss her return from injury, regaining confidence, and how she's blazing a trail for the AEW women.","The last year has been a whirlwind for Mercedes Moné, and more than six months into her AEW tenure, there’s plenty to be grateful for.  What was once considered a career-ending ankle injury could have sidelined Moné for good, she refused to accept the possibility of her childhood dream being over, instead choosing optimism, and willing herself back into the ring. “It’s really just leading with gratitude, thankful to be a part of this wrestling community still,” Moné tells Uproxx Sports. “The last year was the craziest year of my whole life, not knowing where I was going to be in wrestling, but leading with gratitude and staying positive.” Moné landed in AEW in March, carrying the same mindset she’s had throughout her career as she’s trail blazed a new path for women’s wrestling.  “(I knew) where I wanted to be and what I want to leave in professional wrestling, to take this women’s division to whole new heights all over the world,” Moné says. “I wanted to have more for women’s wrestling, so I knew going to AEW was the place to be to make that happen. I feel like the women’s division has really changed the game. The women’s division has been the best it’s ever been. The women’s storylines are headlining AEW pay-per-views. So it’s just been amazing to come this far and I’m really excited for more.” For most athletes, an injury the severity of Moné’s typically requires at least two years to be back at full strength. She says she feels amazing being back in the ring and admits the toughest part of this journey is in the past.  “For me, it was just mentally going into the ring and training and being like, okay, I don’t want to be scared of climbing the top rope. I don’t want to be scared of jumping off the top rope. I don’t even want to be scared of running, because due to my injury, I couldn’t walk for over three months,” Moné says. “So just telling myself that I still got this. I got to train with Tyler Breeze for three months preparing myself for my AEW debut. And it was just getting my confidence back in the ring. That’s what really took some time. But now I’m feeling better than ever, and here I am as two belts Moné, so I’m feeling great.” After returning to the ring in May, Moné was quick to find gold around her waist. She defeated Willow Nightingale to earn the TBS title before claiming the NJPW STRONG Women’s championship just a month later. After sitting in the stands at All In at Wembley Stadium last year, Moné battled Britt Baker in London this year. She’s continued to find her footing in matches against Hikaru Shida, Emi Sakura, and most recently, Queen Aminata.  Moné isn’t just talking the talk, she’s leading the AEW women’s division to new heights and opening doors to elevate talent across the roster.  “I was born to be the best. I was born to have this purpose of leading a charge of making sure that women’s wrestling is known and respected and it deserves the respect that it’s given,” Moné says. “So just leaning on the standard that I put for myself, I’m here to be the best, to show the world that I’m the best, and I’m here to bring the women along with me. So that’s the goal.” While she has her eyes firmly on her next challenger for the TBS championship, Kris Statlander at the Full Gear pay-per-view on November 23, Moné isn’t stopping at defending the belts already in her possession. Mariah May told me ahead of All In earlier this year that she’s interested in mixing it up down the line with Moné, a dream opponent for the talented AEW Women’s champion. When — and if — that match happens remains to be seen.  Moné is never one to shy away from a challenge and says she’s “coming for all the titles” in AEW, while offering praise for one of the promotion’s brightest young talents. “I am super proud to watch from afar. She came in as a super fan, just loving wrestling, loved it so much that she moved from England to Japan, trained out in Stardom just to hone her craft, and now she’s here,” Moné says.   “She is our women’s world champion, beating Toni Storm in one of the best storylines in women’s history. So to see her rise this fast and to see how good she is in the ring, it’s so incredible. Like I said, we have the best women’s division in the game right now. And I’m definitely looking at the title that she has around her waist.”"

It was the first time that Morant got to play L.A. at home since the two teams went head-to-head in a tense playoff series back in 2023 — Los Angeles won in six games — and Morant sure did play like he still has that postseason failure on his mind. In the 131-114 Grizzlies win, Morant tied for the team high with 20 points, along with five assists, four rebounds, a steal, and a block. At one point, he scored over Gabe Vincent and hit him with a too small … only for LeBron James to come back on the very next possession and get him right back.  Ja Morant gave a ""too small"" to Gabe Vincent, and then LeBron gave it right back to Ja 😅pic.twitter.com/0N3OnwlMu1 — Dime (@DimeUPROXX) November 7, 2024  After the game, Morant spoke to the media, and after saying that James’ too small was done “respectfully,” he expressed that he really does not like the Lakers. “I don’t like ’em,” Morant told the press. “They knocked me out the playoffs … they beat us last time, I didn’t get to play, like I said, last year. They came on our home floor, beat us on our home floor, was laughin’, playin’, lookin’ at me, talkin’. My message was, I was in street clothes. This is my first opportunity to get back on the floor playing against them.” As for the whole “getting a too small for LeBron” thing, well, Morant took to Twitter after the win and addressed that."

	JJ Redick was blunt when asked why his starting guard got benched in the third quarter of Wednesday's loss to the Grizzlies.","The Los Angeles Lakers fell to the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday night, 131-114, as they attempt to navigate what has been a pretty difficult spate of injuries. One guy who hasn’t been injured, though, is starting guard D’Angelo Russell, although he saw his minutes cut on Wednesday — Russell came out of the game with 5:54 left in the third quarter, did not reenter, and only played 21:33 on the evening. New Lakers coach JJ Redick decided to close the game with Gabe Vincent on the floor, and after the game, he was asked why he kept Russell on the bench. As he explained, part of it was just wanted to see what Vincent gave him, but with Russell, there were some things that he did not like to see. “Level of compete, attention to detail, some of the things we’ve talked with him about for a couple weeks and, at times, he’s been really good with that stuff, and other times, it’s just reverting back to certain habits,” Redick told the press after the game at the 3:05 mark of the above video. “Wasn’t like a punishment, just felt like for us to have a chance to win this game, that was the route we wanted to take. Gabe, in the first half, especially defensively, was fantastic, and I just wanted to see what that looked like.” Russell went 4-for-12 from the field for 12 points, three assists, and two steals before his evening came to an end."

	Miller had 19 points on the night, with his biggest bucket coming as the clock hit zero.","The Charlotte Hornets are built around a young and exciting 1-2 punch in LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller. On Wednesday night, both of the franchise’s pillars needed to come up big in order for Charlotte to pick up a 108-107 win over the Detroit Pistons, with Miller, in particular, playing the hero in the waning moments of the game. After a turnover by Miller, the Pistons went the other way and got a layup from rookie forward Ron Holland to take a 1-point lead. On the ensuing possession, the Hornets were able to get a good look for Grant Williams, who pulled up from behind the three-point line but was not able to convert. Fortunately for everyone in Charlotte, Miller was able to sneak his way into the lane and clean up the miss. He immediately attempted a layup, which went in and gave the Hornets their third win of the season.  A post shared by SportsCenter (@sportscenter)  It wasn’t the most productive night for Miller, who had 19 points on 6-for-16 shooting with six rebounds and four assists. But he got the biggest two points of the evening, so it’s safe to say that he had a pretty good evening. As for his star running mate, Ball had 25 points, eight assists, six rebounds, and two steals."

	From his rookie year back in 2003 all the way to now, LeBron James has been heavily referenced in hip-hop.","LeBron James is in his 22nd season in the NBA, and has been part of the national basketball consciousness since he was, at least, a junior in high school. His presence as one of the most prominent figures in basketball hasn’t just meant he’s been part of the sports conversation for the last quarter century, but he also became the reference point for basketball in the music world as well.  Similar to Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O’Neal, and Allen Iverson, LeBron has been regularly mentioned by artists in the hip-hop world and beyond. You can find hundreds if not thousands of songs that name-drop LeBron, both positively and negatively, and here we wanted to look at 23 notable examples of LeBron’s impact on the music world by way of the lyrics that shout him out, starting from 2003 all the way to 2024.  I keep a holster on my shoulder like I’m John Wayne/Shooting these n****s lights out like LeBron James One of the first LeBron mentions on a track came early in his rookie year in 2003, when Young Buck says he’s shooting like LeBron, which I have to note is a little funny given shooting was the one thing LeBron rather famously wasn’t very good at as a rookie.  N****s tryna figure out, since Kan’ came/Who the rookie of the year, me or LeBron James? Kanye West, fresh off the release of “College Dropout” earlier that year, boasts his rookie season is as strong as LeBron’s in his verse on this Jadakiss track.  When it comes down to this recording/I must be LeBron James if he’s Jordan/No, I won rings with my performance/I’m more Kobe Bryant of an artist Lil Wayne wouldn’t release “Best Rapper Alive” until 2008 on Tha Carter II, but his remix of Jay-Z’s “Show Me What You Got” two years prior asserted that position in the midst of his iconic mixtape run. To illustrate that fact, he made a reference to LeBron but became one of the first artists to use that as a bit of a jab, saying he’s more Kobe than LeBron because he “won rings with my performance.” I’m not sure what the first RINGZ argument was to be used against LeBron, but I have to imagine Lil Wayne doing so three years into James’ career was one of the earliest.  Banana donk Chevy interior like the Lakers/LeBron James wrist when I’m f**kin’ with that caper What did OJ Da Juiceman know in 2008 when he referenced the Lakers and LeBron James in back-to-back lines??? An aside, OJ Da Juiceman is an underrated Atlanta artist, and this isn’t even his best NBA reference off this album (“Nah Ming” is a classic).  Me? I gotta plug Special Ed, “I Got It Made”/If Jeezy’s payin’ LeBron, I’m payin’ Dwyane Wade Probably the LeBron reference that pops into most people’s heads first when it comes to a rap lyric. By this point, LeBron had passed Michael Jordan in terms of being synonymous with the number 23 in pop culture. The reference is to Jeezy’s “23, 24” in which he says “I used to pay Kobe (24), but now I pay LeBron (23)” in the chorus, with Jay-Z noting that if Jeezy’s paying 23, he’s just paying Dwyane Wade (3). I have to say, there’s no way this was a profitable venture for Jay-Z’s plug if he was getting bricks for $3,000. Also, in hindsight, it’s kind of wild Jay-Z put this bar down a full year before LeBron left Cleveland for Miami to play with Wade.  I’m nothing like these ho-like rappers, my whole life practice/To be the one, what’s it like to be LeBron Another artist who has frequently made mention of LeBron (and plenty of other NBA stars), J. Cole compares himself to LeBron with shouldering expectations to be the greatest in this track off 2009’s “The Warm Up”.  Used to have this white b**ch, she looked like Madonna though/Heard that she f**king LeBron, but s**t, I don’t know/Like that, Bron-Bron? I had that long time ago As mentioned in the intro, not every LeBron reference was the most positive and this was the time where LeBron fatigue had set in a bit. This one, however, had nothing to do with James’ failures to land a ring by 2009, but instead Pusha T offered up some allegations of impropriety in what I have to imagine is one of LeBron’s least favorite mentions he’s ever gotten.  West: Sorry I’m in pajamas, but I just got off the PJ/And last party we had, they shut down Prive
Jay-Z: Ain’t that where the Heat play? (Yup)/N****s hate ballers these days (Yup)
West: Ain’t that like LeBron James?
Jay-Z: Ain’t that just like D-Wade? Wait We probably could’ve pulled 23 references about LeBron just by these two, but in their triumphant track off “Watch The Throne”, Jay-Z and West go back-and-forth with a shoutout to the two stars of the Miami Heat at the time.  Fall back like LeBron’s hairline against the Mavericks…he lost Leave it to Tyler, the Creator to have one of the funnier bars about LeBron James, making both a hairline joke and a Heat losing to the Mavs in the Finals joke all in one line on this track with The Game.  I ball hard like LeBron James/And Rozay D-Wade n**** The LeBron/Wade pairing made for a lot of song references in their time in Miami, this time with Meek Mill comparing he and Rick Ross to the Heat duo — these two also are frequent LeBron name-droppers.  Club jumpin’ like LeBron now, Voli/Order me another round, homie One of the biggest songs in terms of popularity to feature a LeBron reference, courtesy of Mr. Worldwide (formerly Mr. 305), who shouts out the then Heat star in one of his biggest hits.  I’m LeBron James, you a f**kin rookie There are a lot of songs that name-check LeBron but Yo Gotti was one of the first major artists to release a song with James’ name as the title, using his name as a main part of the chorus.  Pay me what you owe me/Ballin’ bigger than LeBron Rihanna was once a regular courtside at NBA games and a noted LeBron fan, so it came as little surprise when she mentioned James in the opening verse of her 2015 hit single.  I’m a fool with the rock like LeBron James For a time there were few groups that were more prevalent at NBA games and All-Star Weekends than the Migos, and Offset led off their 2015 track with a LeBron mention in the opening verse.  Renzel got me all day, I’m Kyrie, he LeBron James By 2017, the references to James and a fellow star teammate had flipped from Dwyane Wade and LeBron to Kyrie and LeBron, which pops up in another Rick Ross track, this time in Wale’s verse.  Catch me cause I’m gone (Outta there, I’m gone)/How I go from 6 to 23 like I’m LeBron? Another artist with plenty of references to LeBron in songs through the years, Drake’s 2018 hit is probably the biggest with a LeBron mention, as he plays off both of LeBron’s numbers from Miami and Cleveland (and L.A.).   Cordae: I bought a Moncler coat for the times we were broke
Paak: I’ma wear it in the summer on LeBron James’ boat This might be one of my favorites because it has nothing to do with basketball, it’s just Paak flaunting that his life is dope enough he might get invited to hang out on a yacht with LeBron.  Dope game, brought the kilos on the plane/23, LeBron James, got my package on the airline, yeah, now A decade after Jeezy’s “23, 24” and Jay-Z’s “Empire State of Mind”, LeBron remained the go-to reference for the number 23 in rap, as Freddie Gibbs proved again on his verse here.  LeBron James, cabrón, yo juego toa’ la’ posicione’/Michael Phelps tirao’ pa’ atrá’, nadando en mi’ millone’ LeBron’s influence in the music world isn’t stateside, as he has been regularly mentioned by Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, including in this 2020 track (along with Michael Phelps).  I go LeBron when it’s crunch time, it ain’t no holdin’ me One thing you notice when you lay these lyrics out chronologically is how the narrative around LeBron changed constantly. If someone had rapped “I go LeBron when it’s crunch time” in a song in, say, 2009 it would’ve had a wildly different meaning than in 2020 when Lil Baby said it boastfully.  Sing-song when I’m walkin’ home/Jump up to the top, LeBron
Further cementing LeBron’s status as a global superstar, he found his way into one of the biggest K-Pop hits with a reference in the opening verse of BTS’ massive 2020 hit.  Ross: In them funny pants, I had a gun in mine
Dre: LeBron James numbers, go ‘head, analyze ’em By 2021, LeBron had climbed to the top of most pages in the NBA’s record books which Dr. Dre referenced in his boastful track going back-and-forth with Rick Ross.  Hey, LeBron, keep the family away, hey, Curry, keep the family away The most sinister of the LeBron mentions comes on Kendrick Lamar’s scathing diss track on Drake from this year, in which he leaves no doubt his feelings on the Toronto star and warns LeBron, Stephen Curry, and others to “keep the family away.”"

But they are determined to make the mogul proud, one up their rivals, and bring the school’s band program into a new era. Though the reaction to the planned performance is mostly love, Mills has gotten a bit of trepidation from alums worried about “protecting certain traditions.” He’s not deterred though, “This yields an opportunity to say ‘Look, I got it.’” Blaze, on the other hand, couldn’t be more excited about the collab. “I’ve been waiting for this moment all my life, and didn’t even realize it until now.” He’s not the only person thoroughly anticipating a great performance. Denise Saunders Thompson, Assistant Dean to the Chadwick Boseman College of Fine Arts, takes time out of her busy schedule to meet Mills, Blaze, and the band on the field to complement and encourage their progress. “Were gonna break the internet with this performance,” she tells the group, hoping to manifest this new standard-setting moment with her words.

Sports,"Bronny James’ Preferential Treatment Comes Into Question, But What If It’s Necessary?",https://www.vibe.com/news/sports/bronny-james-preferential-treatment-comes-into-question-1234950678/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 21:35:12 +0000",An ESPN insider is arguing that James' fame could make his safety an issue on the road.,"Bronny James is the son of arguably the greatest NBA player of all time, LeBron James, so a bit of nepotism was to be expected as the 20-year-old pursued his father’s career. He eventually landed on his dad’s Los Angeles Lakers squad in the second round of this year’s NBA draft. After just a few games, however, he was sent to play in the NBA’s G League to build up his skills.  
	Upon his arrival, it was reported that Bronny would “shuttle” between both teams during an undisclosed period of time and will only be playing in G League home games, as to not fly commercial with his South Bay Lakers teammates. It is also reported that Bronny would be skipping road games due to the team staying at affordable hotels like the Courtyard-Marriott, rubbing many, including former NFL star and podcaster Ryan Clark, the wrong way.

	








 
	On his The Pivot podcast, Clark shared his confusion over Bronny’s ability to skip games due to travel and lodging accommodations when he hasn’t earned his stripes as an athlete just yet.

	“What has Bronny James done that he shouldn’t be able to stay at the Courtyard-Marriott?,” Clark questioned. “You say, ‘well, they fly commercial.’ What has Bronny James done where he should be too good to fly commercial? The pros isn’t about where you came from, how you were raised, what your parents had. Professional sports is about how well you can contribute, and you don’t get treated differently because of your parents.” A post shared by The Neighborhood Talk (@theneighborhoodtalk) 
	Many agree with Clark, including ESPN reporter Brian Windhorst, who believes coddling Bronny now will be “detrimental” to his career, adding that he believes the special treatment the former USC student receives from the Lakers has gone “too far,” The Post reports.   
	Another ESPN insider, however, is arguing that the Lakers are treating Bronny differently because, well, he’s different.  
	“Bronny James isn’t just your normal, everyday G League player,” ESPN’s Shams Charania said on The Pat McAfee Show on Tuesday. 
	“I don’t know if it’s a security thing, but there’s a different level of fanfare when he’s on the road for these G League games, a different level of everything when he’s with that G League team. How do you manage that on the road? I don’t think the door is necessarily completely shut on him playing in those road games as the G League season goes on, but as of right now that is the plan that the Lakers have laid out, and they want him to continue to shuttle back and forth, spend as much time on the active roster as possible.”

Sports,Michael Irvin Believes Mike Tyson-Jake Paul Boxing Match Was “A Lie”,https://www.vibe.com/news/sports/michael-irvin-mike-tyson-jake-paul-boxing-fixed-1234950641/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:09:53 +0000",He shared some rumors he heard during a recent appearance on 'It Is What It Is.',"Mike Tyson and Jake Paul having the first live boxing match on Netflix yielded many conspiracy theories due to the former’s age and the latter’s limited experience. The fight ended up being highly underwhelming for many, and Michael Irvin recently shared his belief that most likely was not an accident. 
	“That fight was a lie,” he said during an appearance on Cam’ron and Ma$e’s popular sports talk show It Is What It Is. He continued, citing how both boxers didn’t seem to be putting in 100% effort and Iron Mike did not utilize a special move in his arsenal. “Everybody’s lying […] they had no intentions to really strap it on. If you look through that, I didn’t see one patented uppercut by Mike Tyson. What did Mike Tyson win on? Uppercut.”

	








 
	The NFL Hall Of Famer revealed rumors he heard that could explain why the fight wasn’t as exciting as it was promoted to be. “I heard some people talking about they couldn’t put [Mike Tyson’s uppercut] in the contract,” he stated. “He couldn’t body and then uppercut. Like, how can you put that in a fight contract?”

	Michael Irvin continued his assessment of the fight and rumored contrast terms by drawing a parallel to his NFL career. “That’s like making me play a game without running a slant route in the deep end or the deep out,” he said. “You do what you do best. If they take that away, you ain’t that dude anymore, and they took that away.” 
DJ Whoo Kid supported Irvin’s claims when he recounted a conversation he had with Jake Paul at a fight after-party, saying, “Legally they each cannot go at each other hard.” Despite being disappointed by how the boxing match went, the former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver was happy to see Mike Tyson secure a large payday. “I’m happy he got every dime, or whatever it is,” he said. “I want him to get his money. I just wanted him to free the beast.” 
	Per the final tally of the fight, Tyson threw 97 punches and only landed 18. Paul threw 278 punches and landed 78. Iron Mike was paid $20 million and Paul got $40 million. One valid explanation for the underwhelming bout is the health issues Tyson dealt with in the lead-up, which made them postpone the match as it was originally booked for July. He suffered from an ulcer flare-up and revealed that he almost died in June. 

	








 
	“This is one of those situations when you lost but still won,” Mike Tyson wrote on X. “I’m grateful for last night. No regrets to get in ring one last time. I almost died in June. Had 8 blood transfusions. Lost half my blood and 25lbs in hospital and had to fight to get healthy to fight so I won. To have my children see me stand toe to toe and finish 8 rounds with a talented fighter half my age in front of a packed Dallas Cowboy stadium is an experience that no man has the right to ask for. Thank you.”

	On Nov. 6, Portis, the Milwaukee Bucks forward released a public message via Instagram pleading for the public’s assistance in locating the stolen items, which he’s willing to pay $40,000 cash for. In the video, Portis spoke of his love for the city of Milwaukee, where he became a resident after signing a deal with the Bucks organization in 2020. 
	“Over the last four-and-a-half seasons, I’ve considered Milwaukee as a home,” Portis, 29, said. “I’ve grown here, I come here a boy and elevated into a man. The love you guys have given me here isn’t something I’ve ever felt before in my NBA career.”

	








 
	He continued, explaining the circumstances behind the burglary, which occurred while Portis was out of town for the Bucks’ matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers earlier this month.

	“While I was at the game yesterday, we had a home invasion and they took most of my prized possessions,” Portis added, expressing the importance that the items, which he did not specify, hold to him and his family. 
	The burglary of Portis’ home marks the latest in a string of home invasions seemingly targeting professional athletes that have occurred in recent months. 
	In September, Minnesota Timberwolves guard Mike Conley’s Minnesota home was broken into and ransacked, with jewelry being listed among the items stolen. Authorities believe the burglary of Portis and Conley’s homes could possibly be connected due to similarities in the two break-ins, despite occurring in neighboring states. 
	NFL stars and reigning Super Bowl champions Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce’s homes were also burglarized in October, within a 48-hour period of one another. While no items were reported as stolen from Mahomes’ residence, the culprits in the burglary of Kelce’s home made off with $20,000 after breaking into the property through a rear door.

	








 
	Drafted in the first round of the 2015 NBA Draft by the Chicago Bulls, Portis has spent time with Bulls, Washington Wizards, and New York Knicks before joining the Bucks, winning a championship with the team in 2021.

	Netflix had its first live boxing event on Friday night (Nov. 15) with a card headlined by the Jake Paul, 27, and Mike Tyson, 58—the widest age disparity in sanctioned boxing history. And the generation divide wasn’t the only stark distinction between the two men. 
	Jake Paul came out to to the ring to Phil Collins’ “In The Air Tonight,” riding in a customized low-rider with his brother Logan Paul. The entrance was jam-packed with thinly veiled jabs at Tyson, with the song referencing the boxer’s appearance in The Hangover, and even a bird, referencing the “Now Kith” meme. Tyson, however, walked out to the ring with pure intention of throwing down and nothing more. And all the built-up tension was released as the two combatants entered the ring for the highly-anticipated showdown. 
	While both Tyson and Paul promised to knock the other boxer out before the 5th round, the match surprisingly went for the entire eight rounds.

Paul kept to a moderate pace throughout the whole match.

	Jake Paul’s even-keeled strategy allowed him to drastically out-punch Tyson throughout the match. By round four, Tyson’s legs looked tired and shaky, which were tell-tale signs of exhaustion for a boxer. 
	As the fight ended in round 8, Jake Paul began bowing to Mike Tyson out of respect for “being an all-time great in this sport” and for “all that he’s done to allow us to be here.” Tyson kept his guard up but gave Paul some dap as he realized the fight was over. In what played out like more of a sparring match than a headlined main attraction, judges declared that Paul was the winner in a unanimous decision. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox"

Kiyan Anthony, Carmelo Anthony‘s son, has made his college decision, and he’s committing to Syracuse University. The young basketball player appeared on Melo’s 7PM in Brooklyn podcast alongside his dad and his mother, La La Anthony, where he broke the news himself. Kiyan had been stewing over his final schools, consisting of USC and Auburn, but felt like ‘Cuse was where he needed to be. 
	Kiyan explained to everyone that what he loved the most about playing for ‘Cuse outside of the connection to his dad were marquee match-ups against universities like Duke and North Carolina. Anthony expressed that the national spotlight would benefit both him and the rest of his teammates who are looking to restore Syracuse to greatness and possible futures in the NBA. “All that played a part into why I chose Syracuse,” Kiyan said on the podcast. 
	“I’m overwhelmed,” La La said following her son’s announcement during the podcast. “I’m happy because he’s happy…It’s big shoes to fill, but at the same time, this is his moment, his lane and his time to create his own reality.”

	Kiyan Anthony also talked to ESPN about his decision, saying, “Ultimately, it came down to my relationship with the staff. From day one, when they started recruiting me, they made me feel like it was family. My dad’s name on the facility is special, but I want to go in there and create my own name, and I’ve already done that through my dedication in the offseason, with early-morning practices, playing at camps, playing on the circuit.” 
	Kiy then spoke about the culture that Coach Adrian Autry is trying to establish with the Orangemen basketball unit. Anthony expressed to the outlet that Autry, who was named the head coach after the 2022-23 season, had already begun getting to work on the 2025 season. 
	“I’m going to do everything Coach Autry needs me to do,” Anthony added. “We talk a lot, especially late at night, about how we can make Syracuse basketball great. Off the court, Coach is super cool. You could go out with him on a Friday night. He’s still young and connects with all his players; he is very relatable.” 
	While Carmelo Anthony only played one season for the Orangemen, his impact on the university is undeniable. 
	During his lone 2003 season, Melo, a freshman, led the Orangemen to a storybook national championship. His performance was one for the ages, with the Brooklyn native being named both an All-American and the NCAA Final Four’s Most Outstanding Player. Kiyan understands the pressure, but wants to carve out his own page in the NCAA history books.

	








 
	According to ESPN, Kiyan Anthony is currently ranked No. 36 in the out of 100 players and “is one of the best pure scorers in the country.”

Thursday (Nov. 14) found the two men doing their final weigh-in and stare down ahead of their Netflix exhibition. Tyson weighed in at 233 pounds and promptly took his spot on stage. Paul was clocked at 220 pounds, a career-high for him, and then began his usual antics. Hitting the stage in a crawling stance, Jake Paul then immediately began running toward Iron Mike, getting directly in his face. 
ESPN reports that around this time, the YouTuber “purposefully” stepped on Tyson’s foot, to which he responded by slapping him in the face. A source close to the event claimed that Mike Tyson had grown “tired” of the content creator’s trash talk in the days leading up to Thursday. So, Paul stepping on the OG’s foot finally set him over the top, resulting in him slapping his opponent. “[Mike Tyson] hits like a bi**h! It’s personal now. He must die!” Paul dramatically screamed to the crowd while Tyson walked away from the stage.

Throughout the event’s rollout, Tyson and Paul have played it fast and loose, keeping the banter semi-playful while throwing in a couple of laughs and jabs here and there. However, as the day of the fight quickly approached, Tyson transformed into something far more intense. On Tuesday (Nov. 12), the boxing legend talked to reporters about the fight, promising to unleash “the devil himself” on Friday night. 
	“I’m bringing the devil himself [to the ring],” Tyson told ESPN. “There are no feelings attached. My own mother should be very careful if she has to get in the ring with me.

Sports,"Carmelo Anthony, Rudy Gay Chime In On Drake-DeMar DeRozan Feud",https://www.vibe.com/news/sports/carmelo-anthony-rudy-gay-drake-demar-derozan-feud-1234943651/,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:22:01 +0000",The biggest topic of the year and all of its subsidiaries continues to make headlines.,"The intersection of Hip-Hop and sports means twice as many people chiming in on topics involving artists and athletes. Former NBA stars Carmelo Anthony and Rudy Gay recently chimed in on the recent back and forth between Drake and DeMar DeRozan, which was a byproduct of the 6 God’s feud with Kendrick Lamar earlier this year. 
	“I think Drake was hurt a little bit because of the relationship he built with DeMar in Toronto,” Melo said on an episode of his show 7PM In Brooklyn. “Representing the 6, Raptors — you know that was a lot of connection with those two. He’s a Raptor for life from a basketball standpoint. Yes, that jersey should be going up.” 

	








 
	Gay, who just recently retired from the NBA, previously played for the Raptors, and is a new recurring co-host on 7PM, disapproved of Drizzy’s behavior. “That’s wack, man. Drake is wack for that,” he asserted. “You gotta pull up on DeMar if you feel that way before you go on camera.” Melo agreed, especially regarding the Toronto rapper’s comments on taking down DeRozan’s banner if the Raptors ever hung one up for him.

	“Drake did a lot when he said I’ma go up there and take it down. That part is a lot,” Carmelo Anthony said. However, he acknowledged that DeRozan turned himself into Drake’s opposition when he joined Kendrick Lamar on stage at The Pop Out concert and appeared in the “Not Like Us” music video. “Those are shots. You my man, we in the crib, we hanging, we building the 6 up. From that standpoint, that would f**k me up, too. I’m gonna feel a way no matter what, but yes, you do have a conversation. As a man, you have a conversation.” 
	Though Rudy Gay did not like the “First Person Shooter” rapper’s actions, he leveled with Anthony on that part. “If you got a problem, come at me,” he said. “To see your man’s out there dancing with the enemy, that’s kinda crazy.” 
	Drake and DeMar DeRozan went viral earlier this month when the For All The Dogs rapper sat courtside for the Toronto Raptors matchup against the Sacramento Kings. At one point, he was interviewed on air and said, “Unfortunately, we’re playing this goof [DeRozan] tonight, but it is what it is” as well as “If you ever put up a DeRozan banner, I’ll go up there and pull it down myself.”

	








 
	After the Raptors defeated the Kings, Drake could be seen mouthing “F**k outta here pu**y” as DeRozan walked off the court. During a post-game press conference, the six-time All-Star was asked about the comments regarding the banner and said, “Well he gon’ have a long way to climb to take it down, so tell him good luck.” 
	This is a significant change in their relationship, just three years after DeRozan said that Drake would “forever have a friend” in him. When he was traded from the Raptors to the Spurs, despite being told he would not be traded, the five-time Grammy winner invited him to his house and gave him support in his time of disappointment. Even after appearing at The Pop Out and in the “Not Like Us” music video, he claimed that he still had love for the OVO head honcho. Those days are seemingly over.

ESPN reports that the rookie NBA player will make his debut with the minor league squad in a Saturday exhibition against Salt Lake City. However, Bronny will be on the Lakers roster for their game on Friday, squaring off against the underperforming Philadelphia 76ers. 
	Sources close to the Lakers state that Bronny will only play for South Bay during their home games. James will then “shuttle” between both teams during an undisclosed period of time. While it may come as a shock to some fans, Lakers head coach JJ Redick explained that this was the plan they had for Bronny “since day one.” 
	Bronny James’ situation isn’t unique to him, either. As he was selected to the Lakers with the 55th pick of the 2024 NBA Draft, it was expected that he would get some burn in the G League. Historically speaking, players selected late in the second tend to spend time in the minor league to get additional coaching, structure in their respective team’s culture, and gain game reps.

	








 A post shared by South Bay Lakers (@southbaylakers) 
	Bronny James has only played in four games this season for the Los Angeles Lakers out of the eight games so far. The Lakers are currently 10th in the Western Conference with their 4-4 record.

EXCLUSIVE: On Aug. 30, Louisiana Tech's women's volleyball team took the court in Fullerton, California, for a season opener against San Jose State and Spartan senior Blaire Fleming at the annual Cal State Fullerton Invitational. Fleming, one of the top players in the entire Mountain West, has been alleged to be a trans athlete and biological male in multiple lawsuits. Louisiana Tech head volleyball coach Amber McCray confirmed to Fox News Digital on Wednesday that she and her team were unaware of these allegations when they played the match against San Jose State on Aug. 30. LA Tech lost in straight sets as Fleming led the game in kills with 14 and total attacks with 29.  A San Jose State spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital on Wednesday that the Northern California-based university did not formally notify the opponents on its volleyball schedule of the situation involving the first lawsuit and the context in it after it was filed in September. The game between San Jose State and LA Tech took place prior to the first lawsuit, amid a few reports of the situation by multiple media outlets.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Brooke Slusser and Blaire Fleming of the San Jose State Spartans call a play during the first set against the Air Force Falcons at Falcon Court at East Gym on Oct. 19, 2024 in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  (Andrew Wevers/Getty Images) The first court documents that alleged Fleming is a trans athlete were filed in late September when teammate Brooke Slusser joined a lawsuit against the NCAA for its policies on gender identity and eligibility. Slusser alleged that San Jose State made an effort to hide Fleming's biological sex from Slusser and other players since Fleming transferred to the school in 2022. Slusser claims she shared changing spaces and a bedroom with Fleming without knowing that information. When asked if San Jose State notified LA Tech of the situation involving Fleming and complaints by players prior to the first court filings, a San Jose State spokesperson noted that Slusser didn't join the lawsuit until September. That spokesperson has declined to confirm whether any notice was given to LA Tech on the situation prior to that.  However, that spokesperson has confirmed that San Jose State has been in communication with all campuses the team visits for away games to coordinate security. Police protection was assigned to the team at the start of October amid alleged threats against Slusser's well-being, Fox News Digital previously reported. Those security efforts include coordinating backup from other police departments when the team travels. News of the first lawsuit and controversy surrounding Fleming's presence on the team spread and prompted a total of seven forfeited matches from five different teams on San Jose State's schedule.  But LA Tech's head volleyball coach and athletic director claims the team did not have the information to make an informed decision on whether they should forfeit. Instead, McCray said the team found out that next day by word from parents who had heard rumors.  McCray and LA Tech athletic director Ryan Ivey first addressed their lack of knowledge of the situation in an email response to a letter from The Concerned Women of America of Louisiana (CWALA) and its State Director Laura Hubber. SAN JOSE STATE'S BROOKE SLUSSER BACKS TRUMP'S TRANS ATHLETES BAN AFTER ALLEGED UNFAIRNESS FROM SCHOOL In Ivey's response, he indicated that the team would have sought ""a different outcome"" if they had known about the allegations in Slusser's lawsuits, which had been previously reported but not officially notified to LA Tech. ""We received no notification prior to the match with San Jose State that a transgender athlete would be competing.  Had we been notified; we would have worked toward a different outcome. I can assure you that providing a safe and equitable environment for our female student-athletes to compete and live out their dreams and ambitions is of the utmost importance to us,"" Ivey wrote in an email addressed from Ivey to Huber that has been obtained by Fox News Digital.  McCray's email response recounted when her team learned of Fleming's birth sex the following day. ""We were not made aware of Blaire Fleming’s situation until the night after our match against San Jose State, so there was no knowledge of the need to prepare our team for this. It was also the very first match of the season, and the one and only match every year we do not have a prepared scouting report on our opponent because there is no video available yet on the current season’s team and thus no research on their current players. While the public revelation about Blaire Fleming came in April 2024, it did not make national news where it was widely circulated until this Fall 2024 season, hence the reason why San Jose State opponents did not forfeit matches in previous years as they have this year,"" McCray wrote.  McCray also said that she believes the host team at the August invitational, Cal State Fullerton, was not aware of Fleming's birth sex either.  ""Host team Cal State Fullerton did not inform us that a transgender student-athlete was competing on one of the teams invited to the tournament. I am also unsure if they were made aware prior to the competition, or if they found out afterwards like we did,"" McCray wrote.  McCray also confirmed that the LA Tech players were kept in a separate and distant locker room from San Jose State's players.  ""I am unsure of San Jose State’s locker room situation, but I know our team was separated from both other teams as our locker room was on the opposite side of the building from both San Jose State and Cal State Fullerton the entire weekend of [Aug. 30 to Aug. 31],"" McCray wrote.  Louisiana became the 18th state in the U.S. to enact a state law to prevent trans inclusion in women's sports in the summer of 2022.  That July, the state passed the Fairness in Women's Sports Act, which requires schools to ""designate intercollegiate and interscholastic athletic teams according to the biological sex of the team members."" It defines ""biological sex"" as the sex listed on a person's birth certificate at the time of their birth. It also explicitly states that teams designated for females are ""not open to participation"" by anyone whose birth certificate said male, which specifically excludes trans girls and women. The law applies to public elementary, middle and high schools, as well as public universities. It will also apply to any private school or university that receives public funds. The law also gives students and others the ability to sue schools who allow trans girls and women to play on female sports teams, and prevents action taken against anyone who reports a school who violates the law. LA Tech's match against San Jose State took place in California, however, where there is a law to protect trans inclusion in women's sports. Concerned Women for America legislative strategist Macy Petty provided a comment to Fox News Digital on the dialogue between LA Tech and the organization.  ""Dozens of female athletes this fall had to find out through news outlets that the institution they’ve been sacrificing their whole lives for stabbed them in the back. Some of them, such as LA Tech, didn’t even know until after they competed in the farce. The almighty administrators are finally having to answer, and we support these girls as they take to the courts. The legal court, that is,"" Petty said.  Slusser has since filed another lawsuit against the Mountain West and is joined by several other players in the conference in alleging the conference and San Jose State have failed to protect female athletes amid Fleming's ongoing inclusion.  An emergency hearing has been scheduled for Thursday in Denver. A judge will determine whether to grant an injunction that seeks to disqualify San Jose State from competing in the conference tournament and disqualify Fleming from competing in the upcoming conference tournament. The injunction is also seeking to remove the losses from the records of five teams who protested by not competing against SJSU.

Seven of its wins and six of its conference wins came via forfeit by opposing teams amid the controversy. Utah State and Boise State are in the tournament picture and could be potential opponents for San Jose State in Las Vegas. They have already taken losses. Boise State accepted two losses after refusing to face Fleming earlier in the season.  A Mountain West spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday that if San Jose State reaches the final in the upcoming tournament, and their opponent in that game forfeits out of protest, that San Jose State would be recognized as conference champions and earn an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament.  San Jose State has repeatedly defended the presence of Fleming on the team.  ""Our athletes all comply with NCAA and Mountain West Conference policies and are eligible to play under the rules of those organizations. Our volleyball team members have earned the right to compete, and we are deeply disappointed for them and with them that they are being denied those opportunities through cancelations and forfeits.

He spent the entire 2024 season with them and ended up in the World Series, in large part due to his success in the Bronx.  But Steinbrenner did ask, without divulging details, what the Yankees' player development system looks like as it plays a large role in how teams perform now and into the future.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,SJSU volleyball team with transgender player will be named conference champion if tournament opponents forfeit,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/sjsu-volleyball-team-trans-player-named-conference-champion-tournament-opponents-forfeit,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 16:49:34 -0500",The Mountain West is prepared to name the San Jose State women&apos;s volleyball team conference champions if an opposing team forfeits the title game of the upcoming tournament.,"San Jose State University's women's volleyball co-captain Brooke Slusser says she is standing up for herself and her team on 'The Ingraham Angle' as sports journalist Michele Tafoya reacts. A heated national controversy over a transgender athlete on the San Jose State women's volleyball team could be the catalyst for a conference title in the upcoming Mountain West Conference tournament.  The tournament is scheduled to begin Nov. 27, and San Jose State is the No. 4 seed. A conference spokesperson told Fox News Digital the conference is preparing a plan in the event teams in the tournament refuse to face San Jose State amid the controversy.  That plan includes the conference's willingness to recognize San Jose State as the Mountain West champion if it reaches the final and the other team in the final forfeits and refuses to play, as conference rules state, the spokesperson confirmed. If that situation does play out, it would also grant San Jose State an automatic bid in the NCAA tournament.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM San Jose State University Spartans head coach Todd Kress speaks with reporters after a loss in an NCAA Mountain West women’s volleyball game against the Colorado State University Rams in Fort Collins, Colo., Oct. 3, 2024. (Santiago Mejia/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images) The decision to forfeit would be left up to the team that would face San Jose State. If the Spartans' opponents make the decision to forfeit, then San Jose State would have to be declared champion.  ""If we get to a championship game, and it's San Jose State vs. whoever, if that institution forfeits the game, then San Jose State wins that match, and then they are tournament champions. And they would be the automatic qualifier out of the Mountain West,"" the spokesperson said.  However, that current system could change very quickly, pending a hearing Thursday.  An emergency hearing has been scheduled for Thursday in Denver. A judge will determine whether to grant an injunction that seeks to disqualify San Jose State from competing in the conference tournament, disqualify Blaire Fleming from competing in the conference tournament and/or remove losses from the records of teams who protested by not competing against SJSU. The conference spokesperson confirmed the conference could have to discard its plan pending the outcome of the hearing.  INSIDE SAN JOSE STATE'S POLICE BATTLE TO PROTECT WOMEN'S ATHLETES THREATENED BY A TRANSGENDER CULTURE WAR San Jose State finished the regular season with a 14-5 record and a 12-5 conference record. Seven of its wins and six of its conference wins came via forfeit by opposing teams amid the controversy.  San Jose State player Brooke Slusser has joined one lawsuit against the NCAA and filed another alongside other Mountain West players against the conference over the alleged presence of her transgender teammate, Blaire Fleming. Slusser has alleged the school deliberately hid Fleming's natural birth sex from her and other players on the team and around the conference.  Slusser previously told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview she and her teammates are unsure about what a potential postseason run might look like as they navigate a demoralized locker room. ""We're just mostly wondering are teams even gonna play us, period, if we go there? Because of just everything that's happened this season,"" Slusser said. ""It seems like every few days it looks like It'll be a fine day and everything's normal and then something else happens. So, I truly do think everyone's just kind of taking things day by day and taking the punches as they come."" San Jose State head volleyball coach Todd Kress has suggested the tension in the locker room may be not be ""a bad thing"" as the team looks to compete for a championship. ""Sometimes tension is not necessarily a bad thing, and I'm not saying that there is. But, you know, when you do have tension or you do have confrontations, I mean, I'm a person that believes that, from confrontation, good things usually happen. We settle our differences, and we work through it,"" Kress told reporters Oct. 3.  After news of the lawsuit and allegations against Fleming began to circulate, San Jose State was dealt several forfeits, including from conference opponents Boise State, Utah State, Wyoming and Nevada. Wyoming and Boise State have each forfeited two matches against the Spartans.  Utah State and Boise State are in the tournament picture and could be potential opponents for San Jose State in Las Vegas. They have already taken losses. Boise State accepted two losses after refusing to face Fleming earlier in the season.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fleming has been one of the top players in the conference and an offensive anchor for San Jose State this season, even amid the controversy. Fleming is third in the conference in average kills per serve with 3.86 and amassed 297 total kills on the year despite playing seven fewer games than expected due to the forfeits. It's helped give San Jose State the third best hitting percentage in the Mountain West.  Slusser alleged in her lawsuit that Fleming's spikes travel more than 80 mph.  ""Brooke estimates that Fleming’s spikes were traveling upward of 80 mph, which was faster than she had ever seen a woman hit a volleyball,"" Slusser’s complaint states. ""The girls were doing everything they could to dodge Fleming’s spikes but still could not fully protect themselves."" Fleming previously set a single-match record at John Champe High School with 30 kills in a match and a single-season record of 266 kills for the school's girls volleyball team. Footage from the athlete's Hudl page of the school-record 30-kill match in September 2019 shows how hard and fast Fleming's spikes came down at the high school level against female opponents. President-elect Trump went out of his way to comment about footage of one of Fleming's plays in which the player spiked a ball at San Diego State player Keira Herron in a match earlier this season. ""I saw the slam. It was a slam. I never saw a ball hit so hard,"" Trump said during a Fox News town hall. ""But other people, even in volleyball, they’ve been permanently — I mean, they've been really hurt badly. Women playing men."" San Jose State's team has had no reservations about making Fleming the centerpiece of the offense amid the ongoing controversy. The team mobbed Fleming in celebration after a game-winning service ace against rival Colorado State in their senior day match Nov. 16.  San Jose State has repeatedly defended the presence of Fleming on the team.  ""Our athletes all comply with NCAA and Mountain West Conference policies and are eligible to play under the rules of those organizations. Our volleyball team members have earned the right to compete, and we are deeply disappointed for them and with them that they are being denied those opportunities through cancellations and forfeits. We are also proud of how they have persevered through these challenges on the court,"" a statement provided to Fox News Digital by a university spokesperson said.

The crew question how much is Aaron Rodgers responsible and what's next for the Jets? Davante Adams likely didn't think the New York Jets would be in a similar situation as the Las Vegas Raiders when he requested a trade to reunite with his good friend Aaron Rodgers, but that's where the team finds itself at 3-8 after yet another loss.  Adams hasn't been the spark expected for the Jets, as he and Rodgers continue to work on getting on the same page. It appears to be too late for this season, though, with GM Joe Douglas now out the door at One Jets Drive with ownership clearing house.  Making his weekly appearance on FanDuel TV's ""Up & Adams,"" host Kay Adams spoke to the veteran wide receiver about the Jets' situation, specifically wondering whether he regrets wanting to be traded to New York.

(AP Photo/Dennis Waszak Jr.) ""No, I don't live my life like that,"" Davante answered. ""You'll drive yourself crazy. Hindsight is always 20/20, so you can sit here now and look at it and say, ‘Oh, I could’ve maybe stayed there, would've been more comfortable, wouldn't have to move,' and all that stuff. But for me, it's about going with my gut in my life, and that's how I made my decisions. I live with them."" Davante also explained that this decision to reunite with Rodgers, who he spent successful years with on the Green Bay Packers, was never a gamble. He views it as a calculated decision that simply hasn't worked out in his favor yet.  JETS OWNER WOODY JOHNSON FLOATED BENCHING AARON RODGERS BEFORE FIRING COACH, GM: REPORT ""We're talking about playing with Aaron Rodgers here, too,"" he explained. ""This isn't like taking some crazy gamble, going somewhere with some rookie that's unproven. Neither of us have played what we're capable of playing.  ""But when you're rolling the dice, you'd hope that it's favoring you move. When you got trick dice, it still may not work. We're trying to do everything we can, and we're still going."" Adams, Rodgers and the rest of the Jets' roster may still be going, but there are loads of questions heading into this NFL offseason after how everything unfolded in 2024.  New York Jets wide receiver Davante Adams runs with the ball against the Indianapolis Colts at MetLife Stadium. (Brad Penner-Imagn Images) With six games still to play, the Jets have moved on from their GM and head coach, and reports are coming from left and right talking about how owner Woody Johnson wanted Rodgers benched, while New York reportedly wants to move on from the four-time MVP quarterback after this season as well.  Adams restructured his contract when he came over to the Jets with the expectation they would have a conversation about how to keep him in the building with Rodgers for the foreseeable future.  If Rodgers is gone, or perhaps retires from the game, would Adams still want to remain in New York? There is an opt-out clause for the Jets after this season.  In the meantime, Adams and Rodgers are simply trying to finish the season strong, even if the playoffs appear out of reach.  New York Jets wide receiver Davante Adams scores a touchdown against the Houston Texans, Oct. 31, 2024, in East Rutherford.

U.S. men’s soccer star Christian Pulisic faced criticism for his decision to perform president-elect Donald Trump’s dance as a goal celebration on Monday night against Jamaica. Pulisic told reporters afterward he ""thought it was funny"" and said the dance moves were not ""political"" in nature. The U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF) did not address Pulisic’s dance but cut that part of the clip out when reposting the score on its social media accounts. However, anonymous USSF officials expressed dismay to The Athletic on Tuesday.

Another employee added that the organization has ""more pressing things to worry about."" Forbes columnist Ian Nicholas Quillen and The Athletic writer Jeff Reuter also warned the soccer star to ""consider the impact"" of the dance move and why he ""may come to regret"" it. Quillen suggested Pulisic’s Trump-inspired grooves could lead to questions over which players deserve to be on the U.S. team given the president-elect’s stance on immigration. Tim Weah and Yunus Musah qualify for the team based on birthright citizenship, and it was suggested the dance could open Pulisic and other members to questions about eligibility. ""But all things being equal, Pulisic and his American teammates would probably rather the focus stay on the soccer they play,"" he added. ""On Monday night, their captain made that tougher."" Reuter wrote Pulisic should have taken a page from other leaders and ""consider how their actions will be perceived by their teammates and others.""

""He may not realize how Trump’s views on immigration could impact his dual-national teammates and their families. Regardless, this is a case where a dance conveys a meaning well beyond a simple gesture. With his nation co-hosting the World Cup in 2026, having the captain and face of the USMNT paying homage to Trump carries outsized subtext, intended or not. ""It doesn’t matter if Pulisic wants that responsibility to consider perception. That comes with being a leader. He can cite eagerness to embrace that type of role but in light of Monday’s dance move, he’d be wise to consider what that distinction truly entails."" Pulisic scored two goals in the Nations League win over Jamaica. He remarked about the dance after the match. ""Well, obviously that’s the Trump dance,"" he said, via The Athletic.

U.S. soccer star Christian Pulisic went viral on Monday night when his goal against Jamaica in the Nations League sparked his own version of a President-elect Donald Trump-inspired dance. The viral dance move has been seen across the sports spectrum. The NFL told Fox News Digital it would not yield a punishment against players from the league.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Fox News Digital Sports NFL power rankings after Week 11 of 2024 NFL season,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/fox-news-digital-sports-nfl-power-rankings-after-week-11-2024-nfl-season,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 04:00:10 -0500",The Kansas City Chiefs lost their first game of the season last weekend. The Chiefs are now faced with the question of how far have they fallen in the NFL power rankings.,"Keyshawn Johnson breaks down the Detroit Lions' dominant 52-6 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars and declares they're the best team in the NFL. The Detroit Lions have finally broken through and surged to the top of the Fox News Digital Sports NFL power rankings after Week 11. The Lions demolished the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday, putting up at least 50 points on their opponent for the second time this season. With the Kansas City Chiefs’ undefeated season coming to an end, the Lions have performed well enough to move up to the top spot. There’s a lot more that had to shake out. The Buffalo Bills defeated the Chiefs, which could catapult them up the rankings. And just how far will the Chiefs fall? Read below to find out the rest of the rankings. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Lions wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown celebrates his nine-yard touchdown reception with fans during the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Detroit. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) For the first time in the history of Fox News Digital's NFL power rankings, and likely many others across the web, the Detroit Lions are the kings. With a loss by Kansas City and a day of dominance in Jacksonville, the Lions have as much momentum as they've ever had in the Super Bowl era. Last week: 2 Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen (17) is congratulated by teammate Dawson Knox after scoring on a 26-yard run during the second half of an NFL football game against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Orchard Park, N.Y. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson) It wasn’t the AFC Championship, but it sure felt like it for Bills fans after Buffalo overpowered the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday afternoon to hand the back-to-back champions their first loss of the season. With most of the division in shambles, the Bills are primed to win the AFC East for the fifth straight season, but more importantly, they seem primed to make a serious run for the Super Bowl. Last week: 3 Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is sacked by Buffalo Bills linebacker Terrel Bernard during the first half of an NFL football game on Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Orchard Park, N.Y. (AP Photo/Jeffrey T. Barnes) It finally happened, for the first time since last Christmas, the Kansas City Chiefs lost a game. Any time the Buffalo Bills have matched up with the Chiefs over the past few seasons, the games have typically been thrillers. However, the Bills being able to knock off the Chiefs proved to be a noticeable difference from recent matchups. Even during the Chiefs first nine wins, much of the conversation has revolved around whether Kansas City was playing its best football. Patrick Mahomes has not looked like the best quarterback in the world this season. While he threw three touchdowns during the Nov. 17 game, he also finished the day with two interceptions, including a pick late in the fourth quarter to end any hopes of a Chiefs comeback. The 30-21 loss also meant the Chiefs will have to wait a bit longer for an opportunity to wrap up the top playoff seed in the AFC. But recent history suggests Kansas City is not reliant on the No. 1 seed as two of the three Super Bowl championships under head coach Andy Reid have been earned without the team holding the top seed. Last week: 1 Eagles running back Saquon Barkley scores during the second half of an NFL football game against the Washington Commanders on Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum) The Eagles had a ""Thursday Night Football"" matchup that everyone wanted to see, with Jayden Daniels and the Commanders heading into ""The Linc"" to play for first place in the division. Though Jalen Hurts didn’t really get going in the pass game, it was Saquon Barkley yet again stepping up when his team needed it, scoring two fourth-quarter touchdowns to cement the team’s sixth straight win. It seems like ages ago when questions about whether this highly talented team could really get going, as they are one of the hottest teams in the NFL. Last week: 5 Steelers quarterback Russell Wilson (3) reacts with teammates Najee Harris, left, and Darnell Washington at the end of an NFL football game against the Baltimore Ravens, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Pittsburgh. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) They beat the Ravens without scoring a touchdown, which is hard to do in the NFL, but not in that matchup because the Steelers dominate the Ravens, having won eight out of the last nine games.  Last week: 6 Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson speaks to reporters following an NFL football game against the Steelers, Nov. 17, 2024, in Pittsburgh. (AP Photo/Matt Freed) We're good. We're middling. We're good. We're not so good. We're good again. They need to make up their minds. Last week: 4 Minnesota Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold runs off the field after an NFL football game against the Titans, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Nashville, Tenn. (AP Photo/George Walker IV) The Vikings finished up their cupcake slate and looked just good enough to stay within striking distance of first place in the NFC North. Still, how the team looked in non-blowout wins against the lowly Titans and Jaguars shows that they are still a class below Detroit, especially after the Lions' real blowout against Jacksonville this week. Last week: 8 Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert high-fives running back J.K. Dobbins before an NFL football game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Inglewood, Calif. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull) The Chargers put together arguably their best first half of the season when they hosted the Cincinnati Bengals this past Sunday night. But the second half was a different story. Nevertheless, Los Angeles held off a furious rally from the Bengals and secured their seventh win of the season. Cincinnati made it a 27-27 game after Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert fumbled the ball in the fourth quarter. But Herbert later completed a pair of clutch passes to Ladd McConkey that helped set up J.K. Dobbins’ 29-yard touchdown run with 18 seconds remaining. The Chargers welcome another high-powered offense this week when they host Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens. Last week: 11 Green Bay Packers Jayden Reed (11) celebrates his touchdown catch with Christian Watson (9) and John FitzPatrick during the first half of an NFL football game against the Bears on Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) It's hard to judge how good this Packers team is after a win against the Bears. It is so expected that coming as close as they did to losing to Chicago is almost cause for an indictment on Green Bay. The Packers will be easier to judge after games against the 49ers and Lions in the next three weeks. Last week: 9 Houston Texans running back Joe Mixon (28) and quarterback C.J. Stroud celebrate Mixon's touchdown run against the Dallas Cowboys during the first half of an NFL football game, Monday, Nov. 18, 2024, in Arlington, Texas. (AP Photo/Jerome Miron) Joe Mixon is putting up the best season of his career, and now that Nico Collins is healthy, this team will only be getting better. C.J. Stroud has had a bit of a sophomore slump, but a light schedule coming up could get him back on track. Last week: 12 Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels is sacked by Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham during the first half of an NFL football game on Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum) A true test came on Thursday night for Jayden Daniels & Co., and though it was close early, Saquon Barkley showed up late with two touchdowns to virtually ice it for the Eagles. Washington has now dropped two straight, falling to second place in the division. They have another divisional matchup this week with the Cowboys, a game that head coach Dan Quinn surely wants to win considering his ties to the organization last season as their defensive coordinator. Last week: 7 Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray greets fans after an NFL football game against the New York Jets, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Glendale, Ariz. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson) NFC West first place by itself coming out of the bye week is not a bad place to be for Arizona. Back-to-back road games in Seattle and Minnesota will tell us if Kyler Murray & Co. are for real. Last week: 13 Broncos quarterback Bo Nix (10) runs as Atlanta Falcons cornerback Natrone Brooks pursues during the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Denver. (AP Photo/Jack Dempsey)  The Broncos completed their 4-0 sweep of the NFC South with a dominant 38-6 win over the Falcons. Bo Nix threw for over 300 yards and four touchdowns as he continues to look better and better every week, firmly putting himself in the Offensive Rookie of the Year conversation. Sitting at 6-5 with their next three games coming against the Raiders, Browns and Colts, the Broncos have their eyes set on making a playoff push. Last week: 16 San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy walks off the field after an NFL football game against the Seattle Seahawks in Santa Clara, Calif., Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024. (AP Photo/Jed Jacobsohn) You know what this banged up team doesn’t need? Back-to-back road trips to playoff-contending teams, uh-oh, at Green Bay and at Buffalo are coming right up. Last week: 10 Seattle Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith reacts after scoring against the San Francisco 49ers during the second half of an NFL football game in Santa Clara, Calif., Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. Vásquez) The roller-coaster ride that is Seattle this season continued last week. Stopping a six-game skid to San Francisco was a high point for sure. Can the Seahawks finally find consistency? Last week: 19 Atlanta Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins runs off the field after an NFL football game on Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Denver. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) Atlanta was destroyed in Week 11 by the Denver Broncos, and the team’s weak defense was badly exposed. They’re still in position to win the division due to their perfect record against NFC South opponents, but this is not a team that should be feared come playoff time. Last week: 14 Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Cooper Kupp (10) is congratulated after his touchdown against the New England Patriots during the first half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Foxborough, Mass. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer) Remember last year? The Rams started 3-6 before clawing back to .500 and rolling into the playoffs on a hot streak. This year’s version has a similar vibe, especially if they can get past the Eagles at home on Sunday night. Last week: 18 Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield passes against the San Francisco 49ers during the second half of an NFL football game in Tampa, Fla., Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024. (AP Photo/Chris OMeara) The bye week came at a perfect time, and with Atlanta continuing to struggle, Tampa Bay must believe it is the best team in the NFC South despite being 1.5 games back. They have upcoming games against three of the worst teams in the league (Giants, Panthers, Raiders), and if they can win all three, the division race gets extremely interesting. Last week: 17 Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow throws as he is tackled by Los Angeles Chargers linebacker Daiyan Henley during the second half of an NFL football game on Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Inglewood, Calif. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull) They are wasting an MVP season by Joe Burrow. Last week: 15 Miami Dolphins tight end Jonnu Smith, center, celebrates his touchdown with wide receivers Tyreek Hill (10) and Jaylen Waddle during the first half of an NFL football game against the Las Vegas Raiders, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Miami Gardens, Fla. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell) The Dolphins' biggest offensive stars haven’t been putting up numbers as expected, but Miami is still winning down the stretch, picking up their second-straight win with a dominant 34-19 win over the Raiders. Last week: 20 Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson reacts after scoring a touchdown against the New York Jets during the fourth quarter of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in East Rutherford, N.J. (AP Photo/Adam Hunger) Maybe Anthony Richardson needed a break and take a good look in the mirror. And perhaps it was smart of the Colts to get him back against the lowly Jets, since nothing is going right for Gang Green. The fourth overall pick of the 2023 draft showed what he could be, but it’s too early to say he’s here to stay. Last week: 22 Bears Caleb Williams walks off the field after an NFL football game against the Green Bay Packers on Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) It's been a humbling stretch for a Bears team that started off with so much hope. A heartbreaking loss to the Packers could either be rock bottom or the straw that breaks their back into a losing streak that buries them, especially with games against the other playoff contenders in their division coming up. Last week: 21 New Orleans Saints tight end Taysom Hill, left, celebrates a touchdown with quarterback Derek Carr in the second half of an NFL football game in New Orleans, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) The Saints followed their upset win over the Falcons with a 21-point victory over lowly Cleveland. Their hopes of getting the No. 1 pick in the NFL Draft are probably dead, but the team is playing hard under interim coach Darren Rizzi, and the Saints could be a spoiler team come December. Last week: 24 Dallas Cowboys wide receiver CeeDee Lamb reacts during the second half of an NFL football game against the Houston Texans, Monday, Nov. 18, 2024, in Arlington, Texas. (AP Photo/Gareth Patterson) There’s not much else to say about Dallas as they’ve now lost five straight games after a beatdown by the Houston Texans at AT&T Stadium. The metal sheet falling from the dome hours before the game could be a metaphor for how this Cowboys season is crumbling around Jerry Jones & Co. Last week: 25 New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers walks off the field after the Jets lost an NFL football game to the Indianapolis Colts, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in East Rutherford, N.J. (AP Photo/Adam Hunger) Another loss for the Jets has triggered yet another shakeup within the organization as owner Woody Johnson decided to call it quits with general manager Joe Douglas on Tuesday. At 3-8 and with their playoff aspirations all but gone, who’s on the chopping block next? Last week: 23 New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye scrambles against the Los Angeles Rams during the first half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Foxborough, Mass. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer) Drake Maye put on a show, completing 30-of-40 passes for 282 yards and two touchdowns, but it wasn’t enough for New England to overcome the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday. Poor execution and a nonexistent defense have the Patriots looking toward the draft for solutions. Last week: 26 Cleveland Browns quarterback Jameis Winston (5) is tackled by Saints defensive end Chase Young (99) and defensive tackle Bryan Bresee in the second half of an NFL football game in New Orleans, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) Blown out by the Saints on Sunday, and then they get to play the division-leading Steelers on Thursday — not a wonderful week.  Last week: 27 Carolina Panthers quarterback Bryce Young celebrates after an overtime win in an NFL football game against the New York Giants, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Munich. (AP Photo/Lennart Preiss) The Panthers had a bye in Week 11 after back-to-back victories, but things get a lot tougher the rest of the way. Carolina has to play the Chiefs, Bucs and Eagles over the next three weeks. They are still in play for the top pick in the NFL Draft, which has to be the goal at this point, especially given their schedule down the stretch. Last week: 28 Tennessee Titans quarterback Will Levis walks off the field after an NFL football game against the Minnesota Vikings, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Nashville, Tenn. (AP Photo/George Walker IV) Against a Sam Darnold who has been looking a bit like the old Sam Darnold in recent weeks, the Titans mustered up just 13 points. There are a lot of bad teams in the league this year, and Tennessee is right in the pack of them. Last week: 30 Jacksonville Jaguars head coach Doug Pederson talks to the media after an NFL football game against the Lions, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Detroit. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) Allowing 52 points is unacceptable no matter what. A bad team with Trevor Lawrence only gets worse when he’s injured. Mac Jones has scored just one touchdown – a rushing score of his own – since he took over. Last week: 29 New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones watches during the second half of an NFL football game against the Carolina Panthers, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Munich. (AP Photo/Lennart Preiss) This bye week for New York was a true team evaluation, and what was already written on the walls was confirmed by head coach Brian Daboll. Daniel Jones’ time in New York is all but done as he was demoted to third string and Tommy DeVito, the fan favorite who won three games for New York last season, will be the starter moving into Week 12 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. While that may get fans in seats for John Mara, the organization is already thinking to the future with their franchise quarterback being a bust. Last week: 32 Las Vegas Raiders tight end Brock Bowers runs for a touchdown during the second half of an NFL football game against the Miami Dolphins, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Miami Gardens, Fla. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) Despite making a litany of changes to the offensive coaching staff over the bye week, the Raiders still lost 34-19 to the Dolphins. One of the few bright spots on the 2-8 Raiders is rookie tight end Brock Bowers. Bowers is already one of the best tight ends in the NFL, catching 13 passes for 126 yards and a touchdown in the loss.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Dolphins' Jonnu Smith says teammate Calais Campbell is 'like the LeBron James of the NFL',https://www.foxnews.com/sports/dolphins-jonnu-smith-says-teammate-calais-campbell-like-lebron-james-nfl,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024 23:29:36 -0500",Calais Campbell has spent the past 17 NFL seasons sacking quarterbacks. One of the Miami Dolphins offensive stars appreciates the opportunity to play on the same team as Campbell.,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The Miami Dolphins have battled their fair share of turbulence this season. At one point, the Dolphins owned a 2-6 record. However, quarterback Tua Tagovailoa's return from injury has stabilized the team's offense and helped Miami win its last two games.  During the offseason, former Miami Hurricanes star Calais Campbell decided to return to South Florida and signed with the Dolphins. The six-time Pro Bowler is in the midst of his 17th NFL season, and the experienced veteran defensive tackle has made a profound impact on the 2024 Dolphins — if you ask one of his teammates. Tight end Jonnu Smith recently praised Campbell, 38, for continuing to showcase his ability to be a key contributor.

(Sam Navarro-Imagn Images) ""Calais is one of my favorite teammates in all the sports that I've played,"" Smith said during an appearance on ""The Pat McAfee Show."" Campbell recorded his fourth sack of the year during Miami's 34-19 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 11. Campbell's four sacks are the most by any player on the Dolphins roster this season. He now has 109.5 career sacks. WHY COWBOYS SHOULD GO ALL-IN FOR DEION, SHEDEUR SANDERS DESPITE DAK PRESCOTT'S CONTRACT The veteran defensive lineman has also played an important role in Miami's run defense. However, Campbell's impact extends beyond the football field. The 2019 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year has brought more leadership to the Dolphins locker room. Miami Dolphins defensive tackle Calais Campbell, #93, leaves the field after the game against the Los Angeles Rams at SoFi Stadium on Nov. 11, 2024 in Inglewood, California. (Kirby Lee-Imagn Images) ""He's like the LeBron James of the NFL right now as far as his age and the production that he brings to the game, still playing at a high level. I mean, the guy is 1,000 years old and playing like he's 21."" Campbell is among the short list of NFL athletes who have played the defensive lineman position who have been able to continue playing — let alone make an impact — once they reach their late-30s.  Sep 8, 2024; Miami Gardens, Florida, USA; Miami Dolphins defensive tackle Calais Campbell, #93, celebrates after the game against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Hard Rock Stadium on Sept. 8, 2024 in Miami Gardens, Florida. (Sam Navarro-Imagn Images) Smith, who was also teammates with Campbell in Atlanta with the Falcons last season, then described Campbell as the ""best leader"" he has been around. If Campbell is able to log two more sacks over the course of the Dolphins' seven remaining games, he will pass former Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald for 40th on the all-time list.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Washington school board begs state to keep trans athletes out of girls' sports after girls were affected,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/washington-school-board-begs-state-keep-trans-athletes-out-girls-sports-after-girls-were-affected,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024 20:42:45 -0500",A school board in Washington passed a resolution urging its athletic conference to reconsider its stance on trans inclusion in girls sports.,"OutKick contributor Riley Gaines joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss her reaction to the 'alarming' number of medals lost as 200 female golfers sign a letter to the LPGA raising concerns over its transgender athlete policy.  A public school board in Washington state passed a resolution on Tuesday urging its athletic conference to reconsider its current policies that allow trans athletes to compete in girls' sports. The Central Valley School Board, which oversees schools in Spokane Valley and Liberty Lake, Washington, voted to send a message to the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA) over the issues after much debate at a school board meeting. The resolution, titled ""Supporting Equity and Safety in Female Sports,"" claims that the entire board is comprised of female members who have either competed in athletics themselves or have daughters who competed in athletics. One of those women, an unidentified current cross country runner, shared her experience of having to compete against one of those athletes during the hearing. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM ""When I ran cross country for Greenacres Middle School, a boy who was biologically male but identified as female competed on the girls' team,"" she said. ""While I respect everyone's right to participate in sports, the situation made me question the fairness of competing of someone who had the physical advantage associated with male biology."" Still, some speakers expressed opposition to the bill. One speaker, a parent named Dr. Pam Kohlmeier, shared her experience of losing a child to suicide amid opposition to trans inclusion.  ""It was two years ago to the date when i addressed this board, but than it was an anti-trans policy about bathrooms, and I shared at that time don't know how many of you were here at that time. My Katie died by suicide that fall. This is a real issue. It is hurting real people every single time it is debated,"" Kohlmeier said. But ultimately, the board ruled in favor of the resolution.  The board passed its resolution and by doing so sent an official letter to the WIAA and Washington state legislators. ""Students born male, including transgender girls or non-binary boys, have a biological advantage over students born female. Therefore, unless a sport category is deemed co-ed, those born male should continue to be welcome to enjoy fair play within male sport categories,"" the resolution reads.  ""As our legislators, we respectfully urge you to address current inequalities and safety concerns effecting girls’ and women’s sports before further injury or loss of opportunities occur."" Washington, as a long-time deep-blue Democrat stronghold, has state laws in place to protect trans inclusion in girls' and women's sports.  The WIAA policy states that each athlete will participate in programs ""consistent with their gender identity or the gender most consistently expressed,"" and there are not even any medical or legal requirements. Bills that would prohibit transgender girls from participating in girls' and women's sports have been introduced but not passed. Washington's west coast relatives, Oregon and California, as well as Nevada, all have similar laws.  MOUNTAIN WEST CLOSES INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGATIONS AGAINST SAN JOSE STATE TRANS PLAYER WITHOUT DISCIPLINE In the U.S., 23 states have laws in place to restrict or prevent transgender inclusion in girls' and women's sports. However, federal interference by the Biden-Harris administration and multiple federal judges who were appointed by Obama have allowed it to happen anyway.  In April, the Biden-Harris administration issued a sweeping rule that clarified that Title IX’s ban on ""sex"" discrimination in schools covers discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and ""pregnancy or related conditions."" And while the administration insisted the regulation does not address athletic eligibility, multiple experts presented evidence to Fox News Digital in June that it would ultimately put more biological men in women's sports.  Democrats have tried to push forward the Equality Act, which was proposed in 2019 and has had revisions that ""would force public schools to allow biologically male athletes who identify as transgender on girls sports teams."" In March 2023, Democrats advocated for a transgender bill of rights, proposing a resolution ""recognizing that it is the duty of the Federal Government to develop and implement a Transgender Bill of Rights."" Multiple U.S. states have their own laws to restrict or prevent transgender inclusion in women's sports. However, even some of the states with those laws have had incidents where transgender inclusion in girls' sports was enabled via the ruling of a federal judge.

(Brett Coomer/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images) Judges Landya McCafferty in New Hampshire and M. Hannah Lauck of Virginia, both of whom were appointed during the Obama administration, each issued rulings this year that enabled biological males to play on high school girls soccer and tennis teams. McCafferty issued an order that allowed two transgender athletes to compete in New Hampshire, while Lauck ruled that an 11-year-old transgender tennis player was allowed to compete against girls the same age in Virginia.  However, it's an issue that has recently divided the Democratic Party amid the recent red wave election results. Many in the party who have signed the bills that would allow trans inclusion in girls' and women's sports at a federal level have backpedaled in their stance and even denounced the idea in recent months. These include Texas Rep. Colin Allred and Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton.  And now, citizens in West Coast blue strongholds like Washington and California are standing up to it.  Over the weekend, Stone Ridge Christian High School, located in Merced, California, forfeited its state playoff match because its opponent ""has a male athlete playing for their team,"" the school said.  Now the Central Valley School Board has continued that trend.  Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

The Post previously reported that the show’s cancellation was under consideration by company brass.  An ESPN spokesperson declined to comment. “Around the Horn” launched in 2002, hosted by Max Kellerman, as the “show that scored the argument,” pitting sportswriters from across the country against each other for who had the best takes on the stories of the day. Tony Reali took over for Kellerman in 2004 when Kellerman left to host a show on the now-defunct Fox Sports Net, and has been at the helm ever since.  Since its inception, “Around the Horn” has been paired with “Pardon the Interruption” in the “Happy Hour” from 5-6 p.m. ET, and the shows have gotten great ratings throughout their tenures. “PTI” creator and executive producer Erik Rydholm has also overseen “Around the Horn” since Reali became host in 2004.  One source said that ESPN and Rydholm’s team will discuss new concepts to replace “Around the Horn” in the time slot.  The mainstay panelists on “Around the Horn” over the years have included Bob Ryan, Woody Paige, Tim Cowlishaw, Kevin Blackistone, J.A. Adande and Bill Plaschke with myriad others joining the show, including Jemele Hill, Pablo Torre, Bomani Jones and Ramona Shelburne.  The show, which for years has been produced by Aaron Solomon, will have a well-deserved victory lap in the coming months."

There’s no question that its recent struggles stem from not having Kevin Durant available due to a calf injury.  For all the criticism Durant receives about his leadership qualities, his play on the court remains unparalleled.  The Suns have completely fallen apart without the two-time champion.  Yet, the biggest surprise is that Phoenix’s other superstar, Devin Booker, hasn’t been able to string together quality performances in Durant’s absence.  Aside from a 44-point effort against the Timberwolves, Booker is averaging just 15.7 points in the other three games during this losing streak.  The Knicks are deep enough to pose problems for the Suns defense.  New York lists four players scoring at least 16 points per game, paced by Karl-Anthony Towns at 26.2, and ranks third in efficiency with 121.1 points per 100 possessions.  While the Knicks have an 8-6 record, their Pythagorean Expectation suggests their record should be closer to 10-4.  As a result, there’s still some untapped potential with this Knicks team, especially if they’ll be facing the shorthanded Suns.  THE PLAY: Knicks, -4.5 (-115, BetRivers) Michael Arinze handicaps most major sports for the New York Post. He’s cashed two 15-leg teasers in his betting career as well as a 12-leg parlay that included eight Little League World Series games.

The Indiana Fever star has declined an offer to play in Unrivaled Basketball, the new 3-on-3 league set to debut in January 2025, ESPN reported Wednesday evening.  The news comes just hours after the league unveiled its six teams’ rosters and coaching assignments during a 22-minute YouTube livestream.  With two open spots remaining in the league, some had speculated that the video’s length was a nod to Clark’s No. 22 Fever jersey.  That detail, though, now appears to be nothing more than a quirky coincidence.  Clark reportedly turned down a $1 million offer to join the league, co-founded by WNBA stars Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier. The Athletic reported, though, that Clark’s invite will remain on the table on the off chance she changes her mind.  But if there’s anyone who could use some time away from the court and spotlight, perhaps it’s Clark, who’s coming off a record-setting rookie campaign. Clark averaged a rookie-best 19.2 points and 8.4 assists per game. She also grabbed 5.7 rebounds per game while shooting 41.7 percent from the field and 34.4 percent from 3-point range en route to nearly unanimously winning the 2024 Rookie of the Year award.  It’s also notable that Clark had only a little break between Iowa’s NCAA Tournament run to the national championship game and the WNBA preseason starting up.  She also became a lightning rod in the WNBA, with some of her most passionate fans rallying to her defense on the physicality she faced.  Clark has hit the green this offseason. Last week, she participated in the pro-am for The Annika LPGA tournament. And on Wednesday, she made an appearance at the RSM Classic Pro-Am.  Clark is also scheduled to be a guest speaker at a major women’s sports awards luncheon in Kansas City on Feb. 4 which will celebrate National Girls and Women in Sports Day. Who takes the last two spots on Unrivaled remains to be seen. The league will tip off in Miami on Jan. 17."
"NY Post Sports – Latest News, Scores, Stats & Videos",Michael Kay’s ESPN radio future up in the air with contract running out,https://nypost.com/2024/11/20/sports/michael-kays-espn-radio-future-up-in-the-air-with-contract-up/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 17:48:11 -0500",Could Michael Kay be saying “See Ya!” to his ESPN New York radio show?,"Could Michael Kay be saying “See Ya!” to his ESPN New York radio show?  The future of “The Michael Kay Show” is up in the air while ESPN and Kay negotiate a new deal, with his existing one ending in the middle of next month, The Athletic’s Andrew Marchand reported Wednesday. Kay has hosted the program since 2002 and has turned it into a staple of sports talk radio in New York City for the better part of two decades.  ESPN is said to have a desire to keep Kay with the station and in the drive-time slot — a time period generally considered to be between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. in the afternoon by the radio industry — however, there hasn’t been a “concrete offer” made to him, the report stated. A number of scenarios could play out in terms of Kay’s time slot on ESPN New York, which abandoned its FM band on 98.7 FM earlier this year and moved to 880 AM, which had formerly been WCBS-AM.  The possibility remains that Kay could stay on the air with a lighter workload and move to the 1-3 p.m. slot that would have him host solo while working from home, according to the report. Whatever occurs with “The Michael Kay Show” won’t have any impact on his position as the TV voice of the Yankees, though there is a lack of clarity over whether the show would continue to be simulcast on YES Network. Any potential change with “The Michael Kay Show” would mean a ripple effect throughout ESPN New York’s lineup, which could include Don La Greca being pared with Alan Hahn in the afternoon slot if Kay moved to middays. Bart Scott, a former Jets star, is currently on-air partner with Hahn in the noon-3 p.m. slot and Scott could find himself working with Dan Graca in the 10 a.m.-1 p.m. slot depending on other scheduling changes made, The Athletic reported.  Any change with Kay would be the latest shakeup in the New York sports radio sphere after it was announced last week that Dave Sims would take over as the radio voice of the Yankees.  Kay also made some headlines after he realized that he would not be calling the Yankees’ 2025 season opener against the Brewers because the game is being broadcast exclusively by ESPN.  It ends an ironman streak that ran for 37 years where Kay worked a Yankees opening day, first as a sports writer and then in the broadcast booth."

After Paul won the fight convincingly, Irvin appeared on multiple shows and claimed to have heard that there was a stipulation in the fight contract that prevented Tyson from utilizing his trademark uppercut, referring to the fight as a “big lie” due to the alleged clause.  Nakisa Bidarian, the co-founder of MVP Promotions, which promoted the fight, appeared on “The Ariel Helwani Show” on Yahoo Sports and slammed the idea that it would’ve been rigged in this manner.  “The only thing that bothers me is the continued narrative and people saying that the fight was rigged,” Bidarian said.  “I saw something from Michael Irvin — he was on the broadcast; he actually sat there with Jerry Jones — I saw something this week where he was like, ‘Oh yeah, I saw the contract and Mike couldn’t throw an uppercut.’  “Are you — I’m concerned that there’s a CTE problem there for Michael Irvin because how would you see the contract to begin with that Mike Tyson couldn’t throw an uppercut? It’s beyond lunacy and the realm of the reality of life.” Irvin did not claim to have seen the contract but passed along gossip that he’d purportedly heard about it. Paul won the fight by unanimous decision in eight rounds, with a number of observers suggesting that it was untoward that he seemingly did not attempt to knock Tyson out.  Paul admitted after the fight that he “definitely” took his foot off the pedal. “This was a regulated, professional bout by the Texas Athletic Commission. We were partners with Netflix, the biggest media company in the world who’s a public company, and for anyone to suggest in any way that this was a rigged fight — they’re either dumb or they’re looking for attention,” Bidarian told Helwani."

Alabama hopes to bounce back after a tough road loss to the Purdue Boilermakers, while the new-look Fighting Illini team looks to improve to a hot 4-0 start. Which team has the edge in this top-25 matchup? When Mark Sears announced his return to Tuscaloosa in the offseason, it was evident that the Alabama Crimson Tide were in for another successful year. Sears joined Latrell Wrightsell Jr, Jarin Stevenson, Grant Nelson and Mo Dioubate as key returners from the 2023-24 squad that made the Final Four. Then, ‘Bama brought in even more talent in transfers Aden Holloway, Cliff Omoruyi and Chris Youngblood, and recruits like five-star big man Derrion Reid and fringe five-stars Aiden Sherrell and Labaron Philon. Meanwhile, Illinois has had a massive roster turnover, losing its top eight players from last year to graduation, the transfer portal or the NBA. Still, the Fighting Illini brought in enough talent, particularly in the frontcourt, to be a contender in the Big Ten. We can expect a fast-paced, high-octane game between two elite offensive attacks. However, Bama is a much more potent and deep team that will run Illinois and its frontcourt-heavy roster to death, resulting in a double-digit blowout win. If this game had been played last season, the Fighting Illini would have been in a much better position to sneak out a road victory, but that is not the case. Alabama’s frontcourt addition of glass-crashing, rim-protecting big man Omoruyi will make all the difference in games like these. Last year, the Crimson Tide had to lean on Grant Nelson to play the five, which is not his natural position.  In turn, they often struggled to defend the paint and pull down an adequate number of rebounds, resulting in a team that ranked 253rd in defensive rebounding percentage, 111th in adjusted defensive efficiency (KenPom) and 197th in opponent two-point percentage. While this season’s squad has slightly less floor spacing overall and one fewer 3-point shooter on the court at all times (Omoruyi is a non-threat from deep and Nelson is streaky from the 3-point line), Bama is in a much better position to beat teams with dominant frontcourts like Illinois now. We should see the Crimson Tide lean into their advantage in speed and transition, resulting in a fast-paced game that ultimately favors them, as they rank 17th in adjusted tempo. Further, some positive shooting regression should be expected after generating a bountiful number of open 3-point attempts in their game against Purdue. Their shots simply weren’t falling.

On his “New Heights” podcast on Wednesday, the Chiefs tight end recalled seeing the camera “slowly pan to catch” the legendary boxer “in nothing but a jockstrap” just minutes before Tyson took the ring.  “I immediately sent that to f–king everyone,” Kelce said. “That was the funniest s–t ever. … That was some funny-ass s–t.” His brother and co-host, Jason Kelce, was amused by the flap as well, saying he “knew” Tyson was going to lose to Paul once he saw his backside on live television.  “You lose your glutes, you lose your game,” Jason said. “He’s got an old man ass. … You can’t be out there with saggy glutes.” “He wasn’t bouncing,” Travis replied. Tyson, 58, fell to Paul, who at 27 is more than 30 years his junior, by unanimous decision.  Even at his age, the Kelce brothers agreed Tyson would “definitely still whoop” them if they got in the ring with the former world heavyweight champion.  The Kelces were two of an estimated 60 million people to tune in on Netflix for the heavily anticipated fight Friday night at AT&T Stadium. Scores of fans, though, missed some or all of the action throughout the broadcast after their stream froze or crashed altogether, which was something the NFL had questions about.  The streamer is set to air an NFL doubleheader on Christmas with Kelce’s Chiefs taking on the Steelers and the Ravens playing the Texans. Netflix reportedly reassured the league that they figured out what went wrong last Friday, and that any issues would be solved by Dec. 25."

The Blueshirts not only obtained the rights to the Habs’ unsigned 2007, 12th-overall Ryan McDonagh, who would become the club’s Defenseman of the Decade but cleared enough space to accommodate the free agent signing of Marian Gaborik for five years at $7.5M per. Jeff Gorton, the GM who succeeded Sather in 2015, pulled off a Great Escape of his own that has become the second most notable for the organization and is resonating now by getting out from under Lias Andersson, the seventh-overall 2017 selection, in a 2020 draft-day deal with the Kings that yielded Will Cuylle. This was the draft conducted on Zoom in October following the lockdown summer of COVID. The Kings owned the 29th selection in the second round; 60th overall. LA had interest in Andersson, who just never meshed on Broadway. The Rangers had a targeted interest in Cuylle, the power winger who was on the board following an impressive season for OHL Windsor."

I process and I let it go.”  It was a trying year for the Sky, who went 3-13 to close out the season after the Olympic break. It also didn’t help that rookie star Angel Reese’s season came to a premature end because of a wrist injury. Weatherspoon would’ve been justified if she sulked in the stunning news, but that’s not her style.  “I can’t sit there. I can’t wonder why. I got to move,” said Weatherspoon, who spent some of October with her former team as the Liberty went on to win their first WNBA title. “This is my life, this is what I live to do. I love what I do.  “And you got to know this, and you got to stand on this – you’re not for everybody. …  And I’m OK with that. I know the things that I did, I know the things that I have to change. I know the things that I had to go through, and what I took through, and I will do that again over and over and over. And in the process, you always learn a lot of things about yourself. I’m about myself first, about me first. What I learned, what I carry but at the end of the day, I’m fine. I’m great. I’m awesome.”  The Sky have since hired former Las Vegas Aces assistant coach Tyler Marsh as Weatherspoon’s successor. In the meantime, Weatherspoon is one of six coaches who have been hired to lead the six-player teams for the inaugural season of Unrivaled, a 3-on-3 basketball league. She’s joined by Phil Handy, Adam Harrington, DJ Sackmann, Nola Henry and Andrew Wade who are aiming to lead their teams not only to a championship but also to help develop players’ skill sets along the way.  On Wednesday, several of the coaches lauded Weatherspoon for her basketball acumen and positive energy. Handy, a longtime NBA assistant coach who most recently worked with the Lakers, said he’s been a “huge fan” of Weatherspoon since her playing days.  “I love her spirit. Her spirit is so good for the game. I don’t care if it’s men or women, she has such a unique spirit,” Handy said. “Her energy that she brings every day is absolutely top notch. And so for me, that phrase of ‘you get hired to get fired’ is a real thing in all of pro sports. At some point, coaches are going to run into something where organizations feel like they want to go in another direction, and we have to be professional.  “Look, does it hurt? Is it disappointing? Is it frustrating? All of those things included, but T-Spoon is showing just like a lot of other coaches that … we got to carry on. And our love and passion for the game is what kind of continues to push us through even when you get through these pitfalls.”  Unrivaled Basketball will tip off its eight-week season on Jan. 17 in Miami."

Coach Robert Saleh was fired after a 2-3 start. The team has gone 1-5 under interim coach Jeff Ulbrich.  On his “Up & Adams” appearance, Adams continued to explain that management turnover was the way of the world amid underperformance in the NFL.  “That was something similar [with Saleh] — obviously I wasn’t technically here yet for the head-coaching change, but going through that in Vegas — when things aren’t working typically you move some things around,” said Adams, who experienced a midseason coaching change with the Raiders last season.  “You’ve gotta adjust some furniture. I kind of anticipated it coming just based on the scope of the season and how we’ve been looking as a team. They’ve got to place the blame or put accountability on someone, and oftentimes it winds up on the coach or the management. That’s just kind of how the cookie crumbles.  “It’s not for me to say whether it’s the right thing to do or not. I’m just getting here, and I’m still hearing about the way things work in this building and the way things have been in this building. So I’m not here to talk about whether it was supposed to happen — that’s just typically how it goes.”  Nevertheless, Adams does not regret making the voyage to the Jets.  “No, I don’t live my life like that,” Adams said, “We’re talking about playing with Aaron Rodgers here .… this isn’t like taking some crazy gamble with some rookie that’s unproven.”"

Like last year, Memphis has already battled many injuries, with Ja Morant, Desmond Bane, Marcus Smart, GG Jackson, Vince Williams Jr. and Luke Kennard all missing some time. Now, Zach Edey will be sidelined after spraining his ankle Sunday night and Williams will also be out after suffering an ankle injury Tuesday night. Despite another injury-riddled start to the season, the Grizzlies have found a way to float above .500. Can they continue to do so against a floundering Sixers squad? If you predicted that the 76ers would begin the season with a 2-11 record despite signing Paul George, you are either crazy or had Biff’s almanac from “Back to the Future 2.” The Sixers are free-falling. They have dropped nine of their past 10 games and are tied with Washington for the worst record in the Eastern Conference and the NBA. Thus far in the 2024-25 campaign, the Sixers have the third-worst net rating and the lowest effective field goal percentage in the NBA. Additionally, former MVP Joel Embiid has only been available for three of the team’s games. Even when available, Embiid has been a shell of himself, averaging merely 14.7 points and 6.3 rebounds per game on an unfathomably poor 32.4% shooting from the floor and 15.4% from 3-point land. Conversely, despite struggling to keep their players healthy, the Grizzlies have found some success, save Tuesday night. After an embarrassing home loss to the Nets on Oct. 30, Memphis had secured four consecutive double-digit home wins before Tuesday’s loss to Denver. In that four-game stretch, Memphis had the second-highest net rating (+18.5) and highest rebounding percentage. It also ranked first in points in the paint and second in opponent second-chance points. I can’t believe I’m saying it, but this could be a great bounce-back spot for the Sixers despite their brutal start. Philly might be returning Maxey into the lineup, uniting him, Embiid and George for the first time all season. Memphis will be on the second night of a back-to-back and presumably won’t have Edey to defend Embiid, meaning Brandon Clarke (6-foot-8) will have to assume the role if head coach Taylor Jenkins sticks to the small-ball lineups. Further, Memphis has been hit or miss on the offensive end of the floor, and its issues with developing cohesion can be tied to the various injuries it has already dealt with. Unfortunately, things have gotten stickier since they lost Williams again. We will have to wait and see about Maxey’s availability, but if he plays, the Sixers can leave Memphis with a victory.

I think he understands the business, I think he understands the game, I think he understands the head coach. So he’s more than qualified. Look at the way he’s taught me and raised me and how I’ve seen him impact others in all different levels of basketball — high school, college, pros.”  Late Monday night, the Knicks issued a statement condemning the NBA for probing Rick’s promotion to lead assistant.  The assumption is the NBA was looking into the possibility of the pay raise being tied to Jalen taking a team-friendly contract extension in the same offseason.  If that were the case, there’s an argument it represents cap circumvention.  But MSG Sports slammed the NBA’s concerns as “offensive,” noting that the previous top assistant, Johnnie Bryant, had vacated the position by going to Cleveland and that Rick Brunson, an NBA assistant for 10 seasons on five teams (including three with Thibodeau), “has done a tremendous job and will continue to do so.”  “We see this as more harassment of the Knicks due to our opposition to certain NBA matters,” MSG Sports concluded in its statement, a reference to James Dolan persistently opposing commissioner Adam Silver.  Jalen said the NBA hadn’t reached out to him about his father, although a league source said the Knicks were contacted.  A league spokesman declined to comment.  Jalen has consistently called his father the most significant person to his basketball development, including a successful effort by Rick to turn his son left-handed, starting when he first played on a Little Tikes hoop.  “He helped me work on my game since I told him I wanted to become a professional basketball player,” Jalen, a natural righty who shoots lefty, said. “Whether I was pissed off, happy, whatever, he always asked me before and after every workout, ‘Is this what you want to do for a living?’ And the answer was always, ‘Yes.’  “He pushes me every single day and he still does.”  Rick has been an assistant in the NBA, the NCAA and a head coach at Camden High School, where he won the 2022 Tournament of Champions of New Jersey.  Before that, Rick was a journeyman NBA player for nine seasons, including three with the Knicks while Thibodeau was an assistant under Jeff Van Gundy.  He was hired as a Knicks assistant the same season Jalen joined the team as a free agent in 2022.  Former Mavs owner Mark Cuban singled out Rick as the reason Jalen didn’t re-sign with Dallas, saying negotiations “went south when Rick took over.”

Rick recently responded by saying the Mavericks chose not to re-sign his son when they had the opportunity and made “a business decision” to let him hit free agency.  “I didn’t get involved; I’ve been involved,” the elder Brunson said. “It’s my son. …I’m a father first, then a coach.”  After a 2022 NBA investigation into Jalen’s signing, the Knicks were found guilty of tampering and forced to relinquish a second-round pick.  More recently, Rick was in the news for a verbal back-and-forth with Donte DiVincenzo, the former Knick who returned to the Garden in preseason with the Timberwolves.

Colorado had been on the end of many jokes throughout the past two seasons, but “Coach Prime” has whipped his crew into shape since a slow start, now sitting at 8-2 and just one back of BYU in the Big 12.  The success brought on by a controversial Colorado team has forced the oddsmakers’ hands at Caesars Sportsbook and they’ve made Colorado -135 favorites to qualify for the College Football Playoff.  The Buffaloes control their own destiny since a Big 12 championship would grab them the conference’s automatic bid in the 12-team field. Colorado’s resurgence is largely thanks to Heisman Trophy favorite Travis Hunter, along with quarterback Shedeur Sanders. Those two stars have played well since they got to Boulder, but the real question centered on Colorado’s offensive line since quarterback protection was a disaster last season and at the beginning of this year.  Shedeur was pressured on 25.1 percent of drop-backs in 2023, according to Pro Football Focus, but that number has dropped to 20.8 percent in 2024.  The potential No. 1 pick had a 31.3 percent pressure rate in a loss to Nebraska and a 32 percent pressure rate in an overtime victory over Baylor, where Colorado needed a Hail Mary to survive.  Things have ticked up for that offensive line and Shedeur has been kept upright since then.  The Colorado offensive line hasn’t had a pressure rate north of 25 percent in any other game this year.  Colorado will face Kansas in Week 13, where it is a 2.5-point road favorite. Should the Buffaloes get through that with a win, they will need to pass BYU to win the Big 12 conference.  Erich Richter is a brazilian jiu-jitsu blue belt but he has a black belt in MMA betting.

However, Toledo still has a great chance to make the conference title game with a win on Wednesday.  The Bobcats had some of the worst returning production marks in the country, but coach Tim Albin has led his team to impressive success, particularly on the defensive end.  Ohio ranks 53rd in overall defensive success rate, especially excelling against the run, where it sits 23rd in EPA/rush allowed.  Toledo has struggled to establish a ground game this season, ranking 128th in EPA/rush and 105th in early down EPA/play.  If the Rockets can’t find rushing success, their offense will fall on Tucker Gleason’s arm against a Bobcats pass defense ranked just 77th by EPA/dropback.  The Rockets often depend on passing explosives to generate offensive production, and the Bobcats defense needs to be sound in coverage here.  It’s worth noting that Gleason is still overdue for turnover regression. He has 14 turnover-worthy plays but just seven interceptions this year.  Meanwhile, Ohio’s offense is highly dependent on running back Anthony Tyus.  Still, it could be tough sledding against a Toledo defense ranked top 25 in EPA/rush allowed and PFF’s tackling grades.  If Parker Navarro is asked to shoulder a heavier burden as a passer, I don’t have much confidence in him succeeding against Toledo’s 12th-ranked coverage unit.  Ohio has benefited from an easy conference schedule, playing four of the bottom five teams in the MAC standings.  While I have issues with Toledo overall, the Rockets still show a clear advantage in this game, and I see value in their spread under a field goal.  Recommendation: Toledo -1.5 (-110, ESPN BET).  First-year coach Pete Lembo has done an excellent job of making Buffalo competitive this season after a complete rebuild on both sides of the ball.  The Bulls are surprisingly 4-2 in conference play and enter this game on the heels of an overtime win over Ball State.  However, they were relatively fortunate to win that game — Ball State averaged 7.45 yards per play (86th percentile) to Buffalo’s 5.44 (39th).  The Bulls have a limited offensive attack, ranking outside the top 110 teams in EPA/pass and passing success rate.  CJ Ogbonna is a dual-threat quarterback with deep-ball capability, but he’s not consistent as a passer.  I don’t trust him to consistently take advantage of Eastern Michigan’s 127th-ranked coverage unit. The Eagles have a solid run defense, ranking top-50 in EPA/rush allowed and PFF’s tackling grades.  You won’t confuse Eastern Michigan’s offense with a record-breaking unit, but Buffalo transfer quarterback Cole Snyder has given the passing attack some life.  The Bulls rank just 99th in EPA/pass allowed this season, and I’d look for Oran Singleton to have a strong game with three straight 70+ yard outings.  I don’t see much value on the side or total in this game.  This one likely comes down to whether or not Ogbonna connects on a couple of deep balls.  Potential weather in this game would likely benefit the Eagles with the superior run defense, so keep an eye on the forecast — we could see heavy wind and rain in Ypsilanti on Wednesday.  Recommendation: Lean Eastern Michigan -1 (-110, Fanatics).  Jacob Wayne handicaps college football and the NFL for the New York Post. He’s up 84.5 units across the two sports with a 6.27% ROI."

Jones is now the No. 3 — or maybe even No. 4 — quarterback, behind newly installed starter Tommy DeVito, backup Drew Lock and practice squad addition Tim Boyle. Sometimes, when the starter gets benched and he has an injury guarantee written into his contract, a player will be told or at least given permission to stay away from the team. That, for now, has not happened with Jones and the Giants. “Look, Daniel’s been a pro, he’s been a good teammate for us,’’ head coach Brian Daboll said. “This is the role that he has right now for us and I’m glad he’s part of our team.’’ Jones on the cloudy afternoon was on the practice field as the Giants (2-8) began preparation for Sunday’s game with the Buccaneers (4-6) at MetLife Stadium. He did not do much in the early periods open to the media to break a sweat. Jones watched as the three other quarterbacks went through some individual drills, then he did toss the ball around with the quarterbacks and tossed a few passes to receivers who were standing in place. The way this is going to work is that DeVito gets all the first-team reps, Lock runs the scout team as the backup — as he had done throughout this season — and Jones and Boyle participate in individual drills and throw to receivers running routes. This is more than a benching for Jones, as the $23 million injury guarantee for 2025 if he suffers a major injury necessitates that the Giants make sure he does not get hurt. So, no real practice for Jones, who might as well be protected with bubble wrap whenever he is in the team facility. “Not the easiest situation, I understand that,’’ Daboll said. Jones, 27, was informed of his permanent demotion Monday. Daboll said Jones attended meetings on Wednesday with a “good attitude.’’ This is an adjustment for all concerned. Nose tackle Dexter Lawrence, a 2019 draft classmate of Jones, said Tuesday he believes Jones is the best quarterback on the team and he did not understand why this move was made. Lawrence and Jones are close friends. “I got a lot of respect for Dex,’’ Daboll said. “Dex has been a teammate of Daniel for a while, pretty good relationship there. Look, everybody’s not going to agree with the decision and I understand that.’’ As for how this decision will play out in the locker room, Daboll sounded confident it will be business as usual, despite the change at quarterback and the business motives behind making sure Jones does not again take the field. “I’ve got a lot of confidence in our locker room,’’ Daboll said. “We got a close-knit group. Obviously not where we want to be with the record, but I have a lot of confidence in the players and the coaches and the chemistry that we have.’’ There is certainly a chance the Giants opt to make Jones inactive on game days and either designate Boyle as the emergency No. 3 quarterback or go with only two quarterbacks — DeVito and Lock. If Jones does not step on the field or take another snap for the Giants — that is certainly the expectation — his final numbers are depressingly and alarmingly lacking. The Giants had one winning season in the six years he was the starter. His career record is 22-44-1 and the trending has been down, down, down ever since the 2022 season, when Jones was a solid, unspectacular and successful game manager for a team that went 9-7-1 and won a playoff game. Since signing a four-year, $160 million contract in March of 2023, Jones is 3-13, limited to only six games that season because of a neck injury and then a torn ACL. Jones closes out his Giants chapter completing 64.1 percent of his passes for 14,582 yards, 70 touchdown passes and 47 interceptions. He also ran for 15 touchdowns and was sacked 208 times. His career passer rating is 84.3. His final game did not even take place in the United States, as in Week 10 he tossed two red zone interceptions in a desultory 20-17 overtime loss to the Panthers in Munich."
"NY Post Sports – Latest News, Scores, Stats & Videos",Liberty’s Breanna Stewart loves how Unrivaled draft unfolded,https://nypost.com/2024/11/20/sports/libertys-breanna-stewart-loves-how-unrivaled-draft-unfolded/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 14:00:17 -0500",The rosters for the new Unrivaled league were revealed on Wednesday.,"Liberty star Breanna Stewart is set to join forces with a teammate of old and one of now during Unrivaled Basketball’s debut season. She’ll also be reunited with a coach who’s already left a mark on her career.  Stewart was assigned to the Mist on Wednesday along with Liberty guard Courtney Vandersloot and Seattle Storm guard Jewell Loyd.  Stewart spent the past two seasons and won a title with Vandersloot, who’s about to become a free agent. Before making the move to New York, though, Stewart had spent her first seven WNBA seasons playing alongside Loyd for the Storm.  The Mist, who will be coached by long-time NBA assistant and former Storm consultant Phil Henry, will also feature Sun guard Dijonai Carrington, Sparks forward Rickea Jackson and Mystics forward Aaliyah Edwards.  Stewart may be a co-founder of Unrivaled Basketball, a new 3-on-3 league set to make its debut early next year. But the Liberty star didn’t hold back her excitement specifically for the team she was assigned to for the inaugural season as she was reacting live to the YouTube broadcast of the club selection. “Oh my team is good,” Stewart wrote on X.  The same, though, could be said about the five other teams.  Throughout the 22-minute YouTube broadcast of the club selection — a specific run time that some speculated could hint that Caitlin Clark may soon join the league — the six Unrivaled coaches were seen gathered in a Miami conference room, where they debated on which player should go to which team. The goal was to try to create as balanced as rosters as possible to create a more competitive product. That can be quite the challenge considering the pool of prospects was filled with some of the WNBA’s most tantalizing talents, including Angel Reese, Brittney Griner, Arike Ogunbowale and Chelsea Gray.  There was a clear emphasis on pairing players who will not only complement one another’s style but help with further developing each players’ skills.  In fact, part of the reason Stewart and Napheesa Collier teamed up to launch Unrivaled Basketball was to give WNBA players an opportunity to not only earn money but continue to grow their games in the U.S., rather than having to spend their offseason playing overseas to supplement their incomes. All six coaches — Handy, Teresa Weatherspoon, Adam Harrington, DJ Sackmann, Nola Henry and Andrew Wade — have backgrounds in player development.  “Player development is how I got started as a coach in the NBA, but that’s just one part of it,” Handy said. “The player development side for me .. that’s just kind of what I do on a natural side but being able to work with Stewie and the rest of these ladies on the team the 10 weeks is going to be a great opportunity for each of these players to become better individually and in some mall sided team concepts. So I’m really just excited about helping each one of these ladies improve their game over the 10 weeks.”  Handy called the experience of building the rosters alongside his soon-to-be opposing coaches was “very unique. “I don’t think there’s ever been anything like this,” Handy said, “in the sense you get six coaches in a room and you start dissecting rosters.” As an assistant on the Los Angeles Lakers staff, Handy said he served as a consultant for the Seattle Storm and spent part of the NBA offseason working behind the scenes with players, including Stewart and Loyd. He said he’s excited to get to work with them once again.  The feeling seems to be mutual for Stewart.  “Gang is back together!!!!!” Stewart wrote on X while tagging Handy’s handle.  Unrivaled’s eight-week season is scheduled to tip off Jan. 17 in Miami. Two of the 36 roster spots remain vacant but are expected to be filled before the season begins. Some were hoping that Clark might be one of them, though ESPN reported Wednesday night that the Fever star will not participate this time around.  The rosters have been set, and coaches assigned, for the inaugural Unrivaled Basketball season.  Here’s a full breakdown of each team:  Coached by former Sky coach Teresa Weatherspoon Arike Ogunbowale, G, Dallas Wings; Rhyne Howard, G, Atlanta Dream; Aliyah Boston, F, Indiana Fever; Rae Burrell, G, Los Angeles Sparks; Jordin Canada, G, Seattle Storm; Dearica Hamby, F, Los Angeles Sparks Coached by former Sparks player development coach Nola Henry Chelsea Gray, G, Las Vegas Aces; Kahleah Copper, G, Phoenix Mercury; Angel Reese, F, Chicago Sky; Lexie Hull, G, Indiana Fever; Brittney Sykes, G, Washington Mystics; Azura Stevens, F, Los Angeles Sparks Coached by longtime NBA assistant coach Phil Handy Jewell Loyd, G, Seattle Storm; Dijonai Carrington, G, Connecticut Sun; Breanna Stewart, F, New York Liberty; Courtney Vandersloot, G, New York Liberty; Rickea Jackson, F, Los Angeles Sparks; Aaliyah Edwards, F, Washington Mystics Coached by NBA/WNBA skills coach DJ Sackmann Skylar Diggins-Smith, G, Seattle Storm; Allisha Gray, G, Atlanta Dream; Napheesa Collier, F, Minnesota Lynx; Natasha Cloud, G, Phoenix Mercury; Shakira Austin, F, Washington Mystics; Wild card* Coached by former Nets assistant and director of player development Adam Harrington Jackie Young, G, Las Vegas Aces; Marina Mabrey, G, Connecticut Sun; Satou Sabally, F, Dallas Wings; Tiffany Hayes, G, Las Vegas Aces; Brittney Griner, F, Phoenix Mercury; Wild card* Coached by Mystics player development assistant coach Andrew Wade Kelsey Plum, G, Las Vegas Aces; Kayla McBride, G, Minnesota Lynx; Alyssa Thomas, F, Connecticut Sun; Courtney Williams, G, Minnesota Lynx; Kate Martin, G, Las Vegas Aces; Stefanie Dolson, F, Washington Mystics * The two wild cards are open roster spots that are expected to be filled at a later date."

Now, that one-of-a-kind souvenir is heading for the auction block, where it's expected to bring a huge price.","November 20, 2024 By Rich Mueller  A family’s trip to Game 1 of the 2024 World Series came with an unexpected bonus:  the baseball Freddie Freeman hit for the first ever World Series game-ending grand slam home run.  Now, that piece of history is about to find a new home. They’ve consigned the ball to Southern California-based SCP Auctions, where it will be offered as part of a “December Dynasty” auction of historical artifacts that’s set to take place next month. Freeman came to the plate with the Dodgers trailing the New York Yankees 3-2 in the bottom of the tenth. He swung at the first pitch from Nestor Cortes and belted it into the right field bleachers at Dodger Stadium where ten-year-old Zachary Ruderman and his father Nico corralled it.  “There was a huge scramble for it and I knocked it to my dad, who came up with it and then held it up in the air,” Zack told ABC 7 the next day.  His parents had told the young Dodger fan that he was going to have his braces removed but instead steered the car to the ballpark for the series opener.   Now, instead of having just a fun story to tell, they’ll land a pretty nice check, too.  SCP expects the ball to sell for a seven-figure price tag.  “We’re honored to handle this baseball memento from a moment that will forever be remembered in sports history,” remarked SCP Auctions President David Kohler.  “Our family hopes the baseball will be displayed in Dodgers stadium so all Dodgers and baseball fans can view a very special piece of history for the City of Los Angeles,” the Ruderman family said Wednesday in a statement.     The Freeman ball is set to be offered on the heels of the record-breaking sale of Shohei Ohtani’s 50th home run ball of the 2024 regular season, which made him the first player ever to have 50 home runs and 50 steals in a season. That ball sold for $4.3 million last month. The home run bore some parallels to another famous Dodger Stadium World Series homer–a game-winning walk-off hit by a gimpy Kirk Gibson off Dennis Eckersley of the A’s in 1988.  SCP sold Gibson’s bat and other items after he consigned them to auction in 2010. Freeman would go on to be named World Series MVP by leading Los Angeles to a 4 games to 1 victory over New York.  “It might be the greatest baseball moment I’ve ever witnessed,” said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said after Freeman’s homer. “And I’ve witnessed some great ones.” Freeman’s bat and jersey from Game 1 are already on display at Dodger Stadium.

Sports Collectors Daily,1970 Venezuelan Baseball Card Set Connects With Off-Season Topps Players,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/off-season-topps-connections-with-1970-ovenca-venezuelan-baseball-card-set/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 01:55:38 +0000","You'll recognize quite a few names inside this 1970 baseball card set distributed in Venezuela and meant to be pasted into an album.  Roy Carlson found a set on Facebook and digs into the players, the photos, the errors and much more.","November 19, 2024 By Roy Carlson  As a midwestern kid in the 1970’s, nothing topped buying Topps wax packs at the beginning of spring as another baseball season entered my young life.  I continued snapping up more and more packs through the summer months, thumbing through each stack hoping for fresh faces, preferably Chicago Cubs, to stare back at me.  Unlike many of my friends, I didn’t grow disinterested in those cards as other activities heated up, like the return to school, scouts and football.  But, alas, eventually the baseball campaign ended and the agonizing wait until next spring began.  It never once occurred to me back then that some of those heroes in my Topps collection headed south, way south, to Venezuela to compete in Winter League ballgames.  Nor did I realize that baseball cards existed beyond the south (and north) border of the United States.  Topps produced Venezuelan sets during this time period, as Jason Schwartz thoroughly recaps in this SABR article and veteran hobby writer George Vrechek marvelously covers here. A few months ago, I bought a 300-card 1970 Venezuelan set commonly referred to as Ovenca, the editor listed in the album that holds the beisbol cards.  Mind you, this was not a product created by Topps, but to me, Ovenca and Topps cards intersect in many ways, as I’ll point out later in this article.  As was common practice with trading cards in Latin America, most Ovenca cards were lightly glued into a paper album, partially or entirely concealing the cards’ backside Spanish descriptions.  My 54-year-old Beisbol ’70 Album has obviously seen better days, but the rich history and stories the cards hold more than make up for the rough condition.   The collection features six Winter League teams – Tigers de Aragua (Tigers), Cardenales de Lara (Cardinals), Magallanes Navegantes (Navigators), Leones del Caracas (Lions), Aguilas del Zulia (Eagles), Tiburones de La Guaira (Sharks), each with 40 cards.  The remaining 60 cards are spread over Veteranos players (Veterans), Inmortales (Immortals, i.e. deceased) and miscellaneous action & team cards.    One of the League’s stadiums, El Stadium Universitario in Caracas, is featured on card #106.  The 30,000-seat capacity venue, built in 1950, can be seen in the background on multiple cards throughout the set.  This gorgeous vintage postcard shows how the ballpark, which is still in existence today, nestles into a mix of city skyline and mountainous terrain.  According to super collector Chris Shuchart, most cards feature a flat finish front and dull blue back on thick cardboard, though there are some rare cards with a glossy front and brighter blue back printed on thinner stock.   Sport Grafico, the local magazine akin to Sports Illustrated, published ads promoting the full color 1970 Beisbol trading cards and album.  According to a pricing description in Venezuelan currency found on the bottom left of the promo ad in the Sport Grafico 11/20/70 issue, an album cost 1 bolivar and 3 cards in an envelope set you back .25 bolivar.  To learn more about Sport Grafico magazine and some Venezuelan paper cards associated with it, hobby researcher Matthew Glidden does a great job capturing details in part one and part two on his blog. I came across this magnificent 1970 photo in Sport Grafico of a Venezuelan boy playing with his beisbol cards.  The image is a throwback to my own life as I did the same thing with Topps cards on my bedroom floor.  I was curious what the copy on the left described about the picture.  Thanks to Google Translate, I typed in the Spanish words and out spit a fairly accurate English interpretation.  To my surprise, the Christmas story told of the extreme challenges a boy like this faced in Venezuela.  Yet the cards provided both escape and hope to help combat his difficult life circumstances, as highlighted below.  To offset that sobering reflection, let’s move on to the joy of Topps/Ovenca card connections. There are a few top-notch names in the 1970 Ovenca set.  Native crowd favorite Luis Aparicio is the biggest superstar included, but another Venezuelan, fresh-faced David Concepion gives Aparicio stiff competition.  Concepcion’s Big Red Machine years with Cincinnati were just starting to bud while Little Louie was winding down his Hall of Fame career.  Clarence Gaston, who enjoyed his strongest playing career performance in 1970 in the States with the San Diego Padres, and the great Luis Tiant, joined the star card line-up.  Here are their Topps counterparts around the same time period.  While they’re not Topps cards, it’s still cool to see 19 Ovenca pure “pre-rookie” cards of players who had yet to be featured on a Topps base card product.  There are five players featured in the 1970 Ovenca assemblage that also have Topps cards appearing in the 1950’s.  The oldest Topps card belongs to Chico Carrasquel, who landed in the rare 1951 Blue Back set, Topps’ first year on the scene.  Camilo Pascual, Aparicio, Ray Monzant and Orlando Pena followed suit during that decade.      For all you 1969 Seattle Pilots fans, if you haven’t done so already, here’s your chance to add to your stash five trading cards of South America-bound Pilot players that landed right around the time the team packed up the tent.   I found it interesting that some bloodlines of Topps players were shared within the Ovenca set.  Aparicio’s pop, the elder Luis, garners his own card.  The father/son duo were even identified as padre/hijo in the album.  Pompeyo Davalillo, much older brother of Venezuelan Victor, commonly referred to as Vic in the U.S., hang together within the Ovenca set.  Veteran Pelayo Chacon joins his son, Elio.  Elio suited up for the brand-new, hapless 1962 New York Mets.  His Venezuelan roots contributed to some miscues during that ineffective season, as reported by baseball-reference.com:  Who knew long-time MLB ace Camilo Pascual’s nickname was “Patato Pequeno”?  When I saw his older brother Carlos “Patato” Pascual in the Ovenca set, I looked up how the nicknames came to be.  Peter C. Bjarkman writes on SABR BioProject:  Carrasquel, portrayed with his nickname “Chico” on the fronts of his six Topps base cards, is shown with his formal first name Alfonso on his international cards.  His Uncle Alejandro, the first Venezuelan to ever play in the Majors, makes an Ovenca cameo alongside his nephew.  As neat as that linkage is, here’s one even better for nostaglic collectors like myself.  That same Alejandro Carrasquel card is sitting on the floor of that boy’s stockpile 54 years ago.  Simply wonderful. Speaking of nicknames, the Ovenca set sheds light on legal names of some Major Leaguers when compared to typed names on some Topps card fronts.  For instance, Topps lettered either “Chico” or “Leo” on all 16 Topps base card fronts for Leonardo Cardenas.  Topps did unmask Cardenas’ full first name on some card backs, like this 1970 model:  In Venezuela, Ovenca listed Boots Day as Charles, whereas Topps opted for Boots on the front of his complete 1970-1974 card run.  In addition to some card backs, sometimes Topps divulged a player’s birth name using the athlete’s facsimile signature.  A fair share of confusion hovers over this next player’s moniker.  Ovenca called him Jesus Marcano Trillo while Topps called him Manny Trillo.  Regarding the talented infielder’s name, Leonte Landino provides the dope on SABR BioProject:  Topps covered all bases by listing not only Manny Trillo on the 1974 rookie card front (above), but also Jesus Manuel Marcano Trillo on the back (below).  Here’s a case of mistaken identity.  Ovenca got pitcher Jerry Cram right on his card and album #236 listing, but another Stateside hurler sharing the same first name was not as fortunate.  When pasting Jerry Crider’s beisbol card #192 into the collector book, one might do a double take seeing Cram’s name instead of Crider’s.  I wonder how many times this happened in the winter of 1970-1971?  Topps avoided the problem altogether by not issuing albums for their U.S. pasteboards.  On top of the Crider album inaccuracy, there were a handful of boo-boos on Ovenca cards for the Topps visitors.      INCORRECT OVENCA CARD SPELLINGS:       CORRECT TOPPS COMPANION CARD SPELLINGS:       INCORRECT OVENCA CARD SPELLINGS:       CORRECT TOPPS COMPANION CARD SPELLINGS:  Another American player that encountered a botched name on his foreign card is Kurt Bevacqua, which may have burst his bubble upon seeing it for the first time.  Ovenca produced a multi-player headshot card titled EL PODER NEGRO, Spanish for BLACK POWER of four players – Clarence Gaston, Hal King, Jim Holt and Herman Hill.  Each appeared on vintage Topps cards.  Hill’s lone Topps appearance was his 1970 rookie card shared with catcher Paul Ratliff.  The Twins outfielder died tragically on December 14, 1970 in the Caribbean Sea off the northern coast of Venezuela.  He was only 25 years old.  Dana Yost recaps Hill’s life and death in this SABR Bio Project. In addition to the shared Ovenca card #107, Hill had a stand-alone card #110 in the 1970 Venezuelan set.  Rather than end this article on a somber note, let’s switch gears and take a quick looksee at moundsman Fred Norman.  Here he is sportin’ nearly identical expressions on his 1970 Topps and Ovenca cards, but lookin’ much cooler down south with a five o’clock shadow and shades.  Lowell Palmer, you got competition.    Despite this 1970 Venezuelan baseball card set having no official Topps affiliation, there’s still a gratifying collecting kinship for me with the players of that era, and perhaps for you, too.  I created a sortable Excel spreadsheet that helps navigate through the 300 non-domestic cards.  If you’d like this file, simply contact me at [email protected] and I’ll email it to you.  If you enjoyed this article, you might want to check out some of my other vintage Topps articles here on SC Daily.

Sports Collectors Daily,Curse Breaker: Collection Of Former Red Sox CEO Larry Lucchino Headed To Auction,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/curse-breaker-collection-of-former-red-sox-ceo-larry-lucchino-headed-to-auction/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 01:29:25 +0000",He oversaw the championship revival of the Boston Red Sox and now dozens of items from the collection of Larry Lucchino are going on the auction block with all proceeds going to charity.,"November 19, 2024 By Bob D'Angelo  Larry Lucchino was once characterized as Earl Weaver in a suit – without the vocabulary. Lucchino, who died in April at the age of 78, was just as aggressive as the Earl of Baltimore and had the same passion for winning. As president and CEO of the Boston Red Sox, he oversaw three World Series titles and helped Boston overcome the Curse of the Bambino.  He was a philanthropist and collector, and more than 200 lots of his sports memorabilia will be offered online by Bonhams Skinner in an auction that begins on Nov. 23. The Massachusetts-based auction house labeled the sale “Curse Breaker: The Collection of Larry Lucchino.” It will be selling the 2004 World Series ring that was awarded to Lucchino after the Red Sox ended an 86-year championship drought in 2004 — a run to the title that included a comeback from a 3-0 deficit in the ALCS against their hated rival, the New York Yankees. it’s expected to sell for $50,000-$75,000. Other items include a Red Sox Tiffany & Co. Commissioner Trophy from the 2004 season (est. $40,000-$60,000) and the third base bag used in Game 4 of the World Series, when Boston completed a four-game sweep against the St. Louis Cardinals. Series-clinching bases from 2007 and 2013 are also in the online catalog. Another item of note is a 2004 Fenway Park championship banner owned by Lucchino. The sale will also include memorabilia from the Red Sox championship teams of 2007 and 2012. Vintage items will feature a pair of Fenway Park grandstand seats installed in 1934, and a “Gate L” double-sided sign from Fenway. “My brother, Larry, embodied the spirit of generosity,” Lucchino’s brother, Frank J. Lucchino, said in a news release. “In his honor, The Lucchino Family Foundation was established to continue his legacy of giving. I am proud to say that all proceeds from this auction will benefit The Lucchino Family Foundation, ensuring that his commitment to supporting worthy charities throughout New England lives on.” Larry Lucchino, a three-time cancer survivor, was a chairman for the Boston-based Jimmy Fund during the last eight years of his life. Through his efforts, the Jimmy Fund — the favorite charity of Hall of Famer Ted Williams — raised more than $167 million for cancer treatment and research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Lucchino joined the Red Sox in 2002, but his influence in baseball began decades before that. The Pittsburgh native played in the backcourt for two Ivy League champions at Princeton, including the 1965 squad captained by Bill Bradley that reached the Final Four. After attending law school at Yale University, Lucchino worked on the House Judiciary Committee that investigated the Watergate scandal during the early 1970s. Lucchino got his first taste of professional sports when he began working for Washington attorney Edward Bennett Williams, who owned the Baltimore Orioles and the NFL’s Washington franchise. Lucchino owned five World Series rings. In addition to the 2004, ’07 and ’13 jewelry, he also was awarded a ring after the Red Sox won the 2018 World Series. He earned his first ring when the Orioles won the 1983 World Series and was the team president from 1988 to 1993. He also earned a Super Bowl ring when Washington won Super Bowl XVII in 1983 and was awarded a Final Four watch with Princeton in 1965. Two items from Lucchino’s association with championship teams from 1983 will be part of the auction — his NFC championship ring he won with Washington, and his World Series ring he earned with Baltimore. After his tenure in Baltimore, Lucchino was president and a minority owner of the San Diego Padres from 1995 to 2001. The Padres advanced to the World Series in 1998 but were swept by the Yankees. Lucchino’s National League champions ring that he won with the Padres in 1998 is also part of the sale. One of Lucchino’s enduring legacies was his effort to create retro baseball parks. He and baseball stadium architect Janet Marie Smith led the effort to replace Baltimore’s antiseptic Memorial Stadium with Camden Yards. That ties in neatly with the Bonhams Skinner auction, as a group of four seats from Camden Yards will be up for sale. Lucchino would also spearhead efforts to bring a new ballpark for the Padres, as the city replaced Qualcomm Stadium with Petco Park in downtown San Diego. And instead of scrapping historic Fenway Park, Lucchino helped guide the massive renovation of the ballpark. That included seats on top of the Green Monster and a new right-field pavilion section. That also paved the way for his induction into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2016. “Larry Lucchino’s lasting impact on the Boston Red Sox and Major League Baseball as a whole is undeniable,” Robin Starr, the general manager of Bonhams Skinner, said in the news release. “It is incredibly exciting and an honor as a long-time Boston-based auction house to be able to present these important pieces of baseball history.” Highlights of the collection will be available for viewing in Boston at Bonhams Skinner from Dec. 2-4. Bob has been a sportswriter and copy editor for more than 45 years and a blogger for two decades. He is celebrating his 60th year of card collecting, and still counts his 1965 Topps Mickey Mantle as his favorite.  You can reach him at [email protected].

Sports Collectors Daily,Paige Bueckers Signs Exclusive Autograph Deal with Panini America,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/paige-bueckers-autograph-deal-panini/,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024 22:55:52 +0000",UConn's Paige Bueckers will be a Panini exclusive autograph signer as the UConn senior signs a new deal.,"November 19, 2024 By Rich Mueller  The player who appears to be a lock to be the WNBA’s next number one draft pick has a new multi-year autograph deal with a trading card company. Panini America announced Tuesday that it had signed University of Connecticut standout Paige Bueckers, who will sign autographs and appear on product marketing. Bueckers, a two-time first team All-American and the 2021 collegiate Player of the Year, is playing her senior season at UConn.  She joins Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark as women’s basketball stars who have partnered exclusively with Panini.  Panini says Bueckers will be featured across Panini’s collegiate products, including Panini’s Instant Card platform and in an upcoming product line specifically focused on the pioneers of the women’s game and a full team set of the 2024-25 UConn Women’s Basketball team. “Paige is an incredible talent and one of the most accomplished, and influential players in the country, and we are excited to welcome her to the Panini family,” remarked Jason Howarth, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Athlete Relations for Panini America. “Our partnership with her is an exciting addition to our team of elite athletes, and we look forward to offering fans her products for years to come.” Bueckers, a 6-0 guard, has struggled with injuries during her college career but averaged a career-high 21.9 points and 5.2 rebounds last season in leading UConn to a 33-6 record and an appearance in their 23rd NCAA Final Four. So far this season, she is averaging a team-high 21.3 points per game and shooting 65% from the floor for the Huskies, who are 3-0 and ranked second in the country. Panini and the University of Connecticut recently renewed their long-term relationship. Beuckers has appeared on numerous cards already during her college career by way of NIL deals with Topps and Leaf.  Her 2023 Bowman’s Best SuperFractor 1/1 is her top selling solo card on eBay to date, bringing $4,999 late last week.   Bueckers, 21, grew up in Minnesota, attending Lynx and University of Minnesota games and, according to her, getting autographs and collecting a few cards along the way. “Growing up I used to collect cards of all my favorite players, to know that my teammates and I will have our own Panini trading cards and that fans are going to go collect it is really special,” she stated. “I can’t wait to collaborate on projects that give collectors and fans more ways to celebrate our game.” The Dallas Wings have the number one overall pick in the 2025 WNBA Draft.

Sports Collectors Daily,2024 Panini Photogenic Football Preview,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/2024-panini-photogenic-football-preview/,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024 21:05:42 +0000",Panini is bringing its Photogenic brand to football for 2024.,"November 19, 2024 By Rich Mueller  There’s a new football card product coming this season, but it’s not an entirely new concept.  2024 Panini Photogenic Football will mark the NFL debut for the brand that’s been used for NBA releases the past three years. It’s a product that puts the focus on photography, much in the same vein as Topps Stadium Club or even Panini’s own Luminance line.  Photogenic Football will be a ten pack per box product with five cards in each pack.  Cases will hold 14 boxes.   The content of a typical box will include an autographed card, ten inserts, four parallels and five rookie cards, along with cards from what will be a 200-card base set that includes NFL veterans, rookies and retired stars.  Much like those aforementioned brands, you can expect both horizontal and vertical designs.    There was no immediate word on the quantity of parallel versions. The 2023-24 NBA version of Photogenic had only seven different with none numbered higher than 99, including 1/1 Platinum.  Autographs will be found in seven different subsets, including Rookie Portraits, Rookie Instants and In The Action.  Insert sets will include Progressions, Rookie Pix, Troops Tribute, For the Cure, Draft Snapshots, Rookie Introductions, and A Different
View.    Some will be much tougher to find than others, including In-Motion, Avatars, and The Shoe Game, a set that focuses on the different types of shoe designs worn by players.    Autographed versions of some of those inserts will be on the checklist as well. A specific release date hasn’t been announced. Rich is the editor and founder of Sports Collectors Daily.

Sports Collectors Daily,5 Early Roki Sasaki Cards to Consider,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/5-early-roki-sasaki-cards-to-consider/,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024 01:12:09 +0000","As MLB and collectors await his arrival, here's a look at some of the more popular early Roki Sasaki baseball cards.","November 18, 2024 By Brendan Cross  The talent pipeline between Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan and Major League Baseball continues to bear fruit. Roki Sasaki, a 23-year-old pitching phenom from the Chiba Lotte Marines, will be posted by his team and will sign a contract with an MLB team prior to the 2025 season.  Who he will be playing for is yet to be determined, but interest in Sasaki’s earliest baseball cards has been heating up with teams lining up to try and sign him.  Sasaki did not complete six seasons in the NPB, which means he is entering the MLB as an amateur and is not eligible to sign a contract to the tune of Yoshinobu Yamamoto’s 12-year $365 million pact with the Los Angeles Dodgers last December. According to a Baseball America article by J.J. Cooper, Sasaki will essentially be signing a minor league contract and will not reach arbitration until his third season in the major leagues. Shohei Ohtani also took this route when he signed with the Angels prior to the 2018 season. To call Sasaki the Paul Skenes of Japan is not the best comparison. Yes, the Japanese fireballer has a triple-digit fastball and is only six months older than Skenes. But the lanky 6’2” righthander has a great command, a filthy splitter and a wipeout slider that is more Jacob deGrom than it is Paul Skenes. Regardless of those or any other comparisons, Sasaki is on his way to the majors and is already the most talked about free agent pitcher available. Is Sasaki as good of a pitcher as Ohtani or Yamamoto, or maybe Kodai Senga or Shota Imanaga? Consider that he made his debut at the age of 19 in 2021 and was immediately a dominant pitcher. In 2022, he pitched a perfect game with 19 strikeouts, which tied the NPB record. In that game, he set a new NPB record by fanning 13 in a row. In his next start, he went eight perfect innings but was pulled before the ninth due to pitch count concerns. In 2023, the world had a chance to see Sasaki on a big stage. In the World Baseball Classic, he pitched 7.2 innings and struck out 11. In the semi-final against a strong Mexican team, Sasaki averaged 100.5 mph with his fastball. The obvious impact that Sasaki will have on the hobby is that he will be one of the most sought after rookies in the hobby in 2025. He is not the only high-profile rookie who will have his Major League baseball card debut next year, but he will be in high demand. Sales of Sasaki’s Japanese cards and those produced in conjunction with the World Baseball Classic have skyrocketed since late October. Over 500 listings sold on eBay November 9 when news of his pending arrival heated up. Ten cards have sold for $1,000 or more this month on the platform. Sasaki’s earliest trading cards date back to 2020, as he was featured in several top Japanese sports card sets from brands like BBM and Calbee. Here’s a handful of Sasaki’s best NPB and pre-MLB cards. 2020 BBM 1st Version #104

Collectors seem to consider this to be Sasaki’s best NPB card to own. It’s the flagship equivalent to what will eventually be his 2025 Topps Series 1 or Series 2 rookie card and is his first professional card.  BBM began producing cards for the NPB in 1991. PSA 10 versions of the card have been selling for $400 and up while raw copies are pushing north of $100. There are facsimile autographed versions as well. 2020 Calbee #94  Another leading card brand in Japan, this 2020 Calbee base card features the high leg kick of Sasaki while the card design itself has rounded corners. It may not be as sought after by collectors when compared to the BBM counterpart, but visually it’s a must add to any budding Sasaki collection. PSA 10 copies have moved close to $200 with nice raw copies less than half of that. 2021 Topps Chrome NPB #194 
Topps got into the NPB card game with a 2021 Topps Chrome set that featured a few future MLB players such as Seiya Suzuki, Shota Imanaga and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, along with Sasaki. The 2021 Topps MLB chrome set featured the same classic chrome design. It’s Sasaki’s first true Topps card and will surely continue to be a grail card in many collections. Along with the base version, a full range of parallels from Refractor to the 1/1 SuperFractor make these some of the best Sasaki cards to consider. There are no recent sales of numbered versions of this card, but a base PSA 10 sold for $168 on November 14. 2022 Bowman NPB Chrome #133 
In 2022, Topps released a Bowman NPB product featuring paper and chrome cards. This product has an equally large parallel rainbow to build and chase as the 2021 Topps Chrome NPB product. I love the large stride that is captured by Sasaki in this card, large enough to go off the card on both sides. There is also something special about Sasaki having a Bowman card. While he is an NPB professional in this card, as far as the MLB is concerned, he is essentially a prospect. A PSA 10 version of this card sold for $73 on November 14, making it nearly $100 cheaper than its Topps Chrome NPB counterpart. 2023 Topps Series 2 World Baseball Classic #WBC-34

The World Baseball Classic subset in 2023 Topps Series 2 is a highly collectible insert set that features stars who participated in the most recent world tournament. Sasaki was overshadowed by Shohei Ohtani’s performance both on the mound and at the dish, but it was the first time the international stage got to see Sasaki pitch, and he did not disappoint. Base versions of this card are selling for between $8-$10 dollars while numbered parallels will fetch significantly more. Topps also produced a standalone set for the last WBC and you can find Sasaki there, too. Card #21 has a base card and an image variation with each having multiple parallel versions. You can check out a current list of the 50 most watched Roki Sasaki cards below and see all of his cards being offered for sale on eBay here. Brendan Cross is a freelance journalist with a degree from San Jose State. A lifelong sports fanatic, his love of cards really blossomed in 2012 with the first release of Panini Prizm. He’s been hooked ever since, and he loves writing about it.

Sports Collectors Daily,CEO of Beckett Parent Company Pleads Guilty in Insurance Fraud Case,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/greg-lindberg-guilty-insurance-fraud/,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024 01:04:50 +0000",Greg Lindberg is dealing with a double dose of significant legal trouble and now faces years of prison time for a scheme to defraud insurance regulators and policyholders through a web of companies he created.,"November 18, 2024 By Rich Mueller  The chairman of the investment company that owns Beckett Media pleaded has guilty to a $2 billion fraud and money laundering scheme. According to court documents, from no later than 2016 through at least 2019, Greg Lindberg, 54, of Tampa, “conspired with others to defraud various insurance companies, other third parties, and ultimately thousands of insurance policyholders,” according to the US Department of Justice. He’s the longtime CEO of Global Growth, which owns numerous companies, including Beckett, which it purchased from Apprise Media in 2008.  Company founder James Beckett had sold the business to Apprise in 2005. Lindberg “created a complex web of insurance companies, investment businesses, and other business entities and exploited them to engage in millions of dollars of circular transactions. Lindberg’s actions harmed thousands of policyholders, deceived regulators, and caused tremendous risk for the insurance industry,” said U.S. Attorney Dena J. King for the Western District of North Carolina.  Lindberg pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States, including wire fraud, investment adviser fraud, and crimes in connection with insurance business, and one count of money laundering conspiracy. He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison on the conspiracy count and ten years in prison on the money laundering count.  Prosecutors say Lindberg’s fraud helped him continue to support a lavish lifestyle. In addition to pleading guilty to these charges, on May 15, following a retrial, Lindberg was convicted by a federal jury in Charlotte of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud and bribery for orchestrating a bribery scheme involving independent expenditure accounts and improper campaign contributions, aimed at bribing the elected North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance to influence the regulation of Lindberg’s insurance companies. A sentencing date has not yet been set. A federal district court judge will determine Lindberg’s sentence in both cases. As part of his plea agreement, Lindberg agreed to help identify “billions of dollars of funds to make restitution to all policyholders and other entities,” according to documents filed in federal court.

Sports Collectors Daily,Notes:  Fanatics Orlando Show Now a No-Go; George McGinnis Collection to Auction; Nat Turner Joins GameStop Board,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/fanatics-orlando-show-cancel-george-mcginnis-auction-nat-turner-gamestop/,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024 00:50:31 +0000",Fanatics Events says it won't be coming to Orlando after all...championship rings and other items from the George McGinnis collection are coming to auction...and PSA's Nat Turner joins GameStop's board as the two companies continue their partnership.,"November 18, 2024 By Rich Mueller  After postponing the a planned sports card show in Orlando, FL earlier this fall, Fanatics has now scuttled plans for the event.  The company had indicated it was hoping to reschedule FanaticsFest Orlando for early in 2025, but it now appears the show won’t happen at all, according to Fanatics Events CEO Lance Fensterman. “After pausing our Orlando show due to the hurricane and tropical storms in Central Florida – and wanting to be sensitive to dealers and collectors who were impacted – we searched for appropriate dates in the Central Florida market and found no suitable availability in the first half of the year, so that means we will pause on launching in Orlando,” he stated. “Our mission at Fanatics Events has not changed and as such we still love card shows, and plan to continue to create and launch them next year – but our focus now is Fanatics Fest 2025, which we’re incredibly excited to share more news on soon!” The 2024 FanaticsFest event at the Javits Center in New York was held in August and included a card show but was mostly focused on athlete appearances and fan experiences. No date or other details on next year’s event have been announced. Fanatics had also announced plans for a late September show at PNC Park in Pittsburgh but that event was also canceled. Memorabilia from the career of Basketball Hall of Fame member George McGinnis is going on the auction block later this month. Two ABA championship rings, his Hall of Fame ring and induction jacket, 1975 ABA MVP trophy, a 1975 ABA game ball, autographs and other items will be offered by Ripley Auctions of Indianapolis. McGinnis, who grew up in Indianapolis, died last year at age 73. He was an Indiana High School Mr. Basketball, led the Big Ten in scoring at Indiana and became one of the ABA’s marquee players, winning two titles with the Pacers before joining the NBA, where he earned  two All-Star selections with the Philadelphia 76ers.  “George McGinnis was not just a basketball player; he was a legend who embodied the spirit of Indiana basketball,” stated Dan Ripley, CEO of Ripley Auctions. “We are honored to present this collection that spans his remarkable career and life.” In all, 133 lots will be sold in the auction. GameStop has announced that Nat Turner, Chairman and CEO of Collectors Holdings, Inc., parent company of PSA, has been appointed to the Company’s Board of Directors. The move comes a month after PSA and GameStop expanded a partnership that allows collectors to submit their cards for grading and authentication through GameStop stores across the United States.   Last spring, GameStop announced a trade-in program that allows customers to bring PSA graded sports and gaming cards to their local store where they can be swapped for store credit or cash, provided they are graded 8 or better.

REA’s latest Encore Auction closed Sunday night, with more than 3,200 lots up for grabs. Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle were again the most popular names.  A 1933 Goudey Ruth (#53) graded SGC 5 sold for $37,200 while a 1952 Topps Mantle proved again that collectors want one regardless of grade. The PSA 1 copy offered by REA netted for $32,400.  A 1951 Bowman Mantle rookie graded 5 went for $24,000 while a PSA 6 Willie Mays rookie topped out at $22,200. A complete, 60-card 1952 Topps “Canadian” baseball subset was broken up and sold individually for a combined total of $48,750. These draw their name from the gray-colored stock on which they appear, rather than the more common cream-colored look.  The set encompasses cards #131-190. While not everyone subscribes to the theory, some hobby historians believe the 1952 cards and another run in ’54 were printed for issue in Canada. A 1921 E253 Oxford confectionery Ruth graded SGC 20 sold for $13,200 while a 1948-49 Leaf Jackie Robinson rookie rated 4 by PSA realized $13,800.   Vintage baseball classics were not the only top sellers in this event.

As is the case with all Winter Classic games, both teams will","With less than six weeks until the big game, the Chicago Blackhawks and St. Louis Blues have today officially unveiled the uniforms they’ll be wearing at Wrigley Field for this year’s NHL Winter Classic on New Year’s Eve. As is the case with all Winter Classic games, both teams will be wearing uniforms inspired by the history of hockey in their communities. The Blackhawks, again, will reach back into the wealth of options their ninety-eight-year-old wardrobe offers. St Louis, on the other hand, has had fewer unique uniform designs over the years (and has already used up the big ones several times) and, therefore, has gone away from the franchise history a bit for their design. SHOP: 2025 NHL Winter Classic Blues and Blackhawks jerseys available now Starting with Chicago, a uniform which had leaked a couple of months ago is now confirmed as legit. We get the first time the Blackhawks have worn red for an outdoor game. Inspired by their uniforms and crests worn during the 1940s and ’50s, the Blackhawks will have several horizontal stripes across the chest in white and black with a mishmash of team logos as the main crest. The current Blackhawks’ primary logo is the centrepiece inside a roundel with four stars around the bottom, a nod to the Chicago city flag. The typeface within the roundel is a block, serif-style font, which is very close to what the crest featured on their uniforms of the late ’40s/early ’50s. You’ll note that the team name was presented as two words in those original photos; the team made their name a single word in 1986. On the back of the jersey, the player numbers incorporate a pinstripe pattern, a nod to the Chicago Cubs (perfect for a game at Wrigley Field). From the NHL: The Blackhawks’ NHL Winter Classic uniform pays homage to the franchise’s rich heritagewhile introducing distinctive new design elements. The jersey features a classic lace-neckcollar, reminiscent of hockey’s early days, complemented by a vintage cream color thatcaptures the nostalgic spirit of the Original Six era. In unique design flourishes, the frontcrest includes stars from the Chicago flag and the back numbers incorporate subtlepinstripes, a thoughtful tribute to Chicago’s deep baseball tradition. The elements cometogether to create a uniform that honours both the team’s storied past and the city’s broadersporting legacy. The St Louis Blues design looks like they’re going back to the 1930s St. Louis Flyers, a team that predates the Blues’ time in the NHL by three decades. The striping across the chest, with the team name across it, seems to be directly inspired by those Flyers uniforms. The colours blue and gold are not what the Flyers wore, but they, of course, are present here to tie this uniform to the Blues franchise. The font for the ST LOUIS name across the chest is a modified version of that prototype Blues jersey, which served as the inspiration for their Reverse Retro 2.0 uniform back in 2022-23. Something that caught my eye is a modified Bluenote logo on the shoulder, perhaps testing the waters for a future change. From the NHL: The Blues’ NHL Winter Classic uniform pays homage to the city’s hockey heritage. Thejersey’s primary wordmark represents the first time in team history that a Blue Note is notthe principal design element appearing on the chest. The font styling and numbers areinspired by an unworn prototype Blues uniform from 1966, and the jersey also includes anewly designed vintage-style “Blue Note” on the shoulder. Lastly, fleur-de-lis designs arefeatured on the inside back neck and hem loop labels to honour the city of St. Louis.

The &#8220;fauxback&#8221; brand unveiled today, created by Ryan Foose of Fooser Sports","The Lehigh Valley IronPigs, Triple-A affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies in the International League, will play Friday home games next season wearing uniforms that evoke the 1950s—a decade more than half a century before the team’s 2008 debut. The “fauxback” brand unveiled today, created by Ryan Foose of Fooser Sports Design, features their familiar pig-based brand transmogrified into one from a different era. A retro-style pig character—much friendlier than the IronPigs metallic contemporary logo—features prominently on a red cap. A cream-colored jersey is adorned by red piping and a script wordmark across the chest—note the curly-Q on the descender of the G in Pigs, meant to evoke a pig’s tail. “What started as a focus on reimagining the full body pig characters ended up taking a nice ‘what-if’ turn,” Ryan Foose said. “2024 actually marks 140 years of baseball in Allentown. While this identity doesn’t necessarily pull all the way back to the 1880s, it was great collaborating with Lehigh Valley staff on what the IronPigs Baseball Club would look like from the golden era of baseball.” The IronPigs, who are named for the pig iron forged in the steel mills of eastern Pennsylvania, will play their first Friday home game on opening day, March 28, 2025."

The tweet was both posted and deleted on Tuesday, November 19, ahead of the Fighting Irish’s games in the Friendship Four tournament at the SSE Arena in Belfast coming up on November 29 and 30. According to screenshots taken before it was deleted, the post advised fans not to wear green or anything with shamrocks, the Ireland flag, leprechauns, or the words “Irish” or “Fighting Irish” in Northern Ireland capital as they may be “deemed offensive.” Weirdly, though, Notre Dame’s own special jerseys for the tournament — which were unveiled on November 6 — are emblazoned with a script “Irish” logo on the front, with a shamrock dotting the second I. The tweet advised Notre Dame fans to instead wear the school colors of navy and gold and items with the school’s “ND” monogram. The program was lambasted in the replies to the original tweet, with some users calling it “embarrassing.” “My kids have travelled all over Ireland in all the gear you say not to wear and received nothing but love,” the Belfast Telegraph reports one replier as saying. “As a Notre Dame graduate married to an Irish woman this is embarrassing and you should take down the post immediately.” Another user quoted by the Telegraph said: “This tweet is more offensive than any American university t-shirt abroad ever would be. If the fans of the Fighting Irish should be made to feel embarrassed of their programme, then don’t schedule the trip.” Notre Dame Hockey took down the post, then posted an apology a little while later: A statement on our upcoming trip to Belfast. pic.twitter.com/UVB8qRlOas This year’s edition of the Friendship Four tournament also includes teams from Boston University, Merrimack College and Harvard University. It’s currently the only NCAA hockey tournament held outside the United States, and the winners receive the Belpot Trophy. This year is the first time Notre Dame has participated. Previous editions of the tournament were held from 2015 to 2019 and in 2022. Notre Dame’s special jerseys for the tournament are navy blue with the gold “Irish” script on the front. A logo on the shoulders combines a Celtic knot with hockey sticks and faceoff circles. The numbers on the sleeves and back also incorporate the Notre Dame Celtic knot and, along with the nameplate font, are inspired by illustrations in the Book of Kells."

According to Utah president of hockey operations Chris Armstrong in a recent article on NHL.com, Utah will stay close to their current jersey design. “What I would say is that, based on the very encouraging feedback that we’ve received from fans and our players alike on the inaugural season jersey design, we’ll be making some adjustments and some what we think are improvements, but we don’t want to deviate too far from what’s already been well received in our inaugural season,” he said. So what exactly does this mean? Well, we can really only speculate of course, but I’d take it to mean that the colours and striping will either be carried over exactly as they are or just slightly adjusted. Armstrong’s note about “making some adjustments … we think are improvements,” could point to fixing the discrepancies between the home and road jersey striping so they actually match each other. The graphic above gives us a peek at what consistent striping across the home and road sets would look like on a blank jersey, just pop in your favourite Utah Whateverzz logo concept on the chest and you’re good to go. Utah Hockey Club recently made their jerseys available for sale at retail both in-person at Delta Center and online at NHLShop.com, though it appears there are no longer any available online. Fans wanting the 2024-25 Inaugural Season patch must get their jersey at the arena in Salt Lake City. When the franchise was granted earlier this year, the club announced they’d use a temporary identity for their first season in the NHL due to the quick turnaround time between acquiring the franchise and their first game. Several months later, however, the team still hasn’t announced a name, nor have they even revealed if they’ll even change their name at all. As a reminder, the six finalist names are Blizzard, Mammoth, Outlaws, Venom, Yeti, or keeping Utah Hockey Club."

The club launched the crest on Tuesday, November 19, making them the third AFL club to unveil a new crest in recent weeks, following Adelaide Crows and Gold Coast Suns. It follows much the same design as the club has used for more than 90 years, but with elements streamlined and modernized “for 2025 and beyond.” “An enduring symbol of the Saints for over 90 years, the Crest has long been a treasured and integral part of the club’s identity, having featured on every St Kilda guernsey in various shapes, sizes and iterations since 1933,” the club’s website says. The centerpiece of the crest is a shield, which is the same shape as the shield in the previous version of the crest, which the club adopted in 1995. A red banner at the top reads “ST. KILDA”, a change from “St. K.F.C.” in the previous version. Below the banner, a black cross sits on a white background. A ribbon across the bottom features the club’s establishment year of 1873; the shadow behind the ribbon is red on the left side and black on the right side, mirroring the ends of the ribbon on the previous version. Due to the unified nature of the new logo, the Crest is now able to be enlarged in key areas, such as on the front of the guernsey, and also minimised to better suit a raft of digital placements in the modern age; a key consideration during initial ideation. “We’re incredibly proud to reveal our new Crest as we look to set ourselves up for a strong and prosperous future,” St Kilda CEO Carl Dilena said on the club’s website. “To be successful, we’ve got to be prepared to innovate and push boundaries. This bolder, more powerful logo symbolises that, while also paying important homage to our history.” The club’s Latin motto, “FORTIUS QUO FIDELIUS” (“Strength Through Loyalty”), which formerly appeared in the ribbon under the shield, will now appear on the hemlines of St. Kilda guernseys going forward. Speaking of guernseys, those unveiled alongside the new crest followed St. Kilda’s traditional look, with red and black stripes on either side of a white block in the center, mirroring the colors in the crest ribbon. The crest itself appears in a black box on the left chest, under a sponsor logo, with the AFL logo on the opposite side. While St. Kilda was founded in 1873, they only adopted their crest in 1933. St Kilda’s Crest originated in 1933 and was immortalised into club legend later that same season in the aftermath of the famed ‘Crest Game’; a match wherein an undermanned and injury-ravaged Saints outfit — with just 15 players on the field —  toppled a ruthless and full-strength North Melbourne in one of the club’s most stirring triumphs.  In commemoration of the achievement, then-President Fred Arlington-Burke commissioned medals adorned with the Crest to be struck for every player who took part in that game. The Crest has since embodied a legacy of resilience and perseverance no matter the odds; traits synonymous with the Saints over the past 151 years. Work on the redesign began in September 2023 and involved “extensive research, conceptualisation and consultation among a randomised selection of members and fans, current and former players, key club personnel and the Board arriving at the striking new look seen today.” “We understand the significance of modifying such an iconic symbol, so ensured we engaged in a thorough consultation process with a range of stakeholders from a cross-section of our diverse supporter base,” Dilena said. “Through these focus groups, clear themes were identified as integral for our club’s logo. Most importantly, retaining the Crest itself was a non-negotiable.  “We fully understand how important the symbol is to everyone affiliated with St Kilda and hope this change to a modernised and updated Crest continues to uphold what our club proudly stands for.”  More details about the new crest are explained in this YouTube video:"

FIFA unveiled the trophy on their website and social media channels last week. Designed in collaboration with global luxury jeweller Tiffany & Co., the trophy is designed to be innovative, inclusive and groundbreaking. With its rotating discs, the trophy — which is plated in 24-carat gold — can transform from a shield into “a multifaceted and orbital structure.” Both sides of the trophy feature laser-engraved inscriptions that “portray football’s rich history,” including the names of all 211 FIFA Member Associations and all six continental confederations. The central disc “an array of icons that capture football’s traditions, including symbols of stadiums and equipment and a world map.” The trophy is here! ✨Crafted in collaboration with @TiffanyAndCo, this trophy will be awarded for the first time to the winners of the inaugural #FIFACWC taking place next year. #TakeItToTheWorld pic.twitter.com/x1Wo1T1Lf4 The trophy also features engravings in 13 languages and in Braille, “further highlighting the inclusive spirit of the global game and ensuring that the tournament’s legacy is accessible to diverse audiences around the world.” It also contains space for the names of winning clubs to be engraved on the trophy for the next 24 editions. The famous Voyager Golden Records carried on NASA’s Voyager deep-space missions in the 1970s, the periodic table, maps of pioneering journeys and astronomy each played a role in the trophy’s conceptualisation. Celebrating both the past and the future of the sport, the trophy features celestial symbols representing the approximate positions of planets at the time of FIFA’s foundation on Saturday, 21 May 1904 in Paris, France, and of the tournament’s opening match on 15 June 2025 in Miami, USA. An inspiring message to the champions is engraved on the trophy, including the following: “To those who hold this trophy, history belongs to you! You are witness to a moment in time that represents the pinnacle of club football, bestowed upon few but celebrated by many.” These words reflect the trophy’s status as a symbol of greatness, honouring the legends of the past while inspiring clubs globally. Club World Cup-winning clubs will each receive a replica of the trophy after the final. “This official FIFA Club World Cup Winner’s Trophy mirrors the perpetual trophy in its craft, construction and scale – complete with official nameplates emblazoned with club emblems, along with dates relating to their victory,” FIFA says. The trophy will be on display for the first time at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup draw, which will take place on Thursday, December 5, in Miami. The tournament itself will take place in summer 2025 in the United States, with 12 venues in 11 cities on the East Coast scheduled to host matches (CONCACAF Gold Cup matches will be held in cities on the West Coast). The final will be held on Sunday, July 13, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup will bring together 32 teams from the six continental confederations around the globe. The winners of each confederation’s top club competition (e.g., UEFA Champions League) from 2021 to 2024 automatically qualify, while other clubs can qualify through a club ranking over the four-year period. The 32 teams will be split into eight groups of four, with the top two teams from each group qualifying for the knockout rounds. Since 2005, the FIFA Club World Cup had been held every December, with only the winners of the previous year’s top club competitions taking part. With the new format and schedule, it will now only take place every four years, in the year before a men’s World Cup."

Got some new Golds for this Saturday Night in Death Valley pic.twitter.com/BzaEHkkLsG The gold jerseys follow the same overall design as the Tigers’ standard home white and purple alternate jerseys, with UCLA stripes on the shoulders, contrasting sleeve cuffs and the SEC logo on the base of the collar. The only notable difference with the gold jerseys is the purple numbers on the front, back and sleeves, as they include a white stroke, whereas the digits on the home white and purple alternate jerseys are a single color. This will mark just the fifth time in school history that LSU will wear gold jerseys, joining a 35-0 over the Commodores in 1996, a 27-9 win over Notre Dame in the 1997 Independence Bowl, a 22-10 loss at Florida in 1998 and a 23-20 win over Mississippi State in 2016. The Tigers did not reveal which color helmets and pants they’ll wear with the gold jerseys, though it’s worth noting they were paired with gold helmets and white pants in 1996 and 1998, as well as white helmets with white pants in 1997 and 2016. LSU has mostly worn white jerseys at home since 1958, when head coach Paul Dietzel – who had a habit of tinkering with the team’s uniforms – chose to wear white during all five home games that season.  The Tigers went on to capture their first national championship with a 7-0 win over Clemson in the Sugar Bowl, and Dietzel – who was known as a superstitious man – didn’t change their uniforms after that. That tradition continued well after Dietzel left for another job, though the NCAA eventually changed its rules and required teams to wear dark-colored jerseys at home, forcing LSU to wear purple jerseys at home from 1983-94. In 1995, then-head coach Gerry DiNardo successfully petitioned the NCAA to change the rules, though one stipulation was that the visiting team would have to give the home team permission to wear white jerseys. The first team to deny the Tigers’ request was Vanderbilt in 1996, and instead of wearing their purple jerseys, they took the field in new gold jerseys. The Commodores’ decision likely stemmed from DiNardo – who was their coach from 1991-94 – taking the job in Baton Rouge.  Header photo courtesy of @LSUfootball on X/Twitter."

It was the largest battle fought by the United States in the war and the third-deadliest campaign in the country’s storied history, but the paratroopers’ refusal to surrender played a significant role in stopping the Nazi’s “last great offensive” in the war. The all-black uniforms reflect the snow-covered forests where the battle was won, with a snowflake-like pattern on the helmets, shoulders and sleeves, as well as a gradient design on bottom of the white numbers. The Invasion Star, which was used on American aircraft and vehicles to aid in battlefield identification, can be seen on the right shoulder above a “Bastogne” patch, with lettering that reflects the road sign held by General Anthony McAuliffe in a photo after the siege was broken. The left sleeve features the 101st Airborne Division’s patch, while the right sleeve includes the 1944 American flag in its original orientation and proportions, mimicking the flag worn on the paratroopers’ jumpsuits. The jerseys are complete with an “Army!” wordmark on the back nameplate that evokes the typewritten version of McAuliffe’s famous reply to Nazi demands to surrender: “NUTS!” Lastly, the helmets will display card suits, which were used by the 101st Airborne Division’s paratroopers and glider troops to identify their unit affiliations for the jump into Normandy and throughout the European Theatre. The suits will be randomly assigned to each player, with clubs representing the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment, hearts signifying the 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment, diamonds symbolizing the 501st and spades honoring the 506th. Sources have indicated the the Midshipmen, who also wear alternate uniforms against the Black Knights each season, will unveil their design on Wednesday.

Tottenham says in Monday’s announcement that the new brand identity aims to embrace its “rich history and unmistakable heritage” and was created with the input of more than 300 players, staff and supporters. “Our new identity enables a more playful, daring approach for the Club’s brand across the multitude of platforms on which it now features, with a particular focus on clarity in digital environments,” the club said. The most prominent change is the team’s primary crest, the most recent version of which depicts a cockerel standing on top of a football and was adopted in 2006. With Monday’s announcement the curved “TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR” text has been removed from underneath the football, allowing the crest to stand on its own and to be more effectively scaled across different applications, including digital. Along with the reworked logo, the club has also introduced a silhouette version “that allows for a more playful expression of the brand.” While navy blue and white remain as Spurs’ core colors, the new brand also introduces “a new palette of supporting colours,” inspired by elements of the Club’s history. These include Blazing Yellow, Paxton Purple, Hot Terracotta and Elm Green. Another major element of the remastered brand is the reintroduction of a “THFC” monogram to the club’s suite of logos. Similar monograms featured heavily in previous iterations of the club crest, and now it stands on its own. Tottenham has also developed a set of six “hallmarks” to celebrate elements of the club’s history and support their brand storytelling. These include: Tottenham’s signature font — which was first developed nearly 20 years ago — has also been reworked, with additional weights and widths added along with special characters and ligatures. A lowercase version has also been designed for use in paragraphs and long-form body copy. Spurs have been using a version of the cockerel crest without the text underneath on their match kits for several years now. This includes kits made by both Nike and Under Armour."

The 36-time Dutch first-division champions based in Amsterdam announced on Sunday, November 17, that they would be officially reverting to their classic crest full-time in time for the start of the 2025-26 season. This means the new old crest will be used on match shirts and “gradually implemented across all of the club’s expressions.” The classic crest was used from 1928 to 1991, at which time the club switched to a more abstract version — drawn with just 11 lines to represent the 11 players on a soccer team — that they have used ever since. Both versions depict a bust of the Greek war hero Ajax, who was an important figure in the Trojan War. Ajax celebrated the return of the classic logo on Sunday during an exhibition match between legends of their club and legends from Spanish club Real Madrid at the Johan Cruijff ArenA in Amsterdam. Ajax will celebrate the 125th anniversary of its founding on March 18, 2025. “We know that the majority of our fans have cherished this wish for years, and we felt that our 125th anniversary was the perfect moment to give back the classic logo to our fans and ourselves,” said Ajax CEO Menno Geelen on the club’s website. “Furthermore, history has shown that we are at our best when we remain true to the Ajax DNA. That’s why we are doing everything within the club to uphold that DNA, from our football philosophy to our core values. Bringing back the classic logo symbolizes this commitment and serves as both a tribute to our rich history and an inspiration for the future—a future that relies on everything we hold dear about our club.” “The 125th anniversary feels like a very fitting moment to give the logo back to the club, the fans, and ourselves,” added Ernst Boekhorst, chair of the club’s board of directors. “We are delighted to make such a contribution.” Ajax used the classic crest on its home kits as recently as 2021-22, when it helped with the 1970s throwback aesthetic they were trying to achieve."

Throughout the season, the Nationals will use a commemorative 20th anniversary logo, first teased on the scoreboard at Nationals Park during their final home games of the 2024 season back in September. Nothing’s been announced officially, but the team will likely wear the logo on their uniform as either a cap or jersey sleeve patch. The logo shows a blue roundel trimmed in red (just like the Washington Nationals logo) with the team name around the top half in white, and the years 2005 * 2025 ’round the bottom. Inside this circle, on white, we see the Washington D.C. skyline in navy blue, with the Washington Monument and U.S. Capitol Dome visible, as well as the team’s home stadium – Nationals Park, in the foreground. Hovering over the skyline is a large number 20 in red with blue trim, matching the same style used for player numbers on the Nationals uniforms. Major League Baseball returned to the U.S. capital following a 34-year abscence when the Montreal Expos, who had played in Montreal since 1969, moved south following the conclusion of the 2004 season. Washington has previously celebrated anniversaries on their uniforms with commemorative logos for their first season in 2005 and their tenth in 2015. The Montreal Expos wore an anniversary sleeve patch just once, to mark their 25th season in 1993. Just one other change has been confirmed for the Washington Nationals in 2025, the elimination of their grey-and-pink Cherry Blossom-themed City Connect uniform. It is expected that the club will introduce a new City Connect to replace it."

According to the league, these circles represent the three stages of competition in the second-year tournament, including group play, the quarterfinals and the semifinals/championship game, which are linked because they take place at the same location. The trophy is also – like the team-specific designs – prominently displayed at midcourt and in the lanes, though the team wordmarks and/or logos in the former are replaced by the Emirates NBA Cup wordmark.  The wood-colored court is complete with a sublimated bracket, which matches the special basketballs being used during the tournament, as well as a black out-of-bounds area with a red-to-blue gradient design along the bottom baseline to represent the Eastern and Western Conferences. A new 🏀 design for #EmiratesNBACup Games!Group play begins TONIGHT on TNT & NBA League Pass 📺 pic.twitter.com/je2NeYzbWe There are also sublimated stars from the “Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas” sign within the out-of-bounds area, as well as the NBA Cup wordmark and advertisements for Michelob ULTRA Courtside on the baselines and Emirates logos along the upper sideline. The color of the court is notable, as the court used during last year’s In-Season Tournament – which was renamed this offseason – featured a predominately blue background with a large red stripe down the middle and created contrast issues against the semifinalists’ City Edition uniforms. That forced the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers, runner-up Indiana Pacers and semifinals Milwaukee Bucks and New Orleans Pelicans to wear their Association, Icon or Statement Edition uniforms in the final two rounds. The 2024 Emirates NBA Cup continues with six group play games on Nov. 19, headlined by the undefeated Cleveland Cavaliers taking on the Boston Celtics at 7 p.m. on TNT, immediately followed by the Oklahoma City Thunder at the San Antonio Spurs.

It&#8217;s the first tweak the club has made to their set since they rebranded as the Guardians three years ago. We&#8217;ll start with the home and road set,"The Cleveland Guardians announced today they’re making changes to all four of their standard uniforms for the 2025 Major League Baseball season. It’s the first tweak the club has made to their set since they rebranded as the Guardians three years ago. We’ll start with the home and road set before moving onto the bigger changes announced today, to their two alternate jerseys. At home the Guardians will continue to wear the same scripted red wordmark across their chest as they have since 2022, but it’s now presented straight across the jersey rather than diagonally. New red/blue/red piping has been added to this jersey as well, around the collar and around each sleeve, replacing last year’s single blue stripe. The biggest change to the Guardians home uniform is the new cap they’ll wear with it, which will now be predominantly red instead of blue. The logo on the front of the cap remains their “Diamond-C” logo, but now in blue with white trim. For road games, the only change we’ll see to the Guardians grey jersey is the addition of that same piping we see on the home whites — red/blue/red around the collar and each arm. The “CLEVELAND” wordmark across the chest remains the same. The cap paired with the road grey jersey is now the blue crown with red visor the team wore for home games from 2022-24. The all-blue cap, which had been worn exclusively on the road last year, is history. The Guardians red home jersey will see a totally new wordmark across the chest, as they’ll now use their “Bridge Print” font to display GUARDIANS in blue with white trim. Previously, this jersey used the same scripted-style lettering we see on the home whites. The new piping is present on the red jerseys as well, but now in a blue/white/blue pattern. Photos show the Guardians wearing their blue cap with a red visor alongside this jersey, just as they did last year. The biggest overall change comes to the road blue set, where the arched “CLEVELAND” wordmark has been scrapped in favour of their Diamond C cap logo in red with white trim. The club says this is an homage to the team’s uniforms worn between 1901 and 1945 which also featured a large “C” on the front. Piping is present on this set as well, in a red/white/red pattern around the collar and sleeves. No changes here! In 2025, the Guardians will continue to wear their Guardians of Traffic-inspired navy blue City Connect uniform exactly as it was in 2024. My thoughts? While I like its design, the red cap paired their home white jersey will take some getting used to; they did try this once before, very briefly in 2018, before going back to their usual navy blue lids. I wouldn’t be surprised to see them switch to the blue caps at home at some point in 2025 and instead wear the red caps with the red jerseys. The addition of the piping is nice, but where it looks especially sharp is on the club’s new blue road alternate tops. That classic bright red/white/red immediately gives me flashbacks to uniform styles of the 1970s and 1980s (think of the Big Red Machine). The big bold red “C” on the dark navy blue jersey is also a strong look with nice ties back to the team’s uniform roots. None of the new jerseys are available to purchase yet, the team says they’ll be available at some point before the start of the 2025 season."

Puma officially launched the five sets of jerseys on Friday, November 15, saying in a press release that they “have each been constructed with identity and culture at the forefront, with intricate designs representing different takes on the country’s art, history and pride – reimagined for the Beautiful Game.” “We are incredibly proud to unveil these kits, ones that will be worn by some of the best nations, players and fans on the continent,” said Marco Mueller, Puma’s senior head of product line management teamsport apparel. “Africa is part of the Puma DNA and we are proud to work together with our fantastic nations. This comes at an exciting time for African football, ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations for both men’s and women’s teams in 2025, and we’re excited to see what those next iconic moments in our kits will look like.” Here’s a closer look at all five jerseys and what Puma had to say about each design: The new Côte d’Ivoire kits are inspired by the annual festival ‘La Fête des Masques’ the festival at the heart of Ivorian folklore. The iconic orange Home jersey has been intricately detailed with a fringe effect that is applied to traditional costumes and reminiscent of festival goers, whilst the Away jersey design symbolizes the dances performed at the festival and features a white base with green detailing to allow the elephant to take center stage. Both kits capture the vibrancy and ceremonial essence of Ivorian culture. Egypt has been crowned champions of Africa on seven occasions, so it’s only fitting their new kits acknowledge the Kings and Queens the country is synonymous with. Pharaoh, sphinx, sand dune and pyramid themed designs adorn both kits, with the bold red Home jersey featuring a repeat stylised illustration of Pharaohs, pyramids and sand dunes in an all over print, whilst the white Away jersey features an attention-grabbing Pharaoh design as the centrepiece amongst a pattern of pyramids. Four-time Africa Cup of Nation winners Ghana are iconic in every sense, both in name and nature. Traditional Adinkra symbols form a unique all-over pattern on the Home kit, with a central black star completing the statement, meanwhile the Away kit shines brightly in yellow, similarly incorporating the star and symbols as a nod to Ghana’s rich cultural heritage. Ghanaian native, Jefferson Osei set out to unite Ghanaian tribes through his kit design. Working with renowned Ghanaian painter Daniel Alum Jasper, who painted the graphic element of selected Adinkra symbols by Jefferson resonating with all the different tribes within Ghana, he created a custom print for the new Home kit. Upon initial glance, the white jersey appears to feature a simple star print; but as players begin to perspire, the symbols become more pronounced. The yellow Away kit pays homage to Ghana’s ‘Gold Coast’ and represents the colors often found in Ghanaian culture and has the adinkra symbols on the sleeves of the jersey. Morocco is set for big expectations both on and off the pitch in 2025 as hosts of the men’s and women’s Africa Cup of Nations and having the talent to go far in both tournaments, so ensuring they will be represented with kits that fans feel a connection to is imperative. Having made history as the first African team to reach the semi-final of a World Cup, the kits are a nod to their national history. Abderrahmane Trabsini, born and raised in Amsterdam, was inspired by the beauty of Moroccan and Berber craftsmanship in creating the Moroccan kits. Encapsulating the essence of Moroccan artistry, the Home kit features patterns inspired by traditional Moroccan zellige tiles, with intricate geometric designs symbolizing unity, eternity, and artisanship. Trabsini also incorporated Berber symbols often seen in Moroccan rugs into the Away kit, with motifs representing protection, fertility, and harmony. These elements connect deeply with Moroccan heritage, adding cultural depth to the design. The vibrant red and green palette reflects the national flag, while the inclusion of the indigenous language honors Morocco’s rich history. The new Senegal Home jersey encompasses the theme of ‘Teranga’ – the spirit of hospitality. The kit’s design draws inspiration from the nation’s workers, reflecting a fearless and progressive identity expressed through modern art and culture. This results in a clean strip with accents in the colors of the national flag. The Away kit however takes a bolder approach, with a green and lime palette that incorporates a lion print across the chest, inspired by the country’s art and design."

After teasing the jerseys on National Teddy Bear Day all the way back in September, the P-Bruins finally unveiled them on their social media channels on Wednesday, November 13.

It also flips the logos, moving the “pooh bear” logo from the shoulders to the front of the jersey, swapping places with the spoked-P. White and black stripes run around the waist. Inside each black arm stripe are gold numbers with white outlines, along with truncated white and gold stripes. None of the materials that accompanied Wednesday’s announcement showed the names and numbers on the back of the jersey, but it’s safe to assume both will be mainly black. The logo of sponsor Amica Insurance sits on the right chest. Players modeling the new alternate jersey in photos also wore black helmets, gloves and pants. Socks were not visible in any of the promotional materials. Like their NHL parent club in Boston, the P-Bruins wore gold socks with the 90s/2000s black jerseys these new alternates are based on. Gold socks are a distinct possibility, but if the “color flip” theme continues, then they could also be black.

The club unveiled the logo on their website and social media channels on Friday, November 15, and then celebrated with supporters at an event at a park in Burleigh Heads, a suburb of the city of Gold Coast, Queensland. They also kicked off a new marketing campaign branding themselves as “Fearless” as they head into their 14th AFL season. Fearless. pic.twitter.com/XMrWpMPwXn The centerpiece of the Suns’ new brand is the new primary logo. It’s comprised of three key elements, according to the club: There are also subtle G and C characters hidden in the design, “a nod to our history and original logo. Together, these elements capture who we are, where we’ve come from, and what we strive for on and off the field.” “We knew after 14 years with the same brand that it was time to update our look and feel to better represent how we have evolved and matured as a football club,” said Suns CEO Mark Evans. “Our new logo is modern, bold and innovative, with layers of context which speak to our history and purpose. We’re excited to show the world our new brand, and tomorrow we will reveal our new guernsey and colour palette, marking the start of our new era.” Along with the logo, the Suns unveiled their new guernseys, made by New Balance, for the 2024-25 AFL season. They’re mostly red, with a tonal version of the primary logo on the chest. Curving tonal pinstripes adorn the sides of the guernsey and extend onto the shorts, where a pale gold version of the logo is placed on the left leg. Numbers on the back of the guernseys are the same shade of pale gold. The Suns joined the AFL in 2011, and this is the first time they’ve done a major overhaul on their visual identity. Their previous logo was a red oval with a yellow outline, the letters “GC” inside in yellow and a blue shadow. “SUNS” was written out in red underneath, arching to match the curve of the ball. An alternate version featured sun rays emanating from the center of the football. The Suns are the second of three AFL teams who were reported to be unveiling new logos this offseason to do so. The Adelaide Crows unveiled a new logo but no guernseys earlier this month. The third reportedly changing up their logo is St. Kilda Football Club, based in Melbourne. The Suns open their 2025 AFL Premiership season at home against the Essendon Bombers on Saturday, March 8."

On Thursday, November 14, the NLL unveiled 13 new community identities for its UnBOXed program, which aims to introduce young boys and girls to the game of lacrosse in their gym classes. These are not expansion teams, but the NLL hopes these identities and community-relevant names will help engage people in these markets and encourage them to participate in the UnBOXed program. They also hope they “illustrate the League’s commitment to growing box lacrosse across Canada and the United States” as they work toward their goal of becoming the “next major league.” “NLL UnBOXed illustrates our bold approach and dedicated commitment to growing the game of lacrosse and welcoming new NLL fans to our uniquely entertaining sport. As we invite and welcome more communities, schools, families, and fans to the NLL, while strengthening our connections in these key areas throughout North America, we move one step closer to our goal of becoming ‘The Next Major League.’” The NLL hopes to expand its activation footprint to 60 communities across North America by the time the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles roll around. Those games will include sixes lacrosse — a format similar to the box lacrosse played in the NLL — as a medal sport for the first time since 1908. The NLL is also part of the Elevate 28 initiative, which aims to increase the number of people participating in lacrosse in the U.S. to 4 million by 2030. The 13 new UnBOXed identities, combined with the 14 current NLL franchises, bring the league’s total activation footprint to 36 markets throughout North America. Here’s a closer look at the new identities, with all graphics courtesy of the NLL’s Facebook page: The initial nine UnBOXed identities were launched in November 2023. Since then, though, the St. Louis entry changed its name from the Rhythm to the Howlers, and with the Ottawa Black Bears joining the NLL, the Ottawa Electrics became the Dallas Oilcats, an identity that uses elements of the now-defunct Panther City Lacrosse Club logo. The 2024-25 NLL regular season gets underway on Friday, November 29, with two games. A new Battle of Ontario will spark up with the Ottawa Black Bears playing host to the Toronto Rock, while the Vancouver Warriors visit the Colorado Mammoth later that evening."
SportsLogos.Net News,Old Time Hockey: Penn State Honors Their Roots With Throwback Alternate Jerseys,https://news.sportslogos.net/2024/11/14/old-time-hockey-penn-state-honors-their-roots-with-throwback-alternate-jerseys/college/,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 19:32:02 +0000","New alternate jerseys to make on-ice debut on Friday, November 15 against Wisconsin; design borrows heavily from jerseys worn in the 1940s, but also include nods to 1970s when hockey program was revived","Penn State’s men’s hockey program is honoring their deep roots with new throwback alternate uniforms, which they unveiled this week. The Nittany Lions launched the uniforms on their website and social media channels on Wednesday, November 13, and will wear them on the ice for the first time against Big Ten rivals Wisconsin on Friday, November 15. The jerseys borrow heavily from the Nittany Lions’ look in the 1940s, when Penn State’s hockey program was first founded. The white base has navy blue shoulders and a navy blue “PS” monogram on the front. Navy barberpole-style stripes adorn the sleeves and the socks. The navy blue numbers on the sleeves and back “mimics the number font used on the Generations of Greatness football jerseys,” while the contrasting nameplate on the back is navy blue with white lettering. The retro look is rounded out by brown pants and gloves. The pants also feature an interlocking “PSU” logo used in the 1970s that has a puck between the P and the S. The helmets are navy blue, with a raised white “Penn State” logo on the sides and white player numbers on the front. For captains, the C appears in a navy blue keystone on the right chest. “Penn State’s ice hockey tradition began well before we ever had a Division I program and we owe a debt of gratitude to those previous eras for establishing the foundation of Hockey Valley,” Nittany Lions head coach Guy Gadowsky said on the team’s website. “These throwback uniforms represent the different periods that helped build our program into what it is today and it’s our way of giving those teams a stick tap to the shins to express our appreciation to everyone that laid the foundation for the modern era of Penn State Hockey.” Old Time Hockey! 😤#HockeyValley pic.twitter.com/chvGMCj1wN Penn State played its first varsity hockey game on December 6, 1940, against Carnegie Tech. The program continued for four seasons until it was cut — along with cross country, swimming, gymnastics, tennis and golf — as part of cost-cutting measures during the Second World War. It returned for one season in 1946, but limited facilities meant it was once again dropped. In 1971, 3,000 people signed a petition to bring hockey back to Penn State. The team — dubbed the Icers — played 41 seasons and won seven national championships before the Division I era began in 2012. As a pure “start-up” team, it seemed too gaudy for them to display the name Penn State on the first jerseys. Thus, a custom logo was designed as a unique moniker for the front of the jersey. A creative, stylized amalgamation of letters and hockey imagery, the logo features the initials of Penn State University with two hockey sticks surrounding a puck in the negative space between the letters. The artist responsible for the design, a Penn State student, has remained anonymous despite multiple efforts. Following Friday’s game against Wisconsin — the first of a six-game homestand for Penn State — these alternate uniforms will enter their jersey lineup “as a true alternate to be worn multiple times throughout the next few seasons.”"
Sporting News RSS,Raiders tabbed as possible landing spot for $112 million superstar quarterback,https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/las-vegas-raiders/news/raiders-possible-landing-spot-112-million-superstar-quarterback/3ca0f70ddc45aabc8dea0496,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 23:47:11 +0000",The Las Vegas Raiders have been named a potential landing spot for a legendary signal caller this offseason.,"Dharya Sharma The 2024 season hasn't gone the Las Vegas Raiders way, as the team is 2-8 and has lost six consecutive games after a 2-2 start. Antonio Pierce's squad suffered a 34-19 defeat to the Miami Dolphins in Week 11 and will host the Denver Broncos in Week 12. The primary reason the Raiders have been abysmal in 2024 is atrocious quarterback play. Gardner Minshew has started most of the season for Las Vegas and has been one of the worst signal callers in the NFL, tossing eight touchdowns to nine interceptions with an 82.3 passer rating.  Aidan O'Connell also started a pair of games and looked uninspiring before breaking his thumb in the first half of the team's Week 7 contest versus the Los Angeles Rams.  Though many expect the Raiders to draft a young signal caller in April's draft, Sports Illustrated's Tom Dierberger and Karl Rasmussen believe Las Vegas is a potential landing spot for New York Jets' quarterback Aaron Rodgers.  The Raiders have long been searching for a solution at quarterback. They failed to lock one down this year, as Gardner Minshew, Aidan O'Connell and Desmond Ridder have all seen action under center. Of course, drafting a quarterback seems like the logical solution to their woes at the position, and it's practically a foregone conclusion that Las Vegas will be in the market for a young arm in next year's draft. Still, bringing in Rodgers for the 2025 season could also be a prudent move for the franchise. At 2-8, Las Vegas figures to be picking near the top of the board in next year's draft. It's possible whatever quarterback they select—whether it's Shedeur Sanders, Cam Ward, Quinn Ewers or someone else—might not immediately be ready to take over the offense. Rodgers is the single most experienced quarterback in the league, and there won't be a more proven option than him available in the offseason. The Jets' disastrous season has continued to spiral out of control, as the franchise fired general manager Joe Douglas on Tuesday just a month after moving on from head coach Robert Saleh. New York is 3-8 on the year and desperately needs a reset this offseason. According to Dianna Russini and Zack Rosenblatt of The Athletic, Jets owner Woody Johnson has been extremely disgruntled with Aaron Rodgers' play this season, and though the future Hall of Famer is under contract till 2026, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that Rodgers returns to New York in 2025. Though Rodgers is one of the greatest signal callers in league history, trading for the 10-time Pro Bowler would be a foolish move from the Raiders. The 40-year-old is clearly on the decline, and New York will likely demand premium draft capital for Rodgers' services. Instead, Las Vegas should draft a rookie quarterback and sign a veteran signal-caller to mentor the team's first-round draft choice. Trading for Rodgers would hoist zero benefits for the Raiders and only delay an inevitable rebuild.  A football fan who started his own website to talk about the Tennessee Titans, Dharya Sharma is an up-and-coming sports writer from Nebraska contributing to NFL content for TSN.

MLB's best from the 2024 season are being honored with awards voted on by the BBWAA (Baseball Writers Association of America), and some familiar faces are in the mix. Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani are looking to add another MVP to their collections, while Chris Sale and Zack Wheeler are two pitchers who are no stranger to being in the Cy Young discussion despite never winning the award. Here's the day-by-day schedule for the awards, as well as everything you need to know about the major award finalists and winners: In addition, here's a rundown of The Sporting News 2024 awards, as voted on by players, managers and league executives: Paul Skenes, Pirates Paul Skenes is your 2024 National League Jackie Robinson Rookie of the Year! pic.twitter.com/dkQkLZi7t0 Jackson Chourio, Brewers: The youngest player in baseball, Chourio suffered through a quiet first two months of his MLB career before morphing into one of the NL's most consistent hitters the rest of the way. While the slow start (and stardom of other contenders) might keep him from the award, Chourio proved he's the long-term face of the Brewers by hitting .275 with 21 home runs, a .791 OPS and 3.8 bWAR at just 20 years old. Jackson Merrill, Padres: Merrill would run away with the Rookie of the Year award in the AL, where competition was lighter, but he had a rookie season to be proud of regardless of the hardware. The 21-year-old just got better as the year went on, batting .292 with 24 home runs, 16 stolen bases and an .826 OPS. Merrill produced a slew of clutch hits for the Padres, and he looks like a fixture on the NL All-Star roster for years to come. Paul Skenes, Pirates: Skenes was unbelievable in his rookie season, posting a 1.96 ERA and 0.95 WHIP over 23 starts (133 innings). The 2023 No. 1 pick posted an 11.5 K/9 rate, striking out 170 batters and allowing only 10 home runs. A Cy Young finalist in his rookie season, Skenes faced tough competition from a talented group of NL rookies but has a stellar case to earn Rookie of the Year honors. Luis Gil, Yankees Luis Gil is your 2024 American League Jackie Robinson Rookie of the Year! pic.twitter.com/4bhKW4xdQ4 Colton Cowser, Orioles: Consistency was an issue for Cowser in his rookie season, but his power and defense were very real. The former No. 5 overall pick hit .242 with 24 home runs and a .768 OPS, finishing with a 3.1 bWAR after forcing his way into an everyday role in Baltimore. Luis Gil, Yankees: Gil was the Yankees' surprise savior when Gerrit Cole missed the first 10 weeks of the season, putting together a stellar first half. He wasn't as effective in the second half, which included a brief IL stint due to a back injury, but the overall numbers are strong. Gil posted a 3.50 ERA over 29 starts, notching 171 strikeouts and allowing just 6.2 hits per nine innings to make up for some control issues. Austin Wells, Yankees: Wells' bat caught fire early in the second half, though a severe slump in September likely ended his Rookie of the Year hopes. The former first-round pick hit just .229 with 13 home runs in 115 games, but is still ranked among the top AL rookies in WAR due to a high on-base percentage and strong work behind the plate. MORE: First look at top MLB free agents Pat Murphy, Brewers The NL Manager of the Year Award winner is Pat Murphy of the @Brewers! pic.twitter.com/zjfSlNt0cJ Carlos Mendoza, Mets: A first-year manager, Mendoza held the Mets together after a sloppy start and kept the team believing. New York made it all the way to the NLCS, finishing 89-73 even while getting just one start out of Kodai Senga. Pat Murphy, Brewers: The Brewers (93-69) defied all expectations in 2024, cruising to an NL Central title despite trading Corbin Burnes and losing Brandon Woodruff, Devin Williams and Christian Yelich to long-term injuries at different points. First-year manager Pat Murphy waited a long time to get his first full-time MLB managerial gig, but he made the most of it after Craig Counsell's departure and is a prime Manager of the Year contender. Mike Shildt, Padres: It took some time, but Shildt helped put the Padres' clubhouse back together after a tumultuous 2023 season under Bob Melvin. San Diego finally looked more like a team than a grouping of contrasting personalities, and the result was a dominant second half that pushed the Padres 24 games over .500 despite tempered expectations entering the year. Stephen Vogt, Guardians The AL Manager of the Year Award winner is Stephen Vogt of the @CleGuardians! pic.twitter.com/sqqNxhulgx A.J. Hinch, Tigers: Hinch looked like he had no business being here until about the second week of August, when the Tigers went from deadline sellers to legitimate postseason contenders. Detroit was nearly unstoppable the rest of the way, turning their season around to finish 86-76 thanks in part to some excellent bullpen management. With Hinch at the helm, the Tigers reached the postseason for the first time since 2014. Matt Quatraro, Royals: A 30-win improvement will make any manager a Manager of the Year finalist. Kansas City's front office deserves some credit, too, but Quatraro did an excellent job getting the Royals to believe they could defy the odds after finishing 56-106 in his first season. At 86-78, the Royals snapped a nine-year playoff drought. Stephen Vogt, Guardians: The path to contention for the Guardians in 2024 was simple: just hit a little bit and let a strong starting rotation do the rest. Well, Cleveland's rotation came apart at the same early on due to injuries and underperformance outside of Tanner Bibee, but the Guardians still rode a scorching-hot first half to 92 wins, an AL Central title and ultimately an ALCS appearance. That's a credit to Vogt, a first-year manager who retired from playing just two years ago.  Chris Sale, Braves Atlanta left-hander Chris Sale won the National League Cy Young Award, receiving 26 of 30 first-place votes. Sale, 35, had finished second, third, fourth, fifth (twice) and sixth (twice) in past Cy Young voting. Zack Wheeler finished second and rookie Paul Skenes third. Chris Sale, Braves: The Braves took a chance on Sale after a handful of injury-riddled seasons in Boston, and they reaped the benefits. Sale went 18-3 with a 2.38 ERA, leading all qualified pitchers with a sparkling 2.09 FIP and 11.4 K/9 rate. Sale added 225 strikeouts to a career total that is pushing 2,500. He's a Cy Young finalist for the second time after seven consecutive top-six finishes from 2012-2018. Paul Skenes, Pirates: Skenes was unbelievable in his rookie season, posting a 1.96 ERA and 0.95 WHIP over 23 starts (133 innings). The 2023 No. 1 pick posted an 11.5 K/9 rate, striking out 170 batters and allowing only 10 home runs. A larger sample size would have done wonders for Skenes' Cy Young case, but just becoming a finalist as a rookie puts him in rare territory. Skenes was named the 2024 N.L. Rookie of the Year already.  Zack Wheeler, Phillies: Wheeler is still chasing his first Cy Young Award, and he put together a strong bounce-back campaign in 2024 to assert himself as a finalist. The Phillies ace went 16-7 with a 2.57 ERA over exactly 200 innings of work, leading qualified NL pitchers with a 0.96 WHIP and posting 224 strikeouts. Narrowly the Cy Young runner-up in 2021, Wheeler is a prime contender once again. The AL Cy Young Award will be awarded Wednesday, Nov. 20. Emmanuel Clase, Guardians: Clase is the first reliever to be named a Cy Young finalist since 2008, and he earned every bit of it. The Guardians closer posted an unreal 0.61 ERA along with 47 saves over 74 appearances, finishing the year with a 0.66 WHIP. Clase allowed two home runs in the regular season and issued only 10 walks, making for one of the most dominant seasons by a reliever in MLB history. Seth Lugo, Royals: Lugo wasn't even a starting pitcher two years ago, but the Padres took a chance by converting him back into a starter in 2023 and the Royals bet on him with a multi-year deal last offseason. Lugo posted a 3.00 ERA over 33 starts (206.2 IP), shattering his career-high with 181 strikeouts and helping push the Royals to the postseason. Tarik Skubal, Tigers: Skubal was a wire-to-wire leader in the Cy Young conversation, fulfilling the preseason hype that surrounded him after a strong finish to 2023. The 27-year-old went 18-4 with a 2.39 ERA and 228 strikeouts over 31 starts for the Tigers, leading the AL with a 2.50 FIP and posting a 0.92 WHIP. Skubal was instrumental in leading the Tigers to a surprise postseason appearance. The NL MVP will be awarded Thursday, Nov. 21. Francisco Lindor, Mets: Lindor entered 2024 with five top-10 MVP finishes in his career, but he's a first-time finalist after a clutch year anchoring the Mets' lineup. He recovered from a slow start to lift New York to the postseason, batting .273 with 33 home runs, and .844 OPS and a 7.0 bWAR across 152 games. Between a red-hot bat and a strong glove, Lindor made a strong push for his MVP award in the second half. Ketel Marte, Diamondbacks: Marte missed 26 games in 2024, but he was stellar when on the field for the Diamondbacks. The 31-year-old hit .292 with 36 home runs and a .932 OPS, setting a career-high with 95 RBI and a 155 OPS+. This is Marte's first time as an MVP finalist, though he finished fourth in 2019.  Shohei Ohtani, Dodgers: The playing field for the NL MVP race looked a bit more even with Ohtani limited to a DH role this season, but the $700 million man exceeded all expectations in his first season with the Dodgers. Ohtani hit .310 with 54 home runs and 130 RBI, posting a 1.036 OPS and a career-high 190 OPS+. All led the National League. He posted the first 50/50 season in MLB history, stealing 59 bases, and won his first World Series. An MVP win would be Ohtani's third overall and first in the NL.  The AL MVP will be awarded Thursday, Nov. 21. Aaron Judge, Yankees: Postseason aside, Judge was simply unstoppable in 2024. The 2022 AL MVP hit .322 with 58 home runs, 144 RBI and a 1.159 OPS, leading MLB in the latter three categories. Judge posted a career-high 10.8 bWAR, and his 223 OPS+ was the best by any player in a full season since 2004. This is Judge's third time as a finalist, and a win would make him a two-time MVP. Juan Soto, Yankees: Soto was everything the Yankees hoped he would be in his first (and potentially only) season in New York. The four-time All-Star hit .288 with a career-high 41 home runs and a .989 OPS, appearing in all but five games and recording a career-high 166 hits. Still just 26, Soto will head into free agency with just about every factor working in his favor. Bobby Witt Jr., Royals: Witt morphed into a superstar in his third MLB season, leading the league with a .332 AVG and 211 hits while propelling the Royals to a surprise postseason appearance. With 32 home runs, 109 RBI and a .977 OPS, Witt was one of the most impressive players in baseball in his age-24 season and is a first-time MVP finalist.

They have been the center of many trade talks, especially about their Gold Glove rookie, Wilyer Abreu.  While it is common knowledge that insiders think he will be traded to the Chicago White Sox in a deal for pitcher Garrett Crochet, MLB insider Jon Morosi thinks there’s another good destination: the Seattle Mariners.  “A team like the Seattle Mariners, they need offense, guys that put the ball in play. Wilyer Abreu for me would be a great fit for the Mariners”. Abreu definitely would be a good fit for the Mariners’ outfield, as his Gold Glove would be paired with Seattle’s star outfielder Julio Rodriguez’s Silver Sluggers. Abreu also hit 50 extra base hits last season, second among AL rookies.  If Abreu is traded, Seattle would probably be preferred over Chicago. The Sox can still get an ace of their choosing from Seattle’s staff, and Abreu gets to play for a playoff contender.  .@jonmorosi did a whole segment on why the Red Sox could trade Wilyer Abreu this offseason.Generally these segments don’t happen unless they’re prompted with info.Specifically mentions the Mariners as a fit.(via @MLBNetwork)pic.twitter.com/B3wXyQ6uNe Red Sox proposed contract swap trade lands All-Star pitcher in Boston for three years, $72 million Red Sox have started meeting with Cy Young and All-Star aces MLB insider believes top international ace's best match is Red Sox Bleacher Report ranks Red Sox prospect as best in MLB for 2024-25 offseason Five-year Red Sox veteran starting pitcher has declined $21 million dollar qualifying offer; becomes free agent TJ Morin is a Sports Media graduate of Butler University.

In addition to the rivalry between the two teams, it appears the rivalry between Myles Garrett and T.J. Watt is one that is becoming more noteworthy. It all began back at the NFL Awards when Watt posted his displeasure on X ahead of the awards being announced, saying ""Nothing I'm not used to,"" This hinted to everyone that he knew he wouldn't be winning the Defensive Player of the Year award. Garrett won the award, to which many people disagreed and felt like Watt was snubbed. There are others, though, who felt that it wasn't a classy move by Watt spoiling the winner ahead of time, including Garrett himself. ""He's got to apologize when I see him,"" Garrett said.

Mark Pope, head basketball coach of the undefeated Wildcats, praised Robinson for his growth as a player after the game.","Ben Grunert Jaxson Robinson has played for four different schools in five years, but his latest stop brings him to the most talented team of his college basketball career. Four games into his Kentucky tenure, Robinson had his best game as a Wildcat.  Robinson scored 20 points in just 22 minutes of play as the Big Blue Nation stayed undefeated, moving to 4-0 with a 97-68 win over Lipscomb. In their previous win over Duke, Robinson had gone scoreless with an 0/4 shooting night. The 21-year-old transfer had the get-right game he needed against Lipscomb, shooting 6/10 from the floor and 3/6 from three. In his postgame press conference, Robinson talked about Kentucky’s unselfishness and how that selfless identity makes the Wildcats so special. “So it doesn’t always have to be (that) you’re the leading scorer of the team,” Robinson said (h/t Lexington Herald-Leader). “You don’t get all the publicity. You’re not plastered all over social media. But that’s what makes this team different. That’s what makes us Kentucky. We feel like as long as we’re all together, it doesn’t matter who shines. We just want to go out and win a championship.” First-year head coach Mark Pope may be new to the Blue Big Nation, but he has coached Robinson for three straight seasons. Pope coached Robinson at BYU for the last two years before both of them ended up in Kentucky. After Robinson’s explosion against Lipscomb, Pope praised the fifth-year senior for his leadership and growth as a player. “It’s been really inspiring to be able to witness his growth,” Pope said. “I don’t know how many times we’re going to get to coach players for three years anymore, but it’s been unbelievable to be able to coach him for two years and four games. And I love it. I’m really proud of him.” Competing in a loaded SEC, Robinson and the Wildcats sit at No. 10 in the most recent AP Top 25 poll.

With a loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday and then the Spurs on Tuesday, the Thunder now find themselves in second place in the Western Conference.  While much of their difficulties have been due to their lack of center play, OKC travels back to Loud City in hopes of obtaining a victory against a somewhat lackluster team. The OKC Thunder will be back at home in the Paycom Center to take on the Portland Trail Blazers tonight, Nov. 20, at 8:00 PM EST/7:00PM CDT and on FanDuel Sports Network - Oklahoma For the Thunder, here is what their potential lineup will look like for tonight's game: As for the Blazers, here is how they will potentially stack up against the Thunder: For OKC, Chet Holmgren (hip), Isaiah Joe (calf), Jaylin Williams (hamstring) and Nikola Topic (ACL) are all out. And for the first time this season, star center acquisition from the Knicks Isaiah Hartenstein is officially listed as day-to-day. There is a good chance he doesn't play, but if he does get limited minuted tonight, that is big news for Loud City. For Portland, Matisse Thybulle is out with a knee injury. Guard Anfernee Simons (chest) and Deandre Ayton (finger) are currently listed as day-to-day. This is a big game for the Thunder where if they do not show up to play, they could be looking at three-straight losses in just one week. Although it is still early in the season, adding five total losses to their record would put them around fourth or fifth place currently in the West. And with the conference being as competitive as ever, OKC needs as many victories as they can get. The last time the Thunder faced Portland was back on the first of November, and they beat the Blazers pretty handedly 137-114. While Chet was present during that game, he did not play very well (six points and only one board). It was headed by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jalen Williams, who combined for 52 points, 12 rebounds and ten assists. Per the past ten days of basketball, that is exactly how the Thunder have competed in games; all SGA and JDub. For the Thunder to get their second straight win of the season against the Blazers and add on to their 13-game win streak against the franchise, OKC needs to be able to minimize the amount of offensive boards and second-chance points while also capitalizing on fast break opportunities and have their deep bench support the current Thunder co-stars.   Back to work at home 🫡🏟️ Doors open at 5:30🎟️ https://t.co/dl2dM4VCEb📺 FanDuel Sports Network📻 @sportsanimal pic.twitter.com/siW5TUiSkg   OKC Thunder sign new center to fill in for their injured frontcourt NBA Legend hints at the idea of joining OKC Thunder in lieu of Holmgren injury Former NBA All-Star believes current Thunder team is better than the 2012/13 OKC roster Brody Bitters is a graduate from Butler University, where he studied Sports Media and Strategic Communications for four years.

On SI's Zach Nagy shared them in an organized list. ""LSU currently holds Top 5 Recruiting Class in America. The Headliners: - Bryce Underwood: No. 1 QB - Harlem Berry: No. 1 RB - DJ Pickett: No. 1 CB - Kade Phillips: Top 5 CB Now, it’s about holding onto the 2025 class,"" Nagy tweeted, highlighting how important it is for LSU to make an extra-strong roster to face the challenges 2025 season. If Kelly nabs some of these top prospects and lures them to LSU this offseason, the Tigers may have a mightier-then-expected comeback next season.  LSU will be losing star players like Will Campbell, Emery Jones Jr., and Harold Perkins Jr. after this 2025 season. So, Bryce Underwood remains their hope amid the string of rumors of him flipping to Michigan.  Underwood staying at LSU will be a major off-season win for Kelly, one that he needs badly. Kelly revealed his strategy to hold onto their recruits in the final weeks of the regular season ahead of National Signing Day on the Paul Finebaum Show. ""Certainly anytime that there's come losses, people are going to ask questions like I said before. But we've been in a constant conversation with our recruiting class,"" Kelly said. ""If you're just starting to pick up the phone and talk to them, you're going to lose them. So, we look at all the schools in the SEC. There's going to be additions and deletions in these last couple weeks with NIL,  with revenue-sharing that's coming on board. But relationships are really what this is at the core. And if you've got the right relationship, you're going to hold onto your players regardless of the situation. ""So now it's important for us to lean onto those relationships and the reason why you came here from the very beginning was to help us win a championship and that's what we're talking to our recruits about,"" the Tigers head coach further added, emphasizing on relying on their relationships with recruits. Kelly re-iterated the importance he places on communication with his players in his press conference on Monday.  With multiple losses this season, a solid recruiting class will be the only way for Kelly to escape the heavy online trolling with his job intact.

Cruz, the now ESPN analyst, opined during an interview in SiriusXM NFL radio that ""the Giants should approach the 2025 NFL Draft and with a tanking mentality so they can be in line to pick QB Arch Manning at the top of the draft in 2026,"" per JoeBucsFan.com. With Daniel Jones out, the Giants are very likely to try their best to get a franchise QB in the 2025 NFL draft, even if that means paying a price to trade up. Waiting for the end of the 2026 program, and tanking until then to get Manning would be a major, major risk for the Giants, one they could easily avoid. One they will likely avoid since Manning will still have the choice of staying in college for another season.  Now, about Manning: His stats were impressive in his first year but they are already improving, as the Longhorns backup QB has tallied for up to 195 already in his second year as compared to 27 snaps in his freshman season. This means he needs to be more on the field, possibly as the starter. Additionally, Manning's draft eligibility will not be a problem since he becomes draft-eligible in 2026. However, his experience at the college level might pose a question if the Manning heir decides to go pro in the 2026 NFL draft.  Manning's football acumen is evident in the games he plays. Given that Ewers will be off to the NFL after the 2025 season, Manning will have two years of college eligibility as a starting QB at the college level to develop his potential to the fullest, instead of going to the draft early with just one year under his belt as a starter. Kevin Harissh of Next Impulse Sports explains the reason why Manning will decide to make the Giants wait on him in the 2026 season.  ""NFL teams are no longer focused on developing young quarterbacks over time. Instead, they’re looking for quarterbacks who can step in and perform right away. According to a report from NFL Draft expert Matt Miller, this has NFL scouts and agents suggesting that quarterbacks shouldn’t even try to enter the draft until they’ve started for two seasons or more at the college level,"" Harissh writes.  ""Scouts and agents are telling college QBs to not leave school until they’ve started 2+ years. The NFL doesn’t truly develop QBs anymore outside of rare exceptions,"" Miller said in a post on X. The choice is Manning's. He can either choose to enter the draft early and prove himself to be an exception, or he can stay a year more in Texas before finally going pro.  Whatever he chooses will be a key factor in his NFL career.

Many of the state's top running backs have helped lift their teams into position for a deep postseason run.

Blanche has been a very consistent performer for the Spartans over the past three seasons, closing in on 3,000 all-purpose yards. He’s scored 10 times on the ground each of the past two seasons and is headed to play at Portland State next season. Running the ball for the nation’s top team, Davison has had a light workload. He’s rushed for 764 yards and 12 touchdowns, giving him 43 touchdowns in his four-year varsity career. He committed to Oregon in June after amassing 50 scholarship offers. Glover broke out with nearly 1,200 yards on the ground in 2023 and has followed that up with 1,584 through 10 games as a senior. He has 46 career touchdowns and has also contributed as a returner. Hawkins has carried the ball more than 450 times over the past two seasons, averaging more than seven yards per rush. This year, he’s run for nearly 1,500 yards and 28 touchdowns, adding more than 300 yards and five touchdowns through the air. Hoze broke out in 2023 and has improved on those numbers with 1,500 yards and 23 touchdowns through 10 games. He’s 33 yards shy of 3,600 for his career. Jackson is averaging 10 yards per carry as a senior and has scored seven times on the ground this year, giving him 50 for his career. Keanaaina has rushed for more than 1,700 yards in 10 games this season and recently passed the 4,000-yard mark for his career. He’s found the end zone 16 times this year while averaging over eight yards per carry. Paired with Blanche, Kelley has averaged more than nine yards per carry this season and has scored 28 touchdowns over three varsity seasons. Morris has gone over 1,100 rushing yards for the second consecutive year and sits at 1,597 total yards with 16 touchdowns through 11 games. Kansas is among the many schools that have extended a scholarship offer. Redeaux has gone over the 100-yard mark six times in nine games, scoring 12 touchdowns through last week. Georgia, Alabama and Ohio State are among his nearly 30 scholarship offers. Searcy has contributed to all three phases for the Pirates. He’s racked up 1,257 yards and 17 touchdowns on offense, also grabbing two interceptions on defense. Smith has nearly doubled his output from a year ago, rushing for nearly 1,500 yards and 19 touchdowns through 12 games. He’s also reeled in 23 passes for 230 yards. Turner has taken his game to the next level as a senior, rushing for more than 1,500 yards in 10 regular season games. He’s scored 47 touchdowns over the past two years and recently committed to Utah Tech. Villanueva has gone over the 200-yard mark in a game seven times this season including each of the past four.

The five-time All-Star led the Dallas Mavericks to their first NBA Finals appearance in over a decade, a run many fans and media members viewed as unexpected. However, some areas of concern have been his conditioning and lack of effort. Dončić has battled several injuries throughout his career, and it's fair to wonder how his conditioning has played a part in that. Kendrick Perkins, an NBA champion with the Boston Celtics in 2008, made his thoughts clear on a recent episode of the Road Trippin Show. “We got to stop letting Luka off the hook,"" Perkins said. ""Real talk—enough is enough. Like, do you know he's leading the league defensively with blowbys? No one is asking him to be Jrue Holiday… We're asking you to be a leader and put forth some [expletive] effort and fix your body language.” Dončić showed flashes of what he can provide on defense during Dallas' playoff run last season. He held a combination of Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, James Harden, and Norman Powell to 6-of-24 shooting as the primary defender in Game 2 of the Mavericks' 2024 first-round playoff series against the Los Angeles Clippers. However, his defensive effort hasn't been consistent, and it doesn't help matters when he spends a lot of time complaining to the refs and taking low-percentage 3-point shot attempts.  Dončić has also looked noticeably slow on offense this season. While Dončić is averaging 28.1 points through his first 14 games, he's shooting just 43.5%, including 32.4% from three-point range. Those numbers are significantly down from his averages of 33.9 points on 48.7% shooting, including 38.2% from downtown. For all of the talent that the Slovenian superstar possesses, the only thing that can stop him is himself at times. Sameer Kumar is a sports journalist who contributes to The Sporting News.

""So he's not going to make a lot of plays with his legs. The other thing he does at times, and where I think this might also be a reason they call quicker developing pass plays, is he does hold the ball where he won't get off the number one read. ""When I watch some film of him and stuff at times I go, man if Sarkisian doesn't dial it up perfectly, he'll just sit there and keep patting the ball until somebody comes open. All in all as I said you know this is a real good football team and definitely one of the best teams teams in college football."" However much celebrated the 20-10 win against Arkansas, or the sheer improvement in Texas's offense is, the lack of sharpness was evident in Ewers' performance on Saturday. As FanSided's Andrew Miller points out, Ewers' lack of downfield success limited the Longhorns' rhythm. ""The lack of a true vertical passing threat also hurt the Longhorns' offense in this game. Ewers only completed 1-of-6 deep passing attempts... and missed pretty badly on at least three of those incompletions in the deep passing game. He wasn't able to get in a good rhythm the way he did when he passed for over 300 yards and five touchdowns in the Florida win against Arkansas in the first half,"" Miller wrote. Ewers' leadership skills in driving the offense and leaving enough meat on the bone for them to flip the game in their favor are laudable, truly. However, with him going pro next season and expecting a suitable team in the 2025 NFL draft, the Longhorns quarterback needs to sharpen his judgment with the ball.

On Wednesday, the Red Sox signed Seby Zavala to a minor-league deal to potentially help with this issue. Zavala, 31, was a 12th-round pick of the Chicago White Sox in the 2015 MLB draft out of San Diego State. He made his debut with Chicago in 2019 and was designated for assignment in September 2023. The Arizona Diamondbacks claimed him off waivers and traded him (along with Carlos Vargas) to the Seattle Mariners for Eugenio Suarez. In 2024, Zavala appeared in 18 games for Seattle at the MLB level, hitting .154 with a .496 OPS, one home run and two RBIs. In Triple-A Tacoma, he hit .188 with a .701 OPS, four home runs and 16 RBIs in 33 games. Wong and top catching prospect Kyle Teel should provide the spark offensively this season, and the latter could grow into a great defensive catcher, but the fielding side of things is where Zavala has been much better. According to Tyler Milliken, Zavala finished 87th percentile in Blocks Above Average and 77th percentile in framing. While this could be a solid depth signing, Boston should still be looking for better options. 5 former Red Sox appear on 2025 MLB Hall of Fame ballot Red Sox protect two top prospects from Rule 5 Draft Red Sox reportedly in contact with top free agent pitcher Incredible Red Sox memorabilia collection of former Boston exec goes to auction Mike Masala previously served as the Managing Editor of USA TODAY's Dolphins Wire as well as a contributing writer at Patriots Wire.

Sporting News RSS,Heat could shockingly part with Bam Adebayo in trade for 76ers' $192 million star,https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/philadelphia-76ers/news/heat-shockingly-part-bam-adebayo-trade-76ers-192-million-star/1fee63a6c4554b456b9043ad,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 22:46:58 +0000",A proposed trade sends Joel Embiid to an Eastern Conference rival for one of his Olympic teammates on Team USA.,"Matt John The Philadelphia 76ers are in a hole this season. Even if they dig themselves out of it, there's no telling if that will lead to anything. Joel Embiid has not looked like himself to start the season, and if he doesn't get back to that level, the Sixers aren't a contender. There's still time for them to see if he can return to the MVP candidate he once was, but in that same window, if he proves that he can't, they're stuck with him. If this season ends in disaster, it's possible Philadelphia's front office is forced to trade him in the summer (at the earliest). Fadeaway World proposed a trade that would send Embiid to the Miami Heat, in which the Sixers could still maintain their status as one of the East's best teams at full strength. Heat Receive: Joel Embiid 76ers Receive: Bam Adebayo, Nikola Jovic, Duncan Robinson, 2027 First Round Pick, 2031 First Round Pick The Heat center, Adebayo, might not be the same caliber player that Embiid is when the latter is healthy, but he is a proven winner who has helped the Heat reach two NBA Finals. More than that, Adebayo is not nearly as injury-prone as Embiid. One of the Sixers' biggest issues in the playoffs is falling against the Boston Celtics. The Heat have managed to beat the Celtics in the postseason twice since 2020 and came within inches of doing it another time in 2022. Adebayo himself is one of the reasons why the Heat have been a thorn in Boston's side for as long as they have. As one of the league's best defenders, Adebayo's bread and butter has been how well he defends all five positions. Even if he's inferior to Embiid, his presence alone would make scoring harder for the Celtics. The other pieces would also give the Sixers more connectors. Robinson is one of the league's best three-point shooters in the league while Jovic's future is promising, though it may be a stretch to suggest he's a star in the making. A trade like this may take the Sixers down a peg as possible title contenders, but it would make them a team that no one else wants to face when the postseason comes around.

Sporting News RSS,Aaron Taylor sends impassioned plea for Georgia after Bulldogs’ College Football Playoff Rankings snub,https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/aaron-taylor-sends-impassioned-plea-georgia-bulldogs-college-football-playoff-rankings-snub/1e3ecf591ebbfbd560f65dc6,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 22:43:14 +0000","According to one CBS analyst, the Georgia Bulldogs deserve a little more respect.","Zain Bando When reviewing the Georgia Bulldogs' College Football Playoff placement, CBS Sports' Aaron Taylor lashed out. UGA is firmly back in the discussion at No. 10, entering a Week 13 contest against UMass, but Taylor feels that's too low. Taylor took the perspective of a Bulldogs fan as he described where he felt the committee went wrong in its placement. ""If I'm a Georgia fan, I'm wondering how the heck we're No. 10, and there's three teams ahead of us that don't have a Top 25 win,"" Taylor said on November 19. ""If you're Texas, if you're Indiana, who is the other one? Miami. Miami hasn't even played a Top 25 team. So, we got a situation. I'm not trying to disparage Texas, but like the inequity in scheduling has already become apparent. We're gonna try to rectify it, but it's not a fair, level playing field. If you're an SEC team, or some of these teams from these other conferences, you're gonna feel pretty [gypped.]"" Bulldogs coach Kirby Smart agrees with Taylor. “It’s a hard one because I don’t know what they’re looking for,” Smart said during his SEC media conference this week. “They can’t define that. It’s not simple, either. I mean, anybody can be on that committee and say, ‘This is what we’re looking for. This is our criteria and there’s so much that it overlaps things and everybody debates it and I don’t have time to really waste energy on it.” The Bulldogs will likely need to win out to make the SEC Championship, as their two losses are to Ole Miss and Alabama. For now, only time will tell what happens next. Zain Bando is a freelance writer for The Sporting News.

Neither is SEC Network host and radio show personality Paul Finebaum, who vehemently disagreed with Tuesday night's rankings, which placed the Bulldogs 10th behind Ole Miss, Miami, and Alabama. Finebaum said the committee needs to do its job thoughtfully, which is why the rankings are in their position. “It’s the Georgia Bulldogs because when you showed that graphic, you saw Georgia’s opponents all over the place, including Texas, the number three team in the country. They only beat Texas in Texas. Look, they played at Alabama. They lost at Ole Miss. They beat Tennessee. When you look at everyone else, Indiana doesn’t have a ranked team, they’ll get one this weekend. Penn State has lost to one. Every time I get on here every Wednesday morning, I say to myself, ‘Calm down. Don’t be an angry guy. Get off your lawn,'”  Finabuam said (H/T On3). Finebaum has had enough of the hypocrisy, even going so far as to say that some of the football coaches on the committee don't believe half of what their assessments tell them. ""But this committee is not serious,” Finebaum said. “There are football coaches on this committee and there is no way those football coaches can tell me or anyone else with a straight face that they really think Indiana, Penn State, Miami, schools like that are better than Georgia. It’s not possible.” Finebaum may be correct, but he also may be off-base. The Bulldogs (8-2, 6-2 SEC) are fresh off a much-needed win against Tennessee, firmly keeping them in the CFP discussion. It hosts UMass this Saturday before its regular-season finale against Georgia Tech. If Georgia can win, both will likely be in an excellent position to make the postseason independently. However, one more loss in the season could be over for good. It means to be seen what happens next, but for now, the SEC title race is a must-see TV gauntlet.

The UConn women's basketball head coach has been quickly approaching the all-time record for wins among men's and women's coaches in NCAA basketball history. The 70-year-old finally has the chance to overtake the No. 1 spot tonight, as the Huskies take on Fairleigh Dickinson. Just season, legendary Stanford women's basketball head coach Tara VanDerveer moved into the top spot on the list. But her retirement in April has left the door open for someone new to claim the title. Auriemma, the only active coach in the top 10, is ready to take the crown. Here's everything you need to know about the winningest coaches in NCAA basketball history. MORE: Geni Auriemma looks to break all-time wins record *Indicates active head coach. MORE: UConn's Geno Auriemma stands on the brink of history Auriemma started coaching the Huskies in 1985, making the 2024-25 season his 40th season with the program. UConn will be honoring Auriemma and his longtime assistant Chris Dailey tonight before the team's game. More than 60 program alumni are expected to attend as they celebrate four decades of coaching excellence. Auriemma has led UConn to 11 national titles throughout his tenure, the most in women's college basketball history. He has also won the Naismith College Coach of the Year award eight times and has had six undefeated overall seasons in Connecticut. While a huge achievement, becoming the winningest college basketball coach of all time just add to an already lengthy résumé for Auriemma. Auriemma is 70 years old, making him on the older side for an NCAA coach. The UConn coach was born in 1954 in Montella, Italy, and his family immigrated to the United States in 1961. Auriemma is not planning to retire anytime soon.  In June, the coaching great signed a five-year contract extension that will keep him at UConn through the 2028-29 season. So the era of Auriemma lives on — at least for five more years.  Cate Schiller is an editorial intern for The Sporting News affiliate and commercial content team, focused on global partnerships supporting live events, entertainment and travel.

This will be the 58th edition of these country music awards, and the show will begin at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.  The biggest night of the year in country music promises to be larger than life. The show will open with Post Malone and Chris Stapleton and include additional performances by Dierks Bentley, Luke Bryan, Ashley McBryde, Shaboozey, and Lainey Wilson.  STREAM: Watch the 2024 CMAs live with Fubo (free trial) George Strait will receive the 204 CMA Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award, and several artists will pay tribute to the country music legend.  With a night so big, surely the hosts will have to be on top of their game.

He had entered the country music circle because he was a big fan and because of Nationwide commercials with Brad Paisley. The Hall-of-Fame quarterback is no stranger to television hosting. He hosted 'Peyton's Places,' where he would interview quarterbacks and other NFL players around the country. Peyton and his brother Eli also host the Manningcast throughout the season, an alternate broadcast for certain 'Monday Night Football' games.  The simple answer is Manning is a huge country music fan. He recently donned his old Tennessee gear at a Morgan Wallen concert in Knoxville, and Manning's Omaha Productions produces ""It's All Country,"" which is like 'Peyton's Places,' but instead has Bryan interviewing today's country music stars.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

Guler, 18, joined Real Madrid in the summer of 2023 after impressing with Fenerbahce in the Turkish Süper Lig. However, the teenager has struggled to break into the first team at the Bernabeu and is said to be keen on a loan move to gain more regular playing time. According to reports, Arsenal believe they can help get Guler’s career back on track, much like they did with Odegaard. The Norwegian midfielder initially joined the Gunners on loan in 2021 before the club later made the move permanent. While Real Madrid may be reluctant to let Guler leave on a permanent basis at this stage, a loan deal could suit all parties involved. Arsenal are hopeful they can provide the young Turkish international with the platform to showcase his undoubted talent, which earned him a move to the Spanish giants in the first place. The report suggests Arsenal are eager to replicate the successful Odegaard case, where the midfielder flourished during his time in north London before becoming a key player for Real Madrid. Whether the Spanish club will be open to another loan arrangement remains to be seen, but Arsenal are evidently keen to add Guler to their squad in January."

The SkyBar, a 700-square-meter luxury space with a capacity of 200, was touted as the crown jewel of the stadium’s £1.5 billion redevelopment. Tickets were expected to cost up to £2,500 per match, potentially generating £500,000 per home game for Real Madrid. However, the SkyBar has remained unopened, six months after it was originally scheduled to welcome guests. This has prompted Anastasia Gourmet, the company awarded the rights to run the space, to file a lawsuit against the club. The lawsuit claims Anastasia Gourmet has been blocked from accessing the new premises, leading to an estimated £6 million in losses from suppliers. Real Madrid has not yet commented on the legal challenge. The delay in opening the SkyBar is reportedly due to issues with adapting the stadium to comply with local anti-noise regulations, after protests from neighbors. This has also led to a suspension of the Bernabeu’s concert hosting rights until spring 2025. With the majority of the Bernabeu’s £1.5 billion redevelopment complete, the final stages are now expected to be finished by January 2025. But the legal dispute over the SkyBar represents an unwelcome complication for Real Madrid as they seek to maximize the revenue potential of their revamped stadium."

The Spanish giants have been playing at the Estadio Olimpico for the past 18 months while a £1.25 billion renovation project is carried out on their home ground. The project aims to increase the stadium’s capacity from 99,000 to 104,000 and add a roof, luxury bars, and new escalators. Barcelona had hoped to move back to the Nou Camp before the end of 2024. However, UEFA rules prohibit clubs from changing stadiums during the initial phase of the Champions League. This means Barcelona would have had to split home games between the Nou Camp and Estadio Olimpico, which was deemed logistically difficult and costly. As a result, Barcelona have now confirmed they will not return to the Nou Camp until at least mid-February 2025. This delay will impact several La Liga matches, including games against Valencia, Alaves, and Atalanta in the Champions League, which will now take place at the Estadio Olimpico. Barcelona have promised to discount the price of season ticket passes to account for the matches moved from the Nou Camp. The club currently sits top of the La Liga table and is well-positioned to qualify for the Champions League knockout stages. The Nou Camp renovations are expected to generate an additional £25 million in annual revenue for Barcelona once completed."

Guardiola’s current deal was set to expire at the end of the 2024-25 season, but the new agreement will keep the 53-year-old Spaniard at the Etihad Stadium until 2026. This will extend his tenure as City’s manager to a decade. Since taking over in 2016, Guardiola has led Manchester City to 18 trophies, including six Premier League titles and the Champions League. His continued presence will be crucial as the club faces an investigation into alleged breaches of Premier League financial rules. The contract extension comes at a critical juncture, with City struggling with injuries and having lost their last four matches across all competitions – the worst run of Guardiola’s tenure. The news provides much-needed continuity as the team aims to regain their form. Speculation over Guardiola’s future had increased in recent months, particularly after the club announced the departure of long-time director of football Txiki Begiristain at the end of the season. However, the new agreement is expected to be confirmed in the coming days, ensuring stability at the top of the club."
Sports Weez,Handicap in Betting: How It Works and Why It’s Key to Win,https://sportsweez.com/handicap-in-betting/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 17:11:42 +0000","Handicap in betting isn’t just another layer of complexity for seasoned bettors; it’s the secret weapon that bridges the gap between raw luck and strategic dominance.

If you’ve ever watched a one-sided game and thought, “This is too predictable,” you’ve just stumbled upon the essence of handicap betting. It’s a way to make sports more thrilling, balance out mismatched teams, and, if played right, give you an edge that money-line or over/under bets simply can’t provide. Picture this: a clash between a powerhouse like Manchester City and a struggling team hanging on by a thread in the Premier League. Betting on City to win outright might feel like betting on the sun to rise—it’s obvious, but it won’t pay much. Handicap betting, however, levels the playing field, essentially giving the underdog a head start or the favorite a deficit to overcome. Suddenly, that David vs. Goliath match has teeth, and your bet transforms from a dull formality into a nail-biter. Here’s how it works: bookmakers assign a virtual advantage or disadvantage to teams before the game begins. For example, if City starts with a -2 handicap, they need to win by at least three goals for your bet to cash. If you’re rooting for the underdog with a +2 handicap, they could lose by one goal or even draw, and you’d still come out ahead. It’s not just betting; it’s re-imagining the game itself. This format is especially popular in football (soccer), basketball, and even esports, where disparities in team strength are common. Asian Handicap takes it a step further, slicing matches into smaller, more precise betting opportunities. With half-goal or quarter-goal handicaps, draws are eliminated from the equation, narrowing the focus on whether a team exceeds expectations or falls short. Suddenly, every possession, every shot on goal, every free throw carries heightened importance. If you’re new to this, let me tell you: the learning curve is more of a thrill ride than a struggle. Handicap betting requires a deeper understanding of the game, forcing you to analyze stats, predict performance trends, and identify hidden value in odds. It’s not just about gut feelings; it’s about doing your homework and loving every second of it. There’s something exhilarating about predicting that a lowly underdog will keep it tight against the juggernaut, only to watch your analysis unfold perfectly on the field or court. Success in handicap betting hinges on knowing the teams like the back of your hand. Which player is in form? Who’s nursing an injury? How do they fare on home turf versus away? Sure, it’s more effort than casually picking a winner, but the reward is sweeter. Watching a game through the lens of a handicap bet sharpens your senses. A 90th-minute consolation goal isn’t just filler—it’s the difference between victory and heartbreak. But don’t let the thrill cloud your judgment. Start small and focus on sports you genuinely understand. Handicap betting isn’t for blind guessing; it’s for those who savor the process, the nuance, the game within the game. And don’t get greedy chasing crazy odds. A +0.5 or -1 handicap might seem modest, but small victories pave the road to long-term gains. The real power lies in consistency, not in one-off miracles. The beauty of handicap betting lies in its ability to make every matchup meaningful. A lopsided fixture becomes an intellectual challenge. A seemingly dull game morphs into a strategic playground. Handicap betting doesn’t just change how you bet; it changes how you watch, think, and talk about sports. It’s not just a tool—it’s a philosophy. So, the next time you’re staring at a betting slip, wondering how to spice things up, remember the handicap. It’s not about complicating the game—it’s about leveling the field, elevating your strategy, and rediscovering the thrill of the unpredictable. In a world of simple yes-or-no outcomes, handicap betting is the curve-ball that turns you from a casual observer into a sharp-minded competitor. That’s why it’s key to win."

But this isn’t a gut-instinct bet or a lucky hunch; this is calculated precision—an algorithm running millions of simulations while you sip your drink. AI sports betting isn’t just a buzzword. It’s a revolution, and it’s flipping the odds, literally and figuratively, in favor of gamblers. AI thrives on data, and in sports, there’s plenty of it. Every pass, every foul, every weather report, and every player injury—it’s all fed into these artificial brains to generate predictions more precise than a veteran handicapper’s wildest dreams. Gone are the days when you’d rely on your buddy’s “expert” insight about which team to back. With AI, you’re armed with more data than a Vegas bookmaker has scribbled on their chalkboards. Take, for example, predictive modeling. This is where AI doesn’t just analyze past games; it dissects them. It examines patterns, finds correlations, and even evaluates the emotional state of players based on interviews or social media posts. A star quarterback had a fight with his coach last week? That’s in the algorithm. The underdog team just switched to a new playbook? The AI factors in their past games under similar circumstances. It’s like having a crystal ball—if the crystal ball could also solve calculus in a nanosecond. Gamblers are also seeing the rise of AI-driven platforms that level the playing field. Apps and services now offer real-time betting recommendations, using machine learning to assess how odds shift during a game. You don’t have to panic when the team you backed goes down early in the first quarter. The AI calculates whether a comeback is likely and suggests if you should double down or hedge your bet elsewhere. It’s all about options—smarter, faster, and grounded in cold, hard data. One of the most jaw-dropping aspects is live betting. Picture this: You’re watching a soccer match, and in the 62nd minute, the AI predicts a 72% chance of a specific player scoring. You place your bet. Ten minutes later, the ball sails into the net, and your phone buzzes with winnings. The system analyzes momentum, player fatigue, substitutions, and more—all faster than any human ever could. Of course, it’s not all sunshine and fat wallets. The sportsbooks are using AI, too. They’re monitoring betting patterns, detecting anomalies, and adjusting odds at lightning speed. They can even predict how the general betting public will react to certain outcomes and set lines to protect their profits. It’s like an arms race, gamblers vs. the house, and AI is the weapon of choice for both sides. Some skeptics argue that AI takes the “fun” out of gambling, turning it into a science project instead of an adrenaline rush. But let’s be real: isn’t the point of betting to win? And if you can turn a weekend hobby into a lucrative side hustle thanks to AI, why wouldn’t you? It’s not just hardcore gamblers jumping on this bandwagon, either. Casual fans are starting to dip their toes in, lured by the promise of smarter bets. Who wouldn’t want a tool that tells you, with a solid degree of confidence, which underdog might pull off an upset? It’s like having a friend who’s memorized every stat in sports history—and never gets tired of crunching numbers. The implications are massive. AI isn’t just about gambling; it’s reshaping how we think about risk and reward in general. It’s teaching us that intuition, while exciting, isn’t as reliable as a well-trained neural network. And while luck will always have its place in sports betting, AI is making it clear that skill—or at least access to superior tools—plays an increasingly dominant role. So, next time you place a bet, remember: somewhere, an AI is crunching numbers, making predictions, and probably giving someone else the edge. The question is, will it be you?"

If you’ve ever found yourself staring at a lineup of games, trying to make sense of the chaos and come out on top, you’re not alone. But the truth is, the pros don’t leave things to chance. They’ve got a toolkit of strategies that make predicting a straight win feel almost like a science. Let’s dive into what makes their approach so effective, and maybe, just maybe, you’ll see your bets start to pay off in ways you never imagined. First off, let’s clear one thing up: betting isn’t magic. Forget the myths about “fixed games” or whispering insiders who supposedly know the outcome. Real success starts with research. The pros don’t just glance at the league table and pick the team at the top. They dig deeper. Think form analysis. How has the team been performing in their last five games? A squad might be leading the table, but if they’ve just limped through a streak of draws or narrow wins, their confidence might not be as solid as it seems. Patterns in form reveal more than just who’s winning—it shows how they’re winning. Dominating games? Or scraping through by sheer luck? That makes a world of difference. Now, let’s talk head-to-head records. Teams often have psychological edges against specific opponents. You know those matchups where even the strongest squad crumbles against a so-called underdog? That’s not coincidence. Call it history, call it mentality—whatever it is, it matters. Before predicting a straight win, always check how the teams have fared against each other in the past. Even if Team A has been flying high all season, a poor track record against Team B could be their Achilles’ heel. Injuries and suspensions are another massive factor. Imagine betting on a top-tier team without knowing their star striker is out with a hamstring issue or their key defender is suspended. That’s the kind of oversight that can sink even the most “obvious” predictions. Stay updated on team news. If half the squad is out or fatigued from back-to-back fixtures, they’re far less likely to deliver that confident win. One trick that sets pros apart is how they evaluate the stakes of a game. Is it a must-win for one side? Or a dead-rubber match where the outcome doesn’t matter? A team fighting for survival in a relegation battle will likely play with desperation and heart, while a team comfortably mid-table might already be mentally checked out. Motivation, or lack thereof, can completely flip the narrative of a game. Here’s where it gets even more fun: analyzing the manager’s tactics. Certain managers are just brilliant at grinding out results, especially in high-pressure scenarios. Watch for interviews, press conferences, and recent tactical shifts. A manager who talks about tightening up the defense probably won’t let their team play recklessly, making a straight win more plausible if they’re up against a weaker attack. Let’s not forget the betting odds themselves. They tell a story. If a team widely expected to win suddenly sees their odds shift, ask yourself why. Odds don’t move without reason—sharp bettors and insiders might know something you don’t. Always cross-reference odds movements with your own research to avoid surprises. And finally, trust your gut—but only if it’s backed by data. Betting isn’t about whims or “feelings.” Sure, sometimes you’ll have that inexplicable hunch, but if it’s not rooted in solid evidence, it’s better to skip the bet than gamble blindly. Straight wins aren’t guaranteed, but by layering your intuition over a foundation of research, you’re giving yourself the best shot. So, the next time you’re ready to predict a straight win, remember: it’s not about being flashy or making wild guesses. It’s about playing smart. Learn the teams, read the stats, and keep your finger on the pulse of what’s happening in the world of sports. Bet like a pro, and soon, you’ll find yourself ahead of the curve."

<h1>Zibanejad Shines as Rangers Outclass Canucks in Fierce NHL Showdown</h1>
<p>Mika Zibanejad, with a goal and an assist to his name, led the New York Rangers to a thrilling 4-3 triumph over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/edmonton-oilers-triumph-over-vancouver-canucks-a-night-of-stellar-performances/"">Vancouver Canucks</a> on Tuesday evening. Will Cuylle and Kaapo Kakko joined the offensive party, each recording a goal and an assist, while Chris Kreider netted the decisive goal halfway through the third period.</p>
<h2>Rangers' Road Record Bolstered, Canucks' Woes Deepen</h2>
<p>Adam Fox played his part with a double assist as the Rangers celebrated their 7th road victory, strengthening their impressive 7-1-0 away record. Igor Shesterkin denied 21 attempts on goal, adding to the Canucks' frustrations on their home ice.</p>
<p>Vancouver's offensive efforts saw goals from Quinn Hughes, Kiefer Sherwood, and Conor Garland. Between the pipes, Arturs Silovs fought valiantly with 29 saves but couldn't prevent the Canucks' loss. The defeat was a bitter pill to swallow, particularly following the news earlier that day of J.T. Miller, the team's star center, taking an indefinite personal break.</p>
<h2>Takeaways from The Ice</h2>
<h3>Rangers:</h3>
<p>Artemi Panarin's impressive seven-game point streak came to an end. The left winger, who had been on a roll with four goals and five assists over the course of the streak, failed to make a mark on Tuesday's scoresheet.</p>
<h3>Canucks:</h3>
<p>With Miller absent, the Canucks' bench depth was thoroughly examined. In addition to Miller, Vancouver missed the services of all-star goalie Thatcher Demko (knee), sharpshooter Brock Boeser (upper body), and defenseman Derek Forbort (lower body). Coach Rick Tocchet revealed that both Boeser and Forbort had hit the ice on Tuesday morning, and Demko had put together a string of strong practices, but he remained tight-lipped about their return dates.</p>
<h2>Kreider's Decisive Strike; Rangers' Penalty Kill</h2>
<p>The game's pivotal moment came 10:43 into the third period when Kreider, on a pass from Zibanejad, found the net from the bottom of the faceoff circle, notching his ninth goal of the season.</p>
<p>An important statistic from the clash was the Rangers' successful penalty kill. They nullified the Canucks' three power plays, maintaining their reputation as the league's second-best penalty killers, boasting an 88.2% efficiency.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>The Rangers will look to keep their momentum when they face the Calgary Flames on Thursday. Meanwhile, the Canucks will attempt to bounce back during their six-game road trip, starting in Ottawa on Saturday.</p>

<h1>Flames' Netminder Dustin Wolf Dominates Ice with Stellar Performance</h1>
<p>Tuesday night's intense NHL showdown saw <a href=""https://21sports.com/dustin-wolf-shines-bright-flames-edge-predators-in-a-goalkeepers-duel/"">Dustin Wolf</a>, the <a href=""https://21sports.com/thrilling-shootout-victory-sabres-douse-flames-in-nhl-showdown/"">Calgary Flames</a>' netminder, shine with a remarkable performance. Wolf stopped 28 shots in regulation and remained unbeaten for two attempts during the shootout. His sterling defense was instrumental in the Flames' 2-1 victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/mcdavids-brilliance-and-draisaitls-double-bring-down-islanders-oilers-thrilling-victory-recapped/"">New York Islanders</a>.</p>
<h2>Andersson and Shootout Goals Propel Flames to Victory</h2>
<p>The Flames' Rasmus Andersson netted the only regulation goal for Calgary, his first in seven games, ending a point drought. The game moved into a shootout where Andrei Kuzmenko and Justin Kirkland came through for the Flames. The lone goal for the Islanders came courtesy of Pierre Engvall, who netted his third goal of the season and his third consecutive match scoring.</p>
<h3>Wolf Stands Tall Against Palmieri and Horvat in Shootout</h3>
<p>Wolf, who now boasts a 7-2-1 record, showcased his superior goaltending skills by denying attempts from Kyle Palmieri and Bo Horvat during the shootout. On the other end of the ice, Islanders' Semyon Varlamov made 30 saves but couldn't prevent his record from slipping to 3-3-2.</p>
<h3>Missed Opportunities for the Islanders</h3>
<p>The Islanders had a golden opportunity to snatch the victory in overtime with a power play. However, a shot from Noah Dobson only found the crossbar, leaving the scoreline unchanged.</p>
<h2>Game Highlights: Tense Moments and Key Stats</h2>
<p>The Islanders applied considerable pressure early in the third period, but Wolf remained impenetrable, denying a particularly threatening shot from Horvat. Meanwhile, Calgary's power play, ranking 30th, waited over 46 minutes for their only man advantage of the game. They capitalized on this opportunity with Andersson's powerful slap shot finding the back of the net past Varlamov.</p>
<p>A pivotal moment came during the shootout. After Yegor Sharangovich and Palmieri's attempts were denied, Kuzmenko put the Flames in the lead with a swift backhand under the crossbar. Following Wolf's save on Horvat's attempt, Kirkland sealed the deal with a quick glove-side shot.</p>
<p>Despite scoring three or fewer goals in 16 consecutive games, the Flames have maintained a respectable 7-6-3 record, owed largely to their reliable goaltending.</p>
<h2>What's Next for the Teams</h2>
<p>The Islanders look forward to concluding their five-game road trip in Detroit, while the Flames prepare to host the Rangers this Thursday. The Flames will be keen to build on this victory and continue their formidable form.</p>

<h2>Anaheim Ducks Triumph Over Chicago Blackhawks in a Fierce 3-2 Showdown</h2>
<h3>Killorn's Stellar Play in the Third Period Elevates Ducks to Season's Highest Win Streak</h3>
<p>In a thrilling Tuesday night faceoff, the <a href=""https://21sports.com/ducks-stage-grand-comeback-to-overthrow-red-wings-a-night-of-firsts-and-power-play-dominance/"">Anaheim Ducks</a> clinched a third consecutive victory, their season's best, by defeating the <a href=""https://21sports.com/chicago-blackhawks-reassign-key-players-to-bolster-development-strategy/"">Chicago Blackhawks</a> 3-2. Alex Killorn was the man of the match with a goal and assist in the pivotal third period, steering the Ducks to a win.</p>
<p>Killorn levelled the score at 2-2, 5:10 into the third period, with a skilfully executed backhand shot. He followed this up with an impeccable assist to Leo Carlsson, setting up a backdoor tap-in, leaving 10:22 on the clock. Pavel Mintyukov added to Ducks' tally, marking their fourth win in five games.</p>
<h2>Ducks' Dynamic Duo: Zegras and Gibson</h2>
<p>Trevor Zegras displayed his prowess with two assists, and John Gibson fortified the Ducks' defense with 18 saves. Conversely, the Blackhawks were handed their fifth defeat in six games. Jason Dickinson's two goals, both set up by Connor Bedard, and Arvid Soderblom's 21 saves, weren't enough to secure a win.</p>
<p>In the first period, Dickinson's one-timer put the Blackhawks ahead with 2:57 left on the clock. He extended the lead to 2-1, bagging his fourth goal of the season, 3:54 into the second period. This follows the Blackhawks' 4-2 victory over the Ducks in their first season meeting on November 3.</p>
<h3>Takeaway Points from the Game</h3>
<p>Despite playing on the road for the second consecutive night, the Ducks delivered an impressive performance in the third period. They had previously triumphed 4-2 against Dallas on Monday. The Blackhawks, on the other hand, despite some promising forward combinations, struggled to find the net, scoring just seven regulation goals in the past six games.</p>
<h2>The Deciding Moments and Key Statistics</h2>
<p>The game witnessed a crucial moment when Soderblom was replaced with an additional attacker, approximately 1:40 left in regulation time. However, Ryan Donato's attempt was denied by Gibson with about a minute to spare.</p>
<p>Bedard, the 19-year old prodigy, has provided 51 assists in 87 games, becoming the fourth teenager in franchise history to record 50 career assists, following Eddie Olczyk (80), Patrick Kane (65), and Bobby Hull (53).</p>
<h3>What's Next in the NHL?</h3>
<p>The Anaheim Ducks are set to return home to face the Buffalo Sabres on Friday night, while the Chicago Blackhawks will host the Florida Panthers on Thursday night.</p>

<h1>Minnesota Wild Triumphs Over St. Louis Blues, Thanks to Kaprizov's Stellar Performance</h1>

Jonas Brodin and Ryan Hartman also contributed to the scoreboard, while Filip Gustavsson's 22 saves were instrumental in securing the win, improving the Wild's season record to 12-3-3.</p>
<h2>Blues Struggle Despite Perunovich and Neighbours' Efforts</h2>
<p>On the Blues' end, Scott Perunovich and Jake Neighbours managed to find the net, while Jordan Binnington pulled off 24 saves. The team witnessed the return of Robert Thomas after an absence of 12 games due to a fractured right ankle. Despite these efforts, the Blues couldn't secure the win.</p>
<h3>Decisive Moments in the Third Period</h3>
<p>The game's turning point came when Brodin netted his second goal of the season with just over six minutes left in the third period, edging the Wild in front with a 3-2 lead. To seal the deal, Kaprizov chipped in with an empty net goal, marking his second of the game and 13th of the season, with only 1:23 left on the clock.</p>

<p>A potential game-altering moment occurred three minutes before the end of the third period. Referees Kelly Sutherland and Corey Syvret overlooked a likely high sticking penalty on Jared Spurgeon that could have given the Blues a late power play.</p>
<h3>Kaprizov's Scoring Streak</h3>
<p>Kaprizov's performance was noteworthy, accumulating 12 points (six goals, six assists) and recording at least one point in each of his last six games.</p>

Toyota Center. Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports Debate Are the Rockets right to snub Giannis for their young core, or missing a golden opportunity? Giannis Antetokounmpo has practically ingratiated himself into Milwaukee. Any mention of the ‘Greek Freak,’ and you automatically identify it with the ‘Brew City’. As such, trade rumors surrounding the 2x MVP hadn’t gotten as much attention as they normally get. That is not to say, it did not get people talking. Just not the way you would imagine. The Bucks’ rocky start to the season was the beginning of the trade rumors. A team that should already be instilling the ‘fear of the deer’ in the league has fallen far short of expectations. But even so, a trade to the Houston Rockets was something no one really saw coming. However, when an NBA Insider reports the possibility of such a thing, it’s only natural for everyone to give it some thought. Marc Stein wrote on Sunday that “whispers have begun to percolate among rival teams monitoring a potential down-the-road Houston pursuit” of Giannis Antetokounmpo. Needless to say, once it caught the attention of the Rockets’ beat writers, Kelly Iko of The Athletic took it upon himself to get to the bottom of it.

Another week, another pair of CFB opponents are ready to slide under each other’s skin. The Rutgers Scarlet Knights set sight to host the Illinois Fighting Illini at Piscataway in another exciting big noon kickoff. Rutgers had some ego boost with two big wins under their belt, but that doesn’t mean they will make it any easier. Illinois, sitting at 7-3, heads to week 13 as a slim favorite by a single point. So, the last thing you can expect from the match is a lopsided showdown. It is going to be a ‘sweat till the clocks run out game’ for both the big power football programs. Now, if you are feeling all ears for the on-field commentary of the high-voltage game, we have some interesting names for you. Illinois has been on quite a tear throughout the season, landing at No. 25 in the third CFP rankings of the 12-team playoff. Despite not making headlines like the Big 10 frontrunners, The Illinois College Blueboys are chasing their kind of record. They will look to rack up eight wins for the second time in three seasons and inch closer to its first nine-win season since 2007. The streak started with a four-game win, including a breathtaking showdown against Penn State. But a mid-season slump got the better of him and they dropped it thrice for the last four matches. Saturday’s show might not do a lot of hell and difference into the current roster setting, but the game will provide them with a lot of closures on their respective strengths and weaknesses. Andrew Siciliano, and Michael Robinson, will call the game with all their passion and grit.

They have a well-documented history together of taking the announcer’s table to the fire when a prized QB posts his first touchdown after a painful comeback. The aura of the stadium feels different when it has the Siciliano-Robinson duo in it. However, putting aside the sportscasters’ slew, let’s just catch The Rutgers head coach Greg Schiano’s headspace ahead of a crucial weekend fight. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Will Illinois overcome their mid-season slump, or is Rutgers ready to exploit their weaknesses? Debate The Rutgers surpassed a huge transition over the last few years before the quality addition of Running back Kyle Monangai, linebacker Tyreem Powell, defensive end Aaron Lewis and many more changed the course of the event outright. From arguably the worst the worst Power 5 football program in America to clinch a bowl eligibility, this is quite a journey. The veteran coach sees and studies what the opponents lack and will surely find a way to gently exploit or just make the boys aware of their mental background. ”They lost their lead dog, and now they’re doing it by the committee and they’re being effective the way they’re doing it,” Schiano addressed the lead back Kaden Feagin’s season-ending injury. But he knows even without Feagin the team has enough strength to deliver. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad ”I think that all goes back to their offensive line.

Having a powerful sponsor in NASCAR is one of the keys to success. Being backed up by someone like Anheuser-Busch, the parent company of Budweiser and Busch beers, teams get a lot of funding and exposure, which is key to finding a good spot in the series championship. While Anheuser-Busch was reconsidering its sponsorship with HMS, they decided to exit the team and continue with Dale Earnhardt Jr. as the driver left for his own venture. Dale Jr.’s team was by no means in a bigger position than HMS in NASCAR; however, the sponsors believed that being the legacy of the late Dale Earnhardt Sr., his son had something big coming for him. Although Junior did not win a Cup Series title, he today stands as one of the most popular motorsport drivers to ever live. So when Steve Uline, the sports marketing executive for Anheuser-Busch, came down to the Dale Jr. Download podcast, it was only fair that he revealed the story to Kelley Earnhardt Miller. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The story kicks off with a bit of frustration. As the sponsor for Hendrick Motorsport’s third car in 1998, the team wasn’t delivering results compared to their championship-winning cars. “We were the third car. I think we were the 25 cars there. We had Kenny Schrader, who we loved because he was a St. Louis guy,” recalls Steve Uline, the sports marketing executive for Anheuser-Busch. But despite a strong driver lineup, including Schrader and Ricky Craven, things just weren’t clicking. “We just weren’t having the success,” Uline admits. At this point, the sponsorship team began to reevaluate. They looked at all sorts of drivers—top 10 contenders, under-funded teams with potential, and up-and-coming stars. That’s when they set their sights on Dale Jr., even though he had yet to win a Busch Series race. “Dale Jr. had not won a Busch Series race yet, you know. And, obviously, we had a relationship with your father through Busch beer,” Uline explains on the Dale Jr. Download. This connection through Junior’s legendary father, Dale Earnhardt Sr., sparked interest. The timing felt right to make a change. “We’re big in the sport, probably the biggest, and certainly, we’ve got a big presence in NASCAR,” Uline recalls. But every week, they watched Rusty Wallace dominate while they struggled with their own driver lineup. “Rusty’s kicking our butt in the two cars,” Uline confesses, admitting that fierce competition in the beer world—especially with Miller—pushed them to make a move. “We didn’t want Miller beating us at anything,” he says, which fueled their desire to find a fresh face who could bring a new spark. Is Dale Jr.'s popularity proof that NASCAR is more about personality than just winning titles? Debate And that fresh face turned out to be Dale Jr. The deal was set in motion with a trip to Hendrick Motorsports, where Uline and Mike Hargrave, who oversaw motorsports for Anheuser-Busch, met with Rick Hendrick’s brother, John, to discuss a potential shift. “We decided to go after Junior… I flew down there with Mike Hargrave, who oversaw motorsports for us,” Uline remembers, setting the stage for one of the biggest sponsorship shifts in NASCAR history. However, that doesn’t come close to the extent that Dale Jr. has reached today when it comes to bringing in money for NASCAR. Dale Earnhardt Jr. recently gave fans an inside look at the soundtrack for the upcoming NASCAR video game, which is being developed by iRacing. On the Dale Jr. Download, he shared that his long-time friend Steve Meyers at iRacing reached out to him for some help in putting together a killer playlist for the game. “One of the things that’s really important, I think, is trying to create a soundtrack,” Dale Jr. said. He even got a few drivers involved to pitch some songs, though he’s keeping their picks a secret for now. But it’s clear he’s all in on making it a soundtrack that fans will love. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad via Imago Dale Earnhardt Jr To really get the ball rolling, Dale Jr. took his search for the perfect songs to social media. “I tweeted about it. I said, ‘Hey, what songs are a must?'” he said, and before long, the NASCAR Reddit community jumped on it. The thread quickly turned into a Molly Hatchet fan club, with the song “Flirting with Disaster” getting lots of love. “It was funny seeing the list of songs people suggested,” Dale Jr. said. But it’s not all about picking songs—Dale’s also learning the ins and outs of getting the rights to music. “It’s not a simple situation,” he admitted. “You’ve got to reach out to the people who own the license, and sometimes it’s multiple people.” The game, expected to drop in the fall of 2025, will give fans an authentic NASCAR experience, and from the sound of it, the soundtrack is going to be a major part of that vibe.

Readers are invited to join him as he delves into the world of TGL, exploring its unique blend of technology, teamwork, and competition. “Pumped to be a tiny part of @TGL this year as the lead writer at http://tglgolf.com. There is so much potential for what this league could be, and I’m excited (and hopeful) to watch it unfold. First piece for the site drops Thursday!”, he said in his latest post on X. But there’s a problem: see, the thing is, Porter has been a very loud hater of LIV Golf, and his new role at TGL raises interesting questions about his stance on the rival league and how it will influence his coverage.

Is Kyle Porter a hypocrite for joining TGL after bashing LIV Golf's team concept? Debate Starting off strong with what this one fan said, “Hard pass”, while the other said “Wait, you suddenly like the team concept? After $hitting on LIV since its inception. Okayyyy buddy. lol”, and well it is true. Porter has been pointing out his criticisms about LIV Golf for quite a while now, and the 2024 major season only reinforced his skepticism. Noting the lackluster performances of LIV’s top players, Porter expressed his bafflement to Fried Egg Golf, saying, “I’m glad you brought up LIV, one of my takeaways from this year was their players sucked at majors, outside of Bryson [DeChambeau].”  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Despite DeChambeau’s impressive showings, including a US Open win and strong finishes at The Masters and PGA Championship, other LIV stars like Jon Rahm, Cameron Smith, Brooks Koepka, and Dustin Johnson failed to deliver, with Porter labeling their performances as “mediocre” or “bad.” This was exactly what some fans pointed out by saying, “Ripping LIV but jumping on board for this stupid shit is hilarious Kyle”, and “Can’t wait for your a** to sit on here and talk about how this is a good product, but LIV is so awful to watch.” Not a while ago, Porter begrudgingly conceded that one of the league’s innovative features has won him over, stating, “I hate to admit this, but the live team leaderboard is very cool.” It’s clear that Porter’s admiration for this aspect of LIV Golf was reluctant as if he was forced to acknowledge its appeal despite his overall reservations about the league. Another fan took a harsh dig at Porter and wrote, “You’re officially a clown”. So, that was what the fans and Porter think of TGL. What are your thoughts on the matter?

Serrano v Katie Taylor: Press Conference PUBLICATIONxNOTxINxBRA Debate Was the Tyson vs. Paul fight a true boxing match or just a circus act for entertainment? This past weekend, Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul’s fight has been making all the noise on social media platforms. This was indeed a highly anticipated bout between the former heavyweight boxing champion and a YouTube sensation. Although most of the fans were rooting for Tyson’s win, it was Jake Paul who was deemed the winner by the unanimous decision. The outcome of this fight has certainly become a huge talking point ever since. The most common complaint was the lack of intensity and the fight living up to the hype. Some conspiracy theorists even went as far as to say that Tyson threw the fight so that Paul could win. Pumped after the victory, Paul even challenged former UFC champion Connor McGregor to a fight. But NASCAR and IndyCar driver Conor Daly misunderstood Paul’s message, and he challenged him in return. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Despite the criticism and arguments about Jake Paul and Mike Tyson’s fight, the event was a massive success. The fight that took place at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, attracted a total of 72,300 fans. Moreover, the entire event was streamed on Netflix, and it hit a peak watching of 65 million around the world, whereas it hit 38 million concurrent streams in the United States. There are also reports that despite losing the fight, Mike Tyson took home a good $20 million. And this astronomical figure is something that Conor Daly has his eyes on. Racing is indeed an expensive sport, and with the backing of sponsors or a racing family, it is hard for a driver to continue racing at the highest level. In Daly’s case, he’s still on the hunt for his full-time ride in IndyCar. A couple million dollars certainly would do the trick for Daly, and this is why he sent out a challenge to Jake Paul. “I know those guys made insane money doing that fight, and it didn’t even look like that much of a fight. So why not throw a tweet out there and saying, Hey, if this is to me, I mean, consider me locked in; the price I get paid is maybe 6-10 million dollars? Maybe we have a conversation, so would I be actually willing to do that? I will almost do anything to get in a race car for a full-time IndyCar.” Daly said this while speaking to Dirty Mo Media. Would @ConorDaly22 fight Jake Paul to fund his IndyCar ride? 👀🥊 pic.twitter.com/7CnFuxTGwZ — Dirty Mo Media (@DirtyMoMedia) November 20, 2024 Expand Tweet  Was the Tyson vs. Paul fight a true boxing match or just a circus act for entertainment? Debate Without a full-time commitment to the IndyCar Series, Daly did feature in the Xfinity and Truck Series races. He finished P14 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway driving the #26 Sam Hunts Racing car. Whereas out of the three Truck races, the 17th place finish was his best driving the Niece Motorsports truck. However, not everyone from the NASCAR community was thrilled to see Mike Tyson go down without a fight. For many like Dale Jr. who watched Tyson at his peak, they were expecting at least a knockout blow from him. Although he wasn’t in the best shape possible because of his age, he still could’ve ended the fight with a lethal blow, which never came. Dale Jr. wasn’t even interested in knowing who was against Tyson; all he wanted was to see the opponent go down. But much to his disappointment, Tyson lost the fight, and he never got to see a real boxing match. Disappointed by the whole event, Jr. hurled out a rant while speaking on DJD. “You did not give a sh-t who the other guy was. When they got to fighting, I was like, ‘Who the hell was I to imagine that Mike Tyson could actually knock this guy out. I live in a fantasy world where I thought, damn, Mike Tyson, I hope he can knock this Well, it could have been my best friend in there with Mike Tyson. Whoever Mike Tyson gets in the ring with, I want a knockout.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Jr. even suggested that the whole fight was rigged, and he labeled the whole boxing buzz as a circus. “I don’t believe anything anymore. It’s really kind of turned into a circus. There’s not a true battle anymore. When you are watching all these matches, you feel like the ending’s already predetermined. It feels a lot like a match race that my dad might have ran with Kenny Schrader, where they’re like, let’s just make it look good.” Boxing may have changed over the years, but seeing Mike Tyson fight was awesome – no ifs, ands, or butts about it. 🥊😂 pic.twitter.com/hsI3mYmTZR — Dirty Mo Media (@DirtyMoMedia) November 18, 2024 Expand Tweet  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Well, given all the punches and fists that have been thrown across NASCAR events, perhaps it’s time fans should get the taste of real action.

There weren’t many expectations from the scrawny 20-year-old Davidson College graduate when he walked into the NBA scene in 2009. Little did the world know then, that he was a magician waiting to show his tricks. It didn’t take Stephen Curry too long to tell the world (precisely the critics) that he’s here to stay—he’s the next big thing in the league. Sixteen years later, the “skinny boy with weak ankles” sits among the Pantheon of the Elites as the rightful greatest sharpshooter the league has ever seen. Well, things haven’t been easy for the Chef in the league. Stephen Curry‘s injury woes early on in his career and a trophyless streak kept him on the detractors’ radar. But things began to change post-2014 when the first ring graced his hands. However, Steph has learned valuable lessons from the NBA and he shared his learning on the Dub Talk podcast just not too long ago. “I think in the NBA, obviously, you have a goal. Everybody wants to win a championship, and everything that you do is built towards that. 82 games, a two-month playoff run. It’s hard to almost drive yourself crazy,” the 36-year-old Warriors superhero stated. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad So, a way of coping with the stress of the competition and its drama is breathing and mindfulness. Stephen Curry shared: “Breathing and all that type of mindfulness work helps to kind of calm your nerves. I’ve done a lot more of that later in my career. And a lot of that just comes with knowing how your body responds in the heat of battle and the emotions of it all.” Steph further emphasized the importance of focusing on the present and trusting the process, rather than constantly fixating on the ultimate goal. He suggests that obsessing over the “end goal” can be overwhelming or counterproductive. Instead, Curry believes in embracing the daily work and preparation required, even if the outcome is uncertain. Is Curry's pursuit of a fifth ring proof he's the greatest sharpshooter in NBA history? Debate The point guard pointed out how different the league is now than before. Of course, with time, things have evolved and the competition is more hungry than ever. Everyone wants to become the champion, everyone wants to be the best in the league. Moreover, the excitement of the youth days does alter into performance stress with age. But, both are unique and fun experiences for Steph. Steph years for a fifth ring. “Honestly, it’s the only thing I’m really playing for at this point,” he confessed. “It’s the only thing that matters in the sense of accomplishment.” At 36, basketball remains Stephen Curry’s greatest passion, alongside his wife and four wonderful children. His enduring love for the game fuels his desire to keep contributing to the sport he’s cherished all his life. With the drive to achieve even more, Curry is determined to chase the long-awaited fifth championship ring. Curry is doing what he does best—dominating. Through 10 games, he’s a sharpshooter on a mission. Averaging 23 points. Draining 47.9% of his shots. Splashing 42.7% from deep. Oh, and the free throws? He’s a near-perfect 94.3%. The Warriors may struggle at the line, but Curry’s in a league of his own. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The NBA Clutch Player of the Year continues to prove why he’s equal to the King, LeBron James himself. Stephen Curry is always the one bringing his team out of critical situations. And such heroics make us speculate just one thing: A fifth banner for the Warriors is on the way with Steph on the top of his game. Stephen Curry isn’t done yet. Four rings? Not enough. Another one? Oh, it’s coming. A fifth championship, maybe another Finals MVP—he’s ready to show the world he’’ still the man to lead the Dubs to glory. Buckle up. The Chef is cooking.

How has everything been for Jordan Chiles after the Paris Olympics? Well, the gymnast has been on a roller coaster of emotions, as her journey has been filled with ups and downs. The Olympic Games saw her grab a bronze medal, which was ultimately taken away by a late penalty, and it caused a big controversy. While she is still up to get her hard-earned medal back, Chiles is also not backing down from showing off some fashion tricks she has up her sleeves. Recently, the gymnast was present on the GQ red carpet among many sports stars and celebrities. Even though Chiles is going through a lot in her life, she is also finding time to get dressed uniquely for such kind of major events that have caught the attention of many fans who follow her social media handles. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad MGK, Dwayne Johnson, John Mulaney, and any other celebrity that you can mention were a part of the GQ red carpet. It was a fiesta for these big names, and they got to have a big night filled with glitz and glamor. Among these celebrities was Jordan Chiles, who also graced the event with her presence. So, what was something unique that stood out about her? At the GQ Men of the Year award, held in Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, Chiles dressed up as a literal ‘angel’ in the city of angels. The gymnast’s attire was very eye-catching. Keeping her hairstyle on point, Chiles donned a silver attire. Her coat and her pants went really well with the GQ logo, which is seen in the background of her Instagram pictures. Furthermore, the gymnast took an opportunity to wear her black-colored heels, giving her a dashing look. “That girl with a little spice,” wrote Chiles on her social media post, emphasizing her sizzling outfit on the red carpet.       A post shared by Jordan Chiles (@jordanchiles) Does Jordan Chiles deserve her bronze medal back, or was the CAS decision justified? Debate  She also left credit for her stylists Micah and Wayman while also mentioning Ferrari Style for her outfit, Christian Louboutin for the heels, and A.JAFEE for her jewelry. It was a whole new look of Chiles, and it did match the vibes of the celebrity night in Los Angeles. Furthermore, there were many known sports stars, especially of Team USA, like Noah Lyles, Hunter Woodhall, Tara Davis-Woodhall, and more. Being present on the red carpet is a statement in itself. It did show that even if she is going through a lot of problems in her life, she isn’t shying away from taking a dip into the fashion scene. Recently, Chiles also attended her very first TV interview with TODAY, where she talked about her mental state after getting her bronze Olympic medal taken away due to a decision made by CAS.

For Jordan Chiles, such an incident unfolded in the floor exercise finals, and until now, she has been fighting the CAS to get back her hard-earned accolade. The gymnast sat down with Hoda Kotb and gave an honest view of her emotions, stating, “Honestly, it’s been really, really hard to comprehend everything that’s been happening.”  While asserting these statements, she was also trying to hold her tears back as this incident has taken a big toll on her mental health. Kotb also stressed the fact that the CAS took her bronze medal because her coach, Cecile Landi, was just four seconds late to the 60-second deadline to appeal about Chiles’ score. The journalist also wanted to convey that for her it “seems like a judge’s issue,” rather than putting the blame and pressure on the athletes involved in this whole fiasco.

Everything was very right, everything was in the time that needed to be, and for them to comeback and say that this was four seconds late when we’ve had proof, we’ve had everything that really can show that everything was right.” Chiles is determined about herself and her coach that they didn’t make any error that could’ve resulted in such controversy. She also credited her fans, who have been backing her up since this incident, and gave out her piece of gratitude for the support. Let the world know your perspective.

He protects the quarterback and changes the direction of the game, making him a priceless player on the Browns’ roster. Drafted in the second round of the 2017 NFL Draft by the Seattle Seahawks, Pocic spent his early years adapting to the league’s challenges.

How ‘bout them Cowboys? America’s team have hit a wall. They perhaps now suit the moniker of America’s fiasco. With turmoil from the top down, there are wholesale changes lined up in Dallas. Jerry Jones knew he would likely be on the lookout for a new coach at the end of the season when he kept Mike McCarthy on the leash of a one-year deal. However, the process has been expedited. This is owing to some poor roster planning, a non-existent running game and a touch of misfortune with injuries. Jerry’s options have largely boiled down to two completely contrasting figures. Deion Sanders has been a revelation up in Boulder, Colorado. Typically, a program that ended its season 1-11 will be lost in the abyss without much hype or fanfare. However, Coach Prime resonates with anything but typical. Within 2 seasons, he has turned the Buffaloes into playoff contenders. From somebody with no NFL coaching experience to someone with an exorbitant amount. Bill Belichick is the other coach in contention for the job. As if these two were even comparable entities, one expert suggested Belichick is the ideal candidate. During ESPN’s First Take, the panel discussed which coach would be a more suitable successor to McCarthy. Chris “Mad Dog” Russo said, “I think Belichick is the perfect guy”. Now, Mad Dog’s word is far from gospel. However, he raised some very astute points. “Bill likes Jerry Jones, which is interesting. That’s number one. Number two, [Mike] Zimmer’s there…I’m sure Belichick likes Zimmer because of the coaching staff situation. Three, he’s only 15 wins away from [overtaking Don] Shula. Jerry’s 82, he’s not going to be here forever”. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The morbid final pointer still holds true and is perhaps most important in what appeals to Belichick. His tenure in New England really fizzled towards the end once Tom Brady departed. With GMs now moving towards younger coaches, there might be no more offers on the table. In the former category, Deion Sanders’ fits the “bill”. In fact, the aforementioned Mike Zimmer, now Cowboys’ DC, was on Coach Prime’s staff last season. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Apart from his coaching credentials, Prime brings a persona that goes right into the Cowboys’ wheelhouse. A Super Bowl winner in Dallas, he also demands the respect of players because of who he was as one. Whether Jerry decides to hire Deion, it is still not a given that he will be successful at luring him. There are many facets at play. Is Deion Sanders the spark the Cowboys need, or is Bill Belichick the safer bet? Debate Of all the decisions Jerry Jones made in the preseason, the most abiding one was the very last one. Dak Prescott’s unprecedented contract may be a hurdle in Deion Sanders’s pathway. Shedeur Sanders is in line to be the top quarterback off the board for 2025. If Prime indeed makes the leap into the pros alongside, why wouldn’t he want to join the team that drafts his son? Deion has coached Shedeur along every level of football. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Cowboys legend Micheal Irvin was asked if he thinks Deion would follow suit if Jerry Jones drafted Shedeur. “I believe 100% and I can tell you, good sources have told me that…great sources have told me that. That’s all I can say like that without violating anything else.”  With how the Cowboys’ season is panning out, a high lottery pick may well ensue. So, does Jerry bite the proverbial bullet on Dak’s contract, which is the biggest in NFL history? It will be fascinating to see how this unfolds. Bill Belichick remains an adept alternative.

Nebraska football has been in their lowest record in history, sitting at 5-5 after surviving four consecutive losses. Matt Rhule had to answer the frenzied fans who got sick of a sloppy offense almost every week. Rhule probably has to let go of the Huskers’ slim bowl eligibility again for the first time in history but he took some wise steps to make the future look better, at least. After Nebraska, for the third time in a row, dropped the ball against UCLA, Rhule made a bold decision on offensive coordinator Marcus Satterfield. While he continues to serve the team as the tight end Coach, Rhule handed the play-calling duties to former Houston and West Virginia head coach Dana Holgorsen. As a few weeks under the new OC passed, the question regarding the new coach’s apathetic attitude and controversial past started to air concern. Did Rhule just make another bad call? Just when you start to think that the struggling Huskers will do better with better guidance on the board, the reality hits you hard. Dana, the new OC that has had all the eyes on him since he joined the force, spilled a rude reason for accepting the Huskers’ offer. ”I didn’t come here with the intention of being the OC and the play caller, we didn’t know what it was going to look like he was (Rhule) just like hurry up and get here, so I got here.’‘ The new face of the Nebraska offense said during his first newsroom conference. “He is not the same as Matt Rhule at all.”@mitchsherman thinks that adding Dana Holgorsen to the Nebraska football program brings a new mindset to the coaching staff. Presented by @hurrdatsportbar pic.twitter.com/ZMr6WLPr3v — Hurrdat Sports (@HurrdatSports) November 20, 2024 Expand Tweet ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad  If you already feel like ranting and racing, we suggest you wait for more. What do you think a newly appointed mentor could tell more obnoxious? Well, it was simply an ‘‘I was bored” confession from the prime veteran. Sensing the clear disrespect in his tone, Nebraska insider Connor Happer broke the silence, digging up his underwhelming past. ”He is pretty blunt. I think he said at one point in time I didn’t really like what I was doing with TCU which was not being a part of the game, he would go and be a part of the prep and come in for a couple of weeks at a time. He didn’t have his hand dirty.” Happer spilled the bean. Mitch Sherman chimed in, noting, ”he went on a vacation for a few weeks, so tells you what his role was with Sunny Dykes in the program.” But that annoying casual approach isn’t the only fault under the new OC‘s belt. He has a serious savage mouth that can come in a clear loggerhead with diplomatic Matt Rhule. Is Dana Holgorsen's blunt style what Nebraska needs, or is it a recipe for disaster? Debate In Saturday’s game against USC, the Nebraska offense breathed a little, but not enough to let them survive the Trojans’ 28-20 storm. Now, the last thing Rhule and his team can do to improve their image is to aim for at least two consecutive wins against Wisconsin and Iowa to hit the six-win barrier. Before the Huskers suited up to tackle the Badgers in an unforgivable game, the team received some strong flakes from the new offensive coordinator. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad As Awful Announcing’s Reice Shiply broke it out, Holgorsen dubbed the players ‘fairly big kids’ and asked, ”Why are you not blocking worth a crap on the perimeter? It’s embarrassing.” ‘‘If you don’t start blocking out there, then you aren’t going to get the ball thrown to you.” Holgerson finally made some sense while throwing some reality checks to the receivers. But the biggest concern around his uncontrolled tongue is he doesn’t know the difference between talking from a street corner and the interview room with 18 cameras pointed at him, which is the utter opposite of head coach Matt Rhule, who has calculated each word before passing it on the mic.

   The 2024 NFL season has been rough, to say the least, for the defending NFC champion San Francisco 49ers, as the storied franchise has dealt with numerous injuries to key players all year long. After winning consecutive games against the Dallas Cowboys and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the 49ers seemed to be returning to form heading into their Week 11 game against the Seattle Seahawks, setting up a divisional showdown that would have implications for the NFC West title. Unfortunately for San Francisco, quarterback Brock Purdy emerged from the game with a shoulder injury that is now limiting him in practice. Head coach Kyle Shanahan recently revealed his level of concern regarding the signal-caller. “Says his level of concern of Purdy’s shoulder is ‘not much right now’ and they’ll see how the [week] goes,” Shanahan said, via Clayton Holloway of NFL Network. Kyle Shanahan says QB Brock Purdy (shoulder) will be limited in practice today.  Says his level of concern of Purdy's shoulder is ""not much right now"" and they'll see how the weeks goes. — Clayton Holloway (@HollowayNFLN) November 20, 2024  After losing to the Seahawks and now sitting at 5-5 coming into Week 12, the 49ers face another thought NFC opponent, going on the road to play Jordan Love and the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field. In addition to Purdy’s injury, tight end George Kittle is still dealing with a hamstring issue, resulting in him being limited in practice as well. Even at full strength, San Francisco would face a formidable environment in Green Bay, which means it’ll be crucial to have Purdy and Kittle on the field to get the win."

   At one point in time, Justin Tucker of the Baltimore Ravens was considered one of the best kickers in the NFL, if not the best, as he was as dependable and clutch as any player in the league at his position. Unfortunately for the veteran, that distinction is no longer linked to him, as he’s had his fair share of struggles and has shown that he’s human and can make mistakes like any other kicker on the professional level. In Week 11, the Ravens played one of their most important games of the season, taking on the division-rival Pittsburgh Steelers in a contest crucial to the race for the division title in the AFC North. Ultimately, Baltimore fell short on the road at Acrisure Stadium, with Tucker going 1-for-3 with his field-goal attempts, which isn’t ideal for a kicker of his caliber, especially in a game the Ravens needed to win. Tucker recently opened up about his recent struggles and how seriously he takes missing field goals in crucial moments. “Believe me when I say nobody takes it more personally than I do. Nobody is more affected than me when I miss a kick,” Tucker said, via Jamison Hensley of ESPN. “… At the exact same time, my particular line of work requires, in my opinion, that I compartmentalize my feelings.” Justin Tucker: “Believe me, when I say nobody takes it more personally than I do, nobody is more affected than me when I miss the kick.

   Over the past few years, the NFL has tried to appeal to a younger audience, as they’ve had a partnership with Nickelodeon and have gotten creative in terms of implementing elements of the network into games. It appears that the NBA will try to follow in the footsteps of the most popular professional sports league in the United States by using its partnership with ESPN, which the Walt Disney Co. owns. The NBA reportedly will experiment with a “Kids-Cast” strategy during the holidays with a “Deck the Halls” version of the Christmas Day game between Jalen Brunson’s New York Knicks and Victor Wembanyama’s San Antonio Spurs. Disney characters like Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse will be used, according to Michael McCarthy of Front Office Sports. Walt Disney Co. is taking its ""Kids-Cast"" strategy to NBA. ESPN + NBA will present a ""Deck the Halls"" version of Knicks vs. Spurs on Christmas Day. It will mark the league's first real-time animated game. Set in Magic Kingdom, viewers will see Mickey Mouse + other characters. pic.twitter.com/KE5eSKkbYZ — Michael McCarthy (@MMcCarthyREV) November 20, 2024  These kinds of experiments can go one of two ways these days, as it can turn out to be an absolute disaster and a glaring distraction during the game, which will make the rounds on social media as a joke, or it will be a resounding success that opens the doors for a younger demographic that the league is targeting. It’ll be interesting to see how this pans out and, if it is successful, how many more of these kinds of games will be showcased for the rest of the 2024-25 NBA season. As for the game itself, the Knicks and Spurs will likely be one of the more watched contests on Christmas Day, with one of the most popular teams taking on a player who many believe could become the best in the league in the near future."

   At one point during the 2024 NFL season, the Chicago Bears were living up to the hype, with rookie quarterback Caleb Williams playing at a high level and looking like the real deal for the storied franchise. Unfortunately, after a Hail Mary loss to Jayden Daniels and the Washington Commanders a few weeks ago, the Bears have headed into a downward spiral, losing four straight games. The Bears are not headed in the right direction right now, and it appears that head coach Matt Eberflus is on the hot seat in the Windy City, as he will almost certainly be the fall guy for the Bears’ struggles this season if things continue to trend in this direction. Mike Greenberg of ESPN said he believes Eberflus is coaching with fear driving him, which won’t bode well for him or the team’s success in the remainder of the 2024 campaign and in the future. “Scared to death of fumbling the ball or making any mistakes that might cost him a game rather than putting the ball in his rookie’s hands, who he’s trying to develop, where if Caleb Williams made the kind of mistake on that last play that cost you a game, in the long run, it’s a good thing,” Greenberg said, via ESPN Radio. .@Espngreeny says Matt Eberflus isn’t coaching to win, he’s coaching not to lose (his job): “Scared to death.” 🐻⬇️ pic.twitter.com/wGJJ1dpVTt — ESPN Radio (@ESPNRadio) November 20, 2024  With the Bears facing a brutal schedule to finish the season, facing the Minnesota Vikings (twice), Detroit Lions (twice), San Francisco 49ers, Seattle Seahawks and Green Bay Packers, Chicago will likely wind up with an ugly record and beaten up by some of the best teams in the NFC. The outlook doesn’t look good, which means Eberflus could be unemployed sooner rather than later in Chicago."

NFL legend and current analyst Richard Sherman recently had a message for his former team. “You gotta play like the rent’s due,” Sherman said, via the Richard Sherman Podcast. “And if you not playing like the rent’s due, you getting evicted and we going home.” ""Play like the rent's due!""@RSherman_25 on what the 49ers need to do to turn their season around pic.twitter.com/zeprInxDfN — Richard Sherman Podcast (@RShermanPodcast) November 20, 2024  The Niners have been one of the best teams in the league for the past half-decade. They have made two of the past five Super Bowls and have been a force to be reckoned with under head coach Kyle Shanahan. However, this season, they have dealt with many injuries, including to All-Pro running back Christian McCaffrey and 1,000-yard receiver Brandon Aiyuk, which was season-ending. Down the stretch, San Francisco is going to face playoff contenders starting with the Green Bay Packers in Week 12 and including matchups with the Buffalo Bills and Detroit Lions, as well as Arizona. The 49ers are going to have to handle their business in those games if they hope to make the playoffs. The defense needs to play like their backs are against the wall, as does the offense. If the Niners fail to have the attitude and ferocity they have shown in previous years, they could be sitting on the couch in January."

   The Aaron Rodgers experiment for the New York Jets has not gone as planned, with the franchise having the same results, if not worse, than when Zach Wilson was leading the charge at quarterback last year. With seven losses in the past eight games, the Jets are limping their way to the end of the season, as hopes of making the NFL playoffs are slim to none, with no telling what could happen in the offseason. Although there was hope that Rodgers could return to form as one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL coming into this 2024 campaign, the four-time MVP seems closer to retirement than reclaiming the dominant form he once had with the Green Bay Packers. Things have gotten so bad at this point in New York that it isn’t out of the realm of possibility that the Jets could release Rodgers in the offseason, and if that happens, one FOX Sports host doesn’t see an NFL landing spot for the future Hall of Famer. “If he were to get cut, I can’t find a team for him. Not one,” Nick Wright said on “First Things First.” “… I think he’s a man without a country at this point.” ""If he were to get cut, I can't find a team for him… I think he's a man without a country at this point."" — @getnickwright on what's next for Aaron Rodgers pic.twitter.com/3S32OcBzqD — First Things First (@FTFonFS1) November 20, 2024  Even though Wright doesn’t foresee another team taking a chance on an over-the-hill Rodgers, there’s always a desperate club out there that could bring him in, even if it is to fill the stands and not necessarily win games. Only time will tell what will happen with Rodgers, but things aren’t trending in the right direction for him in New York."

   With Deion Sanders making the transition from playing to coaching and turning a lot of heads in the process, the two-time Super Bowl champion has become a hot commodity after proving he could turn things around for the University of Colorado this season. Along with making the Buffaloes relevant again in college football, Shedeur Sanders, the son of the NFL great, has become a household name and will likely be one of the first quarterbacks taken in the 2025 NFL Draft. Some have speculated that if the right situation presented itself in the NFL, where Deion Sanders could coach his son on the professional level, he might take the opportunity. Many people in the media have been floating the possibility of the Sanders duo ending up with the Dallas Cowboys if owner Jerry Jones parts ways with head coach Mike McCarthy. However, a more likely situation for the two might be with the struggling Las Vegas Raiders. “To me, the place that looks like they could get both is the Raiders,” FOX Sports host Chris Broussard said on “First Things First.” “… The Raiders could get the first pick (in the draft).” ""To me, the place that looks like it could get both is the Raiders.""@Chris_Broussard on potential Deion/Shedeur pairing in the NFL: pic.twitter.com/uTdLT8ywRG — First Things First (@FTFonFS1) November 20, 2024  Although current Raiders head coach Antonio Pierce got a lot of support to get the job in Las Vegas, he seems to have lost the locker room and could be done after one full season. If that happens, the Raiders could try to go after Deion Sanders, especially if they can draft Sheduer Sanders as their new franchise quarterback."

   The Washington Commanders have been one of the surprise teams in the NFL this season, as they have struck gold with the addition of rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels, who has quickly turned into the face of the storied franchise. Although Daniels has led the Commanders to seven wins thus far, they are coming off consecutive losses for the first time this season, to the Pittsburgh Steelers and Philadelphia Eagles. With some fans getting concerned that the team might be slipping a little bit in the second half of the 2024 campaign, some have pointed out that Daniels has been wearing a wrap around his ribs, which he injured earlier in the year. Daniels was asked why he wears the wrap and explained that it is a tactic to stay warm as temperatures continue to drop from week to week heading into the colder months of the year. “It’s to stay warm,” Daniels said, via Scott Abraham of 7News DC. “I mean, it’s getting later in the year, as it gets colder, you don’t want your body parts to get cold, so it’s just to stay warm.” Commanders rookie QB Jayden Daniels is not injured, that's according to head coach Dan Quinn and Jayden. So I asked Jayden today why he puts on a wrap around his ribs in between drives during the game? Jayden said, ""it's to stay warm."" pic.twitter.com/sV4ioqY1M9 — Scott Abraham (@Scott7news) November 20, 2024  In Week 12, the Commanders will attempt to snap their two-game losing streak as they’ll face the division-rival Dallas Cowboys, who are having one of their worst seasons in recent memory. The matchup is the perfect opportunity for Daniels and company to bounce back with a vengeance and resemble the NFC heavyweights everyone has become accustomed to seeing this season."

   With the New York Giants heading toward a disappointing end to the 2024 NFL season, the storied franchise has decided to make a move that fans have been calling for over the past couple of years. Despite some reluctance earlier in the season, head coach Brian Daboll has decided it is finally time to send veteran quarterback Daniel Jones to the bench in favor of backup and newly named starter Tommy DeVito. Not only have the Giants demoted Jones to the bench and announced that DeVito would be starting moving forward, but the veteran has plummeted down the quarterback depth chart. “Daniel Jones was the Giants QB4 behind Drew Lock and Tim Boyle in practice today,” Bleacher Report wrote on X. Daniel Jones was the Giants QB4 behind Drew Lock and Tim Boyle in practice today 😳 Tommy DeVito will be the starter pic.twitter.com/IHwf5WzB8X — Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) November 20, 2024  This could be seen as a head-scratching move by Daboll and his coaching staff. It was bad enough that they made their longtime starter the third quarterback on the depth chart, behind DeVito and Lock, but demoting him down another level seems a bit uncalled for and, frankly, embarrassing. It’ll be interesting to see how DeVito performs as the Giants quarterback moving forward and whether he can give the team a boost, but the real question is what will happen to Jones after this season, especially after this embarrassing development, which has to hurt his chances of landing with another team next season and beyond."

   The Dallas Cowboys are limping to the finish line of the 2024 NFL season, sporting a record of 3-7 after losing five straight games and finding out that star quarterback Dak Prescott is officially done for the rest of the campaign. With the Cowboys a non-factor in the NFC moving forward, the attention turns to the front office and longtime owner Jerry Jones and the decisions that need to be made as a result of this disappointing season. The one decision everyone will be waiting for is whether the Cowboys will finally part ways with head coach Mike McCarthy, especially with all the big-name candidates who could be available during the offseason. Along with Mike Vrabel and Bill Belichick, one notable coaching candidate who could be attainable is former Cowboys star Deion Sanders, who has elevated the University of Colorado out of mediocrity with the help of his son and quarterback, Shedeur Sanders. With Deion Sanders having a history with the Cowboys and becoming a hot commodity because of his coaching chops, Dallas could take a shot at bringing him in during the offseason, which Rob Gronkowski believes would be the right move for the storied franchise. “I think the only coach out there that can handle that is Deion Sanders,” Gronkowski said on “Up & Adams.” “100 percent, so I would love to see that fit. Everyone would love to see that happen besides non-Cowboys fans.” .@RobGronkowski says there's no BETTER FIT to be the Dallas Cowboys next HC than COACH PRIME himself 😎🤠🗣️@DeionSanders @heykayadams @dallascowboys pic.twitter.com/yznkWvTPBg — Up & Adams (@UpAndAdamsShow) November 20, 2024  At this point, with there still being quite a few games left to be played in the regular season, it remains to be seen what Jones will end up doing if he parts with McCarthy.

Denmark manager leaves post-match media duties after just 16 seconds following goalless draw with Serbia in Nations League Denmark manager Brian Riemer conducted what has been dubbed the shortest press conference ever after his side’s goalless draw with Serbia in the Nations League. Denmark rounded off their 2024 fixtures on Monday night with the draw, with the likes of Kasper Schmeichel, Christian Eriksen and Rasmus Hojlund all involved in the game. Playing for Serbia were stars including Aleksandar Mitrovic and Dusan Vlahovic, but none of the attacking talent on either side could find a goal that would see the game finish with a winner.   The result meant Denmark finished second in the Nations League Group A League 1 table, eight points behind winners Spain and failing to win any of their last four matches. There are now no more international breaks until March, meaning manager Riemer is potentially set for a holiday before work begins on the mission to help Denmark qualify for the 2026 World Cup. And he was wasting no time with his post-match duties after the Serbia game, with no questions from the media in attendance heading his way, so he made a quick dash out of his seat.

We just go ahead with your questions, so please wait for the microphone and state the media that you represent and ask your questions for Brian.’ The 46-year-old appeared set and ready to answer anything fired his way as he scanned the room, and waited for a few seconds as murmurs could be heard in the crowd. ‘No questions?’ the press officer asked, before adding: ‘Alright, thank you for tonight.’ Riemer, all smiles, got up off his chair and left the room, just 16 seconds after he had sat down and the conference had begun.

There, he would serve as assistant coach to Thomas Frank in the Championship, helping oversee promotion to the Premier League in the 2020-21 season and then being a part of the coaching set-up that led them to 13th in the Premier League.

No wonder Soriano appeared assertive.    The 90-minute film produced in-house, coupled with the Catalan’s signature until at least 2026, served as a reminder of what City have at their disposal.  Despite four straight defeats in all competitions — something new for Guardiola, finally a record he’d rather not have — this reminder of his man-management skills ought to focus some minds in the dressing room. He swears a lot, Guardiola. Just like every manager.  He swears at Phil Foden for gifting Crystal Palace a draw last December — ‘in the f****** 18-yard box you don’t touch the opponent… it’s unacceptable, Phil’ — and he swears to emphasise how good he believes this team is.       Pep Guardiola agreed to sign a new contract with Manchester City on Tuesday evening      News of Guardiola’s deal came in the same week that City’s latest documentary, charting their run to a fourth consecutive Premier League title – and which highlighted his genius – dropped      Guardiola’s man-management skills and fiery nature were on display throughout the film ‘The legacy is the way you f****** play,’ he barks after the barnstorming last-minute 3-2 victory at Newcastle United in January. He paces around those rooms, stalking to build tension. The eyes of players and staff follow him in a silent trance.  Watching him is mesmeric and how Guardiola continues to find new ways of relaying the same messages is a significant part of City’s domestic dominance. A domestic dominance that is under threat from Arne Slot’s resurgent Liverpool at the moment.  Guardiola tells players that ‘the storm always passes’ in one team talk. City’s hope will be that the clouds have parted over the international break, with more members of the squad available after injury and an upturn in overall performance.  Guardiola has form when it comes to getting a reaction. That dressing-down of Foden, days before the Club World Cup, sparked him into life — the midfielder ending the campaign as PFA Players’ Player of the Year — and also sent a warning to everybody else.  ‘You are not boys, you are not teenagers,’ Guardiola says. ‘Did I say something when we drop points against Tottenham and Liverpool? Did I say something? Tell me. I blame you? I say something? F****** hell, f****** hell.’  Well, he did after Spurs. Crazed after conceding another late equaliser, Guardiola stormed into a room of squabbling players. They shut up. He began. ‘That is the level, my friends,’ he says while hammering his chest. ‘That is why no one did four Premier Leagues in a row. That is the reason why. Take responsibility, my friends.’  Guardiola has since admitted that he lost control in those moments and he isn’t always proud of the way he addresses the room. But even so, there is something innate that speaks to this group and those who went before them.       Guardiola particularly let loose at Phil Foden after City dropped points against Crystal Palace      Watching the 53-year-old in the film is mesmeric and how Guardiola continues to find new ways of relaying the same messages is a significant part of City’s domestic dominance   He sometimes doesn’t say anything — a motivational video montage of the team’s entire season that he shows his players before they beat West Ham on the final day is a perfect example. So when he does speak, it sticks.   It cannot be chance that a rousing half-time speech at Tottenham, in a must-win clash days before the season finale against West Ham, is followed by City going 1-0 up six minutes after the break.  He’d made out they were feeble in the first half. Points needed proving. ‘This is my feeling right now: I say, “Let’s go” and it is, “Ah yeah, let’s go”. It doesn’t work if you don’t believe it inside.’ Guardiola starts slamming the desk.  ‘Now is the moment you have to prove how incredible you are as a team. You cannot go home regretting that I was not me.’  They didn’t — and they need some of that now because Tottenham and Liverpool lie in wait over the next fortnight.  Your email address will not be published.

The result had followed Draper winning his first ATP Tour title at the Stuttgart Open, which elevated him to British No 1. Draper bounced back from a second-round exit at Wimbledon to enjoy his best Grand Slam performance to date at the US Open. The 22-year-old reached his maiden Grand Slam semi-final, becoming the first British man since Andy Murray in 2012 to reach that stage. Draper ultimately suffered a 7-5, 7-6, 6-2 defeat by eventual champion Sinner in New York, as he battled sickness partly brought on by anxiety. He broke into the world’s top 15 for the first time last month after winning the Vienna Open for his first ATP 500 level title.          Your email address will not be published.

It was in the reverse fixture of Wednesday’s game where the Glasgow side put Bompastor’s team behind for the first time this season, before goals from Maika Hamano and Ashley Lawrence ensured the damage was undone before the final whistle. This game was far from that – albeit fleeting – struggle. Chelsea dominated possession and clocked up a total of 25 shots to Celtic’s three. After Bronze’s second minute goal found the back of Kelsey Daugherty’s net, the signs of a Celtic capitulation started to show.      Lucy Bronze celebrates opening the scoring with a superb volley in the first minute      Wieke Kaptein doubled Chelsea’s advantage but visitors Celtic avoided a capitulation      Chelsea head coach Sonia Bompastor has overseen 11 consecutive wins since taking charge And while Chelsea did double their lead through Wieke Kaptein just over 20 minutes later, a capitulation wasn’t what followed. And this was much to the credit of a valiant Celtic defence who fought on until the last moment before an unfortunate hand ball by Shannon McGregor in the penalty area meant Eve Perisset was given a spot-kick, which she coolly converted. Just a quick word on that Lucy Bronze goal – it was truly something to behold. Chelsea won a corner in the opening seconds and it was taken short to Guro Reiten, whose swinging cross was cleanly met by the laces of the Lioness star just inside the box. While Celtic goalkeeper Daughtery was able to get a hand to it, the ball carried too much punch and Chelsea had their lead. Bompastor made six changes to the side which swept aside Manchester City at the weekend, with Catarina Macario coming in for Mayra Ramirez and Zecira Musovic starting between the sticks in place of Hannah Hampton. The Blues have been in imperious form since the end of the Hayes’ tenure – they have not lost since May 1, with their 14-game winning streak in all competitions unmatched since Arsenal in 2018. And with the games coming thick and fast at this stage of the season, Bompastor will appreciate her seemingly endless squad of superstars. Your email address will not be published.

If it made sense, he would run for President or at least consider being a running mate in the way that RFK Jr. wanted him to be this year. Once he is retired, he would have no problem attempting to try his hand for political office.  ‘It is a very big realm of possibility for something that Aaron would like to try his hand at. It just makes sense to him and is something that interests him. 2028 is far away, but Aaron will be retired by then, and to start a career in politics is right up his alley and something he will take seriously.’  DailyMail.com has contacted Rodgers’ representatives for comment.   Rodgers and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have developed a relationship in recent years, with both men notably skeptic of vaccines. And Kennedy Jr., who was named president-elect Donald Trump’s nomination for for Secretary of Health & Human Services, had reportedly floated Rodgers on his shortlist for a running-mate. The former presidential candidate eventually chose tech entrepreneur Nicole Shanahan as his vice president pick before he ultimately pulled out of the election race as an independent candidate. But back in May, Rodgers suggested it had been his decision to turn Kennedy down as he wasn’t yet willing to retire.       Rodgers and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. – a fellow vaccine skeptic – are fairly close friends When the time does eventually come for Rodgers to call it quits, a run for office could be on the cards – and it could come sooner rather than later .  The Jets had entered the Rodgers era in high hopes after Douglas manufactured a blockbuster deal to bring the four-time MVP to the Big Apple in 2023 in exchange for multiple picks with the Green Bay Packers . But with general manager Joe Douglas, the architect of the trade, sent packing Tuesday – just one month after head coach Robert Saleh faced the axe – the quarterback’s tenure in the Big Apple may have met its end.  The insider added that the veteran will not be suiting up at MetLife Stadium next season but it remains to be seen if Rodgers will have ay suitors elsewhere in the league.   ‘Now that the Jets have fired General Manager Joe Douglas, Aaron will not be a Jets player next year,’ they added.  ‘Aaron still wants to play in the NFL, and he will look to sign with another team next year. He’s ready to move on from the New York Jets because it just hasn’t worked out.’ The source continued: ‘There isn’t a team yet that would want to take on Aaron Rodgers, but it is still a very long time before next season, so it is likely that someone will pick him up, but there is no front runners at all.’ Rodgers returned with the Jets this year after being ruled out for the entirety of his debut season with the team after suffering an Achilles tear in their 2023 opening game against Buffalo.      Joe Douglas was fired in the same season the Jets let go of head coach Robert Saleh (left)      Jets owner Woods Johnson reportedly suggested benching the quarterback this season  However, the Jets’ offense has struggled with owner Woody Johnson reportedly suggesting that Rodgers be benched following a Week 4 defeat to the Denver Broncos.  But, despite a miserable season so far this year, Rodgers still shut down talk of retirement earlier this month.  ‘I think so, yeah,’ Rodgers said when asked about his plans to return. Doubling down on his previous hopes from last offseason to play ‘two or three or four more years.’ The Jets were supposed to be legitimate playoff contenders this season – with a fully healthy Rodgers and a bevy of weapons at his disposal. Still, even after swinging the trade for Davante Adams , the Jets languish towards the bottom of the AFC with a record of 3-8. After firing Saleh earlier in the season, the next man to be shown the door was Douglas after it was announced he had been axed Tuesday.  Former Browns general manager Phil Savage is set to step in as interim- signaling a complete teardown and rebuild is likely on the cards for the Jets.

Sportsdark,Pep Guardiola's new contract will NOT have a break clause if Man City are relegated – as hearing into 115 alleged financial rule-break charges continues,https://sportsdark.com/football/pep-guardiolas-new-contract-will-not-have-a-break-clause-if-man-city-are-relegated-as-hearing-into-115-alleged-financial-rule-break-charges-continues/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 22:02:00 +0000",Pep Guardiola&#8217;s new Manchester City contract will not be affected by the outcome of the club&#8217;s hearing into 115 charges for allegedly breaching the Premier League&#8217;s financial rules.

City have been accused of financial impropriety spanning nine years from 2009 and the sternest punishment if found guilty is relegation. Points deductions and fines are also potential penalties.  An independent hearing into the case officially began in September, but the verdict is not expected to be made public until spring 2025 at the earliest.   City continue to deny the allegations and Guardiola has repeatedly declared his trust in the club’s hierarchy throughout the investigation into their finances.  Mail Sport reported on Tuesday how Guardiola is set to pen a one-year extension with the option of a further year. And, we can reveal that the new deal will not have a break clause in case City are found guilty of the alleged charges and relegated.       Pep Guardiola’s new Manchester City contract will not be affected by the outcome of the club’s hearing into 115 charges for allegedly breaching the Premier League’s financial rules      If found guilty of the charges, City could face relegation from the Premier League       Guardiola’s new deal will not have a break clause in case the worse outcome happens for City  It must be noted that Guardiola could still choose to resign from his role, but it is felt his relationship with chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak – who was key in him penning a fresh contract – means that a clause in writing in regards to the outcome of the charges is not necessary. Guardiola has previously repeatedly insisted he would stick with City even if they were found guilty. Speaking last year, he was questioned over whether he would consider his position should City be punished. ‘A good question,’ he replied. ‘I will answer when I have the sentence. ‘You are questioning like we have been punished. And in the moment we are innocent until guilt is proved.  ‘I know the people want it. I know, I feel it. I will wait. Wait and see it and after the sentence has been done we will come here and explain it. ‘But absolutely I will not consider my future [if] it depends on being here [Premier League] or being in League One. Absolutely.  ‘There is more chance to stay if we are in League One than if we were in the Champions League.’ Guardiola’s stance is a major boost for the club, with the lack of break clause giving a strong suggestion he will be City’s manager until at least the end of next season no matter the outcome of the case, something which also helps with future squad planning.       Guardiola’s relationship with chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak meant a clause was not needed      The stance of the Spaniard is a major boost to City in what is an unsettling time for the club   Meanwhile, Guardiola’s new contract means his glittering reign at City will stretch to a decade and ensures that the club won’t simultaneously lose both their all-conquering boss and sporting director, Txiki Begiristain. Mail Sport reported in the summer that Guardiola was expected to call time on his illustrious spell in charge at the end of this season, with a changing of the guard deemed highly likely by those close to him. It’s understood that senior figures had been tentatively discussing succession planning, while Guardiola received contact from the FA about the England job in July. Friends of Guardiola had been left with the impression that the possibility of replacing Gareth Southgate was something he was seriously considering. But the 53-year-old returned to pre-season training refreshed after completing history by managing the team to four consecutive league titles. And although he continued to weigh up his decision – with sources claiming they were unsure of the outcome as recently as this month – the talk around Guardiola’s future had dramatically altered during the early months of the campaign. The new deal indicates that he is invigorated to oversee significant change within the squad next summer.      Guardiola has repeatedly declared his trust in the club’s hierarchy during the investigation  There were also potential logistical complications surrounding a new manager next summer to factor in, given City’s involvement in the revamped Club World Cup, which is due to finish a matter of weeks before the 2025-26 season.  Ex-Newcastle United midfielder Hugo Viana is taking over from Begiristain as City head into a new era, with the pair in close contact during a transitional handover period. Guardiola will remain the constant through that though and news of an extension should also send a message to a side who have lost four on the bounce in all competitions and slipped five points behind Liverpool in the title race. City face Tottenham at the weekend before travelling to Anfield a week later – before meeting Aston Villa and rivals Manchester United next month – in a crunch run of fixtures.

And who will start 2025 on top? Mail Sport predicts EVERY top-four game until the New Year With international football now on hold for four months, all eyes turn back to domestic football as the much-loved Premier League Christmas calendar is on the horizon. As the temperature goes down, the regularity of fixtures goes up. The winter period has a knack for making or breaking campaigns for those battling at the top of the table or those scrambling for points at the bottom. Not many expected Arne Slot’s Liverpool to be sitting pretty at the top come this stage of the season. However, they are doing exactly that as they lead champions Manchester City by five points with 11 games in the bank.   The Reds have only dropped four points all season with Slot enduring a record-breaking start to his reign at Anfield, while City’s near-perfect start to the season hit a stumbling block early in November as they lost two Premier League matches on the spin. Meanwhile, four points behind Pep Guardiola’s side, and nine behind Liverpool, are London rivals Chelsea and Arsenal. The Gunners are under threat of being cut adrift from the title race before Christmas presents are even opened. However, with all that being said, there is still a way to go before positions in the table provide a real indication of how it will look come May. With that being said, Mail Sport takes a look at the top four’s fixtures over the next nine gameweek’s and how the title race may look after the turn of the year.      Arne Slot’s Liverpool sit top of the Premier League having won nine of their 11 matches so far      Man City are coming off the back of two league defeats in a row leaving them five points adrift      Chelsea and Arsenal are trying to stay in the hunt as they occupy third and fourth in the table Gameweek 12 (November 23-25) Chelsea will get the weekend kicked off with a comfortable win away at struggling Leicester City, with Cole Palmer returning to the scoresheet, to put themselves within a point of City before they play on Sunday.  After four Premier League games without a win, we expect fourth-placed Arsenal to match their fellow Londoners and pick up three points against Nottingham Forest, but it won’t be a walk in the park. The Gunners will be made to fight for the victory by Nuno Espirito Santo’s Forest, who sit just one position behind Arsenal on the same points. However, two late goals from Kai Havertz and captain Martin Odegaard will get them back on track. Meanwhile, Liverpool will be looking to mount more misery on Southampton at St Mary’s and go eight points clear at the summit before City take to the pitch after them. And that’s exactly what they will do with Mohamed Salah bagging another goal and assist on the south coast. The champions will then follow suit in what is the game of the weekend against Tottenham. Erling Haaland will find his consistency again with a goal in a slender victory over Spurs, which will pile more pressure on Ange Postecoglou.  Leicester City 1-3 Chelsea  Arsenal 2-0 Nottingham Forest Southampton 0-2 Liverpool Manchester City 2-1 Tottenham Hotspur      Arne Slot is looking to do the unthinkable by leading Liverpool to the title in just his first season   Gameweek 13 (November 29 – December 1) Arguably the most significant match in this season’s title race takes place as Manchester City travel to Anfield looking to pick up a rare win to close the gap on their rivals. However, despite taking the lead, City will be pegged back and have to settle for a point after a topsy-turvy four-goal thriller against Liverpool, meaning the Reds stay five points clear. A day prior, Arsenal take advantage of the draw between their competitors with a comfortable win away at London rivals West Ham, in turn ramping up the heat on Hammers boss Julen Lopetegui. Chealsea will not match the Gunners, though, with Aston Villa rocking up to Stamford Bridge and taking points off them for a third successive season. Nicolas Jackson will put the Blues in the box seat for three points before Jhon Duran comes off the bench to save the day for Unai Emery’s side. You heard it here first. West Ham United 0-3 Arsenal Chelsea 1-1 Aston Villa  Liverpool 2-2 Manchester City   Gameweek 14 (December 3-5) After dropping points for only the third time this season, Liverpool will return to winning ways in a tough fixture away at Newcastle. With the crowd against them early on, Alexander Isak will send St James’ Park into a frenzy inside the first 30 minutes. However, history will repeat itself as Luis Diaz nets a second-half brace to bring all three points back to Merseyside. Manchester City will follow suit and pick up a commanding victory over Nottingham Forest as Espirito Santo’s side begin to drop to mid-table after a brilliant start to the campaign. Meanwhile, Chelsea will make light work of Southampton on the south coast with the Blues putting in a five-star display. Cole Palmer and Noni Madueke will both turn on the style, picking up braces. Arsenal face the sternest test of the gameweek with Ruben Amorim’s rejuvenated Manchester United rocking up at the Emirates. They will show the Portuguese boss just how tough the Premier League can be with a dominant display under the lights. Newcastle United 1-2 Liverpool Manchester City 3-0 Nottingham Forest Southampton 0-5 Chelsea  Arsenal 3-1 Manchester United      Arsenal did the double over Man United last season and will try beat them again in Decmeber Gameweek 15 (December 7-9) Liverpool’s five-point lead at the top will finally be cut short and it will be Everton wielding the axe. The Reds’ bitter rivals will cause them problems yet again at Goodison Park, however, Arne Slot’s strong defence will prevail to earn the leaders a point in an action-packed stalemate. Manchester City will take advantage with a second win on the spin, putting their losing streak soundly in the past, with a narrow victory over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. Phil Foden will re-find his scoring form to net the only goal of the game. Arsenal won’t follow in the footsteps of the Champions with Fulham holding them to a draw at Craven Cottage as Bukayo Saka’s first-half opener is cancelled out by Raul Jimenez. The Gunners’ result in west London means that Chelsea leapfrog them in the table as Enzo Maresca’s side put Tottenham to the sword yet again with a dramatic win on enemy territory thanks to a last-gasp Nicolas Jackson winner to complete an incredible turnaround. Everton 0-0 Liverpool Crystal Palace 0-1 Manchester City Fulham 1-1 Arsenal Tottenham Hotspur 1-2 Chelsea        Liverpool’s trip across Stanley Park to Everton last season spelled the end of their title hopes  Gameweek 16 (December 14-16) Arsenal succeed in what Liverpool failed to do by beating Everton, and they will do so comfortably at the Emirates with Kai Havertz netting a brace. Meanwhile, the Reds face Fulham, who Arsenal dropped points to the week before. They won’t make the same mistake, though. After going a goal down, two strikes in quick succession from the boot of Cody Gakpo will send the Kop into hysteria and keep Arne Slot’s side at the top of the table. Manchester City remain on their coattails, and even a tense Manchester Derby at the Etihad Stadium won’t slow them down. Pep Guardiola’s side continue their winning streak after goals from Erling Haaland, Kevin De Bruyne, and Mateo Kovacic. Later that night, Chelsea suffer only their third Premier League defeat of the season as Brentford win at Stamford Bridge for the fourth year in a row. It brings a familiar feeling back to the fans in the stands. Arsenal 3-0 Everton Liverpool 2-1 Fulham  Manchester City 3-1 Manchester United  Chelsea 0-1 Brentford      Ruben Amorim will lead United into a Manchester Derby for the first time in the middle of December Gameweek 17 (December 21-22) In the last matchweek before Christmas both Liverpool and Manchester City will gift their opponents victories.  For the second year running, Aston Villa stun Pep Guardiola’s side at Villa Park with Ollie Watkins and Leon Bailey putting a stop to the champions’ winning run. The Jekyll and Hyde nature of Tottenham is then in full effect against Liverpool as Dominic Solanke polishes off a superb performance to really heat the title race up. Arsenal prove the doubters wrong by getting themselves back into the title race with a slender win away at Crystal Palace. After City’s earlier slip-up, Odegaard leads the celebrations in front of their supporters as the feel-good factor returns to the Gunners faithful. And their weekend will be topped off when Chelsea lose for the second weekend running. The Blues’ Goodison Park woes will be in full effect when Sean Dyche’s Everton make it a miserable Christmas for Maresca. Despite their defeat, Liverpool will sit on top of the tree on Christmas Day. However, their earlier supremity will seemingly have diminished. Aston Villa 2-0 Manchester City Tottenham Hotspur 3-1 Liverpool Crystal Palace 0-1 Arsenal  Everton 2-0 Chelsea      Chelsea have only beaten Everton once at Goodison Park in the past seven years, back in 2022       A win away at Crystal Palace could be huge for Arsenal if Liverpool and City do drop points Gameweek 18 (December 26-27) City’s disappointment prior to Christmas will be a distant memory come Boxing Day when they take their anger out on Everton at the Etihad. Erling Haaland scores a hat-trick with Savinho and Matheus Nunes getting in on the act to ensure they stay second. Liverpool will also run riot and respond to defeat in the capital with a thumping victory over Leicester City at Anfield. It will ease some Christmas concerns from the fans. Arsenal and Chelsea will both follow suit with victories over Fulham and Ipswich, respectively. No Christmas hangovers will affect this bunch. Manchester City 5-0 Everton Liverpool 3-0 Leicester City Chelsea 2-1 Fulham Arsenal 2-0 Ipswich Town       Mikel Arteta needs his Arsenal side to deliver over the winter to keep them in the title hunt Gameweek 19 (December 29 – January 1) A trip to Leicester is up next for Guardiola’s side and just like Liverpool a few days earlier, they dismantle Steve Cooper’s side with ease. There will be no goal for Erling Haaland, but Phil Foden, Josko Gvardiol, and Bernardo Silva get the job done instead to keep the pressure on Liverpool in the title race. The Reds don’t buckle under it, though. This time a trip back to the capital proves a fruitful one as Slot’s side mount more misery on a struggling West Ham side at the London Stadium. Salah does what he does best, netting a brace. At the other end, Liverpool’s stellar defence stand strong to make it back-to-back clean sheets for the Redmen. Once again, it will be a clean sweep of victories for the current top four with Chelsea rocking up to Portman Road and getting the job done. Cole Palmer pulls the strings and even bags a goal for himself. Meanwhile, Arsenal endure a tough test at Brentford but pass with flying colours four wins on the bounce and nine matches unbeaten. Leicester City 0-3 Manchester City  West Ham United 0-2 Liverpool Ipswich Town 1-3 Chelsea Brentford 0-1 Arsenal      Expect Mohamed Salah to the damage once again when Liverpool travel to West Ham United Gameweek 20 (January 4-6) New year, same old Manchester City. In the final gameweek of this prediction, the champions make light work of West Ham United just a matter of days after Liverpool did the same. However, they will remain three points behind the leaders after 20 matches. Slot’s Reds face off against their biggest rivals United with the visitors looking to enact revenge after embarrassment at Old Trafford.  Diaz does more damage to Amorim’s side early doors, but Bruno Fernandes responds quickly with a goal at the Kop. The game looks set to be heading for a 1-1 draw until Salah pops up with a huge goal to send Anfield bananas. Chelsea’s winning burst comes to an end away at Crystal Palace as they play out a boring goalless draw, putting the breaks on the momentum they built after Christmas. Their result seems like a good one in comparison to Arsenal’s, though. The Gunners finally suffer their first defeat since early November as Fabian Hurzeler’s Brighton come up trumps against a title challenger yet again. If it all plays out like this, Liverpool will be top with 18 matches left to play with City lurking behind them in second. Arteta’s side will be seven points adrift, and surely out of the race, while Chelsea will be solely focused on getting into the top four. Manchester City 4-0 West Ham United  Crystal Palace 0-0 Chelsea Brighton and Hove Albion 2-1 Arsenal  Liverpool 2-1 Manchester United  Your email address will not be published.

The Hammers boss has overseen a difficult stat to his time in charge of the club, with his side 14th in the Premier League table amid an underwhelming 11 games in the opening months of the season. They have three wins from their matches so far, conceding 19 goals and suffering some damning losses, including 3-0 defeats by Nottingham Forest and Chelsea and also losing 5-1 to Liverpool in the League Cup.   The club invested heavily in the summer, signing the likes of Max Kilman for £40million and Crysencio Summerville for £25m, but are yet to see a return for their investment. It was also over the summer that they opted to swap manager, with David Moyes, who won the club their first major trophy in 42 years when they lifted the Conference League, leaving. He was replaced by Lopetegui, who could be already fighting for his job. And, according to The Guardian, he has two matches to save it, with the Hammers already sounding out replacements.      Julen Lopetegui has just two games to save his West Ham career, according to a report      Lopetegui’s West Ham are 14th in the Premier League table and have struggled this season      He replaced David Moyes in summer but there is yet to be an improvement team’s showings It is reported that those in senior positions at West Ham still have belief in the former Real Madrid boss, but that that belief is fading and he is facing the potential sack this month. The Premier League is back on Saturday following the latest international break – the final until March – and West Ham will face Newcastle on Monday night at St James’ Park, live on Sky. It is reported that any final decision will unlikely be made based off that game, but a heavy defeat could force the decision makers’ hands a game earlier than they may potentially plan to do. If he does survive that match in the north east, he will take his side back to the capital for a home match against title challengers Arsenal.  That will be in front of home fans who are already losing their patience at the London Stadium, and two tough defeats, potentially finishing on November 30 against Arsenal, could be the end of his reign.  It is reported that West Ham’s biggest shareholder, David Sullivan, is reluctant to make mid-season firings, but concern is growing over current performances and talks are understood to have been held over a potential change. Who could be Lopetegui’s replacement is unclear, but a number of talks have been held previously, with former Borussia Dortmund boss Edin Terzic said to have been of interest. Former Denmark man Kasper Hjulmand could also be monitored, while ex-Benfica manager Roger Schmidt and Stuttgart’s Sebastian Hoeness could also be options. Your email address will not be published.

Plus, Man Utd are ready to go all-in to beat Real Madrid to the signing of Alphonso Davies and one of Europe’s brightest coaches has revealed why he snubbed Chelsea. There’s plenty to cover, so let’s jump right in. FootballTransfers can reveal that Arsenal scouts have been keeping an eye on last season’s European assist king Alex Baena of Villarreal. We are also told that Man City expect Pep Guardiola to leave in 2026 despite having the option for a further season. Ruben Amorim has instructed Man Utd to do whatever is necessary to sign Real Madrid target Alphonso Davies. The coach could also fast-track a 16-year-old to the first team to alleviate the club’s striker woes. That might be game over for Joshua Zirkzee, but Man Utd could struggle to offload him. It has been revealed that Man Utd previously tried to hire Enzo Maresca. They also considered Stuttgart coach Sebastian Hoeness – as did Chelsea – and he has now revealed why he snubbed the two Premier League giants.
