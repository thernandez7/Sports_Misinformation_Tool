James added 14 assists with 12 rebounds in his fourth triple-double of the season. Los Angeles rookie Dalton Knecht added a career-best 19 points while going 5-for-5 from 3-point range. The Lakers improved to 6-0 at home, matching the NBA-best mark also held by the Cleveland Cavaliers and Orlando Magic. Los Angeles' Anthony Davis scored 21 points and pulled down 14 rebounds. Rui Hachimura had 19 points and Austin Reaves scored 18 for the Lakers, including a decisive 3-pointer with 1:09 remaining for a 124-117 lead. Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 29 points and Scotty Pippen Jr., Santi Aldama and Marcus Smart each added 15 points as the Grizzlies saw their season-best three-game winning streak come to an end. Memphis played without Ja Morant (hip) for the third consecutive game and also was without Brandon Clarke (toe) and Desmond Bane (oblique). Luke Kennard and Zach Edey each added 12 points as the Grizzlies finished with seven players in double figures scoring for the fourth consecutive game. After trailing by 15 points in the first half, the Grizzlies led by as many as nine points multiple times in the third quarter before entering the fourth with a 96-91 advantage. The Lakers opened the final quarter on a 10-2 run to go up 101-98 with 9:37 remaining on a layup by James. The teams traded the lead from there until a pair of Davis 3-pointers 62 seconds apart as Los Angeles went up 116-110 with 3:49 remaining. The Lakers led by as many as 13 points in the first quarter and were up 60-48 with less than four minutes remaining in the second quarter before the Grizzlies closed on a 16-5 run to pull within 65-64 at halftime.

Miami (3-6) snapped a three-game losing streak this past Monday with a 23-15 road win against the Los Angeles Rams. The Raiders (2-7) are coming off an eventful bye week and hope to snap their own losing streak, currently at five games. Las Vegas coach Antonio Pierce said Wednesday the Raiders are sticking with Gardner Minshew as their starting quarterback in the hopes of stopping the skid. Minshew has already been benched at two different points this season and has 12 turnovers, which ranks second in the NFL. Minshew has completed 67 percent of his passes (148 for 221) for 1,501 yards, six touchdowns and eight interceptions with an 80.2 passer rating this season. ""Listen, when we brought in Gardner, we expected, obviously, the play that we had seen in the past and at some point, you've got to give a guy confidence,"" Pierce said. ""And there's been times, obviously, with turnovers and other things that have taken place, where we made decisions to either put him on the bench or go to another quarterback."" Minshew was most recently benched in the second half of the Raiders' loss to Cincinnati Bengals in Week 9. The recently signed Desmond Ridder took over in his place. Since the loss, the Raiders have made several personnel moves. Offensive coordinator Luke Getsy, offensive line coach James Cregg and quarterbacks coach Rich Scangarello were all fired. The Raiders elevated Scott Turner to interim offensive coordinator and made former Miami Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin their interim offensive line coach. Las Vegas also hired veteran coach Norv Turner, Scott's father, as senior adviser. The Dolphins' defense held things together through the team's rough start this season. On Monday, the unit sacked Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford four times, forced two turnovers and kept Los Angeles out of the end zone. Miami's offense continues to regain some rhythm as Tua Tagovailoa prepares to make his fourth start since returning from the concussion he suffered in Week 2 against Buffalo. Since his return, Tagovailoa has completed 73 of 94 passes for 672 yards, four touchdowns and one interception. ""I just know there's been an urgency for us to turn our season around and we've looked at it like we are trying to turn each day around, trying to fix each day of prep, fix everything that we can learn from from the game situations and how the prep relates and how we're applying our prep to the games in the realest form, not just saying ‘I want to win,' "" Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said. The Dolphins got some bad news this week regarding their offensive line. Starting right tackle Austin Jackson was placed on injured reserve and is out for the season following a knee injury. Kendall Lamm will likely fill in again with rookie Patrick Paul backing him up. As of Wednesday, offensive lineman Robert Jones (knee), wide receiver Tyreek Hill (wrist) and cornerback Kendall Fuller (concussion) did not practice for the Dolphins. For the Raiders, centers Andre James (ankle) and Cody Whitehair (ankle), cornerback Nate Hobbs (ankle) and tight end Harrison Bryant (ankle) did not practice. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Dalano Banton scored 13 points for Portland, which won consecutive games for the first time this season. Toumani Camara had 11 points, eight rebounds and three steals and Scoot Henderson also had 11 points for the Trail Blazers. Anthony Edwards scored 24 points and had four steals for the Timberwolves but missed all nine of his 3-point attempts. Last Friday in Minneapolis, he made nine treys and scored 37 points as the Timberwolves rolled to a 127-102 victory over Portland. Julius Randle amassed 20 points and 10 rebounds and Naz Reid produced 15 points off the bench for Minnesota, which lost its third straight contest. Nickeil Alexander-Walker had 13 points and three steals and Rudy Gobert added 12 points and 11 rebounds for the Timberwolves. The Trail Blazers made 45.2 percent of their shots, including 9 of 25 (36 percent) from 3-point range. Minnesota shot just 39.4 percent from the field and was a wobbly 7 of 39 (17.9 percent) from 3-point range. Portland scored 13 consecutive points in the fourth quarter to open up an 89-78 advantage. Sharpe capped the burst by sinking two free throws with 6:39 remaining. Minnesota moved within 96-92 on Gobert's three-point play with 1:48 left, but Sharpe answered with a 3-pointer 10 seconds later. Edwards later made a layup to bring Minnesota with 101-96 with one minute left. However, Sharpe made two free throws and Banton converted a three-point play to push the margin to 10 with 16.5 seconds left to put it away. Minnesota looked motivated to avenge the Tuesday loss when it jumped out to early leads of 11-2 and 16-4. The Timberwolves led 33-23 at the end of the quarter. The Trail Blazers moved ahead for the first time at 44-42 on Camara's putback with 2:38 remaining in the half. The score was tied at 48 at the break.

Despite playing without injured Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal, the Suns hung tough and got within 98-90 after a driving hoop by Devin Booker three minutes into the fourth quarter before running out of gas. Also short-handed with the absence of injured Malik Monk and having lost DeMar DeRozan to a sore back in the first half, Sacramento saved its best basketball for the final nine minutes, outscoring the visitors 29-14. The decisive run began with a 12-0 burst that featured 3-pointers by Huerter and Keon Ellis, blowing the game open at 110-90 with just 5:55 remaining.

The Minnesota Vikings would prefer to avoid having to pull off that trick for a second week in a row. Minnesota (7-2) will look to wake up its offense when it visits the Tennessee Titans (2-7) on Sunday afternoon in Nashville. The Vikings are coming off a 12-7 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in which all of their scoring consisted of four field goals. Sam Darnold did not help matters at quarterback as he threw a pair of interceptions in the Jaguars end zone. Darnold has six turnovers in his past two games. Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell wants Darnold and the rest of the offense to take better care of the ball this weekend at Tennessee. ""We're doing a lot of little things that normally lead to having good chances to win,"" O'Connell said. ""But clearly the turnovers are keeping these games very close and relying on other aspects of our team to overcome for that. We need to score points. We need to finish these drives. ""What you can't have is turnovers in the opposing team's end. You're limiting your opportunity to add three, seven, three, seven. Those things add up with the way our defense has played the last couple weeks. So, we've got to do a better job collectively as a group -- myself, our staff, and then our players and clearly Sam."" Meanwhile, look for Tennessee to focus on takeaways as it looks to bounce back from a loss last week against the Los Angeles Chargers. The Titans have lost four of their past five contests, and they are 1-3 on their home field entering the weekend. Titans quarterback Will Levis is expected to make his second straight start since returning from a shoulder injury. He has a modest 79.6 passer rating this season while throwing for 874 yards, seven touchdowns and seven interceptions. Will the remaining eight games in the regular season be enough for Titans coach Brian Callahan and his staff to determine whether Levis is the franchise quarterback going forward? ""It's hard to put a timeline on that,"" Callahan said this week. ""For me, I'm looking for things every game, every practice. If he improves the play that he had last week, we're all going to feel really good about how he's played the position through two games back (from injury). We're just going to keep stacking those games."" Tony Pollard leads the Titans with 666 rushing yards and three touchdowns but has been hindered by a foot injury. Calvin Ridley is the team's No. 1 wide receiver with 32 catches for 483 yards and three scores. The Vikings also are banged up in the backfield as Aaron Jones was limited in practice to start the week because of a rib injury. Jones has rushed for 653 yards and two touchdowns this season. Justin Jefferson has a team-high 53 catches for 831 yards and five touchdowns in the first nine games of the season. He is looking to bounce back from a season-low of 48 receiving yards against Jacksonville last week. This is the first matchup between the teams since Sept. 27, 2020, when the Titans earned a 31-30 win. This will be the Vikings' first regular-season game in Nashville since 2016, when they beat the Titans 25-16. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Chicago Bears (4-5) can't get much right lately, especially on offense, where new coordinator Thomas Brown is tasked with sparking a rapid turnaround against the visiting Packers (6-3). After scoring at least 24 points in four of its past five games, Green Bay had little trouble moving the ball. Meanwhile, additional rest has allowed quarterback Jordan Love to create distance from knee and groin injuries that hobbled him during the first half of the season. ""Certainly, when you're limited in your lower half as a quarterback, really any type of thrower, that can have a big effect on your ability to just move around in the pocket or throw accurately,"" Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. ""So, it'll be good to just get him some practice under his belt where he's fully healthy."" Offensive struggles continue to plague quarterback Caleb Williams and Chicago. The Bears allowed 10 sacks the past two games and scored just 27 points during the three-game losing streak they'll carry into their first NFC North game of the season. Some Bears fans chanted for coach Matt Eberflus' firing during a 19-3 loss to struggling New England at Soldier Field last week. He's 0-4 against the Packers. On Tuesday, the organization sacked offensive coordinator Shane Waldron instead.  An attack led by Williams, the No. 1 overall draft pick, and flanked by multiple offseason acquisitions has sputtered to an average of 277.6 yards per game, third lowest in the league, and enters Sunday on a streak of 23 straight possessions without a touchdown. The Bears are treading water in the division but opportunities to jump in the standings will be plentiful starting Sunday. After hosting the Packers, the Bears take on the Vikings (7-3), pay a Thanksgiving Day visit to the Detroit Lions (8-1) and start December with a trip to San Francisco (5-4). If they stay on their feet during that run, they'll get all three division opponents and the Seattle Seahawks before the regular season ends.  Injuries along the offensive line haven't helped, leading to 38 sacks of Williams. Last week he started behind a line featuring two backup tackles. On Wednesday, Chicago released veteran guard Nate Davis, who signed a three-year, $30 million deal before last season. Eberflus reiterated that he made the decision to fire Waldron. While players vented frustrations about the offense, they didn't ask that Waldron be removed. ""They just want to do more,"" Eberflus said. ""Individually and as a group. They want to be more productive. More effective. Score points for our football team."" Brown will pivot from passing game coordinator to take the reins as offensive coordinator. He was promoted to offensive coordinator during the season with the Carolina Panthers last season. Green Bay has dominated the NFL's oldest rivalry lately. The Packers boast a 10-game winning streak against the Bears, tied for most in the series and leading the way as the league's longest current win streak by one team against an opponent. The Packers have outscored the Bears by 127 points over that span behind an opportunistic offense and a defense that has limited Chicago to 20 points or less eight times while amassing a plus-19 turnover differential. Green Bay, which has captured three of the past five NFC North titles, is off to a rare 0-2 start in the division but won four of five overall. The Packers lost 24-14 to the Lions in Week 9 but had more total yards, 411-261. ""We've been pretty good as a unit and it's crazy, because it's like we could be so much better,"" Packers running back Josh Jacobs said. ""So, I think that's the fun part about the back end of the season is trying to chase the perfection."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Lots of zeros. According to a report in The Telegraph of London on Wednesday, U.S. players competing at the event will get roughly $400,000 apiece. The pay structure, according to The Telegraph, would be similar to that of the Presidents Cup in September -- a stipend as opposed to a contribution made to the charity of each golfer's choice. However, there are two primary differences between the Presidents Cup and Ryder Cup, according to The Telegraph. First, the amount. The Presidents Cup stipend was $250,000. Second, who is getting paid. While players and captains for both teams were paid at the Presidents Cup in Montreal, the European Ryder Cup golfers will not get paid -- instead opting to play for what European captain Luke Donald called ""passion"" for golf and country. ""It's one week where you play for more than yourself,"" Donald told The Telegraph. ""It's ... not about money or points, it's about coming together as a team and the fans feed off that -- it's all passion. I don't think we should ever get paid."" Talks of Americans getting paid for the Ryder Cup have been brewing for decades. In 1999 at Brookline, Mass. (one of the most famous Ryder Cup weekends in the event's history), golfers including Tiger Woods voiced their opinions on players not being paid despite the event raking in several million dollars. ""I would like to see us receive whatever the amount is, whether it's $200,000, $300,000, $400,000, $500,000 and I think we should be able to keep the money and do whatever we see fit,"" Woods told The Washington Post in 1999. ""I personally would donate all of it to charity. With all the money that's being made, we should have a say in where it goes."" The charitable donations began being made that same year. Pay-for-play at the Ryder Cup became a hot-button topic during last year's competition near Rome after American Patrick Cantlay did not wear a hat during Saturday's play. Multiple reports stated he did not wear the hat as a protest for players not being paid. Cantlay denied that being the reason, instead saying the hat just did not fit. Said one anonymous European player to The Telegraph: ""(The Americans) can do whatever they want. But we don't want payments in our bank accounts, as it'll be the thin end of the wedge and is not what the Ryder Cup is about. ""Let's face it, a lot of the American players have been angling towards this for years, if not decades. ""If it does go ahead, then it will be interesting to see how the fans react at Bethpage, although they'll probably announce it as just an extension of what already happens."" The 2025 Ryder Cup is scheduled to take place Sept. 23-28. The Americans hold a 27-14 advantage all time in the event, though the Europeans have won five of the last seven contests, including a 16 1/2-11 1/2 win at Marco Simone Golf and Country Club in Italy in 2023. The U.S. team will be captained by Keegan Bradley in 2025. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Nick Bjugstad had two goals for Utah, and Michael Kesselring had two assists. Jack McBain and Mikhail Sergachev scored Utah's other goals, both during the third-period flurry. Martin Necas' second-period power-play goal was the only tally for the Hurricanes, despite a whopping 50-21 shots advantage and six power-play opportunities. With the game tied 1-1 at 5:09 of the final frame, Kesselring made a great play to take the puck into Carolina's end, and then made a canny pass to McBain for the conversion. Sergachev followed up at the 7:11 mark, and Bjugstad's second goal of the game came just 17 seconds later to put the hosts up 4-1. Playing in just his fifth game of the season, Utah backup goalie Vejmelka delivered a career night. Vejmelka and the Utah Hockey Club's defenders had to be spectacular during an extended penalty kill in the third period. A fighting/game-misconduct penalty to Michael Carcone formed the bulk of nine minutes of power-play time for Carolina in the final frame, yet the Hurricanes couldn't add another goal. Carolina lost for just the second time in its past 11 games (9-2-0). Hurricanes starting goalie Pyoty Kochetkov stopped 15 of 18 shots in 46:45 of ice time, and Spencer Martin stopped 2 of 3 shots in a relief effort. Defenseman Sean Walker accidentally collided with Kochetkov on McBain's goal, and a shaken-up Kochetkov was removed from the game after Sergachev's tally. Bjugstad opened the scoring at 17:55 of the first period. Bjugstad's goals were his first two of the season, after the veteran forward missed the Utah Hockey Club's first eight games due to an upper-body injury. Necas has 22 points (eight goals, 14 assists) over a career-best 11-game points streak. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

He has completed 62.4 percent of his passes for 2,258 yards and 15 touchdowns with seven interceptions -- with his completion percentage, yards per completion and touchdown rate ranking among the lowest of his 20-year career. The Jets, who entered the season with high expectations, own a 3-7 record.

It was Antetokounmpo's ninth 50-plus outing and the second best of his career, after his 64-point effort against Indiana last season. The two-time MVP hit 21 of 34 from the field, 16 of 17 from the foul line, and had 14 rebounds, seven assists and three blocks. Brook Lopez provided the support with 29 points. Cade Cunningham had 35 points and 11 assists for the Pistons, while Malik Beasley hit eight 3-pointers in his 26-point haul. Antetokounmpo's big evening was almost ruined when he was whistled for a foul with one second left in regulation, and the score was tied at 111, sending Ronald Holland to the free-throw line. Bucks coach Doc Rivers challenged the call unsuccessfully but Holland missed both foul shots, forcing the extension, which Antetokounmpo dominated with 11 points. Antetokounmpo was unguardable from the outset, attacking the Pistons with 22 first-quarter points, but Milwaukee received virtually no other offensive production early. Two Lopez free throws were the only other scores for the Bucks who, Antetokounmpo aside, were 0-for-12 from the floor. Beasley caught fire from the perimeter in the second term against his old side, his corner triple in the closing moments capping a 7-0 run to give Detroit a 60-47 halftime advantage. The Pistons were 8 of 13 from downtown at the half. Detroit's lead swelled to 18 points in the third before the Bucks mounted a sustained fightback, aided by the ejection of Pistons power forward Isaiah Stewart with 3:02 remaining in the third. Stewart had grabbed Antetokounmpo's jersey and yanked him to the ground. Lopez drained a 30-footer in the closing moments of the quarter to cap a 33-14 run and give Milwaukee its first lead. The 7-footer was doing it at both ends, knocking down his fourth triple early in the fourth, then rejecting Cunningham's dunk attempt. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Ben Humrichous added 10 points and six rebounds for Illinois (3-0), which shot a season-low 41.8 percent from the field and committed 18 turnovers against Oakland's matchup zone. Jayson Woodrich paced Oakland (1-2) with 11 points before leaving with 3:28 left with a left shoulder injury. DQ Cole added 10 points and four steals, but the Golden Grizzlies also had 18 turnovers and followed up last week's 3-for-26 3-point shooting at Boise State by going 4-for-25 versus Illinois. Illinois built a 9-5 lead by the first media timeout, then inserted Will Riley into the lineup. The Big Ten's reigning freshman of the week drilled a step-back 3-pointer on his first touch, then added an 8-foot runner and two free throws to cap a three-minute stretch that pushed Illinois' margin to 18-9. Illinois extended the lead to 22-9 when Dra Gibbs-Lawhorn swiped a pass and broke away from a two-handed jam at the 10:52 mark. Oakland responded with 10 straight points in just 2:11 to cut the margin to 22-19. Tuburu Naivalurua started the spree with a jumper, Woodrich finished it with a driving layup and Malcolm Christie added four free throws along the way -- two when Illinois coach Brad Underwood was hit with a technical. Illinois quelled the rally with back-to-back 3-pointers by Kylan Boswell and Tre White, but Naivalurua and teammate Allen Mukeba threw down violent dunks in the final two minutes of the half to pull the Golden Grizzlies within 36-29 at the break. The teams combined for 22 turnovers in the first half, then Illinois committed two miscues in the first 66 seconds of the second half to enable Oakland to pull within two. The first turnover came when Mukeba poked away a pass and raced ahead of the pack for a fierce dunk, then a steal by Cole turned into two Woodrich free throws to make it 38-36 with 18:34 left. That's when Illinois spread the floor and fed Ivisic at the free-throw line, where he could go one-on-one. The lefty sank two jumpers and a layup to help the Fighting Illini rebuild a 49-38 lead with 15:02 to play. Oakland never got within single digits again as both teams went cold. The Illini missed 10 of 11 shots at one point, and the Golden Grizzlies 11 of 12.  Boswell sank two free throws and a 3-pointer, then a no-look pass by Kasparas Jakucionis set up a dunk by Ivisic to make it 66-49 with 1:39 to go. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After overcoming a two-goal deficit in the third period of a win over the St. Louis Blues on Tuesday, the Bruins look to complete their two-game road trip on another high note Thursday against the Dallas Stars. St. Louis used power-play goals to take a 2-0 lead through two periods, but Morgan Geekie, Charlie McAvoy and David Pastrnak all scored in the final frame to turn the game around. The win was Boston's fourth in six games (4-1-1) following a previous 1-4-1 stretch. An identity that coach Jim Montgomery had emphasized of late showed through. ""We talked about staying with it for 60 minutes and playing the right way,"" Montgomery said. ""And even though we made a couple of mistakes in the third still -- because you're going to make mistakes, it's a game of mistakes -- we just kept battling. ... We got to the goal line and got some greasy goals."" Pastrnak scored the game-winner with 1:47 remaining, completing the Bruins' first third-period comeback from multiple goals since Nov. 1, 2022. McAvoy matched him with a two-point effort. McAvoy believes that win can lead to more in Dallas and moving forward to a three-game homestand, which begins with a Saturday rematch against the Blues. ""You've got to do the right things moving forward, but there's a couple times throughout a (season) where you ... come back and find a way like we did (Tuesday), and you can really build off those,"" McAvoy said. Defenseman Hampus Lindholm was lost to a lower-body injury during Tuesday's game and will miss ""weeks,"" leading the Bruins to recall Jordan Oesterle from Providence of the AHL, where he recorded three goals and eight points in nine games. The 32-year-old Oesterle, who Montgomery described as a smart player and excellent skater, has played in 371 career NHL games, most recently with the Calgary Flames last season. The Stars have won two of three since returning from the NHL Global Series in Finland and were last in action Monday at Pittsburgh, scoring six straight first-period goals en route to a 7-1 drubbing of the Penguins. ""It was a good step in the right direction,"" center Matt Duchene said. ""We know what to expect from Boston. It's never an easy game. No matter how well or not well they're playing, they're always a tough team. ... Our compete and details have to be there."" Defenseman Miro Heiskanen was the lone repeat scorer in Pittsburgh, helping Dallas become the first NHL team to rattle off six goals during the opening period of any game since the 2022-23 season. ""It's nice for a bunch of the guys to get on the board and kind of feel good about ourselves,"" left winger Mason Marchment said. ""I thought, right from the start of the game, we were on it."" Marchment notched a goal and four assists, with four of his five points coming in the first. Prior to Monday, Dallas had lost three of four and gone three consecutive games without scoring more than three goals. The seven-goal total was its highest since a 5-2 win in Boston Oct. 24 in which Duchene and Tyler Seguin each registered a goal and two assists. ""We haven't had one of those games all year, we had some bounces and some seeing-eye goals,"" coach Pete DeBoer said. ""We had some guys who really needed a goal, so that was much needed."" Wyatt Johnston snapped a 10-game goal drought on Monday, while fellow 21-year-old Logan Stankoven scored for the second time in three games and now has 13 points to lead all NHL rookies. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Kalkbrenner, the Big East player of the week, made all six of his shots from the floor to improve to 35 of 38 on the season. A three-time conference defensive player of the year, Kalkbrenner also had four rebounds and three blocks -- including an emphatic rejection of Pierce Bazil's bid for a dunk early in the second half. Kalkbrenner's dominant performance paved the way for Greg McDermott to record his 328th head coaching victory at Creighton, snapping a tie with his predecessor Dana Altman (1994-2010). Steven Ashworth collected 13 points, seven rebounds and six assists, and Fredrick King added 11 points off the bench in the win. Jamiya Neal had nine points and seven rebounds for the Bluejays (3-0), who benefited from a 36-5 run to close the first half. The second half saw more of the same as Creighton enjoyed an 11-2 run in the first 3 1/2 minutes to effectively seal the win. The Bluejays shot a robust 55.8 percent from the floor, including 33.3 percent from 3-point range. Conversely, the Huskies (1-2) made just 25.4 percent of their attempts from the floor and 14.3 percent from beyond the arc. The 7-foot-1 Kalkbrenner established post position and had his way in the interior, helping Creighton enjoy a 44-18 edge in points in the paint. Houston Christian was led by D'Aundre Samuels' eight points. The Huskies jumped out to a 7-3 lead before the Bluejays ignited their offense with just over 13 minutes to play in the first half. Ashworth sandwiched 3-pointers around a pair of layups by Kalkbrenner to begin Creighton's 16-0 run. Demari Williams' jumper with 6:25 remaining in the first half for the Huskies was quickly answered by a barrage from the Bluejays.

William Nylander had a goal and an assist for the Maple Leafs, who have won four of their last five games. Joseph Woll made 24 saves. Nylander made it 3-2 at 15:51 of the third period when he pushed in a Matthew Knies shot that had trickled behind Thompson. After Knies had a tying goal waved off for a high stick, Marner's one-timer on the power play from the left circle with Woll pulled for the extra attacker knotted it 3-3 with 48 seconds left. Aliaksei Protas had a goal and an assist, and Thompson made 30 saves for the Capitals. Taylor Raddysh gave Washington a 1-0 lead at 11:12 of the first period when his centering pass hit the skate of Toronto's Max Domi and deflected blocker side on Woll.

Dylan Strome put the Capitals in front 2-1 at 18:33. The center took a pass from Protas to the net and, after showing backhand, went to his forehand to slip it by the left skate of Woll. After a Washington goal midway through the second period was overturned on a Maple Leafs challenge for goaltender interference, Protas got one that counted for a 3-1 advantage at 17:48. His pass intended for Alex Ovechkin down low was blocked, and Rasmus Sandin collected it and threaded it back to Protas, who quickly fired it glove side from the bottom of the right circle.

But Sengun (13 points, 11 rebounds) delivered his driving dunk before Tari Eason (18 points, 10 rebounds) added another in transition to seal the victory.

The storyline entering the contest was the Cowboys squaring off against former head coach Jeff Linder, who left the Wyoming program after four seasons in May to become the lead assistant at Texas Tech under Grant McCasland. In exchange for Linder, Texas Tech agreed to two games between the schools the next two years with Tech paying Wyoming $150,000 for each. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Johni Broome, selected the SEC Player of the Week on Monday, and Chaney Johnson each scored 18 points to lead the Tigers (3-0). Johnson's night included 12 rebounds plus a dunk that increased the Tigers' lead to 36-22 entering halftime. Auburn's Denver Jones and Chad Baker-Mazara tallied 12 points apiece. Kent State (2-1) was carried by forward VonCameron Davis' 19 points but struggled from beyond the 3-point arc. The Golden Flashes went 5-for-21 (23.8 percent) from long distance.

Kent State trailed 30-8 with 7:10 to go in the first half after an 8-0 Tigers surge that featured three fastbreak baskets. The Golden Flashes scored the next 12 points, capped by a Sullinger layup, to get within 30-20 with 2:15 remaining in the half. Johnson produced two baskets late in the half to help give the Tigers a 36-22 advantage entering intermission. Auburn used a 8-0 run -- with six of the points coming from Broome -- to go ahead 49-37 with 13:19 left in the game. The Tigers outrebounded the Golden Flashes 41-33, and the hosts scored 42 points in the paint compared to just 26 for Kent State.

After falling behind 90-68 late in the third quarter, New York -- playing the second leg of a back-to-back -- ended the period on a 17-0 run to set up an intense fourth quarter. There were 10 lead changes in the final period, the last coming on White's free throws on a tough foul call against Josh Hart. Jalen Brunson, who scored a pair of go-ahead baskets under duress in the final 38 seconds, created space for a fadeaway jumper at the buzzer, but his attempt rimmed in and out. Had the Knicks completed the comeback, it would have been the franchise's biggest second-half rally since a 26-point turnaround in March 2004. Zach LaVine led Chicago with 31 points and matched Brunson with a game-high eight assists. He also snagged seven rebounds. Karl-Anthony Towns scored 17 of his 46 points in the fourth quarter and hauled in 10 rebounds. Towns' scoring performance was a personal best since joining the Knicks in an offseason trade. Brunson and Towns combined to score 10 of New York's final 12 points. White, meanwhile, was clutch for Chicago. His 3-pointer on one of Ayo Dosunmu's six assists to answer a hard-charging Towns bucket gave the Bulls a four-point cushion in the final two minutes. Dosunmu was one of five Bulls to score in double-figures, shooting 5-of-8 from the floor en route to 16 points. Nikola Vucevic posted a double-double of 19 points and 11 rebounds, and Patrick Williams added 18 points. Mikal Bridges scored 20 points for New York. OG Anunoby chipped in 14 points and nine rebounds, and Cameron Payne scored 11 points off the bench. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Berke Buyuktuncel added 12 and Brice Williams chipped in 10 points for the Cornhuskers (3-0), who canned 43.1 percent of their shots from the field and converted 23 of 28 free throws.  Nebraska also earned a 43-31 advantage in rebounding and committed just eight turnovers. Four players reached double figures for the Knights (1-3), led by Terrence Brown's game-high 23 points. Jo'el Emanuel, Ahmed Barba-Bey and Dylan Jones each scored 10, but FDU simply didn't possess enough firepower to pull off the upset, sinking only 40.4 percent of its field-goal tries. The Cornhuskers owned a 20-point halftime lead but did have to exert themselves a bit in the second half when the Knights pulled within 58-49 at the 11:02 mark when Barba-Bey drilled a 3-pointer. But Williams converted a three-point play to start a 13-2 run that restored a 20-point cushion with 5:26 remaining. All 12 players who got in the game for Nebraska scored, and Gary collected five of the team's 20 assists on the Cornhuskers' 28 made baskets. A pregame storyline was how Nebraska would respond after a lackluster effort in Saturday night's 63-58 home win over Bethune-Cookman. Coach Fred Hoiberg said he considered a litany of solutions before deciding to just ask his team to execute its high-tempo, free-flowing offense in a more consistent fashion. He got his wish for most of the first half as Nebraska was able to punish FDU inside, making nearly two-thirds of its two-point shots and also attracting a spate of fouls. The Cornhuskers sank 14 of 17 at the free-throw line in the half while the Knights were just 4 of 7. A 10-0 run gave Nebraska a 21-10 advantage at the 9:10 mark after an Ahron Ulis layup.

Williams added seven assists, six rebounds, four steals and two blocks. The Thunder, who are 2-0 since Chet Holmgren suffered a broken pelvis in Sunday's loss to Golden State, rode its defense to Wednesday's win.

The Pelicans managed just four points off seven Oklahoma City turnovers and didn't score their lone fast-break basket until late in the fourth quarter.

Boston beat the Nets for the sixth straight time and for the 12th time in the past 13 meetings. Coming off a 5-of-16 showing in Tuesday's one-point home loss to the Atlanta Hawks, Tatum made 12 of 19 of shots, handed out 10 of Boston's season-best 35 assists and collected nine rebounds. Jaylen Brown added 24 points and 12 rebounds as the Celtics delighted many of their fans in the crowd by shooting a season-best 53.8 percent. Payton Pritchard contributed 23, Jrue Holiday chipped in 16 and Sam Hauser finished with 12 as the trio combined to hit 11 of Boston's 22 3s. Ziare Williams scored 23 points and started for the second straight game for Dorian Finney-Smith (sprained left ankle) but the Nets could not keep pace with Boston's offense and lost for the third time in four games. Brooklyn also played without Ben Simmons (left calf tightness). Cam Thomas added 17 and Dennis Schroder contributed 16 as the Nets shot 50.6 percent and took their most lopsided loss of the season. Cameron Johnson's 3-pointer opened a 26-13 lead for the Nets with 3:52 remaining, but the Celtics ended the opening period with a 19-8 run wherein Tatum scored nine of their final 12 points of the quarter to slice the deficit to 34-32.

Paul, a 27-year-old YouTube star turned professional boxer, has risen quickly in his quest for mainstream boxing credibility. In July, he knocked out Mike Perry, a veteran of UFC and Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship, to earn his fourth consecutive win and improve to 10-1 with seven KOs. Opposite Paul is the former undisputed heavyweight champion Tyson, 58. The fight is Tyson's first sanctioned professional boxing match since losing to Kevin McBride in June 2005. Tyson retired shortly after that. His most recent bout was an exhibition bout against Roy Jones Jr. in November 2020. Tyson (50-6, 44 KOs) was a man of few words on Wednesday night, responding to critics who are predicting he's too old to compete at the highest level and confirming he is only focused on the fight against Paul and nothing past that. ""I'm just ready to fight,"" Tyson said. He remained stoic throughout the event, answering only the questions assigned to him and letting Paul make bold predictions about how the fight might play out. Paul asked nine of the 12 fighters on stage for Wednesday's event to honor a spontaneous bet if he lost to Tyson. Bets included putting fight purses at stake and as little as $20. When asked whether he would fight actual boxers (omitting Tyson), Paul brushed off the question but said his goal remains becoming the biggest superstar the sport has ever seen. ""Just excitement,"" Paul said. ""Excitement. Big fights, big knockouts. A lot of fighters go in (the ring) and have boring (expletive) fights like Floyd Mayweather (Jr.), and I've brought in a lot of excitement to the sport, knocking people out in the biggest platforms possible going against the biggest names and making the matchups fans want to see."" Tyson said he doesn't believe in the circus aspect of the fight, treating Paul like any other boxer. ""The people speak for themselves,"" Tyson said when addressing the plethora of champions on stage with him. Paul vs. Tyson was initially scheduled for July 20 before Tyson's ulcer flare-up in late May forced a postponement. The fight will take place at AT&T Stadium, home to the NFL's Dallas Cowboys. According to moderator and MMA journalist Ariel Helwani, 70,000 fans are expected to attend with a limited ticket inventory still available. The main card begins at 8 p.m. ET and includes four fights. The co-feature is a rematch over two years in the making, featuring Katie Taylor of Ireland against Amanda Serrano of Puerto Rico for the undisputed super lightweight world title. Taylor won the first bout by split decision after 10 rounds to keep her lightweight crown on May 1, 2022, at New York's Madison Square Garden. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Philadelphia fought hard without Joel Embiid (knee), Paul George (knee) and Tyrese Maxey (hamstring) but still lost for the ninth time in 11 games this season. The 76ers were playing on back-to-back nights, having lost to the New York Knicks on Tuesday. Rookie Jared McCain took advantage of the available playing time by scoring a career-high 34 points, while Kelly Oubre Jr. had 20 and Caleb Martin chipped in 18. With Cleveland clinging to a 103-100 lead with under three minutes to play, Mitchell drained 3-pointers on consecutive possessions to put the Cavaliers ahead 109-102. He added a step-back 3-pointer with 1:18 remaining and then drove for a layup to make it 114-104 with about a minute left. Both teams made five 3-pointers in the first quarter -- the Cavs needed only eight attempts to do so -- as Cleveland led 31-27 after one period. The Sixers began the second quarter with a 12-1 run. Reggie Jackson scored eight of those points for the hosts, while Martin had the other four. Philadelphia led by as many as eight points in the second quarter and held a 54-48 lead going into the locker room.

Garland scored 13 third-quarter points for the visitors, who led 82-78 after three periods. Mitchell found Ty Jerome for a 3-pointer on the first possession of the fourth quarter and then drained a jumper on the next trip to grow Cleveland's cushion to 87-78. Philadelphia chipped away, however, closing within 95-93 on Oubre's layup with 6:47 to play. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

USC Upstate kept applying pressure with perimeter shots as Andrew McConnell connected for a 67-61 edge. Wake Forest finally went back ahead on Reid's dunk with just under four minutes to play. After a back-and-forth stretch that included Cosby's second 3-pointer of the half for Wake Forest and Dean's tip-in, the score was tied at 75. Wake Forest led 41-38 at halftime despite shooting 3-for-16 on 3-pointers. The Spartans withstood 12 first-half turnovers to stay within striking distance. Going 9-for-9 on free throws helped the cause. Wake Forest had pulled out a 72-70 victory against Michigan in Sunday's game at nearby Greensboro. USC Upstate is 0-3 on the road, with each of the setbacks to Atlantic Coast Conference opponents after losses at North Carolina State and Virginia Tech. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Metcalf hopes to return to action when Seattle (4-5) visits the San Francisco 49ers (5-4) on Sunday. He sustained a Grade 1 MCL sprain in the Seahawks' 34-14 road victory against the Falcons. Seattle then lost home games to the Buffalo Bills and the Los Angeles Rams before a bye in Week 10. Metcalf has 35 receptions on 61 targets for 568 yards and three touchdowns in seven games (six starts) this season. Seattle selected him in the second round of the 2019 NFL Draft out of Ole Miss. A two-time Pro Bowl selection, Metcalf has 407 receptions for 5,900 yards and 46 touchdowns in 89 regular-season games (87 starts). He also has 26 receptions for 451 yards and five TDs in four playoff games, all starts. The Seahawks activated right tackle Abraham Lucas off the physically unable to perform list on Wednesday, at the end of his 21-day practice window. If Lucas had not been activated, he would have stayed on the PUP list for the remainder of the season. Lucas, 26, was a third-round pick of the Seahawks in 2022. He started all 22 games he played in 2022 and 2023 but was limited to six games last season because of a knee injury that required surgery, putting him on the PUP list. To make room for Lucas on the 53-man roster, Seattle placed offensive tackle George Fant on injured reserve that will require he miss at least four games. Fant, 32, played two games, both starts, this season before leaving each contest with a knee injury. Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said he was uncertain if Fant would be able to play again this season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Treys by Zeigler and Milicic helped fuel a strong start for the Volunteers, who led 16-6 less than five minutes into the game thanks to 6-for-6 shooting.

Alcaraz, the No. 3 seed, battled a stomach issue during his 6-1, 7-5 loss to sixth-seeded Norwegian Casper Ruud during round-robin play on Monday. The Spaniard came back and made fairly quick work of the eighth-seeded Rublev, dispatching the Russian in one hour and 36 minutes. ""I surprised myself,"" said Alcaraz, who wore a pink nasal strip during the match to help him breathe easier. ""The way that I played today from the baseline, with my serve. I was really calm. I just tried to be focused on my game and what I had to do and forget about that I'm not feeling well and that I'm sick."" Alcaraz won 84.1 percent (37 of 44) of his first-serve points, held a commanding 33-14 advantage in winners and never faced break point. He waltzed through the first set before having to save a pair of set points during a second-set tiebreaker to improve to 2-1 in his career against Rublev. Alcaraz will meet No. 2 seed and two-time ATP champion Alexander Zverev on Friday as both vie for a spot in the semifinals. Even if he still isn't 100 percent healthy, Alcaraz knows how to lock in mentally as the stakes increase. ""Once you step on the court, you have to forget everything, your struggles outside the court, and you try to put your focus on hitting a good forehand, a good backhand and making good tactics against the opponent,"" he said. Zverev beat Rublev 6-4, 6-4 on Monday before taking care of Ruud 7-6 (3), 6-3 on Wednesday. The German racked up 11 aces to Ruud's three and won 87.2 percent (41 of 47) of his first-serve points.

He was off the injury report for the Commanders (7-3) against the NFC East-leading Eagles (7-2). ""I've improved tremendously,"" Robinson said on Tuesday. ""A lot of movements I haven't been able to make over the last couple weeks I'm starting to build confidence in.

The Sabres will try to get back on track Thursday night when they host the slumping St. Louis Blues in Buffalo, N.Y. ""We got humbled,"" Buffalo captain Rasmus Dahlin said after Monday's loss. ""I think we were very excited about our previous games, and, I don't know, but we know if you're not showing up 100 percent, it's hard to win in this league. ""I think we've got to look ourselves in the mirror after (Monday's game) and really dig in. We can't play like that if we want to win,"" Dahlin said. It didn't help that the Sabres had three players exit Monday's game due to injury. Star center Tage Thompson and defenseman Mattias Samuelsson sustained lower-body injuries, while goaltender Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen left partly due to a minor ailment suffered earlier in practice. Thompson, who leads Buffalo in both goals (11) and points (18), is listed as day-to-day and may play Thursday.  ""He's a huge piece of our team, and we need him out there,"" Dahlin said. Luukkonen (2.83 goals against average, 0.903 save percentage) also has a chance to play Thursday, but Samuelsson will be sidelined indefinitely.

""We've just got to work through it,"" Blues coach Drew Bannister said. ""You go through this as a team, and you got to stick together as a team. The belief is strong in the room, but it's not going to come easy. We're going to have to fight through it together."" St. Louis led the visiting Boston Bruins 2-0 on Tuesday before allowing three goals in the final 15:07 to lose 3-2. Across their last three games, opponents have outscored the Blues 10-1 and outshot them 30-18 in the third period. ""We played two good periods tonight, and guys are playing hard for one another,"" St. Louis captain Brayden Schenn said. ""You just can't take your foot off the gas. Not that we took our foot off the gas, we just played the wrong way in the third period. ""We played a little bit safe. You can't play safe in this league. There's too many good players that feel that, sense that and can make plays. Guys are able to put the puck in the net and that's what happened tonight."" The Blues got winger Mathieu Joseph off the injured list Tuesday, but they are still missing No. 1 center Robert Thomas (broken ankle) and defensemen Philip Broberg and Nick Leddy (lower-body injuries) from their top two defensive pairings. Bannister continues shuffling his forward lines while trying to generate more offense. St. Louis is scoring 2.50 goals per game, which tied for fifth-fewest in the league through Tuesday's games. On the plus side, the Blues scored their first two power play goals at home against the Bruins.

Two nights after a turnover-plagued setback to the Winnipeg Jets, the Rangers hope to correct their mistakes Thursday when they host the San Jose Sharks. The Rangers are 4-4-0 in their past eight games. Each loss in that span was by at least two goals and New York allowed at least five goals in three, including a 6-3 loss to the Jets on Tuesday. The Rangers lost despite 36 shots on goal, their third-highest total so far. ""Whether it be puck decisions, or whether it be a little bit more responsible when we're pressing in the offensive zone, there are definitely situations that we could have done things better,"" New York coach Peter Laviolette said. ""Offensively, I still think that we were on the attack. It's one of those games where you're punching -- trying to punch away at them and generate offense, and sometimes you got to cover up and make sure that you're not coming back and bleeding the other way. And those incidents, they cost us."" The loss was New York's third on home ice since its quick start. The Rangers never led and fell behind 57 seconds into the contest, when it allowed the first goal following a defensive zone turnover by Mika Zibanejad. Zibanejad made the initial miscue trying to get the puck to linemate Artemi Panarin. He also committed a turnover late in the second that led to the Rangers falling behind for good after getting tying goals from Will Cuylle and Alexis Lafreniere. Zibanejad is among the biggest names off to a slow start. After struggling in the latter portion of last spring's run to the conference finals, Zibanejad has two goals and nine assists and was a minus-4 on Tuesday. ""I know that we count on Mika,"" Laviolette said. ""He's an impact player for us, and sometimes when you are pushing offensively to try and make things happen things can go the other way for us, like they did for us tonight as a group."" San Jose is playing better since its season-opening nine-game losing streak (0-7-2). The Sharks are 5-2-1 in their past eight and began their four-game trip with an impressive 44-save performance from Mackenzie Blackwood in Sunday's 1-0 win over the New Jersey Devils. The Sharks followed with a 4-3 shootout loss to the Philadelphia Flyers on Monday, allowing 42 shots on goal. San Jose earned the point by erasing a three-goal deficit. Jack Thompson and Mikael Granlund scored in the final five minutes of the second period before former Ranger Barclay Goodrow scored with under three minutes left in the third.

On Thursday, the Devils will look to repeat the feat and hand the Panthers consecutive setbacks for just the second time this season when the teams reconvene in Sunrise, Fla.  New Jersey is no stranger to ending win streaks for Florida, as the former halted the latter's nine-game run last season.  ""It took a lot of work, a lot of competitiveness and some resilience,"" Devils head coach Sheldon Keefe said. ""For me, we took a step here (on Tuesday), really knowing and feeling of what is required to compete against the league's best. ""It takes what it takes to be able to compete with the league's best."" New Jersey's Jack Hughes continued his goal-scoring binge in the first period, tallying for the fourth time in his last four games to become the fastest player in franchise history to record 300 career points. Hughes needed 325 games to reach 300 points, besting the mark of Kirk Muller (332).  Timo Meier scored the go-ahead goal late in the second period and Paul Cotter and Ondrej Palat added insurance later in the third for the Devils, who have won six of their last eight games. Sam Reinhart scored his team-leading 12th goal of the season and seventh in his last seven games for Florida. The Panthers, however, were unable to muster anything else and fell for the first time since Oct. 22. That said, Reinhart is itching to get back on the ice in his bid to cool off the Devils. ""You get a little bit of that playoff atmosphere in the middle of the season,"" Reinhart said. ""Opportunities like that have to excite you. A couple teams that have been there the last couple years, playing extra months. It's going to be a fun one. A couple adjustments on both sides and right back to battle."" Reinhart has collected seven goals and five assists during his eight-game point streak. Florida could receive a boost to its lineup on Thursday in the form of second-line center Sam Bennett, who sat out on Tuesday due to an upper-body injury. Panthers coach Paul Maurice said Bennett felt better on Wednesday but wanted to wait until Thursday morning to see if he'd be ready to compete in the rematch. Sergei Bobrovsky is expected to get the nod after taking a rare night off on Tuesday. The two-time Vezina Trophy recipient has won five straight starts since receiving the early hook after permitting five goals in two periods against the Minnesota Wild on Oct. 22. Bobrovsky would be wise to keep tabs on Jesper Bratt, who set up two goals on Tuesday to boost his team-leading assist (16) and point totals (21). Bratt has two goals and five assists in his last four games versus the Panthers. Jacob Markstrom turned aside 34 shots on Tuesday to record his fifth win in his last six outings. He owns a 6-5-1 career record versus the Panthers, who selected him in the second round of the 2008 NHL Draft. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Because the season gets underway in February, the short turnaround time means a more extensive overhaul would have to wait until 2026, per the report. Joey Logano was crowned the 2024 Cup Series champion on Sunday at Phoenix despite having the fewest top-five finishes (seven), the fewest top-10 finishes (13) and lowest average finishing position (17.1) for a series champion in the modern era. NASCAR has used its current playoff format since 2017, consisting of four rounds: Round of 16, Round of 12, Round of 8 and the Championship 4. The first three rounds include three races each, while the Championship 4 comprises only the season finale (Phoenix). According to Wednesday's report, topics under review include whether wins should automatically qualify a driver for the playoffs, as is currently the case; whether the regular season champion should get locked into one of the playoffs' later rounds; and whether the final round should consist of multiple races instead of just one. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The slumping Lightning, snared in a four-game losing web (0-3-1), have been idle since last Thursday's 2-1 shootout loss to Philadelphia. They will continue their three-game homestand Thursday when they face the NHL's hottest club, the Winnipeg Jets, to finish the season series. While most coaches would view a week-long break early in the season as a detriment to a fledgling routine, it was thought to be a timely one for the Lightning to get Brayden Point healed up and back centering the top line. Injured in Winnipeg on Nov. 3 after playing just six shifts, Point would be a welcome addition as the fifth-place Atlantic Division squad tries to get its footing. However, the Lightning called up Gage Goncalves on Wednesday morning, and Point did not practice, putting his return in doubt. The 23-year-old Goncalves played in place of the top-line center the past two games. Lightning defenseman Erik Cernak, injured blocking a shot, has been skating with the starters and appears to be on the brink of a return, but all eyes have been on Point's reinsertion into the lineup. The 28-year-old Calgary native ranks second on the club with eight goals and is tied for third in points with 13. He tops the forwards at plus-nine and has netted a club-high five power play goals while in the bumper spot on the top unit. ""First of all, we have to get healthy,"" said coach Jon Cooper, whose team is winless in November. ""There are guys in our lineup who are playing and are fighting through stuff just to play. ... It will probably be a little bit of a reset here for us."" Winnipeg's 7-4 triumph over the Lightning nearly two weeks ago was its third in a league-high seven-game winning streak, and nothing the opposition has done so far has worked to keep the Jets firmly planted on the tarmac. The NHL's best team through approximately one-sixth of the season has only suffered one loss -- a 6-4 home defeat against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Oct. 28 -- and, unsurprisingly, tops the league with a plus-39 goal differential. The Central Division club's amazing run to 7-0-0 on the road continued in the Big Apple on Tuesday night as the three-game road trip kicked off with a 6-3 win over the New York Rangers. However, the rear guard took its first hit this campaign when Logan Stanley was left behind in Winnipeg due to injury. Coach Scott Arniel narrowed down the ailment by saying the 6-foot-7, 231-pound defenseman has a ""mid-body"" injury. ""We just felt it was time to shut it down,"" Arniel said. ""He's playing in a lot of pain. We'll see how he is when we get home."" Haydn Fleury replaced Stanley and skated 13:18, Mark Scheifele set the tone with the first of his two goals in the opening minute, and Kyle Connor added a pair as the Jets beat the Rangers and won for the 15th time in 16 matches. ""We've got a lot of comeback wins and got a lot of wins when we've closed out the third (period),"" said forward Mason Appleton. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

One of the league's most dynamic rookies, Michkov was a healthy scratch in consecutive games for Philadelphia last week. However, coach John Tortorella reinserted the 19-year-old Russian into the lineup Monday against the San Jose Sharks, and Michkov responded with a goal in regulation and another in the shootout. ""He played good,"" Tortorella said after the 4-3 victory. ""... I wasn't worried about how he was going to respond. I wasn't worried about that at all. He competes."" Michkov's absence was framed by the organization as more of a reset, rather than a punishment; an opportunity to build on what he's already learned while watching a couple of games from the press box. ""With the two games missing, I had plenty of energy and feel really good,"" Michkov said through an interpreter. ""The two games I watched, it was good to watch and good to get some time off and rethink."" Meanwhile, from a team standpoint, the Flyers are playing their best hockey of the season. They have earned a point in three straight games for the first time in 2024-25 and, since starting the season 1-5-1, they have put forth positive efforts against quality teams like the Minnesota Wild, Boston Bruins and Florida Panthers. ""You can sense that our game is really coming,"" said speedy forward Travis Konecny, who leads the team in goals (eight) and assists (nine). ""We're playing more consistently the last four games in the style we want to play and getting better results."" The Senators have been getting better results lately, as well. After a stretch of five losses in seven games, Ottawa went on the road and defeated the Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs, allowing just two goals over the two games. Linus Ullmark made 27 saves for his first shutout of the season in Tuesday's 3-0 triumph over Toronto. ""Any time you've got a guy who's won a Vezina (Trophy), it's going to give you confidence,"" Senators coach Travis Green said. ""He was great tonight."" Tim Stutzle, Michael Amadio and Josh Norris scored for Ottawa, while Artem Zub had a pair of assists. ""I think all four lines were great. Our defensive pairings were great. We gave them no room, and that's the way we've got to play if we want to win more games,"" said Stutzle, who has a team-high 20 points, including seven goals. Ullmark knows that the Senators need to continue displaying this type of consistency if they hope to make the playoffs for the first time since 2017. ""This is the sort of the thing that you have to do every night,"" said the veteran goaltender. ""And with that comes also a lot of respect around the league. Because once you start (playing) game after game after game in this sort of manner, people are going to start noticing you and know that you're a good team and start bringing their ‘A' game and not taking you for granted, so to speak, and with that comes even more things coming your way."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

N","Going into last week's game with Utah State, the mandate was clear for Washington State: Win and hope for help. Mission accomplished on both counts. Not only did the Cougars cruise to a 49-28 decision, but enough teams ahead of them in the College Football Playoff poll lost so that they were able to climb from 21st to 18th in Tuesday night's rankings. Now Washington State needs to lather, rinse and repeat, starting with a victory Saturday night when it travels to Albuquerque for a matchup with improving New Mexico. The Cougars (8-1) did what they hoped to do last week, besides winning easily. They cranked up the running game for a season-high 303 yards and took some pressure off star quarterback John Mateer, who threw sparingly but efficiently, going 18 of 24 for 179 yards and four touchdowns. ""I feel like they played their (butts) off today,"" said Washington State receiver Kyle Williams of the offensive line. ""I feel like we can't do anything without the O-line. That's our forefront and that's who gets everything started."" Coach Jake Dickert said the ability to run the ball made things easier for Mateer and the entire team. ""Now we're second-and-3, now we're second-and-2, now we're second-and-4,"" Dickert said. ""Just having those abilities to attack in different ways, I think that opens up everything that we wanna do."" Mateer is completing 62.4 percent of his passes for 2,332 yards with 22 touchdowns and six interceptions, while also leading the team in rushing with 630 yards and 11 scores. He got help last week from freshman Wayshawn Parker, who rushed for 149 yards on just 11 attempts, including a 75-yard touchdown run to start the second half. On paper, the Cougars should enjoy another big game against the Lobos (4-6), who are allowing 38 points per game and have notched just 10 sacks. But New Mexico is 4-2 in its last six games, including a 21-16 win last week at San Diego State that kept its bowl hopes alive. For first-year coach Bronco Mendenhall, the chance to extend the season past the Nov. 30 regular-season finale at Hawaii is appealing. ""It's a big opportunity but it's also the next opportunity,"" he said. ""This is the University of New Mexico fighting for postseason eligibility against a ranked opponent -- at home -- and it's game 11. How could you downplay that? ""Now that we've acknowledged it, we just play football."" While it's gone mostly unnoticed, Lobos quarterback Devon Dampier has comparable numbers to Mateer. Dampier has thrown for 2,418 yards and 11 touchdowns while rushing for 872 yards and 13 scores. The biggest difference is that Dampier has been more mistake-prone, tossing 12 interceptions. Iowa State transfer Eli Sanders has added 834 yards and eight touchdowns on the ground, while Luke Wysong and Ryan Davis have combined for 101 caches and 1,334 yards. New Mexico is averaging 33.4 ppg. Washington State has won both previous games with the Lobos, including a 21-17 victory in 2004 in Albuquerque. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Aggies needed a well-timed bye week to recover from both setbacks and return to the field Saturday night at home to play 40-point underdog New Mexico State at College Station, Texas. Texas A&M (7-2) enters the week tied atop the Southeastern Conference with Tennessee and sits at No. 15, after dropping one spot in the latest College Football Playoff rankings that were revealed on Tuesday night. Texas A&M, which defeated New Mexico State (2-7) in its lone previous meeting in 2016, knows there is still an opportunity to both win the SEC and secure a spot in the playoffs even if they don't. But A&M is dealing with a potential game changer in Moss' injury. Moss ranks third in the conference with 765 yards and had amassed 906 yards of offense overall. Junior Amari Daniels is expected to take over the bulk of the workload with Moss out, with EJ Smith backing him up. Daniels has 466 yards and six touchdowns on 94 carries this season and Smith has 107 yards and no touchdowns on 33 carries. ""A lot of things are on the table,"" A&M coach Mike Elko said Monday. ""Obviously, losing Le'Veon is a big loss. That's a lot of touches. We're going to have to figure out the right way to handle that. I think there's a lot of different opportunities and options to go about that. Amari is certainly one. EJ is certainly one. There's other ways that we can do that."" Texas A&M's passing game has not been very effective this season despite the team's lofty status in the SEC and the national polls. Texas A&M ranks 111th in passing offense and has not surpassed 200 yards passing in six games. New Mexico State enters Saturday's game having lost back-to-back games and seven of its past eight. A major issue all season which reared its head once again last week was turnovers. New Mexico State saw an opportunity to pick up a Conference USA victory against Western Kentucky slip away when running back Mike Washington fumbled with 12:45 left in the fourth quarter, swinging the momentum toward a 41-28 Hilltoppers' victory. New Mexico State committed five turnovers overall and for the season, the Aggies rank 133rd among 134 FBS teams in turnover margin with a minus-15. ""When you turn the ball over five times, it's hard to win a football game,"" New Mexico State coach Tony Sanchez said after the game. ""That was a critical moment right there. We needed to turn the corner, and we weren't able to do it."" New Mexico State can't continue that trend if it wants to have any chance against Texas A&M, which ranks 26th in the nation in turnover margin (plus-6).  Washington and running back Seth McGowan, who have combined for 1,172 yards and nine touchdowns rushing, have been two of the bright spots for New Mexico State in an otherwise dismal season. New Mexico State enters the game in last place in Conference USA. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Both teams also have soft enough schedules to suggest a three-game winning streak is feasible. But a slide isn't out of the question for either team. ""I am excited to be the head coach of a team that has put themselves in a (good) position,"" said Illinois coach Bret Bielema. ""You always remember the ones in November. Obviously, we started off with a bump in the road against Minnesota (two weeks ago)."" ""You can only win one at a time,"" said Michigan State coach Jonathan Smith. ""We've got a lot to play for these last three games. I know our guys understand that it's not easy to win, but we have an opportunity in front of us to win more than we lose for the entirety of this season."" While Illinois held a ""limited"" practice Sunday, Michigan State went full pads to set the tone. ""I thought it was really spirited,"" Smith said. ""Good practice."" Better yet for the Spartans, starting quarterback Aidan Chiles took part in the practice. His status had not been clarified since being escorted to the locker room with a forearm injury during the third quarter of the Spartans' 47-10 loss vs. Indiana on Nov. 2. ""Aidan was able to go (Sunday),"" Smith said. ""So we feel pretty confident on him."" Chiles doesn't have the best numbers (62 percent completion rate, 1,850 yards, eight touchdowns, 11 interceptions), but his status as a two-way threat gives Michigan State the best chance to succeed against an Illinois defense that surrendered 49 points to Purdue when multi-threat backup Ryan Browne had to play for the Boilermakers. The Illinois defense will be without leading tackler Dylan Rosiek. The junior linebacker suffered a season-ending leg fracture in the Nov. 2 home loss to Minnesota. The Illini also will miss defensive back Miles Scott in the first half.

He was trying to get me to put him in the game (against UCF) in the middle of the third quarter. ""I was like, ‘No, you're not going to get suited up.' We'll see what it looks like for this week."" K-State returned to practice Monday after the bye week. ""We had a good open week last week,"" Wildcats head coach Chris Klieman said. ""We gave our older guys who have played a lot of snaps a bit of a break from a recovery standpoint. We have a number of guys who are still nursing injuries, but I believe everyone will be available Saturday."" Instead of looking back at what went wrong against Houston, Klieman said the focus is on what's still ahead. ""I think it's the daily improvement,"" he added. ""It's the big picture. What do we have to get better schematically, both offensively and defensively? It sometimes gets forgotten that we're a 7-2 football team that has a lot of things in front of us to play for. We can't control what other teams are going to do. I think everyone knows that a lot can still happen."" The teams are almost identical in terms of scoring offense, with the Sun Devils outscoring the Wildcats by .3 points per game. They both also depend heavily on the run. The Wildcats are third in the conference with 208.3 yards per game on the ground, while Arizona State is fourth at 198.0 yards per game. Defensively, K-State sits atop the rushing yards allowed list with just 99.4 yards per game. ASU is third at 118.8 yards per game. ""Anybody can beat anybody in this league,"" Klieman said. ""We're playing a really good Arizona State team that's a hot team. So we've got to play our best football."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

This week's stop for the Butterfield Bermuda Championship at Port Royal Golf Course in Bermuda begins Thursday, and our golf experts preview the event while sharing their favorite prop picks and best bets to win this week. BUTTERFIELD BERMUDA CHAMPIONSHIP Location: Southampton, Bermuda, Nov. 14-17 Course: Port Royal Golf Course (Par 71, 6,828 Yards) Purse: $6.9M (Winner: $1.242M) Defending Champion: Camilo Villegas FedEx Cup Champion: Scottie Scheffler HOW TO FOLLOW TV: Thursday-Friday: 1-4 p.m. ET; Saturday: 11:30 a.m.-2:30 p.m.; Sunday: 11 a.m.-2 p.m. (All times Golf Channel) X: @Bermuda_Champ PROP PICKS --Nico Echavarria to Beat Patrick Rodgers (-110 at DraftKings): Echavarria proved his second career PGA Tour victory was no fluke, nearly going back-to-back last week before slipping to T6. He's in as good of form as anyone grinding out these final events. Rodgers is trying to maintain his grip on entries into the first two signature events next year as he sits 55th in the standings. He's coming off a T24 at the WWT, with a best result in five fall events thus far being a T11 in Utah. --Carson Young Top 30 Finish (+110 at BetRivers): Young is up to a career-high 135th in the Official World Golf Ranking following his T2 last week. Granted, that was on the heels of a T37 and MC in his previous two events, but he did also tie for 11th in Utah. This is one of the weaker fields of the year and Young should be playing somewhat loose. At No. 86, he has secured his card for next year but is a longshot to rise into the AON Next 10. --Mark Hubbard to Make Cut (-330 at DraftKings): We made a similar play with Austin Eckroat last week and while the made cut payout wasn't attractive he did go on to win. Hubbard has made 80 percent of his cuts this year, and took a week off after a T41 in Japan. He also finished T20 in Bermuda last year while posting four rounds of 68 or better. 2024 Prop Picks Record: 52-58 BEST BETS --Seamus Power (+1600 at DraftKings) won the event in 2022, when he set the tournament record with 28 birdies.  --Maverick McNealy (+1600) is ranked 68th as he still seeks his maiden win on tour. He did post a T6 last week. He has been a popular play since opening at +1800.  --Mackenzie Hughes (+2000) is a two-time winner on tour and has posted a pair of top-10s in his only two starts this fall. His odds have lengthened since opening at +1600. --Lucas Glover (+2500) is among the most accomplished players in the field. In four fall starts so far, he has a pair of T3 finishes and two other top-25s.  --Echavarria (+3000) claimed his second tour title two weeks ago and was in contention to make it two in a row until a 71 last Sunday dropped him into a T6. Recent form has made him one of the most popular plays in the field since opening at +4000. --Matti Schmid (+3000) is coming off a missed cut last week. However, that followed a pair of top-5s and his best PGA Tour result to date was a solo third in Bermuda last year. Schmid has shifted slightly since opening at +2800. NOTES --This is the seventh of eight tournaments on the FedEx Cup Fall schedule, which finalizes the top 125 players who will retain exempt status for 2025. Nos. 126-150 after the fall will retain conditional status. Players who finished Nos. 51-70 in the FedEx Cup have secured their tour cards, but are competing for spots in the first two signature events after the season-opening The Sentry on Jan. 2-5.  --This week's field includes every player from Nos. 118-135 in the standings other than No. 130 Matt Wallace. Joel Dahmen (+6500) is among the notables battling for full status, having moved up to No. 121 with a T14 last week. Former Top 10 player Daniel Berger (+3000) has climbed to 124th with four consecutive top-40 finishes.  --Villegas' win last year was his first since 2014.  --Camiko Smith won a local qualifier to earn a sponsor exemption into the event along with fellow Bermudians Nick Jones and Eric West. None of the 14 Bermudians who have played in the event to date have made the cut, including Smith in 2020 and 2021. Each are being offered as +250000 longshots. --Miles Russell, 16, is in the field on an exemption as the Junior Player of the Year. He shot 74-70 in his PGA Tour debut at the Rocket Mortgage Classic in June.

When asked if there were consistent themes in those games, Beamer said: ""I would say they've kicked our butts, physically, just to be completely frank."" The No. 21 Gamecocks (6-3, 4-3 Southeastern Conference) hope to reverse that trend Saturday when they host the No. 23 Tigers (7-2, 3-2) in Columbia, S.C. Both teams will try to keep their longshot College Football Playoff hopes alive. South Carolina hit its stride during the stretch run, rolling to lopsided victories at Oklahoma (35-9), 44-20 over Texas A&M and at Vanderbilt (28-7). The Gamecocks are bowl-bound for the third time in Beamer's tenure and are seeking their first winning record in SEC play since 2017. ""No one else did, I realize that, but this group had very high expectations for themselves going in 2024,"" Beamer said. ""It's good to see that we've been able to accomplish a lot of things already, but there's still a lot more for us to accomplish."" In their last two games, the Gamecocks gained 982 yards of total offense while averaging 7.28 yards per play. Running back Raheim ""Rocket"" Sanders rushed for 270 yards in those games while quarterback LaNorris Sellers passed for 482 yards and four touchdowns and rushed for 144 yards and a touchdown. The Tigers rebounded from their 34-0 loss at Alabama to defeat Oklahoma, 30-23. Backup quarterback Drew Pyne played for Brady Cook, who has been sidelined by a high-ankle sprain and a wrist or hand injury on his throwing arm. Pyne completed just 14 of 23 passes for 143 yards, but he threw three touchdown passes as Missouri prevailed with just 278 yards offense. ""We have a lot of confidence in Drew, and whoever gives us the best opportunity to win is who we're going to play,"" Missouri coach Eli Drinkwitz said. ""And we won't know anything on Brady till later in the week, but ... we'll prepare for Drew to be the starter."" Beamer tried to recruit Pyne out of high school while he was an assistant at Oklahoma. Pyne went to Notre Dame, then Arizona State and Missouri instead. ""He's tough, competitive, athletic and can make throws,"" Beamer said. ""You see him get better with experience as well."" Missouri top running back Nate Noel was limited to 10 carries for 31 yards against OU due to his lingering foot injury. Jamal Roberts and Marcus Carroll carried the bulk of the workload against the Sooners, combining for 26 carries. The Tigers have suffered major hits on the offensive line. Starting center Connor Tollison suffered a season-ending knee injury against Oklahoma and right guard Cayden Green has been limited during the last two weeks by a right leg injury. Drake Heismeyer is likely to take over at center and Mitchell Walters is likely to fill in for Green. ""There's a chemistry aspect of offense that's disrupted when you know you've got the center and the quarterback that are going to be new,"" Drinkwitz said. ""But I think everybody's got to do their job, have each other's backs and know that there's going to be some issues that we've got to work through and not get too high or too low about."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

A three-game winning streak has the Buffaloes (7-2, 5-1 Big 12) in second place in the Big 12 and the subject of additional national media attention. The Buffaloes boast an explosive offense led by Shedeur Sanders, two-way star Travis Hunter, wide receiver LaJohntay Wester, and a defense that has become more physical throughout the season.  But the success is all outside noise for Colorado coach Deion Sanders, who said he's focused on the next game and not looking back at how the Buffaloes overpowered Texas Tech last week in a 41-27 victory. The defense racked up seven sacks, 11 tackles for loss, two fumble recoveries -- including Shilo Sanders' fumble recovery for a touchdown to ice the game -- and an interception. ""I never take a step back,"" Deion Sanders said. ""I take a step up. I always have my head out the window and want to see around the corner."" Because Jimmy Horn Jr. didn't play after he suffered a lower-body injury in the first half against the Red Raiders, Deion Sanders said he won't know the status of the senior wide receiver until he practices this week. Horn has 33 catches for 434 yards and a touchdown for an average of 13.2 yards per reception, ""It's going to be day-by-day,"" Deion Sanders said. ""We hope he's able to work Thursday. If he gives us a good Thursday and Friday, then he's a go."" Utah (4-5, 1-5) finds itself in an unfamiliar position near the bottom of its conference standings. The Utes moved to the Big 12 in August but were perennial Pac-12 contenders. An injury to seventh-year senior quarterback Cam Rising, who is out for the season, has Utah in danger of missing a bowl game. But the Utes looked plenty dangerous in pushing No. 6-ranked BYU to the brink last week. Freshman quarterback Isaac Wilson is questionable with an injury and sophomore Brandon Rose got his first career start in the Utes' 22-21 loss to archrival and Big 12 leader BYU in the ""Holy War."" ""Our plan was to keep Cam healthy,"" Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said. ""We didn't expect Brandon or Isaac to be thrust into the position they have been in, but that's how things played out. Given the environment and circumstances and everything he was up against Brandon did an admirable job."" Despite their record, Deion Sanders said Colorado can't overlook Utah. He said Whittingham was a ""pillar of the Pac-12 and Big 12."" He added he wished he could ""accomplish a portion"" of what the Utes' coach, who has been at the school 31 years and head coach for 20 years, has done. ""They haven't quit, they are still tough, aggressive and stout defensively,"" Deion Sanders said. ""They can still do some things that force you into some looks. You cannot take this team lightly; I don't care what their record is. As long as (Whittingham) is over there on that sideline, you better be prepared for a tough game."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

But as No. 22 LSU prepares to face Florida in an SEC game Saturday in Gainesville, Fla., the disappointing performance of the teams under both third-year coaches is dominating storylines around the programs. Speculation about Napier's possible dismissal swirled after a 1-2 start that featured home losses by 24 points to Miami and by 13 points to Texas A&M. But amid the Gators showing modest midseason improvement, athletic director Scott Stricklin said last week that the coach will remain in his position going forward. The Gators (4-5, 2-4 SEC) then went out and watched Texas take a 42-0 lead on its way to a 49-17 victory. Kelly has seven years remaining on his 10-year $100 million contract, so firing him doesn't seem feasible anytime soon, but the Tigers (6-3, 3-2) have lost two in a row, including a 42-13 embarrassment at home against Alabama last week. The game before that, they led Texas A&M 17-7 at halftime on the road before getting outscored 31-6 in the second half. The losing coach Saturday will likely endure intensifying criticism. ""I feel pretty confident we know what we are doing,"" Kelly said. ""Am I happy about what happened? No. Are our players? No. I am not in a position to worry about what people are saying about the overall health of the program."" Each of Kelly's first two teams finished with 10 victories after winning bowl games. This team will have to sweep its last three regular-season games and win a bowl to match those two. ""We have one of the top recruiting classes in the country,"" Kelly said. ""Those things are only going to continue to get better. A championship program is what we are going to have here. There are going to be some stumbles along the way, but we will get back up and we are going to keep building our program where it needs to be. And that's a championship program."" After the 1-2 start, Florida won three of its next four and the loss was a 23-17 overtime defeat at then-No. 8 Tennessee. But starting quarterback Graham Mertz suffered a season-ending torn ACL in that game and two games later, freshman DJ Lagway strained a hamstring in a loss to Georgia. Third-string quarterback Aidan Warner struggled against Texas, completing 12 of 25 passes for 132 yards. The Gators are hopeful Lagway will be available Saturday. Napier said the offense's problems against the Longhorns weren't all Warner's fault. ""I think we can play better around him,"" he said. Florida hosts No. 11 Ole Miss and visits Florida State in its final two games, has to win two of its final three games to salvage bowl eligibility. ""We've been very inconsistent,"" Napier said. ""We're getting closer. I see the light at the end of the tunnel. Obviously, I'm disappointed with Saturdays. I do think our group is trending in the right direction. We're not there yet."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

But Pierce said Wednesday that he and the Turners agree quarterback Gardner Minshew remains the starter as the Raiders (2-7) return to the field and prepare to visit the Miami Dolphins (4-6) on Sunday. ""When we brought in Gardner, we expected, obviously, the player we'd seen in the past,"" Pierce said Wednesday. ""At some point, you've got to give the guy confidence. There have been times with turnovers and other things that have taken place we made a decision to put him on the bench and go with another quarterback. This week I feel like Gardner gives us the best opportunity to move forward. He has every opportunity to go out there and help us."" Pierce said he consulted his new offensive coaching staff and reminded Minshew ""everybody around him"" believes he can get the job done, and that he just needs to ""cut it loose."" Scott Turner is expected to call plays this week for the Raiders, who are tied with the Tennessee Titans for the AFC's worst scoring margin at minus-83 points. Norv Turner joined the staff as a senior adviser. Minshew, 28, has six touchdowns, eight interceptions and five lost fumbles in eight games (seven starts) this year. A bye week provided a break for the new offensive staff to convene and paused a five-game losing streak. Las Vegas is coming off a 41-24 loss at Cincinnati in Week 9. Minshew started and completed only 10 passes for 124 yards before the Raiders turned to Desmond Ridder late in the third quarter. Ridder completed 11 of 16 passes for 74 yards with a touchdown to rookie tight end Brock Bowers and was also sacked four times. ""What do we have to lose at this point?"" Pierce asked rhetorically Wednesday. ""We're 2-7. Everything that's behind us is behind us."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Clark found herself to be the center of attention once again on Wednesday, this time playing golf alongside top-ranked Nelly Korda and tournament host Annika Sorenstam at the LPGA Tour pro-am event in Belleair, Fla. Clark, 22, was up bright and early and testing her mettle at the Pelican Golf Club, and there was a crowd estimated to be over 1,000 people following her every shot.  The Indiana Fever star and reigning WNBA Rookie of the Year appeared to have fun at every turn, providing self-deprecating humor along the way. She even did her best to put a good spin after an errant shot hit a fan on the par-3 ninth hole. ""Thanks for the good kick, whoever I hit,"" she said. For the record, Clark autographed the ball and apologized to the fan, who walked away with a story to tell.  The misfire aside, Clark brandished a smile throughout her experience on Wednesday -- a sign that perhaps she's enjoying her first offseason in quite some time. ""It's nice, but at the same time I'm still so busy,"" Clark said. ""I got to get things done that I haven't been able to do during basketball season. Everybody thinks I have a bunch of free time, but I have been busy, been doing stuff. I like to keep myself in a routine and working out, whatever it is. It's been a lot of fun and I enjoyed it."" Korda said she enjoyed her time with Clark on Wednesday, going so far as to say that it ""felt like two friends hanging out.""  Then, Korda focused on a bigger picture. ""It's just great for women's sports,"" she said. ""I love that she has a love for the game of golf. I've never really tuned in to watching basketball before her, honestly.

The Cardinals (6-3, 4-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) were off last week after beating Clemson 33-21, handing the Tigers a rare night home loss two weeks ago. That victory propelled Louisville back into the polls and into the first College Football Playoff rankings last week. The selection committee bumped the Cardinals up from No. 22 to No. 19. Louisville has won two straight since a 52-45 home loss to No. 9 Miami on Oct. 19. While the Cardinals' best football of the season has come in their last two games, Brohm told reporters Monday that the off week came at a good time for key players recuperating from injuries to recover and gain their second wind. They get back to the field and face a Cardinal (2-7, 1-5) squad reeling from six straight losses but also coming out off their bye week. Louisville is a 20.5-point favorite.  ""Anytime you have a big win, you can't have a let up, and if you do, you're going to get beat,"" Brohm said. ""That's the way college football works now. It's more prevalent now than even in years past."" One concern Brohm expressed about Stanford is its starting quarterback, Ashton Daniels. In the Cardinal's last game, a 59-28 loss at North Carolina State on Nov. 2, the junior ran for a career-high 129 yards and his first two rushing touchdowns on 11 carries. Mobile quarterbacks have posed a problem for the Louisville defense this season. Five have run for at least 50 yards, and two have gone for at least 100 yards. Daniels may get help from freshman running back Cole Tabb, who made his debut against the Wolfpack and gained 72 yards on 11 carries. Stanford coach Troy Taylor told reporters Tuesday that the 5-foot-8, 190-pound four-star recruit impressed him with his elusiveness. Stanford's defense has taken a pounding in its first season in the ACC. The Cardinal rank next-to-last, giving up 412.9 yards a game, and the 34.6-point scoring average is the league's worst. Louisville's offense, meanwhile, has big-play potential. Nationally, the offense is the 19th-best in the country, averaging 449.6 yards per game while only averaging 65.2 plays a game, making it 83rd among Football Bowl Subdivision schools. Freshman running back Isaac Brown averages 7.5 yards per carry, and Ja'Corey Brooks, a senior transfer from Alabama, ranks 13th nationally with 841 receiving yards. Both are on pace to give Louisville a 1,000-yard rusher and receiver in the same season for the fifth time in school history. Stanford defensive lineman Tobin Phillips told reporters Tuesday that Louisville's skill players have stood out this season. ""Their offensive line is long, and they do their job really well,"" Phillips said. ""But they do lean on their skill guys, so I think we have to try to take advantage of their offensive line and try to prevent as many big plays from occurring."" Defensively, Louisville expects Benjamin Perry to play on Saturday. The linebacker/safety left the Clemson game in an ambulance and wore a neck brace after trying to make a tackle in the first quarter. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Obviously, he wasn't real thrilled with that. He's taking a couple days."" An FIU transfer, James helped the Eagles score 23 of their 37 points in the second half last week. Castellanos threw for just 14 yards and rushed for minus-10. With Castellanos injured against Western Kentucky, James was 19-for-32 for 168 yards and a game-winning touchdown in the fourth quarter of a 21-20 Week 4 win. He also ran for a score. The Eagles' run game was key in their most recent victory. Kye Robichaux and Jordan McDonald combined for 331 total yards and three touchdowns. ""The line played well, the tight ends played well, the running backs ran well. It was a good day,"" O'Brien said. ""They're both big, they're downhill guys."" Led by quarterback Kevin Jennings (178.6 passer efficiency rating in ACC play) and a balanced receiving corps, the Mustangs have averaged 43 points across a six-game win streak. Their defense has allowed a conference-low 90 rushing yards per game and forced 19 turnovers, including one in seven of the last eight contests. It has added up to SMU becoming the first team to start 5-0 in conference play as a first-year program moving from the Group of Five to a power league. ""I think we've proven that we belong in the conversation,"" Lashlee said. ""I'm not going to worry about us and (rankings) right now because we've got to take care of business. ... If we don't win the next three games, we don't really have an argument."" The Mustangs have improved health-wise since the Pitt game, as starting linebacker Kobe Wilson is expected to return, and wide receiver Jake Bailey and defensive end Elijah Roberts could be game-time decisions. ""Everybody's beat up, everybody's got guys out (late in the season),"" Lashlee said. ""Who's the next man up? Guys going that aren't 100 percent, how fresh can they feel on Saturday? It's going to come down to depth and toughness."" Last season in the Fenway Bowl, which is one of just two SMU losses in its last 19 games, Jennings was 24-of-48 passing for 191 yards and a touchdown.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The 76ers, off to a 2-8 start, are also missing a third All-Star, point guard Tyrese Maxey, due to a hamstring injury. Embiid and George, signed as a free agent in the offseason, played together for the first time Tuesday night in a 111-99 home loss to the New York Knicks.  After missing the season's first nine games, Embiid played 26 minutes -- on a planned minutes restriction -- and was 2 of 11 from the field with 13 points, five assists and three rebounds. Embiid said after the game he would like to play Wednesday, but the Sixers ruled him and George out on Wednesday afternoon. Head coach Nick Nurse said Tuesday night that Embiid, 30, is still working past conditioning issues. George, 34, played in his fifth game with the 76ers after missing the season's first five games with a hyperextended left knee. He is likely to be held out of back-to-back games because of his injury history. Nurse said the 76ers hope to have more information about Maxey's possible return date by the end of the week.

Pavia filed suit against the NCAA on Friday, seeking another year of eligibility. His argument is that the two seasons he played at a junior college shouldn't be held against his eligibility because he couldn't benefit from name, image and likeness laws. Still, the judge's decision left a little wiggle room for Pavia. The judge agreed to expedite a hearing on a request for a preliminary injunction, which would allow the NCAA to state its case in court. The quarterback was hoping the court would grant him a temporary restraining order to keep the NCAA from denying him another year of eligibility. With one more season, he could gain an NIL deal from Vanderbilt or enter the transfer portal when it opens Dec. 9. Pavia started his career at the New Mexico Military Institute in 2020 and helped the team to the NJCAA National Championship in 2021. He played at New Mexico State (2022-23) before transferring to Vanderbilt this season. ""Given that Plaintiff has almost certainly been aware of the challenged bylaws and his ineligibility to play college football in the 2025-26 season for quite some time and has been discussing possible resolution with the NCAA, the Court is not persuaded that an ex parte order is justified,"" William Campbell Jr., chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, wrote in his ruling, per ESPN. ""This is particularly the case here where the Plaintiff seeks prospective injunctive relief, not merely preservation of the status quo."" Per ESPN, Pavia contends in the case that junior college transfers are subject to eligibility restrictions that ""are not placed on athletes who choose to delay entry to a Division I NCAA college to attend prep school, serve in the military, or even to compete professionally in another sport."" With Pavia at quarterback, the Commodores are 6-4 -- their first six-win season since 2018 and only their third since 2014. Their signature win of the season came Oct. 5 when they knocked off then-No. 1 Alabama 40-35. Their schedule also includes a pair of three-point losses to then-No. 7 Missouri on Sept.. 21 and to then-No. 5 Texas on Oct. 26. They have two more ranked teams on the schedule to end the season -- No. 22 LSU in Baton Rouge, La., on Nov. 23 and No. 7 Tennessee at home the following Saturday. On the season, Pavia has completed 60.6 percent of his passes for 1,843 yards with 15 touchdowns and three interceptions. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Even more, the 12-0 Cavaliers may catch a break Wednesday night when they visit the scuffling Philadelphia 76ers.  Not only did Cleveland rest Tuesday while Philadelphia lost to the New York Knicks 111-99, but the Sixers will be shorthanded on Wednesday.  How shorthanded remains to be seen. The Sixers definitely will be without Tyrese Maxey (hamstring injury) and Philadelphia waited until gameday to rule out Joel Embiid (knee) and Paul George (knee) due to injury maintenance.  Embiid made his season debut Tuesday in the loss to New York, while George has played in the last five games after missing the first five. Making good on his preseason statement he would be ""done"" with back-to-backs, Embiid is sitting with George right next to him as Philadelphia takes on the soaring Cavaliers.  ""We're doing it in various ways,"" said star guard Donovan Mitchell, who leads Cleveland in scoring with an average of 23.7 points a game. ""We're doing it in a way where we are blowing out teams. We're winning from behind. We're winning close games. And it's somebody different every night."" Mitchell was the primary star for the Cavaliers in Monday's 119-113 road win over the Chicago Bulls. He scored 36 points and shot 7 of 16 from 3-point range, and five teammates scored in double figures. The Cavaliers are the eighth team in NBA history to start the season 12-0 or better. The last team to go undefeated in its first dozen games was the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors, who went 24-0 en route to a league-record 73-win campaign. ""Great stat. I didn't know that,"" Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson said about his team. ""We're going to celebrate that. Being in the league 17 years, you have good starts and you have bad starts. But to have a great start like this is unique and something to celebrate."" The Sixers are trying to find reasons to celebrate this season. At 2-8, there was no instant impact felt with Embiid on the floor Tuesday. He shot just 2 of 11 from the field for 13 points and grabbed only three rebounds in 26 minutes. ""A little rusty. A little bit of conditioning (concerns) showed up fairly early,"" said Sixers coach Nick Nurse, noting that those issues were anticipated. Embiid said Tuesday night that he wanted to suit up again against the Cavs. ""I feel good right now, but I'll see. It's up to them,"" Embiid said. Embiid's teammates will be excited to see him on the court again. Rookie guard Jared McCain had a productive night playing alongside him Tuesday, when he registered 23 points for his second straight effort of at least 20 points. ""It's pretty easy playing with him,"" McCain said, while George noted that ""you just see how much (Embiid) demands eyes and attention on him"" after the perennial All-Stars played their first game together. Even without the All-Star duo, Mitchell and the Cavaliers will be ready for Philadelphia. ""We're going to get teams' best shots,"" Mitchell said. ""We're going to get tested early. I have no doubt we will.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The league said it has signed on with Mediapro North America to convert a nearly 130,000 square-foot space into an all-purpose building with a court and training facility with room for childcare and content creation, as well as a fan zone and office space. The Miami Herald reported the facility is located in Medley. That area is northwest of downtown Miami and about 8 miles from Miami International Airport. The fledgling league, created by WNBA stars Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier, will provide WNBA players with a place to play at a lucrative wage to keep them being forced to play overseas in the offseason to supplement their incomes. The Herald said the average salary reportedly is $200,000, plus equity in the league, for 36 players. Rookie of the Year Caitlin Clark of the Indiana Fever is weighing an offer of $1 million to take one of the few remaining spots, Sports Business Journal reported. With a media-rights deal in hand from TNT Sports, the league -- at least at the outset -- apparently will rely on that revenue instead of money from ticket sales in a larger venue to pay the bills. It was unclear whether this facility will be the league's permanent home after the first year. ""We're excited to partner with Mediapro North America and usher in a new era of women's basketball, complemented by an unparalleled player and fan experience,"" Unrivaled president Alex Bazzell said in a statement.

""I had an opportunity, two opportunities, to change teams,"" Perez said in an interview with GQ, without disclosing which teams approached him. ""When I looked at it, I thought, I really love the challenge I have at Red Bull. ""It's a massive challenge being Max's teammate. It's a challenge that basically trains you for all of it.

Team principal Christian Horner has been openly critical of Perez's form this season, while others have called for Red Bull to replace the 34-year-old driver next season. Multiple names have been tied to various rumors, including young drivers Liam Lawson and Franco Colapinto. The six-time F1 race winner said he isn't bothered by the rumors, which come with being an F1 driver. ""It's how the sport is.

""It's obviously a big decision. It's not taken lightly. We're still running the same type of verbiage,"" Eberflus said Wednesday. ""My decision, I've always used council -- meeting with (GM) Ryan (Poles) on Wednesday. But my decision."" When asked about any assurances he received about job security in the meeting with Poles and chairman George McCaskey, Eberflus said, ""You know what? We weren't talking about that. We were talking about solutions going forward."" With a 14-29 overall record and 0-4 mark against this week's opponent, the Green Bay Packers, Eberflus clearly felt the urgency of the situation one week after saying no change was coming at offensive coordinator.  Eberflus said players told him they want to ""do more"" as a group and individually and shared their frustration with him before he shared his decision to fire Waldron on Tuesday morning. Waldron spent the previous three seasons with the Seattle Seahawks and was hired to replace Luke Getsy, who was fired by the Bears at the end of the 2023 regular season. Saying it was because the offense ""struggled the last three weeks,"" Eberflus said there was no choice but to find a way to get better. He said getting playmakers in the open field was a persistent problem and credited quarterback Caleb Williams for making plays, but called on the rookie to become more consistent.  Williams hasn't thrown a TD pass during the current three-game losing streak and the Bears have allowed 15 sacks while scoring 12 points in the past two games. To get there, Eberflus said there is only one path for Williams' improvement: live reps. ""Caleb has been confident throughout this whole process. You have to have confidence in your abilities,"" Eberflus said. ""You have to have confidence in what you can do. I think that's important."" Brown failed to spark confidence or generate points with his last rookie No. 1 pick at the position, Bryce Young, when he was promoted to the play-caller role in 2023 with the Carolina Panthers.  But Eberflus said Brown was the best option ""in the building,"" noting the change at coordinator was too significant to look outside Halas Hall.  ""We want efficient, effective offense. The run game, the screen game, play-action pass, dropback pass, A to Z,"" Eberflus said.  ""What I'm looking for in the offense is creativity. Getting the guys open, it takes creativity.

The Fighting Irish (8-1) have a seven-game winning streak since their two-point loss to Northern Illinois on Sept. 7 and won all four previous meetings with the Cavaliers (5-4).   Notre Dame improved to 4-0 this season against Virginia's fellow Atlantic Coast Conference members with a 52-3 rout of Florida State last weekend, having also defeated once-ranked Louisville, Georgia Tech and Stanford.   Riley Leonard passed for 215 yards and a touchdown and ran for 70 yards and two scores against the Seminoles. The balanced Fighting Irish offense had more than 200 rushing yards and 200 passing yards for the third time in the last four games. The defense collected eight sacks and two additional tackles for loss and finished the blowout with a 79-yard pick-six by Luke Talich.   Leonard posted similar numbers the last time he faced Virginia. Playing for Duke in 2022, he threw one touchdown pass and rushed for two scores in a 38-17 defeat of the Cavaliers.   Virginia snapped a three-game skid last weekend with a 24-19 victory at then-No. 18 Pittsburgh. Xavier Brown had a 1-yard touchdown run and a 24-yard touchdown catch and former Notre Dame wideout Chris Tyree had his best game as a Cavalier with four catches for 42 yards and one run for 13 yards.   ""I'm excited to go back,"" said Tyree, a graduate transfer who gained 3,284 all-purpose yards with 17 touchdowns in 49 games with the Fighting Irish from 2020-23.   Tyree's fourth-quarter catch of 25 yards on third-and-15 allowed Virginia to extend a drive that consumed 8:26 and led to a field goal for the final margin.   ""I think this is a really good start for us to finish these last four games,"" Tyree said. ""So it's just up to us to go 1-0 every week, take it day by day.""

The evolving storylines heading into Week 12 include a former favorite to win it all in danger of missing the field, Nick Saban’s continued influence on the playoff even in retirement, and the intriguing race for the fifth automatic bid. Through the second week of rankings, the expanded playoff looks like an SEC vs. Big Ten invitational. The two leagues combine for eight of the 12 spots—four apiece—while no other conference has more than one. The ACC has Miami in the field despite the Hurricanes' Week 11 loss to Georgia Tech, and independent Notre Dame plays a schedule heavy on ACC competition as part of the Fighting Irish’s membership in the league for other sports.  This was very much the plan of both Big Ten and SEC brass when enacting aggressive expansion plans in recent years, and it’s perhaps fitting that the top-ranked teams representing each conference are newcomers. Texas sits in one of the coveted top-four spots as the SEC championship representative, and Oregon is again No. 1 overall as the Big Ten representative. Not included among the quartet of SEC teams currently in the field is overwhelming preseason favorite Georgia—and with good reason. Ole Miss deservedly jumped the Bulldogs on the strength of its head-to-head win in Week 11, but just as significant is how lopsided the 28-10 contest played out. Against Ole Miss, for a half at Alabama, and in lackluster wins over struggling conference opponents Kentucky and Mississippi State, Georgia has not looked like a national championship contender. Quality wins over Clemson and Texas keep the Bulldogs in striking distance at No. 12 overall and as the first team out. However, the stakes for Week 12 and Tennessee’s visit Between The Hedges could not be higher. A win gets Georgia back into the field, and presumably into a first-round home game. Another loss may not eliminate the Bulldogs entirely from consideration—but it should. SMU is undefeated in the ACC with a Top 25 win—the same Top 25 win Miami (of the ACC) boasts, against Louisville. The Mustangs' sole loss came to Big 12-leading BYU, which remained in the field after its incredible comeback and one-point win over rival Utah. Miami’s loss, meanwhile, came against unranked Georgia Tech. Warde Manuel, addressing reporters on behalf of the selection committee, said that they “looked at their body of work as it relates to who they played and how they played those games during the season.” In other words, how SMU has won matters, and it’s weighed alongside how they’ve played. The same is true of Boise State, which Manuel cited specifically at No. 13 after having squeaked by a struggling Nevada team by seven points. Coincidentally, SMU eked out a five-point win over Nevada back in Week 1. With the exception of an overtime win over Duke and a 34-27 defeat of Louisville—the same margin of victory against the Cardinals as Miami had—SMU has generally controlled its games. “We've been impressed by both,” Manuel said when comparing SMU and Miami. “Just based on their body of work, the committee had the discussions, and the feeling was that Miami was ahead of SMU in terms of their performance this year.” The good news for the Mustangs is that if they continue to win, they’ll get the opportunity to take the decision out of the subjective opinions of the committee and any influence program prestige might have. Boise State’s only loss this season is to No. 1-ranked Oregon, and it came down to the wire. The Broncos also dominated in their sole Top 25 win, a 45-24 rout of No. 18 Washington State. But with no other Mountain West Conference teams ranked in the Top 25, Boise State may not have an opportunity to add another resume-building win to bolster its current position as the last team in the field. In fact, the Broncos are in a precarious spot as it stands, competing for the fifth automatic bid for conference champions. No. 24-ranked Army has eighth-ranked Notre Dame coming up on Nov. 23, as well as a potential American Athletic Conference championship matchup with Tulane, which debuted at No. 25. In a scenario where Army upsets Notre Dame and wins the AAC title against a ranked Tulane team, could the Cadets jump the Broncos as the fifth-highest ranked conference champion? It doesn’t seem out of the realm of possibility. While focusing primarily on winning out, Boise State fans might also become vocal supporters of Oregon and Washington State to maintain their place—and for UNLV to win out and potentially crack the Top 25 for a ranked Mountain West championship rematch. It’s unlikely the matchups we see five weeks from now will resemble those set up in the final bracket. That said, a first-round pairing of Alabama and Indiana would be a fun matchup that makes Nick Saban’s presence felt even in retirement. The coaching luminary restored Alabama to prominence during his tenure, along the way providing springboards for other head coaches. One of them is Indiana’s Curt Cignetti, although Cignetti took a unique route. A member of Saban’s initial Alabama staff, Cignetti took the head-coaching job at Indiana... of Pennsylvania, a Division II program, in 2011. From there, he had immediate success at Elon and James Madison, and now has the perennially downtrodden Indiana on the cusp of an improbable Playoff berth. Cignetti stepped into a much different position when taking over at a longtime bottom feeder than Kalen DeBoer did at Alabama. Succeeding arguably the greatest coach of all time is no easy task, and this hasn’t been an entirely smooth debut season for DeBoer, a coach who, like Cignetti, has small-school credentials from his tenure at former NAIA school Sioux Falls. But the Crimson Tide are on course for a Playoff berth, and the contrast in facing off with Indiana would make for a fun matchup with Saban’s fingerprints all over it. Copyright 2024"

The fight was rescheduled from July 20 because Tyson had an ulcer flare-up in late May. Paul, the YouTube star turned professional boxer, enters the fight with a 10-1 record that includes seven knockouts. The most recent was a sixth-round TKO of Mike Perry, who filled in for Tyson in July.  Meanwhile, Tyson (50-6, 44 KOs) will fight professionally for the first time since losing to Kevin McBride in 2005. The former undisputed heavyweight champion from 1987-90, Tyson began his career with 19 consecutive wins by knockout, with 12 coming in the first round. Friday will mark Tyson's first bout since an exhibition in November 2020. The Tyson-Paul bout will consist of eight two-minute rounds, instead of the regulation three-minute rounds. Also, each fighter will use 14-ounce gloves instead of the standard 10 ounces to limit punching power. Paul is the heavy favorite at most sportsbooks. That includes DraftKings, where he has been backed by 64 percent of the money at -275. Tyson has drawn 66 percent of the total bets at +210, with the book setting the Over/Under for total rounds at 5.5. Tyson has been the more popular play at BetMGM, where his odds have shifted from +275 to +188 while being backed by 59 percent of the bets and 76 percent of the money. Meanwhile, Paul's odds have shifted from -275 to -190 since the market opened. The most popular prop has been a Tyson win by KO/TKO or disqualification at +250, followed by a Tyson win on points at +1100. ""Bettors want to see Paul get knocked out and love Tyson as an underdog,"" Rella said. ""The book will be rooting for Paul to win."" The most-bet fight in BetMGM history was Gervonta Davis' win by TKO over Ryan Garcia in April 2023, followed by Paul's unanimous decision victory over Nate Diaz in August of that year. Paul has six of the top 25 most-bet boxing matches in the book's history. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Crimson Tide (7-2) welcome Mercer on Saturday afternoon in Tuscaloosa, Ala. Even if Alabama doesn't find a way into the Southeastern Conference title game, an at-large playoff berth is in play if the Crimson Tide can do their part and avoid any slip-ups against Mercer (9-1) and their final two opponents -- Oklahoma and Auburn. ""I like the progress that we've had. Every week's a new challenge in different ways,"" Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer said Monday. ""Last week just with the passing game and kind of the way we felt they would attack us, rising to the challenge was big. The shutout the week before happened as a combination of stopping the run and the pass, different quarterbacks in and out, but that's progress."" Alabama's defense put together a superb game in a 42-13 victory at LSU last week. The Crimson Tide allowed the Tigers' potent passing game only 239 yards and picked off quarterback Garrett Nussmeier twice. But that unit took a huge hit, however, as edge rusher Que Robinson is out for the season with a left arm injury he suffered in the second half. ""Just a special, special person in every way,"" DeBoer said. ""You hate to see a guy that pours so much into it go through what he's going through."" Alabama is likely to lean on Qua Russaw and Yhonzae Pierre more at the position, and linebacker Jihaad Campbell could see more snaps from the edge as well. Crimson Tide quarterback Jalen Milroe also had one of his best games of the season, rushing for 185 yards and four touchdowns while also passing for 109 yards on 12 of 18 attempts. Alabama ran for 312 yards and six touchdowns overall. Mercer is ranked ninth in the latest FCS Coaches poll and has won its past three games.   Mercer is coming off a 34-0 victory over VMI, which secured an automatic FCS playoff berth and a share of the Southern Conference championship. If Mercer beats Furman in two weeks, it can lock up its first outright conference title since 1932. ""It's just a testament to their hard work. It's a testament to their daily grind, and I'm really proud of that,"" Mercer coach Mike Jacobs said Monday. ""Any time you do something, one, for the first time, and two, for the second time in 100 years, it's a pretty big deal. So, I'm just really proud of the kids."" Mercer has had success throughout the season on the ground led by running back Dwayne McGee (910 yards, seven touchdowns). Brayden Manley (7.5 sacks) and T.J. Moore and Myles Redding (6 INTs each) have propelled the Bears' defense. Jacobs grasps the daunting challenge of facing Alabama and the opportunity a game like it presents for his improving program. ""We know we're up against probably one of the best teams in college football this weekend, and certainly one with a huge and rich football tradition,"" Jacobs said. ""I think it's a great opportunity for [the team] to have a chance to prove themselves, to play well, and represent Mercer on a national stage."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

No. 12 Georgia enters uncharted territory and leans into head coach Kirby Smart's history of avoiding consecutive losses with No. 7 Tennessee coming to Athens, Ga., on Saturday night for what amounts to a playoff elimination game. Georgia (7-2, 5-2 SEC) is coming off a 28-10 loss at then-No. 16 Ole Miss. The Bulldogs fell to a non-Alabama team for the first time since 2020, which was also the last time the Bulldogs had two losses in a season. Looking to avoid a second straight defeat for the first time since Smart's debut season in 2016, Georgia's current ranking places them outside of the 12-team playoff bracket. That's because No. 13 Boise State would be the 12th team in the field as it stands as the fifth-best conference champion.  Winning the final three games on the schedule would likely be enough for Georgia to fit into the field of 12. The Bulldogs fell nine spots in Tuesday's CFP rankings and at No. 12, hold the lowest ranking entering a game since they were No. 13 in November 2020. The Volunteers (8-1, 5-1) enter on a conference-best, four-game game winning streak and beat common opponent Alabama, 24-17. The Crimson Tide outlasted Georgia 41-34 on Sept. 28. Georgia hasn't lost to Tennessee since 2016. Volunteers' quarterback Josh Dobbs connected on a 43-yard Hail Mary as time expired for a 34-31 shocker.  If the Bulldogs are going to beat Tennessee for an eighth straight time, they'll need more from quarterback Carson Beck. After a 24-touchdown, six-interception season in 2023, Beck entered this season among the preseason Heisman Trophy favorites, but the fifth-year senior's campaign has left much to be desired. In Saturday's loss at Ole Miss, Beck threw for 186 yards and an interception while fumbling twice. Beck is now tied with an FBS-most 12 picks on the season, including nine in his last four games. Despite the underwhelming numbers, Smart won't entertain the idea of making a change under center. ""Absolutely not,"" Smart said. ""We've got the quarterback we've got who is completely competent, capable and understanding of our system that gives us the best chance to win."" Georgia's 10 points represent their lowest output since Week 1 of 2021, when they beat Clemson 10-3. Smart knows his offense will have to step up against a Tennessee defense that allows just 12.6 points per game -- fifth fewest in the country. ""(Tennessee) is playing defense at an extremely high level,"" Smart said. ""They get after people with four guys rushing. They platoon a lot of guys. They've got elite rushers on the edge, which we all know about, but nobody talks about how hard they play internally."" The Volunteers' defense has yet to allow 20 points in a game, its most coming in its only loss, a 19-14 defeat at Arkansas on Oct. 5. Since that upset, Tennessee has smothered opposing offenses, most recently holding Mississippi State to 271 total yards in a 33-14 victory. Offensively, quarterback Nico Iamaleava threw for 174 yards and two touchdowns before exiting in the second quarter with an upper-body injury. Volunteers' head coach Josh Heupel is confident that the sophomore will be good to go. ""I feel like he'll be in great shape for Saturday. ... I certainly feel like he'll be in a good spot,"" Heupel said. With Tennessee eyeing its first-ever CFP appearance, Heupel understands his team will have to earn a season-defining win. ""Obviously getting ready to go play a great opponent,"" Heupel added. ""You look at them really in every phase of the football game, extremely talented, coached extremely well. They play hard. They play fundamentally sound. They make you earn it in every way. ... In these games, you've got to do ordinary things at a really high level consistently. For us, that means you've got to prepare at an elite level. You've got to practice really well and put yourself in a position to go play good football."" Georgia beat Tennessee 38-10 last season, and leads the all-time series record 28-23-2. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Rory McIlroy isn't one of them. Speaking Wednesday before the start of the season-ending DP World Tour Championship in Dubai, where he can capture a third straight Race to Dubai title this weekend, McIlroy said he left unfinished business on the course in 2024. And that starts with the U.S. Open at Pinehurst in June, where two missed short putts on the final three holes left him as the runner-up to Bryson DeChambeau. McIlroy, a 35-year-old from Northern Ireland, was seeking his first win in a major since 2014. In looking back at his season, he saw good and bad -- consistency and missed opportunities. ""Yeah, incredibly consistent again. I think I've been really proud of that over the last few years,"" he said at Jumeirah Golf Estates in Dubai. ""But then at the same time, you know, thinking about the ones that got away.  ""I could be sitting up here with a fifth major title and I am not. So that stings and that's something that I have to come to terms with but at the same time I've got plenty more opportunities in the future."" He continued: ""You know, did I achieve every goal I set for myself this year? Probably not. But I still consider it a successful season."" McIlroy sits third in the world rankings, and there's no doubt part of his drive for 2025 will be to reach the heights set by No. 1 Scottie Scheffler and No. 2 Xander Schauffele this season. ""You've got two guys at the top of the world rankings down there winning two majors,"" he said. ""You know, Scottie winning a Masters and a Players and the Olympics. They certainly separated themselves from the pack this year. I'm obviously very aware of that, and it only makes me more motivated to try to emulate what they did this year."" McIlroy will be more selective about the events he plays in the United States next year. He has said he intends to cut down on his schedule and could skip some of the PGA Tour's signature events, but he assured reporters in the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday that he wants to continue playing on the DP World Tour. ""I think I'm not going to miss these tournaments in the Middle East. I'm not going to miss Wentworth. I'm not going to miss the Irish Open. I'm not going to miss The Scottish Open,"" he said. ""But there was a few events this year in America that I played that I don't typically play, and I think that's where I'm going to have to trim a little bit. ... I have to remember, I'm 35 now. I'm not 23."" He has spent half his life as a pro golfer. ""At 35, and I've been on tour for 17 or 18 years, look, I'm not slowing down at all,"" he said. ""But I just have to take care of myself and take care of my body a little bit more, and 27 events this year is maybe a touch too many. If I can trim it back down to 22 or 23, I think that would be good for me in the long run."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Boise State (8-1) projects as the final team in the 12-team College Football Playoff but the Broncos have no margin for error.  Boise State remains atop the Mountain West standings and its only loss was to No. 1 Oregon. The Broncos would be the 12th seed as an automatic qualifier and the fifth-best conference champ based on the second iteration of rankings revealed Tuesday. While there's no celebrating in Idaho yet, BSU has plenty of reason to plan a party.  Broncos running back Ashton Jeanty is a Heisman front-runner with 1,734 yards and 23 touchdowns. He is 895 yards away from Barry Sanders' single-season college record set in 1988 with three regular-season games left. The Spartans' defense ranks 75th in the nation against the run but is only allowing 3.65 yards per carry (Jeanty averages 7.7). Last year, Jeanty ran for 162 yards in a 35-27 win for Boise State. While the spotlight this year has been on Jeanty, the nation's leading receiver is a Spartan. Senior Nick Nash leads the nation in receptions (86), receiving yards (1,156) and touchdown catches (13).  ""He's big-time,"" said Boise State coach Spencer Danielson. ""He's strong. He will go up and make catches. I remember when he was their backup running quarterback. He's a matchup nightmare for defenses and I see him as being one of the heartbeats of their team."" Boise State sophomore quarterback Maddux Madsen has thrown for 18 touchdowns, but he only completed 9 of 20 passes against Nevada for 119 yards and an interception. Quarterback play going forward could be the key to how far the Broncos go if and when they reach the playoffs. ""Just like anything else, there will be fundamentals and reads that he needs to get fixed and he will,"" said Danielson. ""There are a lot of things on film that I am proud of and there are a lot of things on film that I know he needs to improve on. No one is going to want to do it more than Maddux.""  The Spartans (6-3) have used two quarterbacks this season: Emmett Brown and Walker Eget. Brown has thrown for 1,621 yards and 16 touchdowns, while Eget has thrown for 1,312 yards, but six interceptions.  ""Both of them run the offense very efficiently,"" said Danielson. ""I can respect offenses who know what they are, but will attack you. They are going to run their stuff. They know how to adjust to coverages so there will always be open receivers. They run their run plays and pass concepts trying to attack the defense."" Defensively, San Jose State is led by linebacker Jordan Pollard, who has recorded 82 tackles and 9.5 tackles for loss. Spartans coach Ken Niumatalolo was reprimanded by the conference for his remarks about the officiating after his team's win over Oregon State. Niumatalolo was dismayed over defensive penalties on a late drive by the Beavers. ""I've been doing this a long time, and that was tough because we felt like we were playing more than 11 people out there,"" Niumatalolo said after the win. ""Some of the calls at the end, I don't have any words for them."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Two weeks after Shane Steichen told reporters that Joe Flacco will serve as the team's starting quarterback ""going forward,"" the head coach reversed course on Wednesday. Steichen tapped Richardson to be under center against the New York Jets on Sunday and for the remainder of the season.  Steichen said that while he talked to owner Jim Irsay and general manager Chris Ballard, ultimately it was his decision to return Richardson to the starting role.  ""We made it very clear to him that he's our starting quarterback going forward.""  Steichen also said he was pleased with what he saw from Richardson over the last two weeks. ""It's the attention to detail in everything he does,"" Steichen said. ""It's got to be a higher standard. Over the last two weeks, he's made strides in those areas."" With Flacco at the controls, the Colts (4-6) saw their losing skid extend to three games following setbacks to the Minnesota Vikings and Buffalo Bills. The 39-year-old committed six turnovers (four interceptions, two fumbles) in the last two contests. Flacco was inserted into the starting lineup one week after Richardson completed only 10 of 32 passes (31.3 percent) for 175 yards with one touchdown and one interception in a 23-20 loss to the Houston Texans on Oct. 27. During the third quarter of that game, Richardson made the unusual move of taking himself out of the game in the middle of a Colts drive. The 22-year-old later explained that he needed a breather after scrambling on several plays. Richardson, who missed Weeks 5 and 6 with an oblique injury, has completed only 44.4 percent of his passes for 958 yards with four TDs and seven interceptions in six games this season. Drafted No. 4 overall in 2023 out of Florida, Richardson's rookie season ended after just four games due to a shoulder injury that required surgery. Flacco has completed 66.5 percent of his passes this season for 1,167 yards with nine touchdowns and five interceptions. Flacco is 104-85 as an NFL starter with the Baltimore Ravens (2008-18), Denver Broncos (2019), New York Jets (2020-22), Cleveland Browns (2023) and Colts. He has thrown for 45,103 yards with 254 TDs and 160 INTs. He was the MVP of Baltimore's 34-31 win against the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Nittany Lions (8-1, 5-1 Big Ten) are No. 4 in the latest College Football Playoff rankings despite a 20-13 loss to then-No. 4 Ohio State on Nov. 2. Penn State rebounded from that defeat to roll past Washington 35-6 last weekend -- a performance highlighted by Tyler Warren's two touchdowns. ""Obviously you can see how many ways we got him the ball today, run-game wise, pass-game wise and even some of our option stuff,"" Penn State quarterback Drew Allar said after the win over the Huskies. ""We just try to get him the ball in the game plan as much as we can."" Warren, a senior tight end, leads the Nittany Lions with 59 catches -- nobody else on the team has more than 29 -- and is tied for the team lead with four receiving TDs. He also has three rushing scores and is averaging 7.2 yards per carry on 13 attempts. ""I can't see how this guy doesn't win the Mackey Award and the Paul Hornung Award,"" Penn State coach James Franklin said of the honors for tight ends and the most versatile player in major college football. ""And they'd be proud of that guy representing their award because he does everything right, both on and off the field."" Meanwhile, Allar has completed 70.3 percent of his passes this season. He has steady options in the backfield in Kaytron Allen, who ran for 98 yards and a touchdown against Washington and has scored in five of the last six games, as well as Nick Singleton, who has averaged 6.2 yards per carry this year. The Nittany Lions hope to ride their balanced offensive attack to a deep playoff run. ""We value winning,"" Franklin said, ""and if you watch college football all over the country, it's hard to win on a consistent basis."" Franklin certainly would get agreement on that from Purdue (1-8, 0-6), which has lost every game since defeating Indiana State 49-0 in its season opener. The Boilermakers have faced two highly ranked opponents this season, falling to Oregon and Ohio State -- both ranked No. 2 in the AP poll at the time -- by a combined score of 80-0. ""There's a multitude of reasons, a multitude of examples to point to as to why we are struggling with those types of opponents,"" Purdue coach Ryan Walters said. ""We'll just continue to work on them.""  In last weekend's 45-0 setback to the Buckeyes, the Boilermakers managed just 206 yards from scrimmage and went a combined 2 of 15 on third and fourth downs. Hudson Card completed only 9 of 19 passes for 108 yards with an interception for Purdue, while Devin Mockobee was a rare bright spot with 73 yards on 13 carries. ""The bottom line is alignment, assignment, execution on both sides of the ball,"" Mockobee said. ""That's just something we still are continuing to work on improving, tightening up.

Prediction: 1 year, $2 million minor-league deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Also in the running: the rest of MLB.  Surprise! Sasaki would have made more money (like Yoshinobu Yamamoto did a year ago) had the Chiba Lotte Marines of NPB waited two more years to post him at age 25. Instead, the Marines obliged his wishes, so Sasaki will come to MLB but be subject to the same international free agent limitations that Ohtani was when he signed with the Angels in the 2017-2018 offseason. That puts Sasaki in every team's price range, and there will be a big demand for a 23-year-old who throws 96.9 mph and features a top-shelf split-finger fastball.  Prediction: 6 years, $225 million with the Baltimore Orioles. Also in the running: Red Sox, Mets. Burnes posted a 2.92 ERA with 181 strikeouts in 194 1/3 innings and has made at least 32 starts for three straight seasons. Having turned 30, Burnes gives indications he could be in decline, notably a decreased K% for a fourth straight season and diminishing returns on his cutter. No matter, he will bring a salivating market of suitors, and O's owner David Rubenstein needs to make a splash. Prediction: 7 years, $176 million with the Detroit Tigers. Also in the running: Astros, Cubs. Bregman batted .260/.315/.453 with a Gold Glove at third base. While not sexy results at the plate, Bregman's hitting was on par with his past five seasons, and he ranked 40-50 among all hitters in 2024. Prediction: 5 years, $155 million with the New York Mets.Snell finished with solid results (3.12 ERA with 150 K's in 104 IP), despite signing late in free agency and missing several starts with minor injuries. Batters made weak contact against him (.263 slugging, 86 mph average exit velocity), and Snell had the best K% of his career (34.7%).  Prediction: 4 years, $125 million with the Braves. Also in the running: Yankees, Padres, Mets.  One of the 9-10 best starters in the league since 2019, he isn't huge with strikeouts, but he does keep the ball in the park. Had a forearm strain in 2023 but posted a 3.25 ERA in 29 starts in '24 at age 30. The Braves don't typically pay top dollar, but they also can't afford to let Fried walk. Prediction: 6 years, $155 million with the Dodgers. Also in the mix: Giants, Braves.  Slugged .255/.331/.462 with 32 homers and 21 steals in 161 games for the Brewers. He showed a drop in his defensive metrics in '24 and might have to move to third base within 2-3 seasons. Prediction: 6 years, $180 million with the Yankees. Also in the mix: Mets, Giants, Astros. If they can't land Soto, the Yankees will take from the Mets. At age 29, hit .240/.329/.459 with 34 homers—the fewest of his career. Posted the weakest isolated power (.219) of his career, and the highest ground-ball rate (42%). One of the five best hitters at his position since 2019, but is closer in value to Rhys Hoskins than top dog Freddie Freeman.  Prediction: 4 years, $100 million with the Giants. Also in the mix: Angels, Padres, Yankees.   Coming off years of arm trouble, Flaherty posted his best results since 2019, making 28 starts and finishing with a 3.17 ERA to go with 194 strikeouts in 162 innings. His K% dropped in the second half, and he had mixed results in the postseason.  Prediction: 5 years, $100 million with the Royals. Also in pursuit: Blue Jays, Yankees, Giants, Phillies.  Switch-hitter who posted a .235/.308/.506 line with 44 homers in 2024, doing equally well from both sides. His career K% is better than league average by 2 percent. He played a lot of right field at age 29, but he was mediocre on defense. Copyright 2024"

Miami then was upset by Georgia Tech, and so the Hurricanes and Tigers are tied with one loss each in Atlantic Coast Conference play as mid-November approaches. As the Tigers (7-2, 6-1) travel to Pittsburgh this weekend, a Clemson berth in the ACC title game is still possible, which means an automatic berth in the 12-team CFP remains attainable.  SMU stands alone in first place in the conference with a 5-0 recodr. ""We've talked about how great it would be to get to 7-1 (in ACC play). That's the best we can finish at this point, so that's what we can control,"" Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said this week. ""We're still in the thick of it. We don't control what other teams are doing, but we focus on what we can control."" Clemson scored a 24-14 win at Virginia Tech last week. Tigers quarterback Cade Klubnik threw for 211 yards and three touchdowns, while Phil Mafah rushed for 128 yards on 26 carries. But Swinney was especially frustrated with Klubnik holding the ball too long and taking unnecessary sacks.  ""Just stuff that we needed him to do as a quarterback and decisions. He took four sacks, every sack was on him, and none of them should have happened,"" Swinney said. ""He just tried to do a little too much a couple times, just frustrating, (and) was a couple of plays there that we didn't pull the trigger on."" The quarterback position also is concerning for Pitt (7-2, 3-2), which started the season with seven consecutive wins but has back-to-back losses, dropping out of the playoff rankings this week.  Redshirt freshman QB Eli Holstein, a transfer from Alabama, left in the third quarter of a 24-19 loss to Virginia on Saturday with an apparent head injury. Holstein was hit while sliding on a second-and-4 scramble, and Cavaliers linebacker Trey McDonald was ejected for targeting on the play. When asked about Holstein's status for the Clemson game, Pitt coach Patt Narduzzi was non-committal. ""Our doctors make all those decisions,"" he said. ""I wish I could tell you. I don't even go down to the training room to see. I stay out of the training room. That's not my job. My job is to coach football and let some of the best medical trainers in the country take care of (it)."" If Holstein is sidelined, it's likely that Nate Yarnell will start at quarterback. He completed only 4 of 12 passes for 44 yards and threw two interceptions in the loss to Virginia. Since Pitt joined the ACC in 2011, the Panthers and Tigers have met four times. The series is 2-2. Pitt leads the all-time series 3-2 and won the recent meeting 27-17 in 2021.  After Saturday's game, Clemson will close the regular season at home against the Citadel and No. 21 South Carolina, while Pitt will end with road games against No. 19 Louisville and Boston College. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

He’s going to control where his son, Shedeur Sanders, and Travis Hunter get selected in the 2025 NFL Draft. This isn’t exactly unprecedented, as Eli Manning pulled a similar stunt in the 2004 NFL Draft to avoid ending up with the San Diego Chargers, forcing his way to the New York Giants. Coach Prime has coached his son since their days together at Jackson State and now Colorado. But he’s a dad first. “I’m gonna be dad. I’m gonna be dad until the cows come home,” Prime said on FS1. “And with Travis as well.”  At 23 years old by the time April’s NFL Draft rolls around, Sanders is widely expected to be one of the top two quarterbacks selected. His Colorado teammate, Hunter, is likely to be a top-five draft selection as well. Coach Prime’s influence on the 2025 NFL Draft will shake up how the entire first round unfolds, as there’s likely to be several quarterback-needy teams with the top five selections.  While he wouldn’t reveal the list of preferred landing spots, Sanders disclosed that the culture and environment will be important for a team interested in drafting Shedeur. The franchise needs to have a track record of success with a quarterback of similar playing style or have coaches in the building that can work with that skillset. That's a pretty vague description of which teams could be in the running. Sanders elaborates that these conversations will be done privately, not publicly. However, in the way that modern NFL reporting works, you could assume that a preferred list of teams will be released. Or maybe even a list of teams that must stay away from Shedeur and Hunter. Currently, behind Trevor Lawrence’s Jacksonville Jaguars, the New York Giants have the No. 2 overall selection and will need a QB. Their failed Daniel Jones experiment is likely to be up. The Tennessee Titans, Cleveland Browns and Las Vegas Raiders all fall behind and will all likely be eyeing quarterbacks.  Could the Giants replace Brian Daboll with someone qualified to coach Sanders? Will the Titans and Browns be told to stay away because of their recent ineptitude with handling quarterbacks?  These are questions that currently do not have answers. The only thing that’s certain is that Coach Prime will be involved, and unstable organizations that are eyeing Shedeur better have a backup plan. Copyright 2024"

Fresh after narrowly dodging defeat, BYU (9-0, 6-0 Big 12) tries to stay unbeaten and in control of its postseason plans when it faces Kansas on Saturday night in Big 12 play at Provo, Utah. The Cougars are third among the four projected conference champions, moving ahead of Miami of the Atlantic Coast Conference thanks to the Hurricanes' loss last week at Georgia Tech. But it barely got here.  BYU was on its way to dropping out of the Top 10 before rallying for a 22-21 victory over host Utah last Saturday night. The undefeated season seemed to be lost when Jake Retzlaff was sacked at his own 1-yard line on fourth down with 1:29 remaining as the Utes began celebrating their upset victory. But a defensive holding penalty was called on the Utes and that gave the Cougars renewed life. Retzlaff drove BYU in position for Will Ferrin's game-winning 44-yard field goal with three seconds left. While Utah coach Kyle Whittingham and athletic director Mark Harlan were irate -- Harlan was fined $40,000 by the Big 12 for criticizing officials, Cougars coach Kalani Sitake was simple in his remarks. ""That's the game of football,"" Sitake said. ""You can't hold people, you know?"" Retzlaff wasn't dwelling on the controversial play. To him, it is what BYU did with its second chance that decided the game. ""That's football,"" Retzlaff said. ""There are many calls in a game that you get, and some you don't get. At the end of the day, we went down the field with no timeouts, which isn't an easy feat."" The end result is that BYU is 9-0 for the second time under Sitake (2020) and fifth time in school history. One of those times was in 1984 when the Cougars won the national championship. Defensively, BYU is tied for second nationally with James Madison with 16 interceptions. Cornerback Jakob Robinson had his third of the season and 11th of his career against Utah. Kansas (3-6, 2-4) has won two of its past three games after posting a 45-36 victory over then-No. 17 Iowa State in Kansas City last weekend. Star running back Devin Neal rushed for 116 yards and two touchdowns and became the school's all-time leader in career rushing yards (3,951), rushing touchdowns (43) and 100-yard outings (18). He broke records held by June Henley (3,841 yards, 41 TDs from 1993-96) and Tony Sands (17 100-yard outings from 1988-91). Neal grew up as a die-hard Kansas fan who witnessed many uncompetitive seasons. He is a native of Lawrence, the city where the university is located. ""I never, honestly, never would have thought I would get in this position,"" Neal said. ""So many things kind of just led to this moment. At the time, I just had no idea what it was leading to. That's what's most special about it. Doing it with the guys who grew with me in this program as well. ""It's easy for anyone to quit and leave and go to a different program when things are hard. But they stuck through it. Not everyone can say that they brought literally the worst organizational program out from the mud. That's something we're going to live on forever."" Neal has rushed for 874 yards and 10 touchdowns this season. Quarterback Jalon Daniels has passed for 1,816 yards, 13 touchdowns and nine interceptions. Kansas has two top-notch cornerbacks in Cobee Bryant (13 career interceptions) and Mello Dotson (11). Dotson had a 25-yard pick-six interception against Iowa State to extend his school record to four interception returns for touchdowns. Daniel threw three touchdown passes when Kansas recorded a 38-27 home win over BYU last season.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Wildcats (3-6, 1-5 Big 12) are trying to keep alive bowl hopes after starting the season No. 21 in the AP Top 25 poll. Injuries and an uneven transition to new head coach Brent Brennan dashed high expectations, as Arizona has lost three in a row at home.  Arizona hasn't provided enough help on offense for wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan (63 catches, 1,066 yards, six TDs). The Wildcats are averaging 17.3 points in their past eight games; opponents are putting up 30.1 per game.  ""This last stretch of brotherhood, how do you want this to end?"" Brennan said of the message to his team since a 56-12 loss at UCF on Nov. 2. ""I think that's something they all lean into heavily. Attacking the work and finishing the right way is what everyone in the program should be all about right now.""  The Cougars (4-5, 3-3) have had season-long issues on offense -- they average 15.2 points per game, third-worst in the country -- but have been better since turning to sophomore quarterback Zeon Chriss four games ago. He helped lead a 30-19 victory at TCU, and Houston has won three of its past four, including narrow home wins over Utah and then-No. 17 Kansas State.  Now, the Cougars are dreaming of the postseason, finishing against Baylor at home and then at BYU.  ""I just try and focus on each game,"" coach Willie Fritz said. ""We're 100 percent focused on Arizona. I think that's the way to do it. Everybody can say these what-ifs and all these other kinds of stuff. We're not at that point in our program to do stuff like that, and I probably never will anyway."" Chriss was 11-for-11 passing in the 24-19 victory over Kansas State, throwing for 103 yards and a touchdown. He also was the team's leading rusher with 75 yards on 22 attempts, including a 41-yard touchdown for the winning points with 2:31 to go. He will be the focus of an Arizona defense that has lost three of its best players to injuries -- linebacker Jacob Manu, defensive back Treydan Stukes and safety Gunner Maldonado. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

He's quickly displaying why the Trail Blazers missed him so much last season. Williams dominated the first contest of a back-to-back set with the Minnesota Timberwolves and will look to repeat his performance when the teams meet again Wednesday night in Portland. Tuesday's 122-108 victory over Minnesota marked Williams' third appearance of the season. He scored 19 points on 9-of-10 shooting from the field and recorded nine rebounds, three assists, three blocked shots and three steals in 25 minutes of action. ""I'm just blessed to be out here playing this game,"" Williams said afterward. ""There's always light at the end of the tunnel."" Williams played just six games for Portland last season in his first campaign with the team before the season-ending injury. His absence left a major hole up front, and the squad's defense often was a problem. ""You guys have heard me since he's been here, raving about how happy I am to be able to coach him,"" the Trail Blazers' Chauncey Billups said after Tuesday's game. ""He's just a winner. He does everything you need him to do. ""His feel for the game is very high-level, his IQ is really, really high-level. His rebounding, his blocked shots, his voice, he's so impactful."" Williams was one of seven Portland players to score in double digits Tuesday in a contest that was part of the NBA Cup. Both teams are in Group A. Portland's Jerami Grant scored a team-best 21 points while Shaedon Sharpe and Deni Avdija added 17 apiece. Toumani Camara and Scoot Henderson had 14 points each and Dalano Banton had 12. Deandre Ayton (sprained finger) missed the contest, and Anfernee Simons played just five minutes due to chest pains. Billups said Simons underwent tests that came back normal, but he added that Simons will undergo ""further testing"" on Wednesday. ""He was experiencing a little shortness of breath out of nowhere,"" Billups said. ""We wanted to be extra cautious."" Tuesday's performance was much different for Portland. Last Friday, the Timberwolves walloped the Trail Blazers 127-102 in Minneapolis. Anthony Edwards drained nine 3-pointers and had 37 points in that contest, and Minnesota was 22 of 50 from 3-point range. On Tuesday night, the Timberwolves were 13 of 35 from behind the arc. Edwards made four treys while scoring 26 points. Naz Reid was Minnesota's leading scorer with 28 points on Tuesday. What hurt the Timberwolves was their inability to take care of the ball. Minnesota committed a season-worst 23 turnovers that led to 25 Portland points. ""Just sloppiness, carelessness,"" Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. ""Highly controllable ones."" Four different players committed four miscues. It marked the third straight game and the fourth time overall that the Timberwolves had at least 20 turnovers in a game this season. ""I think we got to get into more structure,"" Finch said of how the issues can be diminished. ""Guys are trying to make the high-risk play a lot instead of the simple play."" Finch said some turnovers were due to players trying to force the ball inside to Rudy Gobert. The big man took just three shots, making two. While Reid and Edwards combined for half of Minnesota's points, Jaden McDaniels performed well with 17 points on 8-of-10 shooting from the field. The Timberwolves had beaten Portland five straight times before Tuesday's loss. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

It means that pretty much the entirety of the player universe is potentially accessible to us.” This doesn’t mean you’ll be seeing Juan Soto patrolling right field in Queens for most of the next 13 or so years. But it means the Mets are going to be players for Soto—whom Stearns and owner Steve Cohen are expected to visit this week in California—as well as every other major free agent. To some degree, this is a no-duh statement. Cohen is one of the richest people in the world and has made no secret of his desire to build the Mets into the east coast version of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The concept of the Mets chasing an in-his-prime Hall of Fame-caliber player is jarring, in the most positive of ways, after the Wilpons spent decades either pursuing the wrong big-ticket players, coming up with excuses for why they didn’t want a superstar, or ignoring difference-makers entirely in favor of perusing the bargain aisle. Following the 1991 season, the Mets made Bobby Bonilla the best-paid player in baseball (at $6 million per season, be still your beating heart!) one winter before Barry Bonds hit the free agent market. Sure, Bonds and New York would have been a relationship made in tabloid back page hell (or heaven, depending on your viewpoint). But unlike Bonilla (30.2 career WAR, per Baseball-Reference), at least Bonds (162.8 career WAR) would have offered some insane production along with his churlishness.  After a stirring run to the World Series in 2000, the Mets were overwhelming favorites to land 25-year-old shortstop Alex Rodriguez as a free agent. Rodriguez even grew up rooting for the Mets and Keith Hernandez (this was before we all knew that Rodriguez had a knack for saying a lot of things convenient for whichever narrative he was trying to establish). But the Mets didn't make a bid for Rodriguez after general manager Steve Phillips declared him a “24-plus-1” player who wanted his own office, among other perks, at Shea Stadium. The Wilpons didn’t even bother making up excuses once the Bernie Madoff scandal impacted the Mets’ payroll. After the 2018 season, Jeff Wilpon said the Mets—due to pay about $50 million to Yoenis Cespedes and Robinson Cano—wouldn't pursue free agents Bryce Harper or Manny Machado because “…I don’t know how many teams have two $30 million players.” Cohen proved such things were possible in 2022 and 2023, when the Mets’ roster featured three $30 million players apiece (Justin Verlander replaced Jacob deGrom alongside Francisco Lindor and Max Scherzer in 2023). But that spending spree felt a bit ethereal, especially when Cohen dealt Scherzer and Verlander in the midst of a disappointing ’23 season, and 2024 was established as a reset year under new arrival Stearns. That reset ended with the Mets finishing two wins shy of the World Series and tens of millions of dollars in dead money wiped off the payroll, which leaves Cohen and Stearns well-positioned to address areas of need. Like, say, right field, a position from whom the Mets got 14 homers and a .709 OPS this season. Soto, who had 41 homers and a .989 OPS while playing mostly right field, would solve that problem into the 2030s while giving the Mets their first Cooperstown-track 20-something since Tom Seaver. Of course, simply desiring Soto and having the ability to write him a gargantuan check is no guarantee the Mets will land him. But if the Mets don’t get Soto, it finally—incredibly —won't be for a lack of money or desire.  Copyright 2024"

Mathurin recorded career-high totals in points (38) and 3-pointers (seven), and Haliburton added a season-best 35 points and 14 assists in Indiana's 132-121 victory over the New York Knicks on Sunday. The two combined to make 24 of 36 shots from the floor for a staggering 66.7 percent. ""Tyrese was amazing in this game,"" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. ""I don't know if I've ever seen him more determined in a regular-season game than this one."" Carlisle also had kind words for Mathurin. ""Benn Mathurin was absolutely breathtaking. Efficient, tough physically."" The win was the third in the past four games for the Pacers, who will face Orlando for the third time already in the young season.  Haliburton contributed 19 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds in Indiana's 119-115 setback to the Magic in Orlando on Oct. 28. He added 17 points in a 118-111 victory over the Magic in Indianapolis last Wednesday. Mathurin mustered just five points in 14 minutes in the first meeting before collecting 20 points and 11 rebounds in the rematch. Indiana likely will need more of the same from Mathurin and Haliburton given its injury woes, notably with respect to Aaron Nesmith and Andrew Nembhard. Nesmith will be sidelined until at least December with a sprained ankle, while Nembhard will miss two weeks due to a sprained knee.  Coupled with the season-ending Achilles injuries to centers James Wiseman and Isaiah Jackson, the Pacers find their backs against the wall in the early going of the season.  ""NBA coaching is resourcefulness and problem solving,"" Carlisle said. ""We haven't had this level of guys out for quite a while."" The Magic remained perfect at home this season (5-0) with their 114-89 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Tuesday in the opening round of Group A play in the NBA Cup.  Orlando answered a winless five-game trip by taking the first three contests of its five-game homestand.  ""This is why we keep talking about process,"" Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said. ""During the losing streak, we were getting the right shots, getting to the paint, doing the things we needed to do, we were defending at a decent clip, and now you put it all together with the ability to make some shots, get the stops that you need to, turn them over the right way. ... You can't keep chasing and worrying about the result as much as you worry about the work you're doing."" Orlando's Franz Wagner scored a season-high 32 points to go with eight rebounds and five assists before sitting out the entire fourth quarter.

MacKinnon leads the league with 30 points after finishing last season in second with 140. We will look at those streaking Cavaliers, who are quickly changing the way we dissect the best teams in the underachieving Eastern Conference. The Cavaliers are the eighth team to win their first 12 games, and they are tied for the sixth-best start with the 1996-97 Chicago Bulls and 1982-83 Seattle SuperSonics. That Chicago team won the title behind Michael Jordan. As for Seattle, it feels really silly that we don't have a cool nickname like SuperSonics in action. Feels like the Cavaliers will clinch a  playoff spot any day now with the reigning champion Boston Celtics (9-3) as the only other team above .500. The 76ers (2-8) are the second-worst team in the East that also has another major underachiever in the Milwaukee Bucks (3-8). That Doc Rivers thing isn't working. If Cleveland can run its streak to 15, it will be visiting the Celtics next Tuesday in a must-watch event. The Cavaliers defeated the host Bulls 119-113 on Monday behind Donovan Mitchell's 36 points. Philadelphia lost 111-99 to the visiting New York Knicks on Tuesday as former MVP Joel Embiid (knee, suspension) made his season debut and scored 13 points on rusty 2-of-11 shooting. Embiid hedged on whether he will sit out Wednesday after previously saying he wouldn't play in back-to-backs, but we see the Cavaliers rolling whether or not he suits up.

One of those was a 127-102 beatdown in Minneapolis on Friday. So naturally, the Trail Blazers controlled the rematch and recorded a 122-108 in a stunning performance. The Timberwolves committed a season-worst 23 turnovers and were 13 of 35 from 3-point range after being 22 of 50 in the previous meeting. Anthony Edwards made four treys and scored 26 points on Tuesday after making nine and scoring 37 in the game in the Twin Cities. Portland was energized by the play of Robert Williams III, who had 19 points on 9-of-10 shooting in his third game since major knee surgery. The showing was one of Portland's best of the seasons, but hard to see them knocking off the Timberwolves two straight nights. Minnesota likely posts another rout this time.

Los Angeles won its previous two road games by a cumulative 8-1 score, so the Calgary loss could be just a blip. Trevor Moore scored the lone Los Angeles goal with 2:31 remaining in the contest. Anze Kopitar had an assist, and he leads the team in points (18) and assists (13). Alex Laferriere leads the Kings with nine goals but has just one over the past five games. Colorado has won the first two contests of a four-game homestand and is victorious in its last three home games. The Avalanche beat the Nashville Predators 3-2 in overtime on Monday after scoring a season-best six goals twice over their previous three games. MacKinnon (seven goals, 23 assists) is averaging nearly two points a game and seems impossible to slow down.

Freshman Egor Demin, a projected NBA lottery pick, sparked the Cougars (2-0) to home victories over Central Arkansas and UC Riverside last week. The Moscow, Russia, native averaged 19 points, 9 assists and 4.5 rebounds in the wins. The Cougars, a member of the Big 12, have won 15 straight non-conference home games. Wednesday will mark a quick turnaround for Queens (2-1), which lost for the first time Tuesday night against Utah in Salt Lake City. Chris Ashby scored 14 points, but the Royals were outscored 55-34 in the second half of a 96-65 setback.  Bryce Cash added 11 points, while Jaxon Pollard and Asjon Anderson chipped in 10 points apiece in Queens' loss. The Cougars, meanwhile, are coming off of an 86-80 win over UC Riverside on Friday. Demin led BYU with 20 points. Other players who are off to good starts for the Cougars are Richie Saunders (averaging 14 points and 7 rebounds a game), freshman Kanon Catchings (13 points per game) and Utah transfer Keba Keita (10 points, 10 rebounds per game). Though the Cougars are averaging 87 points on 49.3 percent shooting from the field, their free-throw performance has left room for improvement. BYU has hit just 21 of 37 foul shots (56.8 percent). ""We've got to get back to making them under pressure with 20,000 people watching you, and we will,"" Saunders said. ""It's just coming out and doing it, just making them."" Wednesday will mark the first-ever meeting between the Royals and Cougars. The game will be a homecoming for Bobby Horodyski, who was BYU's  director of basketball operations before joining Queens as an assistant coach in the summer of 2023. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The teams will look to continue their good fortune at the other's expense on Wednesday night when they meet in Milwaukee.  ""Madness"" was the way Detroit coach J.B. Bickerstaff described his club's recent stretch of nail-biting results. The Pistons have split their past four outings by a total margin of six points. Detroit dropped a one-point decision in Charlotte last Wednesday and recorded a one-point win over Atlanta two nights later on Cade Cunningham's clutch basket and last-second block.  A two-point loss to Houston followed on Sunday after Detroit failed to capitalize on two deliberately missed free throws. That preceded Tuesday's 123-121 overtime victory against Miami. Heat star Tyler Herro atoned for missing a buzzer-beating base jumper at the end of regulation by sinking a 6-footer with 1.1 seconds left in overtime. The Pistons leveled the contest after Jalen Duren converted Cunningham's inbound lob. Malik Beasley sealed the win by draining a pair of free throws after the Heat called an illegal, excess timeout. ""That was madness,"" Bickerstaff said. ""But this is who they are, and we love every minute of it. ""Their resolve, all the stuff they've been through -- multiple times they could have given in, (and thought) 'it's too hard'. They (Heat) were making shots, we were turning it over, and over and over, instead of laying down, they bandied together."" Cunningham (21 points, seven rebounds, nine assists) again threatened a triple-double, while Beasley hit 5 of 11 shots from 3-point range to highlight his 21-point performance. There were challenges on the way, with Jaden Ivey fouling out and Tim Hardaway Jr. taken off the court in a wheelchair and treated for a head injury after twice colliding with Herro.  Hardaway's playing status is unclear. ""We had so much adversity -- Tim Hardaway goes down, JD (Duren) back spasms, JI (Ivey) fouls out ... we showed grit and kept playing. That's what a team does,"" Beasley said. Milwaukee, meanwhile, recaptured some elusive form by beating the Toronto Raptors 99-85 on Tuesday. Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 23 points and Bobby Portis added 17 off the bench for the Bucks, who were without star guard Damian Lillard (concussion protocol). AJ Green was given his first start since he was a rookie, and Ryan Rollins the first of his career. Between them, the pair had eight 3-pointers and seven steals, although Rollins' night ended with a left shoulder injury. The Bucks racked up 16 steals in their best defensive performance of the season. At the other end, Milwaukee attempted 56 shots from 3-point range, much to the delight of coach Doc Rivers. ""I thought the whole team had a lot of energy,"" he said. ""One of the things we've been harping on is getting to the paint and creating more 3s. Well, we shot 56 of them. If we play like that every night and get those shots, we're going to be fine. ""I thought defensively we were great. Our hands were phenomenal."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Longhorns moved from fifth to third in the latest College Football Playoff rankings, tying their highest ever spot in the poll. Texas also was ranked third in the CFP poll in advance of the playoff semifinal against No. 2 Washington in December 2023. The Saturday clash marks first time Texas and Arkansas will battle as members of the SEC but the 80th time the Longhorns and Razorbacks line up on the gridiron. Texas holds a 56-23 all-time edge in the meetings, most of which were contested when the two schools were part of the now defunct Southwest Conference. Arkansas has won the two most recent meetings, 31-7 at the 2014 Texas Bowl and 41-20 in the 2021 regular season at Fayetteville. ""I don't know what (legendary Texas coach) Darrell Royal did to Arkansas back in the day, but they absolutely hate our guts,"" current Longhorns coach Steve Sarkisian said Monday. ""And I think we learned that the first time around when we went there (in 2021)."" The Longhorns (8-1, 4-1 SEC) travel to Arkansas after a dominating 49-17 home win over Florida last week. Texas outgained the Gators 353-138 on the way to a 35-0 halftime lead while producing eight plays of 20-plus yards before the break. Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers passed for 333 yards and career-high five touchdowns over the game's first 33 minutes and Jerrick Gibson rushed for 100 yards and a TD on 16 carries. The Longhorns have won nine straight true road games since a 41-34 loss at Oklahoma State in 2022. Texas was 5-0 on the road in 2023 and is 2-0 this season at opponents' home venues. ""Our culture, our connectivity, our love for one another has been a big piece of that puzzle,"" Sarkisian said about Texas' recent road success. ""It takes great poise and composure on the road, and I think we've learned and grown into that aspect."" The Razorbacks (5-4, 3-3 SEC) had a bye last week and likely needed it to refocus after a 63-31 loss at Ole Miss on Nov. 2. Arkansas quarterback Taylen Green finished 10 of 14 for 158 yards before exiting with a sprained knee. Backup Malachi Singleton was 11 of 14 for 207 yards with a touchdown pass to Luke Hasz. Andrew Armstrong gained 135 yards on six catches. Green is good to go for the Texas game, according to Arkansas coach Sam Pittman. The Razorback could also get running back Ja'Quinden Jackson back on the field after he missed two games in a row with the recurrence of an ankle injury. Pittman expects renewed effort by his team against the Longhorns -- and he acknowledged that it would be needed to beat Texas. ""Like I said before, we tried so many different things against Ole Miss and none of them seemed to work,"" Pittman said. ""But it all goes down to that we didn't play as hard as what we normally do, and we certainly have to get back to that to have a chance."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

While the Kings enjoyed the night off, the Suns opened NBA Cup play with a 120-112 road win over the Utah Jazz on Tuesday, riding 31 points from Devin Booker and 24 from Bradley Beal. Phoenix has a second NBA Cup road game slated for Friday at Oklahoma City, but also should be plenty inspired to see the Kings, who pulled out a 127-118 overtime triumph in Arizona on Sunday. DeMar DeRozan dominated the five extra minutes for the Kings, single-handedly outscoring the Suns 8-7. De'Aaron Fox scored Sacramento's other eight overtime points. That was the Suns' first game without Kevin Durant, who suffered a strained left calf Friday in a win over Dallas. He already has been ruled out of all games this week. On the season, he is averaging 27.6 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. It's possible Beal also will miss the revenge game against the Kings after straining a calf late in the win at Utah. Phoenix coach Mike Budenholzer said afterward that a decision on Beal's status for the Sacramento game will be made after a further examination Wednesday, but the standout guard had his own diagnosis shortly thereafter. ""It just got tight on me,"" he said. ""I think it was probably lingering from the knee injury (in Sunday's game against the Kings). It should be all right. Leaving the game against Utah was ""just a little precautionary,"" he said. Beal had a team-high 28 points and Booker 23 in Sunday's loss. Booker had a chance to prevent overtime, but misfired on a buzzer-beating 24-footer. The Kings showed the wear and tear of their extra-time effort at Phoenix when they went to San Antonio and got crushed 116-96 on the second night of a back-to-back Monday. Sacramento had suffered their previous four losses by a total of 18 points. Like the Suns, Sacramento is playing a man down this week after supersub Malik Monk sprained his right ankle in the win at Phoenix. He wasn't among the reserves who got outscored 37-21 by their San Antonio counterparts. The initial diagnosis indicated Monk could be back by the end of the month, which sugar-coated the bad news for teammate Fox. ""Malik is obviously big for us,"" Fox said. ""He's a sixth starter. He can start for a lot of teams. Last year, it hurt us big-time (when he was out)."" Monk sprained the same ankle in the Kings' 73rd game last March and sat out the rest of the regular season, during which Sacramento went 4-5 to slide into the 9-10 play-in game in the Western Conference. He also missed both of the Kings' play-in games -- a win over Golden State and a season-ending loss to New Orleans. This season, Monk is averaging 12.6 points and 25 minutes per game off the bench. DeRozan totaled 34 points, Fox 21 and Domantas Sabonis 20 to complement 12 rebounds in the win over the Suns. Keegan Murray tipped in a DeRozan miss with four seconds left to create the tie that led to overtime. He finished with 14 points and 14 rebounds. -Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

New York recorded a 111-99 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday to open its NBA Cup group play. Josh Hart notched his seventh career triple-double and first this season with 14 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists.  Hart, who said during the preseason that he felt ""lost"" in a new-look Knicks rotation, is averaging career highs in rebounds (9.3) and assists (5.6). ""A lot of what he says, you've got to let go in one ear and out the other. He likes to hear himself talk,"" Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau jokingly said of Hart. ""That being said, I love Josh.""  Hart has scored in double figures in every game this season. Tuesday marked his fifth outing of the campaign with either a double-double or triple-double.  New York's marquee offseason addition, big man Karl-Anthony Towns, had his streak of 30-plus-point games end at three when he scored 21 at Philadelphia. Towns also had 13 rebounds in the win.  OG Anunoby scored 24 points on 11-of-16 shooting from the floor. That performance came on the heels of his 25 points in Sunday's 132-121 loss at Indiana.  Chicago sputters into New York having lost five of its last six games after a 119-113 setback vs. the undefeated Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday. Zach LaVine scored 26 points and Nikola Vucevic and Coby White each added 20 in a losing effort. The Bulls leveraged their balanced scoring into a nine-point lead, but 21 turnovers that Cleveland converted into 35 points contributed to the loss.  ""We're emphasizing pace and the way we want to play, but it's also my job to recognize if we haven't gotten a good look in a couple of trips down, slow the game down,"" LaVine said per the Chicago Sun-Times. ""That's probably where a few turnovers came from, just leaving my feet. It's been a little bit of an issue, but I'm the first one to look in the mirror and say I've got to be better in that area."" Chicago is averaging 16.5 turnovers, seventh-most in the league.  Defense also continues to vex the Bulls. They have surrendered at least 119 points in all five of their losses over this six-game stretch. At an average of 120.7 points allowed per game in 2024-25, Chicago sports the NBA's fourth-most porous defense.  New York's defense, meanwhile, has been a case of Jekyll and Hyde. The Knicks came into Tuesday's win allowing 111.2 points per game, but in holding the 76ers to 99, New York is limiting opponents to an average of 99.2 points in its wins. ""Our defense sustained throughout the game and in the fourth quarter,"" Towns said, per the New York Post. ""So it's something to be proud of, something to hang our hat on and build off."" The Knicks have held their opponents under 100 points in each of their last three victories. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Even more, the 12-0 Cavaliers may catch a break Wednesday night when they visit the scuffling Philadelphia 76ers.  Not only did Cleveland rest Tuesday while Philadelphia lost to the New York Knicks 111-99, but the Sixers will be shorthanded on Wednesday.  How shorthanded remains to be seen. The Sixers definitely will be without Tyrese Maxey (hamstring injury) and could be without Joel Embiid (knee) and Paul George (knee).  Embiid made his season debut Tuesday in the loss to New York, while George has played in the last five games after missing the first five. In either case, the absence of either player would spell bad news against the soaring Cavaliers.  ""We're doing it in various ways,"" said star guard Donovan Mitchell, who leads Cleveland in scoring with an average of 23.7 points a game. ""We're doing it in a way where we are blowing out teams. We're winning from behind. We're winning close games. And it's somebody different every night."" Mitchell was the primary star for the Cavaliers in Monday's 119-113 road win over the Chicago Bulls. He scored 36 points and shot 7 of 16 from 3-point range, and five teammates scored in double figures. The Cavaliers are the eighth team in NBA history to start the season 12-0 or better. The last team to go undefeated in its first dozen games was the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors, who went 24-0 en route to a league-record 73-win campaign. ""Great stat. I didn't know that,"" Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson said about his team. ""We're going to celebrate that. Being in the league 17 years, you have good starts and you have bad starts. But to have a great start like this is unique and something to celebrate."" The Sixers, meanwhile, haven't had much to celebrate this season. They are 2-8 and, while Embiid made his season debut Tuesday, he shot just 2 of 11 from the field for 13 points and grabbed only three rebounds in 26 minutes. ""A little rusty. A little bit of conditioning (concerns) showed up fairly early,"" said Sixers coach Nick Nurse, noting that those issues were anticipated. Nurse wouldn't commit to Embiid's status for Wednesday -- or for George's -- but Embiid said he wants to suit up again. ""I feel good right now, but I'll see. It's up to them,"" Embiid said. Embiid's teammates certainly would be excited to see him on the court again. Rookie guard Jared McCain had a productive night playing alongside him Tuesday, when he registered 23 points for his second straight effort of at least 20 points. ""It's pretty easy playing with him,"" McCain said, while George noted that ""you just see how much (Embiid) demands eyes and attention on him"" after the perennial All-Stars played their first game together. Regardless of which Sixers' stars are in uniform, Mitchell and the Cavaliers will be ready. ""We're going to get teams' best shots,"" Mitchell said. ""We're going to get tested early. I have no doubt we will.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Nets nearly left Boston victorious Friday night by starting fast before struggling down the stretch and falling in overtime. Brooklyn hopes to put itself in position to finish off a rare win over the Celtics on Wednesday night when the teams meet in the Barclays Center.  Boston is 11-1 in the past 12 regular-season meetings with Brooklyn and has won the past five. Of the Celtics' 11 wins in that span, eight have been by double digits. In the first meeting of a season in which the Celtics are strong favorites to repeat as champions and the Nets are projected to be amongst the NBA's worst teams, Boston earned a 108-104 overtime win on Nov. 8. The Celtics won despite allowing the game's first 12 points. Brooklyn's close call at Boston was part of a three-game trip. A night after falling short against the Celtics, the Nets held a 12-point lead into the fourth quarter and wound up with a 105-100 loss to the unbeaten Cleveland Cavaliers. On Monday, the Nets made enough plays down the stretch in their 107-105 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans and improved to 5-4 in nine games since opening the season with road losses to the Atlanta Hawks and Orlando Magic. Leading scorer Cam Thomas hit the go-ahead 3-pointer Monday with 32.9 seconds left, and the Nets made a pair of defensive stops. Brooklyn placed seven players in double figures and hit a season-high 19 3-pointers. Thomas paced the Nets with 17 points to go with seven rebounds while Cameron Johnson added 15 points and Dennis Schroder 14. ""That was big for us,"" Brooklyn forward Noah Clowney said after contributing 15 points. ""We had a few games against really good teams where we played down to the wire and we don't close in the fourth. So for us to close in the fourth was a big step in the right direction."" The Nets used a different starting lineup by inserting Ben Simmons off the bench. He finished with six points and 12 assists. Ziaire Williams started for Dorian Finney-Smith (left ankle sprain) and might do so again if the veteran forward is unable to play. Boston will attempt to avoid consecutive losses for the first time this season after squandering a 15-point lead in its 117-116 home defeat to the Hawks on Tuesday in its first in-season tournament game. Jaylen Brown, who missed Friday's game vs. Brooklyn, scored a season-high 37 points and Derrick White added 31. Jayson Tatum was held to 20 points on 5-of-16 shooting from the field as the Celtics were outplayed in numerous facets against Atlanta. Boston gave up 63 points in the second half and committed a season-worst 20 turnovers. The Celtics also conceded a season-high 20 offensive rebounds. ""We expected to win,"" Brown said. ""Too careless, and it showed. I think the No. 1 category it showed in is our turnovers. Uncharacteristic of us to have 20 turnovers in any circumstance. I think that just displayed that we weren't in sync like we normally are, so we've got to be better at that, and I've got to be better at that."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Maple Leafs are coming off a 3-0 setback against the Ottawa Senators on Tuesday.  After falling behind 41 seconds into the contest, the Leafs allowed the final two tallies in 43 seconds early in the second period. They were outshot 35-18 over the first two periods. ""Not a good game for us,"" Toronto coach Craig Berube said. ""There wasn't much good to talk about in the game overall. We got outskated; they wanted it more than us. That's the bottom line."" The loss snapped Toronto's three-game winning streak, during which the team outscored its opponents 11-2. Much of that had been fueled by a surging power play, which went 7-for-13 (a staggering 53.8 percent clip) over the three games. But while the man advantage was rolling, the Maple Leafs have struggled to get their offense going at 5-on-5, scoring just one goal in that situation over their past five outings. William Nylander, who leads the team with 11 goals, hasn't connected at 5-on-5 since tallying twice in a win against the Seattle Kraken on Oct. 31. Tuesday's defeat is the latest instance of early-season struggles against under .500 foes for the Maple Leafs, who also have lost to the St. Louis Blues (twice) and Columbus Blue Jackets over the past three weeks. Perhaps, then, a game against the Capitals is just what is needed to get back on track. Washington has won 10 of its 14 games this season. Its 20 points are tied with Toronto, but the Capitals have played three fewer games. The Capitals have been idle since an 8-1 throttling of the Blues on Saturday. Washington led 3-1 after two periods before adding five goals in the third period. Superstar captain Alex Ovechkin kicked off the third-period surge with a power-play goal. And while Washington was once known for its dominant play with the man advantage, it's been anything but this season. The Capitals have just six goals on 48 opportunities thus far, a meager 12.5 percent clip that is tied with the Anaheim Ducks and New York Islanders for second-worst in the NHL. ""That's what the power play can do,"" Capitals coach Spencer Carbery said. ""In tight games, it obviously can help you. In a 1-1 game, you get a power play, score, win the game, you go up 2-1. But also in a game like this, where 3-1 is still a hockey game in this league. The fourth goal is big, and the power play stepped up and scored that."" The power-play conversion was one of two tallies on the night for Ovechkin, who has 863 career goals as he continues to inch closer to Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky's NHL record of 894. The 39-year-old's hot start -- he has 10 goals in 14 games -- has been a stark contrast from a season ago, when it took him 45 games to reach double digits. ""He energizes the whole team,"" center Dylan Strome said. ""Everyone wants to see him score. Obviously, we're all working toward that record and we're winning hockey games. Both are going well, and hopefully we can keep going."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Oregon (10-0, 7-0), No. 1 in the CFP rankings released Tuesday, routed Maryland 39-18 last weekend behind three scoring passes by Gabriel, who broke the NCAA record for total career touchdowns. Wisconsin (5-4, 3-3) is coming off a bye after a 42-10 loss at Iowa, one of the worst defeats in Luke Fickell's two years as coach. ""We're still having a lot of fun, coming up every single day to get better and find ways to improve,"" Oregon coach Dan Lanning said Monday. ""The challenge of this new conference, the travel and some of the teams that we got to play, it's been a lot of fun for us."" Gabriel, a sixth-year transfer from Oklahoma, completed 23 of 34 passes for 183 yards against the Terrapins. That gave him 180 total touchdowns (147 passing, 33 rushing), surpassing the 178 touchdowns (155 passing, 23 rushing) that Case Keenum produced for Houston from 2007-11. Gabriel leads the nation in pass completion percentage at 74.1 percent (237 of 320) for 284.8 yards per game, with 22 touchdowns and five interceptions. Gabriel and the Ducks' passing game present obvious difficulties for the Badgers' secondary. ""They're going to be challenged in different ways,"" Fickell said Monday. ""That's the beauty of college football. You can be challenged each and every week in a lot of different ways and this one may be one we haven't seen really the entire year. ""The ability for them to throw the ball downfield. The dynamic of the wide receivers that they have. Obviously, the quarterback and the ability of him to make plays both with his feet and in the air."" James Jordan paces the Ducks' ground game with 946 yards (5.7 per carry) and 10 touchdowns. Oregon has been efficient in the red zone with 39 scores in 44 opportunities, including 32 touchdowns. The Ducks, who have scored 30 or more points in each of their past nine games, average 35.7 points while allowing 16. Oregon averages 457 yards per contest and is giving up 293.7. Wisconsin took consecutive early-season losses to Alabama and Southern California, then dominated Purdue, Rutgers and Northwestern during a three-game winning streak. However, the Badgers have since lost to Penn State, now No. 4 in the CFP rankings, and Iowa. In their five victories, the Badgers outscored opponents 34.4 to 8.6 per game, with a 454-239 average advantage in total yards. In four losses, Wisconsin was outscored 37.5 to 13.5. Redshirt sophomore Braedyn Locke, who took over at quarterback when Tyler Van Dyke suffered a season-ending knee injury against Alabama, threw two costly interceptions against Iowa. Locke has completed 56.8 percent of his passes for 177.3 yards per game, but he has eight picks along with eight touchdown tosses. Against Iowa, the Badgers allowed 329 rushing yards, 6.1 yards per carry. In the teams' most matchup, Oregon edged Wisconsin 28-27 in the 2020 Rose Bowl when the Ducks were still in the Pac-12. The Badgers have not defeated a No. 1-ranked team since a 31-18 upset of Ohio State in 2010. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The unique setting for the game should keep the Buckeyes (8-1, 5-1 Big Ten) fully engaged despite being more than a four-touchdown favorite against the Wildcats (4-5, 2-4 Big Ten) for the game at Wrigley Field in Chicago. ""It's a different feel, but it's a great opportunity for our team,"" Ohio State coach Ryan Day said. ""And ultimately, there'll be 100 yards of football field, and there'll be stands on both sides and we'll compete, so we're excited about that."" Ohio State remained one spot behind Oregon in the College Football Playoff rankings released Tuesday. The Buckeyes lost a road game to the Ducks, 32-31, on Oct. 12. If both teams win out, they would play in the Big Ten title game on Dec. 7 in Indianapolis. ""Every week for us is like the playoffs right now,"" Day said. ""We're fighting for a chance to get to Indianapolis. It's always a topic of conversation, and it's going to come down to our seniors and leaders and how they echo that message."" The Saturday game will be the Buckeyes' first contest at the venerable home of the Chicago Cubs. Northwestern has played there three times since 2010, including a 10-7 loss to Iowa last season. ""We benefit from the fact not only has the program been to Wrigley prior, but we were there just last year so logistically there are some things our guys are comfortable with in terms of what game day's going to look like,"" Northwestern coach David Braun said. A major complaint about the set-up for previous games has been addressed for Saturday and Northwestern's game on Nov. 30 against Illinois at Wrigley Field. An adjustment was made to the layout of the football field enabling sidelines to be across from each other rather than having the teams share a sideline. ""We feel really confident that this is a great setup, and having two opposite sidelines in a traditional manner is important,"" Braun said. Capacity at Wrigley Field is around 41,000, far bigger than the 12,023-seat temporary stadium that is being used this season and next while Ryan Field is being rebuilt. Braun hopes the crowd will give the Wildcats a home-field advantage against an Ohio State team coming off its best all-around game in a 45-0 win against Purdue. The Buckeyes received solid performances from the offense and defense in addition to blocking a punt to set up the game's first touchdown. Ohio State quarterback Will Howard threw for 260 yards and three TDs while running for a score in the victory. He has 22 touchdown passes (against five interceptions) and six scoring runs this year. ""What we've done leading up to this point really has nothing to do with what's going on moving forward,"" Day said. ""It's November. We want to be undefeated in November."" Northwestern last played on Nov. 2 when the Wildcats defeated Purdue 26-20 in overtime. Joseph Himon II caught a 22-yard pass from Jack Lausch for the win after Northwestern stopped the Boilermakers on fourth down to open OT. The Wildcats have beaten the Buckeyes once in the past 34 meetings since 1972 and have lost 10 straight in the series after a 33-27 overtime win in 2004. ""We know we're the underdog,"" Braun said. ""We know not just an underdog, there's no one out there that expects Northwestern to go in and beat Ohio State or, for that matter, compete. ""But this group believes that with a great two weeks of preparation and us showing up at our best we can make this a four-quarter battle, make it close in the fourth quarter, look up with zeros on the clock and the expectation is to expect victory."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Thompson turned back the clock with 22 points and Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving combined for 52 more, but the Mavericks scored only three points over the final 3:29 after taking a 114-108 lead. Curry did all the Golden State scoring after that, including an interior hoop that put the Warriors on top for good at 115-114 with 1:50 remaining and a 3-pointer -- followed by his trademark night-night gesture -- to create a four-point lead with 27.5 seconds left. Quentin Grimes kept Dallas' hopes alive with a 3-pointer six seconds later, but Curry followed that with two free throws before Doncic missed a potential game-tying 3-pointer with five seconds remaining.  Knicks 111, 76ers 99 OG Anunoby scored 24 points and Josh Hart recorded a triple-double as New York spoiled Joel Embiid's season debut with a road win over Philadelphia. After missing six games due to a lingering knee injury and three more following a suspension for shoving a reporter, Embiid returned to the court in a competitive setting for the first time since the Olympics. He played 26 minutes and shot 2 of 11 from the floor, finishing with 13 points, five assists and three rebounds. Hart finished with 14 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists. Paul George had 29 points and 10 rebounds to pace Philadelphia. Pistons 123, Heat 121 (OT) Malik Beasley made a go-ahead technical free throw with 1.1 seconds left in overtime and host Detroit escaped with a wild victory over Miami.  Tyler Herro (40 points), who scored the last nine points of regulation, all on 3-pointers, to force overtime, gave the Heat a two-point lead on a bank shot with 1.8 seconds left in the extra session. An alley-oop dunk by Jalen Duren off an inbounds pass tied the score. The Heat called a timeout they didn't have, resulting in the technical and a 122-121 Pistons lead. Beasley then split two free throws after Miami was called for a take foul. Beasley and Cade Cunningham notched 21 points apiece for Detroit. Herro's 10 3-pointers tied a Heat record and are an NBA Cup single-game record. Hawks 117, Celtics 116 Jalen Johnson had 18 points, 13 rebounds, 10 assists and three steals to lead visiting Atlanta to a victory over Boston.  Jaylen Brown and Derrick White scored season highs of 37 points and 31 points, respectively, for the Celtics. White was 7 of 12 from 3-point territory and 10 of 15 overall, also adding six rebounds and five assists. Atlanta took a 117-116 lead when Onyeka Okongwu tipped in a missed shot with 6.1 seconds to play. After each team turned the ball over in the final seconds, Brown missed a 13-foot jumper at the buzzer. Magic 114, Hornets 89 Franz Wagner pumped in 32 points as Orlando cruised past visiting Charlotte.  Moritz Wagner scored 18 points off the bench and Jalen Suggs tallied all 17 of his points in the first half for Orlando, which has its first three-game winning streak of the season. Franz Wagner made 14 of 25 shots from the field as the Magic shot 46.2 percent overall.  LaMelo Ball's 35 points and Grant Williams' 15 points paced the Hornets, who have lost two straight games. Ball, who sank six shots from 3-point range, ended up with seven assists and six rebounds.  Bucks 99, Raptors 85 Giannis Antetokounmpo led five Milwaukee scorers in double figures in overcoming a monster night from Gradey Dick to beat visiting Toronto.  Bobby Portis had 17 points off the bench for the Bucks. Milwaukee played without star guard Damian Lillard (concussion protocol). He could return for Wednesday's game against the Pistons. Dick, the 20-year-old second-year pro from Kansas, finished with a career-high 32 points. Teammate Jakob Poeltl scored 13 points and had eight rebounds, three steals and two blocks, but the Raptors fell for the fifth straight game. Suns 120, Jazz 112 Devin Booker and Bradley Beal combined to make 9 of 16 3-pointers en route to 31 and 24 points, respectively, and Phoenix downed Utah in Salt Lake City. Mason Plumlee recorded a double-double of 15 points and 14 rebounds while starting in place of an injured Jusuf Nurkic (ankle) for Phoenix, which was also without All-NBA forward Kevin Durant due to a calf strain.  Jordan Clarkson's 4-of-9 night led Utah to 15-of-38 shooting (39.5 percent) from 3-point range. Clarkson finished with 16 points off the bench. Jazz rookie Kyle Filipowski added 18 points off the bench, and Lauri Markkanen scored 17.

Erik Brannstrom also recorded one goal and one assist for the Canucks, who won on home ice for only the second time this season (2-2-3). Pius Suter scored once, and J.T. Miller collected a pair of assists. Goaltender Kevin Lankinen made 28 saves to record the victory. Justin Kirkland scored for the Flames, who received a 29-save performance from goaltender Dan Vladar. With his team down 1-0 after the first period, Pettersson tallied a power-play goal to put the Canucks on the board 23 seconds into the second period. Pettersson headed to the net as Miller sent a shot-pass that he perfectly deflected for his fourth goal of the season and second in as many outings.  Suter gave the hosts the lead at 2:38 of the middle frame by taking a pass from Miller as he reached the slot and sliding a low shot into the cage for his sixth goal of the campaign. Brannstrom's first goal of the season -- and his first in 44 games -- extended Vancouver's edge to 3-1 at 6:19 of the third period. With a screen in front of the net, Brannstrom found the corner with a long offering. The Flames, who were playing for the third time in four days, were unable to mount much of a comeback push, even with Vladar pulled for an extra attacker during the final two minutes of the game. Kirkland's second goal of the season, coming with 59.4 seconds remaining in the first period, opened the scoring. Lankinen denied Kevin Rooney's chance off the rush, but Kirkland was on the spot for the rebound. It marked the eighth consecutive game in which Vancouver has surrendered the first goal. Canucks 2022 first-round draft choice Jonathan Lekkerimaki made his NHL debut. He was held off the scoresheet offensively. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Thompson turned back the clock with 22 points, and Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving combined for 52 more, but the Mavericks scored only three points over the final 3:29 after taking a 114-108 lead. Curry did all the Golden State scoring after that, including an interior hoop that put the Warriors on top for good at 115-114 with 1:50 remaining and a 3-pointer -- followed by his trademark night-night gesture -- to create a four-point lead with 27.5 seconds left. Quentin Grimes kept Dallas' hopes alive with a 3-pointer six seconds later, but Curry followed that with two free throws and Doncic missed a potential game-tying 3-pointer with five seconds left. A four-time champion in 13 seasons for the Warriors, Thompson responded to a pregame video tribute and massive ovation from his old fans to bomb in six 3-pointers in 12 attempts. He had eight of his points in a stretch that saw the Mavericks turn a two-point deficit into a 110-105 lead with 5:17 left. Daniel Gafford then had two hoops, sandwiching a De'Anthony Melton 3-pointer, to create Dallas' late six-point lead that set the stage for Curry's late heroics. Thompson's longtime ""Splash Brother"" partner Curry shot 14-for-27 overall and 5-for-12 on 3-pointers. He also found time for six rebounds and a game-high nine assists. Jonathan Kuminga added 16 points for the Warriors, who won for the seventh time in their last eight games, while Buddy Hield and Melton had 14 apiece, and Draymond Green 11 to go with seven rebounds, six assists, three steals and two blocks. Kevon Looney contributed a game-high 11 rebounds to the cause. Doncic paced the Mavericks, who lost their third straight, with 31 points to complement eight rebounds, six assists and three steals. Irving chipped in with 21 points with six assists, while Gafford had 15 and Dereck Lively II 12 to go with eight rebounds. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

University president Joseph Harroz Jr. and athletic director Joe Castiglione both publicly backed Venables while speaking following a Board of Regents meeting in Norman, Okla. A 30-23 loss at then-No. 23 Missouri on Saturday dropped the Sooners' record to 5-5 overall, 1-5 in the Southeastern Conference. Oklahoma has dropped four of its past six games following a 3-0 start. Harroz said, ""We all get emotional over during the course of a season. What's unwavering is the commitment to him. This is a new era for us, but it's also a new era for college athletics, and there's going to be a lot of adjustment, and there's going to be a lot that takes place. As far as my commitment to Coach Venables, it's 100 percent."" Castiglione said, ""Obviously the season thus far has not gone as we'd hoped or planned. We're mindful that we haven't met the Oklahoma standard for 2024. That said, we truly believe in Coach Venables and our team and are completely focused on both supporting them and looking at all of the ways to address the needed improvements now as soon as possible as well as in preparation for next year."" Venables, 53, owns a 21-15 record over his three seasons in charge of the Sooners. He never previously served as a head coach, having served as defensive coordinator at Oklahoma and Clemson. He is under contract through 2029, and a buyout following the current season would cost the school $44.8 million, according to The Oklahoman newspaper. The Sooners are off this week ahead of their final two regular-season games: at home against No. 10 Alabama on Nov. 23 and at No. 23 LSU on Nov. 30. Losses in both games would leave Oklahoma with a sub-.500 and out of the bowl picture for the first time since 1998. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Jordan Eberle logged two assists, and McCann also finished with two points. Seattle goaltender Joey Daccord made 38 saves. Sean Kuraly and Zach Aston-Reese each produced a goal and an assist for the Blue Jackets, whose losing streak reached six games (0-5-1). Kevin Labanc assists on both tallies, and Elvis Merzlikins stopped 28 of 32 shots. The Kraken outshot Columbus 20-8 in the second period while taking control. Kartye got the Kraken on the board at 2:50 of the period, taking a pass from Andre Burakovsky with his back to the net at the top of the crease and putting a spinning backhander between Merzlikins' pads. Tanev tied the score at 7:13 on a two-on-one rush with Yanni Gourde. Tanev sped down the right wing, cut laterally through the slot and beat Merzlikins with a wrist shot. The Kraken took the lead on Tolvanen's power-play goal just 10 seconds later, after Labanc was sent to the penalty box for roughing. Seattle's Jared McCann won a faceoff in the offensive zone and got the puck to Eberle along the goal line on the left wing. Eberle fired a pass across the top of the crease, and Tolvanen tipped it in near the far post. The assist gave McCann 200 career points with the Kraken, making him the first to reach that mark with the franchise. Borgen, a defenseman, made it 4-2 at 13:34, converting a wrist shot from the high slot on an odd-man rush for his first goal of the season. The Blue Jackets outshot Seattle 18-6 in the first period while taking a 2-0 lead. Columbus opened the scoring at 13:46 of the period as Aston-Reese's shot from the top of the left faceoff circle deflected off Eberle's stick and hit Kuraly, stationed at the top of the crease, in the back of the left leg.

The early road futility is tied with Nashville and Columbus for fewest in the NHL. But if history is any indication, Vegas' fortunes could change significantly this week. That's because the road trip, which concludes Friday night in Salt Lake City against the Utah Hockey Club, has been designated as this year's ""Dad's Trip"" for the Golden Knights. Vegas is 9-0-1 all-time in games played on these trips. ""The simplest answer to me is that everyone wants to make their parents proud,"" Golden Knights coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""I think our guys want to win for their dads. I think it is as simple as that."" The player's fathers will sit together wearing their son's jerseys. They also get to sit in on meetings, attend practices and have team meals together. ""It's very exciting,"" forward Brett Howden said. ""It's fun for all the dads to be around and obviously have a little buzz going with all the excitement. It's just fun to see all the dads."" The Golden Knights, who are one point behind the first-place Los Angeles Kings in the Pacific Division, can definitely use a little pick-me-up. Their eight-game home winning streak, which matched a franchise record, ended Monday with a 5-2 loss to Carolina. Vegas, which was outshot 16-4 in the opening period, fell behind 4-0 in the first 26:13 and didn't score until the 6:11 mark of the third period on a goal by Jack Eichel goal. Starting goaltender Adin Hill became the first Golden Knights goalie to be pulled from a game this season after yielding four goals on 21 shots. ""When it's 4-0, it's tough to come back,"" center William Karlsson said. ""It always sucks when a goalie has to come out of the nets."" ""I wouldn't put it on Hilly,"" Cassidy said. ""I'm not putting any of the game on Hilly. It was just about changing the momentum."" Anaheim snapped a four-game losing streak with a 4-2 victory over Columbus on Sunday as John Gibson made 38 saves in his season debut. The 31-year-old Gibson, who picked up his 194th career win, had been sidelined while recovering from emergency appendectomy surgery on Sept. 25. ""I played catch-up a lot (during) training camp and the last few weeks,"" Gibson said.

It marked just the second time this season that Anaheim, which has scored an NHL-low 31 goals, scored four goals in a game. ""We've been trying to bingo-ball lines together,"" Cronin said. ""Try and create some identity within the lines, which would obviously strengthen our team identity.

Part of USC's offensive discipline has included limiting turnovers, with a combined 15 through two games. Effective ball movement has resulted in balanced scoring, with Wesley Yates III, Chibuzo Agbo, Desmond Claude and Matt Knowling all showing early breakout potential. UT Arlington (1-1) comes in with Jaden Wells, Raysean Seamster and Troy Hupstead putting up points through two games.

Coming off a 3-2 overtime victory against the Nashville Predators on Monday, the Avalanche have won the first two games of a four-game homestand that wraps up on Friday night. By then, Colorado could nearly have its full complement of forwards. Jonathan Drouin, who has been out since sustaining an upper-body injury in the Avalanche's season opener back on Oct. 9, is close to returning, as is Miles Wood. Wood has missed the past six games with an upper-body injury, but both players were skating in regular jerseys during practice on Tuesday.  Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said that he would talk to team trainers before making a final decision on the duo. Colorado assigned forwards T.J. Tynan and Nikita Prishchepov to the AHL, which could indicate that Wood and Drouin will be in the lineup on Wednesday.  Valeri Nichushkin, who has been suspended since this past spring, is eligible to return on Friday and is expected to be in the lineup. He was placed in Stage 3 of the Player Assistance Program during last season's playoffs. That leaves Ross Colton (foot) and captain Gabriel Landeskog (knee) as the only top-six forwards on the shelf for the Avalanche.  The Avalanche have stayed above water despite all the injuries largely due to the performances of stars Nathan MacKinnon and Cale Makar, who are among the NHL's point leaders. Makar's defensive partner, Devon Toews, has struggled a bit, but Bednar said he has not felt fully healthy all season. ""(Toews) at 80 percent is still better than lots of other players in the league,"" Bednar said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Andrew Carr led Kentucky (3-0) with 17 points, while Oweh chipped in 15. Amari Williams added 10 points and eight rebounds for the Wildcats, who finished on an 8-2 run after trailing by as much as 10 in the first half. Duke (2-1) was led by freshman phenom Cooper Flagg's 26 points and 12 rebounds. Kon Knueppel added 14 points, and Tyrese Proctor put up 12. Khaman Maluach tallied 10 points and seven rebounds in the loss. Carr's three-point play tied the game at 67 with 3:57 left before Oweh's layup at the 2:40 mark gave the Wildcats their first lead since just past the midpoint of the first half. Flagg answered with a three-point play, but Carr matched him on the next possession, as his three-point play put Kentucky ahead 72-70 with 1:49 remaining. Flagg then tied the game with a floater with 1:14 left before the Wildcats' Kerr Kriisa missed a jumper, which was rebounded by Flagg. On the ensuing possession, Oweh stole the ball from Flagg, then knocked down two free throws after being fouled by Knueppel. Flagg then dribbled out of bounds, and Kentucky made three free throws in the final five seconds to ice the game. Flagg opened the game's scoring on the receiving end of an alley-oop from Caleb Foster before Proctor's layup put Duke ahead 4-0. With 16:21 left in the half, Oweh drilled a 3-pointer to give Kentucky a 9-8 advantage -- the Wildcats' first lead of the game. Duke took the game's only double-digit lead on the second of Maluach's back-to-back buckets with 2:40 remaining before the break. Williams' free throw cut Kentucky's deficit to 44-37 with 1:48 left before Knueppel's mid-range jumper capped the first-half scoring, giving Duke a 46-37 lead at intermission. Oweh's 3-pointer and Williams' hook shot cut Duke's lead to four to start the second half. Flagg and Maluach's back-to-back layups extended Duke's advantage to 54-45 with 14:16 left. Koby Brea's triple and Lamont Butler's three-point play trimmed Kentucky's deficit to 56-53 at the 11:18 mark. Mason Gillis' floater and Flagg's triple extended Duke's advantage to eight with 10:21 left. From there, an 8-2 Kentucky run that included six straight points from Brandon Garrison cut the deficit to two with 6:49 remaining. --Jack Batten, Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Mason Plumlee recorded a double-double of 15 points and 14 rebounds starting in place of an injured Jusuf Nurkic (ankle) for Phoenix, who was also without All-NBA forward Kevin Durant out for a second game due to a calf strain.  Despite missing two starters, Phoenix pounced on Utah early.  The Suns only trailed momentarily in the first quarter before going on a 15-4 run that opened up their first double-digit-point lead of the night. Phoenix's advantage grew to as many as 18 in the second quarter.  Utah, seeking its first win at home this season, chipped away at the deficit in the second half. Jordan Clarkson connected on a pair of 3-pointers in the final minute, both of which pulled the Jazz to within six, but they could get no closer.  Phoenix's 15-of-20 to 7-of-9 edge at the free-throw line helped keep Utah at arm's length. The Suns also benefited from outgunning the Jazz beyond the 3-point arc on a night both teams shot well from deep.  Beal, who shot 4-of-7, and Booker at 5-of-9 helped Phoenix to an 18-of-39 performance (46.2 percent) from long range. Grayson Allen came off the bench to knock down 4-of-9 beyond the arc, part of his 15 points.  Clarkson's 4-of-9 night led Utah to 15-of-38 shooting (39.5 percent) from 3-point range, including the two down the stretch. Clarkson finished with 16 points off the bench. Jazz rookie Kyle Filipowski added 18 off the bench and Lauri Markkanen scored 17. Utah also got a big second-half effort from John Collins, who scored six straight points over a stretch midway through the fourth. Collins' flurry, part of a team-high 29 points, could not make a dent with Devin Booker answering with five points during the stretch and Royce O'Neal hitting a 3-pointer that pushed the Phoenix lead to 13.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After making 19 3-pointers in each of its first two games, Utah (3-0) wasn't quite as prolific from the perimeter, but shot well (14-for-30) and controlled the backboard throughout the game. Sharavjamts, a junior guard attending his third college and the first Mongolian to play Division I basketball, scored a career-high 19 points on 8-for-11 shooting, including 3-for-4 from long range.

Bryce Cash tallied 11 points, and Asjon Anderson and Jaxon Pollard each scored 10 for Queens, which pulled within 41-31 at intermission. After Ashby's 3-pointer pulled Queens to within 41-34 in the opening minute of the second half, the Utes effectively put the game away with a 17-2 run. The burst included treys from Sharavjamts, Madsen and Little. Queens never worked closer than 14 points for the rest of the game. Utah never trailed, jumping to a 14-5 lead on a 3-pointer by Sharavjamts  five minutes into the game. Queens shot poorly to open the game, taking 13 minutes (and 5 of 21 from the field) to reach double figures in points.

The Grizzlies face the Lakers in Los Angeles this time, and the game will have a decidedly different feel from the one last week, when Memphis was a runaway 131-114 winner. Ja Morant was one of three Grizzlies with 20 points in the victory, but he departed in the third quarter due to a hip injury and has not played since. Considered week-to-week, he has no timetable for his return. With Morant a mere observer, Memphis still won its past two games, averaging 131 points in those contests. The most recent victory came Sunday on the road against the Portland Trail Blazers by a 134-89 count, as Jaren Jackson Jr. posted 20 points as one of seven Grizzlies scorers in double figures. The 45-point winning margin was the fourth largest in Memphis franchise history. It was the third consecutive game the Grizzlies had seven players score in double figures, all victories, and Jay Huff tied a franchise record for a bench player with six blocked shots. The Trail Blazers made just four of their 42 shots from 3-point range (9.5 percent). The impressive victory, led by Jackson on both the offensive and defensive ends, not only came without Morant, but Desmond Bane (oblique) and Marcus Smart (ankle) were also unavailable. ""Regardless of what our lineups are, I want (Jackson) to still carry that mentality of being a primary attack guy for us, and that's on me to make sure that he's feeling involved,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. The Lakers ended a rough 1-4 road trip with the loss at Memphis, but they have been better upon their return home. Los Angeles beat the Philadelphia 76ers 116-106 on Friday, then earned a 123-103 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Sunday. LeBron James recorded his third triple-double of the season, and second consecutive, in the Sunday contest by supplying 19 points, 16 assists and 10 rebounds. Anthony Davis scored 22 points but left in the third quarter after he was poked in the eye. He will return to face the Grizzlies on Wednesday. ""There's nothing I need to do,"" said Davis, who also had eye injuries twice toward the end of last regular season but has no interest in wearing protective eyewear. ""The next step is getting some more sleep and getting ready for (Memphis)."" Los Angeles guard D'Angelo Russell, who was moved into a reserve role after the road trip following some early-season struggles, missed practice on Tuesday due to an illness. While Los Angeles struggled on its road trip, it is 5-0 at home to begin the campaign. Accused at various points of his career of not being assertive in some late-game situations, James continues to cite the appeal of seeing his teammates have success. It apparently never gets old, even after 22 seasons. ""That's always been my basketball pleasure, being able to just kind of read the game and put the ball, like I said, for guys to just be able to just catch, shoot, layup, dunk, whatever it is,"" said James, who is averaging 23.2 points, 7.7 rebounds and 8.9 assists less than two months away from his 40th birthday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

New Jersey's Jack Hughes became the fastest player in franchise history to record 300 career points with a first-period goal.  Paul Cotter and Ondrej Palat provided insurance with late third-period tallies. Jesper Bratt and Dougie Hamilton each notched two assists to propel the Devils to their sixth win in their last eight games. Florida's Sam Reinhart scored on the power play for his team-leading 12th goal of the season.  Spencer Knight made 20 saves in his first start since Nov. 2 for the Panthers, who played without Sam Bennett (upper-body injury).  The teams will square off again on Thursday at the same venue. New Jersey took advantage of a Florida turnover at the offensive blue line to claim a 2-1 lead with 2:31 remaining in the second.  Meier skated in on a breakaway and wristed a low shot just above the pad of Knight for his seventh goal of the season.  Cotter's sharp wrist shot from the left circle sailed under the crossbar with 4:53 left in the third. The goal was Cotter's seventh of the season. Palat capped the scoring by finding the empty net with 1:02 to play, his third tally of the season. Skating near the left point, Bratt backhanded a saucer pass that Hughes converted deep in the right circle to open the scoring at 8:30 of the first. The Florida native's goal was his eighth of the season and fourth in his last four games. The Devils preserved that slim advantage by killing a 5-on-3 power play late in the first. Florida broke through at 8:41 of the second to forge a 1-1 tie. Uvis Balinskis' wrist shot from the point was deflected home by Reinhart, giving the latter seven goals in his last seven games. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

I have more followers than him, etc. And now (Friday) is going to be the most watched fight of this century, so I'm going to be the new money magnet."" Paul vs. Tyson will be streamed on Netflix.

After showing spurts of energy, including when Shawn Jones Jr. blocked a Lion at one end and was fouled while rising for a dunk at the other, Mississippi State endured a second-half drought of 4:19 without a field goal. Kam Burton (17 points) and Sam Hines Jr. (14) scored in double figures for the Lions (1-2), while Brody Rowbury grabbed nine boards. Mississippi State finished with a 41-37 rebounding advantage while committing 11 turnovers to Southeastern Louisiana's 19. KeShawn Murphy had 10 points and six rebounds for the Bulldogs. The Bulldogs started the season by scoring at least 95 points in two straight games, a program first. Early inconsistency kept them from coming untracked against the Lions. Mississippi State led by as many as 11 points in the first half but merely took a 40-37 advantage into the break. An RJ Melendez transition layup boosted the Bulldogs' lead to 40-29 with 2:21 remaining in the first half. But the Lions responded by scoring the next eight points, a run bookended by treys from Burton and C.J. Booker. Hubbard led all scorers with 14 first-half points, including a 3-for-5 effort from long range to stretch his streak of making at least one 3-pointer to 16 games. Burton was even hotter from deep, swishing 4 of 6 attempts from beyond the arc for his 12 first-half points. Southeastern Louisiana fell to 0-2 on its 10-game road trip. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

However, it was all Clemson from there, with Del Jones and Hunter each hitting a trey as the hosts scored 21 of the next 23 points to open up a commanding 71-56 advantage with 2:04 to play.

It was a close game early, with Eastern Kentucky pulling within a point at 11-10 on a Jordan Crawford 3-pointer with 15:51 remaining in the first half.  Clemson answered with a 7-0 run that included a Hunter dunk and 3-pointer.

Four of the top five teams reside in the Big Ten, with Oregon joined by No. 2 Ohio State, No. 4 Penn State and No. 5 Indiana in the second rankings reveal of the season. Texas moved into the No. 3 spot. Losses last week by Georgia, Miami (Fla.) and LSU assured a major shuffle from the initial 2024 playoff rankings revealed seven days earlier. Texas (8-1, 4-1 SEC) and Tennessee (8-1, 5-1) climbed to third and seventh, respectively. BYU remained undefeated and slid up to No. 6, while Oregon (10-0, 7-0 Big Ten) and Indiana (10-0, 7-0) are surprising flag-bearers for the Big Ten with two weeks remaining in the regular season. After the Hoosiers handled Michigan last week, they reached the bye week with an extra seven days to prepare for a visit to the Horseshoe to take on Ohio State (9-1). Oregon defeated Ohio State 32-31 on Oct. 12. A 12-team playoff debuts in December, opening the door to eight additional teams compared to the previous CFP bracket. Whereas even SEC teams with two losses would be all but eliminated from the original four-team playoff, No. 10 Alabama (7-2), No. 11 Ole Miss (8-2), No. 13 Georgia (7-2) and No. 15 Texas A&M (7-2) maintain a fighting chance to break into the 12-team bracket behind the current one-loss SEC teams. In the midst of the program's first 10-win season, Indiana first-year coach Frank Cignetti is attempting to author a season for the books. He said he realized quickly upon taking the job he was encountering a somber or defeated aura around the football program and vowed to shift it instantly. History sides with the Buckeyes, who play Northwestern at Wrigley Field on Saturday. Ohio State has won 29 consecutive games against Indiana with an average margin of victory of 37 points. The last win for the Hoosiers in the series was in 1988. Ohio State delivered Penn State its only loss this season, 20-13 on Nov. 2. The Nittany Lions are clear of their biggest regular-season obstacles on the schedule with trips to Purdue, Minnesota and a home game against Maryland left to play. A variable without a precise measure at the moment is how the CFP committee reconciles head-to-head carnage in power conferences. The answer should become more telling in future rankings. Georgia handed Texas its only loss but lost to Alabama and Ole Miss. The Longhorns still have a matchup with A&M on Nov. 30. Tennessee beat Alabama and visits Athens to challenge Georgia in one of the marquee matchups Saturday. Notre Dame (8-1) rides a seven-game winning streak into Saturday's game against Virginia before a potential playoff elimination game Nov. 23 with No. 24 Army (9-0, 7-0 American Athletic Conference) at Yankee Stadium. The Black Knights are 9-0 for the first time since 1996. Notre Dame lost to Northern Illinois 16-14 on Sept. 7. Miami (Fla.) lost to Georgia Tech 28-23 last week and dropped to No. 9 in the rankings. The Hurricanes missed the chance to surge ahead in the rankings and are now square with No. 14 SMU (8-1), but the Mustangs are the only undefeated team (5-0) in conference play and lost to BYU head-to-head on Sept. 6. An expanded playoff field could mean room for underdogs from outside the Power 4 conferences. Boise State (7-1, 4-0 Mountain West) remained at No. 12 in this week's rankings and shares the lead in the Mountain West with Colorado State.

Carolina is 9-1-0 in its last 10 games. The only blip in that stretch was a 6-4 loss to the Colorado Avalanche on Saturday in the first game of the Hurricanes' three-game road trip, but Carolina bounced back strongly in Monday's 5-2 win over the Vegas Golden Knights. Nine different Hurricanes collected at least one point against the Knights, as Carolina became the first team this season to score a road victory in Las Vegas. ""Every line is contributing ... Every team that I've been a part of here, depth has always been our strong suit,"" said Hurricanes forward Jordan Martinook, who is on a four-game scoring streak (five goals, one assist). ""Obviously, we're showing it at the beginning of the year and we're going to need to continue that throughout the rest of the year. When everybody is chipping in, it's easy and a lot of fun."" This roster-wide production has resulted in at least four goals scored in each of Carolina's last nine games. The Hurricanes are two games away from tying their franchise record for the most consecutive games with four or more goals. Martin Necas has emerged as the focal point of the well-rounded attack. Necas is among the NHL's leaders with 24 points, with 21 of those points (seven goals, 14 assists) coming over the forward's ongoing 10-game points streak. In contrast, Utah players collectively amassed only 19 points over the team's four-game road trip, resulting in a 1-2-1 record and two shutout losses. The Utah Hockey Club outshot the Nashville Predators by a 27-21 margin on Saturday but allowed two power-play goals and an empty-netter in a 4-0 loss. ""I think defensively we played good enough, but ... we need a way to generate more offense without sacrificing our defense. That's urgent for us,"" Utah coach Andre Tourigny said. Avoiding the penalty box would be a good start, as Utah ranked among the league leaders in penalty minutes (174) entering Tuesday. On the other side of the special teams coin, Utah is 0-for-8 on the power play in its last four games, and 2-for-26 with the extra attacker in its last 10 games. After a 4-1-1 start, the Utah Hockey Club are only 2-5-2 in their last nine games. Clayton Keller leads Utah skaters with 13 points (six goals, seven assists). Nick Schmaltz is second on the team with 12 points all from assists, as Schmaltz has yet to score in 15 games this season. Connor Ingram remains Utah's top goaltender, though backup Karel Vejmelka could get more action if Ingram can't turn things around. Ingram has only a 3.40 goals-against average this season in 12 starts. Pyotr Kochetkov is expected to start again in Carolina's net, and has thrived with an increase in playing time. With Frederik Andersen recovering from a lower-body injury, Kochetkov is 7-0-0 with a 2.28 GAA in his last seven games. The Utah Hockey Club are 3-2-1 on home ice this season. The Hurricanes have been one of the NHL's best road teams, posting a 6-2-0 away record. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Vanderbilt comes off Sunday's 85-76 win over Southeast Missouri State, while the Bears (making their first road trip) beat Cal Poly 91-73 last Thursday. As expected under new coach Mark Byington, the Commodores have played fast (36th nationally in average possession length, according to KenPom.com), spread out the playing time (nine players average at least 16 minutes, but none more than 27.5) and shot a lot of 3-pointers (59). What was unexpected: Vanderbilt ranks 345th nationally in 3-point percentage at just 18.6 percent. Six-foot-7 Boston College transfer Devin McGlockton (19.0 ppg, 16.0 rpg, 3.0 bpg) has registered double-doubles in both contests while shooting 73.7 percent from the floor. ""I feel like we still have a lot to prove and we'll prove them wrong,"" McGlockton said. ""I've been playing center my whole life, four and five, so I'm pretty comfortable there and especially against taller and slower defenders I feel like I have an advantage."" Reserve guard Tyler Tanner has also been a nice surprise. He leads all freshmen nationally with seven steals. As for Cal, a pair of backcourt transfers -- Jovan Blacksher Jr. (17.5 ppg, 3.5 rpg) and Andrej Stojakovic (15.5 ppg, 6.0 rpg) -- make the Bears go. Blacksher is the team's best 3-point shooter, canning 50 percent of a team-high 14 tries, while Stojakovic has led the team at the foul line (12-of-14 shooting). The Bears fell in an early 17-5 hole against a fast-paced Cal Poly team last time out, something they'll not want to repeat against a Vanderbilt team that also prefers a quickened pace. ""We got off to a slow start defensively,"" coach Mark Madsen said after that game. ""I had to burn a timeout. I got after the guys and they really responded. I was incredibly proud of our players for the response to Cal Poly just coming out and absolutely blitzing us from the start of the game."" It'll be a reunion for several people on both sides. Cal's Mady Sissoko (6.5 ppg, 5.5 rpg) and Vanderbilt's A.J. Hoggard (11 points, four assists in his season debut vs. SEMO) played together at Michigan State the previous four seasons. Associate head coach Adam Mazarei spent 2019-23 at Vanderbilt before leaving for Cal last season. Joining Cal this season is Lee Dort (6.0 ppg, 8.5 rpg), who spent his previous two seasons at Vanderbilt, where he logged 118 minutes over 18 games. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Seton Hall's first two games with an overhauled roster have not been as fruitful. Seton Hall will look to bounce back from a stunning defeat and Hofstra will aim to remain perfect Wednesday night, when the teams meet in the second game of the ""Icons of the Game"" doubleheader at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y. Seton Hall has been off since Saturday, when the Pirates suffered a 57-56 loss to visiting Fordham in South Orange, N.J. Hofstra last played Friday, when the host Pride beat Iona 90-76 in Hempstead, N.Y. Fordham's Jackie Johnson III sank a floater at the buzzer to hand Seton Hall (1-1) its first nonconference regular-season loss at the on-campus Walsh Gymnasium since 1989. But it was the second straight frustrating outing for the Pirates, who return just three scholarship players -- starting guard Dylan Addae-Wusu, forward Isaiah Coleman and little-used forward David Tubek -- and 18.7 percent of the scoring from last season's NIT champions. Seton Hall, which was picked to finish 10th in the 11-team Big East, needed to mount a second-half comeback to edge Saint Peter's 57-53 in the season opener Nov. 4. The Pirates last scored fewer than 60 points in consecutive games on March 9-10, 2022. ""Two games in a row teams outscrapped us, which is not good,"" Seton Hall head coach Shaheen Holloway said. ""That's kind of what we do. But we'll get better, we'll learn from this. And when we put it together, it'll be really good."" The adjustment process has gone smoother thus far for Hofstra (2-0), which was picked to finish fourth in the 14-team Coastal Athletic Association. The Pride, whose campus is located across the street from Nassau Coliseum, returned just 15.8 percent of the scoring from last season's 20-win squad. But the new rotation has jelled for Hofstra, which had five double-digit scorers in each of the first two games. Jaquan Sanders, who spent the previous two seasons at Seton Hall, is 10-of-21 from 3-point land while Jean Aranguren, an Iona transfer, flirted with a triple-double Friday (18 points, nine rebounds, nine assists) as the Pride led nearly wire-to-wire. ""We're still a work in progress,"" said Hofstra head coach Speedy Claxton, who played for the school from 1996-2000 before seven seasons in the NBA. ""We're getting there. We're getting there. I'm happy with where we're at right now."" This will be just the sixth all-time meeting between the schools, which are located about 50 miles apart, and the first since Seton Hall earned a 60-58 win on Dec. 31, 1970. The Pirates lead the series 4-1. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Now an assistant for the Red Raiders, Linder will reconvene with his former team on Wednesday when the Cowboys visit Lubbock, Texas. Linder was Wyoming's head coach for four seasons before suddenly departing in May, reportedly suggesting that the lack of name, image and likeness opportunities within the program was a major factor. He joined longtime friend Grant McCasland's staff at Texas Tech. It was later revealed that in exchange for losing Linder, Wyoming would receive a $300,000 guarantee from Texas Tech for playing one game in Lubbock this season and another one next season. Wyoming will also receive $500,000 for playing at Texas Tech in football in 2028. The Cowboys quickly found a new coach in Sundance Wicks, who was the Joe B. Hall National Coach of the Year at Green Bay last season. Having spent three seasons (2020-23) as Linder's assistant at Wyoming, Wicks said there are no hard feelings toward his former boss. ""I just love him. He's the reason why I'm here,"" Wicks told Pokes Insider. ""I'll never take that for granted. Highly grateful, will always be. I love his family. His kids are great, wife's great."" Coming off last year's 15-17 finish, the Cowboys are 2-0 this season after solid wins over Concordia-St. Paul and Tennessee State. Guard Obi Agbim leads Wyoming with 24.5 points per game and has made 7 of 9 3-point attempts, while Jordan Nesbitt averages 13 points and 11.5 rebounds. Texas Tech (2-0) received votes in Monday's AP Top 25 poll after cruising to home wins over Bethune-Cookman and Northwestern State. The Red Raiders have won 32 straight nonconference home games. New Mexico transfer JT Toppin, the younger brother of NBA veterans Obi (Indiana) and Jacob (New York), has averaged 22 points and 7.5 rebounds for Texas Tech.

Garcia is averaging 27 points and 7.5 rebounds and is shooting 66.7 percent (20 of 30) from the field. His absence would rate as a huge loss for Minnesota. ""The biggest thing with a groin or those types of injuries is you just want to be really smart,"" Golden Gophers coach Ben Johnson said Tuesday. ""We'll rely on him and our (team doctor). ... If he can go, great, that means he's feeling good. If he can't, we'll figure it out like we always have."" In Minnesota's 80-57 opening win over Oral Roberts, Garcia had 30 points and eight rebounds. He followed that up with 24 points and seven rebounds in Saturday's 68-64 victory over Omaha. Garcia had an impact against Omaha despite foul trouble. Fellow big man Trey Edmonds stepped up with 12 points in 18 minutes off the bench. ""It was a physical game for sure,"" Edmonds said. ""It wasn't going to be a sweet or easy game we can just stroll into. ... Coach got on us a little bit, but in the second half we came out with more fire."" Starting guard Mike Mitchell Jr. (sprained ankle) was injured in the second half against Omaha. Johnson said Mitchell could miss two weeks.

It was the first time the Mean Green won by 40 or more since a 116-62 rout of Mississippi Valley State early in the 2020-21 season. ""I love how our team celebrates each other."" North Texas coach Ross Hodge said. ""They genuinely celebrate each other's success and root for each other. That's a really good trait to have."" Atin Wright tallied 16 points in both games and leads the Mean Green in scoring. Jasper Floyd is averaging 14 points and Johnathan Massie is contributing 12.5 points and 8.0 rebounds. North Texas has never faced Minnesota but has enjoyed impressive recent success against Big Ten opponents. The Mean Green were a No. 13 seed when they notched a 78-69 first-round upset of Purdue in the 2021 NCAA Tournament for the school's first-ever March Madness victory.

Nebraska (2-0) won on Saturday despite hitting only 34.5 percent of its field goal attempts, including a miserable 18.2 percent (4-of-22) on 3-pointers, and committing 18 turnovers. Only the fact that the Cornhuskers made 21 of 26 shots at the foul line helped them avoid an embarrassing upset. Brice Williams has been Nebraska's top scorer so far, averaging 18.5 points per game despite shooting only 41.7 percent from the field. Meanwhile, the Knights (1-2) come in off a 96-70 loss Sunday at then-No. 15 Creighton. They managed to make only 35.8 percent of their field goals and were outmatched on the boards, giving up a 51-30 rebounding margin. Wasted in the outcome was a 19-point, eight-rebound effort from guard Terrence Brown. Through three games, Brown is averaging 20.3 points on 52.3 percent shooting from the field. His development into a go-to player doesn't surprise second-year coach Jack Castleberry. ""I think he can arguably become the best defender in this entire league and I think his jump shot is continuing to improve,"" Castleberry said. ""And he's just matured emotionally."" Dylan Jones (13.3 points per game) and Jo'el Emanuel (11.7) are also in double figures for FDU, which was picked for a third-place finish in the Northeast Conference. This will be the second meeting between the programs -- Nebraska beat visiting FDU 80-64 on Nov. 22, 2003. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

That was the message from general manager Joe Schoen, who said the coaching staff and front office is ""going to evaluate everything"" during the team's bye week. Schoen spoke to reporters following Tuesday's practice, which he said was a first during a bye week in three seasons under coach Brian Daboll. ""We'll start circling up with the coaches (Wednesday) and the rest of the week and see how we can look to turn the ship as we go forward the rest of the season,"" Schoen said. The Giants are tied with Jacksonville for the worst record in the NFL and own the league's lowest scoring offense at an average of only 15.6 per game. New York has averaged only 13.4 points during the current five-game losing streak, with the latest setback being a 20-17 overtime loss to Carolina in Germany in which Jones threw for 190 yards and no touchdowns while getting intercepted twice and posting a paltry 33.8 quarterback rating. Daboll declined on Monday to commit to Jones remaining the starting quarterback coming out of the bye, and Schoen echoed that sentiment a day later. Asked multiple times whether a potential change could be impacted by finances and the guaranteed money that would kick in should Jones suffer a major injury, Schoen insisted all decisions would be driven by what helps the Giants win games. ""It will be a football decision,"" Schoen said. ""Any decisions we make moving forward as we evaluate the roster and what we're doing for the final seven games will be football decisions."" The Giants will play host to Tampa Bay on Nov. 24, and the starting quarterback could be Jones, Drew Lock or former undrafted free agent Tommy DeVito. Lock was signed as a free agent last offseason, while DeVito played in nine games as a rookie last year following Jones' season-ending knee injury. Jones has completed 63.3 percent of his passes for 2,070 yards and eight touchdowns against seven interceptions. He is in the second year of a four-year, $160 million contract. He is due to earn $30 million in base salary in 2025, with $12 million becoming fully guaranteed on the fifth day of the league season. Jones' future with the franchise has come under increased scrutiny with Daboll and Schoen acknowledging that he might not be the starter this time next week. ""We have seven games left in this season and that's what we're focused on,"" Schoen said. ""I'm focused on 2024 and how we can get better these final seven games."" Daboll and Schoen have come under scrutiny, as well, with the Giants mired at the bottom of the standings in their third seasons with the franchise. Asked if he expected to return in 2025, Schoen simply stated, ""Yes."" However, when asked to evaluate Daboll, Schoen didn't offer a direct endorsement. ""We're 2-8. So, again, we're going to look at solutions,"" Schoen said. ""He's coming in every day. He's working hard. The team is staying together. ""He's done a really good job, the guys are competing, keeping the locker room together. Again, there's a lot of things that we can look at and we need to improve on and that's what we're going to do the rest of the week."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Houston center Alperen Sengun led the way down the stretch of a 107-92 victory by doing what he'd done in the previous three periods: dominate the paint. After Washington cut what had been a 16-point deficit to 86-80, Sengun scored on three consecutive possessions to quickly get the Rockets back on track. Sengun and the Rockets will host the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday. Sengun finished Houston's second straight win with 27 points and 17 rebounds for his eighth double-double this season. He shot 12-of-19 from the floor to continue an efficient run of offensive production. Sengun has shot better than 50 percent in four of the past five games -- all Houston wins -- and is averaging 21.2 points on 57.7 percent shooting during that span. The Rockets have cultivated scoring threats from the perimeter and slashing to the rim during their protracted rebuild. But in Sengun, they have a throwback big capable of thriving on the block and providing the Rockets a sense of calm when shots aren't falling and things are a bit too frenetic. Simply getting the ball in to Sengun and letting him work has become a viable offensive tactic. ""It's a luxury I talked about last year, having Alperen to always dump it in and kind of slow down a little bit,"" Rockets coach Ime Udoka said. ""I've been around some really good scoring bigs and that settles the team all the time. ""You don't want to be just perimeter-based or relying on pick-and-roll every time. It's great to have that option."" The Clippers' four-game winning streak was snapped with a 134-128 loss to Oklahoma City on Monday, but their burgeoning cohesion on offense was again on display. Paced by Norman Powell and his team-high 31 points, five Clippers scored in double figures against the Thunder. The Clippers had at least four double-digit scorers in each of the previous four games, with Powell leading six in double figures in wins over the Spurs and Kings. Powell (team-high 26 points per game), James Harden (20.8 points, 8.4 rebounds and nine assists) and Ivica Zubac (16.9 points, 12.8 rebounds) have been offensive mainstays. The emergence of Amir Coffey and Derrick Jones Jr., averaging 13 and 12.4 points over the last five games, respectively, has rounded out the Clippers' offensive attack. The Clippers required time and game reps to settle into an offensive rhythm without Kawhi Leonard (knee) and Paul George (now with the 76ers), their top two scorers last season. That it seemed to require only 11 games for the Clippers to discover their new offensive approach bodes well for a team that appeared cloaked in uncertainty when the season commenced last month. ""We want to make sure we hit the open guy, we hit the open man and we show we're sharing the basketball,"" Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. ""We've been doing that. We're starting to make 3s, we're starting to generate more 3s, and that's how we've got to play."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Dan Quinn was ready to lead his Washington Commanders into Thursday night's NFC East showdown in Philadelphia by Monday. ""I'm fired up about it. ... This is what division games should be -- an absolute blast,"" the first-year Washington coach said. ""Philadelphia and Washington battling for it? Hell yeah!"" The Eagles (7-2) have a five-game winning streak and overtook the Commanders (7-3) for first place in the division on Sunday, when Philadelphia demolished Dallas and Washington lost a nail-biter to Pittsburgh. Eagles coach Nick Sirianni was a little less psyched about the prime-time matchup, calling the quick-turnaround Thursday night games ""a pain in the butt to prepare for"" during his Monday press conference. ""It's just that everything gets crammed into a shorter amount of time,"" Sirianni said. ""So that's what we're working through right now, is I think a lot of guys will have big bags under their eyes at the end of the week, but we've got to do what we need to do as coaches to get the guys ready."" Philadelphia certainly looked ready for a Dallas squad playing without Dak Prescott, scoring 27 unanswered points in a 34-6 victory in Arlington, Texas. Jalen Hurts overcame two turnovers with four touchdowns (two passing, two rushing) before resting in the fourth quarter with many of the starters. The defense collected five takeaways and held the Cowboys to 146 total yards of offense -- the fifth straight game that the Eagles allowed 280 or fewer yards. The Philadelphia defense enters Week 11 ranked No. 2 in the NFL in yards allowed (274.1 per game) and tied for fifth in points allowed (17.9 per game). ""We've improved as a defense, but I know we feel we have a lot more to grow,"" Eagles linebacker Nakobe Dean said. ""I don't think you ever say that you have ‘arrived' as a defense. It doesn't work that way in this league."" The Philly defense will be tested by a rookie quarterback who has ""arrived."" No. 2 overall pick Jayden Daniels has completed 68.7 percent of his passes for 2,147 yards with nine touchdowns and just two interceptions through 10 starts, adding 464 yards and four scores on the ground. The Washington offense is tied for third in the NFL in scoring (29.0 points per game) and ranks fourth with 377.0 yards per game. The Commanders let a 10-point, second-half lead slip away against the Steelers, losing on Russell Wilson's 32-yard TD pass to new teammate Mike Williams with 2:22 to play. The loss stung, but right guard Sam Cosmi wanted to make sure it didn't linger and addressed the Commanders in the locker room after the game. ""I wanted them to know that what we have here is still special,"" Cosmi told reporters. ""Like no matter what, we still keep fighting."" The Commanders and Eagles will meet again in Week 16 in Landover, Md. Philadelphia has won five of the last six meetings, including season sweeps during the 2021 and 2023 campaigns. The Eagles welcomed starting left tackle Jordan Mailata (hamstring) back to practice this week. Cornerback Darius Slay and tight end Dallas Goedert are dealing with ankle injuries.

Recently acquired cornerback Marshon Lattimore (hamstring) did not practice with the Commanders on Tuesday.

The Red Wings have lost their past two games while being outscored 7-1, and the Penguins have lost three of their last four. Detroit fell 4-0 to the New York Rangers at home on Saturday after losing 3-1 to the Toronto Maple Leafs on the road in the Hall of Fame Game on Friday. There was one positive in the loss to the Rangers. The Red Wings actually had a pronounced shot advantage after being decisively outshot in most of their games this season. They had a 37-24 edge, but still could not dent New York goaltender Jonathan Quick. ""Stay with it,"" Detroit coach Derek Lalonde said of his message to the team. ""I know it sounds like a cliche but trust the process. I don't like the fact you play a game like that, and we don't have another crack at it (another game) until Wednesday. Guys will have to sit on this one for a little. ""I don't know if I've had a more frustrating hockey game while coaching for 30-plus years."" The Red Wings dominated in time in the offensive zone, hit goal posts and missed open nets. ""We definitely produced some looks and odd-man rushes,"" forward Patrick Kane said. ""Throughout the season you're going to have games like that. What we can take away is we created a lot and obviously we have to find a way to get pucks by the goalie."" Wednesday night's contest is the beginning of a four-game road trip that then takes Detroit to the West Coast with games in Anaheim, Los Angeles and San Jose. The Penguins were hammered 7-1 at home by the Dallas Stars on Monday night; they found themselves down 6-0 in the first period when they allowed six goals in a span of a little more than 16 minutes. ""They get a couple of fluky goals early in the first period, we get down that early, that many goals,"" Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said. ""Thought the rest of the period, we didn't play the game the right way. We were careless with the puck. We gave them some easy looks. They turned it into an insurmountable challenge."" Joel Blomqvist gave up three goals on the first eight shots and Alex Nedeljkovic could not stop the initial two shots he faced. ""There's not much to say when it's 6-0,"" Penguins captain Sidney Crosby said. ""You just have to go play through it. You can't quit. You can't give up. We put ourselves in that situation. We've got to keep playing and see what happens. So besides that, you can't change the period. It happened. We've got to find ways to play through it."" Evgeni Malkin leads the Penguins in scoring with five goals and 13 assists for 18 points. Crosby is second with 16 points, and his six goals tie Rickard Rakell for the team lead. Despite having only one goal, Lucas Raymond's 13 points leads the Red Wings, and captain Dylan Larkin sets the pace with nine goals.

The New Orleans Pelicans, meanwhile, keep absorbing injury after injury. The Pelicans and Thunder will face off Wednesday in Oklahoma City with both rotations looking drastically different from what the teams hoped for before the season. The game will be the first between the teams since Oklahoma City swept the first-round playoff series between the two last season. The latest blow to the Pelicans came Tuesday when the team announced that guard Jose Alvarado had been diagnosed with a left hamstring strain that will keep him out at least three weeks. Alvarado, who was injured in Monday's loss to Brooklyn, was already being thrust into a much bigger role than anticipated after the opening-night injury to starting point guard Dejounte Murray. ""It's tough, no doubt about it,"" Pelicans coach Willie Green said of the loss of Alvarado. ""We all feel for what Jose is going through right now. We're going to miss him on the floor, his spirit. He's one of our emotional leaders."" With Murray out a few more weeks with a fractured hand and Alvarado now joining him on the sidelines, the Pelicans figure to rely even more heavily on Brandon Boston to handle the ball. Boston had 10 assists, seven rebounds, three steals and just one turnover in Monday's loss, though was just 3-of-13 shooting from the field for seven points. ""He's a bright spot, as we're going through some turbulent times,"" Green said. ""He's stepping on the floor, taking full advantage of his opportunity. You saw his passing ability (vs. Brooklyn). He didn't have the scoring game he had been having, but he's affecting the game in other ways. His ability to play defense, his rebounding, making sharp passing, getting guys wide-open shots. It was good to see him execute at a high level."" Boston, who was acquired off waivers just before the season began, has 31 assists and just six turnovers so far. The Pelicans also remain without Jordan Hawkins, Herb Jones, CJ McCollum and Zion Williamson. New Orleans has lost five consecutive games and eight of their last nine. The Thunder are coming off Monday's 134-128 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. It was Oklahoma City's first game since Sunday's injury to Chet Holmgren. Holmgren (right iliac hip fracture) is expected to miss at least two months. Though the Thunder haven't suffered injuries at the same rate as New Orleans, the injuries Oklahoma City has sustained have been focused on the interior. Isaiah Hartenstein, Jaylin Williams and Kenrich Williams have yet to play this season, and now they'll be without Holmgren for an extended period. The injuries are forcing the Thunder to play differently, relying on much smaller lineups. ""I think what they lean back on is that they're highly competitive,"" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. ""They want to win, and they're highly connected, so they're gonna do whatever it takes to win, and they're gonna do it together."" In Monday's game, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jalen Williams handled much of the offensive load, combining for 73 points. ""It's just trusting each other to make extra plays, and not try to force stuff because (Holmgren is) out,"" said Jalen Williams, who is now the Thunder's de facto starting center. ""That's something that we had to do with (Hartenstein) playing."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The injury occurred in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 123-103 loss to the host Los Angeles Lakers, which was just Quickley's second game back after a pelvic injury in the season opener. Quickley will be reevaluated next week, the Raptors said. Quickley, 25, signed a five-year, $175 million contract in June, after originally joining the Raptors with RJ Barrett in the Dec. 30, 2023, trade that sent forward OG Anunoby and two others to the New York Knicks.

In three games this season, he's averaging 15.3 points, 4.0 assists and 2.0 rebounds, though he played just 14 minutes in the season opener before leaving with the pelvic injury.

Interim coach Benny Moss wasn't retained after the team finished 6-17 in the wake of Cliff Ellis' midseason retirement in December of last year.

Jayden Taylor is the only returning player that started most of last season, with 29 starts in 41 games while averaging 11.2 points.

Middlebrooks is averaging 13.0 points and 5.5 rebounds in their first two games, up from 5.7 points in 16.3 minutes per game off the bench last season. O'Connell made 22 starts, averaging 5.7 points per game as well. ""(Middlebrooks) is an energy guy,"" NC State coach Kevin Keatts said. ""I just think he's been around college basketball for so long that he sees the ups and downs. He understands the aspect of it, never getting too high, never getting too low. ""He understands that what's important is our team winning."" NC State has six players averaging double figures in scoring over their first two games. They opened their season with a 97-66 win over USC Upstate, led by 14 points from Bowling Green transfer Marcus Hill. Middlebrooks recorded 10 points and 10 rebounds in the win. They had a tougher go-around in their second game, an 81-72 win over Presbyterian. Taylor led the way with 19 points on 7-of-14 shooting while Middlebrooks came off the bench to score 16 points. The Chanticleers split their first two games, beating Western Michigan by four in their season opener before losing to East Carolina by four. Junior college transfer Rasheed Jones has led the team in scoring in both games, averaging 17.5 points per game. ""(Jones) can make one-on-one plays,"" Gray said. ""He can play in pick and roll.

""When you can experience that early, it helps as the season goes on."" The Demon Deacons will play Wednesday in their third home game after going to nearby Greensboro to defeat the Wolverines in a neutral-site game. The schedule can be worth savoring. ""We've got to fit them in since we start league play in early December,"" Forbes said of the nonconference outings. Wake Forest had good defensive stretches against Michigan, which didn't have a field goal in the last 3 1/2 minutes and had a scoring drought of more than five minutes in the second half. ""We turned them over 16 times, and our defense was consistent,"" Forbes said. ""You don't have to score a lot to win. You have to defend, rebound, and play tough."" Hunter Sallis had a team-high 18 points for Wake Forest, which on defense will have to pay attention to South Carolina Upstate guard Mister Dean, who has led his team in scoring in each of the first three games. He was named the Big South Conference's Freshman of the Week after averaging 19.7 points a contest. He is shooting 75.8 percent from the field this season. The Spartans will be in their third clash with an Atlantic Coast Conference team following losses at North Carolina State and Virginia Tech. They played their first three games across five days, with a rout of Piedmont in between visits to ACC sites. The early schedule is something South Carolina Upstate is embracing as well.

As Kentucky discovered in last year's NCAA Tournament, Oakland uses its zone defense and patient offense to limit possessions - and then knocks opponents out with its 3-point shooting.   ""We'll see a little different look than we did in our first two (games), which will be good for us,"" Underwood said. ""They gave us everything that we wanted last year.""   Indeed, Oakland showed up in Champaign last Nov. 10 and owned the lead with 10 minutes to play before falling to the Elite Eight-bound Illini by a 64-53 count.   While Illinois doesn't have any of its starters back from last year - guard Ty Rodgers has elected to redshirt this season - Oakland isn't much different. Senior point guard DQ Cole is the only returning starter currently playing.   With Kentucky killer Jack Gohlke and Blake Lampman having graduated, Cole has risen to become Oakland's top 3-point threat. He launched 15 3-pointers when Oakland played last Wednesday at Boise State. Alas, he made just one as Boise State cruised to an 87-43 win.   The Golden Grizzlies shot 3 of 26 from 3-point range as a team at Boise, which obviously can't repeat Wednesday if Oakland intends to knock off Illinois. But Kampe doesn't apologize for a non-conference schedule that also includes trips to Kansas and Arkansas along with a ""neutral"" game against Michigan State in Detroit.   ""I know a lot of our fans don't like hearing this,"" Kampe said. ""But, again, I say, we could play some really crappy teams. A lot of things would be different, but we wouldn't know how bad we were. We wouldn't know what we have to do to improve and get ready so we can compete for a conference championship. I like our team. We have a chance."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Authorities reportedly held Franco and an unnamed woman for questioning on Monday after an incident in the parking lot of an apartment complex on Sunday ""in which guns were drawn,"" per ESPN, which also reported the altercation with two men was over Franco's relationship with a woman who lived at the apartment complex. No one was injured in the incident, and none of those involved chose to press charges. When the police searched Franco's Mercedes-Benz at the time of the altercation, they found a Glock with its magazine and 15 rounds of ammunition but no registration papers. The gun was registered to a man Franco said is his uncle. The weapons charges could result in a maximum of sentence of 3-5 years and a fine. Franco was reportedly being held for questioning but is expected to be released while awaiting trial, though no bail terms or court dates were announced. Franco, 23, is already on indefinite administrative leave from Major League Baseball as he awaits trial on charges involving the sexual abuse of a minor. Under his bail agreement, Franco is not allowed to leave the Dominican Republic but is free to travel within the country as he awaits a Dec. 12 trial. Franco was in the midst of an All-Star season when he was placed on administrative leave in August 2023. He has not played since. According to reports, Franco faces up to 20 years in prison for charges of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation against a minor and human trafficking. Franco signed an 11-year, $182 million contract extension with the Rays in November 2021, just 70 games into his major league career.

Godwin suffered a dislocated left ankle in the Ravens' 41-31 victory over the Bucs on Oct. 21. Per reports, the NFL ruled Smith brought down the receiver with an illegal hip-drop tackle. Smith, 27, was not penalized for the hit during the game but was later fined $16,833 for unnecessary roughness, which the two-time All-Pro appealed. Godwin, who is set to become a free agent in 2025, had seven receptions for 65 yards in the Week 7 game prior to the injury that occurred with less than a minute to play. At the time, Godwin had an NFL-leading 50 catches for 576 yards -- third most in the league at the time -- and five touchdowns in seven games. The Bucs placed Godwin on injured reserve on Oct. 23, and he underwent surgery on the dislocated ankle the next day. Recovery is expected to take 10-12 weeks, meaning he will miss the entire regular season, though it is possible he could return for the playoffs. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Trojans have won their first two games by double digits -- 84-74 in the season opener against Toledo and 78-61 at New Orleans on Saturday. Arkansas (1-1) lost to then-No. 8 Baylor 72-67 on Saturday after beating Lipscomb 76-60 in the season opener on Nov. 6. Arkansas and Troy are near mirror images on defense, with the Razorbacks throwing a variety of full-court presses at opponents to speed up the game. Troy guards in the full court as well and will even press after an opponent's miss. ""We have to make the game a rock fight,"" Troy coach Scott Cross said. ""We'll win the majority of our games if we do that. If we try to be pretty and just outscore the other team, that's not when we are at our best."" Because they return 12 players from last season's team that posted a 20-win campaign for the third straight year, the Trojans are experienced. They have 100 combined starts on their roster from seven players, and 10 players have combined for 262 games played. ""There's not a lot of difference between starters and backups,"" said Cross, whose team was picked to finish third in the preseason Sun Belt Conference poll. ""I could have 100 million different starting combinations. The guys starting in there have been around the program and know what we want. But we have complete confidence in all our guys."" Jackson Fields leads four Trojans who average double figures in scoring with 12.5 points per game and a team-high 7.0 rebounds per contest. Tayton Conerway and Thomas Dowd each average 11.5 points, and Myles Rigsby is at 11.0. Similarities don't extend into roster construction, however. It's the first season at the helm of the Arkansas program for John Calipari, and the Hall of Fame coach has 13 newcomers -- seven transfers and six freshmen. Freshman guard Boogie Fland has lived up to his billing as a five-star recruit and leads Arkansas with an average of 17 points per game. Adou Thiero is coming off a monster game against Baylor in which he scored a game-high 24 points with six rebounds, two assists, two blocks and a steal. ""(Thiero) is in attack mode now,"" Calipari said. ""Instead of messing with the ball, he's in attack mode. Now he can get to where he needs to go. Probably got to get him to do a little stride-stop so if he gets stuck, he can turn and make plays for his teammates. That may be one of the things he can do for us."" Even though Arkansas enters Wednesday's game off a hard-fought loss, it's the type of challenge Calipari wants the Razorbacks to face early in the season as they prepare for Southeastern Conference play. ""You could play a team and try to win by 50,"" Calipari said. ""And what you learn is that you can beat that kind of team by 50. ""This (loss to Baylor) showed us some good stuff.

Fresh off a 74-69 upset Saturday night against then-ranked No. 4 Houston, Auburn coach Bruce Pearl was pleased with how his team responded through adversity after the team flight the day before had to be rescheduled due to a mid-air physical altercation between two Tiger reserve players, reported to be forwards Jahki Howard and Ja'Heim Hudson. The chartered flight took off from Auburn University Regional Airport for Houston at 2:40 on Friday afternoon but was diverted back to the airport about an hour later, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement. In audio obtained by CBS, the plane's pilot can be heard telling air traffic controllers that two players ""got into a physical alteration"" and that ""clothes were ripped.""  Neither Howard nor Hudson made the trip to Houston, but the Tigers overcame the altercation to post the upset. And Pearl was happy with the victory in what he called a ""physical"" game, in which the teams tied in rebounds at 33. ""It was outstanding,"" Pearl said. ""Let me tell you what I love about the game -- student-athletes, pay attention: That was as physical of a game as we're going to play. There wasn't one ounce of animosity, unsportsmanlike conduct, nothing.  ""Those guys [Houston] expected to get checked out, and our guys expected to get screens ... it would be like playing Bobby Knight or playing Indiana. You know what you're going to get. You know, when you're playing a Bobby Knight team, they may talk a little less (expletive), but you know what you're going to get."" While Pearl offered no immediate comment about his team's player altercation, attention quickly shifted toward the on-court action. The Tigers (2-0) were led by Tahaad Pettiford's 21 points, 15 of those coming in the second half to pull away from the Cougars late. Auburn's Johni Broome, who finished with 20 points, said the victory over Houston overcame the mid-air incident. ""You know, stuff happens,"" Broome said, per CBS. ""But at the end of the day, we came here to play basketball. Everybody was locked in with each other. We were our brother's keeper. We have a strong family here, and we came out here and won that basketball game."" Pearl described the game's atmosphere as a March-type feel in November, which he expects his team to endure throughout a non-conference schedule that will see Auburn play No. 7 Iowa State, No. 6 Duke, No. 21 Ohio State and No. 13 Purdue, as currently ranked, before Christmas. However, before getting to those games, the Tigers will take on the Golden Flashes (2-0), who have yet to play a power-conference opponent this season. Their fast start has included a win in the home opener against Miami-Hamilton last Friday, 98-53. Kent State saw strong performances from Cli'Ron Hornbeak and VonCameron Davis, who each scored 18 points. Kent State coach Rob Senderoff praised his team's offense, which had 24 assists. ""We shared the ball,"" Senderoff said after the game. ""That was a real focus. We've been that way every night so far. In our scrimmages and the two games we've played, our guys have really tried to help their teammates look as good as they can.""

St. John's (2-0) opened Pitino's second season with eight newcomers and posted a pair of blowout victories. The Red Storm started with a 92-60 win over Fordham on Nov. 4 but were sluggish in the opening minutes. Then St. John's was threatened even more in Saturday's 96-73 win over Quinnipiac. The Red Storm trailed by four at halftime against the preseason favorite from the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference but then shot 52.6 percent in a 61-point second half. ""Sometimes you get what you deserve,"" Pitino said. ""We had two of the worst practices that we've had all season. I told them it's going to bite you in the behind if you practice like that, and it did."" Ultimately, talent won out, and it is a scenario Pitino hopes to avoid again, especially since St. John's will host New Mexico on Sunday at Madison Square Garden and will face No. 12 Baylor next week in a tournament in the Bahamas with a field that includes No. 11 Tennessee and Virginia. While R.J. Luis led St. John's with 24 points and 13 rebounds vs. Quinnipiac, two other players continued their strong starts. Simeon Wilcher followed his 17 points against Fordham with 14 on Saturday, and Brady Dunlap finished with a career-high 20 in that matchup. ""Going into today's game, we had a couple of rough practices, so coach got into us at the start, but at the end he was like we just got to bounce back,"" Dunlap said. The Red Storm also won decisively without standout defensive player Aaron Scott, who is expected to return from an illness on Wednesday.

Ja'Kair Sanchez, a Division II transfer, scored 17 points to lead five in double figures. Tyje Kelton added 15 as the Seahawks scored 48 by halftime and were 15 of 29 from 3-point range.

Especially on defense. In their most recent game, the Volunteers dominated Louisville 77-55 on Saturday to improve to 2-0.   A key player in the victory was Jahmai Mashack, who scored only three points but grabbed seven rebounds in displaying his versatility as a defender.  Mashack also tallied three steals to help lead Tennessee's strong effort. ""I mean, he was just dominant,"" Tennessee coach Rick Barnes said of Mashack. ""And he does all the things that go into winning. And his effort was great. I thought everyone's effort defensively was there."" Tennessee forced Louisville to shoot only 26.7 percent from the field, and opponents are shooting only 34.8 percent against the Vols this season. Offensively, Tennessee has shown how dangerous it can be, especially with veteran guards Zakai Zeigler and Chaz Lanier leading the way. Zeigler scored 19 in the win over the host Cardinals, including 11 in the final 13 minutes, and is averaging 16.0 points per outing. Lanier, a fifth-year standout, leads the team at 18.5 points per game. He scored a season-best 19 against Louisville. Felix Okpara also scored in double figures, chipping in 10 points. Lanier told reporters after the game that the fact that Tennessee played so well on the road in a tough environment is huge for the program moving forward as it aims to contend for a title this season. ""It's just toughness,"" Lanier said. ""Bottom line is it just shows how tough we are."" Montana (2-1) dominated Northwest Indian College 94-44 on Sunday but now will face its biggest test of the year so far as it goes on the road to face a Southeastern Conference opponent. The Grizzlies allowed their fewest points since 2021 in Sunday's win and had a 50-26 rebounding advantage. Nine players scored for Montana, including Kai Johnson, who contributed a team-high 22 points. He is averaging a team-best 16.3 per game this season. The Grizzlies will face their second Power Five school of the year after losing 79-48 to Oregon in their opener on Nov. 8. Montana is feeling good about its direction but knows it's far from the team it wants to be at this point in the season. ""We've had a lot of guys in and out,"" Grizzlies coach Travis DeCuire said. ""We've had multiple guys miss a lot of practices. I think we're looking at three guys in the rotation that have missed 10 or more practices. For chemistry, for flow, that's playing a bit into where we're a little behind where we want to be right now."" Matching the Volunteers won't be easy, especially with Tennessee's ability to knock down 3-point shots in addition to the team's defensive toughness.  The Vols made 10 3-pointers against Louisville -- out of 19 attempts -- and have connected 18 times from 3-point range this season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

O'Brien said that Castellanos has decided to take a few days away from the team in the wake of the coach's decision. ""Tommy has done a great job for us,"" O'Brien said Tuesday. ""He's an awesome competitor. We have a lot of respect for Tommy. Obviously, he wasn't real thrilled."" After Castellanos limped off the field early in the third quarter last Saturday against Syracuse with an apparent leg injury, he was replaced by James. The sub was 5-of-6 passing for 51 yards and a touchdown but managed an offense that gained 313 rushing yards in the 37-31 win. Castellanos was 2-of-7 passing for 14 yards with a touchdown and interception when he came out of the Syracuse game. ""I think what's best for the team right now is for Grayson James to be the starter,"" O'Brien said.  Castellanos played in 13 games (12 starts) in 2023 and totaled 2,248 passing yards and 1,113 rushing yards to become the first 2,000-yard passer, 1,000-yard rusher in Boston College history. This season, he has completed 61.5 percent of his passes for 1,366 yards with 18 TDs and five interceptions. He's added 194 yards and a touchdown on the ground. James, a fellow junior, is in his first season with the Eagles after transferring from Florida International. In limited action with the Eagles, he has completed 24 of 38 pass attempts for 219 yards with two touchdowns and an interception. ""He was very poised (against Syracuse),"" O'Brien said about James. ""There was a couple things he'd like to have back like all of us, coaches and players alike.

Kalkbrenner, the Big East preseason player of the year, followed his career-high 49-point performance in the season opener against Texas Rio Grande Valley with 24 points in 22 minutes in the Bluejays' 96-70 victory over Fairleigh Dickinson on Sunday.  The fifth-year senior has made a staggering 90.6 percent (29 of 32) of his shots from the floor for Creighton (2-0).  For his efforts, Kalkbrenner was named the Big East Player of the Week on Monday for the first time in his career.  Steven Ashworth drained five 3-pointers to highlight his 15-point performance vs. Fairleigh Dickinson. Arizona State transfer Jamiya Neal scored 13 points and Texas Tech transfer Pop Isaacs added 12 on Sunday in his debut. Those strong performances -- along with a 36-8 run that spanned from the end of the first half into the start of the second -- allowed Creighton to pull away from Fairleigh Dickinson.  ""Stops (are) the biggest thing,"" Ashworth said, per the Omaha World-Herald. ""If we can string together a few stops in a row, it really puts pressure on the other team's defense to get back in transition, then guard us.""  Neal provided exclamation points with emphatic slams on Sunday. ""I think that's where I thrive the most,"" he said. ""I like to play in (transition) as much as possible. If I can get in those types of situations, I want to get that.""  Isaacs is still working out the kinks as he looks to rediscover his game following a torn hip labrum.  ""His timing and rhythm is not gonna be great, but it was good to have him out there and hopefully work some of those kinks out while continuing to feel a little bit better,"" Bluejays coach Greg McDermott said. Should Kalkbrenner and company hit on all cylinders on Wednesday, that likely would allow McDermott to etch his name in the team's record books. McDermott and Dana Altman (1994-2010) are tied with a program-best 327 wins. McDermott credited his team's defense for stepping up after he challenged his charges following the season opener.  ""Certainly a step in the right direction,"" McDermott said. ""That's what it's about this time of year, just trying to get a little bit better as we move day to day."" Houston Christian (1-1) has a tall task if it wants to bounce back from its 90-59 setback to then-No. 19 Texas on Friday.  Julian Mackey had 20 points on 6-for-12 shooting from the floor -- including 3 of 6 from beyond the arc.  Itawamba (Miss.) Community College transfer Bryson Dawkins followed his 18-point performance in Houston Christian's 86-59 season-opening win over Avila with 13 points on Friday. Huskies coach Craig Doty, in his first season, wrote on his X account just how impressed he was by his team's performance against a ranked team before a crowd larger than his squad is accustomed to seeing. ""We played with Texas for a half on the road in front of a crowd of 10,993 people,"" Doty wrote. ""It was a 3 point game with 2:08 remaining in the first half. A pair of second half 12-0 runs for the Longhorns put the game away as we got wore down by the size, strength, and NBA level talent of the #19 ranked team in country. ""It was a great environment for our student-athletes to compete in.""

You didn’t spend six hours a day watching basketball last week? Maybe it was just me. College hoops season is back in full force. November games may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but if you chose to watch election coverage instead of unwinding with some BYU vs. Central Arkansas, that’s on you. In case you missed it, here are 10 things to know about the first week of the season. Granted, it’s been a few seasons since Gonzaga earned a No. 1 seed or had a recognizable star like Drew Timme. But you’d better learn the names Ryan Nembhard, Graham Ike and Nolan Hickman, because the Bulldogs will be a national contender once more. They dusted No. 8 Baylor 101-63 on opening night and beat Arizona State on Sunday, shooting at least 50 percent both times. The wildest story of the weekend was the news that Auburn’s initial flight to Houston for a game against the Cougars had to turn around because two reserve players got into a fight. Who needs them? Freshman Tahaad Pettiford bombed in five threes, and the 11th-ranked Tigers outscored Houston 46-36 in the second half of Saturday’s win. Auburn is Kenpom.com’s No. 1 team after one week, which helps dull the pain the football team is causing them down there. After feeling slighted (and rightfully so) that the Big East got only three NCAA Tournament bids last March, league officials were hoping for better days in 2024-25. In one week, Villanova lost to Columbia, Butler lost to Austin Peay and Seton Hall lost to Fordham. I love the Big East, but even I have to admit this is a rough start. The Huskies’ goal of a national three-peat could be achievable. Alex Karaban, the lone returning starter from last year’s champions, has led UConn in scoring through two games and freshman Liam McNeeley had double-doubles in each contest. I’m looking forward to UConn’s three-game stretch against Baylor, Texas and Gonzaga in December. Staying in the Big East for a moment, it would be lazy of me to dub him “the next Zach Edey,” but that’s who Creighton 7-footer Ryan Kalkbrenner will remind casual college hoops fans of. A three-time Big East Defensive Player of the Year, Kalkbrenner put up a ridiculous 20-of-22 shooting performance for 49 points in the Bluejays’ season opener against UT Rio Grande Valley. He’s 3-for-3 from behind the arc through two games. Dangerous player. Duke has the No. 1 freshman in this year’s class, Cooper Flagg, a name you’ve surely heard by now and the favorite ahead of Kalkbrenner and others for the Wooden Award. Through two games, Duke’s leading scorer and top shooter is… Kon Knueppel, another freshman who’s thriving on Tobacco Road despite having one of the most Wisconsin names and faces of all time. The end of Kansas’ 2023-24 season was nearly unwatchable, so Jayhawks fans will take the progress shown in a 92-89 win over North Carolina, even if that game included a blown 20-point lead. It’s early. Everyone’s still figuring things out. Transfers Zeke Mayo and AJ Storr look to be crucial for making Kansas a deeper, better version of itself this year. Arkansas fans are unhappy about the first loss of the John Calipari era, but it came by five points to a higher-ranked Baylor team and freshman Boogie Fland is off to a great start. Calipari’s old Kentucky home racked up 103 and 100 points against two outmatched opponents, but a big test is waiting this Tuesday against Duke. The outside shooting in that game could be phenomenal. St. John’s dusted Fordham and Quinnipiac, the latter the preseason favorite in the MAAC, and ran up the score in the second half both times. When one guard (Kadary Richmond) is off his game on offense, another (RJ Luis Jr., Simeon Wilcher, Deivon Smith) seems primed to take over. Rick Pitino probably isn’t going to call this team unathletic anytime soon. The Ospreys of the Atlantic Sun Conference are 3-0 with two big upsets on their ledger. After taking down South Carolina on opening night, they beat Georgia Tech 105-93(!) on Sunday. It’s a wonderful surprise from longtime coach Matthew Driscoll, whose previous claim to fame was the guy who screamed “Let’s go!” for too long and got turned into a gif. Copyright 2024"

He was a joyful, kind young man who lit up every room he entered,"" FC Cincinnati said in a team statement. ""Our entire club grieves this tragedy, and we are thinking of and praying for his family. He was a cherished member of the FC Cincinnati family, and he will be missed."" Angulo joined Cincinnati in December 2022 from Independiente de Valle in Ecuador and was part of Cincinnati's 2023 team that won the Supporters' Shield, paying in 24 matches (nine starts) and posting two assists. He was with LDU Quito the entire 2024 season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

As part of the shakeup, offensive coordinator Shane Waldron was fired on Tuesday. Waldron received a vote of confidence eight days ago after a lopsided 29-9 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, but head coach Matt Eberflus indicated he was resigned to change on Monday.  ""After evaluating our entire operation, I decided that it is in the best interest of our team to move in a different direction with the leadership of our offense,"" Eberflus said in a statement released by the team. ""This decision was well-thought-out, one that was conducted deliberately and respectfully. I would like to thank Shane for his efforts and wish him the best moving forward."" Eberflus selected Waldron as offensive coordinator from a pool that included former Cardinals head coach Kliff Kingsbury. Eberflus was retained as head coach by general manager Ryan Poles in January following a 7-10 season. The present situation isn't entirely unfamiliar to Brown. He is being bumped into the primary play-calling role for the second consecutive season. In 2023, the 38-year-old was promoted by the Carolina Panthers with embattled coach Frank Reich giving Brown the call sheet in an effort to spare his own job and pump life into their rookie No. 1 pick at quarterback, Bryce Young.  The Bears are in a bind with the Packers (6-3) up next as confidence and production bottom out on the heels of three consecutive losses and a three-game streak during which rookie No. 1 pick Caleb Williams has zero touchdown passes.  Eberflus said Monday that Williams was safe as the starting quarterback but pointed to imminent changes around the rookie. Williams and the Bears were dominated by the New England Patriots (3-7) on Sunday. They carry a run of 23 consecutive possessions without a touchdown into Week 11 trying to keep pace with the rest of the NFC North. Eberflus is 0-4 against Green Bay in his first two seasons as Bears head coach and will see the Packers, Lions (8-1) and Vikings (7-2) twice in the final two months of the season.  The Bears have 27 total points during a three-game slide that began with rookie Jayden Daniels' 52-yard, game-winning Hail Mary on Oct. 27.  Chicago produced three points against the Patriots, putting up fewer than 17 points for the fifth time this season. New England sacked Williams nine times one week after the Cardinals posted six sacks against Chicago. Brown, a former NFL running back who broke into coaching under Sean McVay with the Rams, spent nine seasons on college football staffs including three years as Miami (Fla.) running backs coach and offensive coordinator.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Owner Jerry Jones said Prescott is set for surgery Wednesday in New York. Jones said on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas that quarterback Cooper Rush will start Monday's game against the visiting Houston Texans. Trey Lance will serve as the backup while the team is expected to add fellow quarterback Will Grier to the practice squad. Jones provided optimistic news on Prescott having his surgery in New York. ""He had a good visit last night and he wants to do that there, and he's got great medical doctors up there,"" Jones said. ""His prognosis is wonderful, it just means we're not going to have him the rest of the year."" Signed to a four-year, $240 million contract extension in September that made him the highest-paid quarterback in NFL history, Prescott threw for 1,978 yards with 11 touchdowns and eight interceptions in eight games this season.  Prescott, 31, led the NFL in completions (410) and touchdowns (36) last season. He threw for 4,516 yards in 17 games as Dallas finished the regular season 12-5. A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Prescott owns a 76-46 record in 122 career starts since being picked by Dallas in the fourth round of the 2016 NFL Draft. He has thrown for 31,437 yards with 213 touchdowns and 82 interceptions. Rush flopped in his first start of the season on Sunday, one week after Prescott sustained his injury during the third quarter of a 27-21 loss to the Atlanta Falcons.  Rush completed 13 of 26 passes for 45 yards and lost two fumbles as Dallas dropped its fourth straight game, a 34-6 setback to the Philadelphia Eagles.  Rush was replaced in the fourth quarter by Lance, who went 4-for-6 for 21 yards with an interception in his first regular-season action since being acquired by the Cowboys in 2023.   But the Cowboys (3-6) are turning back to Rush for the Monday night game against the Texans (6-4). ""Because Cooper has shown that he has the capability to compete and win games,"" Jones said. ""And he does give us our best chance. Frankly that was really an out-of-character game for him based on what we've seen.""  Rush, 30, has completed 35 of 62 passes for 212 yards and a touchdown in parts of five games this season.  He has completed 59.7 percent of his passes for 1,831 yards with nine touchdowns and six interceptions in 31 career games (seven starts) with Dallas. Grier, 29, had been with the Cowboys in 2021-22 before being released prior to the 2023 season. He completed 28 of 52 passes for 228 yards in two starts during the 2019 season with the Carolina Panthers. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Anybody that gladly took them up on the offer in a game against the Miami Dolphins ended up with indigestion. It was the offense that was supposed to carry the Rams into a new era, but Los Angeles head coach Sean McVay couldn’t get his group over the line in a 23-15 loss Monday. With a fourth consecutive victory there for the taking, the Rams did not score a touchdown behind quarterback Matthew Stafford. Any ideas of rallying from a dreadful 1-4 start and into the playoffs have been put on pause with the current 4-5 record. Stafford has played 50 regular-season games with the Rams. He has now failed to orchestrate a touchdown drive in just two of them. “It was a little bit of this and a little bit of that,” Stafford said of the team’s issues on offense. “We did some really good things and weren’t good enough in some areas. I would say that we were inconsistent.” The Rams were supposed to be about the offense this season, and if anybody wondered why, they just needed to look toward the stands Monday. All-superhero defensive tackle Aaron Donald was in attendance to watch his former teammates, looking as chiseled as ever in retirement. A young Los Angeles defense was supposed to go through growing pains this season, and the offense, filled with elite skill players, was set to move things forward. Well, if Donald was impressed with any group, it was with his former defense. Miami won with just 238 yards of total offense, well below the Rams’ 327 yards. The Dolphins got the job done despite just 208 yards passing and an interception from Tua Tagovailoa. So while the Rams have Stafford, wide receivers Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp and running back Kyren Williams, there is a new group of players looking for top billing. Edge rusher Byron Young and defensive tackle Kobie Turner played as rookies alongside Donald in his final season. Edge rusher Jared Verse and defensive tackle Braden Fiske were drafted after Donald announced that his playing days were done. The Rams already had a Fearsome Foursome in the 1960s, and while this base defense is not the same as that one, the current young group can still be known as the Ferocious Foursome as it continues to progress. Can the Rams still make the playoffs? The loss Monday gave them a playoff probability of 13 percent. Just another sign of their bad luck. Los Angeles built hopes after a rough start that was mostly due to a flood of injuries on offense, including Nacua and Kupp, not to mention multiple starters on the offensive line. But center Jonah Jackson, left guard Steve Avila and right tackle Joe Noteboom all came off injured reserve to play this week, and yet Stafford was hurried all night by a Dolphins defensive front that had underperformed this season. Stafford was sacked four times, while Nacua and Kupp combined for 16 receptions, but none for TDs. It was just one loss, and yet it seems inevitable that some kind of change is ahead for the Rams. After all, Kupp was rumored to be a trade possibility, and then the deadline passed with him still in Los Angeles. The reality is that the front office has signaled they are willing to look at any and all options to build a brighter future. For all that McVay has done in eight seasons as a head coach, he has yet to develop his own quarterback. Stafford is signed through 2026, with no indications the Rams are anywhere near moving away from their star. But he won’t play forever. In a season like this one—with games still remaining against the Philadelphia Eagles, Buffalo Bills, San Francisco 49ers and the first-place Arizona Cardinals—there is a hunger to know what happens next. “There was some execution that has to be better,” McVay said of his offense that he agreed was 'sloppy.’ “These are the things we have to clean up if we want to be the type of (effective) team from an offensive perspective.” The Rams are just 1.5 games behind the suddenly-hot Cardinals in the NFC West and a game behind the second-place 49ers. Hope remains. But as Monday showed, it’s best to be careful about what is on the menu. Copyright 2024"

Just two months ago, the NFL world was encouraging Tagovailoa to retire after watching him curl his fingers while down on the turf following a shot to the head during a 31-10 loss to the Buffalo Bills back on September 12.  It was the third confirmed concussion that Tagovailoa has had at the professional level, and it sidelined him for four games. Tagovailoa vowed not to wear a Guardian Cap upon his return. He stuck to his word, which was all well and good, assuming that he would make some playstyle changes to get himself out of harm’s way.  So much for that. After being picked off in the second quarter of a 23-15 win over the Rams on Monday night, Tagovailoa tried to bring down Los Angeles linebacker Christian Rozeboom, who had come down with the interception. Rozeboom was running along the sideline on his return when Tagovailoa lowered his shoulder and took a knee to the side of the head. The Miami signal-caller ended up being just fine, even sharing a few light moments with reporters following the game when asked about the tackle. “I went up to that dude that intercepted me and asked him, ‘Like bro, you couldn’t (of) just ran out of bounds or like cut back?’ … He told me after the game, he’s like, ‘There’s no room, there was nowhere else to go,’” Tagovailoa said. “He gotta do what he gotta do to help his team win games. “I wasn’t planning on using my head to go hit him, so.” Throughout his explanation of how things went down, Tagovailoa couldn’t stop smiling, even laughing at times—because what could possibly be funnier than another traumatic brain injury, right?  Dolphins coaches need to start getting some of the blame here, too. To continuously let Tagovailoa go out there and throw himself headfirst at opposing defenses is just plain irresponsible.  It needs to be made clear to Tagovailoa that he quite literally cannot suffer another concussion. Not only would that one likely be career-ending, but it could also be life-altering, both mentally and physically. Surely these conversations have been had—or at least we hope that’s the case—but it looks like the message still hasn’t gotten through. Something tells us we haven’t seen Tagovailoa get knocked out for the last time. The saddest part? No one is going to intervene. Miami isn’t going to bench the 26-year-old, and the NFL certainly isn’t going to step in. For a league that says it cares so much about the health of its players, here’s a chance to possibly save one, and all it’s going to do is look the other way. We obviously hope Tagovailoa cleans up his game in such a way that will prevent a major head injury from ever happening again. But when he—and everyone else around him—seemsly embraces recklessness, it feels like another disaster is bound to happen.

After missing the preseason and first nine games of the regular season, Joel Embiid is set to suit up for the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday for the first time in 2024-25. That’s arguably the greatest area of intrigue at the dawn of the NBA Cup, an in-season tournament that will contest group play on Tuesdays and Fridays from today through Dec. 3 to decide an elimination bracket later that month. We look at the start of the event as well as a showdown between NHL Eastern Conference contenders and a juicy piece of college football MACtion. Let’s go. Embiid may have returned sooner from a left knee injury, but he racked up a three-game suspension for shoving a Philadelphia Inquirer columnist. The transgression? Name-dropping Embiid’s son and late brother in a column, calling into question his ability to stay in shape. Now the star center gets the chance to take out frustration on a Knicks team that eliminated Philly from the playoffs last season. Embiid likely will be on a minutes restriction, but his track record for efficiency and the struggling Sixers’ urgency could equal instant contribution. Limited to 39 games last season due to injury, Embiid shot 52.9 percent—including 38.8 percent from deep—while averaging a career-best 34.7 points.

The defending Stanley Cup champion Panthers have won seven straight and their 23 points are one clear of the Devils for tops in the Eastern Conference. New Jersey was blanked for the second time in five games during Sunday’s 1-0 home loss to San Jose, unable to solve former Devil Mackenzie Blackwood in a 44-save shutout. The Panthers needed a shootout to defeat the visiting Philadelphia Flyers on Saturday, the first time in their current tear that they didn’t prevail by at least two goals.

The usually purple-clad Huskies (5-5, 3-4) instead will don black uniforms, and fans are also encouraged to wear black. ""Some great uniforms coming out,"" Washington coach Jedd Fisch said. ""So excited about that."" The Huskies this season have played in a black-out at Rutgers (Sept. 27), a stripe-out at Iowa (Oct. 12) and a red-out at Indiana (Oct. 26) before last Saturday's white-out. They lost all of those games, although they are 5-0 at Husky Stadium. Washington likely needs to defeat UCLA to become bowl eligible as its last game of the regular season is Nov. 30 at No. 1 Oregon. The Huskies have had a short turnaround after not getting back to Seattle until 5 a.m. Sunday following their game at Penn State. ""Short week, a little bit of a cram session,"" Fisch said. ""But as I told the staff, ‘Sleep Saturday.'"" Quarterback Will Rogers is expected to start against UCLA after getting benched at halftime last weekend for Demond Williams Jr.  ""Will was a victim of circumstances, a little bit,"" Fisch said. ""He was 10-for-13 in the first half, just we weren't able to get anything going."" The Bruins have won three in a row, including a 20-17 decision against visiting Iowa last Friday. They have games remaining against rival Southern California and Fresno State as they try to qualify for a bowl game. The win over the Hawkeyes was UCLA's first in four tries at the Rose Bowl this season. ""I didn't want to make too big of a deal about us being back home, but we kind of treated this game like a road game,"" Bruins coach Deshaun Foster said. ""I just think my guys, they came out and they earned the right to win. Just in how they practiced (last) week and I think as long as we continue to do that, this team can really just take off."" UCLA quarterback Ethan Garbers started his collegiate career at Washington in 2020 -- he was named the Huskies' offensive scout squad MVP -- before transferring to Westwood the next year.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Louisiana won its most recent game, however the Ragin' Cajuns coach wasn't totally satisfied. Both teams are focused on early-season improvement ahead of their game Wednesday night in Houston. Houston (1-1) dropped to No. 8 in the Associated Press Top 25 poll after a 74-69 home loss to then-No. 11 Auburn last Saturday. The Cougars opened the season with a 97-40 victory against outmanned Jackson State, prompting coach Kelvin Sampson to say that he wanted his team to be challenged in its second game. ""This team needed to be tested,"" Sampson said. ""That's why we scheduled the game. You have wins and losses, but you also have wisdom and learning. This was a learning night for us."" Sampson said his team had its lofty ranking because of its ""rebounding and transition defense."" But those areas weren't advantages against the lengthy and athletic Tigers. Auburn outscored Houston 14-10 in fast-break points, including a 12-3 edge while it outscored the Cougars 46-36 in the second half. The teams each had 33 rebounds. ""We got exposed in some areas that we've got to go back and figure out how we can get better and clean up some things,"" Sampson said. ""This is a great learning tool for us. We weren't very good offensively in a lot of ways, but their defense had a lot to do with that. ""We hope we can learn from a loss to a really good team. There is no shame on our side."" J'Wan Roberts was one of five Houston players to score in double figures. He finished with 12 points along with seven rebounds. ""I don't think this game defines our season,"" Roberts said. ""When we look at the film there's a lot of stuff we've got to work on to try and get better for the next game."" The next game is against Louisiana (1-1), which defeated visiting UT Dallas 82-65 last Thursday. ""We showed some inconsistency,"" Ragin' Cajuns coach Bob Marlin said. ""It's a learning process. We had our moments each half offensively and defensively. And then the second half I thought we did a pretty good job pressuring the ball and defensively we got off to a better start."" Marlin said his team had too many unforced errors among its 14 turnovers and he was ""really disappointed"" in its 3-point shooting (4 of 21). ""We've got to do a better job of shooting the ball,"" Marlin said, but he added that his team's shortcomings were overcome by preventing its opponent from taking full advantage. UT Dallas, which made 7 of 28 3-pointers, turned the ball over 24 times and Louisiana had a 30-9 advantage in points off turnovers. ""(The Ragin' Cajuns) are disappointed because they know they're better than they played,"" Marlin said, ""but we're still growing as a team."" The game against Houston will be a far greater challenge for Louisiana, which opened the season with a 70-66 home loss to Kent State on Nov. 4. ""We'll learn more when we go to Houston,"" Marlin said. ""It'll be a super tough game.

He had 20 points in a 92-56 season-opening victory against Sacred Heart and 17 versus New Hampshire. He's averaging 5.5 assists and 5.5 blocks per game.   ""Alex is playing the way a Big East Player of the Year is supposed to be playing from a statistical standpoint, an efficiency standpoint, but he's also been super vocal and doing everything we want him to do right now,"" Hurley said.    Le Moyne (1-2) is in its second season as a Division I program. The Dolphins moved from Division II to the Northeast Conference before last season. Le Moyne opened its season with an 86-82 loss to Syracuse and a 97-75 setback to Cal State Northridge before rebounding to record a 107-73 victory over Division III SUNY Poly on Saturday.   Injuries have prevented Le Moyne from having its complete team available for a game this season. Guard AJ Dancler missed the Dolphins' first two games, and guard Robby Carmody -- who began his career at Notre Dame -- played in the loss to Syracuse but has missed the past two games with a leg injury. In addition, fifth-year guard Darrick Jones Jr. missed the Syracuse game, but came off the bench against Northridge.   ""At the end of the day we have to do a better job defensively and we know that,"" Le Moyne coach Nate Champion said following Saturday's win. ""We have to continue to get better as a team defensively and buy-in to that mindset.   ""(UConn is) a really good team. Hopefully we'll be ready to go. Hopefully we can perform at a high level again.""   Dwayne Koroma, a 6-foot-8 forward who started his career at Iona after being recruited by Rick Pitino, led the Dolphins with 17 points and six rebounds against SUNY Poly.    ""I think we're building the right culture here,"" Koroma said. ""I think we have a super-selfless group of guys. Everybody plays for each other.   ""A lot of (people) didn't expect us to have the performance we had against Syracuse, either. It doesn't matter if we're banged up or not, we're going to play as hard as we can and try to come out with a win.""   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After Vancouver's most recent outing, which continued the club's home-ice struggles, the Canucks could use it. Lekkerimaki, who was selected 15th overall in that draft, will be counted on to provide some of the scoring punch lost with Brock Boeser on the shelf due to a suspected concussion.  Lekkerimaki, 20, collected five goals and two assists in seven games for Abbotsford of the American Hockey League before being summoned. He practiced on a line with J.T. Miller and Pius Suter on Monday. ""I'm not nervous right now, but probably get (nervous) the same day or a few hours before the game,"" Lekkerimaki said. ""I will just try to play my game. But at the same time, the first NHL game is special, so try to enjoy it, too. Just have fun and enjoy every second, on and off the ice."" The Canucks, who have only one win in six home games (1-2-3), saw their three-game winning streak snapped by a 7-3 thrashing from the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday. Struggling forward Elias Pettersson registered his first multi-point performance of the season with one goal and one assist. The Canucks likely will turn to goaltender Arturs Silovs, who had some mop-up duty after Kevin Lankinen surrendered all seven goals. ""We wanted to get him in a game and we'll go from there,"" coach Rick Tocchet said.  The Flames arrive after skating to a 3-1 win over the Los Angeles Kings at home on Monday night. ""There was a lot of good from a lot of players. There's not a lot I can be overly critical of. It was a pretty solid 60 minutes,"" coach Ryan Huska said. Goaltender Dustin Wolf turned in a sparkling 28-save performance. His shutout bid was quashed in the final minutes, but the victory was a solid effort through the lineup. ""I think everyone, as a whole, just shut them down,"" Wolf said. ""Any chances they had, I was able to see, for the most part. I'm just trying to help keep pucks out of our net and if we score one more than they do, then we're going to be in pretty good hands."" The Flames finished a three-game Eastern road swing before returning home to face the Kings. While it will be a mean feat to rack up another victory on the West Coast, Calgary did show the blueprint in beating the Kings. The Flames controlled play from the start, were rewarded offensively and continued to hold momentum with a patient game that included a smart forecheck. ""We needed to start on time and be all over them, and that's what we did. Doing that all over them wears them down,"" forward Jonathan Huberdeau said. ""Scoring two quick goals and taking advantage (of the first period edge in play), we deserved it the way we were working. We needed to capitalize, and that's what we did, and after that, we didn't look back."" Calgary won the first meeting of the season between the Pacific Division rivals, a 6-5 overtime clash to open the season, in a game in which the Flames trailed 3-0 midway through the first period.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Dallas, which entered Monday with just 39 goals in 13 games, feasted on the league's third-worst scoring defense. The Stars' six-goal first period tied the then-Minnesota North Stars, who also scored six in the first 20 minutes in a 7-2 win over the Los Angeles Kings on March 16, 1971. The half-dozen goals that got past Joel Blomqvist and Alex Nedeljkovic on just 12 shots were also the most Pittsburgh ever allowed in the first period at home. Five Stars players recorded two or more points in the barrage, with Marchment (one goal, three assists) tying a team record with four points in one period. That occurred 10 times previously, with Tyler Seguin and Valeri Nichushkin both accomplishing the feat most recently against Philadelphia on Dec. 7, 2013. Canadiens 7, Sabres 5 Montreal outlasted host Buffalo with two-goal efforts from Cole Caufield and Nick Suzuki, while Suzuki added two assists and Juraj Slafkovsky tallied three assists. Caufield helped put an end to the Canadiens' six-game losing skid as he struck on the power play with 7:02 left in the third period to record his second goal of the contest and the eventual game-winner. Sabres star Tage Thompson scored his team-leading 11th goal of the season, but left the game early in the second period with a lower-body injury.

Benny Gealer (20 points) and Jaylen Blakes (18) each recorded career-high scoring totals in the win over the Titans. Gealer, a junior, scored all of his points in the second half while making six 3-pointers. Blakes is a graduate transfer from Duke who also had five assists with no turnovers.

Jackson State is playing its third straight road game to open the season and will be looking for its first win after falling to High Point 80-71 on Saturday. While Xavier has improved its offensive rebounding since the first 20 minutes of its season, it is trying to do the same with its 3-point defense. The Musketeers surrendered six offensive rebounds that turned into 10 second-chance points in the first half of their opener against Texas Southern, falling behind by as many as nine points. Since that point, Xavier has won the rebounding battle 45-38, allowing only 11 second-chance points. The problem for Xavier has been its defense against the 3-point shot. Texas Southern and IU Indy went a combined 24 of 51 from beyond the arc. IU Indy drained 14 of its 28 shots from long distance Friday as Xavier struggled to put the Jaguars away. ""We have to get better on our end defending the 3-point shot,"" Xavier coach Sean Miller said. ""We have to fix the leak in the roof and be better in that area. When you give up 14 of 28 from three, that's a concern."" After getting blown out 97-40 at No. 4 Houston in its season opener Nov. 4, Jackson State rebounded with a more respectable effort on the road at High Point, N.C., on Saturday. The Tigers trailed by as many as 23 with 3:33 remaining in the first half before outscoring High Point 52-38 the rest of the way. The Tigers outscored the Panthers 26-20 in the paint as Romelle Mansel led Jackson State with 22 points and Jayme Mitchell Jr. added 18 off the bench. Jackson State is playing the third of 13 straight road games to open the season and won't play at home until Jan. 11. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Bulldogs tout a program record, to boot. As a Tuesday visit from Southeastern Louisiana looms, Mississippi State has scored at least 95 points in consecutive games to begin the season for the first time in school history. Five Bulldogs scored in double figures during a 101-66 rout of Georgia State on Friday. In that contest, three players made their first career starts for Mississippi State, which is growing in a new philosophy under third-year coach Chris Jans. ""I want our team to play and get great shots and put pressure on the defense and score early when we can,"" Jans said. ""But on the other end, if we don't turn them over, I want them to have to go all the way to the shot=clock (buzzer) and work for open looks. ""The difference in length of possessions offensively and defensively is way more important to me than when people talk about what our pace is."" The Bulldogs drilled 10 3-pointers against Georgia State while boasting a 54-24 scoring edge in the paint. Josh Hubbard scored a team-high 15 points and Riley Kugel followed with 14. Hubbard, who shot 3-for-6 from long range, has made at least one 3-pointer in 15 straight games. Tuesday marks the second game of a 10-game road trip for Southeastern Louisiana. A 14-0 run in the first half at UAB on Sunday helped the Lions take a 10-point lead, but they couldn't hold the momentum. The Blazers responded with a 12-1 run to close the half en route to a 82-72 victory. Jakevion Buckley sparked Southeastern Louisiana (1-1) with 16 points and freshman Jeremy Elyzee posted his first career double-double, contributing 14 points and 10 rebounds. The Lions blasted visiting William Carey, an NAIA school, 91-53 on Nov. 4 but aren't set to return home until Dec. 20 against Loyola New Orleans. ""This is what we want,"" Southeastern Louisiana coach David Kiefer said. ""If we are trying (to) beat the best, we have to go on the road."" Mississippi State leads the all-time series 18-1.

The Horned Frogs and Bobcats had a triple-overtime thriller in their last meeting on Nov. 24, 2009, with TCU prevailing 108-99. TCU (2-0) has improved its program significantly since then, as it has made it to the NCAA Tournament in each of the previous three seasons under Jamie Dixon. TCU is hoping to make a fourth straight with wins over Florida A&M and Florida Gulf Coast already under its belt.  The Horned Frogs have become consistent winners early in seasons, too, posting a 53-6 record in the month of November since the 2014-15 campaign. TCU's offense shined in its season-opening victory over Florida A&M (105-59), while the defense received much of the credit in its 67-51 victory over Florida Gulf Coast. ""We found a way to get it done defensively, rebounding-wise, got all of our defensive goals, our standards, so that's a good sign,"" Dixon said after the victory over Florida Gulf Coast. ""Offensively, just not very good early and it wasn't like missing shots. It's just (that) our decision-making wasn't great."" Sophomore guard Vasean Allette has come off the bench to lead the Horned Frogs in scoring in each of the first two games, averaging 17.0 points per contest. For Texas State (2-0), this will be its first road game of the season. The Bobcats went 5-11 on the road last year. Sophomore guard Kaden Gumbs has led the team in scoring the first two games, scoring 15 points against Eastern Michigan and 27 points against McMurry. Guard Drue Drinnon is another player to watch and is an outside threat, knocking down five 3-pointers in the last game against McMurry. As a team, Texas State improved its field-goal percentage from 41.7 against Eastern Michigan to 56.7 vs. McMurry. Asked about the improvement on offense, Bobcats coach Terrence Johnson said, ""It's a good pass, which is usually going to be a good shot. We continue to play the game the way it's supposed to be played -- inside out, dribble penetration, throw the ball out to open shooters, and you're supposed to make those shots."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Longhorns bounced back from a season-opening loss to Ohio State in Las Vegas with an empathic 90-59 home win over Houston Christian on Friday. Johnson led the way for Texas with 28 points and now has racked up a combined 57 points in his first two collegiate games. Texas (1-1) never trailed against Houston Christian. The Longhorns were up by seven at halftime but roared out of the break, scoring the first 12 points of the second half as part of a 24-2 run to begin the second half. Johnson hit two 3-pointers and had 10 points in that pivotal spurt while Texas' defense held the visitors to 2-of-12 shooting over the first nine minutes of the half and won its 23rd consecutive home-opening game. ""We were able to get out and play to our strengths, which is to get out, play fast in transition, put pressure on the basket and let our guys get a chance to play a little bit in open space,"" Texas coach Rodney Terry said afterward. Arthur Kaluma added 15 points, Chendall Weaver had 12, Jordan Pope scored 11, and Kadin Shedrick and Jayson Kent hit for 10 points each for the Longhorns  in Friday's victory. Texas is still without guard Tramon Mark, who has missed the first two games with an ankle injury and has no specific timeline for a return. Johnson continues to wow, as expected for the presumptive one-and-done guard. He said the team's intense summer workouts have helped him adapt quickly to the college game. ""I feel like my adjustments have mainly been in practice, working against other good players, older players,"" Johnson said. ""It's just been playing off my teammates, letting it come to me, and shooting the open shot."" Johnson is 21 of 38 from the floor and 10 of 18 from 3-point range over his first two games. By comparison, former Texas one-and-done player Kevin Durant scored 20 and 21 points, respectively, in his first two collegiate contests. ""Tre is one of those guys that I think every game, every day, he's just getting better and better,"" Terry explained. ""It's really about developing a pro mentality."" Chicago State (0-2) heads to Austin after an 80-60 loss at home to Youngstown State on Saturday. The Cougars, who play in the Northeast Conference after two seasons as an independent, dropped their season opener 79-72 at Loyola Chicago on Nov. 4. Gabe Spinelli led Chicago State with 15 points in Saturday's setback while Jalen Forrest had 11 and Saxby Sunderland and Cam Jernigan added 10 points each. The Cougars were within a point of the lead after a back-and-forth first 28 minutes before surrendering a 15-2 run to Youngstown that all but decided the game. Chicago State, coached by Scott Spinelli in his first season at the school, was picked in the preseason poll to finish sixth of nine teams in the Northeastern Conference.

Reality comes Tuesday when Eastern Kentucky (2-0) plays at Clemson (2-0), which is coming off an appearance in the NCAA Tournament Elite Eight last spring. In its strong start, with wins over two mid-majors, Clemson has yet to trail. In the Tigers' 88-62 win on Friday over Saint Francis (Pa.), Ian Schieffelin had 16 points and 13 rebounds while Jaeden Zackery delivered 16 points, six assists and four steals. Zackery, who averaged double-figure scoring for each of the past three years at Boston College, has excelled at both ends of the floor. On Friday, when Clemson coach Brad Brownell said he thought his team ""had some guys that just didn't play quite as hard,"" he also singled out Zackery for his effort. ""Jaeden Zackery was terrific all night,"" Brownell said. ""I thought his on-ball defense was really good."" Zackery's presence at the point has allowed backcourt mate Chase Hunter to focus on scoring. Hunter leads the Tigers with an average of 15 points per game, hitting 57.9 percent from the floor and 5 of 9 from beyond the arc (55.6 percent). Eastern Kentucky counters with its top scorer, George Kimble III, a transfer from Division II Eckerd College, who is averaging 18 points and 4.5 assists per game. Jordan Crawford, a transfer from College of Charleston, is averaging 14.5 points per game. Devontae Blanton, who entered the year 12th on the school's all-time scoring list, is putting up 14 points, 5.5 rebounds and five assists per game. As Eastern Kentucky awaits the renovation of its home arena, the Colonels are playing a heavy road schedule.

MLB News,Here are 7 Hot Takes for a sizzling offseason,https://www.mlb.com/news/bold-predictions-for-mlb-offseason-2024-2025,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 03:49:56 GMT",,"Anthony Castrovince This is the time of year when anything appears possible. Even more than Opening Day, when hope springs eternal for all 30 clubs, the onset of the offseason is fascinating because it’s still so unclear what the final rosters will look like. It’s the time of year when, for instance, you can come across a headline like, “Rays reach out to Juan Soto,” because, hey, it’s an open market, isn’t it? • Latest free agent and trade rumors The Hot Stove, therefore, is the perfect time for Hot Takes. So here are a handful of thoughts I’ve had while wondering if Jose Siri will give up his No. 22 jersey to Soto. 1. The Yankees might be better off without Juan Soto. Everything I think about the Yankees’ offseason boils down to this: Aaron Judge should not be in center field. I’m not saying that because Judge biffed a big ball in Game 5 of the World Series; I’m saying that because there’s no reason for a team with the Yankees’ resources to have a player that old (Judge will be 33 next season), that big and that important in such a demanding defensive position. In the last 15 years, there have only been seven players -- Brett Gardner, Curtis Granderson, Torii Hunter, Coco Crisp, Denard Span, Lorenzo Cain and Angel Pagán -- to have a season in which they qualified for the batting title in center field at the age of 33 or older. And none of them was 6-foot-7, 280 pounds. Having Giancarlo Stanton at DH limits the Yankees’ options with Judge. And if they’re not going deep, deep, deep into luxury tax territory, then re-signing Soto reduces their flexibility and their ability to get more athletic elsewhere. Just spitballing here, but what if, instead of Judge in center and Soto in right, you could have Judge in right, Jazz Chisholm Jr. in center, Alex Bregman at third base, Willy Adames at second base and Christian Walker at first base? According to MLB Trade Rumors’ projections, you could sign Bregman, Adames and Walker for a long-term total of about $400 million, versus the $600 million it might take to keep Soto. And you would have a team that is deeper and more defensively dependable, albeit without a Gehrig to Judge’s Ruth. 2. The Diamondbacks should keep Jordan Montgomery. So … this is awkward. When Montgomery went unsigned last winter despite coming off his best season, the D-backs scooped him up late in Spring Training on a one-year, $25 million deal with a $22.5 million player option for 2024. It was a disaster. The late start did Montgomery no favors, and he never got into a groove. He pitched so poorly (6.23 ERA) that when the season ended Arizona owner Ken Kendrick publicly stated that he regretted the signing and took responsibility for having pushed for it. Montgomery exercised the player option anyway, because, well, it’s $22.5 million. You’d do the same. And that has led to speculation that the D-backs might now deal Montgomery to divorce themselves from this sticky situation. But even though the Snakes seemingly have a starting pitching surplus at the moment, that’s only true until it’s not. Selling low on Montgomery is senseless. Rather, I’d embrace the awkwardness with Montgomery, because, when you look at his career, 2024 is a clear outlier. The two sides would be better off pursuing ways they can make each other better and salvage what’s left of this deal. And to the D-backs’ credit, GM Mike Hazen has already been working to smooth things over. 3. The A’s should trade Brent Rooker. A’s general manager David Forst said, “We are not trading Brent Rooker,” which sure makes it sound as though they are not trading Brent Rooker. But I don’t get it. Keeping the 26-year-old Mason Miller after his transcendent rookie season is one thing, given the long-term cost control involved. But Rooker is arbitration-eligible for the first time this winter and will play next season at age 30. He is an extraordinarily valuable trade chip in a market in which only one team can land Soto. His 165 OPS+ this season was the 16th-best ever for a qualified DH. His trade value will likely never be higher than it is right now. And while the A’s did play .500 ball in the second half, they just aren’t in a competitive enough position to be punting on opportunities to improve their long-term organizational outlook.

There seems to be this theory that Alonso is worth more to the Mets than any other team. Because of the prodigious power he’s brought to their lineup since 2019. Because of his popularity. Because he hit that season-saving blast off the Brewers’ Devin Williams in the NL Wild Card Series. But it should be obvious that, for the Mets, signing the 26-year-old Soto should take precedence over re-upping with Alonso. They can do both, of course, but having Soto, Alonso, Francisco Lindor and Brandon Nimmo all inked for $20 million-plus through at least 2030 has the potential to hamstring the Mets down the road. And with or without Soto, there is an argument to be made for a (likely) more budget-friendly move for Walker or moving Mark Vientos to first base and improving defensively at the hot corner. The team that actually needs Alonso most is the Nationals. Coming off five straight seasons with a sub-.440 winning percentage, they are at a pivotal point in player development where it’s time to start creating a winning culture. They’ve got good young starting pitching, and they graduated intriguing outfield prospects Dylan Crews and James Wood to the big leagues this year. Still, they could use a proven centerpiece like Alonso, who would bring instant credibility to a lineup that was last in the NL in homers last season and got a lowly .686 OPS from first base. 5. No team should be more aggressive than the Orioles. The above is not meant to suggest that the O’s should be this offseason’s biggest spender. I’d venture to guess that title will go to whichever team signs Soto (duh). That won’t be Baltimore. But after their second consecutive empty October, the O’s have to raise the organizational stakes again. They made the big trade last offseason for Corbin Burnes and do deserve some credit for getting some big production out of Zach Eflin in a midseason trade market that was seriously short on starting pitching. That said, no team was in better position to make the Tigers an offer they couldn’t refuse on Tarik Skubal, and that particular ship has sailed now that the Tigers proved themselves as contenders. So it's on the O’s to go elsewhere for their clear pitching needs, which only become more pressing with Burnes on the open market. They can let Burnes and his declining K rate walk, recoup Draft pick compensation and still find a way to improve the rotation. With new ownership and a still-stocked system, they have the ability to, say, sign Blake Snell and trade for Garrett Crochet. We dream big with Baltimore because of the upside and cost control of their young core. But that core will get a lot more expensive (and therefore more complicated) in the not-too-distant future, so it is incumbent upon the O’s now to make sure this championship window is not wasted. 6. Walker Buehler will be the best starter signed this winter. I’m what the kids call a Walker Buehler “stan.” I love the guy. He’s got stuff, but he’s also got guts. This is a team for which the likes of Max Scherzer and Tyler Glasnow have been unable to post in pivotal moments in recent years. But Buehler takes the ball. He did it on short rest in Game 6 of the 2021 NLCS when Scherzer had a dead arm (that may have had an impact on Buehler’s elbow, which required Tommy John the following year). Buehler returned this year and again stepped up in the World Series, making it clear he was available to pitch in relief prior to Game 5 and then doing so with a perfect ninth just two days after starting Game 3. Buehler had an uninspiring regular season, but he learned to pitch in this postseason without the same fastball that used to bully batters. The Dodgers did him a favor in not making the qualifying offer, though they might re-sign him, anyway. He’s not among the very top free agents in a deep starter’s market, but it says here that whoever lands Buehler will get a gamer who learned a lot about himself in 2024 and will provide the best value on the board. 7. Roki Sasaki should sign with my favorite team. Not the Dodgers. That’s not fair! • Japanese ace Sasaki coming to MLB next season"
MLB News,Soto ... and then? MLB execs pick No. 2 free agent,https://www.mlb.com/news/which-mlb-free-agent-ranks-closest-to-juan-soto,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 01:36:00 GMT",,"Mark Feinsand As Juan Soto begins to meet with suitors in the coming days, there are several free agents who will be watching that situation closely. Such sluggers as Pete Alonso and Anthony Santander will be intrigued to see which clubs strike out on Soto, potentially opening the door for them to be the power bats those clubs need. Ditto for Willy Adames and Alex Bregman, who might not have the same pop as the aforementioned duo but offer more well-rounded skill sets at important defensive positions. Top pitchers, including Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell and Max Fried, also will be interested parties, as the clubs that are unable to sign Soto will have significant dollars left to spend. So while the consensus is that Soto is the top free agent on the market this offseason, which player is the next-best option for clubs seeking a major free-agent upgrade? We posed that question to a number of executives around the league, asking them which player they consider to be No. 2 in the current free-agent class. Note: We eliminated Roki Sasaki from this exercise, as the Japanese starting pitcher is considered an international amateur free agent, which will prevent him from landing a nine-figure contract, a factor that would almost certainly make him the consensus answer -- if not move him ahead of Soto for the No. 1 spot. Who's the second-best free agent in this class, behind Soto?• Corbin Burnes (eight votes)• Willy Adames (five votes)• Blake Snell (two votes)• Max Fried (one vote) Burnes’ place atop the poll demonstrates the clear value of starting pitching around the Majors. “I think it’s so incredibly difficult to get your hands on a frontline starter who has the ability to strike out hitters, keep walks down and who is built to pitch innings,” a National League executive said. “He’s a horse, and he’ll pitch at just 30 years old. So, theoretically, there should be a number of good years ahead of him. “Those guys are really hard to come by -- particularly in today’s game. His ability to eat innings is incredibly valuable.” Burnes’ 816 2/3 innings since the start of the 2020 season rank third in the Majors, behind Zack Wheeler and Aaron Nola, both of whom signed nine-figure contracts in the past year. During the past five seasons, Burnes has a 2.88 ERA and 1.02 WHIP, firmly establishing himself as one of the top starters in the game. “He’s the best starting pitcher out there, with both past success and age on his side,” an NL executive said. “All of the other position players have at least some question marks, so none of them rise up to No. 2.” If there is one concern about Burnes, it’s that his strikeout rate has dropped every year since 2020, when he registered a career-best mark of 36.7%. Last season, Burnes fanned 181 batters in 194 1/3 innings. His 23.1% rate marked his lowest since his 2018 rookie season (23.0%). “I think Burnes is probably next, but the recent results have been very good, not quite great,” an American League executive said. “I still trust him more than Fried or Snell, but all those guys are reasonably close.” Another NL executive cited the strikeout numbers as one reason he chose Snell as his No. 2 behind Soto, though Snell’s lack of draft-pick compensation also helps his case. “Snell positioned himself nicely to land the payday he sought last offseason,” the NL exec said. “Burnes’ declining strikeout rate could make Snell the preferred choice between those two for many clubs.” Snell’s second half (1.45 ERA over 68 1/3 innings in 12 starts) was stellar, though his first half -- marked by injury and inconsistency -- might cause some clubs some concern. Snell falls short of Burnes when it comes to durability, having thrown more than 130 innings only twice in his career. “Burnes has a rare combo in today’s game of durability and impact,” an AL executive said. When Snell is on top of his game, there aren’t many pitchers who perform better. And you can look no further than his two Cy Young Awards as proof. But those are in the past. And as he enters his age-32 season, there appears to be more risk with signing him to a long-term deal than there is with Burnes. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. “Snell can be great; we all know that,” an NL executive said. “But the old saying, ‘The best ability is availability’ is a cliché for a reason. Snell just isn’t always available. And if you’re paying a pitcher $30 million a year, you want to feel confident that he’s going to take the ball 30-plus times every year. That’s why I would go with Burnes.” While 11 of the 16 voters chose a starting pitcher, the five who went with a position player were unanimous in their selection: Adames. The 29-year-old easily tops the list of available shortstops this offseason, a position valued as much for defense as offense. Adames didn’t have a standout season defensively in 2024, but his 26 outs above average since the start of 2022 rank fourth in the Majors among shortstops. “Because of the position he plays and because there are teams that need a shortstop, he’s really valuable,” an AL executive said. “When he played against us, all I could think was, ‘I’d love to have that guy on our team.’” Adames recorded career highs in home runs (32) and RBIs (112) this past season for the Brewers, finishing the year with a personal-best 4.8 fWAR. He has been at least a three-win player in all five of his full seasons in the Majors, playing at least 139 games in each of them. Bregman didn’t receive any votes. Two executives noted that while his career statistics are better than Adames, there has been some offensive decline in recent years. After finishing second in AL MVP voting in 2019 with 41 home runs, 112 RBIs and a 1.015 OPS, Bregman hasn’t come close to those numbers again. He posted a career-low .768 OPS in 2024, with 26 homers and 75 RBIs. “I think they’re very similar today,” an AL executive said. “I’ll take the guy who is 1 1/2 years younger and has played shortstop recently.” Two executives also cited Adames’ reputation as a clubhouse leader, noting that he brings as much to a team off the field as he does between the lines. “He’s so good, and he’s such a good human,” an AL executive said. “If you’re throwing money at someone and you’re going to invest in them, you’re going to get a lot of benefits from him. He plays; he posts every day, and durability is something we don’t always pay for.” Added another AL executive: “Everything I've been told about him, he’s a wonderful teammate who connects with the American players and Latin American players. You put all those things together with what he can do on the field, he’s going to be attractive to a lot of teams. With long-term deals for big money, that’s got to factor in.”"

But how exactly do all of these talented arms stack up? To answer that question, we turned to our MLB.com panel to vote on one final 2024 edition of the Starting Pitcher Power Rankings. This one focuses only on free agents. Here is a look at the results, with each pitcher listed alongside his final 2024 team. 1. Corbin Burnes, OriolesBurnes presents an interesting case. In the big picture, he has four straight All-Star selections and almost certainly is headed for a fifth straight top-10 Cy Young Award finish, including his win in 2021. The 30-year-old has thrown more than 190 innings with an ERA+ of better than 125 for three straight seasons. On the other hand, his strikeout and whiff rates have plummeted from their elite peaks in 2021-22. This past season, Burnes' 23.1% K rate was only 29th out of 58 qualified pitchers. That could give some teams cause for concern before handing out a long-term deal, but Burnes has been so effective that he still stands atop this class. 2. Roki Sasaki, Chiba Lotte Marines (NPB)Why will Sasaki be so hotly pursued by MLB teams once his posting window officially opens? Just imagine if someone like NL Rookie of the Year favorite Paul Skenes was suddenly made available to any bidder. Sasaki, who turned 23 on Nov. 3, is only seven months older than Skenes, and like the Pirates right-hander, has top-of-the-charts, power stuff. Like Shohei Ohtani in 2017, Sasaki is subject to international bonus pool money restrictions, which means that any team signing him will do so while making a relatively minimal financial commitment. There are certainly risks here, especially in terms of health and durability, but Sasaki’s potential is easily the highest of anyone available this offseason, other than Juan Soto. 3. Blake Snell, GiantsSnell’s first foray into free agency didn’t go as planned. Despite coming off his second Cy Young Award in 2023, the lefty languished on the market until mid-March before finally signing with the Giants on a one-year deal with a player option for 2025. Expect Snell to do better this time around after exercising his opt-out clause. While his late start this past season seemed to hinder him initially, Snell was virtually unhittable for the last three months of the season, posting a 1.23 ERA and 1.77 FIP across 14 starts, which included a no-hitter on Aug. 2 at Cincinnati. Opponents hit a meager .123/.211/.171 against him over that span. Snell is always going to face some questions about his durability and high walk rates, but at his best, he’s as dominant as anyone. 4. Max Fried, BravesHere’s a stat that might surprise you: Among the 67 pitchers who have thrown at least 500 innings over the past five seasons, Fried sports easily the best ERA+ (151), well ahead of Burnes and Zack Wheeler (141). Of course, Fried is only 25th in innings and 34th in strikeout rate among that group, which perhaps explains him ranking outside the top three on this list. Fried has never blown away hitters with velocity or missed a ton of bats, but when it comes to keeping runs off the board, he has been consistently excellent. How? He avoids hard contact as well as anyone and keeps the ball on the ground and in the ballpark. 5. Jack Flaherty, DodgersLike Fried, Flaherty is a product of Harvard-Westlake High School in Southern California. Unlike Fried, consistency has not been his calling card. Even during the Dodgers’ 2024 championship run, Flaherty had two excellent playoff starts, two disastrous starts and one in between. That was representative of a highly talented pitcher who has battled injuries and significant fluctuations in both stuff and results since arriving in the big leagues. The good news for Flaherty -- and the righty’s next team -- is that he’s a bit on the younger side for a free agent (having just turned 29 in October), has mostly stayed healthy for two straight seasons and was quite effective in 2024. Flaherty looks like one of the riskier options on this list, but the potential rewards should still generate a robust market. 6. Sean Manaea, MetsIn mid-June, there was little reason to think Manaea would be anywhere close to this spot. The 32-year-old lefty, coming off a couple of underwhelming seasons with the Padres and Giants, had a 4.30 ERA over his first 12 outings with the Mets. From there, though, Manaea went 9-3 with a 3.05 ERA and more than a strikeout per inning over his final 20 outings, before making three solid postseason starts. Along the way, with Chris Sale as inspiration, the 6-foot-5 Manaea dropped his release point, to great effect.

Walker Buehler, DodgersFollowing a lengthy rehab from his second Tommy John surgery, Buehler struggled mightily to rediscover his form in 2024. The numbers were ugly: 16 starts with a 5.38 ERA, 5.54 FIP and .862 opponent OPS. This looked nothing like the pitcher who was one of the best in baseball from 2018-21, culminating in a fourth-place NL Cy Young Award finish. But, at long last, signs of that pitcher re-emerged during the postseason, just in time to help the Dodgers secure a World Series title. Was that a blip? Or a sign that Buehler is back? That’s the question teams will have to answer this offseason. 8. Yusei Kikuchi, AstrosOver six MLB seasons since making the move from NPB, Kikuchi has been unable to put it all together for an extended period of time. The left-hander has shown plenty of flashes, but consistent success has eluded him, leading to roughly league-average production (a 4.28 ERA and 96 ERA+ over 601 innings since 2021). The glass-half-full view is that Kikuchi might have found a winning formula after the Blue Jays dealt him to Houston at the Trade Deadline, posting a 2.70 ERA and 3.07 FIP in 10 starts down the stretch while dramatically ramping up his slider usage at the expense of his four-seam fastball. 9. Nathan Eovaldi, RangersDespite the fact that he will turn 35 before next season, Eovaldi opted out of his contract, passing up a $20 million guarantee in 2025. It’s not hard to understand why. Eovaldi still throws in the mid-90s, with two swing-and-miss secondary pitches in his splitter and curveball, helping him consistently post excellent chase and walk rates. He now has strung together five consecutive seasons with an ERA under 4.00 and an ERA+ over 100, and he’s a proven postseason performer. It would be no surprise to see Eovaldi land a solid multi-year deal. 10. Shane Bieber, GuardiansWhichever team signs Bieber will do so knowing that the 29-year-old righty is still working his way back from the Tommy John surgery he underwent in April. That adds plenty of uncertainty to the mix here, but also an opportunity to add a star-caliber pitcher to their rotation on a short-term commitment. Bieber was one of MLB’s top starters from 2019-22, winning the AL Cy Young Award in ‘20, and after a relatively subpar ‘23 campaign, he looked fantastic out of the gate this past season before tearing his UCL. Assuming Bieber comes back strong, he has a chance to re-enter the market as a clear ace in a year or two.

MLB News,Making the case for (and against) each of Juan Soto's main suitors,https://www.mlb.com/news/juan-soto-free-agency-rumors-favorites-to-sign-him,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 03:41:09 GMT",,"MLB.com Juan Soto, the most coveted and high-profile free agent on the market this offseason, is reportedly scheduled to meet this week with the Yankees, Mets, Red Sox and Blue Jays. While it’s certain these four clubs will not be the only ones pursuing Soto – so far, he hasn’t tipped his hand, if he has a favorite – they’re likely to be among a small group with a realistic chance to sign him. MLB.com examined the case for and against each: Which team has the edge right now? Why? Mark Feinsand, senior national reporter: The Mets. I put them at a 51-49% favorite over the Yankees, mainly because financially, they are able to keep up with, or bypass, the other potential big spenders. The Yankees are certainly right there, and if the offers wind up being close, I could see Soto choosing to stay in the Bronx to hit next to Aaron Judge for the next seven years. It’s difficult for me to see any other team doing enough to pry Soto out of New York, but that doesn’t mean the Red Sox, Blue Jays, etc., won’t give it a try. Bryan Hoch, Yankees beat reporter: Considering no team has made an official monetary offer yet, I’ll say it’s the Yankees, just based upon that he’s days removed from playing in a World Series game for them. He played his postgame comments with surgical precision after Game 5, making sure that the world knew he enjoyed his time with the Yankees, with Aaron Judge, Aaron Boone, everyone — but that his door would be open to all 30 teams. Soto knows what a 162-game season in the Bronx looks like, sounds like, feels like … and even more importantly, what the postseason was, and can be again. The Yankees have every reason in the world to dig deep and keep him. Anthony DiComo, Mets beat reporter: I think it's the Mets. I just see them as highly motivated to land a generational-type star, which makes me think they won't be outbid. And if that's true – if they really do refuse to get outbid – then does anyone really believe Soto will go elsewhere? Ian Browne, Red Sox beat reporter: Everyone around baseball is saying the Mets, which makes me think it won’t be the Mets. I’m going to keep him in the Bronx. In one year of Soto joining forces with Aaron Judge, the Yankees went from out of the playoffs in ‘23 to the World Series in ‘24. My guess is that [general manager] Brian Cashman wants to keep this modern-day Mickey Mantle/Roger Maris duo together for the coming years. Keegan Matheson, Blue Jays beat reporter: The Mets. They just got a taste of the NLCS and watched while Soto took the team across town to the World Series. If this comes down to New York vs. New York, as many in the industry expect, I’m betting on a motivated Steve Cohen. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Teams will be making their best pitch to Soto. How will they sell him on their team? The case for: Yankees: Listen, Juan, you just lived it. You had the best offensive season of your career, highlighted by a Silver Slugger, a likely top-three MVP finish and a World Series appearance. Maybe even more importantly, you know that New York loves you already — hey, that guy wasn’t out in the right-field seats carrying an oversized blank check for his health. Stay in the Bronx long-term, and you’ll hit in front of Judge again for years. You’ll hit in Yankee Stadium 81 times a year. You and Judge can chase championships together, wind up in Monument Park together and go into Cooperstown with Yankees logos on your caps. The marketing opportunities will be endless, too. What else do you need? – Hoch Mets: It's two-fold. One is the aforementioned money and their willingness to spend it. Two is the fact that they can suddenly make a really nice case about their organizational direction and ability to win. They can sell Soto like this: We'll pay you the most and also give you one of the best chances to win. … And by the way, in New York, you can continue to be an absolute alpha star. – DiComo Red Sox: The Dominican Republic native has a pretty good idea of how special a place Boston was to countrymen David Ortiz, Pedro Martinez and Manny Ramirez, though the latter certainly had some ups and downs. When the Red Sox are winning, there is no better place for a star to play, given the fervor of the fanbase. Surely, Ortiz and Martinez will try to sell Soto on this. Also, the Red Sox, after being conservative with payroll the last three seasons as they built up their young core at the Major League level and the farm system, seem ready to shell out money again for a transformational player, which Soto certainly is. – Browne Blue Jays: Signings like George Springer, Kevin Gausman and the José Berríos extension show the Blue Jays aren’t afraid to spend, but Soto will cost more than all three of those contracts combined. The Blue Jays will need to convince Soto that they’ll continue to build -- and spend -- around him for the next decade-plus. Once you get another taste of the World Series with the Yankees, why sign with the team that just finished last place in your division unless you truly believe brighter days are ahead? If the Blue Jays have any shot at Soto, it has to involve Vladimir Guerrero Jr. … First at the pitch meeting, then receiving an extension of his own. – Matheson The case against – if the money is all the same, what could make Soto decide to sign elsewhere? Yankees: I don’t believe there is a scenario where the Yankees have the top bid, or match a top bid, and Soto goes elsewhere. It may well be that Soto and [agent] Scott Boras are looking to grab every dollar on the table, and if that’s the case, there is a good chance the Yankees do not have the highest bid. Hal Steinbrenner has said that he doesn’t want to have a payroll above $300 million, calling it “unsustainable” for the franchise long-term, and industry folks say that is no bluff. Now, here’s a thought for you: The Yanks did not have the high bid for Judge, far from it. They had to match the second-place bid from the Giants to keep him; Soto isn’t offering any similar hometown discounts, at least not to the Yankees. – Hoch Mets: Maybe he really does love the Yankees and values re-signing there more than coming to Queens. Maybe the Dodgers get involved and he wants to be part of a super-team. If the money is all the same, lifestyle factors come into play, and that's an area in which the Mets – see: Yamamoto, Yoshinobu – haven't always fared well. – DiComo Red Sox: Soto might wind up loving Boston. But he already knows how much he enjoys New York after playing there for a year. This could give the Yankees and Mets an edge over the Red Sox if the money winds up being relatively equal. While the Red Sox are confident they’re ready to start winning again, Soto might be more skeptical about it given the team’s absence in October the past three years. – Browne Blue Jays: The Blue Jays are coming off a 74-88 season. Their internal optimism isn’t going to woo one of the biggest free agents in MLB history, but this gets even more difficult when Soto or any other top-end option looks at the Blue Jays’ immediate future. Will Vladdy stay in Toronto beyond 2025? If not, will money be spent to pair Soto with other legitimate stars? This could eventually reach a point where one team involved needs to tear up its projections and valuations and decide to blow everyone else out of the water entirely to get their guy. Is that really a move you’d expect to see from the Blue Jays’ front office? – Matheson"
MLB News,Report on Sasaki? 'Probably one of the greatest pitchers I’ve ever seen live',https://www.mlb.com/news/roki-sasaki-scouting-report,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 01:00:00 GMT",,"Jonathan Mayo Roki Sasaki burst onto the scene in Japan as a 19-year-old in 2021, posting a 1.84 ERA over 16 starts. He bounded onto the world stage when he joined a star-studded Japanese rotation that included Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto in the 2023 World Baseball Classic. Now it looks like he’ll get the chance to join them in the Major Leagues in 2025. While teams will try to position themselves to be the best suitor for the right-hander, Sasaki will not be making his choice solely based on up-front money. Like Ohtani in 2017, because he’s under 25, his signing is subject to international bonus pool rules and will count against a team’s international bonus pool. So all 30 teams are limited in what they can offer. Beyond the eye-popping numbers (2.02 ERA, 11.4 K/9, 2.0 BB/9, 6.0 H/9 over four seasons), what exactly will teams entering the Sasaki sweepstakes be vying for? Let’s take a deeper look: The scouting reportThe 6-foot-2 Sasaki will pitch all of the 2025 season at age 23 and is more than three years younger than Yamamoto, around the same age as Ohtani was when he made his big league debut. He’s been scouted continuously since he made his NPB debut in 2021 and especially since his World Baseball Classic coming-out party, with international scouting departments wanting to make sure they were ready when the right-hander was posted. “He’s as good as advertised,” one international scouting director said. “He has an ideal projectable, lean and athletic frame. He has excellent arm action and delivery, with three plus power pitches with control over command. He has No. 1 upside.” Throwing out that “No. 1” label is not something scouts do freely, but that director was not the only one to do so. “In my opinion, he’s a top-end starter,” another director said. “I wouldn’t say he’s Ohtani, but from a pitching standpoint, it’s very comparative. I’ve been seeing him since he was 19, and saw him on the national team. It’s an explosive arm.” “He reminds me of Noah Syndergaard when he was fresh,” a third international scout said. FastballIt’s at least a 70 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale, and depending on when you saw it, it might get the rarely spotted 80. It’s been up to 102 mph in the past and averaged 98.8 mph (96-100 more often than not) in '23 with some armside run. In 2024, it averaged 96.8 mph (95-99 most of the time). Some evaluators said it was a little straighter than the previous year, perhaps a reason why it missed fewer bats (13.1 percent whiff rate vs. 24.0 pct in '23), but as long as there are no lasting injury concerns, this isn’t too much of a worry. More on Sasaki: SplitterThis is the “national pitch” according to James Dykstra, a former White Sox draftee who had as good a view of it as anyone last year while pitching for the Chibo Latte Marines alongside Sasaki. Dykstra came out of the San Diego area high school powerhouse Rancho Bernardo High School and was drafted three times, eventually joining the White Sox as a sixth-rounder in 2013. He reached Triple-A and spent time in Mexico and indy ball before heading to Japan to pitch for the Marines this past season. Arriving in Japan armed with a splitter of his own, Dykstra couldn’t wait to see Sasaki’s up close after seeing how filthy it was during the World Baseball Classic. “I stood behind the catcher in his bullpen early in Spring Training and said ‘Oh my!’"" Dykstra said. “I knew how good it was in the World Baseball Classic and it even exceeded my expectations. It’s probably one of the best splitters I’ve ever seen.” The data backs up his eyewitness report. Throwing the pitch in the 88-90 mph range, Sasaki kills spin with it, and it comes out of his hand looking like his heater until it falls off the table. It produced an absurd 57.1 percent whiff rate in '24. The Major League average whiff rate on the splitter this past season was 34.5 percent. Sasaki would have placed second among all big league pitchers in this category with a minimum of 100 swings on splitters: Fernando Cruz (CIN): 59.3%Roki Sasaki (NPB): 57.1%Mark Leiter Jr. (NYY): 56.5%Justin Martinez (AZ): 54.0%Reed Garrett (NYM): 51.1% Dykstra had to hearken back to his days with Chicago to remember the last time he was so impressed with a secondary offering. “The only other time I’ve been in a bullpen and was mind-blown, I was with the White Sox and I watched a Chris Sale slider from behind the catcher,” he said. SliderThis is Sasaki’s “third” pitch but some scouts grade it out as above-average, if not plus. Even though it also was down a tick or two this past season, Sasaki still missed bats with it at a 40.7 percent rate, throwing it in the 83-85 mph range. In '23, his breaking ball elicited a whiff rate of 48.6 percent and was typically an upper-80s offering, more consistently getting plus grades. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Sasaki's 2024 metrics: Sasaki's 2023 metrics: ConclusionWhile teams may have questions about Sasaki’s small downtick in velocity, it certainly won’t keep any team from being interested. He is, after all, a starter who finished last season with a 2.35 ERA, 10.5 K/9 and 2.6 BB/9 rates at age 22. It’s agreed that once posted, Sasaki would become the top international prospect in his class, whether it’s '24 or 2025. As one scout pointed out, he’s much more of a sure thing compared to the teenagers currently on the 2025 Top 50 international prospects list, someone who will be expected to step into a big league rotation, if not lead it, on Opening Day 2025. How much would a pitcher like that warrant on an open market if he didn’t fall under the international bonus pool spending rules? “A lot,” one international scouting director said. That director declined to define “a lot,” but keeping Yamamoto’s 12-year, $325 million deal with the Dodgers in mind, another scouting executive tried to find some parameters. “I think it would be $275-300 million if he was in an open market, for 10 years -- that’s what I would think he’d get,” he said. “The sky is the limit for this guy.” Dykstra, for one, agrees. “It’s well known his talent is pretty much unmatched,” he said, adding that Sasaki was a tremendous teammate who worked hard on his English and his craft on the mound. ""I came back from watching that bullpen and said, 'this is probably one of the greatest pitchers I’ve ever seen live.' “Every time he pitched was more and more impressive. I can’t think of a single person that has this much raw talent.”"
MLB News,Which FAs might Yanks target if they don't re-sign Soto?,https://www.mlb.com/news/yankees-rumors-latest-trades-and-signings,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 21:00:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of all the latest Yankees-related free agent and trade rumors right here. You can follow the latest Juan Soto rumors here. Nov. 13: What might Yankees do if they don’t re-sign Soto?Although the Yankees are going to make a strong effort to bring back Juan Soto, there’s a real chance the superstar outfielder will sign elsewhere, which means New York needs to have a backup plan in place. In his live chat for Bleacher Report on Wednesday afternoon, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman laid out what that plan might look like. Heyman sees the Yankees becoming more aggressive in the corner-infield market if they don’t land Soto. In that scenario, the Bronx Bombers could target Pete Alonso to play first base, or pursue Willy Adames or Alex Bregman to handle third base. Adames is a natural shortstop, but he is reportedly willing to move to another position for the right team/contract. The Yankees ended the season with Jazz Chisholm Jr. at the hot corner, but they could move Chisholm to second base to replace free agent Gleyber Torres. Heyman also thinks the Yanks would “look more seriously” at signing one of Corbin Burnes, Max Fried and Blake Snell to bolster their rotation and pursue switch-hitting slugger Anthony Santander to replace Soto in their outfield. Nov. 11: Yankees among teams with reported interest in WalkerRe-signing Juan Soto is the Yankees' top priority this offseason, but the club also has a hole at first base that it needs to fill after declining Anthony Rizzo's 2025 club option. The position was a weak spot for the Bronx Bombers in 2024, with Yankees first basemen posting the second-worst wRC+ (76) in MLB. Accordingly, the Yankees are among the teams planning to ""aggressively pursue"" free-agent Christian Walker, per a report from USA Today’s Bob Nightengale. They aren't alone, however, as Nightengale reports that at least five other teams are eyeing the right-handed slugger. The Bronx Bombers have also been connected to Alonso, but the longtime Mets first baseman seems like more of a backup plan in case the Yanks aren't able to re-sign Soto, given the exorbitant cost it would take to sign both players. With the age disparity between Alonso (29) and Walker (33), the latter should come with a much lower price tag, perhaps leaving room in the Yankees' budget to re-sign Soto and add Walker. Walker doesn’t have quite the same power as Alonso, but he’s no slouch with the bat, having recorded 95 homers and an .813 OPS over the past three seasons. In that same time, Alonso has produced 120 homers and an .826 OPS. Walker, meanwhile, is a far better defender, winning three straight Gold Gloves and leading his position with +38 Outs Above Average since the beginning of 2022. Alonso has produced -17 OAA in that span. Nov. 8: Yanks set to meet with Soto soon (report)The Yankees have scheduled their own sitdown with Juan Soto as they get ready to make their pitch to re-sign their superstar slugger, according to a report from the New York Post on Friday. Yanks owner Hal Steinbrenner is expected to fly to California in about a week and a half to meet with Soto. The Mets are also reportedly visiting Soto next week, but per the Post's report, the Yankees have been assured that they will still be able to meet with Soto after that. The New York rivals are two of the favorites to land Soto, the marquee free agent on the market this winter. Soto had arguably the best season of his career in 2024 after the Yankees acquired him from the Padres in a blockbuster trade last December. The 26-year-old batted .288 with 41 home runs, 109 RBIs, 128 runs scored and a .989 OPS and led New York to the American League pennant. Nov. 7: Could Arenado be on the move? Are Yankees a fit?According to reports by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and USA TODAY, eight-time All-Star and 10-time Gold Glove Award-winning third baseman Nolan Arenado could be available in trade discussions if he's willing to waive his no-trade clause. The same goes for veteran starting pitchers Sonny Gray and Lance Lynn. Arenado, who will be entering his age-34 season in 2025, is coming off a year in which he produced the lowest offensive output in any full season (excluding the 2020 pandemic-shortened campaign) since his rookie year in 2013. He finished this past season with a .719 OPS and 16 home runs for St. Louis. Still, he's only two seasons removed from a third-place finish in NL MVP voting. Yankees announcer Michael Kay, on his ESPN Radio show on Thursday, suggested that Arenado would be a good fit at third base for New York as opposed to spending big money on free-agent first baseman Pete Alonso. Nov. 7: Yanks interested in numerous star FAs, 'aggressive' in bullpen marketThe No. 1 item on the Yankees' offseason to-do list remains re-signing Juan Soto. However, he is expected to take his time in making a decision, and the Yanks' roster has multiple areas of need. So while Soto remains the priority, New York has to look for options at other positions. According to MLB Network insiders Jon Heyman and Jon Paul Morosi, they are doing just that. Heyman wrote Wednesday in the New York Post that the Yankees have ""checked in"" on first baseman Pete Alonso and outfielder Anthony Santander, although both are viewed as ""backup plans"" in case Soto signs elsewhere. Although Soto's departure would leave a hole in the Yankees' outfield, Alonso would make sense as a secondary option since New York's first basemen recorded a 76 wRC+ this season, worst in the American League. Per Heyman, the Yankees have also expressed interest in the top starting pitchers in free agency, including Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell and Max Fried. Yet Heyman adds that it's ""uncertain"" if the Yankees will be able to afford both Soto and a bona fide ace to slot in next to Gerrit Cole. The prices won't be as high in the reliever market, and the Yankees have been ""among the most aggressive teams"" in searching for bullpen help during this week's General Managers Meetings, per Morosi. The Yankees have Luke Weaver returning for 2025, but they have a handful of impactful free-agent relievers: Clay Holmes, Jonathan Loáisiga, Tommy Kahnle and Tim Hill. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Morosi mentions Tanner Scott, Jeff Hoffman and Carlos Estévez as possibilities for the Yanks if they don't re-sign some of those aforementioned arms. ""The New York Yankees fully realizing that even with Luke Weaver at the back end of the bullpen, they need to be active in the relief pitching market,"" Morosi said during Thursday's edition of Hot Stove. Yankees are among the most aggressive teams in speaking with reps for free-agent relievers at the GM Meetings. One reason: Three members of their World Series bullpen -- Clay Holmes, Tommy Kahnle, Tim Hill -- are free agents. @MLBNetwork Nov. 4: Cole staying with Yankees on existing dealGerrit Cole is staying with the Yankees. The Yankees' ace will remain in New York on the same four-year, $144 million deal he originally opted out of. Cole and the Yankees will continue to discuss options for a potential contract extension, according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. But for now, the Yankees have secured their ace through the 2028 season. The Yankees had a deadline of 5 p.m. ET on Monday to decide whether to void Cole's opt-out and prevent him from reaching free agency by adding a one-year extension worth $36 million to his pre-existing deal. Instead, the Yankees and Cole were able to negotiate an agreement that excludes that additional year, but still keeps Cole in New York for the same contract that he would have had if he hadn't opted out, while allowing for the possibility of an extension later. Oct. 31: Soto: 'Every team has the same opportunities' in free agencyJuan Soto has been a free agent for less than 24 hours, but a bunch of teams have already been in contact with him, according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman. Heyman writes in the New York Post that eight teams checked in with Soto in the hours after he and the Yankees lost to the Dodgers in World Series Game 5 on Wednesday. By Thursday morning, the number of interested clubs was up to 11. The incumbent Yankees are likely to make a strong effort to bring him back, but while Soto said after New York’s season-ending loss that he was happy with the team and the city, he also made it clear he’s not giving the Bronx Bombers an edge over any other potential suitor. “I feel like every team has the same opportunities when I go into free agency,” Soto said. ""I don't want to say anyone has an advantage, because at the end of the day we're gonna look at what they have and how much they want me."" Oct. 31: Re-signing Soto atop Yankees’ offseason prioritiesThe good news for the Yankees is that they finished the 2024 season with the best record in the American League and earned their first trip to the World Series. The bad news is that they were outplayed by the Dodgers in the Fall Classic, which Los Angeles ended with a Game 5 win Wednesday. For the Yankees, any season that doesn’t end with a World Series title is deemed by many as a failure. How their offseason is judged will hinge largely on one action: re-signing Juan Soto. The 26-year-old was phenomenal with the Yankees after being acquired prior to this season in a trade with San Diego. He hit a career-high 41 home runs, led the American League with 128 runs and had a 178 OPS+, his best in a full season. “I’m really happy with the city, with the team, how these guys do,"" Soto said after the Yankees' season-ending loss. ""But at the end of the day, we’re going to look at every situation, every offer that we get, and then take a decision from that.” The Yankees will face fierce competition for Soto’s services, perhaps most of all from the crosstown Mets. Even if Soto returns, the Yankees’ lineup will have a different look in 2025 as infielder Gleyber Torres and outfielder Alex Verdugo are slated to become free agents. Anthony Rizzo, who posted a .637 OPS, carries a $17 million club option for next season. The Bronx Bombers will likely try to add another impact bat to take some of the pressure off of Soto and Aaron Judge, who carried the Yankees’ offense throughout the year. A host of Yanks relievers are set to be free agents, including Clay Holmes, Jonathan Loáisiga, Tommy Kahnle and Tim Hill. Cole could also opt out of his contract, but the Yankees can void that decision by adding a 10th year onto his contract for $36 million."
MLB News,You can't turn down a baseball card-themed invite to Bobby Witt Jr.'s wedding,https://www.mlb.com/news/angels-logan-britt-bobby-witt-jr-best-man-topps-card,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 05:18:28 GMT",,"Jesse Borek MESA, Ariz. -- Three years into his Major League career, Bobby Witt Jr. has already had 2,035 regular-season plate appearances. That’s a lot of chances to make an impression. But when it comes to your wedding, you only get one chance to hit it out of the park. More on the Arizona Fall League:• Complete coverage | Schedule | Tickets | Teams | Shop With the AL MVP finalist set to tie the knot with fiancée Maggie Black on Dec. 14 in Texas, he sent out epic baseball card-themed invitations to his side of the wedding party. Royals teammate MJ Melendez gave the baseball world a glimpse into the intricate design. A post shared by PULLWAX SPORTS CARDS (@pullwax) But as any member of a wedding party knows, when you want the details, go straight to the best man -- Angels prospect Logan Britt. “It was pretty sick because I saw MJ Melendez’s card and he had a picture of them playing in Kansas City,” Britt said of his reaction to the cards. “Ours was actually a photo taken in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, when we were 13. I'm sitting on a bucket and he's sitting next to me. He's got the mullet rocking back in the day, so that was pretty funny.” Much like Witt’s dedication to his mullet, his bond with Britt hasn’t wavered. The two met as youngsters on the hyper-competitive Texas baseball scene, with the Witt family offering a young Britt a spot on a travel ball tournament roster in Florida. “I got to go on a family vacation with his family to the Bahamas and we've been friends ever since,” Britt said. “Just a nutty, super humble, great guy to be around. He's just a goofball and he's a friend I'll have for life.” More from MLB Pipeline:• Top 100 prospects | Stats | Video | Podcast | Complete coverage It’s fitting that the two first bonded in the Bahamas, since Witt brought his group there for his bachelor party. Britt got to meet many of the groomsmen -- Nick Pratto, Vinnie Pasquantino, Kyle Isbel, Melendez -- during a previous visit to Kansas City to see Witt a few years back, but this was their first chance to unwind and bond before the nuptials. The wedding party also includes Witt’s three brothers-in-law, all of whom are former big leaguers -- Zach Neal, James Russell and Cody Thomas -- and another player with a Colleyville (Texas) High School connection: the Braves’ AJ Smith-Shawver. Kansas City chose Witt second overall out of Colleyville in 2019, with Britt going as a 35th-round choice of the White Sox due to his strong commitment to Texas A&M. (He chose not to sign with Chicago.) Smith-Shawver, the club’s No. 2 prospect and No. 97 overall, was a seventh-round pick of Atlanta in 2021. Despite the rigors that pro ball creates, Witt and Britt have been able to stay in close contact throughout the years. They still live about half an hour from one another in Texas during the offseason. Witt’s Minor League career was short-lived as he skyrocketed through the Royals system. Britt eventually transferred to Abilene Christian, where he starred offensively, but hung up his bat for the pitcher’s mound when the Angels selected him in the 17th round of the 2023 Draft. The 24-year-old outfielder-turned-hurler is getting extra time to hone his craft in the Arizona Fall League, with eyes on one day joining Witt up at the game’s highest level. “I think it's been great for us,” Britt said. “We both kind of went different directions -- he went pro ball, I went to college, so we were both playing baseball. I think the offseason is good for us. We get to just be boys again -- play golf, mess around, do whatever.”"
MLB News,Which teams are a fit for a Crochet trade?,https://www.mlb.com/news/garrett-crochet-rumors,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 14:13:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and trade rumors surrounding Garrett Crochet. Nov. 13: These clubs could be involved in trade market for CrochetAlthough the White Sox didn't move Crochet prior to the Trade Deadline, there appears to be little doubt about their intentions for the left-hander this offseason. ""They're going to trade him this winter,"" a rival evaluator told ESPN's Buster Olney at the GM Meetings last week. ""It's not a matter of if; it's a question of when."" Olney shed some light on Crochet's potential market in an article for ESPN+ (subscription required) on Wednesday, noting that general manager Chris Getz is looking for ""a package of prospects constructed around at least one high-ceiling youngster to anchor the deal."" Chicago's preference is for that main piece to be a position player, but the team is open to a pitcher being the centerpiece, ""depending on the depth and quality of the prospects offered."" Based on conversations with industry sources, Olney names the Phillies, Padres, Yankees, Dodgers, Braves, Orioles, Red Sox and Mets as teams that could pursue a Crochet trade. Nov. 9: Mets showing interest in trading for Crochet (report)According to a report in the New York Post, the Mets are ""discussing"" Crochet, who is one of the most likely players to be traded this offseason. It would stand to reason given that three of New York's starters from 2024 -- Sean Manaea, Jose Quintana and Luis Severino -- are free agents. Though the Mets are certainly in position to spend big this offseason, Crochet would be considerably cheaper in his remaining arbitration years than spending toward the top of the free agent pitching market. Nov. 7: Crochet garnering trade interest from many clubs, but one stands outThe White Sox held on to Crochet through the 2024 Trade Deadline when they were receiving calls from many teams interested in acquiring the fireballing left-hander. Now, an even greater number of clubs are trying to maneuver a deal for Crochet, general manager Chris Getz said during this week's General Managers Meetings. Crochet entered this season with only 73 big league innings under his belt over parts of three seasons and a lengthy injury history. But from Opening Day on, he proved he could be an ace. Crochet received his first Major League start in that season opener and proceeded to strike out eight batters and allow one run over six innings. He eventually became a first-time All-Star and ended the season with 209 strikeouts in 146 innings. Given that big jump in innings, Crochet's workload was capped over the final few months of the season. He made it through the year without a stint on the injured list. What do the White Sox want in return for Crochet, who has two years of club control remaining? Getz has made it pretty clear. ""We need to improve our offense, it’s very clear,” he told reporters Tuesday. “With any trade or free agency, we are looking for ways to improve our offense."" One team that could be a match for Chicago in a Crochet trade is the Boston Red Sox. The Red Sox have six position players on MLB Pipeline's Top 100 Prospects list, including three in the top 10. They also have a few attractive pieces already at the big league level who are not yet eligible for arbitration. That group includes first baseman Triston Casas, catcher Connor Wong and Gold Glove outfielder Wilyer Abreu. With so much high-quality position-player depth, ""there’s a widespread sense that the Sox can trade for nearly anyone,"" according to The Boston Globe's Alex Speier (subscription required). MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi said Thursday from the GM Meetings that the Red Sox are ""the team I think a lot of people around here are looking at very carefully"" regarding a Crochet trade."

MLB News,Is an NL East club in play for Bregman?,https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-rumors-trades-and-signings,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 14:52:00 GMT",LATEST FREE AGENT & TRADE RUMORS,"MLB.com We're keeping track of all the latest free agent and trade rumors. The Phillies sign Alex Bregman. That is the prediction of one rival evaluator to ESPN's Buster Olney. The Phillies don't have an opening at third base right now, but they could create one by dealing Alec Bohm, who is on the trade block, per ESPN's Jeff Passan (subscription required). Bohm and Bregman had similar offensive production this year (the former had a 117 OPS+ while the latter had a 118) and both were plus defenders according to outs above average. However, Bregman, a 2024 Gold Glover, has a much longer track record of stellar defense at the hot corner. His has 28 OAA for his career at the position while Bohm has minus-8. Bregman would also bring a large dose of World Series experience to a club that has been thwarted in the postseason in recent years and hasn't won it all since 2008. The Astros have made it clear that re-signing Bregman is their biggest priority of the offseason, but he isn't expected to make his decision any time soon. MLB.com's Mark Feinsand said during a Reddit AMA on Tuesday that he thinks Bregman's chances of remaining with Houston are 50/50. Superstar free agent Juan Soto will start meeting with teams in California this week, and four clubs have appointments on the books, according to a report from ESPN's Jeff Passan (subscription required). The four teams are the Blue Jays, Red Sox, Mets and incumbent Yankees. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman recently suggested in an article for the New York Post that the Blue Jays could to be the biggest threat to sign Soto outside of the two New York teams, who are widely considered the two frontrunners in the Soto sweepstakes. But the Red Sox could also be set to make an aggressive push for Soto, with Passan reporting that they have the outfielder at the top of their ""want list."" Per Heyman, Soto is also expected to meet with the Dodgers as well as two mystery teams. Heyman heard the Giants were planning to meet with Soto, too, but The Athletic's Jayson Stark reported Tuesday night that no meeting has been scheduled yet. Although the White Sox didn't move Garrett Crochet prior to the Trade Deadline, there appears to be little doubt about their intentions for the left-hander this offseason. ""They're going to trade him this winter,"" a rival evaluator told ESPN's Buster Olney at the GM Meetings last week. ""It's not a matter of if; it's a question of when."" Olney shed some light on Crochet's potential market in an article for ESPN+ (subscription required) on Wednesday, noting that general manager Chris Getz is looking for ""a package of prospects constructed around at least one high-ceiling youngster to anchor the deal,"" with a preference for that main piece to be a position player. Based on conversations with industry sources, Olney names the Phillies, Padres, Yankees, Dodgers, Braves, Orioles, Red Sox and Mets as teams that could pursue a Crochet trade. You can follow the latest rumblings on Crochet here. ESPN's Jeff Passan breaks down the markets for the key free agents and trade targets in his 2024-25 offseason preview (subscription required). Here's what he's reporting on potential landing spots for some of the top hitters and pitchers available: FA hitters FA pitchers Trade market The players Passan cites as potentially being available on the trade market this winter include: Pitchers -- White Sox ace Garrett Crochet, Brewers closer Devin Williams, Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley, Cardinals right-hander Sonny Gray, Mariners right-hander Luis Castillo, D-backs left-hander Jordan Montgomery, Rockies reliever Justin Lawrence Position players -- Cubs second baseman Nico Hoerner and outfielder Cody Bellinger, Phillies third baseman Alec Bohm, Cardinals third baseman Nolan Arenado, Guardians first baseman Josh Naylor, Rays second baseman Brandon Lowe and first baseman Yandy Díaz, Giants first baseman LaMonte Wade Jr., Rockies second baseman Brendan Rodgers According to a report from USA Today’s Bob Nightengale, Christian Walker is a popular name on the free-agent market, with at least six teams planning to “aggressively pursue” the first baseman. Walker received a qualifying offer from the D-backs, but he will likely decline it. Nightengale names the Yankees, Mets and Nationals as teams that are expected to join Arizona in pursuit of Walker, who should come with a lower price tag than that of fellow free-agent first baseman Pete Alonso, given the age disparity between the two players. (Walker is four years older.) The Yankees and Mets are also two of the top contenders for Juan Soto, the No. 1 free agent on the market, but both clubs need to address first base as well. With his expected price tag, signing Walker likely wouldn't impact either team's pursuit of Soto, who is headed for one of the largest contracts in MLB history. Walker doesn’t have quite the same power as Alonso, but he’s no slouch with the bat, having recorded 95 homers and an .813 OPS over the past three seasons. In that same time, Alonso has produced 120 homers and an .826 OPS. Walker, meanwhile, is a far better defender, winning three straight Gold Gloves and leading his position with +38 Outs Above Average since the beginning of 2022. Alonso has produced -17 OAA in that span. In addition to the teams Nightengale mentioned, the Astros, Twins, Mariners, Cardinals and Padres could also be involved in the first-base market to some extent. MLB.com's Mark Feinsand lists several favorites to land coveted right-hander Roki Sasaki, including the Giants, Yankees, Mets, Blue Jays, Cubs and Rangers. But he writes that the two most likely landing spots, at least according to one NL executive, would be the Dodgers and Padres. An article in The Athletic (subscription required) adds the Phillies as a team to watch and also suggests that the Padres may have an advantage by way of one of their current starters: Yu Darvish. Sasaki, the consensus top young pitcher in Japan, will be posted by the Chiba Lotte Marines of Nippon Professional Baseball this offseason. Sasaki should inspire an all-out pursuit reminiscent of Shohei Ohtani’s initial contract with the Angels, in league-wide interest and financial scope. Ohtani agreed to a $2.315 million signing bonus with the Angels in December 2017. An unfettered market would have yielded a much larger contract, but foreign-born players are subject to international bonus pool money restrictions unless they are at least 25 years of age and have played as a professional in a foreign league recognized by Major League Baseball for a minimum of six seasons. Ohtani was not yet 25 years old when he was posted by the Ham Fighters, so the Collective Bargaining Agreement classified him as an international amateur. Sasaki falls into the same category now. You can follow the latest Sasaki rumors here. The D-backs are drawing significant trade interest from teams looking for starting pitchers, according to a report from The Athletic (subscription required). Arizona’s rotation includes three pitchers who will be eligible for free agency next offseason: Zac Gallen, Merrill Kelly and Jordan Montgomery. Gallen is entering his final year of arbitration eligibility after earning roughly $10 million in 2024. The 29-year-old missed time with a right hamstring strain this past season, but he garnered top-five finishes in the National League Cy Young Award voting in both 2022 and ‘23. Kelly also missed time due to injury in 2024, sitting out nearly four months with a right shoulder strain, and he just turned 36. However, he had a 3.33 ERA in 63 starts across 2022-23 and stepped up big on the postseason stage for the D-backs a year ago, posting a 2.25 ERA in four starts. He’s signed for just $7 million in 2025 after Arizona exercised his club option. Montgomery signed with Arizona as a free agent in late March, which left him no time for a typical build-up before Opening Day. He went on to post a 6.23 ERA over 25 appearances before exercising his $22.5 million player option to remain with the D-backs for one more season. Montgomery was much more effective in the two years before reaching free agency, recording a 3.34 ERA over 64 starts in the regular season and emerging as a postseason star for the World Series-champion Rangers in 2023 (2.90 ERA). Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. The D-backs’ stable of starters also includes a pair of pre-arbitration hurlers in Brandon Pfaadt (controllable through 2029) and Ryne Nelson (controllable through ‘28) as well as Eduardo Rodriguez, another free-agent addition that went awry for Arizona in 2024. Rodriguez's four-year, $80 million deal runs through 2027 and includes a mutual option for 2028. A left lat strain limited him to 10 starts in 2024, over which he recorded a 5.04 ERA. After operating with a franchise-record payroll in 2024, the D-backs might not have much wiggle room to address all of their needs this offseason, so it’s possible they will consider trading from their rotation surplus to do so. Per The Athletic's report, Arizona is looking to add a late-inning reliever. With Christian Walker, Joc Pederson and Randal Grichuk hitting free agency, the D-backs also need to add offense. Although they’ve posted five straight losing seasons since their 2019 World Series title, the Nationals could be ready to leap back into contention -- if they make the right moves this offseason. Adding a veteran bat to a lineup stacked with young position players such as CJ Abrams, James Wood, Dylan Crews and Luis García Jr. figures to be a priority for Washington this offseason, and MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi thinks slugging outfielder Anthony Santander could be a fit. Santander, 30, finished third in the Majors with 44 homers this past season, behind only Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani. That’s one more home run than the Nationals got from their entire outfield in 2024. The Nationals have also been mentioned as a potential suitor for free agent Juan Soto, who spent five years with Washington before being traded to the Padres in 2022. Soto turned down a 15-year, $440 million extension offer from the Nats before being traded. He is expected to top that deal, both in average annual value and total guaranteed money, this offseason. Given Soto's price tag, Santander may be a more realistic target for the up-and-coming Nationals. However, as Morosi notes, it could behoove Santander to wait until Soto’s situation is settled before signing, as he could be a backup plan for some of the clubs that are involved in the Soto market. According to a report from The Athletic (subscription required), Willy Adames is willing to move off his natural position of shortstop for the right team/contract. That could open up new possible landing spots for the 29-year-old slugger, expanding his market to teams who are set at short but could perhaps use a second baseman or a third baseman. However, in the view of MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi, a position switch won't be necessary, ""because there is sufficient interest in him as a shortstop."" Per Morosi, the Dodgers, Giants, Braves and Red Sox could all pursue Adames to play short. You can follow all the latest rumblings on Adames here. According to reports by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and USA TODAY, eight-time All-Star and 10-time Gold Glove Award-winning third baseman Nolan Arenado could be available in trade discussions if he's willing to waive his no-trade clause. The same goes for veteran starting pitchers Sonny Gray and Lance Lynn. More > The No. 1 item on the Yankees' offseason to-do list remains re-signing Juan Soto. However, he is expected to take his time in making a decision, and the Yanks' roster has multiple areas of need. So while Soto remains the priority, New York has to look for options at other positions. According to MLB Network insiders Jon Heyman and Jon Paul Morosi, they are doing just that. More > Teoscar Hernández is drawing interest from the Red Sox and Orioles among other clubs, sources told MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi. The 32-year-old Hernández is coming off of a great 2024 season, highlighted by a career-best 33 home runs, an All-Star selection and a World Series title with the Dodgers. He makes sense for either AL East club, each of which could lose a slugging outfielder in free agency. Anthony Santander is a free agent after bashing 44 homers in Baltimore this season, and Tyler O'Neill could depart Boston after hitting 31 dingers in only 113 games. Hernández would bring significant right-handed pop to any lineup. That's something Orioles general manager Mike Elias said Thursday is a priority for his club this offseason. Over the past four seasons, Hernández has averaged 29 homers per year and a 126 OPS+. Max Fried may be behind Corbin Burnes and Blake Snell when it comes to the best starting pitchers in free agency this winter, but the 30-year-old left-hander still figures to have a robust market. At least four clubs are in on him, according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman, and they all reside in the AL East: the Yankees, Red Sox, Orioles and Blue Jays. Heyman wrote in the New York Post that the Yanks would like to land a front-line starter this offseason and have checked in on all three of those big-name hurlers. But it's uncertain if New York can get the pitcher it desires while also spending the money necessary to keep Juan Soto in the Bronx. Fried may also be an option for the Cubs. Patrick Mooney and Sahadev Sharma write in The Athletic (subscription required) that Fried ""would check several boxes"" for Chicago, but the club may not be able to meet Fried's asking price. Burnes' first season in the AL East was a stellar one as he pitched to a 2.92 ERA with 181 strikeouts in 194 1/3 innings for the Orioles. Baltimore hopes to keep Burnes, but the No. 1 pitcher in this year's free-agent class may move elsewhere this winter. He just may not move out of the division. Instead, he could join the Yankees or the Red Sox. More > Alex Bregman has played only nine games at second base in his MLB career and none since 2018. But he's open to changing that. Several clubs interested in the Gold Glove third baseman have asked if he would be willing to move to second. Scott Boras, Bregman's agent, said his client would ""amenable"" to such a move, per Bob Nightengale of USA Today. The Astros are hopeful they can bring back their star third baseman. General manager Dana Brown said Tuesday that re-signing Bregman is the team's ""biggest priority."" Bregman joins shortstop Willy Adames as high-profile free-agent infielders who may in a different uniform and at a different position in 2025. Could Ha-Seong Kim be one of the first players off the free-agent market? One source tells MLB.com's Mark Feinsand that Kim has already generated “lots of interest” in the early days of free agency, while a second source said the Giants are focused on signing the 29-year-old. The Brewers have also been connected to Kim, but the Giants appear to be the club most interested in the infielder. More > Juan Soto and Pete Alonso might be the two best bats on the open market this winter. Could they be teammates by the start of the 2025 season? It's not out of the question, according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman. More > Second base will be a priority for the Mariners once again this offseason. They may end up finding their answer at that position overseas. As reported by MLB Network insider Jon Morosi, the Mariners are among the clubs that have ""closely evaluated"" Hye-Seong Kim, who plays for the Kiwoom Heroes in the KBO. Kim, 25, has a .304 career batting average through eight seasons in the KBO. Over the past two seasons, he has batted .331 and stolen 55 bases. He also provides plus defense. Kim is not yet able to negotiate with MLB teams since the Heroes haven't posted him, but that is expected to happen this offseason. Morosi wrote earlier this month that other teams with a need at second base -- Red Sox, Giants, Angels -- could be in the market for Kim. The Dodgers saw him when they played against Kiwoom in an exhibition game before the start of the 2024 season. Manager Dave Roberts said after the game that ""our scouts like [Kim]."" Juan Soto is the top free agent in this year's class, and he is apparently in no rush to sign his next contract. Soto's agent, Scott Boras, indicated Wednesday that the 26-year-old star wants to go through a ""thorough process"" before reaching his decision. ""Due to the volume of interest and Juan's desire to hear [from teams], I can't put a timeframe on [when he will sign], but it's going to be a very thorough process for him,"" Boras said, via ESPN's Jesse Rogers. ""He wants to meet people personally. He wants to talk with them. He wants to hear from them."" MLB Network insider Jon Heyman said Wednesday during his chat on Bleacher Report that he thinks Soto could sign during the Winter Meetings, which will take place from Dec. 8-12 in Dallas. Heyman also mentioned six clubs that he thinks are in the running for Soto. More > Dodgers general manager Brandon Gomes said at the GM meetings on Wednesday that the club plans to move Mookie Betts back to the infield after he began last season at shortstop but later moved back to right field. That begs the question: Does this open up right field for a pursuit of superstar slugger Juan Soto? More > Following his fantastic second half of the 2024 season, Blake Snell is expected to draw interest from many big-market clubs. MLB.com's Mark Feinsand has listed the Giants, Yankees, Mets, Red Sox, Dodgers, Orioles and Blue Jays among the left-hander's potential suitors. An industry source also told Katie Woo and Will Sammon of The Athletic (subscription required) that the Rangers could be in the mix as well. However, that source added that the extent of interest from Toronto and Texas depends on Snell's price tag. More > Nick Pivetta has to choice to make. He can take the qualifying offer, which the Red Sox extended to him on Monday and which would pay him $21.05 million in 2025. Or he can decline the qualifying offer by the Nov. 19 decision deadline and look for a longer or more lucrative contract on the open market. It's an ""interesting decision"" for Pivetta, according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Accepting the QO would represent quite a raise for the 31-year-old right-hander, who made $7.5 million this season. But there appear to be multiple teams interested in him. Per MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi, Pivetta has a ""surprisingly strong"" market. More > Right-handed starter Nathan Eovaldi ranks near the top of the Braves’ wish list, an industry source tells MLB.com's Mark Bowman. Eovaldi became a free agent Monday when he declined his $20 million option to stick with the Rangers through the 2025 season. The 34-year-old can now pursue a multiyear deal that would most likely include an average annual value of at least $20 million. Rangers president of baseball operations Chris Young said Monday that the team will work on bringing Eovaldi back. But with the Braves facing the possibility of losing left-hander Max Fried in free agency, they may fill that void with Eovaldi. He went 12-8 with a 3.80 ERA over 170 2/3 innings this season. Before signing with Texas prior to the 2023 season, Eovaldi spent five years in Boston pitching alongside current Braves ace Chris Sale. More > A few teams are expressing interest in Giants right-hander Camilo Doval, according to Susan Slusser of the San Francisco Chronicle. The 27-year-old is entering his first year of arbitration and is under club control for three more seasons.   Armed with a cutter that regularly touches 100 mph and a high-whiff slider, Doval has been one of the most electric relievers over the past few seasons. He was an All-Star in 2023, a year in which he paced the National League with 39 saves. However, a consistently high walk rate contributed to Doval losing his job as the Giants’ closer in 2024. He was demoted to the Minors in August after recording a 4.70 ERA and issuing 29 walks over 44 innings. He was recalled a couple of weeks later and finished the year in a middle-relief role while Ryan Walker took over as San Francisco’s closer. Doval ended the season with a strong 28.8% K rate and an elite 60.5% ground-ball rate. However, his 14.4% walk rate tied the Guardians’ Triston McKenzie for the second-highest in MLB (minimum 50 innings pitched). The Brewers declined the $10.5 million club option on closer Devin Williams on Sunday, a source told MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. The two-time All-Star remains under club control as he is heading into his final year of arbitration. The salary he will get via arbitration is likely to be less than the $10.5 million it would have cost the Brewers to exercise the option (per MLB Trade Rumors, he's projected to make $7.7 million), so declining it is not a surprising move. But it's no guarantee that Williams will remain with Milwaukee into next season. Passan writes that Williams is a trade candidate, and Brewers general manager Matt Arnold said last month that the team will ""stay open-minded"" about the closer's future. Although Williams missed the first four months of the regular season due to a back injury and surrendered a series-changing homer to the Mets' Pete Alonso in Game 3 of the NL Wild Card Series, the right-hander was fantastic in between those two points. Williams allowed only three earned runs and struck out 38 batters over 21 2/3 innings during the regular season. He was the NL Rookie of the Year in 2020 and then made the All-Star team in 2022 and 2023. Over that two-year span, Williams appeared in 126 games and recorded a 1.73 ERA. The Brewers have dealt multiple star pitchers nearing free agency in recent years. They traded Corbin Burnes to the Orioles prior to the 2024 season, his final year of club control. They also sent former closer Josh Hader to the Padres ahead of the 2022 Trade Deadline. Hader became a free agent after the 2023 season and signed a five-year, $95 million contract with the Astros."

See you in another life.  I know you’ll be waiting for me with open paws. pic.twitter.com/ELaQDvXkW1 Hadji, the internet-famous Bengal cat of Mets broadcaster Keith Hernandez, passed away last week at the age of 22. Hernandez announced the news on social media on Wednesday. “It’s with a heavy heart that I must tell you that I had to put Hadji down last week,” he posted on X. “It was his time to go. I loved him so much and miss him dearly. He was a great companion for 22 yrs. RIP my little guy.” The world first came to know Hadji, who was named for a character in the 1960s TV cartoon “Jonny Quest,” in 2018, when Hernandez started posting about his grey-and-white feline companion on what was then known as Twitter. They immediately became some of his most popular posts. “I cannot tell you how many people have twittered me pictures of their cat laying out in the sun going, ‘My cat is madly in love with Hadji. Can we hook them up?’” Hernandez told The New York Times in 2018. Bengal cats are known for their markings that resemble those of leopards or jaguars and have a lifespan of 12-16 years, according to WebMD. Hernandez celebrated Hadji’s 22nd birthday back on Oct. 10, just 10 days before the Mets Hall of Famer’s own birthday. HAPPY 22nd BIRTHDAY HADJI!! pic.twitter.com/ZqxVc51JnX Hadji was also beloved by Mets fans, who brought cardboard cutouts of his face to games and bought T-shirts with his striped visage from Hernandez’s official store. Condolences poured into the replies to Hernandez’s post on X and those on Instagram by the Mets; SNY TV; and Gary, Keith and Ron, an account dedicated to Hernandez and his broadcast partners Gary Cohen and Ron Darling.

MLB News,"Finalists for MVP, Cy Young, Rookie & Manager of the Year revealed",https://www.mlb.com/news/2024-bbwaa-finalists-announced-mvp-cy-young-and-more,"Tue, 12 Nov 2024 00:40:00 GMT",,"Manny Randhawa It’s awards season, and that means some of MLB’s most prestigious hardware will soon be handed out as the Baseball Writers’ Association of America recognizes the best of the 2024 season with the Jackie Robinson Rookie of the Year Awards, the Manager of the Year Awards, the Cy Young Awards and the Most Valuable Player Awards. The American League and National League finalists for each of those awards -- representing the top three finishers -- were revealed live on MLB Network on Monday night. The 2024 award winners will be announced next week on MLB Network, on the following days at 6 p.m. ET: Jackie Robinson Rookie of the Year: Monday, Nov. 18Manager of the Year: Tuesday, Nov. 19Cy Young: Wednesday, Nov. 20Most Valuable Player: Thursday, Nov. 21 Here’s a look at each finalist, listed in alphabetical order for each award: Francisco Lindor, SS (Mets) Lindor started off slow at the plate, but in mid-May, he turned things around and never looked back. On May 20, the switch-hitter had a slash line of .193/.268/.348. From there, he hit .309/.377/.566 with 26 homers to help fuel the Mets’ run to the postseason. Overall, Lindor finished with an .844 OPS and 33 home runs. His strong defense at shortstop, combined with his production at the plate, resulted in an fWAR of 7.8, tied for the highest mark in his career. Read more > Ketel Marte, 2B (D-backs) On the heels of helping lead the D-backs to a surprise World Series run in 2023, Marte set career highs in home runs (36), RBIs (95) and OPS+ (155) in 136 games this season. He was named an All-Star for the second time in his career and was selected as a Gold Glove Award finalist and an MVP finalist for the first time. Hand, back and ankle injuries hampered Marte, but he was able to put up prodigious numbers when in the lineup, particularly from June 2-Aug. 2, when he posted a 1.105 OPS with 16 homers in 48 games to help Arizona go from five games under .500 to eight games over. Read more > Shohei Ohtani, DH (Dodgers) He wasn’t able to pitch in 2024 due to elbow surgery last fall, but Ohtani became the first player in MLB history to hit 50 or more home runs (54) and steal 50 or more bases (59) in the same season. He led the NL in runs scored (134, also led the Majors), home runs (54), RBIs (130), on-base percentage (.390), slugging (.646) and total bases (411, also led MLB). After winning AL MVP in 2021 and '23 with the Angels, Ohtani is trying to become just the second player to win MVP Awards in both leagues (Frank Robinson, 1961 with Cincinnati and '66 with Baltimore) and the first to do it in back-to-back years. He would also be the first full-time designated hitter to win MVP. Read more > Aaron Judge, CF (Yankees) Judge had a record-breaking 2022 season, when he set a new AL mark by hitting 62 home runs, but he somehow topped that campaign this season. Though he hit “only” 58 homers this time, Judge had a higher OPS (1.159 to 1.111), higher OPS+ (223 to 210) and one more total base (392 to 391) than in his 2022 AL MVP season. The 1.159 OPS was the highest in any full season in 20 years (Barry Bonds, 1.422 in 2004). If Judge wins the MVP Award, it will be the second of his career and his second in the last three years. Read more > Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Juan Soto, RF (Yankees) Soto was all the Yankees could’ve asked for after he was acquired in a trade with the Padres last Dec. 7. He led the AL in runs scored (128) and hit .288/.419/.569 with a career-high 41 home runs. He was named an All-Star for the fourth time and reached the 200-homer milestone at age 25. The closest Soto has been to winning an MVP Award was when he finished runner-up to Bryce Harper for the NL honor in 2021. Read more > Bobby Witt Jr., SS (Royals) After finishing one steal shy of a 30-homer/50-steal campaign in 2023, Witt had an even better season at age 24 in 2024 -- he led the Majors by batting .332 to go along with a .977 OPS, 32 homers and 31 steals for the surprising Royals, who reached the postseason for the first time in nine years. His 10.4 fWAR set a Royals record, eclipsing George Brett’s 9.1 mark from his 1980 MVP season. Read more > Chris Sale, LHP (Braves) Sale enjoyed a renaissance in his age-35 season, leading the Majors with 18 wins and a 2.38 ERA. He also led the NL with 225 strikeouts to claim the pitching Triple Crown in the Senior Circuit while walking only 39 over 177 2/3 innings for Atlanta. He also led MLB with a 2.09 FIP and 174 ERA+, putting him in a strong position to win his first Cy Young Award after finishing among the top five in balloting six times. Read more > Paul Skenes, RHP (Pirates) Skenes managed to not only live up to the hype as one of the most anticipated pitching prospects in recent memory; he exceeded it. The flamethrowing right-hander who developed his own signature pitch -- a “splinker” -- went 11-3 with a 1.96 ERA over 23 starts after making his MLB debut on May 11. Though he only pitched 133 innings, he set a Pirates rookie record with 170 strikeouts and became the first rookie pitcher to start the All-Star Game in 29 years. Read more > Zack Wheeler, RHP (Phillies) A perennial Cy Young Award candidate, Wheeler turned in the finest season of his career in 2024, posting a career-best 2.57 ERA and leading the NL with a 0.96 WHIP. He hit the 200-inning mark for the second time (finishing right at 200) and earned his second All-Star selection. Wheeler is looking for his first Cy Young Award after finishing second in the NL balloting in 2021. Read more > Emmanuel Clase, RHP (Guardians) It’s rare to see a reliever named a finalist for the Cy Young Award – Francisco Rodriguez was the last in 2008 with the Angels – given the significantly lower number of innings pitched, a relief pitcher has to be overpowering and utterly dominant to garner consideration for the ultimate pitching honor. But Clase definitely meets that criteria for his work this past season, when his ERA was a microscopic 0.61 and he saved an AL-high 47 games for Cleveland. Read more > Seth Lugo, RHP (Royals) In his age-34 campaign, Lugo had his best season as a full-time starter, pitching to an even 3.00 ERA and 1.09 WHIP over a career-high 206 2/3 innings for Kansas City. He played a key role in the Royals’ surprise postseason run. The spin savant had a fastball run value in the 94th percentile and a breaking ball run value in the 99th percentile among qualified pitchers, according to Statcast. Read more > Tarik Skubal, LHP (Tigers) Skubal had the breakout year many saw coming, winning the AL Triple Crown for pitching by leading the league in wins (18), ERA (2.39) and strikeouts (228, also led MLB). He was a huge reason the Tigers reached the postseason for the first time in 10 years. With a fastball that regularly tops 100 mph, complemented by a secondary repertoire that includes a changeup, slider and knuckle-curve, the 27-year-old had a 30.3% strikeout rate and walked only 4.6% of the batters he faced. Read more > Jackson Chourio, OF (Brewers) Chourio was a highly touted prospect whom the Brewers signed to an eight-year, $82 million contract extension before he even made his MLB debut, a record for a player who had never played in a Major League game. While he struggled at the plate to begin the season, he turned things around in June. On June 1, his OPS was .575, but from there, he hit .305/.360/.528 with 16 homers in 97 games to help Milwaukee win the NL Central. He became the first player to record a 20-homer/20-steal season before his 21st birthday. Read more > Jackson Merrill, CF (Padres) Merrill made the Padres’ roster out of Spring Training and immediately showed he belonged in the big leagues. He was named an All-Star and led MLB rookies in home runs (24, tied with Colton Cowser), RBIs (90), hits (162), batting average (.292) and OPS (.826). Merrill was also extremely clutch, becoming the youngest player (21 years old) to hit five game-tying or go-ahead homers in the ninth inning or later in the same season. By the way, he did all of this while playing a premium position in center field, a position he’d never played as a professional. Read more > Paul Skenes, RHP (Pirates) Less than a year after being drafted first overall by the Pirates out of LSU, Skenes made his MLB debut on May 11 – and wasted no time showing why his arrival in The Show had been so highly anticipated. Skenes led MLB rookies with a 1.96 ERA (minimum 100 innings pitched) and finished just four punchouts behind Shota Imanaga (174) for the rookie strikeout lead. The 22-year-old became the first rookie pitcher to record at least 170 strikeouts and a sub-2.00 ERA since earned runs became official in 1913. Skenes also joined late Marlins star José Fernández as the only rookies in the past 35 seasons with double-digit wins, at least 150 strikeouts and a sub-2.50 ERA. Read more > Colton Cowser, OF (Orioles) Although he struggled in his first taste of the Majors -- .433 OPS in 26 games with Baltimore in 2023 -- Cowser came out of the gate hot at the plate in ’24, producing a .303/.372/.632 slash line with six homers over the first month of the season. He finished with 24 home runs, tying Merrill for the most by a rookie this season, and led AL rookies with a 123 OPS+ to help the Orioles reach the postseason for the second consecutive year. Read more > Luis Gil, RHP (Yankees) Though he had cups of coffee in the bigs in 2021 and ‘22, Gil fully burst into the baseball consciousness in May, when he pitched to an incredible 0.70 ERA over six starts (38 2/3 innings) and struck out 44 while walking 12. Opponents hit just .109 against him that month as he vaulted into the early AL Rookie of the Year conversation. He had his ups and downs from there, but still finished with a 3.50 ERA and a 26.8% strikeout rate over 29 starts for New York. Read more > Austin Wells, C (Yankees) In 13 of those 29 starts by Gil, his fellow rookie Wells was behind the plate. It took Wells some time to get going at the dish, but from June 5 through the end of August, Wells hit .294/.385/.533 with 11 homers in 59 games. Behind the plate, he finished third among qualified catchers in framing runs (12) and was also above average with 4 blocks above average. Read more > Carlos Mendoza (Mets) In his first season as manager, Mendoza led the Mets to a Wild Card berth with a surge beginning in June that eventually led all the way to the NL Championship Series. New York began the season 0-5, and on June 2, the Mets were 11 games under .500. But from there, Mendoza guided the Mets to a 65-38 record to slip into the postseason on Sept. 30. New York went an MLB-best 28-16 in one-run games and had 41 comeback wins. Read more > Pat Murphy (Brewers) One would not have guessed that Murphy was in his first season as a full-time big league manager with how comfortable he looked at the helm in Milwaukee. He had the Brewers playing crisp, details-oriented baseball as they cruised to their third NL Central title in four years, despite the preseason trade of ace Corbin Burnes to the Orioles and the loss of a resurgent Christian Yelich to another back injury in mid-July. If Murphy wins the award, he would be the first Manager of the Year winner in Brewers history. Read more > Mike Shildt (Padres) Shildt was hired to right the ship after the Padres finished 82-80 and missed the playoffs in 2023 and he more than delivered, leading San Diego to 93 wins and a Wild Card berth. Down the stretch, the Padres only got stronger, going 34-18 in August and September to cement their place atop the Wild Card standings, even briefly closing the gap with the Dodgers in the NL West to two games. Shildt previously won Manager of the Year with the Cardinals in 2019. Read more > A.J. Hinch (Tigers) In his fourth season at the helm in Detroit, Hinch led the Tigers to their first postseason appearance in a decade. He shepherded a young roster led by Skubal on a surprise push that really gained steam in late August, with the Tigers winning 24 of their final 34 games to earn a Wild Card berth. Read more > Matt Quatraro (Royals) In another AL Central surprise, Quatraro led the Royals to an 86-76 record and their first playoff appearance in nine years. With MVP finalist Witt leading the lineup and a sturdy starting rotation, Kansas City made one of the most dramatic turnarounds in MLB history -- just a season ago, the club lost 106 games. Read more > Stephen Vogt (Guardians) Vogt rounds out this AL Central trifecta of finalists after the first-year manager steered Cleveland to a surprise division title and the second-best record in the AL. Entering the season with large shoes to fill -- those of veteran skipper Terry Francona -- Vogt acquitted himself brilliantly in his first season at the helm, which bodes well for a bright future in Cleveland.

MLB News,Do Phillies have a shot at Japanese star Sasaki?,https://www.mlb.com/news/phillies-chances-to-sign-roki-sasaki,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 14:46:04 GMT",,"Todd Zolecki This story was excerpted from Todd Zolecki’s Phillies Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. The Phillies last November signed Aaron Nola to a seven-year, $172 million contract, then took a shot at Japanese right-hander Yoshinobu Yamamoto. They offered him more than $300 million. The Phillies fell short, but they knew when they made the offer that they had little chance to sign him. Yamamoto, 26, wanted to play for the Dodgers or Yankees, and no amount of money from the Phillies was going to change his mind. It was true in 2017, too, when Shohei Ohtani was a free agent. The Phillies put together a presentation for Ohtani, touting the organization and Philadelphia. But they heard nothing back from Ohtani’s camp until his agent, Nez Balelo, told them that they did not advance to the second round. It wasn’t a surprise. Months earlier, Ohtani expressed indifference toward Philly in an interview with MLB.com. Ohtani said he wanted to get a photo in front of the Rocky Balboa statue once he got to the United States. The reporter reminded Ohtani that Philadelphia had a baseball team. “No, I just want to visit there,” he said. The Phillies’ failed pursuits of Ohtani and Yamamoto are mentioned because star Japanese right-hander Roki Sasaki, 23, is hitting the free-agent market soon. Last weekend, his NPB team, the Chiba Lotte Marines, stated their intentions to post Sasaki, making him available to every MLB team, including the Phillies. Unlike Yamamoto, Sasaki is not going to make $300 million in his next contract. Because he is under 25 and he has not reached six years of service in a foreign major league, he is subject to MLB's international amateur signing bonus pool rules, setting a cap on his contract. His contract is going to look more like Ohtani’s first contract ($2.3 million) than Yamamoto’s. If Sasaki posts before Dec. 2, he can only sign during the 2024 international amateur signing period since a 45-day negotiating window would expire before the '25 signing period begins. The Phillies have only $42,200 in their ‘24 pool, which isn’t good. But if Sasaki posts between Dec. 2-15, he can sign during either period. The Phillies have $6,261,000 in their 2025 pool. MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand cited a source who said the teams most likely to have a shot at Sasaki are West Coast clubs and those that have signed Japanese players in the past. (The Phillies have never signed a player straight from NPB.) The Dodgers and Padres are considered favorites, but the Giants, Yankees, Mets, Blue Jays, Cubs and Rangers were among teams mentioned by executives. But the fact Sasaki is posting soon means he isn’t only motivated by money. And because he is limited in how much money he can make, he can legitimately consider every team if he chooses. Maybe he considers the Phillies -- just because the Dodgers signed Ohtani and Yamamoto last winter doesn’t mean every Japanese player is going to sign with L.A. forever -- who have beefed up their presence in Asia the past few years. They believe it will eventually pay off. “There’s just so much talent over there,” Phillies general manager Sam Fuld said in March. “As an organization, we want to put our best foot forward and put ourselves in a spot to land some of that premium talent that exists there.”"
MLB News,"Bazzana, top pick in '24 Draft, makes Australian national team debut against Japan",https://www.mlb.com/news/travis-bazzana-debuts-with-australian-national-team,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 16:37:02 GMT",,"Michael Clair Just 22 years old and Travis Bazzana already has a lifetime's worth of accomplishments: He was the MVP of the Cape Cod League in 2023 and was named the Pac-12 Player of the Year for his performance with Oregon State last year. He was the No. 1 overall pick in the Draft by the Guardians -- becoming the first Australian player to be selected in the first round. He even captained his high school's cricket team. On Wednesday night in Nagoya, Japan, Bazzana fulfilled another dream: He made his debut with the senior national team. While playing for the U-18 squad in 2019, he made a note in his phone, projecting himself to be the leadoff hitter and second baseman for the national team at the 2026 World Baseball Classic. Instead, he found himself leading off a little earlier, this time in the Premier12 tournament, which pits the top-12 ranked baseball nations against one another. (Another difference from this dream: He was playing left field, not the keystone.) Coming to bat in the top of the first against Samurai Japan southpaw Haruto Inoue, Bazzana worked the count full before fisting a bloop single into the outfield. MLB Pipeline's No. 12 overall prospect was on the board. “You have to attack a pitcher like that in the right spots in the zone,"" Bazzana said after the game. ""I was just trying to get the ball in the middle on the inner-half. If I am on time to that, I have a good chance to get line drives and get hits.” What does Travis Bazzana do in his first senior men's national team at-bat?@WBSC @Premier12 @CleGuardians pic.twitter.com/9t2is7jCcJ Bazzana picked up a second hit in the top of the sixth, lining a ball to right-field and knocking Inoue out of the game. Bazzana would come around to score when Twins prospect Rixon Wingrove blasted a two-run shot. Despite the multihit game from the team's new superstar, Australia lost the game, 9-3, to Japan. ""It’s a team game,"" Bazzana said afterward. ""Two hits was good in this environment, but it’s disappointing the way we played, so it only means so much."" A consummate competitor with high expectations from himself, Bazzana wasn't even pleased with his own performance. ""I think my approach was consistent for how I wanted to attack the pitching. There was quality pitching throughout the game, but I had a plan and it worked out for two at-bats but the other two I missed two pitches to hit,"" Bazzana said. “I think we need to learn what we did poorly tonight, but not take it into the next game. Play with confidence. Trust the players next to us. But we have to play with confidence and not let this game lower our expectations of winning. Refresh, learn from mistakes, but play with great confidence.” Thank you to Eric Balnar for reporting assistance."
MLB News,A new team joins the Soto sweepstakes (report),https://www.mlb.com/news/juan-soto-rumors,"Tue, 12 Nov 2024 14:45:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and rumors surrounding Juan Soto. Nov. 12: Red Sox join the Soto sweepstakes (report)In addition to the Yankees, Mets and Blue Jays, the Red Sox are also expected to meet with Soto this week, per a report from ESPN's Jeff Passan (subscription required). Passan reports that Boston has Soto ""at the top of its want list."" The two New York teams, Toronto and the Red Sox all have meetings scheduled with Soto -- the Blue Jays' will be first, according to Passan -- and other teams like the Dodgers and Rays have shown interest. Passan writes that the Mets and Yankees are still the favorites to land Soto. He expects Soto to sign with a team before the end of the year, and maybe even by the MLB Winter Meetings, which begin on Dec. 9. Nov. 12: Are the Blue Jays the biggest threat to pry Soto away from New York?The field of participants in the Soto sweepstakes has narrowed to eight, according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman in an article for the New York Post -- the Yankees, Mets, Dodgers, Blue Jays, Giants, Red Sox and two ""mystery"" teams. But he suggests that Toronto may be the biggest threat to Soto leaving New York after his lone season with the Yankees. ""The Jays are viewed by industry sources as a viable obstacle to the favored Yankees and Mets, thanks to a well-heeled ownership and strong incentive to improve coming off the abject disappointment of 2024,"" Heyman writes. Toronto did, indeed, have a disappointing 2024 campaign, finishing with a 74-88 record and missing the postseason despite boasting stars such as Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette on the roster. And it should be noted that the Blue Jays were significant players in the pursuit of Shohei Ohtani last offseason before Ohtani signed a record 10-year, $700 million contract to join the Dodgers. The Blue Jays have a meeting scheduled with Soto in California this week -- and will be the first team to meet with him, according to a report from ESPN's Jeff Passan (subscription required), before the Red Sox, Mets and Yankees also do so. Nov. 8: Yanks ready to make their pitch to Soto (report)As the Mets prepare to meet with Soto next week, the Yankees are getting ready to put their own plan into action to re-sign their superstar slugger. Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner has also scheduled a meeting with Soto and is also expected to fly to California in about a week and a half, according to a report from the New York Post on Friday. Per the report, the Yankees have been assured they will be able to meet with Soto even after the Mets have their sitdown. The New York rivals are two of the favorites to land Soto, the marquee free agent on the market this winter. Soto had arguably the best season of his career in 2024 after the Yankees acquired him from the Padres in a blockbuster trade last December. The 26-year-old batted .288 with 41 home runs, 109 RBIs, 128 runs scored and a .989 OPS and led New York to the American League pennant. Nov. 7: Mets set to visit SotoMets owner Steve Cohen plans to travel to Southern California next week to meet with Soto and his agent Scott Boras, according to Mike Puma of the New York Post. This report comes just one day after Boras noted that the 26-year-old Soto will go through a ""thorough process"" before making a decision. So while New York appears to be one of the first clubs to begin making its push for Soto, it certainly won't be the last to do so in the coming weeks. Nov. 6: Soto will be 'thorough' in free-agency decisionSoto is the top free agent in this year's class, and he is apparently in no rush to sign his next contract. Soto's agent, Scott Boras, indicated Wednesday that the 26-year-old star wants to go through a ""thorough process"" before reaching his decision. ""Due to the volume of interest and Juan's desire to hear [from teams], I can't put a timeframe on [when he will sign], but it's going to be a very thorough process for him,"" Boras said, via ESPN's Jesse Rogers. ""He wants to meet people personally. He wants to talk with them. He wants to hear from them."" MLB Network insider Jon Heyman said Wednesday during his chat on Bleacher Report that he thinks Soto could sign during the Winter Meetings, which will take place from Dec. 8-12 in Dallas. Heyman also mentioned six clubs that he thinks are in the running for Soto: the Yankees, Mets, Blue Jays, Dodgers, Giants and Red Sox. There may also be a small-market ""mystery team"" in the mix, per Heyman. However, according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, league executives think the battle to land the four-time All-Star will ultimately come down to the two New York teams. ""It’s the Yankees or the Mets,"" one American League executive said. Nov. 6: Did the Dodgers just open up RF for Soto?Dodgers general manager Brandon Gomes said at the GM meetings on Wednesday that the club plans to move Mookie Betts back to the infield after he began last season at shortstop but later moved back to right field. That begs the question: Does this open up right field for a pursuit of Soto? More > Oct. 31: Report: Soto eyeing record deal; many clubs already showing interestSoto has been a free agent for less than 24 hours, but a bunch of teams have already been in contact with him, according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman. Heyman writes in the New York Post that eight teams checked in with Soto in the hours after he and the Yankees lost to the Dodgers in World Series Game 5 on Wednesday. By Thursday morning, the number of interested clubs was up to 11. However, it's unclear how many of those teams will meet Soto's asking price. Per Heyman, $700 million -- or more -- is seen as Soto's ""new magic number."" That would match the total value of Shohei Ohtani's contract with the Dodgers, but much of that money is deferred, lowering the deal's present-day value. Soto, conversely, is looking for a ""solid"" $700 million, according to Heyman. The incumbent Yankees are likely to make a strong effort to bring him back, but while Soto said after New York’s season-ending loss that he was happy with the team and the city, he also made it clear he’s not giving the Bronx Bombers an edge over any other potential suitor. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. “I feel like every team has the same opportunities when I go into free agency,” Soto said. ""I don't want to say anyone has an advantage, because at the end of the day we're gonna look at what they have and how much they want me."" The Mets and Dodgers could be the Yankees' top competitors for Soto. Heyman adds that the Giants, Blue Jays and Red Sox ""are expected to check in, and word, shockingly, is two small-market teams already have."" Oct. 27: Could Soto become teammates with Ohtani in LA?Soto and the Yankees are currently battling Shohei Ohtani and the Dodgers in the World Series. In 2025, could Soto and the presumptive National League MVP return to the Fall Classic as teammates? MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reports in the New York Post that the Dodgers intend to go after Soto in free agency ""if he's interested"" in coming to Los Angeles. The Dodgers spent more than $1 billion in free agency last offseason, mostly on Ohtani and World Series Game 2 star Yoshinobu Yamamoto. However, because the large majority of Ohtani's $700 contract is deferred until 2034 and beyond, the Dodgers have the financial flexibility to go after just about anyone on the open market. However, there is one big caveat: Does Soto want to play again on the West Coast? According to Heyman, ""Yankees people"" don't think Soto wants to return to Southern California after spending parts of two seasons with the Padres before he was traded to the Yankees in December. ""As for Soto and the Dodgers, a Yankees person had two words: 'Never happen,'"" Heyman wrote. ""... Many do see the Yankees and Mets holding an edge in the highly anticipated free-agent derby since there was suggestion early in [Soto's] tenure in San Diego that the Dominican star preferred to be on the East Coast, where he started with the Nationals in Washington."" Yet, Heyman also writes that the Padres and Soto were said to be ""down the road"" toward a long-term contract agreement last year, before Padres owner Peter Seidler passed away. The Dodgers have been in the market for almost every headline free agent over the past several years. Beyond the players they landed -- Ohtani, Yamamoto, Freddie Freeman, etc., they also tried to sign Bryce Harper prior to the 2019 season and Gerrit Cole the following winter. It sounds like they will at least do their due diligence on this winter's best available player. Oct. 24: Will it take more than $600 million to sign Soto?Soto probably isn't focused on his upcoming winter as a free agent right now. On the eve of the 2024 World Series, Soto is preparing to be at his best to help the Yankees capture their 28th World Series title. But once the Fall Classic is over, Soto will have to turn his attention to what's next. He will be the top available free agent, hitting the market at just 26 years old and on the back of a spectacular season with New York, no matter what happens in the World Series. In short, Soto is going to get paid a lot of money. But just how much? The Athletic's Jim Bowden (subscription required) has made a prediction: $622 million over 15 years. ""Most executives believe he’ll end up somewhere between $550 million and $650 million, which will probably limit his market to both New York teams and possibly the Blue Jays,"" Bowden wrote. ""Other teams such as the Dodgers, Phillies, Rangers and Nationals also could emerge for Soto."" Any number in that range would trail only Shohei Ohtani's $700 million deal with the Dodgers from last December in terms of total value. It would also be the longest contract in big league history. If Bowden is spot-on with his prediction, Soto's annual average value of $41.4 million would rank as the fourth-most in MLB history, behind only Ohtani's $70 million and the $43.4 million that pitchers Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander made this year. But that might still not be enough. The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal said on Wednesday that he thinks ""Soto's AAV is going to start with a five."" In present-day dollars, a $50+ million AAV would surpass Ohtani's contract because the large majority of his money is deferred until 2034 and beyond. MLB.com's experts agreed last month that the Yankees, Mets, Nationals and Giants are the top contenders for Soto, although MLB Network insider Jon Heyman has reported that the Blue Jays are believed to be a possible suitor as well."

MLB News,All-Trade Rumor Team: One at each position who could be on the move,https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-trade-rumors-top-players-for-2024-2025-hot-stove,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 04:43:05 GMT",,"Mark Feinsand Just as Shohei Ohtani’s free agency was the top story of last winter, the Juan Soto sweepstakes surely will be the headliner of this Hot Stove season. But executives at this month’s General Managers Meetings began to get the feeling that the trade market may provide as much intrigue as the free agents will during the coming weeks and months. Last offseason, the Yankees made a blockbuster deal for Soto and traded for Alex Verdugo, the Dodgers acquired Tyler Glasnow, the Braves traded for Chris Sale, the Orioles made a big move to add Corbin Burnes and the Padres did the same to acquire Dylan Cease. All those moves helped shape the 2024 postseason picture. For the seventh consecutive year, MLB.com has put together an All-Trade Rumor Team -- one position at a time -- looking at the key players whose names figure to be staples on the trade market in the coming months. SP: Garrett Crochet, White SoxCrochet was one of the most talked-about players not to be dealt at the Trade Deadline, as the White Sox chose to hold on to their ace during his breakout season. There was concern about his innings count in the second half, which might have given some suitors pause, but that won’t be an issue during the offseason. Buzz factor: HighCrochet is considered the most likely candidate in baseball to be moved this winter, as aces with two years of eligibility for salary arbitration don’t come around often. Chicago should be able to find a number of clubs willing to pony up significant prospect packages for the 25-year-old left-hander. RP: Devin Williams, BrewersMilwaukee declined a $10.5 million club option for 2025, but Williams remains under club contractual control in his final year of arbitration eligibility. Given the Brewers’ annual payroll situation, it’s possible they could look to move their closer with only one year remaining until he becomes a free agent. Trevor Megill filled in admirably as the closer for the first half of the season, so Milwaukee knows it has a Plan B if Williams is traded. Buzz factor: MediumBrewers general manager Matt Arnold said he will “stay open-minded” when it comes to a potential trade of Williams. So while there’s no indication as of now that the Brewers plan to move him, it could eventually be in play. C: Christian Vázquez, TwinsMinnesota is expected to trim payroll this offseason. With Ryan Jeffers under club contractual control for two more years, dealing Vázquez and his $10 million salary wouldn’t be a surprise. The 34-year-old has been unable to repeat his breakout 2019 season at the plate, but he remains a solid defender who can handle a pitching staff. Buzz factor: MediumClubs seeking help behind the plate won’t have a ton of options. If the Twins are open to paying down part of the final year of Vázquez’s contract or include a prospect in a trade, he could be on the move this winter. Minnesota could also opt to move Jeffers to address other roster needs. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. 1B: Yandy Díaz, RaysDíaz took a step backward following his 2023 All-Star campaign, though he posted a slash line of .297/.355/.447 after May 1. The 33-year-old’s Statcast numbers also show he’s still capable of a big year. Díaz ranked in the top 15% in average exit velocity, hard-hit percentage, squared-up percentage, chase percentage, whiff percentage and strikeout percentage. Buzz factor: MediumDíaz’s name was mentioned in multiple rumors prior to the Trade Deadline in July. With a $10 million salary and $12 million club option for 2026 (with no buyout), he could be an attractive option for teams seeking corner-infield help. 2B: Brandon Lowe, RaysAs with Díaz, Lowe’s salary makes him a candidate to be moved by the Rays. The 30-year-old has missed more than 50 games in each of the past two seasons but managed to hit 21 home runs in both years. The Rays exercised their $10.5 million contract option for 2025, but they could look to move Lowe to free up payroll or address other areas of the roster. Buzz factor: LowLowe’s contract also includes an $11.5 million club option for 2026, giving an acquiring team two years of control at that price. Díaz appears to be the more likely player for the Rays to move. But if freeing up payroll is a priority, a Lowe trade can’t be counted out. SS: Bo Bichette, Blue JaysBichette had the worst season of his career, as injuries limited him to 81 games, during which he posted a .599 OPS and only four home runs. His salary jumps to $16.5 million in 2025, after which he’s eligible for free agency. Buzz factor: LowToronto plans to give it another run with Bichette and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. before the pair become free agents. But even if the Blue Jays decide to shake things up, Bichette’s poor season makes it unlikely that they would get proper value in return prior to the season. If Toronto’s season goes awry, he could be a midseason trade candidate. 3B: Ryan McMahon, RockiesColorado declined to make McMahon available at the Trade Deadline. But with its rebuild seemingly in the beginning stages and not many tradable assets, moving the third baseman might be the best way to add young talent this winter. Buzz factor: LowThe Rockies aren’t typically ones to shake up the trade market, but McMahon has three years and $44 million remaining on his six-year, $70 million contract, a nice price for a 29-year-old who has hit at least 20 home runs in each of his past five full seasons. OF: Luis Robert Jr., White SoxIt was somewhat surprising that the White Sox didn’t deal Robert in July. Following their 121-loss season, the rebuild figures to kick into high gear. Robert had a disappointing season, hitting 14 home runs with 35 RBIs and a .657 OPS in 100 games, so Chicago could wait until next season and hope he gets off to a good start before trading him. Buzz factor: MediumNothing is off the table on the South Side this winter, as general manager Chris Getz has a tall task ahead of him to get the White Sox back to respectability. Robert is signed for $15 million in 2025, with club options in 2026 and ’27 ($20 million each with $2 million buyouts). It remains to be seen whether he can bounce back to his 2023 All-Star form. OF: Nick Castellanos, PhilliesPhiladelphia considered trading Castellanos last winter, but there were no takers for the three years and $60 million left on his contract. With two years and $40 million remaining, Philadelphia could find a team in need of a power bat, especially after Castellanos’ strong second half (10 home runs, 39 RBIs, .839 OPS in 66 games). Buzz factor: MediumAlthough he’s headed into his 13th big league season, Castellanos will turn only 33 in March. He played 162 games this season -- 157 of them in right field -- and has been sturdy throughout his career. The Phillies could look to change the look of their lineup, which has had too much chase and swing-and-miss in recent years. OF: Taylor Ward, AngelsThe Angels dealt their impending free agents at the Trade Deadline, but GM Perry Minasian chose to hold on to players signed through 2025 and beyond. Ward is eligible for arbitration for two more years, and after setting career highs with 25 home runs and 75 RBIs, the 30-year-old should have value on the trade market this offseason. Buzz factor: MediumWard isn’t the type of player who will change a franchise’s fortunes, but he can make a legitimate impact on an already solid lineup. The Angels could capitalize on the club contractual control to import more young talent into the organization. DH: Brent Rooker, AthleticsYou might not have noticed it, but Rooker was one of MLB’s best offensive players in 2024, belting 39 home runs with 112 RBIs and a .927 OPS in 145 games. The Athletics are still in the rebuilding phase, so capitalizing on Rooker’s past two seasons -- he has 69 homers with an .876 OPS since joining the club in 2023 -- would be a logical move this offseason. Buzz factor: MediumRooker recently turned 30, yet he is arbitration-eligible for the first time this winter, giving any potential acquiring club three years of contractual control. That’s the type of player who can bring back a sizable return for a young club like the Athletics. Although GM David Forst recently said he has no plans to move Rooker, an overwhelming offer could always make him change his mind."
MLB News,Here's how Bucs' trio of young aces can take it to the next level,https://www.mlb.com/news/paul-skenes-jared-jones-mitch-keller-can-improve-in-2025,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 14:50:45 GMT",,"Alex Stumpf This story was excerpted from Alex Stumpf’s Pirates Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. PITTSBURGH -- During the GM Meetings at San Antonio last week, general manager Ben Cherington was asked how do the Pirates take advantage of Paul Skenes’ prime to build a winner. The answer was multi-faceted, but it started with something that Cherington has talked about often: Continuing to develop and grow their own players. “We need to continue to get more out of the players we have, including that guy you’re talking about,” Cherington answered. “Our young pitching is the backbone of the team, and we feel like all those guys have another level that they’re capable of.” The Pirates boast one of the best young staffs in baseball, headed by a top three of Skenes, Mitch Keller and Jared Jones that could rival any other team in 2025. They also can improve on their 2024 results, as Cherington said. Here’s a key for each of those big three to take a step next season. Jared Jones: Lock in a third pitch This is probably the most obvious, and something Jones discussed down the stretch. For most of the year, Jones mostly rolled with two pitches: Four-seam fastball and slider. They’re two of the best pitches on the staff, but if one pitch wasn’t clicking on a particular night, it usually spelled trouble. That’s why his September was so intriguing. The results were up and down, but he leaned on his curveball more, doubling his usage to 15.7%. The sample size was too small to derive any big takeaways, but it was something he focused on during his rehab assignment the month prior. “I think the scouting report is fastball-slider, and if it's anything else, just spit [on it], it's probably not going to be a strike,” Jones said in September. Jones is likely always going to lean on that fastball-slider combo, but if he can have a third pitch to hang onto, it will go a long way to turning in more consistent results. Mitch Keller: Maintain fastball velocity When looking at the staff’s best pitches in last week’s newsletter, Keller’s four-seamer was the best on the staff in terms of run value. It also tapered off at the end of the season, going from averaging 95.1 mph in May and June to 93.8 mph in September. The results took a dip, too, and his .478 slugging percentage allowed off fastballs in September was the highest in any month. And for someone who pitches off of his fastball, the results over his final two months were uglier than his near All-Star first half of the season. This is now two straight seasons in which Keller did not finish particularly strong. That needs to change in 2025. “There's definitely a lot of highlights up there and definitely a lot of lowlights,” Keller said, reflecting on his season. “But overall, a lot of good things to look back on and a lot of things to keep working for. ""I don't know, it's weird. I'm happy with it and also disappointed in some areas, too, so a lot more I can do for myself and a lot more I can do for this team going into next year for sure.” Paul Skenes: Efficiency, efficiency, efficiency Candidly, this one was a bit tough. Skenes had one of the best seasons for a Pirates starter in recent memory and is already in the top tier of pitchers in the game. So how exactly does one improve on a sub-2 ERA? Well, he has some ideas. ""I think there's some low-hanging fruit for me to be better next year,” Skenes said after his final start of the season. “So, just going to attack that, talk with the coaches and develop a plan once the offseason actually starts, too. But, got a plan and ready to put the work in."" Skenes didn’t go into detail that day, but he spoke about how he felt he became more efficient in his at-bats as the season progressed. The data backs that up. In May, he averaged 4.44 pitches per batter faced. Over the first half of the season, it was 4.2 pitches per plate appearances. Post All-Star break, it was 4.07 pitches. Shorter at-bats give Skenes a better opportunity to face an extra hitter or two, or maybe even go one extra inning. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Of course strikeouts are going to increase that pitch per at-bat rate, but the MLB average was 3.88 pitches per plate appearance last year. Can he get closer to that number?"
MLB News,Feinsand answers your questions about the latest rumors,https://www.mlb.com/news/mark-feinsand-hot-stove-reddit-ama,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 18:30:00 GMT",MLB insider dives into Hot Stove with Reddit AMA,"Mark Feinsand Hot Stove season is in full swing, which means senior national reporter Mark Feinsand is working his sources, loading up on coffee … and answering fan questions on the latest Reddit AMA session. Here are some of the best questions and answers from Tuesday's lively chat. Some questions and answers have been edited for clarity. Q: When do you see the Juan Soto sweepstakes ending? And which team do you think he goes to? Feinsand: I would be surprised if Soto doesn't sign by the end of the Winter Meetings (from Dec. 9-12). He's going to start meeting with teams soon, and once he has an idea of which ones he likes most, the offers should start coming in. Unlike some of his top free agents last year (Snell, Chapman, Bellinger), agent Scott Boras isn't going to have trouble drumming up big offers for Soto. I still think this will ultimately be a two-horse race between the Yankees and Mets, and to be honest, I have no idea which one I think is the favorite. Soto liked his time with the Yankees, but if the Mets decide they won't be out-bid for Soto, it's tough to imagine Hal Steinbrenner getting into a big-time bidding war with Steve Cohen. Q: How crazy are the Tigers willing to get after getting a taste of the postseason after a decade? Feinsand: Given Detroit's success this year, I would expect them to be pretty aggressive this offseason. That's not to say they're signing Soto, but I wouldn't be shocked if they're in on a number of the top free agents, including Alex Bregman, Pete Alonso and some of the starting pitchers. But to me, getting Tarik Skubal signed to an extension should be among their top priorities. Q: Are there any small market teams that you believe have a viable chance to sign Roki Sasaki? Feinsand: Absolutely. The best part of Sasaki's free agency is that it won't be primarily a financial situation. Yes, teams like the Dodgers, Padres, Yankees and Mets may be seen as the favorites, but don't sleep on a team like the Rays -- who have a history of getting the most out of their players -- making an impressive pitch to Sasaki. More on Sasaki: Q: What does the market look like for Alonso, and what are his chances of returning to the Mets? Feinsand: Alonso's market should be solid, as he's one of the top power bats on the market. His chances to return to the Mets probably hinge on what happens with Soto; if the Mets give Soto the $500-600 million deal that is being projected, that may spell the end of Alonso's time in Queens. If he leaves the Mets, I could see the Yankees, Giants, Mariners, Astros and Blue Jays all being potential landing spots. I actually wrote about Alonso's free agency today, so check it out. Q: Follow-up question here -- can you elaborate on the projected Soto deal? I hadn’t seen anything guessing what he’ll end up getting, so very curious what industry sentiment is right now! Feinsand: All along, the floor has seemed to be 10 years/$500 million. But at the GM Meetings, I kept hearing that the deal will likely be in the 13- to 14-year, $625 million range. Without any deferrals, that will be the biggest contract in baseball history, as Shohei Ohtani's $700 million deal has $680 million in deferrals, making it worth roughly $460 million in present-day value. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Q: What teams do you see as suitors for Ryan Helsley? I’m excited to see what the return looks like for a top 5 reliever two of the last three seasons. Feinsand: Pretty much every team can use a back-end bullpen arm, so the Cardinals should generate plenty of interest if they make Helsley available, as expected. But with only one year left until free agency, I'm not sure that teams are going to pay a huge price for what amounts to a rental reliever. The same goes for Milwaukee's Devin Williams, who is also one year away from free agency and could be traded this winter. Q: Who do you think is the best player to be traded this offseason that isn’t really being talked about? Most of us are pretty confident guys like Garrett Crochet or Devin Williams will be on the move, but is there anybody big we haven’t been hearing about? Feinsand: We've started to hear some whispers about Nolan Arenado being traded, and given the state of the Cardinals, that could gain some steam as the winter progresses. Ditto for Vladimir Guerrero Jr., who at the moment does not appear to be available, but if the Blue Jays try to extend him and become convinced they won't be able to keep him, they could have a change of heart. Q: Some of the last remaining Astros stalwarts who have been with the team for all or nearly all of this dynasty, Bregman and Justin Verlander, are headed for free agency. Do you think that they remain with the team, or (as more and more Astros fans are starting to predict) do they move on and find a new home? Feinsand: I'd say it's 50/50 that Bregman remains with the Astros, who will have another big free-agent decision next year when Kyle Tucker hits the open market. It's difficult for me to see Houston signing both of them to long-term deals, so if the Astros bring back Bregman, it could be a sign that they don't think they will be able to do the same with Tucker. Verlander could also come back, though I won't be shocked if A.J. Hinch tries to bring him to Detroit; Hinch was Verlander's manager in Houston, and Verlander started his career with the Tigers, so going back to Detroit would be a nice full-circle way for the future Hall of Famer to finish his career. Q: Is Soto going to be the first big signing or will the teams who drop out early look to pivot quickly and try to take advantage of other teams being tied up with Soto? Feinsand: I think we'll see a few free agents sign before Soto -- Teoscar Hernández is a name that came up as one of those possibilities during the GM Meetings -- but most of the top free agents will wait. Whichever teams don't wind up with Soto will find themselves with some money to spend, so it makes sense for those players -- especially the ones also repped by Boras -- to see how the Soto situation plays out before making any decisions. Some of the small- and mid-market teams that aren't in on Soto may try to jump the market, but they're probably looking at free agents that won't be heavily impacted by Soto's decision. Q: Why aren’t the Orioles expected to re-sign Corbin Burnes, especially with a new billionaire owner? Feinsand: Simply put, Burnes is the top free-agent pitcher out there, and there is going to be a lot of competition for him. I don't think it's impossible for the Orioles to retain him, but he's a California native, so if a West Coast team -- Dodgers, Giants, Padres -- makes a big push for him, it's entirely possible he will head back home with a huge new contract. The Orioles are expected to spend money this winter, but if they don't bring back Burnes, there are plenty of other top starting pitching options on the market to choose from. Q: There’s a lot of talk about the Red Sox being spenders again. Have you heard similarly, and do you think they can realistically get a Soto/Max Fried? Feinsand: I have heard that Boston plans to spend, and while they plan to meet with Soto, I'm not sure I give them much of a chance of signing him. If the Red Sox were prepared to give a player that type of money, wouldn't Mookie Betts still be in Boston? That said, I think Burnes, Fried, Anthony Santander and some of the other top guys out there could be interesting options for the Red Sox. They have a nice group of prospects making their way toward the Majors, but I'd expect them to be a player in free agency this year. Q: Everyone talks about the expected big spenders, so … Any teams this offseason that you think people may be surprised by how aggressive they are in FA? Thinking sort of like how the Royals were last year, and it seemed to pay dividends. Feinsand: I loved what the Royals did last year, and it could be a blueprint for other mid-market teams to copy. No, the Royals didn't sign Ohtani or Yoshinobu Yamamoto, but were there two more impactful moves than the Seth Lugo and Michael Wacha signings? I picked KC to get to the postseason and was mocked for it. I could see teams like the Reds, Pirates or Nationals taking that approach this winter. It might allow them to push for the playoffs in 2025 without making enormous long-term commitments financially."
MLB News,The metrics behind Stephenson's evolution at catcher,https://www.mlb.com/news/tyler-stephenson-2024-catching-stats-metrics,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 17:39:55 GMT",,"Mark Sheldon This story was excerpted from Mark Sheldon’s Reds Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. CINCINNATI – During the 2024 season's final homestand, after the Reds were well out of contention, catcher Tyler Stephenson was on the field early and firing throws to second base from behind the plate. Another day that late September, Stephenson was making throws while surrounded by 3D cameras. ""Our sports science people were doing a throwing assessment thing to see where I’m at right now and what strides and adjustments we can make in the offseason,"" Stephenson said on Sept. 22. ""Hopefully I can clean up some throwing stuff. I want to get back to before, where I felt like I was a really good thrower."" Later in that day's game vs. the Pirates, Stephenson made a perfect throw to second base that cut down Bryan De La Cruz trying to steal. After a 2022 season marred by injuries and limited to 50 games and a 2023 in which he split catching duties with time at first base and designated hitter, Stephenson was almost exclusively behind the plate in 2024. Stephenson, 28, led all National League catchers with 127 games behind the plate (112 starts). His 1,001 innings caught were the most by a Reds catcher since Joe Oliver in 1993. On the offensive side, he batted .258 with a .782 OPS, 19 home runs, 66 RBIs and 2.4 bWAR in 138 games. ""To get through the year of the at-bats and reps behind the plate, it’s huge. That’s everything to be out there. The in-game reps are the most important,"" Stephenson said. Stephenson has long been viewed as an offense-first catcher, but he has been trying to change that narrative. ""I’ve taken a lot of pride in it,"" Stephenson said. ""I got to Arizona early [last winter] to try and spend as much time with the guys as possible. I’ve been fortunate to catch a lot. The more reps, the better. The more at-bats, the more pitches you see. I think it’s just growth within the game that it’s really slowed down. We do our reports and have our cards and everything, but your eyes will tell you the best. I try to read everything and make adjustments on the fly. It’s a game of chess out there."" When it came to Statcast's fielding run value, which includes defensive metrics like blocking, throwing and framing, Stephenson was below average at -3. The Giants' Patrick Bailey led MLB at +22. But that -3 for Stephenson was a big jump from the -11 he had in 2023. Stephenson was also below average at blocking and caught-stealing throws. Ditto for catcher framing runs, but there was a nice jump from 2023 to 2024. Although Stephenson got worse at framing high strikes, he showed positive progress at the low strikes, especially low-middle (Zone 18). He was second-worst in MLB in that area in '23, but he improved in '24. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Stephenson also switched crouching styles in 2024. He received pitches in the traditional ""both knees up"" manner only two percent of the time, compared to 45 percent in 2023. He had his left knee up and right knee down 92 percent of the time last season. ""I made some sacrifices this year,"" he said. ""I know it’s being on the knee full time. There were strides in receiving. I want to get back to being a good thrower, which I know I can be."" The one area where Stephenson really seemed to improve lacks a true metric: Game calling. Pitchers appeared to be much more comfortable working with him in 2024 than in years prior. He caught 15 of Hunter Greene's 26 starts during the right-hander's first All-Star season. Greene had worked mostly with veteran backups Luke Maile and Curt Casali in 2023. Stephenson also caught the vast majority of games for Nick Martinez during his career year that earned him the Reds' Pitcher of the Year award from the local BBWAA chapter. Stephenson caught five of the team's eight shutout wins. ""You have a homegrown catcher who I think they should extend,"" said Martinez, who opted out of his contract and became a free agent after the season. ""He’s shown he can take charge of a full staff and still produce at a high level. That’s very rare."" President of baseball operations Nick Krall said last week that the club hasn't yet looked at potential deals for arbitration-eligible players like Stephenson. ""It all goes back to understanding at-bats and what our pitchers are trying to do,"" Stephenson said of successful game calling. ""Put together a plan and game adjustments we need to minimize their hits and runs to give ourselves a chance to win."""
MLB News,Baseball's best hitters honored with Silver Slugger Awards,https://www.mlb.com/news/silver-slugger-award-winners-2024,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 00:11:00 GMT",,"Manny Randhawa Brian Murphy MLB’s best hitters were feted Tuesday night as the 2024 Silver Slugger Award winners were announced on MLB Network. The hitting hardware, which is voted on by Major League managers and coaches, is given to the top offensive player at each position in each league. That includes three outfielders (regardless of specific position) and one utility player in each league. Fourteen teams have at least one Silver Slugger winner this season. Seven players are first-time winners. On the other end of the spectrum, two players took home their seventh Silver Slugger, something only 16 players have achieved since the award was established in 1980. Here is a full rundown of this year’s Silver Slugger recipients. FIRST BASE AL winner: Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Blue Jays (second win)A Silver Slugger for Guerrero seemed unlikely when he was batting .231 with a .675 OPS in early May. But from May 5 on, he was one of the best hitters in the sport, slashing .348/.414/.597 with 66 extra-base hits over his next 125 games. His 199 hits overall were the sixth-most in Blue Jays history, and his .323 batting average ranked second in the Majors. Vlad Jr. now has as many Silver Sluggers as his dad did through his age-25 season. Vlad Sr. collected eight by the end of his Hall of Fame career. NL winner: Bryce Harper, Phillies (fourth win)The 2024 campaign was Harper’s healthiest since he won his second NL MVP Award in 2021. This past season, the superstar slugger belted 30 home runs with an .898 OPS in 145 games for Philadelphia, and he became the first player to win multiple Silver Slugger Awards in the outfield and then at least one at first base. SECOND BASE AL winner: Jose Altuve, Astros (seventh win)Altuve’s seven Silver Sluggers are two more than any player in Astros history and are tied with Hall of Famer Ryne Sandberg for the most for a second baseman. The face of Houston’s franchise earned his latest trophy after notching his sixth season with 20 homers and his third with at least 20 dingers and 20 steals. His 185 hits also paced all players at the keystone position. NL winner: Ketel Marte, D-backs (first win)He’s been one of the more underrated sluggers over the past few years, but Marte finally has his first Silver Slugger Award after putting together a tremendous season at the plate for Arizona. He hit .292/.372/.560, setting career highs in homers (36), RBIs (95) and OPS+ (155) in 136 games. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. SHORTSTOP AL winner: Bobby Witt Jr., Royals (first win)Witt’s 2024 season was full of historic firsts en route to his first Silver Slugger. With his MLB-best .332 average, he claimed the first batting title by a Royal since George Brett in 1990. Witt had 32 home runs and 31 stolen bases to become the first shortstop in MLB history with multiple 30-30 campaigns. And if that’s not enough, he also became the first player to go 30-30 while adding at least 40 doubles and 10 triples in a single season. NL winner: Francisco Lindor, Mets (fourth win)Lindor struggled at the plate early in the season, but once he got going, he never looked back. On May 20, he had a .193/.268/.348 slash line, but from there through the end of the season he posted a .943 OPS with 26 home runs to vault himself into the NL MVP conversation and help fuel the Mets to an NL Championship Series run. His other Silver Slugger Awards came in 2017, ’18 and ’23. THIRD BASE AL winner: José Ramírez, Guardians (fifth win)The Guardians’ 162nd regular-season game was canceled due to rain, washing out Ramírez’s last chance to join the rare 40-40-40 club (only Alfonso Soriano has done it): Still, accumulating 39 doubles, 39 home runs and 41 steals isn’t too shabby. Ramírez ranked second in the AL in RBIs (118) and tied for fourth in total bases (333). With his fifth Silver Slugger, Ramírez breaks a tie with Albert Belle for the most by a player in Cleveland franchise history. Only two third basemen have won more such awards during their career: Hall of Famers Wade Boggs (eight) and Mike Schmidt (six). NL winner: Manny Machado, Padres (second win)Although he got off to a slow start at the plate, Machado had a strong second half to help get the Padres back to the postseason. After the All-Star break, he slugged .543 with 16 homers to finish with 29 for the season, along with a .797 OPS. His first Silver Slugger Award came in 2020. OUTFIELD AL winners: Aaron Judge, Yankees (fourth win)Two years after launching an AL-record 62 home runs, Judge was even better this year even though he hit “only” 58 dingers. With career-highs in on-base percentage (.458) and slugging percentage (.701), Judge produced the best OPS from a qualified AL hitter since Mark McGwire in 1996. And this occurred despite Judge’s slow start to the season. If you omit his first 27 games, you are left with some incredible stats: 54 home runs and 131 RBIs in 131 games with a .354/.488/.777 slash line. Juan Soto, Yankees (fifth win)If not for Judge, Soto would be the likely favorite for AL MVP. His year in New York turned out to be the most productive of his decorated career. Soto set personal bests over a full season -- and ranked among the top five in the AL -- with 128 runs, 41 dingers and 76 extra-base hits. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Soto joins Mike Trout (2016) as the only two players to collect their fifth Silver Slugger for a regular season that ended before they turned 26 years old. It’s yet another example of why Soto is this offseason’s top free agent. Anthony Santander, Orioles (first win)Santander captured his first Silver Slugger Award after authoring one of the best power seasons by a switch-hitter in MLB history. His 44 homers trailed only Mickey Mantle, Chipper Jones and Lance Berkman for the most by a switch-hitter. Santander, a first-time All-Star in 2024, also recorded career-highs with 91 runs scored and 102 RBIs. NL winners: Jackson Merrill, Padres (first win)Merrill made the club out of Spring Training and after going 2 for his first 14, he hit .366 over his next 21 games. In mid-June, his power really began to emerge -- from June 12 through Sept. 16, he launched 21 home runs in 79 games. He came through in clutch moments, becoming the youngest player (21 years old) to hit five game-tying or go-ahead home runs in the ninth inning or later in the same season. He was named an All-Star and cemented himself as an NL Rookie of the Year candidate. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, he also became the fourth-youngest player to win a Silver Slugger Award, at 21 years and 164 days old at the end of the regular season. Only Fernando Valenzuela, Mike Trout and Alex Rodriguez were younger. Teoscar Hernández, Dodgers (third win)Hernández, after spending most of his career with the Blue Jays, signed a one-year deal with the Dodgers and was crucial to their championship run. The 32-year-old set a career high by slugging 33 home runs and posted an .840 OPS, earning his second All-Star selection in the process -- and even winning the Home Run Derby. Prior to this year, he also won a Silver Slugger Award in 2020 and ’21 with Toronto. Jurickson Profar, Padres (first win)Profar was one of the biggest individual surprise stories of 2024. In his 11th Major League season, he had an .839 OPS with 24 home runs and was named an All-Star for the first time. His contributions were key to getting San Diego back to the postseason after missing it in 2023, especially when stars like Fernando Tatis Jr. missed time with injury. CATCHER AL winner: Salvador Perez, Royals (fifth win)The Royals’ captain is aging like fine wine. The 34-year-old Perez crushed 27 home runs and led AL catchers in RBIs (104) and OPS (.786). The 13-year veteran now owns two more Silver Sluggers than any other player in Royals history and trails only four backstops for the most at his position: Mike Piazza (10), Iván Rodríguez (seven), Brian McCann (six) and Lance Parrish (six). NL winner: William Contreras, Brewers (second win)Contreras played a huge role in helping the Brewers run away with the NL Central. He set career highs with 23 home runs and 92 RBIs and finished with an .831 OPS for Milwaukee. DESIGNATED HITTER AL winner: Brent Rooker, Athletics (first win)If 2023 was Rooker’s breakout season, 2024 confirmed to everyone that the 30-year-old slugger is the real deal. He built upon his 30-homer season from last year with 39 clouts. And Rooker did more than just slug; he ranked seventh in the AL with a .293 batting average -- a 47-point improvement from 2023 -- and had a solid .365 on-base percentage. His .927 OPS was eighth-best in MLB. NL winner: Shohei Ohtani, Dodgers (third win)While he couldn’t pitch in 2024 as he recovered from elbow surgery, all of Ohtani’s focus was at the plate, and it showed. He became the first player in MLB history to hit at least 50 home runs (54) and steal at least 50 bases (59) in the same season, putting him in position to win his third career MVP Award. He previously won the honor in 2021 and ’23 with the Angels. UTILITY AL winner: Josh Smith, Rangers (first win)Smith was a bench player for the Rangers on Opening Day, but once third baseman Josh Jung went down with a fractured wrist in the fourth game of the season, Smith filled in admirably at the hot corner. He produced a .285/.381/.454 slash line with 32 extra-base hits in 97 games before Jung returned to action on July 30. Smith shifted over to shortstop for most of the remaining games and also snuck in five appearances in the outfield. He ended his age-26 campaign with 30 doubles, 13 home runs and 11 stolen bases. NL winner: Mookie Betts, Dodgers (seventh win)Along with Altuve, Betts has the most Silver Slugger Awards among active players after winning his seventh for another outstanding offensive campaign. He began the season at shortstop after having played right field for most of his big league career. On June 18, his left hand was fractured as a result of being hit by a pitch, causing him to miss about two months. When he returned to the lineup, he moved back to right field. Despite the injury, he finished with an .863 OPS (145 OPS+) with 19 homers in 116 games. Betts’ four Silver Slugger Awards with the Dodgers are the second-most in franchise history, behind only Mike Piazza’s five. OFFENSIVE TEAMS OF THE YEAR This year marked the second time Silver Slugger Awards have been given to the best offensive team in each league. The winners -- the Yankees in the American League and the Dodgers in the National League -- were determined by a combination of team offensive statistics. The Yankees and Dodgers led their respective leagues in home runs, OPS and wRC+, among other stats. The Dodgers’ three Silver Slugger Award winners this year are the most in a season in franchise history."
MLB News,World Baseball Classic Qualifiers announced,https://www.mlb.com/news/2025-world-baseball-classic-qualifiers-announced,"Tue, 12 Nov 2024 23:01:00 GMT",,"Michael Clair Sixteen teams are in for the 2026 World Baseball Classic, and four spots remain for the main tournament. On Tuesday, the eight participating teams that will meet early next year in one of two Qualifiers were announced. Four teams will play at the first Qualifier at the Taipei Dome in Taiwan from Feb. 21-25. Next, four more teams will head to Tucson, Ariz., from March 2-6. At each Qualifier, the top two ballclubs will advance to the World Baseball Classic in 2026. Let’s break down the two pools below. Tickets for the Tucson pool are available here. There will be more ticketing information updates as it becomes available. Taipei Qualification Pool Feb. 21-25, 2025 Chinese Taipei 2023 performance: Finished 2-2 in a five-way tie in Group A. Tiebreaker rules meant team finished last Current WBSC rank: 2nd, Tied with Mexico With all five teams in Group A finishing 2-2, Chinese Taipei found themselves at the bottom of the group thanks to a worst-in-Group-A 31 runs allowed. The good news for this year: It’ll be hosting at the brand-new Taipei Dome -- perhaps making the remarkable fan atmosphere even louder and more intense. Currently tied for the No. 2 ranking by the WBSC, the team should be the favorites to emerge as one of the top two teams from this pool. Nicaragua 2023 performance: 0-4 in Group D Current WBSC rank: 16 Nicaragua went winless in its first World Baseball Classic tournament, qualifying after defeating Brazil, 3-1, at the Estadio Nacional de Panamá in 2022. The team will need to find some more offense this time around: It scored just one run in all four of its World Classic Classic games. Duque Hebbert, who was signed by the Tigers after he struck out Juan Soto, Julio Rodríguez, and Rafael Devers in his appearance against the Dominican Republic, made it to Single-A Lakeland this past season. South Africa 2023 performance: 0-2 in 2022 World Baseball Classic Qualifiers, did not qualify for tournament Current WBSC rank: 30 South Africa held its own in the Qualifiers, dropping a tight 5-4 loss to Spain and were tied, 2-2, with Germany before giving up seven runs in the sixth inning to let the Germans run away with the game. It’ll look to get back into the World Baseball Classic main tournament for the first time since 2009. Spain 2023 performance: Went 2-2 in 2022 World Baseball Classic Qualifiers, did not qualify for tournament Current WBSC rank: 23 Spain will be looking for revenge. One of the favored teams at the Qualifiers in Regensburg, Germany, they had two opportunities to pick up one win to advance to the 2023 tournament. But upset losses to Great Britain and Czechia meant that Spain was on the outside looking in. With a lineup featuring former Major League talent like Engel Beltre and Rhiner Cruz, the Spanish won their first European Baseball Championship since 1955 last fall and will try to return to the WBC for the first time since 2013. Tucson Qualification Pool March 2-6, 2025 (Tickets available here) Colombia 2023 performance: 1-3 in Group C Current WBSC rank: 11 Colombia started its WBC on fire, upsetting semifinalist Mexico, 5-4, in 10 innings. Veteran slugger Reynaldo Rodriguez led the way with three hits and three RBIs in the victory. Unfortunately, Colombia lost its next three games, including a nailbiting 3-2 loss to the United States to end group play and finish last.

Brazil 2023 performance: 2-2 in WBC Qualifier, did not qualify for tournament Current WBSC rank: 24 Long considered a potential sleeping giant in international baseball, Brazil -- like Spain -- had two chances to qualify for the 2023 WBC after starting its qualification tourney 2-0. Brazil were then shut out, 4-0, by Panama, and lost a rematch with Nicaragua -- whom it had beaten earlier that week -- 3-1. Brazil will look to qualify for the main tournament for the first time since 2013. China 2023 performance: 0-4 in Group B Current WBSC rank: 20 China nearly had the win it needed to avoid the Qualifier, leading Czechia going into the top of the ninth. But after Martin Mužík’s home run, China dropped the game, 8-5, and would go on to finish last in Group B. With team legend Ray Chang playing and coaching, the team kept the games competitive until it ran out of steam in a 22-2 loss to Korea to end the tournament. Should China fail to qualify, 2026 will be the first WBC it doesn’t participate in. Germany 2023 performance: 1-2 at 2022 WBC Qualifiers, did not qualify for tournament Current WBSC rank: 17 Hopes were high for Germany in 2022 as the nation played host for the Qualifiers after bringing in an experienced lineup featuring former Major Leaguers Aaron Altherr and Bruce Maxwell. The disappointing finish saw a change in management, with Jendrick Speer taking over the team and captain Simon Guhring retiring from international play. That seemed to make immediate dividends: The team nearly took home bronze in the 2023 European Baseball Championships before a late comeback from the Netherlands saw them finish fourth. Young Brewers catching prospect Yannic Walther impressed in the tourney, posting an .862 OPS, while homering and driving in six."
MLB News,How will Twins execs divvy up new duties?,https://www.mlb.com/news/twins-front-office-in-rare-period-of-transition,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 19:25:00 GMT",,"Do-Hyoung Park This story was excerpted from Do-Hyoung Park’s Twins Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. The Twins have announced a major transition in their leadership. Now what? The organization has largely operated as a bastion of continuity. But this offseason looks to be setting up a new chapter in the team’s history, from a potential ownership change to Derek Falvey stepping into the team president role to Jeremy Zoll being elevated to general manager -- all while longtime franchise steward Dave St. Peter steps aside into an advisory role. Just don’t expect all that to happen overnight. St. Peter and Falvey have indicated that they hope to achieve most of the transition of duties as team president within the first quarter of 2025, but the benefit to St. Peter remaining as a strategic advisor in the organization is that he’ll have the ability to guide Falvey through the process in a controlled manner to ease the burden of the change on all fronts. “I know that's wide, but I think it's realistic,” St. Peter said. “We're trying to get it right. We're not trying to get it done. We have some time. We have some work to do. … We're going to bring some additional people now into the conversation, which is going to be really healthy.” Derek Falvey will be elevated to President, Baseball and Business Operations as Dave St. Peter will transition to a Strategic Advisor.Additionally, Jeremy Zoll has been promoted to Senior Vice President, General Manager. pic.twitter.com/rAW3p5liZN Falvey already had been involved in conversations around the organization’s long-range business planning with St. Peter and executive chairs Jim and Joe Pohlad, especially as it pertained to investments around Target Field and the Twins’ various satellite complexes. St. Peter noted that, even as Falvey was hired in 2017 to lead baseball operations, there was already some sense that Falvey could perhaps one day advance to the team president role. Now that the Twins have announced the changes to the organization, the plan is for Falvey to start more directly building relationships with St. Peter’s direct reports on the business side, so that Falvey can start mapping out a plan of how he hopes to divide responsibilities around business-side decision-making. The plan won’t be for Falvey to inherit St. Peter’s full suite of responsibilities -- but this transition time will be critical in Falvey’s understanding of how to eventually structure and delegate all those processes according to the strengths of his deputies. “No one can be Dave's role exactly,” Falvey said. “No one can be Dave St. Peter. I'm not even going to try. But I will take on a different role with different leaders underneath, with different structure, that ultimately will, hopefully, lead this team into the next phase.” Thanks Twins Territory. pic.twitter.com/Zr9kqjw9E8 In the meantime, Falvey will continue to lead baseball operations -- though he noted that the time split between his baseball and business duties will likely vary wildly throughout the year. Contrary to popular opinion, it isn’t necessarily the president of baseball operations (Falvey) or the general manager (now Zoll) who wields some sort of unilateral decision-making gavel in a front office -- especially not with the collaborative approach the Twins use in their process. Falvey has noted that, at any given time, more than a half-dozen leaders in his baseball operations department might be given some level of autonomy to make decisions. Zoll was one of the most heavily involved among them, especially as it pertained to his home in player development -- and he emphasized the continuation of the group’s delegation of responsibilities, even with the change in his own title. Falvey’s move away from some of the day-to-day baseball operations will create opportunities for Zoll to begin taking more of a leadership role in some spaces -- like scouting operations -- in which he perhaps had less focus in the past. “I think in the immediate, day-to-day will feel similar, but my day-to-day is always kind of bringing a new problem or new challenge or different thing that will pop up,” Zoll said. “That’s honestly one of the things I find most exciting and rewarding about the roles I’ve held over the years.”"
MLB News,Langford's rookie season worthy of recognition,https://www.mlb.com/news/wyatt-langford-rookie-season-recognition,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 16:52:30 GMT",,"Kennedi Landry This story was excerpted from Kennedi Landry's Rangers Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. ARLINGTON -- At the end of May, Wyatt Langford was slashing .222/.288/.286 with just one home run. He had just spent three weeks on the injured list with a right hamstring strain and -- nationally, at least -- appeared to have fallen out of the American League Rookie of the Year race. But then he figured it out. From June 1 through the end of the season -- a span of 100 games -- Langford slashed .263/.337/.458 with 15 home runs. He struck out less, walked more and seemingly put everything together, doing everything the Rangers expected of the player they selected at No. 4 overall in the 2023 MLB Draft. Surely enough for an AL Rookie of the Year comeback, right? Not so much. Langford was not named a finalist for the award when MLB announced them on Monday night. Instead, the finalists are Orioles outfielder Colton Cowser, Yankees right-hander Luis Gil and Yankees catcher Austin Wells. Votes from BBWAA members are submitted before the postseason begins. • Finalists for MVP, Cy Young, Rookie & Manager of the Year revealed Cowser appears to be the frontrunner for the award after slashing .242/.321/.447 (120 wRC+) in 153 games. He accumulated 3.1 bWAR and 4.0 fWAR over that time. Wells slashed .229/.322/.395 (105 wRC+) in 115 games, with 2.5 bWAR and 3.4 fWAR, though he has been praised for his defense behind the plate on top of his offensive production. If Cowser is the perceived favorite, Langford has a case to be a finalist alongside him, regardless of the other contenders. The 22-year-old finished the year with a similar slash line at .253/.325/.415 with a 110 wRC+ in 134 games. He collected 3.9 bWAR and 2.9 fWAR. Additionally, Langford became just the second player, and the only rookie, in MLB history to produce a walk-off grand slam (Sept. 3 vs. the Yankees), a cycle (June 30 at Baltimore) and an inside-the-park home run (April 28 vs. the Reds) in the same season, joining Brooklyn’s Jackie Robinson in 1948. Alas, Langford will not win Rookie of the Year, despite dramatic improvement across the course of the season. But Rookie of the Year or not, Langford and the Rangers are more than pleased with his progress in his first big league season. “It's so difficult to hit Major League pitching now more than ever,” manager Bruce Bochy said. “And what he did this year amazes me in the progress that he made. He's always going to have that ability to use the whole field well. He drives the ball on both sides, and his work ethic is what will continue to make him better. This guy wants to be really good. He wants to be great. He wants to win.” Looking back at Langford’s full season, president of baseball operations Chris Young said his month of September is probably what stood out the most. Rookies often struggle to adjust to the mental and physical grind of a full 162-game season. And even though Langford had that brief stint on the injured list, he still found a way to be at his best at the very end. In September, he was named the AL Player and Rookie of the Month after slashing .300/.386/.610 with eight home runs to cap off his first year in the Majors. “What's impressed me the most with Wyatt is just his aptitude, his hunger, his work, and his unwavering belief and commitments to being great,” Young said. “We saw that over the course of the season. Wyatt didn't have a full Minor League season to prepare him for a full Major League season. This is a guy who basically went through half of a Minor League [season] and he comes into his first full Spring Training, and he's at his best at the very end of the year. “I think that speaks to the person and the ability that he has. He just continued to improve and adjust and learn and grow. The best is yet to come. I'm so excited about his future. He's a special one.”"
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Key to Eagles' success is clear; it won't be easy vs. Commanders,https://sports.yahoo.com/why-key-trend-to-eagles-wins-under-nick-sirianni-may-not-help-them-in-high-stakes-game-vs-commanders-045113131.html,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 04:51:13 GMT","Philadelphia is a staggering 23-1 under Nick Sirianni when it does this one thing, but can Philly do it tonight vs. Washington in a showdown for the NFC East lead?","The reinforcement is constant. The Philadelphia Eagles run a weekly team meeting on how to force turnovers and they review ball-security film after each practice. The day before games, coaches show clips of 10 to 15 recent league turnovers to learn from, head coach Nick Sirianni said. Sometimes college or high school film enters the conversation. Because while the Eagles’ current five-game winning streak has included multiple ingredients, they’re not downplaying how winning the turnover battle has contributed. Philadelphia lost the turnover battle the first four games of the season, and went 2-2. They’ve since bested it in five games — and won them all. The strong correlation dates back way earlier than this streak “For every team it's a huge stat, but more so for us because we're above the league average as far as 23-1 when we win that turnover battle,” Sirianni said. “For us, it’s a huge stat.” TruMedia data confirmed the Eagles are 23-1, with 23 straight wins, under Sirianni when posting a better turnover ratio than their opponent. It’s not surprising that taking care of the football has bred winning — but their .958 winning percentage far bests the league-average .769 clip. Only the defending conference champions have fared better, the San Francisco 49ers 28-1 and Kansas City Chiefs 17-0 when turning the ball over less than their opponents since 2021. Without that edge? The Eagles are 18-18 (.500) when producing the same or more giveaways than opponents. So the emphasis will continue. “We want it to always be on their minds,” Sirianni said Monday. “We’re constantly thinking of new ways to teach it. We constantly try to think of new ways to implement it. … For us, it’s a huge stat.” The problem: As the 7-2 Eagles host the 6-3 Washington Commanders on Thursday with first place in the NFC East at stake, Philadelphia will have a tough time besting the Commanders. Only once this season has Washington lost the turnover battle. The Eagles understand why. Jayden Daniels’ rookie year is not only remarkable for the spectacular plays he’s extended and deep balls he’s thrown. The 2024 second overall draft pick has done much more than combine skill and luck for an exciting Hail Mary, and he’s done much more than just extend plays by scrambling, though he has done that well. Daniels has done more for the surging Commanders by, in one category, doing less. Like Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud the year before him, Daniels has made his success possible by not forfeiting opportunities. He has thrown just two interceptions on 262 pass attempts, Daniels’ 0.8% intercepted passes ranking fifth in the league among qualified passers and third among current team starters. The two starters with better clips: the Los Angeles Chargers’ Justin Herbert at 0.4% and the Baltimore Ravens’ Lamar Jackson at 0.7%. Daniels' lone two credited fumbles have gone out of bounds, neither landing in the hands of his opponent. In all, the Commanders’ four total giveaways tie the Chargers for best in the league. And while a less-opportunistic defense leaves the Commanders’ plus-6 mark tied for seventh-best, they’re nonetheless better in the category than the 14th-ranked Eagles. “He’s only thrown two interceptions, which is unreal, really,” Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio said. “Kudos to him for what he’s been able to achieve. Kudos to the coaches there that are coaching him, because that’s not an easy offense to run.” Daniels’ efficiency has not simply been the result of conservative play calls and low-risk plays. While offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury eased Daniels in for a couple weeks, they have since progressed to taking deep shots. Only three quarterbacks have averaged more than Daniels’ 8.54 air yards per attempt, and five more than his 8.2 yards per attempt. Daniels’ study habits and mental bank of coverages from five college years appear to be paying off. “He knows what he can get away with and what he can't,” Kingsbury said. “And then he also knows protections and he knows when he should be picked up and when he is hot. And so, he can kind of set guys up knowing, ‘OK, that's the free rusher. I can set him up and get out this way or that way.’ “It’s a combination of his knowledge of the system and then just sheer athletic ability.” The Eagles can win, and have won, without winning the turnover battle. They’ll have the advantage of playing at home with a team whose core has been together far longer than that of the Commanders, who front a first-year quarterback, first-year general manager and first-year (to this organization) head coach. The Eagles’ explosive offense should be able to find opportunities against a Commanders defense ranked 20th in passing efficiency and 12th in rushing efficiency, per Next Gen Stats. As long as Philadelphia can ward off the pressure Washington’s defense has been sending, Hurts will have a chance to capitalize on a stable of weapons including Saquon Barkley, A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith. But Philadelphia should know: Even as its defense has reduced its missed tackles and created more turnovers, the Washington offense is far more sound than Philadelphia’s defense in most key categories. The Eagles' surest route to changing the calculus is a turnover. It will be more difficult than any of the five Philadelphia snagged Sunday against a reeling Dallas Cowboys team missing quarterback Dak Prescott. Philadelphia, no doubt, will believe it has a chance. And to help that chance: Cue the meetings with film of the Eagles’ own turnover creation and of the best turnover methodology across the league. Cue the takeaway drills in practice and the coaches eager to give feedback. “You put them in drills, you put them in practice, we harp on it,” Sirianni said. “Any time there's an opportunity missed at practice, that's going to be in the team meeting the next day as far as, ‘Hey, we’ve got this vice tackle right here. You're not taking a shot at the ball or you are taking a shot at the ball.’ So it's on our mind. “I think what happens, too, is I'm glad the players are talking about that in the sense of, ‘Hey, we watch this all the time.’ It's etched in their mind, and that's what you want.” Eagles players have texted each other recently when seeing turnovers in other games. They’ve assessed the player’s ball carriage. And most importantly, to Sirianni, they’ve brought it to the top of their minds. “That's what you want,” he said. “That's when you know you’ve got your culture going the way you want it to go — when all those things like that are constantly on their mind. Sounds like that's the case.”"

That is why the star 49ers quarterback wasn’t the happiest after San Francisco’s narrow 23-20 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Sunday at Raymond James Stadium. In the latest episode of “Cleats and Convos,” one of Purdy’s top targets, All-Pro wide receiver Deebo Samuel, detailed the quarterback's emotions after leading the 49ers to a two-game win streak. “What really sticks out to me about Brock, and he kind of does this a lot, but I don’t too much get into it, we were just on the way back from Tampa and I walk past him and he looked kind of frustrated a little bit and I’m like, 'What’s going on? You almost just threw for 400 yards and we won the game.’ And he’s like, 'I just got to be better,’” Samuel told co-host Liv Moods. Purdy completed 25 of 36 passes for 353 yards and two touchdowns in the 49ers’ win. He also helped five different targets surpass 50 yards receiving -- Jauan Jennings (93), Ricky Pearsall (73), Christian McCaffrey (68), George Kittle (57) and Samuel (62). Despite Sunday’s outcome and success, though, Purdy regretted a handful of decisions and was visibly irritated with himself. And Samuel wasn’t surprised one bit. “That’s always [Purdy’s] mentality -- that he’s got to be better -- and he was just sitting there beating himself up,” Samuel said. “I’m like ‘Bro, we just won the game,’ and he’s like 'I got to make this throw, I got to make this throw.’” The 262nd and final pick of the 2022 NFL Draft has quite the mentality. And 8,108 career passing yards and 62 total touchdowns later, Purdy remains the same grinder. San Francisco finally is in a groove after an onslaught of injuries and disappointing losses plagued the first half of its season. Purdy’s relentlessness and devotion to the game, as Samuel witnessed, largely is why. Download and follow the 49ers Talk Podcast"

Nate Tice breaks down a fascinating clash.","To say the Washington Commanders have exceeded expectations in 2024 is a wild understatement. At 7-3, they’ve already blown past their preseason betting total of 6.5 wins with seven games to spare. Retread head coach Dan Quinn, at one point seeming more like a consolation prize in the Ben Johnson sweepstakes than a preferred hire, has brought his infectious energy and attitude, and shifted the mindset of an entire organization. Offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury, who was last seen in the NFL ejecting out of Phoenix and from a listless Cardinals team and needing such a life reset he took a trip to Thailand, has turned a unit led by a rookie QB, a frustratingly underutilized wide receiver and a smattering of glue guys and role players into one of the best offenses in the NFL. The Commanders are second in offensive DVOA, success rate, and EPA per play, just like we all expected. That rookie QB, Jayden Daniels, was thrown into the deep waters of a Todd Bowles defense in Week 1, and after his initial struggles, has found a way to keep his head above water and swim no matter where the currents are going. Despite a Week 10 loss, it has all come together for the Commanders in a quicker and more cohesive way than even the most optimistic Commanders fan or organization member could have fathomed. With a juicy Thursday Night Football matchup on tap between the Commanders and Philadelphia Eagles, I wanted to look at exactly why this Commanders offense and Daniels have been not only a pleasant surprise, but an actually good unit that has given defenses fits. And I'll examine at how that might look against an Eagles defense that has been morphing into a top-end unit in their own right. While the Air Raid tag is going to follow any Kingsbury-led offense, this Commanders offense is more of a hybridization of different types of offenses with some Air Raid sauce slathered on top. It’s a fast-paced attack that operates in no huddle with regularity, with 61.3% of the Commanders' offensive snaps this year outside the last two minutes of each half coming without a huddle. This is easily the highest rate in the NFL this year and dwarfs the league average of 12.2%. In fact, 61.3% would be the third-highest rate by any NFL offense since 2002, according to TruMedia. Only the Chip Kelly-led Eagles “blur” offenses in 2013 and 2015 had a higher rate of not huddling (the 2014 Eagles appropriately ranked fourth). While some offenses will have a limited menu of what they can get to out of no huddle, the Commanders seem to be able to access a large swath of their playbook when they crank up the tempo. There’s formational variety, run-game adjustments and different parts of the passing game that they’ve been able to dial up while defenses are scrambling to get lined up. Take this opening drive against the Cardinals from Week 4. The Commanders finished this touchdown drive with four different types of run concepts from different formation families, including a snap out of Wildcat with Brian Robinson as the de facto QB. The Commanders opening drive, mostly no huddle, capped off with four runs, all (technically) different concepts, all out of different formation families. Including a snap of Counter out of Wildcat. pic.twitter.com/WS4FDmzxWL — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) October 1, 2024 Getting on the ball quickly can create a natural element of surprise and limit what a defense can access. Teams are scared to substitute their personnel because they might get caught with too many players on the field or a player out of position. This can lead to defenses playing incorrect personnel groupings for certain situations (like a blitz package used on third down now having to play a first-and-10 situation on the next play). Defensive play-calls also become shorter and more basic. It’s hard for defenses to get into wordier calls (general rule of thumb is that the more exotic the look, the more words are needed) and communicate them correctly with the defenders attempting to get lined up, all while the offense is lined up and ready to snap the ball. This leads to a natural limitation of what can get thrown at the QB and offensive line, which narrows the problems they have to potentially solve. the Commanders ability to get to so much out of no huddle continues to fascinate me. They're able to window dress a ton in their run game, and the tempo they play with punishes any defensive miscues. pic.twitter.com/KtorKr3usY — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 5, 2024 Being able to get to more while limiting what you have to face is an amazing edge for any unit to have. It’s buoyed even further by Daniels and the rest of the Commanders' offense avoiding self-inflicted wounds that could kneecap warp-speed attack. Only 3.1% of Commanders drives have resulted in a turnover this year, second-best in the NFL and well below the league average of 10.9%. The ball carriers are taking care of the ball and Daniels has done a great job of not putting the ball in harm’s way while also avoiding sacks that could cripple a drive (his sack rate of 7.1% is around the middle of the pack for qualifying QBs). That sack rate and the run game speak to the play of the Commanders' offensive line, a unit that has been one of the more pleasant surprises in the entire NFL this year. Even in Arizona, Kingsbury was willing to go to the run game, which was an efficient and for the most part an underrated aspect of his offenses. In Washington, with offensive line coach Bobby Johnson, the team has added even more layers despite dealing with recent injuries up front. The Commanders are first in the NFL in RB rushing success rate (48.4%) and EPA generated by RB carries (22.7 expected points and .11 per carry). That’s not including the rushing element that Daniels brings, although the way defenses are accounting for him opens up opportunities to exploit. and what the threat of the QB keeping it on a read play can do to help out the rest of the offense.Brian Burns got beat last time, so he keys in on Daniels even more. Which opens up space for the RB to run through since Burns isn't squeezing. https://t.co/sh5ICnzQlN pic.twitter.com/ZThV5rLa7B — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 5, 2024 There isn’t much straight dropping back in this “Air Raid” offense. Instead, the Commanders are slicing defenses up on the ground with Robinson (now back from injury) and a rejuvenated Austin Ekeler, while also sprinkling in some play-action shot plays (sometimes out of no huddle) to attack down the field. The Commanders call a run or play-action play on 65.2% of their offensive plays, the fourth-highest rate in the league. In 2022, Kingsbury’s last year in Arizona, the Cardinals called a run or play-action pass on 50.8% of their plays. The Commanders' run rate of 50.5% (fifth-highest in the NFL) is in a different zip code than the 2019-2022 Cardinals' run rate of 41.5% (including 37.9% in Kingsbury’s final season in Arizona). There have been new conceptual elements added to the run game, but there are also changes that Kingsbury has made to his attack. There are more personnel variations, including more tight end and two-RB looks. Their formations have also become more diverse and have become more condensed. Kingsbury’s Cardinals had average formational width of 28.3 yards in 2021, widest in the NFL that season, which often made those Cardinals offenses feel like every skill player was isolated on an island. While this year’s Commanders have an average formational width of 24.4 yards, which is tied for 10th in 2024, the Commanders will also use formational window dressing to open up their offense even more. They lead the NFL in things like quad formations (an atypical formation set with four skill players aligned to one side and a single player on the other side). There’s also plenty of screens, especially to WRs, in this offense. That is a staple of an Air Raid offense, with the thinking that these quick-hitters are, in theory, a way to replace the run game to make defenders honor all levels of the field. Of the Commanders' targets this season, 11.8% have been to WR screens, according to NextGenStats, highest in the NFL and third-highest by any offense since 2016 (only behind the 2022 Bears and, appropriately enough, the 2019 Cardinals in Kingsbury’s first season as a head coach). These are not white flag plays for the Commanders to give up on a series like they are in other offenses. Washington currently has a 50% success rate on WR screens, which coupled with its success on the ground, leads to a healthy dose of efficiency. I attribute a chunk of the Commanders' success on these screens, and even in the run game, to their skill position personnel. It's not that it’s filled with a bunch of YAC monsters who can turn any play into a home run, but more so that their WR room is filled with an assortment of players willing to scrap as blockers and who can hold up physically. Terry McLaurin, Noah Brown, Luke McCaffrey, Dyami Brown and Olamide Zaccheaus are all players who I would rate as plus-blockers, with most of them having at least above-average size, too. This is a stark, stark contrast to the final years of Kingsbury’s Cardinals that featured a starting WR group at one point with listed heights and weights of: 5-foot-7, 175 pounds 5-9, 188 pounds 5-10, 175 pounds the measurements of the three WRs the Cardinals trotted for their first preseason game:5'7"", 1755'9"", 1885'10"", 175 pic.twitter.com/IIoYALijet — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) August 16, 2022 Now to the rookie triggerman who's making this all go. When the Commanders do drop back to throw, it’s all plays that Daniels is comfortable with. That includes concepts featuring isolated routes on the outside (he’s fantastic with his throw placement on stop routes and hitches) that let him take advantage of any matchup he likes (which is apparently McLaurin vs. everybody). Great ball placement on the Stop route from Jayden Daniels. McLaurin is tightly covered and Daniels puts it in the perfect spot to convert on 3rd down. pic.twitter.com/Qqy7eKbDKM — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) October 13, 2024 Daniels, even as a prospect, had a propensity to attack the outside. And he’s very good at it. So far as a professional, he’s even been sprinkling in tough intermediate throws over the middle every week. Attacking that part of the field still isn’t a heavy part of Daniels’ throwing diet, but he keeps excelling on the opportunities he takes, which will help keep defenders from starting to squeeze things to the outside. 3 of Jayden Daniels' best throws against the Ravens came on the same drive:.1) Over route with pressure in his face2) Hole shot on a bubble+pump concept3) Fantastic throw over the middle to Ertz right around Roquan Smith (probably my favorite throw of his from this season) pic.twitter.com/oIo3bbFIqI — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) October 15, 2024 my favorite throw from Jayden Daniels against the Giants. Exquisite ball placement with where the defenders are located. https://t.co/sh5ICnzQlN pic.twitter.com/lD44DyFwNJ — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 5, 2024 Daniels doesn’t attack downfield a ton outside of the occasional go ball to keep defenders from squatting on the outside; only 14.6% of his throws have been to routes defined as “vertical” by NextGenStats, which ranks 25th in the NFL. But he’s been hitting enough of them, and he takes sound chances so it keeps defenses from playing too aggressively downhill (remember that run game and all those WR screens). And Kingsbury does a great job of timing up double-moves to take advantage of cornerbacks who are not honoring getting beat over the top. Daniels’ running ability has also been exceptional. He constantly eludes defenders as a runner and scrambler (he currently leads the NFL in scramble rate at 13.8%), picking up yards and first downs (Daniels is behind only the tush push-aided Jalen Hurts in rushing first downs among all QBs.) can't hit what you can't catch pic.twitter.com/1ekIgl0sDx — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 5, 2024 While I’ve already talked about how his running ability provides a boost to the rest of the Commanders' ground game, Daniels' scrambling ability has been huge on third down for Washington. The Commanders currently rank first in combined success rate and explosive play rate on third and fourth down this season. So, even when the Commanders haven’t been able to stay ahead of the sticks on early downs (they rank seventh in average distance to go on third down because of that efficient run and screen game on early downs), defenses still have to worry about Daniels peppering them underneath to set up a short fourth down, or firing a deep shot to McLaurin when they start looking to jump one of those shorter throws. Or Daniels can simply scamper by to move the chains, even in third-and-long situations. Most importantly Daniels has been (mostly) avoiding big hits, something that has to be monitored given his college style and lack of bulk. Having said that, he has been dealing with a rib injury that knocked him out of the Commanders' Week 7 game against the Carolina Panthers. Daniels’ accuracy and speed are winning traits. The calmness he plays with is palpable when you watch the Commanders. Sure, he scrambles a ton, but it isn’t frantic paths that look like they're written in cursive. Instead, it’s direct and with a purpose. Daniels is fast, but he hasn’t tempted fate by trying to do too much as a runner, or a thrower for that matter. The Commanders have had plenty of positive game scripts, but Daniels never seems like he’s totally pressing. My main question with this offense is how the Commanders expand as more film is put out there. The Steelers in Week 10 took the fight to the Commanders, as cornerback Joey Porter Jr. was constantly pressing the Commanders' WRs, their edge defenders were sprinting at Daniels to force him to give the ball up on read plays, and they just generally tried to outmuscle the Commanders. Steelers defense made sure to not let Jayden Daniels get loose on run plays and bootlegs.Edge defenders ran straight at Daniels on read plays to make him give the ball or they had a scrape defender behind.Commanders were able to pop some runs because of it, but it did help. pic.twitter.com/zcmXk0ha6V — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 11, 2024 It’s easier said than done, as the Commanders have found ways to move the ball and score even when things haven’t been ideal. And their up-tempo attack and team speed can turn one simple defensive lapse into a huge gain. There’s a reason they have stayed in the top five of efficiency metrics even as the season has gone along. I still would like to see the Commanders look to attack downfield more often, especially if teams snuff out their WR screens like the Steelers did (the Commanders rank 25th in explosive play rate on early downs, sandwiched between the Raiders' and Bears' lackluster offenses). So far, teams have struggled to consistently take away Washington's staples, especially early in games. Kingsbury has used enough designer plays and double-moves to create breathing room and added enough curveballs for defenses to deal with. But defenses start to clamp down on aspects of this offense as games go along and Kingsbury’s offenses have fallen off in the second half of seasons in the past, so I still want to see how this team evolves as defenses start hunkering down on the Commanders' base plays. The tradeoff for some of the strength of their WRs is their after-catch ability is more middle of the pack, so underneath throws have a limited ceiling in this offense. So more chunk-seeking plays, like the Daniels throw against the Giants in the embedded tweet above, that aren’t just go balls will be a nice added element for this offense. How Daniels deals with more consistent pressure will also be something I’ll be keeping an eye on. So far, he has been much smarter when dealing with pressure than he was in college, which has helped keep the Commanders constantly ahead of the chains and allowed their efficient offense to thrive. But with more offensive line injuries, I am curious if the passing game is able to expand to more stuff downfield, or if it’s more of the same as a way to mitigate those injuries. Another nitpick would be the Commanders' inconsistent red-zone passing game. While it has showed more positive signs recently, it still is something that can hopefully improve for this team to feel even more dangerous. Even if there is some drop-off on this Commanders offense, its baseline is way higher than I would have ever guessed going into the season. This is a testament to Kingsbury evolving his attack (with the influence of Johnson), the mature play of Daniels and the strong performances from the group of skill position players. This Thursday night tilt against the Eagles should be a fun game. The Eagles are second in combined success and explosive play rate, and have been one of the best defenses in the NFL since Week 3, with new and young faces being the drivers of that improvement. Players like cornerbacks Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean are potential Defensive Rookie of the Year candidates, linebacker Zack Baun has been a revelation in Vic Fangio’s defense, defensive tackle Jalen Carter looks dominant in his second year, and even players like DT Milton Williams (in a contract year, I might add) looks like he leveled up this season. Eagles have so many new faces and players with increased roles this year on defense, and they're really starting to come together. Milton Williams, Cooper DeJean, Nakobe Dean, Zack Baun, Quinyon Mitchell all have been having their moments. pic.twitter.com/P3GQhLzrPX — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 5, 2024 Jalen Carter and Milton Williams instantly disrupting the run pic.twitter.com/GnuifsZN3f — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 11, 2024 It’s a fantastic Thursday night matchup with two very good offenses going at it in a huge battle in the NFC East. While the Eagles' offense has a clear advantage on that side of the ball, the Commanders' offense will be getting a strong and entertaining (for neutral observers like me, at least) matchup against a strong Eagles defense. The Eagles were expected to be battling at the top of the NFC and their offensive firepower has been worthy of eyeballs (for good and bad) for a few years now. Daniels and the Commanders' offense, on the other hand, were not expected to be in this type of statistical stratosphere. But they have earned all the attention they’re getting right now."

""Listen, when we brought in Gardner, we expected, obviously, the play that we had seen in the past and at some point, you've got to give a guy confidence,"" Pierce said, via ESPN. ""And there's been times, obviously, with turnovers and other things that have taken place, where we made decisions to either put him on the bench or go to another quarterback. ""But this week I felt like Gardner gives us the best opportunity to move forward and he has every opportunity to go out there and help us get to a win."" The Raiders have struggled across the board this season, and they’ve not had a consistent quarterback from the jump. Minshew, Aidan O’Connell and Desmond Ridder have all cycled through the position, and none of them have had much success. Minshew opened the season as the team’s starter, but O’Connell took over in Week 5. Minshew jumped back in after O’Connell broke his thumb a few weeks later, but he was benched in the second half of their most recent loss for Ridder. The Raiders sit at 2-7 on the season coming out of their bye week. They fired offensive coordinator Luke Getsy, offensive line coach James Cregg and quarterbacks coach Rich Scangarello before the break, too. Among other moves, the team brought in Norv Turner as a senior adviser. Minshew, who signed a two-year, $25 million deal with the Raiders this past offseason, has thrown for 1,501 yards with six touchdowns and eight interceptions this season. He has 12 total turnovers and averages 1.5 per game — both of which are the second-worst among quarterbacks in the league. Only Minnesota Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold has more. Though the Raiders seem well out of contention for a playoff spot, and it would take a wild turnaround in order for them to make the postseason in a few months, Pierce is hoping their week off can at least help get things started. ""Needed to take a good cold shower, cold bath, wash all that badness off that took place over the nine games and I think our staff did the same,"" Pierce said. ""I know our players did, but they were still around the building, which is the best thing about it, right? ""People might question our locker room, might question our culture, might question me, but you can't question our commitment. We're committed to this bad boy and turning it around."""

A Jets team that had Super Bowl aspirations is 3-7 and not in the playoff picture. Rodgers is producing career lows in yards per attempt (6.4) and touchdown-to-interception ratio (15-to-7) with a completion percentage (62.4%) that's among his career worsts. This is not working out. But Rodgers sounds ready to run it back. He was asked on Wednesday if this season's results have changed his previously stated thoughts on wanting to play beyond 2024. ""Not really, not for the negative,"" Rodgers said. ""No, not really."" When asked to clarify if he wants to play again in 2025, Rodgers said this: ""I think so, yeah."" Aaron Rodgers says that this season has not changed his opinion on playing in 2025 and that he still thinks he wants to play next year: pic.twitter.com/1OldVNuvW9 — Jets Videos (@snyjets) November 13, 2024 So Rodgers sounds ready to give it another go, which raises the next question: Do the Jets want to run it back with Rodgers next season? Rodgers, who suffered a torn Achilles tendon last season, will turn 41 in December. His arrow is not pointing up. If he chooses not to retire, the Jets would face a choice on the third year of his three-year, $112.5 million contract. Keep him, and carry a salary cap hit of $23.5 million. Or release him and carry a dead cap hit of $49 million that could be split over the course of two seasons — $14 million in 2025 and $35 million in 2026. The reasons for Rodgers to want to return are obvious — on the financial front, at least. The football reasons are less so. Rodgers has four MVPs and a Super Bowl ring and is five years away from his induction to Canton from the moment he retires. His football legacy is secure. He joined the Jets under the presumption that the pairing would offer a chance for a second Super Bowl ring. Those dreams are dashed for this season, and there's little to suggest another run next season would produce the desired results. So will Rodgers feel the same way in the offseason when faced with the prospect of another season of NFL hits? We'll have to wait and see. But for now, he's ready to play out the remainder of his contract. If that holds true, the ball will move directly into the Jets' court."

Giants starter Daniel Jones has struggled this season, and the Giants (2-8) took their fifth straight loss in Munich, Germany, on Sunday. His poor performance against the shaky Carolina Panthers—New York went scoreless in the first half against the league’s worst defense—capped a rough first 10 games. More from Sportico.com CBS Gears Up for Another Smashing Chiefs-Bills Showdown Sporticast 395: The NFL, WTA Offer Two Versions of Global Expansion NFL International Games to Increase in 2025, Goodell Says Now, the team must decide whether to end the Jones era that has resulted in one playoff win in the last six years. Giants head coach Brian Daboll is considering benching him—and Jones’ contract could offer a rationale beyond his on-field play. Jones currently has an injury guarantee clause in his contract that if triggered will force the Giants to pay him $23 million next year. He’s the latest quarterback to experience this kind of dance after Russell Wilson (Denver Broncos) went through it last year. The Raiders also sat Derek Carr (now with the Saints) two years ago when the playoffs were out of reach to avoid triggering a clause that would have paid him $33 million guaranteed. “When you can negotiate an injury guarantee in a contract, it should be a feather in your cap, but in fact it can be used as a weapon against you, and Daniel Jones is an example of that,” NFL agent Brad Blank said in an interview. “If he had no injury guarantee, then maybe they would just leave him out there.” No decision has been made on Jones’ future, though his lack of first-team quarterback reps in practice Tuesday suggested the team is seriously considering a potential switch to backup Drew Lock. Giants senior vice president and general manager Joe Schoen downplayed the practice structure and told reporters Jones’ contract language won’t factor into whatever decision is made. “It will be a football decision,” he said on Tuesday. “Any decision we make moving forward as we evaluate the roster and what we’re doing for the final seven games will be football decisions.” New York benched Jones during a 28-3 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Oct. 20. Daboll remained supportive of Jones after the Week 7 loss despite the temporary demotion, but his tune has changed since. With his own job in peril, the third-year coach has sounded noncommittal when asked about Jones in the starter role moving forward. Jones, who has thrown eight touchdowns and seven interceptions this season, signed a four-year, $160 million contract extension last year. There is no more guaranteed money beyond this year, but that would change if he is unable to pass a physical in March after the 2025 league year begins due to an injury sustained this season. It’s not uncommon for quarterbacks, usually among the team’s highest paid players, to have such injury stipulations in their contracts. “If a guy is slated to make big money, and he’s not going to be in the future then they’re probably going to sit him down if he has a March bonus coming,” Roc Nation co-head of football and NFL agent John Thornton said in an interview. “That’s what (injury guarantees) are for, to put a trigger in so if they have no plans to bring him back, then the player and the team can get out of it.” The Giants will absorb $22 million in dead money if they cut him this offseason, an outcome that is becoming more and more likely, especially with a star-studded 2025 QB draft class. New York is on a bye week and will look to snap the losing streak on Nov. 24 at home against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

It began when left tackle Jedrick Wills made an odd revelation Monday. The former first-round pick has been hobbled by knee injuries in the past two seasons, missing the second half of last year with an MCL tear, but was supposedly healthy when he got benched ahead of the Browns' game against the Los Angeles Chargers on Nov. 3. However, Wills seemingly revealed to reporters this week that this benching was preceded by a conscious decision to not play against the Baltimore Ravens on Oct. 27, calling it a ""business decision."" From Cleveland.com: “I mean, I decided myself that, I made a business decision not to play after the Bengals game going into that Ravens game because I was injured. And then the next week is when I received the news.” Wills is a pending free agent and has plenty of incentive to stay healthy for the rest of the season. However, that comment triggered plenty of backlash, so much so that head coach Kevin Stefanski addressed the matter with reporters on Wednesday. Apparently, Will doesn't know what the words ""business decision"" mean in the modern sports dictionary: ""I talked to Jed, it was a poor choice of words,"" Stefanski said. ""I know the connotation of 'business decision.' That's not how he meant it. He did not feel like he was near 100% to help us, but a poor choice of words and he understands that."" Stefanski also pushed back on the idea Wills had suffered a setback with his knee. Wills reportedly hyperextended that left knee, the same one in which the MCL was torn, on Oct. 20 against the Cincinnati Bengals. Stefanski said Wills was simply going through a lengthy rehab process: ""I wouldn't categorize it was 'setback.' It hasn't recovered how quickly he would want it to and there's obviously times that you maybe tweak an injury or you feel it again, those types of things, but yeah, it's been a tough rehab for him."" However Wills recovers, Stefanski has indicated the team will be starting 2023 fourth-round pick Dawand Jones going forward."

Hayes sustained a left ankle sprain in practice Tuesday and will miss Wednesday’s game against the Memphis Grizzlies, the team said. Hayes will be reevaluated in one to two weeks. The injury is the latest the Lakers are dealing with among their centers. Christian Wood is still recovering from offseason knee surgery, and Anthony Davis was poked in the eye Sunday in their 121-103 win over the Toronto Raptors. Davis left that game early and was cleared to play Wednesday night, though it was the same eye in which he sustained a corneal abrasion twice last season. Hayes has averaged 6.3 points and 4.6 rebounds per game this season, his second with the Lakers after spending his first four seasons in the league with the New Orleans Pelicans. The 24-year-old had a season-high 12 points and six rebounds in Sunday’s win over the Raptors, too. Hayes stepped in to help replace Davis down the stretch of that contest after Davis' eye injury. Wood won’t be back anytime soon for the Lakers, either. Wood underwent an arthroscopic procedure on his left knee in September to fix a knee issue that was bothering him at the end of last season. Wood has started experiencing soreness in his knee in recent days and will now be out for at least another month. Outside of Davis, the only other center on the Lakers’ roster is two-way player Christian Koloko — who was cleared to play by the league after missing all of last season with a blood clot issue. He’s appeared in two games for the Lakers this season and one with their G League affiliate. The Lakers enter Wednesday night’s game with a 6-4 record, and they’re coming off back-to-back wins. They will open the NBA Cup, which started across the league Tuesday, on Friday against the San Antonio Spurs."

The former Celtics big man missed the Portland Trail Blazers' first nine games while recovering from offseason knee surgery but returned to the court last Friday, recording 13 points on 4 of 5 shooting in his 2024-25 season debut. On Tuesday night, however, Williams delivered one of the most impressive stat lines of his NBA career to date. The seventh-year big man racked up 19 points on 9 of 10 shooting while adding nine rebounds, three assists, three steals and three blocks in 25 minutes off the bench to help Portland upset the Minnesota Timberwolves in NBA Cup play. According to Basketball Reference's Stathead, Williams is just the second player in NBA history to record at least 15 points, three blocks and three steals in a game while shooting at least 90 percent from the floor. The other? Hall of Famer James Worthy in 1983.

He averaged a near double-double (10 points and 9.6 rebounds per game) during the 2021-22 season while earning Second Team All-Defense honors. Unfortunately, injuries have been Williams' Achilles heel. That 2021-22 season was the only time he played more than 60 games in one campaign, and he appeared in just six games for the Blazers last season before suffering a season-ending knee injury. Williams may not be long for Portland; he has a very tradeable contract (four years, $48 million) and could draw interest from NBA contenders ahead of the February trade deadline if he can stay healthy. Wherever Williams ends up, though, here's hoping injury luck is on his side so we can witness more highlights like the ones he delivered Tuesday night."

The Bears' offense is struggling, going without a touchdown in two straight games, and Waldron paid the price this week. He was fired and replaced by Thomas Brown. While there were schematic problems with the Bears' offense under Waldron, there was more under the hood. Some Bears players aired some of that out Wednesday. Receiver DJ Moore has been critical of Waldron in the past. He questioned a bad play-call that contributed to a loss against the Washington Commanders, when there was a goal-line handoff to offensive lineman Doug Kramer and it was fumbled. Later, Moore hinted that head coach Matt Eberflus asked him to keep any criticism in-house. Without Waldron in that house any more, Moore said that suggestions to Waldron were considered too late to be effective. “When we wanted a call, it was like a drive too late,"" Moore said when he met the media, via Kevin Wells of WGN Radio. ""Or when we wanted to make adjustments and we waited 'til halftime to make it. And then we don't get the same look."" Bears receiver Keenan Allen said that issues ran deeper than that and went back to the offseason. “Too nice of a guy,"" Allen said, according to Kalyn Kahler of ESPN, via Dan Wiederer of the Chicago Tribune. ""OTAs, camp, we fell into a trap of letting things go and not holding people accountable and that’s a slippery slope. Just professionalism and doing things the right way from the beginning.” Moore told the media in Chicago that some frustrations were shared, presumably with Eberflus, but that he didn't want to see Waldron fired. Rookie quarterback Caleb Williams, whose struggles were a huge factor in the decision to fire Waldon, stayed away from any controversy. ""I don't get to choose decisions, nor do I get to choose whether decisions are good, bad or indifferent,"" Williams said, via NFL.com. ""My job is to listen, and from there, go do my job."" The Bears needed to make a change. The offense wasn't performing well enough, and No. 1 overall draft pick Williams was falling into bad habits. That was obvious. There were some behind-the-scenes issues that made the move even more inevitable."

McCarthy was the fifth quarterback off the board in April out of Michigan after Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels and Drake Maye went 1-2-3 and Michael Penix Jr. was selected eighth overall by the Atlanta Falcons. McCarthy was initially listed on the depth chart as the backup to Sam Darnold in the preseason. The No. 3 pick by the New York Jets in the 2018 draft, Darnold joined the Vikings this offseason after failing to hold on to a starting job with the Jets and Carolina Panthers and spending a season as a backup with the San Francisco 49ers. Darnold so far has had the best season of his career while helping lead the Vikings to a 7-2 start. But he's struggled in recent weeks with five interceptions in Minnesota's last two games, including a zero-touchdown, three-interception performance Sunday in a 12-7 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars."

And Sanders says he'll personally get involved in ensuring that the two of them land with the right pro team. Asked on Speak of FS1 whether he'll step in before the wrong team drafts his son Shedeur, Deion said he will, and then added that he would do the same thing for Hunter. But Deion said he'll work behind the scenes to get them on the team, not make a public statement about it. ""Yeah, but I'm not gonna do it publicly. I'd do it privately,"" Sanders said. ""And with Travis as well."" Asked what kind of team Shedeur needs to go to, Sanders said it's all about the franchise being ready to help him succeed. ""Somebody that can handle the quarterback that he is. Somebody that can handle understanding what he's capable of,"" Sanders said. ""Someone that has had success in the past handling quarterbacks or someone in an organization understands what they're doing, not just throwing you out there amongst the wolves if you don't have the support and the infrastructure of the team. Forget the line, he's played with lines that haven't been great but he's been able to do his thing, but just the infrastructure of the team, the direction of where we're going."" Deion can't stop any team from drafting any player it wants to draft, but he can strongly suggest to the wrong team that drafting Shedeur or Hunter won't end well for them. That worked for Eli Manning when he didn't want to go to the Chargers and got them to trade him to the Giants, and it could work for Sanders, Hunter or other college players, if they're willing to play hardball with a team they want to avoid."

Joel Embiid and Paul George are both listed as out for Wednesday's game against the Cleveland Cavaliers due to ""left knee injury management."" Their status appears to confirm a plan by president of basketball operations Daryl Morey, who said in the offseason that ""Paul and Joel probably [will] not play many back to backs, if any."" George and Embiid both played in Tuesday's loss to the New York Knicks. The 76ers will also be without All-Star guard Tyrese Maxey, who's sidelined for multiple weeks with a hamstring injury. The Cavaliers are looking to improve on a 12-0 start to the season. The 76ers fell to 2-8 with Tuesday's loss to the Knicks, continuing to raise questions about their playoff viability just 10 games into the season. They're in 14th place out of 15 Eastern Conference teams, a game ahead of the 2-10 Toronto Raptors. Embiid is sitting a game after making his season debut. He missed the first six games of the season for what the team described as ""left knee management."" He then missed Games 7-9 due to an NBA suspension for shoving a reporter. George missed the first five games of the season after sustaining a bone bruise in his knee in the preseason. He's played in the five 76ers game since and thrived in Tuesday's game against the Knicks with 29 points, 10 rebounds, three assists and three steals. It was his best game since joining the 76ers, and he showed no signs of any issues with his once-injured knee. Embiid was sluggish in his first live basketball action since playing in the Summer Olympics and showed signs of not yet being in game shape. It's not clear if he's dealing directly with any lingering issues on his left knee that required surgery and sidelined him for a significant portion of last season. He reiterated Morey's stance in the offseason that he's not likely to play in back-to-back games. ""If I had to guess, I would probably never play back-to-backs the rest of my career,"" Embiid said in October, per ESPN. The NBA implemented rules in 2023 targeting the load management practice of resting star players when they're not injured. Teams are subject to fines for various violations of the policy that include prohibiting teams from sitting multiple star players in the same game when they're not injured and resting star players during nationally televised games. The NBA launched an investigation into Embiid's absences earlier this season as he was sidelined without an injury designation other than ""knee management."" The NBA fined the 76ers $100,000 for public statements “that were inconsistent with Joel Embiid’s health status and in violation of NBA rules.” The league determined that Embiid was “unable to play” and that his absences did not violate the league’s player participation policy."

Identify the juiciest NFL offenses, and take as many of their players as you can. Now that we're in the middle of November, it's a good time to take stock of the offenses we trust and the ones we don't. Here's how I view all 32 teams for the fantasy value they collectively offer. All fantasy weekly grades are from FantasyPros using half-point PPR scoring. Chuba Hubbard has been one of the fantasy steals of the year, but he's the only playable guy on the roster. Imagine what Hubbard could do if he could face his own defense, the biggest rushing giveaway in the league. It's no fun to pull the plug on an offense, but we have no choice. You play CeeDee Lamb, sure, and maybe you hold your nose and use Rico Dowdle. Jake Ferguson plays tight end, so you might be stuck there. But this offense probably has no chance with Cooper Rush and Trey Lance. Drake Maye checks all the boxes: athletic, competitive, accurate. The mediocre offensive line in front of him has not held him back much. Rhamondre Stevenson has been a credible RB21 through the opening 10 weeks. Their smashing 2-0 start feels like it was 15 years ago. Alvin Kamara has been fantasy royalty all year, but his heavy workload is concerning given his frame and career resume. Calvin Ridley has shown he can produce with both quarterbacks, so welcome back to the Circle of Trust. Tony Pollard is gallantly playing every week despite injuries that keep him out of practice; keep an eye on Tyjae Spears. Hope for Jameis Winston to beat New Orleans this week, because this fantasy offense is far more interesting with Winston as opposed to Dorian Thompson-Robinson. Last three games for Cedric Tillman: WR14, WR3, WR12. Cedric the Entertainer. Jakobi Meyers and Brock Bowers are fantasy-playable, Alexander Mattison too if you want some empty volume. But there are no right answers in this quarterback room, and the Raiders defense is also getting trampled most weeks. Nobody sees Drew Lock as a savior, but Daniel Jones probably deserves to be benched when the Giants return from their bye. Tyrone Tracy Jr. has shoved Devin Singletary out of the way, notable when you consider Singletary's history with head coach Brian Daboll. There's nothing really wrong with Tank Bigsby, but the situation around him is falling apart. Trevor Lawrence isn't healthy, the team is losing games, too many game scripts get out of hand. The Jaguars don't use Bigsby in the passing game much and Travis Etienne Jr. has also returned. That's why Bigsby might be a justified cut in some leagues right now. Coaches have been fired. Play sheets have switched hands. Signature trades have been made. There are no more cards to play. Fold the hand. The Chicago offensive line is obviously a problem, but remember that sacks are more a quarterback stat than an offensive line stat. Caleb Williams is holding onto the ball too long, not that departed OC Shane Waldron did him any favors. Chicago played the second-easiest schedule to this point; it's the hardest in football moving forward. Audric Estimé was justly chased in the free agent pool this week, the new two-down pounder in Denver. But he had a limited receiving profile in college and hasn't caught a pass in the NFL yet, so understand we're talking about a capped upside. Courtland Sutton is starting to click with Bo Nix, hitting WR7 and WR7 the last two weeks. The Chargers are never going to be a proactive passing team, but Justin Herbert's efficiency stats are a dream. As we meander through heavy bye-week season, Quentin Johnston and Ladd McConkey are both worth considering. TE Will Dissly, too. The Colts played the 11th-hardest schedule for the first 10 weeks, but they face the third-easiest slate from this point forward. So it's the perfect time to go back to Anthony Richardson, even if it's not the best news for anyone holding tickets for this WR room. Tua Tagovailoa is back but it hasn't been much fun: QB22, QB19, QB22. The Dolphins don't trust their offensive line and they're worried about Tua's health, and it shows in the play-calling. The Steelers have the lowest pass rate over expectation in the league, which means Najee Harris is an automatic fantasy starter for the year and Jaylen Warren carries some flex appeal. George Pickens has WR3 and WR5 finishes in his last three starts, clearly better off now that Russell Wilson is the Pittsburgh starter. Note that Pittsburgh played an easy schedule to this point; it's about to get considerably harder. Joe Mixon has five 100-yard games and eight touchdowns, surviving despite a Houston offensive line that hasn't played well. Nico Collins is desperately needed back to fix the downfield passing game, but perhaps John Metchie III's Week 10 breakout has some stickiness. Jayden Daniels has been everything we dreamed about and the long-awaited Terry McLaurin career season has been glorious. But there isn't a second receiver getting home on this roster, surprisingly. Travis Kelce did very little the first three weeks, but Rashee Rice was hurt in Week 3. Kelce since then: TE5, TE7, TE30, TE4, TE3, TE1. The original plan was to save Kelce more for the playoffs, but plans have to be flexible when you hit a pothole. Most rankings have Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp close together every week, but Nacua's upside is higher when you consider how often the Rams prioritize him on a pass route. Could we get some consistency from Kyler Murray? Consider his weekly finishes: QB15, QB1, QB17, QB24, QB5, QB25, QB5, QB12, QB30, QB4. James Conner has been the most underrated back in football for a couple of years. Kirk Cousins went ballistic in his two starts against Tampa Bay. In his other starts this year, he averages a QB20 finish. For some reason, the Falcons gave Tyler Allgeier three straight goal-line rushes last week — all unsuccessful — before Bijan Robinson finished the job. The Seahawks have finally unlocked Jaxon-Smith Njigba, but the offense isn't the same without DK Metcalf. Give Seattle credit for keeping it moving — they play at the second-fastest pace in the league. If strength of schedule is one of your concepts, the Buccaneers could be your team. Tampa Bay has faced the hardest schedule in football to this point, and now it's the easiest moving forward. The Cowboys and Panthers are waiting in the final two weeks of the fantasy playoffs. The Green Bay passing pie always smells good, but that pie is cut into several pieces. Jayden Reed, Romeo Doubs, Dontayvion Wicks, Tucker Kraft and Christian Watson are all sitting between 39 and 47 targets. Jordan Love has raised his touchdown rate and YPA this year, but he's also seen a major spike in interceptions. Sam Darnold consistently pushes the ball downfield and most of his passing metrics are well above league average. But he lags in two critical areas — his sack and interception rates are both below code. When you can't avoid negative plays, you play with a capped upside. Kevin O'Connell is a dreamy play designer, but eventually, Darnold's mistake-prone nature will take this team down. All summer we wondered who was the right answer in the pass-catching room. But sometimes there are no right answers. The Bengals are the runaway leaders in pass rate over expectation, so Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase are ready to tilt fantasy seasons. Chase Brown will be impactful, too; Khalil Herbert's acquisition was merely a depth play. The backfield has two easy plays, but Amon-Ra St. Brown has been the only constant in the downfield passing game. Jameson Williams is their x-factor, the boom-bust guy. It's hard to believe this is an age-30 season for Derrick Henry; he's second in broken tackles and second in yards after contact (to be fair, there's some double counting when you mention both stats). And Henry's career trend shows he usually gets better as a season moves along. The Ravens have been slow to onboard Diontae Johnson, and even when Johnson gets more snaps, this passing game has several other legitimate options. I wouldn't blame anyone who cut Johnson. Jalen Hurts has become unfair with his success at the goal line, and there's more than enough left over for Saquon Barkley, A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith. No, they're not the best team in the NFL or even the NFC. They might not even win their division. But Christian McCaffrey instantly returned to bell-cow status and Jauan Jennings is already a WR2 for fantasy purposes, settling into the X role that Brandon Aiyuk vacated."

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",SMU’s path to the CFP is clear … and clearly ironic,https://sports.yahoo.com/smus-path-to-the-cfp-is-clear--and-clearly-ironic-165336186.html,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 16:53:36 GMT",Win out and the Mustangs will be in the College Football Playoff despite getting no TV revenue from the ACC.,"Karma comes at you in strange ways. Sometimes it hits like a sledgehammer, sometimes like a creeping fog. And sometimes, karma shows up riding a mustang. SMU is one of the best teams in the ACC this season, a legitimate conference championship and playoff contender despite the fact that the Mustangs aren’t receiving any of the ACC’s TV riches. That’s funny enough, but when you factor in another element — Florida State’s woeful 2024 faceplant — well, that raises SMU’s season to the level of art. The Mustangs are 5-0 in the ACC, 8-1 overall, leading the conference and in prime position to challenge for a first-round bye in the College Football Playoff. Florida State, meanwhile, is 1-7 in the conference and 1-9 overall, a failure so catastrophic it’ll leave scars on this program for years. Yes, the irony is thick here; Florida State is in the midst of a lawsuit against the ACC over what the school claims is an unfair distribution of media rights revenue. The lawsuit is widely viewed as a pretext for FSU to leave the ACC, which is locked into a TV deal until 2036, for richer pastures. Meanwhile, SMU isn’t accepting any TV revenue from the ACC for nine years, the price necessary to join the conference. It’s turning out to be some excellent exposure for SMU, and a hell of a deal for the ACC — at least the bully kicking everyone’s butt isn’t taking their lunch money. Yet. So let’s do what the rest of the ACC has done and leave Florida State behind. How legitimate of a contender is SMU? Both the AP and the CFP rankings have the Mustangs ranked No. 14 and behind Miami, despite the fact that SMU lost to Big 12 leader BYU and Miami lost to unranked Georgia Tech. The difference in rankings is largely a result of the early season disparity between the two, and soon enough, it won’t matter; if both Miami and SMU win out, they’ll meet in December in the ACC championship with an almost certain first-round CFP playoff bye on the line. The question beyond that is, would the ACC runner-up get a slot in the playoff with two losses? The answer: Probably not. The reason: Ole Miss, which leaped from 16th in last week’s standings to 11th this week, right over SMU. Big wins factor heavily in the CFP committee’s thinking, apparently, and SMU has no more big wins to gain outside of the ACC championship. The Mustangs close with Boston College (5-4, 2-3 conference), Virginia (5-4, 3-3) and Cal (5-4, 1-4) — wonderful schools, all, but not what you need when you’re looking for football legitimacy. The problem that both SMU and Miami face is — more irony — exactly what Florida State is, in part, complaining about: the ACC as a conference is so weak that a standard conference schedule doesn’t provide enough meat for a convincing case of higher rankings. Also hurting their cause: Both Miami and SMU managed to avoid playing Clemson, the only other team in the ACC with any kind of national heft. Matter of fact, even this far into the season, Miami and SMU only have three common opponents — stupid expanded conferences — and they’re both 3-0 against those opponents. Both teams beat Louisville by a touchdown and whomped FSU. SMU needed overtime to beat Duke, while Miami handled the Blue Devils easily. Cal still awaits on SMU’s slate; Miami had a memorable comeback win against the #Calgorithm earlier this season. CFP committee chairman Warde Manuel addressed the SMU-or-Miami issue when announcing the rankings, saying that the committee’s “feeling was that Miami was ahead of SMU in terms of their performance this year.” Numbers-wise, Manuel is probably right; Miami averages nearly 100 yards more offense and five points per game than SMU. Record-wise? Eh. That’s where it gets muddy, and beauty contests generally don’t pick muddy contestants. Don’t expect SMU to buy into the CFP’s logic. “To look at our league and say, ‘Well, we may be a one-bid league,’ but you look at another league that we have a winning record against and say, ‘Oh, they’re going to get four in,’ it doesn’t make sense to me,” SMU head coach Rhett Lashlee told the media on Tuesday. “Make it make sense.” The ACC leads the Big Ten 3-2 this season, and while the conference is 2-5 against the SEC, four ACC-SEC rivalry games are still to be played. You can debate the committee’s judgment — again, who would you rather see across the field, BYU or Georgia Tech? — but fortunately for SMU, there’s the finest remedy possible waiting at the end of the season. “We’ve just got to win,” Lashlee added. “I’m not going to gripe or politic for us. We’ve got to win. If we don’t win, we don’t deserve to be in the conversation.” There might only be one road into the CFP for SMU, but it’s direct, no turns or questions. And mustangs can run a straight line awfully fast."

Maybe it was him being respectful of a new process. Maybe it was a sign that time, the opponent he’d never lost to, was going to claim its eventual victory. Or, just maybe, it was all a mirage, the NBA’s all-time leading scorer and one of its greatest players still lurking, waiting for the moment to strike. “He's mastered the game,” Redick said. And he keeps showing how he has. Wednesday, James did everything in leading the Lakers to a 128-123 win over Memphis. When the offense went cold, he scored. When the ball bounced off the rim, he corralled it. And when a teammate shook open, he found him. James scored 35 points, grabbed 12 rebounds and had 14 assists — his third straight triple-double — all leading to Lakers wins inside their home arena. It’s the fourth time in his career with back-to-back-to-back triple-doubles. Among the 11 oldest players ever to have a game with a triple-double, James has 10 of them. “Just being very patient and taking what the defense gives me,” James said of this stretch. “I've been doing it for a while. So I understand time and score. I understand the waves and the swings of the game. So it's nothing new to me.” Wednesday’s heroics came with the Lakers having blown an early 15-point lead while their leading scorer, Davis, had been hampered with foul trouble and was largely ineffective. Read more: Spurs coach Gregg Popovich had a stroke, is expected to make full recovery Through it all, James was terrific, keeping the Lakers engaged and in the game even when it teetered. The Lakers, who had two days off to get ready for the Grizzlies, attacked Memphis early, playing like a team looking to get one back after losing in Tennessee last week. The ball popped from one side to the other, the Lakers creating open threes off crisp passing, forceful cuts and colliding screens. They corrected a lot of their defensive issues, sprinting back in transition and cleaning up Memphis misses off the glass. And then it stopped. Everything the Lakers did right in the opening minutes Wednesday quickly turned, as the team’s energy evaporated and their intentions gave way to bad habits. Despite the Grizzlies being without their starting backcourt, Ja Morant and Desmond Bane, Memphis cooked the Lakers’ defense in the kind of way that made strong performances in their last two games look like anomalies. Led by Jaren Jackson Jr., the one member of the Grizzlies’ big three that was healthy, Memphis outscored the Lakers 70-53 in the second and third quarters as the Lakers did little but half-heartedly swipe at the ball and commit lazy fouls. But the Lakers hung around, thanks to James, Rui Hachimura and rookie Dalton Knecht, who scored a career-high 19 points while making all five of his three-point shots. Knecht and Hachimura combined to shoot 13 for 15 from the field for 38 points. “I trust my shot and I work on it every single day. And my teammates know that, and they want me to keep shooting the ball every single game,” Knecht said. “They always look for me. And JJ has tons of confidence in me, always calling my number and having plays for me. I'm just going out there staying confident and not only just trying to shoot the ball, but find my teammates and then play defense and grab rebounds.” Read more: Bronny James makes his G League debut with LeBron and Anthony Davis watching And after Davis returned to the game with five fouls midway through the fourth, he hit a pair of clutch three-point shots to push the Lakers through the tape into their sixth straight win at home to start the season.

According to Steichen, it will be Richardson's job for the remainder of the season. Joe Flacco was the team's No. 1 the past two weeks — defeats to the Minnesota Vikings and Buffalo Bills — but Steichen said Richardson has shown improvement in practice that warrants giving him another shot to start. “It’s the attention to detail in everything he does,"" Steichen said. ""All the little things just have to be at a higher standard. That was discussed with him two weeks ago, and he’s made strides in those areas. He’s a pro's pro. It’s my job to get him there.” This decision comes two days after Steichen told reporters that Flacco would remain the starter, even after throwing four interceptions and losing two fumbles in two games. Despite the veteran's struggles, Steichen, at the time, wasn't ready to go back to Richardson. “You’ve gotta go through the process every single day,"" Steichen said of Richardson on Monday. ""And that’s where it’s at. He's a great person, phenomenal human being. Like I said, not ever losing faith or trust in him. We're going through a process right now, and that’s where it’s at.” Steichen said Wednesday that Flacco's play did not factor into this decision. In six games this season, Richardson, the No. 4 pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, has struggled. He has thrown for 958 yards, four touchdowns and seven interceptions with a 44.4 completion percentage. Flacco, meanwhile, hasn't been able to replicate the success he had last season with the Cleveland Browns. In his six games, he's thrown for 1,167 yards, nine touchdowns and five interceptions and a 65.5 completion percentage. The Colts are 2-4 in games he has played. Entering Week 11, the Colts are 4-6 and second in the AFC South, two games behind the first-place Houston Texans and just outside the AFC playoff picture."

My sons challenge me to play video games all the time. And I get it. Since I’m dad, I’m the target. But I’ve spent more hours gaming than they’ve been on this earth. I (think I) know more. And yet, I found myself staring at a third-place finish in a game of ""Super Smash Bros."" I’m pretty sure my controller had significant drift to it, but I’ll hold the L. There’s always more nuance or context we need to consider. Like, for me, I should’ve realized my boys were honing their skills before daring me to a match. Watching Week 10 felt similar. I would’ve thought Joe Flacco generating multiple turnovers would’ve brought Anthony Richardson back into our lives. I was wrong. Russell Wilson can’t possibly keep getting away with moonballs to keep the Steelers offense going. Yep, wrong again. However, it’s more about what we can pull from the top storylines to help us make lineup decisions. So, with a month before the playoffs, let’s dive into the headlines to tease out the takeaways we’ll need for Week 11. My knee-jerk reaction to C.J. Stroud’s second interception here was Nico Collins would’ve come down with the ball: Another INT! This time Carlton Davis comes down with the ball in the end zone for the @Lions.📺: #DETvsHOU on NBC/Peacock📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/6YROKoKRBE — NFL (@NFL) November 11, 2024 Well, maybe my intrusive thought was more coping than anything else. Sure, Collins has eight inches on Tank Dell. But Stroud lofting the ball eliminates any debate about his WR’s physical stature. Plus, even a cursory look at the Texans’ QB would show he hasn’t played his best ball over the last month. EPA per DB: 0.05 (Weeks 1-4), -0.15 (Weeks 7-10) Completion Percentage Over Expected: +0.6%, -8.0% Explosive Pass Rate: 17.8%, 13.6% With Collins (and Stefon Diggs), Stroud had two top-10 finishes in the first month of the season. His 263.5 passing yards per game were the fifth-most of any passer. However, hindsight being 20/20, there were warning signs. Stroud faced pressure on more than 25.0% of his dropbacks in every game. Defenses keyed in on Houston’s ailing offensive line and sent five or more rushers to keep Stroud from getting comfortable. Only Baker Mayfield (42.6% blitz rate) saw more defenders trying to break through the line. We dismissed the concerns as Stroud continued to make magic on third down. But now, he has fewer options downfield. And the shifts in offensive play-calling have made his situation even worse. Early-Down Passing Rate: 54.3% (Weeks 1-4), 44.9% (Weeks 7-10) Early-Down Rushing Success Rate: 40.0%, 34.2% Air Yards per Attempt: 7.6, 9.7 Joe Mixon’s workload has increased from 22.5 to a whopping 26.8 touches per game. However, the Texans’ run-blocking skills (or lack thereof) have cut his yards per touch by 16.3%. As Houston has gotten farther behind the sticks, Stroud’s target depth has climbed, increasing his volatility as a passer. And the offensive line woes have only increased. Stroud’s pressure rate has been above 40.0% in his last four starts, and he’s taken multiple sacks in each (eight[!] in Week 10). So, adding a WR even as good as Collins might not look like a boost unless he plans on getting into a three-point stance. But he was still the WR2 overall in PPG for a reason. The Texans used quick-game concepts (passes with an average time to throw under 2.5 seconds) on 44.0% of Stroud’s dropbacks in Weeks 1-4. Unsurprisingly, Collins led the team in targets on these concepts (23) at a clip of 2.97 yards per route run. Put another way, he turned those 23 looks into 14 first downs. That was while also creating explosives on 45.0% of the other attempts that came his way. We can’t project when Stroud’s protection will improve, but with his WR1 back (and advantageous matchups against Dallas and Jacksonville on the schedule), we should see the duo back in the top-12 discussion soon. Jaxon Smith-Njigba warned us about Shane Waldron. However, it took the vibes hitting rock bottom for the Bears to make a change. Normally, I’d say a switch on offense is good. Just look at the Saints. But for Chicago, there’s more than one issue keeping my optimism at bay. Caleb Williams handles the operation of the offense, maneuvers in the pocket and then creates out of structure. A great snapshot of what he brings to the table. pic.twitter.com/1X9mmjkNkV — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) October 13, 2024 Nate does an excellent job of highlighting Williams’s strengths above. We won’t see it in the boxscore, but the rookie QB already has command of the offense before the snap (heavy emphasis on “before the snap”). Williams can recognize defensive alignments and shift the protection (which sometimes backfires) to keep the offense moving. And yet, even in that video, we see one of the problems plaguing the Bears. Pressure Rate: 36.4% (10th-highest among active starters) Blitz Rate: 27.4% (12th-highest) Williams having to create out of structure has become something he needs to do at some point in every drive. Of his classmates, ehe’s seen the most blitzes in obvious passing situations. However, the offensive line isn’t the (only) root cause. Anfernee Jennings catches Caleb Williams for the sack pic.twitter.com/57RwT9RAlF — Ben Brown 🌻 (@BenBrownPL) November 10, 2024 To go with a high-pressure rate, Williams takes longer to release the ball. His 2.85-sec average time to throw in obvious passing situations ranks as the ninth-slowest. The delay indicates he’s not operating the offense as designed. And, given how his receivers have reacted to their QB being under duress, there’s a disconnect between Williams and the play-calling. DJ Moore (Air Yards per Target): 9.1 (clean pocket), 15.8 Rome Odunze: 9.4, 22.2 Keenan Allen: 9.2, 10.8 Even on the two-man route above, the receivers are well-covered far past the sticks. Williams has Cole Kmet as a checkdown for minimal gain but opts to wait for the more difficult throw. Even when the situation is neutral, he’s in survival mode. But it’s not as if, when the play breaks down, we get a better version of Williams. EPA per Play (on +2.5 sec throws): -0.23 (33rd of 36 qualifiers – min. 120 dropbacks) Scramble Rate: 10.5% (16th) Pressure-to-Sack Ratio: 31.5% (4th) His classmates have known how to respond to pressure since they became starters. Jayden Daniels has scrambled 32 times (most of the rookies) when defenders get to him. Bo Nix (16) and Drake Maye (14) have also limited negative plays by using their feet. Williams (12) has held his ground to the team’s detriment. And with Chicago’s upcoming schedule, we’d need more than a coaching change to inspire some confidence. If one of the Bears’ WRs were the focal point of the offense, I’d have them as a FLEX option through their gauntlet of NFC matchups over the next five weeks (with the 49ers in Week 14). But all three earned six targets last week. Keenan Allen’s slot role looks safe, but his 2.6 yards of separation are a career low. With multiple parts of the offense needing to improve, leaving Bears’ pass-catchers on your bench is the best move until we see things turn around. George Pickens’ status as Pittsburgh’s WR1 was never in question. The Steelers sent Diontae Johnson down to Carolina. Pickens’ only competition was third-rounder Roman Wilson and FA cast-offs Van Jefferson and Ben Skowronek. So, through six weeks, seeing Pickens with top-10 utilization metrics wasn’t a shock. Target Share: 28.9% (3rd) Air Yard Share: 46.4% (5th) Yards per Route Run: 2.28 (8th) While still making big plays downfield, Pickens bore all the marks of a top-12 receiver. But his fantasy scores told a different story. At 9.9 PPR PPG, Pittsburgh’s WR1 was no better than Christian Kirk (9.9), aka Jacksonville’s WR2. Ironically, Wan’Dale Robinson (13.1) stood head and shoulders above the Steelers’ playmaker. However, Pickens’ glaring deficiency was the same in both cases: touchdowns. Despite all the explosive catches, he was yet to find the end zone. Luckily, all it took was a well-timed QB change to solve that problem. GEORGE PICKENS...........WHAT A TD!!!!(via @NFL)pic.twitter.com/KuexHvpnJr — Sports Illustrated (@SInow) November 10, 2024 Admittedly, it’s only been three games, and Pickens has scored in two of the three. But there’s no denying Russell Wilson’s impact on the offense. Passing Yards per Game: 245.7 (Wilson), 184.3 (Fields) EPA per Dropback: 0.19, 0.04 Offensive Yards per Drive: 32.3, 28.8 To be clear, nothing’s changed for Pickens. He’s still seeing seven looks per contest and has amassed over 40.0% of the air yards. But Pittsburgh has accrued more yards, run more red-zone plays and, subsequently, scored more points with Russell Wilson under center. It’d be easy to say Pickens is just riding Mr. Unlimited’s wave of production. However, their two skill sets are the perfect match. Play-action shot plays to the boundary are Wilson’s superpower. Catching them are Pickens’. Since Week 7, the two (along with contributions from the ancillary options) have moved the ball on opposing defenses one explosive gain after the next. Mix in some tough runs from Najee Harris, and you’ve got an unbeatable offense. But I’ll put a slight damper on any long-term expectations. Per TruMedia, Wilson has generated 114 passing yards on perimeter throws (from the sideline to three yards in). That’s the seventh-highest mark on the season amongst all starters. He’s gotten there in three starts. But OK, let’s expand the aperture to go from the numbers to the sideline (nine-yard distance). Here, you’ll find 72.6% of Wilson’s passing yards. For some QBs, we have to gauge their margin for error qualitatively. In Wilson’s case, we already know it’s nine yards on either side of the field. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Expecting any three-game trend to continue is a tough ask. Regardless, Pickens is a low-end WR1 for the rest of the season. If Wilson regresses, Pickens' targets and air yards give him a viable floor. And with matchups against the Ravens' and Bengals’ secondaries on the schedule, we should be ranking him inside the top 12 for the foreseeable future. I should’ve left the “right?” part off the section header. There’s no debate here. Bijan Robinson is the RB1 for Atlanta. Watching him play emphasizes how his vision, burst and power work in tandem to carry defenders into the end zone. Accordingly, his advanced metrics align with the tape. Rushing Success Rate: 54.2% (1st out of 18 qualifiers – min 50.0% rushing share) Forced Missed Tackle Rate: 23.2% (4th) Adjusted Yards after Contact per Attempt: 3.6 (10th) On the one hand, we want efficient RBs. Whether their effectiveness is a product of run-blocking or their intrinsic abilities, we can expect them to make the most of their work. On the flip side, sometimes we’d rather take projectable workloads. And 19.6 touches per game (seventh-most) is an RB I’d want on my roster. But then I see baffling personnel changes in high-leverage situations that make me pause. No, Robinson wasn’t injured. He hadn’t run the ball down to the one-yard line on an explosive play, either. And yet, OC Zac Robinson saw fit to ram Tyler Allgeier into the Saints’ defensive front three straight times. What made the decision even better was Robinson coming in on fourth down and scoring. However, I won’t let a few goal-line carries deter me from valuing Robinson as a high-end RB1. Target Share (last five games): 17.5% (2nd) Yards per Route Run: 1.71 (3rd) Receiving Yards per Game: 36.0 (4th) I talked last week about thresholds for top-three RBs. You’re either The Juggernaut as a runner or earn work as a rusher and receiver. Despite Allgeier causing a panic every few weeks, Robinson now finds himself in good company. He’s averaged 5.2 targets per game while maintaining a hold on 56.0% of the totes. And for those wondering about his goal-line usage, Robinson did take all of the touches from inside the 5-yard line back in Week 7. Besides, with Atlanta’s upcoming schedule, Robinson’s receiving work will be the edge that keeps him in the top 12. Week 11 at DEN: 9th-fewest rushing YPG allowed to RBs, 4th-most PPR points allowed to RBs Week 13 vs LAC: 7th-fewest, 12th-most Week 14 at MIN: 3rd-fewest, 11th-most The matchups lend themselves to a multi-faceted RB. Before you ask, Allgeier has earned more than one target in a game just twice this year and hasn’t seen a pass thrown his way since Week 7. Allgeier still has contingent value, but it's Robinson’s backfield. And with his dual-threat ability, he’ll stay as an RB1 for the rest of the season. I understand a lot of gamers were waiting two and a half months for last Sunday. Christian McCaffrey’s return was one of the top storylines heading into the weekend. I’d be willing to bet fantasy seasons hinged on a strong debut. However, 16.7 PPR points didn’t feel that great. Bucky Irving (17.7 points) and Kareem Hunt (17.0), two guys off the waiver wire, scored more. Actually, both Tampa RBs had higher scores than the consensus 1.01. However, there’s more to take away from CMC’s first game back than the box score. #49ers Christian McCaffrey's season debut: - 19 total touches for 107 total yards - 13 rushes for 39 yards- 6 catches for 68 yards on 7 targets - Elite aura pic.twitter.com/MZ9xOmf2Ps — OurSF49ers (@OurSf49ers) November 11, 2024 Let’s start with his rushing workload. McCaffrey’s 13 carries were good for 68.0% of the backfield opportunities. Behind him, Jordan Mason and Isaac Guerendo combined for two rushing attempts. Otherwise, it was the McCaffrey show as if we were back in 2023. And don’t worry. The 39 yards (or 3.0 yards per carry) caught my eye, too. But there’s some context to his day as a runner. Pause the video above at 0:01 seconds and count how many defenders are at or within five yards of the line of scrimmage. I counted eight, and it wasn’t an uncommon sight for the 49ers. McCaffrey ran into stacked boxes on 53.8% of his attempts. On the season, 32 other RBs have had similar touch shares and comparable stacked box rates. As a group, they had an average 40.0% success rate on 4.3 yards per carry. McCaffrey had a 30.8% success rate while averaging 3.0 YPC. Given his time away, I’m willing to give him a week to get back on track. Besides, his pass-catching acumen is what stole the show anyway. Brock Purdy on his pressured throw to Christian McCaffrey: ""That's what we designed... He does a little double move stutter and heads up the sideline. We had a little protection issue and a guy got through, so I said I just have to get this ball up for Christian, it was all… pic.twitter.com/EaPq3q9nE7 — Coach Yac 🗣 (@Coach_Yac) November 12, 2024 McCaffrey was the 49ers’ WR2 on Sunday with seven targets. That was more than what Deebo Samuel and Ricky Pearsall (i.e., the actual WRs) saw. But it’s not just the number of looks CMC got but the type and their effect on the offense. Passing Success Rate (on early downs): 52.5% (Weeks 1-9), 70.8% (Week 10) EPA per Dropback: 0.19, 0.57 Yards per Passing Play: 9.8, 11.6 As shown above, HC Kyle Shanahan can send McCaffrey deep down the field on a wheel route to get him the ball. He doesn’t have to be a short-area option. Subsequently, the passing game moves more efficiently, takes more pressure off Brock Purdy and sets them up for more manageable third downs. With McCaffrey back, San Francisco could rotate in more of its exotic looks to pick up chunk gains. It’s not just about what McCaffrey can do with the ball in his hand. But what his presence forces defenses to honor. So, despite the lack of big results, the workload is a strong indicator of San Francisco getting its RB1 back, and the production will soon follow."

After all, we have a very limited amount of time to witness and analyze a player's performance. But never fear — Dalton Del Don is here to gauge exactly how worried we should be — if at all. Hill is the WR41 in fantasy points per game this season, and the return of Tua Tagovailoa hasn’t helped as anticipated. The Dolphins shockingly have the second-lowest WR target share (49.1%) this season. Running back De’Von Achane led Miami in first-read target% on Monday night, when Hill was tied for third with tight end Jonnu Smith. Hill has four times as many games with fewer than 25 receiving yards as he had over the past two seasons combined. Tagovailoa ranks 36th in deep throw attempt rate (7.7%). He recently passed Patrick Mahomes with the lowest average intended air yards (5.4) among all quarterbacks this season. Hill has taken a backseat to an offense that no longer throws deep (or scores as many points), and a wrist injury could help explain it. Hill’s wrist has been bothering him reportedly since training camp (and worsened during his arrest), and the initial MRI showed a torn ligament. It could be contributing to his declining route win rate this season. Hill’s fantasy managers are surely panicking given the new offense and injury news. Lamb was able to maintain fantasy production with Cooper Rush in the past, but his first game this season was a disaster. Rush lost as many fumbles (2.0) as he got yards per attempt. It was the fewest passing yards in a game with at least 20 attempts since 2015. Rush finished with a completion percentage over expectation (-13.5) in the eighth percentile despite an average depth of target of just 6.4 yards (18th percentile). Lamb’s 10 targets resulted in 21 scoreless yards, including losing a touchdown in the sun. Trey Lance wasn’t any better while taking two sacks and getting picked off on six pass attempts, as Dallas finished with 32 net passing yards. Dak Prescott is officially out for the season. A move to Lance would be a disaster for Lamb’s fantasy value, but Rush remains the starter in Week 11. Lamb’s “expert consensus rank” this week is the WR15, as it’s hard to go too much lower on a player who leads the NFL in target share since Week 4. But Lamb’s new situation (and banged up shoulder) have fantasy managers entering the coping corner (he’s now a WR2). Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Williams isn’t likely in many starting fantasy lineups these days, but managers are still hoping for life from Chicago’s pass catchers. And from a bigger viewpoint, there’s real concern over the future of this year’s No. 1 draft pick. Williams is having one of the worst QB seasons in recent memory, ranking last among 106 quarterbacks since 2021 in catchable throw rate. He also ranks last in pressure-to-sack ratio over that span. Chicago’s offensive line has been average in pass blocking, while Williams has the highest average time to pressure in the league. When not pressured, Williams ranks 31st in Success Rate. He has the worst completion percentage on throws 15+ yards among 468 QBs over the past 15 years. Williams’ first career nine starts haven’t been quite as bad as Bryce Young or David Carr, but he’s right in their territory. a QB chart pic.twitter.com/FmJOQOxLLs — Hayden Winks (@HaydenWinks) November 12, 2024 Williams has faced the third easiest schedule-adjusted QB schedule so far! And he gets the eighth toughest moving forward. When not facing Jacksonville or Carolina defenses that rank bottom-three in EPA/pass this season, Williams has averaged 179.3 passing yards (5.3 YPA!) with only three touchdown passes over seven games. The Bears fired OC Shane Waldron, and even the discussion of benching Williams is shocking for someone with his college resume. Reportedly, some veteran teammates are calling for Tyson Bagent. The Bears’ offense ranks last in yards per drive, EPA/dropback, sacks allowed and touchdowns since their Week 7 bye. Chicago hasn’t produced a top-20 performance at wide receiver since Week 6, and DJ Moore has only one all season. D’Andre Swift also suffers from Williams’ struggles, as his splits in wins (108.6 yards from scrimmage, 0.75 TDs) versus losses (72.0 YFS, 0.2 TDs) have been dramatic. Williams obviously has a ton of time to improve, and a complete coaching overhaul during the offseason could help. But his NFL start has been highly concerning, and there’s zero chance New England or Washington would swap QBs right now. Thomas Jr. has seen his targets drop in half while averaging just 17.0 receiving yards over two games since suffering a chest injury. He also suffered from Mac Jones taking over at QB last week, which will be the case again this Sunday and could end up being for the rest of the season with Trevor Lawrence dealing with a significant shoulder injury. Jones managed a meager 4.5 YPA last week against a Minnesota defense allowing the seventh most passing yards. Jones targeted his tight ends on 59% of his passes, which isn’t ideal for the rookie wideout. While Lawrence hasn’t been the prince we were promised, he’s still leading the league in end zone targets (after missing a game), and Jones is a notable downgrade. Thomas ranks top 10 in yards per route run and sixth in fantasy points per target as a rookie, but his leap into fantasy stardom may have to wait until next season. Dobbins’ weighted opportunity share dropped to 56.5% last week with Gus Edwards’ return. He and Edwards both had 10 carries before Dobbins took the final five. On the plus side, Dobbins registered his highest route participation rate (74%) and target share (17%) of the season while recording 18 touches. Dobbins was also unlucky last week, getting tackled at the one-yard line and watched Justin Herbert and Hassan Haskins punch in short scores. But Edwards (or Haskins?) could be a problem at the goal line, and Dobbins has gotten just 3.5 YPC since Week 3 while returning from Achilles surgery. Dobbins remains an RB2, but Edwards’ return is a hit to his fantasy value."
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games","Fantasy Football RB Report: Meet the new leader of the Broncos' backfield, Audric Estimé",https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy-football-rb-report-meet-the-new-leader-of-the-broncos-backfield-audric-estime-151012829.html,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 15:10:12 GMT",Fantasy football analyst Pranav Rajaram takes a look at some key backfields as Week 11 kicks off.,"Running backs remain king in fantasy football. While it feels like there are more elite quarterbacks and wide receivers than ever before, the amount of consistent, dependable running backs is dwindling. This makes it all the more important to find value at running back in fantasy football. In order to help you do that, I will be taking a look at a few backfields each week that stick out based on recent trends or new information we learned. Week 10 saw a mixed bag of running back situations around the NFL. There were a few rookies who started to earn more work, some running backs who re-established themselves after battling injuries and a veteran who held off calls for a shared workload. Without further ado, let’s get into my top backfield takeaways for this week. I am pleasantly surprised. After claiming that Audric Estimé would get more work for the Broncos last week, Sean Payton actually backed it up. Estimé led the Broncos in touches by far against the Chiefs, with 14 carries to Jaleel McLaughlin’s two and Javonte Williams’ one. Estimé also played a season-high 26 snaps, which was more than Williams and McLaughlin combined. This was a bit of a strange situation because McLaughlin started the game for the Broncos and Williams was used on the team’s first drive as well, but Estimé saw essentially all the work after ripping off two explosive runs late in the first quarter. This indicates that the Broncos might ride with the hot hand on a weekly basis based on who looks the best early on, but even so, I think that bodes well for Estimé. Estimé should be this week’s top waiver priority even if his usage isn’t a shift for good. It is extremely rare to find the RB1 on a team this late in the season without an injury, which makes Estimé a massive potential value if he continues to see this type of volume. His lack of involvement in the passing game does limit his ceiling a little bit, but I’d still be comfortable spending 15-20% of my FAAB budget on him, as he could become a solid RB2 for your team. Meanwhile, I would avoid starting Williams in the next few weeks as he very well might be the team’s second or even third running back for the rest of the season, and the Broncos offense isn’t nearly productive enough to support multiple fantasy-relevant backs. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Gus Edwards made his return from a five-week stint on injured reserve and had a fairly productive day. He ran for 55 yards on 10 carries, getting back to his usual impressive yard-per-carry marks after a slow start to the year. Neither Edwards nor J.K. Dobbins had a particularly noteworthy fantasy day, mostly because third-string running back Hassan Haskins vultured a one-yard touchdown. Unfortunately, it looks like fantasy darling Kimani Vidal has been cast to the side with Edwards back; Vidal was a healthy scratch this week. Moving forward, I’ll be keeping a close eye on the Chargers’ goal-line-carry distribution specifically. If Edwards, who was excellent as a “closer” last year, starts to eat into Dobbins’ short-yardage work, it would create quite a confusing fantasy situation. Although Jim Harbaugh has made a point to label the Chargers as a run-first team, they have quietly been one of the pass-heaviest offenses over the last few weeks, ranking third in neutral down pass rate since Week 5. I’m not certain that both Dobbins and Edwards can coexist as reliable fantasy assets. For now, I’d continue to start Dobbins as he has a more established body of work this year, but I also think he is a sell-high trade candidate because of Edwards’ looming usage. Edwards is definitely worth an add off waivers this week. After being hampered by a knee injury to start the season, it looks like Jaylen Warren is finally healthy and getting more involved in the Steelers offense. Warren saw a season-high 14 carries on Sunday, which he turned into a respectable 66 yards. He added two catches for 29 yards through the air. Warren has averaged about 14 touches a game over the last three weeks, which feels like a stable number that we can expect him to hit for the rest of the year. Warren’s fantasy value obviously has a hard-capped ceiling because Najee Harris is still indisputably the RB1 in Pittsburgh. Harris ranks eighth in the NFL in carries and has received almost all of the goal-line touches, and you can continue to depend on him as an RB2. However, I think Warren is relevant in fantasy as a depth piece/fringe FLEX starter, as he is one of the more efficient running backs in the NFL and should benefit from the overall raised ceiling of the Steelers offense with Russell Wilson under center. Warren might have been dropped to your waiver wire by a frustrated manager (he is rostered in just 51% of Yahoo leagues), so be on the lookout for him. Trey Benson had another promising performance for the Cardinals, running 10 times for 62 yards. He was more effective than James Conner on the ground, with 29 more yards on 2 fewer carries. Conner still doesn’t seem to be in any danger of losing his role as the starter, as he received all of the goal-line work and had a productive day as a receiver. With that being said, Benson has flashed in back-to-back games, and I expect him to keep slowly chipping away at Conner’s workload after the Cardinals’ bye week. You can continue to treat Conner as a weekly top-15 play for the time being, but Benson’s impressive play should not go unnoticed. I hyped up Ray Davis a lot last week, but that may have been a bit premature. Davis was scarcely involved in the Bills offense in their win against the Colts, with just three carries for six yards. I was optimistic that Davis might get some work late as the Bills were up by two scores for the whole fourth quarter, but he ended up playing just 11 total snaps. James Cook, on the other hand, was quite productive, and he currently ranks as the RB8 in fantasy football. The Bills have a difficult schedule coming up, playing the Chiefs, 49ers, Rams and Lions in the next five weeks. So, I doubt they will be in game scripts that allow Davis to get too involved, meaning he is probably just a bench stash in fantasy football for the rest of the year."

Aaron Rodgers, who claimed he wasn't aware of the ""Red Line"" hashtag Williams applied to a celebratory post on Instagram, laughed it off when asked about it on Wednesday by reporters. Does Rodgers have a response to Williams? ""I don't have one,"" Rodgers said, chuckling. ""I like Mike. I'm happy for Mike."" Rodgers publicly criticized Williams for running the wrong route on the play that became in game-sealing interception in a Monday night loss to the Bills last month. Rodgers said Williams should have been on the ""red line"" that runs (on a practice field) five yards from the sideline. When Williams wasn't where he was supposed to be, Rodgers adjusted the throw and the pass was picked off. Quarterbacks in the vast majority of situations don't blame receivers in public for incompletions or interceptions, even when it's their fault. Rodgers, who later claimed he was simply answering a question, broke that unwritten rule. Williams was clearly still thinking about it, even after he was traded to Pittsburgh. And Williams has every reason to. Rodgers could have simply said it was a miscommunication. Instead, he specifically placed the blame on Williams. It's no surprise. Rodgers attaches heavy importance on his obscenely impressive touchdown-to-interception ratio, since gaudy stats like that help support the argument that he's one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time, despite having only one Super Bowl appearance and one Super Bowl win. Williams is now playing with a quarterback who has two Super Bowl appearances. And Russell Wilson has never complained, publicly or privately, about a teammate. Even if he could have taken the position that the interception that cost him a second ring should be blamed on receiver Jermaine Kearse, for failing to execute the pick/rub on Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler that would have allowed receiver Ricardo Lockette to catch the championship-winning touchdown pass."
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Utah QB Brandon Rose suffered season-ending injury in loss to No. 6 BYU,https://sports.yahoo.com/utah-qb-brandon-rose-suffered-season-ending-injury-in-loss-to-no-6-byu-150653889.html,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 15:06:53 GMT",The Utes now have just two healthy quarterbacks on their roster.,"Utah will be without yet another quarterback for the rest of the 2024 season. Utes coach Kyle Whittingham said Tuesday night that Brandon Rose would miss the rest of the season. Rose made the first start of his career in BYU’s controversial 22-21 win over Utah in Week 11 but suffered a lower leg injury in the loss. Coach Kyle Whittingham said on his coach's show Tuesday night that Rose will be out six-to-eight months. With Rose sidelined, Utah now has three quarterbacks who are out for the year. Seventh-year senior Cameron Rising opened the season as the Utes’ starter but suffered a hand injury in Week 2 against Baylor. After missing time with that injury, Rising returned against Arizona State but clearly wasn’t 100% before suffering a leg injury himself. That injury put Rising out for the rest of the season. Former Washington QB Sam Huard is also out for the season. Huard, the son of former NFL QB Damon Huard, transferred to Utah in the offseason after spending time at Cal Poly. He hasn’t seen the field at all this season, though he’d have been an option for the Utes given the injuries to Rising and Rose. Rose’s injury means that freshman Isaac Wilson will get the starting job back when the Utes play at No. 17 Colorado on Saturday. The freshman brother of former BYU and current Denver Broncos QB Zach Wilson started in Rising’s absence and has played in the most games of any Utes QB so far this season. However, Wilson’s performance is why Rose started against the Cougars. Through seven games, Wilson is 98-of-177 passing for 1,200 yards and has thrown eight TDs and eight interceptions. He'll be backed up by Luke Bottari against the Buffs. Since Utah has five QBs on its roster, the Utes now do not have a healthy third quarterback. Utah’s offensive struggles without competent QB play for the second straight season are a big reason the preseason Big 12 favorites are 4-5 despite allowing just 17 points per game. Utah ranks 11th in the country in points allowed per game, but is 1-5 in the Big 12 because it’s scoring less than 23 points per contest. Utah hasn’t scored more than 21 points in a game since Week 4 when the Utes beat Oklahoma State 22-19. That was Utah’s last win, too. The team has averaged just 14.2 points per game over its five-game losing streak — a streak that has included a lot plays with Wilson at QB and also with TE Brant Kuithe on the field. However, Kuithe also suffered an injury against the Cougars and looks to be out for the rest of the season, too. Like Rising, Kuithe missed the entirety of the 2023 season because of a knee injury. “We’ll miss Brant,” Whittingham said at his Monday news conference. “It rips your heart out to see that happen to Brant, but it looks at least at this time, pretty extensive and certainly season-ending from what we understand.”"

The FBI is investigating. Today is National Signing Day, when high school athletes across the country can formally accept scholarships from their chosen university — that is, if they haven't already been rescinded. Vanishing spots: The historic House vs. NCAA antitrust settlement has made headlines for the $2.8 billion in backpay to former athletes and landmark revenue-sharing concept. Less publicized are the roster limits that will result in thousands of athletes losing their spots. How it works: Most NCAA sports currently have a scholarship limit but not a roster cap. Under the terms of the settlement, which will take effect in July if approved, that will flip. In other words, while overall scholarships may increase, total roster spots will be capped and walk-ons could be eliminated entirely. The change affects not only high school recruits hoping to continue their athletic careers, but also enrolled athletes who've been told they're no longer part of their team. What they're saying: More than a dozen parents of college athletes or recruits spoke to Yahoo Sports' Ross Dellenger about the current reality playing out across the country. They were granted anonymity for fear of negative impacts to their children. A beach volleyball recruit, committed to a Big 12 program for months, was recently told the spot no longer exists. A sophomore cross country runner for an SEC team was notified by email that she was cut from the team two days after the semester began. At one SEC school, eight track and field runners were cut or pushed out over the summer. One power conference program released all of their 2025 men's swimming commitments. And in football, it is estimated that more than 1,500 walk-on players — roughly 20-30 per team — will see their spots cut. The big picture: In all, the 68 power conference schools are expected to eliminate at least 3,000 roster positions as administrators work to adhere to new limitations, reallocate resources to revenue-generating sports and balance opportunities to comply with Title IX. This change will have an outsized impact on Olympic sports, which could ultimately upend the Olympics, themselves, considering how many NCAA athletes compete in the Games. To wit, 1,217 current or former college athletes from 125 countries competed at the Paris Olympics this past summer, including 385 on Team USA alone. The last word: ""The beginning of change — it's new and fancy. You get to a finish line and you think you've accomplished something. In the middle of anything is messy. This is messy,"" SEC commissioner Greg Sankey said last week of the sea change coming to college sports. The Winnipeg Jets are off to the best start in NHL history. With their 6-3 victory over the Rangers on Tuesday, they've now won 15 of their first 16 games. By the numbers: Connor Hellebuyck has been superb in net (1.92 goals against average, .934 save percentage), and the Jets also boast the league's best power play (42.2%) and offense (4.56 goals per game). Not a bad combo! Per ESPN's Greg Wyshynski: They became the fourth team since 1967-68 to lead the NHL in goals for and against per game through their first 15 games. They've scored five or more goals in half their games. Their 73 goals are the third most by a team in its first 16 games over the past 30 years.

Could their historic start be the spark for long-term viability in the NHL's smallest market? The 2024 Emirates NBA Cup (in-season tournament) tipped off on Tuesday, with 16 teams playing their first of four Group Stage games. San Francisco — Klay Thompson matched his season-high with 22 points and was honored in his return to Golden State, but former Splash Brother Steph Curry (37 points) got the best of him in a 120-117 win over the Mavericks. Detroit — A wild and sloppy finish saw the Heat lose to the Pistons, 123-121 (OT), after Miami gave up a game-tying alley-oop with one second left and then got called for a technical foul when head coach Erik Spoelstra called a timeout they didn't have. Boston — The Celtics have one of the coolest-looking NBA Cup courts, but it didn't help them avoid falling to the Hawks, 117-116, for just their third loss of the season. Philadelphia — The Knicks beat the 76ers, 111-99, behind a triple-double from Josh Hart (14-12-10). Joel Embiid looked sluggish in his season debut, going 2-for-11 and grabbing just three rebounds.

(College Football Power Hour) 29 years ago today, Greg Maddux became the first pitcher ever to win four consecutive Cy Young awards. Only Randy Johnson (1999-2002) has matched him since. By the numbers: This season might have been his best of the four. The Braves righty went 19-2 in the strike-shortened campaign, making him the only pitcher in MLB history to post a .900 winning percentage with more than 20 decisions. He led the league in ERA (1.63), WHIP (0.81), complete games (10), innings (209.2), HR/9 (0.3), BB/9 (0.99) and strikeout-to-walk ratio (7.87). His preternatural ability to limit walks reached another gear, as he issued just 23 free passes all season. That included a 51-inning stretch without a single walk. Zoom out: Across the four-season run, which included his final year with the Cubs and first three with the Braves, Maddux won four Gold Gloves* and compiled a microscopic 1.98 ERA — nearly a full run better than any other starter who threw at least 200 innings in that time (José Rijo, 2.82). *Flashing the leather: Given his dominant pitching statistics, it's easy to forget that Maddux is also the greatest fielding pitcher of all time: His 18 Gold Gloves are the most in MLB history, regardless of position.

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Heisman Watch: Travis Hunter is the clear favorite with three weeks to go in the regular season,https://sports.yahoo.com/heisman-watch-travis-hunter-is-the-clear-favorite-with-three-weeks-to-go-in-the-regular-season-142417203.html,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 14:24:17 GMT",Hunter is an even-money favorite to win the award.,"Travis Hunter is a very deserved Heisman favorite. But his odds may be too high with three weeks left in the 2024 regular season. The Colorado defensive back has the lowest odds of anyone ahead of the Buffaloes’ game against Utah on Saturday. Hunter is at even money to win the award, and his odds are significantly better than fellow favorites Dillon Gabriel (+350), Ashton Jeanty (+400) and Cam Ward (+850). As those four players have separated themselves from the rest of the field over the second half of the season, they have taken turns atop the odds board. Jeanty emerged as the favorite in the first half, before power conference players jumped ahead of him. Ward’s odds were significantly lower a week ago before his Miami Hurricanes lost their first game of the season at Georgia Tech in Week 11. By now you know that Hunter is the only player in college football who plays nearly every snap on both sides of the ball. What he is doing is nearly unprecedented in modern college football. But it’s the wrong time to bet Hunter unless you’re really, really convinced no one else is going to win the Heisman. Hunter continues to be Colorado’s leading receiver with 69 catches for 856 yards and nine touchdowns. He’s caught over a third of Shedeur Sanders’ TD passes this season. He also has seven passes defensed to go along with two interceptions. His defensive snap counts are back to where they were during the first half of the season, too. After playing just 30 defensive snaps against Kansas State and Arizona because of a shoulder injury he suffered in the first half against KSU, Hunter played 62 defensive snaps against Cincinnati and a season-high 85 in the Buffs’ Week 11 win over Texas Tech. As long as Hunter keeps playing nearly every snap and Colorado keeps winning, he’s guaranteed to be in New York as a Heisman finalist. There’s still some opportunity for others to pass him, however. If Colorado makes it to the Big 12 title game, the Buffaloes have four more games before Heisman voting closes. But Gabriel and Ward are set for three more games, and Jeanty likely has four more himself. That’s nearly a third of the season remaining. And as we’ve seen before, voters can display a recency bias. A strong push from any of the favorites could be enough for the award. Here are the other players to watch heading into Week 12. Oregon QB Dillon Gabriel: The Ducks are 10-0 head to Madison to play Wisconsin this weekend and Gabriel just set the FBS record for most career touchdowns in Oregon’s win over Maryland in Week 11. Yes, Gabriel has played three more games than Case Keenum, the man who previously held the record, but there are some voters that will likely take Gabriel’s status atop the FBS record books into account at the end of the season. Boise State RB Ashton Jeanty: The junior has “tailed off” in the second half of the season. Notice our use of quotes there. Jeanty rushed 34 times for 209 yards and three scores in Boise State’s 28-21 win over Nevada in Week 11. That’s an average of 6.1 yards a carry. Anytime a running back averages over six yards a carry, he’s had a really good game. And yet for Jeanty, his YPC against the Wolf Pack ranks seventh out of his nine games this season. That’s how great he’s been in 2024. Miami QB Cam Ward: It always felt like Miami was playing with fire, needing Ward to bail the team out in the second half so often this season. And sure enough, the Hurricanes got burned. Georgia Tech’s defense did well on third downs and the Miami defense got run over by the Yellow Jackets’ run game. Like Oregon, Miami is off in Week 12 before two games where the Hurricanes will be favored to put up a lot of points. Alabama QB Jalen Milroe: Don’t totally discount Milroe from the Heisman conversation just yet. His odds are now +1800 and sixth-best in college football after Alabama’s blowout win over LSU. He should add to his lofty stats on Saturday against Mercer before sitting out the second half if the first two quarters go anything like we think they will. A big performance in prime time in Week 13 at Oklahoma could even further boost Milroe’s chances."

Smart said Monday that Pope was “an idiot” for celebrating with old high school friends who had rushed the field following Ole Miss’ win over Georgia on Saturday. Video showed Pope jumping around with some Ole Miss students after the game, a move that Smart also called “just stupid.” Pope apologized in a statement to social media on Monday, and Smart had also said that the backup safety had apologized to the team. On Tuesday, it was Smart’s turn to apologize. He said he should not have called Pope an idiot. “I don’t like to talk about the internal stuff going on in inside; he did talk to the team, did a great job,” Smart said of Pope on Tuesday. “I’ll say I should not have called the kid an idiot. That was a mistake by me. I appreciate Jake. He is a great kid, he works really hard, he’s a team player. I think he knows it was an emotional mistake and he told the team that. I appreciate the way he handled it.” The loss dropped Georgia to No. 12 in Tuesday night’s College Football Playoff rankings. The Bulldogs are a spot behind the Rebels and the first team out of the 12-team playoff field with three weeks to go in the regular season. However, Georgia has a good chance of being back in the field after Week 12. The Bulldogs host No. 7 Tennessee on Saturday night. A win will vault Georgia back into the top 10. Tennessee may also be without star QB Nico Iamaleava for the game as well. Iamaleava is reportedly in concussion protocol after he missed the second half of the Vols’ win over Mississippi State in Week 11."

They can do that by spending big money on one of the top free-agent starters, or they could find a trade partner. Chicago White Sox left-hander Garrett Crochet is currently the most coveted pitcher on the trade market. A number of teams have reportedly expressed interest in the 25-year-old All-Star, including Boston. Sean McAdam of MassLive.com recently reported the Red Sox are ""right in the thick of"" the Crochet sweepstakes. McAdam shared more intel on the Crochet trade talks during an appearance on the ""Foul Territory"" podcast. He identified outfielder Wilyer Abreu as a player Chicago would be interested in as the main piece coming back in a deal. ""I would say Abreu could be made available in the right deal for a frontline starter like Crochet,"" he said. ""In fact, I was told that the White Sox have interest in Abreu and would be satisfied with him headlining -- obviously, not being the only guy in the deal. They'd have to put in much more than that, including a pretty good prospect to go with him, but Abreu is someone on the White Sox' radar."" The Red Sox, as McAdam notes, have a logjam in the outfield. They also have a left-handed heavy lineup, so as a left-handed outfielder, Abreu is one of their most sensible trade chips in a potential deal for starting pitching. ""It's not like the Red Sox are trying to unload him. But again, they've got some redundancy here where they could move Abreu and make room and have an outfield that included (Jarren) Duran, Ceddanne Rafaela, maybe Kristian Campbell who's played the outfield, and certainly Roman Anthony,"" McAdam added ""So they're in a position where they've stockpiled all this inventory of intriguing young guys, whether they be top Baseball America prospects or guys with very little service time who would be attractive to a team like the White Sox in the middle of a rebuild."" According to @Sean_McAdam, Wilyer Abreu could be moved as part of a Garrett Crochet trade 👀 pic.twitter.com/2J6sFTmDEd — Foul Territory (@FoulTerritoryTV) November 13, 2024 Parting ways with Abreu would hurt. The 25-year-old is coming off an impressive rookie year in which he notched 15 homers and a .781 OPS in 132 games. He also earned the Gold Glove award in right field. But since pitching is such a glaring need, and Crochet has serious ace upside, the Red Sox would be foolish not to ponder making the swap. Crochet posted a 3.58 ERA and 1.07 WHIP with a whopping 209 strikeouts and only 33 walks over 32 starts last season. The White Sox lightened his workload in the second half of their abysmal 2024 campaign, so he finished with only 146 innings pitched. As for the prospects that would have to be included in such a trade, it's unclear if Boston would have to include one of their ""Big 4"" of Roman Anthony, Marcelo Mayer, Kristian Campbell, and Kyle Teel. If so, that could be a dealbreaker for a club that has touted its top prospects as the key to the organization's future success."

Only in the final 20 seconds of Duke's 77-72 loss to Kentucky did 17-year-old Cooper Flagg finally act his age. With Duke's nine-point second-half lead gone and the score now tied, Flagg seemed to sense it was his moment. He attacked 6-foot-11 Andrew Sarr off the dribble, used his body to create space and then started to rise for a mid-range jumper. Everything was set up for Flagg to deliver a signature basket on the Champions Classic stage, but for one of the first times all night the Duke freshman failed to come through. He never saw Otega Oweh leave his man, enabling the Kentucky guard to poke the ball away, streak down court and draw a foul as he went up for a potential go-ahead layup. Cooper Flagg turned the ball over two possessions in a row late in regulation.No. 19 Kentucky takes down No. 6 Duke 77-72‼️ pic.twitter.com/11fiwuov61 — ESPN (@espn) November 13, 2024 Flagg had a chance for redemption after Oweh sank two foul shots, but the Duke freshman lost control of the ball as he tried to take Kentucky 7-footer Amari Williams off the dribble. He lay flat on his back in disbelief until two teammates came over to help him up. That would have been painful enough for Flagg, but it somehow got worse when Kentucky's Lamont Butler went to the foul line to try to clinch the victory with 5.1 seconds remaining. Flagg failed to box out Oweh after Butler missed the second of two free throws, squandering Duke's chance at a last-gasp 3-pointer to tie the game. Flagg played all 20 minutes after halftime and finished with a game-high 26 points and 12 rebounds. He expressed gratitude that Duke coach Jon Scheyer trusted him down the stretch while lamenting that, ""It didn't work out."" When asked if he felt fatigued late in the second half, Flagg admitted, ""I definitely did a little bit, but I tried to fight through it as best I could."" If Flagg's mixed results in his first big test was the biggest story coming out of Tuesday's game, then close behind was Kentucky earning first-year coach Mark Pope his first signature victory. The 19th-ranked Wildcats rallied from a nine-point second-half deficit behind balanced offense and improved defense. When John Calipari fled to Arkansas on the eve of last season’s national title game, Kentucky athletic director Mitch Barnhart responded by taking two big swings. He made Dan Hurley tell him no, and the UConn coach quickly elected to chase a threepeat in Storrs. Then he offered the job to Scott Drew and flew his family to Lexington, only to have the Baylor coach decide to pass on the opportunity. The not-so-splashy ""Plan C"" that Barnhart pivoted to has so far proven to be an inspired third choice. Pope is one of Kentucky’s own, a team captain on Rick Pitino’s powerhouse 1996 national championship team and the first ex-Wildcat to coach his alma mater since 1985. He’s also the anti-Calipari in many ways, an innovator who runs a modern, 3-point-heavy offense. The veteran-heavy roster that Pope assembled on the fly bears little resemblance to Calipari's freshman-laden teams. The Wildcats feature nine transfers, including six fifth-year seniors. Their players have made 586 combined starts even if they had little time playing together. Experience mattered Tuesday night when Duke extended its lead to 56-47 with 13 minutes remaining in the second half. Instead of wilting, Kentucky ratcheted up its defensive intensity, allowing the Blue Devils only five made field goals the rest of the way. Tyrese Proctor and Kon Knueppel were strong in support of Flagg in the first half, but both withered in the face of relentless Kentucky pressure after halftime. That left Flagg to be Duke's primary initiator and playmaker, a lot to ask of a 6-foot-9 teenager playing in his first marquee collegiate game. For awhile, Flagg flourished. He shot 9-for-19 from the field, made smart decisions with the ball in his hands and showcased the athleticism, versatility and competitive fire that make him the presumed No. 1 pick in next year's NBA Draft. On one possession, he blocked a shot, led the fast break and drew a foul at the other end. On another, he outraced every slow-to-react Kentucky transition defender the length of the floor, his hustle producing a 2-on-1 fast break, an uncontested dunk and an immediate Kentucky timeout. ""He’s got to touch it,"" Scheyer said. ""I wish you could say that every time it’s going to work out, but that’s not reality. I’m just so proud of him. He willed us in that game, especially down the stretch."" For Flagg, the final seconds were a disappointing ending. All too abruptly, a signature performance became a learning experience."

Hardaway, according to NBA insider Chris Haynes, received stitches after taking blows to both his face and hitting the back of his head. An initial CAT scan was negative, though further specifics of his injury is not yet known. Midway through the third quarter of the NBA Cup game at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit, Hardaway caught an inadvertent elbow from Heat star Bam Adebayo as he was driving through the lane. Adebayo’s elbow drilled Hardaway directly in the face, though no foul was called. Hardaway got up quickly and tried to take a charge as Tyler Herro drove to the lane, but Hardaway’s head slammed back onto the court hard as he hit the floor. The wheelchair comes out for Tim Hardaway Jr., who took two hard hits to the head on the same possession. 🙏 pic.twitter.com/hcbqeoEbML — HEAT on FanDuel Sports Network (@FanDuelSN_Heat) November 13, 2024 Hardaway remained down on the court for quite some time. He was eventually taken off the court on a wheelchair with a towel over his head. He didn’t return. Hardaway finished with 11 points and shot 3 of 6 from the field in 19 minutes on Tuesday night. He’s averaging 12.6 points and 1.7 rebounds per game this season, his first with the Pistons after spending the last six with the Dallas Mavericks. “I didn’t really get to see it when it happened live, but they said he’s OK and just getting evaluated,” Tobias Harris said, via the Detroit Free Press’ Omari Sankofa. “We’re praying for him and making sure that he’s alright, because he’s a huge piece to our team.” The Pistons snuck out a 123-121 overtime win on Tuesday thanks to a wild blunder from Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, who tried to call a timeout when he didn’t have any with less than two seconds left in the extra period. That led to an incredible moment when cameras cut to former NBA player and ESPN personality Jalen Rose, who was stunned. The Pistons, who hold a 5-7 record after the win, will be back in action Wednesday when they travel to Milwaukee to take on the Bucks."

Then Spoelstra gifted them a free throw.,"Erik Spoelstra is one of the most respected, and highest-paid, head coaches in the NBA, with a reputation for disciplined play and getting the most out of his players for more than a decade. Even he will make some bad mistakes. He just happened to make a season's worth of them in the span of two seconds on Tuesday, with one of them bringing back bad memories for bystander Jalen Rose. A mistake-riddled stretch saw Spoelstra's Miami Heat blow a lead against the Detroit Pistons with only 1.8 seconds remaining in overtime. Holding a 121-119 lead after a Detroit timeout, the trouble began when the Heat nearly came out of the break with six men on the floor. Kel'el Ware got off the floor in time, but the confusion presaged Miami getting burnt on the Pistons' ATO play, which ended with a Jalen Duren alley-oop to tie the game. Spoelstra was so frustrated he immediately called timeout. The problem was, Spoelstra didn't have any timeouts left. That earned the Heat a technical foul, sending Malik Beasley to the free-throw line. He made the shot to put the Pistons up a point with 1.1 seconds left.

Rose was one of the stars of the ""Fab Five"" Michigan team that lost the 1993 NCAA championship game against UNC because Chris Webber infamously called a timeout he did not have. Spoelstra fully owned the mistake after the game, calling it a horrendous error: ""I just made a serious mental error there at the end. That's on me. I feel horrible about it. There's really no excuse for that. I'm 17 years in. We had talked about it in the huddle. I knew we didn't have anything, I just got emotional and reactive on that and I just made a horrendous mistake. ""You don't want it to come down to a mental error like that ... It deserved to go double OT and not have somebody get in the way of that. Unfortunately, even as a veteran coach, I got in the way of that."" That actually wasn't the end of Spoelstra's mistakes. After the timeout blunder, he proceeded to sub in outlet-pass maestro Kevin Love for a full-court pass, as advancing the ball wasn't possible due to his lack of timeouts. Unfortunately, because it was a technical foul, it was still Pistons ball. The end result was a foul on Beasley, who made another free throw, and an embarrassing loss to open NBA Cup play. The ending erased a huge fourth quarter for the Heat, who trailed by 14 at one point in the frame and reeled off a 9-0 run at the end of regulation to send the game to overtime. It was a typical gritty Heat win, until it became an inexplicably sloppy Heat loss."
"Yahoo!

And, yes, the New York media swung the club (mostly) on Wednesday, asking Rodgers whether his comments about lack of patience apply to the firing of Saleh. Here's the question from Rodgers's midweek press conference: ""Aaron, I just wanted to follow up on something from McAfee yesterday. You got asked about Chicago, and you were talking about ownership — kind of some owners have that patience and sort of say this is the plan, we're sticking to it. You played for a team where they fired the coach after five games. Do you think that this place did not have patience and should have stuck to the plan?"" Here's the response from Rodgers: ""I was really referring to the fact that young quarterbacks in general are kind of plug and play right away, and there's less guys like myself and Jordan Love and Pat [Mahomes] sit for a season. Various guys have sat one, two, three seasons, and you just kind of trusted that process to work. It's a different game now. And everything is so snap judgment. I think there is something to, in the beginning of whatever decisions you make, saying, 'This is what we're doing, for this long, and we're gonna trust this process because we have the right guys in place.' I think there's something to that. But I'm also the old guy, you know, talking about the way things used to be."" The follow up was this: ""So you really weren't talking about coaching change as much as quarterbacks?"" Said Rodgers: ""I was talking about quarterbacks, and how they're kind of plug and play right away. And there's snap decisions. Bryce Young got benched, Anthony [Richardson] got benched, different guys got benched early. And it's tough on the confidence of those guys. And sometimes maybe just sitting them to start is the best thing, obviously not for a guy like Jayden Daniels. He's stepped in, he's played really well. But it doesn't mean if you sit right away that you can't have success. And it also doesn't mean if you play right away and you sit for a little bit, you can't find the success again. It's just finding the right balance to that and having patience if you know you have the right guy."" Sorry, but Rodgers wasn't talking about young quarterbacks. Yes, that was the topic that started the conversation. But Rodgers pivoted from opining on the handling of young quarterbacks to broader concerns regarding the lack of patience among fans and owners. His full comments from Tuesday with Pat McAfee and A.J. Hawk start here. The kicker was this: “But you know what it starts with? Ownership. Ownership has to come out and make strong statements. ‘This is the plan, this is what we’re doing. We’re gonna trust the process or trust the guys that are in place.’ Unless there’s a major problem, an issue, an arrest, or something that throws a wrench in the plans.” That's a global observation, regarding all aspects of a football operation. Young quarterback, old quarterback, whatever. So does Rodgers think Woody Johnson failed to trust the process, or does he think there was a major problem or issue that threw a wrench in the plans? Even if the question were framed that way, Rodgers would find a way to tiptoe around it. We've seen it before. We'll see it again. He can hoist himself on his own petard in one breath, and in the very next he can say, basically, ""These aren't the droids you're looking for."""
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",College Football Playoff: Parity is about to bring chaos ... especially in the SEC,https://sports.yahoo.com/college-football-playoff-parity-is-about-to-bring-chaos--especially-in-the-sec-023117646.html,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 02:31:17 GMT",It's possible there could be an eight-way tie atop the SEC standings at the end of the regular season. Then what will the College Football Playoff committee do?,"The job of the College Football Playoff committee has rarely been simple, but it certainly has never been this complicated. In the old days of the four-team playoff, the selections were often obvious. Now there aren’t just 12 teams to pick and seed, there is something else adding a degree of difficulty. Parity. The transfer portal and name, image and likeness payments have quickly dispersed top talent to more schools — at the same strengthening contenders and weakening favorites. The gap between great and good has closed. It isn’t quite Any Given Saturday, but it is a far cry from even five years ago, when only two or three legitimate national title contenders existed. That means not just more teams that can now rightfully make a claim for the playoff, but more regular season losses that make differentiating between teams more difficult. Consider trying to sort through the Southeastern Conference — which the committee tried to do on Tuesday night in its second playoff rankings (Oregon is No. 1, by the way). The SEC has always been the biggest player in the playoff, winning six of the 10 four-team tournaments from 2014-2023. Yet the league was mostly top-heavy during that period, with select programs able to stockpile top five recruiting classes and roll season after season. Across the previous decade, just three SEC programs reached the four-team playoff — Alabama (8 times), Georgia (3) and LSU (1). Everyone else was a pretender. And now — especially after the SEC added Texas and Oklahoma to expand to 16 teams? Nine SEC teams are ranked in the committee’s top 25, including four that would be in the playoff field — Texas (projected No. 2 seed as league champs), Tennessee (No. 8 seed), Alabama (No. 10 seed) and Ole Miss (No. 11 seed). Georgia (12th ranked but out of the playoff field), Texas A&M (15), South Carolina (21), LSU (22) and Missouri (23) are on the outside looking in. For now at least. That’s the league this season. For the first time since 2007, no one in the SEC reached November without at least one loss. How did the committee sort out the SEC? Probably they don’t even know, and it may only get more complicated. Want chaos? Consider that if the following things happen, the league could finish in an eight-way tie for first place, with each team holding a 6-2 conference record and the need for complex tiebreakers to figure out the title game matchup in Atlanta. All teams win the games they are favored to win, except: Missouri beats South Carolina this Saturday. Auburn upsets Texas A&M or … either Kentucky or Arkansas upsets Texas and … Whatever team was upset wins the Texas-Texas A&M game. That’s it — eight teams would have a 6-2 league record. Long odds, sure? Impossible? Not even close. And while it may not finish with an eight-way tie at the top, the likelihood for some variation of a multi-team tiebreaker needed to sort out the SEC championship game matchup is pretty high. There are only a few games remaining featuring those potential eight teams playing each other — just Tennessee at Georgia and Texas at Texas A&M. (Side note: might be time to add a ninth league game and drop the late-November cupcake matchup). All of this makes it a nightmare for the committee. How do they measure the pack — head-to-head, strength of schedule, margin of victory, margin of loss, flip of a coin? And it may be recurring. While the initial fear mongering over NIL and the transfer portal centered on the “rich getting richer,” the opposite has occurred. Players are seeking playing time, content with whatever money they can get anywhere. They have little interest in sitting on the bench and burning seasons of eligibility ... and earning power. “Teams don’t have as deep of rosters as we used to,” Georgia coach Kirby Smart said last week. Earlier this season, he pointed specifically to the quarterback position, which is especially transient as signal callers seek starting jobs wherever they can get one. ""With the portal and the age of college football, anybody can get a quarterback, and it might be a niche quarterback,"" Smart said. ""It might be like he's not going to be the greatest pro. … If he can make plays, and you can build your offense around him and create problems for the defense … you can beat anybody out there.” In the SEC, that’s proven accurate. The league office might want seven or eight teams in the tournament, but that isn’t going to happen. It’s up to the committee to look past the records and determine who is legit and who isn’t. Then it will deal with some serious howling."
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games","If Astros can't keep mainstay Alex Bregman, here's what they're losing",https://sports.yahoo.com/if-astros-cant-keep-mainstay-alex-bregman-heres-what-theyre-losing-020053884.html,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 02:00:53 GMT","Bregman’s wealth of playoff experience, renowned work ethic and rep as a clubhouse leader are some of the headlining features of his case as one of this winter’s premier free agents.","It was an unfamiliar finish to the 2024 season for third baseman Alex Bregman — and an unexpectedly early entrance into free agency. When the Houston Astros crashed out of the American League playoffs at the hands of the upstart Detroit Tigers led by their former skipper, A.J. Hinch, it was the earliest a season had ended for Bregman since his rookie year in 2016. Game 7 of the 2020 ALCS — Oct. 17 — had been the earliest on the calendar Bregman’s Astros had been eliminated in any of the previous seven seasons. Oct. 2 has traditionally marked the approximate beginning of Houston’s annual deep playoff runs, rather than the abrupt end of one. But when the Tigers secured the final out on that Wednesday afternoon in the early days of baseball’s most unpredictable month, Bregman’s uncertain future was thrust to the forefront, with the possibility that the painful early exit from the postseason also marked his final game as an Astro. It’s possible that Bregman’s Houston tenure will continue as there are several compelling reasons to believe that will ultimately be the case. But Bregman will first hit the open market with the opportunity to start a new chapter elsewhere and bring along with him a nearly unrivaled track record of individual and collective success that would strengthen any roster and any clubhouse. Since the earliest days of his development growing up in New Mexico, all Bregman has done is win. He won multiple gold medals as a high schooler playing for USA Baseball’s 16U and 18U teams. He reached the College World Series in two out of his three seasons at LSU. Drafted with the second overall pick in 2015, Bregman’s professional career has directly coincided with Houston’s run atop the American League. Though the 84-win Astros missed a playoff spot in Bregman’s rookie year, Houston has qualified for every postseason since, including seven straight trips to the American League Championship Series from 2017-23. Only Derek Jeter played more postseason games through his age-30 season (110) than the 99 October contests Bregman has already participated in. Bregman’s 99 career playoff games already are tied with Tino Martinez for the eighth-most in MLB history, and he ranks in the top-10 on the all-time postseason leaderboards in runs (63), RBI (54), home runs (19) and total bases (164) — with his 30s still in front of him. Bregman’s wealth of postseason experience, renowned work ethic and reputation as a clubhouse leader are some of the headlining features of his case as one of this winter’s premier free agents. At the same time, October track record and off-field qualities are only a portion of the equation when teams are evaluating whether to commit long-term to a free agent. It’s every bit as crucial to understand what a player has to offer over the course of 162 games before even thinking about their added-value come playoff time. Bregman’s regular-season résumé is similarly stellar, although it can be broken into two distinct sections. In his early 20s, Bregman appeared on track to be a full-fledged superstar. His fifth-place finish in AL MVP voting in 2018 somehow undersold how good he was as Bregman’s 7.9 fWAR ranked third in MLB behind only Mookie Betts and Mike Trout. In 2019 — a season in which slugging soared across the league to heights unseen since the late '90s, likely due to a livelier ball — Bregman’s production exploded even further. He clubbed a career-high 41 home runs, drove in 112 runs and drew an MLB-best 119 walks, ultimately just losing out to Trout for the AL MVP Award. With that monster campaign during his age-25 season, the sky seemed to be the limit for Bregman. Since then, and since the offensive environment league-wide has returned to a more modest state, Bregman’s bat has ranged from good to great, rather than MVP-caliber. Still, combined with an excellent glove at third base, Bregman has consistently rated as one of the best at his position, albeit a notch below the inner-circle of elite players atop the league. Bregman’s identity as a hitter is rooted in his exceptional ability to make contact, with strikeout rates that annually rank among the league’s lowest. Combined with a tremendously discerning eye leading to routinely high walk totals, Bregman has long been an OBP maven. Though his average and maximum exit velocities pale in comparison to most traditional sluggers, Bregman has consistently produced a favorable distribution of batted balls that enable a boatload of extra-base hits despite his modest raw power. While he likely won’t ever replicate the eye-popping totals of 2018-19, he remains a safe annual bet for 30-ish doubles and 25-ish homers, perhaps depending on his next home ballpark. That trend continued in 2024, with one notable caveat: Bregman’s walk-rate plummeted to a shocking degree, dropping to a 6.9% clip that was nearly half the 13.8% rate he had posted over the previous six seasons. Though he continued to make a ton of contact, Bregman was far more aggressive in 2024, running his highest overall swing and chase rates since 2017, and his OBP paid the price. Bregman also suffered through the coldest start of his career in his platform year. His .577 OPS in March/April was his worst mark in any individual month of his career, and he was one of several Astros hitters scuffling amid the team’s stunningly poor first six weeks of the season. Eventually, the 'Stros found their stride, and so did Bregman. Though his OPS was still a measly .589 as late as May 27, Bregman warmed up in the summer months and finished notably strong, hitting .290/.337/.581 with 12 HRs over the final 38 games of the year. Though his frigid start and sharp decline in free passes kept his overall offensive output below his career norms, Bregman’s all-around value was still buoyed by a spectacular year as a defender at third base, culminating in his first Gold Glove Award. The honor may have partially been a product of lesser competition in his league — Matt Chapman plays in the National League now — but it still reflected a new apex for Bregman’s glove work, with him posting career-bests in Statcast’s Outs Above Average and Fielding Run Value metrics. That Bregman achieved a new defensive peak at the hot corner in 2024 made it all the more curious that one of the first pieces of information that surfaced regarding his free agency was a willingness to move to second base if the situation called for it, according to his agent, Scott Boras. Such added versatility could theoretically open him up to be considered by more teams, ones whose third base situations are already settled. Bregman also exclusively played shortstop in college and got some run at second base earlier in his career, so it’s plausible that Bregman is capable of moving back to the middle infield. And though it hasn’t yet hindered his ability to be an impact defender at third base, Bregman’s arm strength has rated as well below average, according to Statcast, hinting that his overall defensive profile may age better on the right side of the infield. Boras also revealed that Bregman recently underwent a procedure on his throwing arm to remove bone chips from his elbow, so that’s another element teams will need to consider when evaluating his free agency, though he is fully expecting to be recovered in time for spring training. Perhaps a position switch will indeed be in order, but for now, let’s consider Bregman for what we know he already is — a Gold Glove third baseman — and contemplate potential fits accordingly. The Astros remain firmly in the mix to sign Bregman as a free agent, with general manager Dana Brown signaling that Bregman was the team’s “biggest priority” and Jose Altuve’s adamant declarations that Bregman remain his infield mate. It’s quite possible that Houston is deciding between two paths regarding its next high-dollar commitments: retain Bregman this winter, or let him walk and instead prepare to pursue a long-term pact with Kyle Tucker, either via extension or a massive free-agent deal when the star outfielder reaches the open market a year from now. Perhaps team owner Jim Crane will push the budget to ensure both homegrown stars remain in Houston long-term, but that’s a pricey proposition. The organizational decision to let Carlos Correa leave in free agency was certainly a big one, but Jeremy Pena was ready as the heir apparent then. Such in-house replacements do not exist for the likes of Bregman or Tucker, heightening the pressure on Crane and Co. to secure one or both of them long-term to ensure a championship-quality position player core remains in place. The Astros are also one of the few contenders with an obvious hole at third base. Perhaps the Yankees could get involved if they miss out on Juan Soto, as they could slide Jazz Chisholm Jr. back to his more-natural second base. Maybe the Mets would pursue Bregman if Pete Alonso departs and rising star Mark Vientos moves to first base. Seattle is actively seeking upgrades at both second and third base this winter in search of an improved offense to support its elite pitching staff, but the Mariners haven’t spent big on a free-agent hitter in years, a trend that doesn’t appear likely to change. Perhaps Toronto would invest heavily in Bregman as a core piece on the left side of the infield in anticipation of losing Bo Bichette to free agency next winter. Might a reunion with Hinch in Detroit make sense? The Tigers have several infielders in need of playing time, but adding Bregman would be an exciting way to build off the team’s breakout 2024 campaign, and he would bring a much-needed veteran presence in the middle of an otherwise ultra-young lineup. The same could be said about an ascendant Nationals team, which has yet to find success the way Detroit has but features a talented core on the upswing — and a wide-open hole at third base that prospect Brady House does not seem likely to fill imminently. While intriguing landing spots can certainly be found across the league for Bregman, Houston still looks like the most likely destination on paper. That’s no guarantee, however, and the hot stove always has a way of surprising us."

Baltimore has a ton of weapons, but this isn’t one of those classic Ravens defenses. Pick: Steelers 27, Ravens 24 Sunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket Line: Packers by 5½. O/U: 40½. The Packers are fresh after a week off. That gave them some time to self-scout and for Jordan Love to get healthier. After an impressive stretch, Chicago has been a mess three games in a row. Pick: Packers 24, Bears 13 Sunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket Line: Lions by 13½. O/U: 47½. Jared Goff gets picked off five times and the Lions still win? This team believes — and for good reason. There’s always a chance of a letdown, but that’s unlikely at home against a two-win opponent. Pick: Lions 31, Jaguars 17 Sunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket Line: Dolphins by 7½. O/U: 44½. That was an impressive win at the Rams for Miami. The Raiders will have a tough time keeping pace offensively in this matchup. That said, the Raiders are rested and their pass rush isn’t bad. Pick: Dolphins 23, Raiders 16 Sunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket Line: Saints by 1½. O/U: 44½. Teams that change coaches tend to get a one-week bounce, and the Saints got that last week. Jameis Winston knows this Saints team, which no longer has Marshon Lattimore. Pick: Browns 20, Saints 17 Sunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket Line: Vikings by 5½. O/U: 40½. Sam Darnold has had five interceptions in the last two games, even though his Vikings have held on to win. Fortunately for Minnesota, the Titans can’t score and their defense is on the field too long. Pick: Vikings 24, Titans 16 Sunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket Line: Jets by 3½. O/U: 43½. Difficult to have any trust in Jets, who were absolutely manhandled by Arizona, but the Colts don’t have much to offer, either — plus, they’re on the road. Home team holds on. Pick: Jets 17, Colts 16 Sunday, 1:05 p.m. TV: NFL Ticket Line: Broncos by 2½. O/U: 44½. The Falcons are looking to bounce back after losing to New Orleans, and Denver’s defense is pretty good. Bo Nix is having a solid season and Denver keeps this one close. Atlanta hangs on. Pick: Falcons 21, Broncos 17 Sunday, 1:05 p.m. TV: NFL Ticket Line: 49ers by 6½. O/U: 49½. This is around the time of year the 49ers really fire their engines and start stacking wins. Christian McCaffrey is poised to truly resurface. Rested Seahawks keep this close. Pick: 49ers 27, Seahawks 23 Sunday, 1:25 p.m. TV: Channel 2 (CBS) Line: Bills by 1½. O/U: 46½. The Chiefs narrowly avoided a home loss to Denver and can’t be overjoyed about their play. Buffalo’s a little more banged up than most. Here’s betting the Bills put a first blemish on that gaudy KC record. Pick: Bills 24, Chiefs 20 Sunday, 5:20 p.m. TV: Channel 4 (NBC) Line: Chargers by 1½. O/U: 46½. The Chargers are stacking wins and gaining confidence, having scored a season-high 27 in consecutive weeks. The Bengals have been a bit more up and down lately, but they’re desperate. Pick: Bengals 27, Chargers 23 Monday, 5:15 p.m. TV: Channel 7 (ABC), ESPN Line: Texans by 7½. O/U: 42½. The Texans take advantage of their in-state rivals. When else are they going to catch the Cowboys with a bunch of guys hurt and Cooper Rush at quarterback? Dallas will have a tough time scoring.

One is that he's missed more games against Pittsburgh since becoming the starter than he's actually played and the other is that the two-time MVP has not been successful in the four starts he's made over the last five seasons. The Ravens are 1-3 against the Steelers with Jackson in the lineup and he's turned the ball over 10 times in those games. Seven of those turnovers were interceptions and the Steelers are the only team against which he has thrown more interceptions than touchdowns. On Wednesday, Jackson said that he can not explain why the Steelers have been such a tough nut for him to crack. ""I don't know,"" Jackson said, via a transcript from the team. ""It's a different team, right now. Different guys last year, it's a different unit this year, but it's always the same goal; we want to win. We want to be the ones that come out victorious, and that's going to be the goal going into this game."" Jackson has been on a tear this season with 24 touchdowns and two interceptions while leading the league in yards per pass attempt, but the Steelers have come up with the right formula for him in the past and Jackson's ability to counter that this weekend will play a significant role in the outcome of the game."

The bout is a controversial one considering Tyson is 58 years old, but on the undercard are three world-title fights including the highly anticipated rematch between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano. Organisers are hopeful of selling 60,000 tickets at the Dallas Cowboys' AT&T Stadium, which can hold 80,000 fans. The fight night is also the first boxing event to be streamed by Netflix, with Taylor and Serrano serving as the co-main event for the undisputed light-welterweight title. You can follow live text commentary of Paul v Tyson and Taylor v Serrano from 03:00 GMT on 16 November on the BBC Sport website and app. Why Taylor-Serrano deserves top billing over Tyson-Paul carnival Tyson health 'just fine' but precautions in place Paul tries to goad Tyson at baffling news conference The fights are being staged in Texas, meaning a late night for UK fans. The event is due to start at about 01:00 GMT on Saturday, 16 November. Taylor v Serrano is expected about 03:00 with the main event expected just before 04:00. Jake Paul v Mike Tyson - heavyweight (8x2min rounds) Katie Taylor v Amanda Serrano 2 - undisputed light-welterweight title (10x2min rounds) Mario Barrios v Abel Ramos - WBC welterweight title (12x3min rounds) Shadasia Green v Melinda Watpool - WBO super-middleweight title (10x2min rounds) Lucas Bahdi v Corey Marksman - lightweight (10x2min rounds) Bruce Carrington v Dana Coolwell - featherweight (8x3min rounds) Neeraj Goyat v Whindersson Nunes - middleweight (6x3min rounds) The Texas Athletic Commission agreed to sanction the contest as a professional fight that will count to each man's record, but have added several stipulations considering Tyson's age. The rounds can only be two minutes long and the bout cannot go longer than eight rounds. Another big thing is the glove size. Tyson and Paul will wear 14oz gloves rather than the traditional 10oz gloves worn in professional boxing. Knockouts will be allowed and a winner will be announced at the end of the eight rounds. As for Taylor v Serrano 2, all the normal rules apply. Women's fights are 10 two-minute rounds. Tuesday - open workout in Arlington from 23:30 GMT All fighters will be going through the motions from about 17:30 local time. Wednesday - news conference from 00:00 GMT (Thursday, 14 November) Paul and Tyson will hold a final news conference at about 18:00 local time. Usually the undercard fighters or the co-main event, in this case Taylor and Serrano, conduct a news conference first before the headline act emerges. Thursday - weigh-in from 00:00 GMT (Friday, 15 November) Each fighter will hit the scales 24 hours before the fight. Tyson and Paul will not be under pressure to make weight, but Taylor and Serrano will have to hit the light-welterweight limit for their contest. Tyson and Paul's records are worlds, and years, apart. Tyson made his professional debut in 1985, 12 years before Paul was born. Over a 20-year career, Tyson won 50 fights, losing just six with 44 knockouts. He is the youngest heavyweight champion ever having achieved the feat aged 20. He is a two-time heavyweight champion and reigned as undisputed champion between 1987 and 1990, beating the likes of Frank Bruno, Michael Spinks and Larry Holmes. Tyson retired in 2005 after back-to-back stoppage losses, but has done a few exhibition fights - including against Roy Jones Jr in 2020 - since then. However, Paul is the favourite going into the contest for several reasons. At 27 he firmly has youth on his side even if there is a big gap in experience. Paul has built a big career in the ring as one of the world's most famous YouTubers. He jumped on the trend of YouTuber boxing in 2018 before having his first pro fight in 2020. Paul has fought a host of recognisable names, but many of them are MMA fighters trying out boxing for the first time. Wins over former UFC fighters Nate Diaz, Tyron Woodley and Anderson Silva have been big spectacles. His only loss was to boxer and Love Island star Tommy Fury in 2023.  Paul's most recent win was over former UFC fighter and bare-knuckle fighter Mike Perry in July. Paul has never fought more than eight rounds, with seven stoppages on his record. In comparison, Paul has boxed 52 rounds while Tyson has fought 215 rounds. Taylor and Serrano's first fight couldn't have been closer and they have two of the best records in boxing. Serrano is a seven-weight world champion while Taylor is among an elite club in the modern era to win undisputed titles in two weight classes. Taylor, 38, has 23 wins and just one loss on her record, a 2023 defeat by Chantelle Cameron she avenged in her next fight. Serrano, 36, is one of the most seasoned pro female fighters on the scene today with 47 wins, two losses and one draw on her record. Taylor has one of those victories over Serrano, while the other one was way back in 2012 at super-featherweight to Frida Wallberg. We saw in the first fight how their styles gelled perfectly and just how many punches were thrown between them. A combined 320 punches were landed over the 10 rounds. Taylor won a narrow split decision in an instant classic at Madison Square Garden in April 2022. The Irishwoman suffered her first defeat since then while Serrano became undisputed champion at featherweight as she amassed five more wins. Taylor will defend her WBC, WBA, IBF and WBO light-welterweight titles, as well as the Ring Magazine belt. Their last fight was at lightweight for the same belts. Serrano is a former world champion at light-welterweight but that was in 2018. Former cruiserweight world champion Tony Bellew: ""Fingers crossed that Mike [Tyson] has that one big right hand in him and he saves boxing, because this guy [Jake Paul] is single-handedly trying to destroy it."" Jake Paul: ""I will beat Mike Tyson because the gods are on my side, the universe is on my side and I've done every single thing for the last four years properly to prepare for this moment and this guy does not want it more than me. I have the heart of a warrior."" Seven-weight world champion Amanda Serrano: ""Come on, Jake Paul."" Undisputed light-welterweight champion Katie Taylor: ""You can never bet against a legend, Mike Tyson.""

Peter Walton says that the viral video of David Coote was out of character. Walton was a Premier League referee until 2012 – a period when Coote was officiating in the Football League. “The video is, at first viewing, shocking. There are some Premier League referees I consider more loose-lipped and more laddish in their behaviour away from the public spotlight,” wrote Walton in a column for The Times. “David is not one of them. I would have described him as captain sensible. Not one of the lads. Unlike some referees, you rarely see him laughing and joking with players during matches.” Credit: X / @AnfieldEdition Coote has been a Premier League referee since 2018 and, pending an investigation, his future now appears to be in serious doubt. “If PGMOL ultimately finds that the video is as serious as it appears, the discipline David will face will be severe, but this episode will also damage the reputation of Premier League referees in general,” said Walton. “I remain absolutely certain that our referees are not corrupt – it’s the present standard of refereeing that is the concern for me – but conspiracy theorists will seize on something like this. “David will have been warned, as all referees have been since the early 2000s, about the risks of social media and the need to project a respectful image in public or when there is a chance someone is recording you in this way.” The footage, which has emerged after Coote took charge of Liverpool’s 2-0 Premier League win against Aston Villa on Saturday, appears to show the referee speaking in the wake of Liverpool’s 7-2 thrashing by the same opponents in October 2020. Asked by his companion what he thinks “of the Liverpool game earlier when you were fourth official”, the man in the video replies: “Liverpool were s---.” He is then asked what he thought of Klopp, to which he answers: “C---. Absolute c---.” Former referees’ chief Keith Hackett, writing in Telegraph Sport, said: “Coote’s comments made a sad day for officials and if the Football Association and PGMOL find him guilty they will have no choice but to hand him the most severe of punishments, because if they do not, the footballing world’s faith in officiating will be dealt a major blow.” Mike Dean, another former Premier League referee, said it would devastate officials from the grass roots all the way up to the professional game. “As referees you can’t put yourself in that position,” he told Sky Sports. “You can say things away from camera, you can talk among your friends… but you can’t let somebody video this and hope it is never going to come out. “It’s damaging for everybody involved. It will devastate referees from grass roots all the way to the Football League. You have just got to be so careful [about] what you say.” Dean has been in communication by text message with Coote to see how he is and believes that there could still be a path back to refereeing. “He’s still a colleague in a way,” said Dean, who stood down after 22 years as a Premier League referee in 2022. “Dave is one of the quieter referees of the group. He will be devastated. I don’t think it’s damaged his career beyond repair. “With all this media attention, would David still want to continue refereeing? That’s the bigger picture you have got to think of. Obviously, it will be hard to come back. “It’s so out of character. I was astounded. I feel so sorry for David as a friend and colleague.” Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Jayson Tatum dropped 13 first-quarter points to help the C's cut a 13-point deficit to two heading into the second quarter. He kept his foot on the gas for the rest of the matchup, finishing with a game-high 36 points to go with 10 assists, and nine rebounds. Tatum spoke to NBC Sports Boston's Abby Chin after leading the Celtics to an emphatic 139-114 victory on the second night of the back-to-back. ""Just wanted to bounce back,"" Tatum said. ""That's the good thing about the NBA is there's always another game. ... We didn't feel great getting on that plane last night, but we were excited about another opportunity to respond, and I knew we was going to play well today."" Wednesday's performance may have marked Tatum's best of the season thus far. He dominated with the ball in his hand while setting his teammates up for success and cleaning up the boards. He had only one turnover after contributing five of Boston's 20 turnovers in Tuesday's defeat. ""I just take what the defense gives me. I work really hard at this game, I put a lot into it, and I like to credit myself for being able to do a little bit of everything when I'm out here,"" he said. Tatum starred alongside Jaylen Brown, who ended up with 24 points and a season-high 12 rebounds while boasting a game-high +27. The five-time All-Star spoke about how when he and Brown get going, it's a game-changer for the C's. ""It's super important,"" Tatum said. ""Just by setting the tone with energy and things like that. You're not always gonna make shots, but are you impacting the game? Are you getting other guys open? Are you attacking the rim? Are you asserting yourself on both ends of the floor? And that's what Joe (Mazzulla) challenges us to do on a nightly basis."" The Celtics will enjoy a couple of rest days before returning home to take on the Toronto Raptors on Saturday night. Tip-off for that matchup is set for 8 p.m. ET on NBC Sports Boston. Watch Tatum's full interview with Abby Chin in the video player above."

The NCAA and USC announced they reached a settlement in the case. An NCAA investigation found that USC exceeded the allowed number of countable coaches during the 2022 season along with spring practices in 2023. Eight analysts did on- and off-field coaching during that period, exceeding the permissible number by six. Both parties also agreed that Lincoln Riley violated head coach responsibility rules but that he would not be suspended. The NCAA changed its rules restricting the number of coaches and their duties in January 2023. At the same time, head coach responsibilities were shifted from a rebuttable presumption to an automatic attachment. “Because Riley was not personally involved in the violations and demonstrated that he promoted an atmosphere of compliance and monitored his staff, Riley rebutted his presumed responsibility for the violations occurring before the rules change. For the same reasons, the parties also agreed that a suspension penalty for Riley was not appropriate,” the NCAA said in a news release announcing the settlement. The NCAA also restricted USC from having its special teams analyst in practice and film review for six consecutive days during two weeks of the 2024-25 season. The remaining analysts will be restricted from practice and film review for six consecutive days during four weeks of the 2024-25 season. “Since learning of potential violations related to our football program in May 2023, USC has worked cooperatively with the NCAA enforcement staff and with the Committee on Infractions, as we identified and acknowledged violations, issued corrective measures, and submitted a negotiated resolution in a timely fashion that was approved by the Committee,” USC athletic director Jen Cohen said in a statement. “We remain committed to upholding the highest standards of ethical behavior and integrity in our athletic programs.”"

So, while the Boston Celtics own the second-best record in the Eastern Conference at 9-3, there's still room for improvement. That much was evident Tuesday night, when the Atlanta Hawks handed the Celtics a stunning 117-116 loss at TD Garden in their first game of NBA Cup group play. How did a Hawks team missing three of its starters (including Trae Young) upset Boston as a 16.5-point underdog? For one, the Celtics committed a whopping 20 turnovers that led to 19 Atlanta points. But the C's also got dominated on the glass and in the paint; the Hawks racked up 20 offensive rebounds to Boston's six and scored 68 points in the paint to Boston's 32. The deciding score for Atlanta was -- you guessed it -- an offensive rebound and a second-chance bucket from Onyeka Okongwu, who elevated over Jrue Holiday and Jaylen Brown for a put-back tip-in. BIG O FOR THE WIN pic.twitter.com/yGZnbvcuRb — Atlanta Hawks (@ATLHawks) November 13, 2024 Tuesday night wasn't the first time Boston has been beaten in the paint this season. In fact, The Celtics are allowing 52.2 points in the paint per game (24th in the NBA), while scoring just 39.8 points in the paint per game (30th in the NBA) for a differential of negative-12.4. And if you ask former Celtics guard Eddie House, that's cause for at least some concern. ""Right now we're giving up 52 points in the paint per game. That is bottom-third in the league,"" House said after Tuesday's game on Celtics Postgame Live. ""And then we're only (scoring) 39 points (in the paint). ""I know we shoot a lot 3s, so I understand that. But we're last (in points in the paint). So, we have to find some sort of balance. It's OK sometimes to get to the rim to get an easy bucket, to get a deuce. We don't always have to shoot a 3. ""This isn't overreacting. I'm not gonna push a panic button on this. But these are little tiny red flags, and while they're small, you want to stomp them out so they don't become big red flags that could affect you later on in the season -- or something that somebody could look at and say, 'This is how you can attack this team. This is how you can beat this team.'"" The Celtics take (and make) the most 3-pointers in the NBA by a significant margin, so it makes sense why they rank last in paint points per game. But their interior defense and rebounding appear to be areas of weakness through 12 games this season, as highlighted by the stats below: Celtics offensive rebounds per game: 9.9 (19th in the NBA) Opponent offensive rebounds/game: 10.6 (T-13th) Points in the paint/game: 39.8 (30th) Opponent points in the paint/game: 52.2 (24th) Second chance points: 13.8 (19th) So, what's the solution? Obviously the return of big man Kristaps Porzingis will help, but the Celtics need more from their big man rotation of Al Horford, Neemias Queta and Luke Kornet, who have had their moments but overall have lacked consistency. Jaylen Brown, meanwhile, believes it's a matter of effort instead of personnel. ""We switch, so we’ve got to fight,"" Brown told reporters after the game. ""We’re a team that likes to be able to switch, but you’ve got to rebound, and you’ve got to be able to fight."" The Celtics' interior defense will be tested again Wednesday night against a Brooklyn team that racked up 54 paint points against Boston while taking the C's to overtime last Friday night."

	Giannis got called for a foul despite getting all ball. But fortunately for the Bucks, as Rasheed Wallace once said, ball don't lie.","The Milwaukee Bucks played host to the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night, and while there is still a ton of basketball left to be played this season, you won’t find a more insane final 90 or so seconds of regulation than what we got out of these two Central Division opponents. The two teams traded the lead back and forth, and after a Marcus Sasser three tied things up with just under 30 seconds left, Milwaukee got the ball and had a chance to win. A wide open look by Taurean Prince did not fall, and with a hair over a second left on the clock, Detroit called a timeout, advanced the ball, and tried to replicate the magic it found on a sideline out of bounds play on Tuesday night against Miami. It looked like that was going to happen, as Cade Cunningham lobbed one up to Ron Holland near the rim, but Giannis Antetokounmpo was able to break things up … well, at least it looked like he did, but the referees called a foul that stood after a review even though it really did not look like Giannis fouled Holland at all. However, in the words of the great philosopher Rasheed Wallace, ball don’t lie. Holland stepped up to the charity stripe and missed short twice, which ended up sending the game to overtime. It would’ve been an awfully harsh way for the game to end for Milwaukee, but, again, Sheed’s got us covered here."

It went the way that things tend to go when teams travel to take on the Golden State Warriors: Steph Curry did some absolutely ludicrous Steph stuff, and the Warriors went on to pick up a 120-117 win to start their NBA Cup campaign. Curry scored all 12 of the Warriors’ points during a 12-3 run to close out the game, and plenty of people noted that he looked especially fired up after hitting a three with 27 seconds left that essentially iced things. It turns out there’s a reason why: According to Draymond Green, Curry was ghosted by Thompson in the lead-up to the game. “I’m stirring the pot, I pissed Steph off,” Green said on his podcast, which you can watch at the 4:30 mark of the video at the top of this post. “He’s like, ‘Yeah, I talked to Klay last night about’ — cause he was supposed to speak before the game. He was like, ‘Yeah I called Raymond and told him I’m not speaking. I just need to lock in on the game, so I ain’t speaking and I talked to Klay about it.’ He tried to check in with Klay about something else, and Klay ghosted him, so he got pissed. And here we go. Locked in.” Steve Kerr said that Curry was supposed to address the crowd before the game, but he and Thompson decided against it, while Green did drop a hint after the game that Thompson isn’t an easy guy to get a hold of when he told the press “You ever try to keep in touch with Klay? It’s very one-sided. The love is there. The relationship is there.”"

While the team previously said that Popovich’s absence was due to an illness, on Wednesday afternoon, the Spurs revealed that Popovich suffered what was described as a “mild stroke” ahead of their game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Nov. 2, 2024. “The San Antonio Spurs today announced that Head Coach Gregg Popovich has suffered a mild stroke,” the team said in a statement. “The episode occurred on Nov. 2 at the Frost Bank Center. Popovich, who has already started a rehabilitation program, is expected to make a full recovery. At this point, a timeline for his return to the sidelines has not been determined. During this time, the organization is grateful to the extended community for providing privacy and space to the Popovich family.” Assistant coach Mitch Johnson, who has been part of the Spurs’ famed coaching system since 2016, has filled in for Popovich as he’s been away from the team for the last six games. When asked last week for an update on Popovich, Johnson said that the Hall of Fame coach was “in good spirits,” even though there was no word on when fans could expect to see Popovich back on the sideline. One of the greatest basketball coaches of all time, the 75-year-old Popovich has been at the helm of the Spurs since 1996. He is a 5-time NBA champion, a 3-time Coach of the Year, and is the NBA’s all-time wins leader among coaches."

	Let's be honest, Charles Barkley and Shaq were always going to do this at some point.","It’s been a rough start to the year for the Toronto Raptors. While they were never expected to compete for a championship this year, injuries to a number of key contributors like Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickly have played a big role in the team going 2-10, which is the worst record in the league at this early juncture. A bright spot has been the play of Gradey Dick, the No. 13 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft who is shooting 37.3 percent from three and his upped his scoring to 20.1 points per game. He’s a good player whose last name has led to stuff like this happening, and shockingly, it was not until Tuesday night that the Inside the NBA guys had their inevitable meltdown over him.   A post shared by Dime (@dimemagazine)  “This boy’s ballin right here, y’all,” Charles Barkley told the crew. “I think you pointed that out, Gradey Dick,” Ernie Johnson responded. “I can’t say his name,” Barkley shot back. “I just can’t say his name. I’m not gonna say his name, I don’t give a damn what y’all say around here.” It was right around this point that we got one of the consistently funniest things on Inside: Shaq laughing so hard at something insane that Chuck said that he sounds like he’s furiously trying to clear his throat. Anyway, the fellas kept going down this road for a bit longer, because there was never going to be any stopping this riff once it finally happened. As for how the rest of Dick’s night went, he scored a career-best 32 points with five rebounds and three assists in a 99-85 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks."

	There was some extra juice in the building for Klay Thompson's return to the Bay, and Steph reminded the fans whose house it was late.","The biggest game of the night in a packed slate of NBA Cup games was the Mavs taking on the Warriors in Klay Thompson’s first game back in San Francisco since leaving as a free agent this summer for Dallas.  It was an emotional scene as they played a terrific tribute video and had the crowd in captains hats to honor their former star, but once the game got going there was plenty of juice on both sides in a reunion that wasn’t all happy. The two teams went back and forth, as the stars on both sides all played their roles, with Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving combining for 52 for the Mavs, while Thompson hit 6 threes on his way to 22 points in his return, including a big one late that gave Dallas a five-point lead midway through the fourth quarter.  That lead would get up to seven before Stephen Curry took over for the Warriors, scoring 12 points in the final 3:10 of game time, including a personal 10-0 run (aided by some spectacular defense from Draymond Green) that turned a Golden State deficit into a 4-point Warriors lead. His final bucket of that run was a vintage stepback three-pointer over Dereck Lively II, as he hit the Mavs big man with his signature “night night” celebration, before making a demonstrative declaration to the crowd that “this is my sh*t.”  STEPH CURRY HAS THE LAST 10 WARRIORS POINTS. 10-2 run to put GSW up 4 with under 30 seconds. 🏆 DAL-GSW | West Group C action🏀 #EmiratesNBACup on TNT pic.twitter.com/xNxak7xWr5 — NBA (@NBA) November 13, 2024  The Mavs would hit a three to cut the lead to one, but a pair of Curry free throws and a missed Luka three saw the Warriors win in regulation, 120-117. Curry finished with 37 points in the win, and while it’s clear there’s not actual bad blood between either side in the Splash Bros. breakup, there did seem to be a little extra fire from Curry for a mid-November game to make a statement at home with Klay now on the other side. While the “night night” is nothing new, the jersey popping and yelling “this is my sh*t” was more than we ever see from Curry in a non-playoff environment, and while I am a fan of the NBA Cup and think it brings out more competition in these games, I think this had more to do with who was on the other side than the Cup ramifications of this game."

	Shaq, who is never shy about being brutally honest when modern big men come up, did not mince words about Joel Embiid.","Joel Embiid took the floor for the Philadelphia 76ers for the first time this season on Tuesday night. Embiid, who has spent the start of the year ramping up to play after some knee problems, looked like someone who needs to work off a ton of rust, as he went for 13 points on 2-for-11 shooting with five assists and three rebounds in a 111-99 loss to the New York Knicks. It’s probably safe to assume that Embiid will be fine as long as he can manage whatever is up with his knee, while the Sixers — which find themselves 2-8 at this early juncture — have to get him, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey all healthy and clicking as soon as possible. But even if that happens, Shaquille O’Neal is not optimistic about Philly’s ability to win a ring with Embiid at the center of things, which he expressed at halftime on TNT. “In New York, it’s a tough team to play,” O’Neal said. “But this was the fear I had for Joel Embiid. You announce arrogantly, I’m not playing back-to-backs, Ernie. I’m not injured but I’m sore. I’ll come back when I want to come back. Now, when you say things like that, you’re supposed to come back with extra energy. 0-for-3? I would have been 0-15. But you know what y’all would have said. ‘Hey, Shaq’s not playing well, but he’s playing aggressive.’ The plan that they are having, it’s not working. And not only that, I say this respectfully, Joel Embiid will never win a championship until he gets his mind and his attitude right.” Shaq has essentially staked out a place in the basketball punditry world as the guy who will call out big men when he feels they aren’t living up to what they’re capable of, and clearly, he thinks Embiid is the kind of guy who can lead Philadelphia to a championship. In fairness to Embiid, while he did say he may not play in back-to-backs going forward in an effort to be healthy when the playoffs roll around, he said after the loss to the Knicks that he wants to play in Wednesday’s game against the Cleveland Cavaliers, even if the decision is out of his hands."

	With the game tied in overtime, Miami tried calling a timeout. There was just one problem: They didn't have one available.","The second annual Emirates NBA Cup tipped off on Tuesday night, with a number of teams taking the (very vibrant) floor for the league’s relatively new in-season tournament. In the East Group B, the Detroit Pistons played host to the Miami Heat and looked like they were going to cruise to a win before Miami got hot down the stretch of regulation. With things tied up, the two teams went into overtime, where Miami was able to take a lead with just under two seconds left before things got very, very weird. First, the Pistons drew up a beautiful sideline out of bounds play to get a dunk for Jalen Duren that tied things up. And then, a furious Erik Spoelstra walked onto the court and called a timeout. There was just one problem: Miami didn’t have one, which meant we had a classic Chris Webber situation on our hands — perhaps it was fate that one of Webber’s Fab 5 teammates, Jalen Rose, was in attendance and lost his mind. Malik Bealey stepped up to the free throw line, buried it to put Detroit ahead, then on the ensuing Pistons possession, got fouled one more time with 0.1 seconds left to seal the game. It was, quite frankly, stunning to watch Spoelstra make such a big mistake, but at the very least, we got a really entertaining end to a game that suddenly has some stakes to it because of the NBA Cup."

	Caitlin Clark found a very unique pitfall of fame at The Eras Tour: Getting so many friendship bracelets you start to lose circulation.","Taylor Swift’s “The Eras Tour” has been the biggest show in the world for the past few years, as the tour has had millions of fans pass through the gates at stadiums around the globe. After finishing her international leg of the tour, Swift added another run of U.S. tour dates, which included recently playing three nights in Indianapolis at the start of November.  In attendance for those shows was the biggest sports star in the city at present, as Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark wasn’t about to miss a chance to see her favorite artist play shows in her new home city. The only problem for Caitlin at the Eras Tour was that she’s too popular in Indianapolis, which meant she was being constantly given friendship bracelets from other Swifties. That’s a very nice problem to have, but in her effort to wear every one she was given, it started to create an issue, as she explained at the Women’s Leadership Summit.  “Taylor Swift, I just went two nights in a row in Indianapolis. I’ve been three times,” Clark said. “I had a ton [of bracelets], all the way up the arms. I had to take them off, my circulation was getting cut off! Everyone was just chucking their bracelets at me. I’ve seen her three times, and every time the show has just gotten better.”  She showed off her collection on Instagram during one of the shows and it was a lot of bracelets.  Clark has spent the last year or two learning the ups and downs of life as a superstar, but this is certainly a very unique pitfall of fame, being so popular you get too many friendship bracelets and start to lose feeling in your arm."

	The NBA Cup is back for a second season, and here's how it will all work and what groups each team ended up in.","The NBA’s efforts to add a little excitement to the doldrums of its regular season will return on Tuesday evening. For the second straight year, the league will hold its new cup competition, now known as the Emirates NBA Cup. The first year was fun, with the Los Angeles Lakers winning the whole thing by knocking off the Indiana Pacers in Las Vegas, and now, the NBA will continue its efforts to turn this nascent event into a crucial part of its calendar. What does this all mean? Well, we tried to answer that today by explaining what’s new this year, how the whole thing will work, and why we’re excited to watch this as it tries to become a tentpole event on the NBA calendar. So is this just the In-Season Tournament but with a new name? It is! While the NBA has never explicitly said this, my assumption is that they spent the first year calling it the In-Season Tournament so fans would get a sense of what it is before calling it what they always wanted to call it: The NBA Cup, or more specifically, the Emirates NBA Cup. Or maybe they just couldn’t find a sponsor in the first year. What’s that Emirates thing? I’ve seen its logo on courts but never actually looked into what it is. It’s an airline based out of the United Arab Emirates that sponsors a lot of stuff. They’re sponsoring this event, which is the second-best thing that the NBA does, and fortunately, Emirates has plenty of experience sponsoring the second-best thing, as they are the shirt sponsor for Arsenal. What? Just let me cook. Ok, so, any major differences from last year other than the name? A big one are the courts. Last year, they came under criticism from players (who kept slipping on them) and fans (who thought some were huge eyesores, particularly because of the weird, cumbersome stripe they had going down the middle of the courts). They’re not nearly as bad this year, as they replaced the stripe with rings in the center of the floor and got rid of some of the more abrasive designs that just do not work on television. I’m sure not everyone will love them, but I think they are a huge improvement on last year — we just have to see if players struggle with their footing on them, or else the aesthetic changes do not matter at all. What about point differential? I know some players disliked that. Well, that’s still sticking around as a potential tiebreaker for which teams do and do not advance. Frankly, I think it’s fine and we saw last year that some of the European players were trying to egg their teammates on — Domantas Sabonis was the main one I remember — but it’ll still take a bit of a shift for everyone to get on board with it. Remind me how determining how teams advance will work again? Sure! Right from the league: So the easiest way to move on is to just win your group and not worry about any tiebreakers. That is correct. Well then, what do the groups look like? Once again, the NBA broke things up into three groups of five teams in each conference — this will, hopefully, look a lot cleaner when expansion happens, we get up to 32 teams, and they can do groups of four in each conference where each team plays group games home and away. The group games will happen on Tuesdays and Fridays starting tonight and running through Dec. 3. Here’s how it all looks: West Group A: Minnesota, LA Clippers, Sacramento, Houston, Portland West Group B: Oklahoma City, Phoenix, LA Lakers, Utah, San Antonio West Group C: Denver, Dallas, New Orleans, Golden State, Memphis East Group A: New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Charlotte East Group B: Milwaukee, Indiana, Miami, Toronto, Detroit East Group C: Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington How do these teams qualify for the knockouts? Same as last year — win your group and you get a spot. Both conferences then get one remaining spot for a wild card team, which goes to the best remaining team that did not automatically qualify by winning its group. This is probably where those aforementioned tiebreakers would come in, but you never know. And will the knockouts work like last year, too? Yup! Single-elimination basketball games, with the quarterfinals happening on-site at home arenas and the semifinals and final happening in Las Vegas. The quarters are on Dec. 10 and 11, the semis are on Dec. 14, and the final is on Dec. 17. And are these games all considered regular season games, too? For the most part they are — group games, the quarters, and the semis will all count towards regular season records again, while the championship game will not. So it looks a lot like last year, then. That’s right, the league has, essentially, decided to keep a lot of things the same other than the name and the courts. Oh, also, as a programming note: home teams will wear their Statement Edition uniforms, while road teams wear their Association edition uniforms, according to the league. Huh, well then, ok. You don’t seem enthused about all of this, dear reader. Yeah, I mean, I am still unsure why I should care about this. Well that’s easy: You don’t have to! You’re an adult with agency and the ability to care about whatever you want, times are tough, maybe you don’t want to get super personally invested in a new thing the NBA is doing, that’s fine. But you seem to like this. I do! Why? I think a big split I have noticed here is “fans who like soccer” and “fans who do not,” with the former being more open to the idea of a midseason cup competition — Adam Silver has compared the NBA Cup to the FA Cup in English football, but basically every domestic league has a secondary cup competition. The thing is that these competitions are universally considered not as important as winning the league, but they are still important because it’s an opportunity to win something historic and provide some validation for a team’s season. The NBA Cup is only in its second year, so clearly, it has a way to go before it gets taken that seriously — the whole saga with the Lakers debating putting up a little banner is an example of this. But the FA Cup, for example, is not considered cool because everyone farts around and then Manchester City wins it at the end. It’s considered cool because teams from several levels of English football have a chance to win it, and sometimes, you get magical runs to the very end. We got a glimpse of what that could look like last year when the Indiana Pacers nearly won the whole thing. Hell, if not for the fact that they’re the Lakers, it’d probably be viewed as proof of concept that the final was between a Play-In team and an upstart young squad trying to win something for the first time. That is, to steal a phrase from the English, the magic of the cup. So acknowledging that this isn’t as important as winning the NBA Finals is fine? One-hundred percent. The longer the NBA sticks with this — and, let’s face it, Silver is essentially staking his legacy as a commissioner on this becoming a big deal — the more likely it is that it’ll settle into a spot where fans/franchises like that it is a thing that they can win, all while understanding that the big prize is still waiting for them in June. It helps, of course, that there’s a financial incentive to do well. Remind me what that is. Sure! Players whose teams make the quarterfinals make $50,000, players whose teams make the semifinals make $100,000, players on the runners-up make $200,000, and players on the team that wins the whole thing makes $500,000. Nice. I agree. Anyway, this sounds like, bare minimum, a thing I can have on my television on Tuesdays and Fridays. It is, and really, if that’s all that comes from this for the next year or two, that’s totally fine. Something like this will only become a big deal the more it happens and the more it becomes ingrained as part of the sport’s culture, and as long as this year is a step towards doing that, I’m sure it’ll all work out in the long-run. Nice. Well, I suppose I can tune in. That you can, and if you want to know what games are on, when they’re on, and which networks they’ll be on, you can click right here."

	The NBA Cup starts Tuesday night and we are looking at eight teams that should invest a little extra energy in the early season competition.","The second edition of the NBA Cup (now with a fancy sponsor, Emirates) will begin on Tuesday night as group stage action gets started. Feelings on the NBA Cup vary, but for the most part, it seems to have been at least a mild positive in terms of adding a little juice to November regular season hoops.  Last year, the eight teams that emerged from group play were the Celtics, Bucks, Pacers, and Knicks in the East, and the Lakers, Kings, Suns, and Pelicans in the West. Ultimately, the Lakers beat the Pacers in the final, marking the high point of the season for Los Angeles, while that was just the beginning of a run to the conference finals from Indiana. There are differing views from teams on how they approach the Cup, but because most of the games until you get to Vegas count all the same as regular season games, you should see contenders still trying at least until the quarterfinals where they may punt to avoid adding a trip to Vegas to their schedule.  Not every team has the Cup schedule circled on their calendars, and for some, it gets in the way of the long-term goals (either to get lottery balls or winning a title). But as the Pacers showed a year ago, for a young team without much playoff experience, the Cup can get guys feet wet to that kind of environment and build some confidence for the tournament everyone cares about come April, May, and June.  Here, we’ll look at eight teams that we think should be willing to invest early season energy into trying to get to Vegas and hoist the NBA Cup.   Houston’s gotten off to a strong start this season at 7-4, and I think they’re in a similar position to the Pacers last year, as they can use this as a way to test their young roster without much playoff experience. A successful run to the knockout rounds (and maybe beyond) would be a genuinely big deal for the Rockets, who can assert themselves as a genuine threat in the West playoff race with a strong tournament showing.  We saw that the Lakers were willing to raise their level a year ago in the Cup competition, and it’d be kind of incredible if they went back-to-back. Their group is a bit less daunting now that the Thunder are without Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein (although that’s still an excellent team), and if they make the knockout rounds, a team with LeBron and AD is always going to be a threat in a single-elimination basketball game. We’ll see if they approach it with the same aggression, but this is a team that has to try and chase wins regardless, so I’d expect the effort to be there, even if they can’t replicate the same kind of run.  The Grizzlies want to prove they are fully back as West contenders, and they can make a strong statement if they come out of the aforementioned Group of Death. They are playing at a high level right now, led by Jaren Jackson Jr.’s continued brilliance, and if they can get to Vegas, they’d have a very good chance at lifting the Cup. And if Ja Morant can get healthy and come back in time, absolutely no one will want to see that guy in a one-off. By the time the season is over, the Spurs will likely have filtered out of the Play-In race, but this is the exact kind of team I think should place an overemphasis on the NBA Cup. The Spurs are still building around Victor Wembanyama and figuring out what that should look like, but this team has been fairly competitive early (5-6) and could take advantage of some injury woes for the top teams in their group to try and make a little noise in the Cup. We saw in the Olympics that Wemby loves some heightened competition, and this might be a good chance to turn him loose and make an all-out push for something in November, understanding that they probably don’t have the roster just yet to really threaten the playoffs.  Will the Cavs ever lose? At some point, yes, but why not keep the good vibes rolling as long as possible and try to win the Cup? Yes, they’re a title contender, but unlike, say, Boston, this isn’t a team that’s had any real playoff success. Building some good habits in the knockout rounds could pay dividends down the road, and seeing as how they’re in the same group as the Celtics, I’m sure they’d love to use this as a statement of intent in the event they cross paths in the postseason. The Bucks desperately need something to turn around their season, and maybe the Cup gives them a carrot to chase that can wake things up. I’m skeptical they have the juice to make this happen, as the vibes are just horrendous in Milwaukee right now, but theoretically, Giannis and Dame (who will miss their opener with a concussion) are good enough as a tandem to beat anyone. That will require them to get on the same page, which hasn’t really happened to this point, but perhaps playing on different courts can change the mojo in Milwaukee.  Like every team other than the Cavs and Celtics in the East, the Knicks are off to a sputtering start at 4-5. Their star-studded roster isn’t clicking just yet, the defense has taken a major step back, and the offense hasn’t been quite good enough to make up for it. Their group, at one point, looked like the toughest in the East, but the Magic are without Paolo Banchero and the Sixers … well, we’ll get to them in a second. That cracks the door for the Knicks to try and lay a foundation of winning they can build on as the season progresses and create that chemistry that’s been lacking in games with a slightly bigger game feel. Joel Embiid is back for the Cup games, but Tyrese Maxey is out and Paul George has been on a minutes restriction. This team is desperate to go on a run, and with the big fella back, there’s no time like the present to try and climb out of the East’s basement. Like the Bucks, Philly just needs to stack some wins and get some positivity, and if they can somehow make it to Vegas, they can erase a decent amount of the early season concern about them."

	Barrett did a literal double-take and couldn't stop from blurting out ""Game of Thrones!""","There is no team that has more celebrities attend their games than the Lakers (the Knicks being a close second), as the courtside seats at L.A. games often go a few rows deep with stars from the world of entertainment. There are the regulars like Jack Nicholson and Denzel Washington, but on any given night you might find an actor from your favorite TV show or movie watching the Lakers play.  That happened to Toronto wing RJ Barrett on Sunday night as the Raptors made their annual trek to Los Angeles. After finishing through contact for an and-1, Barrett turned to the crowd in the corner to celebrate only to find himself face-to-face with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, best known for playing Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones. Barrett realized this mid-celebration and did a literal double take, turned back to Coster-Waldau, pointed, and blurted out “Game of Thrones!” at him before turning around and walking to the free throw line.   A post shared by Dime (@dimemagazine)  It’s a very funny thing to happen in the middle of an NBA game, but also, that’s exactly how I would react if I turned around and was suddenly face-to-face with the guy that played Jaime Lannister. I feel like this is far from the first time someone has pointed at Coster-Waldau and just yelled “Game of Thrones!” at him, as that is by far the role he’s best known for."

	We caught up with Liv Morgan after she made history as the first Women's Crown Jewel Champion.","Before kicking off the Liv Morgan World Tour, and before becoming the first Women’s Crown Jewel Champion, the current Women’s World Champion sat at home nursing a dislocated shoulder. As Liv Morgan recovered for six months throughout 2023, she says she had a moment of clarity.  Over the first decade of her career, she’d allowed her ring work to speak for itself. During her time away, Morgan took a step back and felt like she had lacked a true voice or character. As she plotted her return to the ring, she created the Liv Morgan Revenge Tour built around the realities of her injury, while envisioning a path back to the top of the WWE mountain.  “The Liv Morgan Revenge Tour,” Morgan tells Uproxx Sports, “gave me such a purpose.” Some of the best stories in professional wrestling have been at least somewhat based in reality, and the way Morgan was injured gave her a motive, direction, and something so personal and true, that it allowed her for the first time in her career to really sink her teeth into a story. “Rhea (Ripley) really did dislocate my shoulder,” Morgan says. “I really sat home for six months watching her ascend to the top of the division. And so it was all really personal to me, and I used all that to come back and do exactly to her what she did to me. But I did that and more.” While she’s navigated trying to find her character throughout a decade in WWE, elements of who Morgan is as a person have helped her continue to chip away at this dream. Her drive, passion, wanting to learn as much as she can, and desire to give herself an opportunity to see what she could achieve has brought her this far.  “(My time away) just gave me the time and space that I needed to really settle into my own, which brought out the best version of Liv Morgan than we’ve seen thus far,” Morgan says.  The last seven months have been a whirlwind for Morgan. She kicked off the Raw after WrestleMania 40 with a beatdown of Ripley that would alter the trajectory of her career. A legitimate shoulder injury suffered in the melee forced Ripley to relinquish the title and led to Morgan beating Becky Lynch for the belt. That win kickstarted the pivotal run of her career, with new twists and turns added by the month.  “I like to believe that everything happens for a reason. Even if you don’t know the reason, I know that’s so cliche, but I really live my life by that. And so even when things happen that I feel are bizarre or even unfortunate things, I always tend to think that on the other side of it, it is going to be for a greater purpose,” Morgan says.  “There’s so much beauty in the madness and it’s cool to be able to pivot and adjust when things aren’t going the way we anticipated it, because we took something that was supposed to be great and we made it even greater. And so I just think that the stars are aligned and everything is happening exactly as it should.” Morgan has embraced the “crazy, messy love triangle” that’s followed her dynamic with Dominik Mysterio and Ripley, “whether they love to hate us or hate to love us.” Mysterio switched allegiances, Morgan joined the Judgement Day while Ripley was ousted, Raquel Rodriguez returned to join her side, and Ripley recently suffered another injury that will sideline her for the foreseeable future. Paired alongside Mysterio and thus far able to hold off Ripley, Morgan isn’t just matching the status quo for a world champion — she’s literally doing things that haven’t been done before.  The latest in her evolution from charting a Revenge Tour to creating a Liv Morgan World Tour came with a championship-worthy diamond ring, after claiming the first-ever Women’s Crown Jewel Championship in a win over Nia Jax last week.  “It means so much to me on so many different levels,” Morgan continues. “We’ve made history in Saudi Arabia. We had the very first women’s title match for the Women’s Crown Jewel Championship. And that is so much progress. I feel like since I’ve started in WWE, all I’ve wanted to do is really carve my own path and see how great I could become. And the fact that I’ve made history and the first and only Women’s Crown Jewel Champion, I am just so proud and so honored. And I just hope that I do it justice.” The opportunities are endless for where Morgan goes from here. She’s open to the idea of a second Evolution all-women’s wrestling show, with a loaded roster across Raw, Smackdown, and NXT.  “I don’t think we need our own show to be more prestigious,” Morgan says. “I think we are prestigious and I think people tune in specifically for the women’s segments and for women’s wrestling. But to give the fans what they want is why I would love to have another all women’s show in Evolution part 2.” A WrestleMania main event is something that’s eluded Morgan across her career, but calls it the pinnacle of wrestling in WWE and is without a doubt an accomplishment she’d love to check off her bucket list. “You can’t get any bigger, higher, better, more prestigious than main eventing WrestleMania,” Morgan says. “I spend a lot of my life dreaming and hoping and wishing. And I’ve been fortunate and lucky and blessed enough to have a lot of those things come true. So yes, main eventing WrestleMania is definitely on my list. With whom, I don’t know what that looks like or what it is but I hope that we can find out together.” Morgan can accomplish just about anything because at this very moment she genuinely has the faith and belief that she can. As she continues to build upon her second world title run, the Liv Morgan we see onscreen every week couldn’t be any more different than the one that was Smackdown Champion two years ago.  “It’s just a different Liv Morgan. The Liv Morgan that won the SmackDown Championship from Ronda Rousey, that girl she was just happy to be there. She maybe didn’t even see herself or believe in herself as a champion yet. She was a girl with just a pipe dream, cash in her briefcase at the right moment in the right time,” Morgan says. “This Liv Morgan is the most confident version of herself so far. This Liv Morgan knows her worth. This Liv Morgan knows she’s the greatest women’s champion of all time. This Liv Morgan knows she’s untouchable. This Liv Morgan knows she has the most dominant faction in all of WWE by her side. That’s the difference.”"

	Holmgren fell hard on his right hip after contesting a shot and had to be helped off the floor without putting weight on his right leg.","The Oklahoma City Thunder entered Sunday tied with the Suns for the top spot in the Western Conference, and figured to face a stiff test with the red-hot Golden State Warriors in town. OKC got off to a strong start, taking a 33-26 lead after the first quarter, but there was some considerable concern about their star big man as Chet Holmgren had to be helped off the floor and into the locker room after landing hard on his right hip after contesting an Andrew Wiggins layup attempt at the rim (watch here).  Holmgren slams down onto the hardwood and immediately grabbed at his right hip in pain. He was ultimately helped off the floor and into the tunnel without putting any weight on his right leg by a pair of Thunder staffers. Holmgren has gotten off to a tremendous start to his sophomore campaign, averaging 18.2 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.9 blocks per game coming into Sunday’s contest, asserting himself as a serious threat for DPOY with his work protecting the rim for the league’s best defense so far.  The Thunder will hope Holmgren’s injury was just a painful fall and not something more serious that could lead to an extended absence, as they are already incredibly thin at the center position with Isaiah Hartenstein still out with a fractured hand.  UPDATE: Holmgren was ruled out for the game with what the Thunder officially called a right hip injury. Shams Charania reported later Monday night that Holmgren would miss 8-10 weeks with a hip fracture."

	Giannis played a little prank on Jaylen Brown after catching him with an elbow, but the Celtics star wasn't a big fan of Giannis' antics.","The Milwaukee Bucks and Boston Celtics have had two very different starts to the season, as the defending champs have picked up where they left off with another strong beginning to their repeat bid, while the Bucks have been one of the NBA’s worst teams despite having a healthy Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo.  It has not been the kind of start Milwaukee envisioned, and they were hoping to kickstart a turnaround on Sunday when they played host to the Celtics with a chance to alleviate some of the panic about the team’s start by beating one of the league’s best. As they’ve done on a few occasions this season, the Bucks came out hot, scoring 40 in the first quarter to take a double-digit lead, but couldn’t maintain that offensive output, scoring just 38 in the entire second half to see the Celtics pull ahead and pull away for a 113-107 win.  During the game, Giannis and Jaylen Brown had an interesting exchange, as Antetokounmpo elbowed Brown in the head on a post move and then hit Brown with a fake handshake as they went back down the court, which Brown didn’t seem to appreciate.   A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston)  After the game, Brown gave some brief, but unfiltered thoughts on the exchange. “Giannis is a child,” Brown dead-panned. “I’m just focused on helping my team get a win, and that’s what we did tonight.”  Giannis certainly wasn’t the chief culprit for the Bucks struggles on Sunday, as he had 43 points and 13 rebounds, but this kind of silly exchange doesn’t quite land as well with fans when the team is falling to 2-8 on the season, with the only team worse than them in the East being the Embiid-less Sixers."

	The Chiefs moved to 9-0 after blocking a 35-yard kick by Denver with one second left that would've won the game.","The Kansas City Chiefs entered Sunday as the NFL’s last remaining undefeated team at 8-0, and were heavy favorites to move to 9-0 at home against their divisional rival from Denver. However, the Chiefs offense, which has been sluggish at times this season, could not finish off drives with touchdowns and allowed the Broncos to hang around all game.  On Sunday, it looked like that would finally catch up to them and result in a loss, as the Broncos moved the ball inside the Chiefs 20 on their final drive of the game, trailing 16-14, setting up a 35-yard field goal attempt for the win by Wil Lutz. However, the Chiefs special teams unit still had at least one more miracle in them, as George Karlaftis, Leo Chenal, and company caved in the left side of the Broncos field goal unit and blocked the kick to preserve the 16-14 win.  A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  It’s an insane way for the Chiefs to win that game, as they were completely unable to run the ball (19 carries for 57 yards, 19 yards coming from Patrick Mahomes scrambling), missed a number of big play opportunities and had to settle for field goals, and gave up a critical late game drive deep into their own territory. And yet, they move on to Week 11 at 9-0 on the season with a schedule that isn’t the most difficult if they can get past a road trip to Buffalo next week — although, as Sunday proved, division games can always get weird."
Sports – UPROXX,The Bucks Have ‘Called The Whole League’ Trying To Find A Trade After Their Awful Start,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/milwaukee-bucks-trade-rumors-called-whole-league/,"Fri, 08 Nov 2024 22:30:53 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	The Bucks are trying to find a roster upgrade, but with their cap situation, they're finding it nearly impossible despite their best effort.","The Milwaukee Bucks came into the 2024-25 season hopeful that having both Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo fully healthy and coming off a full training camp together would vault them back into being a threat in the Eastern Conference. Instead, the Bucks are 2-6 with their only wins over the tanking Jazz and the Sixers on opening night — who were without Joel Embiid and Paul George and have also looked awful to start the season.  It’s been rough on both sides of the ball for the Bucks, as they are in the bottom half of the league in both offensive and defensive rating through the first few weeks of the season, and while things should improve if and when Khris Middleton can get back healthy for an extended period of time, it’s also pretty clear this roster has some flaws in need of fixing. The problem for the Bucks is, as a second apron team, making a trade is extremely difficult, as they’ve found out the hard way recently.  On Friday’s episode of NBA Today, Brian Windhorst said the Bucks have “called pretty much the whole league” trying to find a trade that could improve their roster, but have run into the same issues with just about everyone.  “The Bucks are doing something that we don’t see very often, which is scouring the trade market in the first week of November,” Windhorst said. “As I was talking to teams this week, they were like, ‘The Bucks just called. The Bucks just called.’ I think the Bucks right now are just kind of searching and trying to cover their bases. And by the way, Giannis is not on the table, Dame is not on the table, they’re looking to try and (find) help for some of their wing play — Khris Middleton’s absence has been extended.  “I talked to one team who said, ‘Yeah, we talked to the Bucks. We came up with two or three different scenarios and realized we’re not allowed to make any of those trades.’ The Bucks are hemmed in as a second-apron team with the new rules. They can’t aggregate players together, they can’t put like two or three players together in a trade. They can’t do a trade where they bring in more money. They have traded away the next six first round picks, either the picks or the swaps, they have traded away the next six second round picks. They are $75 million in the luxury tax. I don’t think help is on the way through the trade market. But they are making calls, which is interesting because from what I can tell, they called pretty much the whole league.” The two players the Bucks were reported to be shopping over the summer (and even last trade deadline) were Bobby Portis and Pat Connaughton, but as Windhorst notes, being unable to aggregate those salaries together means they have to find a player to trade for that matches salary exactly or makes just a little less than either of those two. Given Portis makes just over $12.5 million and Connaughton makes just under $9.5 million, that’s a tough thing to do if the goal is to add a strong contributor for a contender. As such, Windy doesn’t expect them to find a miraculous deal out there, and it sounds like, despite the front office’s best efforts in working the phones, it’s going to come down to this roster to turn things around in Milwaukee."

	Come get these winners.","More than half of the 2024 NFL regular season is over. That reality is painful for those enjoy consuming every aspect of professional football and, in this space, things haven’t gone particularly well. In fact, it was largely a disaster for the first seven weeks but, after back-to-back winning performances, optimism is beginning to creep in.  Would it have been better if the Cleveland Browns or Green Bay Packers could’ve taken care of business last week? Certainly. But here we are after a 3-2 showing. Before handing out this week’s selections, let’s take stock as we dig out of the hole.  Come get these winners. I am actually quite high on the Bills dating back to the summer, but I can’t get them to -4 here. Buffalo is riding high with a four-game winning streak, which helps to explain the number, and Indianapolis has flopped with two straight losses. Still, Joe Flacco and company shouldn’t be getting a full four at home, and we have to take the candy. This is just a principle play. We’re taking advantage of a Wong teaser here, sending Pittsburgh through a pair of key numbers and doing the same with Kansas City. The Steelers have been a wagon as an underdog under Mike Tomlin. The Chiefs will eventually lose (I think) but it won’t be here.  As noted a week ago, this credit goes to UPROXX editor Robby Kalland, but NFC South overs are unbeaten this season. Perhaps that will come to an end here, but Atlanta’s offense can put up points in bunches and its defense is capable of letting the Saints hang around. Let’s go touchdowns. I have to admit that I hate this. I know my editors will hate this. But Los Angeles is laying more than a touchdown with a total in the 30’s? It isn’t as if the Chargers have a real home-field advantage either. I’m holding my nose as I type this, but I simply must. New York has been a sharp side all week, and that makes sense. I couldn’t quite give out the Jets in an awesome spot last week, but I think this is a sell-high spot on Arizona after their blowout win over Chicago. Take me there, Aaron Rodgers."

Earlier this month, fans of Kelce’s holiday project with his former Philadelphia Eagles teammates Lane Johnson and Jordan Mailata heard the first track off of their upcoming album A Philly Special Christmas Party, which featured Kelce teaming up with his brother, Travis Kelce, and Boyz II Men on the track “It’s Christmas Time (In Cleveland Heights).” Kelce collaborated with another legendary artist for the latest track off of the upcoming release, as he recorded a duet with Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks. The track, a cover of Ron Sexsmith’s “Maybe This Christmas,” got teased on the project’s Instagram account over the last week and on the latest edition of the Kelce brothers’ podcast, and was officially unveiled on Friday.  A post shared by A Philly Special Christmas (@aphillyspecialchristmas)  “There are no words to describe how incredible it is to have Stevie Nicks on this record,” executive producer Conner Barwin said in a statement given to Rolling Stone. “There is so much emotion in this song, and it was thrilling to be with them in the studio and watch her and Jason connect, be creative together, and witness this beautiful song become a reality.” A Philly Special Christmas Party will come out on Nov. 22, 2024, but if you’d like to listen to the new track, you can do that right here."

	NBA players have been appearing in music videos for years, and today, we highlighted some of the best cameos.","NBA players and musical artists have always been close with one another. One frequent way that we’ve seen that over the years is music videos, as NBA players have frequently made cameos in them, whether they’re just showing their face for a moment or they’re a main character in the story that an artist is trying to tell. Today, we wanted to highlight some of our favorite appearances that NBA players have made in music videos over the years. Players from a number of different eras — and songs from a number of different genres — made it on the list, but all of them feature artists making it a point to get some of the biggest names in basketball into their videos. This wasn’t the only time Kobe linked up with Destiny’s Child — he recorded a verse on a remix of their track “Say My Name.” He does have a cameo in the video for “Bug-a-Boo,” though, as Destiny’s Child — which is trying to get away from a group that is bugging them — dips into a locker room. While going through there, they come across Bryant, who is sitting there and getting ready to play basketball. MJ and MJ just had to appear in a music video together at some point, no? The two appear on a basketball court and shoot hoops with one another, and at one point, Michael (Jackson) teaches Michael (Jordan) some dance moves. These might have been the two most famous people in the world when this video came out in 1992, and it’s a pretty remarkable cultural artifact. The newest release on this list, DeRozan was one of the many celebrities who made a cameo in Lamar’s summer anthem that doubled as the high point of his feud with Drake from earlier this year. It turns out DeRozan has known Lamar for quite some time, and while he said he still has love for Drake despite appearing in this video, well, it sure seems like there might be some tension here. Shaq, as we’ve laid out before, has been in a ton of music videos over the years. His first was the iconic “Make ‘Em Say Uhh!” video, where he sits courtside and looks like he’s having the time of his life as Master P and co. put on a show on the hardwood. One of the biggest music videos of all time — it’s a little more than 14 and a half minutes long, and is absolutely jam packed with some of the biggest names in sports and entertainment at that time. Names like Deion Sanders, Rickey Henderson, and Wayne Gretzky make cameos, while the NBA is well-represented with two members of the Dream Team and, uh, a third player who was almost on the Dream Team. Easily the most … unique video on this list. It features Jimmy Butler dressed up in what I can only describe as an emo cowboy costume and really committing fully to the bit. (The bit, of course, is “Jimmy Butler dressing like this in a Fall Out Boy video.”) There is no one in the NBA quite like Jimmy, and this video is a pretty good example of why that is the case."

	Travis Kelce caught a stray on 'Jeopardy!.'","Travis Kelce has long been one of the NFL’s most visible stars, but recently, he has achieved a new level of widespread cultural notoriety thanks to his relationship with Taylor Swift. Jeopardy! made a nod to that during the November 6 episode. In the episode’s opening round (per J! Archive), the $200 clue in the “The TV Show In Question” category read, “Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity? is hosted by this man who’s maybe more famous as a BF than as a 3-time Super Bowl champ.” Contestant Derek Hieronymus correctly responded with Kelce. Here’s a video of the moment. This came shortly after Jeopardy! found itself in a bit of hot water. As USA Today notes, Heather Ryan, a contestant on the October 28 episode, recently spoke out about a clue that read, “Men seldom make passes at…,” with the correct response being, “Girls who wear glasses.” She said, “It is definitely an odd choice. I think it made everybody in the audience and on stage — and Ken Jennings, too — a little uncomfortable. It was like, ‘Oh, that was unexpected.’ Maybe we choose better rhyming phrases in 2024. […] Unfortunately, there are still girls who are (in) middle school, and they don’t want to wear their glasses and they’re losing out on their education.

	Vivek Ranadive has unsurprisingly taken DeMar DeRozan's side in his simmering feud with Drake.","The Toronto Raptors traveled to Sacramento to take on the Kings on Wednesday night in a game that has suddenly given us a little spiciness off the court. Sacramento went to Toronto on the night of Vince Carter’s jersey retirement ceremony last week, which was the first time that DeMar DeRozan played in front of Drake since he appeared in the music video for Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us.” While DeRozan, in the immediate aftermath, said he has tons of love for Drake despite his cameo in the video, Drake expressed that he doesn’t want to see DeRozan get his number retired in Toronto when his career comes to an end, and DeRozan seemed to have a lot of fun responding. And on Wednesday with Drake’s beloved Raptors in town, Kings owner Vivek Ranadive decided to show some support to his star forward by wearing a shirt with the words “THEY NOT LIKE US” on it.  A post shared by SLAM (@slam)  The Kings picked up a 122-107 win on Wednesday to move and 5-3 on the season. All five starters scored in double-figures for Sacramento, with DeRozan leading the way with 27 points on 11-for-21 shooting. It is unclear if he was motivated by the fact that the team’s owner showed up and wore a shirt that trolled Drake, but I’m sure at least part of him appreciated it."

	Windhorst thinks the Warriors have an ""itchy trigger finger"" when it comes to trade talks and chasing another star.","The Golden State Warriors picked up a big early season win on Wednesday night when they defeated the Boston Celtics to improve to 7-1 on the young season and offer an early confirmation point that their hot start is the real deal after beating a number of teams in the middle and bottom of the standings.  The Warriors’ depth has been showcased during their hot start, but this is a team that was very active on the trade market this summer trying to land another star-level player to fit between Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. Paul George and Lauri Markkanen were well known pursuits of the Warriors, and their hot start may only further embolden the front office to go star-chasing during the season.  As Brian Windhorst laid out on Thursday’s First Take, the Warriors are the team he most expects to make a splash trade this season, as they have the contracts, young players, and draft assets to make a competitive offer for just about anyone.  ""The Warriors are the biggest candidate in my mind to make a big trade. They tried to trade for LeBron James last trade deadline… This is a team that's got an itchy trigger finger trying to make a big deal."" – Brian Windhorst 👀pic.twitter.com/0wYql9bYW4 — ClutchPoints (@ClutchPoints) November 7, 2024  Windhorst notes this front office seems to have an “itchy trigger finger” when it comes to trade talks, noting their efforts at landing another star date back to last deadline when they called the Lakers about LeBron. While a move isn’t imminent and they’ll likely ride this wave of positivity for awhile, by the time 2025 arrives and trade season kicks into full gear, they should be seen as a top threat for any star that comes available. We know the likes of Brandon Ingram and Zach LaVine are still available, but that was the case this summer and the Warriors seemed to balk at making a move for either of those two players. Instead, it seems Golden State is keen to wait to see if someone else comes available they could make a run at, but Windy, at the very least, would be very surprised if this Warriors roster looks the same by mid-February when San Francisco is hosting the All-Star Game."

	We caught up with Mercedes Moné to discuss her return from injury, regaining confidence, and how she's blazing a trail for the AEW women.","The last year has been a whirlwind for Mercedes Moné, and more than six months into her AEW tenure, there’s plenty to be grateful for.  What was once considered a career-ending ankle injury could have sidelined Moné for good, she refused to accept the possibility of her childhood dream being over, instead choosing optimism, and willing herself back into the ring. “It’s really just leading with gratitude, thankful to be a part of this wrestling community still,” Moné tells Uproxx Sports. “The last year was the craziest year of my whole life, not knowing where I was going to be in wrestling, but leading with gratitude and staying positive.” Moné landed in AEW in March, carrying the same mindset she’s had throughout her career as she’s trail blazed a new path for women’s wrestling.  “(I knew) where I wanted to be and what I want to leave in professional wrestling, to take this women’s division to whole new heights all over the world,” Moné says. “I wanted to have more for women’s wrestling, so I knew going to AEW was the place to be to make that happen. I feel like the women’s division has really changed the game. The women’s division has been the best it’s ever been. The women’s storylines are headlining AEW pay-per-views. So it’s just been amazing to come this far and I’m really excited for more.” For most athletes, an injury the severity of Moné’s typically requires at least two years to be back at full strength. She says she feels amazing being back in the ring and admits the toughest part of this journey is in the past.  “For me, it was just mentally going into the ring and training and being like, okay, I don’t want to be scared of climbing the top rope. I don’t want to be scared of jumping off the top rope. I don’t even want to be scared of running, because due to my injury, I couldn’t walk for over three months,” Moné says. “So just telling myself that I still got this. I got to train with Tyler Breeze for three months preparing myself for my AEW debut. And it was just getting my confidence back in the ring. That’s what really took some time. But now I’m feeling better than ever, and here I am as two belts Moné, so I’m feeling great.” After returning to the ring in May, Moné was quick to find gold around her waist. She defeated Willow Nightingale to earn the TBS title before claiming the NJPW STRONG Women’s championship just a month later. After sitting in the stands at All In at Wembley Stadium last year, Moné battled Britt Baker in London this year. She’s continued to find her footing in matches against Hikaru Shida, Emi Sakura, and most recently, Queen Aminata.  Moné isn’t just talking the talk, she’s leading the AEW women’s division to new heights and opening doors to elevate talent across the roster.  “I was born to be the best. I was born to have this purpose of leading a charge of making sure that women’s wrestling is known and respected and it deserves the respect that it’s given,” Moné says. “So just leaning on the standard that I put for myself, I’m here to be the best, to show the world that I’m the best, and I’m here to bring the women along with me. So that’s the goal.” While she has her eyes firmly on her next challenger for the TBS championship, Kris Statlander at the Full Gear pay-per-view on November 23, Moné isn’t stopping at defending the belts already in her possession. Mariah May told me ahead of All In earlier this year that she’s interested in mixing it up down the line with Moné, a dream opponent for the talented AEW Women’s champion. When — and if — that match happens remains to be seen.  Moné is never one to shy away from a challenge and says she’s “coming for all the titles” in AEW, while offering praise for one of the promotion’s brightest young talents. “I am super proud to watch from afar. She came in as a super fan, just loving wrestling, loved it so much that she moved from England to Japan, trained out in Stardom just to hone her craft, and now she’s here,” Moné says.   “She is our women’s world champion, beating Toni Storm in one of the best storylines in women’s history. So to see her rise this fast and to see how good she is in the ring, it’s so incredible. Like I said, we have the best women’s division in the game right now. And I’m definitely looking at the title that she has around her waist.”"

It was the first time that Morant got to play L.A. at home since the two teams went head-to-head in a tense playoff series back in 2023 — Los Angeles won in six games — and Morant sure did play like he still has that postseason failure on his mind. In the 131-114 Grizzlies win, Morant tied for the team high with 20 points, along with five assists, four rebounds, a steal, and a block. At one point, he scored over Gabe Vincent and hit him with a too small … only for LeBron James to come back on the very next possession and get him right back.  Ja Morant gave a ""too small"" to Gabe Vincent, and then LeBron gave it right back to Ja 😅pic.twitter.com/0N3OnwlMu1 — Dime (@DimeUPROXX) November 7, 2024  After the game, Morant spoke to the media, and after saying that James’ too small was done “respectfully,” he expressed that he really does not like the Lakers. “I don’t like ’em,” Morant told the press. “They knocked me out the playoffs … they beat us last time, I didn’t get to play, like I said, last year. They came on our home floor, beat us on our home floor, was laughin’, playin’, lookin’ at me, talkin’. My message was, I was in street clothes. This is my first opportunity to get back on the floor playing against them.” As for the whole “getting a too small for LeBron” thing, well, Morant took to Twitter after the win and addressed that."

	JJ Redick was blunt when asked why his starting guard got benched in the third quarter of Wednesday's loss to the Grizzlies.","The Los Angeles Lakers fell to the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday night, 131-114, as they attempt to navigate what has been a pretty difficult spate of injuries. One guy who hasn’t been injured, though, is starting guard D’Angelo Russell, although he saw his minutes cut on Wednesday — Russell came out of the game with 5:54 left in the third quarter, did not reenter, and only played 21:33 on the evening. New Lakers coach JJ Redick decided to close the game with Gabe Vincent on the floor, and after the game, he was asked why he kept Russell on the bench. As he explained, part of it was just wanted to see what Vincent gave him, but with Russell, there were some things that he did not like to see. “Level of compete, attention to detail, some of the things we’ve talked with him about for a couple weeks and, at times, he’s been really good with that stuff, and other times, it’s just reverting back to certain habits,” Redick told the press after the game at the 3:05 mark of the above video. “Wasn’t like a punishment, just felt like for us to have a chance to win this game, that was the route we wanted to take. Gabe, in the first half, especially defensively, was fantastic, and I just wanted to see what that looked like.” Russell went 4-for-12 from the field for 12 points, three assists, and two steals before his evening came to an end."

	Miller had 19 points on the night, with his biggest bucket coming as the clock hit zero.","The Charlotte Hornets are built around a young and exciting 1-2 punch in LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller. On Wednesday night, both of the franchise’s pillars needed to come up big in order for Charlotte to pick up a 108-107 win over the Detroit Pistons, with Miller, in particular, playing the hero in the waning moments of the game. After a turnover by Miller, the Pistons went the other way and got a layup from rookie forward Ron Holland to take a 1-point lead. On the ensuing possession, the Hornets were able to get a good look for Grant Williams, who pulled up from behind the three-point line but was not able to convert. Fortunately for everyone in Charlotte, Miller was able to sneak his way into the lane and clean up the miss. He immediately attempted a layup, which went in and gave the Hornets their third win of the season.  A post shared by SportsCenter (@sportscenter)  It wasn’t the most productive night for Miller, who had 19 points on 6-for-16 shooting with six rebounds and four assists. But he got the biggest two points of the evening, so it’s safe to say that he had a pretty good evening. As for his star running mate, Ball had 25 points, eight assists, six rebounds, and two steals."

But they are determined to make the mogul proud, one up their rivals, and bring the school’s band program into a new era. Though the reaction to the planned performance is mostly love, Mills has gotten a bit of trepidation from alums worried about “protecting certain traditions.” He’s not deterred though, “This yields an opportunity to say ‘Look, I got it.’” Blaze, on the other hand, couldn’t be more excited about the collab. “I’ve been waiting for this moment all my life, and didn’t even realize it until now.” He’s not the only person thoroughly anticipating a great performance. Denise Saunders Thompson, Assistant Dean to the Chadwick Boseman College of Fine Arts, takes time out of her busy schedule to meet Mills, Blaze, and the band on the field to complement and encourage their progress. “Were gonna break the internet with this performance,” she tells the group, hoping to manifest this new standard-setting moment with her words.

	Embiid has not played yet this season, but his suspension will not go into effect until after he is eligible to play.","The Philadelphia 76ers will have to wait a little longer for Joel Embiid to play in his first game this season. On Tuesday afternoon, the NBA announced that Embiid received a 3-game suspension following an incident in the locker room on Saturday night where he shoved a member of the media. It is believed that Embiid shoved Marcus Hayes of the Philadelphia Inquirer, who recently published a column criticizing Embiid over not playing this season that referenced his son and late brother, which upset the former NBA MVP. “Mutual respect is paramount to the relationship between players and media in the NBA,” Joe Dumars, the NBA’s Executive Vice President, Head of Basketball Operations said in a statement. “While we understand Joel was offended by the personal nature of the original version of the reporter’s column, interactions must remain professional on both sides and can never turn physical.” Embiid criticized Hayes earlier in the week during a media availability, but he was not in attendance. In its statement, the league announced that Embiid — who has been working his way back from a knee issue — will not start serving his suspension until he is eligible and healthy enough to play. The Sixers have gotten off to a slow start this season without Embiid, as the team is 1-5. Their high-profile offseason addition, Paul George, only just made his regular season debut on Monday night against the Phoenix Suns after getting hurt in the preseason."

	Lou Williams wasn't a fan of what Drake said about DeMar DeRozan on the night the Raptors retired Vince Carter's jersey.","The Toronto Raptors retired Vince Carter’s jersey last week, the highest honor the team can give to one of the most iconic players in franchise history. The game happened against the Sacramento Kings, which are the current team of someone else who will probably get his jersey retired by the Raptors some day, DeMar DeRozan. While the night was all about Carter, there was some tension between DeRozan and noted Raptors fan Drake, which presumably all revolves around DeRozan appearing in the music video for Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us.” The whole ordeal rubbed former Toronto player Lou Williams the wrong way, which he expressed on FanDuel’s “Run It Back.” “If I’m gonna speak candidly, I thought that was selfish of Drake,” Williams said. “Drake, as well as the country of Canada, the city of Toronto, they know what DeMar DeRozan has contributed to the culture up there, and what he’s contributed to the Toronto Raptors, and to that community. It goes way bigger than his personal relationship with Drake, it goes way bigger than his personal relationship with Kendrick Lamar. So for Drake to say, ‘If you put up a banner and I’ll personally pull it down,’ it’s like, is it just about you or is it about the Toronto Raptors?” Drake expressed during the game that if the Raptors put up a DeRozan banner, “I’ll go up there and pull it down myself.” DeRozan was asked to respond to this after the game and told the press that “He gonna have a long way to climb to take it down. So, tell him good luck.” The following day, DeRozan posted a clip from Friday to his Instagram Story, and it’s not hard to read between the lines that he was talking about Drake."

	Caitlin Clark is excited to play for an Indiana legend, and saw how she had the Sun prepared and thinks that'll make the Fever better.","More than half of the WNBA is changing coaches this offseason, as seven of the league’s 13 teams parted ways with their head coach from the 2024 season — and the Golden State Valkyries are entering the league with a new coach as an expansion franchise. Among the teams that fired their coach after the season was the Indiana Fever, as they let Christie Sides go after guiding Indiana to a second-half push that saw them nab a playoff berth before a first round loss.  The Fever figured to be a highly coveted job as it provides an opportunity to coach the last two Rookie of the Year winners in Caitlin Clark and Aliyah Boston. On Monday, the team officially introduced Stephanie White as their head coach, after White parted ways with the Connecticut Sun to return home to Indiana to take the Fever job for the second time in her career. This time, White takes over a roster that has a ton of talent, and in her intro presser she stated her belief that Clark and Boston can be the best guard-big tandem the WNBA has ever seen.  Those two were at White’s introductory presser, and spoke with ESPN’s Michael Voepel about their excitement to play for White, with Clark explaining that the detailed approach the Sun always had in facing the Fever makes her believe White can help them improve some of their weaknesses quickly.  “We know how much of a legend she is in Indiana,” Clark said Monday. “I think that’s really cool. Playing against her, I would say I felt like her teams always had the best scouts against us. I think that just speaks to her knowledge of the game and her way to analyze, and she clearly was on to something. Hopefully, in turn, now that she knows how to stop us, that should be a good way to know how to [help us] beat certain things as well.” Boston added, “There’s nothing better than playing for a coach that you can already tell she’s going to pour into us. She knows the talent that we have and I’m super-excited to get out on the court. You can feel the intensity already.” White will have the next six months to self-scout the Fever and identify the areas they can improve for 2025, as the expectations will only get bigger for Indiana. At the very least, White believes her young star duo is only scratching the surface and if Clark and Boston can level up in 2025 together, Indiana will have a chance to be a real threat to the WNBA’s top-4."

	Ja Morant hit a wild 360 layup against the Nets and decided to do it again later just for fun.","With Ja Morant missing almost all of last season due to suspension and injury (playing just 9 games), he found himself a bit outside the conversation for top point guards in the NBA coming into the 2024-25 season. It was a lost season for both Morant and the Grizzlies last year, and both player and team are looking to remind the NBA of their talents early this season.  While it’s been an up-and-down start to the year, Morant has offered reminders of his unique brilliance with highlight reel plays that only he produces right now in the NBA. On Monday night in Brooklyn he offered up a pair of outrageous finishes as he was strong on the B-button with two 360 layups against the Nets. The first came on a drive against Nic Claxton, where Morant jumped in the air and spun all the way across the lane for a silky finish with his left. The second was even more spontaneous, as Morant went up thinking about a poster dunk on Cam Johnson before changing his mind for another spinning lefty layup, changing hands in mid-air.  A post shared by NBA (@nba)   A post shared by NBA México (@nbamex)  It’s a pair of plays that perfectly encapsulate Morant’s singular ability as a high-flying guard. The first is so smooth as he just glides effortlessly through the air, while the second started with him thinking power but he had the time and ability to change his plan (and hands) mid-flight for the finish."

	The former teammates crossed paths in a pretty tense way on Monday night.","The Golden State Warriors traveled to Washington to take on the Wizards on Monday night, which meant that the Warriors crossed paths with an old friend, Jordan Poole. An important part of the team’s last title, Poole was traded to the Wizards last season in the aftermath of a tumultuous year with the Dubs. During Monday night’s game, the player responsibility for all that turmoil crossed paths with Poole once again, as the high-scoring guard had a run-in with Draymond Green. Poole knocked down a triple in the waning moments of the second quarter as Green attempted to contest his shot, and after it went in, he pointed right at Green. On the ensuing Warriors possession before the half, Steph Curry knocked down a three — Poole tried to contest it, he was unsuccessful, and Green immediately pointed right at him.   A post shared by SportsCenter (@sportscenter)  During training camp ahead of the 2022-23 season, Poole and Green were involved in an altercation during practice that ended with Green punching his then-teammate. Green received a suspension and a fine from the team as a result.

	Kelce said he shouldn't ""greet hate with hate"" and apologized, even though most saw his actions as extremely understandable.","Jason Kelce is more popular on a national scale now than he ever was as an All-Pro center with the Philadelphia Eagles — although, his Super Bowl parade performance cemented his status as a Philly legend. Kelce is on ESPN’s Monday Night Countdown now and has a wildly popular podcast with his brother Travis, as the brothers have seen their stardom leap from the sports world to pop culture in general, due in no small part to Travis’ relationship with Taylor Swift that has brought her legions of fans to them.  While there are the obvious benefits of that popularity in the form of massive media deals, there are also the trappings of fame that come with the territory of being immediately recognizable to most any person. On Saturday, Jason was reminded of that when he was in State College for Ohio State-Penn State and had a heckler call Travis a gay slur for dating Swift while holding his phone out recording. That jackass was seeking a reaction and got one in the form of Jason grabbing his phone and spiking it on the ground, with videos from other nearby going viral immediately.  On Monday night, Kelce addressed the incident at the top of Monday Night Countdown and issued an apology, noting that’s not how he wants to act and that he doesn’t want to “greet hate with hate.” Jason Kelce opens ""Monday Night Countdown"" with an apology. ""I chose to greet hate with hate, and I just don't think that's a productive thing."" pic.twitter.com/9rScqAKpVD — Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) November 4, 2024  The truth is, the majority of people saw him spike the phone and felt that was an extremely reasonable response, as we need to remind people that there are real consequences to saying vile things — something the internet has made far too easy to do with no repercussions. Still, Kelce felt bad enough about it to issue an apology on national television and seemed very genuinely upset by his own actions, even if the majority of people saw them as defensible."

	Stephen A. went on a lengthy rant wondering who is allowed to criticize Kevin Durant.","Kevin Durant and Stephen A. Smith aren’t exactly on the best term, as the Suns star has taken exception to some of Smith’s reporting and pontificating for years. Most recently, Durant expressed his frustration with Smith claiming he isn’t a good leader.  Smith reported this summer that the Suns wanted out of Durant amid rumors the Rockets were pursuing the star in a trade. The Sun’s then denied that publicly and as the 2024-25 season began, Durant was in a Phoenix uniform. Still, Smith continued to prod at the star, calling him out for a lack of vocal leadership and being an aloof star in the locker room. Durant responded on Twitter (as he often does) and then again this weekend when asked about the leadership talk by The Athletic’s Doug Haller.  Durant questioned why anyone listens to Stephen A., calling him “a clown” and calling into question his sources, noting he’s never in practices or the locker room. Unsurprisingly, Smith responded on Monday morning on ‘First Take’ with a lengthy diatribe where he said he wouldn’t respond with the same “kind of pettiness and childishness” and questioned who is allowed to talk about Durant, listing off all the people KD has taken issue with (watch here).  “I got bad news for Kevin Durant, if you’re expecting me to reciprocate with that kind of pettiness and childishness, it’s not gonna happen,” Smith said. “Kevin Durant is one of the greatest players to ever play this game. He’s a future Hall of Famer, he’s a two-time champion, two-time Finals MVP, and I’ve been on the record saying he’s also a good dude. So if he wants to resort to that level, even though we’re both grown men and if he had something to say he knows my number and he refrains from doing so, that’s something he has to live with.  “Having said all of that, respectfully, Kevin Durant can you stop lying, please? I’ve been an NBA reporter and I was a columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer as well. Kevin Durant has seen me in the locker room when he was at Oklahoma City. He has seen me in the locker room when he was at Golden State. He has certainly seen me at games throughout his career. But, unfortunately for him, I don’t have to be at shootaround and I don’t have to be in the postgame locker room. I happen to have a hit show that’s been No. 1 for 12 years, I have other things to do with my time. I go to games all the time. I’m not a beat writer anymore.  “The other thing I would say is this, Kevin Durant is going to have to answer this question: Who is allowed to talk about him? Charles Barkley played this game as a Hall of Famer. He got at Charles Barkley. Shannon Sharpe is a Super Bowl champion and a Hall of Famer. He got at Shannon. He got at players, the CJ McCollums of the world, the Dennis Schroders of the world, and others. He’s gotten at fans, and did it discreetly because he had accounts that didn’t reveal who he was. It’s contemporaries and colleagues, it’s former players, it’s present players, it’s the media, it’s fans, it’s whoever. Is anyone allowed to talk about Kevin Durant? Because I don’t understand it. I don’t get it.” The “he can call me” thing from Stephen A. is always funny to me, because it implies that only he is allowed to talk about people in front of a microphone and if they want to discuss him and his commentary they should do it privately. His final point is probably his strongest, as he notes that Durant has bristled at comments from fellow players, former greats, and all manner of media members and fans. It’s a fair point, and his use of burner accounts in the past has, in particular, left a reputation of Durant having thin skin. That said, at this point, KD happily replies to folks from main, and I think his directness in responding to people — whether it’s Barkley, Smith, or some random Twitter account — breaks down the wall that typically exists in the athlete-critic relationship.  Most athletes either ignore it or internalize it for motivation, but rarely do they so regularly respond and push back on it directly. Athletes love to prove doubters or haters wrong, but they typically throw everyone into one bucket and respond generally. Durant, meanwhile, takes a very different approach by responding directly and asking for critics to elaborate or explain their reasoning further. That tends to throw folks off, including Smith. There is certainly fair criticism to be made about Durant, but I also don’t think it’s unreasonable for him to push back if he doesn’t believe it."

This heartfelt fluttering can also be heard on “One Of Those,” where Ella sings: “Girl you better get you one of these / Wake up in the morning, he got flowers at my feet / Get one of these, yeah, I don’t wanna leave / Dancing ’round him got me like a puppet / I’ma let him pull my strings / Get you one of these / Kinda man that get you what you want, then he gon’ give you want you need / I’m just saying get you one of these.” Continue below to view Ella Mai’s 3 tracklist and cover. 1. “Hearts On Deck”

	Barkley spun to break one tackle and then hurdled a defender while facing the other way in an insane run on Sunday.","Hurdling an opponent is one of the great risk-reward moves a ball-carrier can make, as going airborne to avoid a tackle can lead to a huge play but also can result in a player getting absolutely blasted. Some players are much better at it than others, and Saquon Barkley is among the best in all of football at leaping defenders, going all the way back to his college days at Penn State.  On Sunday, the star running back decided to innovate on his trademark move one one of the greatest 14-yard runs you’ll ever see, where he broke out a spin move into what I can only describe as a reverse hurdle, as he leaped over a defender while facing the opposite direction.  THE 180 HURDLE??? DID SAQUON JUST INVENT THIS?! 📺: #JAXvsPHI on CBS/Paramount+📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/tYThjnbdgG — NFL (@NFL) November 3, 2024  I really don’t know how you pull this off without injuring yourself or fumbling, but Barkley cleared the defender cleanly and landed on his feet — before taking a shot from another defender and needing to check out for a play or two. Tiki Barber in the FOX booth rightfully loses his mind over this move, and I really hope no young running backs look at this and decide they want to replicate it because it would go extremely poorly for anyone without Barkley’s insane athleticism."

	KD called out Stephen A. Smith for being ""a clown"" and isn't sure why people still listen to him.","The Phoenix Suns picked up their fourth straight win on Saturday night in Portland, improving to 5-1 on the young season to remain tied for second in the West with the Warriors, a game back of the NBA’s last remaining undefeated team, Oklahoma City.  It’s the second season for the Suns star trio being all together, and that has, historically, been when those teams take a leap if they ever do. The first year is figuring out how it all should work and learning how not to step on each other’s toes, and then the second year is when we find out if the ceiling really is as high as it appears on paper. For that reason, the strong start to this season is a very good sign for the Suns, even if there’s still a long way to go this season in confirming their status as a top threat in the West.  An additional subplot to this Suns season is that of Kevin Durant’s reputation, as the future Hall of Famer still gets nagged about whether he’s an effective leader, largely because his greatest team success came when he joined the Warriors where it was clearly Stephen Curry’s team. Charles Barkley has prodded at KD pretty consistently, calling him a follower and bus rider, while Stephen A. Smith regularly takes aim at Durant’s leadership as the thing he lacks compared to other top stars of his generation.  Durant and his Suns teammates and coaches have scoffed at that notion, and on Saturday night Durant was again asked the leadership question by Doug Haller of The Athletic and had some pointed words for Stephen A., calling him “a clown.”  “Yeah, Stephen A., I don’t understand how people even listen to Stephen A.,” he told The Athletic. “I’ve been in the league for 18 years. I’ve never seen Stephen A. at a practice, or a film session, or a shoot-around. I’ve never seen him anywhere but on TV talking s— about players. … He’s a clown to me. He’s always been a clown. You can write that, too.” Durant went on to note that he isn’t taking a different approach or trying to be more vocal this year, insisting that he’s going about his business as always. He bristled, in particular, at commentary from the likes of Smith that he is aloof and distant from his teammates, which his Suns teammates push back on as well when asked by Haller. “To say that I’m just sitting here, you paint this picture of me coming into the locker room, not talking to my teammates, quiet, not talking to my coaches,” Durant said. “Like, come on, man. It’s just ridiculous.” Durant is far from the only NBA star who gets frustrated by Smith’s commentary and, particularly, when he offers up sourced reporting despite not being on the ground covering the league on the road regularly. Smith certainly knows a ton of people in and around the league, but players and fans are constantly skeptical of what he says, largely because it often feels his opinion and any reporting get blended together all into one. That makes it tough to separate the two, especially because he can’t help but go over the top with how he presents things. Durant has voiced his annoyance with Smith in the past, but this is some of his firmest criticism that hasn’t been levied on Twitter."

	Drake also hurled insults at DeRozan during the game's broadcast.","You may have moved past Kendrick Lamar’s chart-topping Drake diss, “Not Like Like Us.” But Drake surely hasn’t. After Akademiks dispelled rumors of a reconciliation between Drake and Future, the “First Person Shooter” rapper attempted to flex his star power against another foe.  Yesterday (November 2), Drake attended the Toronto Raptors and the Sacramento Kings game at Scotiabank Arena. Instead of focusing on the friendly matchup, Drake and his longtime friend Nessel “Chubbs” Beezer decided to laser in on former Raptors star DeMar DeRozan (now the the Kings). Throughout the game, Drake could be heard hurling remarks at DeRozan (supposedly including “p*ssy” and “goof“), and it doesn’t seem to be sports related tension.  At one point, Drake and Chubbs (both courtside) can be seen standing up and staring down DeRozan (viewable here). Well, just as viewers at home caught the suspenseful moment, so did DeRozan. Over on Instagram, DeMar DeRozan decided to troll Drake back by posting a video clip from Friday (viewable here).  In the scene, starring Ice Cube (playing Craig) and Chris Tucker (playing Smokey), Tucker’s character attempts to regain tough points after being punked by the neighborhood bully, Deebo (played by the late Tommy Lister). “I got mind control over Deebo,” says Tucker. “He be like shut the f*ck up. I be quiet. But when he leaves I be talking again.” This comes after Drake vowed to “pull down” DeRozan’s number should the Raptors ever decide to retire it after Vincent Carter’s number retirement celebration. DeRozan claimed that he and Drake were “still family” even after he appeared in the “Not Like Us” music video. However, it appears Drake doesn’t feel that same."

	DeRozan, of course, was in Kendrick Lamar's ""Not Like Us"" video, which surely had nothing to do with any of this!","It was a night for celebration in Toronto, as the Raptors retired the iconic number 15 worn by Vince Carter. And to put a cherry on top of what was a joyous evening in the 6, the Raptors were able to pick up a thrilling, 131-128 win over the Sacramento Kings in overtime, thanks to a 31-point outing by RJ Barrett. Playing the Kings meant that another Toronto legend, DeMar DeRozan, was back in town. Drake, unsurprisingly, was also there, which set up a pretty funny back-and-forth. While sitting in the broadcast booth, Drake expressed that he does not want DeRozan to get a banner, saying “If you ever put a DeRozan banner up, I’ll go up there and pull it down myself.” Now, it’s unclear if this is serious or a joke, but it’s worth remembering that DeRozan was in the music video for Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” and appeared on stage at The Pop Out while Lamar performed the song at the height of his feud with Drake earlier this year. And after the game, DeRozan got asked about Drake’s comments and had a simple response before getting up and walking away. “He gonna have a long way to climb to take it down,” DeRozan said. “So, tell him good luck.” It’s worth mentioning that when DeRozan was asked about the Drake-Kendrick feud, he said that “Drake’s still my man, still my man, none of it changed.” We’ll be sure to let you know if all of this tonight was in good fun or if things have changed between these two."

	The incident happened after Philly fell to the Grizzlies on Saturday night to move to 1-4 on the year, with Embiid not playing in the game.","The Philadelphia 76ers fell to 1-4 on the regular season on Saturday night, as the team picked up a 124-107 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. As has been the case every time they’ve taken the floor this year, the Sixers were without the services of Joel Embiid, who is ramping up following an issue the team discovered in his left knee. But despite not taking the floor, Embiid was involved in an incident after the game. According to Keith Pompey of the Philadelphia Inquirer, Embiid “assaulted a reporter in the locker room.” There wasn’t a ton of information in the aftermath, but eventually, Shams Charania of ESPN reported that Embiid got into it with the person who wrote “a recent column that referenced his late brother,” which featured a shove but no punch. Earlier this week, Embiid spoke with the media in Philly and got uncharacteristically fired up, saying “When I see people saying he doesn’t want to play. I’ve done way too much for this city, putting myself at risk for people to be saying that. So, I do think it’s bullsh*t.” In particular, he called out “that dude, he’s not here, Marcus, whatever his name is,” a reference to Pompey’s colleague, Marcus Hayes. Presumably, the reporter Embiid got into it with is Hayes, who wrote a column in October titled “Joel Embiid disrespects the Sixers, the game, its greats, and himself. Shaquille O’Neal and Charles Barkley are right to rip him.” While the piece has since been edited to remove the references to Embiid’s son and late brother, you can read what it originally said here. UPDATE: Kyle Neubeck of PHLY Sports spoke about the altercation on the PHLY Sixers Postgame Show and explained how the altercation came about, with Embiid telling Hayes not to mention his family, before the two went back and forth for nearly two minutes with Embiid eventually shoving Hayes. Per Neubeck, Sixers security staff and players stepped in quickly."

	Goldberg announced he'll have one last match in 2025.","Goldberg is finally going to get his sendoff match in the WWE, he announced on Saturday morning ahead of Georgia-Florida. 🚨 BREAKING: @Goldberg just announced that his retirement match will take place NEXT YEAR! 👀 🎥: @SECNetwork pic.twitter.com/e5KtwfOGnY — WWE (@WWE) November 2, 2024  Goldberg’s return to the WWE comes after he was confronted by World Heavyweight Champion, Gunther, at last month’s Bad Blood live event. Gunther downplayed Goldberg’s wrestling ability, then told his son he hopes he was a better father than he was a wrestler. This caused Goldberg to jump the barricade and go after Gunther before security intervened. While Sami Zayn successfully attacked the champ, Goldberg made his way into the ring and told the camera, “You’re next.” During the Bad Blood press conference, we asked Triple H about the possibility of seeing Goldberg wrestling another match in WWE, after the former world champion has been quite vocal about his desire to have a retirement match. “Atlanta loves Bill Goldberg, and that’s why he was here tonight. He was with his wife and his son, always going to get a huge reaction here enjoying the show,” Triple H said at the time. “Things get said. I can tell you when Bill came back, he was not too happy with Gunther and we’ll see. The further you go, time catches up with all of us. The further you go, the talks get further and further away from reality. But I don’t know, I saw Bill earlier in the day and it was great. And I saw Bill later in the day, and there was a different look on his face and a spark in his eye. So I would say never say never.” Goldberg last wrestled at the Elimination Chamber in 2022 against Roman Reigns. There’s no current word on the time, date, or location of Goldberg’s final match. It will, however, seemingly coincide with John Cena’s retirement tour."

Today (November 2), one person learned this lesson the hard way. In a now viral video, Jason Kelce came face-to-face with a troll. Given that the former Super Bowl champion announced his retirement in March, the hate wasn’t exactly aimed at him. Outside of the Ohio State Buckeyes and Penn State Nittany Lions’ game, Jason was surrounded by fans. As many hoped to snag a selfie with the former professional footballer, one person can he heard hurling insults at Jason about his brother Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s budding romance.

Our latest glimpse of that came on Friday night in the Western Conference Semifinals rematch between Denver and the Minnesota Timberwolves, as Braun got met at the rim by Rudy Gobert and just did not care, as he went over and through the linchpin of the Timberwolves defense for a ridiculous dunk.   A post shared by NBA (@nba)  As you can see in the full clip that the NBA unsurprisingly did not want to put on its social media channels, Gobert was not exactly a fan of how Braun celebrated — it did not look like he was trying to scream in Gobert’s face, more that he was fired up in the exact wrong spot. It led to some pretty aggressive pushing and shoving, but ultimately, Braun and Gobert were the only players to receive any sort of reprimand from the referees, as they were each hit with technical fouls. Unfortunately for Braun and the Nuggets, Gobert and co. would get the last laugh, as Minnesota picked up a 119-116 win."

	The former teammates were at he center of a tense moment during Friday's Celtics-Hornets game.","Grant Williams spent the first four years of his NBA career as teammates with Jayson Tatum on the Boston Celtics. He’s moved around a few times since he left the team, and on Friday night, Williams and the Charlotte Hornets played host to his old squad. He did not, however, see the end of the game, as Williams was ejected after committing a Flagrant 2 foul on Tatum. Late in the fourth quarter with the Celtics up, 114-105, Tatum reeled in a rebound and took off down the floor. While that happened, Williams came in and gave him a hip check near mid-court, which sent both of them to the ground.  A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston)  Tatum got right up and walked away from it, but another one of Williams’ former teammates in Boston, Jaylen Brown, made it a point to get in his face and say something while he was being helped up. After it was reviewed, the officials determined that Williams “accelerates, makes significant impact to the dribbler — a non-basketball play, potential for injury,” and as a result, the foul was upgraded to a Flagrant 2. It’s hard to tell exactly why Williams did this, but our hunch is after the game, he’s going to say it had something to do with the rebound Tatum grabbed right before this. You can see it at the very start of the above video, but presumably, he thought Tatum extended his arm and had LaMelo Ball hit the deck. Either that, or he just really wanted to hip check his old teammate. The Celtics went on to win, 124-109."

	All eyes are on Happy Valley for a showdown at the top of the Big Ten.","November is coming in with a bang. It’s the best month of the college football season because of its unparalleled ability to separate the wheat from the chaff in the sport, to determine which teams are real contenders to compete for conference and national titles, and which ones are unable to turn up when the pressure becomes a little more real. Week 10 doesn’t exactly give us a jam-packed slate of games, but think of it like a really fun UFC fight nit. There is a ton on the undercard — a bunch of games that should be close and will keep you flipping back and forth. There’s the co-main event that should be really good, a matchup between a pair of fun ranked team. But everything this week is going to revolve the heavyweight fight at the top of the card, which you can read about right, well, right now. The Nittany Lion fan who co-writes this every week is, in the immortal words of that kid in Christmas Vacation, sh*tting bricks. Penn State hasn’t beaten Ohio State since that famous 2016 game where they won on a blocked field goal return for a touchdown, and since then, you can make the argument that no team (outside of Michigan the last few years) has played the Buckeyes as consistently well as James Franklin’s team. But close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades, and Ohio State is on a 7-game winning streak over their Big Ten foes. Both teams have elite defenses — by SP+, the Buckeyes are No. 1 and the Nittany Lions are No. 3 in the country on that side of the football. They’re both rock solid and don’t really have a fatal flaw, although Penn State really does need to start turning its high pressure rate into sacks at some point. What this game is going to come down to, in all likelihood, is how each team overcomes potentially gigantic injuries to key parts of their offenses. For the Buckeyes, this involves their offensive line, as standout left tackle Josh Simmons is out for the year and his replacement, Zen Michalski, struggled against Nebraska before leaving with an injury that Ryan Day thinks will keep him out on Saturday. The reshuffling up front is going to be a major challenge, particularly against standout edge rusher Abdul Carter. But Penn State might have a bigger issue on its hands with an injury to starting QB Drew Allar, an Ohio native who was a disaster in Columbus last year and looked like he was primed for a monster game against his childhood team this season. Allar appeared to hurt his knee against Wisconsin last week, and while he’s a game-time decision who reports indicate will play, his backup, Beau Pribula, was able to lead a comeback in Camp Randall while he was out. Pribula is a totally different QB — Allar is a pure pocket passer, Pribula is a dual-threat — and when he was in, the Nittany Lion rushing attack took off against the Badgers. He’s not on Allar’s level as a passer, though, and to beat the Buckeyes, you have to be able to throw the ball down the field.  The margins have been awfully tight in this game over the years, and there’s no reason to think that won’t be the case again this time around. Will Day be able to get the sort of win over a top-5 team his critics think he can’t, or will Franklin be able to finally slay one of the Big Ten’s giants as he tries to secure the Nittany Lions’ spot as one of the nation’s elite? Big week for things in Pennsylvania, eh? Pitt is coming off of maybe the weirdest win of all time, a 41-13 drubbing of Syracuse where they were outgained, 327-217, but forced five interceptions and turned three of them into pick sixes. They keep finding ways to win, whether it’s behind talented young QB Eli Holstein, a physical running game led by Desmond Reid, a defense that is very good at generating havoc plays, or the top special teams unit in the country based on SP+. SMU, however, will be their toughest test by some margin, especially because dynamic signal caller Kevin Jennings was cleared to play despite an injury. When he is in, the Mustangs love to put the ball in the air and generate big plays, and how they manage to do that against a talented and opportunistic Panther secondary might end up deciding a game that has serious aspirations at the top of the ACC, which I did not expect to say about the game between Pitt and SMU at the start of the year. Is this game going to be good? Probably not. Does it have the potential to be a completely insane matchup of two teams smashed in the middle of the Big 12 that could really use a win? Absolutely. TCU quarterback Josh Hoover is capable of absolutely lighting teams up. Baylor is capable of running all over you with one of their five dudes who have at least 100 rushing yards this year. The Horned Frogs aren’t great at stopping the run, the Bears could be better at stopping teams from passing. If you like points, watch this one. Listen, Miami is going to win in all likelihood — they’re just way more talented than Duke, which has done an admirable job gutting out wins this year, in fairness. However, if Miami’s ACC title hopes take a big hit because they lose to Manny Diaz, we are going to see a gigantic meltdown out of Canes fans. Auburn beat Kentucky last week, 24-10. The Wildcats had 224 yards of total offense. Hunter, on his own, ran for 278 yards. It’s really hard to carry the ball 23 times and average 12.1 yards per carry, but Hunter did just that — plus he found the end zone twice, which is again more than Kentucky did. This line feels like an overreaction to Illinois getting outclassed by the best of the Big Ten while Minnesota has been beating a few mediocre Big Ten teams. The Illini getting points at home against a team that is a much more comfortable caliber of opponent should bring their offense back to life a bit, and I think their defense will look much faster and better against this Minnesota offense compared to Oregon. I like Illinois to win this on the field, but will also happily take three points."

	Embiid is apparently very unhappy with the discourse around his inability to play to start the season.","The Philadelphia 76ers haven’t had Joel Embiid to start the 2024-25 NBA season. Embiid missed all of the preseason, and when the first game of the year rolled around, the team said he was out with “left knee management” — the Sixers star dealt with left knee issues that limited him to only 39 games last season, and while he was able to play in the Olympics, he hasn’t taken the floor since. It’s led to Embiid getting a ton of criticism. Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal both hit him pretty hard on TNT, while one column by a local reporter — titled “Joel Embiid disrespects the Sixers, the game, its greats, and himself. Shaquille O’Neal and Charles Barkley are right to rip him.” — seemed to especially rub him the wrong way, which he made clear while speaking to the media on Friday. “It was never decided,” Embiid told the press when asked when it was decided that he’d slow play his debut this year. “Like I said, everybody has been on the same page. If your body doesn’t react well, and if your body tells you one thing — I’ve done it. From what I can tell you, I’ve broken my face twice, I came back early with the risk of losing my vision, I’ve had broken fingers, I still came back. So, I’m not gonna sit here and be like … When I see people saying he doesn’t want to play. I’ve done way too much for this city, putting myself at risk for people to be saying that. So, I do think it’s bullsh*t. Like that dude, he’s not here, Marcus, whatever his name is, I’ve done way too much for this f*cking city to be treated like this. Done way too f*cking much. “But, like I said, I wish I was as lucky as other ones, but that doesn’t mean that I’m not doing whatever it takes to be out there, which I’m gonna be here pretty soon.” Earlier this week, the NBA fined the Sixers $100,000 for how it approached the Embiid injury situation."

	Come get these winners.","Week 9 of the NFL season is here, and that means the halfway point of the campaign has arrived. Eight weeks are in the books. Eight weeks are still to come. And here we are in the middle. In this space, the first half of the season was not at all kind on the whole, but we did post a winning record in Week 8. Perhaps that is a sign of things to come. At least I will tell myself that until Week 9. Before getting to the five-pack of selections, let’s take stock.  Come get these winners. We’re going back to the Jameis train after an outright win a week ago. I do like the Browns as a standalone investment at +1.5, but the teaser is even more appealing against a low-octane Chargers offense in a game with a very modest total. On the other side, the Bengals burned us a week ago, but this is a good spot for Cincinnati at home in what amounts to a virtual must-win. This is a tail of UPROXX colleague and editor Robby Kalland and I like it quite a bit. NFC South overs might be a principle until it falls off, and Carolina’s defense is just as bad as it seems to be. Take us there, Derek Carr. The Eagles have won three in a row and all is right with the world again, right? Well, I don’t quite buy it yet. Jacksonville isn’t very good, which I will acknowledge, but the Jags have played at a much higher level in recent weeks, including in Week 8 against Green Bay. I like this above 7. In the interest of transparency, I nabbed this at 3 earlier in the week, but that line is gone now outside of opportunities to buy the half-point. Alas, I still like it at 2.5. Detroit has the best point differential in the league and things are rolling, but I’m a bit skeptical of the Lions defensively right now and, perhaps more importantly, this is the first trip outdoors for Jared Goff and the offense this season. The Bucs are very banged-up, which is part of why this line is where it is. With that said, I think Tampa Bay is the side against a Chiefs offense that is still figuring things out. Kansas City is unbeaten and rightly so, but the Chiefs haven’t exactly dominated from an ATS perspective when laying more than a touchdown. We were right against them in Week 8. Going back to the well here."

	Wemby recorded the second 5x5 game in just his 79th career game, making a bit of NBA history in the process.","Victor Wembanyama played in his 79th career NBA game on Thursday night in Utah, as the Spurs came back from an early 11-point deficit to blowout the Jazz, 106-88. Last year’s Rookie of the Year led the way on both ends of the floor for San Antonio as he often does, and he made a bit of NBA history along the way.  For the second time in his young career, the 20-year-old Frenchman posted a 5×5 performance, with 29 points, 10 rebounds, six assists, five steals, and five blocks, and in doing so, he became just the third player in NBA history to record multiple 5×5 games in his career, alongside Hakeem Olajuwon (6) and Andrei Kirilenko (3). 🚨Victor Wembanyama with an UNREAL 5×5 night 🚨 🔥25 Points🔥9 Rebounds🔥7 Assists🔥5 Steals🔥5 Blocks pic.twitter.com/hYXbfSWR4e — NBA TV (@NBATV) November 1, 2024  To be third all-time in anything in the NBA at 20 years old is insane, and he certainly has set a pace where he figures to obliterate Olajuwon’s record of 5×5 performances. Given that Olajuwon is one of the all-time great two-way players, that’s pretty terrific company for Wemby — and Kirilenko is one of those guys that was perhaps a bit ahead of his time as a do-it-all wing. What’s still terrifying is that Wembanyama is still figuring a lot of things out at the NBA level, particularly how to consistently reach his ceiling offensively given he’s already one of the league’s best defensively. Once he gets comfortable with where his spots are on the court and starts to trim the fat, so to speak, with his shot diet and pick up the efficiency on that end, there’s just not going to be anything you can really do with him."

While it may come as a shock to some fans, Lakers head coach JJ Redick explained that this was the plan they had for Bronny “since day one.” 
	Bronny James’ situation isn’t unique to him, either. As he was selected to the Lakers with the 55th pick of the 2024 NBA Draft, it was expected that he would get some burn in the G League.

	Footage showed him and longtime friend Chubbs standing up and glaring at DeRozan, a former Raptors player, when he was on the court. At one point, in true Drizzy fashion, he got on the commentary microphone and spoke with the game’s announcers. “If you ever put up a DeRozan banner, I’ll go up there and pull it down myself,” he said during an interview. At another point in the evening, when discussing the significance of VC’s jersey retirement, the 6 God said “Unfortunately, we’re playing this goof [DeRozan] tonight, but it is what it is.”

	DeMar DeRozan had a chance to be the hero and send the game into overtime with a game-tying three-pointer, but he missed the shot. As the Sacramento Kings and Toronto Raptors players exited the court, Drake could be seen mouthing “F**k outta here, pussy.” 
	In the post-game press conference, reporters asked the six-time All-Star for his thoughts on the Toronto rapper saying he would pull his banner down if the Raptors ever gave him one. “Well he gon’ have a long way to climb to take it down, so tell him good luck,” DeRozan said before exiting the podium. 
	Later that evening on his Instagram story, the Compton-born hooper responded to the situation with a clip from Ice Cube and Chris Tucker’s 1995 movie Friday. “Man sit yo a** down,” Cube’s character Craig told Tucker’s character Smokey as the antagonist, Deebo, left their presence. “Man, I got mind control over Deebo,” Smokey said in response. “He be like ‘Shut the f**k up.’ I be quiet. But when he leave, I be talkin’ again.” The clip was especially fitting as Friday is set in South Central Los Angeles, near Compton, where DeRozan and Kendrick Lamar are from.

	








 DeMar's IG story. Cooked that fraud @Drake pic.twitter.com/Zf9F4yABsW 
	This begs the question: Why is Drake angry at DeMar DeRozan, one of the best players ever to don the Toronto Raptors’ jersey, who spent nine seasons with the team and was on record being his good friend? It all goes back to his feud with Kendrick Lamar a few months ago. In June, when K. Dot held his concert The Pop Out in Los Angeles, DeRozan was captured on stage dancing to “Not Like Us.” He doubled down in July when he appeared in the music video for the track. 
	The 35-year-old hooper had been asked about his relationship with the For All The Dogs rapper following the two appearances and assured people that he still had love for him. “Love Drake, always can play him,” he told FOX40 when asked if he could still play Drake’s music following his feud with the Pulitzer Prize winner. “[But] Kendrick been a friend of mine—Damn near family, we both from the same city. Grew up damn near in the same neighborhood, but it’s always been there, it hasn’t been always publicized, but that’s basically family.”  
	Kendrick Lamar made this clear on “Not Like Us,” when he rapped “I’m glad DeRoz’ came home, y’all didn’t deserve him neither,” referring to DeRozan joining the Sacramento Kings this past summer after stints with the Raptors, San Antonio Spurs, and Chicago Bulls. Russell Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan on stage for “Not Like Us” with Kendrick Lamar pic.twitter.com/c6SnHxDP0T 
	In another interview, DeRozan doubled down and stated that they are still friends, but he did what he did for the culture. “Drake’s still my man, still my man, none of it changed,” he told The Sacramento Bee. “It’s so easy to get overlooked and look at it for what it looks like, but at the end of the day it’s music, entertainment. Two of the biggest rappers in the world went at it from a competitive standpoint and they battled it out.” 
	As for being at The Pop Out and in the “Not Like Us” music video, Derozan said: “It was fun to be a part of. For that moment, it was so much bigger than what people look at it as a beef between (Lamar) and Drake. It brought our whole city together in a different type of light where there wasn’t no issues, no violence. Everybody was coming together in a peaceful manner and that was the beauty out of those moments.”

	








 
	Given the fact DeRozan was one of the people Drake unfollowed on Instagram over these last few months, it is safe to believe that Drake felt betrayed; especially by someone whom he comforted in a difficult time. DeRozan spoke with Shannon Sharpe on a 2021 episode of Club Shay Shay about being traded from the Toronto Raptors to the San Antonio Spurs in 2018.  
	DeMar DeRozan was devastated, especially after being told he would not be traded, and the five-time Grammy winner welcomed him into his home to talk for hours. “When it come to him, he’ll forever have a friend in me and loyalty out of me because he cared,” DeRozan told Shannon Sharpe. “He was there for me when everything was just going crazy.”   Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox"

	The Chicago Sky star will continue her relationship with the sports apparel brand while also releasing a signature sneaker, according to ESPN’s Shams Charania as of Thursday (Oct. 24). Reese initially signed with Reebok last year while attending LSU. 
	Following the news, Reese took to X to joke that she can now “afford her bills.” The quip comes after she revealed that her WNBA salary doesn’t cover her $8,000 rent and barely covers her car note. 
	Reese reportedly made $73,439 in her rookie season as the No. 7 overall pick of the 2024 WNBA draft. Besides her base pay, the 22-year-old has also signed a slew of endorsements, including Raising Cane’s, Topps, Airbnb, Tampax and Beats by Dre. She also recently dropped her Unapologetically Angel podcast where she’s already seen much traction for her past guests including Kayla Nicole, Shaquille O’Neal, GloRilla and more.

	








 
	Additionally, with Reese’s sneaker gearing up to release under Reebok, that’s sure to bring in much revenue for the company, as well. 
	“I’m extremely excited to let you guys know that we are officially coming out with a Reebok by Angel signature shoe,” she said in a statement, per Bleacher Report. “We’ve already kicked off the design process, and it means the world to me to have Reebok’s full support and confidence with this shoe and overall partnership.” Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox"

	During an appearance alongside Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton on the Young Man and the Three podcast, the former United States President aired his grievances regarding the NBA All-Star Game, which has drawn increasing criticism in recent years. 
	According to Obama, concern of players geting injured during the star-studded game are overblown, as many of those same players regularly participate in summer leagues and offseason runs that are intense without being overtly physical.

	








 
	“Y’all gotta have a little more pride in that All-Star Game,” the 63-year-old told Haliburton, a two-time All-Star himself.

	“It’s not as if you all don’t play pickup during the summers. You know how to play in a way that, ‘Alright, I’m not going to hurt anybody, I’m not going to take anybody out.’ But that All-Star Game, it’s broke, man.” 
	The avid basketball fan continued, comparing current players’ lack of physical exertion with that of greats from past eras. “Like, people just like not running,” Obama continued. “Everybody just trying all kinds of… it used to be when Kobe and Michael and Isaiah and those guys were playing, man. I mean they weren’t playing the way they did regular season, but they wanted to win.” 
	Obama also lamented the perception the All-Star game gives off to casual fans, who may otherwise be inclined to tune into other games during the season, but decide not to. “It insults the game,” the former Senator added.  
	“This is your business. This is your product. You don’t want people thinking you’re all out there just half-a**ed.” Obama concluded his rant by declaring that he will no longer be watching the NBA All-Star Game if no changes are made in the near future. 
	“Y’all need to do something because I ain’t watching that thing no more,” the avid basketball fan warned,   a sentiment that has been echoed by others regarding the NBA All-Star Game activities as a whole.

	On Tuesday (Oct. 22), ESPN released their latest cover story featuring the NBA and NFL stars, respectively, with the photo being a direct nod to legends Randy Moss and Kevin Garnett. Edwards and Jefferson rocked designer shades for their cover, but just as the Minnesota greats did before them, the duo showed respect to each other by donning each other’s jerseys. Behind the scenes of the cover story’s photoshoot showed Jefferson and Edwards bonding and cracking jokes, so much so, you wouldn’t even be able to tell that they went to rival SEC colleges.  
	The two quipped about possibly playing each other’s sport and what positions they’d play. Ant-Man asserted that he would be as big as the Baltimore Raven’s star runningback, Derrick Henry, if he hit the gym because right now he’s “lowkey fat for real.” BossMan Dlow’s “Get In With Me” could be heard soundtracking the visual experience, with the stars going aura for aura as they tried on outfits, flashed their grills, and debated about sports, of course.

	








 
	Meanwhile, the article component to the story followed the superstar’s eventual rise to become the new faces of Minnesota sports. ESPN’s story also explores the similarities between the two men, such as attending SEC colleges before being drafted into the NBA and the NFL in 2020.

He told Fox News Digital he is donating his paycheck to Tunnel to Towers.,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Eric Bischoff will be back and better than ever – at least for one night. The legendary pro wrestling figure will take control of the Major League Wrestling (MLW) One Shot event in New York City on Dec. 5. He told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview he would donate his entire paycheck to the Tunnel to Towers Foundation. ""One of the things I told (MLW founder Court Bauer) right away was this isn’t about the money,"" Bischoff said. ""He started to negotiate my fee and I really wasn’t interested in negotiating it, I just said whatever it is, I’m going to donate it to Tunnel to Towers.

I just want whatever it is to be donated because I’m not doing this for the money. I’m doing it for the fun."" Bischoff will be calling the shots for the one night of pro wrestling at the Melrose Ballroom in Queens. He said he talked to Bauer for several years about doing a show with MLW, but the timing was just never right. Then, the stars aligned. Paul Walter Hauser, an actor-turned-MLW wrestler, joined Bischoff on the wrestling mogul’s YouTube show ""Life Choices."" As the two discussed the business, Hauser called Bauer live and the dominoes fell into place from there. Talented pro wrestlers have moved through the company, including Alex Shelley, Austin Aries, Lexis King (then known as Brian Pillman Jr.), Francine, Gangrel, Jacob Fatu, Karrion Kross (then known as Killer Kross), Konnan, Matt Cardona, MJF, Tajiri and several others.  FROM ACTING TO THE SQUARED CIRCLE, EMMY WINNER HAUSER IS READY TO RUMBLE FOR MAJOR LEAGUE WRESTLING Eric Bischoff was formerly the head of World Championship Wrestling.

Donovan Dijak also made his debut with the company over the summer after his contract with WWE was not renewed. ""They’re obviously attracting some great talent. Court, as a former writer in WWE, understands the art of storytelling. I love the fact that they’re the underdog, and they’re kind of, of course, building this brand from the ground up. ""And, I love watching emerging companies – whether it’s in the wrestling business or anything else. I’m just fascinated with the prospect of MLW growing and reaching the next level or whatever it may be for them."" Bischoff has been behind some of the most interesting creative angles in pro wrestling history, as he helped establish the New World Order faction in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), which saw Hulk Hogan go from the good guy to a heel, joining the likes of Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, collectively known as The Outsiders. The decision sparked the ""Monday Night Wars"" with WWE (then known as the World Wrestling Federation) and put WCW on top for more than a year in the ratings battle. In the end, WCW flamed out, but Bischoff’s influence in the business was far from cooled. He joined WWE to become the on-air general manager of the RAW brand and was also an executive producer for Total Nonstop Action wrestling. EX-WWE STAR DONOVAN DIJAK MAKES ELECTRIC MAJOR LEAGUE WRESTLING DEBUT: 'EXECUTION WAS FLAWLESS' Eric Bischoff will take over creative for Major League Wrestling for one night. (Major League Wrestling) Bischoff told Fox News Digital he is already starting to enjoy getting back into the creative aspect of the wrestling business and is looking forward to creating a show. It does not exactly mean he is looking for a return in the long run. ""I don’t even think about that,"" he said. ""One of the things I told Court is that for me to do something in wrestling now, it has to be fun. If it’s not fun for me, if it’s just a job, or if it’s just a payday, I’m really not that interested. … When it comes to putting my toe back in the water in wrestling, my first priority is that it has to be fun. If it’s not fun, I’m not interested. ""So it all depends. I honestly, to be very transparent about it, I can’t see it. I like my life just the way it is. I live in a beautiful part of the country out in the middle of nowhere where I can look out my back window and see Yellowstone National Park. …  ""So, for me to commit – just committing to professional wrestling is 24 hours, seven days a week. If you’re not doing it, you’re thinking about it. If you’re not thinking about it, you’re worrying about it. If you’re not worrying about it, you’re sleeping. It’s hard for me to imagine. But again, it depends how much fun I have. If it’s successful and everybody, not just me, but if the audience enjoys, if Court and his team – most importantly- enjoy the process, then, you know, anything’s possible. But highly unlikely. Let’s put it that way."" Eric Bischoff attends SiriusXM's ""Busted Open"" celebrating their 10th anniversary In New York City on the eve of WrestleMania 35 on April 6, 2019 in New York City.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Mike Tyson 'fine' being underdog to Jake Paul; oddsmaker says why,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mike-tyson-fine-with-being-underdog-jake-paul-oddsmaker-says-why,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 07:20:37 -0500","Mike Tyson finds himself in territory he probably never expected: an underdog in a boxing match against a social media star. However, he says he&apos;s &quot;fine with&quot; that.","Jake Paul and Mike Tyson face off at the final press conference ahead of their long-awaited bout Friday in Arlington, Texas. IRVING, Texas – In a fight between one of the greatest boxers of all time and someone who got his fame through YouTube, social media and Disney Channel, the latter is the betting favorite. Odds currently have 27-year-old Jake Paul as the favorite over Mike Tyson, 58, for their long-awaited Friday night fight in Dallas. Of course, Paul is fresh, with this being his third fight of the year. He is also 29 years Tyson's junior. Tyson, meanwhile, has not had a professional fight since 2005; his bout with Roy Jones four years ago was an exhibition.

(Ed Mulholland/Getty Images) Tyson was mostly mellow and short-winded in the final Paul-Tyson press conference on Wednesday - the polar opposite of his opponent, who even took bets with those on the card, including co-main evener Katie Taylor. The most amped up Tyson got at the final Paul-Tyson press conference on Wednesday was when he said emphatically, ""I'm not gonna lose."" Other than that, he was very short, but not so sweet. His confidence is understandable - any training video Tyson puts out, he seems awfully dangerous, especially for someone nearing 60. The odds, though, seem to be disrespecting him. However, Tyson does not seem to mind that too much. When asked by Fox News Digital how disrespected he felt at the unfavorable odds and why he thought he was the underdog, his response, as usual, was short.

(Ed Mulholland/Getty Images) SUPER BOWL CHAMP HOPES MIKE TYSON KNOCKS JAKE PAUL'S 'FREAKING HEAD OFF' ""I'm fine with everything - I'm fine with everything,"" Tyson said in typical Tyson fashion. Admittedly, DraftKings Director of Sports Operations Johnny Avello said the lines are more disrespect to Tyson, who is at around +160 with Paul at -200. ""He didn't even look that good at the end of his career - he was struggling with no-name guys. Here he is now at 58 years old - he looks good, I think he's in fairly good shape, but it's one thing to be in good shape; it's another thing to be in fighting shape,"" Avello said in an interview with Fox News Digital.  ""Paul's not known for being a great fighter, whereas Tyson is. So I would say it's more disrespect."" Avello also said it was difficult to come up with necessarily fair odds when one half of the main event does not have much of a recent sample to base anything off of. ""We were all over the map on this, thinking with what [the odds] should have been,"" Avello said. However, despite several six-figure wagers on Paul, Avello noted that nearly 70% of the money is on Tyson for numerous reasons - Tyson fandom plus Paul hatred being one of them.  It is on track to be the most wagered-on fight of the year. One popular bet people are taking is Tyson, with his power, to win in the first round at 22-1. ""That has taken a large amount of money,"" Avello said. ""The liability can build up rather quickly.""

EXCLUSIVE: Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry and head coach Steve Kerr were backing Vice President Harris pretty passionately in the recent election.  However, her crushing loss to President-elect Donald Trump did not stop them from focusing on getting a big win against the Boston Celtics last week, according to a team player.  Second-year Warriors shooting guard Brandin Podziemski told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview what the vibe of the team's locker room was like after Trump's landslide victory over Harris last week. Podziemski says Curry and Kerr made it a point to stay focused on the upcoming game.  ""We were in Boston and our focus was beating the Celtics,"" Podziemski said. ""Whoever was elected, we're going to have to deal with it anyways, and so Steve and Steph and the whole group made it a point to just focus on the game because that's all we could control.""  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry presents Vice President Kamala Harris with a jersey bearing #1 on Jan. 17, 2023 in Washington, D.C. The Warriors won the 2022 NBA Championship. (Win McNamee/Getty Images) Podziemski suggested that there was a diverse range of opinions in the Warriors' locker room but very few conversations about the actual election results.  ""Everybody just has their own opinions and their own things that they believe in, and I don't think, that no matter what you believe in, it's going to change anything in terms of relationships with our guys, so we just kind of let everybody have their own opinion, we didn't really share much about it all amongst each other, we were just kind of focusing on what's in front of us.""  The Warriors got the win against Boston last Wednesday 118-112. Curry had 27 points that night, as the team is off to a fast 9-2 start to the season.  Both Curry and Kerr were vocal supporters of Harris during the cycle, with both making speaking appearances at the Democrat National Convention in July.  Kerr even went so far as to mock Trump on stage during his speech, boasting that Democrats would be able to use Curry's famous on-court celebration upon a Trump defeat, but that prediction was wrong.  WARRIORS' STEVE KERR MAKES BOLD PREDICTION AT DNC, WANTS TO TELL DONALD TRUMP 'NIGHT, NIGHT' LIKE STEPH CURRY Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr delivers a speech on the first evening of the DNC Convention. (Yalonda M. James/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images) ""After the results are tallied that night, we can, in the words of the great Steph Curry, we can tell Donald Trump, ‘Night, night!’"" Kerr said as he rested his head on his hands like a pillow.  However, since the election results on Tuesday, both Curry and Kerr have congratulated Trump on his win and wished the next president luck.  ""It's a situation where Trump won. Congratulate them on a hard-fought campaign,"" Curry told reporters after the Celtics game. ""The whole part about how this country's supposed to work is everybody supporting each other and coming with the right intentions to lead the country in the right direction. That's my hope. I don't hold any resentment or ill will. You want these next four years to go great for everybody. We want accountability on that front, too."" Podziemski, who is originally from the suburb of Greenfield, Wisconsin, first came to the Bay Area in 2022, when he transferred from the University of Illinois to Santa Clara University. He was drafted in the first round by the Warriors in the 2023 NBA Draft and has stepped up as an effective bench player in his second season during the team's hot start. As much as he has looked to Curry and Kerr as leaders and champions, he does not see their political activism as something he would necessarily follow himself.  ""I don't really look at, in terms of politics, anybody as a role model,"" Podziemski said. ""As a person, as a basketball player, I look up to Steph a lot, but when it comes to politics, everybody has to have their own opinion and their own voice at some point, so for me I value what he says, I value what everyone else has to say, and I just keep it pushing."" Podziemski, who was named an all-rookie first team in his first season, has averaged 8.2 points with 4.6 rebounds and 3.4 assists to start his second year. For him, this season is important because of what it means to Curry, regardless of his political impact.  Curry did not rule out the possibility of running for president himself when he is done playing basketball during an interview on CBS earlier this year.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Golden State Warriors player Stephen Curry, left, looks on as U.S. basketball coach Steve Kerr speaks during the daily briefing in the Brady Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 17, 2023. (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) Until then, all Curry is focused on is getting to another NBA Finals. At 36 years old, Curry only has so many years left to chase a fifth championship. It is a conversation that Podziemski has had with the veteran plenty of times this year.  ""We talked over the summer quite a bit that he only has so many years left, he knows that, so he wants to get ring number five,"" Podziemski said. ""That's his big focus, and he knows he only has so much left in the tank to give, so he wants to win.""  Podziemski is doing his part to try and make that happen.  Meanwhile, the second-year player has followed the example of another Warriors veteran teammate more closely. Podziemski has recently started a new sponsorship with Invisalign, as he has partnered with the dental technology brand as one of his endorsement deals, following the lead of fellow Warriors guard Kevon Looney.  ""Over 18 million people use them worldwide, so it made sense all around for me,"" he said.  Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Trans volleyball player accused of plan to harm teammate after taking scholarships from female players,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trans-volleyball-player-accused-plan-harm-teammate-after-taking-scholarship-from-female-recruit,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 07:02:59 -0500",San Jose State women&apos;s volleyball player Brooke Slusser is leading a lawsuit against her school and the Mountain West Conference alleging a plot against her safety.,"San Jose State University volleyball co-captain Brooke Slusser explains why she is seeking legal action amid school’s transgender athlete controversy as former NCAA star Riley Gaines adds her perspective on ‘America Reports.’ San Jose State women's volleyball player Brooke Slusser and several of her peers have come forward in a new lawsuit against the university and the Mountain West Conference.  It alleged Slusser's safety, dignity and rights had been endangered by the presence of a trans athlete, and that athlete was also given a scholarship over biologically female players who were left financially and emotionally impacted.  In court documents obtained by Fox News Digital and OutKick, Slusser and other players shared details about an alleged plan to have Slusser hit in the face by a volleyball during a game.  San Jose State volleyball player Chandler Manusky is cited in the lawsuit recounting an incident in early October, when she and other teammates, including the trans athlete, violated team rules by sneaking out of the team hotel the night before a match against Colorado State. Manusky claimed to have then learned about an alleged plan by Fleming to ensure San Jose State would lose the match and set up Colorado State player Malaya Jones to spike Slusser in the face during a match on Oct. 3.  ""Manusky said that at Jones’ residence Fleming had shared with Jones the scouting for the CSU-FC game and they had discussed Fleming ‘throw[ing] the game’ and how they would set up Jones to ‘blow up’ Slusser and ‘blast’ her in the face during the game,"" the court documents read.  ""Manusky also said that Fleming stated, ‘I’m going to leave center court open,’ which would allow Malaya Jones to have a wide-open shot to try to ‘blow up Slusser,’ i.e., to try to hit Brooke Slusser in the face with the ball."" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The documents allege Manusky confronted head coach Todd Kress and currently-suspended assistant coach Melissa Batie-Smoose about the incident. Manusky claims she was crying as she begged them not to tell Fleming that she had come forward with the story. Kress is alleged to have told Batie-Smoose that he believed the story was not true. ""Kress told Batie-Smoose he did not believe Manusky and thought she had made up the entire story so she would not get in trouble for leaving the team hotel,"" the documents read.  Batie-Smoose was suspended by the program after filing a Title IX complaint alleging favoritism by the university toward Fleming. Batie-Smoose is now part of the new lawsuit as well.  San Jose State provided a statement to Fox News Digital.  ""We have not been served with the lawsuit. We just obtained a copy of the 132-page document at 3:58 p.m. We will not comment at this time,"" the statement said.    Fox News Digital previously obtained a statement from San Jose State about earlier reports of the allegations against Fleming to harm Slusser.  ""The safety and wellbeing of our student athletes and employees is our highest priority. The university has taken and will continue to take multiple steps to provide security, support, and resources to all members of the team as the program navigates this challenging time,"" the statement read. INSIDE SAN JOSE STATE'S POLICE BATTLE TO PROTECT WOMEN'S ATHLETES THREATENED BY A TRANSGENDER CULTURE WAR ""San José State takes all reports and complaints seriously, but we are unable to provide any information regarding confidential complaints and reports out of respect for the parties involved and due to federal and state privacy laws. The University also has concerns about a number of inaccuracies in the press but is not able to comment further on those in light of privacy rights of all involved. We will continue to honor the privacy of our employees and students. We require and expect that all of our employees abide by our standards, policies, and applicable laws regarding student and employee privacy."" Slusser told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that she was made aware of Fleming's alleged plan and believes she has been treated unfairly by the university, arguing the university has not done enough to investigate the matter.  Blaire Fleming, a redshirt senior at San Jose State University, #3, plays as an outside and right-side hitter on the women’s volleyball team. (San Jose State University) ""If this was me, and I was the one threatening to do this to my teammate who's caused so much commotion, there would have been action taken immediately,"" Slusser said. ""I was definitely very angry, and I was glad at first to know that it was already made aware to the coaching staff and compliance and everyone, but I don't know if that made me feel any differently, I was just angry because I didn't think someone would go to these lengths.""  ""Threatening to want to hurt one of your own teammates, I just feel like there's so many things in that whole conversation that would make a school want to get it dealt with.""  Slusser also said she has not spoken with Fleming about the allegations, adding that speaking with the athlete ""isn't worth my breath.""  The lawsuit recounts Fleming's initial recruitment to the team in 2022.  Fleming received a full scholarship, while a biologically female player, Alyssa Sugai, did not receive a scholarship and alleges that she was told by coaches that she was not ""phyiscal"" enough as a player compared to Fleming. Sugai is now part of the lawsuit and seeking monetary damages after the decision to grant Fleming a lawsuit instead caused Sugai's volleyball career to end, causing severe depression.  TRUMP INVITES 'BRAVE' WOMEN'S SWIM TEAM THAT 'STOOD UP TO' TRANSGENDER ATHLETE TO RALLY STAGE From front left to right, San Jose State setter Brooke Slusser celebrates after scoring a point with libero Randilyn Reeves, outside hitter Blaire Fleming and libero Alessia Buffagni during the first set of an NCAA college volleyball match against Colorado State on Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024 in Fort Collins, Colorado. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) ""As a result of her frustration and feelings of inadequacy because she was not able to make the starting line-up through effort and sacrifice and because her diminished playing time behind Fleming prevented her from receiving offers through the transfer portal, Sugai faced depression during and after the transfer portal period and ultimately determined that she had no realistic choice other than to give up playing collegiate volleyball after the 2022 season,"" the court document reads.  ""Losing to Fleming caused Sugai to doubt her ability to play volleyball at a high level, even though she had rigorously trained and competed since childhood. It also caused her to doubt her self-worth and caused her to feel ‘defeated.’"" Fellow former San Jose State player Elle Patterson is also part of the lawsuit and alleges she did not receive a scholarship. Patterson also played behind Fleming and alleges that the university did not fulfill previous verbal offers of a scholarship to her for the 2023 and 2024 seasons. Patterson says she even paid full tuition to play in 2023 after being told she would get a scholarship for 2024. However, the program did not make good on that offer either, she alleges.  ""Ultimately, Patterson informed Associate Head Coach Batie-Smoose and Head Coach Todd Kress that she was financially unable to pay for full out-of-state tuition, room and board at SJSU again in 2024 and therefore would be unable to return to the SJSU Team without a scholarship,"" the documents read.  ""Nevertheless, Todd Kress remained firm in his position that Patterson would not receive a scholarship to play on the SJSU Team in 2024, and that Fleming would receive a full scholarship to play on the SJSU Team."" Patterson is also now seeking financial damages. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Slusser has also alleged that the university has threatened to take away her scholarship for speaking on the issue of sharing a team, locker room and bedroom with Fleming.  The lawsuit alleges that Kress has communicated with a private lawyer as part of his effort to get Slusser removed from the team and has told others that he has filed Title IX complaints against Slusser based not on comments Slusser has made in practice, but on communications Slusser has made to journalists and in public forums concerning her beliefs. Slusser previously told Fox News Digital that she supports Trump's proposed ban on trans athletes in women's sports, and whether it becomes banned or not will determine whether she allows her future potential daughter to play sports.  ""If I knew that there was a man playing where my daughter was supposed to be playing, or playing against my daughter, my daughter wouldn't be involved in that situation. I would never allow that to happen to my daughter, just knowing that I've been through it, just knowing it's not right and not fair and not safe."" In the 2020 election cycle, 94.38% of San José State University employee donations went to Democratic candidates in federal elections, while 5.62% of donations went to Republican candidates, according to data from Open Secrets.  Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Trump to preside over historic sporting events: Which teams and stars could skip White House visits?,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trump-preside-over-historic-sporting-events-which-teams-stars-could-skip-white-house-visits,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 05:00:07 -0500",Trump&apos;s White House visits to championship teams and interactions with international athletes will be defining moments of his second term.,"President-elect Donald Trump speaks to the House GOP as they grow closer to clinching the majority for next term. Donald Trump's second term will be a historic four years for sports.  The entire world will turn its eyes to the U.S. as it hosts a World Cup and a Summer Olympics in a single presidential term.  And for sports in America, Trump's controversial standing among many of the country's biggest stars and figures could burn even hotter than it did four years ago. Here's a look at all the sports history that will come under a political and global microscope with Trump in the White House over the next four years. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Donald Trump waves to the crowd at Bryant-Denny Stadium during the Alabama-Georgia game in Tuscaloosa, Ala., on Sept. 28, 2024. (Gary Cosby Jr.-Imagn Images) The 2024 college football season is the first in history with a 12-team playoff, and the first with a massive realignment in the sport's most prominent conferences after a mass exodus of programs from the Pac-12.  The first official championship will technically take place just days before Trump is inaugurated in January, but the champions' White House visit will be one of the first of Trump's second term. Trump should expect respect from the sport's coaches and stars. During Trump's first term, and even during his recent campaign, college football has been the sport to embrace Trump the most unanimously in the U.S. His appearances at games, including multiple Army-Navy games in his first term and a Georgia-Alabama game in September, were met with rousing applause. No college football national champion skipped a White House visit during Trump's first term. Meanwhile, Georgia skipped a visit to President Biden's White House in 2023. And no notable college football coach has spoken out against Trump publicly, while many have spoken positively about the next president. With 12 teams now in the college football playoff, it's possible that in the next three years Trump's White House could host the lowest-ranked team to ever win the national title, a potential American underdog story.  Trump infamously declined to invite several major women's basketball championship teams to the White House during his first term, including every WNBA champion. Among those were the 2017 women’s college basketball champion South Carolina Gamecocks, the 2017 WNBA champion Minnesota Lynx and the 2018 women’s college basketball champion Notre Dame Fighting Irish. The 2018 WNBA champion Seattle Storm were not invited but made it clear they would not have attended the ceremony if they had. The one time Trump's White House ever hosted a women's basketball team was the 2019 national champion Baylor Bears. Angel Reese of LSU, right, and Caitlin Clark of Iowa (Maddie Meyer/Getty Images/File) The reigning WNBA champion New York Liberty would be scheduled to visit Trump's White House in May. However, it is possible they will not be invited or might not even attend if they are invited. Liberty star Breanna Stewart has been an activist for left-wing values and joined the protests against Trump's travel ban in January 2017, shortly after he took office the first time.  Meanwhile, 22-year-old superstar Caitlin Clark has brought a significant new spotlight to the sport since Trump was last in office, and Trump himself has complimented Clark and suggested she is underpaid during an interview on the ""Let’s Go!"" podcast.  ""She’s incredible, by the way,"" Trump then said of Clark. ""I’ve watched her. I think she’s incredible. The shot – I watch her shot go in, it’s like, could she shoot that way in the NBA? She’s unbelievable."" It's possible that Clark will lead the Indiana Fever to an WNBA title in the next three years, considering the rookie star led the team back to the playoffs for the first time in eight seasons. If that happens, then whether Clark and her teammates attend a Trump White House visit will be a cornerstone moment in the history of the WNBA and the future of its audience. Trump will present the 2026 World Cup trophy after the final at MetLife Stadium in 2026. It was Trump's first administration that made the bid to host the 2026 World Cup, and now he will preside over it when it happens.  However, that deal was initially agreed upon with the understanding that Trump wouldn't be president when the event took place amid concerns over the controversy he stirred in the global community. In a meeting with FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the White House in August 2018, Trump didn’t factor in the possibility of losing the 2020 election, which opened the door for him to run again four years later and thus return to office in time for the 2026 World Cup. ""2026, I won’t be here,"" Trump said at the time, per the Associated Press. Infantino nevertheless used his Instagram account to congratulate Trump even before his election victory early on Nov. 6. Infantino also recently moved to Miami, 70 miles south of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. FIFA even seems to have an open line of communication with Trump to talk through potential challenges, such as Iran’s probable qualification for the men’s World Cup and the political implications it may bring. Whether the players on the field are as receptive to Trump in two years is a different question. But Trump may be spared an awkward trophy interaction with one of soccer's biggest stars, based on past interactions, if one of the sport's powerhouse countries prevails. France superstar Kylian Mbappé, who led his country to the final for the second straight time in 2022 before losing to Lionel Messi and Argentina, once posed with Trump's daughter and son-in-law; Mbappé posed for a photo with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and the French star even put his arms around Trump's grandchildren in the photo.  However, Mbappé also went out of his way to speak out against his country's right-wing presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen, in France's election this year. Mbappé criticized Le Pen for her anti-immigration stances.  Mbappé may well be the biggest star in all of soccer in 2026 at his current pace. The Kansas City Chiefs could be in the last leg of their quest for a third straight Super Bowl when Trump is inaugurated in January. The Chiefs are currently undefeated and have the best odds in the league to make the big game. If they pull it off, it would also earn the team its first Trump White House visit. They couldn't make it during the summer of 2020 thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. Their last two championships have resulted in trips to Biden's White House, where all notable players except for kicker Harrison Butker attended. But tight end Travis Kelce would have his own dilemma if his team gets the job done and gets invited to Trump's White House. Kelce's girlfriend, pop star Taylor Swift, endorsed Trump's Democrat opponent, Vice President Harris, in the recent election, and she has endorsed Democrats since 2018. But Swift's endorsement of Harris prompted a hostile response from Trump himself when he wrote, ""I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT"" on his Truth Social platform in September. Kelce has not spoken about politics or the election at all in this year's cycle. He was previously criticized by Aaron Rodgers for endorsing a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Meanwhile, family members of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes showed support for Trump in the recent election cycle. Mahomes' mother officially endorsed Trump, and his wife, Brittany, liked multiple posts and comments on social media in support of Trump. The Chiefs are the active dynasty of the NFL, and that could easily continue into Trump's presidency, along with awkward White House invitations. The only two NFL teams to get invitations to Trump's White House during his first term were the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles. The Patriots accepted both invitations in 2017 and 2019. The Eagles' visit was canceled, and the team released a statement saying it was in relation to Trump's stance on players standing for the national anthem. The Eagles are another team that could be in regular contention to win the Super Bowl throughout the rest of Trump's second term, and if they do, a second White House invitation could incite a national controversy as it did the first time. Like the 2026 World Cup, Trump had an active hand in America's bidding to host the 2028 Olympics. And now he is set to preside over it in the final year of his second term. However, cooperation with Trump has not been publicly embraced the same way with the International Olympic Committee as it has with FIFA. IOC President Thomas Bach made one visit to the White House in June 2017 that is part of Olympic lore for how badly it went. ""Pray for our world,"" Bach was heard to say on a cellphone call later that day in Washington, D.C. The IOC has not yet acknowledged Trump's presidential victory. Asked why there was no formal acknowledgment of Trump’s win last week, the IOC cited its tradition of neutrality and not taking political sides, according to the AP. TRANS GOLFER DISCUSSES DECISION TO STOP COMPETING AGAINST BIOLOGICAL FEMALES: 'I'M NOT A WOMAN' Potential conflict between Trump and the IOC could arise over the issue of gender eligibility for athletes in women's sports. Trump has pledged to ban trans athletes in women's sports as part of his presidency, and he spoke out against the inclusion of boxers Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting. Both of those boxers failed gender eligibility tests for previous international competitions. However, the IOC has defended the inclusion of the boxers. More cases could arise by 2028; the United Nations says nearly 900 biological females have fallen short of the podium because they were beaten out by trans athletes. Not a single NBA champion attended a Trump White House visit during his first term. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP LeBron James and Stephen Curry, the two players who dominated those four years, have lambasted Trump on multiple occasions while endorsing Democrat candidates. They both endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016, Biden in 2020 and Harris in 2024. But both players are now coming to the end of their careers, and whether they will even have the opportunity to decline a Trump White House visit is no guarantee.

The New York Jets season has not gone according to plan.  Despite having four-time NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers under center for all 10 games this season, the Jets have only managed to win three of those contests. Rodgers was available for less than one full game in 2023, after he suffered a season-ending injury in Week 1.  Star defensive back Sauce Gardner has appeared frustrated at times this season.

""If I were a coach, I would want to be like a school teacher and say ‘Hey guys, can we put the phones in our caddies until after the game, and can we focus?'""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The Chicago Bears made a big move, firing offensive coordinator Shane Waldron as the team’s offense continues to struggle this season.  And a new report says Waldron wasn’t the only problem the Bears thought they had in the locker room. Former Bears receiver and current ESPN Chicago radio host Tom Waddle wrote on X Tuesday that Bears players weren’t just pushing for Waldron to be relieved of his duties. They wanted Williams, the team’s No. 1 overall pick, benched.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams sits on the bench in the closing minutes of a game.  (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) ""After talking to a few people with knowledge of the situation, players went to Matt Eberflus and Ryan Poles asking them to make a change at offensive coordinator,"" Waddle wrote on X. ""There have also been a few veteran players requesting (Tyson) Bagent starts."" Bagent played solidly last season as an undrafted rookie, playing in five games due to an injured Justin Fields. He was 2-2 as a starter, throwing for three touchdowns, six interceptions, 859 yards and a 65.7% completion rate.  Bagent also scored two rushing touchdowns and ran for 109 yards on 23 attempts.  BEARS FIRE SHANE WALDRON AS OFFENSIVE WOES CONTINUE: ‘IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR TEAM’ Last week, Williams was taken down nine times in the pocket and has shown accuracy issues when he does get the ball off. The Bears fell to the lowly New England Patriots, who had rookie Drake Maye quarterbacking their offense.  Bears head coach Matt Eberflus, though, said Williams will remain the team’s starter despite Waldron’s dismissal. Thomas Brown, the team’s pass game coordinator, has taken over as offensive coordinator with Waldron gone.  ""Definitely this game is a lot to learn from for myself, just speaking on some of the situational things,"" Williams said Sunday after the loss, via the New York Post.  Chicago Bears quarterback Tyson Bagent (17) against the Arizona Cardinals at State Farm Stadium.

But I think, situationally, this game was a great learning experience for me with some of these situations that I could have done better for sure."" Williams’ rookie season didn’t start off on the right foot, but he seemed to be getting his bearings after the team ripped off a three-game win streak, which included a four-touchdown performance in London against the Jacksonville Jaguars.  However, Williams hasn’t found the end zone through the air in the last three weeks during this losing streak that has dropped the Bears to 4-5. In fact, the Bears’ offense hasn’t scored a touchdown in back-to-back weeks.  The Bears have an NFC North gauntlet in their next three games, too.

Kelce was referring to Riley Moss, who is in his second season with the Broncos after being selected in the third round of the 2023 NFL Draft out of Iowa.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Kansas City Chiefs tight end Peyton Hendershot (88) is tackled by Denver Broncos cornerback Riley Moss (21) during the second half at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium.  (Jay Biggerstaff/Imagn Images) Moss, 24, became the first White cornerback to start in a game since 2002, when Jason Sehorn last did it for the New York Giants. Moss has been a key part of a stout Broncos defense that is surrendering the fourth fewest points per game (17.7) in the league.  Moss appeared in 14 games as a rookie last season but didn’t start any. This season, Moss has started every game, recording 43 solo tackles with five passes defended and one interception.  Travis’ brother and podcast co-host, Jason Kelce, asked if Moss was a true outside cornerback and not a safety positioned as a cornerback in a certain defensive package. ""Yeah, 21 (Moss' jersey number), starter. He hides it though. He wears long sleeves. He hides it, and I think he wears the turtleneck too,"" Travis responded.

That was also the first season that USC sported the trojan head logo on the sides of its cardinal helmets, as well as a modified Northwestern striping pattern on the sleeves of its cardinal home and white road jerseys. This design was worn until the 2002 season, when then-head coach Pete Carroll reintroduced the crescent-shaped shoulder design the Trojans initially wore from 1958-71 and still wear to this day. USC will wear metallic helmets with chrome face masks as a modern update to the classic look for Homecoming. #FightOn pic.twitter.com/5zP4pF6sBR This will mark the first time that USC has deviated from its standard home or road uniforms since the Trojans wore a metallic version of their cardinal helmets with chrome facemasks for select games during the 2014-15 seasons. They also added gold flakes to their standard gray facemasks in 2012, but – aside from that small detail – they have consistently worn Saturday’s throwback uniform or their current design for more than 65 years. The Trojans wore these uniforms, which are complete with their standard gold pants with two cardinal stripes down the sides, under legendary coach John Robinson (1976-82, 1993-97), who passed away on Monday at the age of 89.

Though they were unveiled and worn in a match in late October, Genoa continued to build up hype around their new black jerseys for the 2024-25 season this week. First, they posted a teaser video featuring the signature bells from the start of the WWE Hall of Famer’s entrance music, which they followed up with photos of the four-time WWE Champion wearing the kit, manufactured by Kappa. ⏳⚫️🍯 pic.twitter.com/go87j1WHkq The black base of the kit features a repeating pattern of tonal griffins isolated from the club crest. That crest appears on the left chest in black and gold, while gold Kappa logo sit on the right chest and each shoulder. The collar and sleeve cuffs are solid black with gold trim. The version worn by the Deadman — whose real name is Mark Calloway — features gold sponsor logos on the chest, left sleeve and lower back, along with a Serie A patch on the right sleeve. Genoa gave fans a look at the third jersey in a video posted to social media two days before Halloween, when the club wore the kits in a 1-0 loss to ACF Fiorentina. 🌑 The Ǥøłđɇn̷ Dark side of Genoa ✨✍️ Noi non siamo come nessun altro.

As part of the series, the Nets will take on the alternate identity of “Les Nets” during their six Quebec-based games. The team’s temporary red-and-blue logo features two fleur-de-lis on a blue circle, a nod to the Quebec flag. A large red circle within the blue includes Montreal’s Mount Royal cross, stylized to represent a basketball while incorporating the city name. The incorporation of red isn’t because the Long Island Nets typically use red (I mean, of course, it is); it’s a tribute to Montreal’s McGill University, where James Naismith, the inventor of basketball, taught in the 1880s. “Montreal has a vibrant basketball legacy, and this partnership presents a unique opportunity to blend our culture with the Laval community,” said Morgan Taylor, Head of Business Operations for the Long Island Nets, in the press release. “We look forward to engaging with a new fanbase and creating memorable moments both on and off the court.” The arrangement brings up memories of the unique situation Minor League Baseball’s Buffalo Bisons found themselves in during the 2021 season.

FC Barcelona announced the new “multi-year partnership agreement” on their website on Saturday, November 9. The club said the deal “brings a new collaborative strategic partnership model between the two organizations.” This new partnership consolidates Nike as a Main Partner of the Club and Official Technical Partner across all professional and amateur teams, bringing a unique model that strengthens the brands association and fuels the global retail and licensing business growth. Nike has a key strategic role in the Club’s Retail Operations and together with Barça Licensing & Merchandising will join forces in the development of specific plans related to product creation, supply chain and global distribution.   Nike has outfitted Barça since 1998. Since then, Barça’s men’s first team has won four Champions League titles, 12 La Liga titles, seven Copas del Rey, three World Club Cups and three European Super Cups wearing Nike uniforms, while the women’s first team has won nine league titles, three UEFA Women’s Champions League titles and nine Copas de la Reina in that time. The terms of the deal between Barça and Nike were not disclosed in Saturday’s announcement, but ESPN reports “the deal will total significantly more than €100 million ($107m) per year, but that the agreement is incremental and that the total amount is also dependent on certain add-ons.” They also report that Barça president Joan Laporte has previously claimed it would be the biggest deal of its kind in world soccer. According to Mundo Deportivo, Barça will receive €1.7 billion over 14 years, or about €121 million per year. It also includes a signing bonus of €158 million, which will also be spread over the 14 years of the contract. Mundo Deportivo also reports that Barça was allowed to field offers from other companies, and they did receive a proposal from German sportswear brand Puma, which Nike then matched. The previous contract between Nike and Barça was set to expire in 2024. There was some friction between the two sides earlier this year, with Footy Headlines reporting in July that a Spanish court had blocked Barça’s attempted to end their contract early. They also reported that retailers were having a hard time ordering Barcelona products from Nike, and Barça’s 2024-25 third kit celebrating women’s sport was released about three weeks later than similar third kits for other high-profile clubs outfitted by Nike."

The Smokies, who play in the Southern League, announced this week that with their return to their once and future hometown, the team will change its geographic designation from Tennessee to Knoxville. With that announcement came an armful of updated logos—though their familiar bear character, originally created by Dan Simon of Studio Simon in 2015, remains largely unchanged. The new suite of logos, design in house, includes a series of type-based marks as well as an alternate mark featuring three stars from the Tennessee state flag. “With the upcoming move to Knoxville, it is imperative to embrace our new home, while maintaining the Smokies brand,” said Boyd Sports President Chris Allen, quoted on MiLB.com. “It is our desire that the new logo honors the city of Knoxville and the rich tradition of Smokies Baseball.” The franchise played in Knoxville from 1921 to 1999 under a handful of names, including the Pioneers (1921–1924), Sox (1972–1979), Blue Jays (1980–1992), and two stints as the Knoxville Smokies (1925–1967 and 1993–1999). After the 1999 season, the team moved 20 miles east to the town of Kodak, where they played from 2000 to 2024 as the Tennessee Smokies. The Smokies will play at a new ballpark, Covenant Health Ballpark, set to open in 2025."

New look from a familiar era. Get your City Edition Jersey 11.14.24 pic.twitter.com/svaZdznsxa The white uniforms feature a slanted “H-Town” wordmark across the chest that is inspired by the uniforms worn by Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler during those championships seasons, particularly the lowercase “t.” The red and blue striping pattern on the collar, shoulders, sides of the jerseys and – most notably – around the shorts mirrors the shape and trimming of the Rockets’ championship banners, which hang in the rafters at Toyota Center. The logo on the side of the shorts matches the center-court logo at The Summit, Houston’s home from 1975-2003. It was where the Rockets clinched their titles with a Game 7 victory over the New York Knicks in 1994 and a sweep of the Orlando Magic in 1995. The logo matches Houston’s primary logo at the time, but also includes a “Summit” wordmark at the bottom. The Summit’s logo – which is reminiscent of the Portland Trail Blazers’ logo – can also be seen in gold on the waistband of the shorts, matching the Nike swoosh on the shoulder and hip. The uniforms are complete with Olajuwon and Drexler’s signatures and a “Believe It! Again!” wordmark, which is a nod to the team’s rally cry during their second title run, above the jock tag. This marks the second straight year the Hall of Famers’ signatures are included in Houston’s City Edition design. The Rockets will wear their new City Edition uniforms 13 times this season, including against the Indiana Pacers on Nov. 20, Blazers on Nov. 23, Minnesota Timberwolves on Dec. 27, Los Angeles Lakers on Jan. 5, Phoenix Suns on Feb. 13, Golden State Warriors on Feb. 13, Milwaukee Bucks on Feb. 25, San Antonio Spurs on Feb. 26, Magic on March 10, Suns on March 12, Philadelphia 76ers on March 17, Denver Nuggets on March 23 and Oklahoma City Thunder on April 4."

The Rangers unveiled the jerseys on their website and social media accounts on Friday, November 8, making this the 19th straight season the team has produced a Remembrance Day jersey. This year’s edition commemorates the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Normandy — better known as D-Day — which took place on June 6, 1944. The base of the jersey is royal blue, with grey, red and white stripes around each sleeve and the waist. The front of the jersey features a shield “based on imagery of soldiers entering the battle on the beaches of Normandy,” according to the Rangers’ website. Above the blue soldier rushing off a landing craft is the inscription “1944-2024”, while three red maple leaves swirl around the soldier. The 1944 Battle of Normandy was one of the pivotal events of the Second World War and the scene of some of Canada’s greatest feats of arms. Canadian sailors, soldiers and airmen played a critical role in the Allied invasion of Normandy, also called Operation Overlord, beginning the bloody campaign to liberate Western Europe from Nazi occupation. Nearly 150,000 Allied troops landed or parachuted into the invasion area on D-Day, including 14,000 Canadians at Juno Beach. The Royal Canadian Navy contributed 124 vessels and 10,000 sailors and the Royal Canadian Air Force contributed 39 squadrons to the operation. Total Allied casualties on D-Day reached more than 10,000, including 1,096 Canadians, of whom 381 were killed in action. By the end of the Battle of Normandy, the Allies had suffered 209,000 casualties, including more than 18,700 Canadians. Over 5,000 Canadian soldiers died. A poppy sits on the left chest of the jersey as a symbol of remembrance honoring armed forces personnel who have died in conflict. The left shoulder has a “D-DAY 80” logo while the Rangers’ primary logo sits on the right shoulder. The jersey was pictured with blue pants, gloves and helmets in photos released with Friday’s announcement. The socks are also blue with the same striping as found on the sleeves. The Rangers will wear their Remembrance Day jerseys tonight (Friday, November 8) when they host the Soo Greyhounds at the Kitchener Memorial Auditorium. It’s their only home game this Remembrance Day weekend, as they visit the Owen Sound Attack on Saturday and the Oshawa Generals on Sunday. Rangers fans can purchase game-worn Remembrance Day jerseys through a silent auction that will run throughout Friday’s game. Five of the jerseys will also be available for auction online through DASH. Proceeds from both auctions will benefit the 78th Fraser Highlanders Fort Conestoga Garrison and the Kitchener-Waterloo Poppy Fund."

The Moose unveiled the jersey on their website and social media channels on Thursday, November 7, and they’ll wear them on the ice for the first time on Saturday, November 23, when they host the Chicago Wolves. The focal point of the jerseys is the team’s classic “Happy Moose” logo, which appears on the front of the jersey recolored in the team’s current color palette. The Moose used a green and purple version of this logo when they were members of the International Hockey League from 1996 to 2001, and then a green and black version from 2001, when they moved to the AHL, until 2005. In 2011, the Winnipeg Jets brought NHL hockey back to the city, meaning the Moose moved to St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, where they were renamed the St. John’s IceCaps. But in 2015, the team moved back to Winnipeg and the Moose name and logo were revived, but the logo was recolored to match the Jets’ palette. The base of the 25th season celebration jersey is bright blue, with a navy blue collar and shoulder yoke. Navy blue, silver and white stripes run around each sleeve and the waist. The front of the jersey also includes a “25 SEASONS” patch with a map of Manitoba on the left chest. The Jets’ logo appears on the left shoulder, while an “MM” monogram appears on the right shoulder. “EST. 1996” is printed inside the collar. The numbers on the sleeves and back match those found on the Moose’s regular jerseys, with moose antlers built into the numerals. Along with the jerseys, the Moose also launched a line of 25th season merchandise on their online shop Thursday. This line includes hoodies, sweatshirts, caps, pucks and pins. The Moose will wear the 25th season celebration jerseys four times during the 2024-25 AHL regular season. At each of these games, the first 1,000 fans will receive one of four collector pins featuring either one of the team’s primary logos from past 25 years or the team’s 25th season logo.

The PWHL launched new jersey designs for all six of its clubs on Thursday, November 7, all manufactured by Bauer. The league’s press release from the league focused heavily on the dark jerseys that will be worn for home games, but light away jerseys — either white or off-white — were also included in some teams’ social media posts. After teams played the 2024 season using just their geographic names, the PWHL unveiled team names and logos in early September. The teams retained the primary colours they wore during the PWHL’s inaugural season, though some added additional colours. “Players and fans alike have been waiting for this moment and we couldn’t be happier with the six unique looks each team will don moving forward,” said Amy Scheer, PWHL Senior Vice President of Business Operations, on the league’s website. “These jerseys mark the latest evolution in our league’s history, and we can’t wait to see them showcased both on the ice and in the stands.”  Each team will have contrasting shoulder yokes, with the PWHL logo on the right shoulder and space for advertising patches on the left shoulder and right chest. Each team also has an insert at the front of the collar with the PWHL logo inside. Teams will all use the same block number font, but each will have small team-specific icons in the numbers. Each jersey incorporates elements that embody the spirit of the team, all while supporting athletes on the ice with advanced materials and construction. Through a series of design sessions, unique elements such as stripe size, number style, and the crest were meticulously developed to enhance their identities. Crafted from breathable and durable fabrics, these jerseys are engineered to withstand intense physical play and offer a tailored fit for maximum mobility, comfort, and aesthetic appeal. The PWHL worked closely with Creative Agency Flower Shop in creating the jersey designs as part of the overall team brand identity work.  The jersey design process was led by PWHL Vice President of Brand and Marketing Kanan Bhatt-Shah and done in collaboration with New York-based creative agency Flower Shop, which also worked on the team names and logos. Here’s a closer look at the new jerseys and what the league had to say about them in Thursday’s announcement: Anchored by the team’s signature “B” across the chest, the Fleet’s home jersey features a deep green base, complemented by oceanic blue accents on the shoulders, sleeve stripes, and waist. The classic hockey design incorporates alternating bands of color, forming a wave-like pattern that evokes a strong connection to the sea. The numbers on Boston’s jersey carry a unique wave motif inspired by the crest, further reinforcing its maritime heritage.  The Frost’s home jersey embraces the chill with a deep purple base that channels the spirit of Minnesota winters. White accents on the shoulders, arms, and waist add a crisp, icy contrast, capturing the sharpness of the frozen landscape. Light purple details introduce a modern touch, blending seamlessly to create a layered, frosted look that embodies both the intensity and elegance of the Frost on the ice. The jersey numbers feature a motif inspired by the shape of the team’s crest, bringing a distinct edge to the design.  Anchored by the burgundy base, the Victoire’s home jersey reflects Montréal’s timeless elegance and strength. The navy shoulders and dynamic sleeve design draw inspiration from the angular lines of the team’s crest, adding a sense of movement and precision. A bright blue stripe accents the overall design, providing a vivid contrast while maintaining a classic style that honors the heritage of both the city and team. The jersey numbers are adorned with a Fleur-de-lys motif, reinforcing Montréal’s cultural pride.  Inspired by the hexagonal shape of their team crest, the Sirens’ home jersey captures the spirit of New York’s multifaceted energy. Angular sleeve stripes, echoing the crest’s geometric form, combine the city’s signature navy, orange, and grey hues, creating a striking, modern motif. The lower waist reflects the same hexagonal pattern, grounding the design in New York’s intense and dynamic identity. The numbers on New York’s jersey feature linework inspired by sound vibrations, echoing the city’s constant hum and buzz.  The Charge’s home jersey energizes the ice with its vibrant red base, embodying Ottawa’s unyielding drive. Dark and light grey bands run across the sleeves and waist, adding depth and a sense of momentum, while a bold pop of electric yellow pulses through the design. The overall look captures the energy and intensity that defines the Charge’s fierce presence on the ice. Custom numbers on the jersey incorporate small electrical charges, adding a spark to the back of the jersey.  The Sceptres’ home jersey reflects a modern, confident Toronto, with a rich blue base that captures the city’s leadership and pride. Navy paneling along the sleeves and waist brings depth and contrast, while clean, precise yellow lines and a matching collar add sharp, dynamic details. The striking gold and yellow of the team crest stands out, creating a look with bold presence, embodying the energy and spirit of Toronto fans. Custom numbers nod to the Sceptres’ crest design. Last season, the PWHL ran a pilot project during which Molson Breweries paid to place its logo on the upper back of jerseys, allowing nameplates to be placed under the numbers where they wouldn’t be covered by players’ long hair. Based on the photos released with Thursday’s announcement, it appears this pilot project will not continue in the upcoming season. PWHL home jerseys are available to buy now on the league’s official online shop. They’ll be available through Bauer’s website and key retailers starting on Thursday, November 14. The 2024-25 PWHL regular season begins on Saturday, November 30, when the Boston Fleet visit the Toronto Sceptres at the Coca-Cola Coliseum at 2 p.m. ET. Later that same day is an all-Canadian matchup between the Ottawa Charge and the Victoire de Montréal at Place Bell in Laval, Quebec. The defending champion Minnesota Frost open their season on Sunday, December 1, when they host the New York Sirens at the Xcel Energy Center."

The Crows launched the new logo on their website and social media channels on Wednesday, November 6. It depicts the full body of a navy blue swooping crow — a throwback to previous logos in the club’s history and a stark contrast to the most recent iteration of their logo, which only depicted a crow’s head — with a gold outline, red and gold streaks in the wings and a red eye. The angles of the logo are sharper than the previous version, and the color scheme returns to the club’s “original bolder colors,” including a darker shade of navy blue, a “richer” red and a “deeper” gold. The logo is a celebration of the Club being born from the state’s thriving football landscape in 1990, with the wing of the Crow emanating from the actual shape of South Australia. In a further change, the word ‘Adelaide’ now solely sits below the crow and reinforces the connection between the Club, the city and state.  The new Crows logo was developed in partnership with Fuller Brand Communication, a creative agency based in South Australia. The process involved “widespread consultation with members, supporters and focus groups, such as the Member Engagement Panel.” The Crows’ logo was last revamped in 2010. Their first crest upon joining the AFL in 1991 featured a crow with swooping red, yellow and blue lines behind it inside a white shield with a red outline; “ADELAIDE” and “CROWS” were written out above the crow in yellow on a navy background. In 1996, the writing was changed to emphasize the city name. Then, from 1999-2009, the club ditched the shield and used the crow with the swooping lines behind on its own, with the team name in navy underneath. “The logo is one of the Club’s most recognisable features and our supporters take great pride in it, and the throwback to the original swooping Crow reinforces our connection to this city and state by the way it now incorporates the actual shape of South Australia,” said Crows CEO Tim Silvers on the team’s website. “We also wanted to make sure we celebrated our heritage but with a modern look and feel, which we think will resonate with our next generation of supporters. We’ve consulted and listened to a wide range of stakeholders, including and most importantly sections of our supporter base, over the past 18 months.  “Now is the perfect time to make this change as our new headquarters at Thebarton Oval is moving closer and closer to reality, so it really is the start of a new era.”  New guernseys were not unveiled as part of Wednesday’s announcement. But merchandise with the new logo is already available on the Crows’ official website and at the team shop in the Adelaide suburb of West Lakes. The Crows are the first of three teams who were reported to be unveiling new logos this offseason to do so. The other two teams named in an article on the AFL website in August are St. Kilda Football Club and Gold Coast Suns."

Napoli unveiled the new kits on Saturday, November 2, and wore them the following day in a match at home against Atalanta. The predominantly dark grey kit is inspired by Japanese culture and the twinning of Naples and Kagoshima, Japan, which have been sister cities since 1960. The tonal pattern on the kit is a mixture of Japanese and Italian artistic styles. It includes several Samurai objects — including the kabuto (helmet), the menpo (mask) and the katana sword — while melding a Japanese wave motif with a Neopolitan baroque style. Down the right side of the shirt are Japanese characters representing the seven Bushido virtues that are the principles of the Samurai: righteousness, respect, courage, honor, compassion, honesty and loyalty. Despite being so far away from each other, the twinning of the two ports is a symbol of their affinity and the unique characteristics that they share, from the gulfs to the volcanos that dominate the landscape: Vesuvius in Naples and Sakurajima in Kagoshima. The friendship between the two cities has led both of them to dedicate street names to each other: “Napoli-dori” (Naples street) in Kagoshima and “Via Kagoshima” in Naples. The collar, side panels and sleeve cuffs feature black trim, while the Napoli crest and sponsor logos on the chest are light blue. The kit was designed in collaboration with the Ten Shin – Cuore di Cielo Puro Soto Zen Temple in Naples and the Samurai Academy Naples. “The third kit perfectly places itself at the heart of our project ‘From Napoli to the World,’” said Tommaso Bianchini, the club’s chief revenue officer. “Starting in Naples, we arrive at the Japanese city of Kagoshima to tell the story of the relationship between these two distant cultures that are linked by a warrior’s spirit. With this shirt, we celebrate strength, respect and loyalty, which are values that we proudly bring onto the pitch.” Napoli’s next Serie A match is on Sunday, November 10, when they travel to the San Siro to face defending champions Inter Milan."

The wordmark and number font on the off-white uniforms matches the signage seen around the United Center, including gate and seat numbers, while the overall color scheme was based on the exterior of the building, with shades of brown, gray and white.  Details steeped in history.@MotorolaUS | https://t.co/PqhESWUXtq pic.twitter.com/ZyZc75upU7 The design across the shoulders and down the sides of the shorts are supposed to mimic in-arena lights during the Bulls’ starting lineup introductions, while the logo on the waistband pulls inspiration from the windows near the top of the United Center’s walls. The uniforms are complete with the Bulls’ iconic diamond-shaped shorts design and a uniquely shaped logo above the jock tag on the jersey, which pays homage to the original marquee that stood outside of the arena and read “Home of The Bulls.” Chicago will wear its new City Edition uniforms eight times this season, including games against the Memphis Grizzlies on Nov. 23, Boston Celtics n Dec. 21, Milwaukee Bucks on Dec. 28, New York Knicks on Jan. 4, Philadelphia 76ers on Jan. 25, Golden State Warriors on Feb. 8, Phoenix Suns on Feb. 22 and Dallas Mavericks on March 29. The Bulls’ 2023-24 City Edition uniforms, meanwhile, were inspired by the old Chicago Stadium, which stood on the Near West Side for nearly 60 years before it was replaced by the United Center in 1994 and was affectionally referred to as the “Madhouse on Madison.”"

The club officially announced today that they are now known simply as Athletics. The new location-less name will stick for as long as the team plays in Sacramento, which looks like it will be for the next three seasons before they move to Las Vegas, where *I assume* they’ll be known as the Las Vegas Athletics. Once they take the field, this will be the first time in North America’s “Big Four” major sports leagues that a team has officially played a game without a location name in 80 years. The closest we saw to this in recent times was when the Anaheim Angels became the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and spent the next decade referring to themselves only as the Angels in just about everything aside from their preferred abbreviation, “LAA.” There’s really no obvious reason for the Athletics to go this route. The team already owns the trademarks for both Sacramento Athletics and Sacramento A’s. They could’ve proceeded just as the Angels did previously and reserved the use of Sacramento for standings and scoreboards while sticking to “Athletics” on their uniforms and all official releases. Along with the official name change came the official primary logo the Athletics will use while playing in Sacramento. There’s no surprise here; they’ll use just the “A’s” portion of Oakland’s logo, removing the green circle and the team name. Club officials had previously revealed the team’s uniforms would remain largely the same when they shifted to Sacramento, with all the “Oakland” logos replaced with “Athletics.” This would mean changes only to their road greys and Kelly green alternate jerseys. According to a post from @EvanDrellich on Twitter, the Athletics request the following: The club should be referred to only as “Athletics,” with the shorthand “A’s” allowed only after they’ve already been called Athletics. The team abbreviation will now be “ATH,” so you’ll see this on the TV scoreboards instead of “OAK” going forward. The A’s also do *not* play in Sacramento (my bad); they play in *West* Sacramento (maybe this is why they didn’t go with Sacramento Athletics?). They also mentioned the change, as I discussed earlier, to their primary logo. The name change has already been reflected in the club’s online presence. The team is now listed second alphabetically between Arizona and Atlanta, appearing only as “Athletics” on MLB.com’s team selection list as well as their online shop at MLBShop.com. The team’s official Twitter and Instagram accounts also have removed all references to Oakland."
Sporting News RSS,Phillies expected to target $426M nine-time Silver Slugger ‘first and foremost’,https://www.sportingnews.com/us/mlb/philadelphia-phillies/news/phillies-expected-target-426m-nine-time-silver-slugger-first-and-foremost/d692c4bf1a5f5434cb7417c0,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 14:15:42 +0000",The Philadelphia Phillies have been projected to prioritize a three-time MVP and 11-time All-Star as their blockbuster trade target.,"Peter Chawaga The Philadelphia Phillies might have one last chance to build this era’s World Series roster. Going into 2025 with baseball’s largest payroll at more than $222 million, the Phillies could see J.T. Realmuto, Kyle Schwarber, Ranger Suárez or other key members depart in free agency after next season. And they might see the production of veterans like Bryce Harper, Zack Wheeler or Trea Turner decline. So there’s reason to believe the front office will be aggressive in making some additions this winter. Reflecting on the team’s biggest needs for FanSided, Nick Villano projected that their first priority could be checking in on a blockbuster trade candidate. “There’s also the trade route, and if that’s the case, the Phillies will make one phone call first and foremost,” he wrote. “The Phillies want Mike Trout to come home as bad as anyone. Trout grew up in South Jersey, which is basically just East Philadelphia. Trout has said he doesn’t want to be traded, but moving home could change his mind. It’s very much a hypothetical, but the timing hasn’t felt as right as it does right now.” The Phillies could be prioritizing an offensive outfield upgrade, as the likes of Johan Rojas, Brandon Marsh, Austin Hays and Weston Wilson haven’t provided much offensive power. If Trout can maintain his health into a postseason run, he could certainly provide some additional production at the plate. In 14 big-league seasons with the Los Angeles Angels, Trout has slashed .299/.410/.581, earned 11 All-Star nods, nine Silver Slugger Awards and three Most Valuable Player Awards. Now entering his seventh year of a 12-year, $426.5 million contract, he has rarely been healthy in the last few seasons and has only seen three total playoff games. As a result, the asking price in a trade for Trout might not be too steep. If the Phillies feel like he can stay healthy enough to be a factor in the playoffs, a trade to acquire him could make sense. It certainly helps that Trout grew up as a Philadelphia sports fan. In any case, with their championship window closing, the pressure is on the Phillies to make some kind of significant additions this winter. “As a true MLB contender, the Philadelphia Phillies could do a lot of things to upgrade their roster,” Villano added. “They are in the ultra-competitive National League, so there’s no room to sit on their hands this offseason.” More MLB: Blue Jays predicted to add two-time All-Star in $160 million blockbuster Peter Chawaga is a veteran journalist covering Major League Baseball for The Sporting News.

Recently, Bowers got recognition by a national outlet for his standout performance.","Mike Moraitis There haven't been too many bright spots for the Las Vegas Raiders this season, but rookie tight end Brock Bowers has most definitely been one of the few. Bowers hasn't just been the best rookie tight end, he's been one of the best tight ends in the entire NFL. The Georgia product currently leads the position in receiving yards (580) and is second in receptions (57). Making his season more impressive, the Raiders have had incompetent quarterback play all season long. One can only imagine what Bowers would've done with a better situation under center. Hopefully we get to see that in the years ahead. In a recent article ranking the best rookies in the NFL entering Week 11, Bowers was placed in the No. 2 spot by ESPN. He trails only Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels, which is understandable. Bowers ranks seventh in the league in receptions among all pass catchers, despite playing in an offense that has used three different quarterbacks. The only tight end with more catches than him is Travis Kelce, who has 80 fewer receiving yards. Bowers has 18 more receptions and 150 more receiving yards than the next-best Raiders player, along with the team's longest touchdown reception: 57 yards against the Broncos in Week 5. If there's one thing we can praise general manager Tom Telesco for, it's that he looks to have nailed his first three picks with the Raiders. Along with Bowers, who was drafted in the first round, Las Vegas has seen promising performances from second-round pick and guard Jackson Powers-Johnson, and third-round pick and tackle, DJ Glaze, which at least gives the Raiders a foundation on offense. Now, Telesco has to strike gold with a quarterback in next year's draft, and right now he's in a good position to do so, with the Raiders owning the No. 5 pick in the 2025 NFL Draft order entering Week 11, per Tankathon. But there's still a long way to go and plenty of time for the Raiders to mess it up.

Mudryk was a big money signing for the Blues in 2023, but his time in England so far has been challenging. Now, Football Transfers' Steve Kay is reporting serious interest from Palace in giving the Ukrainian a chance to find his footing in the EPL via regular play time and less overall team pressure. Palace are still looking for someone to fill the Wilfried Zaha-sized hole in their attacking setup after he left for Galatasaray in '23, while the club are still looking to properly replace young star Michael Olise, with the striker joining Bayern Munich this past summer. The switch would, as a result, pretty much guarantee Mudryk more minutes, with Pedro Neto, Noni Madueke, and Jadon Sancho all above him in Enzo Maresca's current pecking order.

He has had HIGHER than 110 rush + receiving yards in three of his last four games, going LOWER only last week. Barkley didn't have another huge game largely because the Eagles blew the Cowboys out, and he did not play much in the second half. He had a combined 15 rushes and receptions in Dallas, and with tonight's matchup likely to be much closer, he figures to get more touches. Robinson Jr. has been solid this season but missed the last two games with a nagging hamstring injury. In his first game back, it wouldn't be surprising for his touches to be limited. The other Commanders running backs have played well in his absence, so he likely won't get enough carries or targets to hit the HIGHER mark, especially against an Eagles defense that has not allowed an opposing running back to go for HIGHER than 60 yards in its last six games. At 34 years old, Ertz is having a resurgent season, on pace to have his best year since his time in Philadelphia. He has become a safety outlet for Commanders rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels. Ertz is second on the team in targets and receptions and has gone HIGHER than 3.5 receptions in four of his last five games.

Joseph is in the midst of his best year as a pro and is on the cusp of becoming a superstar.","Mike Moraitis The Detroit Lions' defense has been much-improved this season, and in the secondary in particular, where several players have shined. One of those players is no doubt safety Kerby Joseph, who is on the verge of superstardom in his third campaign. Joseph currently has elite numbers in coverage, posting a completion rate allowed of 45.8% and passer rating allowed of just 26.0, both career-highs. His 90.8 Pro Football Focus coverage grade is also a personal best, and it ranks No. 1 in the NFL among both cornerbacks and safeties. As if all that wasn't enough, Joseph has been an interception machine, and many of those picks have come in key moments of games. The former third-round pick has six in nine games, which is two more than any season of his career. Furthermore, Joseph has totaled eight passes defensed, just three fewer than his career-high. In the midst of a sensational season, NFL Network's Kevin Patra believes Joseph is going to earn his first Pro Bowl nod in 2024. ""You could toss several Lions secondary players on this list, but Joseph's consistent play, coupled with an uncanny Johnny-on-the-spot ability, takes the cake,"" Patra wrote. ""The safety's six interceptions are tied for the NFL lead, most of which have come in massive spots or changed games. It's not just those moments when Joseph has shined. His -39.1 target EPA is by far the lowest among all safeties (Xavier McKinney is next at -20.8). He's allowed a 20.2 quarterback rating as the nearest defender, the lowest among all DBs, and his 45 percent completion rate allowed is the third-lowest (minimum 200 coverage snaps). The former third-round pick has grown into the glue of Aaron Glenn's secondary and enables the rest of the operation to play physical up front."" Later is his write-up, Patra adds that fellow safety Brian Branch should also be considered, and he'd be right. Branch has been an absolute menace this season. Along with his 50 tackles that include three for loss, Branch has a whopping 13 passes defensed, which is the second-most in the NFL. With Branch and Joseph, the Lions have the best safety duo in the NFL. It wouldn't be at all surprising to see both Detroit defenders earn Pro Bowl nods when it's all said and done.

After a disappointing 2024 campaign and with franchise slugger Vladimir Guerrero Jr. entering his final year of arbitration eligibility, this could be the team’s final chance to craft a winning roster around its current core before being forced into an extensive rebuild. Signaling their interest in fortifying the roster around Guerrero, the Blue Jays have joined the running to sign superstar slugger Juan Soto this winter.  “Soto is starting to take meetings with teams this week in California, and the Blue Jays will be first, according to major league sources,” ESPN’s Jeff Passan reported. “After trying to land Shohei Ohtani last winter, Toronto is serious about adding a star alongside Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and has targeted Soto.” While adding Soto on a long-term deal would instantly boost the Blue Jays’ chances of contention, a championship run would require some additional firepower. To that end, Zachary Rymer of Bleacher Report predicted that the Blue Jays would add veteran southpaw Max Fried on a six-year, $160 million deal. “Even though he’s a two-time All-Star and World Series champion, he might still be underrated,” Rymer wrote. “He’s been 51 percent better than the average pitcher over the last five seasons, and that is over a sturdy 659 innings. He doesn’t hurt himself with walks and doesn’t make it easy for batters to do damage. He’s typically good for a strikeout per inning, and he was in the 96th percentile for ground balls and the 95th for exit velocity this year.” After eight seasons with the Atlanta Braves, the 30-year-old Fried has reached free agency after an All-Star 2024 with a 3.25 ERA, two complete games and a shutout in 29 starts. He would add a critical lefty look to a veteran Blue Jays rotation that is set to include Kevin Gausman, José Berríos and Chris Bassit next year. After the Blue Jays dealt Yusei Kikuchi at the 2024 trade deadline, they could use another reliable starter. As one of the best pitchers on the market, Fried is going to command a long-term contract in the nine-figure range. The Blue Jays are hoping to lock up Soto while having the financial flexibility to extend Guerrero to a long-term deal, but they are relatively free of other long-term contracts, so it could work. “Toronto, of course, hopes to extend the aforementioned Guerrero and would need a massive offer to do so, but a long-term payroll ledger with Soto and Guerrero seems plenty doable given the lack of other commitments,” per MLB Trade Rumors.

Forlan won a doubles title on the ITF senior tour earlier this year in Lima, but his wildcard invitation to the Uruguay Open on the ATP Challenger Tour ended at the first hurdle. He and Argentine partner Federico Coria lost in straight sets, 6-1 6-2, to Bolivia duo Boris Arias and Federico Zeballos, one level beneath the main ATP Tour. A solid first game of the match for the ex-footballer and his partner saw them hold serve, but that serve was broken in the third game as the Bolivians used their experience advantage to dominate from there and take the first set. And things did not improve much in the second, outside of a slightly more competitive scoreline, with the match concluding in a total of just 49 minutes. Forlan, nonetheless, seemed very pleased with the experience and particularly impressed by the strong turnout of fans in Forlan football jerseys. ""I know my limitations,"" he said post-match. ""I'm grateful for the opportunity to play with Fede. It's not easy for him to enter these tournaments with an amateur beside him. ""I hadn't even imagined, let alone dreamed of this. It's wonderful to have played against professionals – it takes courage to do it. ""I'll take with me a few volleys, a good smash, and some forehands during the exchanges.

After an impressive debut in Week 10 against the Washington Commanders, one NFL insider believes Smith is destined for a breakout second half.","Mike Moraitis The Pittsburgh Steelers added some depth along the edge ahead of the NFL trade deadline when the team struck a deal with the Green Bay Packers for Preston Smith. While all the attention was on the Steelers' need at wide receiver, general manager Omar Khan had more up his sleeve. And, it's a good thing he did, as the Steelers recently lost Alex Highsmith to a potential multi-week injury. Smith wasted no time making an impact in his debut, with the veteran edge rusher tallying three tackles, including two tackles for loss, and one sack. Safe to say, his performance has created a fair amount of hype for what he can do moving forward. Smith's debut has caught the attention of the national media. In fact, ESPN's Dan Graziano now believes that Smith is primed for a breakout second half of the season. ""Preston Smith was an under-the-radar add for the Steelers, but with Alex Highsmith injured again, Smith could get some high-leverage pass-rush opportunities while offenses focus on trying to stop T.J. Watt,"" Graziano wrote. Smith has always been a highly productive edge rusher during his career, but things changed in Green Bay this season after the team made a switch from a 3-4 to a 4-3 defense. Smith felt that was a bad fit for him, something he revealed after being traded to Pittsburgh, where he'll be back in a 3-4. ""It was great,"" Smith said of joining the Steelers, according to Chris Adamski of TribLive.com. ""Just getting out here, getting back in a system I'm comfortable being in and playing at a high level, I'm loving it right now."" ""It's just what I've been playing in the last nine years of my career, until this season,"" he explained. ""It's what I was comfortable playing in, and what I got used to playing in the previous nine seasons. So, just being back in the system is like riding your favorite bike again."" Smith was good for eight or more sacks in three of the past four years, including a career-best 12 in 2019. Now that he's in the right system, and with the injury to Highsmith, Smith is primed to explode over the next eight games.

Even after adding Tyler Glasnow, Yoshinobu Yamamoto and other impact starters to their staff, the team went into the playoffs with several crucial arms sidelined by injury and ultimately cobbled together their World Series run without a dominant rotation. With Shohei Ohtani likely returning to the mound and their other frontline starters coming back healthy, the Dodgers can hope to avoid those rotation stresses next year without making any more blockbuster additions. But if they do make good on a prediction from Dayn Perry of CBS Sports, who sees L.A. as the landing spot for free-agent ace Corbin Burnes, they will add some serious pitching insurance. “I don’t entirely buy that the Dodgers will be heavily in on Juan Soto, but I do think they’ll make a notable addition in the service of repeating as World Series champs,” Perry wrote. “They have some rotation uncertainties going into next year, and as the 2024 Dodgers acutely reminded us ‘rotation depth’ can be a fleeting thing. Burnes is an ace and about as much of a known quantity as a starting pitcher can be these days.” After joining the Baltimore Orioles in a winter trade ahead of the 2024 season, Burnes went on to post his fourth-consecutive campaign with at least 28 starts. He maintained a 2.92 ERA with 181 strikeouts across 194.1 innings and earned his fourth career All-Star nod. Given his durability and effectiveness at a premier position, Burnes is going to earn a major long-term deal in free agency, wherever he ultimately lands. Jon Heyman of The New York Post projected a seven-year, $210 million contract for Burnes, noting the depth of competition for his services. “The Orioles will try to keep him, but it will probably be hard with at least the Yankees, Mets and other big teams involved,” per Heyman. “All the high-revenue AL East teams plus the Giants and Dodgers are expected to play for the Southern California product.” If the Dodgers do come out on top in signing Burnes, they will add yet another high-impact arm to their rotation. But he stands to be the most likely one on the team’s staff to make all of his starts and pitch well into the postseason.  More MLB: Padres projected as blockbuster trade fit for Garret Crochet, on one condition Peter Chawaga is a veteran journalist covering Major League Baseball for The Sporting News.

The team suffered its seventh defeat of the campaign to the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 10 and has lost four of its last five games.  One of the primary reasons for Tennessee's struggles in 2024 has been the abysmal quarterback play. Will Levis has regressed after showing flashes during his rookie season, while Mason Rudolph is just a serviceable quarterback who isn't capable of being a long-term starter.  The Titans will be in the quarterback market in the offseason, and though drafting a signal-caller in the 2025 NFL Draft seems like the obvious move, ESPN's Jeremy Fowler predicts general manager Ran Carthon will make a move for Minnesota Vikings veteran Sam Darnold. ""Let's go with the Titans. I've identified at least six teams that either need a bridge quarterback or could entertain the notion soon. The Titans are in the latter category,"" Fowler wrote. Will Levis has the next eight games to show he can be the long-term answer at quarterback. Maybe he proves the Titans right. But if his penchant for interceptions reemerges, the Titans will need contingencies in 2025. ""Darnold is a proven commodity who would give Tennessee a bridge starter option while it continues to develop Levis or selects a quarterback high in the 2025 draft. So in this scenario, he would be the starter for coach Brian Callahan."" Darnold has revived his broken career in 2024, as the 2018 No. 3 overall pick has flourished in Kevin O'Connell's offense and is playing the best football of his life. The former Jet has tossed 17 touchdowns to 10 interceptions with a 99.2 passer rating and has led Minnesota to a 7-2 record through nine contests. Though Darnold has been exceptional, the Titans should avoid signing him to a lucrative deal in free agency. The 27-year-old still has a low ceiling and wouldn't be the long-term answer for the position in Tennessee. It's time for the franchise to use a premium draft choice on a young signal-caller and avoid going the veteran quarterback route once again.  A football fan who started his own website to talk about the Tennessee Titans, Dharya Sharma is an up-and-coming sports writer from Nebraska contributing to NFL content for TSN.

Argentina currently lead the South American qualification table despite the odd wobble so far, but will want to avoid any further slip-ups to ensure a strong finish towards the defence of their 2022 crown. Paraguay, meanwhile, have recently moved into the sixth and final qualification berth and know a win at home to one of their strongest rivals will go a long way towards sealing their participation. MORE: All the latest soccer action | Lionel Messi news Ahead of the contest at Estadio Defensores del Chaco in Asuncion, Fernando Villasboa, manager of the Paraguayan Football Federation, announced the following: ""Fans wearing jerseys of the Argentine national team, Barcelona, PSG, or Inter Miami with Lionel Messi's name on the back will not be allowed entry to the stadium. ""It's not about Messi or any specific player. We respect the careers of all footballers. It's just that the home ground is very important to us."" The Paraguay team coach, Gustavo Alfaro, responded diplomatically to the news. ""I had no idea about that,"" he said. ""The idea, I think, is just to reduce any potential sources of conflict."" ""I hope Messi has the best game of his life against Peru-but not tomorrow."" The ban seems, as touched upon by Alfaro, to be related to a genuine fear that local fans will be more inclined to support global megastar Messi than their own country's team. Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni acknowleged this in response to the news, saying: ""Logically, for the Paraguayan footballer, for the fan, they all want to wear the national team shirt. ""But Leo [Messi] is stronger than all that, and there will be Argentina shirts. ""It doesn't mean they don't support Paraguay. I think it's good that football people recognize what he is. ""And it's not because you have a shirt that you become an Argentina fan."" Messi is with the Argentina squad, appears to be fully fit to play and as a result, is of course expected to be in the starting XI. The anticipation of his involvement may be what can trigger some Paraguay fans to show their love of Messi at the game, leading to the late decision by the hosts.

A look back at his collegiate career, starting at Arizona State and ending at LSU.","Morgan Moriarty Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels is well on his way to running away with the NFL's Rookie of the Year Award in 2024. On the season, he's thrown for 2,147 yards, run for 464 yards, and posted 13 total TDs to just two turnovers while leading the Commanders to a 7-4 start and putting them on pace for the franchise's best start since 2012.  As the legend of Daniels' young career continues to grow, many might want to learn more about his backstory and journey to becoming a No. 2 overall pick and rising NFL star. In college, Daniels' career actually started at Arizona State — not LSU, where he won the Heisman Trophy. Let's run through Daniels' college career and find out what made him into Washington's franchise quarterback. NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule Daniels played college football at both Arizona State and LSU. His collegiate journey started in his hometown of San Bernardino, Calif. The former 4-star recruit was the nation's No. 2 ranked dual-threat quarterback from the class of 2019.  Despite having offers from the likes of USC, Tennessee, Penn State, Ohio State, and several others, the signal-caller opted to play at Arizona State. Daniels stepped on campus as an early enrollee in Jan. 2019.  The QB committed to then-head coach Herm Edwards' class of 2019 as the highest-rated prospect in his class.  ""The team is young,"" Daniels said via The Arizona Republic of his decision to commit to ASU.  ""So, showing they play the younger freshmen, playing the best players. They want people that want to win and play at the next level, so just showing that, that’s something I want to be a part of."" The Sun Devils' coaching staff remained committed to playing young players after Daniels' arrival. The quarterback won the starting job before Arizona State's 2019 season as a true freshman.  ""He doesn't put the ball in jeopardy and he sees the field are the two main things,"" ASU offensive coordinator Rob Likens said of the decision. ""For his age and hasn't had a lot of experience in college except for spring practice, his ability to make quick decisions with the speed that is going on around him and his ability to adjust from the high school speed to the college speed was nothing I've ever seen before."" MORE: NFL playoff picture | NFL power rankings | Week 11 NFL picks | Week NFL picks against the spread Daniels' numbers were a bit of a mixed bag in Tempe. The Sun Devils also only played four games during the shortened COVID-19 season in 2020, too.  Season  Comp-Att Pass. Yards TDs INTs 2019 205-338 2,943 17 1 2020 49-84 701 5 1 2021 197-301 2,380 10 10 Over three seasons, he rushed for 1,288 yards with 13 touchdowns. Here's a look at how Arizona State fared in those three seasons:  His third and final season with the Sun Devils was overshadowed by some controversy surrounding the program. In June 2021, the NCAA placed Arizona State under investigation for having recruits on campus during a 2020 dead period. Although Daniels' mother, Regina, was tied to some of ASU's alleged recruiting violations, Daniels was said to be uninvolved and therefore was never disciplined or investigated by the NCAA.   In addition to the recruiting controversy and disappointing junior season, Arizona State's recruiting class struggled significantly, finishing 103rd overall as the Sun Devils lost 17 players to the transfer portal. Despite initially indicating that he would be returning, Daniels entered the transfer portal in Feb. 2022. ASU also had plenty of coaching turnover stemming from the NCAA investigation, including offensive coordinator Zak Hill's resignation.  At the time, Daniels was entering a pretty crowded quarterback room. Already on LSU's roster included then-redshirt freshman and current Tigers starting quarterback Garrett Nussmeier and true freshman Walker Howard. Sixth-year senior Myles Brennan was also expected to compete for the starting job, too. When fall camp arrived, the battle had narrowed down to Nussmeier and Daniels. Walker was expected to take a redshirt, and Brennan decided to walk away from football in what was an injury-riddled career for him.   Comp-Att Pass Yards TDs INTs Passer Rating Rush Yards Rushing TDs 236-327 3,812 40 4 208 1,134 10 Daniels helped lead LSU to a 10-win season and a berth in the SEC Championship Game. His numbers were similar to his first season at Arizona State. He finished 266-for-388 with 2,913 yards passing, 17 touchdowns, and just three interceptions. He rushed for 885 yards and 11 touchdowns, which were career-high numbers for him at the time. LSU finished 10-4, losing to Georgia in the SEC Championship game but beating Purdue in the Citrus Bowl. That was only a taste of what was to come. Daniels took the college football world by storm during his ""super senior"" season in 2023. He set numerous NCAA, school, and SEC records, including:  LSU finished 10-3 and won the ReliaQuest Bowl over Wisconsin. The Florida game pretty much won him the Heisman weeks before the award was handed out. Pretty much every single one of his plays in that game were jaw-dropping:  “If (Daniels) didn’t win (the Heisman Trophy) tonight, he has got to be the leading candidate,” LSU head coach Brian Kelly said after the game. “Unless the Heisman is just about popularity. If you want to be the most popular then fine, but he is the best player in college football. “He did something tonight that no one has ever done. If that doesn’t make you the leading candidate, then maybe the Heisman isn’t really for the best player.”Clearly, Heisman voters agreed. A few weeks later, Daniels took home the award, beating out fellow quarterback Michael Penix Jr. from Washington.    Morgan Moriarty joined The Sporting News as a content producer in the fall of 2024.

Rebilas-Imagn Images Surprising fight broke early Thursday morning when Red Corner MMA reported that Michael ‘Venom’ Page, aka MVP, will be moving up to 185-lbs to fight the brand new ranked middleweight, #14 Sharaputdin Magomedov, at the next UFC card in Saudi Arabia.  BREAKING: Shara Magomedov has agreed to face Michael ‘Venom’ Page in Saudi Arabia on February 1.Per his manager @Rizvan_RM pic.twitter.com/pOngqaKUsF Dagestan's one-eyed pirate Magomedov has made quite the splash since debuting in 2023, winning four straight middleweight bouts including a recent unprecedented double spinning backfist knockout over Armen Petrosyan.  ‘Bullet’ thus remains undefeated fifteen fights into his pro career but has no flagship victory just yet, one which proves his talent against a skillful veteran.  That is where MVP comes in. Not only does his style match up perfectly with Shara’s – they are both flashy, kick-heavy knockout artists with a penchant for the unusual – but he also has the distinction of having been one of rival promotion Bellator’s stars for a long time, going 17-2 in the promotion and only ever losing in title fights. Although Page's own resume is somewhat shallow, wins over Kevin Holland, Paul Daley, and Douglas Lima are far beyond any win of Magomedov’s. The collision of two lifelong martial artists and their unique styles of kicking – and spinning – in the octagon may create chaos. It may look awkward, even ugly, as can be the case when two unique specialists are both unsure how their style will work against someone as weird as themselves. It could also be an incredible fight., or at least a pretty fun one.  Whatever the case may be, it will certainly be a fight that plays out like no other. If Shara Bullet can take out MVP, however, it would be the biggest win of his career no matter how he gets it done.  Val was initiated into Steelers Nation from the moment he was born — his first memory is a game vs. New England from when ""Slash"" was QB — and doing sports writing has always been a dream career for him.

With the Jets at 3-7 overall and their playoff chances dwindling, the outlook is grim for Gang Green. Meanwhile, Rodgers ranks 26th out of 32 starting quarterbacks in yards per pass (6.4). ""I'm not playing as well as I would have liked to play for sure,"" said Rodgers. ""The frustrating part is that if you're a great competitor, you hold yourself to a standard and, and it's not unrealistic and I haven't reached that standard this year. RELATED: Traded veteran WR upgrades from Aaron Rodgers to Russell Wilson Despite the Achilles injury and a lack of wins, Rodgers claims to reside in a good mental state of late. ""It's been, actually, a really beautiful couple years for me in totality, but it's obviously been frustrating with the football part,"" said Rodgers. Rodgers is under contract through 2025, and he likely doesn't want to go out on a sour note. Unless team brass dumps him, which would result in a massive salary cap hit, it looks like the Jets will start a 41-year-old quarterback next season.           © Joe Camporeale     • Three serious candidates for Jets' head coaching job • Tyron Smith's neck injury could force Jets' rookie into starting role • Jets boot kicker after one game, sign former Packers' draft pick • Aaron Rodgers makes surprising suggestion for Mike Williams replacement • What New York Jets' plan should be in 2025 Ralph Ventre, a former college football conference administrator, brings 20 years of media experience to the New York Jets beat.

The Bills-Chiefs rivalry revolves around the fact Buffalo traded the No. 10 pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, which the Chiefs used to draft Patrick Mahomes. This has become the rivalry that defines the AFC ever since. Kansas City and Buffalo have the two best records in the NFL since 2017.  The Chiefs have won three Super Bowls, while the Bills are still trying to break through in the postseason. The teams have met seven times since 2020, including three AFC playoff matchups which have been swept by Kansas City. Buffalo holds a 3-1 advantage in regular-season matchups between Patrick Mahomes II and Josh Allen.  MORE: NFL playoff picture | NFL power rankings | Week NFL picks against the spread The stakes are about the same as usual heading into Sunday's matchup. The Chiefs (9-0) and Bills (8-2) have the two best records in the AFC. Buffalo has a chance to end Kansas City's perfect season, and there likely will be a rematch in the postseason. It also is the toughest pick in a week that also features the AFC North rivalry between the Steelers and Ravens and a Sunday Night Football matchup between the Bengals and Chargers.  Each week, we will pick NFL matchups straight up and against the spread. A look at our track record this season:  Here are our picks for Week 10:  NFL HQ:Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule Thursday, 8:15 p.m., Amazon Prime This is a fun NFC East matchup on the Thursday Night Football window between two elite NFC offenses. Jayden Daniels has been outstanding on the road this season, with a 76.9-percent completion percentage, seven TDs, and one interception. Can Washington generate enough of a running game against a defense that has allowed just 100 yards rushing one time through a five-game win streak? Jalen Hurts and Saquon Barkley keep the Eagles moving toward contention for the top seed in the NFC.  Pick: Eagles 28, Commanders 21  MORE: Johnny Newton in tears over late-game mistake vs. Steelers Sunday, 1 p.m., Fox  If the Bears want to change the tenor of their season around Caleb Williams, then a victory against Green Bay would be the tonic. Williams has taken 18 sacks in the past three games, but the Packers have had an inconsistent pass rush this season. Green Bay is coming off a bye week, and the Bears have struggled against the run. Expect Josh Jacobs to get a heavy workload, but Chicago hangs around in an all-in moment against their NFC North rivals.  Pick: Packers 27, Bears 22  MORE: Is Matt Eberflus on hot seat? Sunday, 1 p.m., CBS This is tied for the highest spread of the season and the fifth double-digit spread in the NFL this year. The favorite is 3-1 ATS in that situation so far, and Detroit has won its past two home games by an average of 20.5 points per game. Jacksonville has three one-score losses on the road, but they also lost 47-10 at Buffalo. This game could get in that neighborhood with Jared Goff looking to clean up the mistakes after a five-interception performance in Week 10.  Pick: Lions 37, Jaguars 17  MORE: Did Lions get away with key defensive pass interference vs. Texans? Sunday, 1 p.m., CBS The Vikings lead the NFL with 15 interceptions, and Sam Darnold has thrown five INTs in his past two games. The Titans are 31st in the NFL with a -11 turnover ratio. Which team can keep it clean? Justin Jefferson, who hasn't scored a TD in three games, breaks that streak, and the Vikings improve to 4-1 S/U on the road. Aaron Jones (ribs) should be good to go, too.  Pick: Vikings 24, Titans 14 MORE: Vikings taunt Jaguars' mascot after takeaways Sunday, 1 p.m., CBS  The Raiders had a bye week to attempt to reconstruct a brutal season, and the Dolphins are working on a short week after Monday Night Football against the Rams. Las Vegas is 3-0 ATS as an underdog of seven points or more, and Gardner Minshew did not throw an interception in his past two starts. Miami will take advantage of Las Vegas' inability to run the ball, but this still feels like a one-score game.  Pick: Miami 28, Raiders 22 WEEK 11 FANTASY FOOTBALL RANKINGSQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/ST | Kickers Sunday, 1 p.m., Fox  The Rams are 1-3 S/U on the road this season, but the protection for Matthew Stafford has been better in the past four games. He took just one sack in three games ahead of the Monday Night Football matchup against Miami, and the defense is creating more turnovers. Patriots rookie Drake Maye has a 66.7-percent completion percentage in his past two starts, but he will be forced to take more chances here if the Rams get ahead early.  Pick: Rams 22, Patriots 15 Sunday, 1 p.m., Fox  Jameis Winston spent three seasons in New Orleans from 2021-23, and now he'll get the chance to start against his former team coming out of the bye week. The Saints won their first game under interim coach Darren Rizzi, but they have struggled against the run. Nick Chubb could get on track here, and Myles Garrett could build off a three-sack performance in Week 9. Winston leads an emotional road win.  Pick: Browns 23, Saints 20 MORE: Interim coach Darren Rizzi explains why he expected 'crappy day' vs. Falcons Sunday, 1 p.m., CBS Which mess will be cleaned up first? The Colts are stuck in a three-game skid, one in which they have committed eight turnovers. Joe Flacco hasn't quite caught the magic he had in Cleveland last season. The Jets had 207 total yards in a Week 10 loss at Arizona. What is the difference? New York is 2-2 S/U at home with Aaron Rogers, and he has a 100.9 passer rating in those games.  Pick: Jets 24, Colts 17 MORE: Jeff Ulbrich takes blame for loss | Is Aaron Rodgers on hot seat? Sunday, 1 p.m., CBS The classic AFC North rivalry is renewed. The Steelers are winning with a formula Russell Wilson loves — a strong running game led by Najee Harris, a few deep shots to George Pickens, and a reliable defense. How will that stack up against Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry? Jackson is 1-3 against the Steelers as a starter, and he has taken an average of five sacks in those games. Pittsburgh won seven of the past eight in this series.  Pick: Ravens 21, Steelers 19 MORE STEELERS: Russell Wilson validates Mike Tomlin's QB decision with win over Commanders MORE RAVENS: Kyle Hamilton injury update | Derrick Henry wardrobe malfunction Sunday, 4:05 p.m., Fox  The Falcons are 3-3 S/U on the road, and the Broncos are 2-2 S/U at home. It's a toss-up game, and Cousins has been solid on the road with a 108.2 passer rating. Atlanta has to get Bijan Robinson going against a Broncos' defense that ranks seventh against the run. A victory would give Sean Payton a sweep against the NFC South, and we'll give it to him with a walk-off field goal.  Pick: Broncos 21, Falcons 17 Sunday, 4:05 p.m., Fox  The 49ers are getting healthy with the return of Christian McCaffrey, and Brock Purdy had his second-best passer rating of the season in a 23-20 win against Tampa Bay in Week 10. That's not a coincidence. San Francisco beat Seattle 36-24 in the first meeting. The Seahawks are 2-1 S/U on the road, but they are also 1-3 ATS as an underdog this season.  Pick: 49ers 29, Seahawks 20 MORE: CMC is back — and so is 49ers' Super Bowl offense | Deebo Samuel explains spat with teammates Sunday, 4:25 p.m., CBS  The Bills are on a five-game winning streak, and Allen has played well against the Chiefs throughout his career in the regular season with nine TDs and two interceptions. He averages 41.2 rushing yards in those games. The Chiefs have allowed 76.8 rushing yards per game in their past four games, but they also average 111.8 rushing yards in the same stretch. Mahomes is going to be asked to do more in this game. Mahomes has seven TDs and five INTs with an average of 31.5 rushing yards per game in those regular-season games with the Bills. Both quarterbacks will let it rip in the second half, and we expect the same-as-usual instant classic.  Pick: Chiefs 25, Bills 23 MORE: How Chiefs stayed perfect | Did Patrick Mahomes ask ref for help? | Taylor Swift meets with ref before Chiefs game Sunday, 8:20 p.m., NBC Peacock  The Chargers' turn-around with Jim Harbaugh continues, and it rests on high-percentage offense and a defense that has allowed 17 points or fewer in its six victories. Justin Herbert has a 67.5-percent completion percentage with five TDs and no interceptions through a three-game win streak. Joe Burrow is 65.9 percent with 10 TDs and two interceptions in his past three games, and the Bengals are 1-2. Cincinnati has to have it, and the Chargers have won the past two meetings.  Pick: Bengals 27, Chargers 26 MORE: Ja'Marr Chase's historic performance vs. Ravens | Playoff picture | Missed penalties on final play vs. Ravens  Monday, 8:15 p.m., ABC/ESPN The Cowboys are in a free-fall after managing just 146 total yards in Week 10 against Philadelphia. Will Trey Lance get the start against the Texans? Micah Parsons, who had two sacks in his return, will get a chance to get after podcast partner C.J. Stroud, who has struggled on the road all season with a 58.6-percent completion percentage, six TDs, and three interceptions. Houston is 2-3 S/U away from home. Is this the last stand for Mike McCarthy in prime time?  Pick: Texans 28, Cowboys 20 MORE: Jerry Jones says Mike McCarthy's job is safe — for now | Micah Parsons not concerned about McCarthy's job If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.
