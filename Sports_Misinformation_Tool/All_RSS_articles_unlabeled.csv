Purdy is dealing with a right shoulder injury and the 49ers are also potentially without left tackle Trent Williams and Nick Bosa due to injuries. Bosa was listed as out of Thursday's practice with an oblique injury. Williams also didn't suit up Thursday. He played through an ankle injury last week after being listed as questionable.  Purdy's typical Thursday post-practice media session was scrapped until Friday as the 49ers did not make any quarterback available. Kyle Allen would step in for Purdy as the starter if he can't play against the Packers.  Run game coordinator Chris Foerster said the 49ers aren't where they want to be at 5-5 because they haven't won close games, not because of injuries.  ""Seven games left is like an eternity,"" Foerster said. ""So much can happen. Do the math. What was our record last year? It was 12-5. I was on a 13-win team that was nowhere near as good as the team last year."" With or without Purdy, Foerster said the challenge for the 49ers is not to give up the ball to a defense that has 19 takeaways.  The 49ers have 13 giveaways this season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

A $4 million first prize is on the line at the LPGA's season finale at Tiburon Golf Club, where 60 players qualified based on the season-long Race to the CME Globe. An has never won on the LPGA Tour, but she finished 29th in the points race thanks to four top-10 finishes. Now she is in great position to land a massive victory. Angel Yin is alone in second, one stroke behind An, and Marina Alex and Allisen Corpuz are tied for third at 6 under. Lydia Ko of New Zealand is in striking distance of the lead after shooting a 5-under 67, part of a six-way tie for fifth. An, 28, hit all 14 fairways in regulation and needed just 23 putts to get around the course. She carded four birdies on each nine without a bogey. Though a $4 million paycheck is enticing, she said her attitude this week is that a tournament is a tournament. ""I think that mindset is good for make the focus during my play,"" An said. Yin, 26, was 2 over through four holes before turning things around. She got into red figures with three birdies before the end of the front nine, and she poured in four birdies between Nos. 10 and 14. Then, at the par-5 17th, she punctuated her day with an eagle 3. ""Started out a little bit rocky just because I was trying to adjust to the golf course,"" the Los Angeles native said. ""Golf course is playing quite difficult with the early winds this morning, which I really like and I enjoy, because it's our last tournament and it's a huge purse, bigger than a major. Doesn't have a title of a major, but I think it deserves every bit of difficulty it brings to closing the season out."" Alex, 34, also made a jump by eagling the 17th, but not the way she planned it. After a second shot she was unhappy with, she chipped in on her third. ""(On 17 she was) just like classically in the worst place I could have been, left and slightly long of that particular pin,"" the two-time winner from New Jersey said. ""... I thought I hit a nice chip. I was expecting it to be, I don't know, 10 to 15 feet, which was what I was going to be happy with trying to convert, and hit the pin and went in. ""Just you need some good breaks. Occasionally that kind of stuff happens."" Former U.S. Women's Open champ Corpuz had a bogey-free day, while Ko carded six birdies and one bogey. Ko is trying to polish off perhaps the best year of her career after she already collected an Olympic gold medal and the Women's Open title. She also qualified for the LPGA Hall of Fame and was inducted last month. ""I think this is the type of golf course where it's not like one fights into this type of golf course,"" Ko said. ""We've seen various of winners here, from longer hitters to people that hit it really straight and et cetera. ""... I think it's going to be exciting. It's always an exciting finish here. Hopefully, I'll be able to hit and play my fair share of good shots and be in contention and finish the season officially on a high."" World No. 1 Nelly Korda, who finished No. 1 in the points race, shot a pedestrian even-par 72 and is tied for 44th.

Winnipeg's second and third defeats of the season came in a 4-1 loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning on Nov. 14 and a 5-0 shutout to the Florida Panthers on Nov. 16. The Jets got a chance at immediate revenge against the Panthers on Tuesday, and capitalized with a 6-3 victory on home ice. ""We didn't like the way we played in Florida. So it's just a sign of a lot of good character in this room that we wanted to bounce back,"" said Mark Scheifele, who had a hat trick on Tuesday. ""We wanted to have a good game in front of our home crowd before we go on the road for what feels like forever."" Friday marks the start of a six-game road trip for the Jets, who are 7-2-0 in away games this season. The Penguins are 1-2-2 in their last five games, and have been struggling to either gain or hold leads. In the first two games of their five-game homestand, the Penguins almost blew a three-goal lead in Saturday's 4-3 shootout win over the San Jose Sharks, and then lost a two-goal lead in Tuesday's 3-2 overtime loss to the Lightning. Pittsburgh is 4-5-2 when scoring first in games, the lowest winning percentage (.364) of any team in the NHL when taking the early lead. ""We like parts of our game but I think we've just got to get more comfortable and just got to put 60 minutes together ... We have the leads in the game, we're right where we want to be and we let it slip,"" Penguins forward Rickard Rakell said. Keeping leads is always difficult with a leaky defense, and the Penguins have allowed the most goals (81) in the NHL. Pittsburgh's skaters have a combined -127 plus-minus rating, and goaltenders Alex Nedeljkovic, Tristan Jarry and Joel Blomqvist have a cumulative 3.62 goals-against average. Defenseman Kris Letang is questionable for Friday's lineup after missing Pittsburgh's last three games due to illness. It adds up for a great opportunity for the scorching Jets offense to keep lighting the lamp. Winnipeg is among the league leaders with an average of 4.21 goals per game. Since the Penguins host the Utah Hockey Club on Saturday, Nedeljkovic and Jarry figure to split the back-to-back starts in some order. The Jets are also playing consecutive games, as the team faces the Predators in Nashville on Saturday. Backup goalie Eric Comrie might be likelier to face Pittsburgh, as starter Connor Hellebuyck may be saved to face Winnipeg's Central Division rivals. Sidney Crosby could achieve another milestone Friday, as the Penguins star is sitting on 599 career NHL goals. Still a potent force in his 20th NHL season, Crosby leads Pittsburgh with 20 points (seven goals, 13 assists). Scheifele and Kyle Connor share the Jets' team scoring lead with 24 points apiece. Both players have an even 12 goals and 12 assists. In the first meeting between the two teams this season, the Jets collected a 6-3 win over the Penguins in Winnipeg on Oct. 20. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

""I got a little blood on my elbow, a little blood on my nose. My ankle,"" Craig said. ""I like games like that."" With injuries opening a spot for Craig in the starting lineup, the bump-and-shove looks to continue for the Bulls, who hope the frontcourt veteran's energetic influence rubs off. Chicago has lost eight of 11 entering Friday's visit from the Atlanta Hawks. Starting in place of Patrick Williams, who's expected to miss at least a week with left foot inflammation, Craig scored 15 points while snagging six rebounds in a 122-106 loss to the Bucks, matching Nikola Vucevic for the team high on the glass. ""It's no secret; you've just got to want the ball,"" Craig said. ""I'm a competitor. The ball's up, I try to compete for it."" Craig missed Chicago's Nov. 9 game at Atlanta due to illness. The Bulls won 125-113 behind 19 points from Ayo Dosunmu and Vucevic's 18-point, 12-rebound double-double. Coby White and Zach LaVine also scored 18 points. Bulls coach Billy Donovan said LaVine ""carried us"" against the Bucks, who closed the game on an 18-4 run. LaVine scored 20 of his 27 points before halftime and shot 9 of 15 for the game, including 4 of 7 from 3-point range. ""I've seen his shot-making; it's been incredible,"" Donovan said. ""He has the ability to get on a roll."" Atlanta is eyeing a split of a four-game road trip that has sandwiched losses at Portland and Golden State around a one-point victory in Sacramento. The Hawks lost 120-97 at Golden State on Wednesday, scoring just four points more than their season low. ""I didn't think that we talked enough tonight,"" said Atlanta coach Quin Snyder, whose team shot 33.3 percent, including just 26.7 percent (12 of 45) from deep. ""And sometimes that happens when you're not making shots and it's actually when you need each other, and even more. ""Regardless of who's in the game, how long they play, we can run. You can run. You can see that there's a corner and it's empty and you can fill it, and you can see where the ball is and you can space, and doing that gives us a chance to get connected."" Atlanta played with its full rotation against the Warriors. After missing the Sacramento game with left leg inflammation, Jalen Johnson posted a double-double of 15 points and 14 rebounds to lead six Hawks in double-figure scoring. Trae Young (12 points, 11 assists) and Clint Capela (11 points, 10 rebounds) also contributed double-doubles. Friday marks the resumption of NBA Cup play. Atlanta is seeking a 3-0 start in East Group C after previous victories at Boston and against Washington. The Bulls lost their lone group play contest to date, at Cleveland. Group play will continue on Tuesdays and Fridays through Dec. 3 to determine an elimination bracket later in the month. The winner of each group plus one wild card from each conference will advance to the knockout rounds. Chicago has won six of 10 against Atlanta. LaVine has shot 53.6 percent while averaging 25.4 points in his past 10 games against the Hawks. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Ovechkin, 39, exited Monday's 6-2 win over the Utah Hockey Club with 14:30 remaining following a collision with Utah forward Jack McBain. A teammate had to help him off the ice. The Capitals announced Tuesday that Ovechkin was considered week-to-week as he underwent further evaluation on his leg. On Wednesday, the team placed him on injured reserve and recalled forward prospect Ivan Miroshnichenko from AHL affiliate Hershey. The injury interrupted Ovechkin while he was on a hot streak. He scored two goals in the Utah game before going down and has 13 goals in his past 11. Before Thursday's games, he owned the NHL lead with 15 goals on the season. Ovechkin's pursuit of history will now be postponed as well.

While Kentucky claims eight NCAA Tournament crowns and the most wins in college basketball history, Jackson State has never won an NCAA Tournament game and enters the matchup looking for its first win of the season. Impressive tradition and current record aside, Kentucky (4-0) returned no scholarship players from last season's team that was knocked off by Oakland in the NCAA Tournament. New coach Mark Pope and his essentially all-new Wildcats are off to a promising start. Through four games, Kentucky is averaging 94.3 points per game, and with 11.5 3-pointers made per game, the team is on pace to set a school record from long distance. The Wildcats boast six double-figure scorers with transfer guards Otega Oweh (from Oklahoma, 15.0 ppg) and Koby Brea (from Dayton, 14.5 ppg) leading the team. The Wildcats defeated Duke 77-72 on Nov. 12 but showed few signs of an emotional letdown in Tuesday's 97-68 win over a Lipscomb team picked to win the Atlantic Sun Conference in the preseason. Kentucky drained a dozen 3-pointers while outrebounding their visitors 43-28. Guard Jaxson Robinson, held to a single point by Duke, dropped 20 points to lead the Kentucky attack. Afterward, Pope praised his team's focus, saying, ""The last game was over and it was kind of on to, ‘How do we get better?' That's the only thing we talk about."" Lipscomb coach Lennie Acuff also delivered a ringing endorsement, calling Kentucky ""the best offensive Power Four team we've played in my six years at Lipscomb."" Jackson State (0-5) and third-year coach Mo Williams are looking for something positive to build upon. Not only are the Tigers winless, but they have lost each game by nine or more points. Sophomore guard Jayme Mitchell Jr. (13.8 ppg) is the leading scorer, but the team shoots just 35.8 percent while allowing opponents to shoot 52.3 percent. The Tigers played on Wednesday at Western Kentucky, where they lost 79-62. Reserve Tamarion Hoover had a breakout game with 18 points to lead Jackson State, but the host Hilltoppers canned 14 3-point shots and outrebounded the Tigers 42-35 to grab the win. Earlier, Williams, who played against Kentucky while a student at Alabama, admitted the difficulties of a challenging nonconference schedule for his team. ""Our goal is not to win 13 nonconference games,"" Williams said. ""We're already at a disadvantage in that regard. We use these games to get us ready for conference play and for March Madness."" Jackson State has not made the NCAA Tournament since 2007. The Tigers had a perfect regular-season record (11-0) in the Southwestern Athletic Conference in 2020-21 but lost in the league tournament. Kentucky has never played Jackson State before, but the game is being billed as part of a Unity Series of matchups in which Kentucky hosts members of the SWAC to raise awareness of Historical Black Colleges and Universities and provide funds for those schools. Past Unity Series opponents have been Southern in December 2021 and Florida A&M in December 2022. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Sure enough, the Bucks have won four of their last five games heading into an NBA Cup matchup against the visiting Indiana Pacers on Friday. While Milwaukee is trending upward, Indiana has dropped four of its last five games. The Pacers shot 5 of 22 (22.7 percent) from 3-point range in a 130-113 loss to the Houston Rockets on Wednesday. Indiana will look to bounce back against the Bucks and star Giannis Antetokounmpo, who had 41 points, nine rebounds and eight assists in a 122-106 home win over the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday. Brook Lopez was among several players who struggled during the team's dismal start, but the 7-foot-1 center is averaging 19 points on 55.4 percent shooting over his last five games. ""We know the team that we are,"" Lopez said. ""We've known the team that we are all season long, we just had to prove it by winning games. It's gotten better and better. Obviously, the last few, we're happy with winning, they were close ones but we put in a lot of work, we're doing great."" The Bucks looked like a championship contender late in Wednesday's contest, when they closed the game on an 18-4 run. After the victory, Rivers reflected on his team's rough start to the season. ""I felt good about the team, I just didn't feel good about our record, to be honest,"" Rivers said. ""I still feel that way -- I don't feel good about our record yet -- but I do feel good about this team. I feel really good about this team."" Indiana coach Rick Carlisle isn't quite as pleased with his team, and he suggested changes could be coming following another disappointing loss on Wednesday. ""We're not playing well. That's obvious,"" Carlisle said. ""Our connectedness is not where it needs to be. Our collective spirit is not where it needs to be. I'm going to look very closely at the film tonight. The coaching staff is. We have to come up with answers."" The Pacers desperately need more production from All-Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton, who was held to four points on 1-of-7 shooting against Houston, including 1 of 5 from 3-point range. Haliburton is averaging 12.6 points while shooting 30.3 percent from the field and 30.8 percent (12 of 39) from 3-point range over his last five games. One bright spot in Wednesday's loss was the play of guard Quenton Jackson, who scored a career-high 24 points on 10-of-12 shooting in his first career start. Jackson also had three assists, two rebounds, two steals and a block in 27 minutes. ""Quenton Jackson is an example of where we need everybody's spirit to be,"" Carlisle said. ""The guy is flying all over the place, playing at a ridiculously high level of intensity and unselfishness and totally surrendering to the team, you know? For us, we just have to work at adopting that on a full-time basis and really being there for each other."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

With NBA Cup home wins over the Dallas Mavericks and Memphis Grizzlies under their belt, the Warriors will be looking not only to remain as the only unbeaten team in West Group C but also improve their point differential should it become needed. The Pelicans beat the Denver Nuggets in their only previous home game in the in-season tournament. At 1-1, they are tied with the Nuggets and Mavericks for second place in the group, but could drop the Warriors back to the pack with a win Friday. New Orleans has struggled big-time since its 101-94 victory over the Nuggets last Friday, falling to the Los Angeles Lakers, Mavericks and Cleveland Cavaliers by a total of 74 points. They are coming off a 128-100 shellacking at Cleveland on Wednesday. One positive from Wednesday's game was the play of rookie guard Antonio Reeves, who exploded for 34 points in a season-high 40 minutes. The Kentucky product had totaled just 23 points in his first eight games, and wasn't even on the active roster when the Pelicans were swept in a pair of October games at Golden State. But with Zion Williamson, Trey Murphy III, Brandon Ingram, CJ McCollum, Dejounte Murray, Herbert Jones, Jordan Hawkins and Jose Alvarado all out of the lineup, Reeves took advantage of an opportunity coach Willie Green said he worked hard to get. ""It's a credit to (coach) Jodie Meeks and our Birmingham Squadron (G League) team,"" Green insisted. ""(Reeves) coming into the gym every day, getting his shots up, paying attention, and gameplan discipline. It all pays off when you get on the floor."" Already winners of six road games this season, the Warriors have no such health issues. They are missing only De'Anthony Melton, ruled out of the season this week with a partially torn left ACL. Lindy Waters III has stepped into Melton's starting spot and contributed at least two 3-pointers to each of Golden State's last three games. He had 10 points in Wednesday's 120-97 home win over the Atlanta Hawks. Buddy Hield (11 points) and Jonathan Kuminga (10) were among five others who also scored in double figures for the Warriors. They did so off the bench. Keeping them together was a big part in the decision to promote Waters, Warriors coach Steve Kerr noted after Wednesday's win. ""He's a good fit next to that group,"" Kerr said of a starting lineup that includes Stephen Curry, Andrew Wiggins, Draymond Green and Trayce Jackson-Davis. ""I like bringing Buddy off the bench. The bench group has been really good this year. Starting with Lindy allows us to keep the bench intact and gives us another shooter and defender in the starting lineup."" Waters had 21 points as a reserve and Hield 28 as a starter when their roles were reversed in a 124-106 home win over the Pelicans last month that tipped off a two-game, same-site series. Hield (21 points) returned to the bench for the rematch, a 104-89 Golden State triumph that allowed them to complete a sweep without Curry, who was nursing a strained left ankle. -Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

McNealy began the week at the par-70 Seaside Course and fired an 8-under-par 62, with one eagle, six birdies and no bogeys on his card. Thorbjornsen, meanwhile, shot a bogey-free, 8-under 64 at the par-72 Plantation Course. They will switch courses on Friday before everyone who makes the cut plays the Seaside Course on Saturday and Sunday. McNealy and Thorbjornsen are one shot ahead of Andrew Novak, who posted a 7-under 65 at the Plantation Course. PGA Tour rookie Adrien Dumont de Chassart of Belgium recorded a career-low 64 at the Seaside Course to get his week going, and he's in a tie for fourth at 6 under with Chandler Phillips (66, Plantation).

Florida Atlantic (4-2) advances to play Drake in the semifinal round on Friday while the Cowboys square off against Miami in the consolation semifinal contest, also Friday. Oklahoma State led by as many as 10 points in the first half before securing a five-point advantage at halftime. The Owls surged back and moved in front with four and a half minutes to play. It was part of an 11-1 run, capped by a 3-pointer from Tandy that made it 75-68 with 2:41 remaining. Ken Evans added 14 points for Florida Atlantic, with Leland Walker hitting for 13 and Tre Carroll scoring 11.

From there, the Cowboys stoked their advantage to double digits when Jamyron Keller canned a shot from beyond the arc with five minutes to play in the half.

However, a few things are playing in Pittsburgh's favor as Week 12 of the NFL regular season kicks off. Namely, the ""trip"" to Cleveland is a little more than two hours by road and when the Steelers arrive there, they'll be facing a backup quarterback at the helm of a massively underwhelming 2-8 Browns team. The Steelers (8-2) are coming off a huge win over Baltimore to stay atop the AFC North. And Pittsburgh is beginning to set its sights on potential home-field advantage come playoff time.  ODDS AND TRENDS The Steelers are a consensus 3.5-point favorite. That includes at BetRivers, where they have been backed by 80 percent of the spread-line money. Pittsburgh's -195 moneyline to simply win the game has been even more popular, drawing 95 percent of all money wagered. The Browns enter Thursday night having failed to cover the spread in nine of their past 12 games. Meanwhile, the Steelers have covered the spread in every game during their five-game win streak. The 37.0 total points line has seen the Over backed by 65 percent of the money and 70 percent of the total bets. Each of Cleveland's past eight November home games has gone under the total points line. PROP PICKS --Steelers WR George Pickens Over 50 Receiving Yards (-195 at DraftKings): Russell Wilson has thrown six touchdowns in the four games since he took over as the starting quarterback. Two of those have gone to Pickens, who has at least 74 receiving yards in each of those games. There is some concern that Pittsburgh gains a big early lead and turns to a run-heavy attack, but Wilson throws an excellent deep ball and that plays into Pickens' strength. This is the most popular player prop at the book. --Steelers RB Najee Harris Anytime TD (+100 at BetRivers): That potential for a run-heavy approach should benefit Harris, who found the sledding tough against Baltimore with 63 yards on the ground. He was also held out of the end zone for the second time in three games. Keep in mind that Cleveland has allowed only three touchdowns on the ground all season, but the Browns have allowed 12 through the air. Harris has a trio of scores on the ground and receiving through 10 games. KEY STAT The Browns have won the first quarter in five consecutive home games against the Steelers. THE NEWS The Steelers have certainly been locked in. They are currently riding a five-game winning streak, most recently edging the Baltimore Ravens 18-16 on Sunday.   Chris Boswell booted six field goals against Baltimore, while Wilson completed 23 of 36 passes for 205 yards and an interception.   Meanwhile, Cleveland continues to go through the wringer. The Browns ended up on the wrong end of a 35-14 blowout while facing the host New Orleans Saints on Sunday, marking their seventh loss in the past eight games.   Cleveland now has to go up against one of the most unforgiving defenses in the league. Browns quarterback Jameis Winston is determined to direct a fundamentally sound performance against Pittsburgh, which allows the second-fewest points per game in the NFL (16.2).   ""It's precision passing. Getting the ball out on time. Elite operation and just doing our job. It's the simple things,"" Winston said. ""This team (the Steelers) is not going to try and fool you. They're going to line up and say, 'Give us your best, we're going to give you our best.'""   Winston threw for 395 yards and two touchdowns on 30-for-46 passing in the setback against New Orleans, with Jerry Jeudy hauling in six catches for 142 yards and a score. Star running back Nick Chubb continued to struggle since his return from a knee injury that cut his 2023 season short, finishing with 50 yards on 11 carries.   INJURY REPORT The Browns could be without standout defensive end Myles Garrett, who missed practice on Tuesday because of a hip injury. Wide receiver Elijah Moore (shoulder), guard Joel Bitonio (pectoral) and cornerbacks Denzel Ward (ribs/ankle) and Greg Newsome II (shoulder) were among those limited during the session.   Linebacker Alex Highsmith is dealing with an ankle issue and was ruled out by the Steelers along with cornerback Cory Trice Jr. (hamstring). THEY SAID IT Wilson is starting to feel like he might be part of something special, but he also doesn't want Pittsburgh to get ahead of itself.   ""I definitely think that we have a chance (to make a deep playoff run),"" said Wilson, who has played in two Super Bowls. ""I think the biggest thing for us is continuing to just take each week as the most important week of it all.   ""I think that it's not really even just the week, it's just the day, it's just the moments in between. I think the greatest teams, the greatest players, in any sport, especially the teams I've been on, is the moment -- it's never too far away. It's right here, right now. And you're just locked into that."" PREDICTION Divisional road games on short weeks typically shape up as a daunting task. That's not the case for the Steelers, who will be hyper-focused to put this one out of reach early before enjoying 10 days ahead of a trip to Cleveland. With a second game against the Browns before a huge game at Philadelphia, this is not an under-manned opponent Pittsburgh will look past. --Steelers 27, Browns 19   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

The journey ended on Wednesday in a 117-111 loss at Memphis, despite 2023 MVP Joel Embiid playing his best game of the season.  Embiid finished with game highs of 35 points and 11 rebounds in his fourth contest since rejoining the Sixers lineup, after missing the first nine games with a lingering knee injury.  Philadelphia is winless in Embiid's four appearances, have only two wins this season and none in NBA Cup action. The Sixers opened group play with a 111-99 loss to the New York Knicks on Nov. 12, followed by a 98-86 road loss to the Orlando Magic on Nov. 15.  Philadelphia is now also dealing with another knee injury to a key player, as Paul George left Wednesday's game with a hyperextension. ""Similar to the preseason,"" Sixers coach Nick Nurse said, referring to an injury George sustained in October. ""We're going to find out more (Thursday) when (the medical staff) checks it out to see what the extent of it is."" Nurse said George's injury may be akin to a bone bruise, which would not require a lengthy absence. Still, the team is awaiting more details ahead of Friday's return home. ""You never know what happens,"" Nurse said. ""He was actually fairly close to coming back in the game but then it stiffened up as he got out a little bit more, so we decided not to."" Amid the rash of injuries and roster tumult, rookie Jared McCain is emerging as a bright spot in the Sixers' dismal start. Wednesday's 20-point performance marked the guard's sixth consecutive game scoring 20-plus points. McCain has made at least three 3-pointers in all six of those contests, while he averaged 25.5 points. The Nets ended a three-game losing streak Tuesday and improved to 1-1 in the NBA Cup, with a 116-115 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. Cam Johnson scored 34 points, while Trendon Watford hit a jumper with 38 seconds remaining that gave the Nets necessary breathing room down the stretch.  Watford finished with 10 points over 19 minutes in just his second game back from a hamstring injury sustained in training camp. ""Very happy that he had the game that he had, but that to me is the definition of a team,"" Nets coach Jordi Fernandez said. ""Our medical staff worked hard to get him back healthy. We've got to trust the group, because they do a great job, and this is the result. It's a win for everybody."" Nets point guard Dennis Schroder continued his run of solid two-way play at point guard in Tuesday's win. With his 14 points and 12 assists against Charlotte, Schroder is averaging 17.8 points and 6.5 assists in 15 games (all starts). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

""What we're trying to get from Sam is play the best football of his career,"" O'Connell said.  Darnold is delivering and the Vikings have a three-game winning streak in tow when they arrive at Soldier Field on Sunday. He has posted a 100.0 passer rating in 10 starts.

""As far as the ability to execute the plan, the ability to bring the defensive fervor and intensity to the situation and establishing our identity defensively, it's a plus."" Campbell will meet three power-conference teams in a season for the first time since 2011-12. The Fighting Camels lost 65-56 at Virginia on Nov. 6 and play at North Carolina on Dec. 29. McGeehan likes the challenges in facing these programs. ""These teams are all physical and tough, and we want to sharpen ourselves and test ourselves again and again and again so we're the team that is imposing that on someone else when we need it the most,"" he said. Jasin Sinani is the only Campell player averaging double figures with 11.6 points per game. He also leads the team with 5.2 rebounds and 28.8 minutes per game. The Buckeyes have three players averaging double figures: Bruce Thornton (13.8), John Mobley Jr. (13.5) and Devin Royal (10.5). Royal also is pulling down a team-best 7.5 rebounds per game, while Thornton is dishing five assists per contest. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Washington's losing streak began after the Wizards won two in a row to even their record at 2-2. Eight of the nine losses have come by double digits. Washington dropped a 124-104 home decision to Detroit on Sunday, and then had its losing streak reach nine games with Monday's 134-106 setback at New York. The Wizards have allowed at least 120 points in each of their last four games. Following Monday's loss, Washington coach Brian Keefe made it clear he was frustrated with the team's effort in the last two games. ""I'm the leader of this team,"" Keefe said. ""I'm the head coach of this team, so I'll take the responsibility for the last two nights not playing up to the competitive disposition that we should be playing with, especially defensively. That will be addressed as a group and we will get better. But that wasn't what we need to be, what our standards were. And we have to own that. And we have to look at ourselves and we have to get better."" Washington forward Corey Kispert said the Wizards' compete-level has not been where it needs to be. ""It's been a bad few showings for us, and we can deal with losing if we're competitive, (if) we come ready to play,"" Kispert said. ""But (to not) be ready to play at all and (to not) compete, that's absolutely unacceptable."" Washington is 0-1 in NBA Cup play this season. Boston improved its NBA Cup record to 1-1 by beating Cleveland 120-117 on Tuesday. It was Cleveland's first loss after a 15-0 start this season. Boston received a strong performance from 38-year-old center Al Horford on Tuesday. Horford had a season-high 20 points to go with seven rebounds and three blocked shots. He made four 3-pointers and had two blocks late when the Cavaliers were trying to complete a comeback after trailing by 21 points. ""It was just about finishing the job,"" Horford said. ""I felt like we played really well in the first half. In the third, they cut into the lead, and in the fourth they got in there and it was a back-and-forth. It was like, man, we put ourselves in a position, we gotta finish this and see it through."" Boston's Jayson Tatum had 33 points, 12 rebounds, seven assists and two steals during the victory. ""Al is just a calming presence out there,"" Tatum said. ""He just does so many different things for us. Sometimes they show up in the stat sheet and sometimes they don't, but just him being on the court with us helps our spacing, helps our defense. He's such a good passer, willing passer. So we're just a much better team when Al is out there and being aggressive."" The Celtics enter Friday's game on a three-game winning streak and have won five of their last six. Boston is 7-1 in road games this season. Washington is 1-5 at home. Friday's game will be the second meeting between the teams this season. Boston earned a 122-102 road victory on Oct. 24. Boston's Jaylen Brown scored a game-high 27 points in that matchup, which extended Boston's winning streak against Washington to five games. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

The Utes (3-1) are coming off a disappointing 78-73 road loss against Mississippi State on Sunday after leading by double digits at halftime. The Trailblazers (1-3) fell 86-69 at Wyoming last Saturday. ""You know, a couple plays here or there and the score flips, and we're super happy,"" Utah coach Craig Smith told ESPN 700 in Salt Lake City. ""This is a good team we just played (Sunday), and it's that type of team we're going to see in the Big 12."" Miro Little gave Utah a 39-28 lead at the break after hitting back-to-back 3-pointers, but Mississippi State began the second half with a 22-5 surge and punished the Utes in the final minutes from the free-throw line, draining 7 of 8 attempts in the final 73 seconds. Utah's leading scorer, Gabe Madsen, was limited to nine points while going 1-for-10 from 3-point territory. Ezra Ausar topped Utah with 15 points, Mason Madsen scored 14 and Keanu Dawes chipped in with his first career double-double of 13 points and 12 rebounds. The Friday game kicks off a six-game homestand for Utah, which won the first three games of the season by at least 31 points. Utah Tech will take on Utah for just the third time in history. The first game was a 41-26 Utah win in 1928. Much more recently, the Utes won 83-64 on Jan. 9, 2008. The Trailblazers are in the early stages of an eight-game road trip. It began in Wyoming and will include a three-game stop at the Stew Morrill Classic in Missoula, Mont., before continuing on at Portland State, Boise State and Utah State. Tennessee Rainwater led Utah Tech against Wyoming with a career-best 16 points, while Beon Riley (14), Noa Gonsalves (13) and Britton Berrett (12) also had double-digit scoring outings. Utah Tech's only win this season was a 90-59 home victory over Bethesda of the National Christian College Athletic Association. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Jones read a prepared statement, saying he wanted to make sure he clearly shared the words and sentiment he felt needed to be aired after losing the starting job to former undrafted free agent Tommy DeVito. In his first public comments on the decision made by head coach Brian Daboll after a team meeting on Monday, Jones spoke in the past tense about his time with the Giants (2-8), a strong signal that a professional divorce is imminent. ""The opportunity to play for the New York Giants was truly a dream come true and I am extremely grateful ... for the chance to play here,"" Jones said Thursday. ""The Giants are truly a first-class organization and I have nothing but genuine respect and appreciation for the people who built it and who help carry on the tradition. I've met so many special people and created relationships that will truly last a lifetime. Thank you to all my teammates, coaches and staff that have done so much for me these past six years. There have been some great times, but of course we all wish there had been more of those."" Ranked 32nd among all qualified quarterbacks in passer rating this season, Jones has eight touchdowns and seven interceptions in 2024. He also carries an injury guarantee worth $23 million for this season that the Giants likely don't want to risk paying only to cut ties with him in the offseason. Jones, 27, was a first-round pick in 2019 and signed a four-year, $160 million contract in 2023. He suffered a season-ending ACL tear last season but returned in time to start the season as the No. 1 quarterback. He was benched with a record of 3-13 over his past 16 starts. The remainder of Jones' contract can be partially wiped off the books if he's released before March 2025. ""I take full responsibility for my part in not bringing more wins. No one wanted to win more games worse than me and I gave everything I had on the field and in my preparation,"" Jones continued. ""Of course, this season has been disappointing for all, and of course I wish I could've done more. I'm 100 percent accountable for my part. I did not play well enough, consistently enough help the team get the results. The reality of the NFL is it's hard to win games and requires consistent performance from everyone involved. We didn't do that well enough so the idea to change something happens, and I understand. ""I love the game, I love being part of a team and I'm excited for the next opportunity. I know that there's a lot of good football in front of me and I'm excited about that,"" Jones said. ""To all fans, I have deep respect and appreciation for your passion and love for the Giants. The fans are huge part of what makes playing for the Giants so special."" Asked about his statement being written past-tense, Jones said he's still processing the bigger picture. ""I think I'm still processing and, for now, I'm doing the best I can to help (quarterback) Tommy (DeVito) prepare, help the team prepare. That's what I'm going to do right now. So, processing that,"" Jones said.  ""Obviously, a decision was made and I'm not playing. That's what that was framed as."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Both USC (5-5, 3-5 Big Ten) and UCLA (4-6, 3-5) are playing for their bowl-game lives. A loss eliminates the Bruins from bowl participation in their first year of Big Ten membership, while falling at UCLA would send the Trojans into their regular-season finale against top 10-ranked Notre Dame needing a victory to land a bowl bid. The winner of the Victory Bowl this year also takes the lead in what has been one of the most competitive stretches in the rivalry's history. The teams are 6-6 over the last 12 meetings dating back to 2012 and have exchanged wins in the last four encounters. The home team has not won since a 52-35 decision for USC in 2019. UCLA continued the run of road wins last season with a 38-20 victory at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, sparked by quarterback Ethan Garbers' three passing touchdowns and a 142-yard rushing effort from running back T.J. Harden. Garbers heads into Saturday's matchup on a run of four consecutive games passing for multiple touchdowns, but his two last week came in UCLA's first loss of that stretch in a 31-19 setback vs. Washington. The Bruins' rushing offense is among the nation's least productive at 85.4 yards per game and regressed to 52 yards last week after posting season-highs of 139 and 211 at Nebraska and vs. Iowa, respectively. ""I would like to see us deal with adverse situations better,"" said Bruins coach DeShaun Foster on Tuesday when asked about injuries on the offensive line. ""We're not going to make excuses. Foster was a UCLA running back from 1998-2001, after he was recruited as a defensive back by USC, and knows all about the cross-town rivalry. ""I'm just glad we have another opportunity to play,"" Foster added. ""This type of game is one that can get us back on track."" A prominent figure on Saturday, who switched sidelines from a season ago, is USC defensive coordinator D'Anton Lynn, who held the same post at UCLA in 2023.  ""The culture defensively within our program has shifted in a lot of ways,"" said Trojans head coach Lincoln Riley, who is 1-1 against the Bruins. ""I'm really proud of how we've progressed schematically. I'm really proud of how we've progressed fundamentally.""  The Trojans' defense is allowing 22 points per game this season under Lynn after surrendering 34.4 per game in 2023.  USC is looking for back-to-back wins for the first time since Weeks 1 and 2 against LSU and Utah State. The Trojans ended their streak of one-possession losses in conference play, having dropped each of the previous five games decided by one score before last week's 28-20 victory over Nebraska. Quarterback Jayden Maiava recovered from an early pick-six in his first career start to go 25-of-35 passing for 259 yards and three touchdowns. He spread the ball to six pass-catchers who had at least receptions, while Woody Marks rushed for 146 yards on 19 carries. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

McLaren driver Oscar Piastri said he does not have to operate in a support role for teammate Lando Norris, now that Norris' hopes of a driver's championship are in long-shot mode. ""Pretty much, yes,"" Piastro said this week when asked if team strategy has changed. Red Bull Racing's Max Verstappen leads the drivers' standings with 393 points, while Norris is second with 331, followed by Ferrari's Charles Leclerc (307) and Piastri (262). Dubbed the ""papaya rules,"" Piastri was required to make sure Norris could secure as many points as possible to keep the pressure on Verstappen. That meant Piastri was forced to back off a sprint race at Brazil on Nov. 3, to let Norris pass for overall points considerations. Norris ended up finishing in sixth place to earn eight points, while Verstappen went on to win and earn 26 points. Piastri finished eighth and earned four points. Piastri's ""pretty much,"" comment suggests that he is not quite free to operate as he pleases in all circumstances. ""There's still some, let's say, very specific scenarios where I might be needed to help out,"" Piastri said. ""But for the very large majority of situations, it's back to how it was."" While Verstappen has a solid grip on the drivers' championship, McLaren still has its sights on the constructors' championship. McLaren Mercedes heads to Las Vegas in the lead of the constructors' standings with 593 points, ahead of Ferrari (557) and Red Bull (544). To his credit, Piastri has not objected to operating in a support role for his teammate. His goal is to be the one who is getting all the help in 2025. ""Obviously next year, I want to make sure that I'm not in a position, championship-wise, to be subject to that,"" he said.

""Law enforcement officials have noted these groups appear to exploit team schedules to target athletes' homes on game days."" NBC News reported Wednesday that law enforcement is working to figure out whether an international crime syndicate is involved. The Athletic reported that the memo includes tips for home security and also gives recommendations about the use of social media, such as not posting photos of items that would attract thieves.

Steve Settle III, who is second with a 13.3 scoring average, tallied 10 of his 15 points in the first half. Mashburn, a fifth-year guard who transferred from New Mexico, has scored 20 or more points in each of the four games to open the season, which is the second time he has accomplished that feat in his career.

Hunter could be the No. 1 pick in the 2025 NFL Draft and is the favorite for the Heisman Trophy.  Speculation about his future quieted as he gained notoriety by the week this season. Field Level Media projects Hunter as a top-three pick in the draft, and he confirmed Thursday this will be his last season at the college level.  ""That's definitely for sure,"" Hunter said on a conference call with reporters.  Hunter is consistently playing between 100 and 125 snaps per game for Colorado. He has three interceptions on defense with 74 receptions, 911 yards and nine touchdowns playing wideout for quarterback Shedeur Sanders. Also a projected early first-round pick, Sanders committed to play in the East-West Shrine Game in Dallas. The son of Colorado head coach and Hall of Fame cornerback Deion Sanders, Shedeur Sanders said Thursday he would cast a Heisman vote for Hunter.  ""If it's between me and him, I would want him to get it,"" Sanders said. ""He does a lot of amazing things and things that haven't been done before. I'm not a selfish guy. I know what he's capable of, so I would rather him win.""  Hunter said he would invite his QB to New York if he's not named a Heisman finalist before they go about the business of finishing the season, possibly in the 12-team College Football Playoff. Shedeur Sanders said he's the best quarterback in the draft, and doesn't believe that's anything new.  ""I feel like I was the best quarterback in the last draft, too,"" said Shedeur Sanders. ""Ever since I was draft eligible, I knew I'm the best quarterback. It's not up for me to prove myself to talking about why."" Former teammates at Jackson State where Deion Sanders also coached, Hunter said he felt his draft stock began to rise only after critics moved past ""the hate"" for his coach. A flashy, charismatic cornerback in the NFL after starring at Florida State, Deion Sanders was the fifth overall pick in the 1989 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons. Hall of Famers Troy Aikman (first, Cowboys), Barry Sanders (third, Lions) and Derrick Thomas (fourth, Chiefs) were chosen ahead of ""Prime Time"" along with offensive tackle Tony Mandarich (second, Packers).  Hunter has picked the brain of Deion Sanders about a dual role in pro sports. Sanders was used selectively as a wide receiver and returned punts but was primarily a cornerback in addition to playing Major League Baseball.  There's no base-stealing in Hunter's future, but he does believe he can push the envelope as a full-time two-way NFL player.  ""It's never been done,"" Hunter said.

Brown, promoted to offensive coordinator last week after Shane Waldron was fired, found some success last Sunday when Williams drove the Bears into position for a game-winning field goal that was blocked in a 20-19 loss to the Green Bay Packers.  What showed up on film when Williams and Brown huddled to review Week 11 was a tad different from the on-field results. Williams -- the No. 1 pick in the 2024 draft still feeling his way through the gradual progression of a franchise quarterback -- said the ""simplified"" offense isn't one that was whittled down to aid understanding. Rather, Brown brought such a finite degree of detail and thought to each play that his call sheet eventually will become a reference point with tens of dozens of subcontext for Williams to sort in real time.  ""We didn't reinvent the wheel for those three or four days that Thomas became the offensive coordinator and play caller,"" Williams said. ""I think the decisiveness, all of that came from our meetings and how we're going to do things. It came from being able to get play calls in faster and being able to get up there and not feel like you're rushed or not feel like you need to hurry up and get the ball snapped. ""All of these small things -- details of routes, details of the blocking, details of the path of running backs and how we're going to do things -- I think that led into all of what happened last week. We didn't come out with the win, but how we played efficiently and physically, that leads into it."" Fellow rookie and top-10 pick Rome Odunze felt like he was back at Washington for moments because of the rapidity with which Brown got calls to Williams, who relayed them to the huddle and hurried the team to the line of scrimmage with a newfound command.  There was a different type of clarity and confidence eminating from Brown down through the offensive chain of command on the field.  ""As wide receivers, we're kind of looking at the defense as well and reading those things along with Caleb. So understanding what kind of coverage look we're getting and what technique the DBs are playing on us allows us to kind of build a plan for that snap. Same thing with Caleb,"" Odunze said. ""He just has to do it at a higher level. So it helps us all."" Veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen said that in hindsight, the wheels started coming off for the Bears in training camp. In his opinion, Waldron was ""too nice,"" and he allowed mistakes and lack of detail and focus to become accepted.  ""That's football and that's life,"" Odunze said. ""Doing the little things right will eventually show on a bigger stage."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Mitch Mascari added 15 points. Nijel Pack led Miami (3-1) with 17 points and five assists. Matthew Cleveland and Jalen Blackmon added 12 points each.

Drake get off to a 7-0 start against the Hurricanes, and the Bulldogs kept rolling for a 36-27 advantage at the break. The Bulldogs dominated in several areas in the first half, including paint points (22-4); shooting percentage (48.4 percent to 30 percent); and offensive rebounds (7-1). Stirtz led Drake in the first half with 10 points and four assists. Three of those assists came on alley-oop passes that led to two Nate Ferguson dunks and a layup. Miami starters Lynn Kidd and Brandon Johnson did not score in the first half as Drake took the Hurricanes out of their normal offense. Miami played 10 players early, looking for answers.

He is joined by No. 15 Shelton Henderson (Bellaire High in Bellaire, Texas), No. 19 Nikolas Khamenia (Harvard-Westlake High, Los Angeles) and No. 21 Cayden Boozer, Cameron's twin. The Boozers play at Columbus High School in Miami. Cayden Boozer is a guard, and the others are forwards. Scheyer said Thursday that this group falls in line with the way he's trying to build the program since taking over from his mentor, Mike Krzyzewski. ""Individually with each of these guys, we're thrilled to get them here, but for me, it's the makeup of the class that I'm so excited about,"" he said. ""There's really two main things we look for in this class and ... the first thing is competitiveness. And when you think about Shelton Henderson, when you think about Cayden Boozer, when you think about Nik Khamenia, when you think about Cam Boozer, the word competitiveness comes to mind with all four of those guys. That was really important to us and how we continue to build the program. How we continue to move this thing forward is bring in high-level competitors.  ""The second thing for us is feel or basketball instincts, and when combine their competitiveness and you combine their IQ and feel for the game, that's been the recipe for some of our most special teams here."" Scheyer, who became Duke's head coach ahead of the 2022-23 season, signed the top class in 2022 and 2024 and the No. 2 class in the in-between year. The players already have achieved success in their careers. The Boozers played on three consecutive Florida state high school champions and also won gold medals in U16 and U17 competitions with USA Basketball. Khamenia won back-to-back state titles, and he and Henderson were members of the gold-medal winning U18 team at the FIBA AmeriCup over the summer.

The Tar Heels (2-1) are among the main attractions at the eight-team event in Maui, which also includes two-time reigning national champion UConn. Before North Carolina begins the tournament Monday against another 2024 NCAA Tournament team, Dayton, the Tar Heels contend with an undefeated Hawaii team on the island of Oahu. ""Getting on that time zone is important for us,"" North Carolina coach Hubert Davis said before making the trek to Hawaii. The matchup with the Rainbow Warriors tips off at 7:30 p.m. local time, which is a 12:30 a.m. Saturday morning tip on Eastern Time. Davis hopes for a similar outcome to the 2016-17 season when he was an assistant to North Carolina coach Roy Williams. The Tar Heels won 83-68 at Hawaii that year before rolling to the Maui Invitational crown and ultimately winning the program's sixth national championship. The 2024-25 Tar Heels again harbor aspirations of cutting down the nets both in Maui and at the Final Four with a roster built around All-American RJ Davis and freshman phenom turned standout sophomore Elliot Cadeau. The backcourt tandem paces an explosive offense that has produced at least 89 points in each of its first three games. Hawaii (4-0), meanwhile, has yet to allow more than 69 points in any of its first four outings. The Warriors feature a new-look lineup compared to a season ago when they won 20 games for a second consecutive campaign. The group is not lacking for experience, however. Big man Tanner Christensen, averaging a team-leading 17.5 points per game along with 6.5 rebounds, came to Hawaii from Utah Tech and Idaho, with 93 career starts. Christensen was named Big West Conference Player of the Week on Monday following a 25-point performance in Sunday's 73-68 overtime win versus Weber State. Christensen's frontcourt mate, Gytis Nemeiksa, played significant minutes last season at Xavier. He is averaging 11.3 points and a team-high 6.8 rebounds per game this season. Their strong interior play is a shift from coach Eran Ganot's previous teams that at times relied on 3-point shooting. Hawaii is shooting 51.4 percent overall but just 27.8 percent from deep. ""I know people can easily say teams or players live and die by the (3-pointer) just because it's an easy way to go to, but that's never been us,"" Ganot told the ""Marching to Madness"" podcast this week. ""I'm encouraged that we can find ways to have some success, especially late in games."" The Rainbow Warriors limited Weber State to 22.2 percent shooting (4 of 18) from behind the arc. None of their first four opponents made more than six 3-pointers. Solving the Hawaii defense is part of the overall learning experience Davis said he hopes North Carolina takes away from its visit to the islands. ""We've shown signs of playing great defense and being efficient on the offensive side end. It's about starting there and staying at that level,"" the coach said. ""Those are things not just about the next week or week-and-a-half, but for the whole year."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Vanderbilt's surge moved head coach Clark Lea from the proverbial hot seat to coach of the year candidacy. He will be facing Brian Kelly, his former boss when Lea was defensive coordinator at Notre Dame.   The heat was turned up on Kelly after a 27-16 loss at Florida last Saturday.    ""You have to examine everything that you do on a day-to-day basis and make sure that you're addressing those things that are most important to getting the right outcomes,"" Kelly said.

The Bears are vying to keep those good vibes going into their next Big 12 test at Houston on Saturday.   Baylor (6-4, 4-3 Big 12) outgunned West Virginia 49-35 last week to continue its turnaround from a 2-4 start. That same day, a school spokesperson said Aranda -- whose Bears went 6-7 and 3-9 in the two seasons since winning the 2021 Big 12 title and the Sugar Bowl -- will return next season.   ""I feel like they've had my back the whole way,"" Aranda said Monday of the endorsement.   Sawyer Robertson threw for a career-high 329 yards and three touchdowns against West Virginia. Bryson Washington racked up 123 rushing yards, five receptions for 59 yards and four total touchdowns -- his second straight game with four.   ""There's some good energy and confidence right now with the team,"" Aranda said. ""For sure, they see the challenge ahead with a really strong Houston team, I want to say defensively particularly. Their front is probably the best that we've played or that we're gonna play.""   Averaging 45.8 points per game during its winning streak, the Bears are trying to tighten things up defensively. They've allowed a hefty 33 points per game in the same stretch.  But the Bears might get a breather with Houston ranked second-to-last in the FBS in scoring at 14.0 points per game.   The Cougars (4-6, 3-4) fell 27-3 to Arizona last Friday and now must win out to become bowl-eligible. That means beating both Baylor and BYU, which is No. 14 in the College Football Playoff rankings after losing to Kansas. ""I don't talk about it much,"" Houston coach Willie Fritz said. ""I just want to play as good as we can against Baylor. That's all I'm worried about. ... This is a really good team that's on a good roll right now. They're playing excellent on offense.""   To illustrate the struggles of Houston's passing game, Zeon Chriss' 191 passing yards in the loss to Arizona marked the Cougars' second-best team total since Sept. 14. On three occasions, Houston has failed to hit 100 passing yards.   Baylor and Houston played last year for the first time since 1995. Houston won on the road, 25-24, after converting a two-point conversion on its first possession of overtime.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

When the Razorbacks avoid turnovers and sacks, they win. When opponents make them cough up the ball and get to quarterback Taylen Green, as Texas did last week in a 20-10 decision, Arkansas loses. At 5-5 and needing a win to become bowl-eligible, the Razorbacks seek the mistake-free version of themselves Saturday in Fayetteville when Louisiana Tech visits for a non-conference contest. Arkansas has allowed 20 sacks in four Southeastern Conference losses, including six last week. It also gave up a pair of crushing turnovers, including a fumble by freshman CJ Brown after his first career catch deep in Texas territory with 6:55 left. The Razorbacks never saw the ball again. ""That's kind of been the story of all our losses and all our wins, you know, depending on what we do with turnovers,"" Arkansas coach Sam Pittman said. Green has thrown for 2,363 yards and 11 touchdowns but has also tossed eight interceptions and hung on to the ball too long at times. ""That's one thing in my game that I have to be better at,"" he said. Meanwhile, the Bulldogs (4-6) kept their bowl hopes alive with a 12-7 Conference USA win at Western Kentucky, which was 5-0 in the league. Buck Buchanan hit four field goals for Louisiana Tech and the defense held the high-powered Hilltoppers to just 215 total yards. Third-year coach Sonny Cumbie said his team persevered after enduring adversity most of the season. ""I talked to our team about being uncommon,"" he said. ""They have an uncommon fight and grit.

The Bulldogs average just 112.2 yards per game on the ground but surprised Western Kentucky by coming up with 209 in 49 attempts, including 103 from Amani Givens.

And in a season that began with the Red Raiders and Cowboys plotting a big impact in the new-look Big 12 Conference, they're both surprised to be here. But that's the backdrop when they meet after notable missteps by the Red Raiders. The season has been unraveling for most of the last two months for the Cowboys. Neither team is in contention for the conference championship game with two weeks to go.  Texas Tech (6-4, 4-3) has dropped three of its last four league games after a promising start. Oklahoma State (3-7, 0-7) is pushing to the finish of its worst season since coach Mike Gundy's debut in 2005. ""I'm as frustrated as anybody else,"" said Red Raiders coach Joey McGuire, who has guided his team to a third straight bowl-eligible season in his third season. ""It's frustrating to me the opportunities that we've let get away because we haven't been good enough on game day."" Gundy can certainly relate. The Cowboys finish with a losing record for just the second time in his 20-year tenure and an 18-year bowl game streak won't make it to 19.  Ranked in the preseason Top 25, Oklahoma State began the season 3-0 with a solid victory against Arkansas but a wave of injuries has yielded seven losses in a row - four by 21 points or more.  The Cowboys lost defensive starters Collin Olliver, Nick Martin and Cameron Epps to season-ending injuries. They head into Saturday ranked last in the Big 12 in total defense, allowing just a tick under 500 yards a game, and next-to-last in scoring defense with foes averaging 31.9 points.  Texas Tech is the only team that has given up more points: 35.1 per game. The Red Raiders have been effective with the ball in their hands. They rank second in the league with 441 yards per contest and are the Big 12's highest-scoring offense at 35.5 points a game. So the challenge is daunting for the Cowboys, who hit mid-November playing out the string for the first time since Gundy took over. But Gundy expects his team's effort to be at the same level the program has expected since he grabbed the reins at his alma mater and built one of the most consistent programs in the Big 12. ""It's competition, same thing that I would say each week, and that when these guys walk on campus, they should be committed to themselves and to the team and then to whoever helped get them here and their family, or whoever raised them and put a lot into them,"" Gundy said. ""The most important thing that they can do is continue to train and work and stay together and compete, which they have."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Wisconsin coach Luke Fickell wasn't expecting to fire the Badgers' play-caller.   But that's the situation as Fickell's Badgers get ready to meet the Cornhuskers on Saturday afternoon in Lincoln, Neb.   Fickell dismissed offensive coordinator Phil Longo on Sunday, the day after Wisconsin lost to No. 1 Oregon 16-13 in Madison, Wis. The Badgers (5-5, 3-4 Big Ten) led 13-6 with 4:43 left in the third quarter, but produced only 21 yards on four possessions -- punt, punt, downs, interception -- in the fourth quarter and failed to add to the lead.   Oregon scored a tying touchdown and kicked a game-winning field goal with 2:36 to play.   As much as Fickell didn't sound interested in talking about Longo's departure, it was a prime topic. He emphasized that it was time for the program to ""move forward.""   ""It's not about play calls, it's not about points scored, it's not about touchdowns. It's moving forward with leadership, and that's, to me, what we have to do and why we're doing it right now,"" said Fickell, who is in his third year at Wisconsin and brought in before Longo last season.   The Badgers are averaging 23.9 points per game and have lost three games in a row while scoring 36 total points.   They've also played most of the season with backup quarterback Braedyn Locke running the offense. Starter Tyler Van Dyke went down with a knee injury in Week 3 against Alabama. Locke has been inconsistent at best, completing 55 percent of his passes for 1,514 yards. He has an equal number of interceptions as touchdowns (9).   Then there's Holgorsen, a head coach for 13 seasons who most recently ran the show at Houston from 2019-23. Nebraska head coach Matt Rhule brought Holgorsen in during the Cornhuskers' bye week to get his thoughts about the offense.   ""(Rhule) said, 'Just come try to figure this out, I need your help.' I was grateful to him for saying, 'I need your help,' I think a great deal of him. I think a great deal of this program, so I was excited to jump on it,"" Holgorsen said.   Apparently impressed with the newcomer's perspective, Rhule installed him as offensive coordinator. His predecessor, Marcus Satterfield, is working as tight ends coach.   Holgorsen's debut couldn't prevent the Cornhuskers (5-5, 2-5) from losing their fourth straight game, 28-20, at Southern California. The hosts led 21-20 before extending their lead with 2:09 to play.   Freshman quarterback Dylan Raiola then led Nebraska on a 13-play, 56-yard drive. On first-and-15 at the USC 19 with five seconds left, Raiola was picked off in the endzone.   ""We left a lot out there offensively,"" Rhule said. ""The offense is at some point here going to really take off with the kind of direction we're headed.""

Can they find","Disappointments and down seasons are nothing new for the Cleveland Browns, but the team’s current state feels uniquely grim. A sense of permanence surrounds the franchise's struggles, exacerbated by the acquisition of quarterback Deshaun Watson. His fully guaranteed contract has become an anchor weighing down the organization, with no feasible escape in sight. Watson has shown flashes of potential in his three seasons with Cleveland, but for the most part, his tenure has been a sobering reminder of the team’s bleak outlook. With a championship-caliber defense, there was hope last season that head coach Kevin Stefanski and general manager Andrew Berry had found a path forward. That optimism spiked after the late-season signing of veteran Joe Flacco, who came out of retirement to deliver a surprisingly strong December. Flacco reinvigorated the offense, which at times looked unstoppable. But the momentum fizzled when offseason decisions were made. The Browns opted for continuity, betting on a healthy Watson to return to form after his season-ending surgery. Instead, Cleveland has been plagued by injuries on the offensive line, a punchless running game without Nick Chubb, and a passing attack hampered by Watson’s inconsistency. Watson’s inability to find Amari Cooper—or anyone else for that matter—has left the Browns’ offense lifeless. Cooper might as well be Alice Cooper, Michael Cooper, or even Mark Cooper from Hangin’ with Mr. Cooper. The results have been that disappointing. In October, Watson suffered another season-ending injury, leaving Cleveland with a 1-6 record under his leadership and little reason for optimism. The quarterback, once heralded for his elite skills, now resembles a rusted-out Chevette after too many rebuilds. Oddly enough, Watson’s absence seemed to relieve some of the offense’s pressure. Stefanski no longer had to claim Watson gave the Browns the best chance to win. The team responded by shocking the Baltimore Ravens in one of the season’s most unexpected upsets. But the magic Stefanski found with Flacco is long gone. Jameis Winston, now at the helm, is playing with purpose, but he’s steering a makeshift operation. Even the team’s own personnel seem to lack faith in the Browns’ chances. The weight holding Cleveland back remains Watson’s guaranteed contract. The financial commitment is a burden the Browns can’t escape without hamstringing the franchise for years. Berry may publicly express confidence in Watson’s ability to rebound, but it’s hard to believe he sees the quarterback as capable of leading Cleveland to consecutive wins, let alone an AFC North title. Berry’s fingerprints are all over this roster, and until the Watson problem is resolved, the Browns are stuck paddling a sinking ship, knowing no amount of effort can deliver real progress.

Journalist Matt Shea was set to interview Paul in Puerto Rico for BBC’s new documentary, “Logan Paul: Bad Influence?” which claims to have new evidence regarding accusations that Paul promoted shady cryptocurrency projects without disclosing that he had a stake in them, resulting in massive paychecks.  Shea finally got his chance to interview Paul at his gym. At least he thought. Instead, when he arrived, he was met by a well-known imposter, Rodney Petersen, who does look a little bit like Paul. Petersen sat down for the interview and acted exactly like Paul. Shea asked the lookalike several questions before calling out that it wasn't Paul, including what it feels like to be one of the most famous people in the world. “I have to say, the real Logan Paul looks very different,” Shea interrupted, visibly irritated. Shea refused to proceed with the interview, as Petersen insisted on keeping the prank going for a little bit longer. “You came all the way to Puerto Rico from England. This is your interview. What do you got?” Shea still refused, and as he was about to get up out of his chair, a few “protestors” began repeatedly chanting anti-BBC remarks in reference to Huw Edwards, a former newscaster who was charged with three counts of making indecent images of children. The full clip on Paul's YouTube channel is quite the watch, and you could tell that Shea was completely mind-blown over the stunt. Shea maintains that this was childish behavior from Paul. And while that might be somewhat true, what in the world did he actually expect?  The title of the documentary literally references exposing Paul, so why on Earth would he ever help him with that or be a part of a hit piece against him?  To maintain his innocence? According to a source, the allegations that the BBC presented Paul and his team with were a regurgitation of claims he has already denied. Paul explains in his YouTube video that it's infuriating for a network with such a checkered past to try and attack his character, business practices, ethics and morals in the way that they did when they’ve done so little to address their own wrongdoings and those of the individuals they employ. Paul laid out several instances where the BBC employed individuals that have been both accused and found guilty of pedophilia, possessing child pornography, harassment, assault and rape.  The ultimate get back? He donated $50,000 to the Inspiring Children Foundation, an organization that lifts up underprivileged youth.  Paul seems pretty convinced that he did nothing wrong in this entire situation. And to troll a major news outlet, he must be pretty confident in his innocence. This is a classic prank. Hit him with the lookalike Jim Halpert from The Office. There’s nothing to be mad about here. Chalk it up to the game. Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Arizona is led by preseason All-American fifth-year guard Caleb Love. Love has a personal rivalry with Duke, having played three years at North Carolina before transferring to Arizona last season. He scored 28 points when North Carolina eliminated Duke in the 2022 Final Four. Love's performance in a 103-88 loss last Friday at Wisconsin mirrored that of the Wildcats' struggles, scoring only six points on 2-of-13 shooting from the field before fouling out with 4:57 left. The Wildcats never led and their perimeter defense allowed Wisconsin 12 shots from 3-point range. John Tonje burned Arizona with 41 points. ""I'm not interested in going undefeated, not at all,"" Lloyd said. ""Our program's ready to take the next step and I'm ready to lead the charge. We've got to coach better. We've got to play better. ""We're going to go back, take a breath, get home, and, and we're excited for the opportunity we got (against Duke)."" Duke had the opportunity to reset itself after losing to Kentucky 77-72 at Atlanta on Nov. 12. The Blue Devils defeated Wofford 86-35 at home last weekend. Tyrese Proctor led a balanced scoring effort with 15 points. Flagg had nine rebounds with eight points, six assists, three steals and two blocked shots. ""A great bounce-back game,"" Scheyer said. ""I am really proud of how we shared the ball (season-high 24 assists on 30 made field goals). We've talked a lot about the process of the season, how no matter what, win or lose, how you respond is really important."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

The 23-year-old Togo international is signed as a designated player through 2028 with an option for 2029. ""We're thrilled to welcome Kevin to FC Cincinnati,"" general manager Chris Albright said. ""He is a talented, young striker with exceptional character. Kevin has been one of the most productive forwards in Europe over the last two years, showcasing elite physicality, finishing ability and work ethic.

No. 20 Arkansas accomplished the feat during Monday's 91-72 home win against Pacific and will try to maintain the intensity during Friday night's game in Fayetteville, Ark., against in-state foe Little Rock. Arkansas (3-1) scored 25 of the game's final 36 points to pull away from Pacific and win consecutive games for the first time this season. ""I mean, we trust our defense,"" Boogie Fland said. ""... So (we're) just staying disciplined and making adjustments throughout the game."" Injuries to frontcourt veterans Trevon Brazile and Jonas Aidoo presented a challenge to the Razorbacks' depth. Only seven Arkansas players saw action, logging between 22 and 35 minutes. While the team's frenetic style took a toll on the Tigers, the Razorbacks ultimately felt just fine. Arkansas shot 59.6 percent from the field and produced four scorers in double figures. Adou Thiero led the way with 23 points and matched Johnell Davis for the team high with six rebounds. ""We just wanted to come out and have fun and show our grit on defense and just let that carry us,"" Thiero said. ""Offensively we were just trying to let the game come to us and find each other open shots."" The Razorbacks hope to spread the wealth not only in the flow of the game, but within the rotation as they await the return of Brazile and Aidoo. ""You're trying to have fun. You want those guys back so they can get some time,"" Fland said. ""It's a team sport and just everybody doing it together because we love each other. We're wishing they come back faster and going with the flow."" Little Rock improved to 2-2 on a six-game road trip with Wednesday's 71-57 victory at Tulsa. The Trojans (3-2) outscored the Golden Hurricane 51-32 after halftime, shooting a blazing 19-for-27 (70.4 percent) from the floor after the break. Little Rock forced Tulsa into 33.3 percent shooting after halftime, including 4 of 20 from long range, heeding the guidance of its coach, Darrell Walker. ""Coach just told us at halftime to be aggressive and keep boxing out and guard our tails off,"" said Jonathan Lawson, who scored 16 of his game-high 23 points down the stretch in the second half. Lawson added seven rebounds and five assists. Isaiah Lewis scored 17 points, Mwani Wilkinson had 16 points and nine rebounds, and Ante Beljan had 11 points. Trojans reserve Creed Williamson missed the game with an injury. Should he play Friday, it will mark a chance to suit up against his dad's alma mater.

Gators coach Todd Golden would prefer for his team to play a full 40 minutes, though, starting with Friday night's home game against Southern Illinois in Gainesville, Fla. Florida (5-0) led 46-22 at halftime and appeared to be on its way to a 40- or 50-point stomping of the Rattlers. But the Gators shot only 34 percent from the field in the second half and sent the visitors to the foul line 19 times. It is little wonder that Golden wasn't thrilled with how his team closed the game. ""Our expectation is to be able to play two complete halves, a full 40 minutes,"" he said. ""I thought we played 20 really good minutes into the first half and we were just OK in the second ... a lot to improve on. ""We allowed (missed shots) to affect our defense a little bit in the second half, and we fouled way too much on the defensive end. I just thought in the second half we let our foot off the gas."" The Gators haven't played a demanding schedule but have taken care of business, outscoring opponents by an average of nearly 20 points per game. They've scored at least 81 points in every contest. Five players are averaging double figures in points for Florida, led by guard Walter Clayton Jr. at 18.4 per game. Will Richard (15), Florida Atlantic transfer Alijah Martin (13.6), Alex Condon (12.2) and Chattanooga transfer Sam Alexis (10) also are consistent offensive threats. If there's a weakness in the Gators' attack, it's 3-point shooting, which stands at 28.9 percent for the season. But Richard and Martin, each of whom are under 27 percent, have proved capable from the arc during their careers. While Florida looks to play 40 consistent minutes, the Salukis (2-2) will try to carry the form from Monday night's 69-44 rout of North Dakota State into the first of four straight games away from Carbondale. They held the high-scoring Bison to 26.5 percent shooting from the field, including 5 of 27 from the 3-point line. First-year Southern Illinois coach Scott Nagy, who has won 579 games in a 30-year career that's included stops at South Dakota State and Wright State, said the week away from home will be beneficial to his squad. After the game at Florida, Southern Illinois will journey to a three-game, three-day tournament in Estero, Fla. ""We're one of the harder teams to prepare for because we don't run many sets,"" Nagy said. ""Can we focus on the next game? I kind of like it because I think we play better when we give them less information."" Guard Elijah Elliott, a transfer from Texas Rio Grande Valley, leads the Salukis with an average of 16.5 points per game on 55.3 percent shooting.

It won't be an easy task against a Houston program that has consistently been among the nation's best in the Kelvin Sampson era. The Cougars rank in the top five nationally in both offensive and defensive rating in the kenpom.com stats as they've started 2-1, with their loss coming to an Auburn team that also ranks top five in both metrics.  ""We have another great opportunity Friday night,"" Claxton said. ""We're not going to sneak up on them. I know Sampson is going to have them ready to go out there and compete and play hard, but we're going to do the same thing."" Houston's wins have come in dominant fashion. The Cougars beat Jackson State 97-40 in their season opener and enter Friday's game after a 91-45 win Wednesday over Louisiana, with the 74-69 loss to then-No. 11 Auburn sandwiched in between. The Cougars again are a deep team, with seven players averaging at least eight points per game. Three different players have led the team in scoring in each of the first three games.  ""The thing that we've always been good at here is bringing our team along,"" Sampson said. ""We're not trying to be the best team in the country on November the 5th, or 10th. Or come out breathing fire and not have a slow start. That's all part of the process. When you win by (that much), it's because of defense."" Houston's engine to this point has been Milos Uzan, who is averaging 10.3 points and a team-high 6.3 assists per game. Uzan also has been a factor on defense with an average of 2 steals per game. J'Wan Roberts and L.J. Cryer average a team-best 12.3 points per game.  Claxton is looking to take Hofstra (4-1) to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since back-to-back berths in 2000 and 2001, when Jay Wright coached the Pride.  Claxton, the point guard on the 2000 tournament team, has led Hofstra to 20-plus wins in his first three seasons on the sideline. The Pride enter Friday's game coming off their first loss of the season, 79-61 against Florida State.  Hofstra beat Iona by 14 and UMass in overtime by four, with a 49-48 win over Seton Hall in the middle. They also won their season opener 89-62 over Division III foe SUNY Old Westbury.  Iona transfer Jean Aranguren leads Hofstra in all three major statistical categories, averaging 18 points, 6.8 rebounds and 4.8 assists per game. He nearly notched a triple-double in Hofstra's 14-point win over his former team, scoring 18 points while tallying nine rebounds and nine assists.  Claxton and Hofstra aren't strangers to the environment in Houston, either. The Pride took a then-No. 15 Houston team to overtime in Claxton's first game as head coach, losing 83-75 in the 2021-22 season.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Welcome to an election year, folks. Six NFL teams will go at it on Thanksgiving, with the Detroit Lions hosting the Chicago Bears, the New York Giants visiting the Dallas Cowboys and the Miami Dolphins hitting the road to face the Green Bay Packers. This isn’t Christmas, but allow us to put on our cap and nightgown like Ebenezer Scrooge once did so that we can take a trip back to the past to relive some of Turkey Day’s best games. Someone should have suggested putting a body on Randy Moss, no? Moss finished with only three catches—they just all happened to be touchdowns of at least 51 yards for a grand total of 163 yards on the day. The only question is, what type of disastrous performance does Dallas have in store for us this year? Six passing touchdowns. Count ‘em. Six. That’s how many Indianapolis signal-caller Peyton Manning had against the Lions to match a Thanksgiving Day record. However, he wasn’t necessarily spreading out the wealth, as three of those scores went to Marvin Harrison and the other three went to Brandon Stokley. Making the performance that much more impressive was the fact that Manning had all of his TD passes in the first three quarters. Surprisingly, Detroit outgained the Colts 386-356. Tom Brady threw for 323 yards and three touchdowns while rushing for a fourth, but it was New York quarterback Mark Sanchez who stole the spotlight—for all the wrong reasons. Early in the second quarter, Sanchez tried to scramble on a busted play and failed miserably, running into his own offensive line. The ball came free when Sanchez collided with Brandon Moore, and thus the “butt fumble” was born.  New England scooped up the ball and scored on the play, adding insult to injury. Bad day to be a Jets fan. Before there was Manning, there was Miami’s Bob Griese. Griese was the first one to throw for six touchdowns on Thanksgiving, and he helped the Dolphins hang 55 points, a record for the holiday at the time. Plenty of quarterbacks have come and gone for Miami since Griese was under center. Tua Tagovailoa is now the guy, and six TD passes is never out of the question with playmakers like Tyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle and De’Von Achane alongside him. No game on Thanksgiving had ever gone to overtime until this one, but fans didn’t end up getting all that much extra football. Dave Williams found the end zone on a 95-yard return on the opening kickoff of OT, with his fellow Bears rushing out onto the gridiron as he reached midfield during the play. Chicago had trailed 17-3 in the third quarter. Don’t be expecting the Bears to pull off big plays like this nowadays, though.   Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

""I think we're all pretty hard on each other in the locker room when it's just the players waiting for the coaches,"" Klesmit said. ""There wasn't anything specific coach said in the huddle. I think we all kinda knew the issue that had just happened and how we had to fix it."" UCF has been in some battles to reach 4-0, coming in off an 80-69 home win over Tennessee Tech on Tuesday.  Keyshawn Hall led UCF with 20 points and eight rebounds. Jordan Ivy-Curry added 15 points and Dallan ""Deebo"" Coleman scored 14. Darius Johnson also joined the 1,000-point club with his six points, the first Knights player to reach the milestone since Tacko Fall (2019). ""When we build the lead, we have to learn how to sustain and build on it,"" UCF coach Johnny Dawkins said. ""Our guys played with a lot of poise down the stretch and gave us a chance to win the game."" Dawkins continued: ""I thought Deebo was terrific; he gave us a huge lift, especially in the first half. His leadership showed the whole game. He's a senior and he's already accomplished in college. He provided that for us, and I was happy to see him knock those shots down tonight."" Before the Tennessee Tech game, the Knights beat then-No. 13 Texas A&M by three in the season opener, Purdue Fort Wayne by seven, and Florida Atlantic by six.

Knecht's 3-point promise already has been realized just 14 games into his NBA career. The 6-foot-6 sharpshooter tied an NBA rookie record with nine made baskets from beyond the arc in Tuesday's 124-118 victory over the visiting Utah Jazz.  Not only did Knecht go 9 of 12 (75 percent) from long distance Tuesday, he is 21 of 31 (67.8 percent) over the past four games. He also has proved to be exactly the shooter the Lakers were seeking to partner with LeBron James and Anthony Davis. ""I just caught fire, and I just kept letting everything fly,"" Knecht said on Spectrum SportsNet. ""My teammates kept looking for me and running plays. Shout-out to them and (coach) JJ (Redick) for letting me go out there and keep letting that thing fly."" Knecht's shooting spree coincides with the Lakers' six-game winning streak. Los Angeles also is 7-0 at home this season and is one of three teams that has yet to lose in its own building, along with Cleveland and Orlando. While Davis leads the Lakers with averages of 30.7 points and 11.4 rebounds a game, Knecht's career-best 37 points Tuesday boosted his per-game average to 11.3 points on the season and 24.3 over his last four games. ""It's special to watch; it's fun,"" James said of Knecht's performance. ""... When a guy gets hot like that, you feel like you can throw anything into the ocean. It's going in for sure."" The Magic will play in the Los Angeles area for the second time in two nights after dropping a 104-93 decision against the host Clippers on Wednesday. The loss ended the Magic's six-game winning streak that came while Paolo Banchero has been on the sideline with an oblique injury. Orlando held its opponents under 100 points in every game of the winning run before the Clippers eclipsed the century mark. Second-year guard Anthony Black is starting to come into his own, with five double-digit scoring games in his last eight contests. He had a team-best 17 points Wednesday and a season-high 20 in a 109-99 road victory over the Phoenix Suns on Monday. Black averaged 4.6 points last season, is up to 9.0 this season and has averaged 11.3 points in his last eight games. He also has 17 assists over his last two games. ""From a year ago to now, his maturity has gone to a different level,"" Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said of Black. ""... Where he can go, I think it's just gonna be continued leadership and vocal presence on the court with this group, and just continue to command the floor."" Franz Wagner, the most recent Eastern Conference Player of the Week, leads Orlando with 22.3 points per game while Jalen Suggs is averaging 15. Without an average of 8.8 rebounds from both Banchero (five games) and Wendell Carter Jr. (six), Goga Bitadze leads the Magic with 6.4 per game. Carter missed his ninth consecutive game for the Magic with a left foot injury but has a chance of returning against the Lakers.

The Raiders' season-defining skid began with a 34-18 loss to the Broncos in Denver on Oct. 6. They've yet to recover.  The losses haven't been within a touchdown for Las Vegas (2-8), save for a five-point setback to the Los Angeles Rams on Oct. 20 in which it trailed 20-6 before making three straight field goals to make the final score look a bit more competitive.  The Broncos (6-5), on the other hand, have been a pleasant surprise.  Expectations for Bo Nix's rookie year weren't exactly through the roof, but the outlook has changed with the quarterback's recent performance. Nix has thrown 2,275 yards so far this season in addition to 14 touchdowns. Over the past two games, Nix has 522 passing yards with six touchdowns and zero interceptions. ""It's hard to pick out specific things (that he's doing well),"" Broncos coach Sean Payton said. ""I mean, we're blocking well. I think we have balance. I say this all the time, your allies at that position are your defense. He's certainly settled in third down (and) red zone. ""You're learning each week and then pretty soon you're like, I belong here. It's clear (Nix) belongs here."" For Nix, his performance earned him his first career AFC Player of the Week honor.  ""It's a great honor,"" Nix said. ""It's a great responsibility, but at the same time, it doesn't end with just that. You obviously got to go back, continue, and they only remember your last game. You got to go out there and continue to do it. ""It's a great honor. Many great players have won the award in the past. It's an honor to be included and be that recipient, but there's a lot of work left to be done."" Las Vegas starter Gardner Minshew hasn't had the same success recently.  Minshew has just eight passing touchdowns and nine interceptions, and his tally of 1,783 yards for the season ranks a lackluster 24th overall among starting quarterbacks.  The Raiders' ground attack hasn't been much of a help either, as the team ranks last in the league with 75.2 rushing yards per game.  Las Vegas also is nursing several injuries, including a shoulder injury to cornerback Jakorian Bennett. He sustained the injury during the first quarter of the Raiders' 34-19 loss to the Miami Dolphins last Sunday. ""It's one of the ones you've got to just swallow, you've got to take it,"" Las Vegas coach Antonio Pierce said. ""There's been some non-contact injuries. There's been guys getting rolled up.

But Vanecek also made the trip, and Warsofsky remained undecided about who to start in goal Thursday against the Blues. Forward Brayden Schenn and defenseman Justin Faulk didn't participate in practice for the Blues on Wednesday. Bannister termed it a ""maintenance day"" for both and said he expects them to play against the Sharks. Defenseman Pierre-Olivier Joseph practiced again Wednesday while continuing his comeback from a lower-body injury. Bannister was unsure if he would rejoin the lineup on Thursday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

The Devils will look to regain a share of the division lead and cool off the Hurricanes on Thursday night when the teams clash in Newark, N.J. The Devils have been idle since Saturday when they dropped a 4-0 decision to the host Tampa Bay Lightning.  The Hurricanes, in turn, will be completing a back-to-back road set after scoring three third-period goals Wednesday in a 4-1 win over the Philadelphia Flyers. The first quarter of the season has been a successful one for New Jersey, which is 12-7-2 under first-year head coach Sheldon Keefe. But the busy schedule has the Devils already trying to make up ground against the Hurricanes and Capitals, each of whom have three games in hand. The Capitals leapfrogged the Devils on Monday by recording a 6-2 victory over the Utah Hockey Club. Carolina seized sole possession of first place on Wednesday.  Keefe said he's hopeful the break will refresh the Devils, who are one point ahead of the fourth-place New York Rangers. The Rangers, however, have four games in hand.  ""The demands of the schedule being what it has been in the first 20 games of the season -- it's been a lot for us and the pace that's been more demanding than the rest of the league, quite frankly,"" Keefe said following practice Tuesday. ""Chance now to sort of take a breath."" The Hurricanes haven't allowed opponents much room to breathe during a three-game winning streak in which they've outscored the Flyers, Ottawa Senators and St. Louis Blues by a combined 12-2 margin. Carolina got off to a quick start Wednesday, when Jalen Chatfield scored on the team's second shot of the game just 30 seconds after the opening faceoff. But the Hurricanes didn't score again until Sebastian Aho collected the game-winner 1:03 into the third period. ""(The key is) restarting every night. Even (Thursday), we've got to take what we can learn from this game, the good and the bad, and get right back at it (on Thursday),"" Chatfield said. ""We can't be focusing on the past, ever, and we know we've got an experienced group, we've got a lot of good leaders and we try to bring it every night. Some nights it doesn't start the best, but we always find our game and once we do that, we're fine."" Following Aho's goal, Jordan Staal and Jack Roslovic scored within a 55-second span for the Hurricanes, who outshot the Flyers 20-15 in the first two periods before enjoying a 17-4 advantage in the third. ""I liked how we answered in the third -- I thought the game was there and now we've got to make a statement because I don't love the first two periods, that's for sure,"" Hurricanes coach Rod Brind'Amour said after his team defeated the Flyers. ""But again, you've got the other team and they're doing their thing. But I thought it was a good collective effort in the third."" Carolina has scored 72 goals this season, tied for second in the Eastern Conference. The Hurricanes have put up at least four goals in 12 of the past 13 games (11-2-0). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

The 3-0 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs on Wednesday dropped Vegas to just 3-4-2 on the road this season. It also marked the first time the Golden Knights were shut out since last season at Colorado (Jan. 10). That loss came on the heels of a 5-2 setback to the Washington Capitals on Sunday. Vegas also lost to the Capitals on Oct. 15, a defeat that started a three-game losing skid (0-2-1). The Golden Knights entered Wednesday's setback converting on 35 percent of their road power plays, tops in the NHL, but went 0-for-3 with the extra man in Toronto.  ""Yeah, frustrating,"" said forward Jack Eichel, who had a six-game point streak snapped in the shutout loss. ""Obviously had some power-play opportunities, and our power play has helped us a lot this year but we weren't able to do that tonight. I think that was sort of the difference. It's frustrating. We need to find ways to score goals.""  Eichel was asked if the Golden Knights could benefit from a quick turnaround.  ""Yeah, obviously we're playing in like 20 hours,"" he replied. ""Just learn from the game but we need to be better. It's frustrating. You lose a few in a row and you don't want to let this continue to go. Obviously we need to find a way to get two points. It's as simple as that. We have a competitive group in here and we'll respond well.""  The Golden Knights will be facing an Ottawa team that also is smarting after a pair of lopsided losses. The Senators followed up a 5-4 overtime loss versus the Philadelphia Flyers last Thursday with a 4-0 setback at the Carolina Hurricanes on Saturday and a 5-2 defeat at home to the Edmonton Oilers on Tuesday.  The Senators fell behind 3-1 in the first period to the Oilers on a pair of goals by superstar Connor McDavid. They trailed 5-1 midway through the third period before Josh Norris tipped in a Nick Jensen point shot with just 2:24 remaining to close the scoring.  ""Flat,"" Ottawa coach Travis Green said of his team's effort. ""Not a lot of energy. Not sharp with our execution. We looked flat tonight. It's frustrating for sure.""  ""I think as a group, and I think myself as well, the first two periods are probably the worst two periods I've played,"" Senators defenseman Thomas Chabot said. ""You've got to take some ownership. Fortunately, in hockey you have a chance to go at it soon again."" Ottawa captain Brady Tkachuk said he expects his team to bounce back with a strong effort versus Vegas. ""No more (expletive) excuses,"" Tkachuk said. ""Right now every game is a must-win. These are the moments, the games that could turn a season around. We know we're a good team."" ""We know it's going to be a tough game against Vegas,"" forward Drake Batherson added. ""They know how to win. Obviously they won a (Stanley) Cup a few years ago so it will be a good one. Just got to be ready to ground it out."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

The contest will tip off the Cal Classic, a week-long, four-team, round-robin affair that includes Sacramento State and Mercyhurst. Air Force (1-3) will be playing away from home for the first time. The Falcons beat Jacksonville State 73-67 in their second outing, but they were much more pleased with a competitive effort on Friday in a 79-71 loss to Belmont, an eight-time NCAA Tournament participant in the past 19 years. ""We played a really good team. Major progress,"" Air Force coach Joe Scott said. ""I don't want to sit in the locker room and say, 'We didn't play hard or we didn't ...' We looked like we're supposed to look. We played like we practiced. When that happens, you start to believe."" The Falcons have been led by the all-around play of Ethan Taylor, who is averaging 19.5 points, 8.0 rebounds and 4.5 assists. The senior has been on the court for 156 of a possible 160 minutes so far. Cal (3-1) has featured a much more balanced attack, with three players averaging in double figures and eight contributing at least 4.5 points per game. The Golden Bears received points and rebounds from eight players in a 71-66 victory at Southern California on Sunday, Cal's first nonconference road win in seven years. Andrej Stojakovic had 20 points and Jovan Blacksher Jr. 19 in the win, but coach Mark Madsen was most impressed with the team chemistry demonstrated by an entire roster of transfers playing together for just the fourth time. ""When you have that, great things are possible,"" Madsen said. ""There is so much more work to do. We're continuing to build this program into a national powerhouse.""

He was one of five double-digit scorers against Penn, as St. Joe's delivered a well-rounded performance. The Hawks shot 38.5 percent from 3-point range against the Quakers, dominated the boards 43-26, and forced 13 turnovers while only committing 10 fouls.

However, he also has lamented Michigan's turnover problems (17.8 per game) and a lack of offensive rebounds for a roster he says is ""the sixth-biggest team in the country."" Most of all, May is still searching for an identity out of his team. ""I was speaking to a coaching friend -- a very, very successful coaching friend slash mentor -- and I told him that I don't feel like we have an identity yet on either side of the ball,"" May said. ""His response was, 'You're not supposed to. You're four games in. You have a new team, you have to win in the margins now, you have to figure this stuff out. You may not have an identity until conference play.'"" A roster with only three players back from last season, Michigan will try and continue to figure out its identity against Tarleton State, which is off to a 1-4 start. The Texans were picked to finish sixth in the Western Athletic Conference. ""We're going to keep fighting the good fight and keep getting better every day,"" May said. ""No team is going to be perfect this time of year. So once again, it comes down to can you fix your issues and solve your problems? If we're still doing this in January, February, then we haven't done a very good job as a staff."" Four Michigan players are averaging double-figure scoring in the early going: Tre Donaldson (14 points per game), Nimari Burnett (11.8), Danny Wolf (11.5) and Roddy Gayle Jr. (10.5).

Moore and the Sooners take on East Texas A&M on Thursday night, and Oklahoma will be aiming to improve to 26-3 in nonconference home games under Sooners head coach Porter Moser, who picked up his 350th career victory on Saturday. One of Moore's biggest strengths is the way he plays in fastbreak opportunities, finishing them often with an exclamation point. In the win over Stetson, he had back-to-back dunks at one point. ""He's got to be in everybody's scouting report for transition,"" Moser said in a postgame interview Saturday. ""He runs so hard. He outruns you. If he gets ahead, it's going to be a great dunk. His energy, running, really helps us."" If the Sooners are to continue rolling, Moore has to be the one leading the way. ""He really pushes everybody, every day in practice,"" Moser said.

The Cowboys (3-7) took their fifth straight loss on Monday night, falling 34-10 to the Houston Texans. After a one-point loss to the rugged Pittsburgh Steelers, followed by the compressed schedule that led into the Thursday night game at Philadelphia, the Commanders were able to rest and get healthy with the extra days. ""I was able to reset and refocus, restart,"" rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels said Wednesday. ""It's kind of needed in a long season like that. It was great to get away for a little bit, but I'm glad that we're back now."" The offense can use a reset. Daniels completed just 59.1 percent of his passes against the Steelers and Eagles with a touchdown and an interception. He posted two of his three lowest passer ratings of the season in those games. The Commanders are averaging 22.5 points over their past four games, more than a touchdown less than over the first seven games of the season (31.1). ""I don't think anyone is hitting the panic button, but at the same time there's a lot to improve on,"" Washington tight end Zach Ertz said. ""There's a lot of urgency that goes with that."" It will be a reunion of sorts for Commanders head coach Dan Quinn, who served as Dallas' defensive coordinator for the previous three seasons. The Cowboys went 2-0 against the Commanders last season but arrive in D.C. a double-digit underdog after losing five games by a combined 172-70. ""We have a lot of moving parts going on, and we just have to be cleaner and more detailed in certain spots,"" Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy said. ""We're not playing well enough, not executing well enough, coaching well enough to overcome some of the mistakes we're making in critical times of the game."" The Cowboys' minus-11 turnover differential is tied for second worst in the league. On defense, Dallas ranks sixth from the bottom in the NFL, allowing 365.7 yards per game, and second to last in points allowed (29.3). The Cowboys have also been troubled by slow starts. Dallas has produced the opening score in only three of its 10 games. Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush is expected to make his third consecutive start after throwing for 354 yards, one touchdown and one interception against Houston. ""We've got seven losses. We gotta go,"" McCarthy said. ""Backs against the wall. Gotta fight, claw, scratch. Gotta do everything we can to go win the next game. That's where my mind's at. That's the way we coach and that's the expectation. In terms of good news for Dallas, All-Pro cornerback DaRon Bland (foot) returned to practice and was a full participant on Wednesday.

Nevada plays at a plodding pace (321st nationally in KenPom's adjusted tempo at 17.6 seconds per possession). Meanwhile, Vanderbilt (4-0) plays at a quicker tempo, fueled by a deep rotation that has nine players averaging between 15 and 25.5 minutes. The Commodores have four double-figure scorers: Jason Edwards (17.5 ppg), Devin McGlockton (16.0), Tyler Nickel (12.0) and AJ Hoggard (11.0). McGlockton (10.0 rpg, 3.0 blocks per game) and reserve guard Tyler Tanner (3.0 steals per contest) have excelled on defense for Vanderbilt. The Commodores had a one-turnover game in their opening-night win over Maryland Eastern Shore, registered 18 steals in a win over Cal on Nov. 13 and went 16-for-38 on 3-point attempts in a 94-81 victory over Jackson State on Sunday.

Bears coach Matt Eberflus tried to stay upbeat despite the mounting losses. ""There were a lot of positives to build from,"" he said. ""That's what you have to do."" Bears quarterback Caleb Williams will try to build upon a solid start as he prepares to face the Vikings for the first time in his young career. The rookie completed 23 of 31 passes for 231 yards last week against Green Bay, and he carried the ball nine times for 70 yards. Chicago wide receiver DJ Moore, who had a team-high seven catches for 62 yards last week, said he and his teammates should be able to maintain their positive momentum this week against the Vikings' top-10 defense. ""With all the players we've got, I hope we are able to move the ball on all types of defenses -- from the No. 1 defense in the league down to the 32nd,"" Moore said. ""I hope we can keep it up and hopefully get some wins out of it."" As the Bears look to stop a losing streak, the Vikings will aim to maintain their winning streak. Minnesota is coming off victories against the Indianapolis Colts, Jacksonville Jaguars and Tennessee Titans over the past three weeks. Darnold has posted a 100.0 passer rating in 10 starts this season. He has completed a career-best 67.9 percent of his passes for 2,387 yards, 19 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. The next touchdown pass will mark a career high for Darnold, who sputtered with the New York Jets and Carolina Panthers before serving as the San Francisco 49ers' backup last season. ""I just feel like, you know -- not talking about past experiences at all -- but I think here it's the detail that we've had ever since OTAs, ever since April,"" Darnold said. ""We've been able to lock in our progressions. Just our feet, our eyes, where they're supposed to be. And just being on time with the concepts. ""If you play like that, it makes the quarterback position a little bit easier."" It also helps to have All-Pro wideout Justin Jefferson, who has 59 catches for 912 yards and five touchdowns. The Vikings' top rusher is former Packer Aaron Jones, who has 692 yards and a pair of touchdowns on the ground. The teams split their matchups last season. The Vikings won 19-13 in Chicago on Oct. 15, and the Bears responded with a 12-10 victory in Minneapolis on Nov. 27. Chicago is 4-2 at home this season. Minnesota is 4-1 on the road. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

But Lindy Waters III countered with a 3-pointer and Golden State kept Atlanta at bay the rest of the way. Wiggins shot 12 of 17 from the floor and went 3-of-6 from beyond the arc. He added seven rebounds, four assists and two blocks. Curry, who had eight assists, went 4-for-6 from 3-point range to help the Warriors shoot 14 for 40 from deep. Atlanta went 12-of-46 from beyond the arc. Hield (11), Waters (10) and Jonathan Kuminga (10) also scored in double figures for the Warriors. Draymond Green added nine points, nine assists, seven rebounds and two blocks in the win. Jalen Johnson led a balanced attack with 15 points and added a game-high 14 rebounds for the Hawks, who had lost at Portland on Sunday and won at Sacramento on Monday to begin a four-game trip. Trae Young had 12 points and 11 assists and Zaccharie Risacher also scored 12 points in the loss. Clint Capela and Dyson Daniels had 11 points each and Hunter finished with 10 off the bench for the Hawks. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

The NFC East-leading Eagles (8-2) have won their past six contests, while the Rams (5-5) have won four of their past five to keep pace in a crowded NFC West. Philadelphia enters Week 12 with the league's No. 1 defense, allowing 273.1 yards per game, and the No. 5 offense powered by Jalen Hurts and Saquon Barkley. Hurts has accounted for 23 touchdowns (12 passing, 11 rushing), and Barkley leads the NFL with 1,347 yards from scrimmage. The Eagles are well-rested, as they have been idle since a 26-18 win on Nov. 14 against division rival Washington. Philadelphia held the Commanders to 264 total yards -- the sixth straight game an opponent failed to gain more than 280 vs. the Eagles. Philadelphia is also road-tested. The Eagles are 4-1 in road games, which doesn't include their ""home"" win against Green Bay in Brazil to open the season. Road success is nothing new for the team, as the Eagles are 22-9 away from home in three-plus seasons under coach Nick Sirianni. ""I think the biggest thing out of all that is just having that mental toughness that everyone is going to be against you on the road,"" Sirianni said this week. ""Now, we travel pretty well, and I've been really appreciative of the Eagles fans that show up no matter where we are. But you still feel like the stadium is against you. ""It's just an opportunity for you to unite as a team, lock arms as a team and have that mental toughness, that dawg mentality as far as understanding just play the next play, control what you can control, and unite as a team. Those are two of our big-time core values: connect and toughness. So we take pride in that. Then I just think that speaks volumes of our players and coaches that they handle that."" The Eagles have won all three road games in the series since the Rams returned to Los Angeles in 2016, including a 23-14 victory in Week 5 last season. ""They (Eagles) are red hot,"" Rams coach Sean McVay said this week. ""They have played really well. They are finding their identity. They have great playmakers, coaches, and schemes. So they are checking all the boxes of what really good teams do. So, that is a great challenge. ... ""We have a lot of respect for this group. But you know, these are the moments that you love as a competitor. This is what is the best part of the NFL."" The Rams are 3-2 at home this season, losing by five to the Green Bay Packers in Week 5 and by eight to the Miami Dolphins in Week 10. Los Angeles rebounded from the defeat to the Dolphins with a 28-22 win at New England last weekend. Matthew Stafford threw for 295 yards and four touchdowns, with Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua combining for 13 receptions, 229 yards and three scores. Stafford has a 4-2 record in his career against the Eagles with 12 touchdown passes and one interception. The Eagles announced Wednesday that defensive end Bryce Huff would have wrist surgery and could go on injured reserve. The team also opened the practice window for wide receiver Britain Covey (shoulder). Hurts (ankle) was listed as limited at Wednesday's practice. Wideout DeVonta Smith (hamstring), defensive tackle Milton Williams (foot) and linebacker Jalyx Hunt (ankle) did not participate. For the Rams, starting right tackle Rob Havenstein (ankle) and cornerback Charles Woods (ankle) did not practice on Wednesday. Cornerback Cobie Durant (thigh), defensive tackle Neville Gallimore (neck) and offensive lineman Joe Noteboom (ankle) were limited. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

An average of 17.5 million viewers have tuned in to an NFL game this season, which does not count international games carried by NFL Network or other exclusive broadcasts streamed on ESPN+ and Peacock. The league reported it is the highest average viewership through Week 11 since the 2015 season. The increased ratings come after speculation that viewership might decline during the election season. That's what happened in 2016, when the ratings dipped 8 percent from the previous year, according to Front Office Sports. Viewership also fell across multiple sports leagues during the COVID-impacted 2020 election season. That changed this year, as ratings remained steady around the election window. Late Sunday afternoon games aired on CBS and Fox, along with primetime games shown on Amazon Prime Video, NBC and ESPN, averaged 18.48 million viewers in the two weeks before the Nov. 5 election, according to Nielsen data. That average fell slightly to 18.18 million viewers in the two weeks after Election Day. Week 11 featured the NFL's top-rated game so far this season, with the Buffalo Bills' 30-21 win over Kansas City, the Chiefs' first defeat of the year, drawing 31.2 million viewers. The two-time defending champion Chiefs have now played in four of the five most-watched games this season: --Chiefs vs. Bills, Week 11: 31.2 million viewers --Ravens vs. Chiefs, Week 1: 28 million --Bengals vs. Chiefs, Week 2: 27.9 million --Ravens vs. Cowboys, Week 3: 27.3 million --Chiefs vs. 49ers, Week 7: 27.1 million The NFL also drew its largest Week 11 ""Monday Night Football"" TV audience since 2006, as 17 million viewers tuned in for the Houston Texans' 34-10 win over the Dallas Cowboys. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Sellers, a transfer from Southern California, sank a 3-pointer to give the Cardinal a 63-58 lead with 2:34 to go. He subsequently made four consecutive free throws, and Stanford went up 67-60 with 35 seconds left. After Norfolk State's Sin'Cere McMahon made a 3-pointer with 29 seconds remaining, the Cardinal's Jaylen Blakes made two free throws to help seal the win. Stanford is 5-0 for the first time since starting 7-0 in the 2019-20 season. Blakes made 10 of 12 free-throw attempts and tied his career high with 18 points. Maxime Raynaud led the Cardinal with 20 points and 10 rebounds. Norfolk State (4-2) got 24 points from Brian Moore Jr., 17 from Christian Ings and 10 from Jalen Myers. Stanford scored 14 unanswered points to take a 14-2 lead five minutes into the game and never trailed thereafter. Blakes, a graduate transfer from Duke, scored the first seven points of that run. A 3-pointer by Ryan Agarwal gave Stanford a 30-15 lead, its largest of the game, with 8:25 left in the first half. Stanford went more than seven minutes without making a field goal, which allowed Norfolk State to cut the gap to 35-31 with 1:28 left in the half. The Cardinal missed eight consecutive shots from the field in that stretch. Stanford led 38-33 at halftime behind Raynaud's 12 points and six rebounds. The Cardinal again had a field-goal drought in the first five minutes of the second half, allowing Norfolk State to go on a 9-1 run and take a 42-40 lead with 14:54 left. Sellers snapped Stanford's 0-for-6 start from the field in the second half by making a jumper with 14:32 left. The basket ignited a 9-2 run that enabled the Cardinal to take a 49-44 lead with 8:52 remaining. Moore scored 10 straight points for Norfolk State to help cut the deficit to 60-58 with 2:50 left. Sellers made a 3-pointer on Stanford's ensuing possession. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Four players scored in double figures for USC (4-1), which ended its last game with a lengthy scoring drought and sputtered out of the gate on Wednesday. The Trojans had only four points in the game's first 4:18 but came alive midway through the first half, going on a 7-0 run after trailing 18-16. USC never relinquished the lead, though San Jose State (1-5) remained close throughout the first half. The Spartans' Will McClendon, who finished with 18 points, scored coming out of halftime, to trim the deficit to five points. The Trojans' followed with their 10-0 and led by double digits the rest of the way. The Trojans dished at least 20 assists in each of their first three games before finishing with just 10 in Sunday's 71-66 loss to Cal. Wednesday marked a return to form, as Saint Thomas accounted for nine of the Trojans' to 23 assists on their 32 USC field goals. The Trojans shot 57.1 percent from the floor, including 10-of-22 from 3-point range. San Jose State was at 41.9 percent and 11-of-23 from beyond the arc. Josh Uduje made all five of his 3-point attempts en route to 25 points for the Spartans. But the Spartans made just 15 of 39 shots from inside the 3-point arc to USC's 22 of 34. The Trojans enjoyed a 38-26 edge in points in the paint thanks in part to Matt Knowling. Knowling shot 5-of-6 from the floor and collected 12 points, eight rebounds, five assists and two blocks.

Florida is 1-3-0 in its past four games, including its 6-3 road loss to the Winnipeg Jets on Tuesday. After two straight losses, the Panthers appeared to have things clicking again with their dominant 5-0 shutout of the Jets on Saturday. However, Winnipeg rebounded by scoring the first three goals in the rematch. The Panthers twice pulled within one goal, but they couldn't complete the comeback. ""Every time we felt we were getting closer there, (Winnipeg) just put one in and got the momentum right back,"" Florida forward Matthew Tkachuk said. ""It was an even game for the most part. It's tough to lose that one when you fight back to get close."" The Panthers now face the Blackhawks and their NHL-low 13 points. Chicago is 1-5-0 in its past six games and has lost three straight. The Blackhawks led the visiting Anaheim Ducks 2-1 through 45 minutes on Tuesday, but Chicago's late-game struggles emerged again. The Ducks scored the equalizer and go-ahead goal within a span of 4:28 in the third period. The Blackhawks have been outscored 26-15 in third periods this season. ""(It's) definitely frustrating,"" said Chicago forward Jason Dickinson, who scored twice against Anaheim. ""We've been in a lot of these games. We could easily be coming out of a lot of these with wins. ... At the end of the day, we've got to go out and do it."" Beyond just the late concessions, Dickinson noted that the Blackhawks are getting outscored in general. Chicago is last in the league in goals (44) and average goals per game (2.32). Connor Bedard leads the Blackhawks with 15 points (three goals, 12 assists), though the reigning Calder Trophy winner hasn't scored a goal in his past 10 games. Chicago also took a hit with its announcement Wednesday that top defenseman Seth Jones will miss four weeks after he suffered a right foot injury.  Jones, 30, was placed on injured reserve on Saturday. He may have been hurt while blocking a shot in Chicago's 3-1 loss to Seattle Kraken on Nov. 14, coach Luke Richardson told reporters on Wednesday. Jones -- who has 10 points (two goals, eight assists) in 17 games this season -- leads all Chicago skaters in ice time per game at 25:43.  Sam Reinhart leads the Panthers with 29 points and 14 goals, and is tied for the team lead with 15 assists. He's fourth in the league in points. Seventeen of Reinhart's points (nine goals, eight assists) have come during his current 11-game point streak. A point on Thursday would tie Reinhart for the fifth-longest points streak in Panthers franchise history. Aleksander Barkov has also amassed 17 points (three goals, 14 assists) over a nine-game point streak. Panthers goalie Sergei Bobrovsky followed up his 27-save shutout over the Jets by allowing four goals on 25 shots on Tuesday. Bobrovsky has a modest .895 save percentage and 3.00 goals against average over his past six starts, so Florida could give Bobrovsky a breather by starting backup goalie Spencer Knight against Chicago. Blackhawks goalie Petr Mrazek wasn't available to face Anaheim due to a personal matter, so backup Arvid Soderblom got the start. Soderblom will presumably start again Thursday if Mrazek is still absent, as the Blackhawks likely wouldn't have rookie backup Drew Commesso make his NHL debut against the high-powered Panthers offense. Florida is 12-4-1 in its past 17 games against Chicago, dating back to the 2018-19 season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

But what about when a team is going good? The Arizona Cardinals (6-4), who have a one-game lead over the three other teams in the NFC West, had last week off in preparation for Sunday's divisional showdown at Seattle (5-5). ""When you're in a rhythm, you're playing good football as a team, you don't want to stop,"" Cardinals tight end Trey McBride said. ""We've won three or four in a row now and it's fun. You want to keep this thing going, you don't want to take this break."" For the record, the Cardinals have won four consecutive games, defeating the Los Angeles Chargers 17-15, Chicago Bears 29-9 and New York Jets 31-6 at home, and the Miami Dolphins 28-27 on the road. One of the keys for the Cardinals has been a healthy Kyler Murray. He completed 22 of 24 passes for 266 yards two weeks ago against the Jets and also rushed for two scores. ""He's got that look in his eye, and when he's in that mode, he's unstoppable,"" said McBride, who has a team-high 49 receptions. ""He's playing at a really high level right now. I'm excited for him and I'm excited to continue to grow with him."" Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon called Sunday's game a ""big-time test on the road."" ""Seattle is always loud and the weather is kind of gray,"" Gannon said. The Seahawks are coming off a 20-17 victory against host San Francisco last week as quarterback Geno Smith scrambled for a 13-yard touchdown with 12 seconds remaining. Seattle snapped a two-game skid and won for just the second time in seven games.  ""These are the most important games of your season,"" Smith said. ""I think the way that we came out and we fought, collectively as a unit and as a team, it just spoke to our urgency. I thought the way that we practiced all week, I knew we were going to come out and play well and get the monkey off my back."" Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said his team is treating Arizona's visit ""like a home playoff game for us."" ""Look, we've earned the opportunity to be fighting for the lead in the division going into the home stretch,"" Macdonald said. ""So, that's the way we're treating it. It's very much like a playoff mindset for us at this point. Can't afford to drop games. You want to have the right to play for these really important games in December and January. You've got to be able to execute and put yourself in that situation."" The Cardinals had just one player miss practice time this week, safety Jalen Thompson (ankle). Veteran right tackle Jonah Williams (knee) was activated off injured reserve after being out since the season opener. The Seahawks were without tight ends Noah Fant (groin) and Brady Russell (foot), wide receiver Laviska Shenault Jr. (back), defensive end Leonard Williams (foot) and cornerback Dee Wiliams (ankle) at practice. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

The Texans (7-4) hold a two-game division lead over the Indianapolis Colts despite recently losing three of four games, including blowing a 16-point halftime lead in a loss to the Detroit Lions. But Houston roared to a dominating 34-10 road victory over the Dallas Cowboys on Monday night, perhaps signaling the team is ready to go on a roll. In fact, the Texans visit a Jacksonville Jaguars team in disarray in Week 13 before having a bye week. Just don't mention the word ""playoffs"" anywhere near Texans coach DeMeco Ryans. ""I just want our guys to remain focused, remain locked in on the task at hand each week,"" Ryans told reporters. ""If we do that, we're a really good football team. We can play with anybody. It's just about finishing.""  Quarterback C.J. Stroud passed for 257 yards and was intercepted once against Dallas. Big-play receiver Nico Collins returned from a five-game absence due to a hamstring injury to catch four passes for 54 yards. But the big reason for the trampling of the Cowboys was running back Joe Mixon, who rushed for three touchdowns and had 153 yards from scrimmage. His 109 on the ground represented his fifth 100-yard outing in the past six games. ""When he's on, Joe's a force,"" Ryans said. ""I liked the way we just kept churning it in the run game. And I'm proud of the guys for stepping up to the challenge."" Houston expects to have star Will Anderson Jr. (ankle) after a two-game absence. Anderson, who was limited in Wednesday's practices, shares the team lead of 7.5 sacks with fellow defensive end Danielle Hunter. The Titans (2-8) lack an identity after the offseason departure of franchise icon Derrick Henry, the star running back. Tennessee has lost six games by double digits as it begins back-to-back road games against the Texans and Washington Commanders. Star defensive tackle Jeffery Simmons is putting on a brave face. He liked the effort in last Sunday's 23-13 loss to the Minnesota Vikings. ""The fight this team showed, especially in the second half, is why you want to play this game,"" Simmons said. ""No matter what the record may be, that's why I come to work, and I'm ready to go to war with my guys."" Quarterback Will Levis passed for a season-best 295 yards against the Vikings. One third of them came on one play when Nick Westbrook-Ikhine caught a pass at his own 40-yard line and raced down the right sideline for a 98-yard scoring play. Levis completed just 17 of 31 passes and was intercepted once. He isn't thrilled that Tennessee ranks 28th in the NFL in scoring offense (17 points per game) and 25th in total offense (295.4 yards per game). ""You have to just continue coming to work, knowing that how you approach your job and how you approach your day-to-day are the habits that create winning football,"" Levis said Wednesday. ""And, we just have to know that if we just keep doing those things, then the wins are going to come."" Titans standout cornerback L'Jarius Sneed (quadriceps) will not play on Sunday, according to coach Brian Callahan. He and receiver Calvin Ridley (illness) were among nine Titans to miss Wednesday's practice due to injury or illness. Among the others to sit out were defensive tackle Sebastian Joseph-Day (biceps) and running back Tyjae Spears (concussion). Linebacker Jack Gibbens (ankle) underwent season-ending surgery earlier this week and will be placed on injured reserve. He was injured and subsequently carted off the field during the loss to Minnesota. Houston defensive end Denico Autry (knee/oblique) sat out Wednesday's session. Defensive tackle Foley Fatukasi (foot) and offensive tackle Blake Fisher (concussion) also missed practice. The Texans have won the past three meetings. The teams will meet again in the final week of the regular season at Nashville. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Given Syracuse's struggles to defend and its inability to easily put lesser teams away early in the season, the Orange might need another 38 from Starling on Thursday night when they take on Texas in the Legends Classic in New York. The good news is Starling appears to be capable of doing it any time he walks out on the court. In the team's 3-0 start, the junior guard is averaging a team-high 21.3 points per game and is doing so efficiently, canning 55.6 percent of his shots from the field. Asked why he is playing so well so far, Starling said he is just doing what the Orange need him to do. ""It's a new team so I'm still trying to find my way,"" he said after win over Youngstown State. ""This game is a step forward in the right direction, obviously, in the confidence department. The coaches trusted me with the ball."" While Starling has, well, starred, the Longhorns (3-1) have used a more balanced effort since a season-opening loss to Ohio State. They subsequently routed three straight outmatched foes in Austin, Texas, including an 89-43 blowout of Mississippi Valley State on Saturday. Kansas State transfer Arthur Kaluma and prized freshman Tre Johnson each scored 18 points for Texas, which buried the Delta Devils in the second half, outscoring them 56-20. The Longhorns' offense is averaging 89 points (against 60 for opponents) and shooting 52.9 percent from the field. Texas could enjoy a big night against a Syracuse defense that is 230th in adjusted defensive field-goal percentage, per kenpom.com.

""But what I will say is every game is unique. ... It's a tough place to play. It's not that it's super loud or anything like that.   ""We just haven't been able to get over the hump.""   Patriots quarterback Drake Maye, the No. 3 overall pick in this year's draft, has given Mayo a reason to believe that New England can turn the corner against Miami (4-6). Maye continued to take steps in the right direction by completing 29 of 39 passes for 282 yards, two touchdowns and one interception during a 28-22 loss to the Los Angeles Rams last Sunday.   Dolphins signal-caller Tua Tagovailoa has been impressed with what he has seen from the 22-year-old Maye so far and is eager to go up against him.   ""I respect his game. I respect his game a lot,"" Tagovailoa said. ""He's a rookie, so there's gonna be bumps within his journey. But you see a lot of flashes of things that he can do, not just inside the pocket, outside of the pocket as well.   ""I got a lot of respect for him, and looking forward to competing against him.""   Tagovailoa most recently threw for 288 yards and three scores on 28-for-36 passing Miami's 34-19 win over the Las Vegas Raiders last Sunday. One of his favorite targets was former New England tight end Jonnu Smith, who hauled in six catches for 101 yards and two TDs.   Miami has rattled off back-to-back wins on the heels of a three-game losing streak that began after a 15-10 victory against the Patriots in Week 5.   ""We're looking to go out there and play the plays with what they've presented us over the years,"" Tagovailoa said, referring to the Dolphins' familiarity with New England's game plan. ""If we need to adjust in any way, we'll adjust.""   Cornerback Kendall Fuller (concussion) and offensive tackle Terron Armstead (knee) missed Miami's practice on Wednesday. Six Dolphins were limited, including star wideout Tyreek Hill (wrist) and cornerback Jalen Ramsey (knee).   Defensive end Deatrich Wise (foot), offensive tackle Vederian Lowe (shoulder) and defensive tackle Jaquelin Roy (neck) did not practice for the Patriots on Wednesday. Safety Kyle Dugger was among those limited -- due to an ankle injury -- and defensive end Keion White (knee) also failed to practice in full.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Tampa Bay (4-6) was two games over .500 and challenging for the NFC South lead a month ago before falling in succession against Baltimore (41-31), Atlanta (31-26), Kansas City (30-24 in overtime) and San Francisco (23-20).  The Giants (2-8) have lost five in a row and are also coming off a bye. Quarterback Tommy DeVito will make his first start of the season and seventh of his two-year career after the Giants announced the benching of Daniel Jones this week after an overtime loss to the woeful Panthers.  ""Tommy Cutlets"" has a career passer rating of 89.2, with eight touchdowns and three interceptions. The 2023 undrafted free agent is 3-3 as a starter. ""Those are never easy conversations,"" Giants coach Brian Daboll said. ""[I've] got a lot of respect for all three of those guys. After evaluating a bunch of things and looking at a lot of tape and being around Tommy last year where he created a little bit of a spark for us, that's the reason why we're going with Tommy."" DeVito had been the third-string quarterback but Daboll chose him over backup Drew Lock. Tampa Bay's potent offense figures to heap even more pressure on DeVito and running back Tyrone Tracy, who has 545 yards and three rushing touchdowns as the Giants' only viable option. Rookie Malik Nabers (607 receiving yards, 3 touchdowns) and Darius Slayton (469, 1) could provide inviting targets for DeVito against a Bucs pass defense that has allowed 20 aerial scores this season, which ranks fifth worst in the NFL. The Giants, meanwhile, have excelled in red-zone defense and rank second in sacks (36). Tampa Bay (4-6) is the only team in the NFL to pass for more than 300 yards and rush for 100 more on four different occasions. The Bucs, led by a committee of Bucky Irving (492 yards, four touchdowns), Rachaad White (306; 1) and Sean Tucker (186; 1) have rushed for more than 100 yards seven times. Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield has been an offensive dynamo. Fourth among Bucs rushers with 192 yards and two scores, he's third in the NFL in touchdown passes (24), total touchdowns (26) and fifth in passer rating (103.6). Mayfield could get back a key contributor on Sunday. Wide receiver Mike Evans, who went down with a hamstring injury in Week 7, returned to practice on Wednesday. Evans had 335 yards and six receiving touchdowns before the injury. Slayton was a full participant on Wednesday as he recovers from a concussion. The wide receiver left the Giants' Week 9 loss to the Commanders and wasn't able to gain clearance to travel to the Giants' Week 10 loss in Germany to the Panthers. Bucs cornerback Zyon McCollum, who departed the 49ers loss with a hamstring injury, did not practice on Wednesday. All-Pro left tackle Tristin Wirfs, who sprained an MCL in the loss to the 49ers, worked on the sideline with trainers. Bucs coach Todd Bowles said it is ""going to be close"" for both players to play on Sunday. Giants outside linebacker Kayvon Thibodeaux (wrist) was a limited participant on Wednesday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Heading into their road clash with the Calgary Flames on Thursday, however, the Rangers are happier with their execution of late. ""We were definitely playing not our best hockey, sneaking away with wins, whether it be with goaltending or being able to score a few,"" New York defenseman Adam Fox said, according to Forever Blueshirts. ""Early in the season, there are things you want to clean up ... but the road trip has been good."" The Rangers arrive in Calgary having won three straight games after their 4-3 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on Tuesday. New York boasts a 7-1-0 road record and has reached the midway point of a four-game trip with two victories. Although the clash against Vancouver was tight, the Rangers controlled play for the bulk of it. However, New York surrendered the first goal of the game on the first shot 34 seconds into the contest. ""We played a really good first period, maybe one of our best,"" Rangers coach Peter Laviolette said. ""We could have done a couple things differently that maybe could have helped prevent (the first goal), but to come right back and score, to me, that's important."" Mika Zibanejad scored less than two minutes later to tie the score, and New York never trailed again after Will Cuylle's sixth goal later in the first period. Chris Kreider supplied the tiebreaking and eventual game-winning tally midway through the third period. ""We were recovering pucks really well,"" Cuylle said. ""Whenever we would get a chance, get a shot and the puck would be loose, we'd be on it really quick and that's how you can sustain the pressure."" The Rangers might also receive a boost for the game. Center Filip Chytil, who missed the past two games, could return after it was determined he did not suffer a concussion against the San Jose Sharks on Thursday. The Flames are halfway through a four-game homestand in which they have rattled off successive wins, including their 2-1 shootout victory over the New York Islanders on Tuesday. Calgary has netted points in six of its past seven games (4-1-2) and continues to be one of the league's early-season surprises. The victory over the Islanders was nearly a textbook example of why the Flames are having success despite being in a rebuilding phase. After falling behind early in the second period, Calgary stayed in the game thanks to strong goaltending from Dustin Wolf before mounting a comeback. ""A lot of battling and competing, lot of chipped pucks,"" said Flames forward Justin Kirkland, who scored one of two shootout goals that sealed the victory. ""It wasn't really your clean game as it normally is, but we battled hard right until the end. As long as it took, we were willing to do that and come out of it with two points."" The Flames have been held to three or fewer goals in 13 consecutive games but have scored 26 third-period goals in 19 contests. They have also benefited from strong goaltending, especially from the rookie Wolf. The two-time AHL goaltender of the year delivered several saves to keep his team within striking distance and then held firm until the shootout, during which he was perfect.  Wolf has a 4-0-1 record in his past five outings while allowing eight goals. Calgary has posted a 7-2-1 record with Wolf between the pipes. He has -- at least for now -- secured the net for a team that had rotated goalies early in the campaign. ""The more comfortable you get in this league, the more you believe in yourself, the more success you're going to have,"" defenseman Rasmus Andersson said of Wolf. ""He for sure believes in himself quite a bit. He's been awesome, especially the last seven, eight games."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Joel Embiid, playing in just his fourth game this season, led the 76ers with 35 points and 11 rebounds. Jared McCain added 20 points and Guerschon Yabusele scored 17 for Philadelphia, which lost its fifth straight and for the 10th time in 11 games.

He recovered against the 76ers with his second double-double in three games and added six assists. Philadelphia point guard Tyrese Maxey tallied eight points on 3-of-13 shooting with three assists in his return to the lineup after missing six consecutive games with a strained right hamstring.

Embiid also departed for the locker room at the end of the third quarter, also with a knee injury, but returned midway through the fourth. Memphis led by as many as 19 in the second half but saw its lead dwindle to 115-111 in the closing minute following an Embiid layup. Jackson's two free throws with 16 seconds remaining sealed the win.  The Grizzlies finished 16-of-16 at the line after not attempting a free throw in the first half.

Pascal Siakam scored 16 of his 21 points in the second quarter to keep Indiana afloat before Houston carved out a 62-53 halftime lead. T.J.

Siakam scored 13 of the Pacers' first 17 points of the second period, and his 3-pointer at the 2:25 mark cut Indiana's deficit to 50-48. Eason, who had eight points, five assists and three steals before halftime, hit a 3-pointer and added a second-chance basket to stabilize the Rockets. Myles Turner's dunk with 8:03 left in the third pulled Indiana to within 70-67, but VanVleet and Smith led a charge for the Rockets.

Walman pulled the Sharks within one by netting his second goal of the season with 6:35 remaining in regulation. Walman received a cross-ice pass as he reached the left circle and immediately snapped a shot home. Granlund's assist on the goal was the 400th helper of his career.

""It's always nicer that you get a win (before) you go home because Thursday is going to be a tough game,"" Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch said of the matchup against the Wild. Edmonton enters with a hot goalie and an even hotter penalty kill. The Oilers have not allowed a power-play goal in the past five games, killing 12 straight penalties in that span, and goalie Stuart Skinner is 4-1-1 in his past six starts after making 27 saves in the win against Ottawa. ""It always looks like you defended a lot better when your goalie makes huge saves,"" Knoblauch said. The Oilers claimed right wing Kasperi Kapanen off waivers from the Blues on Tuesday and the 28-year-old could get his first opportunity against Minnesota. Kapanen had just one goal in 10 games with the Blues. He scored a career-high 20 goals with the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2018-19. ""We did our homework, and he'll fit in in our dressing room, be a good teammate. Sometimes, as guys get older, they mature,"" Oilers general manager Stan Bowman said. ""We'll know in the coming weeks, but in the conversation I had with him he is very motivated coming here. He is excited and very determined to make this a success."" The Oilers could be without left wing Zach Hyman, who did not play the third period against Ottawa because of an undisclosed injury. Hyman scored a career-high 54 goals for Edmonton last season, but has scored only three through 20 games this season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

The victory snapped a two-game losing streak for San Antonio, which won despite not having injured star center Victor Wembanyama (bruised right knee) and guard Devin Vassell (sore left knee), both of whom missed their second consecutive game. Both have been ruled out against the Jazz. Keldon Johnson poured in 22 points off the bench and starter Chris Paul had a double-double (14 points, 11 assists) that included a crucial 3-pointer with 1:27 left to lead San Antonio on Tuesday. The Spurs built a 21-point advantage early in the fourth quarter and then outlasted the Thunder's spirited rally in the final minutes. ""We did a good job of weathering their storm and made just enough plays to stay enough ahead to have a little bit of breathing room,"" Spurs interim head coach Mitch Johnson said. Harrison Barnes added 20 points for San Antonio while Julian Champagnie, Zach Collins and Charles Bassey scored 12 apiece. Stephon Castle tallied 10 in the victory. ""We've been playing a lot of close games already,"" Paul said. ""We've had some tough losses and some big leads, and we didn't let go. But the only way you learn how to win these games is to actually do it."" The Jazz conclude a four-game road trip with their meeting against the Spurs on Thursday after a 124-118 loss at the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday. Lauri Markkanen led Utah with 25 points and eight rebounds while Collin Sexton added 19 points and John Collins, Keyonte George and Jordan Clarkson had 18 points each as the Jazz lost their third consecutive game. Utah closed to within seven points, 116-109, on Markkanen's layup with 1:42 to play but ran out of time. Jazz coach Will Hardy continues to keep some of his young, untested players in the game while it's still in the balance, trying to reduce their learning curve in key situations. That's part of the team's grand plan, according to Hardy. ""There's moments where you're sort of rolling the dice of like, ‘OK, I want these guys to feel this moment and to have some recognition, and we're communicating in a game, and can we fix it on the fly?' "" Hardy said. ""The rolling-the-dice part is that we might not fix it on the fly (in this game). But that's where we're at, that's what we're doing."" After their game Thursday, Utah and San Antonio will conclude their season series Tuesday in Salt Lake City in an NBA Cup West Group B game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Trailing 39-29 at halftime, the Dolphins (3-2) stepped up the defensive pressure and the result was a 19-5 run to start the second half. Robert McCray's steal and dunk gave Jacksonville of the Atlantic Sun Conference a 48-44 lead with 13:22 remaining.  The Dolphins completed the comeback with an impressive effort down the stretch that included McCray's clutch basket in the paint with 34 seconds to go. Nwokeji made 7 of 13 shots, including four 3-pointers, and grabbed a game-high nine rebounds. McCray scored 17 points and dished out a game-high eight assists, Donovan Rivers scored 10 of Jacksonville's 32 bench points and Kendall Munson chipped in nine points on 4-of-4 shooting. Mylyjael Poteat had 15 points and eight rebounds for Virginia Tech (3-2), which was looking to bounce back from last Friday's 22-point, neutral-site loss to Penn State. Tobi Lawal contributed 14 points on 6-of-9 shooting. Brandon Rechsteiner (11 points) made three of the Hokies' six triples and Jaydon Young scored nine points. Virginia Tech, which lost for the first time at Cassell Coliseum this season, entered Wednesday tied for 301st place in Division I with 15.0 turnovers per game and Jacksonville landed in a tie for 338th (17.0). The Dolphins narrowly won the turnover battle with 14 while turning the Hokies' 16 miscues into 20 points. Jacksonville also defeated a power conference school on Dec. 20, 2010, posting a 71-68 overtime win against the Florida Gators of the Southeastern Conference. Wednesday's game -- the first between Virginia Tech and Jacksonville since 1986 -- was part of the upcoming Fort Myers Tip-Off at Suncoast Credit Union Arena in Florida. The tournament features on-campus games between teams from the Beach and Palms divisions before moving play to Fort Myers, Fla. The Dolphins face Mercer in the Palms Division's second semifinal at 1:30 p.m. on Monday. The Hokies take on Michigan later the same day (6 p.m.) in the Beach Division's first semifinal. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Five other players scored in double figures for the Nittany Lions (5-0): Zach Hicks (17 points), Yanic Konan Niederhauser (16 points, 10 rebounds, five blocks), Nick Kern Jr. (13 points), Freddie Dilione V (11 points) and Puff Johnson (11 points). Penn State shot well from the field (55.7 percent) and the 3-point arc (11 of 25, 44 percent), while its second-half numbers (71.9 percent shooting, 9 of 14 from 3-point range) were even more impressive. Purdue Fort Wayne (3-2) was led by Jalen Jackson's 31 points and Corey Hadnot II's 20 points. Eric Mulder chipped in 12 points and 11 rebounds for the Mastodons. With under 10 minutes remaining, Penn State led just 74-69 before Baldwin's layup kickstarted a 12-0 run. Hicks connected on two 3-pointers during the burst, including a triple that made it 86-69 with 6:57 to play. Purdue Fort Wayne got within 94-85 with 1:27 to go, but Konan Niederhauser threw down a dunk on the next possession, and the hosts cruised to the finish line. The score was close throughout the first half until the Mastodons began to create some separation late in the session. Jackson's 3-pointer with 3:10 left before halftime put Purdue Fort Wayne ahead 39-33, and then he dunked about a minute later to make it 43-35. With 1:27 to go before the break, Quinton Morton-Robertson knocked down a 3-pointer to push the Mastodons' lead to double digits (47-36) for the first time. However, the hosts scored the final five points of the half -- including a 3-pointer by Hicks -- to get within 47-41 at intermission. Baldwin came out firing in the second half, drilling three 3-pointers (one of which became a four-point play) in the first two minutes, turning the six-point halftime deficit into a 51-47 advantage. With under 15 minutes left in the contest, Jackson made three straight bucks to put Purdue Fort Wayne up by a point. However, Baldwin and D'Marco Dunn each made a 3-pointer during an 8-0 run as Penn State regained a seven-point cushion. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Small also had five rebounds, five assists and four steals for the Mountaineers (3-1), who atoned for a humbling loss Friday at rival Pitt in which they trailed by as many as 31 points. Jonathan Powell provided West Virginia with an instant jolt of offense, scoring all 11 of his points less than 10 minutes into the game. Tucker DeVries contributed 13 points, three steals and three blocks while Amani Hansberry added 10 points and nine rebounds. The sharp-shooting Mountaineers shot 51.8 percent from the floor and made 15 of 31 3-pointers (48.4 percent).

Iona made 23.7 percent of its shots from the floor and 5 of 19 (26.3 percent) from deep in the teams' first-ever meeting. DeVries opened the scoring with a 3-pointer before Powell took over to put the hosts ahead by double digits. Moments after he entered the game, Powell scored on a fastbreak slam after a DeVries steal and then drilled back-to-back 3-pointers to cap a 10-0 that gave West Virginia a 21-7 lead less than seven minutes into the game.

Both left-handers won the pitching Triple Crown, with Sale leading the National League in wins, strikeouts and earned-run average, and Skubal -- who was voted for the award unanimously -- repeating the feat in the American League. It is the first Cy Young Award for each. Sale took the honors over fellow National League finalists Zack Wheeler of the Philadelphia Phillies and Pittsburgh Pirates rookie Paul Skenes. Sale received 26 first-place votes and four for second for 198 total points in voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America.  ""This wasn't an easy way to get to winning this trophy for the first time,"" Sale said, per MLB.com. ""As soon as it happened, I'm thinking about people and teammates and coaches and family. It's special to me because of all the hard work that other people put in to get me here."" Wheeler was second with 130 points (four firsts, 25 seconds, one fourth) and Skenes, the NL Rookie of the Year, was third with 53 (one second, 13 thirds, three fourths). Dylan Cease of the Padres (45), Shota Imanaga of the Cubs (38) were also among the top five vote-getters. Sale's teammate, right-hander Reynaldo Lopez, was one of three NL pitchers who received a single fifth-place vote. Skubal, with all 30 first-place votes for 210 points, bested American League finalists Seth Lugo of the Kansas City Royals (93) and Cleveland Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase (66).  ""It's special,"" Skubal said. ""All the hard work, all the stuff that goes on behind the scenes, moments like this make it extremely worth it."" The Royals' Cole Ragans (48), the Orioles' Corbin Burnes (47), the Mariners' Logan Gilbert (25), the Astros' Framber Valdez (17), the Rangers' Kirby Yates (two), the Astros' Yusei Kikuchi (one) and the Guardians' Cade Smith (one) rounded out the voting. Sale, 35, had been in the Cy Young conversation multiple times, the runner-up in 2017 and finishing in the top six in voting for seven consecutive seasons from 2012-18. The award is the crowning achievement in the comeback for Sale, who missed all of the 2020 season following Tommy John surgery and was limited to just 11 combined starts in 2021 and 2022 due to injury. After a 6-5 season with a 4.30 ERA with the Boston Red Sox in 2023, he was traded to the Braves last Dec. 30 along with cash for infielder Vaughn Grissom. In his first season in Atlanta, Sale finished 18-3 with a 2.38 ERA. Over 29 starts and 177 2/3 innings, he struck out 225 batters and walked 39, giving up just nine home runs. He was named the NL Comeback Player of the Year last week. ""My goal at the beginning of this year was just to be healthy,"" Sale said. ""Getting greedy and thinking of things like this would have been maybe a little over my skis. I was coming to a new team that made a trade for me, when I'm sure there were a lot of people that kind of gave that trade the side-eye when it first happened. ... To say I'd be sitting here right now would be crazy. I just wanted to be able to do my job, really."" Sale's season ended in disappointment, however, as a back ailment kept him from pitching in the postseason. In his career with the Chicago White Sox (2010-16), Red Sox (2017-23) and Braves, Sale has a 138-83 record with a 3.04 ERA and 2,414 strikeouts over 372 appearances (292 starts). As for Skubal, he won the award on his 28th birthday. A ninth-round draft pick by the Tigers in 2018, he made his debut in 2020. In 31 starts this season, he finished 18-4 with a 2.39 ERA, striking out 228 and walking 35 over 192 innings. Skubal was 6-2 with a 1.85 ERA over his last eight starts as Detroit surged from eight games below .500 in mid-August into the playoffs for the first time since 2014.  He beat the Astros in Game 1 of the AL wild-card series and finished the postseason 1-1 with a 2.37 ERA in three starts. ""It was a ton of fun to be part of,"" Skubal said. ""The last two months of our season and even the postseason was very special. The memories and the experience will obviously help our club going forward, and I'm glad we got to experience it as a team and as a young team."" Over 106 career regular-season appearances (103 starts), Skubal is 41-31 with a 3.37 ERA. He has 648 strikeouts in 571 1/3 innings. Sale became the first Atlanta pitcher to win the award since Tom Glavine won for the second time in 1998, which capped a dominant decade by Braves pitchers when Glavine, Greg Maddux and John Smoltz combined for six Cy Youngs in eight seasons. Skubal is the third Tigers pitcher in the 2000s to take home the prize, following Justin Verlander (2011) and Max Scherzer (2013). This season was the fourth in major league history that both leagues had a Triple Crown winner in the same year. The last time that happened was 2011, when Verlander of the Tigers and Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers accomplished the feat. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

After ending a seven-game skid with a 130-119 victory over the visiting Indiana Pacers, Toronto hopes to further climb out of its early-season slump when it hosts the Minnesota Timberwolves on Thursday. ""I don't know if you guys heard the celebration in the locker room, obviously it was a little bit of a relief factor with it,"" said Raptors center Jakob Poeltl, who had 30 points and 15 rebounds against the Pacers. ""And it's obviously great to get that winning feeling back."" RJ Barrett had a season-best 39 points for the Raptors, who are 3-4 at home. Minnesota is 3-4 on the road.  Toronto can avenge a 112-101 road loss to the Timberwolves on Oct. 26 in Thursday's rematch.  The Timberwolves won for the second game in a row with a 120-117 home victory over the Phoenix Suns on Sunday, with Julius Randle hitting a game-ending 3-pointer. Randle had 35 points and Anthony Edwards added 24. The Timberwolves trailed for most of the game and were down by as many as 16 points. ""That's what I'm most proud of, really. Guys found a way to hang in there,"" Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. ""It's a little bit of a microcosm of our season so far. We have just got to find a way to keep battling and eking out some results until we can catch the rhythm that we know is there."" Part of the solution for Minnesota would be steadier defensive play. ""Well, I would hope defensive consistency, for sure,"" Finch said. ""A little smarter play. We have opportunities to take control of the game, seize the game, capitalize. We just have a few too many ill-advised turnovers, still. Our turnover numbers are down, but we had some unfortunately-timed ones (Sunday)."" Minnesota allowed Phoenix to shoot 54.1 percent (46-for-85) from the field and trailed by 10 at halftime. ""We didn't fold,"" said Minnesota center Rudy Gobert, who had 11 points, 10 rebounds and four blocked shots on Sunday. ""So for me, that's what matters is that our mindset is still always going, always competing, always resilient. Then we get better, figure it out. We have guys that want to win. We have a lot of talent in this room, and I think we'll keep re-finding our identity defensively, and once we do that, everything else is going to click."" In the win over Indiana, Toronto trailed once by one point and led by as many as 22 points. The Raptors shot 58.5 percent (48-for-82) from the field, including 48.3 percent (14-for-29) from 3-point range. Poeltl has averaged 30 points and 15 rebounds over the past three games, shooting 71.9 percent (41-for-57) from the field. ""I think what we're doing really well is finding him,"" Raptors coach Darko Rajakovic said. ""(Poeltl is) playing really well in pick-and-rolls. He's getting better in reading when the defense is going over and under and finding his pocket pass. And he's been, as you can see, playing with more force, going downhill and trying to dunk some of those situations.  ""That's a testament to his work,"" Rajakovic continued. ""That's a testament to everything that he did over the course of the summer, and if he continues like this, we're going to have another All-Star player."" Toronto forward Scottie Barnes (right orbital fracture) returned to full practice on Wednesday and is questionable for Thursday's game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Our golf experts preview the field and provide their favorite prop picks along with best bets to win this week. THE RSM CLASSIC Location: St. Simons Island, Ga., Nov. 21-24 Course: Sea Island Golf Club (Seaside: Par 70, 7,005 Yards; Plantation: Par 72, 7,060 Yards) Purse: $7.6M (Winner: $1.368M) Defending Champion: Ludvig Aberg FedEx Cup Champion: Scottie Scheffler HOW TO FOLLOW TV: Thursday-Friday: 12-3 p.m.; Saturday-Sunday, 1-4 p.m. (Golf Channel) Streaming (ESPN+): Thursday-Friday: 8 a.m.-4 p.m. ET X: @TheRSMClassic PROP PICKS --Chris Kirk to Beat Matt Kuchar (-115 at DraftKings): Kuchar, 46, has been among the veterans grinding as he tees it up for the sixth time during the fall swing. He posted three top-15s against a missed cut through the first four before going T37 in Japan and T30 in Mexico. Kirk, ranked 44th in the world, has been taking it far easier closer to home in Georgia and is a former Sea Island resident. Kirk, who posted a T35 in Utah in his long fall start so far, has played in this event every year since its inception. --Austin Eckroat Top 30 (+105 at BetRivers): Eckroat won his most recent start in Mexico two weeks ago and said it proved his maiden tour win at the Cognizant Classic in March wasn't a fluke. We agree. Eckroat reached the second round of the FedEx Cup playoffs on the strength of a strong season, and riding a wave of confidence he should be in contention against a fall field. --Callum Tarren Top English Finisher (+550): OK, we're closing out 2024 with a longshot selection. The big-hitting Tarren rebounded from a trio of missed cuts with a T37 last week. Granted, he has also missed seven of his past nine cuts overall. Matt Wallace is understandably the -150 favorite in this prop as the 65th-ranked player in the world comes off a T11 at the DP World Championship. We're banking on some jet lag as Wallace crossed the ocean to play his third consecutive week. Also in this prop are David Skinns (+400) and Ben Taylor (+650). Skinns has made four consecutive cuts during the PGA Tour fall swing, while Taylor has missed four of six cuts this fall. 2024 Prop Picks Record: 53-60 BEST BETS --Aberg (+900 at DraftKings) is making his first start since finishing 16th at the Tour Championship as he defends his lone tour win to date following knee surgery earlier this fall.

That said, Washington was dealt a severe blow after superstar captain Alex Ovechkin sustained a lower-leg injury following a collision during the third period of Monday's 6-2 victory over the Utah Hockey Club. The Capitals labeled Ovechkin as week-to-week on Tuesday and placed him on injured reserve Wednesday. They recalled forward Ivan Miroshnichenko from the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League in a corresponding move. The loss of Ovechkin obviously is a substantial one. The three-time Hart Trophy recipient has scored 13 goals in his last 11 games to boost his career total to 868, which is just 27 removed from breaking Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky's all-time record of 894 set from 1978-99.

Lindgren made 17 saves against the Avalanche to snap a modest two-game skid. He also handed Colorado its lone loss in its last five games. The Avalanche rebounded from the setback to the Capitals and opened a four-game road trip on Monday with a 3-2 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers. Defenseman Cale Makar scored two goals to boost his point total to 27 (eight goals, 19 assists) in 19 games. ""I felt like we were offensively rolling,"" Makar said. ""When the forwards are moving around, it's fun for us as (defensemen). We can kind of move up top and create space. So yeah, I thought we were working out well."" The former Calder, Norris and Smythe Trophy winner could have capped his performance with a hat trick, but his apparent tally was disallowed due to netminder interference. ""He got two, I'm not sure about the third one that was disallowed,"" Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. ""He got into some good areas on some nice plays from some other players on our team, (Nathan MacKinnon) fed across on the one right into the slot.  ""Just picked the right spots, I felt like (on Monday), to get up in the rush and join, especially on the entries into the (offensive) zone. In the (offensive) zone play, he was pretty active. He found himself in the slot two or three times, all alone, and he didn't make any mistakes on those."" Casey Mittelstadt scored and set up a goal and Mikko Rantanen added two assists to lift his point total to 10 (six goals, four assists) in his past five games. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

The Lions head into Indiana on Sunday with an eight-game winning streak, their longest since their first season in Detroit in 1934. They carved up Jacksonville 52-6, while scoring touchdowns on their first seven possessions last week. ""They're tough on all three phases, and it shows,"" Steichen said. ""It definitely shows. All those guys are flying around, making plays. They're having fun doing it."" Led by Jared Goff, Detroit (9-1) leads the NFL in points scored (33.6 per game) and point differential (plus-159) this season. Goff bounced back from a five-interception outing in Houston by throwing for 412 yards and four touchdowns against the hapless Jaguars. Top target Amon-Ra St. Brown caught 11 passes for a season-high 161 yards and two touchdowns. St. Brown has a receiving touchdown in eight straight games. And the running back duo of David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs has combined to rush for almost 1,400 yards and 18 touchdowns. The powerful Montgomery has found the end zone 10 times, including twice against Jacksonville. ""He's a throwback. There are throwback principles about him, and I mean that with all due respect,"" head coach Dan Campbell said. ""His running style is -- it's rare. David is just different, and he's downhill, doesn't give up, first guy, he's not going to let him tackle him, continues to churn his legs, and just violent, violent, never give up, never going down."" The lightning-quick Gibbs is averaging 6.0 yards per carry and has eight rushing touchdowns. His one reception last week went for 54 yards.   ""To me, they're the perfect combination,"" Campbell said.   Indianapolis is scoring just 21.5 points per game and has reached the 30-point mark only one time, in a 37-34 loss at Jacksonville. The Colts rallied to beat the New York Jets last week in the return of super-sized quarterback Anthony Richardson. But Detroit isn't just any opponent. The Lions established a new franchise record for points in a six-game stretch last week with 232. ""Their offense is super-powered, so we're going to have to do our part, and we're excited for it,"" receiver Michael Pittman said. The Colts (5-6) reinstated Richardson in the lineup and snapped a three-game losing streak. In the 28-27 victory, Richardson passed for one touchdown and ran for two more, including the go-ahead score with 46 seconds left. ""Very encouraged,"" Steichen said of Richardson's outing. ""I think when you go through a three-game stretch like we had and you go on the road and get a win, and winning in the two-minute drive, you get some momentum -- the confidence. Obviously, coming back at home, we've got to continue that momentum and carry that confidence into this week. We're looking forward to it."" Richardson wasn't picked off in 30 attempts, though he fumbled twice and the Jets recovered one of them. He has fumbled eight times this season and lost three of them. They'll be facing a much tougher opponent this week, though one of the Lions' top defenders, linebacker Alex Anzalone, sustained a broken forearm on Sunday and was placed on injured reserve. ""Just seeing the toughness from our team. We're definitely trying to carry that over because we know we're getting ready to play a physical team,"" Richardson said. ""So, they're going to bring it to us. We got to bring it to them. But just trusting my guys each and every play, like I did in that fourth quarter, and just trust in my ability. I feel like I'm a decent football player, and I like to make plays out there."" Detroit tight end Sam LaPorta missed Sunday's game with a shoulder injury but could return this week. He was listed as a full participant in Wednesday's walk-through.  The Colts listed only offensive tackle Bernhard Raimann (knee) as a non-participant in their walk-through on Wednesday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Both left-handers won the pitching Triple Crown, with Sale leading the National League in wins, strikeouts and earned-run average, and Skubal -- who was voted for the award unanimously -- repeating the feat in the American League. It is the first Cy Young Award for each. Sale took the honors over fellow National League finalists Zack Wheeler of the Philadelphia Phillies and Pittsburgh Pirates rookie Paul Skenes. Sale received 26 first-place votes and four for second for 198 total points in voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Wheeler was second with 130 points (four firsts, 25 seconds, one fourth) and Skenes, the NL Rookie of the Year, was third with 53 (one second, 13 thirds, three fourths). Dylan Cease of the Padres (45), Shota Imanaga of the Cubs (38) and Logan Webb of the Giants (18) rounded out the voting. Skubal, with all 30 first-place votes for 210 points, bested American League finalists Seth Lugo of the Kansas City Royals (93) and Cleveland Guardians closer Emmanual Clase (66). The Royals' Cole Ragans (48), the Orioles' Corbin Burnes (47), the Mariners' Logan Gilbert (25), the Astros' Framber Valdez (17), the Rangers' Kirby Yates (two), the Astros' Yusei Kikuchi (one) and the Guardians' Cade Smith (one) rounded out the voting. Sale, 35, had been in the Cy Young conversation multiple times, the runner-up in 2017 and finishing in the top six in voting for seven consecutive seasons from 2012-18. The award is the crowning achievement in the comeback for Sale, who missed all of the 2020 season following Tommy John surgery and was limited to just 11 combined starts in 2021 and 2022 due to injury. After a 6-5 season with a 4.30 ERA with the Boston Red Sox in 2023, he was traded to the Braves last Dec. 30 along with cash for infielder Vaughn Grissom. In his first season in Atlanta, Sale finished 18-3 with a 2.38 ERA. Over 29 starts and 177 2/3 innings, he struck out 225 batters and walked 39, giving up just nine home runs. He was named the NL Comeback Player of the Year last week. Sale's season ended in disappointment, however, as a back ailment kept him from pitching in the postseason. In his career with the Chicago White Sox (2010-16), Red Sox (2017-23) and Braves, Sale has a 138-83 record with a 3.04 ERA and 2,414 strikeouts over 372 appearances (292 starts). As for Skubal, he won the award on his 28th birthday. A ninth-round draft pick by the Tigers in 2018, he made his debut in 2020. In 31 starts this season, he finished 18-4 with a 2.39 ERA, striking out 228 and walking 35 over 192 innings. In the postseason, he was 1-1 (2.37 ERA) in three starts. Over 106 career regular-season appearances (103 starts), Skubal is 41-31 with a 3.37 ERA. He has 648 strikeouts in 571 1/3 innings. Sale became the first Atlanta pitcher to win the award since Tom Glavine won for the second time in 1998, which capped a dominant decade by Braves pitchers when Glavine, Greg Maddux and John Smoltz combined for six Cy Youngs in eight seasons. Skubal is the third Tigers pitcher in the 2000s to take home the prize, following Justin Verlander (2011) and Max Scherzer (2013). This season was the fourth in MLB history that both leagues had a Triple Crown winner in the same year. The last time that happened was 2011, with Verlander of the Tigers and Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Paolini's 6-2, 6-1 triumph in 66 minutes over Sramkova came after Lucia Bronzetti dispatched Viktoria Hruncakova 6-2, 6-4 in one hour and 23 minutes. The Italians redeemed themselves after falling to Canada in last year's final. Bronzetti quickly pulled away from Hruncakova after three competitive games in the first set. She converted 6 of 9 break points overall and committed eight fewer unforced errors (26-18) than Hruncakova to set it up for Paolini, who had little trouble finishing off the underdog Slovakians. The World No. 4 won 71 percent of her first serve points (22 of 31) and faced just two break points, saving one of them. Sramkova's 28 unforced errors proved too much to overcome as Paolini atoned for her loss to Canada's Leylah Fernandez 12 months ago and clinched Italy's fifth Billie Jean King Cup title and first since 2013. Sara Errani, 37, was a member of both championship teams. Slovakia last won the title in 2002. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

Meanwhile, it's been nearly a month since the Columbus Blue Jackets won back-to-back games.  After losing four straight, the Lightning will aim to notch their fourth straight win when they visit the Blue Jackets on Thursday. Tampa Bay opened November on an 0-3-1 slide, but has since outscored opponents 11-3 during its current three-game winning streak.  On Tuesday at Pittsburgh, the Lightning trailed 2-0 after two periods, but Brayden Point scored twice, including 3:58 into overtime, for a 3-2 Tampa Bay victory that snapped its three-game road skid.  ""I think it just shows what we need to be successful,"" said Point, who returned Tuesday after missing four games with a lower-body injury. ""I think that third period is how we're going to have to win games ... Just good defending and working our chances.""  Anthony Cirelli also scored for a third consecutive game and Andrei Vasilevskiy stopped 17 of 19 shots faced. Vasilevskiy has stymied 99 of 103 attempts over his last four starts (3-0-1). Meanwhile, Point has 10 goals with 15 points in the 13 games he's played this season.  ""He's got an engine, that kid. He's got a nose for the net,"" Lightning coach Jon Cooper said. ""We're obviously a much better team when Point is in the lineup.""   Tampa Bay has won 10 of the last 12 meetings with Columbus, with Point scoring three times in the last five contests between the teams.  Vasilevskiy has a 2.37 goals-against average and .914 save percentage during his eight-game starting winning streak against the Blue Jackets. However, Lightning backup Jonas Johansson has allowed five goals in each of his two starts versus Columbus.  Like Tampa Bay, the Blue Jackets opened November in rough fashion, going 0-5-1 before winning two of the last three. Elvis Merzlikins made 28 saves and five different players scored during Columbus' 5-1 win at Boston on Monday -- which paved the way for the Bruins to fire coach Jim Montgomery.  The Blue Jackets have won two straight games only once this season (Oct. 28 and 30), though there seemed plenty to build on from Monday's win.  ""We can now reinforce a lot of stuff that we did in (Monday's) game,"" Columbus coach Dean Evason said. ""But, it has to be consistent. Hopefully, that propels us forward to do the right things.""  Merzlikins has stopped 49 of 52 shots to win his last two starts after posting a 3.99 goals-against average while going 0-3-1 in the previous four. He has a 2.21 GAA and .929 save percentage while going 3-1-1 as starter at home against the Lightning during his career.   Meanwhile, the Blue Jackets' Daniil Tarasov has a 4.78 GAA during his current 0-3-1 starting rut this season.  Columbus' Kirill Marchenko has a team-leading 16 points but produced just one in the last four games. However, the Blue Jackets' young star owns five goals with one assist in five career games versus Tampa Bay.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-21

All five Knicks starters scored in double figures. Josh Hart had 19 points, 11 rebounds and six assists. Devin Booker scored 33 points on 12-for-23 shooting and Jusuf Nurkic had 14 points and 12 rebounds for the injury-depleted Suns, who have lost five straight. New York never trailed, hitting its first eight shots, including four 3-pointers. The Knicks carried that momentum to a 44-28 advantage after one quarter and a 76-58 lead at halftime. Brunson had 23 points before the break on 8-for-9 shooting, including hitting all four 3s. The Suns cut the deficit to 88-77 midway through the third quarter, but the Knicks responded with an 11-2 run. Phoenix star Kevin Durant missed his seventh straight game with a left calf strain. Teammate and three-time All-Star Bradley Beal was out for the fifth straight game, also because of a strained left calf. Knicks: New York's starting to look like the team many envisioned when they traded for Towns — a four-time All-Star — before the season. The starting lineup is deep with scoring options and makes it tough for the opposing defense. Suns: It's been a tough slog of late for Phoenix and the struggles can't totally be blamed on injuries. They came out flat against the Knicks, particularly on defense, giving up easy transition buckets and good looks from 3-point range.  Brunson splashed home a 3-pointer on the first possession of the game — a harbinger of things to come. The Knicks shot 18 for 23 (78.3%) in the first quarter, including 8 for 11 (72.7%) from 3-point range. Knicks travel to Utah on Saturday, and Suns host the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21

Purdy only threw a few passes Wednesday and Thursday during the portion of practice open to the media after hurting his right shoulder in last week's loss to the Seattle Seahawks. The 49ers postponed Purdy's usual news conference until Friday as the team is still determining whether he will be able to play against the Packers. “He was still limited today, he didn’t do as much yesterday but did a little bit more today,” coach Kyle Shanahan said Thursday in his weekly interview with the team’s flagship radio station, KNBR. “He went out there and did a little bit then went back in about halfway through and rested up. Hopefully it will be feeling great on Sunday.” Purdy has not missed a start because of an injury since taking over as the 49ers' quarterback in December 2001. If he can't go on Sunday, that would deliver a major blow to his team's playoff hopes. The Niners (5-5) are currently in a three-way tie for second in the NFC West, a game behind first-place Arizona, and have little margin for error if they want to get back to the playoffs after making it to the Super Bowl last season. Purdy has completed 66% of his passes this season for 2,613 yards, 13 TDs, eight interceptions and a 95.9 passer rating that is down significantly from his league-leading mark of 113 in 2023. Purdy isn't the only key player for San Francisco dealing with an injury this week. All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams didn't practice for a second straight day because of an ankle injury. Williams missed practice all of last week with the ankle injury but played against Seattle. Star defensive end Nick Bosa left in the second half against the Seahawks after injuring his left hip and oblique and hasn't practiced this week. Bosa had previously been dealing with injuries to his right hip and oblique. Shanahan has said that both Williams and Bosa won't need to practice this week in order to play on Sunday. Running back Christian McCaffrey, still dealing with Achilles tendinitis, returned to practice Thursday after resting Wednesday. Tight end George Kittle practiced for a second straight day and says he will play this week after missing the Seattle game with a hamstring injury. Receiver Jacob Cowing didn't practice a day after being limited because he was in the concussion protocol. The team will issue its injury report for the game on Friday.  ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21

The Los Angeles Dodgers star added his third Most Valuable Player award to his collection and first in the National League when he was chosen unanimously by the Baseball Writers' Association of America on Thursday. Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees won the American League award for the second time, also unanimously. Ohtani last year became the first two-time unanimous MVP. He won the AL award in 2021 and 2023 as a two-way star for the Los Angeles Angels and finished second to Judge in 2022 voting.  He didn’t pitch in 2024 following elbow surgery and signed a record $700 million, 10-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers last December. Ohtani became the first player to reach 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in a season, then helped the Dodgers beat the Yankees in the World Series. “The fact that I knew I wasn’t going to be able to pitch this season just made me focus more on my offensive game and fortunately I was able to produce and get this award,” Ohtani said through a translator. Ohtani sat on a red sofa with his wife and dog Decoy as teammate Clayton Kershaw announced the award on the MLB Network. The Nederlanse kooikerhondje immediately jumped away. Ohtani received all 30 first-place votes and 420 points. New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor was second with 263 points and Arizona second baseman Ketel Marte third with 229.  Judge was a unanimous pick for the first time. Kansas City shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. got all 30 second-place votes for 270 points, and Yankees outfielder Juan Soto was third with 21 third-place votes and 229 points. Ohtani hit .310, stole 59 bases and led the NL with 54 homers and 130 RBIs exclusively as a designated hitter, becoming the first player with 50 or more homers and 50 or more stolen bases in a season. A highlight of the season was during the dog days. Ball in mouth, Decoy delivered the ceremonial first pitch to his owner at Dodger Stadium's home plate before an Aug. 28 game against Baltimore. “The most nerve-wracking game that I had, the most nervous I was when we had that Decoy throw out the first pitch,” he said. Ohtani played the final three games of the World Series with a torn labrum in his left shoulder. Still recovering from right elbow surgery in September 2023, Ohtani had another operation on Nov. 5 to repair the shoulder and has been working on range of motion and started Thursday on core and lower body work. “The goal is to be ready for opening day and that includes hitting and pitching,” Ohtani said. “But we are kind of taking our time."" When Ohtani resumes pitching, could he win MVP and the Cy Young Award in the same year? “That would obviously be great, but right now my focus is just to get to get back healthy, come back stronger, get back on the mound and show everybody what I can do,” Ohtani said. Ohtani became the first primary designated hitter and first player who didn't appear defensively for a single inning to win an MVP. His season started with the revelation longtime interpreter and friend, Ippei Mizuhara had stolen nearly $17 million from the star to fund gambling. Ohtani is the 12th player with three or more MVPs, joining Barry Bonds (seven) and Jimmie Foxx, Joe DiMaggio, Stan Musial, Roy Campanella, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Mike Schmidt, Alex Rodriguez, Albert Pujols and Mike Trout (three each). Balloting was conducted before the postseason. “Moving forward, I think now we do have a target on our back,” Ohtani said. “We are going to be expected to maybe even do — possibly even do more.” Judge led the major leagues with 58 homers, 144 RBIs and 133 walks while hitting .322. Witt topped the big leagues with a .332 average, hitting 32 homers with 31 stolen bases and 109 RBIs. Soto batted .288 with 41 homers and 109 RBIs. When Judge won his first MVP award in 2022, he received 28 first-place votes while Ohtani got the other two. Judge had discussed the MVP award with Philadelphia’s Bryce Harper, the NL winner in 2015 and ’21. “I was telling him, `Man, I’m going to try to catch up to you with these MVPs here, man,’” Judge recalled. “He’d say, hopefully, he could stay a couple ahead of me, which I think he’ll do.” When Judge won his first MVP award in 2022, he received 28 first-place votes while Ohtani got the other two. He is the Yankees' 22nd MVP winner, four more than any other team. Judge was hitting .207 with six homers and 18 RBIs through April, then batted .352 with 52 homers and 126 RBIs in 127 games. “March and April were not my friend this year.” Judge said. “Just keep putting in the work and things are going to change. You can’t mope. You can’t feel sorry for yourself. Especially in New York, nobody’s going to feel sorry for you. So you just got to go out there and put up the numbers.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21

His farewell from tennis was as emotional as expected when it came in Malaga on Tuesday, too soon for most. Nadal deliberately set up his swansong on a home court but Spain was eliminated in the Davis Cup quarterfinals and he and they couldn't complete his exalted career with a win. It was also heart-wrenching for his fans across Spain as they saw one of the country’s very best — arguably its greatest sportsperson ever — finally call it quits. “It's clear that Rafa is the best athlete ever in Spain. He is on a different level than everyone else, by far,” Feliciano López, a former tennis player and the tournament director of the Davis Cup Finals, told The Associated Press. “No disrespect to all other Spanish athletes, and we have very good ones, but no one has been able to inspire the fans the same way that Rafa did."" López, who was Nadal’s teammate in the Davis Cup, compared him to the likes of Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan and Muhammad Ali, all athletes who transcended sports. “There is a very small group of athletes who, during their careers, were able to inspire people in a special way, going beyond sports,” López said. “Rafa belongs to this small group. People everywhere in the world will remember Rafa some 40 or 50 years from now.”  Unable to overcome a string of injuries in recent years, the 38-year-old Nadal retired from professional tennis after more than 20 years on tour and 22 Grand Slam titles, two more than Roger Federer and second only to the 24 of Novak Djokovic, the only one of the Big Three still playing. The front pages of Spain’s dailies all talked about Nadal following his farewell match — a 6-4, 6-4 defeat against No. 80 Botic van de Zandschulp of the Netherlands. “It was an honor,” the sports daily AS said. “Thank you, Rafa,” Marca headlined. “Eternal,” Mundo Deportivo said. It's hard to find any other Spanish athlete coming close to Nadal's fame and sporting achievements. Other Spaniards who have earned sporting greatness include five-time major golf champion Seve Ballesteros; five-time Tour de France winner Miguel Induráin, two-time NBA champion Pau Gasol; two-time Formula 1 champion Fernando Alonso; six-time MotoGP champion Marc Márquez; and four-time Dakar Rally winner Carlos Sainz. Spain also has a long list of successful soccer players, including World Cup winners Iker Casillas and Andrés Iniesta, but none with a status like a Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi, who have transcended sports like Nadal. Nadal is also a two-time Olympic champion, and was Spain’s flag-bearer during the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro. He is adored in Spain just as much for his victories as he is for his passion and unwavering dedication, and is seen as an example for society in general for his values and humbleness on and off the courts. “Nadal makes us Spaniards feel proud. He represents the values of passion, camaraderie, solidarity. He will always be the image of sport in Spain,"" said Clara García, a 35-year-old fan who was in Malaga to watch Nadal. “It's not easy knowing that he won't be playing and representing Spain on the courts around the world anymore.” Federer gushed about his friend and longtime foe's retirement in an open letter. “You made Spain proud, you made the whole tennis world proud. You have always been a role model for kids around the world.” Nadal told the crowd in his farewell ceremony after Spain's loss that he always ""strived to be better and achieve my goals from a place of respect, humility, and I valued all the good things that happened to me. “I’ve tried to be a good person, which was what mattered the most to me, and I hope that you have noticed that."" Fellow tennis pros Djokovic and Serena Williams, as well as former soccer stars David Beckham and other athletes praised Nadal. ""Thank you for so many incredible moments and memories as a tennis fan and for everything that you have done to inspire young people around the world,” former England and Real Madrid player Beckham said. “My goodness, you will be missed,” Williams said. Carlos Alcaraz, regarded as Nadal's heir in Spanish tennis — he already has four Grand Slam titles at 21 — said it will be hard to avoid the inevitable pressure that will come along with following in the footsteps of his idol. “I don’t want to think that we have to continue his legacy. I don’t want it to be a frustration if we don’t reach the level that he reached,” Alcaraz said. “If I achieve half of what he achieved, I will be happy. His legacy is going to be eternal.” It wasn't quite clear what the future would hold for Nadal, who is an avid golfer and who has always been linked to Real Madrid. He has said in the past he would probably enjoy being the club's president one day. “My life will change radically,” Nadal said on Wednesday after arriving home in Mallorca, where he also has the Rafa Nadal Academy. “I have to accept this change as something normal, and accept that my life will be different now than it was for the last 30 years or so. I'm excited about it, there is no doubt.” One thing was certain: Nadal will never be too far away from tennis.  “I’ll retire from the sport but I will continue to be available for whatever is needed, and to being a good ambassador, which is what I have tried to do my entire life.” ___ AP Tennis Writer Howard Fendrich contributed. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21
ABC News: Sports,Drama surrounds final 3 races of F1 season as drivers voice displeasure with recent FIA decisions,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/drama-surrounds-final-3-races-f1-season-drivers-116104131,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 14:02:29 -0500",There&rsquo;s three races remaining in the Formula 1 season and Max Verstappen is inching so close to a fourth consecutive world championship he could wrap it up Saturday night at the Las Vegas Grand Prix,"There’s three races remaining in the Formula 1 season and Max Verstappen is inching so close to a fourth consecutive world championship he could wrap it up Saturday night at the Las Vegas Grand Prix LAS VEGAS -- There are three races remaining in the Formula 1 season and Max Verstappen of Red Bull is close to a fourth consecutive world championship, which can wrap up Saturday night at the Las Vegas Grand Prix.  All is not smooth sailing headed into this final month of racing: — There's a new race director following the firing of Niels Wittich that blindsided the Grand Prix Drivers' Association so badly that it created an Instagram account to rebuke the lack of FIA transparency.  “It was a bit of a surprise, I think, for everybody,” said Mercedes driver George Russell, a GPDA director. “It’s a hell of a lot of pressure now onto the new race director (with) just three races left. Often, as drivers, we probably feel like we’re the last to find out this sort of information.” — Greg Maffei, the CEO of Liberty Media, the company that holds the commercial rights to F1, said last week he was stepping down from his position. This followed months of speculation that owner John Malone was displeased with Liberty landing in two different Justice Department investigations, one surrounding F1's refusal to allow Andretti Global into the series and the other over allegations of a Live Nation concert ticket monopoly. The Andretti team is expected to receive F1 approval to join the grid, albeit without Michael Andretti, who has scaled back his role dramatically since the IndyCar season ended in September.  — F1 denied over the weekend that Stefano Domenicali, CEO of Formula One Management, was also on the move amid rumors that the Italian would take over MotoGP if Liberty's purchase of the series is approved.  — Renee Wilm, a longtime Liberty Media employee, CEO of the Las Vegas Grand Prix and potentially Domenicali's successor, told The Associated Press she will fulfill any role Malone tasks her with but has little desire to move from Colorado to London to replace Domenicali. Maffei's newly opened job? Who knows.  Many drivers, particularly seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton, have been at odds with FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem since his election following the 2021 season finale. In the GDPA statement, they reminded the sanctioning body “our members are adults” who don't need lectures and fines on foul language or jewelry bans, and simply want fair and consistent race control.  There's been no response from Ben Sulayem, and won't be this weekend since he does not attend the LVGP. He will be at Qatar and the finale in Abu Dhabi next month.  Hamilton doesn't think all the behind-the-scenes changes will be a fan topic as the season comes to a close. But he noted that consistency from race control is all the drivers have asked for, while throwing his support behind Domenicali and the job Maffei has done in growing F1 since Liberty took over.  “I really hope Stefano is not leaving because he's been so instrumental in changes and progress to this whole thing,” Hamilton said. “And he knows the sport as well as anyone. But all good things do come to an end, and whoever they put into place, I just hope they are like-minded. But sometimes you have to shake the trees.”  That's just what happened with the surprise departure of race director Wittich. Although drivers have been unhappy with race officiating this season and held a private GPDA meeting in Mexico City, Russell said they had no prior warning Wittich was out. The race director is the referee each weekend and Wittich has been in charge since 2022, when Michael Masi was fired following the controversial 2021 season-ending, championship-altering finale at Abu Dhabi. Now the man in charge for the final three races is Rui Marques, the Formula 2 and Formula 3 race director.  Las Vegas, which overcame multiple stumbling blocks in last year's debut before putting on one of the best races of the season, is a difficult place to start. Verstappen can win his fourth title by simply scoring three points more than Lando Norris of McLaren.  “It’s a bit weird with three races to go to do that,” Verstappen said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re positive or negative about certain things. I thought in Brazil there was definitely room for improvement, for example. It’s still a bit weird having to now then deal with a different race director.” Charles Leclerc of Ferrari wondered why the move was made with only three races to go.  “To do it so late in the season, at such a crucial moment of the season, it could have probably been managed in a better way,” he said. The drivers have consistently asked for clearer guidelines in the officiating of races, specifically regarding track limits and racing rules. The drivers have no idea how Marques will officiate, highlighting a disconnect between the competitors and Ben Sulaymen's FIA.   “We just want to be transparent with the FIA and have this dialogue that is happening,” Russell said. “And I think the departure of Niels is also a prime example of not being a part of these conversations.” The GDPA statement made clear the drivers do not think their voice is being heard.  “If we feel we’re being listened to, and some of the changes that we are requesting are implemented, because ultimately we’re only doing it for the benefit of the sport, then maybe our confidence will increase,” Russell said. “But I think there’s a number of drivers who feel a bit fed up with the whole situation. It only seems to be going in the wrong direction.” He also said the relationship between the drivers and the FIA seems fractured.  “Sometimes just hiring and firing is not the solution,” he said. “You need to work together to improve the problem.” Norris, who has battled Verstappen this year with mixed officiating rulings, said “obviously things are not running as smoothly as what we would want.”  Marques has his first driver meeting ahead of Thursday night's two practice sessions and then three weeks to prove to the competitors he is up for the job.  Carlos Sainz Jr., who will leave Ferrari for Williams at the end of the season, hopes the drama doesn't distract from the momentum F1 has built over the last five years.  “I think Formula 1 is in a great moment right now and all these rumors, I think in every team, every job, there's job changes,” he said. “It's not big drama. I'm a big fan of the people you mentioned, they've done an incredible job in Formula 1 and Formula 1 is what it is thanks to these people. But it's just so emotional, especially the Stefano one. The only one that has a real effect is the race director. But I think if he does a good job, it should be transparent and nothing big.” ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21

Items belonging to former Red Sox President and CEO Larry Lucchino, who died in April at the age of 78, will be auctioned starting Saturday with proceeds going to The Lucchino Family Foundation, which funds charities throughout New England. “My brother, Larry, embodied the spirit of generosity,” said Frank Lucchino, a retired judge from Pennsylvania. Items include Lucchino’s Commissioner’s Trophy and ring from the curse-ending 2004 World Series in which the Red Sox had to first beat the New York Yankees for the opportunity to face the St. Louis Cardinals in the series. Two other championship trophies from Lucchino’s tenure, 2007 and 2013, are being auctioned along with another one from 2018. Other items include 2004 and 2007 championship banners that flew at Fenway Park, a couple of stadium seats and a turnstile, and an electric guitar signed by Boston rockers Aerosmith when they played at Fenway in 2010. Lucchino served as Baltimore Orioles president, leading the effort to build Camden Yards, before doing the same thing for the San Diego Padres — building another new ballpark. In Boston, he helped to assemble the new ownership group led by John Henry and Tom Werner that bought the franchise in 2002. The group opted to renovate rather than replace Fenway Park, which opened in 1912, preserving the oldest ballpark in Major League Baseball for future generations. The online auction is being handled by Bonhams Skinner. Included in the auction are non-Red Sox items owned by Lucchino, such as a World Series ring won with the Orioles and a Super Bowl ring from Washington. Robin Starr from Bonhams Skinner said it was an honor for a Boston-based auction house to handle the auction.  ""Larry Lucchino’s lasting impact on the Boston Red Sox and Major League Baseball as a whole is undeniable,” she said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21

ABC News: Sports,It's getting harder to stay on the PGA Tour. Here's why,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/harder-stay-pga-tour-116115451,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:50:28 -0500",The PGA Tour is making sweeping changes to its eligibility and it's only going to get more difficult to keep a tour card,"The PGA Tour is making sweeping changes to its eligibility and it's only going to get more difficult to keep a tour card The PGA Tour is making the most sweeping changes to its eligibility in more than 40 years by eliminating 25 tour cards, along with shrinking the size of its fields. The all-exempt tour had been in place since 1983, meaning the top 125 players from the official money list — now the FedEx Cup standings — kept a full PGA Tour card the following season. That changes in 2026 after the PGA Tour policy board approved a new priority list on Monday. Only the top 100 players will earn full tour cards for the following year. The top 30 from the developmental Korn Ferry Tour used to advance to the PGA Tour. That number now goes to 20. Five players from qualifying school will get cards — it previously was the top five and ties. The tour also is doing away with 156-man fields except for two tournaments held on multiple courses. Most tournaments will have 120 players before Daylight Saving Time, then 132 players in spring and a maximum of 144 players in the summer months. Here's a look at what's behind the changes and what it means: The all-exempt tour led to a bloated membership in which nearly 200 players were on the membership rolls through one exemption or another, and those toward the bottom of the priority list could not get into all the tournaments they wanted to play. Those who graduated from the Korn Ferry Tour, for example, could only get in three or four tournaments over the first few months of the season, giving them a disadvantage. The PGA Tour believes that limited full status to the top 100 instead of the top 125 will give everyone who earns a card a fair chance at getting into regular tournaments. Priority to get into tournaments starts with winners of the majors and The Players Championship over the last five years; winners of the Arnold Palmer Invitational, Memorial and Genesis Invitational the last three years; tournament winners the last two years and career money leaders. Next are the top 125; players who have been given a medical extension; and then the 45 players who earned cards from the Korn Ferry Tour, European tour and Q-school. After that are those who finished from No. 126 to No. 150 in the FedEx Cup. All of them have PGA Tour cards. But there's not room for them in every tournament. The most common refrain in golf is to play better to get better status. Those who perennially finish in the top 100 should have no trouble keeping their cards, and they will have fewer players to beat because the fields will be smaller. It also helps newcomers from the Korn Ferry Tour, European tour and Q-school. They can expect to get into every regular tournament, increasing their odds of getting into some of the $20 million signature events. The PGA Tour, already the strongest circuit in golf, is likely to be even more competitive with a greater chance of the top names in contention. The tour also hopes — this is still to be determined — it will improve the pace of play and keep rounds from spilling over into the next day. Players like Peter Malnati and Taylor Pendrith come to mind. Under the new system, neither would have had a full PGA Tour card this year and likely would not have been in the fields for the tournaments they won — Malnati at the Valspar Championship and Pendrith at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson. Those wins make them exempt through 2026. Players who have not performed consistently well, who seem to struggle each year just to finish in the top 125, will have to be at their best to stay on tour. The PGA Tour also is reducing the four spots from Monday qualifiers at open tournaments. Now there will only two spots for the 132-man fields and none for fields of 120 players. One of golf's charms is how one week can change a career. Then again, there has been only one Monday qualifier to win in the last five years — Corey Conners in the 2019 Texas Open. The new eligibility starts in 2026, so that puts a huge emphasis on playing well this year knowing that only the top 100 will keep full status. The four majors are not run by the PGA Tour. The Masters has the smallest field, typically fewer than 100 players. The U.S. Open, British Open and PGA Championship have 156-man fields. The Players Championship, the premier event run by the PGA Tour, is reducing its field from 144 players to 120. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21
ABC News: Sports,New Hampshire courts hear 2 cases on transgender girls playing girls sports,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/new-hampshire-court-hears-cases-transgender-girls-playing-116102227,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 20:02:14 -0500",Two New Hampshire fathers who were punished for wearing pink wristbands marked &ldquo;XX&rdquo; to represent female chromosomes at a high school soccer game say they didn't set out to harass or otherwise target a transgender athlete,"Two New Hampshire fathers who were punished for wearing pink wristbands marked “XX” to represent female chromosomes at a high school soccer game say they didn't set out to harass or otherwise target a transgender athlete CONCORD, N.H. -- Two New Hampshire fathers who were barred from school district events for wearing pink wristbands marked “XX” to represent female chromosomes insisted at a federal court hearing Thursday that they didn't set out to harass or otherwise target a transgender soccer player at the game they attended. But a judge hearing the case suggested the message the parents sent may matter more than their intentions. Kyle Fellers and Anthony Foote sued the Bow school district after being banned from school grounds for wearing the wristbands at their daughters' soccer game in September. The no-trespass orders have since expired, but a judge is deciding whether the plaintiffs should be allowed to wear the wristbands and carry signs at upcoming school events, including basketball games, swim meets and a music concert, while the case proceeds. Testifying at Thursday's hearing, both men said that they did not view the wristbands as a protest against Parker Tirrell, a transgender girl on the opposing team, but rather as a show of support for their daughters and their teammates. U.S. District Court Judge Steven McAuliffe questioned whether there is a meaningful distinction and whether their intentions matter.  “Sometimes the message you think you’re sending might not be the message that is being sent,” he said.  McAuliffe asked Foote whether it occurred to him that a transgender person might interpret the pink XX wristbands as an attempt to invalidate their existence. “If he’s a trans female, pink might be a color he likes,” Foote said. McAuliffe also noted that while both plaintiffs said they had no problem with transgender people outside the issue of sports, they repeatedly referred to the athlete in question as a boy. “You seem to go out of your way to suggest there’s no such thing as a trans girl,” McAuliffe said. Foote disagreed, saying it was “like learning a new language” to refer to transgender people. In a separate courtroom earlier Thursday, another judge held a hearing on a lawsuit brought by Parker Tirrell and another student challenging the state law that bans transgender athletes in grades 5 to 12 from teams that align with their gender identity. It requires schools to designate all teams as either girls, boys or coed, with eligibility determined based on students’ birth certificates “or other evidence.” U.S. District Court Chief Judge Landya McCafferty ruled earlier this year that the teens can try out for and play on girls school sports teams. The order only applies to those two individuals for now as they seek to overturn the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act on behalf of all transgender girl students in New Hampshire.  Lawyers for the teens said in court Thursday they hoped the matter could go to trial and be resolved before the start of the next school year in September. They said the teens’ school districts and others in the state have asked for guidance regarding the statute. Lawyers for the state said they needed more time to prepare.  Judge Talesha Saint-Marc suggested the timing of the trial was ambitious and asked that both sides talk further about scheduling.  Gov. Chris Sununu, who signed the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act into law in July, has said it “ensures fairness and safety in women’s sports by maintaining integrity and competitive balance in athletic competitions.” About half of states have adopted similar measures. In the Bow case, school district officials have said they acted appropriately in sanctioning the parents for conduct they knew violated school policy at athletic events. They'll explain their evidence on Friday. On Thursday, the plaintiff's lawyer, Endel Kolde, accused the district of “breathtaking” overreach by asserting that the wristbands target transgender students in general, regardless of whether such students were present at the events. “This is viewpoint discrimination, and it’s very clear they’re proud of it,” Kolde said. Kolde initially conceded that a school district can limit speech “to some degree” to protect children from harassment, but he stopped short of agreeing with the judge’s claim that yelling “transgender students out” at a particular player would be subject to such regulation. “It might be,” he said. “I’m trying to get you to concede the obvious,” McAuliffe said. “It’s less than obvious to me,” Kolde said. Feller, the first witness in the case involving the wristbands, said he purchased them thinking his daughter and her teammates would wear them, but ended up wearing one himself after they declined. After being told to leave the game, he stood in the parking lot with a sign that said “Protect women’s sports for female athletes.” “I wanted to support women’s sports and I believed what was going on was a travesty,” he said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21

The first was already a given for the draft-eligible junior who plays both receiver and cornerback. The second is a risk-reward play for a projected high first-round pick who averages around 120 snaps a game. In years past, it took two extra postseason wins to capture a national title. Now, it could take up to four additional contests. That’s more of a chance to shine, but also more chance for an injury. “I don’t think nobody will opt out because you’re showing NFL teams that you’re more focused on something else, other than the team goal,” Hunter said of the expanded 12-team College Football Playoff. “So I don’t think players are going to opt out of the playoffs.”  Hunter and quarterback Shedeur Sanders chatted Thursday in a set of Zoom calls about turning around the program at Colorado (from 4-8 last season to bowl eligibility), chasing a Big 12 title, turning pro — Hunter acknowledged he will “for sure” — and, of course, the Heisman race, where Hunter is currently the odds-on favorite in an award each wants to see the other win. “He’s deserving of it, and if it’s between me and him, I want him to get it,” said Sanders, whose 16th-ranked Buffaloes (8-2, 6-1 Big 12, No. 16 CFP ) travel to Arrowhead Stadium to face Kansas (4-6, 3-4) this weekend. “He does a lot of amazing things that have never been done before.” Countered Hunter: “I know he wants me to win it, but I also want him to win as bad as I want to win it.” Hunter is a generational talent shining on both sides of the ball. As a receiver, he has 74 catches for 911 yards and nine touchdowns. On defense, he has picked off three passes, even though teams are reluctant to throw his direction. Like he did in high school and now in college, he believes he can do both on the next level. But he understands the trepidation of the NFL team that picks him. “They don’t want their top pick to go down too early,"" Hunter said. “I like when people tell me I can’t do it, because they just motivate me to continue to do what I want to do.” Sanders is turning in a stellar season as well with 27 touchdown passes, one away from tying Sefo Liufau for the most in a single season in program history. He's projected to be one of the first QBs off the draft board.  The future certainly looks bright at Colorado thanks to the legacies Sanders and Hunter under coach Deion Sanders. But that's a point to ponder later. “I can’t think too much forward past Saturday,” Shedeur Sanders cracked. “The main thing is winning the Big 12 championship. That’s the main thing we’re focused on."" ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

So, when USA Basketball called his son about this opportunity — games Friday and Monday in Washington, then two more qualifying games in February likely with a different roster — he jumped at the chance. “I'm coaching Team USA, which is amazing,"" Stephen Silas said. ""That's one part of it. And the other part of it is my dad never was on Team USA. He played in the league for 16 years, coached for 30 years and all that. And, unfortunately, he passed away, but I know he would be super proud that I’m coaching this team.” AmeriCup is the championship of the FIBA Americas region, and the U.S. is trying to qualify for the tournament that will be held next year in Nicaragua. The Americans play Puerto Rico on Friday and Bahamas on Monday, then go on the road to face those teams again Feb. 20 and 23. Silas will return for those games, though it's unknown how many players from this roster will be back for that window. There are four groups, all with four teams, and three teams from each group will make it to Nicaragua. The U.S., Puerto Rico, Bahamas and Cuba are all 1-1 through one stage of qualifying. Silas is just happy to be back on a bench. He spent three years as Houston's coach during a rebuild, going 59-177. And he was an assistant in Detroit last season, as the Pistons slogged through a 28-game losing streak on the way to a 14-68 mark. “You learn how tough you are. You learn how much you love basketball, to go through the last four years that I’ve gone through in the NBA,"" Silas said. “I still love to coach and want to coach after all those losses. It really makes me understand how much I love the game and love to coach and to see guys improve. And I’m looking forward to my next opportunity.” Silas has a long relationship with Patrick Ewing, the Hall of Fame player who won two Olympic gold medals for USA Basketball. They worked together as assistant coaches in Charlotte. And when Silas took the USA job, Ewing — the former Georgetown star player and then Georgetown coach, meaning these games in Washington are essentially a homecoming — was his first call. “He’s an amazing coach,"" Silas said. “He played under Pat Riley and John Thompson and Bobby Knight and Jeff Van Gundy, all these people. His basketball knowledge is so deep.” Silas basically hired Ewing for this job without telling USA men's national team director Sean Ford ahead of time. Silas called Ford after the fact and asked if it would be OK to have Ewing on the staff; Ford, as would be expected, had absolutely no issue with the move. Keith Smart, another former NBA head coach and assistant coach who won an NCAA title as a player at Indiana, also is on Silas' staff for these games. There are 12 players on the USA roster for these games and all 12 have NBA experience — some of it extensive. Robert Covington has played 614 games in the league, Tony Snell has played 601, Frank Kaminsky has played 413 and Chasson Randle has appeared in 119. Also with NBA experience: Henry Ellenson, Paul Watson, Jahmi’us Ramsey, Nate Hinton, Malik Williams, Dusty Hannahs, Javonte Smart and David Stockton. Combined, the group has played 1,988 NBA games and scored 15,462 points in the league. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21
ABC News: Sports,Narin An leads with a 64 in the wind as Nelly Korda struggles in LPGA finale,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/narin-leads-64-wind-nelly-korda-struggles-lpga-116115164,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:42:28 -0500",Narin An is the surprise first-round leader at the richest-paying event on the LPGA Tour,"Narin An is the surprise first-round leader at the richest-paying event on the LPGA Tour NAPLES, Fla. -- Narin An handled the windy conditions with a hot putter on Thursday, making four straight birdies around the turn and finishing with an 8-under 64 for a one-shot lead in the CME Group Tour Championship. At stake for the 60-player field is a $4 million prize to the winner, the largest single-day payoff in women's golf. Nelly Korda already has won more than that during her sterling season of seven wins. Now she faces an eight-shot deficit over the next three days at Tiburon Golf Club if she wants to end her year in fitting fashion. Korda, coming off a victory last week, couldn't make amends for her three bogeys and had to settle for an even-par 72. She has come from behind in four of her victories, and still has 54 holes ahead of her. But it has made the task that much tougher. Everything felt easy for An, a 28-year-old from South Korea who has never won on the LPGA and has never cracked the top 10 in any of the 16 majors she has played. “Today my putt really good,” An said. “The speed was good and the shape was good. I just try to focus a little bit more.” She had a one-shot lead over Angel Yin, who shot 30 on the back nine, including an eagle on the par-5 17th hole that most players can easily reach in two. Former U.S. Women's Open champion Allisen Corpuz and Marina Alex were at 66, with Lydia Ko leading the group at 67. Despite the wind so typical along the Gulf Coast of Florida, 27 players — nearly half the field — shot in the 60s. “It's a good head start for the big ol' prize we get at the end of the week,” Yin said. Whoever wins this week is assured of breaking the 17-year-old LPGA record for most money earned in season. The record was set by Lorena Ochoa in 2007 at $4,364,994, back when the total prize money was about half of what it is now. Ochoa earned $1 million for winning the Tour Championship in 2007. The opening round followed a big night of awards for the LPGA Tour, where Korda officially picked up her first award as player of the year, which she clinched earlier this month. Ko was recognized for her big year, highlighted by an Olympic gold medal that put her into the LPGA Hall of Fame. She regained plenty of focus for the opening round on a course where she won just two years ago. “The course isn't easy,” Ko said. “I set a goal of shooting 3 under today, and somebody shot 8 under. I was like, ‘OK, maybe I need to make a few more birdies.’ It's a course that can get away from you as much as you can shoot some low scores, so I’m just trying to stick to my game plan and go from there.” Also in the group at 67 was Albane Valenzuela of Switzerland, already celebrating a big year with her debut in the Solheim Cup and her first appearance in the Tour Championship. She made a late run at her first LPGA title last week at Pelican Golf Club, and kept up her form. And she can see the finish line, which is appealing. “I everyone is looking at that $4 million price tag,” Valenzuela said. “I try not to look too much at the result. I feel like in the past I’ve always been stuck on results, and ultimately all I can do is control my own round, my own energy, my own commitment. “It's the last week of the year. It’s kind of the bonus week. No matter what, everyone is having a paycheck.” ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21

The 76ers said George did not suffer any structural damage when he injured the same knee that he hyperextended during the preseason in Wednesday night's loss at Memphis. The game marked the first time this season the All-Star trio of George, Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey started a game together.  George will miss home games Friday against Brooklyn and Sunday against the Los Angeles Clippers, his former team. A nine-time All-Star, the 34-year-old George will be evaluated again on Monday. Wednesday's 117-111 loss to the Grizzlies dropped the Sixers to 2-12, the worst record in the NBA headed into Thursday night's games. George signed a four-year, $212 million contract with Philadelphia after five seasons with the Clippers. He has averaged 14.9 points in eight games this season. Embiid has been out with injuries, load management rest and a suspension, while Maxey was sidelined with a hamstring injury. An expected contender in the Eastern Conference, the Sixers haven't won since an overtime victory against Charlotte on Nov. 10. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21

The Capitals updated Ovechkin’s status Thursday after he was evaluated by team doctors upon returning from a three-game trip. The 39-year-old broke the leg in a shin-on-shin collision Monday night with Utah's Jack McBain, and some of his closest teammates knew it was not good news even before Ovechkin was listed as week to week and placed on injured reserve. “Everyone’s bummed out,” said winger Tom Wilson, who has played with Ovechkin since 2013. “We were sitting there saying: ‘This is weird. Like, it’s unbelievable that he’s actually hurt.’ It’s one of those things where like, he’s going to miss games? I’ve been around a long time, and it’s new to me.” Ovechkin in his first 19 seasons missed 59 games — and just 35 because of injury. Durability even while throwing his body around with his physical style is a big reason he is on track to pass Gretzky’s mark of 894 goals that once looked unapproachable. “He doesn’t go out there and just coast around,” Wilson said. “He’s played 20 years every shift running over guys and skating. He’s a power forward, the best goal-scorer ever maybe, and he’s a power forward that plays the game really hard.” Ovechkin surged to the top of the league with 15 goals in his first 18 games this season. He was on pace to break the record and score No. 895 sometime in February. “You know when goal-scorers start scoring, it’s dangerous,” said defenseman John Carlson, who has been teammates with Ovechkin since 2009-10. “There was a bit of that in the downs that everyone was feeling about it too, of course. We see him coming to the rink every day, we know what’s at stake. You never want anyone to get injured, but there’s a lot to it and certainly he was playing his best hockey in years.” ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21
ABC News: Sports,President Biden welcomes 2024 NBA champion Boston Celtics to White House,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/president-biden-welcomes-2024-nba-champion-boston-celtics-116115890,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 20:02:22 -0500",President Joe Biden welcomed &ldquo;Coach Joe&rdquo; Mazzulla and the Boston Celtics to the White House to celebrate the franchise&rsquo;s unprecedented 18th NBA championship,"President Joe Biden welcomed “Coach Joe” Mazzulla and the Boston Celtics to the White House to celebrate the franchise’s unprecedented 18th NBA championship WASHINGTON -- The White House was tinted green on Thursday, when President Joe Biden — secret service code name: Celtic — welcomed “Coach Joe” Mazzulla and the Boston Celtics to the South Lawn to celebrate the franchise’s unprecedented 18th NBA championship. In a tradition believed to have begun when Bill Russell’s 1963 Celtics met with President John F. Kennedy, Biden welcomed the NBA’s 2024 champions and gave them a tour of the Oval Office. In all, the league’s most-decorated franchise has won at least one title in eight of the last 13 presidential administrations. “The Celtics aren’t just a basketball team. They’re a way of life,” Biden told the crowd, quoting Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach before receiving a No. 46 jersey from All-Star Jayson Tatum and guard Derrick White. Biden noted that his secret service code name is “Celtic.”  “For real. Because I'm Irish,” the president said. “Everybody behind me is Irish in their heart. I feel a special pride in this trophy. From this old Irish Celtic, to all you Celtics, congratulations.”  Biden, who was once one of the youngest senators in U.S. history and is now the country’s oldest president ever, said he felt a kinship with Mazzulla, who was 35 when he led the Celtics to the title in his second season. “Joe’s the youngest head coach to win a title since the great Bill Russell,” Biden said. “I told him I used to be the youngest and now I’m the oldest. I liked being the youngest better.” The Celtics were greeted with a band playing “Shipping up to Boston,” before Biden and team owner Wyc Grousbeck joined them on the risers facing the Washington Monument; green lights shined from from the eaves of the White House behind them. Among those in attendance were Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and most of the state’s congressional delegation. “I didn’t really know what to expect. I walked in, I was like 'I’m more excited than I thought I was going be,” White told reporters afterward. “To be in the White House, to be where all the decisions — all the cool things — are happening, that was the best part.” Celtics co-owner Steve Pagliuca said Biden's 4-year-old grandson, Beau Jr., tried on his championship ring. (Oshae Brissett, a member of the 2024 team who is not with the Celtics this year, was at the ceremony and received his championship ring on Thursday.)  Biden also received a commemorative basketball, which he passed to Celtics center Al Horford. And then threw back and forth with a member of the crowd.  “I wasn’t expecting a pump fake,” White told reporters. “It’s harder to make a pass in a suit, so I was impressed.” Biden was well-briefed on the Celtics history and their success last year, when they cruised to 64 wins in the regular season – their most since winning the 2008 title, and the fourth-best in franchise history. They went 16-3 in the playoffs, eliminating the Dallas Mavericks in five games. Biden even noted that the ’24 Celtics had the highest ration of points per possession in NBA history – one of the wonkier stats, but one that had team vice president and stats guru Mike Zarren beaming. “The basketball stats community has come a long way: the President of the United States is talking about points per possession!” Zarren posted on X after speaking to reporters at the ceremony. Members of the Celtics organization went back into the White House after the festivities to meet with administration officials on pet issues, including “Raise the Age,” which seeks to have 18- to 20-year-olds treated as juveniles in the criminal justice system, and “Curbside Care,” which provides medical aid to new mothers in underserved communities. “This was a very exciting and moving day,” Grousbeck told reporters in a video call afterwards. “We had not been focused on this. We got through the banner and opening night, and then it was all business. Joe (Mazzulla) doesn’t want us to dwell too much on the past, he wants everyone to focus on moving forward. Having said that, everyone here, including Joe, seemed to have a great time.” Zarren said he spoke to a secret service agent who was a Celtics fan and had to bear with the Golden State Warriors’ visit two years ago. “He told them it was a bittersweet moment because he wished his Celtics were here. And they said to him, ‘Don’t worry, they’ll be here soon,’” Zarren said. “So for him, it was a good moment to see us show up inside there.” ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2024-11-21
NYT > Sports,How Formula 1 Turns America’s Most Famous Road Into a Racetrack,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935914/2024/11/21/f1-vegas-gp-track-the-strip/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 22:17:59 +0000",The circuit in Las Vegas faces a tough challenge to open and close the Strip in merely hours: “It’s a science.”,"Formula 1 LAS VEGAS — Making a street race happen in Formula One is one of the toughest logistical challenges for the organizers of a grand prix. Each year in Monaco, Singapore and Baku, Azerbaijan, months of planning go into action to turn the center of a city into a racetrack for only a handful of days as the bumpy streets and beckoning walls pose a different challenge to the drivers than a normal circuit. Advertisement But for the Las Vegas Grand Prix, that challenge is only multiplied by the fact its circuit, which proved a hit among the drivers last year, incorporates one of the most famous roadways in the world: the Strip. “I was in Singapore with the race and chatting to the promoter, and they were like, ‘We don’t understand how you open and close the track the way you do,'” said Emily Prazer, the chief commercial officer of F1 and the Las Vegas Grand Prix. “They keep the roads closed for seven days. Can you imagine us telling the (Las Vegas) council we’re keeping the roads closed for seven days? It would just literally never happen, ever.” As F1 embarked on its ambitious plan to return to Las Vegas after almost 40 years away (and insisted on having the Strip as part of its 3.8-mile track layout), it needed a plan to keep it open as long as possible before preparing it for F1 action each night. The task of opening and closing the roads that are part of the circuit is overseen by Terry Miller, the general manager of the Las Vegas Grand Prix. The event site he’s responsible for covers 450 acres. “That’s a big area, not to mention the fact that we have more than 45 significant businesses around that track,” Miller told The Athletic. “One of those 45 businesses owns five different resorts. So the ability for us to manage the logistics of our track build is significant.” The circuit installation, including the barriers, fences and lighting, commenced after Labor Day weekend. Miller instructed his team to approach the track build a little differently than in year one: completing a lap in a similar fashion to the drivers. “This year, we were able to be a little more consistent and targeted as to how we were building the track,” he explained. “You have to build all the track lighting before you can put up any track barriers. “We started at one corner of the circuit, and we worked our way around the path (the driver takes) and added all of our track lighting, and then we followed that same pattern with our track barriers, and then we followed with all of our electronics.” As part of the agreement with the local authorities, no track barriers are put along Las Vegas Boulevard until 12 days before the race to try and minimize disruption. “They didn’t want to disturb Las Vegas Boulevard any sooner than necessary,” Miller said. “We did our internal logistics calculations, and we said we could try and get it done in 12 days prior to the race event.” Removing the barriers on the Strip is one of the first tasks after the race so it can be cleared before Thanksgiving four days later. Advertisement Preparing the Strip for the F1 cars to use the track every night is a scientific process, according to Miller, who conducted an extensive analysis of how his track crew last year worked to open and close the circuit. “We’d spent a lot of time with spreadsheets and stopwatches because we got it down to: How much time does it take to move a block? How much equipment, how many crews can you use at one time before they get into each others’ way?” he said. “It was a science last year, and that allowed us going into this year to do a little more ‘lab work’ on the science of how do you put all of this in place.” A team of 140 people works to open and close the track, assigned across 42 locations that open and close each day. There are 3,500 track barrier blocks, stretching out to 7.6 miles in length, twice the lap distance. Under the night sky, the track is illuminated by 1,750 temporary light units. Each of the 140 workers is assigned a duty with a “very specific set of logistics and equipment,” according to Miller. Training for the track opening and closing started in June to cover a team of 180, ensuring alternates are on standby in case any of the 140 drop out. “We don’t just leave it to guesswork,” Miller said. “It’s pretty sophisticated in terms of how we move that 140 group of crew people through that process.” Transforming the track from “open” to “closed” involves three stages. It starts as a “warm track,” remaining mostly open to public use so traffic can pass around the center of Las Vegas. This period ends at midnight Thursday (to allow the safety car to complete its high-speed tests) and lasts until 5 a.m. At 3 p.m., a transition period begins to prepare everything for on-track action before it becomes a “hot track” at 5 p.m. This phase lasts until 2 a.m. Friday, covering the first two practice sessions before another transition period to get the track back to “warm” again. Advertisement “We have identified the time it takes to move each barrier,” Miller said. “We’ve got barrier number one on this corner, and where it is staged will take three minutes to move into position, then it will take another five minutes for them to set it, put the debris fence in and lock up the spiral connections. We know down to the minute.” Although there is a two-hour window to complete the process, Miller wanted to work in a buffer. “We’ve got it in the matrix of exactly how we’re going to make the two hours work, and clearly what we do is we make sure that what we have established is a one hour and 45-minute window, so we’re training to that with the 15-minute interval,” he said. “It’s extremely detailed in terms of how we move through each one of these openings and closings.” Despite adding a support race, the Ferrari Challenge, to the schedule this year, everything has stayed the same for the open and closed track transition. A big buffer was put in place for the race’s first running in 2023, but the lessons from that year gave the organizers confidence that the race could handle something being added to the schedule. There can, of course, be incidents that lead to delays, such as the loose water valve cover that canceled FP1 and meant FP2 did not finish until 4 a.m. last year, but these are also planned for in conjunction with the FIA and the local authorities. “We’re also doing scenario planning with the local fire department and police department, to everything from incursion of a spectator — ‘How the heck did they get on the track, what happens, how do we do that?'” Miller said. “So the level of planning that goes into this event is extraordinary.” By midnight Sunday local time, the race will be complete, and the post-race celebrations will begin. Miller’s team will immediately start the dismantling process. By 4 a.m., the track is back to “warm,” meaning cars can move around, and a degree of normality can resume for those driving in the middle of Las Vegas. “By Christmas, we will have picked up everything,” Miller said. It’s a sizable undertaking, but one was required to make F1’s dream of racing along the Strip possible. For Miller, even after a long and varied career in sports event planning and execution, it has been a completely different animal. “I’ve been involved in the design and construction of NFL stadiums, Major League Baseball stadiums, soccer facilities and Olympic facilities,” Miller said. “I’ve been doing it for 44 years now. Nothing compares to what I’ve seen here in Vegas for the F1 project.” (Top photo: Dan Istitene / Formula 1 / Formula 1 via Getty Images) Luke Smith  is a Senior Writer covering Formula 1 for The Athletic.

Her Friend Didn’t Have the Chance.,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5921900/2024/11/21/nina-wilson-maddy-cusack-sheffield-united/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 22:17:59 +0000",How the death of a soccer player made one of her teammates quit playing the sport she loved: “Maddy would still be here if it wasn’t for football.”,"UK Women's Football She speaks from the heart, as a close friend of Maddy Cusack, and starts to explain why she has taken the life-changing decision to walk away from her professional career. “The game, as a whole, seems reluctant to change or accept criticism,” Nina Wilson tells The Athletic. “But if a player’s death is not a wake-up call for the entire game, I don’t know what is. Maddy would still be here if it wasn’t for football and the lack of support systems and, unless these issues are addressed properly, this will happen again.” Advertisement Wilson, 25, was a team-mate of Cusack’s at Sheffield United and, like her friend, there was a time when she was immensely proud to represent the club. “I feel like I was born to play football,” she says. “It has always been my passion. I played for the love of the game and I have always been so proud and grateful to be a professional player.” Today, though, she is announcing that she has decided to quit playing because she is so disillusioned by how the club — and women’s football as a whole — have responded to Cusack’s death and the failures, she believes, that led to a previously happy 27-year-old taking her own life. Wilson says she experienced the “worst six months of my life” after the appointment of Jonathan Morgan as the team’s manager. It left her, she says, “a shell of a person” and she gave evidence to that effect to the club-commissioned inquiry that, to the dismay of Cusack’s family, cleared Morgan of bullying or wrongdoing in relation to any player. Morgan, who denies causing Cusack’s emotional anguish, is now the subject of a Football Association investigation into an official complaint from her parents, David and Deborah, stating why they believe their eldest daughter “would still be with us had he not been appointed.” Morgan denies any form of bullying and says he is the victim of a witch hunt. Wilson, a goalkeeper with more than 100 career appearances, says her own experiences of Morgan left her feeling “worthless and extremely isolated” in line with the initial investigation’s findings that he could divide opinion among the players. Some found him caring and supportive. Others, including Wilson, reported that he could be divisive, even intimidating, and favoured certain players while ignoring and cold-shouldering others. Wilson’s reasons for going public are mostly because “the lessons haven’t been learned and it is difficult to feel like anything is changing or that football, as a whole, wants to make things better.” She wants to show solidarity with the Cusack family and, in doing so, she states: GO DEEPER Special report: Maddy Cusack - why her family want a new investigation into her death In ordinary circumstances, Wilson would be approaching the peak years of a playing career that has featured spells at London City Lionesses, Watford, Lewes and her hometown club, Brighton & Hove Albion. These, however, are not ordinary circumstances and she has decided to give up playing, after seven years as a professional, for as long as “football has its head in the sand and no one cares enough to want to change anything.” Advertisement Wilson has not tried to find another club since becoming a free agent in the summer. It has been her own choice and one of the reasons, she says, is that it would be harder to speak freely if she was still involved in the sport. “When I found out about Maddy, the first thing that multiple members of the team said was that ‘it could have been any of us.’ “As awful as it sounds, they were the direct conversations that were happening after Maddy died. There was a group of us who said it could have happened to us. Those players, including Maddy, regarded it as the worst times we had ever had in football and couldn’t have been in a darker place. “We’d been made to feel like we weren’t worth anything. It felt like we didn’t matter as people any more. Some of us just went off the radar and barely spoke for weeks and months on end. You could go into training and not be acknowledged by anyone all day.” Morgan took the Sheffield United job in February 2023, despite the club’s then head of women’s football, Zoe Johnson, emailing her colleagues during the selection process to warn them that, although she believed he was a good coach, he “doesn’t have a great reputation” within women’s football. His appointment coincided with Cusack losing her place as an automatic starter in a team where she was a fans’ favourite. She had played for Morgan before at Leicester City and, according to her family, it had left her with the clear impression that he disliked her. Wilson says she saw, close up, how her team-mate became “nervous and withdrawn” in Morgan’s presence and no longer seemed her usual self. “Maddy was always a massive leader in the team and such a confident person – that changed almost overnight. “She tried so hard to please him and do what was right by the team. She still trained hard, doing extra running and fitness sessions. If we ever asked, ‘You OK, Mads?’ she would turn it back in typical Maddy fashion, as if she was more worried about others. ‘Just getting my head down,’ she’d say, ‘are you OK, though?’ Advertisement “Both of us were in a very similar position whereby we couldn’t be ourselves any more. We couldn’t be that bubbly, confident person. The whole culture (under Morgan) had shifted massively. It was very divisive and it made no sense because, just a few months before, we were a really close team and all really good friends. “That’s what I loved about being there. I loved Sheffield and I loved being at the club. But a lot of us just shut down and stopped talking. We didn’t know who we could trust any more. It made it a horrible environment and if you tried to bring up issues with other people at the club you were either pushed further out or laughed off. The response was, ‘Well, he’s the manager.’ “Anyone who dared to speak out was completely frozen out. Other staff and players would walk past and not even acknowledge you. You felt like you were invisible, like you didn’t really matter. Multiple players, including myself and Maddy, were made to feel this way. We were seasoned players. We’ve all been dropped before; that’s just football. What’s not acceptable is to put people down so much they feel they have no value as a person.” In Wilson’s evidence to the club inquiry, seen by The Athletic, she states Morgan went out of his way to blank her and recalled how unhappy it made her, as a hard-working player with no disciplinary issues, when she reported back from a loan spell at Wolverhampton Wanderers and was informed she was not welcome to train with the rest of the squad. Morgan, she says, “made that decision without ever even talking to me… I’d never even met him.” She moved to Scotland in the summer of 2023 to join Hibernian for “a new start … to help me get that bubbly, upbeat person back.” However, she had been at her new club only a few weeks when she took the telephone call that turned her world upside down. “Maddy was gone,” she says. “I got the call while I was in my car before training and I already knew, without anyone having to tell me, that it was because of football.” Cusack, a former England Under-19 international, was United’s vice-captain and longest-serving player as well as working as a marketing executive in the club’s commercial department. She had previously played for Leicester, Birmingham City and Aston Villa, having come through the youth systems of Nottingham Forest and Chesterfield. Advertisement Fourteen months after her friend’s death, Wilson believes there needs to be much better support systems in place for players who need emotional and psychological help. It saddens her that “every club should be learning from Maddy’s death but, rather than looking at themselves, they would rather believe it was an one-off tragedy that won’t happen again. “I think it will happen again. And I know the family think it will happen again. So, are we just going to wait for that to happen? Does someone else need to lose their life? Because that’s what I ask myself every day.” GO DEEPER A year on from her death, let's talk about Maddy Cusack - and who she really was What many people might find shocking is how little, on average, players earn in the top two divisions, the Women’s Super League and Women’s Championship, and how that can add to the pressures that already exist from working in a highly competitive environment. Wilson had to find other ways to supplement her £6,000-a-year income, taking a job with the club’s community foundation as well as doing bar work in the evenings. It could be gruelling keeping down three jobs, especially at a time when the demands on players were higher than ever before. But that, she says, is one of the realities of the women’s game for many players. “The demands continue to increase, and so do the pressures, but the wages don’t, the provisions don’t and the player care doesn’t,” says Wilson. “We (the players) are the ones taking the hit for how much the profile of the game is growing. You’re earning the bare minimum in some cases but you’re made to feel you should be grateful for whatever you can get. It’s very easy to end up in a dark place and think, ‘What’s the point? Why have I given up everything for this?’” Against that backdrop, it can seem strange and unsatisfactory to Cusack’s family and friends that a tragedy of this nature has not led to greater scrutiny of the women’s game. “Most people (in the media) haven’t touched it,” says Wilson. “It (the coverage of women’s football) is all about ‘the image of the game.’ Nobody wants to make the game look bad. So nobody dares say anything and, if that comes at the detriment of the players, the people in higher positions seem OK with it. Advertisement “This should have been the main story of women’s football for months – not just in the week after Maddy died. This needs to upend everything in the game. We need to look at how we are failing players. It’s about the pressures that are put on players, the lack of support, the lack of available whistleblowing. It’s about making the game better and safer.” Other players, she adds, have been “silenced more or less” by the culture of a fast-expanding sport or because of non-disclosure agreements similar to the one that prevents another former United player from speaking about her own complaint against Morgan’s alleged “bully-like behaviours.” Morgan was sacked in February over revelations that he had a secret three-year affair with a teenage player while managing Leicester. He has said previously that he is confident the FA inquiry will exonerate him of any wrongdoing in relation to Cusack or any other United player. An inquest into Cusack’s death will be heard next year and, by going public, Wilson is making it clear she “doesn’t want Maddy’s family to feel they are alone in this fight.” She is aware, because she was there herself, that nobody senior from the club’s hierarchy attended the vigil outside Bramall Lane on September 20 to mark the anniversary of Cusack’s death. As for Cusack’s old shirt number, it seems remarkably hard-faced that the club have decided against retiring it despite a 1,200-name petition being raised by fans 11 months ago. “There’s clearly resistance,” says Wilson, “and that resistance feels extremely unnecessary. Maddy was ‘Miss Sheffield United’. She lived and breathed the club and I don’t know who else could ever wear her shirt. It (retiring her number) seems such an obvious thing to do.” Sheffield United and Morgan were approached for comment by The Athletic.  Advertisement An emotional Wilson was one of the speakers at the vigil, alongside Cusack’s youngest sister, Felicia, and used the occasion to urge her former club to rethink their position and understand “it sets a dangerous precedent to lose a member of our community and simply move on and forget, as it seems some organisations would like to.” In a statement, United told The Athletic: “There is currently a Football Association investigation ongoing with regards to a number of the points raised. Sheffield United have fully co-operated in this regard and continue to respectfully await the outcome.” The club say they are continuing “to grow and evolve, which includes transitioning from part-time to full-time” and that, as well as having a dedicated women’s safeguarding officer, a player-care officer and access to mental health first-aiders and wellbeing services, they have “further plans to strengthen the support staff.” United also say they have had an external and independent whistleblowing service in place since 2018 with Safecall, the Sunderland-based firm that carried out the investigation into Morgan on the club’s behalf. Wilson, however, says that in her two years at the club she was never made aware of an external whistleblowing service for players. Wilson is now on the committee of the MC8 charity foundation set up in her friend’s name. She had worn Cusack’s No 8 on her gloves at Hibernian and felt glad that, purely by coincidence, she had chosen 44 as her shirt number at the start of the season. “Maddy always supported me when I played,” she says. “I wanted to continue playing for her. But in the end, I couldn’t.” Instead, Wilson has been putting on mental-health workshops with various clubs, as well as coaching younger players. It is not clear when, if ever, she will pull on her gloves again. But she is determined to make good from bad. “A few people have said, ‘What about your career?’” she says. “I know I’m taking a risk. But I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t do what I thought was right. I can’t play football unless I love it. And my love for football won’t return until something changes and there is justice for Maddy.” (Top photos: Getty Images, courtesy of Nina Wilson; design: Eamonn Dalton) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,N.F.L. Sends Warning to Teams Regarding Burglaries of Players’ Homes,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938166/2024/11/21/nfl-security-alert-home-burglaries/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 22:17:59 +0000",The league’s alert comes after the homes of Kansas City stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce were burglarized last month.,"NFL By Dianna Russini, Larry Holder and Alex Andrejev The NFL sent a memo to teams from the league’s security branch earlier this week warning about the threat of burglary groups targeting the homes of professional athletes. The Athletic obtained a copy of the memo. This alert comes after burglaries at the homes of Kansas City Chiefs stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce last month. Two law enforcement officials told NBC News the FBI is working with local agencies to determine whether the recent burglaries are connected to a transnational crime syndicate. Per NBC’s report Wednesday, there has been no determination about who is responsible and the investigation is ongoing. Advertisement “The homes of professional athletes across multiple sports leagues have become increasingly targeted for burglaries by organized and skilled groups,” the NFL’s memo said. “Law enforcement officials have noted these groups appear to exploit team schedules to target athletes’ homes on game days.” The memo also included ways the groups survey players’ whereabouts and explained methods of entry into homes. The league security team provided recommendations regarding the use of social media, including avoiding posting images of expensive items or comments about hotel accommodations. The memo also spelled out methods of home security. The NFL issued this security alert to clubs to tell their players and staff about “organized and skilled” criminals increasingly targeting professional athletes' homes. pic.twitter.com/EoArE8dTw0 — Dianna Russini (@DMRussini) November 21, 2024  Mahomes addressed the incident involving his home last Wednesday, calling it “frustrating” and “disappointing.” “I can’t get into too many of the details because the investigation is still ongoing,” he said. “But obviously something that you don’t want to happen to really anybody, but obviously yourself.” Officers responded to a reported burglary shortly after midnight on Oct. 6 at Mahomes’ estate in Belton, Mo., according to a police report from the Cass County, Mo. Sheriff’s Office. Mahomes is not identified in the report, but the address listed matches public records for the three-time Super Bowl MVP quarterback. A day after the reported burglary at Mahomes’ home, another reported burglary occurred around 7:30 p.m. on Oct. 7 at a residence in Leawood, Kan., believed to belong to Kelce, according to a Leawood Police Department offense report. The Chiefs beat the New Orleans Saints at Arrowhead Stadium in a “Monday Night Football” game that night with Taylor Swift, Kelce’s girlfriend, in attendance. Advertisement The police report for the incident indicated that $20,000 in cash was taken and that there was $1,000 worth of damage to a rear door. A spokesperson for the Leawood Police Department declined to provide additional details, saying the department does not release victim information except in cases of fatalities, crashes and homicides.

NYT > Sports,Matthew Gaudreau Was So Much More Than the Brother of Johnny Hockey,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5930652/2024/11/20/matthew-gaudreau-boston-college/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 22:17:59 +0000","The brothers died after being struck by a car on Aug. 29. For some, the sense of loss still hasn’t sunk in.","NHL His brother was Johnny Hockey. He had the Matty Dance. Ask any of Matthew Gaudreau’s childhood buddies about his moves, and they’ll chuckle knowingly. Gaudreau and his group of friends, which included his older brother, John, loved country music, especially Kenny Chesney. They regularly tailgated before concerts in college and in the years that followed. The group gathered early those summer days. They ate Wawa breakfast sandwiches on the way in. They sipped beer in stadium parking lots, leaving red plastic cups scattered near the cooler, and grilled for dinner. These were all-day affairs. Advertisement And at some point, without a doubt, Matty Gaudreau would find his way onto the back of someone’s truck, often when a Chesney song blared over the speakers. He’d break out the Matty Dance. “Just swinging his arms around in a circular, slow motion,” says friend Eric Robinson. “Some version of a windmill with a hip thrust,” adds Hunter Brody. They can still see it. This is who Matthew Gaudreau was: a life-of-the-party presence, arms waving through the air. When his widow, Madeline, spoke at his funeral, she described him as so much more than a hockey player, coach and friend. That’s a consensus among people who loved him. He was someone who made a point to connect with others, be it his high school teachers or younger teammates at Boston College. Someone who never felt jealous of his older brother, a more skilled player who became an NHL star. Someone who cried when he heard his unborn son’s heartbeat for the first time. On Aug. 29, Matthew and John — his closest friend — were biking in Oldmans Township, N.J., when a Jeep Grand Cherokee struck them from behind. Both were pronounced dead at the scene. John was 31, Matthew 29. Their sister Katie’s wedding was scheduled for the next day. When talking about Gaudreau, those who knew him often slip into the present tense. His death is still so recent that, for some, it doesn’t feel real that he’s gone. Perhaps it never will. The Gaudreau brothers grew up in a white, two-story house in Penns Grove, N.J., a small town southwest of Philadelphia. They regularly hosted their friends for bonfires and evenings at the backyard pool. Brody, who grew close with Matthew in high school, felt like he was there every summer night when he was younger. Matthew and John shared a bedroom overlooking the gravel driveway. Old hockey jerseys hung from the walls. When friends spent the night, the brothers pushed their beds together so more people could fit. Others would fight over air mattresses, trying to avoid the one with a hole in it. They’d get up in the mornings for training sessions and skates, then often find themselves back at the house again at night. Advertisement The Gaudreaus were as tight-knit a family as could be. Community mattered. Their house was the center of it all. Matthew was slight in build. Friends remember waking up to Guy Gaudreau, his dad, whipping up breakfast. He’d pile eggs and bacon on Matthew’s plate, trying to help him put on weight. Sometimes Matthew would get so full he’d shove eggs to the family dog, Sadie, while Guy was looking away. The weight never stuck. When teams took measurements, Matthew would sometimes stuff pucks in his jock strap to trick the scale. His wife said in her eulogy that she thought he looked 90 pounds when they met as teenagers. The Gaudreau name carries weight in the South Jersey hockey community. Guy worked as the hockey director at Hollydell Ice Arena in Sewell, N.J., not far from Penns Grove. Dan Spencer, now an emergency backup goalie for the Flyers, calls Gaudreau the best coach he ever had. John Gaudreau, Eric Robinson, Buddy Robinson and Tony DeAngelo played at Hollydell growing up and went on to appear in NHL games. Plenty of other college players like Matthew started their careers there. “There are a crazy number of people who came out of Hollydell for being a small rink in South Jersey,” says Eric Robinson, now a forward on the Hurricanes. Boston College coach Jerry York once asked Guy how he taught Johnny and Matthew such good edge control. He replied that he trained them with Skittles. He’d throw one on the ice, and the boys would have to skate to it. Then he’d throw another. On top of his responsibilities at Hollydell, Gaudreau coached the Gloucester Catholic High team. In 2009-10, Matthew’s freshman year and John’s junior year, the team went 15-4-2 and made its first-ever state championship. Though the Rams lost, both boys had a point in the final. Years later, Matthew would describe his days on the Gloucester team as the most fun he ever had playing hockey. Advertisement Close as they were, the brothers had different personalities. Principal Thomas Iacovone remembers John as the quieter of the two. He wanted to fade into the background. He wanted to be like any other kid. “Matty wanted you to know he was there,” he says. “He did it in such a way that you couldn’t help but to love him.” Iacovone was a history teacher when Matthew was in school and taught him in first-period homeroom his sophomore year. Matthew pulled his chair up to Iacovone’s desk seemingly every morning. They chatted about Philadelphia sports while waiting for the morning announcements. Rarely did the conversations revolve around Gaudreau himself. “He would engage me in what he knew I liked, and I was the teacher,” Iacovone says. “It should’ve been the other way around.” Once class began, Iacovone occasionally had to tell Gaudreau to sit down and be quiet. That was difficult, though; it usually resulted in Gaudreau cracking a joke that made him laugh. He was too charming to get in trouble, remembers now-athletic director Ryan Murphy, then an assistant athletic director. Matthew left Gloucester Catholic early to play junior hockey in Omaha, where he met his wife and skated for the Lancers, a United States Hockey League club. In the week before moving away from New Jersey, he and Brody embarked on a morning fishing trip. They left at 5 a.m. Gaudreau was sad about leaving the friends he made at Gloucester Catholic, Brody remembers, but he was excited, too. This was a big step: at that age, junior hockey felt like the biggest thing in the world. They stood in the dark, shoes muddy. Bugs bit their exposed skin as they cast their lines into the water. Their futures lay ahead of them. Matthew and John were determined to play college hockey together, and John found himself in a lurch in June 2011, months before his freshman year. He had committed to Northeastern, but coach Greg Cronin had just left for a job as a Maple Leafs assistant. The older Gaudreau brother got out of his letter of intent because of the coaching change, but then he needed to find a new school — and fast. Advertisement Not long after, the Gaudreau brothers and their parents were on Boston College’s campus. Future NHLer Kevin Hayes showed the boys around, York remembers, while he talked to the parents. After they were done, they stood in front of the rink. “Well, what do you guys think?” York asked. “Any questions?” John turned to his younger brother. That’s whose opinion mattered to him. “Let’s go here,” Matthew replied. And so they did. Their mother, Jane, said in a 2014 New York Times article that Matthew actually preferred Boston University, but he chose the Eagles when John gave him the final decision because he knew it was what his older brother wanted. “He was kind of a dynamic presence in their relationship, almost like he was the older brother,” York says of Matthew. “Johnny looked for advice from Matty an awful lot.” The decision had a major impact on both the program and the brothers. John was a point-per-game player as a freshman, two years before Matthew arrived on campus. The Eagles won the NCAA title that season. The season Matthew got to school, John won the Hobey Baker Award as the nation’s top collegiate player. Matthew played in only eight games that year. Not once, though, did he show a hint of jealousy. “He was his No. 1 fan,” says teammate Mike Matheson, a now-Canadiens defenseman who was the grade between the brothers. “They were just inseparable.” Though Matthew was not a lineup regular, he still had an important role with the team. Matheson remembers Matthew, aided by his relationship with John, acting as a bridge between the freshmen and upperclassmen. He made sure everyone was involved and did so throughout his time at Boston College. Classmate Ryan Fitzgerald describes him as “everybody’s first call.” Whenever someone wanted to do something, they called Matthew. Advertisement “As cliquey as he could have been, he was always setting stuff up for everybody, making sure everyone was there, making sure every guy was happy and comfortable,” says Zach Sanford, who was a year below Matthew. Fitzgerald and Matthew lived together in six-person, on-campus suites their sophomore to senior years. One day rolled into the next: class, hockey and then hours on the couch talking the time away with their roommates. Those, Fitzgerald says, are memories he’ll always hold close. Matthew and Madeline were managing long-distance dating at the time, and she would visit frequently. Fitzgerald loved seeing how his friend’s face lit up with her in the room. He jokes she was their mother roommate. The hockey players lived like, well, college boys. She was disgusted whenever she arrived. She’d tell Matthew and his friends they couldn’t keep living like this. They’d all agree with her — temporarily, at least. “And then she’d come back a month later, and it’d look like a bomb went off,” Fitzgerald says. From a hockey perspective, sitting out most of his freshman year couldn’t have been easy for Matthew, who played more than 50 games each of the previous two seasons in Omaha. He didn’t let that show. York remembers him focusing through video work and prescouts of other teams, remaining ready at all times. This wasn’t a typical throwaway year for a kid who wasn’t playing much. He made sure to gain experience. Matheson describes Gaudreau as “the best I’ve ever seen” at handling being a scratch. Fitzgerald doesn’t think he’d have handled it as well. But Matthew savored his year as college teammates with his brother. Gaudreau’s attitude eventually paid off. He played in most games his sophomore and junior seasons, then never came out of the lineup as a senior. He was nearly a point-per-game player by graduation, scoring eight goals and 35 points in 40 games his final season with the Eagles. Advertisement Though his skill showed by the time he left Boston College, Matthew had different elements to his game than his brother. Despite his 5-foot-9, 137-pound frame, “he was a little s— disturber,” Fitzgerald says. He didn’t shy away from scrums. His senior season — the same year John won the NHL’s Lady Byng Trophy for gentlemanly conduct — Matthew was one of only two Boston College players with more than 50 penalty minutes. Though similarly small, John was better at eluding contact, York remembers. Matthew would take huge hits. But he always seemed to get right back up, even when York prepared to send the trainers on the ice. “It was like he had a heart of steel,” the coach says. By the time Matthew graduated, he was ready to pursue professional hockey — something York thought seemed improbable at earlier points during his college career. He willed himself to that point. Graduation itself was memorable for Fitzgerald. The night before, the hockey players skipped the senior class celebration, instead going out on their own. “I don’t think any of us slept,” he says. Wearing black robes the next day, Matthew and Fitzgerald, both communication majors, joined their classmates for a procession through campus. As they waited, a woman came by asking if anyone wanted to lead the students while holding a large, maroon Boston College flag over their head. “I’ll do it!” Matthew called out. Fitzgerald still laughs thinking about it. All these communications majors had probably spent the entire night before together, but there leading the way was Matthew Gaudreau, bags under his eyes from one last college all-nighter with his friends. Gaudreau carved out a professional playing career for as long as he could. Most of his games came in the ECHL, two rungs below the NHL, but he appeared in 21 AHL games, too, and also had a brief stint playing in Sweden. Gaudreau looked like a hockey lifer, just like his dad. Ryan Murphy, the Gloucester Catholic athletic director, remembers Guy telling him at one point that Matthew would become a great coach. While with the ECHL team in Worcester, less than an hour out of Boston, he’d swing by his college to say hi to York and the Eagles. York, who was always impressed with how well Gaudreau observed the game, remembers his former player asking questions about coaching on those visits. Advertisement “The promise of life he had coming …” York says, trailing off. When John emerged as an NHL player, he began hosting offseason skills camps for kids at Hollydell. Robinson remembers going to the locker room with the brothers before camps began. Without fail, John would ask Matthew what drills they should do. The friend group joked that the younger brother was becoming his dad. “He had a knack for it,” Robinson says. “For whatever reason, some guys who play, they can transition into that.” Gaudreau got his coaching start with Philadelphia Hockey Club, which practiced at — where else? — Hollydell Ice Arena. The next season, 2022-23, a new opportunity arose: Gloucester Catholic needed a new hockey coach. Matthew met with Iacovone and Ryan Meehan, then the athletic director, at an Italian restaurant near Hollydell. They talked for two hours, mainly about life outside of the sport. When it came to the job, Iacovone told Gaudreau he was his No. 1 choice — and he didn’t have a No. 2. A few days later, Gaudreau accepted the position his dad once held. His goal was to make a career out of coaching, and he was on his way. Guy joined his son’s staff as an assistant for 2022-23, and so did Spencer, his former Gloucester teammate. The team went 9-9-2 and made a run to the state semifinal. Billy Sheridan, a player on that team, remembers he could walk into Gaudreau’s office at any time and ask for help. During his time as Gloucester coach, Gaudreau tried to get his players to recognize how special high school hockey is. “You guys don’t realize it,” he’d tell them, “but this is going to be the best four years of your life.” The next season was more difficult. Key players graduated, and the team’s numbers dipped to around a dozen. It was hard to hold complete practices with so few players, and Gaudreau himself had to miss at times because of commitments as an assistant coach for the Philadelphia Rebels, the Hollydell-based junior team. Gloucester didn’t win a game that season. After it ended, Gaudreau met again with Iacovone. He felt it was best to step away. He couldn’t commit fully to the team and didn’t feel that was fair to the players. Plus, he had his first baby, Tripp, on the way. Life was going to get busy. Madeline Gaudreau wore a pink dress with a white floral pattern as she stepped to the marble podium at St. Mary Magdalen Catholic Church in Media, Pa. During her eulogy, she spoke of her husband’s bond with John, how they loved sharing a bedroom growing up and never wanted it to change. It brings her comfort that they are still together. Advertisement “Anyone who knows Matty knows he was born to be a dad,” she said toward the end of the speech, stopping to compose herself. The idea of fatherhood consumed Matthew. He asked John for advice, ordered books and researched diaper brands. Iacovone remembers how excited he was when he saw him over the summer. Matthew never got to meet baby Tripp, who is due next month, according to Madeline’s Instagram account. Tributes have rolled in since his death. Hollydell held a memorial for the boys. Gloucester Catholic did, too, during which the hockey team presented Guy and Jane with a jersey. Both the Flyers and Blue Jackets have given Guy the chance to help with team practices. The Gaudreau family wanted loved ones to stop by their house in the days after John and Matthew’s deaths. People brought coffee and meals. During one visit, Brody went upstairs to Matthew and John’s old room, the site of their teenage sleepovers. It looked unchanged from when they were kids. He got the same feeling Madeline experiences when standing in baby Tripp’s nursery. They can feel Matthew with them. (Illustration: Meech Robinson / The Athletic.

NYT > Sports,It’s Her Serve and She’ll Do It Underarm if She Wants to,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936031/2024/11/21/sara-errani-tennis-player-italy-serve/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 22:17:59 +0000",Sara Errani regularly serves slower than a club player. She also has a career Golden Slam in doubles.,"Tennis MALAGA, Spain — Sara Errani stands at the baseline and exhales deeply. She is about to hit a second serve, with Italy up match point against Poland. A place in the Billie Jean King Cup final is at stake. So Errani does what she has done many, many times before: she hits an underarm serve. The ball floats into the service box and onto the racket of Iga Swiatek, one of two women’s players who can claim to be the best in the world. Swiatek is on to it in a flash and hits her return deep to Errani’s forehand. Errani again does what she has done many, many times before: she gets the ball back. Advertisement She does the same on her opponent’s next shot, hoisting a backhand lob into the air. Swiatek loops a forehand volley long and Italy is through to the final for the second year in a row. Errani collapses to the ground in relief, celebrating with her partner Jasmine Paolini and shaking hands with the defeated opponents a few seconds later, before allowing herself a what-have-I-just-done smile.  For Errani, 37, it was another successful heist in a career full of them. On Wednesday, she added a fourth Billie Jean King Cup title (three of which came when it was the Federation Cup) to the career Golden Grand Slam in doubles she completed this year by winning gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics alongside Paolini. It has been a stunning year for Errani, who also won the mixed doubles title at the U.S. Open with another Italian, Andrea Vavassori. She thought 2024 would be her last on tour, having won her last major 10 years ago. “My thought last year was to play in the Olympics and then stop playing tennis, but we’re playing great in doubles and I’m having so much fun,” she said in an interview in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, at the WTA Tour Finals earlier this month. Completing the doubles Golden Slam in Paris put Errani in an elite group of just seven women. When looking back on her career, the underarm serve to Swiatek on Monday will feel like a defining moment for a player who uses the contentious tactic more consistently and more particularly than anybody else. Her story with the underarm serve goes to the heart of her tennis life. The underarm serve is one of tennis’s most curious shots, caught between the poles of disrespectful trick shot and tactical masterstroke. Big servers like Nick Kyrgios can use it to take advantage of opponents who are standing back anticipating a 140mph rocket. There is an element of showmanship too; this is very much the case with Alexander Bublik. He might be blessed with a big serve, but he is also the current player probably most synonymous with the cheeky alternative. Advertisement Other players use it against specific opponents. World No. 68 Alexandre Muller told The Athletic at Wimbledon that he had specifically practised the shot to use it against Daniil Medvedev, who has one of the deepest return positions in the sport. Corentin Moutet, a master of the shot, started practising underarm serves after a shoulder injury. He has since incorporated them into his game, doing so to great acclaim at this year’s French Open. He used the underarm serve 12 times in his third-round win against Sebastian Ofner, winning nine of those points. He is the opposite of a player like Kyrgios, using the underarm serve because he doesn’t expect to win free points behind his first serve; there is no drop-off in expected value. GO DEEPER How Corentin Moutet's 12 underarm serves shook Roland Garros Errani’s reason for using the shot will be familiar to many amateur players: she just doesn’t trust her serve. Errani stands at 5ft 5in (164cm) which is diminutive by modern tennis standards — just like her partner Paolini, whose serve has some heat despite her height of 5ft 4in. Errani does not have this pace, and her height has contributed to a shot often derided as the worst serve in the sport. Smiling, she says it would be amazing to be a bit taller. “Many times, I think about that.” Instead of letting her serve become a complete albatross, Errani has used her ground skills, tactical nous and the shock factor of a serve that regularly registers around 60mph (96.5kph) on the speed gun to reach the very top of tennis in singles and doubles. She reached the 2012 French Open final in singles and cracked the world’s top five a year later, despite her opponents feeling that they ought to break her every single game. Instead, they are bamboozled by her incredible dexterity at the net or from the back of the court, as well as struggling to read and return her serve. “It comes so slow and it kind of floats in the air,” Mirjana Lucic-Baroni said in a news conference after losing to Errani in the 2014 U.S. Open fourth round, a match in which Errani’s average serve speed was 76mph. “It was really difficult to time the balls.” Errani’s serve became something of a meme in 2024 after Daniil Medvedev completely failed to return it at all during a mixed doubles match at the Paris Olympics. Advertisement Errani herself said in a news conference after that match that she has a different approach to serving from most players: “I don’t try to make winners,” she said. “I just try to make kick, make slice, try to change my game. I need to start the point where I want. So sometimes is better for me to serve not that fast, because if you serve fast the ball is coming (back) faster.” That conviction hasn’t always been there. Her serve reached a nadir in April 2019 when she was only recently back from a 10-month doping suspension for ingesting letrozole, which was increased from an original two months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Errani said she was “really disgusted” by the length of the ban, saying that her case was because of contamination after her mother, who was taking letrozole for breast cancer, dropped pills on their kitchen counter where they prepared meals. At the Copa Colsanitas in Bogota, Colombia, Errani served 18 double faults per match in three consecutive matches (all of which she won) before hitting around half her serves underarm in a quarter-final defeat to Astra Sharma. Later that year at a low-level event in Asuncion, Paraguay, Errani took the nuclear option by serving underarm for the entire tournament. She reached the final, copping a huge amount of social media abuse in the process. In response, she wrote on Instagram: “In Italy, I keep being insulted by a lot of people, regarding mainly my serve. “If it is not ok for you, send a letter to WTA asking to change rules about serve or ask them to disqualify me for awful serve. If instead you just have other problems with me, send a letter to Santa.” Five years on, she says her serve had completely overtaken everything else. “I couldn’t compete. I was thinking all the time about my serve,” she says. Advertisement “My coach said: ‘Do one tournament all underarm and just compete.’ It was to try to make my head free from, not panic, but the tough moments.” Despite recovering from those yips, Errani then endured an anxiety dream of a service game at the 2020 French Open during a second-round defeat to Kiki Bertens. Errani was given two time violations after five aborted ball tosses and landed only one overarm serve, with one attempt missing the baseline. Serving for the set, she was broken to love.  “Sometimes it’s there and it can come out, but I try to manage it,” she says of the nerves that can grip her when serving. “When I was practising, my serve was good. But then in matches, I was feeling the block, the panic. I know it’s still there. It’s not like it’s in the past.” Errani, an unwitting trailblazer, can laugh at the fact that the underarm serve has come back into fashion, certainly on the men’s side, over the past few years. “If it can be a good tactic, why not?” she laughs. Against Swiatek, the decision was more of a vibe. “I just advised Jasmine after the first serve, so it’s just I feel it and I did it, just like that, not thinking too much,” she said in a news conference after the match. At 37, Errani is the Italian team’s most experienced player, and as her team-mates chorused in Wednesday’s celebratory news conference she is “the brain of the team”. Errani resembles her compatriot Jorginho, the Brazilian-born Italy and Arsenal midfielder who is so intelligent that he is a reference point for everybody else despite not being the most physically gifted. GO DEEPER Jorginho exclusive: Arsenal 'energy', no-hop penalties, love for Havertz, knowing strengths Paolini, who is the world No. 4 in singles and a two-time Grand Slam finalist this year, constantly looks to Errani for guidance on the doubles court. “She wants me to tell her what to do every point – even when she serves, she likes me to tell her where to put it and I’m trying to push her to tell me what she’s feeling more,” Errani said. Whatever the tactics, the Errani-Paolini partnership is contributing to a golden period for tennis in Italy. On the men’s side, Jannik Sinner is the world No. 1 and has won two Grand Slams this year. He is part of an Italy team that is hoping to defend the Davis Cup this week and make it a double with the victorious BJK Cup group. Errani, who lived through a period when she was one of the ‘Fab Four’ Italian women who all reached a Grand Slam final and the world’s top 10 between 2010 and 2014 (Francesca Schiavone, Roberta Vinci and Flavia Pennetta were the others), believes that all the current top players from her country are pushing each other to greater heights. Advertisement And Errani has no desire to leave the golden age behind just yet.  “I said to Jasmine: ‘I’ll continue next year for sure and then we’ll see,’” she says. After the genre-defining underarm serve against Swiatek, this wily veteran still has at least one last heist in her.

NYT > Sports,Which Team Will Sign Juan Soto? Here’s a Ranking of the Suitors.,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935858/2024/11/21/mlb-juan-soto-free-agency-teams-suitors/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 22:17:59 +0000","Five teams — the Mets, Yankees, Dodgers, Red Sox and Blue Jays — have met with Soto and his agent already.","MLB Three weeks into this MLB offseason, two questions dominate the discussion across the sport: Which team will sign Juan Soto? And for how much? The Soto sweepstakes are heating up. Five teams — the Mets, Yankees, Dodgers, Red Sox and Blue Jays — have met with Soto and his agent, Scott Boras, to make their initial pitches. A sixth team, the Phillies, is expected to sit down with Soto soon, and more could follow. Advertisement The teams know they have a chance to sign a generational player who is just entering his prime. They also know it’ll cost them. Soto’s contract is expected to break records in terms of both average annual value and present-day value (as calculated for luxury tax purposes), but not surpass the total amount of Shohei Ohtani’s heavily deferred 10-year, $700 million deal with the Dodgers from last offseason. Sources with the involved teams believe the Soto contract will end up being $550 million to $650 million, depending on the structure of the deal, and 10 to 15 years, depending on luxury tax impact and other factors that could benefit the team in terms of length. (For comparison’s sake, keep in mind Ohtani’s $700 million deal had a net present value of $460 million for luxury tax purposes because of all the deferrals. The next largest contracts in MLB history were Mike Trout at $426 million, Mookie Betts at $365 million and Aaron Judge at $360 million.) I predicted a 15-year, $622 million contract when I finalized my top free agent ranking in late October. I believed Soto would get $622 million because he is only 26, has one of the best hit tools the game has ever seen, and should age well. Fifteen years makes sense when you consider many superstar players have signed deals that run until they’re at least 40, even though the backends of those contracts rarely work out well for the teams. Those are eye-popping numbers, but they’re really not surprising given the player. A player who will be entering his age-26 season. A player who has already been to two World Series. A player who is comparable to Ted Williams with 40-home run power. Sure, Soto is only adequate defensively in the outfield — though he was a Gold Glove Award finalist this year — but he has a strong and accurate arm. Sure, he doesn’t possess blazing speed or get good leads, but he is a smart, instinctive base runner. Advertisement He’ll go down in history as one of the best on-base percentage players of all time. His bat plays at the highest level against the best pitching. His penchant for the dramatic is well-documented. All the cliches apply: He wants to be at the plate in the biggest moments, on the biggest stages — and he’s proven he’ll perform, as he demonstrated with a sensational walk-year season in New York that included a three-run homer that propelled the Yankees to their first World Series in 15 years. May we once again re-introduce, The Generational, Juan Soto. pic.twitter.com/6R5fWpEg6I — New York Yankees (@Yankees) October 20, 2024  After the World Series, Soto followed the Boras script to a T when he spoke to the media. “I don’t know what teams want to come after me, but definitely, I’ll be open to this and every single team,” Soto said. “I don’t have any doors closed or anything like that. I’m going to be available for all 30 teams.” Soto said he was open to any team, even if that might not be the case, because that’s the best way to get the best offer, and it’s surely what his agency advised. If a player wants a particular destination, Boras and his lieutenants don’t want anyone to know until the end of the process, so they can maximize the offer, let all the teams that are in the bidding think they have a chance — and then when they get the best offer — go back to the team the player prefers and ask for its best and final offer. Boras has always counseled his star clients to wait until free agency to sign to maximize their value, and that strategy is poised to pay off handsomely for Soto, who turned down $440 million from the Nationals in 2022 before he was eventually traded to San Diego. His agency has almost always recommended players take the most money and years — for themselves and their families but also to grow the market for future free agents. While some have suggested Soto prefers to play on the East Coast, during free agency he’s indicated he’s open to the West Coast. Several in the industry familiar with Soto and his camp believe he will take the biggest offer, with the most money and years trumping geography. The best opportunity to win championships could be a deciding factor among those he’ll consider. With the belief that the top teams will be willing to commit the dollars it takes to land him, in the end Soto will choose exactly where he wants to play. Advertisement At the start of this offseason, I thought about one-third of the teams in the league would make a serious bid for Soto. Things can change in the coming weeks, but at this point, I believe there are only six or seven legitimate landing spots for the four-time All-Star: the Mets, Yankees, Dodgers, Phillies and Red Sox — who I view as the most likely destinations — followed by the Blue Jays and maybe a team that’s yet to emerge. All of those named teams should have the resources to make a deal, and all but the Blue Jays should be contending or within striking distance of perennial contenders over the next several years. Boras has a long history of surprising the baseball world with free agent landing spots, like when Max Scherzer signed with Washington, Iván Rodriguez signed with Detroit and Alex Rodriguez broke the bank with the Rangers. If an unexpected team emerges and decides to outbid the field, there’s a chance Soto will accept the offer. It’s just tough to see that scenario unfolding, especially because that team would need to beat out so many big-market behemoths. But in my four decades working in MLB front offices, I learned it only takes one wild-card owner to change the free-agent landscape, one owner who’s willing to shatter records to land a franchise player for their club. Another variable to consider in all of this: The Boras Corporation represents many of the top free agents — and they are intermingled and can affect each other. For example, Boras also reps first baseman Pete Alonso. Let’s say, for illustrative purposes, Soto has six teams in contention and all are willing to bid in the $600 million range, but Alonso has only two teams that will bid in the $150 million to $200 million range and only one of those teams is also in on Soto. Then it might be best for the Boras Corporation and both of its clients if Alonso signs the best offer he can get but it also pushes Soto to one of his other five teams if the money he’s being offered is the same. Ultimately, the player makes the decision that’s best for him, but free agents’ markets can be connected and affect who signs who. MLB’s Winter Meetings will be held next month at the Hilton Anatole in Dallas, the same hotel where Boras negotiated A-Rod’s record-breaking deal with the Rangers in 2000 and where Albert Pujols shocked the sport by signing with the Angels in 2011. It’s easy to imagine Soto with Boras at the podium in Dallas a few weeks from now, announcing his next team and another ground-breaking deal. But which team’s cap will be on his head? Which fan base will be ecstatic? When the dust settles weeks or even months from now in the race for the offseason’s most-prized free agent, who will win the Soto sweepstakes? Advertisement Soto said he was open to joining all 30 teams. Below, I’ve ranked the field of plausible contenders — including teams actively pursuing him, others monitoring his market, and still others that make sense as destinations and possibly could emerge — based on who is most likely to land him. (I left out roughly two-thirds of the league because those teams either aren’t engaged in Soto’s market or have no realistic chance of signing him.) Here’s how I see the state of the Soto sweepstakes as of today. GO DEEPER Matchmaking the top 10 MLB free agents with the team where they fit best The Mets are my favorites to sign Soto because I believe if their owner, Steve Cohen, wants him, he will make the highest bid — offering the most dollars and years — and if he does that and no other team matches it, I think he’s getting his man. Cohen was the highest bidder last offseason for Yoshinobu Yamamoto before the Dodgers matched the Mets’ bid, and his offer two years ago to Brandon Nimmo (eight years, $162 million) far exceeded any other the outfielder had received. The tandem of Judge and Soto brought back memories of Ruth and Gehrig and Mantle and Maris — and rightfully so. Soto seemed at home in the Bronx. He loved the fans and the fans loved him. I think if the Yankees have the best offer on the table, or match it, there is a strong chance he returns. If they don’t sign Soto, expect them to immediately pivot to some combination of Anthony Santander, Christian Walker, Willy Adames and Tanner Scott. GO DEEPER Yankees' Steinbrenner battles Mets' Cohen for Soto: 'I know what's expected of me' If I’m Soto, I’d sign with the Dodgers because they are positioned to build a dynasty. Can you imagine a lineup of Ohtani, Betts, Freeman and Soto for the next several years? My goodness. Beyond their overwhelming talent, the Dodgers have the resources and the culture that give Soto the best shot of winning in the short- and long-term. Phillies president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski has a track record of signing star players. It’s always been a key part of his formula and how he’s won wherever he’s gone. I believe he has one more future Hall of Famer on his mind: Soto. J.T. Realmuto and Kyle Schwarber’s combined $44 million comes off the Phillies’ books after 2025; Nick Castellanos’ $20 million per year comes off after 2026. There is a pathway to make a Soto deal work financially by backloading the first couple of years of a 12- to 15-year contract. And, Phillies ownership — with Dombrowski and before he arrived — has shown it will play in the deep end of free agency and dish out record deals. The Red Sox know they made a mistake when they decided not to go all-in to keep Mookie Betts, and they’ve learned from their missteps in recent years. They appear to be serious players for Soto. They have one of the best farm systems in the game and payroll flexibility going forward. Their meeting with Soto went well, as they sought to convince him that the special talent in their system will allow them to spend on free agents and trade acquisitions over the next several years. Soto was impressed with that aspect of their presentation, according to a league source briefed on the meeting. Advertisement The Blue Jays finished second in the Ohtani sweepstakes, and they have the resources to make the largest offer to Soto. They can sell him on representing a country — not just a city — but can they really convince him they’re positioned to win? The Giants have struggled over the years to land top position player free agents, but they were the highest bidder for Aaron Judge before the Yankees matched the offer and they were the highest bidder for Carlos Correa before nixing the deal over concerns about his medical records. Perhaps Buster Posey, their new president of baseball operations, might be able to convince Soto to sign with them — but this is a long shot, especially with a payroll reduction possibly on the horizon. There could not be a better script for Nationals president of baseball operations Mike Rizzo than to trade Soto to San Diego for a Herschel Walker-type prospect package and then two and a half years later, re-sign Soto. Astros owner Jim Crane has historically been opposed to long-term contracts as he allowed both Correa and George Springer to depart over the length of the deal. He did extend Jose Altuve and is working to do the same with Alex Bregman. However, I think it’s more likely he focuses on extending Kyle Tucker than landing Soto. If the late Peter Seidler hadn’t gotten ill, he might have completed a long-term contract to keep Soto in San Diego. However, that would assume Soto wasn’t focused on reaching free agency and he showed otherwise. It’s unlikely the Padres’ current ownership team would be willing to put another huge long-term contract on the books at this point, but I will never bet against A.J. Preller pulling off a surprise move.

Take a seat. The Davis family living room in their White Plains, N.Y., home is, in many ways, ordinary. Two well-worn, cream-colored sofas directly across from each other. A circular coffee table between them. Floor-to-ceiling bay windows, with decorative candles on the ledge. And the soundtrack to it all? Usually, barking, courtesy of the family Yorkshire terrier, Diggy. Advertisement “Any life decisions we make,” RJ Davis said, “yep, in that living room.” About five years ago, there was something else in that space, too: a poster board. On it, Davis, then a high school senior, had written the names of each of his four college finalists, the schools the four-star guard was considering attending. To make his choice, Davis used one of his mother Venessa’s favorite practices. “Pros and cons,” she said. “As a psychologist, it’s something you use a lot.” With Venessa and the rest of his family — father Rob, younger brother Bryce and, of course, Diggy — gathered in the living room, Davis worked through his options. When he’d finished writing, the decision was obvious: North Carolina. If he only knew then what the next four years would hold. An up-and-down freshman season that ended with Roy Williams’ shocking retirement. Then a slog of a sophomore year — until the Tar Heels turned into a rocket ship and manufactured one of the most miraculous Final Four runs in March Madness history. That led to hype entering Davis’ junior year, all of which promptly went up in flames as UNC became the first preseason No. 1 team in the modern era to miss the NCAA Tournament. And, finally, Davis’ senior season, when he sprouted into a full-blown star, posting one of the best individual campaigns in the baby blue blood’s storied history. 𝘽𝙖𝙘𝙠 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙙𝙮 𝙛𝙤𝙧 𝙢𝙤𝙧𝙚.@ariidavis_ is the 2024 ACC Preseason Player of the Year! 🔗 https://t.co/eeqt3A1Enc pic.twitter.com/pMR3OiwYtT — ACC Men's Basketball (@accmbb) October 15, 2024  This spring, at the end of April, the Davis family once again gathered in their operations center. Another decision needed to be made: Would Davis — a first-team All-American last season and one of college basketball’s most recognizable figures — return to college for a fifth season, available because of the COVID-19 pandemic, or go pro? Advertisement Because Davis is only 6 feet, the feedback he received from the NBA Draft advisory committee suggested he’d go late in the second round or undrafted entirely. But coming off his best season, what more could he prove to scouts? “I’ve always had dreams and aspirations of playing at the next level, of playing in the NBA,” he said, “and it’s like, why not right now?” Davis settled into one of the sofas. Time to talk. The first weekend of April, Davis was exactly where he’d dreamed of being: Phoenix, the site of the Final Four. Just not for the reason he’d hoped. That’s because the past two seasons, Davis had a singular motivation: a redo. Ever since North Carolina magically stormed through the NCAA Tournament in Hubert Davis’ debut season, advancing all the way to the 2022 national title game, he wanted another crack at college hoops immortality. He was 20 minutes and a 15-point halftime lead versus Kansas away from hanging a seventh NCAA championship banner in the Dean Smith Center, and then, whoosh, everything evaporated. He’s one of five active players left from that team but the only one still wearing Carolina blue. Last season, Davis unequivocally became “the guy” for the first time in his college career, especially after his three-year backcourt mate, Caleb Love, transferred to Arizona. And he did everything in his power to will the Tar Heels back to that stage while rewriting UNC’s record books. Davis went from averaging 12 points and three assists per game during his first three seasons in Chapel Hill to setting career highs in points (21.2 per game), 3-point percentage (39.8), assist-to-turnover ratio (better than 2-1) and steals (1.2). But most importantly, he led UNC to its first ACC regular-season title and No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament since 2019. A redo, suddenly, seemed like a very realistic possibility. Advertisement Then came the Sweet 16. Red-hot Alabama. And Davis, for the first time all season, went cold. He’d made at least one 3-pointer in all 36 games to that point but went 0-for-9 from deep in a 2-point loss to the Crimson Tide. “Shots I normally make,” Davis said. “Had I made one 3 …” His voice trailed off. “I kind of felt like it was my fault, just because we were so close to reaching … everything.” A week later, Davis was there in the desert as a finalist for the Naismith College Player of the Year Award, presented annually at the Final Four. Even brushing elbows with the biggest names in the sport, being recognized for his on-court excellence, Davis couldn’t shake one underlying thought: I’d rather be playing. He couldn’t bring himself to turn on any of that weekend’s Final Four games. On one hand, Davis’ jam-packed trophy case spoke for itself, including ACC Player of the Year and the Jerry West Award (given annually to the nation’s top shooting guard). He etched himself into North Carolina lore, in the same stratosphere of excellence as some of the school’s best guards, names such as Phil Ford, Ty Lawson and, yes, even Michael Jordan. By virtue of his accomplishments, his jersey is going the same place theirs did: the Smith Center rafters. But at the same time, he couldn’t stop ruminating. On the loss to Alabama. The what-ifs. Every minute detail that added up to defeat. By the time he landed back in Chapel Hill, offseason roster-building was already in full swing. Hubert Davis was holding end-of-season meetings with all his players. And Davis knew what his head coach was going to ask, whenever they sat down: So, RJ, what are you going to do? Tyler Hansbrough doesn’t play much basketball these days. “My knees,” the now-39-year-old joked. “If I’m on the court, my knees are gonna have some issues.” But Hansbrough still works out regularly, even sneaking over to the Smith Center for a lift when he can. One day in April, he was finishing a session when a familiar face approached. Advertisement “Rarely do I try to give anybody advice,” Hansbrough said, “but he actually asked me.” It makes sense why Davis sought Hansbrough out. The star guard spoke to plenty of people in his circle about what he should do: Armando Bacot, his four-year teammate and close friend; Cam Johnson, arguably UNC’s top active NBA player; Theo Pinson, who won the program’s last championship in 2017; and even Marcus Paige, now on North Carolina’s coaching staff. But nobody could offer the perspective Hansbrough could. That’s because about 15 years ago, Hansbrough was in the same bind. After his standout junior season, when the 6-foot-9 forward was the unanimous national player of the year, averaging a career-best 22.6 points and 10.2 rebounds, he, too, had a pro decision to make. Had he declared, based on feedback that then-coach Williams had gathered, Hansbrough learned he likely would’ve been a late lottery pick. But like Davis, he couldn’t get his mind off a recent NCAA Tournament heartbreak. UNC had just lost to Kansas in the 2008 Final Four, only its third defeat all season, and Hansbrough hadn’t been at his best. “Everyone thinks that whenever you get a chance to go to the NBA, you have to go. But if you believe in yourself and you think you can be a pro, one more year in college, that’s not going to derail your pro chances,” Hansbrough said. “One more year wasn’t going to change anything for me, and I felt like I could improve.” And? “And we had a chance to win a national championship.” The rest is history. Hansbrough came back, and his decision was validated when UNC did win the national title his senior season. Hansbrough was right about his pro prospects, too; the Indiana Pacers selected him 13th in the 2009 NBA Draft, the same late-lottery range that was forecast for him a year prior. Advertisement The other consideration Hansbrough mentioned to Davis? Name, image and likeness, which didn’t exist in his heyday. Davis knew NIL wouldn’t be the primary factor in his decision — “If money wasn’t involved, I’d still be playing basketball,” he said. But by virtue of his record-setting senior season, he’d earned a bevy of endorsement deals: Crocs, Verizon and one of his favorites, JBL. (Although it probably wasn’t his neighbors’ favorite; Davis’ JBL speaker may or may not have earned him a noise complaint at his apartment complex. “There’s a bass boost, so I always press that,” Davis said with a wry smile, “and the next thing you know, it’s boom.”) Hansbrough explained his thought process to Davis in UNC’s weight room and left him with one final thought. “You can listen to all the most important people in your life,” Hansbrough said, “and you can take their advice — which you should value — but you’re the only one that has to live your life.” Not long after his talk with Hansbrough, Davis returned to White Plains. “I like to go home and get grounded,” he said, “because that’s where I feel safe, and that’s where my heart lives.” Still unsure of what he’d do, the guard continued training. Most days, he met with his skills trainer, Ross Burns, at the local Life Time Fitness, and he regularly drove to Connecticut to meet with a strength and conditioning specialist. And between those sessions, it wasn’t uncommon for Davis to swing by his old high school, Archbishop Stepinac, for an early morning or late-night shooting session. “My good companions here in the building are our maintenance guys,” said Patrick Massaroni, Davis’ high school coach at Stepinac. “We make it work.” Other schools poked around Davis, his parents said, seeing if he’d consider entering the transfer portal, but UNC and the NBA were the only options he considered. Whenever he thought he’d made up his mind, that lingering memory of not winning a championship reared its head. “My mind,” he said, “was changing every day.” GO DEEPER Men’s college basketball preseason All-Americans: Sears, Flagg, Davis lead the way With the May 1 deadline for Davis to decide rapidly approaching, he had to stop waffling. So, back to the living room for final deliberations. Bryce — now a freshman at Albany — wasn’t in town, so Davis FaceTimed his younger brother and put the phone in his lap. Rob and Venessa sat across from him on the opposite sofa. Diggy scurried across the hardwood floor. Advertisement Rob and Venessa reiterated what Hansbrough said: It’s your life, and you have to live with your choice. With his mind racing, Davis stepped outside to gather his thoughts. He sat down on the family’s front porch steps and made a phone call. To Williams, the coach who recruited him to UNC in the first place. He walked around the block on the phone, and then came back to the family living room. “Whatever they talked about, he didn’t share,” Venessa said, “but it seemed to settle him, for sure.” Davis didn’t make up his mind right then, but a few days later, Davis came downstairs from his bedroom and announced he’d made his decision. Davis kept his decision close to the vest. He told his parents, obviously. Hubert Davis. But he didn’t even text his teammates. “I wanted,” he said, flashing a toothy grin, “to keep people on their toes a little bit.” So on the night of April 30, Davis set a timer on his phone for 3 a.m. and went to sleep. When the alarm went off, he woke up and posted a highlight video to Instagram with a simple two-word caption: “I’m back.” And then … Davis put his phone on “Do Not Disturb” and went back to bed. The ultimate mic drop, letting the college basketball world stir while he slept.     A post shared by RJ Davis🥷🏼 (@ariidavis_)  “It wasn’t like I was saying no to my dreams (of playing in the NBA); it’s more so, I’m putting them on pause,” Davis said. “Besides the year I had this past year, there was no greater feeling than playing in that Final Four and playing in that national championship my sophomore year. I just remember watching the ball go up, and the buzzer sound hit, and we were on the losing side. … I want to be on that winning side.” His decision finally behind him, Davis drilled down on his shooting the rest of the summer, motivated by that 0-for-9 showing against Alabama. How much of his training was done through an NBA lens, knowing he’ll likely have to play point guard because of his size? Not much. Advertisement “That’s where guys get in trouble: They start listening to critics or scouts and start thinking they’ve got to change something,” Burns said. “No. Really, just keep being the dominant, elite shooter and scorer you are — and because you’re going to have more eyeballs on you, be a facilitator.” So far, so good on that front: Through three games, Davis has 14 assists against just three turnovers. No. 10 UNC plays Hawaii on Friday and begins play Monday in the Maui Invitational. There is so much still on the table for Davis this season, but three things stand above the rest. A December rematch with Alabama as part of the ACC-SEC Challenge. The chance for Davis, if he scores the same number of points he did last season, to tie Hansbrough atop UNC’s, and the ACC’s, all-time scoring list (albeit with an extra season). “That’s hard to put into perspective,” he said. “Once I graduate and officially leave, then it’ll hit me. Like, wow, I really accomplished a lot of great things here.” And finally? Hang a banner. Complete the redo. “I’m just going to fulfill this moment,” Davis said, “and make the best of it.” (Top photo of Elon’s Nick Dorn and UNC’s RJ Davis: Grant Halverson / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,The Sudden Fall of the N.F.L.’s Best Kicker,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5933377/2024/11/20/ravens-justin-tucker-kicker-concerns/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 22:17:59 +0000","Justin Tucker has been the gold standard at his position for years. Now he’s one of the reasons Baltimore is losing games, a columnist for The Athletic writes.","NFL Citing a lack of consistency in the kicking game, Baltimore Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome announced that the team was releasing young kicker Stephen Hauschka, who hours earlier missed a 36-yard attempt against the Cleveland Browns on “Monday Night Football.” Hauschka was just 9-of-13 on field goal attempts through nine games, and all of his misses were from under 50 yards. The Ravens replaced him by signing free agent Billy Cundiff, who was working at a venture capital firm at the time. Advertisement That transaction occurred in November 2009. That’s the last time the Ravens made an in-season, performance-based change at typically one of the most volatile positions in the sport. Ravens coach John Harbaugh made clear Monday that he has no plans on making another one, even as his longtime kicker, Justin Tucker, is mired in the most difficult stretch of his 13-year career. “There’s no thought to that,” Harbaugh said. “You have to find that competition first if you’re going to be blunt about it. Where is that competition? That would be one thing. The best option right now is to get Justin back on point, because he’s fully capable of doing it. (We) certainly haven’t lost any confidence in Justin Tucker.” Harbaugh’s comments came a day after Tucker missed two kicks in an 18-16 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers at Acrisure Stadium. After entering the season as the most statistically accurate kicker in NFL history, Tucker has missed 6 of 22 attempts this year, along with a point-after try. Two of the misses came from inside 50 yards, where Tucker had made 90 percent of his kicks over his first 12 NFL seasons. His extra-point miss was just the seventh of his career. GO DEEPER 'They’ve had our number': Ravens again unable to overcome themselves in loss to Steelers “It’s certainly frustrating, especially when we know that these games come down to the wire, like this one did, that I let a couple get away,” Tucker said after Sunday’s game. “But, like I’ve said before, the only thing that we can do is just get right back to work and focus on making the most out of our next opportunity.” Considered one of the most unique weapons in the league for over a decade and the Ravens’ most reliable performer since he entered the league in 2012, Tucker — and by extension, the team’s field goal operation — has suddenly become one of the reasons Baltimore is losing games. It’s harsh and it feels uncomfortable to say or write about a guy who has been the gold standard in the sport at his position for many years, but the numbers are hard to ignore. The Ravens’ four losses have come by a total of 17 points, and Tucker missed a field goal in each of them that factored prominently in the defeats. Advertisement Tucker “needs to make kicks,” Harbaugh said after Sunday’s frustrating loss in Pittsburgh. “He knows that. He makes them in practice, and he made the long one (54-yarder) later, which was good to see. He’s still very capable. Kick them straight, we’ll be good.” Missing seven total kicks through 11 games would get plenty of other kickers a pink slip. That’s just the nature of the position in the NFL and the fine line between winning and losing. Kicking issues are omnipresent around the league, and Tucker is hardly alone among proven veterans having a tough time this season. The New York Jets have had four different kickers in as many weeks. GO DEEPER Normally 'automatic' kickers like Justin Tucker, Younghoe Koo are struggling in 2024 For the Ravens, however, kicking stability has been a constant. Matt Stover, nicknamed “Money Matt” for his accuracy, was the team’s kicker from 1996 to 2008. Cundiff replaced Hauschka in 2009 and was the team’s kicker for three seasons before his crushing late miss in the AFC Championship Game loss to the New England Patriots in January 2012. Tucker arrived on the scene as an undrafted free agent several months later, beat out Cundiff for the job and hasn’t missed a game in 13 seasons. Just the idea of making a kicking change in Baltimore seems blasphemous, given Tucker’s well-earned status. Before the two misses in Pittsburgh on Sunday, Tucker’s career field goal percentage (89.7) made him the most accurate kicker in NFL history and put him on a Hall of Fame track. His clutch kicking as a rookie in 2012 was instrumental in the Ravens winning their last Super Bowl. He’s been selected to seven Pro Bowl teams and named an All-Pro on eight occasions. Time and time again when the Ravens needed points, particularly late in games, Tucker stepped up, performed his tried-and-true pre-kick ritual and calmly delivered. He’s previously been the highest-paid kicker in the sport, and for good reason. Advertisement Tucker’s kicking brilliance, along with his charisma, outgoing personality and multitude of talents, made him one of the faces of the team and one of the most popular and recognizable athletes in Baltimore. Tucker’s No. 9 jerseys are not hard to find when you’re scanning the seating bowl at Ravens games. But this season has brought long-avoided angst in Baltimore about the performance of the kicker and led to a small but growing segment of Baltimore’s fan base to question why the organization hasn’t moved on, or at least brought in competition, for its longtime star. “Knowing the team, knowing the character of Justin, yes, his performance in the past does warrant him the benefit of the doubt, for sure,” Stover said. “But this is the NFL. It is a very immediate performance you have to have. With an objective job like being a kicker, it becomes a quick response for people to say, ‘Hey, man, what’s wrong with you? Do we need to make a change?'” Yet, Stover said, “He’s one of the best who has ever done it. Who are you going to get who you can guarantee will be better?” Bringing in another kicker in mid-November likely means either signing a well-traveled veteran who hasn’t been able to land another job or plucking someone off another team’s practice squad. It’s inconceivable at the moment that the Ravens would trust one of those options more than Tucker at a time when they fancy themselves as Super Bowl contenders. “He’s definitely our best option, and he’s going to make a lot of kicks — I really believe that,” Harbaugh said. “But it’s up to him and the guys he works with every day to make those balls go straight. Competition right now, at this time, no that’s not something we’d want for Justin.” Stover, who is in the Ravens’ Ring of Honor, still lives in the Baltimore area and has relationships with many people in the building, including Tucker. He also understands what Tucker is going through. There were times early in his career with Cleveland when he struggled and the Browns brought in competition for his job. In 1999, the Ravens claimed kicker Joe Nedney on waivers while Stover remained on the roster. Advertisement “That was brutal. He wasn’t on the practice squad. He wasn’t on IR. He was on the roster,” Stover said. “It really just comes down to performance. There’s no subjectivity. I got through it. “Justin is going through a little blip. He’s mentally strong. He’s got a great support staff around him. He’s got a head coach who totally gets it. To do it for 12 years as well as he’s done it says a lot about who he is and his character. It’s the first time he’s ever had to deal with this. I dealt with it three or four times. It was hard and it sucks. He’ll get through it.” Stover, who trains young kickers, acknowledged that he hasn’t broken down Tucker’s mechanics, but he maintains the fact that Tucker has missed all seven kicks wide left is a “good thing,” because that often points to a fixable issue. It doesn’t appear to be a leg strength issue with Tucker. Almost all of his kicks, except one, have had the necessary distance. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

There has been plenty of speculation about whether his issues are being caused by snapping and/or holding problems, but Tucker and others at the Ravens’ facility have continued to say snapper Nick Moore and holder Jordan Stout, who aren’t new at this or to the team, are doing their jobs. After Sunday’s misses, Tucker retreated to the locker room to address reporters and insisted his struggles are not a confidence issue, either. “I’m still confident I’m going to go out there and nail every single kick,” Tucker said. “Part of the way we stay confident is by continuing to work and trust the process, and I know I might sound like a broken record, but it’s a part of what brings us success — just trusting the process and then taking it one kick at a time.” Harbaugh, a former special teams coach, has a very close relationship with the kicker. Senior special teams coach Randy Brown has been with Tucker every step of his career and is considered one of the top kicking gurus in the league. Ravens assistant special teams coach Sam Koch is a former holder for Tucker and one of his closest confidants. Advertisement Stout has been holding for Tucker for three seasons, and Moore has been in the Ravens organization since 2020. The kicking battery and coaching staff have an established routine that has yielded very strong results for many years. “You try to attack everything to the utmost that we can, across the board,” Harbaugh said. “Justin is one of the aspects that we’re looking at. He’s going to get it figured out. We have coaches. We have technique. We look at the tape. He’s practicing well. He’s got to kick it straight.” (Top photo: Barry Reeger / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani wins unanimous third MVP, first in the NL after 50-50 season",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5930024/2024/11/21/dodgers-shohei-ohtani-unanimous-mvp/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 23:59:39 GMT","Ohtani and former Los Angeles Angels teammate, Mike Trout, are the only active players to have won the award at least three times.","MLB Shohei Ohtani’s latest season was defined long before Thursday night, the night the Los Angeles Dodgers superstar won his third Most Valuable Player Award in unanimous fashion and became just the second player — along with Frank Robinson — to earn the honor in both leagues. Ohtani authored one of the finest individual performances in baseball history, slugging 54 home runs and swiping 59 bases to become the first-ever member of baseball’s 50-50 club while hitting .310 with a National League-leading 1.036 OPS. Despite exclusively appearing as a designated hitter and not playing the field, the 30-year-old won out against New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor, who had an .844 OPS while hitting 33 home runs and stealing 29 bases. Ohtani outproduced him by both Baseball-Reference (9.2 to 7.0) and FanGraphs’ (9.1 to 7.8) formulas for wins above replacement. Arizona Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte was as an MVP finalist for the first time, with 36 home runs and a .932 OPS in 136 games. Advertisement Ohtani earned all 30 first-place votes from the Baseball Writers’ Association of America on his way to 420 points. Lindor finished second with 23 second-place votes and 263 points, while Marte finished third with five second-place votes and 229 points. “I’m very happy obviously to win the award,” Ohtani said through interpreter Matt Hidaka. “My goal was to be able to pitch and contribute offensively. The fact that I knew I wasn’t going to be able to pitch this season just made me focus more on my offensive game. Fortunately I was able to produce and get this award, which is very humbling.” Ohtani’s first season as a Dodger was full of upheaval. He had to endure a recovery from a second elbow ligament reconstruction, which limited him only to hitting. A flood of life circumstances — from joining his new club on a record contract to his marriage to the theft of tens of millions of dollars by his longtime interpreter — colored a year still defined by his brilliance. Things ended, fittingly, with what Ohtani sought most when deferring so much of that record contract to allow his new team to build around him: a World Series title. “He committed to us, and he wanted to play for a championship,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said in the celebration. “For it to kind of come to fruition in his first year is pretty remarkable. “What Shohei’s done to our ballclub, the Dodger fan base domestically, globally, I just don’t think you can quantify.” The Dodgers have already centered the next decade around Ohtani, from global business partnerships to how they will add stars to their already talent-laden roster. It took one year for the fruits of that vision to come to pass. Dodger Stadium was flooded with jerseys wearing Ohtani’s name. A club whittled down by injuries still managed to romp through October. Advertisement “It was definitely special as you said because we were able to win the World Series,” Ohtani said. “It will be a special moment that I will never forget just to be able to win MVP as an individual as well. But I take it as a team effort and this will motivate me even more to win again next year. We hope to win the World Series each year. “Moving forward, I do think we will have a target on our back and we will be expected to possibly do even more. But we are as a team going to continue to do the best we can and try to achieve those goals.” Thursday cemented more rare history. No player not named Ohtani had ever won a unanimous MVP so much as twice. He and Barry Bonds are the only MVPs to ever win the award, switch teams and then win it again in their first season with a new club. GO DEEPER The best Shohei Ohtani cards to collect after his historic 50/50 season He and his former Los Angeles Angels teammate, Mike Trout, are the only active players to have won the award at least three times, with only Bryce Harper and Aaron Judge joining them among active players to win the award more than once. For Ohtani, however, this one resonates for a different reason. He swapped out Angels red for Dodgers blue. And while it was his two-way excellence in the batter’s box and on the mound (and the novelty that brought) that led him to his first two MVPs and nearly won him a third while with the Angels, this year’s achievement came in a season where he didn’t throw a single pitch. His quest for a fourth already has its prologue: Ohtani is expected to return to the mound at some point in 2025, but he will do so while recovering from shoulder surgery to repair his left (non-throwing) labrum that he tore while attempting to steal a base against the New York Yankees in the World Series. Ohtani said Thursday that he has had his stitches removed and been cleared to start core and lower-body exercises. While he said it is his “goal” to return as both a hitter and pitcher for Opening Day, he said he and the Dodgers will exercise caution. Advertisement “The goal is to be ready for Opening Day,” Ohtani said. “That includes hitting and pitching. We are kind of taking our time. Obviously we want to make sure that I’m healthy first. We’re not going to rush anything. I think, discussing my shoulder, I think we are going to take a little bit more time and be conservative and we’re going to make sure I’m healthy before I step back on the mound.” (Top photo: Elsa / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The Washington Capitals star captain underwent further evaluation Thursday and was diagnosed with a left fibula fracture, the team announced. Ovechkin is expected to miss four to six weeks. Ovechkin, 39, was initially ruled week to week with a lower-body injury Tuesday following an accidental, knee-on-knee collision with Utah Hockey Club forward Jack McBain during Monday’s 6-2 victory. Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin underwent further evaluation with team doctors. It was confirmed that Ovechkin has a fracture to his left fibula and is anticipated to miss 4-6 weeks. — CapitalsPR (@CapitalsPR) November 21, 2024  Ovechkin, who is in pursuit of the NHL’s all-time goals record, has 15 goals and 10 assists in 18 games played so far this season. He sits at 868 career goals, just 27 shy of passing Wayne Gretzky’s record. That he will probably have to wait until next season to break Gretzky’s goal record. There aren’t many examples of athletes pushing 40 recovering smoothly from a lower-body injury as significant as a broken fibula. He’s no average athlete, but he is human — and he’ll need time to knock off rust, at the very least, and also work his way into game-level fitness upon returning from this injury. Advertisement With Ovechkin, the legs feed the wolf so to speak. He’s a brute force of a goal scorer, powering shots with his lower body. He’s appeared to be skating like a player at least five years younger this season — does that change when he returns from a broken bone? There’s no way to answer that question now. Still, even if he returns by early 2025, he’ll likely need a hot streak to pass Gretzky this season. His chance of the goal record was destined to become the story of the second half of this season — one that perhaps could generate interest the NHL has not seen, at least in the United States, in many years. He’s too close to the record not to get it eventually. But it looked like he might knock it off on his way to an improbable 50-goal season, if not a run at a fourth Hart Trophy. This was shaping up as a legacy-defining season for an all-time icon behind whom the NHL could potentially break into the mainstream sports conversation. All of that may be off the table because of this injury. — Rob Rossi, NHL senior writer The Capitals surprised many people by making the playoffs last season — and they did so largely in part to Ovechkin finding his scoring groove in the second half. Their emergence this season as a seeming dark horse Cup contender coincided with Ovechkin’s scoring surge. It was as if an improved roster was also being fueled by its captain’s finishing form. There’s no way to overstate how big a blow losing Ovechkin is to the Capitals, though. Even when he’s not scoring, if he’s on the ice, he’s a threat who draws opponents’ top defensive pairings and often best defensive forwards. And on the power play, where he’s arguably the most dangerous weapon the NHL has known, Ovechkin is irreplaceable. The Capitals are more than just Ovechkin, but not having him for at least a month — and it’s totally unknown how he’ll look when he does return — is as significant an obstacle as any team has faced this season. — Rossi (Photo: Patrick Smith / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Michigan flips QB Bryce Underwood — No. 1 player in 2025 class — from LSU,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5939109/2024/11/21/bryce-underwood-michigan-lsu-recruiting/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 23:32:35 GMT",Underwood will be the highest-rated quarterback to sign with Michigan in the modern recruiting era.,"NCAAF Bryce Underwood, a five-star quarterback from Belleville, Mich., and the No. 1 prospect in the 247Sports Composite, has flipped his commitment from LSU to Michigan. Underwood immediately becomes a face-of-the-program recruit for Michigan, which is 5-5 in Sherrone Moore’s first season. As the No. 1 quarterback in his class, Underwood is expected to command an NIL deal worth at least $5 million, according to On3. Michigan made a concerted push to flip his commitment in recent weeks, signaling a shift in the program’s NIL philosophy under Moore. Advertisement Landing Underwood is by far the biggest coup of the class and one of Michigan’s biggest recruiting wins in years. Underwood will be the highest-rated quarterback to sign with Michigan in the modern recruiting era (dating back to 2002) and the second player ranked No. 1 in his class to do so, joining Rashan Gary from the Class of 2016.     A post shared by Bryce Underwood (@19bryce.__)  Jim Harbaugh’s reluctance to engage in bidding wars for recruits was one reason Michigan was perceived as a long shot in Underwood’s recruitment. Michigan wasn’t viewed as a serious player in the Underwood sweepstakes when he committed to LSU in January, and Belleville coach Calvin Norman told The Athletic in June that there would be no last-minute change of heart from Underwood. “That’s not gonna happen,” Norman said. Michigan ramped up its pursuit of Underwood in recent weeks, backed by a significant allocation of NIL resources. While the Wolverines have experienced a downturn on the field after last season’s national championship run, their 2025 recruiting class now sits at No. 9 in the composite rankings. “I think they understand the vision that we explain to them and what this is going to be like,” Moore said of players considering Michigan. “It’s been pretty positive. We’ve gotten some good commitments, some good guys to join the family, and we’re looking to continue that trend.” The state of Michigan has produced a string of elite quarterback prospects in recent years, including Notre Dame’s CJ Carr and Dante Moore, now at Oregon. After missing out on Carr and Moore, the Wolverines have staked a big part of their future on Underwood, a 6-foot-4 prodigy with the tools to be a future franchise quarterback in the NFL. “He’s a more modernized Randall Cunningham mixed with Josh Allen,” Donovan Dooley, Underwood’s QB coach, told The Athletic in 2023. “He’s a unicorn.” Advertisement J.J. McCarthy’s departure for the NFL left a hole at quarterback that became glaring during Moore’s first season. Michigan had a commitment from four-star quarterback Carter Smith for 2025, but Smith decommitted after Michigan went all in with Underwood. Given the struggles of Davis Warren and Alex Orji this season, Underwood will be a candidate to start immediately in 2025, though he could have competition from redshirt freshman Jadyn Davis and any quarterback Michigan elects to pursue in the transfer portal. The Tigers may be in trouble. Underwood had been committed to LSU since January, and it’s typical for college programs to shut down quarterback recruiting once they have their guy in place. LSU now has no quarterback committed in its class with less than two weeks until the start of the early signing period. Additionally, Brian Kelly and his staff are now at risk of losing other top prospects. It was no secret that the Tigers had built their class around Underwood, and it wouldn’t be surprising if some of the other skill players jumped ship. On3 has already projected that four-star wide receiver Derek Meadows, who plays at Las Vegas Bishop Gorman, will follow suit and flip from LSU to Michigan. Kelly, whose team is just 6-4 this season, may now have to turn to the portal to fill some of these holes.

Judge earned his second American League MVP award, this one unanimously, on Thursday night, claiming it after posting an astounding 218 wRC+, the highest ever recorded by a right-handed hitter in either league. Judge received all 30 first-place votes from the Baseball Writers’ Association of America to finish with 420 points, well ahead of second-place Kansas City Royals shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. (270 points). Judge’s teammate Juan Soto (229 points) finished third. Advertisement Judge, who also won the honor when he hit an AL-record 62 home runs in 2022, no-showed a scheduled conference call with members of the BBWAA after the award announcement. He appeared on MLB Network and ESPN. Judge became the seventh player in Yankees history to win multiple MVPs, joining Alex Rodriguez, Mickey Mantle (three times), Roger Maris, Yogi Berra (three times), Joe DiMaggio (three times) and Lou Gehrig. “It’s funny. I was talking to (Bryce) Harper a lot this season, and I was telling him, ‘I’m going to try to catch up to you with these MVPs here, man,’” Judge said on MLB Network, referring to Harper’s two MVP awards. “But he’s saying hopefully he could stay a few ahead of me, which I think he’ll do, man. It means a lot. A lot of the hard work in the offseason, during the season, the ups and downs throughout it. The constant support from my teammates, the fans in New York, just everybody to help me get to this spot.” Judge finished the 2024 season with a majors-leading 58 home runs and 144 RBIs, and a slash line of .322/.458/.701. His 11.2 fWAR ranked as the 10th-best single-season performance in franchise history and the 19th-best of all time. The 6-foot-7 center fielder was so dominant that his .701 slugging percentage was higher than the OPS of 11 teams. “It’s greatness right in front of us,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said in September while describing Judge. GO DEEPER The best Aaron Judge trading cards to collect Boston Red Sox manager Alex Cora in September called Judge’s performance “the best version” of his nine-year career. Judge led MLB in home runs, RBIs, walk rate, ISO, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, wOBA, wRC+, and fWAR. The campaign was statistically better overall than his 2022. He did it while hitting behind Soto, who put up a career year with 41 home runs and is poised to land one of the biggest contracts in free-agent history this winter. Advertisement Asked on MLB Network if it mattered to him that he won MVP unanimously, Judge said, “No, not really. I appreciate all the votes, all the support. If you win it, you win it. But, honestly, I wouldn’t be in this position without my teammates, all the coaching we had this year. It’s such a blessing. I’ve got to thank God every day for this opportunity to be here, to wear pinstripes and to do it in New York.” Judge also led MLB in Statcast’s run value metric against four-seam fastballs, sinkers and sweepers. Despite facing the highest volume of sweepers among all hitters, he slugged an incredible .816 against the pitch. Over the past two seasons, pitchers have frequently attacked Judge with sliders, hoping he would chase pitches off the plate. In 2024, Judge also faced the most sliders of his career. He responded with a remarkable .984 OPS against all types of sliders. Judge is a perfectionist, constantly seeking ways to refine even the smallest aspects of his game as evidenced by the tweaks he made to his swing this season.

Advertisement “It was just a dance that everyone’s doing,” Pulisic said after confirming it had indeed been the ‘Trump Dance’. “He’s the one who created it. I just thought it was funny … It’s not a political dance. It was just for fun. I saw a bunch of people do it and I thought it was funny, so I enjoyed it. I hope some people did, at least.” Christian Pulisic wasn't the only USMNT player that hit the Trump dance after his goal against Jamaica.  (via @awnaveed11) pic.twitter.com/1SxBGVbNJq — USMNT Only (@usmntonly) November 19, 2024  The ‘Trump Dance’ has become a viral trend after being widely used by Trump himself on the presidential election campaign trail. That has now spread to sports, with National Football League player Nick Bosa celebrating a sack using the dance, and most recently combat sports fighter Jon Jones performing it after knocking out his opponent, in front of a watching Trump. But Howard, widely-considered among the greatest players in the history of American men’s soccer, criticised Pulisic, calling into question his awareness surrounding the political climate in the United States following the U.S. election, where Trump earned a second term by roundly defeating Democratic challenger and current Vice President Kamala Harris. “Doing a dance that mimics (U.S. president-elect) Donald Trump is stupid,” Howard wrote in the UK’s Daily Mail. “Why? Because, whether it’s the president of the United States or my neighbor down the street, I would never back someone who I believe is racist. I wouldn’t glorify that. I wouldn’t do it for anything.” Referring to Pulisic’s insistence that the dance was not a “political” act, Howard said: “That explanation doesn’t wash. You cannot have it both ways. You’re on one side of this or the other. If you are bold enough to publicly make a statement, I don’t have a problem with that. But own it.” Advertisement Howard also attacked the U.S. Soccer Federation, suggesting that it needed to do a better job of educating its players on the ramifications of their actions. The former Everton keeper also stated that he felt some athletes were ignoring problematic policies and political leanings in order to maximize their earnings. “Athletes know they can protect their assets by supporting a certain political party,” wrote Howard. “I have a lot of friends who are very wealthy and they sold their soul to protect their money. “Support whoever you want, for whatever reason you like. But my message to Pulisic, Bosa, Jones and Co? Own it.” U.S. Soccer declined to comment on Howard’s remarks. President-elect Trump’s office has been approached for comment.

Forest head coach Nuno Espirito Santo said the midfielder is still struggling with the foot injury he sustained against Crystal Palace last month. Anderson, 22, started the subsequent game against Leicester City and came off the bench in the last two Forest fixtures, against West Ham United and Newcastle United. Advertisement “We took advantage of the international break to try to manage some players who were struggling, and Elliot was one of them. Let’s see how he is tomorrow. But for now, we still have to assess him,” said Nuno at his pre-match press conference earlier on Thursday. The Portuguese coach said that, otherwise, Forest’s international players had all — with the exception of Paraguay international Ramon Sosa, who was yet to fly back to England — arrived back in Nottingham without injury issues. But both Murillo and Chris Wood will be given more rest ahead of the weekend, having travelled half way around the world to join up with Brazil and New Zealand. Murillo did not get any game time as Brazil drew 1-1 both in Venezuela and at home to Uruguay. But Wood scored twice in an 8-1 win over Vanuatu and a hat-trick as New Zealand won in Samoa. Nuno says the training levels of all the international players — and particularly Murillo and Wood — will be monitored to ensure they get as much rest as possible ahead of the weekend. “We will give them more time to rest. This is what we believe is better. We will not immediately try to prepare them. We will have players with jetlag and we have to manage that. Our approach is always that doing less is more,” said Nuno. (Mike Egerton/PA Images via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,3 reasons why Miami Heat's defense has improved since a slow start,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5937692/2024/11/21/heat-defense-video-bam-adebayo/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 22:01:24 GMT",How has Miami's defense improved in recent games? Here's a look at some film.,"NBA An up-and-down start to the Miami Heat’s season is balancing out as the team restores its defensive identity. At 6-7, Miami sits one game under .500 and entered Thursday ranked fifth in the East. The Heat don’t play again until the Dallas Mavericks visit on Sunday. Considering the rightful frustrations behind a few late-game miscues and blown leads, things could be worse — and they’ve already started improving. Advertisement On the surface, Miami’s 11th-ranked defense seems standard, but it had a rough start to the season as head coach Erik Spoelstra assessed his ideal lineups. After losing 135-122 to the Denver Nuggets on Nov. 8, the Heat ranked only 20th in points allowed per 100 possessions while allowing opponents to corral more than half of the available rebound opportunities. That doesn’t compute for a Spo-coached squad, so it’s only right Miami has since returned to the drawing board and reassessed a few things. Let’s examine the most vital differences in Miami’s defense since Nov. 10. Since that Denver loss, Haywood Highsmith has been a fixture in the Heat starting lineup. Miami has three wins in that span, during which the 27-year-old has averaged nearly eight points while shooting 51.9 percent overall and 50 percent from deep. But since we’re discussing defense, let’s discuss the buckets he limits. He’s averaging a team-high 1.8 steals and 5.4 deflections per game, trailing only Atlanta’s Dyson Daniels (6.0) for the NBA lead in that span. Highsmith often is tasked with guarding an opponent’s best scorer, which allows Bam Adebayo and Jimmy Butler to be more defensively versatile. Opponents are shooting only 43.8 percent on nearly 13 shot attempts when guarded by Highsmith, according to NBA.com’s tracking data. Highsmith played a vital role in the Heat holding Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards to a season-worst 8-of-24 shooting (including a 4-of-14 mark from deep) on Nov. 10. Highsmith gave Minnesota’s leading man nothing but bad options whenever they matched up, using hard closeouts or active hands in helping teammates. In Miami’s last five games, its opponents are shooting far better when Haywood is on the bench (50.6 percent) than when he’s playing (43.6 percent), per NBA.com. “It’s fun for sure,” Highsmith said. “I like to guard guys and make it hard for them to score. These are superstar, All-Star-type players, so it says a lot about Spo trusting in me to put me on those guys. And I’m all about defense, so I accept the challenge. There’s no better feeling for me than just getting a stop.” Advertisement Few things speak more to Miami’s identity than a bench contributor’s willingness to step in at a moment’s notice. Players of this ilk, like Dru Smith, Alec Burks and Kevin Love, have been key to the Heat enjoying three wins in the last five games. Smith has played only 52 minutes this season, but he’s held opponents to just 32 percent shooting in his appearances. Against the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday, Burks held Philly scorers to 2-of-7 shooting after not playing since Nov. 6. The 76ers scored just 48.6 points per 100 possessions in the pair’s 17 minutes together, and that can give Spoelstra more perimeter options to keep sharpening Miami’s defense. Smith, in particular, is adept at being active on defense without fouling. He registered two steals in about a minute on Monday, both leading to transition opportunities for Tyler Herro. On the season, Miami ranks fourth among all teams with 18.7 deflections per game and ninth in fast-break points (17.1). Since Nov. 10, only the Houston Rockets (22.3) have averaged more of the latter than the Heat (21.0). Love, meanwhile, has helped Miami improve its rebounding since becoming a rotation fixture in recent games. The 36-year-old trails only Adebayo for the team lead in rebounds since Nov. 10. He’s played alongside Adebayo for 47 minutes in that span, during which the Heat have outscored teams by 4.2 points per 100 possessions. Love’s size helps further bolster Miami’s frontcourt and gives the Heat a sound anchor whenever Adebayo isn’t on the court. In the clip below against the Indiana Pacers, Love was caught on an island when guarding a pick-and-roll, but his footwork and body control allowed him to contest T.J. McConnell’s drive without fouling. Not to doubt Spoelstra, but there is no way for the Heat to craft a credible defense without its team captain as a consistent anchor. During this turnaround, Adebayo has refused to allow Miami’s defense to bottom out after its slow start. In the team’s last five games, the five-time All-Defense selection has played 193 out of a possible 245 minutes. The team’s defensive efficiency falls off a cliff when he’s sat (122.1 points allowed per 100 possessions, would undoubtedly rank last over a season) compared to his time on the court (101.3, would rank first), because Adebayo often provides good things to Miami. In this example below, as Highsmith guarded Joel Embiid on the perimeter, Adebayo blitzed with defensive help to force a bad pass that Butler finished with a takeaway. Adebayo’s comfort with playing away from the rim provides the Heat with many ways to confuse opponents. Fortunately for the Heat, their defensive anchor also can spoil offenses’ fun when left on an island, thanks to his timing, quick feet and active hands. Adebayo finished this win over the Pacers with a season-high five steals, one shy of his career high. Later in the game, Adebayo gave Pacers forward Obi Toppin fits as Toppin tried to wiggle for a basket. Adebayo closed out on Toppin’s 3-point attempt before backtracking to impede a lob attempt in the clip below. Over the last five games, Adebayo is holding opposing scorers to 37.9 percent shooting. He’s the center of Miami’s defensive resurgence in recent games — and will need to continue to be. If the Heat have any ambition of climbing the Eastern Conference standings as the season progresses, it will begin on defense.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Flyers stock watch: Who’s trending up, who’s trending down after 20 games?",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938288/2024/11/21/flyers-stock-watch-players-analysis/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 21:53:14 GMT","It's as good a time as any to take a broader look at the Flyers, who hit the 20-game mark with a somewhat disappointing 8-10-2 record.","NHL It’s as good a time as any to take a broader look at the Philadelphia Flyers, who hit the 20-game mark (10 at home, 10 on the road) with a somewhat disappointing 8-10-2 record and in sixth place in the Metropolitan Division, which has already seemed to separate itself into four teams that can contend for a Stanley Cup and four that are either rebuilding or have real issues. Advertisement Let’s get right to it. The two longtime pals have simply been the Flyers’ two best players this season. Travis Sanheim has anchored the defense group, which has endured a number of early-season injuries, while Travis Konecny has been the most consistent and dangerous forward. Sanheim is probably the Flyers’ MVP at the quarter point, contributing at both ends of the ice and playing the best hockey of his career. He’s a plus-2 on a team that’s been outscored by 17 at five-on-five. He’s third in the league in ice time with 25:33 per game, despite getting hardly any power-play time. Prior to Wednesday’s game, Sanheim eclipsed 30 minutes in three of the Flyers’ previous five games as the team continues to wait for others to get back into the lineup. All 12 of Sanheim’s points have come at even strength, putting him just one behind league co-leaders Alex Pietrangelo, Cale Makar and Owen Power. It was notable that when Rod Brind’Amour was asked before Wednesday’s game what the Flyers were doing differently from the last time they faced the Hurricanes just two weeks ago, he told reporters: “Sanheim is in the rush every play, like an old Bobby Orr back there from back in the day, which is fun to watch. … So, we’ve got to be aware of that guy.” Konecny remains the heartbeat of the team and is on a path toward his best season yet. He’s averaging more than a point per game (23 in 20 games), is on pace for 45 goals (11 so far), and leads the Flyers with five power-play goals. We’ll see how his eight-year contract that kicks in next season ages over time, but Konecny sure isn’t slowing down. Just the opposite. While Konecny is pulling his weight and Matvei Michkov is still producing through some inevitable rookie growing pains, every other scoring forward has been disappointing so far. Owen Tippett, Joel Farabee, Tyson Foerster and Bobby Brink, four young wingers with upside that the organization was hoping would take another step, have just 14 goals in a combined 76 games. Advertisement There have been some signs that they’re all working their way out of early season slumps. Three of Tippett’s four goals have come this month and he’s had the puck on his stick more often, Farabee has had a number of scoring chances lately and has been on the receiving end of some compliments from John Tortorella, and Foerster is starting to get back to playing hard along the wall and winning his battles, which he wasn’t doing much of earlier — a demotion to the fourth line seems to have gotten his attention. But the overall consistency from this group hasn’t been there. Yes, the power play has hit a bit of a snag lately, going just 2-for-20 in the last seven games. But losing both quarterbacks in Jamie Drysdale and Emil Andrae has predictably thrown it off course, while other players have been shuffled in and out of the two units lately, too. The Flyers sit 20th in the NHL in power-play percentage (16.9 percent), which is still more than three percentage points higher than they averaged from 2021-22 through last season. Once they get all their pieces back, and assuming Michkov becomes a more dangerous threat offensively as the season moves along, they could very well end up in the top half of the league. The penalty kill has simply picked up where it left off last season, sitting in fourth place in the league at 86.6 percent. The Flyers have just one shorthanded goal, but are still getting chances the other way: According to Natural Stat Trick, they are generating 9.69 scoring chances per 60 minutes on the penalty kill, third in the league. The good news on Wednesday is that Ryan Poehling’s shot from distance beat Pyotr Kochetkov in the second period, tying the game at 1-1. It was Poehling’s first goal of the season, and just the second from a Flyers center since Oct. 26 (Morgan Frost had the other on Nov. 5). Advertisement The bad news is that Poehling’s turnover later in the game helped to generate what turned out to be the game-winning goal, while Scott Laughton’s misplay early in the first period that Carolina also capitalized on earned the alternate captain some lengthy time on the bench. The Flyers just don’t have a high-end, play-driving center on the roster, while the guy that has the best chance to develop into one, Frost, has been a healthy scratch for four of the last five games. Is it time yet for general manager Daniel Brière to get a little aggressive to try and find one? Is it worth circling back to the Ducks to gauge interest in and maybe even take a chance on Trevor Zegras, perhaps? Zegras is only signed through next season, so even if the Flyers acquired him they wouldn’t be committed to him long-term. It just feels like it’s time for Brière to try something different here. It was unfortunate timing for Andrae when he got hurt late in last Saturday’s win over the Sabres, as he was earning big minutes and showing that he might be ready to stick around the NHL full-time. Fortunately for him and the team, Andrae was on the ice on Wednesday, suggesting he could be back soon. He’s second on the Flyers in expected goals share (55.6 percent), but just watching him (and speaking with him) it was becoming evident he has a growing confidence with and without the puck. Frankly, Andrae is turning into the player the Flyers were hoping Drysdale (1 goal, 2 assists in 15 games) would become. It’s much, much too early to write off Drysdale, who it seems was rushed into the NHL by the Ducks which may have stunted his development. But he’s going to be under the microscope when he returns from his upper-body injury, because the Flyers may not want to dress all of Andrae, York and Drysdale in the same games for fear of being too small on their back end. (For his part, Tortorella said he’s not afraid of doing this when asked a week ago. We’ll see.) Don’t blame Ersson for the Flyers being fourth from the bottom of the league in team goals-against average (3.50) through Wednesday’s games. The Flyers’ No. 1 goalie has been generally solid all season, with a 2.70 GAA and .902 save percentage in 11 games. He just seemed to be hitting his stride, too, before coming out of the lineup with what’s believed to be a groin injury: in his last five appearances, Ersson stopped 109 of 116 shots for a .940 save percentage in 257 minutes, with a 3-0-1 mark. Both Ersson and Tortorella mentioned early in the season when the goalie’s stat line wasn’t so hot that they believed he was playing better than the numbers suggested. That proved to be the case, because when the Flyers finally got some structure back in their game, Ersson was outstanding. Advertisement The 25-year-old still has an outside chance to make Team Sweden for the upcoming 4 Nations tournament, although Minnesota’s Filip Gustavsson is probably the odds-on favorite to be the No. 3 behind Jacob Markstrom and Linus Ullmark. But, considering his injury has occurred twice in a short period of time, he may be better off sitting it out anyway. The Flyers need him healthy if they’re going to have any chance at hanging around the playoff race due to their mishandling of the backup goalie position (see below). Yes, they’ve been a bit better lately, but there’s still a tremendous amount of uncertainty with both Ivan Fedotov and Aleksei Kolosov. It’s not a stretch to suggest neither of them would be on any other NHL team’s roster at the moment. Their combined numbers are awful: 3-8-0, with an .874 save percentage and 3.70 goals-against average. Their numbers are nearly identical (Fedotov’s .875 save percentage is slightly better than Kolosov’s .872, while his GAA of 3.69 is also just a tad better than Kolosov’s 3.71). Cal Petersen seems to be an afterthought in the organization at the moment, but he would have done better than that. If there’s reason for hope it probably lies more with Fedotov, who won three straight starts and looked to be settling in before he allowed a backbreaking soft third-period goal on Wednesday in the Flyers’ 4-1 loss to Carolina. He made some decent saves before that — his stop on Jack Roslovic in the first period on a two-on-none break seemed to give the Flyers energy at the time — but his overall body of work this season has still been subpar. Kolosov should return to the AHL when Ersson recovers. It’s not fair to Fedotov to have to share the net with him, and it’s not a good message to other players currently on the Phantoms who are working hard to make the leap, either. If he doesn’t want to play in Lehigh Valley, the Flyers should simply cut ties with him.

Advertisement The system won’t be installed in every spring ballpark, but all teams will have opportunities to play with it. MLB has tested two types of ABS in the minors: one that was used by umpires on every pitch, and another where teams had either two or three challenges per game. The league expects to give teams two challenges per game in spring training. At the end of 2024 in the minors, MLB started testing two challenges rather than three, and it wants to continue looking at that setup. Teams retain the challenge when they are correct, and so three challenges could amount to a higher volume of in-game stoppages.

And we’re gonna have to sort through both of those.” Manfred also has to collectively bargain a new contract with major league umpires, whose contract expired after the season, and the automated strike zone is a part of that negotiation. “We’re going to have to work through that issue as well,” Manfred said.

Alexander suffered the initial injury late in the Packers’ win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 8 and missed Green Bay’s Week 9 game against the Detroit Lions. The Packers had a Week 10 bye and Alexander played only 10 defensive snaps against the Chicago Bears last Sunday before leaving the game and not returning. He practiced in a limited capacity each day last week and was listed as questionable for the game before playing. Advertisement Coach Matt LaFleur said Monday that Alexander was on a pitch count entering Sunday’s game, anyway, but that Alexander felt like he couldn’t play more than 10 snaps. “I stayed here the whole bye week trying to hopefully come back and make an impact for the team,” Alexander said. “It was a game-time decision at that, so we didn’t know … until, you know, a few minutes before the game if I would play or not. “I just tried to give it a go … I went out there and s–t, all I could really give was 10 plays and then it — I felt something. If you know how (posterior cruciate ligaments) work, it don’t just get done in three weeks, so it just needed more time. I reaggravated it going back out there and only doing 10 plays, so now we just trying to get my knee back right.” LIVE: Head Coach Matt LaFleur meets with the media 🎙️  https://t.co/iAscgcjASx — Green Bay Packers (@packers) November 21, 2024  Alexander, a second-team All-Pro in 2020 and 2022, was asked if he could return to that form at some point in the second half of this season. “Yessir. Oh, heck yeah. Of course,” he said. “You know, I just need more than 21 days of non-contact. It just needed more time because to take three weeks off and not do much, that still wasn’t enough.” So what exactly is he looking at for a return timetable? “I don’t know,” Alexander said. “I got a meeting today with everybody, so we gon’ kinda go and see what’s the best decision, so that’s all.” Alexander has missed 27 of a potential 61 regular-season games since the start of the 2021 season, with 26 of those due to various injuries. He missed 13 games with a shoulder injury in 2021, one game with a groin injury in 2022 and then three games with a back injury in 2023. Alexander missed Weeks 3 and 4 last season with the back injury and knew it was hurting entering a Week 5 game against former teammate Davante Adams and the Raiders, but, as Alexander said Thursday, he “had to play” and did so for all 64 defensive snaps in Las Vegas. He missed Week 6 with the same back injury. Alexander then missed six games later in the season with a shoulder injury, one while suspended, two more this season with a groin injury and now one and counting with his PCL injury. Advertisement Alexander has been an All-Pro in the last two seasons he’s played at least 15 games, but staying on the field has been a challenge for the $21 million-per-year cornerback who signed that then-record four-year extension in the 2022 offseason. “You’re talking about an elite player at his position, so it definitely is tough when he’s not out there,” LaFleur said. “That’s the case for a lot of teams in this league, missing players, and you’ve got to have the next guy step up, be ready to go and can never let that standard slip.” Edgerrin Cooper a new DNP at practice, which is indoors today.

He’s going to be Ja all the time, so his character never changes. He always has that energetic energy that we need and it’s good for all of us.” Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

In Alexander’s place, Green Bay’s two starting outside cornerbacks will likely be Keisean Nixon and Carrington Valentine, who played 64 defensive snaps against the Bears to Eric Stokes’ four. Valentine played a pivotal role in the Packers’ resurgence last season after they traded Rasul Douglas and while Alexander and Stokes were sidelined. Valentine hadn’t played more than 61 percent of the defensive snaps in a game this season before playing 89 percent last Sunday. Advertisement “It was good to get back out there, feel some things out, make some plays in the run game and stuff like that,” said Valentine, who missed Weeks 3 and 4 this season with an ankle injury after rotating with Stokes in Week 2. “It felt good and something to build off of. … I feel like the confidence for me never left, no matter what the injury was.” (Photo: Kevin Sabitus / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Daniel Jones bids farewell to Giants as time in N.Y. nears end: ‘Wish I could have done more’,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938588/2024/11/21/giants-daniel-jones-addresses-benching-bids-farewell/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 21:27:23 GMT",Daniel Jones confirmed that his $23 million injury guarantee was a contributing factor to the Giants' decision.,"NFL Giants quarterback Daniel Jones spoke to the media after Thursday’s practice, delivering an apparent farewell address after six seasons with the team. Jones was benched on Monday in favor of Tommy DeVito as the last-place Giants enter Week 12 at 2-8. Jones spent a portion of Thursday’s session wearing a red scout team jersey and afterward took accountability for his part in leading just one winning season since his arrival in 2019. Advertisement “The opportunity to play for the New York Giants was truly a dream come true. I’m extremely grateful to the Mara and Tisch families for the chance to play here,” Jones said. “No one wanted to win more games worse than me. I gave everything I had on the field and in preparation. Of course, this season has been disappointing for all and of course, I wish I could have done more. I’m 100% accountable for my part. I did not play well enough, consistently enough to help the team get (good) results.” Jones, currently in the second season of the four-year, $160 million contract extension signed in 2022, acknowledged that he’s “still processing” whether he’ll remain with the team for the rest of the season. GO DEEPER The Daniel Jones era is over. Giants bench QB after frustrating 6-year run The 27-year-old did confirm, though, that his $23 million injury guarantee contributed to the team’s decision to sit him. “I want to play. I want to be on the field. I tried to do as much as I could to make that possible and create a situation where we were both comfortable,” Jones said when asked whether he considered waiving the guarantee. “Unfortunate business side of the game.” With the expectation that he has played his final snap in a Giants uniform, Jones expressed excitement over his next opportunity. “I know there’s a lot of good football in front of me,” he said. Still, Jones was visibly emotional at points, particularly when thanking his teammates, coaches, staffers and fans. “To all the fans, I have deep respect and appreciation for your passion and love for the Giants. The fans are a huge part of what makes playing for the Giants so special.” It was strange to see Jones in a red scout-team pinnie lining up at safety during a walk-through period early in Thursday’s practice. But that’s the quarterback’s new reality, as he has dropped to fourth on the depth chart after the Giants benched him this week. Advertisement The Giants are essentially putting Jones in bubble wrap to avoid risking the $23 million injury guarantee in his contract, so he’s not participating in any live periods of practice. But Jones stood in at safety as the offensive line and quarterbacks prepped for the blitzes they’ll see from the Buccaneers on Sunday. Jones was joined on the ragtag scout team defense by practice squad offensive linemen and members of the coaching staff. That figures to be the extent of Jones’ practice participation for the final seven weeks of the season, unless he and the team reach an agreement to send him home. – Dan Duggan, Giants senior writer (Photo: Luke Hales / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

We can chalk that up to the enormity of the transfer portal and a few high-profile coaching changes that have made for strange sights — Mark Pope has Kentucky buzzing, John Calipari is at Arkansas, Eric Musselman is in Southern California and Tony Bennett is hopefully enjoying a few well-earned beach cocktails with those decorative umbrellas. Advertisement This weekend’s slate features an absolute banger in Duke-Arizona, plus some compelling early-season tournament action in West Virginia and the Bahamas. Here’s your guide to the next few days in college hoops. You can stream college basketball on Fubo (try for free). Time: Friday, 10:30 p.m. ET
TV: ESPN2 The preeminent matchup of this weekend’s slate yields two top teams recovering from high-profile losses. Duke (3-1) dropped a thriller to Kentucky, with freshman phenom Cooper Flagg turning the ball over in consecutive clutch possessions. Arizona (3-1) fell to Wisconsin, marking the Wildcats’ first November loss under coach Tommy Lloyd, who has held the position since 2021. Last weekend, the Wildcats were burned by the Badgers via the 3-ball. Arizona shot below 20 percent behind the arc, while Wisconsin exceeded 40 percent. Fifth-year guard Caleb Love needs to be much better. He enters Friday’s contest with a ghastly 43.5 true shooting percentage on a high usage rate. Junior Jaden Bradley has been significantly better. Bradley is shooting 50 percent from the field and has more than doubled last season’s scoring output to 14.7 points per game. Arizona isn’t fully playing to its offensive potential, and the 3-point defense may be cause for concern down the stretch, but this looks to be a dominant team off the glass, sitting second in the country in total rebounding. The fulcrum is 6-foot-8 Tobe Awaka. After two years of limited playing time at Tennessee, he looks comfortable in Tucson. He comes in averaging a double-double and leads the Big 12 in offensive boards. Arizona also plays fast — leading all major conference teams in adjusted possessions per 40 minutes. Duke’s duo of Flagg and Kon Knueppel commands attention, but this is a well-rounded squad under coach Jon Scheyer. Khaman Maluach, a 7-foot-2 freshman from South Sudan, gives the team a rim-runner and shot-blocker. In the Kentucky loss, Maluach was a perfect 5-for-5 from the field, and he blocked three shots in just 23 minutes of playing time. Australian junior Tyrese Proctor is the only returning three-year starter, and his presence can steady a group led by two freshmen. Advertisement Even as they adjust to a faster and more physical college game, Flagg and Knueppel are already generating sizable highlight reels. The latter is letting it fly, with more than half of his shot attempts coming on the long ball. He is on pace to attempt the most 3-pointers in a Duke season since Cam Reddish in 2018-19. Flagg, of course, is the presumed No. 1 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft. His game still has a few blemishes, especially around the perimeter — he’s 17 years old — but he’s already slicing into the paint and dunking with authority. Both teams are in the top 15 in adjusted offensive rating. This game should make for a solid watch with a high ceiling for pure entertainment. Memorable Matchup: Arizona 72, Duke 82, 2001 NCAA championship game — Mike Krzyzewski notched his third national title with the win. Four Blue Devils scored in double-digits. Mike Dunleavy Jr. had 21 points and shot 5-of-9 from behind the arc. Carlos Boozer added 12 points and 12 rebounds off the bench. The Wildcats were led by Loren Woods, who had 22 points, 11 boards and four blocks. This game ultimately yielded two NBA All-Stars (Boozer and Gilbert Arenas) and four additional lottery draft picks (Dunleavy Jr., Jay Williams, Shane Battier and Richard Jefferson). Nothing says November college basketball like a cool but totally random off-site tournament. This year’s Baha Mar Championship in Nassau features three ranked teams and a fourth premier program in Virginia. Thursday’s two winners will play each other on Friday in the championship (and Thursday’s two losers will also play each other on Friday). Let’s see what’s on tap. Time: Thursday, 7 p.m. ET
TV: CBSSN Baylor (3-1) and St. John’s (4-0) should both be fixtures in the national conversation this season. After an opening night thumping from Gonzaga, this Baylor outfit is building some momentum, besting Arkansas by five points and then dominating two lesser opponents. Freshman guard V.J. Edgecombe is a top prospect for next spring’s NBA Draft and a Bahamian national. He’s still seeking consistency on his jumper, coming into this weekend shooting 36.6 percent from the field and a paltry 17.6 percent on 3-pointers. Coach Scott Drew’s group is fifth in the nation in adjusted offensive rating. Imagine how scary this team will look with Edgecombe settled in. Nicaraguan forward Norchad Omier is a rebounding machine, with double-digit rebounding averages in all five seasons across three programs (Arkansas State, Miami and Baylor). Since winning it all in 2021, Baylor has been vanquished in the second round of the last three NCAA Tournaments. The Bears harbor high hopes for this spring. Advertisement St. John’s, meanwhile, is enjoying a much-needed program renaissance and enters rated 16th by KenPom. St. John’s doesn’t rely on the 3-point shot like the Bears, but it makes its name on the defensive end and is in the top 20 in block percentage and blocks per game. Opponents are struggling at the rim, and the Johnnies don’t give up many free throws. RJ Luis Jr. is a burgeoning star this fall, with nightly averages of 17.5 points, three assists and nearly eight rebounds. In a convincing 14-point win over New Mexico at Madison Square Garden on Sunday, Luis had 21 points and seven dimes to just one turnover. Rick Pitino played all of his starters for 33 or more minutes in that game. Four players attempted at least 10 shots. If this team has a glaring weakness, it would be its lack of depth and penchant for turnovers. Senior guard Kadary Richmond had seven of them against the Lobos. Baylor’s “no middle” defensive scheme generates a lot of pressure. If the Red Storm is to secure their first win over a ranked opponent in more than a decade, they will have to be more disciplined with their possessions. Time: Thursday, 9:30 p.m. ET
TV: CBSSN The Volunteers tout the NCAA’s fourth-best defense when adjusted for efficiency and have opened this campaign 4-0, with an impressive 22-point beatdown of Louisville on the road. The team is led by Zakai Zeigler, a four-year Vol that racks up buckets, dimes and steals. His 7.8 assists per game are a career-high, but so are his unsightly 4.5 turnovers. Croatian senior Igor Milicic Jr. transferred from Charlotte and has made more than two-thirds of his shot attempts so far. Tennessee is a double-digit favorite in this one. Virginia is looking for an identity in the post-Bennett era. It opened this season 4-0 but sits 77th in KenPom rating and 130th in adjusted offense. Granted, the Cavaliers have always been partial to a grinding style of basketball. Freshman Jacob Cofie already looks like an archetypal Virginia player, averaging two steals and 1.7 blocks. If this game gets close, it will likely be due to an Isaac McKneely heat check. A career 43.5 percent shooter on 3s, he has hit a blistering 64.7 percent of them so far this season. Now to the Allegheny Mountains, the Bahamas of Appalachia. The first-ever Greenbrier Tip-Off has an interesting pair of matchups, headlined by the surging Wisconsin Badgers. Time: Friday, 2:30 p.m. ET
TV: CBSSN The 5-0 Panthers and 4-0 Tigers are scheduled for a Friday afternoon tip. Pittsburgh guard Jaland Lowe just recorded the sixth triple-double in program history, and Jeff Capel’s team is off to its best start since 2018-19 — complete with a beatdown of West Virginia in the Backyard Brawl last week. LSU’s player to watch is undoubtedly Cam Carter. This year, the Kansas State transfer has been lights out from behind the arc at a 57 percent clip. Time: Friday, 5 p.m. ET
TV: CBSSN Wisconsin comes to this early in-season tournament with an abundance of momentum and good vibes. Its seismic win over Arizona was spearheaded by sixth-year guard John Tonje, who scored 41 points on 14 shots. Yep, read it again. UCF gets an arduous nonconference challenge before the loaded Big 12 schedule kicks in. The Knights stunned Texas A&M on their opening night, with fourth-year guard Darius Johnson scoring 24 points while burying five 3-pointers. The winners of these two games will play on Sunday afternoon at Colonial Hall — the Greenbrier’s massive convertible grand ballroom. Pinkies up.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Kirby Smart vs. the College Football Playoff committee and the statistics that matter most,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938257/2024/11/21/college-football-playoff-committee-kirby-smart/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 20:48:46 GMT",Let’s update each SEC team's yards-per-play differential and explosive-play differential and go deeper on schedule strength.,"NCAAF We’re pleased to return to America’s newest feud: Kirby Smart vs. the College Football Playoff committee. The latest iteration came when the selection committee placed Smart’s Georgia team at No. 10 in its latest rankings, and chairman Warde Manuel said the disparity in schedules makes it “difficult to assess” strength of schedule. Advertisement “We have to rely on how the teams are playing and who they’re playing as well as how the other teams, regardless of strength of schedule, are playing their opponents,” Manuel said. “We take a look at it holistically. Strength of schedule is a component. It’s an important data point to us and for us. But it is not the only assessment that we make.” Manuel pointed to Texas, ranked No. 3 despite zero wins over ranked teams, having a top-five defense. That got the attention of Smart, who spoke out again Wednesday. “It just seems unjust to me when you evaluate, somebody’s got a third-ranked defense or somebody’s got a fifth-ranked defense,” Smart said. “Well, don’t you think that third- or fifth-ranked defense is dictated by who they’ve played on offense and how many top offenses they’ve played? Because last time I checked, our offense and our defense have played the top offenses and defenses across the country.” Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox. The top offenses and defense? Not exactly. But many of them? Yes: • Georgia’s offense, which ranks 41st nationally in yards per play, has faced three of the nation’s top six defenses (Texas, Ole Miss, Tennessee) and five of the top 13 (Auburn and Alabama). • Georgia’s defense, which ranks 21st nationally, has faced three of the top 14 offenses (Ole Miss, Alabama, Auburn), as well as Texas (26th), Florida (36th), Clemson (38th) and Tennessee (46th). • As for that Texas defense that Manuel cited, it does rank first nationally, but it has faced one top-20 offense, Arkansas (19th) and two others in the top 50: Florida (36th), and Georgia (41st). But ultimately this may not come down to Georgia vs. Texas, rather which of the six SEC teams currently in contention — seven if you want to include South Carolina — are Playoff-worthy. This year, we’ve been tracking two stats that are key indicators: yards-per-play differential and explosive-play differential. Let’s update each and go deeper on schedule strength. Advertisement This is a rather simple measure. Take each team’s offensive and defensive yards per play, and the higher the former than the latter, then the better the team is doing. In years past, the Playoff-worthy teams tended to be at +2.00 or higher, although that was before the most recent conference moves. Here is the breakdown, first for all games and then just power-conference opponents: Explosive plays are defined differently by different people, but TruMedia Sports, which compiled these numbers, defines them as pass plays of 16-plus yards and rushes of 12-plus yards. These have been shown to be indicative of who wins individual games. Whoever has more in a game usually wins. Throughout a season it is also an indicator. Whereas the yards-per-play stat shows consistency and more of an overall picture, the ability to make and stop explosives matters in today’s more high-octane game. Here is the plus-minus for each team — total explosive plays, not per game — first in overall games: And this is the explosive play margin — per game, unlike the above total — for just power conference games: Texas again looks good in this metric, but Arkansas and its 5-5 record crash the party. So does Auburn (4-6), which also does well in the yards-per-play margin, while Vanderbilt (6-4) is near the bottom in both metrics. So what gives? Turnover margin is one easy answer. Auburn is tied for the worst turnover margin in the SEC, while Vanderbilt is tied for the fourth-best margin. Some of it may also be the Commodores are just overachieving because of a good quarterback who makes big plays, while Auburn, well, is not. There are many explanations and metrics. But let’s finish up with Smart’s favorite one, at least right now: The selection committee uses SportSource Analytics, but that data isn’t public. There are publicly available schedule strengths, including ESPN’s, which has Georgia at No. 1 and every SEC team in the top 38 — with Texas being that last one in at No. 38. Advertisement But let’s try something a little different and quantify the schedule strength by offense and defense. To do that, we go through the average yards per play for every opponent’s offense and defense. First, to measure the schedule strength of each team’s offense, here is the average yards-per-play rank of their opponents’ defenses, including all FBS opponents: Now, to measure the schedule strength of each team’s defense, here is the average yards-per-play rank of their opponents’ offenses, again including all FBS opponents: Well, maybe that helps excuse some of Oklahoma’s offensive issues. And it’s hard not to notice the opposition that Texas and Ole Miss, which dominate the yards-per-play metric. As for Georgia, yes it has had the second-hardest road in the SEC on offense and defense. That’s something for Smart to cite in his next remarks against the selection committee. (Photo: Todd Kirkland / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"NBA All-Star Game's likely tourney format could feature top coaches in East, West: Sources",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938627/2024/11/21/nba-all-star-game-tournament-coaches/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 20:45:25 GMT","If the new format is adopted, as expected, there would be more than one losing team.","NBA The coaching staffs from the top two teams in the NBA’s Eastern and Western Conferences could direct the four groups of All-Stars in a new tournament competition being considered for the league’s annual midseason classic in San Francisco, two team officials told The Athletic Thursday. As part of expansive negotiations under way between multiple stakeholders to dramatically change how the NBA All-Star Game looks, one issue to be ironed out is who coaches the up to four teams that might compete in a tournament-style competition on All-Star Sunday. Advertisement As The Athletic first reported earlier this month, the NBA is considering sweeping changes to its All-Star Game that would be implemented in February, following several years of a disappointing on-court product by the league’s top players. A four-team tournament setting is likely, multiple league sources said, with three teams of eight NBA All-Stars and a fourth team of rookies and sophomores who win the Rising Stars Challenge on All-Star Friday. The format being strongly considered would match the Rising Stars format, in which teams would play to a target score of 40 in a tournament semifinal and 25 in the championship — both of which would be held on All-Star Sunday in lieu of a traditional East versus West All-Star Game with 12-minute quarters. The league, players’ union, coaches and team executives are still ironing out all of the details, including prize money doled out to winners and losers of the tournament and how the teams are selected. When it comes to who coaches the four teams, numerous league officials agree the coach of the top team in each respective conference will direct two of the four All-Star teams. According to two team officials with direct knowledge of league discussions to this point, staffs from the top two teams in each conference could be involved on All-Star Sunday, but other league sources said that option had not been discussed with all stakeholders. In another scenario being discussed, the coach of the Rising Stars team that advances from Friday’s competition to Sunday would retain its coach – likely an assistant from one of the top two NBA teams’ staffs – and it was unknown who the coach of the third All-Star team might be. As of Thursday, Kenny Atkinson has the Cleveland Cavaliers in first place in the East, with the best overall record in the NBA. The top team in the West is the Golden State Warriors, coached by Steve Kerr. The second place team in the East is the Boston Celtics, coached by Joe Mazzulla, and the second place team in the West is the Oklahoma City Thunder, coached by Mark Daigneault. Advertisement Under the league’s new collective bargaining contract with the players’ union, players on the winning team at the All-Star Game would receive $100,000 and players on the losing side would receive $25,000. However, that agreement was struck before the league began serious discussions with players – including, notably, perennial All-Star and likely host for the 2025 game, Stephen Curry – about changing the format. If the Rising Stars format is adopted for the NBA All-Star Game, as expected, there would be more than one losing team.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Oilers' Darnell Nurse on head hit from Leafs' Ryan Reaves: 'I think it’s pretty obvious what’s going on there',https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938570/2024/11/21/oilers-darnell-nurse-rangers-ryan-reaves-head-hit/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 20:29:02 GMT",Nurse won’t play Thursday when the Oilers host the Minnesota Wild.,"NHL EDMONTON – Edmonton Oilers defenseman Darnell Nurse started by trying to be diplomatic. He even accepted some of the blame for the outcome. Then, he stopped mincing his words and gave his true feelings about Toronto Maple Leafs’ Ryan Reaves crushing him with a head hit last Saturday. “He came after and apologized,” Nurse said after Thursday’s morning skate, the first time he’s been on the ice since the incident. “In situations like that, there’s definitely an onus on the player with the puck to be aware of where everyone else is on the ice. Advertisement “With that said, even if you put yourself in a bad spot, there is lots of body in a 6-foot-4 hockey player to hit and not one piece was touched other than my head. You can argue about the intent, but there are certain guys in the league that every shift they go out there and they go out and try to inflict pain. I think it’s pretty obvious what’s going on there.” Reaves was given a match penalty at 2:41 of the second period of an eventual 4-3 overtime win by the Maple Leafs when his attempted check made direct contact with Nurse’s head. Nurse was left woozy and bloodied and remained on the ice as the officials reviewed the play and confirmed the penalty call. He needed help from Edmonton’s head athletic therapist T.D. Forss and winger Mattias Janmark to get to the dressing room. Reaves, who has 1,093 penalty minutes in 893 NHL games, was issued a five-game suspension the next day. Toronto’s Ryan Reaves has been suspended for five games for an illegal check to the head against Edmonton’s Darnell Nurse. https://t.co/GyVuA2TLmG — NHL Player Safety (@NHLPlayerSafety) November 17, 2024  Nurse said he remembers the hit and is feeling better, but the sclera of his right eye was noticeably red. He was also sporting a black eye. Nurse won’t play Thursday when the Oilers host the Minnesota Wild. Coach Kris Knoblauch said Nurse might return to the lineup Saturday when they face the New York Rangers. After Saturday’s game, the Oilers are off until next Friday when they visit Utah for the first time. “With these things, (the) timeline is up to multiple people, so what I feel sometimes isn’t indicative of what’s going to happen,” Nurse said. “I’m just going to take it a day at a time. I haven’t looked too far ahead. If I’m feeling good, I always want to be out there. We’ll see how it goes.” Advertisement The especially unfortunate part for the Oilers and Nurse is that he was playing some of his best hockey of the season. Nurse had a three-point outing last Thursday against the Nashville Predators, including two goals and the game winner in overtime. Nurse has two goals and nine points with a plus-2 rating this season. His 20:49 average ice time ranks third on the team for blueliners behind Evan Bouchard and Mattias Ekholm and fifth overall behind Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl. The Oilers called up blueliner Josh Brown from AHL Bakersfield on Sunday. Brown played his first two games for Edmonton on Monday and Tuesday. The Oilers sent him down on Wednesday but recalled him on Thursday. “Frustration is what you make of the situation,” Nurse said. “Any situation that you’re in you can be frustrated about it, but it’s an injury and it’s part of the job. “You’re going to go out there and things are going to happen and sometimes you’re going to get injured. You have to do whatever you can to get back to 100 percent and get out there and be as effective as you can be.” Nurse said this is the first time he’s sustained a head injury in his career. The Oilers are also missing wingers Viktor Arvidsson and Zach Hyman due to undisclosed injuries. Arvidsson has missed the last four games, which will likely extend to at least six. He won’t play Thursday and isn’t expected to dress on Saturday. Knoblauch said Hyman will be out four to seven days. The Oilers claimed winger Kasperi Kapanen off waivers from St. Louis on Tuesday. They also recalled winger Drake Caggiula from the minors on Wednesday. Both are scheduled to play against the Wild – Kapanen with Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Jeff Skinner, and Caggiula with Derek Ryan and Corey Perry.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,What does Pep Guardiola staying mean for Manchester City?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5937112/2024/11/21/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-contract-what-it-means/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 20:15:11 GMT",The manager's decision to sign a new contract is a huge boost for the club and may strengthen their hand in the January transfer window,"EPL At a time of significant uncertainty around Manchester City and the Premier League, Pep Guardiola’s new contract is a major boost for the club. The Brighton fans sang “you’re getting sacked in the morning” as City lost their fourth match in a row before the international break, but the quality of the manager and his employers’ absolute confidence in him meant that, far from scrutiny, in his two weeks off, he was handed a new deal that should see him stay at City for another two years. Advertisement Guardiola’s ability speaks for itself and has been reiterated by the latest City in-house documentary, but the very fact he remains in place is surely just as valuable given the change of sporting director, the possible departure of some key players and, of course, an impending outcome of the Premier League charges. The news is not necessarily going to provide an immediate fix to City’s current issues on the pitch because, in the most part, the recent run of defeats has been caused by something that good vibes cannot fix: injuries. City may also be lacking in physicality and mobility without Rodri even when everybody else is fit and that might be something they feel they have to rectify in January.  And given those current fallibilities, games against Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool are far from ideal. When Guardiola signed a new deal in November 2020, his team had been struggling for a while and they did not immediately get better — they actually lost at Spurs in the very next game and it took a few weeks for things to click. Crucially, things did click. That is what you tend to get with Guardiola; if not quite an assurance, then a confidence that things are going to turn out OK, and that is what City have secured for another season at least. They may have to wait a little while for the boost to become evident due to those injuries, but it surely will. The people at the very top of the club have got even more than they wanted (two years is beyond what most had even hoped for) and so have the fans. The players will know that the biggest driving force, the one that helps get the best out of them, will remain in place, and even those who may not be too enamoured with the manager will know that his power base is stronger than ever. City generally manage to generate momentum from somewhere when they need it most: last season, they had the mid-season trip to Saudi Arabia for the Club World Cup, which allowed them to reset after a painful home draw against Crystal Palace. Advertisement The year before that, the announcement of the charges levelled against the club by the Premier League certainly seemed to galvanise the team when they were struggling for consistency. So while the injury situation is an immediate concern (and one that should be clearing up soon, barring Rodri’s season-long absence), the benefits of Guardiola’s renewal are obvious in the medium and long term, not least when it comes to squad planning. For starters, it might help in January if City try to strengthen the midfield — being able to say that Guardiola is there and fully motivated is going to help attract players in most cases (that is probably going to be the case when it comes to tying Erling Haaland down to a new deal, too). City are set to change director of football in the summer, with Hugo Viana arriving to replace Txiki Begiristain, who has been there for 12 years. It goes without saying that not having to replace both the football director and the manager at the same time is probably going to be beneficial, but beyond that, there should be extra confidence that Guardiola staying in charge will help smooth over the transition above him, particularly when it comes to bringing new players into a relatively stable environment. There is certainly the potential to make some big changes in the summer, chiefly because Kevin De Bruyne’s contract is set to expire, but also because there has been uncertainty around other key players in recent seasons, which may rear its head again, specifically regarding Ederson, Kyle Walker and Bernardo Silva — the latter has been open to an exit for years but, admittedly, never actually leaves. Ilkay Gundogan only just rejoined in the summer and has 18 months left on his deal, but he has yet to recapture his best form and, if that situation were to continue, he would at the very least be looking at a reduced role next season. Advertisement City did not make big moves in the most recent window, largely because most of the key players did not actually go, so there was no need to replace them, but that could change next summer. There is certainly a feeling, from the outside at least, that City could do with freshening things up in midfield and there could also be a situation where Jack Grealish’s future is up for discussion, as he missed much of last season through injury and off-field issues and has so far been unable to put that right. There is also money to spend, which sounds obvious given City’s backing and the general perception of their spending, but they do not always utilise their vast fortunes. In fact, over the past five years, City have brought in far more money than they have spent in the transfer window. Guardiola personally has not wanted to bring too many players in either, partly because he does not want a crowded squad and the associated risk of unsettling those who do not play, and also because he keeps an eye on the club’s finances, too. For example, a deal was close to being agreed for Celtic striker Kyogo Furuhashi in the summer, but it was Guardiola who decided against it, despite Julian Alvarez leaving for Atletico Madrid. In that sense, there are no guarantees Guardiola’s continuation at City will bring major changes to the squad. In fact, it suggests the opposite, but it is tempting to believe that with Begiristain leaving and Guardiola now committed to the club for at least another season — possibly so he can help smooth over the transition — as well as the prospect of at least a couple senior players moving on, City might make some serious moves to ensure the club is in a strong position for the final years of the Guardiola era. Quite possibly for the first years of the post-Pep era, too; Guardiola has always wanted to leave the club in a good position and that is surely the case now more than ever. Given Viana’s arrival — he will spend some time at the club before the end of the season to help the transition process — and Guardiola’s new deal, there will be a particular focus on putting City in a position to thrive when the manager finally does depart. And then there are those charges. We are finally within touching distance of an outcome that will, of course, have major implications. If City were to be found guilty of some or many of the most serious charges, then a serious sanction would surely follow and that may limit their capacity or appetite to strengthen the squad. Advertisement Should they avoid any major sanctions and presumably remove the spectre of, say, relegation or an enormous fine, they may feel emboldened to spend the money that they have brought in in recent years. In terms of what we can read into Guardiola’s new deal when it comes to the charges, it is fair to say that had he announced his departure this week, there would have surely been a widespread assumption that City were fearing the worst regarding the hearing. Much is made of his comments in 2022 when he said, “If you lie to me, the day after I am not here,” but on plenty of occasions since then, he has struck a more defiant tone, insisting he would be more determined than ever to stay, even if the club were relegated. Given Guardiola is staying, logically there is social media speculation that City must be confident things will go their way. In reality, Guardiola made his decision based on other factors — his energy to continue and the happiness of his family — because everybody on the football side at City has been going about their business on the assumption that the club has done nothing wrong and will not be punished. That has been the message from the top, not just since the charges were levelled last February, but since the first Football Leaks-led reports in 2018. Business as usual, then, as Guardiola gears up for his next big challenge… Spurs on Saturday. (Top photo: Gualter Fatia/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The Athletic exclusively reported on Tuesday that the 53-year-old had agreed fresh terms on a new deal to take him past 10 years service for the Premier League club, with his previous contract due to expire at the end of the current campaign. Advertisement City are on a run of four straight defeats in all competitions and Guardiola said he wanted to stay and help “turn the situation” around. “I want to be honest, I thought this (season) should be the last one. But the problems we had in the last month, I felt now was not the time to leave. I didn’t want to let the club down,” he said. He added: “Manchester City means so much to me. This is my ninth season here, we have experienced so many amazing times together. I have a really special feeling for this football club. That is why I am so happy to be staying for another two more seasons. “I have said this many times before, but I have everything a manager could ever wish for, and I appreciate that so much. Hopefully now we can add more trophies to the ones we have already won. That will be my focus.” Guardiola arrived at the Etihad Stadium in July 2016 and has masterminded an unprecedented period of success since then. The Spaniard has won 18 trophies during his time in English football, including six Premier League titles — second in the all-time list behind former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson (13). In 2022-23, he helped City become only the second English side after Ferguson’s 1998-99 team to win the Treble — comprising the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League. Last term his side made history by becoming the first team to win four successive top-flight titles.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Colorado’s 2-way star Travis Hunter plans to enter next year's NFL Draft, play both WR and CB",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938396/2024/11/21/travis-hunter-nfl-draft-comments/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 19:09:39 GMT","The 6-foot-1, 185-pound junior WR and cornerback for the Buffaloes also said he intends to play on both sides of the ball at the next level.","NCAAF In the least stunning news of the 2024 season, Heisman Trophy frontrunner and likely No. 1 overall pick in next year’s NFL Draft Travis Hunter confirmed that this will indeed be his last year in college football. In a conference call with media members Thursday, Colorado’s dynamic two-way superstar confirmed he is bound for the NFL in 2025. The 6-foot-1, 185-pound junior wide receiver and cornerback for the Buffaloes also said he intends to play on both sides of the ball at the next level. Hunter’s 2024 Heisman campaign received a boost in last weekend’s 49-24 win over Utah. Advertisement The Colorado star hauled in his third interception of the year, had his first rushing touchdown of the year and had five catches for 55 yards. He also had a highlight-reel snag in triple coverage that was yet another Heisman moment for college football’s most unique player. In 2024, Hunter leads the Buffaloes with 911 yards on 74 receptions and nine receiving touchdowns. Before Colorado improved to 8-2 with the win over Utah on its roll toward a Big 12 Conference title game appearance, Colorado head coach Deion Sanders was asked on FOX’s “Big Noon Kickoff” if he had to choose to give a Heisman vote to Hunter or his son, Buffaloes quarterback Shedeur Sanders, who would he choose. Deion said it would go to Hunter. After his performance against the Utes, Deion doubled down. “Travis is who he is,” Sanders said. “It’s supposed to go to the best college football player. I think that’s been a wrap since, what, Week 2?” A former five-star high school recruit, Hunter decommitted from Florida State — Sanders’ alma mater — nearly three years ago and chose to play for Sanders at Jackson State in 2022 before following Sanders to Boulder. Hunter’s declaration is the least surprising thing we’ve seen all year. The Colorado dynamo started gaining traction as the country’s No. 1 prospect on scouting boards early this season. Nothing about that has slowed, as Hunter’s college run (especially the two FBS seasons) as a full-time two-way skill player is really unlike anything we’ve ever seen in modern college football. Charles Woodson won a Heisman Trophy in 1997 as a defensive player who played sparingly on offense. Hunter rarely misses a snap and has been the best player on both sides of the ball in every college game in which he’s worn a helmet. Whether he’ll be selected with the first pick in the draft remains to be seen, as several NFL teams remain desperate for a QB. However, it’s hardly impossible that Hunter becomes either the first wide receiver to go No. 1 since Keyshawn Johnson (1996) or the first-ever CB to land the top spot. Advertisement Everyone has questions about whether the two-way business can continue in the NFL. Though it’s not foolish to suggest Hunter could be a team’s top corner while spending some time as an offensive gimmick/returner. I’m also not going to doubt him just yet, as he’s pretty unique. — Nick Baumgardner, senior writer  (Photo: Christian Petersen / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here Jeff Gluck/The Athletic For those who had to leave their pets at home, a free souvenir opportunity inside the paddock: A dog tag maker called “Pup Position.” Inside an oversized dog house placed between the Ferrari and McLaren hospitality areas, people are lining up to bring a little piece of the Las Vegas Grand Prix back to Fido. Advertisement Getty Images Today is media day in Las Vegas, meaning F1 has teed up a few figures to speak at its media conferences ahead of the racing. The teams and other parties will have their own media sessions planned too, but here is who F1 has lined up:  Today — drivers Tomorrow — team principals Let’s see what everyone has to say, and if there are any late changes to the lineup… Getty Images Zhou Guanyu doesn’t know which color he’ll be wearing in the Formula One paddock next year, though he knows it won’t be Sauber’s green and black colors after the announcement last week that the Chinese driver’s tenure with the team is ending at the end of the current season. “You will see me in the paddock, which color I don’t know,” Zhou said. “I’ll leave that to be seen.” Although Zhou’s plans aren’t yet finalized for 2025, he is confident he will have a place in the sport in some capacity, likely as a reserve driver. He is seeking that role to vault himself into a position to return full-time in 2026, aided by an extensive testing program as part of the role. “I feel like I'm in a position to not rush to make that decision because I need to make sure I’m with a team that can give me a chance to maybe having a seat back, and then also a team that I can continue to grow as a driver,” Zhou said. “So we need to take a bit more time, it won't be decided in the next month.” Sauber is completely overhauling its driver lineup in 2025, with both Zhou and Valtteri Bottas exiting. Replacing Zhou and Bottas are Nico Hülkenberg and Formula 2 championship leader Gabriel Bortoleto. Bortoleto is among a sizable group of drivers with less than a full year’s experience who are set to be on the grid next year. That influx is factoring into Zhou’s decision to pursue a reserve driver role, with the thinking that one (or more) of these young drivers may underperform to the point where their team decides to make a move. “There's a lot of opportunities that could happen for ‘26 onwards,” Zhou said. “I still want to stay here in a reserve role … hopefully waiting for a good opportunity to come back.” Luke Smith Good day from Las Vegas, where my body is currently trying to work out what time it actually is!  We’re on PST, but effectively on Japanese time due to the night race — meaning there’s been a split in approach among most people I’ve spoken to.  Do you try to stay up late, or go to bed at a ‘normal-ish’ time? I really have no idea, still. The timezone challenge was immense last year, particularly after second practice got delayed so much it did not finish until 4am. This year it should be a little easier, given FP2 and qualifying are now scheduled for 10pm instead of midnight. But the race remains a 10pm start, meaning we'll be working long into the small hours of Sunday morning. I’ve been out for a walk along the Strip, and it’s looking more and more like a race track. The organizers in Vegas do a terrific job to keep the roadways as open as possible to ensure traffic can flow before then closing them to prepare for the on-track sessions.  There are plenty of fans around wearing all kinds of merch. It’s nice to see so much interest and support here for the race.  As usual, F1 tire provider Pirelli has assessed what’s in store for the field in Las Vegas from its headquarters in Milan — and it makes for interesting reading. With the Nevadan track being the second longest on the 2024 calendar behind Spa-Francorchamps, and the Mojave desert temperature drop for the nighttime race, Pirelli expects the cars to run in air temperatures of around 10C (50 degrees Fahrenheit). It will also be a similar track temperature. In short, it’s going to be cold. Those temperatures and visiting a street circuit allows Pirelli to use its softest compound tires, and it expects most cars to take on a two-stop strategy come the race — although a one-stop will remain an option for those teams who are confident they can make it work.  Pirelli also suggests that going longer with the first stint of the race — basically putting off your first pit stop as long as possible — will be more beneficial than trying to go longer at the end, because it will take a while to get the tires up to their ideal operating temperature from off the grid.  If you’ve read this far, make sure you take a closer look at Pirelli’s preview graphic, attached above.  Getty Images The prospect of Max Verstappen clinching his fourth world championship at the Las Vegas Grand Prix, F1’s glitziest race, is exciting for the sport. Verstappen will secure the title with two rounds to spare if he can finish ahead of Lando Norris on Saturday night or if Norris fails to outscore him by three points. Preparations are already being made by officials behind the Las Vegas Grand Prix in conduction with Red Bull in the event that Verstappen was to wrap up the title. I spoke earlier today with Renee Wilm, the CEO of the Las Vegas Grand Prix, and Emily Prazer, the chief commercial officer of F1 and the Las Vegas Grand Prix, who stayed tight-lipped on plans but confirmed things are in motion. “Emily is never without an idea for a spectacle,” Wilm said, teeing up Prazer to explain her thinking. “I obviously work really closely with the Red Bull team across the board, whether it's hospitality or marketing or whatever,” Prazer said. “So we called them, we said, let's have a chat about what this looks like if you win. Obviously, we're in Vegas, so we want to help you put on a huge party. “There's mixed thoughts on that from their camp, but we have a significant plan as you'd expect. I don't want to ruin it, though … Just watch out for the Bellagio fountains.” GO FURTHER How Max Verstappen can win the drivers’ championship in Las Vegas and light up F1’s glitziest race Advertisement  When a loose water valve cover wrecked the underside of Carlos Sainz’s Ferrari and canceled the opening practice session after just eight minutes last year, F1’s $650 million bet on bringing the sport to Las Vegas looked risky. From then on, the weekend was deemed a huge success.  Which brings us to year two, with Vegas now lacking the novelty and unknowns of its inaugural race. That is why they listened to feedback and put together a playbook for this second visit — in the words of Las Vegas GP CEO Renee Wilm: 💬 “I wouldn’t say it’s easier in year two. But it is a significantly different experience.” You can read up on the road Vegas has taken from last year to this, with an excellent piece from Luke Smith below. You’ll enjoy this one.    GO FURTHER F1 prepares for Las Vegas GP’s second year: ‘Now we have a playbook’  The U.S. was back in the F1 spotlight come October, as Texas’ Circuit of The Americas hosted the 2024 United States Grand Prix.  It started in ominous fashion, with Red Bull’s upgrades delivering a dominant sprint race victory for Max Verstappen — his first F1 win of any kind in 112 days. But that pace didn’t carry into the grand prix sessions. Lando Norris delivered a stunning lap in an aborted Q3 to claim pole for McLaren, before Ferrari took the race by storm as Charles Leclerc blitzed his third victory of the year, with outgoing teammate Carlos Sainz just behind. The rest of the fun was saved for Norris and Verstappen, whose lengthy sparring ended with Norris’ late overtake of the Dutchman while both cars exceeded track limits. Verstappen picked up a warning, Norris got a five-second penalty for not handing back the position, and it was Red Bull who could celebrate the final podium spot.  GO FURTHER Charles Leclerc wins F1 U.S. Grand Prix, Lando Norris loses podium to late penalty  Las Vegas is the last of Formula One’s three visits to the United States in 2024. It all kicked off with the Miami Grand Prix back in May, where Max Verstappen took sprint and grand prix pole in qualifying — also dominating the sprint race. But the grand prix was a different matter, and a little piece of history for Lando Norris as the McLaren driver claimed his first F1 victory. That felt like quite the moment, given Norris went on to push Verstappen as his chief title rival during the year.   The inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix last year came with a lot of pre-race hype and razzmatazz — and then the track action trumped it all.  In a season of routine predictability, this race was as good as it got. Even Max Verstappen didn’t have things all his own way, penalized for forcing Charles Leclerc off the track at Turn 1 (we’d seen that move a few times before and since) — but then showing Red Bull’s dominance to claw his way back into the lead. Leclerc was supreme in pinching second off Sergio Perez in the final corners, while Esteban Ocon excelled in claiming fourth for Alpine.  A repeat of the action this year on F1’s second visit would be very welcome.

The Athletic obtained a copy of the memo. This alert comes after burglaries at the homes of Kansas City Chiefs stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce last month. Two law enforcement officials told NBC News the FBI is working with local agencies to determine whether the recent burglaries are connected to a transnational crime syndicate. Per NBC’s report Wednesday, there has been no determination about who is responsible and the investigation is ongoing. Advertisement “The homes of professional athletes across multiple sports leagues have become increasingly targeted for burglaries by organized and skilled groups,” the NFL’s memo said. “Law enforcement officials have noted these groups appear to exploit team schedules to target athletes’ homes on game days.” The memo also included ways the groups survey players’ whereabouts and explained methods of entry into homes. The league security team provided recommendations regarding the use of social media, including avoiding posting images of expensive items or comments about hotel accommodations. The memo also spelled out methods of home security. The NFL issued this security alert to clubs to tell their players and staff about “organized and skilled” criminals increasingly targeting professional athletes' homes. pic.twitter.com/EoArE8dTw0 — Dianna Russini (@DMRussini) November 21, 2024  Mahomes addressed the incident involving his home last Wednesday, calling it “frustrating” and “disappointing.” “I can’t get into too many of the details because the investigation is still ongoing,” he said. “But obviously something that you don’t want to happen to really anybody, but obviously yourself.” Officers responded to a reported burglary shortly after midnight on Oct. 6 at Mahomes’ estate in Belton, Mo., according to a police report from the Cass County, Mo. Sheriff’s Office. Mahomes is not identified in the report, but the address listed matches public records for the three-time Super Bowl MVP quarterback. A day after the reported burglary at Mahomes’ home, another reported burglary occurred around 7:30 p.m. on Oct. 7 at a residence in Leawood, Kan., believed to belong to Kelce, according to a Leawood Police Department offense report. The Chiefs beat the New Orleans Saints at Arrowhead Stadium in a “Monday Night Football” game that night with Taylor Swift, Kelce’s girlfriend, in attendance.

The FGF said in a statement on Thursday that it filed a formal complaint about the alleged error following the qualifier. The Tanzanian Football Federation (TFF) later said it had not received any indication from the Confederation of African Football (CAF), which organises AFCON, that their player’s participation in the match was “illegal”. Advertisement Tanzania won the match 1-0 in its capital of Dar es Salaam, which saw them book their spot in the 2025 AFCON by finishing second in their qualification group, one point ahead of third-placed Guinea. But the FGF claims that the shirt number error should result in Tanzania being penalised by losing the match and the victory and three points instead awarded to Guinea, which would see them qualify instead. The incident in question occurred in the 73rd minute of Tuesday’s game, when Ibrahim Ame was introduced. The FGF claims that he wore the No 26 in error, as there was no player with that number listed on the official teamsheet. The TFF, though, adds that its players were checked by Guinea and the match commissioner ahead of the game and that it is “surprised” about the claim regarding the illegitimacy of Ame’s participation. The Athletic has approached CAF for comment. (Fadel Senna/AFP via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Los Angeles Sparks begin plans to build practice facility,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938033/2024/11/21/los-angeles-sparks-practice-facility/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:01:55 GMT","For the last two seasons, L.A. practiced out of El Camino College, a community college in Torrance, Calif.","WNBA On the same day that the Los Angeles Sparks will introduce their new head coach Lynne Roberts, the franchise set into motion another pillar of its future. The Sparks announced Thursday that they have partnered with Transwestern Real Estate Services to begin the process of building a practice facility. Advertisement Transwestern works with teams and leagues to acquire land and properties and provide brokerage services. The company has been part of recent projects with the Phoenix Mercury and Overtime Elite. “We are building more than a practice facility; we are investing in the future of women’s basketball in Los Angeles,” Sparks governor Eric Holoman said in a statement. “This facility is part of a broader vision to elevate the LA Sparks as the premier franchise in the WNBA and to create an environment where our players have every resource they need to achieve greatness. Los Angeles is a city of champions, and we are determined to bring that winning legacy to the Sparks.” For the last two seasons, L.A. practiced out of El Camino College, a community college in Torrance, Calif. The Sparks shared the space with students at the school, restricting their access to the building and forcing players to look elsewhere to work out beyond those hours. The absence of a dedicated facility used to be a common experience for WNBA players across the league; however, the recent ownership arms race has led to most teams building their own facilities. A divide has emerged in free agency between the “haves” and the “have nots,” as players target franchises with better amenities. Seattle and Phoenix opened new practice spaces in 2024, while Dallas and Chicago are on track to debut theirs in 2026. Additionally, commissioner Cathy Engelbert has made it incumbent upon expansion teams to have facilities when submitting bids. Los Angeles is merely following suit, as Atlanta and Connecticut are the only other teams out of 13 without their own practice facility or a plan to build one. For the time being, the Sparks will still be in the “have not” camp, as the team has not specified a site for the facility nor a timeline for its construction; the players will spend the 2025 season in a shared space. Advertisement However, Los Angeles’ six-person ownership group contains five owners of the Los Angeles Dodgers, who have famously opened their pocketbooks to attract stars and create a world-class organization. They have the resources to transform their WNBA operation in a similar manner, and enlisting Transwestern’s services is the first step in leveling the Sparks with the rest of the league.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,NHL trade board 2024-25: The latest on all the top targets from Chris Johnston,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5930174/2024/11/21/nhl-trade-board-marchand-hall-nelson/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:00:11 GMT","From Brock Nelson to Brad Marchand to Taylor Hall, the NHL trade market is starting to take shape early this season.","NHL NHL executives didn’t even need to wait for the Thanksgiving turkey to be served before seeing the trade market start to take some early shape. Talks have been brisk well in advance of a holiday that tends to serve as the unofficial point at which front offices begin to take stock of their standing and look around for solutions and improvements. The early-season struggles have been especially pronounced for the Nashville Predators and Boston Bruins, the latter firing coach Jim Montgomery this week less than two years after he won the Jack Adams Award as the league’s top coach. The possibility of personnel changes now hangs in the air. GO DEEPER Bruins trade tiers: Which players could follow the coach out the door? There are a lot of games still to be played before we sort out the league-wide buyers and sellers ahead of the March 7 trade deadline, but it’s not too soon to start sketching out where things could be headed. For the first time in 2024-25, it’s the return of the Big Board. Note: Net Ratings and market values are via Dom Luszczyszyn’s model and are projected for the full season based on statistics through Nov. 19. Goals saved above expected (GSAx) are via Evolving-Hockey, also through Nov. 19. Contract info is via CapWages. Now into his ninth NHL season of averaging at least 22 minutes per night, this all-situations defender is delivering strong play-driving results for a Blue Jackets team that has been more competitive than many were expecting through a quarter of the schedule. Still, the rebuild is on in Columbus and Provorov is a pending unrestricted free agent. A left-shot defenseman who is comfortable playing on both sides of the ice, Provorov carries an attractive cap hit of $4.725 million and will likely net the Blue Jackets a first-round pick before the deadline. Rangy and reliable, there’s nothing flashy about Pettersson’s game. But he has proven in recent years that he can handle 20-plus minutes per night while helping drive play at even strength and should be able to slot in as a second-pairing defenseman on a competitive team. Penguins general manager Kyle Dubas has a big project on his hands, but Pettersson is his most attractive asset to peddle at this year’s deadline — assuming his legacy players with no-movement clause remain untouchable. A mainstay on the Anaheim blue line for 15 years and more than 1,000 games, Fowler is feeling the ground shift beneath his feet with five defensemen aged 25 or younger currently playing alongside him in the Ducks lineup. When you couple that with the fact he has one year beyond this one remaining on his contract at a $6.5 million cap hit, the conditions may be ripe for him to move to a team in a more advanced stage of its competitive window. Fowler and the Ducks will need to work closely on any potential move since the player owns a four-team trade list. However, there’s no reason to expect him to use that to block a trade. The alarm bells started to sound when Hall was scratched for a game last week. He’s struggled to regain form after missing most of last season due to a knee injury, but NHL Edge data shows that one of his strongest attributes — his powerful skating stride — remains. Hall’s top speed of 22.46 miles per hour is well above league average. With the Blackhawks on a trajectory for another spin in the draft lottery and Hall a pending UFA in the later stages of his career, the veteran winger will likely be on the move again. Producing at nearly a point per game across the past two seasons in San Jose, the biggest question for any potential suitor here is fit. As in: Where does Granlund fit on a deeper roster? He’s been the Sharks' top-line center. Still, there isn’t much risk with a rental on an expiring contract who boasts more than 50 games of playoff experience. Granlund is a versatile forward with good vision who not only has a strong track record of power-play production but also kills penalties. The goals have been much harder to come by this season for a guy coming off a career-best 37-goal season, but a look under the hood suggests that Vatrano’s luck should eventually change. He’s still generating more than three shots on goal per game. Vatrano has always had a nose for the net and carries a competitive toolbox that makes him useful no matter where he’s deployed in the lineup. He’s also playing on an affordable, expiring contract. Something might eventually have to give here. The Ducks are demanding more attention to detail from the offensive specialist, and they're getting it, but Zegras is still searching for a way to hang on to the parts of his game that once separated him. Remember that he already has two 60-point campaigns under his belt at age 23. The production has dried up, as has some of the player’s enthusiasm. Jiricek’s introduction to pro hockey has been anything but stable. The No. 6 pick from 2022 has volleyed between the AHL and NHL while struggling to find consistent playing time for two-plus years, and he was just farmed out to AHL Cleveland yet again. As a 6-foot-4 right-shot defenseman, his physical attributes are tantalizing and his potential ceiling is considerable. But he still needs to develop. The Blue Jackets are open to listening on offers to give him a fresh start. The retooling Flyers are short on rental players to take to market in the lead-up to the deadline, but they could probably be compelled to part with the big, physical defenseman if the right deal came along.  Ristolainen plays a rugged style best suited for third-pairing duty. With a contract that stretches two seasons beyond this one, some salary retention might be needed to make a trade work. This is not a player we expected to find on the Big Board, even if he’s currently playing out the final year on his contract. But as a league source noted this week, ""I don't think anyone in Boston thought this is where they'd be at."" If the decision to replace Jim Montgomery with Joe Sacco behind the Bruins bench doesn’t produce the desired results, some difficult personnel decisions will almost certainly follow.  Marchand has had a slow start to the season after a summer during which he underwent multiple surgeries, but he remains a high-end winger who can contribute offensively, kill penalties and, yes, get under an opponent’s skin. You can add his name to the long list of underperforming Bruins, but it’s worth noting that Frederic is only months removed from an 18-goal, 40-point breakout campaign. He’s a big man who skates well and can effectively be deployed as a checker. Boston's not in sell mode yet, but should it reverse course later this season, Frederic would be a valuable trade asset. A rough-and-tumble winger who boasts an impressive fight card, Olivier has caught the attention of at least a couple of NHL teams currently eyeing potential depth forward options. The 27-year-old pending UFA has even managed to chip in more than his share of expected goals early this season.  But what makes him most attractive is his size, strength and willingness to embrace an energy role. Olivier is built for playoff hockey. A shutdown forward who can be trusted in bottom-six duty, Faksa is typically reliable in the faceoff dot and as part of the penalty kill. While he doesn’t bring much offensive pop at even strength, he holds appeal as a rental option who has experienced a couple of long playoff runs in the past. What he lacks in size he makes up in tenacity and feistiness. Gourde is a strong skater and two-way player who owns a couple of Stanley Cup rings from his time with Tampa Bay. His offensive numbers are down to start this season, but he’ll draw attention if Seattle fades from the playoff picture as we get closer to the trade deadline. While certainly not a player the Wild are under pressure to trade, they are facing a decision on Rossi. He’s a pending restricted free agent, and Minnesota needs to determine if it's ready to commit long-term to a diminutive winger with elite offensive instincts and playmaking abilities. Rossi is off to a strong start this season for a Wild team punching above its weight class. He’s a candidate to be included in a player-for-player swap. Off to a reasonably good start for the underperforming Penguins, Rakell has strong finishing ability and can hold his own alongside highly skilled linemates. The challenge in moving him comes in the form of a contract that extends three years beyond this one — albeit at a reasonable price in a rising cap environment. Unless Nashville can pull itself out of a significant hole, Nyquist will become a trade chip of note. He’s coming off a 75-point season at age 34 — the most productive year of his NHL career — and playing on an expiring contract. Nyquist is a talented playmaker who remains a strong skater and isn’t showing any obvious signs of slowing down. A smart right-shot defenseman with good size, Borgen holds appeal as a potential rental. Historically, he’s been a good shot suppressor on the penalty kill — although the results aren’t quite as favorable in that area so far this season. He’s a good skater in the prime of his career. With this season plus one more left on the contract of the left-shot defenseman, the Canadiens are in position to gauge the marketplace and see if anything out there makes sense. Matheson is a strong skater coming off a 62-point season so that added term should theoretically increase the return compared to if they wait another year to make a decision. Another consideration to be weighed is how removing Matheson from the equation might affect the well-stocked pipeline of young defensemen in the Canadiens organization. He’s currently playing more than 24 minutes per night. Nelson is a big, sturdy forward who has scored at a 35-goal pace across the past three seasons. He can be slotted as a second-line center or slide into a wing spot on the top line. As a pending unrestricted free agent, he’s exactly the kind of difference-maker contending teams would be falling over themselves to get their hands on if — and it remains a massive if — the Islanders fade from the playoff picture and choose to move him before the trade deadline. That organization has a healthy track record of keeping its own. Stay tuned. Power forwards with strong playoff resumes don’t grow on trees. Saad’s best days may be behind him, but he still profiles as a complementary winger who can chip in with a little offense and handle a hard game. He’s got one season beyond this one remaining on his contract, but he seems better suited for a Cup-chasing team than the retooling Blues. Traded from Edmonton to San Jose over the summer in a cap-clearing move, it’s hard to imagine the veteran right-shot defenseman finishing out this campaign with the cellar-dwelling Sharks. Not only is he a pending unrestricted free agent, but he’s also shown himself capable of handling the rigors of playoff hockey during three runs with Edmonton. Most notably, he was an important part of the penalty kill that was a massive difference-maker for the Oilers in the spring.  While Ceci has his detractors, his blend of experience and defensive attributes should hold some appeal to teams looking for added depth before the playoffs. Reliable right-shot centers who can fill a depth role always have currency come deadline.  Bjugstad has shown that before — getting traded in 2022 from Arizona to Edmonton in a deal that brought back a third-round pick and defenseman Michael Kesselring — and he’s trending toward being that kind of asset again for Utah HC. He’s reliable play driver who profiles as an ideal bottom-six utilityman. A Big Board mainstay, this may finally be the season Gibson finds his way back to a competitive team. He’s lost the No. 1 job in Anaheim to Lukáš Dostál and is inching ever closer to the end of a contract with two years remaining on it after this one. That’s been the biggest impediment to finding him a new home. While Gibson's numbers in recent seasons don’t jump off the page in a positive way, they should be viewed with the understanding he’s played behind some horrific defensive teams. How the veteran might perform under better conditions is unknown, but it’s potentially a compelling enough possibility for someone to roll the dice. The Sabres certainly aren’t shopping the 23-year-old defenseman, but he may be the piece they have to put in play in order to make a significant shakeup. Byram is an elite skater who can log big minutes and should still have his best and most productive seasons ahead. He’s also due for a new contract after the season as a pending restricted free agent. The Sabres control his rights, but they’re a team with a lot of money and years already tied up in their blue line, so decisions are looming.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Joe Sacco is the Bruins interim head coach. Who’s next if he comes up short?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938123/2024/11/21/bruins-coaching-candidates/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:39:53 GMT",Who could GM Don Sweeney be keeping an eye on while monitoring the team's progress under Sacco? Here's an early look at six candidates.,"NHL BRIGHTON, Mass. — Joe Sacco is in charge. Any resumes that arrive in Don Sweeney’s inbox will not be up for immediate consideration. “I just ruled out that I wasn’t going to go out and do a coaching search right now,” the Boston Bruins general manager said on Wednesday. Sacco is ready for the position. Since 2014, the Medford native has learned under Claude Julien, Bruce Cassidy and Jim Montgomery to optimize himself for the Bruins wheel. Advertisement “Everybody has different personalities and different ways to motivate their teams and individuals,” Sacco said. “You take the good you want to take from certain individuals. But at the end of the day, if you’re not yourself, it doesn’t work.” Sacco is a straight shooter. The 55-year-old’s strength is his experience. While serving his hometown team, the Medford native has specialized in multiple areas, most lately the penalty kill. “He’s basically done everything from being the D coach when I first got here to forward, power play, penalty kill, everything in between,” Charlie McAvoy said. “His experience is vast. Possibly the most important thing is he understands, like a lot of the guys like myself who have been here, what it looks like and what it feels like to be a Bruin — what the standard is every single day and what we’re going to recapture moving forward.” Sacco’s title, however, remains interim head coach. Everyone is under evaluation, from Sweeney to Sacco to every player on the roster. So if Sacco cannot straighten out the team by year’s end, the permanent position does not necessarily belong to him. Who could Sweeney be keeping an eye on while monitoring the team under Sacco? Here’s an early look at six candidates: Sweeney brought Leach back this season as an assistant coach for a reason: He believes in the 45-year-old. Leach spent the past two seasons as an assistant to Dave Hakstol in Seattle. Before that, he was the AHL Providence coach for four seasons. Trent Frederic and Jeremy Swayman played for Leach there. Leach emphasized positivity and growth mindset in Providence. Players who developed into NHLers under Leach, a former defenseman, include Connor Clifton, Jeremy Lauzon and Jakub Zboril. Leach’s familiarity with the organization and his head coaching experience put him atop the list. Advertisement Like Sacco, Leach interviewed for the job that Montgomery won in 2022. Mougenel is in his third season as Providence’s head coach. He was Leach’s assistant before being promoted. He is a high-energy, glass-half-full coach. He has helped Johnny Beecher and Justin Brazeau become full-time Bruins. Georgii Merkulov is hoping to join that category.  Mougenel has yet to turn the same trick with Fabian Lysell, who has one goal in 12 games this year. He is also tasked with helping Matt Poitras return to Boston. The 57-year-old is probably the most high-profile ex-head coach looking for an opportunity. McLellan was most recently behind the Los Angeles Kings bench following stops with the Edmonton Oilers and San Jose Sharks. The Bruins would most likely have to invest term and salary to hire McLellan. Like McLellan, Gallant is waiting for another NHL shot. He deserves it. Gallant had results with the New York Rangers, Vegas Golden Knights and Florida Panthers.  Players have enjoyed working with Gallant.  Pandolfo was a Bruins assistant for five years before leaving to become Boston University’s associate coach in 2021. A year later, after BU fired head coach Albie O’Connell, Pandolfo took over the Terriers. BU lost to Denver, the eventual NCAA champion, in the Frozen Four last year. Whether Pandolfo wants to return to the NHL’s schedule and travel is unknown. Pandolfo is a BU alum. The ex-Bruin and current assistant is close with Brad Marchand, which works in his favor. But Kelly is in charge of the NHL’s worst power play.  Kelly is in his fourth season as an assistant. The 44-year-old does not have head coaching experience.

FIFA approved a proposal in October to give its national associations the option of introducing an “exceptional registration window” to “address technicalities and equalise inconsistencies created by differences in registration periods and domestic-season timings”. Advertisement A statement from the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) said on Thursday: “Taking into account the 2025 edition of the FIFA Club World Cup, at the request of the Lega Serie A and pending the definition of the specific regulation, it was also decided to authorise an additional transfer window from 1 to 10 June 2025.” The window will close five days before the start of the 32-team Club World Cup, which is being held in the United States. Reigning Serie A champions Inter and 36-time Scudetto winners Juventus will represent Italy in the tournament, although every team in Serie A will be able to sign players during the new window.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Maple Leafs 20-game progress reports: Who's thriving? Who's struggling?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936091/2024/11/21/maple-leafs-progress-report-player-analysis/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:30:21 GMT","Twenty games in, the Leafs' record sits at 12-6-2. How's everyone doing? Let's evaluate the roster from top to bottom.","NHL The Toronto Maple Leafs scored maybe their most impressive win all season on Wednesday night, shutting out the Stanley Cup contender Vegas Golden Knights without their best player (Auston Matthews), two other centres (Max Domi and David Kämpf) and two top-nine wingers (Calle Järnkrok and Max Pacioretty). They also lost Matthew Knies to a possible concussion halfway through. Advertisement The victory improved the Leafs’ record to 12-6-2 after 20 games, slightly besting their pace from last season (11-6-3). How’s everyone doing? Twenty games feels like the right time to take a step back and evaluate the roster from top to bottom (in no particular order). Anthony Stolarz: The Leafs are among the league’s best in goals allowed at five-on-five and it’s thanks, in part, to Stolarz. He’s surrendered 12 goals total at five-on-five in his 12 starts, posting a toasty .955 save percentage. Overall, Stolarz has stopped 10 goals more than expected. Matthew Knies: The sophomore leap is happening. Knies is on pace for over 30 goals. He’s been chowing down on shots around the opposition net. He was averaging around 18.5 minutes per game before his injury against the Golden Knights, playing roles on both special team units, including an unexpected gig on PP1. Knies has also drawn a team-leading eight penalties. The Leafs have to hope he isn’t gone long. Chris Tanev: I think there’s a case to be made that he’s been the Leafs’ MVP to this point — or right there with Stolarz and maybe William Nylander and Mitch Marner. Tanev is arguably the biggest driver of the Leafs’ tidier defensive performance this season. Though he plays the hardest minutes on the team, the Leafs are giving up a mere 1.8 expected goals per 60 minutes at five-on-five with Tanev on the ice. That’s one of the top marks for any NHL defender this season. The penalty kill has also leapt from bad last season to the top 10 thanks largely to Tanev. He’s on pace to block almost 300 shots this season. Jake McCabe: Nobody plays more these days for the Leafs than McCabe. He’s averaging a team-best (and career high) of nearly 22 minutes per game. McCabe has teamed up with Tanev on what’s quickly become a dominant defensive pair. He may be playing the best hockey of his career at age 31. Advertisement Conor Timmins: Timmins’ strong first impression on Craig Berube led, at least in part, to Timothy Liljegren’s exit from the Leafs. How good has he actually been? Has he been better than last season even? I’m not so sure (his PDO of 105.7 trails only John Tavares among Leafs). But the fact he’s playing every night — minus just two games as a scratch — exceeds expectations. Steven Lorentz: The most reliable (maybe the only reliable) bottom-six forward all season. Lorentz has chipped in a bit offensively (three goals), played physically, blocked shots and killed penalties. He doesn’t play a lot, just under 11 minutes per game, but he has the trust of his coach. He’s already played all three forward positions this season. William Nylander: He’s been the most reliable goal-scoring threat for a team that’s struggled to score at times this season, leading the team with 13 goals and helping to fill a (massive) void on that front left by the injured Matthews. Morgan Rielly: Yet again, the ‘who plays with Rielly?’ question has become a thing. Twenty games into the season, Rielly has already had three different partners — Tanev, Oliver Ekman-Larsson and Jani Hakanpää. It’s been a little messy at times defensively and Rielly’s minutes have been scaled back quite a bit to right around 21 minutes a night. Yet, Rielly has been the most (only?) consistent source of offence from the Leaf defence, leading the group with four goals and 13 points. John Tavares: Marner has gotten most of the credit for stepping up in Matthews’ absence. Tavares is probably due some credit himself. He’s taken over the No. 1 centre duties in recent weeks, which has meant playing increasingly big and difficult minutes. He spent most of Game No. 20 matched up against Jack Eichel. He’s on pace for almost 40 goals, punching in some big ones so far with three game winners already, including the overtime goal in Washington last week. Following a 65-point season last year, Tavares is, so far, putting up a point per game in his age-34 season. Mitch Marner: He’s on pace for his first 100-point season — and hasn’t even gotten going yet at five-on-five. Marner has multi-point outings in all six of the Leafs’ wins (in seven games) without Matthews. He’s been increasingly excellent on the defensive side. Oliver Ekman-Larsson: Steady is maybe the best way to describe his season so far. The most surprising part may be the physicality: Ekman-Larsson has thrown 31 hits, third among Leaf defenders so far. His general calmness and confidence moving the puck have helped the Leafs, and he’s added the odd bit of offence beyond Rielly back there, chipping in with one goal and eight points. He has taken a team-high 10 penalties. Advertisement Bobby McMann: He’s scored, skated hard, played physically and looked the part of an NHL power forward. But it’s come in waves; a lot at once and then not very much at all. McMann needs more consistency. Joseph Woll: After his first shutout of the year on Wednesday, Woll is suddenly up to a .922 save percentage in six starts this season. A late start because of injury, coupled with Stolarz’s stellar play, has him in the No. 2 chair right now. That can change if Woll can start stringing some quality starts together. He’s won his last three outings. Max Domi: The first season of Domi’s four-year contract with the Leafs wasn’t going well before an injury knocked him out of the lineup entirely. Domi didn’t score in his first 19 games and had gone the last 13 games without a point. He’s been hurt as much as anyone by the non-existence of a rush attack under Berube. His nine minor penalties are second-most among Leafs. David Kämpf: He was beginning to worm his way into Berube’s Circle of Trust before he became too felled by injury. His penalty-kill duties had increased and Berube was beginning to turn his way for more defensive zone draws. The offence, which was limited to begin with, has completely disappeared, though. Kämpf, who had only one goal less than Domi last year (eight), hasn’t scored this season and has mustered only three assists. Pontus Holmberg: Berube continues to be a believer, even as Holmberg struggles to make an impact. There was hope he could do Kämpf-like things, with more offence, but that hasn’t materialized. Holmberg is averaging less than a shot per game and scored for the first time all season into an empty net on Wednesday night. Ryan Reaves: It hasn’t gone anywhere near as poorly as last fall when the puck kept entering the Leafs net any time he was on the ice, but Reaves’ minutes still weren’t amounting to much before he got suspended for his hit on Darnell Nurse. He had no goals, one assist and only seven shots in 16 games. The puck hasn’t gone in much either way when he’s been out there: two goals for the Leafs, three for the opposition. Nick Robertson: The opportunity has been there for him to carve out a more substantial role, and the Leafs have been desperate for middle-six offence. It just hasn’t happened. Robertson’s lone goal (and point) this season came in the third period of a blowout loss in Columbus. Advertisement Simon Benoit: Not having McCabe by his side sure seems to have hurt Benoit this season, the first of a three-year contract ($1.35 million cap hit). A seat in the press box seemed to spark something in the 26-year-old: He registered a season-high eight hits in his return to the lineup against Vegas. Auston Matthews: Though he wasn’t scoring or defending like usual, it speaks to Matthews’ greatness that the Leafs were still winning his minutes handily at five-on-five. He was also faring well in a major role on the penalty kill. Max Pacioretty: Things were trending up for Pacioretty before he suffered an apparent hamstring injury. He had found a comfy fit next to Nylander and Tavares and was giving the Leafs a much-needed combination of wily offence and physicality. The Leafs need that back whenever he returns. Fraser Minten: He scored his first NHL goal in his season debut on Wednesday. Berube also had him chipping in a little on the penalty kill and gave him a spot on PP1 after Knies was injured. He played almost 16 minutes and won four of his seven draws. With all the injuries at centre, the 20-year-old will get a decent look here in the next week or so to demonstrate whether he’s ready to stick. Connor Dewar: Wednesday was only his fourth game back from offseason shoulder surgery, and first at centre. Jani Hakanpää: It remains to be seen if he can move around well enough after the injuries to play a role for the Leafs. He was a first-time healthy scratch on Wednesday night. Calle Järnkrok: A sneaky-important loss, it remains to be seen when, or if, he’ll play this season after groin and sports hernia surgery. Alex Steeves: There’s opportunity there for him to prove he’s an NHL player. Nikita Grebenkin: He was rambunctious in his NHL debut against Vegas. The fearlessness and physicality, in particular, popped. Advertisement Dennis Hildeby: His first two NHL starts were a mixed bag — one good (a 23-save win in New Jersey), one not so good (six goals against in a loss to Columbus).

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Colorado lands 5-star QB Julian Lewis: What this means for Deion Sanders,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5915821/2024/11/21/colorado-recruiting-deion-sanders-julian-lewis-qb/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:13:52 GMT","Lewis, the No. 35 overall prospect in the Class of 2025 in the 247Sports Composite, had previously been committed to USC.","NCAAF Five-star quarterback Julian “Juju” Lewis committed to Colorado on Thursday. Lewis, the No. 35 overall prospect in the Class of 2025 in the 247Sports Composite, had been committed to USC for more than a year but backed off that pledge on Nov. 17. He visited Colorado last month for the Buffaloes’ win over Cincinnati and took a surprise visit to Georgia last weekend and watched the Bulldogs top Tennessee. He announced his decision on the “Pat McAfee Show.” Advertisement Lewis plays at Carrollton High School, about 50 miles west of Atlanta. His team is 11-0 and will play Valdosta in a state playoff game on Friday night. For the season, Lewis is 200-for-257 passing for 2,842 yards with 40 touchdowns and four interceptions. He is completing 77.8 percent of his passes, a career high and 10 percentage points higher than last season. Colorado doesn’t have an experienced backup quarterback or a plan at the position beyond Shedeur Sanders, who will enter the NFL Draft after this season. Now, Colorado has a plan beyond the next few months, and Lewis would likely be a Day 1 starter in Boulder. It’s also evidence in favor of Deion Sanders staying at Colorado after his sons (Shedeur and Shilo) and Travis Hunter leave. It’s the biggest recruiting win for Sanders since flipping Hunter from Florida State to Jackson State during the early signing period in December 2021. It’s hard to think the on-field fortunes of both teams didn’t have an impact. USC (5-5) has lost four of its last five games and the trajectory for Lincoln Riley’s program has never been worse. The Trojans need to rally just to reach a bowl game. Colorado, meanwhile, has played its way into Big 12 title contention and the College Football Playoff picture with six wins in seven games. Sanders’ stock hasn’t been higher since the Buffaloes’ 3-0 start in 2023 against a trio of teams that ended up missing bowl games. It’s not hard to sell the idea that Lewis could be the key piece in program-building for Sanders moving forward while Riley’s future in a USC program at transition looks far less rosy. — Ubben While Lewis had been committed to USC for nearly a year and a half, he hadn’t shunned interest from other programs. In the spring, he visited some SEC schools as well as Indiana and Colorado. The SEC schools found other quarterbacks, but the Hoosiers and Buffaloes remained persistent. Even though Lewis did visit USC, the fact that he never publicly reaffirmed his commitment to the Trojans and visited other programs certainly raised questions. It basically made the separation inevitable. And USC obviously was not caught off guard. The staff stayed in contact with Husan Longstreet and made a strong — and ultimately successful — push to flip the five-star prospect from his Texas A&M commitment. — Morales (Photo: John David Mercer / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How Josh Metellus became the key to Brian Flores' innovative Vikings defense,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936476/2024/11/21/josh-metellus-vikings-defense-brian-flores/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:01:38 GMT","The versatile 26-year-old is listed as a safety, but he has also lined up at linebacker, slot corner and even on the defensive line.","NFL He wears the perfect number: 44. What type of football player typically wears 44? It feels too high for a safety but too low for a defensive lineman. Linebackers don’t always wear 44. Neither do cornerbacks. If you were to select one position on the football field for the number, it’d probably be a fullback. One of those helmet-smashing, spirit-lifting, lines-up-everywhere types of players. At his core, that’s who Joshua Metellus is for the Minnesota Vikings. Advertisement “Shoot, man,” cornerback Byron Murphy Jr. said recently. “Josh can seriously play every position we have.” That’s not hyperbole. This season, Metellus has played about 40 percent of his snaps at linebacker, 30 percent at slot corner and 16 percent at safety. The rest of the time, he has lined up on the defensive line or out wide against elite receivers. Simply calling Metellus versatile does not do him justice. Next Gen Stats has been around since 2018, and Metellus’ undertaking transcends any role any defender has played since then. He’s one of the NFL’s best pass rushers and run stoppers from the slot. He runs stunts at the line of scrimmage. He plays man coverage against tight ends. He deflects passes, jars the ball loose from ball carriers, blitzes off the edge and drops into underneath zones. This is not a player multitasking just to say he can do it. And defensive coordinator Brian Flores is not asking Metellus to play these different roles simply to say he has a defender who can do it. It is a capable player working with an attentive coach who grasps his potential and is creative enough to construct a role that makes use of that player’s full skill set. Metellus’ football story is as much about the people around him as anything else, an example of what can happen when the right people recognize your biggest attributes. There's not a position @NoExcuses_23 can't play. pic.twitter.com/b76Lyh9u23 — Minnesota Vikings (@Vikings) November 12, 2024  Every coach says he wants to put his players in the best positions to be successful. It’s a lovely thought, but what does that entail? Ask Flores’ opinion, and he’ll say it’s a lot of trial and error. Put a player in a spot or have him move around a certain part of the field. Then watch him. Don’t worry about whether or not he can do it. Worry about whether or not he can do it well. Advertisement “I try to push the limits with players and see how much they can handle,” Flores said. “Normally, we have to pull back a little bit.” Sometimes a player’s size and speed prohibit him from excelling at the task. Other times, the player cannot conceptualize multiple responsibilities at once. Metellus, who was drafted out of Michigan in 2020 and primarily played special teams during his first three seasons in Minnesota, stands 5-foot-11 and weighs 207 pounds. Light enough to cover, but strong enough to play in the box. He also understood Flores’ concepts immediately. Last spring, early in Flores’ time with the Vikings, the coach asked himself to identify the best 11 defensive players. Metellus was one of them. Flores believed the onus fell on him to figure out how to get those 11 players on the field and then decipher who would play where. In one personnel grouping, Flores assigned Metellus to slot corner. In another, Flores positioned Metellus at linebacker. Metellus was shocked when he entered Flores’ office and was told of the coach’s vision for him — not because he didn’t think he could do it, but because he’d found another coach willing to see what he saw in himself. We got all the contacts in our phones 📱 pic.twitter.com/QCwQdnWG5I — Minnesota Vikings (@Vikings) November 12, 2024  Almost a decade earlier, Devin Bush Sr., an NFL safety for the Falcons, Rams and Browns from 1995 to 2002, arrived at a turf field near Miami to watch a seven-on-seven game. Bush was a coach at Flanagan High School in Pembroke Pines, Fla., a suburb north of Miami. That day, with the heat climbing to an uncomfortable level, he could not take his eyes off one of the running backs. It turned out to be Metellus, whom Bush met afterward, and who would ultimately play for him at Flanagan. Bush moved him to safety, but really, Metellus became so much more. He ranged from deep and tackled ball carriers. He lined up across from slot receivers and snatched tipped passes out of the air for interceptions. He did so much of what he was doing now, observing offensive formations, hand-signaling checks at the line of scrimmage, celebrating audibly when the defense excelled. Advertisement Somehow, recruiting websites categorized him as a three-star recruit. “Writers were hyping other people up, and not seeing the skill set,” Bush said. Metellus’ top offers came from South Alabama, Florida International and Middle Tennessee State — until a camp one afternoon at the nearby Dolphins facility. Bush was on the sideline when another former NFL safety, Greg Jackson, then the defensive backs coach at Michigan, approached. “Who is this, Bush?” “Josh Metellus,” he replied. “Look at his movement skills,” Jackson said, “how he can stay square when he’s pedaling.” Bush nodded slowly the way you do when you already know something you’re being told. “I should offer him,” Jackson said. “You won’t regret it,” Bush replied. GO DEEPER Vikings' middling run game makes it abundantly clear — they need help on the interior OL Metellus played as a freshman at Michigan, then replaced current New England Patriots defender Jabrill Peppers at the Wolverines’ “viper” position, a do-it-all spot requiring a player who could understand, communicate and apply a breadth of ideas with 107,000 people hollering their lungs out in Ann Arbor. Two All-Big Ten selections later, the Vikings drafted Metellus for Mike Zimmer’s innovative defensive system. Metellus was mostly stuck on special teams for his first couple of seasons, but in 2022, the Vikings hired Ed Donatell as their defensive coordinator. That system prioritized putting players in specific positions with specific tasks: You start here, and you do X based on Y. Donatell included Metellus in a third-down package, and he filled in admirably for safety Harrison Smith when the veteran missed a game due to a concussion. The next season, Flores’ arrival and open-mindedness altered Metellus’ trajectory. But Flores said his ideas would be worth nothing without Metellus’ retention. “With Josh, pulling back (on the complexity) was not the problem,” Flores said. “We had to add more.” .@horribleharry99: Josh, I need an INT@noexcuses_23: I got you 📺: https://t.co/jqOKdIvMuj pic.twitter.com/ds12XSyCiU — Minnesota Vikings (@Vikings) September 20, 2024  Metellus’ understanding of what the Vikings defense is trying to do has countless benefits beyond the flexibility and interchangeable game planning he allows Flores. Metellus can fill in everywhere in the event of an injury to a starter, limiting the level of drop-off. If a young defender like Dwight McGlothern has questions, he can ask Metellus, who has the acumen to explain the ideas simply. Advertisement There is a reason Metellus, still just 26, is the man in the middle of the team-wide pregame huddle each Sunday, revving up his teammates with a speech. They respect his willingness to apply his services wherever they’re needed. They know the years he spent waiting for a role and a time like this, a time Vikings fans are wearing his No. 44 jersey in droves because of the impact he always knew he could make. “Josh is as valuable a player on the roster as we have,” Flores said.

""He deserves that. We think the world of him.""","NBA This will be Hubie Brown’s last year broadcasting games for ESPN. ESPN President Burke Magnus revealed the news Thursday while on the Sports Illustrated Media Podcast with Jimmy Traina. “We are going to give Hubie one last shot on a game,” Magnus said. “He deserves that. We think the world of him. I think it is absolutely remarkable the level in which he still calls games at age 90-plus. I don’t mean to be purposely mysterious here but we are going to honor Hubie during the regular season at some point to be determined and send him off in style.” Advertisement ESPN declined additional comment Thursday to The Athletic. Brown is not scheduled to call any games but industry sources said he will be assigned one last game this season. The date of the assignment has not been formalized yet. Brown is expected to partner with longtime ESPN/ABC play-by-play broadcaster Mike Breen for the game. Brown, who turned 91 in September, has had one of the most extraordinary careers in basketball. He coached Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson, coached against Kobe Bryant and LeBron James, and called games featuring Giannis Antetokounmpo and Victor Wembanyama. Brown got his start in broadcasting during the 1981-82 season when he teamed up with Al Albert on the USA Network after he was fired as head coach of the Atlanta Hawks. There were coaching returns along the way (five years with the New York Knicks, from 1982-87, and three with the Memphis Grizzlies, from 2002-05), but Brown has essentially been a soundtrack for the NBA for five decades. When the Knicks fired Brown in 1987, he became a full-time analyst for CBS and then moved over to TNT in 1990 when CBS lost NBA broadcasting rights. “I don’t think I’m 90 years old,” Brown told The Athletic last year when we named him Media Person of The Year. “I never get up in the morning and say, ‘Geez, I’m 90 years old. What am I going to do today?’ I’m 90 years old, and I come downstairs and I get my manila pad out, and I have a list of all the things I’m going to do today. Then, at night, I have a list of which games I’m going to watch. Then, during the games, I’m going to pick out certain things I’m interested in. It’s always the love of the game for me.” Dave Pasch, one of the many play-by-play broadcasters Brown has worked with over the years, said Brown never lost his passion for calling games. Advertisement “He does two things during commercial breaks that obviously the audience isn’t privy to,” Pasch said. “First, he regularly asks me if I am getting enough time to call the game, how things sound and if we are working in tandem. Hubie is an incredible teammate. We spend a decent amount of time together off the air and normally have dinner the night before the game. He treats me like I am part of his family, and that comes through in our communication on game day. The second thing Hubie does is point out important stats on the box score that stand out to him. It helps me as his broadcast partner because it gives me a sense of what is important to him, where to lead him, or to reemphasize later in the broadcast.” Brown had worked about 15 games each season between 2020 and 2023 for ESPN/ABC. He worked mostly on one-year contracts as ESPN kept extending him. (Photo: Mitchell Leff / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Sign up here to receive The Windup directly in your inbox. It’s awards week! Plus: The trades have begun, follow-ups on our stories from Monday and Ken fills us in on the Dodgers’ interest in Willy Adames. I’m Levi Weaver, here with Ken Rosenthal. Welcome to The Windup! It’s all official except for MVP (which … it’s not like any surprises await us tonight, which will be Ohtani/Judge night). Here’s a catch-up on the BBWAA awards so far): More BBWAA awards: Andrew Baggarly makes a convincing argument for adding a new “Reliever of the Year” award. From my latest notes column: The Los Angeles Dodgers’ decision to return Mookie Betts to the infield prompted immediate speculation about the team signing free-agent shortstop Willy Adames and trading second baseman Gavin Lux. That, however, isn’t necessarily the team’s plan. Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman has long admired Adames, whom he acquired for the Tampa Bay Rays at the 2014 trade deadline as part of a package for David Price. But Friedman rarely pays sticker price for elite talent, with Yoshinobu Yamamoto standing as a notable exception last offseason, in part because he was turning 25. Lest anyone forget, the Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman contracts all include significant deferrals. Advertisement With Ha-Seong Kim recovering from shoulder surgery, Adames is by far the top shortstop in this year’s market. The demand for him at 29 should be high, and while Adames might not be as coveted as other recent free-agent shortstops, he surely expects a significant contract. And the decline in his defensive metrics last season raises the possibility that he might not be at short for the duration of his agreement. Lux, who turns 27 Friday, is a former first-round pick to whom the Dodgers remained loyal even as he struggled coming off major knee surgery in the first half of last season. He responded with an .899 OPS after the All-Star break. His 2.0 fWAR in that period was equal to that of Matt Olson and Brent Rooker, and better than that of teammate Teoscar Hernández and free-agent third baseman Alex Bregman. And Lux remains affordable, projecting to earn less than $3 million in arbitration. Of course, if Lux remains the primary second baseman, then Betts likely will return to shortstop, with Tommy Edman in center and Miguel Rojas serving in a utility role. Betts was below-average defensively at short last season, but most of his issues stemmed from his throwing, which he might be able to solve with a full offseason and spring training. Another possibility is for the Dodgers to indeed trade Lux, play Betts at second, Tommy Edman at short and a combination of Andy Pages and James Outman in center. The bottom line: Friedman does not need to lock into Adames when his greater needs are in the outfield and rotation. Friedman relishes keeping his options open. And as usual, he has numerous ways he can go. More here. It’s not as frenetic as the end of July, but as the holidays (and Winter Meetings) bear down, we’ve had a few trades of note this week. There have been a few developments in some of the stories we told you about on Monday, so here’s a quick rundown: Roki Sasaki will be part of the 2025 international class. Commissioner Rob Manfred confirmed this yesterday, which tracks with what we told you: A bit more money will be available if teams wait until Jan. 15. But as Ken points out, it’s not like that money is coming from nowhere. Whichever team signs Sasaki will be doing so by backing out of agreements (technically unofficial, since they’re illegal) with other international free agents. The system is clearly broken, and it’s long past time to fix it. Advertisement Rays stadium deal in peril: Sam Blum has written a more thorough story on all the factors surrounding the now-tenuous deal for a new stadium for the Rays in St. Petersburg. However it’s going to work out, it needs to be soon-ish: Manfred said this week that he expects them to have a solution in place by around this time next year. (Manfred also said that this situation does not change the league’s desire to expand in the next four years.) MLB plans new national TV packages for 2028: In light of the recently finalized plan for Diamond Sports to emerge from bankruptcy, Manfred said on Tuesday that the league has a goal in mind: to have a new national TV package ready to go by 2028, so they can sell a blackout-free package — whether that be via the MLB’s own streaming service or to a streaming distributor. What’s standing in the way? Goodness, it’s a cornucopia of complication, ranging from existing contracts to the CBA. Fortunately, Evan Drellich is on the case. Juan Soto’s free-agent roundtable continues: The Dodgers are the latest to meet with agent Scott Boras, joining the Blue Jays, Red Sox, Mets and Yankees. Jim Bowden takes a crack at predicting where Soto will end up. Wanna vote on the Hall of Fame? It’s not an official ballot, but you can cast yours anyway in our reader survey.

But Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen was back in net after missing two games with an injury, and he was Buffalo’s most important player. He stopped all 24 shots he faced, and 10 of those shots were high-danger shots, according to Natural Stat Trick. Advertisement Luukkonen helped the Sabres steal two points and get back to a .500 points percentage with a 9-9-1 record. The Sabres now have the fourth best points percentage in the Atlantic Division and are tied for the eighth best points percentage in the Eastern Conference. So far this season, the Sabres are 0-4 in games when they have a chance to get above .500. A back-to-back against the Ducks and Sharks on Friday and Saturday should present a prime opportunity to get over .500 for the first time this season There are still a lot of big-picture questions with this team, and we’re going to explore some of those in this mailbag. I’ll add some of the leftover questions into future columns as well. Note: Submitted questions may be edited for clarity and style. I think many of us are disappointed in Dahlin’s play this year. So many defensive lapses and silly plays. As someone much closer to the players than we are, is the sense that his dip is due to the stress of having the “C” on his sweater, the change in strategy with Ruff or the randomness of life and he’s going to return to his near-Norris level of ability? — Eric J. Rasmus Dahlin is back to creating offense for the Sabres, an aspect of his game that was missing while he worked his way back from injury early in the season. He has a seven-game point streak and 17 points in 19 games. But the mental mistakes, whether it’s lack of composure leading to penalties or missed assignments in the defensive zone, have been glaring. Dahlin cares a lot about making this team a winner. Sometimes too much. He’s easily frustrated, which has led to penalties. And he puts a ton of pressure on himself. So I do think he’s been adjusting to the added pressure of having the “C” on his jersey. The change in system and his training camp injury didn’t help. I don’t know how Ruff can get through to him about keeping his composure and not taking penalties. That feels like something Dahlin will either learn in time or will be a struggle throughout his career. If he can figure it out, he could reach his Norris-caliber ceiling. Advertisement If Lindy cannot get the most out of Owen Power, what’s next? — Charles P. Owen Power turns 22 on Friday, so it’s still early to hit the panic button on him. But some of the concerns are valid. The good news is he has 13 points in 19 games. The bad news is he’s been inconsistent, especially defensively, and still hasn’t evolved into a player who can effectively use his size to consistently out-muscle opponents in front of his team’s net. Hockey Stat Cards tracks players’ game scores throughout the season based on Dom’s model. Power has two of the Sabres’ three worst individual games this season but also has the team’s best game. That feels like it sums up Power’s season. He can be a good defender without laying huge hits all the time. But he needs to play stronger in 50-50 puck battles and in clearing the front of the net. Otherwise, he won’t be an $8.3 million defenseman. Power obviously would still hold a lot of trade value around the league as a recent No. 1 pick and the type of puck-moving defenseman teams like to build around. He has the potential to be a No. 1 power play quarterback, but he doesn’t have a path to that job in Buffalo. If general manager Kevyn Adams wanted to shake up this roster in a major way, Power would be one of the team’s most valuable trade chips. I just think the team would prefer Ruff to help him reach his full potential. If he hits his ceiling, Power can become one of those players that’s not easy to acquire. Cozens for Zegras: who says no? — Bob O. I think the Sabres would still say no on that one. The internal belief in Dylan Cozens as a two-way center is still strong. He’s been playing better since a slow start, though the production is still lagging behind where it should be. That said, I would have plenty of interest in a Trevor Zegras trade. When I watch him, I still see a player with a ton of ability to drive offense. He clearly doesn’t have the same spark he did a few seasons ago, but that’s why his name is even being thrown around in trade rumors. He can play both center and wing and has a reasonable contract at $5.75 million for one more season after this one before he becomes a restricted free agent. He also doesn’t have a no-trade clause. Would he be thrilled about playing in Buffalo? Who knows? But he is from the East Coast and Sabres assistant Seth Appert coached him with USA Hockey. If Zegras is truly available, it’s the type of calculated risk Adams should be willing to take at this stage of Buffalo’s build. He’s 23 and only two years removed from back-to-back 60-point seasons. How much confidence do you have in Kevyn Adams making a significant move(s) to improve this team before it’s too late? — Tom T. Adams has been willing to trade in recent years, so I’m confident something will happen at some point. The question is how significant a move he makes. I would categorize the Casey Mittelstadt for Bowen Byram trade as a significant move, although it was one that also resulted in a major subtraction from the forward group. The Ryan McLeod trade was significant given Matt Savoie’s status as a top-10 pick, and McLeod has made a strong impact. So has Jason Zucker, a summer free-agent signing who has four goals and nine assists in 19 games including the game-winner against the Kings on Wednesday. But it feels like this team still needs a top-six forward and a playing partner for Power. Those are needs that would have been better addressed at some point in the last two seasons. But there are still options if Adams wants to upgrade this roster. The team is sitting on $7.2 million in cap space. No other team in the Eastern Conference playoff race has close to that much money to spend. Adams also has more prospects and picks to trade than most teams. There isn’t much of an excuse to not make an addition to this roster at some point. And it’s clear that more upgrades are needed. This does lead us to our next question, though. Why does Kevyn Adams still have a job? They’re not tracking for a playoff position, so the worst possible scenario looms: no longer concerned with “winning the Stanley Cup”, but instead worrying solely about keeping his job next year, this horribly failing GM goes all-in at the trade deadline and destroys whatever’s left of the prospect pool and future draft picks in a useless and utterly improbable “heroic run for the eighth seed” that will of course fall short. Why is Pegula even risking this? Why not fire him now before he goes scorched Earth and leaves nothing for the next GM? — Matthew D. Given how long it took Terry Pegula to fire Don Granato, I’m not sure whether he would be willing to fire Adams in season. The Sabres are still flirting with playoff contention and as long as that’s true, Pegula won’t make changes. But your point is a fair one. A lot of questions in the mailbag were about trades and what could be done to shake up this roster. Pegula now has Ruff, someone he trusts and considers a friend, to give a sober, honest look at the state of the team. Is a major roster shake-up justified? Which core players should be moved? Those are questions he can now ask Ruff. If they decide to go in the direction of a significant shake-up, the next question Pegula should ask is whether Adams should be the one executing those trades. His track record is mixed at best. The Jack Eichel trade doesn’t look great. Neither does the Sam Reinhart deal. The Sabres need to be careful about pressing the panic button and making a desperate trade. I wouldn’t worry too much about that at this point, though. I don’t think it’s in Adams’ nature to go scorched earth. He cares about this team, the players and the city. He also wants to do right by Pegula, who has put a lot of faith in him over the last five years. But desperation can cloud the decision-making process, and that’s something Adams needs to be careful about. We’ve read reports that Adams is trying to put a big trade together to overhaul this roster. At this point, I don’t see any “untouchables” on this roster or in this organization. Do you? — Ralph S. In the right deal, anyone on the Sabres’ roster should be available. This core hasn’t won anything, so Adams should be open to anything. That said, the closest two players to untouchable are Thompson and Dahlin. Thompson has a reasonable contract and has shown star potential. He’s Buffalo’s best player, so any trade would have to be a no-brainer. Dahlin has been inconsistent, but we’ve also seen how good he can be at his best. You need stars to win, and Dahlin has that potential. He’s got a long-term contract and is the captain of the team. Advertisement Beyond those two, I’d be open to the idea of the Sabres moving just about any player on the roster. Players like JJ Peterka and Zach Benson would be close to that untouchable tier. But until this core proves it can win, you have to at least listen to the offers to understand the market value of your players. If the Sabres don’t make the playoffs, which odds favor, what’s Lindy’s future? I can’t imagine Terry Pegula wants to pay another coach who isn’t behind the bench. Does he transition to a front-office role, asked to “retire,” etc? Seriously do not know where this franchise goes from here if they need to blow things up again. — Austin Z. I don’t think Pegula would consider firing Ruff after just one season even if they miss the playoffs. Given the patience he showed with previous coaches, he owes some patience to Ruff, who is working with a roster he only recently had a hand in building and trying to break young players of poor habits. If they miss the playoffs, it’s not a coaching issue. But the question about what happens if Pegula does decide changes are necessary is a prudent one. The Sabres appear to be grooming Seth Appert to be Ruff’s heir apparent one day. He’s filled in for Ruff in some media availabilities, something no assistants did under Granato. But it feels like any transition would be contingent on Adams still being the one who makes decisions. If Ruff has the appetite for it, a transition to the front office would suit him given the strong relationships he has around the league and his eye for talent. If the Sabres don’t make the playoffs, none of the potential solutions are clean or simple. But it would be tough to justify the status quo. That doesn’t mean they need to blow things up again, but letting Adams have a sixth season wouldn’t sit well with a fan base that has already become fed up with waiting for postseason hockey. Hence the pressure on Adams to get this season right. (Photo of Alex Tuch and Trevor Zegras: Bill Wippert / NHLI via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Sign up here to receive it directly in your inbox. Good morning. Today, we’re talking QB improvement, something that has long eluded the Bears (but perhaps not for much longer, with Thomas Brown as OC, as Kevin Fishbain explains here). The Athletic’s Jeff Howe is the master of quarterback rankings. With Russell Wilson and Sam Darnold ending 2023 on the bench, we all agreed with Jeff’s Week 1 stock report, which ranked both veterans among the league’s worst QBs. Along came a 2024 revival. After four starts, Darnold was 4-0 and 13th in Jeff’s rankings. He’s now 18th, one spot behind Wilson, who is a similar 4-0 across his first four starts. Advertisement The parallels continue. Both are backed by top-10 defenses that ease the pressure on the offense. And both are working with offensive coordinators who maximize strengths. They also each have a just-throw-it-up No. 1 receiver. Justin Jefferson in Minnesota and George Pickens in Pittsburgh respectively rank second and fourth in receiving yards this season. There’s room for error. Wilson and Darnold are also on one-year contracts, suggesting they’ll headline the 2025 free agent quarterback class. The obvious question lingers: Are Wilson and Darnold better quarterbacks than they had been lately, or just in better situations? Let’s quickly look at both, comparing this season with their two most recent previous years in which they started 10-plus games. By most objective measures, the 35-year-old is a similar player to 2023 (when he wasn’t bad in Denver!). His QBR, passer rating, completion percentage and adjusted net yards per pass attempt all resemble his time there.  The tape shows Pittsburgh’s run-first, play-action offense looks similar to Wilson’s early years in Seattle and is perfectly suited to his strengths, including his patented moonball. But it’s not all positive. In his four starts, the Steelers have produced a touchdown on only 38.9 percent of their red zone opportunities. As Mike DeFabo notes in his look into why Pittsburgh is struggling there, Wilson has completed 68 percent of his passes outside the red zone, but that figure drops to 29.2 percent inside the 20. (Perhaps that’s where Justin Fields comes in? We’ll see tonight, when the Steelers visit the Browns at 8:15 p.m. ET on Amazon Prime.) Even if Wilson fails to improve near the goal line, in his 13th season, he is an effective starter. That’s probably it, but it’s all Pittsburgh’s defense (and kicker) need. As Jeff wrote, “They’re putting him in good situations and not asking him to play beyond his means, which is exactly how it should be.” Advertisement Darnold doesn’t have Wilson’s career accolades, but the 27-year-old has the pedigree of a former No. 3 overall pick, which is one reason he’s continued to get chances despite seeing ghosts. Objectively, his last two years as a full-time starter (2020-2021) were nowhere near his impressive 2024. His numbers have all significantly improved:  This isn’t a case where the numbers fail to align with what Darnold looks like in action. You’d be hard pressed to find any stretch from 2018 to 2022 when he looked this confident throwing the football. But after a stretch that evoked years past — five interceptions in Weeks 9 and 10 — his penchant for turnovers (10 INTs, fourth-most) remains a glaring flaw. He’s become a better version of Sam Darnold, which is good for a league-average QBR (and an 8-2 record, thanks to an elite supporting cast). It’s reasonable to assume Darnold’s arm talent and athleticism, along with his 2024 team’s win-loss record, will intrigue some of the 12 teams with potential QB openings in 2025. Many will be deciding between Darnold, Wilson and prospects like Shedeur Sanders and Cam Ward. But those teams should remember: Even a QB with Wilson’s resume still needs the right surroundings. Bears fans, for once, there is good news: The change at offensive coordinator, with Thomas Brown replacing Shane Waldron, has given this team a boost. In Brown’s first game as a play-caller, last weekend’s nail-biter loss to Green Bay, Caleb Williams completed 74 percent of his passes, a more than 20 percentage point increase over his three previous games. One of the most significant changes has been improved communication during the game, particularly when it comes to the speed at which plays are called. The 4-6 Bears haven’t resolved all their issues, but believe they are better on offense. As Williams put it: “We’re going to have that mindset to go out there and kick some tail.” Chicago will need that mindset, with the 8-2 Vikings on Sunday and 9-1 Lions days later on Thanksgiving. 🎧 ICYMI from the “Scoop City” podcast: Are the Giants trying to tank? When Sean Payton announced his Week 1 starter, we learned that Bo Nix was set to become the first rookie QB to start for the Broncos since John Elway. It only added to the expectations for this year’s No. 12 pick, but he’s exceeded them all. As we enter Week 12, Nix has played an equal amount of games as Elway — a first overall pick — did in his rookie year (11), giving us a level playing field to compare the two. (Of course, we must factor in the differing play style in 1983 and the fact that Elway often split games with Steve DeBerg.) A blind sample of the stats would suggest we’re looking at one future superstar and one struggling rookie:  Obviously, that goes to show: A lot can and will change. Still, great start. Success wasn’t immediate for Nix, however. His career started 0-2, with zero touchdowns, four interceptions and a completion rate in the 50s. But everything has changed since the season’s first four games, which Payton referred to as “a race to improve.” Nick Kosmider provides perspective on Nix after the the 24-year-old’s best performance yet (307 yards and four touchdowns on Sunday against Atlanta): “Since the start of October, a span of seven games, Nix is completing 69 percent of his passes. He has thrown 13 touchdowns and only two interceptions — and he’s rushed for two more scores. He has posted a 106.3 passer rating. The only quarterbacks in the same statistical ballpark during that span: Jared Goff, Baker Mayfield and Joe Burrow.” Nick also previously explained the improvements he’s seen from Nix. Here’s one that stood out: “Nix has taken a big leap as an intermediate passer. Since Week 5, he is completing passes between 5 and 15 yards beyond the line of scrimmage at a mark that is top-10 in the NFL. His completion rate on those throws through the first four games of the season was 37.5 percent, which ranked last out of 33 qualified passers.” Sean Payton has played a crucial role, scheming open receivers to make life easier for Nix. His recent work with Marvin Mims is a prime example of what has Nix on track to become the best rookie quarterback in Broncos history. After that, a spot next to Elway would more than suffice. Yesterday, we looked at the seeming decline of the superstar cornerback, and I asked you if we will see a return of the star corner. According to nearly 40 percent of votes, “they never left,” with Jalen Ramsey and Pat Surtain II holding it down in today’s game. The yes/no votes were split an equal 24 percent each, signaling that the status quo is the expectation moving forward. Welcome to HarBowl Week. Vic Tafur picks all the weekend’s games, including the John vs. Jim brothers brawl. It’s somehow in the game. Saquon Barkley’s backward hurdle is now in Madden. Seems annoying. Benching the GOAT? The Ravens don’t plan to sit the struggling Justin Tucker. Yesterday’s most-clicked: Why Jets GM Joe Douglas never stood a chance. 📫 Enjoyed this read?

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"The Maple Leafs' Nikita Grebenkin experience is now underway, and he's coming in hot",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5937200/2024/11/21/maple-leafs-nikita-grebenkin-nhl/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 15:53:31 GMT","With injuries ravaging the Leafs, the 2020 fifth-round pick made his NHL debut in Wednesday's 3-0 win over the Golden Knights.","NHL Nikita Grebenkin pulled a mess of long, curly hair away from his face to reveal a toothless grin. It leaves little doubt about who he is and where he’s at right now: Brimming with the utmost confidence. Two weeks before he was called up to the NHL for the first time on Wednesday, Grebenkin was a Toronto Marlie. He was asked how he could improve his hard-charging and fearless game. He whipped out his phone to feed the question into a translation app. Advertisement “I am a professional,” he said, pointing at his phone. Grebenkin’s English skills are a work in progress. Five months ago, the Leafs got him a tutor. His effort is admirable. Every sentence he creates carries weight. The winger didn’t take long to review the question. Grebenkin typed his answer in Russian without hesitation. When you are around Grebenkin, you better get ready to hear the brutal truth, as he sees it. He practically shoved his phone in my face with his answer translated into English. “I am ready for the NHL.” There it was again, that same toothless grin. The Grebenkin experience is underway in full for the Toronto Maple Leafs. It’s the smallest of sample sizes, but Grebenkin certainly looked ready to be an NHL player in his debut. The 2022 fifth-round draft pick is a throwback player: Full of swagger, unafraid to speak his mind and ready to be daring on and off the ice. With injuries ravaging the Leafs, they turned to Grebekin ahead of schedule. But you wouldn’t know it, based on how he played on Wednesday: He landed four hits, second only to Simon Benoit. In just 10:04 of five-on-five ice time, the Leafs easily won those minutes with a 78 percent expected goals share. Grebenkin never stopped moving and creating chances shift to shift. He added 1:01 TOI on the power play. Crucially, the Leafs beat the Vegas Golden Knights 3-0. “If we don’t win, I won’t enjoy it,” Grebenkin said before his debut. “If we win, I’ll enjoy it.” Part of the reason for the hype surrounding Grebenkin is the Leafs don’t have another prospect like him in their system: Built like a truck and able to run over opposition defenders while maintaining control of the puck. Blessed with a heavy and accurate shot and driven by a thick 6-foot-2, 210-pound frame. Ceaselessly daring with the puck in the offensive zone, taking the kind of chances that might excite and frustrate onlookers all the same. Unafraid to drop the mitts in his first preseason game and hype up a crowd seconds afterward. Nikita Grebyonkin gets into a tilt with Adam Gaudette and then tries to get the crowd fired up.Love it pic.twitter.com/bAOD0Uwqyo — Rink Rat Report (@RinkRatReport) September 23, 2024  The kind of player who, through 13 AHL games and now one NHL game, is impossible to take your eyes off. You never quite know what’s going to happen, but you know you’re going to be entertained. This season’s Marlies are stacked with an array of young, talented skaters and Leafs draft picks they haven’t had in seasons past, including Roni Hirvonen, Topi Niemela and Ryan Tverberg. Advertisement But none offer the high-end, sometimes dazzling upside Grebenkin has. “A lot of tools,” Marlies head coach John Gruden said of Grebenkin, before raising his eyes knowingly. “He’s not afraid to get engaged.” After winning a KHL championship with Metallurg Magnitogorsk last season, Grebenkin signed his entry-level contract with the Leafs. It’s worth remembering Grebenkin is in his first North American professional season. So far, the production is there: Grebenkin’s 0.77 points per game is 10th among regular AHL rookies. Yes, his numbers are juiced by some exemplary work on the man advantage: Three of his four goals have come on the power play. And Grebenkin is shooting at an outlandish 22 percent. All but one AHL rookie who has found the back of the net as much as Grebenkin has logged more shots. Some midseason regression feels likely. But that regression is not what the Leafs are concerned about right now. They need warm bodies. And Grebenkin is coming in hot. That much was evident in his NHL debut. His willingness to be physical, skate heavily to force turnovers and be aggressive in the offensive zone is tailor-made for the kind of hockey coach Craig Berube and general manager Brad Treliving want to play. “(Grebenkin did) all the things I thought he was going to do,” Berube said. Grebenkin gets back to deflect the pass pic.twitter.com/9S0aGhROsy — Omar (@TicTacTOmar) November 21, 2024  Grebenkin is never short on energy. But harnessing that energy and using his skill set to be effective within a team structure? That could be the difference between a player bouncing up and down between the AHL and the NHL and one sticking in the latter. Once the Leafs roster features more healthy forwards than those battling injuries, Grebenkin could return to the AHL for more seasoning. Advertisement “(Grebenkin) has just got to continue to understand things don’t happen overnight. You need to continue to work on those habits and keep being a better version of yourself every day. It seems like he wants it, which is great. He’s always asking things,” Gruden said. Before his call-up, the Marlies identified the need for Grebenkin to become more consistent in his game, to smooth out how much he stops and starts on the ice and become better with transitional plays when going from defence to offence. “Sometimes players will drift a little bit out of position,” Gruden said. “He’s working on it.” What Grebenkin can do in his first North American professional season will go a long way to dictate what kind of NHL potential he has in the short term. Compared to the other crop of Leafs prospects in the AHL, Grebenkin might possess the most potential but also the most room for improvement. “My team in Russia didn’t like to play in the (defensive zone). And I didn’t either. But I understand that in the NHL, you have to like it,” Grebenkin said. “I’ve stayed in Canada for five months and I’m understanding hockey in Canada.” When Grebenkin spoke to The Athletic, he was fresh off a day off. He drove 45 minutes away from his Liberty Village condo to spend his entire day soaking up a taste of home: a Russian bath, complete with a sauna, cold tub plunges and a type of Venik massage — during which a bundle of leafy branches are used to remove dead skin — that the BBC called “not for the faint-hearted.” Does the massage hurt? “Oh yeah,” he said, before breaking out into laughter. Nikita Grebenkin is already learning so much in the NHL 😂 pic.twitter.com/Qr4I0mmgSp — TSN (@TSN_Sports) November 21, 2024    Asked what he likes about living in Toronto, Grebenkin answered quickly. “My house,” he said before his same piercing laugh echoed off the Ford Performance Centre walls. “I’ve never stayed in a big city. My city in Russia is very small.” Grebenkin lives alone, so when he can socialize, he will. He’s fond of paintball. Whether it was with former Marlie goalie Vyacheslav Peksa or Russian friends visiting earlier this season, he never turns down a chance to play with large groups. Advertisement “It’s a hard game. It’s painful,” he said, grinning. Slowly, he is getting more comfortable leaving his home. “Every week, I go to The Keg,” he said. “Big steak and escargot. A long time ago, I never had escargot. But now, I like it.” The night before his NHL debut, he went out for dinner with former Leaf and current Golden Knights goalie Ilya Samsonov. They both came up in the Metallurg system in Russia. “(Grebenkin) is ready, and he is excited,” Samsonov said. That excitement could last longer than anticipated. Matthew Knies left the game after taking a high hit from the Golden Knights’ Zach Whitecloud and did not return. It’s possible he is added to the list of forwards who will miss time. That could mean Grebenkin’s experience in the NHL continues a little longer. “I am working every day,” he said with sincerity weeks before his debut. “On my days off, I am working. I am waiting for my chance in the NHL.” Grebenkin doesn’t have to wait any longer. And if his full-throttle on and off-ice persona is any indication, he’s going to do a lot with that chance.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Giannis Antetokounmpo's huge third quarter in win over Bulls leaves teammates speechless,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936870/2024/11/21/giannis-antetokounmpo-dominance-bucks-bulls/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 15:40:35 GMT",Antetokounmpo's dominance on offense has the Bucks optimistic again after a 2-8 start. They have now won four of the last five games.,"NBA MILWAUKEE — Following a 122-106 win over the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday, Milwaukee Bucks center Brook Lopez provided an exasperated response to one fact about the game. “I don’t know what you want me to say anymore,” Lopez said, shaking his head at his locker. The same fact about the Bucks’ third-quarter performance drew disbelief from shooting guard AJ Green. Advertisement “In the third?” Green asked. “Geez.” What was the fact that left them incredulous? Lopez and Green were reacting to finding out Giannis Antetokounmpo had scored 25 of the Bucks’ 29 points in the third quarter, the most recent example of Antetokounmpo’s dominance. Lopez and Green smiled and laughed as they reflected on the moments of absurdity that can come from playing with one of the best players on the planet. “It’s amazing,” Green said. “It’s incredible. I mean, I didn’t even realize that. He carried us throughout that third quarter because we kind of had a rough start to the third and that’s where he carried us. He did what he does.” “Obviously, Giannis was just, S-Tier, just the best player on the planet leading us through that third quarter,” Lopez added. “And we need him to do that and he’s always been there for us.” Giannis had 25 of the 29 points in the third quarter. S Tier. Best player on the planet. pic.twitter.com/54VvH2uKZ4 — Milwaukee Bucks (@Bucks) November 21, 2024  On the night, Antetokounmpo scored 41 points on 17-of-24 shooting — his 21st career game with at least 40 points with a 70 percent field goal percentage or better, the most in NBA history — and also added nine rebounds and eight assists, but his third quarter is what stood out in Wednesday’s win. The Bulls did not have an answer for Antetokounmpo, who scored 32 points in the paint on Wednesday. “He has that ability,” Bucks head coach Doc Rivers said. “Just attacking downhill. He came into the game to try to be a facilitator and that’s good, but we want him to do that and stay aggressive at the same time. And I thought he turned it on then.” Throughout this season, the Bucks have struggled at the start of the second half, especially in games where they have a halftime lead. More often than not, Rivers has been forced to take the first timeout of the second half as the Bucks have come out flat or uninspired. Antetokounmpo scored four quick points to start the third, but the Bucks still had a familiar lull, forcing Rivers to take that timeout. Out of that stoppage, Rivers drew up an easy play to get Antetokounmpo moving downhill toward the rim. Damian Lillard, who put up 20 points, five rebounds and 10 assists on Wednesday, has the option to work in the pick-and-roll with Lopez on this play, but this is a look the Bucks have been using as far back as the fourth game of the season against the Boston Celtics. With so much attention on Lillard and Lopez, Antetokounmpo was given an easy runway to the rim. A few plays later, off a missed tip-in from Bulls forward Josh Giddey, Lillard found Antetokounmpo running down the middle of the floor in space. “I think Dame helped me a lot,” Antetokounmpo said of his big third quarter performance. “In the second half, I got the ball a lot in transition. Dame feed me two, three times in transition. I was able to attack and get some easy ones.” But Antetokounmpo’s third quarter dominance was not only about getting out in transition. The veteran forward also dominated in half-court settings as the Bulls struggled to find anyone big enough or strong enough to put up the necessary resistance to keep him from getting to the rim. Advertisement When the Bulls opted to use Julian Phillips, a 198-pound forward who recently turned 21 years old, as Antetokounmpo’s primary defender to close out the third quarter, the Bucks attacked the mismatch relentlessly. “Then I went to the post and then I took my dribble, my crab dribble and I saw they wasn’t coming, so in the moment I felt that, it was like, ‘OK. It’s an opportunity for me to go,'” Antetokounmpo said. “And I was able to get in the paint, make some plays for myself or for my teammates.” There were moments where the Bucks executed well and constructed smart half-court looks, like this high-low post entry pass from Bobby Portis. But there were also times when Antetokounmpo was simply just too much for Phillips to handle down low. While much of third quarter was about his scoring, Antetokounmpo also assisted on the lone Bucks’ basket scored by someone else: a huge, momentum-building corner 3 by Green who had 18 points and was 5 of 7 from 3. “It could go the other way,” Antetokounmpo said about the counter to his third quarter aggressiveness. “If I felt like they were coming, then I gotta pick them apart. I gotta be smart.” In the end, Antetokounmpo’s third-quarter takeover carried the Bucks through a third-quarter rough patch and allowed them to stay in control, leading Milwaukee to blow out the Bulls and win comfortably in the fourth quarter. After a 2-8 start to the season, the Bucks have won four of the last five games. During this recent successful stretch, Antetokounmpo has regularly shown off an ability to be a facilitator and a dominant scorer. And while those abilities are not new, the last five games have seen Antetokounmpo seemingly pick the way he is going to control the game and lean into the strengths of those two different identities better than ever before. Advertisement At the start of this five-game stretch, Antetokounmpo tallied 22 potential assists in a 99-85 win over the Toronto Raptors. The following night, he scored 59 points against the Detroit Pistons. In a one-point loss to the Charlotte Hornets on Saturday, Antetokounmpo again looked to dominate with the pass and tallied 12 assists. On Wednesday night, he started the game looking to pass and get his teammates involved before taking over as a scorer in the second half. How has he been able to flip between his two offensive personalities, he was asked? “I’m selfless enough to do that,” Antetokounmpo said. “There’s going to be days that I gotta score the ball. There’s going to be days that I don’t have to score the ball, I gotta move the ball. You gotta be willing to do it. If you’re not willing to do it, it’s not going to be out there on the court for you to see. “Every game, it switches, but you’ve gotta be willing to do both. You know, there’s going to be some times that Dame’s gotta score 40. There’s going to be times that he has to get 15 assists. That’s what winning basketball is.” What makes Antetokounmpo so impressive at this point in his career is not just his willingness to be able to dominate games as both a passer and a scorer, it’s that he can pull it off and he knows which nights call for which approach. If teams are going to send double- and triple-teams his way, he is talented enough as a passer to pick them apart. If teams choose to use a big-bodied defender to try to play him one-on-one, Antetokounmpo will score more efficiently than anyone else in the NBA. Here is today’s exchange with Bucks coach Doc Rivers in regards to the latest on Khris Middleton: pic.twitter.com/dqER6qMTNA — Eric Nehm (@eric_nehm) November 20, 2024  Whatever the game calls for, Antetokounmpo can provide. Thus far this season, with Khris Middleton still sidelined and working towards feeling comfortable enough to play five-on-five, each game has called for Antetokounmpo to provide quite a bit. Until more reinforcements arrive, he will need to continue to leave teammates in awe if the Bucks are to climb out of their early-season hole.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,USA out of Davis Cup: Australia beats Bob Bryan's team after surprise doubles pick,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5937718/2024/11/21/usa-davis-cup-out-australia-doubles-pick/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 15:31:30 GMT",Doubles selection controversy has again overshadowed Team USA's Davis Cup after a defeat to Australia,"Tennis MALAGA, Spain — Team USA captain Bob Bryan has insisted that he “wouldn’t change a thing” after his selection gamble backfired spectacularly in a 2-1 Davis Cup quarterfinal defeat to Australia. At 1-1 in the tie, Bryan, one of the greatest men’s doubles players of all time, opted to switch Olympic men’s doubles silver medalists Rajeev Ram and Austin Krajicek for top singles players Ben Shelton and Tommy Paul. Up against two top-10 doubles players in Matt Ebden and Jordan Thompson, the Americans lost 6-4, 6-4. Advertisement Bryan said in a news conference that he made the decision in the 15-minute window between the second and third ties. “We have an experienced doubles team in Rajeev and Austin, and we’ve got a lot of firepower from the singles lineup,” he said. “We were hoping to catch the Aussies a little bit by surprise.” According to Australia’s captain, the former Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion Lleyton Hewitt, that hope was misplaced. “It didn’t surprise us that much, to be honest,” he said in a news conference. “I’d seen them do drills during the week, so yeah, it wasn’t a surprise.” Shelton, the world No. 21, had earlier come out on the wrong side of a 30-point tiebreak against world No. 78 Thanasi Kokkinakis, falling to a 6-1, 4-6, 7-6(14) defeat. Taylor Fritz, America’s top-ranked singles player at world No. 4 and this year’s U.S. Open finalist, beat world No. 9 Alex De Minaur 6-3, 6-4 to force the deciding rubber. The selection change meant that rather than having two doubles specialists who play on the ATP tour together play that rubber, the USA fielded two singles players with relatively little doubles experience (though Shelton did play at college and still does semi-regularly). The decision was even more surprising because the USA team captain Bryan, in his first finals since taking the role full time last year, is a legendary doubles player. He won 23 Grand Slams across the men’s and mixed disciplines, the former with his brother, Mike. Ram and Krajicek have not been in good form, losing four of their five matches since linking up in September but they are both Grand Slam champions and former world No. 1s. They’ve played 41 matches together in total since first linking up in 2015, but lost the Olympic final to an Australia team featuring Ebden, alongside John Peers. Paul, the world No. 12 in singles, did win a bronze medal in doubles at the Olympics with Fritz but has not played doubles since. He has only once played with Shelton, who looked lost in the first set against Kokkinakis and, after a credible recovery, went for too many low-margin shots in the deciding tiebreak. Advertisement The loss could bring back memories for Ram, who was not picked in the squad for the 2022 finals with then-captain Mardy Fish opting to take four players with five spots available. Team USA then went out at the quarterfinal stage to Italy, after losing the decisive doubles rubber. Paul and Fritz were the picks that day and received criticism on Twitter (formerly X) from Canadian doubles specialist Brayden Schnur, who said the decision had been made because of the American pair’s “egos.” Fritz and Paul both hit back and defended Fish’s selection. In this case Bryan said “we know how everyone is feeling, and we know a lot about the opponents that we’re playing.” “It’s a world of analytics. You talk amongst the other coaches.” As for how much the players were involved in the decision, Bryan said: “Some guys are comfortable playing with some guys, and there is a lot that goes in, a lot of dynamics in doubles. “Look, Austin and Raj, they were very supportive. They were the guys on the sidelines yelling out tactics and helping with serving spots and coverages. They’re in it as great teammates.” Aiming to unsettle the Aussies, it was actually Paul who was broken in his first service game. Opponents Ebden and Thompson won the Australian Open, Olympics and U.S. Open men’s doubles competitions between them this year, and so the dynamic of the match was very much about two top singles players facing a pair of doubles experts — even if Thompson has relatively recently blossomed on the doubles court. A singles player can take over a doubles match, like Jannik Sinner in last year’s Davis Cup or Andy Murray in the 2015 final, but the most pertinent recent example of it going the other way was Ram and Krajicek schooling Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz at the Olympics in July. GO DEEPER Irresistible force of Nadalcaraz falls at the Olympics to an immovable object Early on, the Aussies made good use of their greater doubles nous, pinching that early break after Ebden had anticipated a crosscourt backhand from Paul and intercepted it with a clinical volley; in the second set, Ebden directed a tricky smash into the tramlines to break again. They faced just one break point throughout. At the Laver Cup in September, Shelton spoke about how much he enjoys doubles — though that was after playing in a match that involved four singles players. “You play two doubles guys and no one hits over a return. They chip lob you every time. They serve and volley every point,” he said of the difference when playing with doubles specialists. Advertisement “And put away every volley. They are literally standing on the net. “With singles guys, it’s a little different. They are roping the ball crosscourt, hitting the ball way cleaner from the baseline, but not moving as much at net, so you feel a little bit more comfortable returning.” The defeat means the USA, 32-time Davis Cup champions, have not reached the semifinals since 2018 nor won the event since 2007. With an American team missing Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula and Emma Navarro exiting the Billie Jean King Cup finals at the first hurdle last week, Team USA leaves Malaga with a record of 0-2. Australia faces the winner of Thursday night’s tie between Italy and Argentina in the semifinals on Saturday. (Top photo: Clive Brunskill / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"John Elway talks Bo Nix's rise, Broncos QB support, Mike Shanahan's Hall of Fame hopes",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935369/2024/11/21/john-elway-bronocs-bo-nix-mike-shanahan/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 15:27:46 GMT",The Broncos legend also discussed his diagnosis with Dupuytren's contracture five years ago and is now sharing story of his treatment.,"NFL When Bo Nix was named the Broncos starting quarterback in September, he became the team’s first rookie to earn that role since John Elway since 1983. There were parallels between Nix and the Hall of Fame quarterback that continued from there. Both players struggled at the start. Elway completed only 1-of-8 passes in his NFL debut and was sacked four times. Nix threw only one touchdown pass in his first four games, the low point being a first half during a win against the New York Jets in which he threw for minus-7 yards on 15 attempts during a rainy day at MetLife Stadium. Advertisement But Nix has since hit a red-hot streak Elway didn’t find until after his rookie season. Nix was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week on Wednesday after throwing for 307 yards and four touchdowns in Sunday’s 38-6 rout of the Atlanta Falcons. Among those who have been impressed by the 24-year-old quarterback’s rapid growth — and that of the Broncos as a team around him — is Elway himself. The first rookie QB in franchise history to earn this honor. RT to congratulate QB Bo Nix on being named AFC Offensive Player of the Week‼️ 📰 » https://t.co/a7Aa334bNf pic.twitter.com/h4x7U97LPT — Denver Broncos (@Broncos) November 20, 2024  “He’s very talented and very mature; he played 60 college games, which is unheard of for most young guys who come into the NFL,” Elway said of Nix. “It gave him a big step forward. The combination of what Bo is doing and, even more importantly, (the way) Sean (Payton) and (quarterbacks coach) Davis Webb are handling him and putting him in the right situations. Then, you look at the Broncos playing great defense. They haven’t put Bo in situations he hasn’t been able to handle. They’ve been able to grow him over this season and you’ve seen his maturation already and the confidence level that’s growing with the offense and what Sean’s doing.” Elway spoke with The Athletic on Wednesday as part of a promotional public health campaign that raising awareness for — and treatment of — Dupuytren’s contracture (DC), a progressive hand condition caused by a build-up of collagen that forms a rope-like chord in the palm and makes it difficult to bend fingers. It’s a condition that affects as many as 17 million Americans, and Elway first announced his battle with the debilitating issue five years ago. Since then, he insists, it’s an aspect of his life he gets asked about frequently by strangers he meets, many eager to share their own stories of dealing with DC. “It’s amazing the amount of people that come up that have this and ask me about it, whether it’s in their fingers of the palm of their hands,” Elway said. “So it’s been good for me to help get the word out and help those people who look at their hands and kind of wonder what’s going on.” GO DEEPER Broncos' biggest turnaround this side of Bo Nix: A run defense with real bite Elway has done the math. He had 19 surgeries during his playing career. When he was diagnosed with DC he learned there was no cure. Surgery “was really the only option” for treatment Elway was presented with at the time, he said. Elway wasn’t keen on having a 20th operation, so he went along managing the condition the best he could. Advertisement “I never had a lot of pain, but it was more of an annoyance,” he said. “And something that, once I found out about it, it continues to get worse and worse.” Finally, during his penultimate season as the Broncos’ general manager in 2019, Elway found a non-surgical treatment, a medicated injection called Xiaflex that uses enzymes to break down the collagen in the affected tissue chords. The treatment was a 24-hour process that included injections into the palm of his hand and a follow-up appointment the next day. “It’s not an easy one in the fact that getting shots in the palm of your hand is not the most comfortable thing,” Elway said. “But the recovery time is two weeks and it’s a much better option, in my opinion.” He stressed when speaking to USA Today about his condition in 2019 that everyone should “check with their hand specialist” to discover the treatment option that works best. But the former quarterback said Wednesday that the route he chose five years ago immediately helped release the tension in his fingers, giving him mobility back in his hands. Elway has recently been dealing with a reoccurrence of DC on the ring finger of his right hand and will soon “go back and probably do another treatment.” “It’s not curable, but there is a solution to it that releases those fingers and live a good, comfortable life,” he said. Elway last worked with the Broncos as a consultant during the 2022 season. He isn’t around the facility much these days — though he did make an appearance during organized team activities in the spring — but his Sundays remain committed to watching the team he led to a combined eight AFC championships as a quarterback and an executive. As the most important player in franchise history, his words about the quarterback position in Denver always carry weight. As Elway first told ESPN’s Adam Schefter during a podcast appearance earlier this week, he hasn’t yet met Nix, but he’s been impressed watching the rookie quarterback from afar. He’s been struck not only by the improved play of Nix but also by the way the Broncos have built a healthy ecosystem around the young quarterback. GO DEEPER Marvin Mims Jr.'s new role highlights Sean Payton's creativity with Broncos offense Only three of Elway’s draft picks from his time as the team’s lead football decision-maker (2011 to 2020) remain on Denver’s roster: offensive tackle Garett Bolles (2017), wide receiver Courtland Sutton (2018) and linebacker Justin Strnad (2020). Elway said he has enjoyed watching how Payton has helped a young roster — albeit it one with key veterans protecting Nix on the offensive line — improve around the rookie quarterback. The Broncos are 6-5, currently the No. 7 playoff seed in the AFC, ahead of Sunday’s road game against the Las Vegas Raiders. Advertisement “They’re all getting used to each other, right?” Elway said. “They’re running the ball better. The wide receivers with the speed, they’re young, other than Courtland. The young guys are starting to step up and they’re all growing together. I think it’s a great combination. It’s great coaching. I think that’s a big part of it that’s not been talked about, what those offensive coaches are doing around Bo and getting him in situations where they are protecting him with good play-calling and not putting him in situations he can’t handle.” Nix said after being drafted in April that one of the coolest aspects of joining the Broncos was that Elway was his father’s favorite player. So when he relayed Elway’s words Wednesday, they resonated. “He’s a legend not only here for this organization, but for the entire NFL, so you do want to listen when a guy like that is talking, and you want to pay attention to it,” Nix said. “It’s an honor to be in this spot to where people like that can speak about it.” Elway, like many Broncos from his era — and their fans alike — eagerly awaits news about Mike Shanahan’s potential next step toward induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Shanahan, the Broncos’ head coach from 1995 to 2008, is one of nine semifinalists for the coaching category in the 2025 class, a group that also includes former Broncos coach Dan Reeves. A sub-committee is expected to announce one finalist next month to be put forth and considered for induction by the entire voting body. Before Shanahan became Elway’s head coach during the backstretch of his career, he also served as Elway’s quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator. In 1985, Shanahan’s first as coordinator and Elway’s third as an NFL quarterback, he attempted a career-high 605 pass attempts. Later, when Shanahan became the head coach after a three-season stint as the offensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers, he built a super-charged running game around the aging quarterback and helped the Broncos win their first two Super Bowl championships. “There’s nobody more deserving (for induction),” Elway said. “He was a great coach when he was my quarterbacks coach. He was a great head coach. When you look at what he’s done for the game of football and what he’s done with the West Coast offense, how he kind of took it to the next level, now you’re seeing all the coaches from his coaching tree that is just expanding that system on the offensive side. It all comes back to Mike and the influence he’s had on the game. You see it everywhere you turn on TV. There’s a Mike Shanahan influence offensively on what everyone’s doing in this league. That’s why Mike deserves to be in the Hall of Fame. We’re all hopeful. He’s going to get in, we just hope it’s this year.” Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Has the expanded College Football Playoff made more games 'matter' down the stretch?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5937507/2024/11/21/college-football-playoff-expansion-scenarios/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 14:59:45 GMT","With a 12-team field containing five conference champions and seven at-large bids, the CFP race has altered the stakes of late November.","NCAAF The expanded College Football Playoff is doing exactly what it intended to do, allowing more teams more access to important games late in the season. The regular season’s penultimate weekend offers 21 games with College Football Playoff ramifications. Next week, there are currently 23. That’s nearly three times as many as the final two weeks combined (15) in 2023. Advertisement With a 12-team field containing five conference champions and seven at-large squads, this year’s race paints a vastly different picture from mid-November in 2023, which fed into the final four-team Playoff. At this time a year ago, eight teams had positioned themselves above the field as CFP contenders. Now every team still in the running for a power-conference title remains in CFP contention. Perhaps the number of games with CFP stakes next week will drop a bit due to upsets this Saturday, but it will still dwarf the seven with CFP implications played on Thanksgiving weekend in 2023.  “What would be the talking point right now that everybody would be complaining about if it was a four-team playoff?” CBS college football analyst Gary Danielson said. “Are we going to get two from the SEC? Are we going to get two Big Ten teams or is Notre Dame going to be the fifth team? Is that the whole argument there? I think that’s all that would be going on right now.” Let’s break down the differences between 2023 and 2024 based on each season’s penultimate week of action. Win and they’re virtually in No. 5 Indiana (10-0) at No. 2 Ohio State (9-1). The winner is assured of a CFP berth and probably a home Playoff game. The loser still is in decent shape for a CFP spot, but it might have to travel. In good shape with a win Kentucky (4-6) at No. 3 Texas (9-1). The Longhorns likely lock up a spot with a victory, but it’s against a team they can’t take lightly. The Wildcats are 1-6 in SEC play but won at Ole Miss and lost to Georgia by one point. No. 4 Penn State (9-1) at Minnesota (6-4). It’s going to be cold, and the Nittany Lions haven’t won in Minneapolis since 2010. Penn State will have a CFP case even with a loss, but scrutiny will intensify. No. 7 Alabama (8-2) at Oklahoma (5-5). Considered a marquee matchup when the Sooners joined the SEC, this one has lost some sizzle. However, a loss would severely wound the Tide’s CFP chances, or at least make them contingent upon other teams losing. Advertisement No. 9 Ole Miss (8-2) at Florida (5-5). The teams have played just twice since 2008 and not in Gainesville since 2015. An Ole Miss loss likely ends its CFP hopes. Elimination games No. 19 Army (9-0) vs. No. 6 Notre Dame (9-1) at Yankee Stadium. Army could vault itself into strong consideration by the CFP selection committee by upsetting Notre Dame. A loss likely dooms Notre Dame’s CFP hopes. Wake Forest (4-6) at No. 8 Miami (9-1). The Hurricanes were off last week and will attempt to rebound after losing to Georgia Tech. A second loss coupled with an SMU win eliminates Miami from the ACC championship game and likely the CFP. No. 15 Texas A&M (8-2) at Auburn (4-6). This is dangerous territory for the Aggies, who have a date with Texas on deck. Auburn doesn’t lack for talent, and despite its record, it matches up with just about everyone. No. 22 Iowa State (8-2) at Utah (4-6). The Cyclones need this win to remain in Big 12 and CFP contention, while the Utes are in danger of missing a bowl in a full season for the first time since 2013. No. 24 UNLV (8-2) at San Jose State (6-4). For the Rebels to have a shot at the Mountain West title, let alone the CFP, they need to beat a Spartans team that has been competitive all year and get some help. Colorado State (7-3) at Fresno State (5-5). The Rams are unbeaten in the Mountain West, and a potential conference title game showdown with Boise State would offer them an outside shot at the last automatic bid. Not must-win but still vital No. 13 SMU (9-1) at Virginia (5-5). The Mustangs are the ACC’s only unbeaten team but can’t afford a loss to pick up an at-large berth. No. 14 BYU (9-1) at No. 21 Arizona State (8-2). Neither can clinch a Big 12 title game berth with a win, but a loss makes that goal awfully difficult. No. 16 Colorado (8-2) vs. Kansas (4-6) in Kansas City, Mo. The Buffaloes are rolling, but they meet an equally hot Jayhawks squad that has beaten Iowa State and BYU in consecutive weeks. Advertisement Lose and you deserve to miss the CFP UMass (2-8) at No. 10 Georgia (8-2)
UTEP (2-8) at No. 11 Tennessee (8-2)
No. 12 Boise State (9-1) at Wyoming (2-8)
The Citadel (FCS) at No. 17 Clemson (8-2)
Wofford (FCS) at No. 18 South Carolina (7-3) Little direct impact but could help metrics No. 23 Missouri (7-3) at Mississippi State (2-8)
No. 25 Illinois (7-3) at Rutgers (6-4) Texas A&M and Alabama wouldn’t mind the resume boost of the Tigers hanging on at the back end of the Top 25. Similarly, the Illini can aid Penn State and Oregon if they stay in the rankings. It’s a little simpler to track the 15 games that carried CFP ramifications with two weeks remaining in the 2023 regular season. Eight teams had distanced themselves from the rest of the pack as legitimate CFP contenders. Their results on the second-to-last weekend did nothing to dispel that notion. No. 1 Georgia 38, No. 18 Tennessee 10. The unbeaten Bulldogs closed out SEC play with an emphatic victory. No. 2 Ohio State 37, Minnesota 3. The Buckeyes finished their home campaign by keeping pace with their archrivals atop the conference standings. No. 3 Michigan 31, Maryland 24. The Wolverines appeared somewhat vulnerable against the Terrapins, but in reality it served as a wakeup call that propelled them to the CFP national title. No. 4 Florida State 58, North Alabama 13. Seminoles quarterback Jordan Travis’ season-ending injury made this game more consequential to the final CFP rankings than anyone could have imagined at the time. No. 5 Washington 22, No. 11 Oregon State 20. In their final meeting as conference rivals, the Huskies held off the Beavers to clinch a Pac-12 championship game berth. No. 6 Oregon 49, Arizona State 13. Bo Nix threw six touchdown passes in the first half to take the Ducks one step closer to a rematch with Washington. Advertisement No. 7 Texas 26, Iowa State 16. The Longhorns cleared a big hurdle toward reaching their first CFP after losing three of their last four in Ames. No. 8 Alabama 66, Chattanooga 10. People actually spent money to watch this game. On Thanksgiving weekend, Michigan knocked off Ohio State again, and the other six teams held serve with varying degrees of drama. Perhaps a more balanced year-over-year comparison is to line up this year’s matchups with those that were pivotal for not only the four-team CFP but for New Year’s Six bowls and conference championships. Those numbers are nearly identical. Last year, 22 games fit that description the penultimate week and 18 on Thanksgiving weekend. In addition, there were two teams that had already clinched division titles approaching their final games but were not in the CFP picture. In the final year with a four-team field, not every game had CFP ramifications, but several impacted New Year’s Six bowls and conference championship games. Here are the ones that were pivotal in choosing New Year’s Six representatives. No. 9 Missouri 33, Florida 31. A field goal with five seconds left kept the Tigers in the New Year’s Six hunt. Ultimately, they landed a Cotton Bowl berth. No. 11 Penn State 27, Rutgers 6. The Nittany Lions were out of the Big Ten title chase, but this result helped get them to the Peach Bowl. No. 13 Ole Miss 35, Louisiana-Monroe 3. The Rebels’ win kept them on track for an eventual Peach Bowl spot. Outside of Texas, the Big 12 was a hot mess of uncertainty. Coming out of the penultimate weekend, four teams still had a chance to win the league title and earn a New Year’s Six spot. No. 14 Oklahoma 31, BYU 24. A late touchdown kept the Sooners in the Big 12 title hunt, although they did not control their own path. No. 23 Oklahoma State 43, Houston 30. The Cowboys’ win gave them the inside track to face Texas in the Big 12 championship game. They earned that spot the following week. Advertisement No. 21 Kansas State 31, No. 25 Kansas 27. The Wildcats rallied from an 11-point second-half deficit to stay on the fringe of Big 12 title contention. In the Group of 5, there was a race among the leaders of Conference USA, the American and the Mountain West for the automatic New Year’s Six bid. It included five games on that weekend. No. 24 Tulane 24, Florida Atlantic 8. Tulane stayed even with the American’s other two unbeatens and kept alive hopes for a second straight New Year’s Six bid. SMU 38, Memphis 34. In the American’s marquee game, the Mustangs used a strong fourth quarter to remain undefeated in league play and eliminate Memphis from the title hunt. UTSA 49, USF 21. The Roadrunners remained in a first-place tie with Tulane and SMU in the American by rolling past USF. Liberty 49, UMass 25. The Flames remained unbeaten at 11-0 and crept closer to a New Year’s Six bid, which they ultimately obtained. UNLV 31, Air Force 27. UNLV took control of first place in the Mountain West, and it was the one school in the league that had a shot at the New Year’s Six. The ACC, Big 12 and Pac-12 played without divisions last year, but the Big Ten and SEC held on for one final season, which kept New Year’s Six bowl hopes alive for teams that perhaps wouldn’t have competed for a national championship. No. 10 Louisville 38, Miami 31. The Cardinals claimed the second ACC championship game spot and stayed alive for a possible New Year’s Six berth. No. 16 Iowa 15, Illinois 13. The offense-challenged Hawkeyes squeaked to another win and clinched the Big Ten West Division with one week to play. No. 17 Arizona 42, No. 22 Utah 18. The Wildcats’ surge kept them within striking distance of Oregon for the second Pac-12 title game spot. In the final week of the 2023 regular season, there were seven games with CFP consequences. This year, it appears that 23 games on Thanksgiving weekend will have CFP implications. Nearly all of them are rivalries, which adds another layer to the sport’s unpredictability. One aspect remains certain: The more games that matter in the championship chase, the more it will excite the public and keep it — and the teams themselves — engaged longer. (Top photo: Kevin C.

The New York Post first reported the news. The roundtable discussion show, which features notable panelists from the media world discussing the day’s top stories, launched in 2002 with Max Kellerman as host. Tony Reali took over hosting duties in 2004 and has remained in that role ever since. The show became a popular mainstay on the network in the 5 p.m. ET time slot, pairing with “Pardon the Interruption” and featuring sportswriters and media personalities from around the country, including Woody Paige, Mina Kimes, Bill Plaschke, Jackie MacMullan, J.A. Adande and Elle Duncan, among others. Advertisement Erik Rydholm, the creator and executive producer of “Pardon the Interruption,” has overseen “Around the Horn” since 2004. The Athletic’s Stephen J. Nesbitt described the show in a story on Reali in 2022 as evolving “from a barrage of bombastic debate into a smarter show where banter and nuance can coexist,” and wrote that “Reali has developed from a facilitator, a pass-first point guard, into a host whose voice and vulnerability have made a glorified game show into a refreshingly genuine space.” It’s unclear what will be next for Reali, 46.

Survivor Pools | Fantasy football player rankings Updated through 6 p.m. ET, Nov. 21 Sam Darnold, QB, Vikings (foot) — Expected to play
Darnold was limited in Wednesday’s practice due to a foot injury but is now off the injury report and is expected to play Isiah Pacheco, RB, Chiefs (ankle) — Questionable / Injured reserve
Pacheco is expected to return from injured reserve ahead of the Chiefs’ matchup with the Panthers on Sunday. When he is available to return to gameplay, it will mean the end of (fantasy) days for Kareem Hunt. But so far this week, Pacheco’s been a limited participant in practice. Mike Evans, WR, Buccaneers (hamstring) — Expected to play
Evans returned to practice this week and will return in Week 12, according to The Athletic’s league sources. Finally, Tampa Bay has a fantasy starter in its wide receiver corps again. With Chris Godwin on injured reserve, Evans is only competing with TE Cade Otton to be QB Baker Mayfield’s top target. Tyreek Hill, WR, Dolphins (wrist) — Expected to play
Hill is expected to play while nursing a wrist injury that will likely ail him for the rest of the season. While Hill’s teammate Jaylen Waddle has had fantasy relevance in past seasons, he has not done well this year, scoring only 8.0 PPR points per game. Tight end Jonnu Smith, however, had 101 receiving yards on six receptions in Week 11 and finished with 28.1 PPR points, so look to him if you’re in need of a TE with so many teams on bye this week. D’Andre Swift, RB, Bears (groin) — Questionable
Swift practiced in a limited capacity Thursday due to a groin injury and is questionable for Week 12. If he sits, Roschon Johnson becomes an intriguing fantasy play after getting 10 carries to Swift’s 14 in Week 11. Advertisement Jonathon Brooks, RB, Panthers (knee) — Expected to play
Panthers head coach Dave Canales said he “fully expects” Brooks to play in the Chiefs-Panthers matchup, according to Mike Kaye of The Charlotte Observer. For fantasy purposes, it will be important to monitor how many carries Brooks gets compared to Chuba Hubbard, who has been one of the few bright spots for Carolina this season. Hubbard has accumulated 942 yards from scrimmage and has been running efficiently with 5.1 yards per carry. Adam Thielen, WR, Panthers (hamstring) — Questionable
Thielen said he felt good about his early-week workout but still has to “gain some ground to feel really good about playing on Sunday,” according to Panthers’ reporter Kassidy Hill. If Thielen returns, Xavier Legette and Jalen Coker will lose targets on a team that doesn’t have many to go around. QB Bryce Young completed only 15 passes in Week 10 and only 16 in Week 9. Brandin Cooks, WR, Cowboys (knee) — Injured reserve
CeeDee Lamb, WR, Cowboys (back/foot) — Questionable
With Cooper Rush under center, Cooks’ injury status is much less important to fantasy managers, but nonetheless, he was designated for return from injured reserve on Wednesday. Head coach Mike McCarthy said Cooks is getting close, according to The Athletic’s Saad Yousuf. Cooks will compete with Jalen Tolbert and maybe even new-addition Jonathan Mingo for targets, while Lamb, who didn’t practice Thursday, remains the only receiver to trust on a weekly basis with Dallas playing so poorly. Jake Ferguson, TE, Cowboys (concussion) — Questionable
McCarthy said Ferguson “will be hard pressed” to play in Week 12, according to Calvin Watkins of The Dallas Morning News. Backup tight end Luke Schoonmaker had six receptions on 10 targets and 56 receiving yards in Week 11. If you’re desperate for a tight end with so many teams on bye this week, consider Schoonmaker and hope Rush goes 32-for-55 as he did in Week 11, rather than 13-for-23, as in Week 10. Tyjae Spears, RB, Titans (concussion) — Questionable
Spears was not seen at practice on Thursday. While Tony Pollard stands to see a slight uptick in usage with Spears out, Tennessee’s leading rusher had only 44 rushing yards in Week 10 and 15 in Week 11. Advertisement Calvin Ridley, WR, Titans (illness) — Expected to play
Ridley did not practice Wednesday due to illness but is expected to play. Nick Westbrook-Ikhine had a massive Week 11 with 117 receiving yards and a touchdown, but that came from only two receptions, which makes him a boom-or-bust option. NWI has scored over 10 PPR points in three of the past four weeks, but Ridley is the only dependable wide receiver in Tennessee with the Titans’ limited offensive production. Darius Slayton, WR, Giants (concussion) — Questionable
Slayton practiced in full on Thursday. He hasn’t played since Week 9 but averaged 9.56 PPR points before then. Daniel Jones was benched for Tommy DeVito, but targets will likely be similarly dispersed. Malik Nabers is, by far, the most targeted Giants’ receiver at 11.75 targets per game, followed by Wan’Dale Robinson with 8.4 and Slayton with 5.56. Austin Seibert, K, Commanders (hip) — Questionable
Seibert was a limited participant in Thursday’s practice and is questionable for Week 12. Zane Gonzalez filled in for Seibert in Week 11 and made all three of his field goal attempts and was perfect on extra points. Zamir White, RB, Raiders (quadriceps) — Questionable
Alexander Mattison, RB, Raiders (ankle) — Questionable
Neither Mattison nor White practiced Wednesday. Each of them had five carries, and while Mattison had more yards (19) than White (nine), the numbers don’t bode well for future fantasy production for either of these backs. How many ways are there to say the Raiders are just plain bad? MarShawn Lloyd, RB, Packers (appendicitis) — Out
Josh Jacobs, RB, Packers (quadriceps) — Questionable
Lloyd was reinstated from injured reserve but was placed on the non-football illness list Wednesday. Jacobs has been leading Green Bay’s backfield to the tune of 4.8 yards per carry, 838 rushing yards and 186 receiving yards this season. Even if Lloyd returns in 2024, his usage is difficult to predict given Jacobs’ success. If Jacobs cannot play in Week 12, Emanuel Wilson and Chris Brooks will likely share carries. George Kittle, TE, 49ers (hamstring) — Questionable
Kittle told reporters, “I will playing on Sunday, very excited, can’t pass up playing the Packers.” Kittle’s absence was felt in Week 11, and with the 49ers battling for a playoff bid, the situation seems right for Kittle’s return. Brock Purdy, QB, 49ers (shoulder) — Questionable
Many players are on the injury report early in the week only to drop off as the week progresses. Purdy is likely one of those players, but he was a limited participant in Wednesday’s practice. Purdy’s backup is Brandon Allen who has a career completion percentage of only 56.7 percent and hasn’t started and played a full game since 2021. Advertisement Noah Fant, TE, Seahawks (groin) — Questionable
Fant hasn’t played since Week 8 and is questionable again heading into Week 12. Rookie AJ Barner started in Fant’s absence in Weeks 9 and 11 but totaled only 42 receiving yards on six receptions and 11 targets. Jalen Hurts, QB, Eagles (ankle) — Questionable
Hurts was a limited participant in Wednesday’s practice which led to an injury report appearance, but he practiced Thursday and is expected to play. DeVonta Smith, WR, Eagles (hamstring) — Questionable
Smith did not participate in Thursday’s practice and has struggled the past two weeks with only 10.3 PPR points in the two games combined, to go with a total of nine targets and six receptions. Outside of Smith and A.J. Brown, there are no other Philly receivers to roster, even if Smith sits. Jahan Dotson has averaged only 2.09 PPR points per game on an average of 1.7 targets. Ladd McConkey, WR, Chargers (shoulder) — Questionable
McConkey did not participate in practice on Thursday. If he can’t play, Quentin Johnston, Joshua Palmer and TE Will Dissly could see an uptick in usage. In Weeks 10 and 11 combined, Dissly led the Chargers with 12 targets; McConkey had 11, Johnston saw 10, and Palmer was targeted six times. Jake Ciely has McConkey as WR15 this week and Johnston as WR24. 
  Outdoor games only. Statistics in this section come from TruMedia.  The weather hasn’t impacted many games this season, but colder temperatures and precipitation await. According to Rotowire, the Steelers–Browns Thursday night matchup comes with an expected temperature of 36 degrees and a 75 percent chance of rain. Pittsburgh Steelers (8-2) vs. Cleveland Browns (2-8) Since 2015, Jameis Winston has played in six regular-season rain games, and his completion percentage for those contests is a dismal 53.2 percent, compared to a career regular-season total of 61.8 percent. In those games, he’s also thrown 12 interceptions to only seven touchdowns (0.6 TD/interception ratio), which likely comes as no surprise for those who know Winston. He takes risks — a lot of them — when throwing the football. But without rain, his touchdown TD/interception ratio is a much more digestible 1.6. Advertisement While moving toward a run-heavy gameplan in the rain is sensible, the Browns’ running game has been ineffective this season. Cleveland averages only 88.5 rushing yards per game (ranked 29th in the NFL) and has a rush EPA of -2.92 (22nd), and the Steelers rank fourth in rushing yards allowed per game. The Browns may find it hard to plan for this rainy-day game. Russell Wilson has 20 rain games under his belt and a much higher completion percentage of 61.5 percent. In those games, he’s tossed 37 TDs to only 13 interceptions, which gives him the edge on Winston in the rain. The Steelers backfield, relying on Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren, averages 136.7 rushing yards per game (eighth), but Pittsburgh’s rush EPA ranks 29th in the league. In order to keep Cleveland’s defense honest, Wilson needs to throw because the backs aren’t creating scoring opportunities with an EPA of -4.48. George Pickens remains a safe fantasy play, given his 29 percent target share and Wilson’s numbers in the rain. Wondering what the weather impact is on fantasy production? Jake Ciely has you covered like a poncho in rainy season.
 Game-specific previews and live updates are available on the day of the game. Pittsburgh Steelers (8-2) vs. Cleveland Browns (2-8) The Steelers are favored by a little more than a field goal over the Browns in Week 12, and the matchup has an over/under of only 36.5, the lowest total of the week. Pittsburgh’s offense sputtered in Week 11 as Russell Wilson was sacked four times, threw an interception, and had only 205 yards passing. Najee Harris had 18 carries to Jaylen Warren’s nine, and they were each targeted four times, but Warren finished with 4.6 yards per rush compared to Harris’ 3.5. Meanwhile, kicker Chris Boswell led the Steelers in fantasy points with 24. The Browns’ Jameis Winston and Jerry Jeudy have shown some nice chemistry. Jeudy earned 11 targets each of the past two games and finished with 142 yards receiving against New Orleans in Week 11. The Steelers’ defense is better than the Saints’, but Pittsburgh is prone to giving up yards through the air and is ranked 20th in quarterback sack rate. Jeudy could be an intriguing flex option. Read the full preview.   San Francisco 49ers (5-5) vs. Green Bay Packers (7-3) The Green Bay Packers are slight home favorites in their Week 12 contest against the San Francisco 49ers. Coming off a 1-point win against the Bears — secured in the final seconds by a blocked field goal — the Packers weren’t exactly dominant against a struggling Chicago team last week. The Niners are coming off a 20-17 loss to Seattle (who had lost five of their previous six games) and are in a very tight NFC West race that has the 6-4 Cardinals on top. Advertisement Jordan Love and Brock Purdy have become franchise quarterbacks over the past two seasons. However, Love ranks 30th in completion percentage this season, one spot below recently benched Daniel Jones, while Purdy ranks 20th. Although both QBs rank inside the top 10 in fantasy points per game, they fall outside the top 10 in passer rating. Luckily for Love and Purdy, each team has a receiver ranked in the top five in passer rating when targeted (minimum of 35 touches). Jayden Reed tops the list at 146.0, while Jauan Jennings ranks fifth at 127.7. Jennings has been a great complement to Deebo Samuel in the absence of Brandon Aiyuk (injured reserve), rising to WR2 status. Read the full preview (coming Sunday).  Philadelphia Eagles (8-2) vs. Los Angeles Rams (5-5) The Philadelphia Eagles are favored on the road against the Los Angeles Rams in this NFC matchup. The Rams are coming off a narrow 28-22 victory against New England. After a disappointing 9.7 fantasy point performance in Week 10, Matthew Stafford bounced back with 295 passing yards and four TDs against the Patriots. Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua each had over 100 yards receiving and scored (Kupp had two TDs; Nacua had one). Led by QB Jalen Hurts, the Eagles boast two talented receivers of their own, A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith. But Philadelphia has Saquon Barkley, and the Rams do not, and at 273.1 yards allowed per game, the Eagles defense is a force. In contrast, the Rams D sits at 23rd, allowing 350.6 yards per game. Week 12 presents the perfect opportunity for Smith to return to fantasy relevance after Weeks 10 and 11, when he scored 3.4 and 6.9 PPR points, respectively. Read the full preview (coming Sunday).   Baltimore Ravens (7-4) vs. Los Angeles Chargers (7-3) Coming off a tough Week 11 loss to the Steelers, the Ravens are favored by less than a field goal on the road against the Chargers in this AFC matchup that has head coaches Jim and John Harbaugh meeting for the first time since Super Bowl XLVII. The Jim Harbaugh-led Chargers have been rolling lately. Justin Herbert is throwing more and ranks sixth in passer rating (102.1), J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards are handling backfield work, and Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston lead the Chargers’ wide receivers in targets, receiving yards and yards after the catch. Lamar Jackson has had an MVP season for Baltimore (excluding last week’s poor performance), but Derrick Henry has taken a step back lately with under 80 net yards in three of his last four games. Zay Flowers continues to impress (though somewhat inconsistently), while Diontae Johnson has become a fantasy drop, averaging two targets and 0.5 receptions per game. The Chargers defense is tough, and Tuli Tuipulotu has led the NFL over the past three weeks with six sacks, but Jackson has the third-most time to throw in the league. This Harbaugh brothers matchup is full of talent and intrigue. Read the full preview (coming Monday). 
 Statistics in this section come from TruMedia.  Austin Mock scours his weekly projections to spot the top values on the board. Bet picked Thursday: Minnesota Vikings -3 (-115) at Chicago Bears Caleb Williams and this Bears offense looked a lot better last week after making a change at offensive coordinator. Unfortunately for them, the Vikings’ defense is much better than the Packers’ and defensive coordinator Brian Flores getting to face a rookie quarterback is quite the bad matchup. I do have concerns about this Vikings offense since the loss of left tackle Christian Darrisaw, but they should have enough to complement their dominant defense. Advertisement Worst price to bet: Vikings -3 (-115) — Mock See all of Mock’s best bets for Week 12. 
 A weekly guide to staying alive from Renee Miller and Adam Gretz. Odds from BetMGM as of Thursday. Question from Melissa: “Six people left. What’s the best plan for the next two weeks: Kansas City (at Carolina), then Minnesota (vs. Arizona); Miami (vs. New England), then Kansas City (vs. Las Vegas); Houston (vs. Tennessee), then Kansas City (vs. Las Vegas)? Most others left in the pool have already used Kansas City and Miami, if that matters.” Congratulations on making it this far! As tempting as it would be to pick Kansas City this week, I would skip the first option because I simply do not trust the Minnesota vs. Arizona game next week. I think the Cardinals are probably pretty legit, and even if they don’t outright beat the Vikings, I could see that being a game you have to sweat through. Plus, I think Kansas City should win the next two games, and both matchups are very favorable. There’s nothing wrong with saving the Chiefs for that game against a very bad Raiders team. Now, the question comes down to Miami or Houston this week. Honestly? I like both of them; they are my picks for the week. If you had to ask me to pick one emphatically and with the most confidence, I would go with Houston. I cannot see the Titans going on the road and beating the Texans, especially with a healthy Nico Collins back in the lineup. You could probably argue that if everybody has already used Kansas City and Miami, they might take Houston this week, so it might make sense to try countering that by taking Miami. I think they will both win anyway, but I am still going to say take the Texans because I have slightly more confidence in them being the safer pick for this week. — Gretz Get this week’s top survivor pool tips.

The pair have both been nursing injuries in recent weeks, with Branthwaite withdrawing from the England squad due to a “minor” groin problem and McNeil having missed Everton’s 0-0 draw at West Ham before the break with a knee issue. Advertisement Both, though, have trained this week and are in with a chance of facing Thomas Frank’s side. “Dwight’s had a really good week training,” Dyche said. “Jarrad trained today (Thursday) after settling things down, so we’ll see how he responds. “We’re hopeful on that but he should be ok.” Long-term absentees Armando Broja (Achilles), Youssef Chermiti (foot), Seamus Coleman (hamstring), James Garner (back) and Tim Iroegbunam (foot) remain on the sidelines. However, all four have received positive news as they bid to make a comeback. “He (Broja) has had a full week’s training but he does need a games programme obviously,” Dyche said. “We’re looking at the dates now as we wanted to ensure he came through his first full week. He said he feels good and feels fit so we’ll introduce a games programme once things align. “Youssef is making good progress as well. He’s slightly behind (Broja) but had his first full day with us today, which was pleasing. “Seamus is on the grass with the medical side, just taking the first steps back. Jimmy has had good news from the specialist but has been out a while and is going to have to be careful in the initial spell. “Tim’s stress response in his foot is clearing up so he can start sort of semi loading again and making sure he starts his progress back.” Dyche also responded to calls for Iliman Ndiaye to be moved into a central role by saying there is “no evidence” the Senegal international should be playing in the No 10 position. GO DEEPER 'Iliman is the inspiration - to be playing for a club like Everton is unbelievable' The £15 million summer signing has impressed since joining from Marseille but has played the bulk of his minutes on the left wing so far. “He’s doing well off the left,” Dyche said. “People keep telling me I should be playing him there. People keep telling me of my role as a manager. “I think he can adapt to Everton. The modern No 10 has to defend from there. Dwight does it very well on the offensive side but has found the defensive side more of a challenge. Advertisement “It’s not as easy as you think getting the right passing lanes to stop the opposition and then attacking on turnovers over 95 minutes. That can be developed over time but he’s doing a good job coming off the left — he can wriggle and drive into the box. He’s still adapting.” Everton are 16th in the Premier League table, three points off the relegation zone.

I’ve always believed I’d dominate on “Supermarket Sweep,” most “Price is Right” games, and that event on “American Gladiators” where they shoot tennis balls at you. Contenders and dumpster fires abound We’re about one month into the 2024-25 season, and so much has happened already. The actual basketball has been phenomenal, even though the injuries have not. We’ve had super compelling stories, both good and bad. So, what should you believe in and what should you dismiss after one month? It’s time to play: Buy or Sell? Advertisement The Cavs are title contenders vs. just contenders: Sell. I’m right on the border with this one. I love what the Cavs (16-1) are doing so far, and we might be devoid of contending options in the East to challenge Boston (12-3). I love what Cleveland did against Boston in the second half Tuesday night. Kenny Atkinson’s offense is intricate and smart. I just need to see more before I believe fully. The Bucks are salvageable: Buy. Mostly because I don’t understand why Milwaukee (6-9) has struggled so much despite Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard being really good this season. Khris Middleton will hopefully be back soon, and then maybe Doc Rivers will be out of excuses. Dalton Knecht is the best rookie so far: Sell. He’s been hot against two bad teams, but we really haven’t seen him do much against the good opponents. Still, the 17th pick out of Tennessee can really shoot that thing for his squad (10-4). Sixers guard Jared McCain has probably been the best rookie so far. It’s a weird class.  The 76ers messed up this summer: Sell. They did what they needed to do with the options available. And perhaps one day it will work out for them during this new era of hoops for the Sixers (league-worst 2-12). However, scroll down to see the latest. Spoiler alert: It’s not great. The Pelicans are in trouble: Buy. I was so high on them coming into the season, and they can’t get even close to healthy. We’re not talking about a couple of injuries. The Pelicans are missing five or six rotation guys most nights. They’re down to 4-12 and 14th in the West. They need health, and they need to get on a big roll to compete for a Play-In spot. The Warriors are contenders: Buy. Even with some frustrating injury news, I love the makeup of this Warriors team (11-3). There are so many similarities to what we saw from them in 2022 when they won it all. They would be my pick to come out of the West right now. Advertisement The injuries are out of control: Buy. According to injury guru Jeff Stotts, the NBA passed 1,000 missed games due to injury or illness after Tuesday night. That happened on Nov. 28 last season. It’s already ruining so many players’ seasons. The Lakers are contenders: Sell. I want to buy into them, and I’m not even saying they can’t get past Denver like the last two seasons. The Lakers’ offense has been stellar after being mediocre last year. However, their defense and rebounding are pretty bad. Can’t contend like that. Khris Middleton should be back soon! 🛞💰 Damon Sayles dominated. Our own Damon Sayles, senior editor for culture/NBA, went on “Wheel of Fortune” last night and destroyed everybody. Get buckets, Damon!  Pretty cool to see @DamonSayles kick butt on @WheelofFortune.

Great defense against elite offense. Ceasing madness around intentional fouls A team is down three, has the ball and is advancing it up the court. Time is ticking away at the end of the fourth quarter, and you are wondering if this team can find a way to tie up the game and get it to overtime. Free basketball on the horizon to settle a close, probably great game! Then, before the star of the team can get into their shooting motion to let it fly, they get intentionally fouled. Why? They’re in the bonus, and you’d rather give up two free-throw attempts than give up a game-tying attempt. Advertisement It’s smart basketball and a good strategy. It’s the right play to make as the team in the lead. It also sucks and ruins the entertainment of the current product on the floor. This seems to be a universal belief among friends of mine — whether they are from the basketball world or just fans of the NBA. It’s the only time you won’t see players look incredulous for a call going against them. Now, instead of all of us watching this shot sail through the air like we’re Carlton Banks, we’re wondering if they know how to intentionally miss the second free throw to hope for a tip-in to tie it. That’s if they make the first one. That isn’t entertainment, and it’s not good basketball. The NBA wants to improve the product, right? They’ve added the take foul in transition situations, but these are take fouls with the game in the balance. The NBA should adopt the intentional foul to remove these situations from the game. We want to see heroic moments. Not the equivalent of extreme couponing with basketball strategy. Defenders should have to make a real play on the ball there, or risk giving up free throws while the losing team retains possession. It’s not hurting the leading team unfairly to make them play a little defense. And it will help the dramatic situations actually get a chance to become legit moments, rather than be an exhibition of accounting on the court. This 76ers isn’t getting any better Finally! The 76ers were going to start Tyrese Maxey, Paul George and Joel Embiid together. After a rough 2-11 start, the light at the end of the tunnel was no longer starting to look like an oncoming train. And then they played in Memphis last night. The 76ers were down by as many as 19 in the fourth quarter before a bit of a comeback to make the 117-111 loss look more respectable. After 17 minutes on the court, Paul George hyperextended his left knee. Again. You might remember he did that about a month ago and missed some time. Embiid had 35 points and 11 rebounds, and the Sixers were plus-seven with him on the floor. It was the first good game he’s had this season, and he had some things to say afterward. But the Sixers still can’t figure out how to play good basketball for extended stretches on the court. Wednesday night, Joel Embiid said that he heard the criticism from Tyrese Maxey during a recent team meeting. He made it clear that he is accountable for those actions. And that he didn’t like the details leaking into the public. ✍️ @tjonesonthenbahttps://t.co/N5xxyOoJWh pic.twitter.com/2IuLEvXuYt — The Athletic (@TheAthletic) November 21, 2024  They couldn’t slow down Jaren Jackson Jr., Desmond Bane and Jaylen Wells.

The 76ers do owe their pick to the OKC Thunder (like everybody else), but at least it’s top-six protected. Advertisement Bucks 122 (6-9), Bulls 106 (6-10): Giannis Antetokounmpo decided he’d had enough. He had 25 of his 41 points in the third quarter and enjoyed 16-of-20 shooting … in the paint! He had 32 points in the paint by himself. The Bulls had 34 points in the paint as a team. Antetokounmpo made 17 of 24 overall and had nine rebounds and eight assists to survive a strong push by Chicago. Zach LaVine looked good with 27 points. Cavs 128 (16-1), Pelicans 100 (4-12): Time to start a new streak! After the Cavs lost their win streak Tuesday, they beat up on an injured Pelicans squad to get back on track. Ty Jerome got the start in place of Darius Garland and led the team with 29 points. And yes, that box score is correct: Elfrid Payton started for the Pels. He hadn’t played since 2022. Rockets 130 (11-5), Pacers 113 (6-9): These are not the Pacers you expect. They had 23 turnovers and just shot 5 of 22 from 3-point range. The reason? Houston does that to you.

Four points on 1-of-7 shooting with eight assists. Thunder 109 (12-4), Blazers 99 (6-9): Isaiah Hartenstein made his OKC debut, and it was a good one. It was also much needed. Hartenstein had 13 points, 14 rebounds and four blocks to help hold off a scrappy Portland squad. Shaedon Sharpe had 21, but it wasn’t enough to overcome 30 from Jalen Williams and 28 from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Knicks 138 (9-6), Suns 122 (9-7): The Suns dropped their fifth straight and badly need Kevin Durant back. Warriors 120 (11-3), Hawks 97 (7-9): This was another dominant defensive effort by the Warriors. They held the Hawks to 33.3 percent shooting from the field and 26.1 percent from deep. Andrew Wiggins led them with 27 points. Clippers 104 (9-7), Magic 93 (9-7): The Clippers, sans Norman Powell, dominated the Magic to snap Orlando’s six-game win streak.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Cowboys Today: DaRon Bland's mysterious injury situation and Dante Fowler's impact,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936956/2024/11/21/cowboys-today-daron-bland-injury-update-dante-fowler-commanders/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 14:30:31 GMT","Bland was injured in training camp and is working his way back, but still hasn't played. Dallas will see a familiar face Sunday in D.C.","NFL Dallas Cowboys All-Pro cornerback DaRon Bland was listed as a full practice participant on Wednesday’s injury report. Bland’s situation has prompted many questions, many of which echo the sentiment: “What exactly is going on?” Here’s the rundown of Bland’s situation and how to follow the mysterious nature of it. The Cowboys hope it is met with positive clarity this week. Advertisement Bland suffered a stress fracture in his foot at the end of training camp and he began the regular season on injured reserve. The expected timeline for Bland to return was six-to-eight weeks. Six weeks would have put his return around the game in Pittsburgh on Oct. 6. Eight weeks would have had him around the bye week, the weekend of Oct. 20. His return appeared to be right on schedule. The Cowboys designated him to return on Oct. 9, opening his 21-day practice window the week leading into the home game against the Detroit Lions. That day, Bland was a full participant in a Wednesday practice. The next day (Oct. 10), Bland was again a full participant. At that point, the conversation was trending more toward how much Bland would play against the Lions, rather than if he’d play at all. GO DEEPER Six reasons why this Cowboys season is a disaster That Friday, Bland was listed as a “DNP (did not practice) on the final injury report of the week. His game status was officially listed as questionable. It’s important to point out that the Friday practice in which he did not participate was not an actual practice; it was a walk-through, therefore his DNP label was an estimation. This means Bland didn’t suffer a setback during the practice itself but that his foot did not react favorably that Friday morning to the two days of full practice before it. Bland was listed as a DNP in practice for the next five weeks. The Cowboys added him to the active roster on Oct. 30, but only because his 21-day return-to-play window had expired, so the option was to either bring him on the 53-man roster or revert him to IR and lose him for the year. Fast forward to this week: Bland was listed as a full participant Wednesday. It’s important to note that Wednesday was not an actual practice for the Cowboys but it was a walk-through, so Bland’s designation as a full participant is an estimation. It’s still encouraging news, because it means that the soreness in Bland’s foot is much improved, if not completely resolved, but recent history suggests to be careful before jumping to conclusions. The Cowboys practice Thursday, with Bland expected to participate. How he’s listed Friday will be very important. Advertisement If he is cleared to return to the field, it will be a significant boost to the Cowboys’ secondary, which has missed Bland dearly and also was without slot cornerback Jourdan Lewis last week (Lewis said he hopes to return this week). The Cowboys play the Commanders on the road Sunday. The game will be played on the FedEx Field surface, which has frequently been criticized by players for the risk of injury. To give you an idea of how dire the Cowboys’ sack production has been this season, defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence is tied for second on the team in sacks with three. Lawrence hasn’t played since Sept. 26. The Cowboys’ leader in that department is linebacker DeMarvion Overshown, with four sacks. Veteran Carl Lawson and Micah Parsons, who missed four games due to injury, are tied with Lawrence with three sacks apiece. Meanwhile, Dante Fowler leads the Commanders through 11 games with 8 1/2 sacks. He spent the last two seasons in Dallas and followed Dan Quinn to Washington this past offseason. Dorance Armstrong, the Cowboys’ 2018 fourth-round pick who also followed Quinn to Washington, has three. Armstrong spent his first six seasons in the NFL in Dallas, tallying 5 sacks in 2021, 8 1/2 in 2022 and 7 1/2 sacks in 2023. It wouldn’t be fair to make this comparison involving Fowler and Armstrong without mentioning the impact of the Cowboys’ injuries. Dallas let those two veterans walk in free agency because they believed Sam Williams was ready to make the jump as a premier pass rusher this season. They drafted Marshawn Kneeland to also be part of that rotation, featuring Parsons and Lawrence. Williams tore his ACL in training camp and was ruled out for the season. Lawrence has played four of the 10 games and a return is not imminent. Parsons missed four games. Kneeland has has spent the last five games on IR, though the Cowboys did open his 21-day window Wednesday. Kneeland was listed as a limited participant in Wednesday’s practice and has the potential to play against the Commanders. GO DEEPER Cowboys' offensive roster questions for final 7 games: Trey Lance's value to be determined Quarterback Dak Prescott had surgery in New York last week to repair the hamstring he injured in Atlanta on Nov. 3. Prescott was on crutches but in the building at AT&T Stadium on Sunday for the Cowboys’ game against the Houston Texans. Head coach Mike McCarthy said it was unclear if Prescott would be permitted to travel with the team at this stage in his recovery, so his presence at road games is unknown, for the time being.

Undav, 28, suffered the injury in training on Wednesday and is not expected to play again until after the winter break, following an MRI scan. The Germany international is in his second season at Stuttgart having initially joined on loan in 2023 from Brighton & Hove Albion, scoring 18 goals in 30 Bundesliga games in his first season as Sebastian Hoeness’s side rose from a 16th-placed finish in 2022-23 to second and Champions League qualification last campaign. Advertisement Undav also became a Germany international and was included in Julian Nagelsmann’s squad for the recent European Championship. He made his move permanent over the summer, signing for €32.6million (£28m) and becoming the most expensive arrival in Stuttgart’s history. Hoeness’s Stuttgart suffered significant losses over the summer. Serhou Guirassy, who scored 28 goals last season and with whom combined so well in attack, was sold to Borussia Dortmund. Waldemar Anton, the lynchpin centre-back, moved to Dortmund, too, significantly weakening the defence. Stuttgart are currently 11th in the Bundesliga, having won just three games. While their Champions League performances have been admirable and have featured an impressive display against Real Madrid and an unlikely win over Juventus in Turin, they have taken just four points from four games and are currently outside of the qualification places for the play-off round. GO DEEPER Deniz Undav is good enough for Germany - so should Brighton have let him leave? Undav has still been vital, though. Top scorer with six goals in all competitions, he has helped to shoulder the responsibility following Guirassy’s departure, as well as becoming a key part of the side’s intricate attacking build-up and lessening the burden on fellow centre-forward, Ermedin Demirovic. Undav scored his first international goal for Germany in September’s 2-2 draw with the Netherlands. Since leaving Brighton, he has become a much more rounded player — creative, as well as a goal-threat — and so this is a blow that Stuttgart could have done without. The league fixture list between now and the end of the year is forgiving, with Hoeness and his players not facing any of the current top six. They will be without Undav for a tricky-looking trip to Belgrade to face Crvena Zvezda in the Champions League, though, and what looks like a must-win game against Young Boys at home.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Should the Blues consider a Jim Montgomery reunion? It can't be out of the question,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935331/2024/11/21/blues-jim-montgomery-bruins/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 13:00:49 GMT",Will the former Blues assistant and recently fired Boston Bruins head coach be returning to St. Louis?,"NHL Based on the timing of the St. Louis Blues’ announcement last May that Drew Bannister was signing a two-year contract to be the team’s head coach, it doesn’t take a genius to see they had interest in giving the job to Jim Montgomery if he were available. Montgomery’s Boston Bruins wrapped up their first-round playoff win over the Toronto Maple Leafs on May 4, and after three weeks of being in a holding pattern, the Blues confirmed that Bannister was coming back on May 7. Advertisement “I got with my inner circle of guys that I make these decisions with, we talked about different people, and we came back to Drew as being the proper candidate to move forward with,” Blues general manager Doug Armstrong said at the time. “We’re excited to have him here. I thought he did a very good job in a difficult situation last year and now having a full training camp and a two-year term to put his stamp on this team, we’re looking forward to that.” Fast forward six months and the landscape has changed, especially in Boston. After an 8-9-3 start, the Bruins fired Montgomery, who was in the final year of a three-year contract. So after going 120-41-23 in Boston and winning the Jack Adams Award as the NHL’s top coach in 2023, he’s available. Meanwhile in St. Louis, the Blues are 8-11-1 heading into their matchup with the San Jose Sharks on Thursday and just 1-5-1 in their last seven games. They’re having trouble scoring goals (29th in the league) and preventing them (28th). Following the team’s 4-2 loss to Minnesota Wild on Tuesday, Bannister said, “We did some good things, and there’s things we have to correct. We’ve got to find ways to win hockey games. Right now, whether the bounces are going for us, we’ve got to work for those bounces to go our way.” As soon as I posted Bannister’s postgame remarks on social media, the replies came fast and furious — more furious. Fire Bannister, hire Montgomery. I’m not going tell fans how to feel, and at this point, I have no idea what the Blues are thinking. But with the current state of the club, which has led to this speculation just two months into Bannister’s full-time tenure, I want to refresh everyone on how general manager Doug Armstrong has said he views the retool. I think this exercise will help provide some context to the on-ice decisions that have been made this season. And it could also provide us with some context to the off-ice decision the organization will make regarding the coach. Advertisement This is a retool, right? Well, it was. The Blues acknowledged it last season, and fans have come to grips with it — some even welcoming it. But the tone seemed to change in training camp when Armstrong addressed the media. I went back Wednesday and listened to his press conference from September when the additions of Philip Broberg and Dylan Holloway via offseason offer sheets and the possibility of Dalibor Dvorský and Zach Bolduc making the opening-night roster was still fresh. “We’ve changed the outlook of our team,” Armstrong said then. “We have a lot (of) NHL-caliber players that have a lot of experience at a young age in our group right now. I think we’re at a good spot now where we expect to compete. “I think we have a chance to be a highly competitive team. I know they’re ready for the challenge to get back and push with the teams that were ahead of them last year and become part of that group. I think we can do that.” Make no mistake, Armstrong wanted to compete this season. You don’t ask your owners to spend to the NHL’s $88 million salary cap (and beyond with injuries) and make decisions with the notion that missing the postseason is OK. That’s why Pavel Buchnevich started the season playing center, not on the wing where he’ll likely play out the remainder of his six-year, $48 million extension that will kick in next season. He’s there because Armstrong took note of the Blues’ .600-plus point percentage last season when Buchnevich was playing in the middle and that could help the club make the postseason. But now, after two months of Buchnevich looking out of place at center and his production on the wing giving the Blues a better chance for success, he’s in fact back on the wing. That’s why Jordan Kyrou was not on the ice for the final four minutes of regulation in last week’s 4-3 overtime loss to the Buffalo Sabres. After two glaring turnovers by Kyrou that potentially cost the Blues points against the Philadelphia Flyers and Utah Hockey Club, Bannister chose to put Oskar Sundqvist in Kyrou’s spot down the stretch. Sure the coach decides who’s on the ice, but he does so based on the GM’s priorities for the season, and Kyrou not being on the ice in those situations, as opposed to learning how to handle them, should tell us something. Advertisement That’s why Bolduc, 21, isn’t a lock to be in the Blues’ lineup every night. The 2021 first-round pick has played in 15 of the team’s 20 games and was a healthy scratch in the other five. Now you could make the case that Bolduc should be playing every night in AHL Springfield and developing in the minors, but my point is, if there was any question about whether Armstrong wants to win now, the fact that Bolduc isn’t suiting up if the Blues don’t think he can help them get them a ‘W’ is another strong sign. Which leads us to this question: If Armstrong is that focused on the Blues being competitive this season, and making the playoffs this season, would he really replace Bannister with Montgomery? After just 54 games as the interim coach and 20-odd more this season? He might. He did it in 2012 when he fired Davis Payne after just 13 games (6-7) and replaced him with Ken Hitchcock, who went on to win the second-most games in Blues’ history (248) behind Joel Quenneville (307). Interestingly, during training camp this year, Armstrong likened the Blues’ roster and situation to the “2010-11, 2011-12” era, just before they dismissed Payne. We know how much Armstrong likes Montgomery, being the first to hire him back in the NHL as an assistant coach in 2020 after he was fired by the Dallas Stars due to “unprofessional conduct.” Players such as Buchnevich and Robert Thomas were disappointed when he left for the job in Boston, but knew it was best for his career to land another head coaching job with an Original Six club. But after a pair of amazing regular seasons and two early playoff exits, Montgomery didn’t get to see December in his third year with the Bruins. He’ll assuredly pop up somewhere, and The Athletic mentioned four possible destinations: St. Louis, Montreal, Detroit and Pittsburgh. Former Blues and current Maple Leafs coach Craig Berube vouched for him Wednesday. Advertisement “I know Monty personally,” Berube said. “We brought him into St. Louis to work with us for a couple years and he was fantastic. He’s a very intelligent coach on both sides of the puck. I think him coming into St. Louis, I found Monty was very, very responsible on the defensive side of things. He actually ran our (penalty kill) that year and it was very good. Very good on that side of things.” Whether the Blues hiring Montgomery and moving on from Bannister becomes reality or remains a rumor, the remote possibility would be a very raw deal for Bannister. In 74 games with a retooling roster, he’s 38-30-6. His club went a stretch of 12 games recently without arguably its two best players in Broberg and Thomas. There aren’t many coaches, if any, who could’ve forged a better record under these circumstances. The ultimate decision would undoubtedly include Armstrong and Alexander Steen, the GM-in-waiting who will take over after the 2025-26 season. Are the Blues building for then, or do they want to be in the playoffs by then? If they want to be in the postseason, would a change help? We are about three weeks shy of when Armstrong fired Berube on Dec. 14. While going back and re-listening to Armstrong’s interviews from earlier this year, I came across this comment when asked about continuity in the coaching ranks. “I think all managers and team owners would say the same thing: you want continuity as much as possible, but sometimes it’s just not possible,” Armstrong said. “If you look at the number of changes in the coaching fraternity over the last 36 months, I’m personally not sure this is healthy, but it seems to be a trend that we’re on now. I do believe in longevity if you can build relationships and go through it. For some reason, our industry isn’t working that way, and I hope it does change.” Will Armstrong stick with Bannister, or will Montgomery’s availability make it “just not possible?” If the GM believes the Blues will be more competitive this year and better in the long term, a reunion may not be out of the question.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How longtime catcher Sal Fasano will help restructure the Angels' 2025 pitching plans,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935567/2024/11/21/angels-pitching-coach-sal-fasano/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 13:00:29 GMT",Fasano — who won a World Series with the Angels for playing two games in 2002 — will be something of a jack-of-all-trades as a coach.,"MLB When Sal Fasano got a call this offseason from Los Angeles Angels general manager Perry Minasian, it wasn’t the first time. Fasano had just been fired from the job that Minasian first established for him with the Atlanta Braves seven years ago. “He said (in 2017), ‘Hey, I want to make a job for you,’” the longtime big-league catcher and coach recalled recently. “‘I want you to work with the catchers … but you’re going to help with the pitching and do all the game plan stuff.’” Advertisement “It’s funny how things work,” he added. “Being let go by Atlanta, the first guy who calls me is Perry.” Fasano’s title with the Angels will be assistant pitching coach; the team will have a pitching coach, bullpen coach, and Fasano somewhere in between. Minasian hopes that a connection dating back to their days in the Toronto Blue Jays organization can boost a pitching staff in desperate need of improvement. “He’s outstanding with arms and with pitching in general,” Minasian said. “I can go on and on about really quality pitching coaches that were at the catcher position. They look at things in a different way.” Fasano — who won a World Series with the Angels for playing two games in 2002 — will be something of a jack-of-all-trades on the team’s coaching staff more than two decades later. He’ll work closely with head of game planning Alex Cultice. He’ll work with catchers, in the context of how they work with pitchers. And he’ll also be front-facing with the pitchers themselves. Fasano said he expects to communicate with catchers and pitchers in-game, and work directly with the team’s analytics department. While it’s not common, it’s also not unprecedented for catchers to become pitching coaches. The most notable example is the legendary Dave Duncan, who was a pitching coach for three World Series champions and four Cy Young award winners. Charlie Greene, the Milwaukee Brewers’ bullpen coach, also spent his playing days behind the plate. “The one thing with never pitching is it’s a double-edged sword,” Fasano said. “It’s good and bad. I’ve never felt what you’ve felt, but I’ve caught a million dudes like you. I’ve seen a lot of guys pitch the way you do.” The Angels were not an effective pitching team in 2024, by almost every measure. They ranked 26th in ERA (4.56). They were 29th in walks (601), ahead of only the historically awful Chicago White Sox. And they were 28th in home runs allowed (202). Advertisement First-year pitching coach Barry Enright’s work was highly regarded throughout the season, but the pitchers struggled and were unable to execute a plan to improve in 0-0 and 1-1 counts. As a whole, the Angels are refining their strategies. And part of that is adding people like Fasano, and backup catcher Travis d’Arnaud, who both worked with a Braves pitching staff that was among the best in baseball last year. “It just didn’t get accomplished,” Enright said of his own team’s strike-throwing last year. “So I’m welcoming guys coming in to help me re-message. Help me be able to apply our strengths a little bit better into our game plan.” Both Enright and Fasano acknowledged that it can be difficult for pitchers to focus on generating swing-and-miss, while also preaching strike-throwing early in the counts. That can lead to pitchers attempting to become “too fine.” Fasano said he hopes to help simplify things for pitchers and take some of the pressure off their batterymates. Enright said that this season, he wants to create more individualized messages and strategies for each pitcher, particularly in the bullpen. He hopes to bridge the gap between the mound work, training room and weight room, something he said will take more manpower. Enright also felt that pitchers were chasing swing-and-miss more, and never established the command that necessitates generating swing-and-miss. “It’s just getting those guys to get into an attack mode, getting the catchers not to be paranoid of, ‘Oh my gosh, this is the guy’s hot spot. I’ve got to be careful of it,’” Fasano said. “And getting those guys to understand how to get to the soft zones of the hitters, still within the strengths of our pitchers.” After the 2023 season, the Angels completely revamped their pitching strategies. The team found a new pitching coach and replaced many of its pitching experts on the player development side, choosing to focus on what they’ve deemed is a more holistic approach rather than strictly on analytics. Advertisement Earlier this offseason, former assistant pitching coach Bill Hezel left the organization to be the Marlins’ director of pitching, per a league source — the last bastion of the old pitching regime departing. The team hopes that a continuity of their message, however, combined with some refining and the addition of Fasano can create a culture on the mound that far exceeds its very bad 2024 campaign. “Adding Sal, and being able to take some things, delegate some of these areas — I think Sal will do a heck of a job sprinkling his personality and experience in every one of these areas,” Enright said.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Chelsea's Reece James out of Leicester game with hamstring injury,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5937301/2024/11/21/reece-james-hamstring-injury-chelsea/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:57:32 GMT","Chelsea captain Reece James has suffered another injury setback after being ruled out of the Premier League match at Leicester City on Saturday.

Head coach Enzo Maresca has revealed that 24-year-old James sustained a minor hamstring problem during training on Tuesday. This is the ninth time James has been ruled out with a hamstring injury in the past five years. He went 18 months without completing 90 minutes in the Premier League between April 2023-October 2024 and had surgery last December in a bid to cure it for good. Advertisement But James has made just three starts for the club this campaign and is now facing another spell on the sidelines. Maresca said: “We have just one injured player and that is Reece, who unfortunately felt something small and we don’t want to take any risks for the weekend. He is the only one (right now) who is for sure not available this weekend. It’s a hamstring, a muscle problem. Hopefully it is not something long.” Chelsea play Heidenheim in the UEFA Conference League next Thursday and Maresca is already suggesting James will not be able to return for that fixture. Maresca says James’ lack of availability is more frustrating for him and added: “I know that it is not easy (for him). But if every time he gets injured it becomes hard for him, it’s for me even worse. “He has to accept that and try to avoid (injury) as much as he can. But sometimes things happen even if you want to avoid it. “Now we are playing every three days so it is probably difficult for him to be available for the Conference League. Hopefully he can be available soon.” GO DEEPER Reece James: Captain, leader, left-back The injury may have been initially described as ‘minor’ but the news that Reece James is complaining of another hamstring problem is another significant blow for the 24-year-old. James is regarded as one of the best right backs in Europe but his career has stalled since being part of the Chelsea squad which won the Champions League in 2021 — due to his volume of fitness issues. For example, the defender was on the pitch for just 482 minutes in all competitions for Chelsea last season. He has started just three games under Enzo Maresca in 2024-25 and the first of those only came last month after breaking down in pre-season. After making his comeback, Maresca warned that James is capable of only playing “once a week” for the time being. But even though his minutes have been managed, it has not prevented another issue from occurring. Advertisement James is already facing strong competition from Malo Gusto to play regularly in a Chelsea shirt. In the club’s previous fixture against Arsenal, he was named on the bench with Marc Cucurella and Gusto starting at full back. While Maresca clearly wants to include James in his plans, it is clearly not a good situation for Chelsea to be without their captain on a regular basis.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Joel Embiid on latest criticism, Sixers drama: 'Feels like negativity keeps following me'",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936953/2024/11/21/joel-embiid-sixers-team-meeting/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:56:00 GMT","Embiid said reports of the meeting, during which his tardiness was questioned by Tyrese Maxey, were overblown.","NBA MEMPHIS, Tenn. — Joel Embiid wasn’t visibly angry. His voice didn’t drip with disappointment, or some over-the-top emotion. His tone was very matter-of-fact when addressing the media following the Philadelphia 76ers’ 117-111 loss to the Grizzlies on Wednesday night. In his first public comments since Monday night’s team meeting, in which guard Tyrese Maxey spoke to Embiid about being tardy to team functions, and Tuesday’s reports of that meeting. Embiid made it clear that he heard the criticism from his teammate, who is also a good friend. He made it clear that he is accountable for those actions and plans to improve going forward. He also made it clear that he didn’t like the details of the meeting spilling into public. Advertisement “Whoever leaked that is a real piece of s—,” Embiid said. “We talked about a lot of things. I don’t want to get into detail. But that whole thing, that part of it, took probably 40 seconds. But it’s Joel Embiid, so things will always get blown out of proportion. It’s whatever, though. I’ll take it. I’m the reason for everything, so I guess I’ll take the blame for everything. “There was nothing malicious being said. I like when people are telling me when I’m not doing good and when I need to be better. That part of it (tardiness) probably happened once or twice when I wasn’t playing. So I need to be better. I need to be perfect. I need to be on point, which I’m going to do.” The frustration for Embiid comes from a culmination of events piling up in a young season that’s threatening to go further off the rails. This includes everything from his murky injury status at the beginning of the year to his three-game suspension for an altercation with a reporter, which combined to keep him off the court for Philly’s first nine games. The 76ers (2-12) are 14 games into a season they thought would allow them to compete for a championship, and in Embiid’s eyes, most of the talk around the team includes anything but actual basketball. Embiid said he thought the details of Monday’s team meeting were overblown. Not that they weren’t true. He doesn’t dispute that. But more that the conversation in the meeting was typical of teammates holding each other accountable. Embiid and Maxey have a close friendship, on and off the floor. And, indeed, following Wednesday night’s loss in Memphis, they spent a good chunk of time talking to each other in the locker room, while eating a pile of chicken wings. They have a level of friendship where they can criticize each other, if the need should arise. Advertisement What Embiid clearly didn’t like was that he had to answer for a conversation that he felt should have remained private. And the fact that it led to more questions that he needed to talk about didn’t sit well with him. “It’s kind of annoying, having to deal with the same things over and over and over,” Embiid said. “All I am trying to do is focus on basketball and be the best I can be for my family, on and off the court. But for some reason, it just feels like negativity keeps following me, which I don’t understand why. It’s a shame, but it doesn’t change the fact that we still have to do better as a team. “Right now, we don’t have a lot of margin for error.”  Of that, there is no doubt. Philadelphia’s season is teetering on the brink. The Sixers lost their fifth consecutive game on Wednesday night. They have the worst record in the NBA. They lost star wing Paul George to a hyperextended left knee, the same knee he injured during the preseason. They lost in the same way they had much of the season: turnovers, missed shots and missed assignments at inopportune times on both sides of the floor. George will be evaluated further on Thursday, but the hope is that he escaped serious injury and that everything is structurally sound with the knee. But it’s just another in a long line of maladies for the Sixers this season. For Philadelphia, whatever could go wrong has seemingly gone wrong. Wednesday night was the first time this season Embiid, George and Maxey were on the floor at the same time, although Maxey’s minutes were substantially limited after he missed six games with a strained right hamstring. Potentially losing George, even if for a limited amount of time, looms as another potential roadblock. George walked out of the locker room Wednesday night with a moderate limp. Advertisement “It sucks,” Maxey said. “I know how it feels to be hurt and to not be able to be out there and help your team. So, I definitely feel badly for Paul.” On Thursday, George echoed Embiid’s sentiments that meetings like the one the 76ers had were common, and reaction to details of the meeting being leaked to the public were being overblown. “The whole meeting, that’s normal in the NBA. Teams go through that. I’ve been on multiple teams where we’ll at some point have a meeting and a check-in if things aren’t going right or if we know we could be playing better and we’re trying to get the most out of one another. That’s normal,” George said on his podcast, “Podcast P with Paul George.” “It was healthy. It was a positive conversation. It was a healthy conversation. We all just want the best,” George said. Embiid, for his part, played his best game of the season, scoring 35 points and grabbing 11 rebounds. He made shots. He played at a good pace. He defended better than he had in his previous games. For the first time this season, he looked like Joel Embiid. The Sixers are looking for any sliver to hang on to. And once again, they have to go back to a drawing board in a season they need to figure out how to turn around. “We can still compete for a championship,” Embiid said. “But this is going to take time. A lot of our issues are coming from us not being on the same page. We have a lot of talent, but we still have to go out and actually do it. We have a pretty good chance; it would be a pretty good story if we did win. It’s just hard. You get a player back and then you potentially lose one. But whatever my body allows me to do, I’m going to go out and do it.” (Photo: Petre Thomas / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Stadium plans, Mitchell’s role and Eales’ health: An evening with Newcastle’s executives",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935146/2024/11/21/eales-mitchell-stadium-newcastle/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:53:45 GMT",Chris Waugh analyses the key takeaways as a host of Newcastle's decision makers address supporters,"EPL Communication has been a persistent theme at Newcastle United. Under Mike Ashley, there was a vacuum of information. Post-takeover, the club’s ownership have been more open. Although Amanda Staveley departed during the summer, senior figures have continued to speak. Darren Eales, the CEO, and Paul Mitchell, the sporting director, both chatted last summer. Advertisement On Wednesday, that duo were joined at STACK fan zone outside St James’ Park, by Peter Silverstone, the chief commercial officer (CCO), Brad Miller, the chief operating officer (COO), and Simon Capper, the chief financial officer (CFO). Thousands of fans were present for the “We Are United” fan event, either in person or via video. The hierarchy spoke for an hour, answering questions about Eales’ health, the search for a new CEO, Mitchell’s relationship with head coach Eddie Howe, recruitment, the future of St James’ and more. The Athletic’s Chris Waugh outlines the key takeaways. Eales spoke first about his health, following news of his chronic blood cancer diagnosis in September. “I’m doing great, thanks,” Eales said. “It’s incredible, the support I got from fans. I want to say thank you. I’m trying to take the positives.” A spontaneous round of applause followed, before Eales was asked about the timeframe for his departure and the search for his successor. He confirmed that the owners — Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) hold an 85 per cent majority stake and the Reuben family have the remaining 15 per cent — are leading that recruitment process. Former Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham has been linked, but suggestions he has been identified as the next chief executive appear premature. “I’ve got a notice period, so the intention is it’s ‘business as usual’,” Eales said. “The idea was to give that notice so we can do a search and that’s going to be led by ownership. It’s to find the best person possible and to give them the best transition so that they can hit the ground running.” At the end, Eales also received the loudest applause, with fans grateful for his dedication, despite his diagnosis. It felt like Mitchell had been waiting for this moment, given the aftermath of his media briefing in early September, when the sporting director questioned whether elements of Newcastle’s recruitment strategy had been “fit for purpose”. He did reassert his claim that he followed a “predetermined (recruitment) strategy” that was already in place, rather than leading an initial shift in direction. Advertisement “I’ve had an interesting start, I have to be honest,” Mitchell smirked, admitting that you do not want to arrive during a transfer window, as he did in July. “I’m actually 21… I looked a lot better pre-July!” A word Mitchell repeated several times was “collaboration”. Howe has regularly said the same and Mitchell did not shy away from the topic. Instead, he gave a few jibes at some of the coverage, admitting he is “not a big fan” of media and social media. “You know, I was enjoying ‘Eddie and Paul watch’ in September,” Mitchell joked, referring to questions posed towards Howe in press conferences. “‘Have they spoken to each other today?’ I actually thought that was quite good.” After his light-hearted answer, Mitchell did tackle what he accepts is a serious subject, given Howe went public with his concerns about “boundaries” in July. Mitchell praised Howe’s qualities, insisting he is “definitely” among the “talented head coaches” the sporting director has worked with across Europe. He was also complimentary about the playing style, stating that he believes it “mirrors us as a club and a fanbase”. The sporting director sees his role as working with Howe in “an intelligent way” so that Newcastle can “become competitive at the top end of the Premier League, where we want to be, and get back into Europe”. “We work closely, it’s natural collaboration,” Mitchell said. “He’s the head coach and I’m the sporting director. The notion that we live in each other’s pockets, that we spend every waking hour in each other’s company, is wrong. “Eddie is an elite professional and it would be remiss of me or any sporting director to be looking over his shoulder, to be on the training pitch, to be micromanaging someone who is extremely talented at what he does. “My job is to support, to challenge, discuss, debate — all for the benefit of the club. But we have a very talented head coach and our collaboration is as frequent or as infrequent as it needs to be… “But I have other responsibilities as well. My job is short, medium and long-term. So, unfortunately, as much as the myth of the media, and as much as I would like to, I can’t hold hands with Eddie every day. But we had the luxury of doing that at the boxing in Saudi Arabia recently (when footage captured the pair sitting together).” Advertisement The additional responsibilities he referenced included supporting the academy and the women’s team, and recruitment. He quipped that it is “my job to make those guys’ lives a living nightmare”, pointing at the panel. Alongside stressing that he was “fortunate to a degree” because of the platform he inherited, Mitchell doubled down on his view that alterations must be made to recruitment. Given the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules (PSR), he intends to tweak Newcastle’s transfer approach, implying he would look to sign younger players. “We have to continue to develop players to enhance our revenue streams because that’s how we’re going to get to where we want to as quickly as possible,” Mitchell said. “The trading model has become an important element of the modern game.” Returning to the theme of Howe and who holds the authority — and the ultimate say on incomings — Mitchell tried to myth-bust. He has not, and will not, force any players on the head coach, he insists. “Contrary to common belief, I don’t make the final decision on player trading,” Mitchell said. “No sporting director does, just to put that out there. It’s a collaborative approach. “Every sporting director and head coach, they collaborate in the final decision. We have to get a higher percentage right and make good decisions for the short, medium and long term. And that’s what we intend to do.” Interestingly, Mitchell also revealed the message he regularly repeats to his employees. He said, “I tell them: ‘Now it’s about going from good to great.’ We have super-high ambitions. We have to move forward and be aggressive.” There was a constant running theme throughout, which every panel member addressed. “I know we hate the term ‘PSR’, but it’s what we have to work to,” Eales said. “It’s unforgiving for us. We’re walking on a tightrope.” The CEO reaffirmed the ownership’s willingness to spend up to the club’s maximum, but stressed Newcastle are hindered by their present PSR limitations. He praised Howe for achieving what he has “with the backdrop of PSR” and admitted that there will be peaks and troughs. Advertisement “We can’t always do it in one window,” Eales said, seemingly referencing the summer. “We’ll have natural ebbs and flows.” That is where Silverstone’s role is crucial. As CCO, he is looking to rapidly expand revenue streams. “We need to grow quicker across different areas, it is relentless and it never stops,” Silverstone said, wearing a retro hoodie made by Adidas – a partnership he kept referencing. A proponent of STACK, Silverstone joked that it was “the only nightclub I’d like to go to” and that “we’re drinking away our PSR troubles because every pound we make goes into Paul’s transfer kitty”. While that was an intended exaggeration, a key reason behind the fan zone was to increase revenues on matchdays and non-matchdays. Highlighting trips to Japan, the U.S. and Saudi, Silverstone also suggested Newcastle will continue to look outwards in their pursuit of new commercial opportunities. “We have to project everything we do globally,” he said. For so-called ‘legacy fans’, that might be unpalatable. But in the era of ‘super clubs’, Newcastle can only realise their ambitions by first massively bolstering their revenue. “PSR is delicate and complicated for us in particular,” Mitchell said, admitting he “probably underestimated that coming in”. Mitchell also commended Howe, Eales and the recruitment team for somehow managing to avoid a points deduction in June, despite Newcastle’s perilous PSR position, because it has provided him with a platform from which to build. PSR was the reason that Capper — the self-described “bean counter” — was there. He explained that his role is to “support by providing the best team we can afford”, which he believes will require fresh thinking once the present PSR system changes to a “revenue-based model”, as is proposed from next season. Although many supporters might be sick of reading about PSR — and even sceptical about its effects — the hierarchy were keen to emphasise that it remains an ongoing impediment. The PSR message segued into the stadium question, which was the evening’s hottest topic. Rather than brush over the subject, Miller used the event to conduct a non-binding and unofficial referendum. He admitted that it was not about comparing “apples with apples” but “apples with pears” and offered up two apparently hypothetical options for fans to choose. The implication was that Newcastle have narrowed down options during a year-long feasibility study. Advertisement Seemingly two of the most serious considerations which are being further explored are “transforming” St James’ so that it looks “amazing” and “earns significantly more money”, or moving close by, to a venue which potentially has “a lot more seats” and has “the potential to earn more than twice as much revenue”. This offered the strongest hint yet that Newcastle are “seriously” considering moving nearby — Leazes Park, which is next door, is reportedly an alternative site — as opposed to an expensive redevelopment of St James’, with the increased revenue on “matchday and non-matchday” that avenue’s rationale. Miller laughed off suggestions Newcastle will be moving far afield, such as to Murrayfield, in Edinburgh, even temporarily. “If we were to move — and it wouldn’t be that far away — we weren’t looking to stretch the elastic band and the connection to the city to the point of breaking,” Miller said. The panel stressed that no decision has been made, with Eales insisting the club remain open-minded and that it is “absolutely imperative” that it will be “a fan-led decision”. The club’s Fan Advisory Board (FAB) will be consulted and wider opinion will be canvassed, but for now they continue to “develop the options”. Importantly, Eales responded to suggestions PIF is losing interest and that it might opt against providing the finance required to renovate St James’ or build a new stadium. “Absolutely (they are committed to financing it), the ownership have been incredible,” Eales said, pointing to the latest £35million ($44.4m) cash injection via a single-share issue. “They’re behind us, but we want to make the right decision and so we’ve got to flesh out what we’re going to do, present a business case, and it has to make sense for what we’re trying to do.” There were also little indicators, which were not fleshed out, that further infrastructure projects, inside the club and around the city, might be announced soon. Miller explained that his role overseeing infrastructure investments involves the stadium, the training ground, the academy and “our future plans”. He did not directly reference a new training ground, but plans to recalibrate the present site are being explored, and the long-proposed idea is that Newcastle will build a state-of-the-art facility elsewhere. Advertisement Capper, meanwhile, was asked whether infrastructure spending is exempt from PSR calculations. He replied that it was complicated, but “it’s mostly outside”. He continued: “This (STACK) is an example of the type of thing we’re looking at across the business in terms of investing capital to generate more revenue from the club going forward. We’ve got some exciting pipeline ideas. A lot of them are not quite ready to share, but they are bubbling under. And hopefully, over the next few months, we’ll be revealing a bit more about how we grow the revenue by investing in Newcastle and this club.” The implication is that Newcastle are looking at investing beyond the footprint of the stadium and into the wider city.

Plus: Homegrown player data and pundit ratings,"The Athletic FC ⚽ is The Athletic’s daily football (or soccer, if you prefer) newsletter. Sign up to receive it directly to your inbox. Hello! Always be wary of Premier League managers talking about team news. On the way: 😇 The truth about injury updates 📺 Who has the best pundits? 👦 Man Utd top for young talent ⛔ A very short managerial reign The Premier League is back on the agenda today with a flurry of pre-match press conferences — and there will be one thing on everybody’s minds. After a two-week international break, where players have limped out of fixtures, left national team camps early to be assessed, or withdrawn from squads entirely, injury news will make the headlines. Advertisement But can we trust a word managers say? Stretching the truth on player availability has become par for the course. Be it ruling players out who are in line to start or suggesting someone could be fully fit when they’re as likely to feature as your humble newsletter writer, managerial bluffing is often wrapped up in mind games with the opposition. Arsene Wenger and Steve Cooper have admitted lying about injuries in the past and, in some respects, it is understandable: an attempt to gain a competitive advantage by throwing opponents off the scent on team selection. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, who says he “doesn’t want to make it easy for anyone”, has become notorious for his vague answers. Bukayo Saka started and scored in their draw with league-leaders Liverpool last month — he’d been described as “very uncertain” to feature by Arteta. Martin Odegaard’s availability against Tottenham Hotspur in September? “Let’s see.” He had an ankle ligament injury and wouldn’t play again until November. Some managers take the opposite approach. Marcelo Bielsa was so transparent during his time at Leeds United that he’d announce his starting line-up ahead of the game. One day, he told reporters he could no longer do this after being reprimanded in the street by a supporter for giving opponents the upper hand — but then added: “Between you and me, it’s going to be the same team.” The Premier League’s approach to injury news is in stark contrast to the NFL. The league requires teams to list players’ levels of participation in training and there are injury reports ahead of matches where players are described as either questionable, doubtful or out. There is in-game injury reporting and teams can face disciplinary action if they are not compliant. In 2019, the Pittsburgh Steelers were hit with a $75,000 (£59,000) fine for falling foul of the rules. While there are reasons for and against this approach, it is unlikely to be adopted by the Premier League any time soon. One thing we do know, though: Bielsa is NFL ready. One group who would benefit from greater transparency in injury reporting is Fantasy Premier League players. Ahead of Gameweek 12, Abdul Rehman has assessed which Premier League managers’ fitness updates you can rely on — Tottenham’s Ange Postecoglou and Brighton’s Fabian Hurzeler are clearly allies of the FPL community. Arteta, Eddie Howe and Pep Guardiola? Not so much. Tim Spiers has been assessing the state of football punditry. From Europe to South America, it’s quite the varied field. Key takeaways included a grim incident in which former Fenerbahce player Serhat Akin was shot in the foot when leaving a TV studio in Turkey, while we also learnt that Brazilian fans cannot fathom why commentators from other countries do not scream “GOOOOOAAAAAAL!!” — and coverage in the United States via CBS Sports was hailed as the best around.  Fans love local academy graduates, proudly serenading their team’s youth products with chants of “he’s one of our own”. The definition of a “homegrown player”, however, is anyone who has spent three years at the club between their 15th and 21st birthdays and can encompass players signed from across the globe. Advertisement Manchester United led the way in game time for such talents last season, accounting for 28.2 per cent of their Premier League minutes, and continue to do so this term (above). United are followed by Liverpool, with both clubs benefitting not only from their academies — Kobbie Mainoo, Trent Alexander-Arnold et al — but from their ability to attract the brightest youth talent from elsewhere. Liverpool signed a 16-year-old Harvey Elliott from Fulham in 2019, while Alejandro Garnacho joined United from Atletico Madrid’s academy the following year, with both falling into the homegrown bracket. Having signed promising 16-year-old Chido Obi-Martin from Arsenal this summer, United’s pulling power endures, and likely so will their ability to field homegrown players. Something for new head coach Ruben Amorim to build on.  UEFA Women’s Champions League — Group D: Hammarby vs Manchester City, 12.45pm/5.45pm; Group C: Arsenal vs Juventus, 3pm/8pm; St Polten vs Barcelona, 3pm/8pm — all DAZN. How badly can a first day at work go? Spare a thought for Simone Bentivoglio, who was hired by Italian fourth-tier side Piacenza, took one training session and was then relieved of his duties. He became Piacenza’s second managerial sacking of the day. (Top photo: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images) Ali Rampling  is a News Editor at The Athletic.

Advertisement On top of that, I’ve culled the weekend schedule for you to know what to pay attention to. Weird bad streaks against teams? Beefs you need to track? Just fun games with matchups you may not have known were happening? We’ve got that for you. On top of that, we’ll have a good old-fashioned Throwback Thursday to hit you with that feel-good nostalgia. Let’s have fun by starting with trying to decipher just how bad this season is for the Philadelphia 76ers. The 76ers are 2-12. There’s no cute intro. There’s no storyline to weave in and out of and bring back in a full-circle kind of way. There is simply the stark reality that, after 14 games in the 2024-25 season, the 76ers possess the worst record in the league. The New Orleans Pelicans have been better despite missing at least five of their top eight guys almost every night. The Utah Jazz have been better despite being fully inclined to be a train wreck for some Cooper Flagg lottery luck in May. The Detroit Pistons show life. The Atlanta Hawks haven’t been abysmal. Heck, even the Washington Wizards woke up this morning a half-game ahead of the Sixers. Wednesday night, the Sixers finally got to debut their star trio of Joel Embiid, Paul George and Tyrese Maxey. It’s what Daryl Morey built this team around. It’s what Nick Nurse game-planned for all summer. Even though they started the season 2-11, that was all chalked up to injuries to all three of their stars. They were going to get to show off what this is supposed to look like against a Memphis Grizzlies team without Ja Morant and Zach Edey. The star trio? It played six minutes together, and there was nothing to write home about in those six minutes. Instead, everything fell apart on a night Embiid finally had a big game after three mediocre ones, as he gets his legs under him and his body back in game shape. Advertisement Maybe Sixers fans would’ve found solace in the 35 points, 11 rebounds and plus-seven stat line from Embiid. Instead, they have to key in on yet another injury. George left the game and did not return after hyperextending his left knee. If that sounds like deja vu all over again, that’s because he hyperextended that same knee roughly a month ago. It cost George the first five games of the season, and we have to hope doing it again won’t lead to a longer absence. The Sixers just got Maxey back from a hamstring injury, and they’ll be playing musical chairs with Embiid’s availability all season long. They don’t have a ton of time on the court together to build chemistry. There are plenty of caveats to throw at the Sixers in favor of patience and taking a breath. This has been a disaster so far, but we still have five more months of regular season. And they have their three stars under contract for years. Unless they have some worry that Embiid might want out at some point (he doesn’t), then there’s no real reason to panic … yet. They also own their 2025 first-round pick, as long as it falls in the top six. They sent it to the Oklahoma City Thunder (it’s always OKC) when they traded for Al Horford in 2020, but this continuing to be a disaster would only put Morey and company in position to add a top-flight prospect to the mix for the future. The bad news is nothing looks good so far. Embiid will get better. Maxey will get better. George will hopefully get healthier. Jared McCain will get even more comfortable, which is great considering his good start to the season. I think …? However, it’s the Sixers, and recent history dictates they will always disappoint. At least it can’t possibly get worse for the 76ers … because they’re officially the worst right now, and awaiting another piece of injury news. Do you plan out your weekend around your sports-viewing schedule? You’re not alone. Are you the type to want to look like a sports savant by going to your local sports bar, suggesting a game to put on and then reveling in the praise from fellow patrons you’ll get for knowing what to watch? You’re home. Are you the type to just fly by the seat of your pants and wing it last minute when you remember games are on? Bookmark this post and refer to it later! These are the best games to pay attention to this weekend. (All times Eastern) Advertisement Orlando Magic at Los Angeles Lakers, 10:30 p.m. on League Pass: The Magic just lost their league-best six-game win streak. That was tied with the Lakers, who now own the longest win streak at six. The Magic struggle to score but are elite defensively. The Lakers are elite offensively but struggle to defend. This is a perfect matchup. Indiana Pacers (0-1, minus-13) at Milwaukee Bucks (1-0, plus-14), 8 p.m. on League Pass: These were two of the best In-Season Tournament teams last year. Now, they’re both trying to get some good positioning in their group. Both teams are shockingly chasing Detroit in their group, but a big win by either would still likely put them in the driver’s seat for getting to the next round. Atlanta Hawks (2-0, plus-13) at Chicago Bulls (0-1, minus-18), 8 p.m. on League Pass: The Hawks are 2-0 in group play, and going 3-0 might just about punch their ticket into either winning the group or the wild-card spot for the single-elimination portion. Chicago has to win here to stay alive. Dallas Mavericks (1-1, plus-38) at Denver Nuggets (1-1, plus-five), 10 p.m. on ESPN: Let’s hope we get Luka Dončić and Nikola Jokić in this one. Dallas has the point differential needed to control its destiny in getting out of group play. But Denver winning would likely end that for Dallas and boost the Nuggets toward advancing. Sacramento Kings (0-1, minus-4) at LA Clippers (0-1, minus-21), 10:30 p.m. on League Pass: This should be a really fun game, and both teams have their NBA Cup lives on the line. That’s especially so for the Clippers, who got blown out in their first group play game. Golden State Warriors at San Antonio Spurs, 8:30 p.m. on League Pass: We need Victor Wembanyama in this one. If we get it, the matchup of him doing what he does and Steph Curry doing what he does will melt all conventional basketball understanding. This will be like watching basketball in a funhouse mirror. Denver Nuggets at Los Angeles Lakers, 10:30 p.m. on NBA TV: The Nuggets have been pretty vulnerable at times this season. They’re not as complete of a team as the one that dominated the Lakers the last two years. It’s time for the Lakers to see if they’ve made progress against their nemesis. Advertisement Minnesota Timberwolves at Boston Celtics, 3:30 p.m. on League Pass: The Wolves aren’t quite the same team we saw last season, but they had a couple of really fun games against the Celtics last year. Let’s see if Anthony Edwards can challenge these guys again. Dallas Mavericks at Miami Heat, 6 p.m. on League Pass: The Heat got the Mavs in 2006. The Mavs got the Heat in 2011. This one will officially be the rubber match 18 years in the making. Let’s hope everybody plays in this one. LA Clippers at Philadelphia 76ers, 6 p.m. on League Pass: James Harden revenge game! Maybe Paul George will be able to play and have his own revenge game! Honestly, let’s just hope Philadelphia makes it competitive because this is getting rough. After Dalton Knecht dropped 37 points on the lowly Utah Jazz on Tuesday night, there was a bit of a debate in one of my group chats about the Los Angeles Lakers rookie. We were debating if he’s already really good. Low first-round pick. Dropped 27 and 37 in consecutive nights on the two worst defenses in the league. Also had 20 total points over a five-game stretch and really hasn’t done much against good teams so far. We’re also super early into the season. He might be another Duncan Robinson. He might even be more than that. At one point, it led to me making the joke, “Knecht is what Jason Kapono is supposed to be.” That led to a friend calling Kapono “a 6-foot-8 5-11 guy,” which made me laugh. That’s when we all ventured down the rabbit hole that is a late-night basketball discussion about a random player. It’s the stuff group chats were created to do. I started trying to figure out if my memory about Kapono was accurate. It was and wasn’t. I correctly remembered that Kapono was once on an episode of “Sports Science” to see if you could get a shot off in a quicker amount of time than the NBA rulebook says. Do you know about the “Trent Tucker Rule?” Back in 1990, Tucker hit a 3-point shot to give the New York Knicks the win over the Chicago Bulls. He caught the ball with 0.1 seconds on the clock, fired, and it went in. This led to the NBA implementing the rule that you legally can’t get a jump shot off in less than 0.3 seconds. Only tip-ins are legal when there’s less than 0.3 seconds on the clock. It was put into the NBA rulebook by the very next season. On that episode of “Sports Science,” Kapono was tasked with trying to get a shot off with less than 0.3 seconds on the clock. He had a glove with sensors to help them truly measure when the ball left his fingertips. They also brought in Jordan Farmar to do the inbound pass to Jason, and generously called Farmer “one of the game’s rising young stars.” No offense to Farmar, who did play in 504 NBA games over 10 seasons. But that’s a ridiculous way to frame his presence. Although he did finish 11th in Sixth Man voting the year this episode came out. They let us know it takes 0.3 seconds to blink an eye. That’s how quick this shot has to be. Kapono’s first attempt was 0.38 seconds, and he made the shot. On the next attempt they showed, he actually broke the rule. He took and made a 3-point shot in 0.22 seconds, which doesn’t even sound real.  Where my memory failed me is how many NBA games Kapono played in. I would have guessed about 200, give or take a few. I couldn’t have been more wrong. He played in 509 career games. Tack on another 10 for playoff games, including getting a ring in 2006 with the Miami Heat. While Kapono did win back-to-back 3-point contests in 2007 and 2008, I fully blocked out his career with the Heat. He played there for two seasons after his rookie year in Cleveland (same rookie year as LeBron James) and his second season with the Charlotte Bobcats. In Year 2 with Miami, Kapono led the league in 3-point percentage with 51.4 percent on 3.1 attempts per game. Advertisement That led to a discussion in the group chat about whether or not Pat Riley used him correctly in the 2006-07 season. I couldn’t believe the Heat won 44 games with Kapono playing 26 minutes per game. The other side of the Kapono discussion was how Riley had him fourth in 3-point attempts behind James Posey (37.5 percent), Jason Williams (33.9 percent) and Antoine Walker (27.5 percent). This delighted me because Walker was always one of my favorite good-bad players. He was a star on the Boston Celtics for years, before moving on to the Heat after brief stops in Dallas and Atlanta. Walker was such a star in Boston that NBA Live 99 made a commercial with the video game version of Walker, “Cyber ‘Toine,” spliced into real highlights.  It’s how my friends and I referred to Walker for years. Cyber ‘Toine. He spent two years with the Heat. He was productive and helpful as a sixth man in the title run in 2006. Then, in 2007 — the same year Kapono hit 51.4 percent of his 3-pointers on fewer attempts (3.1) per game than ‘Toine (3.9) — Walker had what I described as “a perfect ‘Toine season.” He averaged 8.5 points in 23.3 minutes for Miami. He took more shot attempts (668) than he scored points (660). He also had more turnovers (141) than assists (130). I mentioned he shot 27.5 percent from deep, and I’ll remind you he once said he takes so many 3-pointers because there are no 4-pointers. He shot 32.5 percent from deep for his career. It may sound like I’m just making fun of Walker, but I promise I mean this all as a celebration. I love gunners who live by one unwavering principle, which is to get shots up and score points. I truly appreciate that concept on so many levels. Walker was so much more than that for a good portion of his career, but ultimately he was always a gunner at heart — apparently one Riley trusted more than Kapono.

The league’s only international destination for the 2025 regular season will be Tokyo, for the opening series between the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers, March 18-19. “We’re not going to San Juan,” commissioner Rob Manfred said. “We did not have, despite a lot of efforts, an arrangement that made economic sense for us. We’d still like to do San Juan, and what’s available kind of changes year to year, and I’m hopeful it works out in the future.” Advertisement A return to Mexico City is likely in 2026, Manfred said. “We had a really, really aggressive international play undertaking last season. … But we’ve been to Mexico the last few years in a row, and we’re taking one year off. We’ll be back, though.” The current collective bargaining agreement, which covers the 2022 to 2026 seasons, includes a tentative schedule for international play. MLB listed four destinations for 2025: Tokyo for Opening Day, Mexico City in June, Paris in June and San Juan in September.  The Paris plan went by the wayside last year because the league couldn’t find a promoter.  “Tokyo is really our focus right now for very, very good business reasons,” Manfred said. The original schedule has the league going to Mexico City in May 2026, London in June and San Juan in September.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Hall of Fame mailbag: Stark on Ichiro, CC Sabathia, Dustin Pedroia, Dick Allen and more",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5937113/2024/11/21/hall-of-fame-ichiro-sabathia-pedroia/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:03:15 GMT",Let’s dive into another edition of our ever-popular Hall of Fame subscriber mailbag.,"MLB Ichiro! … Billy Wagner! … CC Sabathia! … Dustin Pedroia! They’re all on the 2025 Baseball Hall of Fame ballot that was unveiled this week. I don’t know if Ichiro is about to get 100 percent of the vote. But I was 100 percent certain you’d have lots of fun, thoughtful questions about that — and a bunch of other storylines swirling over this year’s Hall election. Advertisement Of course, you didn’t let me down. The questions were great. I apologize that I couldn’t get to them all. So now let’s dive into another edition of our ever-popular Hall of Fame subscriber mailbag. Note: Submitted questions have been edited for clarity and length. If the Hall of Fame had a special “best of the best” wing (for people like Ruth, Gibson, Mays, etc.), and you had a vote, would you put Ichiro in it? Why or why not? Psst. I would. 🙂 — Mathew P. Hey Mathew! You’re really trying to get me into trouble here. No matter how I answer, why do I think there might be a few billion people who disagree? Aw, whatever. Here’s my big question: How large would this wing be, anyway? Ten players? How about 25? More? Less? I need help with that, because it would determine how I would answer your question. You did cause me to hand out a homework assignment — to myself — to try to list who else would be in that wing. I got to 20 position players pretty easily. I haven’t done that list with pitchers yet, but I’m guessing I wouldn’t have any trouble finding 20 of them, either. So as long as your wing had 50 plaques, here’s my verdict: Ichiro belongs! And yes, I’m aware that he has fewer wins above replacement than Sal Bando and the same career OPS+ as Rance Mulliniks. To me, that’s a lesson in why we need to look at more than just WAR and OPS+ when we go through the voting process. Everything else about Ichiro screams all-time Hall of Famer, as you obviously know. We would probably have to acknowledge the Japan years to get him there, but I’m cool with that if you are. Once we include his Japan statistics, we’re talking about a player who got more hits than anyone who ever lived! And if that doesn’t get a guy into the Best of the Best wing, it’s time to find a new name for that wing. Fun question! Advertisement How much do voters take international achievements and stats into account? Of course, Ichiro would have been a Hall of Famer just based on his MLB numbers alone, but I think it’s because of his 1,278 hits in Japan that we have elevated him to potentially unanimous territory. If Yoshinobu Yamamoto has Mark Buehrle’s exact career, would his time in NPB be enough to put him in? Is it fair to only account for NPB stats but not other leagues like KBO? — David P. David, I know I just wrote two paragraphs ago that I’d take Ichiro’s Japanese feats into account if I were deciding who gets into the “Best of the Best” wing. But ignore that! That’s just the tiebreaker in deciding admission to a wing that doesn’t even exist in real life. You know what does exist in real life? The actual Hall of Fame plaque gallery. And we are definitively not supposed to use international stats in that voting. We’re instructed to vote on a player’s career in the “major leagues” — which does not include the NPB, KBO or any other international leagues. So Yamamoto’s Hall of Fame meter started ticking in 2024, not on the other side of the Pacific. Thanks for the excellent question. GO DEEPER Untold stories of Ichiro: Wrestling with Griffey, All-Star speeches and ‘Ichi wings’ How big of a role does strategic voting have in preventing unanimous selections? How anyone could leave Ichiro off their ballot is beyond me, but I do admit that I appreciate a voter throwing their hat into the ring for, say, Billy Wagner in the hopes of keeping him on the ballot. — Carl M. All right, let’s do one more quick Ichiro question because it’s not just Hall of Fame season. It’s Ichiro season! Your question is right on point because ballot management is a thing these days for a lot of voters. A few years ago, the Baseball Writers’ Association of America asked the Hall of Fame to let us vote for more than 10 players on the ballot. The Hall said: Sorry! So here we are. Advertisement That means that in a year like this one, with such a deep ballot, it’s going to be tempting for some voters to say: I know Ichiro is getting in, so I’d better vote for Félix Hernández to make sure he isn’t one and done. It stinks that we have to think that way and vote that way. But I’m convinced that’s why Derek Jeter and Ken Griffey Jr. weren’t unanimous. So would it shock me if it happens again to Ichiro? Ha. How could it? How can you justify voting for Billy Wagner with dozens (if not hundreds) of pitchers left out of Cooperstown who inarguably contributed more to their teams than Wagner? Personally, I think it’s a joke that Wagner is considered a viable candidate when someone like Bret Saberhagen is thought of as a non-candidate — and for that matter, that Jack Morris was regarded as borderline before he was inducted. Note: I wouldn’t vote for Andy Pettitte either, but you could fit four of Wagner’s careers into one of Pettitte’s. — James S. James, my friend, I hate to break this to you, but “relief pitcher” is a real position. In fact, you might have noticed that relief pitchers are beginning to take over the Baseball Earth, while starting pitchers try to avoid extinction. I’m not trying to go all Jurassic Park on you. I’m just making a point. I’m not a fan of the decline of starting pitching. If I were the king of baseball, I’d do everything I could to fight that. But here in the real world, our mission is to look at the world that exists — not the world we wish would exist. And since “closer” was a real job for all 16 seasons that Wagner pitched in the big leagues, I think my assignment as a voter is to assess where he ranked among the closers of his time — and of all time. As I’ve written for a decade, he was such a dominator within the definition of that job, he owns the best ERA, WHIP and strikeout rate of any left-handed reliever ever. So why do I vote for him? That’s why. As my friend Brian Kenny from MLB Network always says, we’re not talking about a guy who was the eighth-best or 12th-best. He was THE best. So to dismiss Wagner because he pitched fewer innings than Pettitte isn’t fair, just as it wouldn’t be fair to Pettitte to say: I’m not voting for that guy because he didn’t have rate stats as good as Billy Wagner’s. I hope that makes sense. That’s how I look at it anyway. I know not everyone does — and that’s why we vote on this stuff! Advertisement Wagner’s postseason numbers have been used against him for Hall consideration. Please restate your position on how misleading these numbers are for your fellow voters. — Richard T. Thanks, Richard. Look, it’s hard to argue that any voter should just ignore Wagner’s 10.03 postseason ERA. All I’ve tried to do is go game by game and see what that tells us. What it told me is that his teams had a shockingly hard time getting him the ball with the lead at the end of these games. This guy only had four postseason save opportunities in 16 seasons. Four. And he blew only one of them — the first one. So as much as we want to compare him to Mariano Rivera, Mariano got 47 of those postseason save opportunities. Here’s the other stunning thing I found: In a decade and a half in the big leagues, Wagner faced only 30 hitters with a lead in the postseason. Again, is it fair to compare him to Mariano — who faced over 400? When I vote, I prefer large samples over small samples. So if you believe the postseason is the reason not to vote for this man — as opposed to 900 innings of regular-season domination — that’s too small a sample to disqualify him, at least for me. I understand that for closers, October is never irrelevant. But where does that fit in the big balancing act we do with almost every candidate? All I can do is explain where it fits for me. GO DEEPER How a broken arm — and an unbroken spirit — took Billy Wagner to the doorstep of the Hall CC (Sabathia) was a good pitcher but is a compiler at best. He has 62 WAR, which averages to 3.3 WAR (per season). — Pep V. Pep, I appreciate your perspective. I just could not disagree with it more. CC pitched for a long time (19 seasons). That’s not the same thing as being “a compiler.” I think a “compiler” is a guy who strings together a bunch of league-average seasons, one after another, but never rises above that level. Someone like Edwin Jackson (with all due respect to his long career) — he’s a compiler. Sabathia is almost the opposite of that. Advertisement A guy who owns a Cy Young Award and five top-five finishes is not a compiler. … A guy who led his league in shutouts four times is not a compiler. … A guy who got traded in midseason, as Sabathia did in 2008 to Milwaukee, and said, “Jump on my back. I’ll make five straight starts on short rest to save our season” — that’s not a compiler. … A guy who got signed to a huge contract with New York in 2009, then had a sub-2.00 postseason ERA (over five starts) as his team went on to win the World Series — that’s not a compiler. Obviously, in the last five years of his career, he wasn’t That Guy anymore. But don’t let those back-end years obscure the great years. And don’t just look at the WAR column when you’re evaluating him — or anyone on this ballot. Look at literally everything. When you do that with CC, you see so much more than “compiling.” It’s obviously not going to happen this year, but will (Dustin) Pedroia ever make it into the Hall? It’s such a shame his career ended the way it did right in the middle of his peak years. Is he a Koufax candidate? Short but massively impactful career. — Andrew W. Andrew, I was hoping someone would ask me about Pedroia — one of the most fun, most watchable and most charismatic players of the 21st century. He’s a tricky Hall case. So I think we’ll be talking a lot about him over these next couple of months. We’ll never know how his career would have unfolded if that Manny Machado slide hadn’t happened in 2017. But we do know Pedroia was on a Hall of Fame track when it did. It’s never easy to decide what we should do, as voters, with players like him. I thought David Wright was a very similar player when he arrived on last year’s ballot, so I made sure to vote for him just to help him make it to Year 2. I could see myself doing the same with Pedroia, because he’s comparable not only to Wright but also to Chase Utley, another force of nature at second base whose career totals were stifled by injuries. Utley got 28 percent of the vote last year, so I think that offers hope for the Pedroia fans. And as I wrote in my Five Things to Watch on the Hall of Fame ballot column, I have a feeling Utley will get elected someday. That’s because I see our philosophy as voters evolving over the next few years — away from the counting numbers of yesteryear and toward players with dominant peaks, whose impact on winning was undeniable. And doesn’t that describe Dustin Pedroia? Advertisement During the 10 seasons from 2007-16, he ranked fifth in the entire sport in WAR — behind only Robinson Canó, Adrian Beltré, Albert Pujols and Miguel Cabrera — and won an MVP, Rookie of the Year and two World Series along the way. I’m really curious to see what his vote total looks like as he goes through the next decade. But first, we have to make sure he gets enough votes to stay on the ballot this year! Please explain the differentiation between Andruw Jones and Jim Edmonds. (And for that matter Dale Murphy, Kenny Lofton, etc.) Jones and Edmunds had nearly identical WAR, home runs, All-Star (appearances), etc. Both were elite Gold Glove center fielders. Jones had slightly more RBIs and Gold Gloves; Edmonds had more hits and a better batting average, slugging percentage, OPS and OPS+ plus a World Series title. Jones keeps getting votes/consideration, but Edmonds was one-and-done. In my opinion, they’re either both HOFers or neither. — Jordan H. Jordan, you’re firing that question at a guy who didn’t vote for Andruw Jones for six elections in a row — for that very reason. I’ve brought up the Jones versus Edmonds comps so many times, but this is the perfect occasion to do it again. I’ve been open about what always stopped me from voting for Jones — that he drove his career over a cliff at age 30 and was such a non-presence, he was worth a total of 1.7 WAR from ages 31-35. So how could people justify comparing him to Willie Mays, which still happens all the time? The player we should be comparing him with is Edmonds, who played in the same era, but was still collecting Gold Gloves at 35. Edmonds won eight Gold Gloves, had a career 132 OPS+ and didn’t even make it to a second year on the ballot. Jones won 10 Gold Gloves, but also had a 111 OPS+ and wasn’t even a league-average defender in his 30s. There is also this: Seasons with a Gold Glove and 120 OPS+ or higher Jim Edmonds — 8
Andruw Jones — 4 Advertisement I’m still embarrassed that Edmonds (and Lofton) fell off the ballot so fast. In Edmonds’ case, he got crushed by an overloaded 2016 ballot that included 11 future Hall of Famers, plus Billy Wagner — not to mention Curt Schilling, Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Gary Sheffield, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Jeff Kent. But whatever the reason, it took me all the way until the 2024 election to finally vote for Andruw Jones. In large part, that was because Edmonds’ shadow hung over my evaluation. And you know what? It still does. If Jones makes the Hall, I’m good with it. But if he does, let’s just say I sure hope the Contemporary Baseball Era Committee is paying attention. And speaking of those Era committees … Dick Allen has another chance on (the Classic Baseball Era ballot). Is the third time the charm? — Kevin M. Believe it or not, Kevin, this is actually Allen’s seventh time on one of these Era Committee/Veterans Committee ballots. The first was over two decades ago. But I know you’re referring to the last two, when he missed by only one vote — 10 years ago and three years ago. I’ve served on these committees, and I appreciate their value. But I also know how they work. So I highly recommend not trying to predict how they’ll vote. That’s especially true with this committee, which will meet in a couple of weeks — since right now, we still don’t even know the 16 members who will be voting. OK, now that I have that preamble out of the way, if I were on this committee, I’d vote for Dick Allen. And his combination of credentials and narrative seems as if it would make him the kind of candidate most likely to show up on 12 of the 16 ballots. For one thing, he’s already gotten 11 votes twice. And everyone who got more votes in those two elections now has a plaque in the gallery. That seems helpful. Advertisement But you know what’s even more helpful? Allen has a Hall of Fame case that feels more aligned with these times than those times. Over his 11-year peak, from 1964-74, he led the entire sport in OPS+ (165), with a parade of legends and Hall of Famers behind him. He was second in slugging (.554) in that glorious era, behind only Henry Aaron (.561). And Allen and Aaron were the only two players in baseball with at least 300 homers and 100 stolen bases over those years. Add in an MVP, a Rookie of the Year award and two home run titles — and it gives the committee a reason to downplay Allen’s lack of counting numbers (1,848 hits, 351 career homers) and the controversies that hung over him during the turbulent times in which he played. It was those counting numbers and controversies that kept him from gaining any real traction on the writers’ ballot. But that was then. This is the 2000s. This committee also will be well aware of how close he came in the previous two elections — and that, sadly, he didn’t live to see the Induction Day that now feels inevitable. So it feels as if his stars are finally aligned. But have I mentioned that predicting these committees is a really bad idea?

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Sara Errani serves up another tennis trophy for Italy at the Billie Jean King Cup,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936031/2024/11/21/sara-errani-tennis-player-italy-serve/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:01:10 GMT","The 37-year-old completed a career Golden Slam in 2024, and has built a remarkable career behind one major weakness.","Tennis MALAGA, Spain — Sara Errani stands at the baseline and exhales deeply. She is about to hit a second serve, with Italy up match point against Poland. A place in the Billie Jean King Cup final is at stake. So Errani does what she has done many, many times before: she hits an underarm serve. The ball floats into the service box and onto the racket of Iga Swiatek, one of two women’s players who can claim to be the best in the world. Swiatek is on to it in a flash and hits her return deep to Errani’s forehand. Errani again does what she has done many, many times before: she gets the ball back. Advertisement She does the same on her opponent’s next shot, hoisting a backhand lob into the air. Swiatek loops a forehand volley long and Italy is through to the final for the second year in a row. Errani collapses to the ground in relief, celebrating with her partner Jasmine Paolini and shaking hands with the defeated opponents a few seconds later, before allowing herself a what-have-I-just-done smile.  For Errani, 37, it was another successful heist in a career full of them. On Wednesday, she added a fourth Billie Jean King Cup title (three of which came when it was the Federation Cup) to the career Golden Grand Slam in doubles she completed this year by winning gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics alongside Paolini. It has been a stunning year for Errani, who also won the mixed doubles title at the U.S. Open with another Italian, Andrea Vavassori. She thought 2024 would be her last on tour, having won her last major 10 years ago. “My thought last year was to play in the Olympics and then stop playing tennis, but we’re playing great in doubles and I’m having so much fun,” she said in an interview in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, at the WTA Tour Finals earlier this month. Completing the doubles Golden Slam in Paris put Errani in an elite group of just seven women. When looking back on her career, the underarm serve to Swiatek on Monday will feel like a defining moment for a player who uses the contentious tactic more consistently and more particularly than anybody else. Her story with the underarm serve goes to the heart of her tennis life. The underarm serve is one of tennis’s most curious shots, caught between the poles of disrespectful trick shot and tactical masterstroke. Big servers like Nick Kyrgios can use it to take advantage of opponents who are standing back anticipating a 140mph rocket. There is an element of showmanship too; this is very much the case with Alexander Bublik. He might be blessed with a big serve, but he is also the current player probably most synonymous with the cheeky alternative. Advertisement Other players use it against specific opponents. World No. 68 Alexandre Muller told The Athletic at Wimbledon that he had specifically practised the shot to use it against Daniil Medvedev, who has one of the deepest return positions in the sport. Corentin Moutet, a master of the shot, started practising underarm serves after a shoulder injury. He has since incorporated them into his game, doing so to great acclaim at this year’s French Open. He used the underarm serve 12 times in his third-round win against Sebastian Ofner, winning nine of those points. He is the opposite of a player like Kyrgios, using the underarm serve because he doesn’t expect to win free points behind his first serve; there is no drop-off in expected value. GO DEEPER How Corentin Moutet's 12 underarm serves shook Roland Garros Errani’s reason for using the shot will be familiar to many amateur players: she just doesn’t trust her serve. Errani stands at 5ft 5in (164cm) which is diminutive by modern tennis standards — just like her partner Paolini, whose serve has some heat despite her height of 5ft 4in. Errani does not have this pace, and her height has contributed to a shot often derided as the worst serve in the sport. Smiling, she says it would be amazing to be a bit taller. “Many times, I think about that.” Instead of letting her serve become a complete albatross, Errani has used her ground skills, tactical nous and the shock factor of a serve that regularly registers around 60mph (96.5kph) on the speed gun to reach the very top of tennis in singles and doubles. She reached the 2012 French Open final in singles and cracked the world’s top five a year later, despite her opponents feeling that they ought to break her every single game. Instead, they are bamboozled by her incredible dexterity at the net or from the back of the court, as well as struggling to read and return her serve. “It comes so slow and it kind of floats in the air,” Mirjana Lucic-Baroni said in a news conference after losing to Errani in the 2014 U.S. Open fourth round, a match in which Errani’s average serve speed was 76mph. “It was really difficult to time the balls.” Errani’s serve became something of a meme in 2024 after Daniil Medvedev completely failed to return it at all during a mixed doubles match at the Paris Olympics. Advertisement Errani herself said in a news conference after that match that she has a different approach to serving from most players: “I don’t try to make winners,” she said. “I just try to make kick, make slice, try to change my game. I need to start the point where I want. So sometimes is better for me to serve not that fast, because if you serve fast the ball is coming (back) faster.” That conviction hasn’t always been there. Her serve reached a nadir in April 2019 when she was only recently back from a 10-month doping suspension for ingesting letrozole, which was increased from an original two months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Errani said she was “really disgusted” by the length of the ban, saying that her case was because of contamination after her mother, who was taking letrozole for breast cancer, dropped pills on their kitchen counter where they prepared meals. At the Copa Colsanitas in Bogota, Colombia, Errani served 18 double faults per match in three consecutive matches (all of which she won) before hitting around half her serves underarm in a quarter-final defeat to Astra Sharma. Later that year at a low-level event in Asuncion, Paraguay, Errani took the nuclear option by serving underarm for the entire tournament. She reached the final, copping a huge amount of social media abuse in the process. In response, she wrote on Instagram: “In Italy, I keep being insulted by a lot of people, regarding mainly my serve. “If it is not ok for you, send a letter to WTA asking to change rules about serve or ask them to disqualify me for awful serve. If instead you just have other problems with me, send a letter to Santa.” Five years on, she says her serve had completely overtaken everything else. “I couldn’t compete. I was thinking all the time about my serve,” she says. Advertisement “My coach said: ‘Do one tournament all underarm and just compete.’ It was to try to make my head free from, not panic, but the tough moments.” Despite recovering from those yips, Errani then endured an anxiety dream of a service game at the 2020 French Open during a second-round defeat to Kiki Bertens. Errani was given two time violations after five aborted ball tosses and landed only one overarm serve, with one attempt missing the baseline. Serving for the set, she was broken to love.  “Sometimes it’s there and it can come out, but I try to manage it,” she says of the nerves that can grip her when serving. “When I was practising, my serve was good. But then in matches, I was feeling the block, the panic. I know it’s still there. It’s not like it’s in the past.” Errani, an unwitting trailblazer, can laugh at the fact that the underarm serve has come back into fashion, certainly on the men’s side, over the past few years. “If it can be a good tactic, why not?” she laughs. Against Swiatek, the decision was more of a vibe. “I just advised Jasmine after the first serve, so it’s just I feel it and I did it, just like that, not thinking too much,” she said in a news conference after the match. At 37, Errani is the Italian team’s most experienced player, and as her team-mates chorused in Wednesday’s celebratory news conference she is “the brain of the team”. Errani resembles her compatriot Jorginho, the Brazilian-born Italy and Arsenal midfielder who is so intelligent that he is a reference point for everybody else despite not being the most physically gifted. GO DEEPER Jorginho exclusive: Arsenal 'energy', no-hop penalties, love for Havertz, knowing strengths Paolini, who is the world No. 4 in singles and a two-time Grand Slam finalist this year, constantly looks to Errani for guidance on the doubles court. “She wants me to tell her what to do every point – even when she serves, she likes me to tell her where to put it and I’m trying to push her to tell me what she’s feeling more,” Errani said. Whatever the tactics, the Errani-Paolini partnership is contributing to a golden period for tennis in Italy. On the men’s side, Jannik Sinner is the world No. 1 and has won two Grand Slams this year. He is part of an Italy team that is hoping to defend the Davis Cup this week and make it a double with the victorious BJK Cup group. Errani, who lived through a period when she was one of the ‘Fab Four’ Italian women who all reached a Grand Slam final and the world’s top 10 between 2010 and 2014 (Francesca Schiavone, Roberta Vinci and Flavia Pennetta were the others), believes that all the current top players from her country are pushing each other to greater heights. Advertisement And Errani has no desire to leave the golden age behind just yet.  “I said to Jasmine: ‘I’ll continue next year for sure and then we’ll see,’” she says. After the genre-defining underarm serve against Swiatek, this wily veteran still has at least one last heist in her.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Raiders' Brock Bowers having a historic rookie season despite team's struggles,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936372/2024/11/21/brock-bowers-raiders-rookie-tight-end-oroy/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:00:55 GMT","The Raiders have lost six straight games amid major turmoil on offense, but their first-year tight end is putting up incredible numbers.","NFL HENDERSON. Nev. — Brock Bowers is a man of few words. Davante Adams dubbed the rookie “Business Man” because of his stoic demeanor. As of late, though, the Las Vegas Raiders tight end is starting to loosen up. After scoring a touchdown against the Miami Dolphins last week, he hit a viral dance to celebrate. When passing quarterback Gardner Minshew II at team headquarters Wednesday, Bowers blew him a kiss. He’s getting more comfortable and confident, and it’s translating to his play on the field. 🕺 #LVvsMIA pic.twitter.com/VYJFcO8DAj — Las Vegas Raiders (@Raiders) November 17, 2024  “At the beginning of the year, stuff was flying everywhere,” Bowers said Wednesday. “With each game, the game’s slowed down.” Bowers has been historically good this season. He has 70 catches (second in the NFL) for 706 yards (10th) and three touchdowns (tied for fifth among tight ends). He’s on pace to break the single-season rookie record for catches regardless of position and could set the rookie mark for receiving yards by a tight end. Advertisement Only one tight end has won the Offensive Rookie of the Year award — Mike Ditka in 1961 — but Bowers is building a strong case to become the second. Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels, Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix and New York Giants receiver Malik Nabers also have strong OROY cases, but none have been as productive relative to his peers as Bowers. Bowers leads all tight ends in catches and receiving yards. Travis Kelce, Trey McBride and George Kittle are all putting up excellent numbers at the position, but Bowers’ receiving production leads the pack. “It’s unbelievable,” Minshew said Sunday. “We’re putting so much emphasis on him. … In every situation, we’re calling on him and he’s delivering, man.” Bowers is coming off the best game of his career. Against the Dolphins, he had 13 catches (the most ever in a game by a rookie tight end) for 126 yards (career high) and a touchdown. The 21-year-old sensation is only getting better. Brockin' and Rollin!#LVvsMIA | 📺 @paramountplus pic.twitter.com/tUq5NzKADV — Las Vegas Raiders (@Raiders) November 17, 2024  “At the end of the season, you get to relax and reflect a little bit,” Bowers said of appreciating his accomplishments, “but we’re not there yet.” The area where Kittle maintains a decisive edge over Bowers is as a blocker. While Bowers has been better than expected in that realm, Kittle still has a leg up when it comes to being the best all-around tight end in the league. And while Kelce is so-so as a blocker and has slowed as a receiver, his longevity and lengthy playoff resume can’t be dismissed. Regardless, a rookie simply being in the conversation with the likes of Kittle and Kelce is wildly impressive. That success hasn’t gone to his head. “There’s always another week coming,” Bowers said. “I’ve always got something to prove.” Advertisement Raiders tight ends coach Luke Steckel knew Bowers was capable of making this type of impact the first time he watched his college film. He saw a naturally gifted player who jumped off the screen. His physical traits (speed, size, play strength and athleticism) were alluring, but he also displayed a nuanced skill set that featured crisp route running, an ability to find favorable angles to come back to the quarterback and exceptional ball skills. “He’s probably the best tight end I’ve ever evaluated coming out of college,” Steckel said Tuesday. “We’ve had really high expectations for him, and he’s certainly lived up to those.” It’s tough to find a recent comparison for Bowers’ college career. In three years at Georgia, he amassed accolades that included three All-America selections, three All-SEC selections, two John Mackey Awards and two national championships. But while there was little doubt Bowers was one of the best players in the 2024 draft, the Raiders didn’t feel like a fit. Las Vegas had bigger needs at quarterback, offensive line and cornerback, and it had just taken tight end Michael Mayer in the second round the year before. That led to a lukewarm external reaction to the pick despite Bowers’ talent. But general manager Tom Telesco viewed him as the best player available, and the coaching staff concurred. “The day he walked in the door, we knew we were getting a blue-chipper,” coach Antonio Pierce said in September. And just 10 games into Bowers’ career, it’s looking like the right move for the Raiders. “It means we picked the right guy in the draft,” Pierce said Monday. “(He’s a) tremendous talent.” GO DEEPER Raiders' baby steps with new offensive staff aren't enough in sixth straight loss Perhaps the best part of Bowers’ game has been his ability to create yards after the catch. He has 378 yards after the catch this season (seventh in the NFL). “His ability to run after the catch is obviously pretty big,” Mayer said Sunday. “It’s huge — being that size and being able to wiggle around and find the space and find open spots.” Advertisement Bowers said, “I just catch the ball and run with it,” earlier this season when asked what makes him so good after the catch. That’s a bit of an oversimplification. “He’s so strong with the ball in his hands,” Steckel said. “He’s got a natural forward lean when he runs. So when he’s tackled, he’s always going to be falling forward for an extra 3 or 4 yards. … You see him catch the ball, run with good ball security, have that forward lean and really have the strength in his lower body to run through defenders. And then when they fall asleep on him, I think he’s got a little twitch in his system to make guys miss, as well. … His natural ability just takes over.” Bowers has a knack for getting open, but that’s partially a result of his cerebral approach to the game. He’s had growing pains like any other rookie, but he’s learned from his mistakes. “He’s a really smart player,” Steckel said. “He sees the game clearly. He’s able to process information quickly. … The learning curve certainly wasn’t as steep for him as it is for other rookies coming in, in my experience. … And then the results just speak for themselves.” GO DEEPER How did the Raiders roster get so bad? A series of unfortunate events The knock on Bowers coming out of college was his blocking ability. He spent most of his time at Georgia lined up as a slot receiver and is a lighter tight end at 230 pounds. He certainly has room to grow in the blocking department, but he’s been able to hold his own. “As a tight end, you’ve got to have the mentality that you’re a blocker first,” Steckel said. “That physical element of the game and that toughness that’s required to go do your job on the line of scrimmage, he’s done that every time he’s called upon. Obviously, he does so much for us in the pass game that we try to utilize as much as possible, but we’re not afraid to put him in a 3-point stance and have him block a defensive end. … That’s something that separates him from a lot of other tight ends in this league who have a lot of success in the passing game is he excels as a blocker, as well. There’s really no limitations to his game.” Bowers’ performance this season has come despite poor quarterback play, unreliable pass protection, a non-existent run game, a mediocre receiving corps and a change in offensive coordinator and play caller. That paints an exciting picture of what he could do in a more functional offense. Advertisement Since Adams requested a trade in Week 5, Bowers has been the Raiders’ No. 1 receiving option. The coaches have moved him around often to find favorable matchups — he lines up as an in-line tight end, slot receiver, outside receiver and in the backfield — but opposing defenses have still found ways to send extra help his way. Yet that hasn’t stopped the rookie from being productive every week. The Raiders’ collective struggles could ultimately be what prevent Bowers from winning OROY. Nix has kept the Broncos (6-5) in the playoff picture, and the same goes for Daniels with the Commanders (7-4). Meanwhile, Bowers and the Raiders sit at just 2-8. That may not seem fair to Bowers, but team success has historically factored into voting for awards. Regardless of the postseason plaudits, what’s clear is that the Raiders have landed a star. Moving forward, the hope is he’ll be a cornerstone for the offense that helps change the franchise’s fortunes. “We’re trying everything we can to feature our best player (on offense),” Pierce said. “We just need more and more guys to keep making more plays like him.” Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Anthony Richardson shined in his Colts return, but one great game isn't enough",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935963/2024/11/21/colts-anthony-richardson-consistent-lions/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:00:21 GMT",Richardson has shown flashes of brilliance before. What he needs to show now is that he can become a consistent force leading the Colts.,"NFL Mo Alie-Cox could feel it. As one of the last players in the Indianapolis Colts locker room who played alongside Andrew Luck, the veteran tight end remembers what it’s like to witness a great quarterback take over. The word he used to describe Richardson’s fourth-quarter performance against the Jets? “Cooking,” Alie-Cox said, laughing, as he reflected on New York’s helplessness. GO DEEPER Anthony Richardson's revival, Brock Bowers' brilliance, more Week 11 thoughts: Quick Outs Richardson didn’t look like the erratic second-year pro who had many people questioning whether he could ever become a franchise QB. He looked like a player accessing the peak of his powers, with his body and mind operating so harmoniously that it didn’t matter what Jets defenders did — even if they were in a position to stop him. Advertisement Richardson still had a counter. “The coaches can always go draw it up, but then you can step on the field, and something might not be the look you were expecting,” Alie-Cox said. “That’s when the players come to play, and then with him, you see what he’s capable of.” After Richardson’s clutch, three-touchdown performance, the question now becomes: Can he do it again against the Detroit Lions, arguably the best team in the NFL? “I wouldn’t say there’s any desire to prove anything, honestly,” Richardson said of his motivation to play well against the Lions. “It’s just really a desire to just keep stacking up my process and … putting in the work, so I can get better each and every week.”  Despite Richardson’s attempt to downplay what another strong game against Detroit could do for his confidence — and his teammates’ confidence in him — he will likely need to be at his best to help the Colts pull off an upset. The Lions are the NFL’s No. 1 scoring offense with 33.6 points per game. They’ve scored more than 40 points four times and more than 50 points twice, including last week’s 52-6 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. Detroit also boasts the No. 5-ranked scoring defense, limiting opponents to 17.7 points per game. Safety Kerby Joseph, who has a league-high seven interceptions, is someone Colts offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter says his team must locate “at all times” because of his elite ball-tracking skills. However, when Richardson was asked about his level of “concern” in the matchup, he quickly dismissed using that word to frame his team’s upcoming game. “Definitely no concerns, honestly,” Richardson said. “Every week, you’re playing a great team, but we all know this is a pretty good team that we’re getting ready to go up against. But I feel like we’re a great team, as well, so I feel like we just gotta prepare like that and just get ready to go out there and compete.” Advertisement The Colts haven’t won back-to-back games in more than a month, while the Lions haven’t lost a game in more than two months. Richardson’s teammates are confident he’ll be up for the challenge, mainly because they believe the young QB has already moved beyond his performance against New York. On Wednesday, just four days removed from the best game of his budding NFL career, Richardson appeared to be completely over it as he fielded questions at his locker. His approach wasn’t unusual for a QB, as many of them subscribe to the nonchalance method of answering questions to help mitigate the spotlight they’re constantly under. But for Richardson, it was an obvious change in demeanor. I asked #Colts HC Shane Steichen how much he thinks QB Anthony Richardson can *really* change in 2-3 weeks: “He’s definitely still growing. But we’ve seen great strides like I said last week. And it showed. … I think it’s gonna pay huge dividends in the long run.” pic.twitter.com/PwJIqA3HuC — James Boyd (@RomeovilleKid) November 20, 2024  The happy-go-lucky young man he used to be is likely still inside him, though that version of him seems to be buried deep down following his two-week benching. What’s emerged to replace it is a 22-year-old who is now trying to carry himself like a 10-year veteran. “In the meeting room (Wednesday), we were going over stuff, and he was a little bit more vocal,” Alie-Cox said. “Coach (Shane Steichen) was asking like, ‘What do you have (on this play)?’ and he was answering it immediately like, ‘You check to this,’ and things like that. You can see he’s been locked in even more than he already was. “He just wants to keep proving to everybody that they made the right decision in going back to him.” GO DEEPER Colts' Anthony Richardson played with renewed confidence; Shane Steichen deserves credit But on the other side of Richardson’s hunger to deliver for those who never lost faith in him, there also must be a part of him that wants to silence his doubters — even if he’ll never explicitly say so himself. Richardson’s teammates can still sense the edge beneath his now stoic exterior. The young signal-caller was scrutinized on national TV for weeks, some of it fair and some of it foul. The external criticism will never dwarf his own, as Richardson has routinely said he doesn’t seek validation from people outside of the Colts franchise. Advertisement But fuel can come in many forms. “He’s out there to prove everybody wrong,” wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. said. “Everything that everybody’s been saying about him, he is just out there to show them that he’s here and he’s here to stay. And he’s gonna do it his way.” Richardson’s way worked well last week, with the Colts building their offensive game plan around his legs. The 2023 No. 4 pick scored two rushing touchdowns against the Jets and has seven rushing scores through his first 11 NFL games, which is the fourth-most in league history and one more than Bills superstar Josh Allen, whom Richardson is often compared to. Alie-Cox said he can see Richardson’s tantalizing ceiling even more clearly after he torched New York, and he’s excited to see his QB tap deeper into his “MVP-caliber” potential. The veteran tight end is also fully aware Richardson still has a long way to go, but Alie-Cox firmly believes Richardson can one day elevate a franchise. Steichen said Richardson is “still growing,” and the coach has continued to remind his quarterback that he must key in on the details behind the scenes so that he can shine bright on game days. Sunday’s game against the Lions isn’t the biggest stage Richardson hopes to play on in his career, but it can serve as a barometer for where he’s at currently and where he intends to go. “They’re gonna bring it to us. We gotta bring it to them,” Richardson said of his mindset. “Just trusting my guys each and every play, like I did in that fourth quarter (against the Jets), and just trusting my ability. I feel like I’m a decent football player, and I like to make plays.” Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Watch F1 while clubbing? Las Vegas GP general admission gets an upgrade in Year 2,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936657/2024/11/21/f1-vegas-tickets-cheap-general-admission/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:00:06 GMT",Getting the Las Vegas GP experience may not cost fans an arm and a leg in 2024.,"Formula 1 LAS VEGAS — The Formula One Las Vegas Grand Prix has been criticized for pricing out the average race fan, drawing headlines for exorbitant hospitality experiences like the $12,500 Bellagio Fountain Club. However, those with a case of sticker shock may have overlooked the LVGP’s influx of 10,000 additional general admission tickets available for 2024, bringing the total GA capacity to nearly 13,000. That includes the new “GA+” experience in an area called the South Koval Zone, which was previewed Wednesday by The Athletic and appears to offer quite a good value by both F1 and Vegas standards. Advertisement Though originally listed at $1,350 for a three-day pass, an all-access ticket to the South Koval Zone was running at $749 for the weekend on StubHub.com as of this writing; a single-day ticket to Thursday’s practice sessions was listed as low as $72. Race organizers added the “plus” option this year to appeal to those who wanted an upgrade over the other GA areas without spending $1,500 on the cheapest available reserved grandstand seat. But upon entering the Heineken-branded South Koval Zone, it doesn’t exactly scream “lower-tier.” The highlight is an area between the two grandstands of unreserved bleacher seating called the “Turn 3 Club.” And when we say “club,” we mean club — as in a trackside, open-air dance club just feet from one of the circuit’s high-speed DRS zones. Adjacent to a shimmering, checkered flag dance floor, DJs will spin tunes from a booth with cars ripping down the straightaway behind them. Despite the name, the “club” is hardly exclusive. Anyone with access to the South Koval Zone can grab the first-come, first-serve seating at group-friendly high-top tables or oversized white chairs made to resemble couches (they’re not plush). Another feature of the GA+ zone is the Heineken trophy tower, which will feature the race trophy displayed atop an 80-step climb. The tower’s platform has a partial glass floor and glass walls offering a unique view: From the platform, spectators can watch the cars twist into view through Turn 4 before rocketing down the Koval Straightaway toward the Sphere. Groups of 20 people at a time will be permitted atop the tower, with each group allowed three-to-five-minute chunks before yielding to the next. (The exact length will depend on the line of people below.) Emily Prazer, Chief Commercial Officer of Formula 1 and the Las Vegas GP, told reporters this summer that much of the feedback from Year 1 focused on providing a variety of additional price points for fans. “Initially, we were like, ‘Right, it’s a big, sexy new event, we’re going to have a ton of hospitality,'” Prazer said. “We learned that lesson. We now have much more accessible tickets, GA zones and something for everybody versus something for just the high end.” To that point, the look of the South Koval Zone has changed considerably. Heineken had a presence in the South Koval Zone in 2023, but it was part of a swanky hospitality area called the “Heineken House.” Musician Anderson .Paak performed an energetic DJ set (as his alter ego, DJ Pee .Wee) and guests were served food identical to what was available in the luxurious Paddock Club overlooking the paddock area. This year, the GA+ experience in the South Koval Zone also includes food in the ticket price — but it’s of the pub fare variety, not a Michelin-star chef. (Non-alcoholic beverages are also included, but attendees have to pay if they want to drink the night away.) There are less expensive GA options as well. T-Mobile Zone at Sphere, for example, has live entertainment from the likes of Ludacris, OneRepublic and Alesso ($1,050 three-day pass); another, the Flamingo Zone ($600), has standing-room-only viewing platforms but no free food. Advertisement All of the GA sold out quickly for Saturday, though some tickets are still available for Thursday’s practices and Friday’s practice/qualifying sessions. Of course, F1 didn’t come to Vegas to market itself to Joe Race Fan. Tickets for wealthier clientele are still available for those who want to spend $5,000 apiece (and higher) on hospitality options that would make some high rollers jealous.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Cardinals' division to lose? Projection model ranks contenders in wild NFC West,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5933021/2024/11/21/nfl-playoffs-projection-cardinals-rams-49ers-seahawks/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:00:04 GMT","The odds are good only one team from the NFC West will make the playoffs. Can the Rams, 49ers or Seahawks chase down the Cardinals?","NFL It’s wild times in the NFC West. We’re 11 weeks into the NFL regular season, and every division contains at least one team with at least seven wins or seven losses — except the NFC West. The Arizona Cardinals pace the division at 6-4, while the San Francisco 49ers sit in last place (due to tiebreakers) at 5-5. The Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks are squeezed in between them at … 5-5.  As you can imagine, with all four teams so tightly packed together and plenty of division games left to be played between them, the chaotic fight to the finish will be fascinating. GO DEEPER NFL playoff projections 2024: Bills beat Chiefs; can they take AFC No. 1 seed, too? It will be especially intriguing because the rest of the NFC has been so good that, at this point, it’s highly likely only one team, the division winner, will make the playoffs. So, which team is most likely to win the division title? Will it be the team with the best roster or the one with the easiest schedule? That’s what we’re here to find out. Let’s use my NFL Projection Model to take a deeper dive into why I think each team is still alive to win the NFC West. Advertisement The Cardinals don’t project as the best team in the NFC West, according to my model, but they are the most likely to win the division. The primary reasons are pretty simple. First, they have a one-game advantage over every other team in the division. Second, they have the easiest remaining schedule of these four teams, and it’s not particularly close. The Cardinals are currently slated to face the 12th-easiest schedule remaining in the NFL. Meanwhile, the Seahawks face the ninth-hardest remaining schedule, the Rams the fifth-hardest and the 49ers the second-hardest. GO DEEPER James Conner and the punishing style and leadership that fuel the Cardinals The Cardinals still have matchups with the lowly New England Patriots (3-8) and Carolina Panthers (3-7). If they take care of business against those teams, that brings them to eight wins, and it might take only 10 to win the division. That means they’d have to win just two more games in a slate that features two matchups against the Seahawks, one at the Vikings, one at the Rams and the season finale at home against the 49ers. That seems pretty doable. However, if there is one area I’m worried about with the Cardinals, it’s the defense. They rank 23rd in EPA/play and 31st in success rate, according to TruMedia. They may luck out with the schedule, but the defense will need to improve and supplement Kyler Murray and a Cardinals offense that has played at a top-10 level this season. The story of the Rams’ season has been injuries, and they’ve endured quite a few. The offensive line was gutted early in the season, and that’s on top of star wide receivers Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua missing time. This led to a 1-4 start and sunk their playoff hopes — my projection model had their playoff odds at a season-low 6% on Sept. 22. GO DEEPER NFL Power Rankings Week 12: A new pair at the top, plus coaching hot seat check-in But with the return of Kupp and Nacua, coupled with the offensive line getting healthier over the last few weeks, the Rams have reversed course and have gone 4-1 since their Week 6 bye. It’s apparent that when you’re able to give quarterback Matthew Stafford time to throw to stars like Kupp and Nacua, this offense is lethal. And that’s without even acknowledging Kyren Williams and a healthy rushing attack. Pair that offense with a defense that is third in the league in pressure percentage while blitzing at only a league-average rate, and you have a legitimate contender. Advertisement Los Angeles Rams to win the NFC West +550: I think the Rams have the most value, as they win the division nearly a quarter of the time in my model’s simulations. The defense has some holes — especially in the secondary — but when Stafford, Kupp and Nacua are healthy, they have a shot to win every game. For the record, my model has them as the favorite in four of their final seven games, with the weekend’s home matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles a pick’em.  The 49ers still have the best roster in the division, and if they can just stay healthy (a big ask) in the second half of the season, they’ll likely find themselves in contention to win the West. Their biggest problem has been the inability to close out games. They’re 2-4 in one-score games, and in three of those losses, they blew either a double-digit lead or a fourth-quarter lead. I thought the return of star running back Christian McCaffrey might be the answer to closing out those games, but in two weeks since his return, he hasn’t looked nearly as explosive. GO DEEPER 49ers mailbag: Is Kyle Shanahan losing the locker room? Is the window closing? There’s no denying it: Things are bleak in San Francisco right now. Their playoff odds have fallen below 25% in my projections. And if they lose the next two weeks, which is very possible at Green Bay and at Buffalo, it would likely spell the end of their postseason dreams.  The Seahawks kept their division hopes alive by beating the 49ers on Sunday. Give them credit: Their front seven on defense was decimated by injury earlier this season, so to still be in the hunt is a testament to coach Mike Macdonald and the rest of this team. While their odds of winning the West are the lowest among the four teams, their schedule does provide some opportunities. They have two games against sub-.500 teams (the Jets and Bears) that are essentially must-win. They also have two games against the division-leading Cardinals, which means they can control their own destiny to a degree. Getting two wins against the Cardinals would obviously pay huge dividends. But even going 1-1 against Arizona and 2-0 against the Jets and Bears would put them right in the thick of things come Week 18. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Broncos' biggest turnaround this side of Bo Nix: A run defense with real bite,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935854/2024/11/21/broncos-run-defense-malcolm-roach/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:00:02 GMT",The Broncos have jumped from last in yards per carry allowed in 2023 to fourth this season.,"NFL ENGLEWOOD, Colo. — Bo Nix has surged into the national spotlight after his rousing performance in Sunday’s game against the Atlanta Falcons. He was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week on Wednesday — the first rookie quarterback in team history to win the award — after completing 28 of 33 passes for 307 yards and four touchdowns. It was his seventh game this season with no turnovers. The fervor around Nix’s massive game was such that head coach Sean Payton on a Monday morning conference call said, “Let’s not send this kid to Canton quite yet, please.” GO DEEPER Bo Nix’s latest career day illustrates Broncos' ceiling: ‘You’re trying to win MVP' As significant as Nix’s growth has been since the first month of the season, it’s not the only turnaround that has helped push the Broncos into the thick of the playoff race as the season reaches its homestretch. The about-face Denver has made as a run defense has had a transformative impact on how the team can win games. Advertisement It’s why Payton signed off Monday after taking bushels of questions about Nix’s performance by asking one of his own. “Nothing on the defense and holding the Falcons’ rushing (attack) down?” Payton asked. “It was a Bo Nix day, huh?” Wednesday's #DENvsLV injury report: 📰 » https://t.co/NHkoVQSfnV pic.twitter.com/CIjTXBuhO8 — Denver Broncos (@Broncos) November 20, 2024  It was a fair critique. The Broncos enter Sunday’s road game against the reeling Las Vegas Raiders ranked fourth in opponent yards per carry (3.8), tied for third in rushing touchdowns allowed (six) and third in TruMedia’s defensive rush EPA (expected points added). Denver last season ranked 32nd in yards per carry allowed (5) and 28th in rush EPA. The latest installment of the Broncos’ dominating performance as a rush defense came Sunday, when they limited Falcons running back Bijan Robinson to only 35 yards on 12 carries. It was the second-lowest output for Robinson since a 16-carry, 31-yard performance in a Week 3 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. In the six games prior to Sunday’s game in Denver, Robinson had averaged 87.3 yards per contest and 5.24 yards per carry while scoring five touchdowns. If solving the quarterback conundrum after releasing Russell Wilson this offseason was the top priority, rebuilding a struggling run defense was a close second. The Broncos had handed out big free-agent contracts the prior two offseasons to nose tackle D.J. Jones (2022) and defensive end Zach Allen (2023), but there wasn’t enough depth around them. It made it too easy for opponents to exploit weaknesses in Denver’s defensive front. It became a fatal flaw as the Broncos lost three of their final four games. Limited in free agency by the $53 million in dead money the Broncos were eating on Wilson’s contract — with $32 million more to come in 2025 — any path to success for them would require making the most of economic signings. It starts with a quarterback playing at a high level in the first year of a rookie contract, but that was only part of the puzzle. The Broncos identified former Saints defensive tackle Malcolm Roach as an impact addition at an economical price (two years, $7 million). The signing has been a hit by every measure. Roach notched his first full sack Sunday when he dragged down Kirk Cousins, but his most significant impact has been in the run game. He ranks second among all defensive tackles with a run-stop rate (percentage of tackles made for zero or negative yards) of 15.6 percent, according to Next Gen Stats. Advertisement The Broncos then added a big name at a relatively small price when they traded a sixth-round pick to the New York Jets before the draft for defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers, then reworked his deal to lower his cap hit this season to a palatable $5 million. Franklin-Myers has five sacks, just one off the career high he set with the Jets in 2021. Allen also has five sacks and will set a new career-best mark with his next takedown. The same tough decisions they create for offenses — Who do we use extra resources to block? Who do we leave one-on-one? — extend to the run game, and the Broncos have frequently left opponents with few good options. D.J. Jones fights through a double and John Franklin-Myers wins instantly to blow up the run pic.twitter.com/gMBU88Dd00 — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 19, 2024  “It starts with our D-line and them creating pressure in the backfield,” said cornerback Pat Surtain II, who is having his best season in run support on top of limiting opponents to a 44.3 passer rating when targeted, according to Pro Football Reference, by far the best mark of his career. “When runners get a ball, all they see is a wall. It’s hard for running backs and their rushing game to get going when our D-line is striking and putting the O-line in the backfield.” The Broncos have a league-high 39 sacks entering Week 12. That leaves them on pace to challenge the franchise record of 57 sacks, set in 1984. There are numerous factors for Denver’s success in harassing opposing quarterbacks. Defensive coordinator Vance Joseph’s play calling, Nik Bonitto’s breakout (already a career-high nine sacks, tied for second most in the league), the hard-to-defend interior pairing of Allen and Franklin-Myers are among them. But the rushing success defensively, particularly on early downs, has set the table for everything else. “If an offense has got a run rhythm, you’re defending a lot of different elements,” Payton said. “If an offense, at some point, becomes one-dimensional, you’re only defending one element. So I do think there’s a correlation there.” GO DEEPER Marvin Mims Jr.'s new role highlights Sean Payton's creativity with Broncos offense The Raiders, who have lost six straight games, don’t profile as a team that will pose a major threat on the ground. They are averaging a league-worst 75.2 yards per game. The biggest challenge for Denver’s defense will come from rookie tight end Brock Bowers, who had 13 catches for 126 yards and a touchdown in last week’s loss to the Miami Dolphins. He had eight catches for 97 yards in the Raiders’ Week 5 loss to the Broncos in Denver, including a 57-yard touchdown reception on the opening drive. Bowers ranks sixth among all NFL players in targets this season with 89, four more than Broncos wide receiver Courtland Sutton. Advertisement “He can move, he can be outside, he can run a route tree different than most tight ends,” Payton said. “He goes up to make the first touchdown catch against us. When it’s happening week in and week out, you see that with the player in Detroit (Sam LaPorta). Obviously, you see it with (Travis) Kelce and (George) Kittle. That’s a weapon and it becomes a little more challenging (to defend) when they’re at that position.” One question for the Broncos is whether they’ll have starting safety Brandon Jones back Sunday. He missed the game against the Falcons with an abdomen injury and was limited in practice Wednesday. Left guard Ben Powers, meanwhile, missed practice with a shoulder injury. In other injury news, the Broncos decided to let safety Delarrin Turner-Yell’s 21-day activation window expire without activating him Wednesday, meaning he’ll remain on the physically unable to perform list for the rest of the season. Payton said it was a difficult decision and Turner-Yell, who suffered an ACL tear late last season, has a “bright future,” but the Broncos, by virtue of a largely healthy roster, didn’t have the space to bring Turner-Yell back.

Now it might be South Carolina and everyone else. But for over two decades, Auriemma and the Huskies have been the standard. Last night, we saw the coronation: Auriemma is now the winningest coach in college basketball history.  Two important points of that story you may not know:  Here we are, 1,217 wins later. Auriemma has won 88 percent of his games, better than previous record holders Tara VanDerveer (82 percent) and Mike Krzyzewski (77 percent). Just look at the pace, too: Auriemma, at 70, is arguably the greatest basketball coach to ever live. He is the best program builder, at least. He won his first national championship in 1995 and his most recent in 2016, with nine others in between. In there was a 111-game winning streak. He is not slowing, either. The presumed No. 1 WNBA Draft pick — Paige Bueckers — plays for him, and the team is ranked No. 2 in the country, behind only South Carolina. UConn (4-0) also has the second-best title odds behind the Gamecocks, according to BetMGM.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Willie Green's job security, the tanking question and more: Pelicans mailbag",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936507/2024/11/21/pelicans-mailbag-willie-green/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 11:30:48 GMT",What should the Pelicans make of under-the-radar success stories like Yves Missi and Brandon Boston Jr.?,"NBA It’s been a long time coming, but the first New Orleans Pelicans mailbag of the season is finally here. It might be a struggle for the Pels to keep their players on the floor these days, but that won’t stop us from answering some of the questions you have about this team’s present and future. Let’s jump right into it. (Some questions have been edited for clarity and length.) Advertisement Do you get any sense that Willie Green’s job is in jeopardy? Beyond the injuries, this team often doesn’t play hard. And why can they never run a play on offense? — Bill C. Outside of the injuries, this seems to be the main topic of discussion for many Pelicans fans in recent weeks. It’s not surprising, considering how the season has started for a team that came into the year with legitimate hopes of winning 50-plus games. As frustrating as it may sound, it’s hard to feel like Green’s job is in danger when he’s being asked to win games with Brandon Boston Jr., Jeremiah Robinson-Earl and Javonte Green in the starting lineup. Have there been a few games that slipped away this season that Green could’ve done more to salvage? Perhaps. I wrote on Wednesday about his reluctance to take timeouts at the end of the losses to the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets that might come back to bite this team. Considering how tough the schedule has been lately, anyone expecting this group to be playing .500 ball with Brandon Ingram and a bunch of two-way guys has to be more realistic. Are there areas where Green needs to improve as an in-game coach? Absolutely. What matters more is that CJ McCollum, Jordan Hawkins and Herb Jones all have a pretty good chance of being back on the floor before the end of the month. Dejounte Murray will also be back in the mix within the next couple weeks. Once the Pelicans start looking like a real NBA team again, the spotlight on Green will be extremely bright. If he can’t get things turned around, then he’ll deserve the harsh criticism. Some of the Pelicans’ struggles in close games must be a thing of the past. Every win will make a huge difference the rest of the way. But until some of the regular rotation guys are back on the floor, it’s hard to put much blame at Green’s feet. Advertisement Shouldn’t the Pels be tanking given the injuries? — Phil T. With every loss the Pels suffer, the calls to “Sag for Flagg” or “Brace for Ace” will get louder. The appeal of having a high pick in this year’s draft is extremely high considering the talent at the top of the board, led by Duke’s Cooper Flagg and Rutgers’ Ace Bailey. The easiest path to adding a superstar will always be selecting one at the top of the draft. But as bad as their record is now, it’s hard for me to see the Pelicans remaining bad enough to have one of the three or four worst records in the league by the end of the season. Like I said above, McCollum, Hawkins, Jones and Murray are all expected to be back in the lineup relatively soon. With that much talent on the perimeter, along with Ingram and Trey Murphy III, the Pelicans will have enough to compete every night. Not to mention, there won’t be much of an appetite for taking a step back when the head coach and the lead executive, David Griffin, are already getting some heat from the fan base. Plus, Murray, Murphy, Jones and Zion Williamson are locked in with long-term contracts. Even if they finally pull the plug and ship Ingram to another team, the Pels would still have enough to win. The most important thing for this team the rest of the way will be getting Murray, Murphy, Jones and Williamson on the court together as much as possible and seeing what that core looks like on both ends of the floor. How do you find the other pieces to bring the best out of those four guys? That’s where the future of the team lies. Besides, ask the Detroit Pistons how fun it is to watch a team tank all season and not end up with a top-3 pick. Are all of the soft-tissue injuries, e.g., hamstring strains, just bad luck or are they a symptom of poor conditioning or poor performance by the training staff? — Anonymous First off, I’m not a doctor, so I’m a terrible person to ask these kinds of questions. Advertisement However, there are different kinds of soft-tissue injuries, and just because one team has two or three guys dealing with hamstring injuries at the same time doesn’t mean all of them are out of shape or that the medical staff is terrible. It’s easy to point at Williamson and say his hamstring injury is because he’s out of shape, but Murphy suffered a pretty severe hamstring strain on the second day of training camp. Is anyone saying his injury was a result of being out of shape? Sometimes, injuries do tell a bigger story about how a medical staff is working or how much a player is taking care of their body. And there are also times when injuries are just bad luck. The one area of concern that I find hard to overlook is when a player starts suffering repeated soft-tissue injuries to the same part of the body. Murphy hasn’t dealt with hamstring injuries much during his time in the league. But Williamson had issues with both of his hamstrings this season, and he was forced to miss the playoffs last season after suffering a hamstring injury in the Play-In Tournament against the Lakers. He also missed four months of the 2022-23 season because of hamstring issues. This is where it’s fair to start asking some serious questions: What’s been done to address these hamstring problems? How much added treatment is being put in place to make sure these problems won’t continue? Is there a common issue that’s been the cause behind these injuries? I don’t have a problem chalking up Murray’s broken thumb or Jones’ shoulder injury to bad luck. But Williamson’s hamstrings and the work being done to make sure they won’t become an issue again is something that both he and the team have to address. Will, where do you think Brandon Boston Jr. will be slotted once the regulars come back? He’s done a fabulous job during this time. — Jim C. There’s no doubt Boston has earned a spot in the regular rotation once everyone is back. He’s proven he can knock down 3s as a catch-and-shoot guy or off the dribble. He can make plays with the ball in the open court. And he moves with confidence. Advertisement If we’re looking at what the rotation will be once most of the guys are back, but Williamson and Alvarado are still out, I’d say the starters will be Murray, McCollum, Jones, Ingram and Yves Missi. That leaves Murphy, Hawk, Javonte Green, Robinson-Earl and Boston as the top reserves. If we had to chop the rotation down to eight guys, I’d still keep Boston in over Green. This team’s need for outside shooters is too important. I think it’ll get very interesting if Boston keeps playing well up until it’s time for Alvarado to come back. As much as I like the idea of having a backup point guard with Boston’s size and shooting, the energy Alvarado brings on defense is a crucial part of this team’s identity. His feel for playing in the passing lanes and creating turnovers is such a rare asset. I’d probably play Alvarado over Boston if push came to shove, but Boston will have some time over the next few weeks to shift my opinion — and the coaching staff’s. Does the front office want to stick with Missi all year, or trade for a starting center until Missi’s ready? — Autumn C. Missi’s play has been one of the few reasons to be excited about what’s going on with the Pelicans lately. I think he’s done enough to earn a chance to hold down the starting center spot the rest of the season. Once most of the team is healthy again, I wouldn’t be surprised if Green finishes a few games with Robinson-Earl or Jones at center so it’ll be easier for them to space the floor and switch everything on defense. Still, Missi has proven he can bring a ton of value as a lob threat, an offensive rebounder and an energy guy. Life will be a lot easier for him once he gets to play with guards who can create easy looks for him again. If Ingram ends up getting moved before the trade deadline, I wouldn’t be surprised if a veteran center is included in that deal to add some depth in the frontcourt. Regardless, Missi deserves an opportunity to show what he can do as a full-time starter with some of the regulars. The best-case scenario for this team is if they can go into the offseason and feel pretty good about Missi as the starting center going into 2025-26. With the financial crunch the Pels will be working around, having a starting big man on a rookie-scale contract will make building out the rest of the roster a lot easier. Advertisement I’d also add that giving out assets to grab another veteran center doesn’t make sense when this team still has so much work to do to get back in the playoff race. Giving up any real assets with the hopes of saving this season would be extremely short-sighted. Do you think the Pelicans regret not keeping the Lakers pick last year? — Krishazure Although Dalton Knecht would be a fantastic fit in New Orleans, considering how tight the financial crunch was for this team last summer, it would’ve been really difficult for them to add another $3.8 million in guaranteed money to this year’s books. Maybe they could’ve used that first-rounder to make another deal, but we also have to remember that most teams and experts were down on last year’s draft. The more sensible move was to bet on a potential Lakers collapse in 2025 (which looks unlikely now, but was hardly impossible to envision) or to have another pick in a 2025 draft that looks better and deeper. At the very least, Pels fans can be happy that drafting Missi at No. 21 last summer looks like a success. (Top photo: Sean Gardner / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

George’s injury came in the 76ers’ first game with stars George, Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey all healthy at the same time. But the team suffered yet another injury setback when George, the team’s marquee free-agent acquisition, exited with a hyperextended left knee early in the second half of a 117-111 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. Advertisement After the game, the team said George will not undergo an MRI, which could be a positive sign. George’s hyperextended knee is the same knee he injured in the preseason, which caused him to miss the first five games of the season. George appeared to suffer the injury early in the third quarter while jumping for a rebound. He would later be ruled out, ending his night after 17 minutes with just two points on six shots. Maxey, returning from a hamstring injury and on a minutes limit, also struggled, finishing with eight points on 13 shots. Embiid notched a season-high 35 points in his fourth game of the campaign, but it wasn’t enough. “It sucks. I know how it feels, I’ve been there,” Maxey said of George’s injury. “I just lost six or seven games to injury, so it hurts to see a teammate get hurt.” With George’s injury, plus Embiid’s absences due to left knee injury management and a three-game suspension for shoving a local columnist, the Sixers have gotten off to their slowest start in years, falling to 2-12 with Wednesday’s loss. They sit in last place in the Eastern Conference standings. (Photo: Justin Ford / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Why the Chiefs’ Patrick Mahomes-Xavier Worthy deep-ball game isn't clicking,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936235/2024/11/21/chiefs-patrick-mahomes-xavier-worthy/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 11:05:54 GMT","Since Week 4, Mahomes has thrown eight passes with the ball traveling at least 30 yards past the line of scrimmage with no completions.","NFL KANSAS CITY, Mo. — As Buffalo Bills fans roared after a third-down sack by their defense, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes trotted off the field, tossed the ball to an official and took his seat in the middle of the bench. Soon after, Mahomes felt disgusted. He grabbed a tablet and rewatched the All-22 view of the Chiefs’ first-down snap early in the second quarter of their defeat to the Bills. Advertisement “If I throw it in bounds, it’s a walk-in touchdown,” Mahomes said of his longest pass in Sunday’s game. “I just have to be better there.” Technically, Mahomes’ deep pass was in the field of play by about a yard. But rookie receiver Xavier Worthy failed to keep both feet in bounds while catching the ball, leading to perhaps the Chiefs’ most critical incompletion. Part of Worthy’s left foot was out of bounds, which led CBS broadcasters Jim Nantz and Tony Romo to groan when they watched the replay of the rookie’s mistake. Xavier Worthy unable to stay inbounds pic.twitter.com/kweNz7FeWH — NFL on CBS 🏈 (@NFLonCBS) November 17, 2024  Instead of a 40-yard completion — one that would’ve put the ball at the Bills’ 30-yard line — the Chiefs offense never gained a yard on the possession, instead going backward for a 9-yard loss with the sack of Mahomes. “Pat could have seen him earlier,” coach Andy Reid said Monday after he reviewed the play. “That’s part of it, but once you’re there, (Worthy) could have dragged his foot to keep it in. He’ll be able to chalk that one up to (a lack of) experience. That combination, those are the little things, though. “(You’re talking) about 7 points there against a good team. We’ve got to make sure (that) we take care of business on both ends.” GO DEEPER How the Chiefs' little mistakes added up to their first loss of the season However, Mahomes and Worthy’s failure to connect on deep shots is not a new problem. The last time Mahomes completed a pass to Worthy with the ball traveling at least 30 yards past the line of scrimmage was Week 4 against the Los Angeles Chargers, according to TruMedia. Since that game, Mahomes has thrown eight similar deep passes. Seven have fallen incomplete, including five intended for Worthy. The other was intercepted by Bills linebacker Terrel Bernard.  The Chiefs traded up (with the Bills) in the first round of the 2024 draft to pick Worthy believing he could revitalize their deep-passing attack. A three-year starter at Texas, Worthy ran the 40-yard dash in a record-setting 4.21 seconds at the NFL combine. Reid and general manager Brett Veach envisioned Worthy outrunning a one-on-one defender for a deep pass with the defense also having to account for tight end Travis Kelce and receivers Rashee Rice and Marquise Brown. The Chiefs practiced those plays over and over and over during training camp. Advertisement “Right now, I feel like it’s just a little bit of thinking going through my head,” Worthy said a couple of weeks ago. “I’m still trying to figure things out.” Similar to just about every aspect of the Chiefs offense this season, Worthy’s role has been altered because Brown (shoulder surgery) hasn’t played a snap and Rice (knee surgery) has been out since Week 4. In essence, all of the burden for the Chiefs’ deep passing attack has been placed on Worthy. “As a rookie, you don’t really see a lot until you actually play in the games,” Worthy said. “Every game, I feel like I’m seeing more and more (coverages) and I’m getting comfortable with what’s thrown at me.” GO DEEPER NFL QB stock report, Week 12: Patrick Mahomes drops; Caleb Williams deserves your patience The Mahomes-Worthy misconnections began in Week 7 against the San Francisco 49ers. The Chiefs’ opening play after halftime failed: Mahomes missed Worthy, who was wide open on a slick post route, for a potential 71-yard touchdown. Two plays later, Worthy stumbled and fell while running a corner route against man coverage. Mahomes threw the ball as Worthy fell and cornerback Deommodore Lenoir intercepted the pass. “For Xavier being one of the fastest guys in the league, running at that much speed and having to stop on the sideline, not a lot of people can do that,” veteran receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster said. “For him, it’s just working at it every single day. As a young guy, I’ve had those moments, where you can’t really see where the sideline is at when the ball is in the air. “I’m not worried about him at all. He’s a guy that’s going to correct it. He’s a guy that takes accountability, too. He needs to work on that. He’s always looking to get better and move forward. He’s not a guy who knows it all. He’s a sponge.” MAHOMES TO WORTHY FOR A 54-YARD TD. 📺: #KCvsLAC on CBS/Paramount+📱: https://t.co/waVpO909ge pic.twitter.com/ZAYGWXNr1V — NFL (@NFL) September 29, 2024  Earlier this month in a win against Tampa Bay, Worthy noticed the Buccaneers’ Cover 2 early in the game, adjusting his route alongside the sideline, giving Mahomes a bigger throwing window for a potential 33-yard touchdown. The mistake was that Worthy fully turned his body toward the ball and caught the pass while his right foot was out of bounds. The Chiefs failed to score on the drive. Advertisement The next week, in a win over the Denver Broncos, the offensive line gave Mahomes a clean pocket — a rarity that day — while Worthy was wide open against man coverage from cornerback Riley Moss for a potential 51-yard touchdown. Mahomes, though, missed Worthy and the field. His deep pass landed out of bounds. “As the season has gone on, he’s playing faster,” Mahomes said Wednesday of Worthy. “He has more confidence. It’s about me being on the same page as him. We can practice it all we want, but until we start doing it in the game, there’s not much more I can say about it.” Sunday’s game against the Bills was a perfect example for Mahomes. Before the deep incompletion, Worthy sprinted past safety Taylor Rapp. Mahones acknowledged he should’ve thrown his pass more toward the numbers on the field than the sideline. One issue, though, was that Mahomes couldn’t use proper footwork on the pass as he faced pressure from defensive end A.J. Epenesa (57 in the NFL Pro screenshot below).  “There’s little things here and there,” Reid said Wednesday. “It could be (Mahomes), it could be him not being able to see (Worthy from) where he is (in the pocket), or the way the defense is playing or possible pressure. It’s been a variety of things.” “It will happen. It’ll click.” Reid said that because he felt the rest of Worthy’s performance against the Bills was positive, an encouraging sign of his progress. GO DEEPER How the Chiefs felt watching a different superstar QB beat them with a superstar play Reid and Nagy designed the Chiefs’ first offensive snap for Worthy, who gained 7 yards on a nifty end-around. Worthy finished the game with 61 receiving yards on four receptions, including a 10-yard touchdown. But the Chiefs scored just 7 points after halftime as Mahomes didn’t target Worthy. “You can tell he has more confidence in himself and what he can do within the offense,” Mahomes said of Worthy. “Whenever he’s playing confident, and not thinking, he’s playing fast and it’s hard for people to account for how fast he is. I’m excited for him. I thought that was a good jumping-off point. We’ve got to keep him more involved in the offense throughout the second half.” WORTHY SPEEDS IN 🏃‍♂️ @XavierWorthy pic.twitter.com/l2TicCUNkY — Kansas City Chiefs (@Chiefs) November 17, 2024  Mahomes said he also believes his deep passes to Worthy will start to connect. The sooner the better. “Once it starts happening,” Mahomes said, “the offense is really going to take off.” Injury update: Running back Isiah Pacheco (broken fibula) and defensive end Charles Omenihu (torn ACL) were limited participants in Wednesday’s practice. Their status for Sunday’s game will be determined later in the week. (Top photo: Denny Medley / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

In a ceremony at the Rose Garden, President Joe Biden congratulated Brad Stevens, Joe Mazzulla and the rest of the Celtics for winning the title last season. Here are notes from the Celtics’ day in Washington, D.C. Advertisement Oshae Brissett, who remains a free agent after declining a player option to stay with the Celtics, joined his former team at the White House. Since he did not attend the banner ceremony on opening night, when the current Celtics received their rings, Tuesday also gave him an opportunity to pick up his ring. Derrick White enjoyed seeing his old teammate. “Obviously, we have pretty much the same team back,” said White. “It’s not like we haven’t seen each other a lot. But it was really cool to see Brissy again and have him be a part of it. Obviously, he was a big member of our team last year and so it was great to have him here and a part of it and just kind of get the whole gang back together.” Assistant general manager Mike Zarren said it was fun to see Brissett. “He hasn’t been around this year obviously but it was cool for him,” Zarren said. “We got him his ring. That was a neat moment.”  According to Zarren, a Celtics group was scheduled for a meeting at the White House about “a bunch of policy issues that our community groups have been working on.” Co-owner Steve Pagliuca, who was part of that meeting, said he and other members of the team sat with the White House’s policy advisors. Zarren said the Celtics were focused on two issues. “One is Raise the Age, where we’re trying to raise the age of which people will be treated as juveniles,” Zarren said. “And the other’s our Curbside Care program, where we’ve got a first-of-its-kind program, an ambulance that’s been altered inside to effectively be a care unit for mothers in underprivileged communities. Often times those people don’t get the care that they need. So this is a first-of-a-kind program in the country and we’ll be bringing that up in meetings today.” GO DEEPER Inside the Celtics' championship march to Banner 18: 'We made all the sacrifices' For the Celtics figures who also experienced the 2008 championship, Thursday provided a chance to reminisce. Zarren said he recreated a photo he took with Danny Ainge in the White House 16 years ago. This time, in the same spot, Zarren took the photo with Brad Stevens instead. “It was neat to see this team in the same places the team was in ‘08,” Zarren said. “It’s kind of cool, it’s a whole different group.” Advertisement Another photo from the day featured even more star power than the Stevens-Zarren combo. Celtics co-owner Wyc Grousbeck said he, his wife Emilia and Mazzulla took a selfie with President Biden. “We have a selfie with Joe Biden that he took,” Grousbeck said. “So just an amazing, warm encounter with really a great man, great person.” “This was a very moving, very exciting and moving day,” added Grousbeck. “We had not been focused on this. We got through the banner and opening night and then it was all business, led by Joe (Mazzulla). Joe really doesn’t want us to dwell too much on the past. He wants us to move forward. Having said that, everybody here including Joe really seemed to have a great time. And we really got some time to personally connect with the President. Emilia and I spoke with him directly. Joe was right there. Steve Pagliuca and others. But we really got to know him and spend time. It was just a meaningful day. We all thought his remarks about the Celtics really were amazing and we took them to heart and appreciated them. The whole thing, it was a very special day.”   (Photo: Adam Glanzman / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Fatawu returned to Leicester early from international duty after being forced off in the first half of Ghana’s Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Angola on Friday and subsequently missing Monday’s defeat to Niger. Advertisement The 20-year-old has made 13 appearances in all competitions this season, providing three assists, and has started Leicester’s last three matches in the Premier League after helping spark October’s 3-2 comeback victory over Southampton with his 30-minute appearance from the bench. “An ACL injury rules him out for the rest of the season,” Cooper confirmed on Thursday. “It is a serious injury and to happen at a young age is a blow for him and us. We now have to support him in every way to make his rehab and return as smooth as possible. Hopefully he comes back a stronger player and person.” “Initially everyone will be upset when you lose a good player but at the same time we have to respond, role our sleeves up and respond.” GO DEEPER How have Premier League clubs been affected by injuries this season? Fatawu played an important role during Leicester’s 2023-24 promotion-winning campaign, contributing seven goals and 13 assists as the club topped the Championship.

Leicester are already without defender Ricardo Pereira, who has been ruled out for four months with a hamstring injury.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Roki Sasaki’s agent calls rumors of Dodgers handshake deal ‘poor sportsmanship’,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936992/2024/11/21/roki-sasaki-dodgers-agent-rumors/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 10:00:42 GMT",Joel Wolfe of Wasserman denied the allegation on Wednesday.,"MLB NEW YORK — In the last year, as anticipation built that highly coveted Japanese pitcher Roki Sasaki could sign with a Major League Baseball team this offseason, front-office executives have continuously speculated behind closed doors that the outcome is predetermined. The officials suspect that Sasaki has some sort of unwritten agreement to join the Los Angeles Dodgers. Advertisement Executives have brought some of those rumors, at least informally, to the commissioner’s office, and Dodgers higher-ups have heard them as well, according to people briefed on the discourse who were not authorized to speak publicly. Sasaki’s agent, Joel Wolfe of Wasserman, denied the allegation on Wednesday, hours after commissioner Rob Manfred also tried to quell the topic. “While a bunch of executives who should know me better and do a lot of business with me insult my integrity by insinuating that I would be a part of some type of nefarious agreement,” Wolfe told The Athletic, “in reality, this is just poor sportsmanship.” Responding to a question about the rumors at MLB headquarters, Manfred said he expects Sasaki will not sign until after the new year. That could in theory diminish the Dodgers’ chances of signing the pitcher. Sasaki, 23, is soon to be an international amateur free agent under baseball’s rules, which means teams must bid on his services using their international bonus pool money. MLB rules forbid teams from reaching unwritten agreements with those players before they are eligible, and Sasaki’s Japanese team has yet to formally post him for bidding. The Dodgers have $2.5 million left in their bonus pool for the 2024 signing period, which ends on Dec. 15. That’s more than any other team, and the fact they saved that much has further prompted finger-pointing that they expect to land Sasaki. But Manfred said Sasaki likely will be signed only once the new international signing period opens on Jan. 15, making him part of the 2025 class. At that point, every team enters the signing period with a fresh allotment of money, making for a theoretically more even playing field. The Dodgers, who declined comment, will be among the teams with the least available money to spend in the new period at $5.1 million. At the high end, some teams will have a little more than $7.5 million. Advertisement “In my media training, they told me never to answer questions that involve suspicions, so I could pass all together,” Manfred said when asked about the money the Dodgers had preserved in their 2024 pool. “Just one clarification. It kind of looks like the way it’s going to shake out, the signing there — just because of the timing — will happen in the new pool period. So that’s kind of a significant fact. “But you know, we’re going to see what happens there. If there’s any reason to believe that there was a violation of one of our rules, you can rest assured that we will thoroughly investigate and try to get to the bottom of it.” The Chiba Lotte Marines of Nippon Professional Baseball announced earlier this month they will post Sasaki for bidding, setting the stage for a fierce competition for his services. The World Series champion Dodgers have been linked to Sasaki in part because they already have two former NPB stars, Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, on their roster. Although unwritten agreements with international amateurs are banned, they happen all the time in Latin America, where most international amateur players hail from. There are no known published reports of the Dodgers violating the sport’s rules in their pursuit of Sasaki. Speculation, however, has persisted. Dallas Keuchel, a former Cy Young Award winner who was Sasaki’s teammate on Chiba Lotte this year, told the New York Post earlier this month, “I heard some rumblings about a done deal with the Dodgers — you know, having a plan for him.” Preventing teams from gaining unfair access to foreign players isn’t a new topic for the commissioner’s office. In March, the league banned “working agreements” between MLB clubs and four formally recognized foreign leagues: the top circuits in China, Korea, Japan and Mexico. Advertisement MLB teams were also newly forbidden from working directly with any employees or associates of teams in those leagues. Before March, MLB had allowed working agreements, so long as they were submitted to the league office for approval. But the league went a step further in the spring after some teams complained about other teams’ arrangements, said one high-ranking club official who was not authorized to speak publicly. “There are certain things — exchange of information, whatever — that (were) perfectly allowable,” Manfred said Wednesday. “The concern with those agreements comes when, for example, the American club has some priority access to players that are under control because it would allow them to expand the number of players they have under control. And we’ve always been scrupulous about not allowing those.” (Top photo of Roki Sasaki: Eugene Hoshiko / Associated Press) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Ahead of Las Vegas GP, Lando Norris admits his first F1 title fight will likely end in defeat",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5937041/2024/11/21/lando-norris-f1-championship-max-verstappen-vegas/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 07:56:50 GMT","Verstappen leads the driver standings with 393 points, 62 points ahead of Norris with three races and a sprint to go.","Formula 1 LAS VEGAS — It may be the start of the final tripleheader of the season, the stint kicking off with Formula One cars zipping down the Strip, but all eyes aren’t on the glitzy and glamorous show like in the Las Vegas Grand Prix’s 2023 debut. A driver championship battle could be decided in Las Vegas come Saturday night. Advertisement Lando Norris sat in the FIA news conference Wednesday evening, fielding question after question about the title fight. And the McLaren driver seems to have come to terms with the fact Max Verstappen could wrap up a fourth consecutive world championship as soon as Saturday. “I kind of know the position I’m in now, and probably I have less to lose now,” Norris said. “You know, the gap to Max is … for the first time, probably when I’ve looked at the gap myself and had the realization of where things stand, and I think post-Brazil was a tough one for me because it was the first moment realistically when I’m like, it’s tough to achieve first position now. “We were on such a good run of form, little by little, you know, it’s hard to get any big points on Max, because he didn’t have any bad races, but I had a tough week because things just didn’t go our way, and my kind of real fight for the championship was slimmed by the biggest margin of almost of the whole year.” Verstappen leads the driver standings with 393 points, 62 points ahead of Norris with three races and a sprint to go before the checkered flag falls on the 2024 season. All the Dutchman needs to do is finish ahead of the Briton to seal the title. Norris said that his approach won’t change heading into this weekend, adding that “my approach has been correct.” “So from my side,” he said, “I need to not change anything (for Saturday’s race), but I think I can probably just go out and enjoy a little bit more.” It’s been the closest world championship battle F1 has seen since Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton went head-to-head in 2021. Since then, the Red Bull driver has won two more titles largely unchallenged. On Wednesday evening, Norris called Verstappen’s win in São Paulo two weeks ago “a defining moment” in this year’s battle. Verstappen won the race by more than 19 seconds, while the McLaren driver finished sixth after an unlucky day. Advertisement “For a week I was pretty down after Brazil because I had that realization that things are pretty much out of my control now, not within reach necessarily,” Norris said. “That’s a tough realization when your hopes and your belief is so high for it to get knocked down so much all of a sudden was pretty demoralizing and not the best of feelings. You learn to accept that. That’s life.” It’s not been a clean season for Norris by any means. Sure, he won his first F1 race in Miami and has bagged two more victories, multiple podium finishes and several pole positions since then. But mistakes have been made, whether on his side or McLaren’s. “I definitely was not at the level I needed to be at the beginning of the year and even Miami point of the season,” Norris said. “Since the summer break, I feel like I’ve done a very good job and performed very, very well, by far some of my best performances that I’ve done. So I’ve been very happy, actually, with how the last few months have gone, honestly. I wouldn’t change many things that have happened. But I still need to make tweaks. I still need to improve on things. That’s clear. You know, I’m not completely satisfied with how I’ve done. I definitely know I need to make improvements.” But the biggest lesson he’s learned through these ups and downs and battles is that he has what it takes to be a world championship contender. “For the first time, I’m confident to say that I have what I think I need to fight for a championship. Doesn’t mean I’m complete, doesn’t mean I’m perfect, that’s for sure,” the 25-year-old said. “And when you’re competing against drivers who are close to that, like Max, you have to be close to perfect if you want to challenge him, you know, and challenge the teams we’re around. “So I’m confident and I think the main thing I can take away is I have faith that I have got what it takes to fight for a championship.” Advertisement The championship is still up for grabs, and Norris is not saying it is over. There is still a chance the McLaren driver can catch Verstappen or at least push the fight to Qatar (which is a sprint race weekend). He’ll need to outscore the Dutchman by three points in Las Vegas, though, for the battle to be extended. “I won’t say it’s over until it is, but you know it’s very far out of reach at the minute, and we’ve been performing well, but I need a lot of luck if anything, if I can,” he continued when asked whether this was “check” like in a chess game, “and it’s pretty much like I’ve got to win three races and Max has to not finish three races in a way. So, yeah, it’s check. And I’m all alone.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Raiders owner Mark Davis agrees in principle to sell 15 percent of team: Source,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936783/2024/11/20/raiders-sale-egon-durban-silver-lake/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 03:56:23 GMT",The agreement comes just over a month after Mark Davis sold about 10.5 percent of the Raiders to a group that includes Tom Brady.,"NFL HENDERSON, Nev. — Las Vegas Raiders owner Mark Davis has agreed in principle to sell 15 percent of the franchise, according to a league source. Silver Lake co-CEO and Endeavor board chairman Egon Durban and Discovery Land Company founder and chairman Michael Meldman have each bid separately to acquire equal 7.5 percent stakes in the Raiders, the source said. Advertisement The NFL finance committee has reviewed the terms of the transaction. The committee could bring the sale up for a vote among NFL owners at the special league meeting from Dec. 10-11 in Irving, Texas. For Durban and Meldman’s bids to become official, at least 24 of the league’s 32 owners would need to approve them in a vote. The agreement comes just over a month after Davis sold about 10.5 percent of the Raiders to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, co-founder of Knighthead Capital Management Tom Wagner and former NFL defensive lineman Richard Seymour. Brady and Wagner purchased stakes worth about 5 percent each while Seymour purchased a 0.5 percent stake. Davis will remain the controlling owner of the Raiders even if Durban and Meldman’s bids are approved. If he wanted to, he could sell nearly all his stakes and still keep decision-making power. That’s because, as of 2022, the NFL dropped the minimum percentage of a team that a longstanding owner must control from 5 percent to 1 percent for teams with the same owner for at least 10 years. Davis has owned the team since his father Al died in 2011, so he would fall into that group. Davis and a Raiders spokesperson did not immediately respond to The Athletic’s request for comment. The reasons why Davis has been selling shares of the Raiders are multifaceted. Part of the appeal in bringing in Brady and Seymour is that they can help Davis make football decisions. Before buying into ownership, Seymour was on the Raiders’ hiring committee that led to the hiring of general manager Tom Telesco and coach Antonio Pierce this offseason. Brady hasn’t had that type of formal involvement yet — he’s been busy working as a Fox analyst — but Davis said he could help the Raiders “select a quarterback in the future and potentially train him as well.” He plans to lean on Brady’s football knowledge and called it a “huge benefit to the organization.” Advertisement As for the transactions with Wagner, Durban and Meldman, the primary motivator appears to be Davis becoming more liquid. The value of the Raiders has skyrocketed since their relocation from Oakland to Las Vegas. Earlier this year, CNBC valued the franchise at $7.8 billion. To be clear, that’s not the number that Davis will be paid based on because a valuation is based on the estimated price the Raiders would draw if Davis sold the entire stake. While the exact terms are unknown, Davis still raked in hundreds of millions of dollars by selling stakes to Brady, Seymour, Wagner, Durban and Meldman collectively. Something that could complicate Durban’s purchase is that Endeavor, the parent company of WME, has a sports agency arm that represents NFL players and other athletes called WME Sports. Durban owns an interest in WME Sports through Silver Lake, which owns part of Endeavor. NFL rules don’t allow individuals with an ownership stake to represent players and coaches, so for Durban to buy into the Raiders, Endeavor would have to divest WME Sports’ football representation business. According to the Sports Business Journal, Durban has told the NFL finance committee that would happen within four months of the Raiders deal getting done. Again, that’s all expected to be discussed at the NFL special league meeting next month. If things get hashed out, Davis and the Raiders will welcome more members to the ownership group.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Warriors' De'Anthony Melton to undergo season-ending left knee surgery,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936594/2024/11/20/deanthony-melton-injury-acl-warriors/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 02:02:36 GMT",The 26-year-old guard signed a one-year deal with the Warriors last summer. His season ends after just six games in a Golden State jersey.,"NBA The Golden State Warriors’ early-season momentum was dealt a significant blow Wednesday as the team announced guard De’Anthony Melton will need surgery for a partially torn left ACL and will miss the remainder of the 2024-25 season. The 26-year-old Melton, who recently played himself into the starting shooting guard spot next to Steph Curry, signed with the Warriors on a one-year, $12.8 million deal this summer, a contract that was considered team-friendly. He was available at that rate because he was limited to 35 games last season with the Philadelphia 76ers due to a tricky back injury. Advertisement Melton joined Golden State believing he could improve his value with a strong season and re-enter a friendlier free-agent market next summer. That plan has been dashed in the opening month. After turning heads with a strong preseason, Melton looked sharp in his six games with the Warriors. At the end of a recent 4-1 road trip, coach Steve Kerr announced him as the perimeter starter in the backcourt, believing his defensive versatility, offensive playmaking and floor-spacing shooting ability made him a perfect fit next to Curry. Melton was terrific in a home win over the Dallas Mavericks last week, but tweaked his knee during the game and was spotted limping. He still closed the contest, but it was later revealed he suffered an ACL injury. Melton searched out several opinions for the partially torn ACL before season-ending surgery was deemed the best long-term route. The Warriors plan to apply for the $6.4 million disabled player exception, team sources said, but can’t currently use it. They are less than $1 million under the first apron, where they are capped. But it’s possible it could be used later in the season in conjunction with other roster moves, though a scenario where it could prove useful is exceedingly unlikely. In Melton’s place, Kerr is starting Lindy Waters III, a low-price offseason trade target who has impressed with his shot-making. Kerr said second-year guard Brandin Podziemski could eventually elevate into that starting shooting guard spot, but he prefers to keep the bench rotation stable. Podziemski is currently mired in a slump, shooting 38 percent overall and 19 percent from 3. “He’s not shooting the ball with much confidence right now,” Kerr said. “That’s obvious. It’s part of being in the NBA. Everyone goes through stretches where you don’t quite feel it. The way he shot it at the end of last year, all summer, watching him in camp, he’s a really good shooter. He’ll find it.” The Warriors need him to find it, especially without Melton for the rest of the season. (Top photo: David Richard / Imagn) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Geno Auriemma becomes all-time winningest college basketball coach in 40th year at UConn,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936477/2024/11/20/geno-auriemma-uconn-winningest-coach-college-basketball/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 01:48:05 GMT","Geno Auriemma earned his 1,217th win Wednesday night to pass Tara VanDerveer for the record.","NCAAW STORRS, Conn. — UConn women’s basketball coach Geno Auriemma passed Tara VanDerveer as college basketball’s all-time winningest coach with the Huskies’ win over Fairleigh Dickinson on Wednesday night in Storrs. Auriemma earned his 1,217th win. The Huskies’ depth, a rarity the past few seasons due to a rash of injuries, was on full display in the 85-41 victory. UConn used 11 players, including Azzi Fudd, who missed the beginning of this season and all of last season after suffering a knee injury in November 2023. Despite the comfortable win, Auriemma spent the game pacing the sideline, throwing his arms up at missed layups and turnovers. In that way, it felt less like a historic victory and just like any other Huskies’ win. Advertisement “This is yet another outstanding milestone in a career filled with them for Geno Auriemma,” VanDerveer said in a statement. “The level of success he has maintained at UConn over four decades will never be duplicated. But his tremendous legacy extends far beyond any number of wins. “It lives in the lives of the countless young women he has positively influenced throughout his career. Congratulations to Geno and Chris on this incredible accomplishment.” Auriemma, 70, is in his 40th season as a head coach — all at UConn. He has led the Huskies to six undefeated seasons (the rest of women’s college basketball accounts for four total), 11 national titles and 23 Final Fours. Alone, he has more NCAA Tournament wins than any program in men’s or women’s college basketball. Auriemma has won the Naismith Coach of the Year award eight times, and he experienced just one losing season — his first at UConn. The Huskies have produced 26 All-Americans (including 17 multi-time honorees), 27 WNBA first-round draft picks and five No. 1 picks, with UConn senior Paige Bueckers expected to go No. 1 to Dallas in the 2025 WNBA Draft. Understanding that Auriemma would surpass VanDerveer with a win over Fairleigh Dickinson, UConn planned to celebrate the anniversary of Auriemma and longtime assistant Chris Dailey’s hiring. More than 60 program alumni — including Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi, Maya Moore and Napheesa Collier — attended the game. Auriemma and Dailey were honored at halfcourt with a tribute video and glass-blown basketball engraved with “40 seasons of excellence” before the game. The sheer number of alumni at Gampel Pavilion, and how well-known so many are because of their storied college and WNBA careers, speaks to Auriemma’s longevity and consistency. He reached the record by winning 88 percent of his games thus far. VanDerveer, who retired from Stanford after last season, won 82 percent during her career while former Duke men’s coach Mike Krzyzewski, who held the record before VanDerveer, won 77 percent of his games. Auriemma arrived in Storrs as a first-time coach in 1985. UConn’s program had experienced just one winning season in its 11-year history. Auriemma thought he would stay for a few years until a more well-established program came calling. After the Huskies’ first trip to the Final Four in 1991, Auriemma didn’t receive any calls, but by then, his thoughts on the program had changed and he believed that he and Dailey could build sustainable success in Storrs. With the commitment of All-American Rebecca Lobo in 1991, the program’s fortunes began to turn. In 1995, Lobo’s senior season, UConn won its first national title. Advertisement That national title run put the Huskies on the map and allowed Auriemma’s recruiting to improve significantly. In 1998, he signed a class that could still be argued as the best recruiting class in women’s basketball history — Sue Bird, Swin Cash, Ashja Jones and Tamika Williams. That core won the program’s second and third NCAA titles and those four players were drafted in the top six of the 2002 WNBA Draft. By the early 2000s, UConn had officially established itself as one of the nation’s blueblood programs alongside Tennessee and Stanford. Taurasi, Tina Charles and Moore carried the Huskies’ success through the rest of the 2000s, ushering in the Breanna Stewart era and the most dominant stretch in college basketball. From 2013 to 2016, the Huskies won four national titles and set a college basketball record by winning 111 consecutive games. With his success in the college ranks and with so many UConn players in the national team pool, it wasn’t a surprise when Team USA tabbed Auriemma as coach in 2009 to lead the U.S. for the 2012 and 2016 Olympic Games, becoming the only coach in women’s Olympic basketball history to lead the team twice.

Madden 25 announced Wednesday evening that its latest update will add the Philadelphia Eagles running back’s impressive play as a playable move in the game. The move, dubbed the “spin hurdle” by the Madden team, was executed by Barkley in the Eagles’ win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. The play left the league — fans and players alike — in utter disbelief. Eagles coach Nick Sirianni called it “the best play I’ve ever seen,” adding, “He’s probably the only one in the world that could do that.” Advertisement It even took Madden’s developers by surprise. Game designer Spade said he and the rest of the Madden team knew right away they wanted the move in the game. “It’s rare, this day and age, to see something that’s never been done before. That’s when we knew we wanted it in-game,” said Spade via EA Sports’ notes from the development team.     A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  Barkley himself couldn’t quite put the moment into words. “I kinda just let go, and let my body just react,” Barkley said after Week 9. “That play was cool.” This is not the first viral moment Madden has added to its games. The franchise has been quick to add player celebrations to the game, like Justin Jefferson’s “Griddy” dance or Aaron Rodgers’ “championship belt” celebration. Madden has also immortalized signature plays, like Odell Beckham Jr.’s signature one-handed catch from 2014 with the New York Giants. Now, the one-of-one, 180-degree hurdle can be played from the comfort (and safety) of your own home. (Photo: Elsa / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

MLB News,Snell has met with these teams (report),https://www.mlb.com/news/blake-snell-rumors,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 13:24:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and rumors surrounding Blake Snell. Nov. 21: Snell has started meeting with teams (report)After lingering on the market until mid-March in his first try at free agency last offseason, Snell isn’t wasting any time in his second go-round. According to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required), the left-hander has already met with the Red Sox and Dodgers. It’s possible he also met, or will meet, with the Orioles and Blue Jays, per Rosenthal's report. Other clubs could be in the mix for Snell as well. During his Wednesday chat on Bleacher Report, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman mentioned that Yankees and Giants are interested in Snell. (Heyman also tied the Dodgers to Snell.) The left-handed ace spent the 2024 season with the Giants and was one of the best starters in baseball over the second half of the season. Heyman said he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if Snell re-signed with the club. ""[Snell] loved San Francisco and he thrived in San Francisco, and if you love San Francisco, there's a good chance you end up in San Francisco,"" Heyman said. The Yankees are focused on bringing Juan Soto back to the Bronx, but if they do so, Heyman said he doesn't think the team will also spend the money necessary to get a pitcher like Snell. Nov. 16: Snell reportedly in talks with Red SoxESPN's Jeff Passan said during Friday's edition of the Baseball Bar-B-Cast podcast that the Red Sox are talking to Snell as well as fellow left-handed ace Max Fried. Last week, MLB.com's Mark Feinsand identified the Red Sox as one of the top suitors for Snell, who is a free agent for the second straight offseason and whose stock on the open market should be higher this year than after he won his second Cy Young Award in 2023. Signing Snell would give Boston two things its rotation didn't have last season: a left-hander and a bona fide No. 1 starter. Nov. 6: How many teams are in on Snell?Following his fantastic second half of the 2024 season, Blake Snell is expected to draw interest from many big-market clubs. MLB.com's Mark Feinsand has listed the Giants, Yankees, Mets, Red Sox, Dodgers, Orioles and Blue Jays among the left-hander's potential suitors. An industry source also told Katie Woo and Will Sammon of The Athletic (subscription required) that the Rangers could be in the mix as well. However, that source added that the extent of interest from Toronto and Texas depends on Snell's price tag. Snell opted out of his two-year, $62 million deal with the Giants last week. Although Snell carried a 9.51 ERA through his first six starts with San Francisco and went on the injured list twice within the season's first three months, he was one of the most dominant starters in the Majors over the final three months. That period included 114 strikeouts over 80 1/3 innings and a .382 opponents' OPS. Of course, Snell is just one year removed from winning the NL Cy Young Award with the Padres, the second of his career. Feinsand wrote that Snell's next contract should exceed $27 million in annual average value -- the AAV of Carlos Rodón's six-year deal with the Yankees that he signed prior to the 2023 season. However, Snell's deal might come with fewer guaranteed years since he is entering his age-32 campaign. Rodón was 30 when he joined the Yanks.",2024-11-21

Nov. 21: Cubs want to trade Bellinger (report)Although outfielder/first baseman Cody Bellinger exercised his player option for 2025, it’s not a guarantee that he’ll be with the Cubs on Opening Day. According to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required), rival executives say that the Cubs want to trade the 29-year-old. Bellinger’s contract -- he’s owed $27.5 million in 2025 and can earn $25 million in 2026 by picking up his player option -- could limit the return for the Cubs. But if they are truly motivated to move him, they should be able to find a suitor. Bellinger’s production regressed in 2024, but he still had a solid 111 OPS+. He has also proven capable of handling center field, a weak position in this year’s free-agent market. Rosenthal mentions the Yankees as a possible fit for Bellinger if they aren’t able to re-sign Juan Soto, noting that the Bronx Bombers have shown interest in Bellinger in the past. Bellinger could potentially be a backup option for some of the other teams involved in the Soto sweepstakes as well. Trading Bellinger would add more payroll flexibility for the Cubs to address their top priority this offseason, which is pitching. But while Chicago’s interest in adding a starter is clear, there have been conflicting reports about which arms the team might target. On Wednesday, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman mentioned the Cubs among the teams in the mix to sign one of the three aces currently available via free agency: Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell and Max Fried. However, The Athletic's (subscription required) Sahadev Sharma reports that the Cubs have “ruled out” that tier of free-agent hurlers and could also stay away from other pitchers who declined a qualifying offer, including Sean Manaea, Luis Severino and Nick Pivetta. Sharma mentions Yusei Kikuchi, Nathan Eovaldi and Jack Flaherty as possible options. Nov. 20: Cubs acquire Morgan and Thaiss, DFA WisdomThe Cubs acquired reliever Eli Morgan from the Guardians in exchange for outfield prospect Alfonsin Rosario (No. 21 on Pipeline’s Top 30 list for the Cubs) on Wednesday. The Cubs also shored up their catching depth on Wednesday, acquiring Matt Thaiss from the Angels.

MLB News,Teams to win 2 of 3 major BBWAA player awards,https://www.mlb.com/news/same-team-won-mvp-cy-young-and-rookie-of-year-award,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 23:26:00 GMT","No club has swept MVP, Cy Young and Rookie of the Year honors","Paul Casella No MLB team has swept the three major Baseball Writers' Association of America player awards -- Most Valuable Player, Cy Young and Rookie of the Year -- in a single season. While that continued in 2024, we saw one team, the Yankees, take home two of the three honors: Luis Gil received the AL Rookie of the Year Award, and Aaron Judge was named AL MVP for the second time in his career. Overall, 56 teams have claimed two of those three awards in a single season. Prior to 2024, it last occurred in 2019 when the Astros and Mets won their respective league's Cy Young Award (Justin Verlander, Jacob deGrom) and Rookie of the Year Award (Yordan Alvarez, Pete Alonso). Houston's Alex Bregman finished as the runner-up to Mike Trout for AL MVP, leaving the Astros on the doorstep of an awards sweep. Those 56 instances include 19 times when the same club produced specifically the MVP and Cy Young winner (not including years in which a pitcher won both awards on his own). It's happened only four times since the league expanded to 30 teams in 1998, with the most recent occurrence coming in 2013. That was when Tigers teammates Miguel Cabrera (AL MVP) and Max Scherzer (AL Cy Young) earned the honors. Below is a breakdown of each of those four instances, followed by a closer look at teams that came close to making history by sweeping the three awards. 2013 Tigers: Miguel Cabrera (AL MVP), Max Scherzer (AL Cy Young)One year after earning the 2012 AL batting Triple Crown and edging out Trout in the AL MVP race, Cabrera again held off the Angels superstar in '13 AL MVP voting. Cabrera took home his second straight AL MVP honor after hitting .348/.442/.636 with 44 homers and 137 RBIs. That was good enough to earn 23 first-place votes, while Trout claimed only five as the runner-up. The AL Cy Young race was even more of a runaway, with Scherzer claiming 28 of the 30 first-place votes after going 21-3 with a 2.90 ERA and 240 strikeouts. Tigers teammate Aníbal Sánchez earned one of the remaining two first-place votes, while the other went to Chris Sale. In fact, the Tigers nearly completed the awards trifecta after a midseason three-team blockbuster brought José Iglesias to Detroit. The infielder, who began the year with the Red Sox, finished as the AL Rookie of the Year runner-up behind Tampa Bay's Wil Myers. 2006 Twins: Justin Morneau (AL MVP), Johan Santana (AL Cy Young)While Morneau narrowly edged out Derek Jeter in a tightly contested battle for the 2006 AL MVP Award, Santana was a unanimous winner for the AL Cy Young Award. Santana took home all 28 first-place votes after going 19-6 with a 2.77 ERA and 245 strikeouts for the Twins. Morneau, meanwhile, racked up 34 homers and 130 RBIs en route to receiving 15 first-place votes for the AL MVP Award. That was enough to keep Derek Jeter (12 first-place votes) from earning his first MVP honor, despite the Yankees shortstop hitting .343 with 14 homers, 97 RBIs and 34 stolen bases. Minnesota teammate Francisco Liriano finished a distant third in AL Rookie of the Year voting, with future ace Justin Verlander claiming 26 of the 28 first-place votes in his impressive rookie campaign. 2005 Cardinals: Albert Pujols (NL MVP), Chris Carpenter (NL Cy Young)Pujols held off Braves outfielder Andruw Jones to win the first of his three NL MVP Awards in 2005. The then-Cardinals first baseman hit .330 with 41 homers, 117 RBIs, 16 stolen bases and a 1.039 OPS to receive 18 first-place votes. Jones was a close second, garnering 13 first-place votes after finishing with 51 homers and 128 RBIs, albeit a .263 average and .922 OPS. Carpenter, meanwhile, earned 19 first-place votes after going 21-5 with a 2.83 ERA and NL-leading 213 strikeouts to beat out Dontrelle Willis (11 first-place votes) and Roger Clemens (two first-place votes) for the NL Cy Young Award. The Cards did not have anyone earn an NL Rookie of the Year vote, though skipper Tony La Russa finished second in NL Manager of the Year voting behind Bobby Cox. 2002 Athletics: Miguel Tejada (AL MVP), Barry Zito (AL Cy Young)Both of these voting results could have turned out very different if conducted today. Tejada beat out Alex Rodriguez in a bit of a controversial race, as Tejada had an .861 OPS, 34 homers, 131 RBIs and a 5.7 WAR, while A-Rod put up a 1.015 WAR, 57 home runs, 142 RBIs and an 8.8 WAR. Zito also won a close battle, holding off Pedro Martinez thanks, in part, to wins and innings pitched. Though Zito had more wins (23 to Martinez's 20) and pitched 30 more innings, it was Martinez who had a sizable edge in ERA (2.26 to 2.75), strikeouts (239 to 182) and WHIP (0.92 to 1.13). Regardless, it was Zito who claimed the AL Cy Young Award after receiving 17 first-place votes to Martinez's 11.

It's happened only 37 times when removing years in which the same player accounted for both, such as Kershaw winning the NL MVP and Cy Young Awards for the ‘14 Dodgers, or Ichiro Suzuki taking home AL MVP and Rookie of the Year honors for the '01 Mariners. Of those 55 instances, that same team was responsible for the runner-up for the third award just nine times. That number drops to seven when removing cases that include the same player vying for multiple awards. In other words, only seven times in MLB history has the same team had three different players account for winning two of the awards and finishing second for the other. Below is a list of those nine times the same team won two of three awards and produced the runner-up for the third. ^Indicates player was a runner-up Obviously, not every runner-up finish is created equal. Jason Bere finished second in the 1993 AL Rookie of the Year race, but the White Sox right-hander did not receive a single first-place vote in his quest to join teammates Frank Thomas (AL MVP) and Jack McDowell (AL Cy Young) in the winner's circle. Angels outfielder Tim Salmon was voted the unanimous AL Rookie of the Year that season. Likewise, Cardinals left-hander John Tudor received zero first-place votes in his runner-up finish for the 1985 NL Cy Young Award (Dwight Gooden was the unanimous winner). Orioles right-hander Jim Palmer was also second to unanimous '73 AL MVP winner Reggie Jackson, though Palmer at least took home the AL Cy Young Award that season, while teammate Al Bumbry was named the AL Rookie of the Year. While those three runners-up did not receive any first-place votes, Dennis Eckersley and Reggie Smith each received exactly one first-place vote, respectively, in the 1988 AL Cy Young and '67 AL Rookie of the Year races. Eckersley lost out to Frank Viola, who received the other 27 votes, while Smith yielded way to Rod Carew. That leaves three truly close calls -- the 2019 Astros, 1974 Rangers and '65 Dodgers. While Verlander and Alvarez claimed the AL Cy Young and Rookie of the Year Awards, respectively, Bregman finished as the runner-up in AL MVP voting to Mike Trout. The Astros third baseman received 13 first-place votes, but Trout claimed the remaining 17 first-place votes en route to winning his third AL MVP Award. Trout edged out Bregman in total voting points by a margin of 355-335. As for the 1974 Rangers, outfielder Jeff Burroughs held off a trio of Athletics -- Joe Rudi, Sal Bando and Reggie Jackson -- for the 1974 AL MVP Award. Teammate Mike Hargrove won the AL Rookie of the Year Award in decisive fashion, beating out Bucky Dent and George Brett. That left only the AL Cy Young Award. Texas right-hander Fergie Jenkins went 25-12 with a 2.82 ERA, 225 strikeouts and 29 complete games in 1974 -- but it wasn't enough. Jenkins' 10 first-place votes were two fewer than Oakland righty -- and fellow future Hall of Famer -- Catfish Hunter, who received 12 votes after posting an identical 25-12 record to go along with a 2.49 ERA, 143 strikeouts and 23 complete games. Moving on to the 1965 Dodgers, Sandy Koufax was the unanimous Cy Young Award winner at a time when the award was given to only one player across the Majors, instead of one from each league. That same year, Dodgers infielder Jim Lefebvre easily claimed Rookie of the Year honors over future Hall of Famer Joe Morgan. As for the NL MVP race, the Dodgers actually had two of the top three finishers -- and three of the top five. Koufax received six first-place votes to go along with his Cy Young Award, and teammate Maury Wills received five first-place votes. Neither had enough to edge Giants outfielder Willie Mays, who received the other nine first-place votes after racking up 52 homers and 112 RBIs. Though those are the three closest calls since the Cy Young Award was first handed out in 1956, it's worth mentioning the 1952 Philadelphia Athletics. Left-hander Bobby Shantz won the AL MVP Award, while teammate and fellow pitcher Harry Byrd won AL Rookie of the Year honors. The Cy Young Award did not exist yet, but it stands to reason that Shantz would have won the award for the league's best pitcher, considering he won the AL MVP Award in convincing fashion -- and the MVP on the NL side was outfielder Hank Sauer.",2024-11-21
MLB News,"With 'extreme urgency,' Red Sox pursuing star FAs",https://www.mlb.com/news/red-sox-rumors-latest-trades-and-signings,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 21:45:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of all the latest free-agent and trade rumors involving the Red Sox right here. Nov. 21: Red Sox meet with Snell; Boston also talking to Burnes, Fried (report)The Red Sox have made their pitch -- or at least an initial one -- to Juan Soto. They are apparently trying to convince one of the top starting pitchers on the market to come to Fenway, too. According to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required), the Red Sox have met with free-agent southpaw Blake Snell. Per Rosenthal, they are ""covering their bases"" by talking to Corbin Burnes and Max Fried as well. Boston was previously linked to both Snell and Fried by ESPN's Jeff Passan. Red Sox president and CEO Sam Kennedy confirmed to The Boston Globe on Wednesday that the Red Sox did meet with Soto and said there is ""extreme urgency internally"" for the team to do whatever it takes to compete for an AL East title in 2025. That includes the possibility of taking the team's payroll beyond the Competitive Balance Tax threshold of $241 million. ""We are investing more than we did last year,"" Kennedy said. ""... Look, we have to add, and that’s what we’re trying to do, but I think we’re in a good position to add right now."" As for what Boston will add, Kennedy said ""everything is on the table,"" but singled out pitching as a ""high priority."" Boston's starting staff tied for seventh best in ERA this past season (3.81) and has three solid arms in the prime of their careers coming back next season: Brayan Bello, Tanner Houck and Kutter Crawford. The club also expects to get Lucas Giolito back next year after he missed all of 2024 while recovering from right elbow surgery. However, Boston has a vacancy to address on its starting staff after free agent Nick Pivetta turned down the team's qualifying offer. Adding one of the elite arms on the market would not only fill that hole but also give the Red Sox the bona fide ace they've lacked since Chris Sale was in his prime. Nov 15: Soto has 'productive' 3-hour meeting with Red Sox (report)The Red Sox met with Soto and his representatives, including agent Scott Boras, in Southern California on Thursday night, according to a report from Sean McAdam of MassLive. The meeting, which was of an introductory and informative nature, lasted for three hours and was deemed as “productive,” though neither money nor terms were discussed between the parties. Soto was reportedly “impressed” by Boston’s presentation, which included a video noting the franchise’s history of star players from the Dominican Republic, Soto’s native country. The Red Sox also detailed their plans for the future, highlighting a promising group of prospects who could potentially team up with Soto to help the club be successful in the years to come. Soto is expected to continue to meet with more teams in Southern California over the next few days. Nov. 12: Red Sox have Soto atop their 'want list'The Red Sox are expected to meet with Juan Soto this week, per a report from ESPN's Jeff Passan (subscription required). He adds that Boston has Soto ""at the top of its want list."" The Red Sox join the Mets, Yankees and Blue Jays as teams that have meetings scheduled with Soto -- Toronto's meeting will be first, according to Passan -- while teams such as the Dodgers and Rays have shown interest. Passan expects Soto to sign with a team before the end of the year, and maybe even by the MLB Winter Meetings, which begin on Dec. 9. He writes that the Mets and Yankees are still the favorites to land the 26-year-old superstar. Boston has other free agents in its sights besides Soto. Passan reports that the club is in on left-handed starter Max Fried and right-handed slugger Teoscar Hernández. The Red Sox would also like to bring back outfielder Tyler O'Neill and are interested in trading for White Sox ace Garrett Crochet. Nov. 7: Are Red Sox the favorites to acquire Crochet?The Red Sox have six position players on MLB Pipeline's Top 100 Prospects list, including three in the top 10. They also have a few attractive pieces already at the big league level who are not yet eligible for arbitration. That group includes first baseman Triston Casas, catcher Connor Wong and Gold Glove outfielder Wilyer Abreu. With so much high-quality position-player depth, ""there’s a widespread sense that the Sox can trade for nearly anyone,"" according to The Boston Globe's Alex Speier (subscription required). Many starters could be options for the pitching-needy Red Sox, but one who stands out is White Sox left-hander Garrett Crochet. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi said Thursday from the General Managers Meetings that the Red Sox are ""the team I think a lot of people around here are looking at very carefully"" regarding a Crochet trade. White Sox general manager Chris Getz said Tuesday that there is more interest surrounding Crochet now than at this season's Trade Deadline and that Chicago is focused on adding position players in trades. As such, the Red Sox and White Sox seem like a good match to make a deal. Crochet, 25, is under club control for two more seasons.

Instead, it could get what it needs via free agency. According to The Boston Globe's Pete Abraham, the Red Sox have told multiple agents at the GM Meetings that they ""plan to be active in the free-agent market."" Corbin Burnes, Jack Flaherty, Blake Snell and Max Fried are some of the top starting pitchers on the open market. But no matter how they do it, the Red Sox need to add a front-line starter this offseason. Nov. 5: Red Sox extend qualifying offer to Pivetta, who has 'surprisingly strong' marketThe Red Sox gave the qualifying offer to starting pitcher Nick Pivetta on Monday. The right-hander has until 4 p.m. ET on Nov. 19 to either accept or decline the one-year offer, which would pay him $21.05 million for the 2025 season. If Pivetta accepts, he returns to Boston on a one-year deal. If he declines, he can negotiate a free-agent deal with all teams, including the Red Sox. By extending Pivetta a qualifying offer, the Red Sox ensured they will get a comp pick in the 2025 MLB Draft if he signs with another team. Pivetta, 31, was one of 13 MLB players to receive a qualifying offer on Monday. From 2012 (when the system was implemented) through 2023, only 13 of the 131 players who received a QO accepted it. It's an ""interesting decision"" for Pivetta, according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Accepting the QO would represent quite a raise for the right-hander, who made $7.5 million this season. But there appear to be multiple teams interested the 31-year-old. Per MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi, Pivetta has a ""surprisingly strong"" market. Although he turned in a 4.14 ERA this season, Pivetta's expected ERA was significantly better (3.59). Pivetta has also increased his strikeout numbers over the past two seasons and ranked among MLB's top 10 starting pitchers this year (minimum 140 innings pitched) in K-BB rate. His 22.9% mark sat sixth between Jack Flaherty and Logan Gilbert.",2024-11-21
MLB News,3 reasons Sasaki should thrive in the Majors,https://www.mlb.com/news/roki-sasaki-statcast-preview-for-mlb,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 04:07:55 GMT",,"David Adler The Monster of the Reiwa is coming to Major League Baseball. So let's take a look at Roki Sasaki's monstrous stuff. The 23-year-old fireballer has dominated in Japan, and he has the electric arsenal to do the same in MLB. We know he does. We saw it on the international stage at the 2023 World Baseball Classic -- where there was Statcast tracking for both of Sasaki's starts, against the Czech Republic and Mexico. That means we have data on Sasaki already. And the early numbers show you why he's going to be one of the most coveted Japanese superstars ever to jump to the Major Leagues. Here's a preview of the type of stuff we're hoping to see from Sasaki in MLB, based on what we saw from him at the World Baseball Classic. 1) He should have one of the highest-octane fastballs in the Majors Sasaki's four-seamer in the WBC averaged 100.3 mph. He topped out at 101.9 mph, hitting that mark three times. Forty-seven of his 65 tracked fastballs -- 72%, nearly three-quarters -- reached triple digits. A dozen of those were at least 101 mph. Let's take a look at the Major Leagues in 2024. The only starting pitcher to hit 100 mph that many times in the full season was Paul Skenes … the phenom whose status Sasaki will rival as one of the most-hyped MLB pitching prospects ever. Skenes threw exactly 100 pitches 100 mph or faster in his rookie season. Sasaki's best heater of the tournament was a 101.8 mph fastball to blow away Randy Arozarena. Sasaki threw it right down Broadway; Arozarena still couldn't catch up. Roki Sasaki, 102mph ⛽️ pic.twitter.com/UZAy7HjI4w Sasaki also got whiffs on four-seamers clocked at 101.3 mph (a strikeout of the Czech Republic's William Escala), 101.3 mph again, 100.7 mph, 100.2 mph and 100.1 mph. He generated a 35% whiff rate overall. He also showed good ride on his four-seamer in the WBC, averaging 17 inches of induced vertical break -- which would make it an above-average ""rising"" fastball that would likely get swings-and-misses -- as well as 12 inches of arm-side run. Because Sasaki's start against Mexico in the WBC semifinals was at the Marlins' loanDepot park, it was tracked by Hawk-Eye high-speed cameras. So we can see just how a Sasaki fastball explodes toward the hitter via 3D tracking. If Sasaki brings anything close to his WBC fastball to the big leagues, it'll be a big-time heater, similar to the ones some of MLB's top power pitchers throw. The questions are what that velo and rise will look like over a full Major League season instead of a short tournament where pitchers let it rip with everything they have -- especially after Sasaki's velo dipped in the 2024 NPB season. He averaged close to 99 mph over the 2023 season after returning from the World Baseball Classic, but this year, Sasaki's four-seamer averaged just under 97 mph, according to available NPB data. That may have been due to him dealing with injuries during the season -- an oblique injury as well as arm issues that have been reported as arm soreness or shoulder fatigue. If Sasaki arrives in the Majors at full health, and his fastball velo is back up to where we've seen it, look out. Shohei Ohtani 102 mph vs. Roki Sasaki 102 mph pic.twitter.com/9agDHl0MdM 2) His splitter might be the best in the world Triple-digit fastballs turn heads, but the gem of Sasaki's arsenal is his splitter. It might be the best splitter in the world already, and it could be the best splitter in the Majors in 2025. Sasaki's splitter in the WBC averaged 90.9 mph. He threw it as hard as 93 mph -- and that one got a swing-and-miss from Alex Verdugo. Only three Major League starters averaged a 90-plus mph splitter in 2024: the Angels' José Soriano (92.6 mph), the Rays' Taj Bradley and the Dodgers' Yoshinobu Yamamoto (90.2 mph), in whose footsteps Sasaki will be following. You can count Skenes' 94 mph splinker, too, if you want -- it gets classified as a sinker but it's a hybrid pitch with splitter movement. At that high velocity, Sasaki's splitter movement is just filthy. It drops a ton, averaging 33 inches of downward vertical movement in the WBC. As for the horizontal break? That's kind of unique. Sometimes Sasaki's splitter fades … sometimes it cuts. It can break in either direction, and that makes it even more unfair. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Rōki Sasaki, 99mph Fastball and 91mph Splitter, Overlay. pic.twitter.com/kxw6dTI9TT The World Baseball Classic hitters' swings against the Sasaki split-finger showed just how unfair. He induced a 60% whiff rate with his splitter in the tournament, getting 18 whiffs on 30 swings. He got eight strikeouts on the pitch -- all swinging. That absurd swing-and-miss rate has stayed true in NPB, even with Sasaki's splitter velocity dropping a little bit, like his fastball, from right around 90 mph in 2023 after the WBC to just above 88 mph in 2024. His splitter whiff rate was 52% in 2023 … and 57% in 2024. Those whiffs should translate straight to MLB -- after all, he was making plenty of MLB hitters look silly in the WBC. Here's what some of those splitters look like with 3D tracking. Like Skenes with his ""splinker,"" Sasaki has a wipeout offspeed pitch that steals the show from his 100 mph heaters. Of all the great Japanese aces who've brought elite splitters to MLB -- Shohei Ohtani, Yamamoto, Shota Imanaga, Kodai Senga -- Sasaki's just might be the best one. Rōki Sasaki, 92mph Splitter and 102mph Fastball, Individual Pitches + Overlay pic.twitter.com/pSu8cvaW9n 3) His slider has nasty potential Sasaki barely even needed his slider in the World Baseball Classic, thanks to his ridiculous fastball-splitter combo. But he does throw a slider, and it does have the makings of a plus No. 3 pitch that he can use in the big leagues -- especially if he can throw the hard, bullet slider that a lot of MLB aces do. Roki Sasaki's arsenal in slow motion 🤩Fastballs: 100 mph, 101 mphSplitters: 92 mph, 91 mphSliders: 89 mph, 90 mphPitches from his 11-strikeout gem to outduel Yoshinobu Yamamoto pic.twitter.com/3WqftblbwY Sasaki's slider in the WBC looked close to that kind of hard slider/cutter hybrid style of pitch, as he averaged 88 mph with about six inches of horizontal break, getting pretty tight movement. He got some nice swings-and-misses on it, too, including one against Arozarena at 88.2 mph and a nasty strikeout of the Czech Republic's Martin Muzik at 89.1 mph. Here's what a Sasaki slider looks like in 3D. Sasaki will need to get that ""hard slider"" velocity back when he comes to MLB. His velo on that pitch dropped a lot in NPB this year, from close to 88 mph in 2023 following the WBC all the way down to under 84 mph in 2024. As pitching analyst Lance Brozdowski notes in his great breakdown of Sasaki's repertoire, he doesn't seem to have enough spin on his slider to be able to turn it into the slower, more horizontal ""sweeper"" variety as a Major Leaguer. But if Sasaki is throwing his World Baseball Classic slider in the big leagues, that's a different story. If he has the fastball, splitter and slider all working, like he showcased in 2023, then MLB will have its next great young ace.",2024-11-21
MLB News,Which team will be the best fit for Fried?,https://www.mlb.com/news/analyzing-the-market-for-max-fried,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 02:03:33 GMT",,"Mark Feinsand With the 2024 season behind us and the Hot Stove ready to burn, we're taking a closer look at some of the most prominent players eligible for free agency. Name: Max FriedPosition: Left-handed pitcher2024 Team: Atlanta BravesAge (as of Opening Day 2025): 312024 stats: 11-10, 3.25 ERA, 174 1/3 IP, 1.164 WHIP, 166 K, 128 ERA+ This year’s free-agent market is rich in starting pitching, and while former American League Cy Young Award winner Corbin Burnes is considered the top prize among the available arms, is it possible that Max Fried may be the most sought-after arm? Many industry insiders expect Burnes to land a deal worth more than $200 million, a number Fried is not projected to approach. Given Fried’s excellent track record and extensive postseason experience, the left-hander should have no shortage of clubs looking to add him to their rotation for 2025 and beyond. • The top 10 free-agent starters, ranked You can make a case that Fried’s career has been more consistent than Burnes' to this point: Fried: 73-36, 3.07 ERA, 168 appearances (151 starts), 884 1/3 IP, 863 K, 1.164 WHIP, 140 ERA+ Burnes: 60-36, 3.19 ERA, 199 appearances (138 starts), 903 2/3 IP, 1,051 K, 1.063 WHIP, 129 ERA+ How will Fried’s contract compare with the one Burnes receives? Will the Braves try to bring the lefty back, or will he wind up in a new uniform? Let’s take a look at how Fried's offseason might play out. BLUE JAYSToronto is eager to rebound from a tough 2024 season, and with one year left until both Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette become free agents, the Blue Jays need to make some additions this winter to get back into the postseason picture. They’ll take a run at Juan Soto, but adding a top starting pitcher to go along with Kevin Gausman, Chris Bassitt and José Berríos could be the best path to contention. BRAVESAtlanta hasn’t been afraid to hand out extensions to its stars in recent years, locking up Ronald Acuña Jr., Austin Riley, Matt Olson, Ozzie Albies, Spencer Strider, Sean Murphy and Michael Harris II with long-term deals. The Braves allowed Fried to reach free agency, and after he declined the qualifying offer, Atlanta will recoup Draft picks if he signs elsewhere. A return to the Braves isn’t out of the question, but it doesn’t seem likely. DODGERSGiven the Dodgers’ injury issues within the rotation last season, adding a dependable starter would seem to be on their to-do list this winter. Fried has thrown at least 165 innings in four of the past five 162-game seasons, and as a Southern California native who grew up going to games at Dodger Stadium, he won’t have to be sold on the perks of living in Los Angeles. GIANTSBlake Snell’s decision to opt out of the final year of his contract has the Giants looking for another ace to pair with Logan Webb, and Fried and Burnes are among the top candidates. Oracle Park’s pitcher-friendly dimensions have made it difficult for the Giants to recruit top hitters, but free-agent starters will have a far different view of the ballpark. METSEven as they try to win the Juan Soto sweepstakes, the Mets have a lot of work to do with their rotation, with Sean Manaea, Luis Severino and Jose Quintana all free agents. The Mets are very familiar with Fried, who is 9-5 with a 2.48 ERA in 23 career outings against New York, including a 4-3 record and 2.57 ERA in 14 outings at Citi Field. ORIOLESBaltimore faces the loss of ace Burnes, potentially leaving a huge hole atop the rotation. Fried doesn’t have a Cy Young Award like Burnes, but he’s been an All-Star in two of the past three seasons and would be a more-than-suitable replacement as the Orioles’ No. 1 starter. RANGERSNathan Eovaldi’s decision to test free agency could leave the Rangers with a sizeable hole atop their rotation, with Max Scherzer and Andrew Heaney also free agents. Jack Leiter and Kumar Rocker could move into the rotation, but adding a top starter should be a priority, especially if Eovaldi signs elsewhere. RED SOXThe Red Sox appear to be all in on starting pitching this offseason, with hurlers including Fried, Burnes and Snell all drawing interest. Fried is a high school teammate of Boston righty Lucas Giolito, who could help recruit the longtime Braves starter to join him in Boston. YANKEESThe Yankees’ current focus is re-signing Soto, but should they lose the superstar slugger, they seem likely to pivot to another top free agent. Gerrit Cole’s return erased the need for an ace, but adding Fried or another top starter to a group that already includes AL Rookie of the Year Luis Gil, Carlos Rodón, Nestor Cortes, Clarke Schmidt and Marcus Stroman would give the Yankees incredible pitching depth. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. “Coming off a strong season, Fried is sure to get a sizeable pay bump. One of the considerations of giving Fried the long-term contract at the average annual value he is looking for is that he has only thrown 170 innings twice in his career, though both came in the past three years. Other than a Tommy John surgery early in his career, Fried’s injury history hasn’t stopped him from being a mainstay in the Braves' rotation, so his consistency should land him a strong nine-figure contract.” Fried’s 8% walk rate in 2024 was his highest since 2020, marking the second straight season that number has gone in the wrong direction. His 24.1% whiff rate was also down, coming in at his lowest mark since his rookie year in 2017. One other number to watch: Fried’s 34.6 hard-hit percentage was his highest since 2019, though he remained in the top 20% of the league in that category. Carlos Rodón was entering his age-30 season when he reached free agency, while Fried will be 31 in January, but Fried’s track record is far lengthier than Rodón’s was when he landed his six-year, $162 million deal with the Yankees. Aaron Nola was heading into his age-31 campaign when he signed his seven-year, $172 million deal with the Phillies last year, though Fried might not a find a deal of that length. A five- or six-year deal with an average annual value between $25 million and $28 million should be within Fried’s reach.",2024-11-21
MLB News,Which teams are vying for the top FA starting pitchers?,https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-rumors-trades-and-signings,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 14:40:00 GMT",LATEST FREE AGENT & TRADE RUMORS,"MLB.com We're keeping track of all the latest free agent and trade rumors. The demand is high, but the supply is low. That's the story for teams looking to sign a frontline starting pitcher in free agency this offseason. The best arms available are Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell and Max Fried. You could add Japanese right-hander Roki Sasaki to that group, but he hasn't yet been posted for MLB teams, so he's not officially a free agent at the moment. As for those other three pitchers, at least seven teams have been connected to them in recent reports. Dodgers: The reigning World Series champions are one of the teams that have met with Snell already but are also talking to Burnes and Fried, according to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required). They ""like Snell a lot,"" per MLB Network insider Jon Heyman. The Dodgers are considered among the favorites for Sasaki, but Heyman reported last week in the New York Post that L.A. will try to sign one of the Big Three even if they land the Japanese phenom. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi sees the Dodgers as one of the two leading candidates for Burnes. Red Sox: Like the Dodgers, the Red Sox have met with Snell already but are keeping their options open with Burnes and Fried, Rosenthal reports. Orioles: With Burnes a free agent after spending 2024 with Baltimore, Orioles general manager Mike Elias said Friday that the team’s new ownership group has given him the flexibility to engage with the top starting pitchers on the free-agent market. Rosenthal hears the team is currently more focused on Snell and Fried, both of whom could have lower price tags than Burnes. Blue Jays: Rosenthal reports that Toronto is pursuing Burnes, Snell and Fried. Yankees: Heyman directly mentioned the Yankees' interest in Snell, but he added that New York's willingness to go after one of the top starters may be contingent on whether it can re-sign Juan Soto. Heyman said that if Soto doesn't come back to the Bronx, the Yankees ""will be more focused"" on these aces. But if Soto is back in pinstripes, Heyman thinks the Yankees won't spend the money necessary to get one of the top pitchers. Giants: Heyman said he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if Snell returns to San Francisco after the left-hander enjoyed his time there during the 2024 season. Mets: Another club that's focused on Soto, the Mets will also be looking to upgrade a rotation that could lose Sean Manaea, José Quintana and Luis Severino in free agency. Although outfielder/first baseman Cody Bellinger exercised his player option for 2025, it’s not a guarantee that he’ll be with the Cubs on Opening Day. According to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required), rival executives say that the Cubs want to trade the 29-year-old. More > Juan Soto's decision on where to sign this offseason is the most anticipated in baseball, and according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, ""the feeling around the industry"" is that the decision could be made before the annual Winter Meetings get underway in Dallas on Dec. 9. Soto reportedly has already met with the Blue Jays, Red Sox, Mets and incumbent Yankees. Yanks owner Hal Steinbrenner confirmed Wednesday that the club had a ""good meeting"" with Soto. Soto has a couple more meetings reportedly on tap. He is scheduled to meet with the Dodgers next. And according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman, the Phillies plan to meet with Soto at some point, though nothing has been scheduled yet. Per Heyman, it's believed that no offers have been made to Soto yet. You can follow the latest rumblings on Soto here. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said Wednesday that Sasaki is expected to be part of the 2025 international amateur signing class, which means the Japanese right-hander likely won't sign with a club before Jan. 15. ""It looks like ... the signing will happen in the new pool period,"" Manfred said via The Athletic's Evan Drelich. More > While this year’s free-agent class has its share of attractive options with significant closing experience, including Tanner Scott, Kenley Jansen, Blake Treinen, Clay Holmes, Carlos Estévez, Kirby Yates and David Robertson, MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi expects the closer trade market to be active as well. Morosi has heard that the Brewers’ Devin Williams, the Cardinals’ Ryan Helsley and the Nationals’ Kyle Finnegan are available. Morosi even went as far as predicting that at least two of those closers will be traded before the end of the calendar year. Williams, Helsley and Finnegan all have one year of team control remaining and could be more cost effective than signing a closer in free agency. The latter two are perhaps more likely to be dealt, given the Cardinals and Nationals are both building for the future, but a Williams trade can’t be ruled out. Teams with serious postseason aspirations typically aren’t looking to trade away top stars from their Major League roster, but the Brewers have shown a willingness to be proactive in the past with players nearing free agency, trading Josh Hader in 2022 and Corbin Burnes last offseason. Williams could be next, though figuring out when to do it is a tough call for Milwaukee. A rival executive who spoke with MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand at the GM Meetings suggested that the Brewers would be better off waiting until the summer to put Williams on the trade block to maximize the return. However, it's possible they will look to deal Williams this offseason to avoid a repeat of the Willy Adames situation. Milwaukee didn’t trade Adames at the Deadline this past summer because it was leading the NL Central, and now the shortstop can depart as a free agent, leaving the club with nothing but a Draft pick in return. Thirteen players were tendered a qualifying offer (a one-year, $21.05 million deal for 2025) this offseason, but Reds right-hander Nick Martinez was the only one who accepted prior to Tuesday's 4 p.m. ET deadline. The following 12 players rejected the qualifying offer and will remain free agents: Since the system was implemented in 2012, only 14 players to receive a QO have accepted it. You can read more about year's QO decisions here. Roki Sasaki isn't the only marquee Japanese pitcher who is expected to make the jump to the Majors this offseason. The 35-year-old Tomoyuki Sugano doesn't possess Sasaki's top-notch velocity, but as a two-time winner of the Sawamura Award -- the Japanese equivalent to the Cy Young Award -- Sugano should have his fair share of suitors. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi has identified one team to watch for Sugano: the Angels. More > The Orioles could be one of the big players on the free-agent market for starting pitchers in their first offseason under their new ownership group. General manager Mike Elias said Friday that the Orioles have ""engaged"" in conversations with high-end starting pitchers in free agency. ""We are looking at the whole menu, the whole spectrum and I credit the ownership change toward putting us in a position to do that,"" Elias said. The highest of the high-end starters on the open market is Corbin Burnes, and the Orioles would welcome his return to Baltimore, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan (subscription required). The Orioles also have been linked to left-handed ace Max Fried. Additionally, Baltimore is among a host of clubs interested in acquiring White Sox southpaw Garrett Crochet via trade. However, given all of the young talent they have traded in the past year, The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required) hears that the O's are more focused on the free-agent market right now. Yankees broadcaster Michael Kay said on his radio program on Monday that according to a source, Mets owner Steve Cohen is willing to beat any other club's offer to Juan Soto by $50 million. More > MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reports in an article for the New York Post that the Yankees met with superstar slugger Juan Soto in Southern California on Monday as they look to retain him after he helped lead them to the World Series. More > According to Ken Rosenthal and C. Trent Rosecrans of The Athletic (subscription required), the Royals and Reds are discussing a trade that would involve right-handed starter Brady Singer going to Cincinnati in return for infielder Jonathan India. However, sources told The Athletic that a trade involving Singer and India was not close on Saturday and is just one of several possibilities both teams are considering. Singer is reportedly drawing interest from other clubs while India is just one of the hitters the Royals are targeting. Singer and India were college teammates at the University of Florida and 2018 first-round MLB Draft picks by their current clubs. Singer is coming off a year in which he recorded a 3.71 ERA and 170 strikeouts over a career-high 179 2/3 innings. India, the 2021 National League Rookie of the Year, has been hampered by injuries during his career, but he had 15 homers and a .750 OPS in 151 games this past season. Both players are under club control through the 2026 season. The Red Sox have reportedly made their pitch -- or at least an initial one -- to Juan Soto. They are also trying to convince the top starting pitchers on the market to come to Fenway, too. ESPN's Jeff Passan said during Friday's edition of the Baseball Bar-B-Cast podcast that the Red Sox are talking to Blake Snell and Max Fried. More > Willy Adames is drawing “broad” interest across the Majors, according to MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi. While Adames’ market includes teams that have an opening at shortstop, there are also a number of clubs eyeing him as a third baseman. More > With Max Fried and Charlie Morton both free agents, adding rotation help is a priority for the Braves this offseason. Nathan Eovaldi ranks near the top of Atlanta’s wish list (per a source), but he isn’t the only free-agent starter the team is said to be considering, as MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi hears the Braves also have interest in Walker Buehler. Returning from his second Tommy John surgery, Buehler struggled to the tune of a 5.38 ERA over 16 starts this past season. However, he finished the year on a high note, tossing 10 straight scoreless innings in the postseason and closing out the Dodgers’ title-clinching win over the Yankees in Game 5 of the World Series. Buehler, 30, was one of baseball’s top starters from 2018-21, recording a 2.82 ERA (146 ERA+) with 620 strikeouts and 137 walks in 564 innings. Atlanta could be an attractive landing spot for Buehler in more ways than one. The right-hander has ties to two nearby states, as he was born in Kentucky and attended Vanderbilt in Tennessee. Buehler also just watched the Braves have success with another reclamation project, Chris Sale. Atlanta acquired Sale from the Red Sox last offseason after several injury-plagued seasons. The lefty stayed healthy in 2024 and is the overwhelming favorite to win the National League Cy Young Award. In addition to their interest in Eovaldi and Buehler, the Braves have been linked to White Sox lefty Garrett Crochet on the trade market, though it's unclear if they have enough prospect capital to swing a trade. Fried is still a possibility, too, but paying top dollar for free agents is not part of president of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos’ typical M.O. MLB Trade Rumors predicts Fried will sign a six-year, $156 million contract, compared to one year, $15 million for Buehler and two years, $44 million for Eovaldi. The Dodgers are viewed as one of the top contenders to sign Japanese right-hander Roki Sasaki once he is posted by his Nippon Professional Baseball team, the Chiba Lotte Marines. However, The Athletic's Jim Bowden (subscription required) doesn't see it that way. Based on his conversations with league sources, Bowden thinks it's ""unlikely"" Sasaki will sign with the Dodgers. And Bowden mentioned a few reasons why. More > Although the Yankees are going to make a strong effort to bring back Juan Soto, there’s a real chance the superstar outfielder signs elsewhere, which means New York needs to have a backup plan in place. That backup plan appears to have no limits. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Thursday in the New York Post that the Yankees are ""in on everyone."" One day earlier, during his live chat for Bleacher Report, Heyman was a little more specific on which non-Soto players the Yanks might target. More > The Phillies sign Alex Bregman. That is the prediction of one rival evaluator to ESPN's Buster Olney. The Phillies don't have an opening at third base right now, but they could create one by dealing Alec Bohm, who is on the trade block, per ESPN's Jeff Passan (subscription required). Bohm and Bregman had similar offensive production this year (the former had a 117 OPS+ while the latter had a 118) and both were plus defenders according to outs above average. However, Bregman, a 2024 Gold Glover, has a much longer track record of stellar defense at the hot corner. His has 28 OAA for his career at the position while Bohm has minus-8. Bregman would also bring a large dose of World Series experience to a club that has been thwarted in the postseason in recent years and hasn't won it all since 2008. The Astros have made it clear that re-signing Bregman is their biggest priority of the offseason, but he isn't expected to make his decision any time soon. MLB.com's Mark Feinsand said during a Reddit AMA on Tuesday that he thinks Bregman's chances of remaining with Houston are 50/50. Although the White Sox didn't move Garrett Crochet prior to the Trade Deadline, there appears to be little doubt about their intentions for the left-hander this offseason. ""They're going to trade him this winter,"" a rival evaluator told ESPN's Buster Olney at the GM Meetings last week. ""It's not a matter of if; it's a question of when."" Olney shed some light on Crochet's potential market in an article for ESPN+ (subscription required) on Wednesday, noting that general manager Chris Getz is looking for ""a package of prospects constructed around at least one high-ceiling youngster to anchor the deal,"" with a preference for that main piece to be a position player. Based on conversations with industry sources, Olney names the Phillies, Padres, Yankees, Dodgers, Braves, Orioles, Red Sox and Mets as teams that could pursue a Crochet trade. You can follow the latest rumblings on Crochet here. ESPN's Jeff Passan breaks down the markets for the key free agents and trade targets in his 2024-25 offseason preview (subscription required). Here's what he's reporting on potential landing spots for some of the top hitters and pitchers available: FA hitters FA pitchers Trade market The players Passan cites as potentially being available on the trade market this winter include: Pitchers -- White Sox ace Garrett Crochet, Brewers closer Devin Williams, Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley, Cardinals right-hander Sonny Gray, Mariners right-hander Luis Castillo, D-backs left-hander Jordan Montgomery, Rockies reliever Justin Lawrence Position players -- Cubs second baseman Nico Hoerner and outfielder Cody Bellinger, Phillies third baseman Alec Bohm, Cardinals third baseman Nolan Arenado, Guardians first baseman Josh Naylor, Rays second baseman Brandon Lowe and first baseman Yandy Díaz, Giants first baseman LaMonte Wade Jr., Rockies second baseman Brendan Rodgers According to a report from USA Today’s Bob Nightengale, Christian Walker is a popular name on the free-agent market, with at least six teams planning to “aggressively pursue” the first baseman. Walker received a qualifying offer from the D-backs, but he will likely decline it. Nightengale names the Yankees, Mets and Nationals as teams that are expected to join Arizona in pursuit of Walker, who should come with a lower price tag than that of fellow free-agent first baseman Pete Alonso, given the age disparity between the two players. (Walker is four years older.) The Yankees and Mets are also two of the top contenders for Juan Soto, the No. 1 free agent on the market, but both clubs need to address first base as well. With his expected price tag, signing Walker likely wouldn't impact either team's pursuit of Soto, who is headed for one of the largest contracts in MLB history. Walker doesn’t have quite the same power as Alonso, but he’s no slouch with the bat, having recorded 95 homers and an .813 OPS over the past three seasons. In that same time, Alonso has produced 120 homers and an .826 OPS. Walker, meanwhile, is a far better defender, winning three straight Gold Gloves and leading his position with +38 Outs Above Average since the beginning of 2022. Alonso has produced -17 OAA in that span. In addition to the teams Nightengale mentioned, the Astros, Twins, Mariners, Cardinals and Padres could also be involved in the first-base market to some extent.",2024-11-21
MLB News,Premier12 super-round results,https://www.mlb.com/news/premier12-super-round-scores-and-results,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 13:22:00 GMT",,"Michael Clair TOKYO -- Four teams are left to battle for the title of Premier12 champions -- the international tournament that pits the top 12 ranked baseball nations against each other and has helped spur the career of many future Major Leaguers. The top two teams from each group -- Venezuela and the United States from Group A and Japan and Chinese Taipei from Group B -- advanced to the super round, where they will now play a three-day round robin to determine which two teams will face off in the championship game on Sunday. There will be two games held each day at the Tokyo Dome (start times are 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. ET) and the action is available to be streamed with a subscription to DAZN in the United States and Canada. As we work toward the championship game, we’ll keep you updated with the outcomes of each super-round game in this story. Super-round Game 1: Venezuela 2, Chinese Taipei 0 Venezuela powered its way through the group stage, going 4-1 to take first place thanks to an experienced lineup with plenty of pop. On Thursday afternoon at the Tokyo Dome, that trend continued: Carlos Eduardo Pérez (one of two catchers named Carlos Pérez on the roster) -- who saw Major League action in parts of five seasons, most recently with the A’s in 2023 -- hit a two-run home run in the fourth inning to give Venezuela a lead that it would never relinquish. 🇻🇪💪 Arepa Power, Carlos Perez with the Home Run! #Premier12 || @Premier12 pic.twitter.com/75nvEJtxLU After Nivaldo Rodriguez -- who went 10-4 with a 2.16 ERA in the CPBL this past season, making him very familiar with the Chinese Taipei lineup -- pitched four shutout innings, Venezuela manager Omar López then utilized his bullpen to perfection. Seven relievers followed -- five of them recording just one out (there is no batter minimum in the Premier12 tournament) -- to finish off the shutout. ""The reason why we're getting stronger is because we have the Venezuelan name on our chest,"" López said after the game. ""And when you have the Venezuelan name, when you wear the jersey, there is nothing better than that. Nothing. Nothing. It's pride, it's honor and it's privilege."" Game 2: Japan 9, United States 1 For four innings, it was one of the most unlikely pitching duels you'll ever see: On one side was 44-year-old USA starter Rich Hill, a veteran of nearly 400 big league games who befuddled and bewitched Samurai Japan batters with an endless bevy of slow curves that at times barely crested 70 mph. On the other was Hitaro Takahashi, the young Japanese ace who is half Hill’s age, armed with a 98 mph fastball and diving low-90s split-finger. Despite the difference in styles, the two matched each other: Hill gave up one hit and struck out five. Takahashi, with dreams of the big leagues and MLB scouts in attendance, gave up two hits and struck out eight. Once pulled though, the runs came: A’s No. 7 prospect Colby Thomas, who hit 31 home runs in the Minors last year, blasted a solo shot to right-field in the top of the fifth, flapping the ‘USA’ on his chest as he rounded the bases. 🇺🇸😤 Colby Thomas destroyed that baseball! #Premier12 || @Premier12 | @USABaseball pic.twitter.com/bHt0Ht9IPT That was no match for Japan’s second baseman Kaito Kozono. Despite hitting just two home runs in 588 PA for the Hiroshima Carp this season, he went supernova on Thursday: Kozono hit a two-run triple in the fifth, a three-run homer in the 7th, and capped it off with a two-run shot in the 8th. That was enough for the seemingly unbeatable Japan, who extended their international winning streak to a remarkable 25 games. Their last loss came against the United States in the 2019 Premier12. 🔥🔥🔥 Kaito Kozono is a walking flame! #Premier12 || @Premier12 pic.twitter.com/rn5ttVKLS7 Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball.",2024-11-21

The Birmingham Barons, Double-A affiliate of the Chicago White Sox, will host the Rocket City Trash Pandas (Angels) at Rickwood Field in a tribute to the Negro Leagues on June 4, 2025, the team announced on Thursday. Between 1996-2016 and 2018-19, the Barons played one game -- the Rickwood Classic -- at Rickwood Field each Minor League season. As a ballpark that was the homefield of a Negro Leagues franchise that competed for several seasons on circuits now recognized as Major League level, Rickwood Field is a living monument to the thousands of Birmingham fans who filled its stands and the hundreds of Black baseball pioneers who competed between its lines -- including Baseball Hall of Famers Satchel Paige, Willie Wells and Mule Suttles. Willie Mays, who grew up about five miles away from Rickwood Field in Fairfield, Ala., also played his first games as a professional there. Mays joined the Birmingham Black Barons at age 17 in 1948. ⚾️BREAKING: The Barons will return to Rickwood Field in 2025.

The beautiful concrete and steel ballyard remained the Black Barons' home through 1960, and the Southern League's Barons played there through 1987. The venue became the center of the baseball world from June 18-20, 2024, for Major League Baseball's Tribute to the Negro Leagues, during which the Barons hosted the Montgomery Biscuits (Rays) in MiLB at Rickwood and the Giants hosted the Cardinals in MLB at Rickwood. Ahead of that celebration, Rickwood Field underwent a multimillion-dollar renovation that provided the playing surface an extensive makeover, added a new and padded outfield wall, installed new dugouts, upgraded accessibility features and more -- all while maintaining the stadium's classic feel and intimate setting. In addition to hosting amateur tournaments over the years, the facility got use in -- and considerable help from -- Hollywood productions. Cobb (1994), 42 (2013) and Soul of the Game (1995) all shot scenes at the park. The Barons' season starts on April 4, as they host the Knoxville Smokies (Cubs) at Regions Field.

MLB News,Steinbrenner addresses Yanks' hot topics at Owners Meetings,https://www.mlb.com/news/hal-steinbrenner-discusses-juan-soto-gerrit-cole-owners-meetings-2024,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:38:41 GMT",,"Bryan Hoch This story was excerpted from Bryan Hoch's Yankees Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. The image at the far end of Yankee Stadium’s first-base dugout was instantly poignant. Juan Soto clutched a bat, ballcap and glove in his left hand, placing his right hand across his heart. He looked skyward, expressing thanks for what the star outfielder would moments later say had been a “really special” year wearing pinstripes. Then Soto was gone, out the door into the great unknown of free agency. The organization has every intention of ensuring that moment after Game 5 of the World Series will depict the beginning of a long story, not the conclusion of one, which is why the Yankees’ most essential decision-makers traveled to express their interest to Soto and agent Scott Boras earlier this week in Newport Beach, Calif. Speaking with reporters on Wednesday at the Owners Meetings in Manhattan, N.Y., Yankees managing general partner Hal Steinbrenner described a “good meeting” that included “a very honest, back-and-forth dialogue” with Soto and Boras. Steinbrenner said he understands why the fans want Soto back so desperately; the team does, too. Will their mission be successful? Steinbrenner declined to speculate, replying: “No idea. We’ll be in the mix. I’ll leave it at that.” Steinbrenner touched upon numerous other topics of interest during the group interview session, which took place in the lobby of Major League Baseball’s offices on Sixth Avenue. Steinbrenner remarked, ""I don’t think you can ever have enough pitching,” noting that the team would “take a deep dive” into the starting rotation and the bullpen. First base, second base and left field are also areas of need. Since the World Series, the organization has been busy evaluating every free agent in the marketplace. “We do have other things to add, whether that’s via a free agent or whether that’s via a trade,” he said. “We’ve got some things we need to improve. Every club does.” While Steinbrenner has said that he does not believe a repeat of last year’s payroll is sustainable, he said that he does not have a set payroll for 2025, adding that he told general manager Brian Cashman: “Just have your people [bring] every possibility out there. I want it coming my way, and we’ll just keep talking.” World Series reaction Steinbrenner said that “it still stings” to think about the Yankees’ loss to the Dodgers in the World Series, their first appearance in the Fall Classic since 2009. “It’s interesting, when you’re that close and you don’t get there, it stays with you for a while,” Steinbrenner said. “All of us feel the same way. We’re just going to have to get right back at it in March and get there again, and get the job done next year.” Steinbrenner said he disagreed with the criticism that followed the loss, suggesting that the Yankees lack fundamentals on the basepaths and defensively. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. “Listen, we did not play a clean World Series. I think we all know that,” he said. “But those fundamentals got us to the World Series. Our play, for the most part, we saw during the course of the year. That’s why we won a pennant for the first time in 15 years. No doubt, in the World Series, they just played better than us. Period.” Rays at Steinbrenner FieldWith Tropicana Field unplayable due to hurricane damage, the Rays will become the Yankees’ tenants for the 2025 season at George M. Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Fla., with the Yankees receiving $15 million in the transaction. We are thrilled to play in Tampa Bay. 🩵 Steinbrenner said leasing the facility was “the right thing to do for their fan base, many of whom are my neighbors and friends that live in Tampa.” Steinbrenner said that the challenges will come in logistics, such as ensuring that vendors have enough food and beverages for long homestands and adding storage. The visitors’ clubhouse will be modified at the responsibility of the Rays, and lights will be added to an adjacent field, where the now-displaced Single-A Tampa Tarpons will play for a season. Extensions on deck for Boone, Cole? Steinbrenner said that “step one” of the offseason was exercising manager Aaron Boone’s contractual option for 2025, and that he plans to speak with Cashman soon concerning a possible extension for Boone. Said Steinbrenner: “There’s no huge rush to it, but I will have those discussions as to what we should do next.” As for Gerrit Cole, Steinbrenner said that there were “a number of factors involved” after Cole exercised his opt-out on Nov. 3, acknowledging: “I wasn’t in a position where I was comfortable going to a fifth year [to extend Cole’s contract through 2029]. “… But let me just say, that doesn’t reflect in any way, shape or form what we think of Gerrit. We want Gerrit to be a Yankee for life. I believe he wants to be a Yankee for life. And adding one more year or not adding one more year should have no meaning when it comes to that.”",2024-11-21
MLB News,Every franchise's BBWAA award winners,https://www.mlb.com/news/major-award-winners-for-every-mlb-team,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 23:56:00 GMT",,"MLB.com The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) honors MLB's best with its four annual awards: MVP, Cy Young, Rookie of the Year and Manager of the Year.

MLB News,Consecutive MVP winners in MLB history,https://www.mlb.com/news/players-to-win-back-to-back-mvp-awards,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 23:51:00 GMT",,"Andrew Simon Winning one MVP Award is hard. Defending that title the next year is even more difficult. However, Shohei Ohtani makes everything look easy. On Thursday, the Dodgers superstar not only won his second consecutive MVP Award, he became the first player to do so after changing leagues. There have been 34 individuals who have won more than one MVP Award in their careers (including versions of the award that predate the modern Baseball Writers' Association of America MVP Award). But since the BBWAA began handing out the coveted hardware in 1931, just 14 have gone back to back -- with one doing so multiple times. Here is a look at the members of this exclusive club, beginning with Ohtani. Shohei Ohtani (2023 American League, 2024 National League)In ‘23, Ohtani ended his six-year stint with the Angels by earning his second AL MVP honor. He hit 44 homers and pitched to a 3.14 ERA over 132 innings that year. The following season, Ohtani joined the Dodgers and even though he was unable to pitch as he recovered from elbow surgery, he was sublime as a full-time hitter. Ohtani celebrated his third MVP win after batting .310 and establishing the 50-homer, 50-stolen base club. He ended the year with 54 dingers and 59 steals. Miguel Cabrera: 2012-13 (AL)While some disputed Miggy’s MVP claim in both cases, due to the all-around brilliance of an emerging superstar in the AL, Cabrera easily beat out Mike Trout for the honor in both 2012 and ‘13. His argument was pretty straightforward. In ‘12, Cabrera became the first player to win a Triple Crown since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967. He won another batting title the next year, while matching his home run total (44) and finishing with 137 RBIs, just short of his total (139) from '12. Albert Pujols: 2008-09 (NL)Pujols was already a veteran of the MVP race at this point, having finished in the top four in six of his first seven seasons, including a win in 2005. But ‘08 and ‘09 were perhaps the two best years Pujols had during an incredible run in St. Louis, as he hit a combined .342/.452/.656 with 84 home runs and 251 RBIs. He even stole 16 bases in '09. Barry Bonds: 2001-04 (NL)No other player in MLB history has won four MVP Awards in an entire career. Bonds won four in a row with the Giants -- when he already had three in the bank (see below). These were the four years when Bonds broke the single-season home run record (2001) and just about broke baseball entirely. He had a .559 OBP, an .809 slugging percentage and 755 walks over that span. Frank Thomas: 1993-94 (AL)The Hall of Fame slugger was in just his third full season, at age 25, when he was a unanimous selection in 1993 after racking up 41 home runs and 128 RBIs for the White Sox. The Big Hurt was even better the next year, but unfortunately, the strike halted a campaign in which he was batting an absurd .353/.487/.729 with 38 homers in 113 games. Bonds: 1992-93 (NL)Bonds, who won his first MVP Award in 1990, took his second in his final season with the Pirates, ‘92, when he led the Majors in OBP (.456) and slugging (.624). He was even better the next year after signing as a free agent with the Giants, slashing .336/.458/.677 with 46 homers and 123 RBIs. Dale Murphy: 1982-83 (NL)Coming off a disappointing 1981 campaign, Murphy enjoyed a big season, smacking 36 homers and driving in an NL-high 109 runs as he led the Braves to their first postseason appearance since ‘69 (and second since moving to Atlanta in ‘66). The Braves didn’t quite make it back the next year, but Murphy led the NL in RBIs again (121), along with slugging (.540) and OPS (.933).

Mike Schmidt: 1980-81 (NL)Despite hitting at least 36 home runs and driving in at least 100 runs five times apiece in his first seven full seasons, Schmidt had not been named MVP. That all changed as the slick-fielding, hard-hitting third baseman got his due in two straight years. Schmidt is the most recent player to win a regular season and World Series MVP in the same season, doing so in 1980. Joe Morgan: 1975-76 (NL)This was at the height of the Big Red Machine in Cincinnati, as the Reds won a combined 210 games and two World Series in these two seasons. Morgan was the best player on both of those star-studded rosters, combining Gold Glove defense at second base with great speed (127 steals), on-base skill (.456 OBP) and power (44 homers). Roger Maris: 1960-61 (AL)In December 1959, the Yankees acquired Maris from the Kansas City A’s. It was good timing. Maris’ first year in pinstripes featured 39 homers and 112 RBIs. His second featured the breaking of Babe Ruth’s single-season home run record, as Maris swatted 61. The Yankees won AL pennants both years, and the ‘61 World Series. Ernie Banks: 1958-59 (NL)As was the case for much of Banks’ career, the Cubs were not a very good team in these two seasons, with back-to-back sub-.500, fifth-place finishes. Banks transcended his situation by producing a combined 92 home runs and 272 RBIs while playing shortstop. Mickey Mantle: 1956-57 (AL)A young Mantle, in his prime, was basically unstoppable. He launched 52 home runs and drove in 130 in 1956, and put together a combined line of .358/.487/.686 in these two seasons. He was worth 11.3 WAR both years, making him one of four position players in history to reach the 11-WAR mark twice in a career. Yogi Berra: 1954-55 (AL)Before Mantle and Maris, it was Berra winning consecutive MVPs for the Yankees. The catcher already had one to his credit (1951), part of a run in which he finished in the top four in the voting for seven straight seasons. Berra topped 20 homers and 100 RBIs in both of these years, while working behind the plate. Hal Newhouser: 1944-45 (AL)The only pitcher on this list, Newhouser led the Majors in wins and strikeouts in both seasons, going a combined 54-18 with a 2.01 ERA. The left-hander led the Tigers to the 1945 World series, had a rough time in his first start, then came back for complete-game victories in Games 5 and 7, as the Tigers beat the Cubs. Jimmie Foxx: 1932-33 (AL)In 1932, Ruth’s career was starting to wind down. Meanwhile, Foxx was becoming the game’s top slugger. The Philadelphia A’s star led the Majors in homers, RBIs, slugging percentage and OPS in both ‘32 and ‘33, going deep a total of 106 times and batting .360/.460/.726.",2024-11-21
MLB News,Players with most MVP Awards in MLB history,https://www.mlb.com/news/most-mlb-mvp-awards-c294414636,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 23:55:00 GMT",Just 30 players have won the annual honor more than once,"Manny Randhawa In baseball history, there are precious few players who have ever won more than one Most Valuable Player Award. Here's a look at each of the 30 individuals to do so since the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) began voting for MVP in 1931, including a select group of 12 to do it three times or more. Barry Bonds, 7 (1990, '92, '93, 2001-04)Bonds hit .301/.406/.565 with 33 home runs and 52 steals to earn his first NL MVP Award in 1990 with the Pirates, and .311/.456/.624 with 34 homers and 39 steals in '92 with Pittsburgh. After signing as a free agent with the Giants, he slashed .336/.458/.677 with 43 home runs and 29 steals in '93 to win his third MVP honor. He won the the award four more times with some of the greatest offensive seasons in baseball history from 2001-04, including a record 73-homer season in '01. He finished his 22-year career with records of 762 homers, 2,558 walks and 688 intentional walks. Shohei Ohtani: 3 (2021, '23, '24)Arguably the most talented player the game has ever known, Ohtani won two MVP Awards through his first six seasons in the Majors because of his incredible ability to operate simultaneously as an elite power hitter and a starting rotation ace. Each of his two AL MVP seasons with the Angels included at least 40 homers and a .950 OPS at the plate coupled with a 140 or better ERA+ across more than 130 innings pitched. That made him the only player in MLB history to win multiple MVPs by a unanimous vote -- but he didn’t stop there. After signing with the Dodgers as a free agent, Ohtani (rehabbing from Tommy John surgery throughout 2024) immediately showed that he was still a worthy MVP (and once again, a unanimous MVP) even while playing exclusively as a DH. In doing so, he joined Frank Robinson as the only two players to take MVP honors in both the AL and NL Mike Trout, 3 (2014, ‘16, ’19)Trout’s third MVP also marked his seventh top-two finish in AL MVP voting out of eight full seasons as a Major Leaguer. He is the only player to garner seven top-two showings in a span of eight seasons, and he now stands tied with legends Stan Musial and Albert Pujols for the second-most top-two MVP finishes behind Barry Bonds’ nine. Trout’s 2019 season was on pace to possibly be his best before a foot injury cut his season short in September. But he still finished with 8.6 fWAR after hitting .291/.438/.645 and bashing a career-high 45 homers across 134 games. Albert Pujols, 3 (2005, '08, '09)Pujols turned in prodigious seasons at the plate from his very first year in the Majors, but he won his first MVP Award in 2005, hitting .330/.430/.609 with 41 homers for the Cardinals. Pujols would win again in 2008 and '09, a pair of seasons over which he hit .342/.452/.656 with 84 home runs. Alex Rodriguez, 3 (2003, '05, '07)It was in 2003 that Rodriguez broke through and claimed his first MVP Award, though he actually had better numbers in the two seasons prior for the Rangers, posting OPS marks of 1.021 and 1.015, respectively, in 2001 and '02. In '03 he slashed .298/.396/.600 with 47 homers and 17 steals for Texas. Rodriguez was named MVP again in '05 with the Yankees (1.031 OPS, 48 homers, 21 steals) and '07 (1.067 OPS, 54 home runs, 156 RBIs, 24 steals). Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Mike Schmidt, 3 (1980, '81, '86)Schmidt won the first of three career MVP Awards in 1980, a year in which he also led the Phillies to a World Series championship. During the regular season that year, Schmidt hit .286/.380/.624 with 48 homers and won his fifth consecutive Gold Glove Award. He was named NL MVP again the next year, slashing .316/.435/.644 with 31 homers in a strike-shortened season (he played in 102 games), while winning another Gold Glove Award. Schmidt's final MVP season was 1986, when at age 36, he hit .290/.390/.547 with 37 homers and won his 10th Gold Glove Award. Mickey Mantle, 3 (1956, '57, '62)Mantle finished in the top five for AL MVP voting nine times in his career, winning in 1956, '57 and '62. In '56 and '57, he was at his peak at age 24 and 25, hitting .358/.487/.686 with 86 home runs in that span. In '62, Mantle was limited by injury to 123 games, yet was still named MVP after slashing .321/.486/.605 with 30 homers and his only career Gold Glove Award. Yogi Berra, 3 (1951, '54, '55)Berra won his first AL MVP Award in 1951, when he hit .294/.350/.492 with 27 home runs to help the Yankees earn a meeting with the Giants in the World Series, where they defeated their cross-town rivals in six games. The catcher won again in '54 and '55, during the best offensive stretch of his career; in '54, he posted an .855 OPS with 22 home runs, and the following season, he posted an .819 OPS with 27 homers. Roy Campanella, 3 (1951, '53, '55)Though his career was cut short after he was involved in a 1958 car accident that left him paralyzed, Campanella was one of the best players in the game during his 10-year career with the Brooklyn Dodgers. He won his first NL MVP Award in 1951, hitting .325/.393/.590 with 33 homers. Two seasons later, he won his second MVP honor, posting a 1.006 OPS with 41 home runs and a league-leading 142 RBIs. And in '55, he helped lead the Dodgers to their first World Series title in a victory over the Yankees, slashing .318/.395/.583 with 32 home runs during the regular season. Stan Musial, 3 (1943, '46, '48)Musial won the NL MVP Award three times over a 22-year career spent entirely with the Cardinals. In his first MVP season -- 1943 -- a 22-year-old Musial hit .357/.425/.562 with 48 doubles, 20 triples and 13 home runs to help St. Louis reach the World Series. After missing a season to serve in World War II, Musial returned to hit .365/.434/.587 with 50 doubles and 20 homers to claim his second MVP Award. And in '48, Musial won his third, slashing .376/.450/.702 with 46 doubles, 18 triples and 39 homers. Joe DiMaggio, 3 (1939, '41, '47)The Yankee Clipper hit .381/.448/.671 with 30 homers in '39 to win his first MVP Award. In '41, a season forever remembered for his record 56-game hitting streak, DiMaggio hit .357/.440/.643 with 30 homers to win his second MVP honor. In his third MVP season, in '47, he slashed .315/.391/.522 with 20 homers in 97 games before earning his sixth World Series ring in a victory over the Dodgers. Jimmie Foxx, 3 (1932, '33, '38)Foxx hit 534 home runs over a 20-year career, 106 of which came in just two seasons for the Philadelphia Athletics from 1932-33. Over that span, he hit .360/.460/.726 and won back-to-back AL MVP Awards. He won again in '38, a year in which he posted a 1.166 OPS with 50 home runs and 175 RBIs. Taken together, these three seasons are some of the greatest offensive campaigns in MLB history. Aaron Judge: 2 (2022, ‘24)Even another great Ohtani season in 2022 couldn’t overcome Judge setting the AL’s single-season home run record with 62, to go along with a ridiculous 210 OPS+ and 131 RBIs. At the time, it seemed like that would obviously be Judge’s peak, but amazingly, it wasn’t. While Judge didn’t quite match that home run total two years later, hitting 58, he had more RBIs (144) and was a better hitter on a rate basis. In modern AL/NL history, no right-handed batter has ever topped Judge’s 223 OPS+ in 2024. With Ohtani on the NL side this time, Judge’s second MVP came unanimously. Bryce Harper: 2 (2015, '21)Harper added a second NL MVP Award to his resume with a monster 2021 campaign. Following a 2012 NL Rookie of the Year Award and his first MVP honor in 2015, the slugging right fielder ""quietly"" continued to put up excellent, if not headline-grabbing, numbers, posting an .899 OPS (133 OPS+) with 135 home runs from 2016-20. But in '21, he couldn't be denied the highest award for an NL position player after hitting .309/.429/.615 with 35 homers, leading baseball in doubles (42), slugging (.615), OPS (1.044) and OPS+ (179). Miguel Cabrera: 2 (2012-13)Cabrera won back-to-back AL MVP Awards in 2012 and '13. His first came after the slugger turned in the first Triple Crown season since Boston's Carl Yastrzemski's in 1967. Cabrera hit .330 with 44 home runs and 139 RBIs while helping the Tigers win the AL pennant. In '13, he had an even better year, hitting .348/.442/.636 with 44 homers. Juan Gonzalez: 2 (1996, '98)Gonzalez was one of the premier sluggers of the 1990s, hitting 339 home runs during the decade and winning two AL MVP Awards. The first came in 1996, when he slashed .314/.368/.643 with 47 homers in 134 games for the Rangers. He won his second MVP Award in '98, hitting .318/.366/.630 with 50 homers and 157 RBIs for Texas. Frank Thomas: 2 (1993-94)The Big Hurt won AL MVP Awards in 1993 and '94, at the peak of his prodigious slugging powers. He helped the White Sox win their first division title in a decade by slashing .317/.426/.607 with 41 homers. He followed that up with an even better campaign in the strike-shortened '94 season, hitting .353/.487/.729 with 38 homers in 113 games. Cal Ripken Jr.: 2 (1983, '91)Ripken won a pair of AL MVP Awards nearly a decade apart. His first came as a 22-year-old in 1983. That year, he led the league in runs scored (121), hits (211) and doubles (47) while slashing .318/.371/.517 with 27 homers, also leading the Orioles to a World Series victory over the Phillies. Ripken's second MVP Award came in '91, when he hit .323/.374/.566 with 34 homers. Robin Yount: 2 (1982, '89)Yount led the AL in hits (210), doubles (46) and slugging percentage (.578) en route to winning his first MVP Award in 1982. The Brewers star hit .318/.384/.511 with 21 homers and 19 steals in '89 to win his second MVP honor. Dale Murphy: 2 (1982-83)In 1982, the Braves slugger slashed .281/.378/.507 with 36 home runs and 23 steals to win his first MVP Award. The encore was even better, when in '83, he hit .302/.393/.540 with 36 homers and 30 steals to win a second straight MVP honor. From 1982-87, he won those two MVP Awards, five Gold Glove Awards, and was an All-Star every season. Joe Morgan: 2 (1975-76)Morgan was the NL MVP in 1975 and '76, the years the Big Red Machine won back-to-back World Series championships. In '75, he hit .327/.466/.508 with 17 homers and 67 steals, leading the league in walks, on-base percentage and OPS. He followed that up with a season in which he increased the power numbers, posting a .320/.444/.576 slash line, 27 homers and 60 steals. He led the league in both on-base and slugging percentage.   Johnny Bench: 2 (1970, '72)Bench, considered by many to be the greatest catcher of all-time, won the honor in 1970 and '72. In '70, he slashed .293/.345/.587 and led the league in homers (45) and RBIs (148). Two seasons later, he again led in homers (40) and RBIs (125), hitting .270/.379/.541 for Cincinnati.   Frank Robinson: 2 (1961, '66)Robinson won the first of two MVP Awards at age 25 in 1961 for the Reds. The slugger slashed .323/.404/.611 with 37 doubles and 22 steals. He won the award again in '66, but this time in the AL for the Orioles. In his first season with Baltimore, he won the Triple Crown by hitting .316 with 49 home runs and 122 RBIs. He was also named MVP of that fall's World Series as the Orioles swept the Dodgers.   Roger Maris: 2 (1960-61)Maris will forever be remembered for breaking Babe Ruth's single-season home run record with 61 homers in 1961, but he was already the reigning AL MVP entering that season. In '60, he hit .283/.371/.581 with 39 homers, and won his only career Gold Glove Award. He then set the home run mark in '61, hitting .269/.372/.620 with 141 RBIs to win his second straight MVP Award.   Ernie Banks: 2 (1958-59)""Mr. Cub,"" famous for his ""Let's play two"" saying, was the NL MVP in 1958 and '59. The shortstop led the NL in slugging (.614), home runs (47) and RBIs (129) to win his first MVP honor in '59, and then hit .304/.374/.596 with 45 homers and a league-leading 143 RBIs to win his second consecutive MVP Award the following year. Willie Mays: 2 (1954, '65)Mays, considered one of the greatest all-around players in baseball history, was the NL MVP in 1954, and then again 11 years later. In '54, the 23-year-old center fielder helped lead the Giants to a World Series sweep of the Indians, making his famous over-the-shoulder catch in center field in Game 1. But before all of that, he hit .345/.411/.667 with 41 homers after returning from military service. In '65, he slashed .317/.398/.645 with a career-high 52 homers to win his second MVP honor. Ted Williams: 2 (1946, '49)The ""Splendid Splinter won his first AL MVP Award the season after returning from service in World War II. In 1946, he slashed .342/.497/.667 with 38 home runs and a league-leading 158 walks. His second MVP season was in '49, when he hit .343/.490/.650 and led the league in doubles (39), homers (43), RBIs (159) and walks (162). Hal Newhouser: 2 (1944-45)Newhouser won back-to-back AL MVP Awards with the Tigers in 1944 and '45. Over those two seasons, the left-hander had a 2.01 ERA over 625 2/3 innings, leading the league with 399 strikeouts. Hank Greenberg: 2 (1935, '40)Greenberg hit 36 homers and drove in 168 while slashing .328/.411/.628 to win his first MVP Award in 1935 with the Tigers. In 1940, he had another monster season at the plate to win his second MVP Award, hitting .340/.433/.670 with 41 homers and 150 RBIs for Detroit. Carl Hubbell: 2 (1933, '36)Hubbell, one of three pitchers to ever win multiple MVP Awards, won in 1933 and '36 with the Giants. In '33, he posted a 1.66 ERA over 308 2/3 innings and then tossed 20 scoreless frames in the World Series, which the Giants won over the Senators. Three seasons later, he was named MVP again by posting a 2.31 ERA over 304 innings before a 2.25 ERA in two starts during the World Series, a loss to the Giants. Before the BBWAA took over MVP voting in 1931, the award existed in other forms, and with differing rules, between 1911-14 and 1922-30. If these earlier versions were combined with the modern MVP Award, four other Hall of Famers would join the list of multi-time winners: ^Unofficial, pre-BBWAA voting",2024-11-21

The 39-year-old has missed only 35 games due to injury and other absences were due to suspensions and being in COVID-19 protocol. Ovechkin's previous longest stretch of missed games was six due to an upper-body injury in November 2009. “Everyone’s bummed out,” said Capitals forward Tom Wilson, a teammate of Ovechkin's since 2013. “We were sitting there saying: ‘This is weird. Like, it’s unbelievable that he’s actually hurt.’ It’s one of those things where like, he’s going to miss games? I’ve been around a long time, and it’s new to me.” Ovechkin has had a red-hot start to the season and had scored five goals in his previous two games before the injury. His 15 goals this season puts him at 868 for his career, 26 behind the NHL record of 894 held by Wayne Gretzky.

That’s the question. If he really cared about a World Series ring, Judge, who was named the unanimous 2024 AL MVP on Thursday, would sell his fancy new trophy on eBay and give the proceeds to Yankees general manager Brian Cashman so the club can sign another bullpen arm for 2025. That’s what a real captain would do. Derek Jeter, the perfect example of Yankees leadership, had the perspective and wherewithal to never play well enough to warrant winning such a selfish award. Look, I’m not saying that Judge should play worse during the regular season next year; that’s preposterous. But if he melted the AL MVP trophy down and had it remade into a sculpture of the 2024 Dodgers celebrating their world championship and then put that sculpture on his bedside table so he could wake up every morning properly motivated, it wouldn’t be the most inappropriate thing. It’s tradition for MVP winners to accept their awards at the annual BBWAA New York Chapter dinner in January. And while I’m sure fans would love to see Judge there, he should honestly be spending that time in the gym or the batting cage GRINDING for the 2025 season. A night in a tuxedo with boring writers like me isn’t working toward the ultimate goal of a Yankees parade. As they say, if you aren’t getting better, you’re getting worse. Shohei Ohtani, the unanimous 2024 NL MVP, is a different story, his own overlooked postseason struggles aside. Sure, the Dodger dynamo’s October OPS was only 15 points higher than Judge’s, but Ohtani is a winner who won. With Judge, that’s clearly not the case. And don’t forget: The last time Judge won this award, back in 2022, the Yankees were a train wreck the following season, missing out on the playoffs. Does the Yankees captain really want to tempt fate again? Might be best to let Bobby Witt Jr., who finished second in AL MVP voting, take the award. People speak volumes about Judge’s steadiness and consistency during the marathon of a 162-game season. That’s pretty cool, I guess, but I’d rather have a totally erratic teammate who wakes up hungover on Oct. 1 and clobbers 15 playoff bombs. Not somebody like Judge, who finished this past postseason with a ... .752 OPS, which ... actually isn’t that bad? Huh. How 'bout that? You know what? Maybe it’s best to hold multiple thoughts in our heads at the same time. Yes, Judge underwhelmed by his lofty standards in a 14-game postseason sample, but maybe, just maybe, that doesn’t invalidate what was an all-time magnificent offensive performance in the regular season. Judge’s 2024 was, by OPS+, the best season by a hitter since Barry Bonds put up a 263 OPS+ in 2004. The titanic Yankees outfielder finished the season with a comical stat line: 58 home runs, a .322 batting average, an 1.159 OPS and an adjusted OPS 123% better than league average. Only three players in MLB history have posted an OPS+ higher than Judge’s 223 mark this year: Bonds, Babe Ruth and Ted Williams. Not too shabby. And sure, as my idiotic ramblings above alluded to, Judge’s struggles on the big stage leave an unfortunate haze over our collective memory of his season. It’s a fact, one he knows and one he has owned: When the games mattered most, Judge was not at his best. Whether that’s because he can’t handle the spotlight or because baseball is difficult and random is up to the eye of the beholder. Just remember that the Yankees’ World Series Game 5 capitulation was so total and complete that it’s impossible to pin on any one soul. Maybe I’m being the “Steph Curry arguing against nobody” meme, but whatever. Judge's outstanding 162 cannot simply wipe away his autumnal stumble. Yet at the same time, his substandard October shouldn’t completely overshadow six months of downright dominance. Both are true, both are important, and both tell the story of Aaron Judge’s 2024, a season that we’ll remember for a long, long time. Hopefully, for all the right reasons.",2024-11-21

Commissioner Rob Manfred told The Athletic's Evan Drellich on Wednesday that the league will test an automated ball-strike challenge system in spring training in 2025, with the hope that the system can be implemented in the regular season in 2026. The system will reportedly give teams two challenges per game, with teams retaining them when they are correct. Not every spring training ballpark will reportedly have the ABS cameras, but all teams will have the opportunity to play with the new system. From The Athletic: “I think we will have a spring training ABS test that will provide a meaningful opportunity for all major-league players to see what the challenge system will look like,” Manfred said. “From my perspective, there’s two sides to that test: It’s what clubs think about it, and also, what do the players think about it? And we’re gonna have to sort through both of those.” MLB has experimented with ABS systems in two formats in the minor leagues going back to 2019. Some games have seen the robo umps used to call every pitch, while others have used the challenge system about to hit spring training. The challenge system was used full-time in Triple-A, and you can see it applied to end a game here: Upon further review... @GoStripers win it!@Braves prospect Hayden Harris records all of his outs via strikeout to earn the save -- with the final one coming on an ABS challenge: pic.twitter.com/dlnBOvUoOs — Minor League Baseball (@MiLB) September 18, 2024 At one point last year, MLB said teams had a 47% success rate with challenges. Robo umps once felt like a radical change for MLB, but they've become something of an inevitability given how MLB has approached them. Because they've been around the minor leagues for years, an enormous chunk of current major leaguers have experience with the system. It has been a very slow transition for the league, but it appears to almost be over. There will almost certainly be complaints about the system (not every pitch that is technically a strike looks like a strike, and the same with balls), but many fans will take it over a human element that can be infuriating at times.",2024-11-21

The school got a verbal commitment from five-star QB Bryce Underwood on Thursday. The Michigan native is the No. 2 player in the country, according to Rivals, and had previously been committed to LSU. If Underwood signs with Michigan in December’s early signing period or the normal signing period in 2025, he’ll be the school’s highest-ranked recruit since Rashan Gary committed to the Wolverines in 2016. Underwood would also be the first Rivals five-star to sign with the Wolverines since DB Will Johnson in 2022. Johnson has become one of the best defensive backs in college football and is a likely first-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. The verbal commitment from Underwood comes on the same day that Colorado landed a verbal commitment from five-star QB Julian Lewis. He's the No. 6 player in the country and had recently de-committed from USC. Underwood plays for Belleville High School, the same school that currently employs disgraced ex-Michigan staffer Connor Stalions. Yes, really. Stalions has been serving as an assistant for the school after his alleged advance scouting scheme was the storyline of the 2023 college football season. It's the second high school job for Stalions this season. He started the season at Detroit Mumford. The connection with Stalions aside and any role the former staffer may or may not have played in Underwood's recruitment, it's hard to overstate the significance of Underwood's flip for Michigan. The Wolverines have missed out on high-profile in-state QBs in recent years and drastically need a solid quarterback to overhaul the offense under first-year head coach Sherrone Moore. The coach was understandably excited about the news on social media. YES SIR ! #GoBlue🔵 The Best players in Michigan go to Michigan ! #ProcessoverPrize25 — Sherrone Moore (@Coach_SMoore) November 21, 2024 Michigan is just 5-5 with two games to go in the regular season thanks largely to porous QB play. Three different players have started at QB for Michigan this season and they’ve combined to complete less than 60% of their passes and throw nine TDs and nine interceptions. Overall, Michigan QBs are averaging just six yards per passing attempt. If Underwood signs in December, he'll have the opportunity to enroll early at Michigan and participate in spring practices. The only player ranked ahead of Underwood in Rivals' rankings is QB Tavien St. Clair. He has been verbally committed to Michigan's archrival Ohio State since June of 2023. The Buckeyes added two top quarterbacks in the class of 2024 in Air Noland and Julian Sayin.

On Thursday, Charania reported that George has a bone bruise and will miss Philadelphia's next two games. He'll be reevaluated on Monday. The knee is the same knee that caused George to miss the first five games of the season due to a bone bruise from a previous hyperextension. The injury appeared to occur when George landed awkwardly after jumping to defend Grizzlies wing Desmond Bane in the third quarter.

""We think it’s one of the most historic baseballs ever, with the moment of this World Series, the first walk-off grand slam, the whole story of Freddie Freeman, the Dodgers, Game 1, extra innings.

Certainly the Ohtani ball was very, very significant and Ohtani is beloved, but this is more of the history of the game of baseball and just the moment — seeing that happen was just incredible.” Zachary, along with his father and mother Anne, were part of that moment. After Freeman blasted his game-winning shot into the right-field pavilion, the ball rolled next to Zachary's feet. The fifth-grader batted it over to his father, who pounced on it, stood up and handed it back to his son. “They’re just amazing memories,"" Zachary said Thursday, looking back on that night.

The 23-year-old Japanese phenom will immediately become one of the game’s must-see players. Whichever team signs him will have itself a potential frontline starter for the next six seasons. And Sasaki, as talented a young hurler as we’ve ever seen, will get to test his abilities at the highest level. Unfortunately, there’s also a much darker side to the story. And it has very little to do with Sasaki himself. Sasaki, as a non-American, non-Canadian player under the age of 25, will enter stateside baseball as part of international amateur free agency. The international market is an intricate, often unsavory world in which the overwhelming majority of players involved are Latin American teenagers. It is also an incredibly fragile ecosystem, one built upon handshake agreements and verbal promises. That means Sasaki’s entrance into the market has the potential to upend much of the 2025 international signing class, leaving a tornado of mayhem in its wake. There remains a small chance that Sasaki will sign within the 2024 international window, which ends Dec. 15 — that would greatly simplify this process — but commissioner Rob Manfred told reporters Wednesday that he expects Sasaki to sign in the new year. That’s because his Japanese team, the Chiba Lotte Marines, will receive more money by making him available in 2025. But to understand how Sasaki’s MLB arrival could throw the international amateur market into disarray, it’s vital to first understand how the system works. Each year, all 30 MLB teams have a fixed amount of money that they can spend on signing bonuses for international amateur players, known colloquially as the “bonus pool.” The overwhelming majority of those players are Latin American teenagers, but once in a blue moon, a player such as Sasaki or Shohei Ohtani — an established professional from a foreign league who happens to be under the age of 25 — makes the leap and upsets the system. The size of each team’s annual budget depends on (1) a club’s market size and (2) whether the club signed a high-priced free agent who received a qualifying offer in the preceding year. For the upcoming 2025 window, the Dodgers and Giants have the smallest bonus pool size, at $5,146,200, while an octet of teams share the largest sum, at $7,555,500. But while teams cannot officially sign players in the 2025 class until Jan. 15, most amateurs have had verbal agreements in place for years, even though such “early deals” are technically against the rules. In other words, many MLB teams have already allocated their bonus budgets for the upcoming window. Which makes Roki Sasaki — a worthwhile, unexpected cost for the team that signs him — an agent of chaos. Sasaki’s decision to come to MLB now and not two years from now, when he would be a traditional free agent available to the highest bidder, suggests that maxing out his earnings is far from his top priority. The 23-year-old right hander is set to forgo at least $100 million. However, Sasaki isn’t going to sign for free, and there’s certainly a chance that the difference between $2.5 million and $5 million matters in the end. As a result, and because all deals for the 2025 amateur window are, for now, only verbal, a team interested in Sasaki is incentivized to renege or rework any big-ticket agreements currently in place to free up bonus money for the Japanese flamethrower. Here’s a theoretical example. One of the consensus top players in the class is a Dominican shortstop named Elian Peña, who has a verbal agreement with the New York Mets for a bonus north of $4 million. If the Mets think they have a strong chance at Sasaki and believe a few extra million in bonus money could make the difference, they could go to Peña’s representation and try to push down his agreed-upon bonus number. Peña’s reps, who under the current system have little leverage, could do one of two things: accept a reworked deal from the Mets or reopen negotiations with other teams. But while option No. 2 could recoup more money, that money might not be available anywhere. Remember, most teams have already allocated most of their budget. This is where things, according to sources familiar with the international market, could get even more complicated and chaotic. Teams not seriously involved in the Sasaki sweepstakes, knowing that talented amateurs could reenter the market at the last minute, might attempt to renegotiate verbal deals of their own in order to swoop in on those discarded players. That could create a disastrous domino effect in which clubs and players are attempting to rework deals at the 11th hour in a tumultuous, frantic game of musical chairs — all because Sasaki, a pitcher with nearly 400 career innings thrown in the world’s second-best league, somehow falls into the same category as a yet-to-be-paid 16-year-old. Others were skeptical that Sasaki’s arrival would create such a massive ripple effect, citing the importance of maintaining relationships with the trainers and agents who work with most of Latin America’s top amateurs. A team backing out of a deal at the last minute could create lasting discord with one or more of the region’s top power brokers. There’s also a chance that Sasaki, having already left so much money on the table, won’t be overly concerned with his final bonus amount, instead prioritizing the team with which he feels most comfortable. Sources indicated that the order of operations around Sasaki and any cutting of bonuses remains up in the air. It’s unclear whether teams will preemptively renegotiate deals before Jan. 15, the first day signings can be finalized, or wait until the fallout from Sasaki’s signing. But no matter the sequence, it's a near certainty that at least one unfortunate amateur is going to end up with a smaller bonus because of Sasaki’s odd fit within the system. The problem with the entire dynamic is that Sasaki and amateurs seven years his junior are lumped into the same structure. Sasaki will spend the entirety of 2025 in the major leagues; his fellow 2025 signees likely won’t debut until 2030 at the earliest. Sasaki could receive Cy Young votes next year. Most international amateurs will spend 2025 in the Dominican Summer League, the lowest level of professional affiliated baseball. The only other precedent here involves soon-to-be three-time MVP Shohei Ohtani, who made the leap across the Pacific after the 2017 season. But Ohtani’s entrance into the market did not create a whirlwind of chaos in Latin America because (1) his arrival was less of a surprise than Sasaki’s and (2) the signing deadline at the time was in July, not January, meaning Ohtani showed up in the middle of the fiscal year. Even so, Ohtani’s involvement in the international amateur system, a system meant for players of an altogether different type, didn’t make much sense at the time. And since then, that problem has not been fixed. In fact, it has gotten worse. One source called the system “a mess.” Another called it “broken.” Most teams are negotiating with players as young as 12, even though a player must be at least 16 years old on signing day. Some of the amateurs set to sign in the upcoming window verbally agreed to deals as early as spring 2021, around the time that Sasaki debuted in NPB. Yet because of the current international bonus rules, Sasaki’s contract will take money out of someone else’s pocket — which is not at all his fault. It’s like comparing apples and motorcycles. Every team would rather have Sasaki, particularly at such a low price, than any other player available in the 2025 class, and it’s not remotely close. Sasaski is the only proven commodity on offer. As one evaluator put it: “I would much rather sign Sasaki than wait six years to figure out if [a player from the 2025 international class] is good.”",2024-11-21
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Can UConn pull off a historic three-peat? The next three weeks will provide some answers,https://sports.yahoo.com/can-uconn-pull-off-a-historic-three-peat-the-next-three-weeks-will-provide-some-answers-215112738.html,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 21:51:12 GMT",Dan Hurley is trying to run it back with only one returning starter from last year's championship squad.,"Dan Hurley began his postgame news conference this past Tuesday by laying a printout of the box score on the table in front of him and staring at it with disdain. For the next 10 minutes, the UConn men’s basketball coach acted like he couldn’t find a single positive thing to say about a performance he deemed “comically bad.” Rebounding? “So far below our standard,” Hurley moaned. Ball security? “It’s been a long time since we’ve been that bad,” Hurley howled. Defense? “The amount of times we were driven!” Hurley lamented. “No one played well tonight,” Hurley insisted. “You can have bad shooting nights, but you can’t play like that. That’s not acceptable.” If viewers didn’t know better, they would’ve surely assumed UConn lost to East Texas A&M. In reality, the Huskies won by 35. They opened a double-digit lead in the game’s first nine minutes, extended it to 22 by halftime and coasted to an 81-46 rout. Hurley’s scathing assessment of his team’s performance wasn’t merely a product of UConn’s season-high 19 turnovers against East Texas A&M’s switching defense or the 17 offensive rebounds the Huskies surrendered. The infamously hard-to-please coach clearly wanted to refocus the undefeated Huskies right before their schedule gets a whole lot harder. The next three weeks will serve as the ultimate litmus test for whether two-time reigning national champion UConn is capable of a historic three-peat, a feat no men’s college basketball program has achieved since John Wooden’s UCLA dynasty. The second-ranked Huskies (4-0) will likely play six games during that stretch against teams receiving votes in the current AP Top 25. It begins Monday when UConn opens the Maui Invitational against an undefeated Memphis team that has already toppled the likes of Missouri and UNLV. Up next is either unbeaten Colorado or a Michigan State team that recently pushed No. 1 Kansas deep into the second half. Looming on the other side of the Maui bracket are Auburn, North Carolina and Iowa State, all top-10 teams in the AP poll and many computer metrics. The gauntlet continues after a one-game reprieve against Maryland Eastern Shore. On Dec. 4, 13th-ranked Baylor comes to Storrs. Four days later, UConn visits Texas. Then on Dec. 14, in their final game before Big East play, the Huskies travel to New York for a showdown against third-ranked Gonzaga at Madison Square Garden. That stretch will expose where UConn stands in the early season pecking order. Did Hurley assemble another title contender despite only retaining one starter from last season’s 37-win juggernaut? Or did the loss of NBA lottery picks Donovan Clingan and Stephon Castle and fellow draft picks Tristen Newton and Cam Spencer leave too many holes for Hurley to fill? The way Sacred Heart coach Anthony Latina sees it, comparing this year’s UConn team to the previous one is “probably not fair.” That team completed the best two-year run in modern men’s college basketball history by sweeping the Big East regular season and conference tournament titles with startling ease and laying waste to six straight NCAA tournament opponents by at least 14 points apiece. “That was probably one of the best teams certainly in the last 20 years and maybe in the history of college basketball,” Latina told reporters after UConn trounced his team 92-56 earlier this month. This year’s Huskies aren’t quite as sublimely talented, according to Latina, but they’re still “an elite team” and “going to be right there.” “Are they going to win every NCAA tournament game by double digits?” Latina said. “I think that’s asking too much, but this is a legitimate top-five team, a legitimate Final Four contender, no question.” Le Moyne assistant coach Ben Swank also came away impressed after UConn demolished the Dolphins 90-49 earlier this month. When his teams face a high-major program, Swank is used to marveling at the opposing players’ size, strength and athleticism. UConn had all that, Swank said, plus the Huskies to a man were also highly skilled. “That was a big eye opener to me,” Swank told Yahoo Sports. That’s how you could tell, OK, this is a top-tier program in the country. This just isn't just any high major out there.” The return of Hurley and versatile forward Alex Karaban are the two biggest reasons UConn can dare to dream of a three-peat. Hurley swatted aside the chance to become Kentucky’s next men’s basketball coach and passed on the Los Angeles Lakers job after a whirlwind courtship. Karaban might have come off the board as early as the late first round and almost certainly would have been the fifth UConn player selected had he remained in last June’s NBA Draft. On offense, Karaban has gone from complementary piece to focal point without sacrificing any of his trademark efficiency. The 6-foot-8 junior is scoring a team-high 16.3 points per game by knocking down spot-up jumpers, attacking close-outs and staying active on the offensive glass. If anything, UConn needs Karaban to get more aggressive hunting shots because 8.3 field goal attempts per game isn’t enough. On defense, Karaban is UConn’s vocal leader and most dependable on-ball and help defender. He has even blocked 13 shots already this season, a product of his positional size, anticipation, motor and knack for sliding his feet to stay in front of his man. “He’s a very high-IQ, very high-level player,” said Swank, who put together his program’s defensive game plan against UConn. “He’s going to find ways to score the ball. You try to guard some screens this way or that way, and he’s really good at reading it and putting himself in a great position.” For this UConn team to accomplish what the previous two have, Hurley needs his returning role players to shoulder more responsibility and some of his prized newcomers to make an instant impact. Already, sophomore guard Solomon Ball has validated preseason projections that he’d produce a breakout season, freshman Liam McNeeley has lived up to his reputation as a skilled 6-foot-7 shotmaker and sophomore Jayden Ross has flashed immense potential. Questions remain, however, at the five spot and at point guard. Can the combination of transfer Tarris Reed Jr. and career role player Samson Johnson come close to duplicating the interior scoring and rim protection that Clingan provided last season? And can either fifth-year senior Hassan Diarra or Saint Mary’s transfer Aidan Mahaney evolve into a Newton-esque point guard capable of initiating the offense and making shrewd decisions with the ball in their hands? The lack of a point guard who can consistently get in the paint and make plays for others is generally regarded as UConn’s most glaring weakness, but Swank argued that’s selling Diarra and Mahaney short. Diarra, Swank said, is “unbelievably solid and composed” and “did a little bit of everything well” against LeMoyne. Mahaney has come out of the blocks slowly, Swank admitted, but the LeMoyne assistant suspects he just needs more time to adjust to his new teammates. “One that Mahaney has lacked is a scoring threat going to the rim,” Swank said. “I know he missed one or two easier ones against us. I think that will come once he gets a feel for his team, but that’s something he could definitely do better.” Until last year, only two men’s college basketball programs had won back-to-back national titles since Wooden’s heyday at UCLA that ran into the early 1970s: Florida in 2006 and 2007 and Duke in 1991 and 1992. All five Florida starters bypassed the NBA Draft to return to chase a second championship. Christian Laettner, Bobby Hurley and Grant Hill were among the four Duke starters who did the same. What UConn accomplished last season was an even more audacious feat. Hurley didn’t have the luxury of bringing his team back intact in a quest for a repeat. Five of his first title team’s top eight players moved on after the Huskies ripped through the 2023 NCAA tournament. Now Hurley is again trying to reload on the fly — and again his greatest enemies are bad habits and complacency. He’ll twist himself into knots seeking ways to motivate his team, even after a 35-point home victory in the fourth game of the season. “Once we got up 37 with 12 minutes to go, it turned into just a debacle out there,” Hurley groused. Message delivered. Loud and clear.",2024-11-21

The guys start with the big number, which is 826 this week. That's the number of 3-point shots LeBron James has made since joining the Lakers. If you don't think that's a lot, tune in to hear which Hall of Fame players never made that many 3-point shots in their entire career. But it's the efficiency of LeBron's season that has really caught the eye of both Tom and Dan. He is currently posting career highs in points created per 36, points scored on plays where LeBron is in the pick-and-roll and percentage of his baskets that are assisted. The success of the 10-4 Lakers, as well as the success of rookie forward Dalton Knecht, can be directly attributed to the increased efficiency and proficiency of LeBron James, who turns 40 in about six weeks. That's crazy. Is there a case to be made that he's having his most impressive season? Finally, Tom wrote a piece for Yahoo Sports wondering if making dunks worth three points would shift the NBA back to offensive diversity and away from every team trying to copy the Boston Celtics. He talks it out with Dan to see if it would be viable and, if not, what other plans might make sense.

According to ESPN, Miller is being investigated for potentially betting on Temple games in which he played. At the end of last season, Temple games had been flagged for unusual wagering activity. From ESPN: Temple spokesperson Steve Orbanek told ESPN that the school is ""aware of the deeply concerning allegations of sports wagering last season."" He said the university had not ""received any requests for information"" from state or federal law enforcement but ""will cooperate fully should we be contacted."" The NCAA declined to comment. In a statement, the FBI said it would neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation. In early March, U.S. Integrity said there was notable line movement ahead of Temple’s game against UAB. The line moved five points in the Blazers’ direction and they closed as 7.5-point favorites. UAB covered the spread easily in a 100-72 win. That flag by the gambling service came after it had been reportedly monitoring Temple games for “a while.” In Temple’s game before it played UAB, the line quickly moved in Tulsa’s favor. Tulsa beat Temple by five points in that contest. Miller played three seasons at Temple and was the team’s leading scorer in 2023-24. The Owls were just 5-13 in conference play but won four games in the AAC tournament as part of a remarkable run led by Miller’s scoring outburst. The Owls took down UTSA, SMU, Charlotte and Florida Atlantic to get to the AAC title game. There, the Owls lost to UAB again, 85-69, and failed to make the NCAA tournament. He left the program after the season and transferred to Virginia Tech. However, Miller left Virginia Tech on Oct. 23 before the 2024-25 season began.",2024-11-21

The weekend features three games between ranked teams and one of those contests is in the Big 12. No one will mistake the Big 12 for an elite conference this season, but it's been extremely fun and extremely even. Nine teams are still mathematically alive for the conference title. If you love chaos, you want some upsets over the final two weeks of the season. BYU and Colorado are tied atop the conference at 6-1 and both head on the road in Week 13. The Cougars are underdogs at third-place Arizona State, while Colorado is a slight favorite at a Kansas team that just ended BYU's undefeated season. Here's a look at what to watch in Week 13. (All times are Eastern and all odds are from BetMGM.) Time: Noon | TV: Fox | Line: Ohio State -13.5 | Total: 51.5 Here’s Indiana’s big test. The College Football Playoff discussion has been unfairly dominated by Indiana’s undefeated record against the teams on its schedule. The Hoosiers had a weak non-conference slate and, well, a weak Big Ten conference schedule too. Either Michigan or Washington is the best team the Hoosiers have beaten this season. That conference schedule isn’t Indiana’s fault. And the Hoosiers haven’t scheduled non-conference games like a team needing to post its schedule strength for the College Football Playoff because, well, they haven’t been in playoff contention. After years of being in the same division as Ohio State, Michigan and Penn State, we think the Hoosiers deserved a season where they didn’t have to play all three teams. Indiana is powered by an efficient passing offense led by fringe Heisman contender Kurtis Rourke and a defense that’s forcing nearly two turnovers per game. DB Amare Ferrell has four interceptions while defensive lineman Mikail Kamara has 9.5 sacks. Ohio State enters the game down two starting offensive linemen following center Seth McLaughlin’s torn Achilles on Tuesday. The Buckeyes have done a fantastic job moving pieces around on the offensive line following left tackle Josh Simmons’ injury. Can they adequately replace the Alabama transfer too? The Buckeyes are giving up the fewest points per game of any team in college football after allowing just seven points over their last two games. Only Oregon has scored more than 17 points against Ohio State all season. Indiana’s going to need to score more than 17 to win. Time: 3:30 p.m. | TV: Fox | Line: Colorado -3 | Total: 59.5 The Buffaloes carry a four-game win streak into Arrowhead Stadium to face a team that just ruined BYU’s undefeated season. Colorado has scored at least 34 points in each of those wins as Shedeur Sanders is playing like one of the best quarterbacks in the country. Sanders is completing 73% of his passes and has already thrown for over 3,200 yards. If Colorado makes the Big 12 title game, he’s got a great chance to throw for over 4,000 yards before the postseason. It’s a good thing that Sanders is picking opposing defenses apart, because Colorado still can’t run the football. The Buffaloes average just 77 yards per game on the ground as Isaiah Augustave is the team’s leading rusher with 362 yards and four touchdowns. Kansas isn’t far from being a team with a winning record. The win over BYU was KU’s sixth one-possession game and just the first one the team has won this season. The Jayhawks held BYU to just one TD as the Cougars turned the ball over twice. QB Jalon Daniels has played better as Kansas has won three of its last four games. But the key to another upset could be RB Devin Neal. Opponents had rushed for more than 100 yards in every game against Colorado until Utah could only put up 31 in Week 12. Time: 3:30 p.m. | TV: ESPN | Line: Arizona State -3 | Total: 48.5 It’s time to start paying attention to Arizona State if you haven’t been. The Sun Devils are fresh off a win at Kansas State and have won three straight games since a loss at Cincinnati led coach Kenny Dillingham to call for open tryouts at kicker. The Sun Devils are led by RB Cam Skattebo. He’s rushed 198 times for 1,098 yards and 11 TDs and has also added 31 catches for 448 yards and two scores. In addition to being ASU’s leading rusher, he’s also the team’s second-leading receiver behind Jordyn Tyson. Michigan State transfer Sam Leavitt has thrived after taking over for Jeff Sims at QB. He’s averaging 4.5 yards a carry and has 21 total TDs in nine games. Eight defensive players have tallied an interception so far this season, as safety Myles Rowser leads the team in tackles. A win likely puts Arizona State a victory away from the Big 12 title game too. BYU’s path to the Big 12 title game simply lost its margin for error with the defeat to Kansas. The Cougars are in the championship game with two more wins. But it’s easy to wonder if the luck ran out against Kansas. The Cougars have been the inverse of the Jayhawks so far this season. That Week 12 game was BYU’s fifth one-score game of the season and just the Cougars’ first loss. The BYU offense needs to do a better job of scoring TDs against Arizona State. The Cougars had scored at last 34 points in six straight games before its 22-21 win over Utah. And now BYU has scored just 35 points combined in its last two games. Time: 7 p.m. | TV: NBC | Line: Notre Dame -14.5 | Total: 44.5 How long can Army hang around with Notre Dame? The Black Knights’ triple-option offense is not built to post a quick comeback. Just ask Navy. The Midshipmen were buried by turnovers in the first half of their game against the Fighting Irish earlier this season and had no chance of a comeback. QB Bryson Daily leads the team with 174 carries for 1,062 yards and 21 scores, while RB Kanye Udoh has 856 rushing yards and nine TDs. Watch out for RB Noah Short as a big-play receiving threat too. He has 11 catches for 259 yards and three TDs. Army gives up just over 10 points per game, though the Black Knights have also played a very manageable schedule. Before Notre Dame, the toughest opponent for Army has been East Carolina. That game came before ECU fired coach Mike Houston and reeled off three straight wins to get bowl eligible. Notre Dame is also stingy on defense. As Ohio State ranks first in scoring defense and Army is second, Notre Dame is third at 11.4 points per contest. So the under may be a good play. Possessions will be at a premium as Notre Dame’s offense is also heavily run-based. The Irish are averaging six yards a carry so far this season compared to QB Riley Leonard’s 6.9 yards a pass attempt. Leonard has been a much better passer over the second half of the season, but the offense is powered by his legs along with RBs Jeremiyah Love and Jadarian Price. Time: 7:30 p.m. | TV: ESPN | Line: Texas A&M -2.5 | Total: 46.5 Maybe this is the week that Auburn puts a complete game together against a good SEC opponent. Oddsmakers certainly think there’s a chance of that happening. The Tigers are 1-5 in the SEC this season and need to beat both Texas A&M and Alabama to make a bowl game. Auburn is averaging nearly two turnovers per game, though the mistakes have abated in recent weeks. After two five-turnover games in the first four weeks of the season, the Tigers haven’t turned the ball over more than once since. But Auburn is still minus-11 in turnover margin for the season thanks to a defense that has failed to force a turnover in six games so far this season. Yet when the defense shows up, the offense can’t do its job. Just look at the Vanderbilt game. Auburn held Diego Pavia to 9-of-23 passing for 143 yards and 227 yards overall, yet the Commodores won 17-7. Marcel Reed is still the starting QB for the Aggies since taking over for Conner Weigman against LSU. He threw for two TDs and rushed for another a week ago against New Mexico State. A&M is tied with Texas atop the SEC and needs the win to make next week’s rivalry game a semifinal for the SEC title game. If both Texas and Texas A&M win on Saturday, the winner of the regular-season finale is guaranteed a spot in the conference championship. No. 9 Ole Miss at Florida (Noon, ABC): Florida is a win away from bowl eligibility, while Ole Miss needs to win its final two games to likely qualify for the College Football Playoff. The Gators upset LSU at home a week ago, though freshman QB DJ Lagway could be haunted by the Ole Miss pass rush given his lack of mobility because of his hamstring injury. No. 13 SMU at Virginia (Noon, ESPN2): Like Florida, Virginia needs one more win to qualify for the postseason and hosts a team that has playoff hopes of its own. The Mustangs can clinch a spot in the ACC title game with a win thanks to Clemson’s loss to Louisville earlier this season. No. 4 Penn State at Minnesota (3:30 p.m., CBS): Are the Nittany Lions going to be on upset alert? They’re two-score favorites, but Minnesota is good to muck up a game or two and we wouldn’t be surprised if this one is bit closer than expected. Penn State needs to win its final two games and get a lot of help to advance to the Big Ten title game. No. 12 Boise State at Wyoming (7 p.m., CBSSN): Boise State is a big favorite in this one. We only have it in this category to remind you that Ashton Jeanty has a great chance of surpassing the 2,000-yard mark on Saturday night. A four-TD night would also give Jeanty 30 rushing TDs for the season.",2024-11-21

The defensive back and wide receiver put the obvious on the record in a news conference with reporters on Thursday and said that the 2024 college football season would be his last before entering the NFL Draft. Hunter is a possible top-five pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. “That’s definitely for sure,” Hunter said when asked about the 2025 draft. Hunter is the prohibitive favorite for the Heisman Trophy with two weeks to go in the regular season. His odds are -400 at BetMGM. Boise State RB Ashton Jeanty is the No. 2 favorite at +400. Hunter also said that he believed he could be a two-way player in the NFL like he is in college football and said that “nobody has stopped me from doing it thus far.” What Hunter is doing is unprecedented in modern college football and would be unprecedented in the modern NFL. He has 74 catches for 911 yards and 10 total TDs despite missing a half in two of Colorado’s 10 games so far this season. He also has 24 tackles and three interceptions to go along with eight passes defensed. Hunter has surpassed the numbers he put up over nine games in his first season at the top level of college football. Hunter arrived at Colorado ahead of the 2023 season from Jackson State when Deion Sanders took the Buffaloes job. As a sophomore last season, Hunter had 57 catches for 721 yards and five TDs while recording 30 tackles. He was named a first-team All-American as an all-purpose player and is assuredly going to be an All-American again in 2024. Hunter’s excellence has helped put Colorado in the mix for the Big 12 title. If the Buffaloes win their final two games of the season against Kansas and Oklahoma State, they will play in the Big 12 title game. A win in the Big 12 championship would give Colorado an automatic bid to the College Football Playoff.",2024-11-21

Once upon a time, this was the most famous rivalry in the land, a war that bewitched the entire country. Americans waited anxiously for newspapers, gathered around radios, stared into the glow of massive early television sets to learn which of these titans would claim the year’s finest, most important game. Army-Notre Dame inspired both the greatest lede in the history of sports journalism — Grantland Rice’s “Outlined against a blue-gray October sky, the Four Horsemen rode again” — and the greatest pregame speech in sports history, Knute Rockne’s “Win one for the Gipper” plea. It’s the wellspring of sports as myth, of coaches as stern but loving father figures and players as doomed or exalted heroes. So it’s somehow perfect, narratively speaking, that this rivalry, which has fallen so far from its 20th-century heights, could once again alter the trajectory of an entire sport. The business of college football today would be unrecognizable to Rockne, Red Blaik, Ara Parseghian and other legends of the Notre Dame-Army rivalry, but the primary focus — size up that man on the other side of the line, beat him and let the cards fall where they may — would be warmly familiar. Army and Notre Dame claimed 16 national championships in the 20th century, including seven in the 1940s alone (technically six, since they share 1946). They’ve fallen far since then; Army’s last title season was in 1946, and Notre Dame’s was in 1988. The Irish have fought their way back to prominence since then, using limitless resources, a de facto personal broadcast network and a nationwide recruiting footprint. The far more interesting transformation is happening in West Point, where Army is in the midst of making history on multiple fronts. The 9-0 Black Knights are one win away from just the fourth double-digit win in the entire 131-year history of the program. You have to go all the way back to 1958 to find Army’s last undefeated season. Aside from one seven-year stint in Conference USA around the turn of the millennium, Army has been a proud Independent until this year, when it stomped into the AAC and took control of the joint. The miracle here is how Army has put itself into this position despite not being able to take advantage of college football’s two earth-shattering weapons: NIL and the transfer portal. The Army doesn’t permit its players to take NIL money, and one doesn’t just parachute into West Point for a single mercenary season. But it’s not hard to see how Army’s old-school ethos is a counterintuitive benefit. While other AAC schools were getting raided for their best talent, or trying to slap together a crew of one-off bounty hunters, Army is building a team. (Yes, this sounds like a commercial. That doesn’t make it any less true.) Quarterback Bryson Daily, for instance, played exactly one game as a freshman and didn’t throw a pass. He played five as a sophomore, and scored two touchdowns on 12 rushing attempts. He took over the starting job as a junior, and now, as a senior, leads all FBS quarterbacks in rushing yards and ranks second in rushing touchdowns with 21. That’s the kind of wait-your-turn, be-ready-when-called mindset that the portal and NIL have already devastated across the country. As Florida State has demonstrated to chilling effect, it’s not enough to bring in a bunch of starred recruits, toss them a ball and expect them to win games. Team cohesion helps, too, the kind of cohesion you get from living, eating, practicing and bleeding together for three or four seasons. NIL can paper over a lot of college football’s sins, but it can’t replace that. Army beats its opponents by grinding them into dust, holding the ball for massive chunks of the game and using opportunistic turnovers and a conservative, ball-control offense to own the tempo. It’s a way to defeat a physically superior opponent; stay in the conversation long enough and you can take control of it … both in the game and in the season. Granted, despite its unblemished record, Army’s strength of schedule is a real concern. The Black Knights rank 19th in the current CFP standings, behind a raft of one-, two- and three-loss teams. The SEC and Big Ten can squabble about who’s the better conference; no such debates exist with the AAC. That’s what makes this weekend’s Notre Dame rematch so compelling, and so crucial. Army now has the chance to upend the entire playoff structure. All it has to do is overcome a projected 14.5-point spread and break a 15-game losing streak that dates back to 1958. But if Army can manage that, everything opens up — a new Group of Five team works its way into the playoff conversation, and the Irish are either out of the mix entirely or trying to justify their way in over a fellow two-loss SEC squad. And once the playoff begins, who knows what could happen next? We’re in uncharted territory here. Sure, Army-Notre Dame might not ever return to its glory days when it determined the fate of the college football universe. But it’s back to being a crucial, must-watch matchup, and that’s one of so many elements of this season that’s worth celebrating.",2024-11-21

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",'I'm in a good spot': Bulls' Zach LaVine is turning some heads amid trade rumors,https://sports.yahoo.com/im-in-a-good-spot-bulls-zach-lavine-is-turning-some-heads-amid-trade-rumors-180518432.html,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:05:18 GMT",The Bulls star is reminding the NBA world of what he can do when healthy.,"DETROIT — It was almost as if Zach LaVine was playing possum, watching teammate Nikola Vučević feast on a lax Pistons defense — and then, he exploded. It was one triple in the fourth, then another, and another, and another. You could see it in his gait, the light steps, the easy release. The only ones who didn’t seem to notice LaVine on a heater were the Pistons, who were trying to reach the benchmark of .500, as a true show of progress. Only LaVine ruthlessly snatched it away with six 3-pointers in the fourth quarter of the Bulls’ 122-112 win at Little Casears Arena on Monday night. He had only seven points entering the fourth, but exploded for 18, finishing with 25. After playing just 25 games last year before right foot surgery ended his season in February, the discussion surrounding LaVine was more about his max contract, trade rumors and his rocky relationship with coach Billy Donovan. In fact, it was about everything but his game, and it didn’t go unnoticed. “I heard everything,” LaVine told Yahoo Sports on Monday. “I read everything. Sometimes you gotta take that accountability and put a chip on your shoulder. There’s a lot of things people said I had to prove. I think my resume speaks for itself, the type of player I am, the type of person I am, but it is what it is. “You can always turn some heads.” LaVine smiles easy and jumps even easier, even after multiple operations that would’ve sapped the athleticism of most players. But there is an edge to him this season. He’s playing with more force while also working within the scheme of Donovan’s guard-heavy roster. Always efficient, LaVine is playing above his usual numbers, shooting 51% from the field and 43% from 3-point range (both career highs) on over seven 3-point attempts a night, and averaging 22 points, 5.2 rebounds and 4.2 assists. In this luxury-tax-apron world, where teams have seemingly put themselves in worse positions in terms of player movement, every dollar is counted. So conversations surrounding acquiring LaVine often start with the five-year, $215 million deal he signed in the summer of 2022. And when players are injured, it’s easy to forget how good they are, or can be when active. “I don’t know,” LaVine said. “It’s not for me to try to make everybody like me. I’m happy for what I got, what I deserved. And some people may not feel that way and you may judge it off that. But regardless, I know who I am and what I’ve done in this league.” It’s no secret the Bulls were shopping LaVine the past couple of years, and as time moves on with his deal, there’s no doubt a better market will form if the franchise wants to reengage. After next season, he’ll have a player option in 2026-27 for $48 million, and he can hit free agency again at 32 years old. But for now, he’s a bright spot on an up-and-down Bulls team. He came into training camp about 10 pounds lighter, ostensibly to take pressure off his knees. He spent the summer training at The Box training center in Costa Mesa, California, where he learned, “You don’t play boxing.” He sparred with Jesús Soto Karass, a former welterweight and junior middleweight boxer from Mexico. “I got in the ring with him and I jabbed him one time too hard during one of our sparring sessions, and he beat my ass,” LaVine said with a full laugh. “If I’m ever in the wrong situation, I can defend myself, but you don’t play boxing with those dudes.” It served its purpose, though, as he looks healthier and still bouncy — ready to take over those fourth quarters again. He’s a long way away from the two-time dunk champion; he’s a more complete player on both ends, picking his spots until he can put a stamp on games. “I’m in a good place and I feel sharp right now,” LaVine said. “Being able to be one of the veteran guys on the team and still being able to do what I do. Help win in any way I can. Defense one day, facilitating, whatever they call for.” The occasional defensive lapses don’t come as often, and even though he hasn’t advanced past the first round of the postseason in his career, it’s been more a failure in team building than in LaVine’s personal exploits. [Why Josh Giddey is a power forward, not a point guard] The one time the Bulls had real hope over the past six or seven years was the short-lived period when LaVine and DeMar DeRozan could terrorize opponents, buoyed by a healthy Lonzo Ball. LaVine ceded space for DeRozan to take over fourth quarters and the two worked together easily. DeRozan had numerous game-winners, and LaVine, as the better deep shooter, could play that role. Both were All-Stars in 2022, the only year all three were healthy going into the season. “I had plenty of games where I’ve had to take over, but the respect you give DeMar, you don’t want to take away from what he does best,” LaVine said. “I had to take a step back off the ball because you don’t put DeMar in the corner. It’s not gonna be what’s best for him or the team. I can play off the ball. “I’ve seen how DeMar plays in the fourth and how he calms down. And just for me, a learning experience. I tip my hat to DeMar, I love DeMar, but there’s a lot of work I put into this, too.” It goes back to the good place he spoke of. The self-awareness about where he is, his contract, his standing in the league. He doesn’t seem stressed about the situation in Chicago, the future. LaVine is also relishing the opportunity to show how his game has grown, and how it applies in a winning situation. One can assume a handful of teams are watching. “I’ve gone through ups and downs with that,” LaVine said. “I've had some really good, good games, and years. I've had some times where I've had some turnovers and some bad games. And I think that's all with the experience of being in the NBA. “I'm in a good spot and understanding what the game means for me at the time, and how to try to contribute to winning.”",2024-11-21
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Fantasy Football Week 12 Fades: Is a Matthew Stafford trap game on the horizon?,https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy-football-week-12-fades-is-a-matthew-stafford-trap-game-on-the-horizon-182338736.html,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:23:38 GMT",Beware of these six players with bust potential in Week 12!,"Another week, another round of crucially important start/sit decisions. To help you make them, here's a look at six players with bust potential in Week 12. Something to keep in mind as you're reading: a ""fade"" or ""bust"" designation doesn't automatically mean you should sit a player, depending on the depth of the rest of your roster or available options on your waiver wire. It's really difficult to imagine fading a fantasy quarterback throwing to Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua on any given week — especially in what could be a high-scoring matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles with plenty of offensive firepower on both sidelines. However, this feels like the ultimate trap game ... in particular for Rams QB Matthew Stafford. Stafford is coming off his best fantasy performance of the season in Week 11, going 18-of-27 for 295 passing yards and 4 TDs against the New England Patriots, resulting in 27.8 fantasy points as the overall QB5 on the week. While it would appear that a matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles could be intriguing at first glance, it bears repeating that this Eagles secondary is not the same as it was last year. The unit that ranked top-three in net passing yards per game (255.7) and second-most passing TDs all season (38) is no more; it's the Reed Blankenship, Cooper DeJean and Quinyon Mitchell show now. Joining Darius Slay and C.J. Gardner-Johnson in the secondary, this group of defensive backs has been massively underrated, allowing the second-fewest pass yards per game (172.2), a league-low 5.0 yards per pass attempt and tied for the third-fewest passing touchdowns all season (9). Heat check 🔥 Unless you're in a two-QB or Superflex league, Stafford is better left on fantasy benches this week, even despite an intriguing 49.5-point projected total from oddsmakers this week. Carolina Panthers RB Chuba Hubbard has had a standout season in 2024 and was handsomely rewarded for his production (on one of the league's worst offenses, mind you) with a nice, big contract extension. He showed he was worth it in the game immediately following, too, posting 169 scrimmage yards and a score in Week 10 ahead of their bye. Despite his recent dominance this season, there are two glaring reasons to suspect Hubbard won't keep up the path of production. The first of those reasons is the matchup; this week, the Panthers will face the Kansas City Chiefs, who have been among the most prolific run defenses this year, holding opposing RBs to a league-low 3.11 yards per carry and giving up a league-low 522 rushing yards over 10 games. Their 12.82 fantasy points per game allowed to the position ranks dead last in the league. Paired with the difficult matchup on deck is the planned debut for second-round rookie RB Jonathon Brooks, who will play in his first NFL game coming off a torn ACL which has held him out so far this year. It doesn't seem likely that he'll hold a significant role in Week 12, but any chunk of the pie he gets is a piece off Hubbard's plate. Heat check 🔥 You'll likely be in a position where you need to start Hubbard given the six teams that are on a bye this week. However, it's best to expect something closer to an RB3/RB4 performance from him, rather than his standard top-12 finish, even if Brooks does handle a minimal role. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. The Chicago Bears have undergone a significant shift over the past two weeks, firing former OC Shane Waldron and promoting passing coordinator Thomas Brown to call plays in the meantime. In Brown's first game calling plays, the offense managed its highest yardage total (391) since October 6's win over the Carolina Panthers — that's the good news. Usually, that would mean exciting things for the run game, but there's another side to that coin (the bad news). In Week 12, the Bears will get a matchup with the Minnesota Vikings, a matchup that has ranked among the league's most stifling this season. The Vikings defense is allowing the second-lowest YPC average (3.6), second-fewest rush yards after contact per attempt (2.4) and the third-lowest explosive run rate (9.3%) this season, giving up the second-least fantasy points per game to opposing RBs (14.54). Another interesting tidbit worth noting in terms of Swift's upside in the week to come is an increase in workload for backup RB Roschon Johnson last week. He saw a season-high offensive snap rate of 42% and earned a season-high 11 touches. The fact that this bump in usage coincided with the coaching shift is intriguing. Plus Swift is dealing with a groin injury that forced him out of practice Wednesday, though HC Matt Eberflus says he's hopeful he'll play. Heat check 🔥 Swift should be started in most leagues, barring much better options, as he's exhibited a fairly safe floor dating back to Week 4, with 10+ fantasy points in all but one game since then. However, a challenging matchup paired with an uptick in work for Johnson last week makes Swift less appealing than usual. We're fading the passer this week, so why not fade his top target? As noted above, the Philadelphia Eagles have had a sneaky-good passing defense since Cooper DeJean took over a near-full-time role in Week 6. Though he plays primarily slot corner, his presence has virtually transformed the secondary into a shutdown unit. Since Week 6, here's a look at the performance of the Eagles' secondary against targets to WRs lined up out wide and where it ranks among other defenses per Next Gen Stats: 36.8% passing success rate (league-low) 45.4 NFL passer rating (league-low) 45.6% completion rate (league-low) -0.15 EPA per dropback (second-lowest) 273 yards (third-fewest) The Eagles' secondary is also the only team to not allow a single touchdown to WRs lined up out wide in that span. Given that Nacua primarily plays along the boundary (74% snap rate this season) while teammate Cooper Kupp mans the slot at a 69% snap rate, there are realistic concerns that he could have an inefficient day. Heat check 🔥 Under no circumstances do you bench Nacua; he's a star with absurd play strength and does benefit from lining up alongside Kupp, which could help split coverage against this stingy Eagles' secondary. However, if this is the week you need a monster game, brace yourself for a potential disappointment. The DeVonta Smith experience has had its ups and downs in the 2024 season; he's averaging a career-high 74.5% catch rate with career-high slot usage (52.9% compared to his previous career-high of 31.1%). While that seems to have raised his overall floor for fantasy, having managed 64 or more receiving yards in six of nine games this year, it does seem as though his upside has been capped, yet to surpass the 90-receiving yard mark in any given game. In Week 12, he'll face the Los Angeles Rams in a sneakily challenging matchup against WRs lined up in the slot, which could mean another so-so performance for fantasy managers. Dating back to Week 6, the Rams are allowing a league-low 29% success rate on targets to WRs per NFL Next Gen Stats, giving up a 41.4 NFL passer rating (45.2% completion rate) and a ridiculous 1:5 TD:INT ratio on such plays. Heat check 🔥 As I've noted a few times in this article, this feels like more of a trap game for fantasy managers than it does the barn-burner we're all hoping for given the firepower of these respective offenses. Given Smith's lack of ceiling this year paired with a challenging matchup, Smith isn't a must-start in Week 12 if you have better options. If you do have to start him on a week full of byes, do so with tempered expectations. There was a point earlier this season (right around Weeks 4-8) where many suspected they'd found the answer to their tight end woes in second-year Packer Tucker Kraft. Unfortunately, his level of consistency as a red-zone weapon has tapered off in recent weeks, failing to produce a single catch in Week 11 coming off Green Bay's bye. Just in case you were holding out hope for a bounce-back performance, however, it doesn't seem likely to come up against the San Francisco 49ers in Week 12, even if they do layup some designed touches for him one week out from his goose egg. The 49ers have been a challenging matchup for opposing tight ends this season, failing to allow a single TE more than 10 fantasy points in a single matchup, giving up the second-lowest Y/A average on targets to the position in the league (5.5), only behind the Houston Texans. Their 44.6% success rate on pass attempts targeting TEs ranks fourth-lowest in the league, per Next Gen Stats, allowing just 356 yards (fourth-fewest) and 2 TDs (tied for ninth-fewest) to the position all season. Heat check 🔥 There's an expectation for a certain level of volatility every time you roll out a Packers pass catcher, but given the Niners' strengths over the middle of the field and history of shutting down more-than-capable TEs this season, Kraft is better left on your bench. Consider a streaming option like rookie Ja'Tavion Sanders, who has a favorable matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs this week.",2024-11-21
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",'From star-taking to star-making': How LA Galaxy returned to the top by shunning big names,https://sports.yahoo.com/from-star-taking-to-star-making-how-la-galaxy-returned-to-the-top-by-shunning-big-names-180026540.html,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:00:26 GMT","The Galaxy's resurgence is undeniable, but their ultimate validation awaits.","The juxtaposition, in January 2021, was stark. When Greg Vanney returned to Major League Soccer’s winningest franchise, the LA Galaxy, as head coach, he’d walk past statues and stocked trophy cases, into a club that seemed stuck in the past. “There wasn't really a scouting department,” Vanney said he remembers. The “sports science department … was one guy's computer.” And the result was that the kings of MLS 2.0 were getting left behind. The Galaxy once ruled this fledgling league. They transformed it with celebrity. They elevated it with spending. They became its most recognizable brand. And they won. A lot. They reached nine of the first 19 MLS Cup finals. They won five. They were the envy of the league, a destination for marketable stars, until MLS began to evolve. As its soccer got more sophisticated; and as its operations professionalized; and as club owners and sporting directors alike realized that the way to attract fans was with on-field quality more so than big-name stars, the Galaxy, for years, failed to evolve with it. And so, for nearly a decade, the Galaxy fell from their throne. Since their 2014 title, they have not advanced past the MLS quarterfinals; they missed the playoffs five times in seven years; they have not lifted a trophy of any kind. They also violated roster rules. Their transfer business often felt unscientific or chaotic. By 2023, their most loyal fans had had enough. Prominent supporters groups began boycotting home games. Attendance dipped. Losses accumulated. The external discontent, Vanney admits, began affecting the humans inside the club. That, in a nutshell, was the environment that Will Kuntz walked into last spring. His task, as senior vice president of player personnel and now general manager, was to revive this stumbling giant. And a “major” part of his plan — the plan that pushed the Galaxy back toward the top of the Western Conference, into a home quarterfinal vs. Minnesota on Sunday (6 p.m. ET, FS1) — was to shed the club’s superficial identity, to “care less about who a player is, in terms of pedigree.” “We wanted to shift away from star-taking,” Kuntz says, “to star-making.” The 29-year history of Los Angeles’ lone MLS original is littered with names you probably know. First, there were domestic stars, such as Cobi Jones and Landon Donovan. Then, there was David Beckham — and Robbie Keane, Steven Gerrard, Ashley Cole, Giovani dos Santos, Jonathan dos Santos, Chicharito and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. One would leave, another would arrive, because, well, why not? The Designated Player rule allows clubs to spend limitlessly on three stars. Who wouldn’t want well-known ones with experience at the tippy-top of the sport? Somewhere along the way, the why seemed to drift out of front-office equations. Or, perhaps, the equations strayed too far away from soccer. “There was a belief that, like, getting these big European stars was part of our ethos, and part of our culture, part of who we are,” Kuntz says. He saw it differently: “I think that's a byproduct of who we are, and why we won, but it's not really what is core to the Galaxy. What the Galaxy are really about is winning, being the flagship franchise of MLS, and representing the city of Los Angeles with a dynamic, fun-to-watch team. “And you can do that with really high-end international players at the end of their career,” he clarifies. “But that's not the most important thing.” This was his pitch to ownership as he took the job last spring, jumping from crosstown rival LAFC. This was the pitch as he approached his first offseason with two DP slots vacant. To fill them, he’d ask a single question: “How good is the player? What is he gonna bring to the group?” “It's really liberating,” he says, to be focused on only that one thing. And to answer the question, he relied on a scouting system and recruitment process that he, Vanney and others had been building and refining for years. When the head coach arrived in 2021, “a lot of scouting was done through relationships, connections,” and the occasional road trip. “It wasn't a robust system,” Vanney says. It lagged behind most other MLS clubs, who’ve been integrating data, full-time scouts stationed on other continents, and video. “So,” Vanney says, “our initial rebuild of the team wasn't done in a lot of advanced scouting. … It was like, ‘We need some players with speed, we need certain qualities to add to this team ... What's out there, and what can we get? What can we afford? Who's ready to move?’” Simultaneously, though, the club began to construct a scouting department. They crafted player profiles. They built and maintained shortlists of targets, position by position. “We started to get more proactive,” Vanney says. They stopped chasing big names or quick fixes, and instead developed a longer-term plan — which they stuck to last year, despite a rash of injuries and a 26th-place finish. Then, last winter, they dipped into the shortlists. And rather than look to soccer celebrities, they looked to Belgium, where they’d identified Ghanaian winger Joseph Paintsil; they looked to Brazil, where they’d found 23-year-old winger Gabriel Pec. They added American goalkeeper John McCarthy and Japanese defender Miki Yamane. They signed Spanish forward Miguel Barry, but stuck with Bosnian striker Dejan Joveljić as their No. 9. They didn’t actively shy away from stars — and, in the summer, signed German attacker Marco Reus as a free agent — but applied the same criteria to each target: “How good is he?” And they quickly realized that the collective answer was: Very. They realized their improvement, in many ways, before they’d even won a game. On opening weekend, they hosted the league’s newest glamor club, Inter Miami. They welcomed Lionel Messi and friends, but not with open arms. They outshot Miami 24-11; they out-created the eventual Supporters Shield winners, 3.4 Expected Goals (xG) to 0.6. “We played them up head to head, and we felt like we were the better team on the day,” Vanney says. “We were every bit as good as them.” At the final whistle, they were heated and somewhat deflated. Sergio Busquets had simulated a foul to get LA’s Marky Delgado sent off. Messi equalized in stoppage time. The match ended 1-1. In the locker room later, and in the stands all evening, everyone realized: “This team could be really good.” Week after week, players fed off that energy, the polar opposite of what they’d encountered last season. They sprinted to the top of the Western Conference, going unbeaten at home, and stayed there for much of the season. On Decision Day, they coughed up the conference lead to LAFC. But they instantly rebounded in the playoffs. Riqui Puig, perhaps the league’s top showman west of Florida, orchestrated a first-round rout of Colorado. The aggregate score over two legs: Galaxy 9, Rapids 1. And so, their resurgence has been undeniable, but its ultimate validation awaits. Sunday's quarterfinal clash against Minnesota represents more than just a playoff game; it's a litmus test for the club's redefined identity. A win puts them on a potential conference-final collision course with LAFC, their crosstown rivals and a modern MLS benchmark. They’re the second-favorites to host and win MLS Cup. Celebrities seem wholly unnecessary. A defeat could bring old doubts creeping back. For all the energy and optimism surrounding this team, the path to sustained success in MLS is rarely linear. Still, for Vanney and Kuntz, the bigger picture remains clear. “There's so much joy, and excitement, and energy in our building,” Vanney says. “And our players just cannot wait to come play, and run, and entertain.”",2024-11-21

Analyst Tera Roberts helps us sort through the mess!","With six teams on a bye in Week 12, fantasy football managers are presented with two major problems — they must trust the boom-bust players they’ve been avoiding and lean on the big-name players who have been letting them down week after week. This isn’t a week for the faint of heart. Playoffs are right around the corner, and this week’s choices could make the difference between playoffs or the consolation bracket. We’ll look at players from two perspectives this week — Big Names with Big Problems and Bye Week Booms. Heading into the season, I thought the Vikings would use Ty Chandler as a complementary back to ensure Jones wasn’t overused. Aside from the challenges of being a 29-year-old running back, Jones has never been a true workhorse. He’s been a back who produces as an RB1 within a committee. Instead of repeating this effective approach, the Vikings gave Jones significant volume. Through 10 games, Jones has logged 157 rushing attempts. If he continues at this pace, he’ll exceed his previous career high of 236 carries, which was way back in 2019. Earlier in the season, when his legs were fresher, Jones was explosive, efficient and effective. Over the past four games, he has struggled significantly, averaging just 3.5 yards per carry and 9.2 fantasy points per game in half-PPR formats. This is a sharp contrast to his first 10 games, where he averaged 4.6 yards per carry and 13.5 fantasy points per game. The Vikings realized the need for another back and traded for Cam Akers, who has logged 23 carries over the past two games. Will Jones make or break your lineup in Week 12? Akers has been predictably inefficient, but the team continues to give him volume, likely in hopes of alleviating the strain on Jones. Despite the addition of Akers, Jones is still seeing solid volume; he’s simply no longer capitalizing on it. This week, he faces an advantageous matchup against the Chicago Bears. While the Bears’ defense has been strong overall, they are clearly weaker against the run. Statistically, Jones should get a rushing touchdown in this matchup. Despite the struggles, Jones could break through and have an RB1 week. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Before we dive into any numbers, let’s call a spade a spade; Deebo Samuel Sr. has flat-out looked awful. It hasn’t been a season of perfect health for him, but that’s nothing new. Another common pattern for Samuel is his tendency to oscillate between good and bad seasons. After a terrible 2022, Samuel admitted he was out of shape and rebounded in 2023. Now, in 2024, it feels like we’re watching a repeat of 2022 — which, inevitably, means 2025 could be a bounce-back year, so make a note of that ... but we can’t wait for the 2025 bounce-back. We need Samuel now. Will Samuel make or break your lineup in Week 12? Samuel is a special talent and there’s still time for him to turn things around this season, but it’s tough to trust him right now. He has clearly taken a backseat to George Kittle and Jauan Jennings and has just two total touchdowns on the season. This week, Samuel faces a Green Bay defense that has generally been strong against the pass. On one hand, this is a good opportunity to take advantage of his rushing upside. On the other, it’s difficult to believe he’ll provide strong receiving production this week. Samuel is, yet again, a risky flex play with bust potential. If you’ve read my articles before, you’ll know I’ve been pleasantly surprised with Pollard for most of the season. Unlike Samuel and Jones, Pollard has no issues with his performance, despite being in a terrible offensive situation. Weeks 1 through 9, Pollard was a respectable RB22 in average points per game in half-PPR, averaging 13.2 points. He ranked seventh in total carries and averaged a solid 4.4 yards per carry. However, much of his high volume earlier in the season was due to Tyjae Spears dealing with injuries. Over the past two weeks, with Spears active, there’s been a sharp decline in Pollard’s usage. Pollard has had just nine carries in each of the past two games and has failed to reach double-digit fantasy points. Will Pollard make or break your lineup in Week 12? The Titans have stated they want to reduce Pollard’s workload, perhaps out of concern for his long-term effectiveness. While this makes him wildly unreliable for fantasy purposes, there’s a potential silver lining. Spears is currently in concussion protocol, and if he’s unable to suit up, we could see the return of the old 20-30 touch version of Pollard. I have long-term concerns for Pollard in this offense, but if Spears is inactive, even with a less-than-ideal matchup, he offers RB1 upside. Aside from his Week 1 start, Worthy is coming off his best performance of the year. He recorded four receptions on five targets for 61 yards and a touchdown. What made this even more impressive was that it came against a stout Buffalo secondary. While Worthy has had similar performances earlier this season, this was the first week where he truly felt like the Chiefs’ WR1. He felt like the star — consistent and poised for more. It’s starting to feel like we could be on the verge of a rookie breakout in the second half of the season. Fantasy managers may understandably want to dive in headfirst, especially with a matchup against a seemingly good matchup in the Panthers. However, the Panthers haven’t allowed a receiving touchdown since Week 6 (to Drake London). Volume is still possible, but the Panthers’ secondary seems to be developing and trending in a positive direction. Will Worthy make or break your lineup in Week 12? I’m actually a bit hesitant to lean into Worthy given the matchup. Comparatively, the Panthers have allowed the 11th fewest fantasy points to opposing receivers but the most fantasy points to opposing running backs. If I’m predicting the Chiefs’ offensive approach to this matchup, pushing extremely high volume through the air doesn’t make sense. They’ll likely rely on their ground game, lean on their defense and limit Worthy’s involvement. He’ll likely see a maximum of five targets and will need a touchdown to have a productive day. Bateman is having the best season of his career, already surpassing his previous highs in receiving yards and touchdowns. Unfortunately, his leap in production hasn’t come with consistency. Calling it a lack of consistency might be underselling it. He can finish as the overall WR2 one week and WR78 the next. He’s a boom-or-bust player who is heavily touchdown-dependent due to a lack of volume. The good news is that Bateman’s boom games aren’t difficult to predict, as the Ravens’ offensive approach is fairly straightforward. Against weaker pass defenses, Baltimore tends to attack through the air and Bateman often thrives. His touchdowns this season have come against Dallas, both Cincinnati games and Tampa Bay — all defenses with clear struggles against the pass. Will Bateman make or break your lineup in Week 12? Bateman faces the Chargers who are very average against the pass, allowing the 16th most fantasy points to opposing receivers. Recently, they’ve been lit up by big-play receivers and even secondary receivers like Xavier Worthy and Calvin Austin III have had success against them. This matchup profiles as a strong opportunity for Bateman to deliver another big performance. It’s risky but he’s a high-upside bye week fill-in. Busted coverage or not, I’m ready to give Jim Harbaugh Coach of the Year purely for taking Quentin Johnston from arguably one of the worst receivers in the league to a shockingly usable fantasy asset. That said, it does feel a bit uncomfortable to fully lean into Johnston. A significant portion of his production has come from coverage breakdowns and it’s clear he still has some development to do. Will Johnston make or break your lineup in Week 12? Last week, Johnston caught two of his eight targets for 48 yards and scored a touchdown, delivering another solid fantasy outing. However, his fantasy value remains heavily reliant on touchdowns. He has three touchdowns this season and has finished inside the top 30 in those weeks. With Justin Herbert playing at an elite level, the Chargers have a beautiful matchup this week against the Baltimore Ravens — a game where Johnston could thrive. Johnston has legitimate flex value and with his boom-bust nature, could provide week-winning upside in Week 12.",2024-11-21

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Fantasy Football Week 12 sleepers: Need RB help this week? Take a chance on Roschon Johnson,https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy-football-week-12-sleepers-need-rb-help-this-week-take-a-chance-on-roschon-johnson-170842142.html,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:08:42 GMT",It's a bye-pocalypse in the fantasy football streets for Week 12. Scott Pianowski offers some help.,"Week 11 wasn't a perfect week with the sleeper page, no week ever is. Russell Wilson was a significant letdown and Audric Estimé didn't do much in Denver. But Taysom Hill and Jerry Jeudy smashed their projections, and Will Dissly was a strong play, too. We'll take that hit rate every time. Week 12 is probably the most challenging week of the fantasy season. It's not just the six teams on bye, but the quality of those collective rosters (Bills, Bengals, Falcons, Jets, Jaguars, Saints). You might be scrambling, and hopefully, we can help. Just remember, you'll probably need fewer points than usual to win your fantasy game this week. When the Chargers hired Jim Harbaugh, the team's identity immediately changed. Harbaugh brings a physical, run-focused nature to any roster he coaches, and it's been part of the success story this year. But don't mistake the LAC offense for some unit that deflates the ball and only passes out of desperation. The Chargers rank middle of the pack (19th, to be exact) in pass rate over expectation. It's not the Air Coryell Chargers, sure, but this isn't a leather-helmet offense, either. And now the Chargers host Baltimore, a good team that's struggled against the pass all year. The Ravens have given up the most fantasy points to wideouts this year, and it's not close. Johnston's development in his second year has been a fun story in Los Angeles. He's scored touchdowns in three straight weeks and he's coming off a season-best eight targets against Cincinnati. This is the week he graduates from the sleeper page and pushes his roster tag over 50%. I understand anyone's reluctance to believe in Will Levis. Most of his key passing metrics are well under the league average. But the Titans have a narrow passing tree, and since the DeAndre Hopkins trade, Westbrook-Ikhine has been a key part of that tree. Westbrook-Ikhine has touchdowns in five of six games, and while the early part of that run was a series of short touchdowns, he's also shown he can get downfield (consider last week's 98-yard catch and run). And it's important to recognize that Westbrook-Ikhine rarely comes off the field now; he's logged a 94% snap share since Hopkins was traded. Houston's secondary also presents a plus matchup for opposing wide receivers. We saw last week that Anthony Richardson's return was nothing to fear — the second-year quarterback was excellent in the comeback win over the Jets. And Richardson and Pierce have shown rapport all year — Pierce has a solid 60% catch rate on Richardson targets this year, and his average reception from Richardson is over 20 yards. The Colts are going to take deep shots. The Lions defense has quietly become one of the best units in the league — it's not just Ben Johnson's high-flying offense sparking the Detroit revival. But the Lions are down two critical members of the defense (pass-rushing ace Aidan Hutchinson, star linebacker Alex Anzalone), and Detroit has actually allowed the seventh-most points to opposing wideouts on a weekly basis. Pierce can get home in this matchup. I'm surprised Dissly hasn't graduated from this column yet, but it's coming soon. He's the TE12 over the past five weeks, including a TE5 showing last week. He's in the Justin Herbert Circle of Trust. Explosive plays aren't part of the story here (9.5 YPC), but Dissly has a reliable catch radius. This pick is obviously predicated on Jake Ferguson's status — if Ferguson (concussion) can't go, Schoonmaker steps into a sizable role. We saw Schoonmaker return a TE10 finish in Week 2 when Ferguson couldn't play, and Schoonmaker collected 10 targets and six catches in an emergency spot last Monday. As a non-starter in Dallas, he's run plenty of reps with current QB Cooper Rush. Rapport matters. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. It's been a tricky year for running back sleepers, given the overall health at the position. But you might need some unusual picks for Week 12, so we trudge forward. Johnson has punched in five touchdowns as Chicago's regular goal-line back, and it's possible Johnson could need more touches this week with D'Andre Swift nursing a groin injury. Minnesota's defense is a horrible draw for the Bears, but if you play Johnson this week, you're gambling on some touchdown deodorant. Maye's fantasy profile isn't dissimilar to what Bo Nix was offering a month or so ago. There's a rushing backboard here, and Maye's passing has been better than expected, despite the ordinary supporting cast around him. The Miami defense is a bad draw, no ducking that. But Maye is a solid bet for resourceful running and passing volume, especially when you consider New England is a 7.5-point underdog in this spot — game script will probably help his fantasy bottom line. I know a lot of fantasy managers will be hesitant to go back here. Javonte Williams was great last week, Estimé was not, and Williams has the starting baton. But Sean Payton has made it clear this is a hot-hand situation, and as poorly as Estimé played last week, he still scooped nine touches by the end of the game. He carries similar equity into a game the Broncos should control, road favorites against the two-win Raiders. Estimé can't be seen as a fantasy floor play, but you can squint and see some upside.",2024-11-21

Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",From Deep: How Scottie Barnes' return will impact 3 key players in fantasy basketball,https://sports.yahoo.com/from-deep-how-scottie-barnes-return-will-impact-3-key-players-in-fantasy-basketball-154303203.html,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 15:43:03 GMT",Scottie Barnes' injury absence has allowed three Raptors players to shine. Fantasy basketball analyst Dan Titus reveals what you should do with them now that Barnes is about to take the court again.,"The three-ball has become arguably the staple of scoring in the NBA — so we figured we'd take some shots from way downtown, too. Here, fantasy basketball analyst Dan Titus will break down three things fantasy basketball managers need to know each week. Or, he'll break down multiple three-point pieces of advice, analysis and more — it just depends on how open he is From Deep. Fantasy managers got a pleasant surprise on Wednesday afternoon when Raptors beat writer Josh Lewenberg posted that Barnes practiced in full and was upgraded to questionable ahead of Thursday's matchup against the Minnesota Timberwolves on X. He'll wear goggles to protect his eye, but by all indications, we should see one of the most versatile fantasy players back in the mix. He has missed the previous 11 contests with a fractured orbital bone and in his absence, the Raptors distributed his workload between RJ Barrett, Jakob Poeltl and Gradey Dick. Now that Barnes is on the cusp of returning, what does this mean for that Raptors trio? The pros: Barrett's been playing the best basketball of his career. Unfortunately, he'll undoubtedly see less usage when Barnes re-enters the lineup. With Barnes off the floor this season, Barrett averaged 23.4 points, 6.5 rebounds and 6.8 assists with a career-best 31% usage rate. He has been inefficient, but the boost in assists and steals has helped him become a top-25 player in points leagues. The cons: Barrett and Barnes shared the court once this season, but when combining his numbers from last season with Barnes', Barrett saw a 24.6 usage rate while posting 20.6 points, 6.3 rebounds and 3.8 assists per game. It's not a significant drop-off, but the assists are less prominent. The efficiency, however, significantly improved with Barnes. Barrett shot 54% from the field and 40.1% from three with fewer turnovers. Final verdict: All this to say, Barrett remains a great option for points leagues, and fantasy managers might have a buy-low window emerging since most expect Barnes' return to drive Barrett's numbers down further. An efficient version of RJ is worth considering in 9-cat leagues. The pros: Speaking of career years, Poeltl is averaging 39 fantasy points per game this year. Kelly Olynyk's been out with a back injury, leaving the Austrian big man with minimal competition for frontcourt minutes. It's resulted in Poeltl playing 30-plus minutes a night, which is the most of his career. Poeltl is providing fantasy managers with steady volume as a rebounder and defender. Coming into this season, his best finish in 9-cat leagues was 71st. Poeltl is on pace to finish as a top-50 player now that he's put up nearly 19 points, 12 rebounds, 3 assists and 3 stocks per game sans Barnes. The cons: Poeltl's scoring will likely regress once Barnes returns, but the rebounds and stocks should stick. I see the argument in selling high, especially after witnessing what he's done over the last three games. Absurd work. Jakob Poeltl's last three games:30 PTS | 15 REB35 PTS | 12 REB25 PTS | 18 REBWhile averaging 71.9 FG% pic.twitter.com/nqFJgmwyuk — StatMuse (@statmuse) November 19, 2024 Final verdict: I'm not selling at this point, but his elite play will likely draw interest from contenders once the trade deadline rolls around. Either way, Scottie Barnes' return shouldn't impact Poeltl as much as RJ Barrett from a pure counting stat perspective. The pros: Coming into Thursday, the second-year pro hasn't endured much of a sophomore slump offensively. Dick's increased his scoring output by 10 points per game this season, going from 8.5 points a night to 18.7 points per game. He's been slightly more efficient this year, too. Dick's true-shooting percentage climbed from .545 to .563. Basically, he's become less accurate with more shot volume, but his ability to get to the line (4.3 attempts/g) and knock down 91% of his freebies counters the efficiency lost in the field. He's also making the most of his opportunities on offense. His 22% usage rate is solid, but Dick is averaging the highest points per touch of any Raptor playing at least 20 minutes. He's their best shooter in the mid-range and, with Barnes' playmaking back in the fold, we should see Dick get better looks from beyond the arc as well. The cons: While that all sounds promising, Dick scored 15.4 points per game with Scottie in street clothes compared to 12.6 points when Barnes suited up. The scoring is coming down. Another issue with Gradey is that he does little outside of scoring and 3s. He'll get 30-plus minutes, cool — but in four games playing alongside Scottie this year, Dick averaged 1.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists. He ranked as the 98th player in 9-cat leagues over that four-game sample, and while it's been up ever since, I don't see the upside if he's not contributing to more categories. Final verdict: Fantasy managers have been abandoning ship with Dick's rostership down by over 5% since Wednesday. While he's exceeding expectations, I support the decision to drop him in most points and 9-cat leagues.",2024-11-21

On Tuesday morning, when you launched your league homepage to scope out this week’s lineup decisions, you probably recognized the terrible predicament NFL schedule-makers created for us.‌ Six different teams are on bye this week, none of which are irrelevant in fantasy. We will be without our Falcons, Bills, Bengals, Saints, Jets and Jaguars. Put another way: We are missing the overall QB2, QB4, RB3, RB4, RB6, RB8, RB14, WR1, WR4, WR5, WR9, WR10, WR21, TE6 and TE7, among other useful pieces. Just an absolute fantasy nightmare.

Whenever one of these mega-byes arrives — and another is ahead of us in Week 14, just so you know — it’s important to remember that amid the messiness, we can also find opportunity. Every active manager in your league placed multiple waiver claims this week, which of course means everyone in your league was dropping players. We happen to be in one of those weeks in which the second-wave of pickups might actually be better than the first. Here’s a partial list of players who took a significant roster-percentage hit in Yahoo leagues when waivers ran overnight on Tuesday, each of them dropped by over 3,000 managers: Kirk Cousins Aaron Rodgers Russell Wilson (ahead of a beatable matchup on TNF) Sam Darnold Keenan Allen Jaylen Waddle 👀 Cedric Tillman (the week’s most obviously bad drop decision) Darnell Mooney Rico Dowdle Travis Etienne Jr. (OK, this one brought sweet relief to the dropper) Tank Bigsby Jonathon Brooks (ahead of his regular-season debut!) Tyler Allgeier Jordan Mason Raheem Mostert Ray Davis T.J. Hockenson (no idea what this is about) Dalton Kincaid Jake Ferguson Kyle Pitts Evan Engram Tucker Kraft Detroit Lions D/ST (they get Indy this week and still have both Bears games remaining) So, yeah, it’s a pretty great week to dumpster dive. Every name above is either playable or stashable, depending on your league’s specific format. We just mass-dropped most of the premium backup running backs and almost 50% of the preseason top-12 tight ends.‌ If you haven’t made a regular habit of reviewing the mid-week drops … well, it’s certainly not too late to start. There’s never been a better time, in fact. When trade deadlines are behind us, often the best way to fill a roster need is by sifting through other people’s fantasy trash.",2024-11-21

Appearing on the ""SI Media with Jimmy Traina"" podcast, Magnus said of the 91-year-old Brown, ""I don’t think there’s a single human being that’s ever had a longer association with professional basketball.” “We are going to give Hubie one last shot on a game. He deserves that,” Magnus said. “We think the world of him. I think it’s absolutely remarkable the level he still calls games at age 90-plus … We’re going to honor Hubie this year during the regular season at some point to be determined and send him off in style."" After a short playing career, Brown entered coaching in 1955 at the high school level. After a decade, he moved up to the collegiate ranks as an assistant at William & Mary and Duke before joining the staff of a Milwaukee Bucks team in 1972 that featured future Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson. Brown earned his first head coaching job in 1975 with the American Basketball Association's Kentucky Colonels, who won the ABA Championship in his first season. Following the ABA-NBA merger, Brown was hired as head coach of the Atlanta Hawks. He was named NBA Coach of the Year in 1978 before being fired late in the 1980-81 season. Following the retirement of legendary head coach Red Holzman in 1982, Brown was hired by the New York Knicks. He coached parts of five seasons before being fired early in the 1986-87 season. After taking on broadcasting gigs in between jobs, Brown became a regular on television following his dismissal from the Knicks. He joined the NBA on CBS coverage until the league's media rights moved to Turner Sports in the early 1990s. In 2002, 16 years after his last NBA coaching job, Brown, at age 69, was hired by the Memphis Grizzlies after Sidney Lowe was dismissed following an 0-8 start. The next season, his first full one in charge, the Grizzlies improved by 22 wins with a 50-32 record and made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. That success led to Brown being named Coach of the Year for a second time. Brown's tenure in Memphis wasn't for long. Twelve games into the 2004-05 season he resigned, citing medical reasons. Out of coaching again, Brown was hired by ABC for their NBA coverage and called the 2005 and 2006 NBA Finals. He's been a part of ABC/ESPN telecasts ever since. For his contributions to the sport, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2005 as a contributor. He's also a part of the College Basketball Hall of Fame and National Sports Media Association Hall of Fame. It hasn't been an easy past six months for Brown.

San Francisco's head athletic trainer, Dustin Little, was seen rubbing Purdy’s throwing shoulder. Then, Purdy left the field before the start of practice. Purdy’s status for the 49ers’ critical Week 12 game against the Green Bay Packers appears to be in question due to the condition of his right shoulder.

Purdy took part in limited practice on Wednesday, but did not throw any passes during the warm up periods in which reporters were allowed to observe. Coach Kyle Shanahan expressed optimism on Wednesday that Purdy would be able to play against the Packers when asked about his level of concern. “Not much right now,” Shanahan said. “We’ll see how this week goes. But he is limited today, so I think that's good news.” Purdy has started all 10 games for the 49ers this season. He is completing 66 percent of his pass attempts for 2,613 yards with 13 touchdowns and eight interceptions.

Dalton Del Don attempts to identify misleading numbers that are worth a closer look. Yes ... The Numbers Do Lie. Stafford has averaged nearly as many fantasy points (14.3) this season as Daniel Jones (14.2), who’s been moved possibly to QB4 on New York’s depth chart. But Stafford’s fantasy rank is misleading, as he’s a weekly top-12 QB when the Rams are healthy. Stafford has averaged 296.4 passing yards, 2.2 TDs and 19.0 fantasy points (~QB7) in games with Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua this season; he’s averaged 215.0 passing yards, 0.4 TDs and 8.9 fantasy points (~QB40) without them (h/t FTN). And Nacua was ejected from one of those games early. Stafford is also due for touchdown regression. He ranks sixth in red-zone passes and leads the league in end-zone targets (33) but is tied for 12th in TD passes. Stafford is the QB13 in expected fantasy points despite being the only quarterback in the league without a single scramble. The Rams have the fourth-highest neutral pass rate over the last month and have passed on 63% of their red-zone plays since Kupp and Nacua returned. Unfortunately, difficult matchups will remain a hurdle. After having the league’s fifth-hardest QB schedule up until now, L.A. has the sixth-toughest rest of season. The Rams get an especially tough matchup this week against an Eagles defense leading the NFL in EPA/play over the last six weeks while shutting down opposing passing attacks. Still, Stafford looks like a top-12 QB down the stretch if Kupp and Nacua can stay healthy. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Taylor has averaged 10.3 (half-PPR) fantasy points (RB30) in two games with Joe Flacco this season, but he’s averaged 15.7 fpg (RB8) while scoring all five of his touchdowns in six games with Anthony Richardson. AR made a triumphant return last week, and he’ll remain Indianapolis’ starter over the rest of the season, health permitting. Taylor has handled 100% of the Colts’ RB rush attempts in three of the last four games, and he’s due for touchdown regression; Taylor has the third most carries (13) inside the 5-yard line (despite missing three games), but he’s tied for 15th in rushing scores. Taylor gets a tough matchup this week against a Lions’ defense that ranks second in EPA/play, but his schedule eases up afterward. Indy’s offense has experienced far more success (especially rushing and on early downs) with Richardson starting this season, so Taylor will benefit from the move back to the young quarterback. McConkey ranks No. 11 out of 120 pass catchers in ESPN’s Receiver Score, and he’s 13th in the league in first downs per route run. The Chargers have posted a positive DBOE in four of six games since their bye, and Justin Herbert is playing fantastic. While Joshua Palmer has failed to step up, McConkey saw a career-high nine targets last week and was among the league leaders in air yards. He gets a prime matchup this week against the league’s top pass-funnel defense; the Ravens rank 28th in EPA/dropback but second in EPA/rush. After matchups filled with low-scoring games and the league’s fourth-toughest WR schedule, the Chargers are set to play numerous shootouts and have the sixth-easiest WR schedule moving forward. More red-zone targets would be preferable, but McConkey is legit, and more volume down the stretch will lead to bigger fantasy production. Harrison Jr. hasn’t been a bust, but he’s been a disappointment while averaging fewer fantasy points than Quentin Johnston. Harrison Jr. started to finally run more crossing routes before Arizona’s bye, and hopefully, MHJ gets the proverbial rookie bump coming out of it. Harrison Jr. ranks seventh in air yards share (41.1%) and eighth in end-zone targets — tied with Ja’Marr Chase and CeeDee Lamb. Harrison Jr. has faced the league’s fifth-toughest WR schedule up until now (his QB has faced the toughest), but the rookie wideout gets the fourth easiest moving forward. Harrison Jr. has produced the second most fantasy points per route run against press this season, and he has four remaining matchups against defenses that use that coverage heavily (including this week versus the Seahawks). Kyler Murray got 9.1 YPA over his last three games before Arizona’s bye against three top pass defenses, so the Cardinals’ offense could score a bunch of points down the stretch. Harrison Jr.’s role should continue to rise just like his fantasy rank.",2024-11-21

McConkey had a rollercoaster of a performance in Week 11. He originally left his matchup against the Bengals with a shoulder injury. The injury appeared to be serious as he quickly went from the medical tent to the locker room. However, McConkey was able to return to the game and put up the best performance of his rookie season, finishing Week 11 with six catches for 123 yards on nine targets. All of these were season-highs, and he was relied on twice on the game-winning drive for gains of 28 yards and 27 yards. McConkey leads the team with a 24% target share, and he ranks 21st in yards per route run this season — strong numbers for a rookie. This week, McConkey will face the Ravens. Baltimore has been a fantasy wonderland for wide receivers all season, allowing the most receiving yards and fantasy points per game to opposing wideouts. McConkey is a must start this week and likely every week moving forward. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Robinson Jr. returned from a hamstring injury in Week 11 against the Eagles. Despite dealing with a knee and hamstring injuries over the past month, Robinson went back to operating as the Commanders clear RB1. He commanded 76% of the RB carries in this game which was his highest mark on the season. Robinson turned this usage into 72 total yards and a touchdown on 17 touches — a solid performance, especially when you consider he was facing the Eagles' No. 1 ranked defense according to PFF. But this week Robinson gets a much better matchup against the Cowboys. Dallas ranks 30th in run defense this season, and only the Panthers allow more rushing yards per game. In Week 11, Joe Mixon totaled 153 yards and three touchdowns against this Cowboys defense. Make sure Robinson is in your lineups this week. Flowers had a down game in Week 11 against the Steelers. He had just one catch for 23 yards until the Ravens final offensive play of the game where he caught a 16-yard touchdown. This saved his day as he finished with two catches for 39 yards and a score. Flowers also had two drops in this contest. It was an ugly day for him in a tough matchup against the Steelers' No. 3 ranked defense according to PFF. But despite the poor yardage total, Flowers still led the Ravens with a 22% target share in Week 11. He now leads the team in targets in nine of his 11 games this season. This week Flowers will get a matchup against the Chargers No. 4 ranked secondary. On paper, this looks like another tough spot for Flowers, but it might not be. The Chargers have allowed 104 yards per game to opposing No. 1 receivers over the past month of the season. Last week they gave up 148 yards and a score to Tee Higgins and 75 yards and two touchdowns to Ja’Marr Chase. This is a sneaky good spot for Flowers, who is a top-15 receiver this week. Keep him in your lineups. Williams and the Lions are coming off an offensive explosion in Week 11 against the Jaguars. The Lions put up 52 points and scored on all eight of their drives until kneeling the ball out on their final drive. Williams contributed to this big day on offense with a season-high 124 yards and a touchdown on six targets. This was the most usage Williams has seen since Week 2, and it was his best fantasy day since Week 1 against the Rams. Week 11 was a perfect matchup for Williams against a weak Jaguars secondary, but Week 12 may be even better. Williams will face the Colts this week who allow the seventh most receiving yards per game and the fourth most yards to opposing outside receivers this season. The Vegas total for this game is 50.5 points — the seonc highest on the week. Expect plenty of points for the Lions and Williams once again. Start Williams this week. White returns from his bye week and gets one of the best RB matchups you can find, taking on the Giants who allow the most rushing yards per play this season according to NFL Pro. But it gets even better because the Bucs are 6-point favorites this week against the Tommy DeVito-led Giants. There’s an increased chance Tampa plays with a lead which may fuel more rush attempts for Rachaad White and Bucky Irving. Before the bye week, White was operating as the lead back in all key situations for Tampa. White handled 100% of the goal-line snaps and 100% of the two-minute offense snaps in Week 10. Since returning from injury in Week 7, White is averaging 16.6 fantasy points per game and has scored a touchdown in every contest during this time. Expect the good times to continue against the Giants this week; White is a must-start in Week 12 with six teams on bye.",2024-11-21
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Thursday Night Football: Steelers vs. Browns fantasy football breakdown,https://sports.yahoo.com/thursday-night-football-steelers-vs-browns-fantasy-football-breakdown-143802638.html,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 14:38:02 GMT",Get ready for Week 12's Thursday night AFC North showdown between the Steelers and Browns with this fantasy preview from Mo Castillo.,"You can watch Thursday Night Football: Steelers vs. Browns at 8:20 p.m. ET/5:20 p.m. PT on Amazon Prime Video. We're gonna get another dose of divisional action tonight, as the 8-2 Pittsburgh Steelers travel to Ohio to take on the 2-8 Cleveland Browns. Now, the last few divisional matchups we've had on TNF have been pretty good for fantasy football purposes, so we have to hope this one doesn't turn into your typical AFC North (or rather, Steelers-specific) rock fight, where only the kickers and punters seem to have a day (looking at you, Chris Boswell). Let's go to the tale of the tape. As alluded to in the intro, the Steelers thrive in games that feature tough running, even tougher defense and a final score that looks more like a hockey game than a football one (okay fine, I'm exaggerating, but when you're invested in fantasy prospects, the Steelers aren't the best draw for your players). This style of play isn't exactly conducive to opposing receivers. Let's just look at the results of some high-profile pass-catchers facing Pittsburgh this season: Drake London (2-15) Courtland Sutton (1-26) Quentin Johnston / Ladd McConkey (combined 5-88-1) Michael Pittman Jr. / Josh Downs (combined 14-195-1) CeeDee Lamb (5-62) Brock Bowers (9-71) Garrett Wilson / Davante Adams (combined 8-91) Malik Nabers (7-71) Outside of the Joe Flacco mid-game eruption, the Steelers have, for the most part, kept opposing receivers in check, especially as the names and resumes have gotten brighter. But let's look at things from the context of this game specifically. The Steelers should defeat the Browns handily, as the better team. But we cannot ignore a major factor: Jameis Winston. Winston has been everything fantasy managers dream of: his usual gunslinger self, lifting the ceilings of every pass-catcher on the Browns, no matter the matchup or situation. The Browns have also been incredibly pass-heavy since Winston took over; whether that's because they know the pass game gives them the best chance to win or because they realize Nick Chubb will not return to form this season. Nonetheless, Winston's chuck-it nature has revitalized David Njoku, Cedric Tillman, Jerry Jeudy and Elijah Moore. Njoku, Moore and Jeudy had great games last week even though the Browns eventually fell, 35-14. Sure, the Saints' injury-battered defense pales in comparison to the Steelers', but with Cleveland adopting a pass-first (and then when the pass fails, pass again) mindset, these pass-catchers should all get their chances in this game. I am most worried about Tillman, who will likely get targets but will also be followed around by Joey Porter Jr.. So, while I expect more catches than last week, Tillman's ceiling might be capped. Thankfully, Winston is no stranger to spreading the ball around. I'm starting all of Tillman, Njoku and Jeudy, and I'm considering Moore in deep leagues. Now let's just hope the weather permits the pass — it's looking like rain during the game. It seems like ganging up on Najee Harris has been more common than singing his praises. He's too slow, he has no electricity in his runs, he has to share the load with Jaylen Warren, he doesn't catch passes. Blah, blah, blah. All Harris has done since Week 6 is produce. Even last week, when he was held under 70 rushing yards, Harris still collected 93 total yards thanks to four catches. As Matt Harmon has said this season, Russell Wilson has been a ""touchdown or checkdown"" quarterback (last week both Harris and Warren caught four passes apiece) in the context of the Steelers' run-heavy, play-action-pass offense. Basically, even in tough matchups, Harris has a safe floor and solid ceiling. He comes into this game riding a streak of a touchdown or 90 total yards in five straight games. Expect the streak to continue tonight. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Mike Williams joined the Steelers and immediately caught one pass for a deep touchdown. Basically, his bread-and-butter. And it's a skill that works well with Russell Wilson's deep-ball strengths. Of course, in his second game as a Steeler, Williams didn't receive a single target, putting up a big fat zero for deep-leaguers who took a chance on the big-play receiver in a plus matchup. Williams is rostered in just 16% of leagues, down 4% from last week, which is understandable. But I'd keep him stashed on the bench if you can — it's not out of the realm of possibility that Williams settles into the boom-or-bust MVS role, with the occasional 3-120-1 explosion. That likely wouldn't change the outlooks of George Pickens or Harris. Williams was fighting a losing battle in a crowded Jets' offensive-weapon room. But there's space for him to thrive on this Steelers team, with the way it's constructed and the way the offense likes to play. I'm remaining cautiously optimistic about the addition; if he can produce a big play or two in a plus matchup tonight, I'm adding him off the waiver wire. You're probably reading the above header and thinking one of two things: 1) ""Who cares about a non-top-10 TE?"" or 2) ""I'm not benching a starting tight end, not when Kyle Pitts, Dalton Kincaid, Evan Engram and Taysom Hill are on bye."" And I understand both sentiments. It's not fun for me, either. But the same way you're probably thinking one of those two things, you also need to understand two more things. 1) Pat Freiermuth (54% rostered) has seemingly been phased out of the Steelers offense save for the occasional short pass down the middle or scramble-drill red-zone target — he hasn't surpassed the three-target mark in any of his last six games, and 2) the Browns have utterly silenced opposing tight ends this season. Don't let the green on your fantasy app fool you — if you have a better option at TE this week (maybe you landed Will Dissly or Jonnu Smith or Zach Ertz or want to go deep with Ja'Tavion Sanders), fire 'em up.",2024-11-21
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",How becoming a dad helped convince Sean McVay to remain Rams head coach,https://sports.yahoo.com/becoming-dad-helped-convince-sean-110020031.html,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 11:00:20 GMT","When Sean McVay was hired by the Rams as the youngest coach in NFL history, he was single. Now he's married with a son, and that has changed his life.","After the Rams hired Sean McVay in 2017, general manager Les Snead was eager to see the 30-year-old’s head-coaching process at work. During McVay’s first seven seasons, Snead often observed McVay in the coach’s office, busily scheming plays. Reading motivational books. Meeting with coaches, players and team executives. So Snead was shocked last August when he witnessed something totally unexpected: McVay making faces and cooing baby talk on a video call. “Of all the things I thought I would see Sean McVay do,” Snead said, “that was not on the list.” On Oct. 24, 2023, McVay and wife Veronika welcomed a newborn son, Jordan John McVay. Read more: NFL Week 12 picks: Rams-Eagles and Chargers-Ravens ... who's ready for prime time? It was the latest personal milestone for McVay, who became the youngest coach in modern NFL history when owner Stan Kroenke signed off on making him the Rams’ on-field leader. NFL fans since have watched McVay literally grow up on the sideline while leading the Rams to five playoff appearances, two Super Bowl trips and a Super Bowl title to end the 2021-22 season. McVay, 38, also has come of age off the field. McVay and Veronika married in June 2022. The next season, as the Rams and McVay suffered through the worst Super Bowl hangover in history, McVay contemplated stepping away from coaching. But the impending birth of his son, and the opportunity to serve as an example of persevering through hard times, factored into his decision to return. Being a husband, and a father to Jordan, McVay said, has given him “real purpose” off the field. Also on it. “I definitely think it does make you a better coach,” he said. At the 2017 NFL owners meetings, a reporter asked Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll how he thought McVay would fare with the Rams. Carroll, a grandfather well into his third stint as an NFL head coach, said there was no question that the bright and knowledgeable McVay would excel. The challenges, Carroll noted, might come off the field because nearly all NFL coaches start families as college or pro assistants, before they ascend to the top job. McVay would navigate that path with the weight of an entire pro football organization on his shoulders. One year into fatherhood, McVay is managing fine. Read more: Safety Kamren Curl has an eagle eye on defending Rams' next opponent “I’m still getting a good amount of sleep,” quipped the notoriously early riser. McVay said his late grandfather John, a former NFL coach and longtime executive for the San Francisco 49ers, his father Tim and uncles Jim and John set great examples as fathers and mentors. So did former Rams defensive coordinator Raheem Morris, other current and former assistants and players such as former Rams offensive lineman Andrew Whitworth. “The way that they lead their families is unbelievable to me,” McVay said. Morris, now the coach of the Atlanta Falcons, became a father in 2010 before his second season as coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Morris, who worked with McVay at Tampa Bay and also in Washington before joining McVay’s Rams staff in 2021, often told McVay that becoming a father changes what happens when coaches cross the threshold of their home or greet family after a game. “You’re teaching your kids a lesson from that point on,” said Morris, who has three children. “Even when they’re at Jordan’s age, and you come in the house and you see those eyes looking at you, it’s a different deal. “You realize why you’re doing it and what you’re doing it for. And everything else is secondary when you look at those kids in that moment.” Whitworth, a father of four, signed with the Rams in 2017 and played until 2021, when he was 40. Being a father has provided the obsessively goal-oriented McVay something new to “chase,” Whitworth said. Read more: Rams tackle Andrew Whitworth on playing at 40: 'It's pretty wild' “He’s got a chance to look at Jordan every day and look at Veronika and say, ‘I would love to freak out about how practice went today, I would love to freak out about where we are as a team right now — that’s normally what I would do,’” said Whitworth, now a broadcaster for Amazon Prime. “‘But in this moment, I’m going to put Jordan in my lap and I’m going to have some perspective. … This is my priority and I want to be great at it.’” McVay and Veronika, who was born in Ukraine, met when McVay was an assistant coach in Washington and she was a student at George Mason University in Virginia. McVay spoke often about wanting to become a father, but actually becoming one “transformed” him in meaningful ways, amplifying qualities he already possessed, Veronika said. He is now more patient, empathetic, thoughtful and compassionate at home and at work, she said. “He prioritizes quality family time and being fully present even when he has those long days at the facility,” said Veronika, a real estate agent. “He’s just so excited to come home and see our little man. And Jordan always can put a smile on his face even on those toughest days.” In the offseason, McVay made it a point to be home in time to help put Jordan to bed. During the season, it is more of a challenge, but Friday nights and breakfast before home games are set aside for family time. “The things that he really cherishes in his life, the things that he loves — they’re not all in one basket anymore.” Rams receiver Cooper Kupp, on coach Sean McVay as a father And fatherly duties such as changing diapers. ""I've had some moments where I'm holding him, and you look down and you're like, 'OK, how did that end up on me?'"" McVay said, laughing. ""I get down and dirty with that."" McVay also prioritizes being present when working from his home office. “He comes in and out and says, ‘I need a mental break,’” Veronika said. Still, football is never too far from his mind. “Whenever he’s got an idea in his head, he’ll say, ‘I have to run back in there. I’ll be right back,’” she said, laughing. McVay’s parents see similarities in their son and grandson. McVay’s habit of being in constant motion dates to his childhood. “He was a busy guy,” his father said. So is Jordan, who often chases McVay in a rolling baby walker. “He’s very active like Sean, but he’s very chill like Veronika,” said McVay’s mother, Cindy, who paused a beat before laughing and adding. “And Sean was never chill.” In 2022, as the Rams stumbled to a 5-12 record, Rams executives watched McVay struggle to navigate the team’s faltering play. Afterward, with broadcast networks beckoning, McVay pondered taking a break from coaching. His son’s impending arrival led him to reconsider. “I never would have been able to look at him and say, ‘You know, when tough times hit, you push through it and grow from adversity,’” McVay said. “If I had run away from it, it would be, “Do as I say, not as I did.’” Last season, the Rams started 3-6 but McVay kept himself together. Jordan was born in the midst of the team’s second-half turnaround that resulted in a 10-7 record and a playoff berth. Fatherhood helped McVay balance that “kind of maniacal” sense that also makes him a great coach, Rams president Kevin Demoff said. “For someone who’s always searched for balance,” Demoff said, “this helps provide it in a much more natural way without searching.” Defensive coordinator Chris Shula has known McVay since they were college teammates at Miami of Ohio. They have coached together since 2017. McVay was always great around kids, said Shula, the father of two. But he did not have a true concept of fatherhood and taking care of a baby until he began to go through it himself. “He’s still getting here at 3 in the morning, so I don’t think it’s changed anything with the work ethic or the motivation,” Shula said. “But I think just the internal joy and doing it for others, I think that’s really what you see.” There also is external joy. “When he gets that picture texted to him or he’s on Facetime,” said offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur, a father of two, “it just instantly lights him up.” McVay’s enthusiasm while sharing video of his son apparently rivals his excitement when evaluating and discussing a top draft prospect. “He loves being able to say, ‘Look how wired this guy is!'” Snead said. “‘Look how alert he is. Look how intense, urgent, enthusiastic and passionate he is.’ “It’s really cool.” Throughout the first 15 years of his coaching career, McVay saw players not only as highly skilled athletes but also as developing men from a variety of backgrounds. His view further evolved when he became a father, Veronika said. “He sees them as young people who are navigating their own struggles and triumphs,” she said, “and he understands now in a way that only a parent can, that each kid out there has their own story and needs support in their unique ways.” Rams players, many of them also young fathers, noted subtle changes in McVay since he became a parent. “Something about his energy,” said safety John Johnson III, a father of a son. “His spirit is kind of different, kind of like he’s doing this for somebody, like he has more purpose. “I kind of feel that vibe.” McVay still pulls players aside for chats about their roles on the team. Or their assignments on the field. But now children also come into play. “I’m much more inclined to ask about those things,” McVay said, “because I’m now that dad showing the pictures and videos.” Read more: Rams-Patriots takeaways: With four TD passes, Matthew Stafford keeps breaking records Quarterback Matthew Stafford, a father to four girls, said “it’s football all the time” when the Rams are at work preparing for the season or opponents. But there’s also time to pause. “You can tell a story here or there of, ‘Hey, Tuesday afternoon I was playing goalie at my girls’ soccer practice … and my girls were yelling at me because I was afraid of the ball or something,’” Stafford said. “His son isn’t old enough to quite do some of those things, but I know he enjoys sharing stories back on what’s going on at home, which is cool to see.” Receiver Cooper Kupp began his Rams career the same year as McVay. Kupp, a father of three, said there is no mystery why McVay enthusiastically shares fatherhood experiences. “The things that he really cherishes in his life, the things that he loves — they’re not all in one basket anymore,” Kupp said, adding, “That helps give you perspective, and levels you out a little bit.” Players who do not yet have children also have heard McVay weave fatherhood into his coaching role. Occasionally, he references lessons passed down to him by his father. “He’ll kind of mention like, ‘My dad used to say …,’” defensive lineman Kobie Turner said. “He takes a lot of what he’s learned from real life and what it seems like he learned from his father and applies it. “He often tries to relate to the guys in the room and talk about how he’s trying to be the best version of himself, not only for us as a team but also like, he’s a dad now.” Last month, McVay reached another milestone. The Rams defeated the Minnesota Vikings at SoFi Stadium to give McVay his 80th victory, moving him past the late John Robinson as the winningest coach in Rams history. McVay achieved the feat on his son’s first birthday. “That was the coolest,” McVay said, “and felt like a little God-wink right there for you. That was pretty special.” Read more: All his players say it: 'John Robinson was hands down my all-time favorite head coach' McVay’s parents said it also has been special to watch their son grow. “For being so hard charging and driven, I believe he’s worked even harder on taking care of himself for this,” Tim said. “And that makes him a better overall dude at the office and in coaching.” And at home. Watching her husband embrace fatherhood has been “a gift,” Veronika said. “It’s changed his perspective on some things in the best way possible,” she said, “and I think he’ll just keep growing from that.” The McVays know there will be challenges ahead. As children get older, so do their opportunities for activities in sports, music and other areas. Cindy McVay speaks from experience. “He’s going to have to figure out some things when Jordan starts his own sports,” she said. “You really don’t want to miss that kind of stuff, so that’s all going to be kind of a learning thing.” McVay is not looking too far ahead. Whether asked about his personal situation or his team’s chances of making the playoffs, he often speaks about “being where your feet are.” McVay’s are happily planted with his wife and son. “It’s a love you can never know,” he said, “until you have it.” Get the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.

The Golden State Warriors announced Wednesday night that Melton will undergo season-ending ACL surgery. De'Anthony Melton injury update: pic.twitter.com/D9Vy3Wkx0p — Warriors PR (@WarriorsPR) November 21, 2024 Melton went down in the Warriors’ 120-117 win over the Dallas Mavericks last week, though it’s unclear exactly when he was hurt in that game. Melton, who was recently moved into the Warriors’ starting lineup, was then ruled out indefinitely with an ACL sprain in his left knee. Further testing in recent days determined that it would be in his ""best interest"" to have surgery rather than try to return to the court this season. Melton will now do that in the coming days. Melton joined the Warriors this past offseason on a one-year, $12.8 million deal after spending the past two seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers. He averaged 10.3 points and 3.3 rebounds in six games with Golden State. He put up 16.5 points and seven rebounds per contest once entering the starting lineup. The 26-year-old missed five games with a lower back strain, too. Though Melton should be ready to go for the start of the 2025-26 campaign, it’s unclear where he’ll end up. Melton will be a free agent this upcoming summer. While he looked solid for the Warriors early this season, the team may not be willing to sign him to another deal, especially with him coming off of an ACL injury. Melton was selected in the second round of the 2018 NBA Draft, and he spent time with the Phoenix Suns and Memphis Grizzlies before landing in Philadelphia. The Warriors entered Wednesday night’s game against the Atlanta Hawks with a 10-3 record, which has them in a slight lead in the Western Conference standings.

Middleton is still working to “feel physically ready” to make his season debut with the Bucks after he underwent a pair of ankle surgeries this past offseason, according to ESPN’s Shams Charania. Middleton has increased his on-court activity in recent weeks and participated in three-on-three play in practices, but he’s still not back to full participation. While the team is supportive of Middleton, his absence has been longer than many inside the organization expected it to be, per the report. It’s unclear when Middleton will make his debut with the team this season. The Bucks hope that he can participate in full scrimmages before he plays in a real game. ""He's looked good,"" Bucks head coach Doc Rivers said on Wednesday, via ESPN. ""He's working his butt off. Listen, I think he's close. And he's just going to keep working. This is the best I've seen him, I will say that."" Middleton averaged 15.1 points and 5.3 assists per game last season, his 11th with the Bucks. The three-time All-Star shot better than 49% from the floor last season. Middleton, however, has played in just 88 regular-season games since the start of the 2022-23 campaign due to various injuries, and he’s appeared in only 15 games under Rivers since he was hired to take over the team in January. The Bucks could use Middleton. They entered Wednesday’s game against the Chicago Bulls with a 5-9 record. While they have won three of their last four, the Bucks lost six of their first seven games of the season. Middleton will undoubtedly make a big impact for Milwaukee once he’s on the court again. When that will actually be, however, is still up in the air.",2024-11-21

Terrell Owens did not mince words when dissecting Deebo Samuel's 2024 NFL season with the 49ers. In a campaign that the veteran wide receiver himself deemed the ""most frustrating"" of his six-year career, both Samuel and the 49ers' performance on the field has not lived up to expectations. And that includes the expectations of the Pro Football Hall of Fame wide receiver, who discussed Samuel's performance this season with 95.7 The Game's ""The Morning Roast"" on Thursday. ""Deebo is not really playing up to Deebo's standards,"" Owens told Bonta Hill and Joe Shasky. ""Deebo, it seems like he's more focused on his pregame attire than he is actually the game. So again, if we can shift that focus, maybe that can energize and create some more production from an offensive standpoint. Just kind of tongue in cheek with that."" While Owens clarified that his remark about Samuel's attire was tongue-in-cheek, he clearly does not believe the 49ers wide receiver's performance has lived up to expectations. In nine games this season, Samuel has 33 receptions for 490 yards and one touchdown through the air, while rushing 27 times for only 79 yards (2.9 yards per attempt) and one touchdown on the ground. The self-proclaimed ""wideback"" has not been nearly as effective as a dual-threat weapon this season as in years past, and even with star wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk sidelined for the remainder of the season, Samuel, on the season and in some games, has been San Francisco's third option in the passing game behind receiver Jauan Jennings and tight end George Kittle. In the 49ers' Week 10 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Samuel had the fourth-most receiving yards behind Jennings, receiver Ricky Pearsall and running back Christian McCaffrey. Samuel still has seven games to turn his 2024 season around, and the struggling 49ers certainly would benefit from a return to form. Download and follow the 49ers Talk Podcast",2024-11-21

Backup quarterback Hendon Hooker has played at the end of those three blowouts, but he has only thrown nine passes so far this season. Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson says it could be valuable for Hooker to throw the ball more in a game situation, especially after he didn't play at all as a rookie last season. But Johnson also doesn't want to call too many passes after the game is already in hand, for sportsmanship reasons. ""I think it's invaluable for him, going out there, you've got the lights shining on you, you've got people looking at you, it's not practice setting,"" Johnson said of Hooker playing in games. ""Now we're at a spot where he's been able to get a few in games this year, and the challenge for me is I do want to get him some passes but also don't want to be disrespectful to the opponent as well, so it's kind of a balancing act when it comes to that.""

Which NHL club is next? The Red Wings, Penguins and others surfaced in speculation.","James Guillory-Imagn Images On Tuesday, the Boston Bruins replaced Jim Montgomery as coach, promoting associate coach Joe Sacco on an interim basis. TSN's Pierre LeBrun reported the Bruins will give Sacco a legitimate chance to become their full-time coach. He indicated they don't intend to start searching for a new bench boss and haven't reached out to any available candidates. Meanwhile, some observers are proposing new coaching destinations for Montgomery. The Hockey News' Adam Proteau suggested the Detroit Red Wings, Nashville Predators, and Pittsburgh Penguins. Meanwhile, The Athletic's Fluto Shinzawa included the St. Louis Blues and Montreal Canadiens on his list. Related: Three NHL Teams That Should Consider Hiring Jim Montgomery Those five teams are off to disappointing starts, putting varying degrees of heat on their current bench bosses. On Nov. 16, Detroit Hockey Now's Bob Duff observed the Red Wings' lifeless 4-1 loss to the Los Angeles Kings on Saturday. He wondered if coach Derek Lalonde needed a win on Monday against the San Jose Sharks to retain his job. Evidently not, as the Wings got a point in a 5-4 overtime loss to the Sharks. Lalonde's future could depend on the Wings' performance over the next six games, five of which are at home starting Thursday against the New York Islanders. A string of losses there could grease the skids for Lalonde's departure. Meanwhile, Jason Mackey of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wondered how long it'll take for Penguins ownership to drop the axe on coach Mike Sullivan. Mackey doesn't consider Sullivan a bad coach but believes the players are unwilling or unable to execute his orders, suggesting they've tuned out their long-time bench boss. The #LetsGoPens suffered a brutal loss last night to the Tampa Bay Lightning, as they blew yet another multi-goal lead in the third period.On what went wrong and what's next for this team ⬇️@TheHockeyNews #THN #NHLhttps://t.co/CVXYfB6Z74 — Kelsey Surmacz (@kelsey_surmacz4) November 20, 2024 In Nashville, the focus is on GM Barry Trotz's efforts to improve the roster rather than Andrew Brunette's coaching. The Hockey News' Rob Couch cited reports claiming Trotz is rigorously searching the trade market for centers. As for the Blues, coach Drew Bannister said his slumping club must find ways to win games. His injury-depleted lineup could give him a longer leash than Lalonde, Sullivan, or Brunette. The Blues have three regular defensemen sidelined – Torey Krug, Nick Leddy and Philip Broberg. Meanwhile, first-line center Robert Thomas only recently returned from being out for a month with a fractured ankle. The Hockey News' Ryan Gagne believes Canadiens coach Martin St-Louis remains safe from the hot seat. Habs management appears willing to stay patient as St-Louis keeps grooming their young players.

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games","Juan Soto Watch: Top suitors, contract projections, latest news and rumors regarding top MLB free agent",https://sports.yahoo.com/juan-soto-watch-top-suitors-201930778.html,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 20:19:30 GMT","The Yankees, Mets, Dodgers, Red Sox, and Blue Jays are among the favorites to land the generational talent.","Juan Soto has dominated the first few weeks of the MLB offseason, and he deserves to do so. Excluding Shohei Ohtani, he’s the most highly sought-after free agent since Alex Rodríguez more than 20 years ago. Like A-Rod, Soto debuted as a teenager. So, he is hitting the open market having just turned 26 years old. That alone makes him a unicorn. Also, he’s had one of the best starts to a career ever. Among players who had played at least 500 games before turning 26, Soto has the third-highest on-base percentage (.421), is tied for the fifth-most home runs (201), and has the seventh-highest OPS (.953). He’s on pace to be a generational talent and this level of player changing teams is completely intoxicating. Below you'll find everything you need to know about Soto's market and where he might end up. Soto will break the proverbial bank this winter. Aaron Judge has the highest average annual value for a position player at $40 million. That feels like a paltry starting point for Soto. There was plenty of hoopla made over Ohtani’s $700 million deal last offseason, but with all of its deferrals the present-day value wound up around $460 million over 10 years. Those two deals will be the benchmarks for Soto’s contract. The question is whether or not he and his agent Scott Boras are dead set on trying to beat the public perception of Ohtani’s $700 million figure. That’s more possible than it may seem since Soto is so young and a team could be willing to offer him an unprecedented 15 or so year contract. Let’s just say 15 years at $45 million per year. That total value would come out to a jaw-dropping $675 million. That feels a bit rich. However, it’s hard to predict the competition of rivals on an open market or any deferrals that might be worked in. This whole situation could easily spiral out of control and the final dollar figure may be staggering. 2024 MLB Free Agency Tracker: Top players, newest signings, biggest contracts, best available, grades Where will Juan Soto, Pete Alonso, and Corbin Burnes sign this offseason?  D.J. Short , D.J. Short , Soto made it clear he would be willing to meet with “every single team” mere moments after the World Series ended. That should have made it extra-clear to the Yankees that there would truly be no frontrunner in this race. So, let’s run down who’s met with him so far. - New York Mets The Mets have emerged as the de facto frontrunners to sign Soto mostly due to Steve Cohen’s deep pockets. Their payrolls have been at or above $300 million for each of the last three years and crescendoed at $375 million in 2023 after the Mets’ last playoff berth. Cohen had the highest offer on the table for Yoshinobu Yamamoto last season before the Dodgers matched it and signed away the Japanese star. He’s already flown west to meet with Soto personally and there’s little doubt he will, once again, outbid the competition. That may be all it takes to woo Soto across town. - New York Yankees The Yankees presumably have the inside track after Soto spent the last year with them and reached the World Series with them. He seemed to revel in being a Yankee and Aaron Judge’s teammate. Those two were the best offensive duo in the league by far, which is a great selling point. He’s obviously declined their qualifying offer and reportedly needed assurances the organization was going to keep adding to their roster. Hal Steinbrenner said their initial meeting went well and that his Yankees were “in the mix” for Soto. - Los Angeles Dodgers No one wants to see this. It would be like Kevin Durant to the Warriors all over again. Yet, the Dodgers have taken an official meeting with Soto and have about $70 million of room under the final Competitive Balance Tax Threshold with gaping holes at corner outfield, middle infield, and in their rotation. Here’s to not spending all your money in one place, Dodgers. - Boston Red Sox Perhaps the Red Sox have learned their lesson after letting Mookie Betts walk out the door and don’t want to let another generational talent slip through their grasp – possibly to their biggest rival – without a fight. They have an elite farm system, enough money to make a serious offer, and took one of the first meetings with Soto. They should be considered a realistic destination. - Toronto Blue Jays Oddly enough, it was reported that the Toronto Blue Jays took one of the first meetings with Soto. They’ve struck out on every high profile free agent in the last few years despite being ‘considered’ by most of them. With deep pockets and a hint of desperation, the Blue Jays could find themselves in this race until the bitter end. - Philadelphia Phillies Jon Heyman of the New York Post reported Thursday that Soto likes the Phillies, though it's unclear if their scheduled meeting has actually taken place yet. Either way, Phillies president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski does not like losing and has been open about his willingness to shake up this roster and spend money after they were embarrassed by the Mets in the NLDS. - San Francisco Giants Aaron Judge left the Giants at the altar two offseasons ago and they’re another team that has been involved with plenty of marquee free agents without ever getting over the hump. Soto would be a serious splash for Buster Posey in his first year as the President of Baseball Operations, but they reportedly haven’t set up a meeting yet. - Chicago Cubs There has been no indication the Cubs are involved in the Soto Sweepstakes and that should sorely disappoint their fans. They spent the same percentage of their revenue on payroll as the Marlins and Mariners last season. That is not where this franchise should be if they are serious about competing for a championship. - The Tampa Bay Rays, apparently Jon Heyman reported a couple of weeks ago that the Rays reached out to Soto's reps, which elicited immediate giggles from the baseball public. They shouldn't be considered a serious suitor, and with the concern over the roof at Tropicana Field and their new ballpark maybe not working out after all, they have much bigger issues at the moment.",2024-11-21

NMcKeown said. 'And you can't have ""white people only"" come into my restaurant, and then you say, ""Well, no, we have a religious, spiritual nature to our restaurant, and when you get there, we serve you special food."" This seems quite different.' Olympus Spa was there appealing this decision from a lower court.  The right response to McKeown's inquiry is that it is correct to say that race and sex are inherent, immutable traits, which the law says cannot be discriminated against. That is the very definition of what makes them protected categories. If we agree that sex is an inherent, protected trait, then a traditional reading of all sexual protection laws suggest an appropriate separation of the two biological sexes in public and private venues, especially involving nudity. Instead of something logical like that with the thousands of case laws readily available, the lawyer goes down some weird trail about ""being welcome"" that the judge immediately shuts down as being the nonsense it is. Some reactions:     Will this case make it to the Supreme Court? Given the opinion Gorsuch delivered in R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes v. EEOC, I have my doubts.

I'll define ""genotoxic"" for you: Toxic (damaging) to DNA. Substances that are genotoxic may bind directly to DNA or act indirectly leading to DNA damage by affecting enzymes involved in DNA replication, thereby causing mutations which may or may not lead to cancer or birth defects. The study was carried out by researchers at the University of Western Australia, and was published in Addiction Biology. According to their findings, exposure to cannabis was associated with a range of cancers - breast, pancreatic, liver, thyroid, testicular and lymphoma - that also develop quickly and are more aggressive. In addition, links to birth defects were found, indicating that cannabis use could cause DNA mutations that pass on to children in utero. ""The link we've described between cannabis use and genotoxicity has far-reaching consequences,"" said Stuart Reece of the University of Western Australia, a co-author of the study. ""This new research shows how genetic damage from cannabis use can be passed down the generations."" Recreational marijuana use is legal in 24 states, 3 U.S. territories and the District of Columbia. While support for further legalization is gaining momentum, Reece added that he hopes the analysis ""reframes the discussion surrounding cannabis legalization from a personal choice to one that potentially involves multiple subsequent generations.""

Not the Bee,Not Satire: Illinois Supreme Court overturns Jussie Smollett's conviction for lying about a hate crime,https://notthebee.com/article/free-at-last-illinois-supreme-court-overturns-jussie-smollett-conviction/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 13:13:52 -0500","<img src=""https://media.notthebee.com/articles/673f6ed26db1e673f6ed26db1f.jpg"" style=""width: 100%;"" width=""400"" /><p>You've gotta be kidding me.</p>","You've gotta be kidding me. This is the stuff they're hearing in the Illinois Supreme Court.   Yes, the convicted hate crime hoaxer, the man who has become known on both sides of the aisle as an actual joke, Jussie Smollett, is getting out of being punished for his crime. The 'Empire' actor was convicted in December 2021 of five felony counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly staging a hate crime against himself in 2019 and was sentenced to 150 days in county jail, plus 30 months of probation and $130,000 in restitution. This happened after the original charges against him were dropped in 2019. He was charged again after a special investigation and spent 6 days in jail before his sentence was suspended, pending appeal. In an opinion released on Thursday, the Illinois Supreme Court found that the special prosecutor's decision to retry Smollett violated his rights. Yeah, apparently the court is arguing that this was a case of double jeopardy and that he couldn't be tried again, even though he never stood trial for the original charges. Let this TV attorney explain the legalese:  'We are aware that this case has generated significant public interest and that many people were dissatisfied with the resolution of the original case and believed it to be unjust,' the court's opinion reads. 'Nevertheless, what would be more unjust than the resolution of any one criminal case would be a holding from this court that the State was not bound to honor agreements upon which people have detrimentally relied.' Yeah. He totally didn't get special treatment because of his celebrity or because he is a gay black guy or because his hoax was designed to stoke hate against Trump supporters. We all know the Illinois Supreme Court would TOTALLY do the same thing for a non-celebrity white guy who lied to paint Democrats in a bad light ... right?Good luck on tracking down the MAGA terrorists, Jussie.

He added that barriers to protect Grindavik, the Blue Lagoon and the nearby Svartsengi Power Plant 'have been effective so far.'

Unlike previous eruptions, there weren't advanced warnings in the day ahead of the fissure reopening. Signs of an eruption only occured about 45 minutes ahead of time. 50 to 60 homes were evacuated and there have been no reports of casualties. It's unclear how long this period of increased activity will last, Gudmundsson said, but he noted that previous episodes suggested volcanic eruptions in the area could be followed by a period of around 100 to 150 years of no volcanic activity.

Logan Paul, brother of Jake Paul (who famously abused Mike Tyson in the ring on Netflix last week), is in some potentially deep trouble for allegedly buying, then promoting online, then selling a cryptocurrency called ""Elongate."" A crypto wallet holding the currency has, according to the BBC, been connected to Paul. From the BBC: The BBC has discovered that shortly before Paul tweeted about a particular crypto coin in 2021, an anonymous crypto wallet with close connections to his public wallet had traded in the coin.That anonymous wallet went on to make a $120,000 (£92,000) profit …The wallet was later paid funds from Maverick Club [Logan Paul's fan club] and held Elongate when Paul promoted it on 10 May 2021.Shortly after, it also traded in another Musk-related meme coin - after Paul had tweeted that it was headed 'to the moon'. In the crypto community, this means someone believes the price of the coin is about to shoot up.About an hour before Paul's tweet, the unknown wallet purchased almost $160,000 (£123,000) worth of the token. The tweet prompted an influx of buyers, spiking the price.Twelve hours later, the wallet sold most of its holding. The total profit made from this trade appears to be just over $120,000 (£92,000).

According to The New York Post, the outgoing administration is rushing to loosen a bunch of immigration policies, with New York City the center of this particular chapter of insanity.  One bright idea is the launch of an ICE Portal app next month that will allow up to 100,000 illegal immigrants to skip in-person check-ins with ICE altogether. With reports that the software is ""glitchy and unreliable.""  Oh, and unlike in-person appointments, the app doesn't even check for criminal history or warrants for arrest. Again, what could possibly go wrong?!   Other policies being pushed under the radar include allowing illegal immigrants to push back against electronic tracking. Because when you're letting in tens of thousands of criminals with outstanding warrants, the last thing a sane government could want is the ability to know where those criminals are. It's obvious at this point we don't have a sane government.

Not only are they spending their time imposing sanctions on Israelis, funding Palestinian terrorists and trying their best to spark all-out-war in Europe, they're now focusing on the big bad wolf of Silicon Valley: Google. On Wednesday, Biden's Justice Department filed a 23-page manifesto asking a judge to rip apart Google's empire, including the sale of Google's Chrome web browser (you know, the one you're probably using to read this article) and to restrict Android phones from favoring Google's own search engine.  According to the DOJ, for the past decade, Google has been squashing competition. This follows a ruling in August by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that Google is a monopolist.  This is the first time in over two decades that a tech company of this size has been declared a monopoly. Ironically, the breakup of Microsoft in 2001 after years of court battles allowed for small startups like Google to seize control of the tech landscape in the aftermath.  Not only does the Justice Department want to stop Google from cutting multi-billion-dollar deals that make its search engine the default on every device - saving us the hassle of having to ask that idiot, Jeeves - they also want Google to open up its search data to rivals. (Because nothing builds competition like handing your competitors one of your biggest successes on a silver platter.) Regulators also want to ban Google from favoring its own products, like YouTube or its new AI platform, Gemini. Because in Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's America, self-promotion is just … not allowed. Right?  Google's legal team, led by Kent Walker, called the proposals ""radical"" and claimed they'd harm Americans and our global tech dominance. According to Walker, the DOJ's proposal would: Endanger the security and privacy of millions of Americans, and undermine the quality of products people love, by forcing the sale of Chrome and potentially Android. Require disclosure to unknown foreign and domestic companies of not just Google's innovations and results, but even more troublingly, Americans' personal search queries. Chill our investment in artificial intelligence, perhaps the most important innovation of our time, where Google plays a leading role. Hurt innovative services, like Mozilla's Firefox, whose businesses depend on charging Google for Search placement. Deliberately hobble people's ability to access Google Search. Mandate government micromanagement of Google Search and other technologies by appointing a ""Technical Committee"" with enormous power over your online experience. ""DOJ's approach would result in unprecedented government overreach that would harm American consumers, developers, and small businesses — and jeopardize America's global economic and technological leadership at precisely the moment it's needed most,"" Walker concluded.

The migrants are mainly from Central and South America.

A Venezuelan member of the Tren de Aragua gang who has been arrested and released in New York City multiple times has been arrested again, this time after attacking and robbing an assistant to the lawless DA Alvin Bragg.  Look at that punk's smile.  This isn't his first arrest and he knows he will be back out again before long. Police say at about 2 a.m. Sunday he robbed a 38-year-old woman in the hallway of her Hell's Kitchen apartment building. He allegedly grabbed her purse, cell phone, and bank cards, and also performed a lewd act. The victim is a Manhattan Assistant DA, she is not injured. That lewd act: He exposed himself to her. I am happy she isn't hurt. However, I hope this helps open her eyes to just exactly what her and her boss's policies and actions are doing to people. They say that a conservative is someone who's been mugged by reality. We'll see if that happens here. The suspect is a migrant and police were able to track him down ... the suspect was using drugs on the street ... police believe he is part of Tren de Aragua ... he also has six prior arrests all from this year on similar crimes and he is believed to have arrived in the US in February of 2023. The man has been in the country for a year and he's been arrested in NYC SIX TIMES in 2024 for the same crimes over and over again. I don't know if we should criticize Bragg's soft-on-crime policy (which applies to everyone except Donald Trump and white Marines who try to save lives) or if we should criticize New York's sanctuary city policy.

Dude was going to blow up the New York Stock Exchange. Luckily, his plan was foiled by the FBI. Even though oftentimes I bash on them, they did their job here, and if they hadn't, who knows what would've happened. A Florida man [Muslim jihadi] was arrested Wednesday and charged with a plot to ‘reboot' the U.S. government by planting a bomb at the New York Stock Exchange this week and detonating it with a remote-controlled device, according to the FBI …  The FBI began investigating Yener in February based on a tip that he was storing ‘bombmaking schematics' in a storage unit. They found bomb-making sketches, many watches with timers, electronic circuit boards and other electronics that could be used for building explosive devices, according to the FBI. He had also searched online for things related to bomb-making since 2017, according to the FBI …In the last month, he had rewired two-way radios so that they could work as remote triggers for an explosive device and planned to wear a disguise when planting the explosives, according to court documents. In the last month, he had rewired two-way radios so that they could work as remote triggers for an explosive device and planned to wear a disguise when planting the explosives, according to court documents. Believe it or not, this dude had a YouTube channel where he posted advice on how to build explosives. (Some free advice for you terrorists out there: Don't ever have a YouTube channel where you teach people how to build explosives.) Yener said he felt ""like Bin Laden."" From CBS 12: Yener planned to wear a disguise when he planted the explosive device outside the building and recorded a message to be delivered to the press about why he did it. The DOJ says Yener anticipated the impact of the explosion would be 'like a small nuke went off' and ""'[a]nything outside"" the building ""will be wiped out'"" and ""anything inside would be killed.'"" The undercover FBI employee gave a microphone to Yener for him to record his 'demand statement' that he intended to send to NBC News the day of or the day after the planned attack, where he said 'I feel like Bin Laden', according to documents. Another interesting tidbit from the AP because we live in a fascinating world with interesting mashups: He was also part of a small group that tried to join the far-right anti-government group the ‘Boogaloo Bois' and extremist group the Proud Boys but was denied membership because he said he wanted ‘to pursue martyrdom,' according to court documents.

	To celebrate Hubie Brown calling it a career, we looked back on how old he was during major events that happened in his lifetime.","Basketball fans are going to see broadcasts get a little worse sooner rather than later. That’s because Hubie Brown, the legendary former coach who has turned into a stalwart on ESPN’s coverage of the league, will only call one more game before he retires at 91 years old. “We are going to give Hubie one last shot on a game,” ESPN president Burke Magnus told Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated. “He deserves that. We think the world of him. I think it is absolutely remarkable the level in which he still calls games at age 90-plus. I don’t mean to be purposely mysterious here but we are going to honor Hubie during the regular season at some point to be determined and send him off in style.” That he is still capable of working at 91 is remarkable, but Brown is still sharp as a tack and as good as it gets calling basketball games, and while no one has deserved retirement more, it’s always a tough day when someone as highly-regarded as him calls it a career. There is, still, no one better at seeing something, pointing it out, and explaining why it’s a big deal than Brown, and he has terrific chemistry with his broadcast partners. We’re all going to miss Hubie, and to celebrate the end of his time in the booth, we wanted to celebrate him by having some fun and looking at everything he’s seen over his extraordinary life. You see, Hubie was born on Sept. 25, 1933, which means he has been around for, quite literally, every single game that the NBA has played — the league was founded in June of 1946, when he was 12 years old. That got us wondering: How old was he during some of the biggest moments in world, American, and NBA history over the last century or so? Let’s dive in. Start of WWII: 5 years old (Sept. 1, 1939)

	ESPN content president Burke Magnus explained that the network's biggest star ending up on its newest property is a bit tricky.","ESPN has about a year to figure out how it’s going to handle Inside the NBA. As part of Warner Bros. Discovery’s deal to remain in the NBA’s media ecosystem, it was announced that Turner will continue to produce Inside, but license it out to ESPN, which solves the network’s longstanding issues trying to put together a pregame, halftime, and postgame NBA show that viewers enjoy. An unsurprising question that popped up after this was whether Stephen A. Smith — who is in the middle of some high-profile contract negotiations with ESPN — would find a way onto the show. Smith is the guy ESPN has built its NBA coverage around, and while that has come under plenty of criticism, he’s famously close with the Inside crew and has appeared on it in the past. But apparently, as of now, the network doesn’t have any intetion of putting Stephen A. on their newest property. “We have no plans to do that,” ESPN content president Burke Magnus told Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated. “And that’s because, frankly, the construct of the deal really doesn’t — that’s not how it was conceived. What is conceived is that Turner, as they have always done with this show, with this cast, with the people involved behind the scenes, are going to continue to do what they’ve always done. And we’re going to distribute it on the ESPN platform. Frankly, that’s exactly what we want. We don’t want to change it. We don’t want to interject new talent into it. We don’t want to really do anything to it.” It is worth mentioning that the scuttlebutt around Smith’s contract negotiations revolves around him wanting to do more NFL stuff for ESPN, but considering how big Inside is and his relationship with the guys, it is fair to wonder if he’d want to have any sort of presence on the show as part of a new deal (if, of course, he comes to terms with the network on one). For now, the complexities of the deal with Turner gives ESPN a way to say they have no plans of putting him on Inside in any capacity, but we’ll certainly be waiting to see if that changes as Smith and ESPN sit down at the negotiating table.

(Credit: X /Bill Carl Johnson) Just hours after voting to finance repairs to the home stadium of the Tampa Bay Rays, the St. Petersburg City Council reversed course.  The Rays will now pay the division rival New York Yankees $15 million to play their home regular-season games at New York's spring training ballpark. That is now the only certain home the Rays will have until further notice.  The stadium's fiberglass roof was ripped clean off Oct. 9 when Hurricane Milton swept ashore just south of Tampa Bay. Then came the destructive water damage inside the venue, causing an estimated $55.7 million in damage. The extensive repairs cannot be finished before the 2026 season, city documents show. The city at least would have supplied some funding and started the process with its initial vote, which was a 4-3 decision.

Once that was done, crews would begin working on laying down a new baseball field and fixing damaged seating and office areas and a variety of electronic systems, which would require another vote to approve money for the remaining restoration.

Just two days earlier, the Pinellas County Commission postponed a vote on its share of the new stadium bonds, leaving that project in limbo. ""This is a sad place. I’m really disappointed,"" council Chair Deborah Figg-Sanders said. ""We won’t get there if we keep finding ways we can’t.""

NCAA President Charlie Baker said earlier this year the NCAA is trying to modify ""draconian"" penalties college athletes face for breaking rules regarding betting on sports. The topic drew headlines last year in two prominent cases. About two dozen Iowa State and Iowa athletes were criminally charged after a state investigation into illegal sports wagering. Some charges were dropped after investigators were found to have misused tracking software that detected open mobile betting apps in Iowa State athletic buildings. TRANS VOLLEYBALL PLAYER LEGAL HEARING OPENED WITH LONG AND HEATED DEBATE OVER WHAT PRONOUNS TO USE Earlier this year, former NBA player Jontay Porter, who was issued a lifetime ban from the NBA due to gambling, pleaded guilty to his role in the scheme that led to his punishment. Porter pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and faces over four years in jail. Porter received a lifetime ban April 17 after the NBA found in an investigation that he had disclosed confidential information to sports bettors and bet on games in violation of league rules. The NBA prohibits players from betting on the league or any of its properties. The league said an investigation discovered before ""the [Toronto] Raptors’ March 20 game, [Jontay] disclosed confidential information about his own health status to an individual he knew to be an NBA bettor.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. To nobody’s surprise, Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani were named the AL and NL MVPs Thursday, each receiving all 30 first-place votes. He may not have broken his single-season home run record he set during his 2022 MVP season, but the New York Yankees captain was once again dominant at the plate to receive his second career nod as the MVP in the American League. Judge beat out Juan Soto, who he hopes to play with again in 2025 in pinstripes, and Kansas City Royals phenom Bobby Witt Jr., who received all 30 second-place votes. Judge led the league in homers for the third time in his career, launching 58 long balls while posting league highs in WAR (10.8), RBIs (144), slugging percentage (.701), on-base percentage (.458) and OPS+ (223).

Soto had 41 homers and 109 RBIs. Judge’s postseason production was much different, but this is a regular-season award. The slugger had trouble finding a rhythm despite the Yankees reaching the World Series. He slashed .184/.344/.408 with three homers and nine RBIs over 14 games. The New York Yankees' Aaron Judge reacts after hitting a grand slam off Boston Red Sox relief pitcher Cam Booser during the seventh inning of a game Sept. 13, 2024, in New York.  (AP Photo/Adam Hunger) Ohtani inked a record-shattering $700 million deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers in the offseason and underwent elbow surgery prior to the start of the 2024 campaign, forcing him off the mound the entire season. At the start of the season, he found himself in a gambling scandal in which millions had been smuggled from him by his interpreter to pay off betting debts. It was eventually determined Ohtani did not know about the gambling, nor did he bet himself. CHRIS SALE, TARIK SKUBAL EARN FIRST CAREER CY YOUNG AWARDS Fans wondered if he would be able to have an MVP-type season strictly as a DH.  The Dodgers superstar became the first player in MLB history to hit 50 home runs and steal 50 bases in the same season. The home run ball that made history sold for a record $4.39 million. His 134 runs scored and 411 total bases were the most in the majors, and he led the National League in home runs (54), RBIs (130), on-base percentage (.390), slugging percentage (646) and a 9.2 bWAR.  His .310 average in the NL was second behind only Luis Arráez's .314, and his 59 stolen bases trailed only Elly De La Cruz, who swiped five more bags.

Former NBA coach and longtime broadcaster Hubie Brown is in his final season calling NBA games, ESPN’s Content President Burke Magnus announced.  ""We are going to give Hubie one last shot on a game,"" Magnus said of the 91-year-old Brown on the ""SI Media with Jimmy Traina"" podcast.  ""He deserves that. We think the world of him. I think it’s absolutely remarkable the level he still calls games at age 90-plus.""

He joined the Grizzlies in 2002, 16 years after his previous coaching job with the Knicks, though he left the job 12 games into the 2004-05 season for medical reasons.  From there, Brown returned to broadcasting again, joining ABC for its coverage of the league, which included calling the 2005 and 2006 NBA Finals.

President Biden hosted the 2024 NBA champion Boston Celtics at the White House on Thursday, but he was either not completely sure of that or making a joke. While announcing the team's latest championship, Biden turned to the team to make sure they were called the Celtics.  ""You're the Celtics, right?"" Biden asked the players during a moment in his address. The comment was met with light but reserved chuckles from some in the crowd.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Biden also joked that he didn't know where the players came from. ""They just showed up. I don’t know where the hell they came from,"" Biden said.  Later in the speech, Biden appeared to reveal his Secret Service code name. ""Celtic"" has been Biden's code name throughout his presidency and even dating back to his vice presidency under President Obama, according to Britannica.   ""All of you may not know this, but my Secret Service name is ‘Celtic.’ For real, because I’m Irish,"" Biden said.

The Patriots accepted both invitations in 2017 and 2019. The Eagles' visit was canceled, and the team released a statement saying it was in relation to Trump's stance on players standing for the national anthem. During Trump's first term, and even during his recent campaign, college football has been the sport to embrace him the most in the U.S. His appearances at games, including multiple Army-Navy games during his first term and a Georgia-Alabama game in September, were met with rousing applause.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Trans volleyball player legal hearing opened with long and heated debate over what pronouns to use,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trans-volleyball-player-legal-hearing-opened-long-heated-debate-over-what-pronouns-use,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 16:33:52 -0500",The first 45 minutes of a hearing over a trans athlete&apos;s eligibility to play women&apos;s volleyball were dedicated to a debate on pronouns and identity.,"San Jose State University's women's volleyball co-captain Brooke Slusser says she is standing up for herself and her team on 'The Ingraham Angle' as sports journalist Michele Tafoya reacts. Who/what would have thought something so simple would take so long?  The athletic eligibility of San Jose State's volleyball team and trans athlete Blaire Fleming came under legal review on Thursday during an emergency hearing in Colorado. But it couldn't get started before a lengthy discussion on whether to use she/her pronouns when referring to Fleming.  Federal Judge Kato Crews, who was appointed by President Biden in January, dedicated the first 45 minutes of the hearing to a debate between the plaintiffs and defendants over what pronouns to use when describing Fleming and whether Fleming's name should be used during the hearing for the sake of privacy. Nearly an hour into the hearing, Crews declared that he would choose to use she/her pronouns, but that any other individual in the courtroom could use whatever pronouns they wanted to use. Crews also clarified that his decision to the she/her pronouns when referring to Fleming did not reflect his decision on what Fleming's biological gender is.  Crews also ruled that it was okay to use Fleming's name during the hearing.  ""While the court is not insensitive to the privacy issues ... the defendants have essentially affirmed there is a transgender player on the SJSU volleyball team,"" Crews said.  THE PRONOUN POLICE HAVE ARRIVED AND ARE COMING FOR YOU NEXT  Blaire Fleming of the San Jose State Spartans reacts during the second set against the Air Force Falcons at Falcon Court at East Gym on October 19, 2024, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  (Andrew Wevers/Getty Images) The verbal implementation of official pronouns when referring to individuals to avoid ""misgendering"" them has, in fact, been tied to legal repercussions in the U.S. in recent years.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) rolled out a new gender pronoun policy in November 2023. ""All applicants and employees should be addressed by the names and pronouns they use to describe themselves. Using correct names and pronouns helps foster workplaces free of discrimination and harassment,"" the U.S. Office of Personnel Management guidance states. ""This practice also creates an inclusive work environment where all applicants and employees are treated with dignity. The isolated and inadvertent use of an incorrect name or pronoun will generally not constitute unlawful harassment, but, as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has explained, continued intentional use of an incorrect name or pronoun (or both) could, in certain circumstances, contribute to an unlawful hostile work environment."" Heritage Foundation expert and former HHS official Roger Severino previously told Fox News Digital that the laws violate employee rights and will result in firings for ""misgendering."" SJSU WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL'S 1ST OPPONENT DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT TRASN PLAYER, SUGGESTS MATCH WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED Official and proper pronoun usage has been at the center of mockery and satire by right-wing figures in politics and media, including President-elect Trump, in recent years.  After liberal social media influencer and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. was discovered to have removed pronouns from her X bio after Trump's election win, the congresswoman became the subject of a viral mockery campaign by conservative and satirical users.  Former NCAA swimmer and OutKick contributor Riley Gaines didn't let Ocasio-Cortez off the hook in a tirade of insults on X on November 14.  ""How will we know what to call AOC now that her pronouns in her bio are gone?!"" Gaines wrote.  And thus, a hearing on the situation with Fleming and San Jose State, which has recently become a landmark event in the civil rights discussion around women's sports, fittingly included a pronoun debate for the ages.  The hearing came in response to a recent lawsuit filed against the Mountain West Conference for its policies on gender eligibility and identity. The plaintiffs, including multiple Mountain West volleyball players and Utah State University, contested the conference's policies that have let San Jose State player Blaire Fleming compete, despite being a biological male. San Jose State finished the regular season with a 14-6 record and a 12-6 conference record. Six of its conference wins came via forfeit by opposing teams amid the controversy. Those include forfeits from conference opponents Boise State, Utah State, Wyoming and Nevada. Wyoming and Boise State have each forfeited two matches against the Spartans.  The plaintiffs on Thursday were seeking to have the losses that those teams took for the forfeit be erased from their record and not counted against them in qualifying for the Mountain West Tournament. The plaintiffs were also seeking to prevent SJSU from rostering Fleming in any future games, including the upcoming tournament. Fleming has been one of the top players in the conference and an offensive anchor for San Jose State this season, even amid the controversy. Fleming is third in the conference in average kills per serve with 3.86 and amassed 297 total kills on the year despite playing seven fewer games than expected due to the forfeits. It's helped give San Jose State the third best hitting percentage in the Mountain West.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Blaire Fleming of the San Jose State Spartans attempts to block a shot during the first set against the Air Force Falcons at Falcon Court at East Gym on October 19, 2024, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  (Andrew Wevers/Getty Images) A Mountain West spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday that the conference is currently planning for San Jose State and Fleming to compete in the tournament in Las Vegas, starting November 27. That spokesperson also says the conference has a contingency plan in the event teams refuse to face San Jose State over Fleming's presence on the team.  That plan includes a willingness to recognize San Jose State as the conference champion if the Spartans advance to the final and win the match by virtue of forfeit from opponents.  ""If we get to a championship game, and it's San Jose State vs. whoever, if that institution forfeits the game, then San Jose State wins that match, and then they are tournament champions. And they would be the automatic qualifier out of the Mountain West,"" the spokesperson said.  However, Crews' eventual ruling could disrupt that plan and keep Fleming out of the tournament altogether. Crews concluded the hearing by saying he will deliver a ruling on the case in a ""timely fashion.""

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,"Daniel Jones bids farewell to Giants, shoulders blame for team's struggles: 'I’m 100% accountable for my part'",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/daniel-jones-bids-farewell-giants-shoulders-blame-teams-struggles-im-100-accountable-my-part,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 16:19:10 -0500","Daniel Jones spoke to media for the first time since his demotion, and before taking questions, he issued a statement thanking the Giants and apologizing for his part in their struggle.","Emmanuel Acho reacts to the New York Giants' decision to bench Daniel Jones and start Tommy DeVito.  Daniel Jones isn’t used to just sitting back and watching at New York Giants practices, but after being demoted coming out of the bye week, he understands his time as Big Blue’s franchise quarterback has come to an end after six seasons.  This certainly is not how Jones, the No. 6 overall pick of the 2019 NFL Draft, wanted his Giants tenure to end – a lost 2-8 season where his play has not justified him starting the rest of the year.  But head coach Brian Daboll made it official, with Tommy DeVito elevated into the starting role and Jones moved all the way back to QB4 with the team bringing in veteran Tim Boyle.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones during the Carolina Panthers game, Nov. 10, 2024, in Munich, Germany. (AP Photo/Lennart Preiss) Speaking for the first time since the move, Jones gave an opening statement to media members at the team’s facility in East Rutherford, New Jersey, where he was nothing but a class act.   ""The opportunity to play for the New York Giants was truly a dream come true,"" Jones began. ""I’m extremely grateful to the Mara and Tisch families for the chance to play here. The Giants are truly a first-class organization, and I have nothing but genuine respect and appreciation for the people who have built it and the people who carry on that tradition.  ""I take full responsibility for my part in not bringing more wins. No one wanted to win more games worse than me, and I gave everything I had on the field and in my preparation. Of course, this season has been disappointing for all and of course I wish I could’ve done more. I’m 100% accountable for my part. I did not play well enough, consistently enough to help the team get the results. The reality of the NFL is it’s hard to win games and requires consistent performance from everyone involved. We didn’t do that well enough, so the idea to change something happens and I understand. GIANTS LEGEND VICTOR CRUZ POSES BIG ARCH MANNING QUESTION AS FRANCHISE GETS SET FOR QUARTERBACK SEARCH ""I love the game, I love being a part of the team, and I’m excited for the next opportunity. I know there’s a lot of good football in front of me and I’m excited about that. To all the fans, I have deep respect for your passion and love for the Giants. The fans are a huge part of what makes playing for the Giants so special."" The writing was on the wall for Jones after his mishaps against the Carolina Panthers in Munich, Germany were the last straws for Daboll, GM Joe Schoen and the rest of the organization.  Jones said that conversations were had between Schoen and his agents, where the Giants’ GM explained what the move was going to be. And Jones wasn’t going to be backing up DeVito, as he has a $23 million injury guarantee built into his contract that would come into effect if he were to get hurt.  That’s why the Giants brought in Boyle and are keeping Jones far away from anything that could possibly lead to an injury. Usually in these cases – look at the Las Vegas Raiders with Derek Carr – teams will allow the player to simply stay home and prepare for what’s to come with their next team. For now, Jones is ""still kinda processing"" and wants to help. New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones passes against the Washington Commanders, Nov. 3, 2024, in East Rutherford, New Jersey. (AP Photo/John Munson) ""I’m doing the best I can to help Tommy prepare, help the team prepare and that’s what I’m going to do right now. Processing that, I think the decision was made and not playing,"" Jones said.  As for that injury guarantee, Jones didn’t say so directly, but it sounded like he was trying any way to stay on the field for the Giants. He was asked if he would waive the injury guarantee to get back on the field. ""I want to play. I want to be on the field,"" he said. ""I think I tried to do as much as I could to make that possible and create a situation where we were both comfortable, but most of those discussions went on with my agent and with Joe. I want to play, I want to be on the field, but it’s an unfortunate business side of the game. ""I got the injury guarantee, so that’s that and I understand it. They don’t want to take any risk. So, yeah, at that point it’s just do as you’re told."" Despite his efforts, Jones will continue to sit in the back during practice sessions, and help out wherever he can. But he, like everyone else, knows his NFL future is elsewhere, which is emotional, especially when he hears the support from his teammates.  New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones attends a news conference after a practice session in Munich, Germany, Nov. 8, 2024.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James has taken a break from social media ""for the time being,"" and many have shared their own opinions about this course of action by the NBA’s all-time leading scorer.  It also led to some defending of James, which came in the form of former ESPN employee Jemele Hill.  Hill applauded James’ move, which he had posted on X, by saying that ""Twitter has become largely untenable. Selfishly, I hope he deactivates his account."" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James (John E. Sokolowski-Imagn Images) That led to an argument in the comments under Hill’s post, with one user saying, ""I think being a sore loser and having to actually engage uncensored oppositional politics really annoys the left. It’s a soft move."" Hill answered by saying, ""You all are under the twisted belief that subjecting yourself to constant vitriol and engaging with a—holes is some kind of badge of honor."" JEMELE HILL SAYS NICK BOSA LACKS ‘GUTS’ TO EXPLAIN TRUMP SUPPORT, CITES LEBRON JAMES' ‘IN DETAIL’ HARRIS NOD ""This app is at an all-time low,"" Hill added. ""It’s full of racists, conspiracy theorists and jerks. If that’s what y’all consider intellectually stimulating, God help you."" One X user agreed with Hill, commenting that he has an ""easy answer"" to those who you don’t wish to hear from on the app – ""the block button."" The X user also said ""there is a stigma that those who lean left are snowflakes,"" which Hill responded to.  ""What I find funny is that the people who throw around that ‘snowflake’ term are the weakest folks,"" she replied. ""Sorry, it’s not ‘challenging ideology’ calling somebody a c--- 100 times a day. And [Elon] Musk also changed the block features on the platform, too. And again, nobody owes you engagement."" Hill has defended James recently when it came to the presidential election as well, where she blasted San Francisco 49ers star Nick Bosa for his lack of explanation in wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" hat in support of President-elect Donald Trump prior to Election Day. Jemele Hill (YouTube) James had provided details about why he supported Vice President Harris in the election, saying that ""having a daughter, having a wife, having a mother and things of that nature, what (Harris) believes in when it comes to women’s rights, that’s what the future with my kids and where I see our country should be."" Hill used James’ detailed answer on why he was voting for Harris to blast Bosa.  ""Oh look, LeBron was asked about a public political statement that he made and he explained IN DETAIL why he did it. Nick Bosa doesn’t have the guts to do this,"" she said. James’ time off from social media came after he shared the screenshot of a lengthy X post from NBA agent Rich Kleiman, who ripped national sports coverage for its negativity. ""We can all acknowledge that sports is the last part of society that universally brings people together. So why can’t the coverage do the same? It’s only click bait when you say it,"" Kleiman wrote at the time. ""When the platform is so big, you can make the change and allow us all an escape from real life negativity. I for one find it all a waste of breath. The Olympics and JJ [Redick] and Bron’s show was the future of what this can and should all be.""

The Memphis Grizzlies guard hit a three-pointer against the Philadelphia 76ers en route to a win – which made Philly 2-12 to start the season.

Four days earlier, Morant had allegedly ""threatened"" the head of security at a Memphis mall, and a member of Morant's group allegedly shoved him in the head.  In the 2022-23 season, the Indiana Pacers claimed that after an altercation between associates of Morant and the Pacers, a red laser was pointed at the team from an SUV that was carrying Morant, which the Pacers believed was a gun.

The quarterback was initially the top recruit in the class of 2026 but was reclassified to the 2025 class in January. Lewis, 6-foot-1, 195 pounds, is in line to succeed Shedeur Sanders as Colorado’s current quarterback, as Sanders is set to be a top pick in the 2025 NFL Draft.  ""Of course, it was big for me just coming in after Shedeur, just seeing what he’s done to Colorado and what he’s turned it into.

(John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports/File) Lewis said part of the reason for choosing Colorado is that Deion Sanders said that the best players are going to play, giving Lewis potentially the chance to start as a freshman.  Colorado securing Lewis’ commitment means the Buffaloes are unlikely to aggressively recruit somebody through the transfer portal.  Sanders' name has been in NFL head coaching rumors, but Lewis' commitment signals that Colorado's head coach might not be departing for the NFL anytime soon.   Lewis is from Carrollton, Georgia, and recently had an unofficial visit to the Georgia Bulldogs, along with showing interest in Indiana before committing to Colorado.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Carrollton Trojans quarterback Julian Lewis has committed to the Colorado Buffaloes.

""We continue to grieve the loss of three beloved members of our community and the injuries suffered by others on the bus,"" Ryan’s statement added. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Within days of the shooting, university leaders asked for an outside review to investigate the school’s safety policies and procedures, its response to the violence and its prior efforts to assess the potential threat of the student charged. School officials acknowledged Jones previously was on the radar of the university’s threat-assessment team. In June, Kimberly Wald, a lawyer representing some of the victims and their families, announced that the university agreed to pay $9 million in a settlement. Wald said the university should have removed Jones from campus before the attack because he displayed multiple red flags through erratic and unstable behavior.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Giants legend Victor Cruz poses big Arch Manning question as franchise gets set for quarterback search,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/giants-legend-victor-cruz-poses-big-arch-manning-question-franchise-gets-set-quarterback-search,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 11:05:29 -0500","As the New York Giants begin another franchise quarterback journey after the benching of Daniel Jones, franchise legend Victor Cruz wonders if Arch Manning in 2026 is the target.","Giants legendary receiver Victor Cruz reacts after his former team benched Daniel Jones, while asking the Arch Manning question for a franchise in search of a new QB. The Daniel Jones Era in East Rutherford, New Jersey, has all but officially come to an end, as the New York Giants have benched their franchise quarterback with the expectation that they will opt out of his contract following what has been a tumultuous 2024 season.  Head coach Brian Daboll confirmed the reports that Jones was moved to third string and Tommy DeVito, who has been in that position all season, was vaulted to starting quarterback. DeVito won three games as a starter last season with Jones and Tyrod Taylor both hurt.  But DeVito likely isn't the future at quarterback for the Giants, despite being a fan favorite. That leaves Daboll, general manager Joe Schoen and the rest of the organization scrambling back into the war room to figure out the age-old question for any NFL team: Where can we find a franchise quarterback? CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones watches during the second half of an NFL football game against the Carolina Panthers, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Munich, Germany.  (AP Photo/Lennart Preiss) There are a few schools of thought, but Giants legend Victor Cruz has another question that will be answered in due time.  How badly do the Giants want Arch Manning – the nephew of the man who used to throw Cruz passes that led to his salsa touchdown celebrations, Eli Manning. ""Well, it’s interesting, right? I’ve already done this little mental deep dive on this,"" Cruz told Fox News Digital about the Giants' quarterback situation, while also discussing his partnership with Captain Morgan. ""So, the question is, if I’m a Giants GM, if I’m John Mara, if I’m those guys up top, do I want Arch Manning?"" GIANTS STAR DEXTER LAWRENCE ADMITS FEELING A ‘BIT OF CONFUSION’ WITH DANIEL JONES BENCHING: ‘HE’S THE QB1' Arch is a sophomore in the Texas Longhorns' football program, but he has yet to be a starter with Quinn Ewers running Steve Sarkisian's offense the past two seasons, including 2024.  However, the expectation is Arch will take his place as the next great Manning in the NFL at the quarterback position, and he's already shown flashes of what he can do this season when he had to take over for an injured Ewers.  So, while some Giants fans will expect a rookie quarterback to be drafted with a high pick – the Giants currently own the fourth overall pick if the season ended today – Cruz thinks this is the question that needs to be answered first in pursuit of the next great Giants quarterback.  Former New York Giant, Victor Cruz, interacts with the fans at MetLife Stadium, November 26, 2023. (IMAGN) ""Is it a thing where we have a stopgap year, where we just draft talent, we draft guys, we build our roster? And then the following year, you got to do everything you can to get Arch Manning,"" he detailed. ""Trade up, trade down, trade left, trade right. You gotta figure out how to get Arch Manning, if that’s what you want, because he’s going to put butts in the seats, he’s gonna have the Manning aura around him, which obviously New York fans know and love very well. ""Is it a stopgap year, and we go get Arch, or is it Shedeur [Sanders] or is it Cam Ward, which I love both of those guys, and I wouldn’t be mad if those guys were wearing blue next season as well?"" Sanders, the son of Deion Sanders, has shined for the Colorado Buffaloes, while Miami's Cam Ward consistently leads his team to victory even in the face of adversity, a quality Cruz likes to see from a quarterback.  Those two are expected to be among the top quarterbacks taken in the 2025 Draft, while Arch won't be able to declare until the following year. Ewers will also come out of Texas this year, making way for Arch to be the sole starter in Austin, where many believe his draft stock as a high first-rounder will be cemented. Arch Manning #16 of the Texas Longhorns scrambles in the third quarter against the Texas Tech Red Raiders at Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium on November 24, 2023 in Austin, Texas.  (Tim Warner/Getty Images) ""I think he’s also a baller,"" Cruz said of Arch. ""I think he’s faster than any Manning we’ve seen thus far. We can throw it, he has that thing about him, and I think he’s a great player."" There's no doubt the Giants' quarterbacks room will be vastly different in 2025, but the organization must figure out what the right move is in terms of filling it. Giving Arch the opportunity to follow down his uncle's path would likely mean having another down season to secure a high draft pick, or trading away a bunch of other picks to move up for the opportunity to take him.  And what's not to say Arch doesn't stay for his senior season in 2026, opting to come out for the 2027 Draft instead? To counteract that possibility, do the Giants simply use the top pick they're expected to have this year to grab a rookie quarterback, perhaps bring in a veteran as well, and hope they can compete again in 2025? It's never a thought any team wants to have heading into Week 12 of the season, but at 2-8 following the bye week, and the evaluation of Jones resulting in his benching, the Giants have to be thinking about what to do next even with a few games left on the slate.  Victor Cruz believes the Giants have a big Arch Manning question to answer in terms of their quarterback of the future. (IMAGN) GETTING CREATIVE WITH CAPTAIN MORGAN While Cruz is trying to answer the Giants’ quarterback question, he’s also excited about his latest collaboration with Captain Morgan, specifically what he and fashion designer KidSuper cooked up as part of the company’s ""Follow the Captain"" scavenger hunt.  Cruz discussed how much fun he had creating a crewneck sweater with KidSuper that pays homage to his trademark touchdown dance.  ""Our crewnecks are dropping with myself, Captain Morgan, KidSuper. [The crewnecks] definitely embody my style, like my swagger, got the little salsa love on there as well,"" Cruz said. ""I’m definitely excited about this one, not just for people to go out there and see it and wear it and purchase it, but to just be part of the crew. I think getting this crewneck makes you part of the squad, part of the team. So, when you see me outside, and you’re rocking your crewneck, and I’m rocking mine, it just brings it all together and brings that team atmosphere together.""

President-elect Donald Trump's new secretary of Education, Linda McMahon, is not exactly the school librarian type.  As the wife of WWE founder Vince McMahon, Linda has been heavily involved in the wrestling entertainment product for decades, much like Trump himself. She even led the WWE organization as CEO.  The new executive branch Cabinet member was even the recipient of violent wrestling moves during WWE events decades ago.  Clips of McMahon's body slams have resurfaced across social media in the days since the announcement of her appointment.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM In one event, Glenn Thomas Jacobs, also known as ""Kane,"" hit the new Education secretary with a tombstone piledriver that knocked her, apparently, unconscious on an episode of ""Monday Night Raw"" in the early 2000s.  In one of WWE's more infamous sagas of the era, she was featured in a series of skits that saw her hit her children, Stephanie and Shane McMahon. In some of those skits, her children hit back.  McMahon served on the Connecticut Board of Education for a year starting in 2009. She told lawmakers at the time that she had a lifelong interest in education and once planned to become a teacher.

Former NCAA swimmer and conservative activist Riley Gaines shared the story of her marriage with fellow former University of Kentucky swimmer Louis Barker, who is originally from England, in a recent TikTok. Barker and Gaines were both swimmers while in college. Gaines joined the University of Kentucky's swim team and made the All-SEC freshman Team in 2019. She was also on the All-SEC Second Team in 2019 and 2020. Barker participated in the British Olympic Trials qualifier in 2016. Then in 2018, Barker participated in the 2018 Commonwealth Games Trials qualifier. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The two dated for two years, between 2019 and 2021. In December 2021, Barker proposed to Gaines, which she announced on social media. They were married in May 2022 in Nashville, Tennessee.  Now, Gaines, who has spoken out against illegal immigration and Vice President Harris for her poor handling of the border crisis, shared that her and her husband have been dealing with immigration issues themselves in recent years. Gaines says Barker, despite coming into the country legally, has not been able to attain citizenship or even a green card yet, despite the fact that the couple has been married for two years.  ""Maybe you think you think he's well on his way to the U.S. citizen, and you would be wrong. After two and a half years of marriage, he still doesn't have his green card,"" Gaines said. Gaines says the couple received a letter in the mail. The reason Barker has not been granted citizenship is that he does not have the COVID-19 vaccine.  ""Think about how hard our government has made it for people migrating into this country legally in comparison to those who break the law. Because if you just walk across the southern border, you're given housing, a driver's license, money."" RILEY GAINES REPEATEDLY TEARS INTO AOC FOR TAKING PRONOUNS OUT OF X BIO AFTER ADVOCATING FOR TRANS ATHLETES Elon Musk reposed Gaines' TikTok video on X with a message advocating for legal immigration reform. Musk himself is also a legal immigrant from South Africa who has also spoken in favor of immigration reform in the U.S. Musk has also denied a Washington Post report that alleges the tech billionaire began his career working in the U.S. illegally.  ""Legal immigration to America is ridiculously slow and difficult, even for super talented people. Needs to be fixed,"" Musk wrote.  Musk moved to Canada at 18 and got citizenship there via his mother and, a few years later, studied at the University of Pennsylvania.  U.S. immigration law requires immigrant visa applicants to obtain certain vaccinations prior to the issuance of an immigrant visa. The COVID-19 vaccine was added to that list under the Biden-Harris administration. Panel physicians who conduct medical examinations of immigrant visa applicants are required to verify that immigrant visa applicants have met the vaccination requirements, or that it is medically inappropriate for the visa applicant to receive one or more of the listed vaccinations.  Former competitive swimmer Riley Gaines speaks during a campaign rally for Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump at Desert Diamond Arena on Aug. 23, 2024 in Glendale, Arizona. (Rebecca Noble/Getty Images) However, none of this applies to people who sneak into the country illegally.  Gaines previously spoke out against illegal immigration in a social media spat with Mark Cuban.  After Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) released data to lawmakers in September revealing that tens of thousands of illegal immigrants with sex offenses and homicide convictions have crossed the border into the U.S. under the Biden-Harris administration, including 13,099 convicted of homicide and 15,811 of sexual assault, Gaines took aim at Cuban for suggesting Harris did a ""good job"" handling the border.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""We might have different standards for what qualifies as a 'good job,' but I don’t think the illegal entrance of 15,000+ rapists, 13,000+ murderers, and 320,000 missing children fits the bill,"" Gaines on X in response to Cuban.  Gaines' reference to the 320,000 missing children was from another report from the Department of Homeland Security released Aug. 21 that revealed the Biden-Harris administration had lost track of that number of migrant children who crossed the border without parents.  Meanwhile, ICE Boston announced on Wednesday the arrests of two illegal immigrants who have been charged with forcibly raping children in Massachusetts, as well as a third individual who was convicted of raping a child in Brazil, and was hiding in the U.S. after being caught and released at the U.S. border in 2022.

Purdy started to throw in practice, but stopped to get worked on by a trainer after just a few minutes — and then his scheduled media availability got pushed back to Friday. “He was still limited today,” 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan told KNBR Thursday afternoon. “He didn’t do as much yesterday but did a little bit more today. He went out there and did a little bit then went back in about halfway through and rested up. Hopefully, it will be feeling great on Sunday.” After surveying the scene, Cam Inman, a 49ers beat reporter for the Bay Area News Group, labeled Purdy’s status for Sunday’s game against the Packers as “growing grim.” Veteran backups Brandon Allen and Josh Dobbs are behind Purdy on the 49ers’ depth chart. The 49ers fell to 5-5 after losing to their division-rival Seahawks last week, and are already one loss away from hitting their preseason under total on the year.  Prior to practice on Thursday, NFL Media’s Tom Pelissero had been confident that Purdy would play Sunday. “Brock Purdy, from everything I’ve been told, should be fine for this game on Sunday against the Packers,” Pelissero told “Rich Eisen Show” guest host Mike Hill. “He’s got a sore shoulder. I know he dove—I’m not sure if that’s the play—but he dove for the pylon in the game last week, might have landed on it a little bit. But it’s not anything that’s like a major injury. Star pass rusher Nick Bosa and left tackle Trent Williams also missed practice for the 49ers on Thursday.

Answering questions Thursday for the first time since he was demoted earlier this week to end a disappointing six-year run as the starter, Jones essentially said goodbye to the Giants.  But he stopped short of admitting that he might leave the team before the end of the season. Jones appears to be behind new starter Tommy DeVito, backup Drew Lock and even new practice-squad addition Tim Boyle on the depth chart because the Giants do not want to risk playing him and activating the $23 million injury guarantee in his contract. “I’m still processing … how this decision was made and not playing,” Jones said, his voice cracking at times over the course of 11 minutes. “For now, I’m doing the best I can to help Tommy and the team prepare.” The normally unflappable Jones opened by reading from a 90-second prepared statement during which he thanked owners, teammates, coaches, fans and staff.  He used the past tense when he said “the opportunity to play for the Giants was truly a dream come true.” “There have been some great times, but, of course, we all wish there had been more of those,” Jones said. “I take full responsibility for my part in not bringing more wins. No one wanted to win those games worse than me. I gave everything I had.” Jones’ practice workload Thursday included slipping on a pinny and lining up as a scout-team safety during offensive install periods.  It’s not unusual for offensive players who are not playing Sunday to lend a hand in that walking/jogging situation, but it is unusual for a $160 million investment to be reduced to it. Why is Jones not merely the No. 2 quarterback? Start with the clause that if Jones cannot pass a physical by March, then the Giants’ dead-salary-cap charge for cutting him jumps from $22.2 million to $45.2 million — a nightmare for general manager Joe Schoen. “I have the injury guarantee, so that’s that,” Jones said. “They don’t want to take any risks. At that point, it’s just do as you’re told.” Whether the Giants give permission to Jones, 27, to return home or release him really is the only remaining question.  He declined to say if he will ask for his release or whether the Giants asked him to waive his injury guarantee before benching him. Derek Carr left the Raiders but Russell Wilson stayed with the Broncos in past similar situations tied to injury guarantees. “I wanted to play badly,” Jones said. “I think I tried to do as much as I could to make that possible and create a situation where we were both comfortable. Most of those discussions went on with my agent and Joe. I want to be on the field, but it’s the unfortunate business side of the game.” For salary-cap purposes, there is essentially no difference between releasing Jones today or any other day before March 12, when the new league year begins.  The Giants could gain a small amount of immediate salary-cap space by cutting Jones because his salary offsets and a new team would pay him the league minimum. But the Giants (2-8) run a potentially embarrassing risk of Jones signing with a team on their schedule and beating them head-to-head over the final seven games — like if he joined the Cowboys and supplanted Cooper Rush before Thanksgiving or teamed with Saquon Barkley on the Eagles and played in Week 18 as their starters rest for the playoffs. “I know that there is a lot of good football in front of me,” Jones said. “I’m excited about that.”

The Giants have the NFL’s lowest-scoring offense (15.6 points per game), and Jones’ play alone warranted a benching (3-13 over his last 16 starts).  But teammates have taken the blame for the Giants’ failures, with Dexter Lawrence even calling Jones “QB1” despite DeVito starting Sunday against the Buccaneers. “I’ve created a lot of great relationships here with the guys here and definitely appreciate the support,” Jones said in his most emotional moment. “But, it’s about the team and what’s best for the team. I know the guys will be ready to go.” The former first-round draft pick never returned to the level he reached in 2022, when he led the Giants to 10 wins, including the playoffs, and was rewarded with an extension that ultimately will pay him $82 million over two years.  The Giants made other excuses (offensive line, receivers, coaching changes) for the team’s struggles during most of Jones’ time, going 24-44-1 before pulling the plug and looking toward the 2025 draft for his replacement. “They’re looking to change things up. That was what was communicated,” Jones said. “Definitely not happy about it. Not what you want to hear. All those emotions you have. We’re in a business where you’re expected to get results, and we weren’t doing it. Have got to accept it and understand.” Jones admitted that the possibility of getting benched was “maybe a little bit in the back of [my] mind” after the Giants lost to the lowly Panthers in overtime. Giants fans have booed Jones and the offense at every home game (five losses) this season. “To all the fans, I have deep respect and appreciation for your passion and love for the Giants,” Jones said. “The fans are a huge part of what makes playing for the Giants so special.”",2024-11-21

The highly touted prospect made the announcement in a highly produced video that featured clips of Underwood when he was young pretending to announce his commitment to the University of Michigan.  The video also showed old clips of him as a kid in Michigan gear as well as clips of him playing over the years.  Now, several years later, Underwood seemed to have come full circle with the decision announced on Thursday.  Interestingly, Underwood plays high school football at Belleville High School, where former Michigan football staffer Connor Stallions currently serves as an assistant coach.  It had been reported by On3 last week that Michigan had made Underwood a $10.5 million NIL offer to get him to go to Ann Arbor.  A post shared by Bryce Underwood (@19bryce.__) Chatter had first popped up that Michigan was going hard at trying to flip Underwood back in October, according to On3, and now his decision would seem to paint Michigan as a potential contender next year.  “Premier arm talent who is one of the more gifted high school quarterback prospects in recent years. Combination of arm strength, pocket feel and processing ability makes him the top quarterback in the 2025 cycle,” On3 wrote in a scouting summary of Underwood.  Underwood first came to national prominence in 2021 when he threw for 2,888 yards and 39 touchdowns in his freshman year at Belleville.  Belleville is the favorite to capture its third state championship in four years this season.",2024-11-21

Pelech, as of earlier this week, had yet to begin skating on his own, so there is plenty of time for the situation to change regarding the young defenseman. But the first clue as to how the Islanders will handle what amounts to a choice between taking George or Dennis Cholowski out of the lineup when Pelech returns came Tuesday night in Calgary. With Alexander Romanov back in the fold, George was no longer needed on the top pair but still saw 22:16 of ice time to Cholowski’s 14:04, and that is even with Cholowski leading the team in power-play ice time at 2:10 in the Isles’ 2-1 loss to the Flames. Advantage to the young guy. “I thought it went good. We were good together,” George said of his first game alongside Ryan Pulock. “Great partner out there, so it was good.” The advanced numbers weren’t pretty for the two, and much of the night was indeed spent in the defensive zone for the Islanders as a whole.  But George displayed the same traits that have made his first NHL stint so eye-opening, skating his way out of trouble and getting the puck up ice with ease. The 20-year-old’s unflappability has been the most impressive thing about his game.  He doesn’t play like someone with fewer than 10 games under his belt at this level. “I think for the most part, guys around me, coaches and all that, have done a good job supporting me,” George told The Post before the Isles finished their five-game road trip against the Red Wings on Thursday. “Be prepared and be ready. I feel confident out there and ready to go. Obviously, there’s little things you just learn as you go, but overall, I feel like I’m prepared.” With Mike Reilly coming off heart surgery this week, it appears either George or Cholowski will be the team’s third-pair defenseman on the left side for the foreseeable future once Pelech returns. It’s not quite as simple as assuming George will get the job because he’s getting more minutes, though. Cholowski is getting strong reviews from coach Patrick Roy, as well, and the power-play minutes are a real question, with Roy saying the team didn’t want to overtax Pulock — who likely would replace Cholowski at five-on-four if he became a healthy scratch — by having him on that unit, as well as playing heavy five-on-five and penalty-kill minutes.

I’m very happy with him.” An argument also could be made that George’s development could benefit more from playing top-pair minutes in Bridgeport than on the third pair with the Islanders, but that might be a stretch given how comfortable George has looked in the NHL. On Thursday, he framed the jump from juniors to Bridgeport — where he played just four games before being called up — as a bigger adjustment than going from there to the NHL.  That is not what you usually hear, but it tracks with how he’s played as an Islander. “Obviously, it was a big change for me, just being in junior for the last three to four years. You get used to your routine and everything,” George said. “Then move pro, everything’s different again. It’s that adjustment. But it’s been good.”",2024-11-21

And yet, despite all their troubles during the early going of the 2024-25 season, oddsmakers are still expecting the 76ers to make a postseason berth.  The Sixers are currently -215 at FanDuel Sportsbook to make the playoffs in the East, which are the eighth-best odds in the conference.  Luckily for Joel Embiid and Co., the East has been atrocious so far this season.  Only four teams — the Cavaliers, Celtics, Knicks and Magic — have a winning record, while the former two teams are the only ones in the conference with a winning percentage better than .600.  The West, by contrast, has 11 teams over .500 heading into Thursday’s play.  The 76ers came into the season with sky-high expectations after signing nine-time All-Star Paul George in free agency to pair next to Embiid and Tyrese Maxey.  Philly was roundly considered a top-five NBA title contender until things started falling apart shortly before opening night in October.  Embiid missed the first nine games of the season to manage a persisting knee injury. On Nov. 2, the star big man shoved Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Marcus Hayes in the postgame locker room and was later suspended three games by the NBA.  Paul George, who has been in and out of the lineup as well, re-injured his hyperextended knee on Wednesday night during a loss to the Grizzlies. After a loss on Monday, Maxey called out Embiid for being late “for everything” during a team meeting amid the spiraling season. Dylan Svoboda is a versatile writer and analyst across many sports.

ESPN analyst and former Jets and Bills coach Rex Ryan seemed to be campaigning hard to be considered as a candidate for the position during an appearance on ESPN New York’s “Bart & Hahn.”  Ryan argued against blowing up the Jets’ roster when he started to make a point that he would be able to get the team’s current talent pool to win.  “I look at it this way, blow it up? We’re going to blow the opponents up,” Ryan told hosts Alan Hahn and Bart Scott, who played for Ryan during his time on the Jets. “There’s way too much talent on this team to play the way we’ve been playing. How hard can you get a guy to play? That’s the thing. Nobody has seen a team that is going to play as hard as this team’s going to play in the future, trust me. If I’m the guy, trust me.” Ryan served as the Jets head coach through one of the franchise’s more successful periods in recent memory, though the vibe quickly shifted.  The Jets went 46-50 during Ryan’s run from 2009-14, which included back-to-back trips to the AFC championship game in his first two seasons.  However, the success quickly fizzled out, and he finished with losing records in two out of his last three seasons.  Ryan argued during Thursday’s radio appearance that there wasn’t another candidate out there that could embrace the Jets culture.  “That’s what is going to separate me from all these other guys you’re going to bring in. Your Grudens or whoever. Give me a break,” he continued. “They ain’t New York Jets. I’m all about the Jets. And the great thing is, yeah, you get a second chance at it and that doesn’t happen very often. Well, when it does it’s usually special. We’ll find out if I get that chance or not. If not, I hope they have one hell of a guy in place cause I still want to be a fan of the Jets. I still want to be, but when I look around I know nobody is better than me.” Ryan had used another ESPN New York show earlier this week to suggest that the Jets would be in a better spot than they are now if he was at the helm.  The former NFL coach said on “DiPietro & Rothenberg” on Monday that the team would be “probably undefeated” if he had the job.  The response came after he had been asked where he thought the team would be if he was still coaching them.  The Jets are 3-8 as they enter their bye week, as their season has all but come to an end after starting the year with Super Bowl aspirations.",2024-11-21

Alex Ovechkin has a fracture to his left fibula and is expected to miss four to six weeks in an early-season gut punch for the Capitals.  The Capitals star was originally placed on injured reserved and listed as week-to-week after he collided with Utah forward Jack McBain during the third period of Monday’s game on the road.  It puts Ovechkin’s season on pause at a time where he’s not only scoring goals at a prodigious pace, but also at a point where he is nearing NHL history.  With his five goals over the last two games, Ovechkin has 15 goals in 18 games this season, and, for his career, he’s at 868 goals — only 27 behind Wayne Gretzky for the all-time NHL record.  Now, the 39-year-old will miss at least a month as he nears the historic mark.  “Everyone’s bummed out,” forward Tom Wilson told reporters Thursday. “We were sitting there saying: ‘This is weird. Like, it’s unbelievable that he’s actually hurt.’ It’s one of those things where like, he’s going to miss games? I’ve been around a long time, and it’s new to me.” The stretch will almost undoubtedly be the longest period of games he’ll miss in his North American career, as he’s only sat out 35 games due to injury over his 20 seasons in the NHL.  According to NHL.com, the most consecutive games he’s missed was six when he was dealing with an upper-body injury in November 2009.  Even after two decades in the league, the three-time Hart Trophy winner has been a huge part of the Capitals’ success this year, as his 25 points rank second on the team only behind Dylan Strome.

The 25-year-old did not participate in the Blueshirts’ morning skate Thursday ahead of their game against the Flames at the ScotiaBank Saddledome. However, Chytil skated with the extras following the team practice. “He’s day-to-day,” head coach Peter Laviolette said, declining to say whether Chytil would play against the Oilers on Saturday. It’s an encouraging sign that Chytil was cleared both to fly and get back on the ice, but it appears the Rangers are understandably in no rush to plug No. 72 back into the lineup. Chytil was examined by specialists in New York after a scary collision with K’Andre Miller along the half wall in the Sharks game last week.  Doctors ruled that he did not suffer a concussion, which is what sidelined Chytil for 72 of 82 regular season games in 2023-24, as he endured what is believed to be the fourth such injury of his eight-year NHL career. The chances of Chytil playing in Edmonton are certainly higher, especially given the Rangers presumably wouldn’t have flown him out unless they wanted him to play. Otherwise, Chytil could’ve been resting further in New York ahead of his next game, though Chytil probably wanted to be around the team, anyway. The Rangers’ third-line center was off to a strong start, anchoring the team’s most consistent unit alongside Will Cuylle and Kaapo Kakko.

Smith is annoyed with the NFL.  The ESPN personality and sports talk host ranted on the latest edition of his eponymous podcast over the league’s decision to comment on its players doing a Donald Trump-inspired dance last weekend.  The dance, which has become a craze across the sports world, made headlines over the last week, and the NFL released a statement earlier in the week that it would not be handing out punishments over the moves.  Smith had no issue with the players doing the dance, but his issues stemmed from the fact the league even had to address the issue.  “Celebrations usually don’t warrant that. It doesn’t require a response from the league,” Smith said. “So why was it necessary this time? You know why? Because we got a bunch of people still living with their heads in the cloud acting like they get to protest every little damn thing. This is America. Donald Trump won the election, rather convincingly, I might add.” Among the players who did the Trump dance during Week 11’s slate of games were Raiders tight end Brock Bowers, Titans wide receiver Calvin Ridley and Lions defensive end Za’Darius Smith.  The week before, 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa did it as he celebrated a sack on Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield.  “And why am I ticked off?” Smith continued. “Because it was emblematic of the climate that we’ve been living in for years now, which is why I believe Donald Trump was really elected… woke culture, cancel culture, oh hell yes, that played a role. When you got people walking around wondering whether or not they’re echoing the right pronoun.  “Wondering whether or not that was gonna cost them their job or being PC because God forbid your opinion is different than the average folk walking around in America. Lord knows what would happen to you. That’s what America regressed to.” UFC fighter Jon Jones busted out the Trump moves after he won at UFC 309, and American soccer star Christian Pulisic also did it during the United State’s game against Jamaica this week.

The Yankees captain won his second American League MVP Award in three seasons, beating out the Royals’ Bobby Witt Jr. and teammate Juan Soto unanimously in voting that was announced Thursday night. Judge, who set the franchise home run mark two seasons ago, has made further history in becoming just the seventh Yankee ever to win multiple MVPs.  He now stands with Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris and Alex Rodriguez. The award was deserved after threatening his own home run record and finishing with 58, which led the major leagues (as did his 1.159 OPS, 144 RBIs and 133 walks, among many other categories). After a slow April, Judge pieced together one of the best May-through-Septembers the sport has ever seen.  From May 3 until the end of the regular season, he hit .357 with a .492 OBP and 52 home runs in 125 games. Judge put together an all-around stronger year than his 2022 MVP campaign.  It included career highs in batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, OPS, hits, doubles, RBIs, walks, times on base, total bases, extra-base hits and games played.  He became the fourth player in MLB history to stroke at least 58 homers in multiple seasons, joining Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire and Babe Ruth. His OPS was the highest in a 162-game season since Barry Bonds’ 1.422 in 2004. A dream season ended with a nightmare, though. Judge struggled in a postseason in which he struck out 20 times in 64 plate appearances.  It was the failings of his glove that will be remembered most, his dropped fly ball in the fifth inning of the deciding Game 5 of the World Series helping open the door for the Dodgers to score five unearned runs.",2024-11-21

In 2021, Cespedes attempted a comeback, holding a showcase in Fort Pierce, Fla. that 11 teams attended, and briefly spoke with the Mets about a potential reunion, although talks fell apart when the outfielder reportedly claimed he was unwilling to play in the minors.  Cespedes, 39, has been out of professional baseball entirely since 2022-23 when he played for Águilas Cibaeñas in the Dominican Winter League.  The Mets traded for Cespedes at the 2015 MLB trade deadline in exchange for pitchers Michael Fulmer and Luis Cessa. Before the 2017 season, Cespedes signed a four-year, $110 million deal with the Mets.  Injuries, including separate surgeries to remove calcifications from both heels, which hampered him over the latter years with the Mets, playing in just 127 games from 2017-20.  During five total seasons in the orange and blue, Cespedes hit .279/.344/.539 with 76 home runs and 205 RBIs, including making the National League All-Star team and finishing 8th in NL MVP voting in 2016.  Cespedes played eight total seasons in the majors in stints with the A’s, Red Sox and Tigers, in addition to the Mets, after defecting from Cuba in 2011.",2024-11-21

Bologna, said, “Hysier Miller has overcome more adversity in his 22 years than most people face in their lifetime. He will meet and overcome whatever obstacles lay ahead.” University spokesperson Steve Orbanek told ESPN that Temple is “aware of the deeply concerning allegations of sports wagering last season,” and “will cooperate fully should we be contacted,” although the school hasn’t “received any requests for information” from law enforcement. Temple’s basketball team came under fire last March before a game against UAB, which saw the Owls move from a 1.5-point underdog to an eight-point underdog on game day.  The Owls would get blown out, 100-72, with Miller scoring just eight points on 3-of-9 shooting with zero assists.  The team also raised eyebrows during a loss to Tulsa as a 5.5-point favorite.  They would fall behind 16-2 in the first half and lose that game by five points. During his last season at Temple, Miller averaged 15.9 points, 3.6 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 1.8 steals while playing 36.4 minutes per game. The Owls went 12-19 during the regular season before making a run to the AAC Tournament championship game, in which they lost to AUB.",2024-11-21

Bet on Steelers -3.5 (-110) with your first No Sweat Bet and make the most of the Fanatics Sportsbook promo. The Steelers are primed to cover against the Browns on “Thursday Night Football.” Fresh off a gritty win over the Ravens, Pittsburgh’s defense is in peak form, holding one of the NFL’s top offenses to just 329 yards and forcing three turnovers. Their ability to stifle opponents extends to the run game, as they limited Derrick Henry to just 65 yards. Meanwhile, the Browns are reeling, having dropped seven of their last eight games. Their defense, ranked near the bottom in opponent points per play and explosive plays allowed, just gave up 473 yards and 8.2 yards per play to the Saints. Cleveland’s -9.4 point differential over their recent skid underscores their struggles. With a consistent Steelers squad facing a Browns team trending downward, Pittsburgh is well-positioned to cover, even on a short week.

They have vastly outperformed oddsmakers’ expectations in posting a 10-6-3 record, which has them holding down the third playoff spot out of the Pacific Division.  It’s hard to say if Calgary’s current process will continue to yield such strong results.  The goaltending tandem of Dan Vladar and Dustin Wolf has been surprisingly excellent thus far, achieving the league’s fourth-best save percentage.  Unlike the Rangers, who rank first in team save percentage, nobody projected the Flames tandem to be a strength this season.  Over the last 15 games, Calgary has been outshot by 3.13 shots per 60 and holds an expected goal share of 46.01 percent.  If Flames goaltending starts to falter, it should expose their subpar defensive play and lead to significantly worse results.  The Flames’ offensive core is led by aging veterans Nazem Kadri and Jonathan Huberdeau, and they lack dynamic offensive talent.  The Rangers, meanwhile, continue to achieve tremendous regular-season results with their combination of elite goaltending and clinical finishing talent year after year.  Their offensive upside could get a significant boost moving forward if Mika Zibanejad can find his game, and the former 39-goal scorer was excellent in Tuesday’s win in Vancouver.  The Rangers are priced at +105 to win in regulation Thursday, offering bettors an excellent price to fade a Flames team that should return to Earth.  THE PLAY: Rangers to win in regulation (+105, DraftKings) Nicholas Martin handicaps the NHL, MLB and NFL for the New York Post.

The total for “Thursday Night Football” between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cleveland Browns is set unusually low, but this game could go over the mark due to Cleveland’s struggling defense. Historically, AFC North matchups like these are low-scoring, but Cleveland’s defense has been inconsistent this season.  They’ve allowed significant points to teams like Dallas (33), Washington (34), and the Chargers (27), and their red-zone defense ranks 24th, allowing teams to convert in critical situations. With Pittsburgh averaging over 27 points per game and Cleveland’s defense allowing an average of 27 points against weaker teams, the Steelers’ offense should be able to push the total over the low 36.5-point mark.

The superstar gymnast debuted a short bob haircut when she hit the red carpet solo at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville.  Biles’ husband, Jonathan Owens, was back in Chicago as the Bears are preparing for a matchup with the Vikings in Minnesota on Sunday.  It’s unclear when exactly Biles — who secured four medals, including three gold at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris — cut her hair.  The 27-year-old rocked a long ponytail on Sunday, when the Bears were defeated by the Packers 20-19 at Soldier Field in Chicago.  Before that, she sported stunning long curls for the Bears’ home loss to the Patriots, 19-3, on Nov. 10.  Biles opted for voluminous ’90s glam, according to celebrity hairstylist Justin Revenge. The Olympian wore a stunning metallic gown — a trend on the CMA Awards red carpet — which had one off-the-shoulder sleeve and pointed stilettos.  Biles had two outfit changes at the 58th annual show.  She wore a sparkling metallic pantsuit by VICI to present the award for Female Vocalist of the Year, which went to Lainey Wilson. Biles wore a black tank top underneath an oversized blazer and pointed black heels.  The gymnastics legend then switched to a strapless red mini dress and white cowboy boots for the CMA afterparty at Music City Center. Biles shared that she’s been resting after the Paris Olympics. “I try to rest as much as possible, but it’s always fun to get opportunities to come and do stuff like this because it’s fun walking the carpet and meeting new people,” she told ABC ahead of the CMA Awards.",2024-11-21

That’s according to GemRate, whose Iconic Tracker monitors the graded card population tallies for the hobby’s most popular cards.   PSA graded six of the 1952s with SGC and Beckett each slabbing one.  SGC graded ten of the 16 1951 rookie cards, with PSA grading four and Beckett labeling two. In all, 2,853 copies of the 1952 Mantle and just over 4,000 ’51 Bowman rookie cards have been authenticated since the 1990s.  One of the hobby’s hottest cards saw 32 examples newly encapsulated last month.  PSA graded 31 1984-85 Star Company Michael Jordan cards with BGS slabbing one. PSA graded 178 copies of the much more common 1986-87 Fleer Jordan rookie with Beckett grading 33 and SGC 30 last month.

As we reported last week, the multi-page paper, not surprisingly, was focused on sports, with Robinson chronicling the history and development of baseball, football and hockey.   Completed while Robinson was a UCLA student, it was purchased years ago from the estate of long-time UCLA assistant football coach A.J. Sturzenegger and was being offered at auction for the first time.  The final price, including an 18% buyer’s premium, was just above the pre-sale estimate. Among the other items sold in the auction were a completely graded 1956 Topps baseball set with each card rated 6 or better ($25,960) and a 1932 US Caramel Babe Ruth graded 1.5 by SGC ($12,390). —–  Bidding for the 1933 Goudey Babe Ruth graded PSA 8.5 is set to end Friday night.   No other examples of #149–one of four Ruth cards in the set–have been graded higher. The card appears well on its way to crossing the seven-figure mark via Fanatics Collect’s Premier Auction, which includes about 100 vintage and modern cards. —– A dozen lots of Connor McDavid game-used items are on the block at MeiGray Auctions. Among the items are the CCM helmet with Oakley shield McDavid was wearing when he recorded his 50th and 100th points of the 2022-23 NHL season.  The navy blue helmet has been photomatched to a total of 13 games played between October of 2022 and March of last season.  Others date to last season and include the game-used skates and puck from the assist that marked his 100th point and the stick from his 80th assist, photo matched to two games. A pair of pants worn across parts of two seasons and game-worn socks are also part of the auction that runs until Dec. 5. MeiGray offers regular auctions of memorabilia from McDavid, who recently scored the 1,000th point of his career. —– Vintage set breaks continue to be popular with some collectors.  The concept is similar to a modern break:  buy a spot and a random draw determines the card(s) you get.  Justin Farber of T206Cards.com says in addition to selling cards outright, his two-year-old company has already conducted 12 1986-87 Fleer basketball breaks, eight 1953 Topps baseball breaks and six of both 1955 and ’56 Topps sets, among others.  Some breaks are designed around high-end sets like T206 or high value cards from multiple sets. —– A group of collectors is celebrating five years of raising money for a children’s charity during the  holiday season.  Since 2000, the Facebook Vintage Wax and Packs group has raised over $23,000 through items donated and placed for sale on the group page.  Last year alone, they raised over $8,000 for The John Theissen Children’s Foundation (JTCF), a non-profit that helps sick and underprivileged children in the New York area. This year, they’re hoping to raise $10,000. They’re asking for donation commitments of vintage unopened items worth at least $100. The items are then offered for sale on the group’s page. Once sold, the person who made the donation ships the item to the buyer.  Those who donate are asked to provide photos with a recommended selling price. A tax receipt is available to all donors once your item is sold.  Those who would like to donate can reach out to Dave Eisenberg at [email protected]. —– If you’re a little new to the hobby and/or the whole grading thing, you might check out some tips on sports card grading that our friends at Just Collect have put together.

This potentially would bring women’s professional basketball back to Cleveland for the first time in over twenty years. The team would be the WNBA’s 16th franchise, joining the league’s growing roster as early as 2027 or 2028. The new franchise would play its home games at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse, which has undergone significant renovations in recent years. Additionally, the team would utilize the Cleveland Clinic Peak Performance Center, a new state-of-the-art training and business facility currently under development and set to open in 2027. “It has long been woven into our mission to utilize our platform to unite our community in ways that drive equal opportunities across the board,” said Rock Entertainment Group in a statement to Reuters. “To that end, we are actively pursuing bringing a WNBA expansion team to Cleveland.” Cleveland previously had a WNBA team, the Cleveland Rockers, one of the league’s original franchises. The Rockers played from 1997 to 2003, folding after then-owner Gordon Gund ceased operations and the league could not find a new owner. The city recently hosted the 2024 NCAA Women’s Final Four, which broke television viewership records for women’s sports. The WNBA, currently a 12-team league, is in the midst of a rapid expansion. The Golden State Valkyries will join the league next season, with teams in Toronto and Portland beginning play in 2026.

They have flown nine different types aircraft dating back to World War II, with the pilots of Vought F4U Corsairs racking up over 150 kills by the end of the war. Other aircraft flown by the Jolly Rogers include the Grumman F6F Hellcat, F9F Cougar, FJ-3 Fury, McDonnell F3H Demon, Vought F-8 Crusader, McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, F-14 A/B Tomcat and the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets. Collectively, they saw action in WWII, the Vietnam War, Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom, among other engagements. The all-white uniforms match the design of the Super Hornets flown by Strike Fighter Squadron 103, who are stationed at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach, with navy blue shoulder yoke containing the Jolly Rogers insignia and a yellow stripe on the collar that mimics its tail fin. The Navy wordmark and number font are pulled directly from the side of the aircraft, while the sleeves feature angled (or victory) stripes with nine total chevrons as a nod to the nine aircraft in the squadron’s history.  The jerseys are complete with a patch that displays the current aircraft and victory stripes above the squadron’s designation (VFA-103), as well as the their tagline “Fear the Bones” sewn into the back collar. The pants feature a thick navy blue side panels, which contain the victory stripes and micro text that honors the three additional squadrons that have used the name and insignia of the Jolly Rogers, including VF-17, VF-61 and VF-84. The Eagle, Globe and Anchor – the official emblem and insignia of the Marine Corps – can also be seen on the left hip of the pants, matching the Midshipmen’s standard home and road uniforms, as well as their previous alternate uniforms.  Lastly, the airbrushed helmets are inspired by those worn by the VF-84 and VFA-103 squadrons, with chevrons containing the Jolly Rogers insignia on the sides, the victory stripe down the center and more chevrons with the mechanism that moves their visors up and down painted on the front.

Sports Weez,Double Chance Betting: Strategies for Consistent Returns,https://sportsweez.com/double-chance-betting/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:36:06 +0000","Double chance betting is one of the most straightforward and beginner-friendly ways to wager on sports.

It’s a strategic approach that offers bettors a higher chance of success by covering two potential outcomes of a match instead of one. While the payouts might not be as high as traditional single bets, double chance betting is perfect for those who prefer consistent returns over high-risk gambles. Let’s dive into how double chance betting works and explore strategies to make it work for you. Double chance betting allows you to bet on two of the three possible outcomes in a match—either a win, loss, or draw—ensuring you have a greater chance of your bet landing. It’s commonly used in sports like football, where matches can end in a draw. Here’s how it breaks down: For example, if Manchester United is playing Arsenal, and you bet on 1X, you win your bet if Manchester United wins or the game ends in a draw. The only way you lose is if Arsenal wins outright. Double chance betting is a lower-risk option compared to betting solely on a single outcome. It’s particularly useful in matches where predicting a clear winner is difficult or when underdogs have a decent chance of causing an upset. However, the lower risk comes with reduced odds, meaning your potential payouts will be smaller compared to traditional bets. One of the best ways to use double chance betting is to back underdogs that are capable of holding their own. For example, a mid-table team playing away at a stronger team might be underestimated by bookmakers. Betting on the X2 option can give you value, as a draw or an unexpected win for the underdog both result in a payout. While the odds for single double chance bets might not be high, combining several double chance bets into an accumulator can boost potential returns. For instance, selecting three matches with double chance bets can turn lower-risk wagers into a higher-reward opportunity, though the risk of losing increases with each added selection. If you’re confident about a team but still see a risk of a draw, a double chance bet can be a safer alternative to a straight win bet. For instance, if a team has been drawing a lot of matches but still looks likely to dominate, betting on 1X or X2 offers a safety net. Before placing a double chance bet, study the recent form of both teams. Look at their performance in the last 5–10 matches, their home and away records, and how they’ve historically fared against each other. Teams that often play conservatively or struggle to win outright can be great candidates for double chance bets. Some leagues, like Italy’s Serie A or international tournaments, tend to have a higher percentage of drawn matches. Games between evenly matched teams or those with defensive setups are prime opportunities for double chance bets, especially X2 or 1X options. For added value, consider combining double chance bets with other markets like over/under goals. For example, you could bet on 1X and Over 1.5 Goals, meaning your bet wins if the home team wins or draws, provided at least two goals are scored in the match. Occasionally, bookmakers might undervalue the probability of a draw or an underdog performing well. Double chance betting allows you to capitalize on these mispriced odds, particularly in games where the public heavily backs the favorite without much analysis. Live betting provides unique opportunities to place double chance bets when the match dynamics shift. For instance, if the favorite goes a goal down early, the odds for X2 may increase, providing a chance to back the underdog or a draw with better value. Double chance betting isn’t a get-rich-quick strategy, but it’s a fantastic way to reduce risk and maintain steady returns. By focusing on matches with high draw potential or underdog opportunities, you can outsmart the odds and build a disciplined, profitable betting approach. Double chance betting is perfect for those who value consistency and lower-risk wagers. By leveraging smart strategies, analyzing matches carefully, and targeting undervalued outcomes, you can use double chance betting to build a sustainable approach to sports betting. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned punter, this strategy can be a valuable addition to your betting arsenal.",2024-11-21

Keeping detailed records allows you to monitor your progress, analyze trends, and refine your strategies over time. Whether you’re a casual bettor or serious about turning a profit, a well-structured Excel sheet can be your secret weapon for success. Here’s how to create one that works for you. Open a new Excel sheet and label the first row with key categories. These will act as your columns and determine the type of data you track. Start with the basics: If you’re looking to dive deeper into your betting performance, add additional columns for more nuanced insights: After each bet, record the details in your spreadsheet. Be consistent—accurate records are essential for meaningful analysis. For example: Use Excel’s formulas to make tracking easier and insights clearer: Once your Excel sheet has enough data, start looking for patterns: Use Excel’s built-in chart features to create visual insights: These visuals make it easier to spot trends and evaluate your strategy at a glance. Maintaining your sports betting Excel sheet requires discipline. Update it after every bet, no matter the outcome. Consistent tracking ensures you’re always informed about your performance and helps you avoid emotional decisions based on short-term results. As your betting evolves, adjust your sheet to suit your needs. For instance, add new columns for metrics like implied probability, ROI (return on investment), or bankroll management percentages. Sports betting can be unpredictable, but data gives you an edge. By tracking your bets, you can identify what works, eliminate what doesn’t, and ultimately become a more disciplined and profitable bettor. A well-maintained Excel sheet isn’t just a record—it’s a roadmap to long-term success.",2024-11-21

While details of the shows have not been disclosed, the prospect of seeing top stars like Erling Haaland featured in cartoon form has been raised. According to Manchester City’s Chief Executive Ferran Soriano, the club has “a lot of ideas that we are developing” and is “working on shows for kids” that they are “excited about.” This move comes as the club already produces in-house documentaries, including the recently released “Together” film. Soriano emphasized that the club is confident in its “creativity” and “insights in football” to create compelling fictional stories that can compete with the likes of Netflix and Amazon. He expressed hope that fans will see some of these new projects on their screens in the next few years.

The dispute centers around the Premier League’s regulations on associated party transactions (APTs) – commercial deals with parties linked to club owners. Earlier this year, a tribunal ruled that sections of these rules were unlawful, particularly regarding the exclusion of shareholder loans from the league’s fair market value (FMV) test. Following the tribunal’s verdict, the Premier League assured clubs that amendments could be made “quickly and effectively. However, Manchester City has challenged this claim, accusing Premier League chief executive Richard Masters of attempting to mislead clubs in his communication. Now, Aston Villa has waded into the fray, writing to all top-flight clubs to “strongly recommend” that the proposed vote on potential rule changes be postponed. Sawiris explained the rationale behind Villa’s decision, stating: In our view, a vote in 90 days on amended terms taking into consideration the Tribunal’s findings will have a significantly greater chance of securing the unanimous support of all 20 Premier League clubs.” The Villa owner further emphasized the importance of presenting a “united front” to the upcoming Independent Football Regulator, set to be introduced by the government. Sawiris believes that delaying the vote until after the regulator’s arrival will result in a “more satisfactory outcome” for all clubs. Manchester City has also called for a delay in the vote, claiming the Premier League’s proposed changes remain “unlawful” and hinting at the prospect of further legal action. Despite the protests from City and Villa, the Premier League is reportedly determined to proceed with the vote on Friday, declining to comment on the ongoing dispute. This development adds another layer of complexity to the Premier League’s ongoing efforts to address the contentious issue of sponsorship rules and associated party transactions. As the vote looms, the unity of the league’s clubs remains a central concern, with Aston Villa and Manchester City seemingly aligning to challenge the league’s proposed changes.",2024-11-21

The 23-year-old Cameroonian winger has been in impressive form this season, scoring 8 Premier League goals – the same number as Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah. His performances have caught the eye of both Reds manager Arne Slot and Magpies boss Eddie Howe. Newcastle are believed to view Mbeumo as their top transfer target, with the club keen to bolster their attacking options after struggling for goals so far this campaign, netting just 13 times in the league. However, Liverpool are also said to be interested in the £50 million-rated forward as they look to potentially replace Salah, whose contract expires at the end of the season. Mbeumo’s versatility, able to play across the front three, has drawn comparisons to former Liverpool star Sadio Mane. Slot is reportedly impressed by the 25-year-old’s displays for Brentford. The Bees are reluctant to sell their prized asset in January, with Thomas Frank determined to keep the squad together as they push for a top-half finish. But a summer battle between the two Premier League heavyweights appears on the cards. Newcastle may look to sweeten a potential deal by including injury-prone striker Callum Wilson, who is yet to feature this season.

The analysis shows that United have a staggering net spend of £1.08 billion (€1.3 billion) since 2015, more than any other club. This includes major signings like Harry Maguire (£80m), Casemiro (£60m), Mason Mount (£55m), Antony (£86m) and Rasmus Hojlund (£72m). In contrast, United have only won five major trophies in that period – two FA Cups, two Carabao Cups and a Europa League.

<h2>Luukkonen's Unyielding Defense</h2>

Despite recently recovering from a lower-body injury that saw him benched for two games, Luukkonen was unstoppable, denying six attempts in the first period, an equal number in the second, and a commanding 12 saves in the final period. This marked his first shutout of the season, contributing significantly to the Sabres' momentum with five victories in their last seven games.</p>
<h2>Zucker's Game-Changing Goal</h2>
<p>The game-changing moment arrived 38 seconds into the third period when Jason Zucker capitalized on a power play, expertly redirecting Rasmus Dahlin's shot past the Kings' goaltender David Rittich. This marked Zucker's fourth goal of the season, giving the Sabres their only, yet decisive, score of the game. Dahlin has been instrumental in the Sabres' recent power plays, having contributed points in the last four consecutive games. His assist on Zucker's goal extended his overall point streak to seven games, with an impressive tally of four goals and six assists.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways from the Game</h2>
<p>Despite the absence of their leading scorer, Tage Thompson, due to a lower-body injury, the Sabres managed to secure the win. Thompson, though missed for the third consecutive game, had returned to practice in the days leading up to the match.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Kings, who have been notoriously inconsistent in their performances since the start of the season, failed to turn the tides in their favor, dropping to a 5-2-1 record on home ice.</p>
<h2>Crucial Statistics and Next Steps</h2>
<p>Heading into the game, Buffalo's away power play stats stood at a lowly 2 for 19 (10.5%), ranking 30th in the NHL. However, a 1-for-3 performance in this game was enough to clinch the victory.</p>

<p>Daccord's performance, which included six saves in the first period, eight in the second, and 10 in the third, culminated in his fourth career shutout. This is his first since his remarkable performance against Anaheim on March 26.</p>
<h2>Struggles for the Nashville Predators</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the Predators had a challenging outing. Despite Juuse Saros's commendable effort of 33 saves, Nashville lost for the fourth time in their last five games. The night turned sour for the Predators as they seemed to have scored with 9:21 left in the third period, only for Tommy Novak's goal to be disallowed for a kick.</p>
<h3>Key Contributions and Turning Points</h3>
<p>Sprong's late goal in the second period, his second of the season, broke the deadlock. This critical goal, Sprong's first since his November 8 acquisition from Vancouver, was followed swiftly by Montour's fifth goal of the season, just 23 seconds into the third period. Gourde rounded off the scoring with an empty-netter with just 2:43 remaining.</p>
<p>A rare penalty was incurred by the Predators at the start of the game due to an error in their starting lineup. Filip Forsberg, who was on the ice, was mistakenly replaced by Steven Stamkos in the lineup, resulting in a two-minute bench minor penalty for Nashville.</p>
<h2>Chandler Stephenson Shines for the Kraken</h2>
<p>Seattle's Chandler Stephenson was instrumental in the victory, assisting on all three goals and marking his third multi-assist game of the season. The defining moment came late in the second period when, despite the Kraken's clear advantage in shots, the score was still at a standstill. It was Montour's pass to Stephenson, positioned perfectly at the top of the crease, which set up Sprong's crucial goal.</p>
<h3>Looking Forward</h3>
<p>The Kraken concluded their season-high six-game homestand with a formidable 5-1-0 record. As for what lies ahead, the Predators will host the Winnipeg Jets on Saturday, while the Kraken will travel south to duel with the Los Angeles Kings.</p>

<h1>Dallas Stars Dominate the Ice Against San Jose Sharks</h1>
<p>In a thrilling clash of ice giants, <a href=""https://21sports.com/dallas-stars-top-scorer-robertsons-recovery-from-foot-surgery/"">Jason Robertson</a> ended his 10-match scoreless streak by not only netting a goal but also assisting two, in a match that saw the Dallas Stars outshine the <a href=""https://21sports.com/a-deep-dive-into-the-nhls-record-losing-streaks-featuring-the-san-jose-sharks/"">San Jose Sharks</a> in a 5-2 victory on Wednesday night. This marked Robertson's first multipoint match since Oct. 19, reinforcing his key role in the Stars' lineup.</p>
<h2>Key Players in the Stars' Victory</h2>
<p>Roope Hintz and Wyatt Johnston were also instrumental in the Stars' victory, each contributing a goal and an assist. Jamie Benn and Evgenii Dadonov further bolstered the scoreline for the Stars. Jake Oettinger, the Stars' goalie, had a busy night with 20 saves, extending his flawless 7-0-0 home record and conceding only 10 goals in total.</p>
<h2>Sharks' Effort Falls Short</h2>
<p>The Sharks put up a spirited fight, with Mikael Granlund achieving a short-handed goal and his 400th career assist. Jake Walman added to the Sharks' tally, while goalie Mackenzie Blackwood stopped 26 shots. However, their efforts were insufficient to fend off the Stars' offensive onslaught.</p>
<h3>Turning Points and Highlights</h3>
<p>With 6:35 remaining on the clock in the third period and the Sharks trailing by a narrow margin, Hintz and Dadonov sealed the Stars' victory with empty-net goals in the final 90 seconds. Robertson opened the scoring for Dallas with less than five minutes remaining in the first period and assisted Johnston's goal just 56 seconds into the second period, securing a 2-1 lead for the Stars.</p>
<h3>Injuries and Updates</h3>
<p>Granlund left the ice after being hit high by Ilya Lyubushkin with three minutes left in the match. His condition remained uncertain as Coach Ryan Warsofky did not provide an update post-match.</p>
<h2>Takeaways and Key Stats</h2>
<p>The Sharks' <a href=""https://21sports.com/macklin-celebrinis-overtime-goal-fuels-san-jose-sharks-victory-over-detroit-red-wings/"">Macklin Celebrini</a>, the recent No. 1 overall draft pick, managed a single shot on goal, split 14 faceoffs, and drew a penalty. The Stars' home power play continues to struggle, failing to convert any of their four opportunities and even conceding a goal. They now sit at 2 for 27 (7.4%), with their last 14 power plays yielding no goals.</p>
<p>Despite this, the Stars boast an impressive 8-2 home record, with one loss occurring during the Global Series played in Finland as the designated home team.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>The Sharks will face off against St. Louis on Thursday, while the Stars will visit Tampa Bay on Saturday, kicking off a three-game trip.</p>

<h1>Fraser Minten Shines in NHL Debut as Leafs Shutout Golden Knights</h1>
<p>In an electrifying display of skill and perseverance, rookie Fraser Minten netted his first NHL goal, propelling the injury-plagued <a href=""https://21sports.com/marner-propels-maple-leafs-to-victory-over-canadiens-a-hockey-night-recap/"">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> to a decisive 3-0 victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/vegas-golden-knights-triumph-over-edmonton-oilers-hanifins-double-steals-the-show/"">Vegas Golden Knights</a> on Wednesday night. With a power-play strike at the 3:01 mark in the third period, William Nylander chalked up his 13th goal of the season. The scoring was rounded off by Pontus Holmberg's empty netter, further sealing the Leafs' domination.</p>
<h2>Woll's First Shutout of the Season</h2>
<p>Joseph Woll, the Leafs' goaltender, was in fine form, deflecting all 31 shots on goal, earning his maiden shutout of the season. On the other end of the rink, Vegas' goalie, Adin Hill, put up a solid defense with 23 saves. The victory marks Toronto's sixth win in their last seven outings, while Vegas suffered its second consecutive defeat, delaying coach Bruce Cassidy's 400th career win.</p>
<h2>Matthews and Stone: Captains Absent from the Rink</h2>
<p>Both teams battled it out sans their captains – Toronto's Auston Matthews sidelined due to an upper-body injury, missing his seventh consecutive game, and Vegas' Mark Stone, out with a lower-body injury, absent for his sixth match. The Leafs' roster was further depleted with the absence of Max Domi, David Kampf, Max Pacioretty, and Calle Jarnkrok. Simultaneously, Ryan Reaves began serving his five-game suspension for an illicit check to the head against Darnell Nurse of the Oilers.</p>
<h3>Game-Changing Moment</h3>
<p>The match's dynamics took a turn when Leafs' forward Matthew Knies was floored by a mid-ice hit from Zach Whitecloud in the second period, right in front of the Leafs' bench. Whitecloud escaped without a penalty for the crippling hit but received a minor roughing penalty for his altercation with Simon Benoit of the Leafs, who earned a four-minute penalty for his attempted retribution. The game's intensity escalated post this incident. Unfortunately, Knies, suffering an upper-body injury, did not return to the match.</p>
<h3>Key Statistic of the Game</h3>
<p>The Leafs successfully fended off the NHL's second-best power play unit, restricting Vegas to 0 for 3 on their power plays.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>The Toronto Maple Leafs are preparing to conclude a three-match homestand on Sunday, facing off against the Utah Hockey Club, while Las Vegas is set to continue its five-game road trip in Ottawa on Thursday.</p>

The 22-year-old has thrived this season under Arne Slot, a fellow Dutchman, having been deployed in a deeper role in Liverpool’s midfield.  Gravenberch’s change of role had followed Liverpool’s failed pursuit of Real Sociedad’s Martin Zubimendi in the summer transfer window. Man United legend Neville cited Gravenberch’s impressive performances, coupled with his change of role, as being behind his selection.      Ryan Gravenberch has starred for Liverpool operating in a deeper midfield role this season      Gary Neville said his displays in the position made Gravenberch his surprise player   ‘I am going for Graveneberch in terms of how he has played and the position he has played,’ Neville said on Stick to Football, brought to you by Sky Bet. ‘I feel quite strongly Gravenberch is a massive surprise in terms of how well he has played.  ‘I don’t think anyone expected him to be as good as he has been in that position [in midfield]. Curtis Jones has been very good too.’ Gravenberch would ultimately finish as the third biggest surprise after a discussion with Man United legends Roy Keane and Paul Scholes, Arsenal great Ian Wright and Lionesses hero Jill Scott.  The goalscoring form of Nottingham Forest star Chris Wood and Ipswich forward Liam Delap saw them edge ahead of Gravenberch. ‘Chris Wood with eight goals has got to be in the top three, Liam Delap with six goals for Ipswich,’ Neville added. ‘I’m not surprised by Danny Welbeck, he’s very good – his current form is better than any current [Manchester] United front player this season. Morgan Rogers at [Aston] Villa could be top notch.      Liam Delap, centre, was also highlighted having struck six times for newly promoted Ipswich   ‘I’d go Wood top, Delap number two and Gravenberch in three.’  Wright had highlighted Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo and Brighton’s Carlos Baleba as other potential options. The former Arsenal forward also put forward Brentford forwards Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo. Wright praised the duo for their performances, which he suggested have meant the Bees have not felt a significant impact of selling Ivan Toney.

Sportsdark,Dana White makes shock political U-turn after backing Donald Trump in the election,https://sportsdark.com/mma/dana-white-makes-shock-political-u-turn-after-backing-donald-trump-in-the-election/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 23:21:00 +0000","Dana White was a quasi-permanent fixture on Donald Trump&#8217;s campaign trial as he threw his full support behind the Republican candidate in his bid to seek re-election.  The UFC president, who is close friends with the 78-year-old, has been such an ardent supporter that he even stole the limelight during Trump&#8217;s victory celebrations at Mar-a-Lago [&#8230;]","Home - MMA News - Dana White makes shock political U-turn after backing Donald Trump in the election           Dana White was a quasi-permanent fixture on Donald Trump’s campaign trial as he threw his full support behind the Republican candidate in his bid to seek re-election.  The UFC president, who is close friends with the 78-year-old, has been such an ardent supporter that he even stole the limelight during Trump’s victory celebrations at Mar-a-Lago after beating Kamala Harris at the ballot box.   But now that Trump has sealed his return to the White House, the UFC chief wants nothing to do with the president-elect’s second term – or politics at all.    ‘I’m never f***ing doing this again,’ he told The New Yorker. ‘I want nothing to do with this s***. It’s gross. It’s disgusting. I want nothing to do with politics.’ It appears the GOP will not be able to rely on White for endorsement in the future with his alliance extending to Trump, and Trump alone.  With Trump’s presidential campaign marking the first and last foray into politics for White, it is no real surprise that the 45th president is the sole recipient of White’s political backing.        Dana White was a quasi-permanent fixture on Donald Trump’s campaign trial this year      But now the president-elect has sealed re-election, the UFC chief has sworn off politics White has been a long-time friend and ardent supporter of Trump with the former president echoing the support in his backing of UFC over the years. Trump tapped the UFC President and CEO to speak for him at the last three Republican National Conventions before inviting him to the onstage victory party following this month’s election triumph. White was invited to say a few words at the podium on the stage, and after some glowing praise for Trump, launched into what seemed to be a victory speech of his own. And the UFC president continued to praise Trump this week, hailing him as one of the toughest men he knows.  ‘Donald Trump is tougher and more badass than anybody,’ White also told The New Yorker. ‘You can only pray that you’re a quarter of the man that Donald Trump was when a guy tried to take seven shots at his head with a high powered rifle with a fucking scope on it.’  And Trump has reciprocated White’s support over the past few decades, publicly backing the UFC – even claiming to be its savior.  Trump has regularly attended fight nights, most recently arriving cageside at Madison Square Garden for UFC 309 with Elon Musk and White in tow last weekend.  ‘As the UFC has grown, there’s been a lot of people that have jumped on the bandwagon and became fans,’ White said. ‘Trump was there from the beginning.’       78-year-old Trump has been an avid supporter of White’s UFC throughout the years       Jon Jones celebrated his victory with Trump, who attended the UFC event on Saturday  Trump basked in his post-election glory at the UFC event – the first since his re-election – when American fighter Jon Jones appeared to dedicate his victory to the president-elect. Jones emerged victorious in front of the president-elect at Madison Square Garden where he got into the patriotic spirit after a knockout win over Stipe Miocic . Jones and Trump shook hands and capped a fight night charged with politics as much as punches inside a raucous MSG where ‘USA!’ chants echoed through the arena. ‘A big, big thank you to President Donald Trump for being here tonight,’ Jones said inside the cage before presenting Trump with the belt and imitating the president-elect’s now-iconic arm-shimmy dance. ‘I’m proud to be a great American champion. I’m proud to be a Christian-American champion.’ After leaving the cage, the UFC Heavyweight champion made his way over to where Trump was sitting with Musk and handed him his championship belt.

The former midfielder, 38, only took charge of the second tier Cypriot side Ayia Napa on October 29. He oversaw two 1-0 victories during his short tenure before his departure was announced on Tuesday after 21 days with the club.   The abrupt exit of the former top flight star raised eyebrows, but the reasons have become clearer now he has secured a new job. The figure, who is former Southampton, Millwall and Crystal Palace midfielder Jason Puncheon, has been appointed by Akritas Chlorakas as their new manager.  Akritas also play in the Cypriot second tier and sit one point and one place above Ayia Napa.      A Premier League cult hero has made a swift return to coaching after he left his previous role      Jason Puncheon exited Cypriot second tier side Ayia Napa after only two games on Tuesday      But, he has jumped straight back into coaching, taking over league rivals Akritas Chlorakas In a statement announcing his arrival, the club said: ‘We are excited to officially welcome Jason Puncheon as the new head coach of Akritas Chlorakas. ‘With his extensive experience as a player in top leagues and his leadership qualities, we are confident that he will bring fresh ideas, determination, and a winning mentality to our team. ‘Jason has shown his passion for football throughout his career, and we are thrilled to have him bring that same energy to Akritas Chlorakas.  ‘Together, we are ready to face the challenges ahead, work hard, and achieve great things. ‘Let’s give Jason a warm welcome to the Akritas family and show our support as he begins this new journey with us. Here’s to a successful and exciting chapter for Akritas Chlorakas.’ The new role will be the fourth managerial job of Puncheon’s career and comes after his exit from Ayia Napa was announced two days ago, with reports in Cyprus claiming the 38-year-old had bought out his contract to make the move. In a statement posted on Instagram on Tuesday, Ayia Napa – who are based in the famous party resort – had said:  ‘Ayia Napa Sports Club announces the mutual consent termination of its cooperation with coach Jason Puncheon. ‘Assistant coach Christos Tsapatsoulis also left our team. The board wishes both the best in their professional careers.’      Puncheon will manage his fourth different club in Cyprus after ending his playing career there      Puncheon was best known for his time at Palace and won both his games with Ayia Napa   Puncheon’s first match with Ayia Napa saw them beat Achyronas-Onisilos 1-0 away from home, before they defeated Doxa Katokopias by the same scoreline a week later. The back-to-back victories saw Puncheon’s former side rise from third bottom in the 16-team table up to ninth, with Ayia Napa having previously won just one of their six league games before the 38-year-old’s arrival.    Puncheon’s arrival at Akritas meaning he has now coached four clubs in Cyprus after also ending his playing career in the country. Puncheon’s first managerial stint saw him win eight of his 18 games in charge of Peyia 2014, although he spent only six months in the role. Puncheon then lasted less than a month at AEZ Zakakiou between February and March 2024, failing to win any of his seven matches at the helm.   Speaking to Mail Sport earlier this year, Puncheon revealed why he opted to move to Cyprus as his playing career came to a close in 2019.  ‘I had Championship options but Cyprus gave me a chance to play for a team that was fighting for something and having a good life with my family. It was an option I wanted to take,’ he said.  ‘Footballers should look at these opportunities and take them more than we turn them down because there’s so much to learn.      Puncheon previously urged others players to move abroad to gain opportunities in coaching, while crediting his former boss Alan Pardew with inspiring him to become a manager ‘It was route into coaching for me because the reality is I’m not Steven Gerrard or Wayne Rooney. ‘Maybe Crystal Palace would have said to me at the end of playing career ‘come and take the U15s’. ‘But I thought if I go to Cyprus and make a name for myself it may be easier for me to step into coaching which as always the end goal. ‘Whereas in England, once I retired I would maybe be waiting forever.’ After completing his UEFA A and B badges alongside Juan Pablo Angel, Djimi Traore and Carlton Cole, Puncheon put his decision to move into coaching down to former Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew.  The 38-year-old – who retired from playing in 2023 – spent nine seasons in the Premier League and enjoyed his most productive spell with Palace, netting 16 goals and adding 21 assists in 169 matches for the Eagles.  Arguably his most memorable contribution to the south London outfit was his opening goal in their 2016 FA Cup final defeat by Manchester United.  Puncheon also had spells with the likes of Huddersfield, Southampton, Plymouth, Barnet and MK Dons as well as three clubs in Cyprus. His abrupt departure from his most recent role means Ayia Napa are left searching for their third manager of the season.   In total, Puncheon has won 10 of his 27 games in the dugout and kicks of his Akritas tenure with a trip to Achyronas-Onisilos on Saturday.

Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca revealed at his press conference on Thursday that James will not be available for Saturday’s match with Leicester due to struggling with a hamstring problem. James has only played 654 minutes of football since being named Chelsea captain 15 months ago, and is now set for another spell on the sidelines.   But he gave a defiant message to his social media followers on Thursday night as he thanked fans for their support and vowed to overcome his injury blow. The England full back wrote on Instagram: ‘This message is to the people that understand & have respect for what I’m going through… I appreciate you so much, your support and kind words go further than you could ever imagine. ‘And just to touch on me… I’m doing okay, been better and also been worse. Another challenge ahead accepted. Eventually I’ll come out on top. Against all odds.’      Reece James has thanked fans and vowed to bounce back after his latest injury blow      Enzo Maresca revealed he will be without his captain for this weekend’s trip to Leicester      James has suffered multiple injury setbacks in recent years, and is now sidelined again The severity of James’ injury is yet to be determined, although Maresca appeared to indicate that his absence this weekend is a precaution and he could return to the pitch shortly. Maresca said: ‘He felt something. ‘He has to be out, for sure this weekend, and then we’ll see. At the moment we don’t know how long. We’ll see. ‘I know it’s not easy, but if every time he is getting an injury it becomes hard for him, for me it’s even worse. He has to accept that. He has to try to avoid it as much as he can. ‘But sometimes things happen, even if you want to avoid them. This weekend he’s not available. Unfortunately he felt something small. It’s a hamstring. It’s a muscle problem. We don’t want to take any risks for this weekend.’ James has endured a torrid time with injuries in recent years, and has missed the last two major tournaments with England after being unable to prove his fitness. He was also sidelined at the start of this season, and Maresca admitted last month that James is only capable of playing one match a week due to his ongoing physical struggles. James subsequently started three straight league matches against Liverpool, Newcastle and Manchester United, but was dropped to the bench for Chelsea’s last game before the international break as Maresca preferred the full back pairing of Malo Gusto and Marc Cucurella in the 1-1 draw with Arsenal. Gusto and Cucurella look set to start once more when Chelsea return to Maresca’s former club Leicester in Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off. Your email address will not be published.

Mularkey’s Titans went 9-7 during the 2017 regular season before losing to the Patriots in the divisional round of the playoffs. And while he knew that defeat would spell the end of his time in Tennessee, he told NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport that he was actually about to get a contract extension, as he revealed in a new interview.   ‘The best thing I did there at the end… was when I got called in that Monday morning after the New England game. I knew they were going to fire me,’ Mularkey began on Action Sports Jax’s ‘Brent & Austen’, per A to Z Sports. ‘So Sunday night, I called Ian Rapoport, and I said, ‘Hey, I don’t know if you know this, but I’m going to break it to you – I’m getting a new contract in the morning.’      Mike Mularkey is seen after the Titans lost the divisional round game to the Patriots in 2019      Ian Rapoport was told by Mularkey that he was getting a new deal, and reported as such

And I’m pretty sure I got him for for a minute or two. When I walked in the next morning, there wasn’t a whole lot of conversation.’ Mularkey did in fact get fired from his Titans role, but not before Rapoport tweeted the coach’s misinformation out to his followers. Rapoport’s tweet was retweeted more than 2.2k times and received 2.4k likes. Notably, Rapoport had reported earlier that January that Mularkey could lose his job if the Titans lost to the Chiefs in the wild card round. Tennessee won that game but didn’t get any further as they fell to Tom Brady and the Patriots at the next stage. Mularkey, who also coached the Bills and Jaguars before getting to Tennessee, was last in the NFL in 2019 as the Falcons’ tight ends coach. Your email address will not be published.

Players are kept under close watch during road trips, as they are technically out of town on business like anyone else.       Taylor Swift cannot stay with Travis Kelce the night before every Kansas City Chiefs road game      There is no edict on who Chiefs players can have stay with them the night before home games  It is NFL players’ wives who get to enjoy the towns where their partners are playing, not those participating on the gridiron.  Chiefs players are also not allowed to drink alcohol the night before games, as that’s a privilege bestowed upon their WAGs to do for them if they choose.   Breaking any of these rules can result in fines or other punishments at the team’s discretion.  Even being late to team meetings can get players fined, with walkthroughs and last-minute coaching common before every game.  There is no edict for guests staying over before home, which could be part of the reason Swift has attended every Chiefs game at Arrowhead Stadium this season.   Your email address will not be published.

The 39-year-old arrives in Manchester with a stunning resume from his time in his native Portugal but more established managers have tried and failed at Old Trafford since Ferguson’s 2013 exit.  Ahead of the Portuguese’s first match against Ipswich, Mail Sport looks back at the first result of every Red Devils manager since the Scot waved goodbye to the United faithful.      Ruben Amorim will be the 10th manager to take charge of a Manchester United game since Sir Alex Ferguson left      The Red Devils travel to Ipswich to take on Kieran McKenna’s side, buoyed by their first win of the season      United are on a run of four games unbeaten and sit just four points outside the top four, despite being way down in 13th Dubbed ‘the Chosen One’ after Ferguson’s retirement, Moyes won his first game as United manager against Wigan. After winning the 2012-13 Premier League title, United faced the Latics in the Community Shield at Wembley, with a brace from Robin Van Persie securing Moyes’ only trophy for the Red Devils via a 2-0 victory. Less than a week later, the Scot also won his opening Premier League game with a 4-1 victory over Swansea City. However, United’s early promise under Moyes faltered and in April 2014, United sat seventh in the league and were eliminated from every other competition. Moyes was subsequently relieved of his duties just 10 months into a six-year contract. Result – Man United 2-0 Wigan       David Moyes won the Community Shield in his first game in charge, with United beating Wigan   As United’s most-capped player of all time, Giggs was appointed as a player-coach after Moyes was sacked. His first game ended in a triumphant 4-0 victory over Norwich in the Premier League. Braces from Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata capped off a dominant performance at Old Trafford. The Welshman made his 963rd and final appearance for the club after substituting himself on for Tom Lawrence in a 3-1 win over Hull City during his time in charge.  Giggs managed just four games for United, compiling a record of two wins, a draw and a loss. He was appointed as assistant manager the following season but left the club in 2016. Result – Man United 4-0 Norwich City       Ryan Giggs enjoyed a short stint as interim boss and won his first game against Norwich 4-0 Van Gaal was appointed by United in May 2014, becoming their first ever non-British or Irish manager. The Dutchman lost his first game in charge, a 2-1 defeat in the Premier League by Swansea. This was United’s first home loss against the Welsh side since 1931. Van Gaal came armed with 23 years of managerial experience, having previously coached the likes of Barcelona and Bayern Munich. However, despite winning the FA Cup in his second season, a fifth-place Premier League finish led to his sacking in May 2016. Result – Man United 1-2 Swansea City       Louis van Gaal’s tenure got off to the worst possible start as United were beaten by Swansea In typical Mourinho fashion, the ‘Special One’ led United to a trophy in his first game as manager as his side beat reigning Premier League champions Leicester 2-1 in the 2016 Community Shield. Goals from Jesse Lingard and new signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic marked the start of the Mourinho era for the Red Devils. He also enjoyed success in his first Premier League game, winning 3-1 away at Bournemouth, while the Portuguese went on to win the Europa League and League Cup in his first year at United. However, after a miserable run of form left his side 11 points off the top four, Mourinho was sacked a week before Christmas in 2018, midway through his third season in charge. Result – Man United 2-1 Leicester City       Like Moyes, Jose Mourinho managed to win the Community Shield in his first game in charge   Solskjaer was appointed as an interim manager the day after Mourinho was let go  and had three days to prepare for his first game against former club Cardiff, where he endured a difficult nine-month stint. In emphatic fashion, United beat them 5-1, marking the start of a fairytale run of form for the Norwegian. After winning 14 of his 19 games in interim charge, Solskjaer took over as manager on a permanent basis. He went on to lead United to sixth, third and second in the Premier League over his first two-and-a-half seasons in charge. However, despite Cristiano Ronaldo’s blockbuster return to the club in 2021, United had one of their worst starts to a Premier League season ever. Solskjaer was sacked after a disastrous 4-1 defeat by Watford, with his side languishing in seventh in the table. Result – Cardiff City 1-5 Man United       Ole Gunnar Solskjaer secured a thumping 5-1 win over Cardiff City after replacing Mourinho After serving as an assistant under Solskjaer, Carrick was named caretaker manager on November 21, 2021. United travelled to Villarreal in the Champions League just two days later. Late goals from Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho sealed a 2-0 win for the Red Devils and their advancement to the last-16 in the competition. Carrick only took charge of two more games, both in the Premier League. He drew his first league game 1-1 with Chelsea, then led his side to a 3-2 victory over Arsenal at Old Trafford. Stepping down as interim coach, he left United with immediate effect and joined Middlesbrough as permanent manager in October 2022. Result – Villarreal 0-2 Man United      Michael Carrick oversaw an impressive 2-0 victory against Villarreal in the Champions League   Rangnick was United’s top candidate as interim manager and replaced Carrick in December 2021.  His first game ended in a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace at home. He went on to lose only one of his next 10 games, before the Devils’ form dipped significantly. Rangnick’s efforts were only enough to earn a sixth-place league finish at the end of the season.  The original agreement for the German to stay at Old Trafford as consultant was abandoned, with Rangnick instead agreeing a deal to take over Austria, where he has been hugely successful. In poetic fashion, his last game at United was a 1-0 defeat by Palace in the Premier League.

On August 7, he lost his first game in charge, a 2-1 league defeat to Brighton at Old Trafford.  It ensured the Dutchman endured a nightmare start after Pascal Gross’ first half doubled stunned home fans as United were completely outplayed. The following week, United were embarrassed away at Brentford, losing 4-0, with Ten Hag becoming the first United manager since John Chapman in 1921 to lose his first two games in charge. After leading the Red Devils to an eight-place finish in the Premier League finish last season, the board decided to keep him after he won the FA Cup. However, with United 14th in the league after nine games, the hammer fell on Ten Hag on Monday, as the club look to begin a new era under Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s ownership.

Naturally, the responsibility for leading the team in the short term fell to the Dutchman’s assistant, United legend Van Nistelrooy.  The 48-year-old, who scored 150 goals in 219 games for United between 2001 and 2006, had previously managed Eredivisie giants PSV and he showed his ease in the hot seat during his interim spell in charge.  The first of a four-game reign began with a Carabao Cup tie against newly-promoted Leicester. Despite their struggles in the Premier League, Steve Cooper’s side retain a threat and would almost certainly have caused problems for Ten Hag’s United.  But with the team now liberated of the former Ajax boss they immediately became a free-scoring outfit against and found the net five times – something they failed to do against another Premier League during Ten Hag’s reign.  The Foxes were similarly accommodating in their league fixture 10 days later, going down by the same margin. Those Old Trafford clashes with the east Midlands outfit bookended an impressive four-game spell that included a 1-1 draw with Chelsea and 2-0 win over Greek side PAOK.  Result – Man United 5-2 Leicester City  Your email address will not be published.
