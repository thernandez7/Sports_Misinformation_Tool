"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Did the New College Football Playoff Help or Hurt the 2024 Regular Season?,https://deadspin.com/did-the-new-college-football-playoff-help-or-hurt-the-2024-regular-season/,2024-12-01T15:40:02.957Z,"College Football expanded their playoff to 12 teams, but did this decision help or hurt their product throughout the 2024 regular season? Let's take a","The 2024 college football season has been one of the wildest, most unpredictable, and chaotic in recent memory. In the end, how much will it matter? Rivalry Week saw No. 6-ranked Miami let a 21-0 lead slip away in a 42-38 loss at Syracuse, while No. 2 Ohio State showed more fight in the postgame brawl with Michigan than its offense could muster in a 13-10 loss. With the teams involved, Week 14 draws a parallel to the final month of the similarly wild 2017 season. When Ohio State lost a stunning 55-24 November game at Iowa that year and Miami suffered another regular-season finale setback against Pitt, those outcomes helped effectively deny each a spot in the College Football Playoff. But with the postseason tournament’s expansion to 12 teams this season, the 2024 Buckeyes and Hurricanes could very well still be slotted into bids when the Dec. 3 rankings are revealed. Each might even benefit from losing on Rivalry Saturday, as it puts conference counterparts—SMU in Miami’s case, Penn State for Ohio State—in a position to take detrimental losses in their league championship games. Miami’s position is more tenuous than Ohio State’s, with the Hurricanes entering Week 14 lacking a consequential win. Ohio State, on the other hand, has victories over likely Playoff participants Penn State and a blowout of Indiana just one week ago. That Ohio State could be, and likely is, insulated from falling out of the Playoff picture—but so are both Indiana and Penn State—suggests that the new postseason format has lowered the stakes of each college football Saturday compared to years past. Among the qualities that made college football so unique compared to America’s other high-profile team sports was the specific lack of a postseason tournament. The absence of a Playoff before 2014 made college football’s ""tournament"" essentially begin on Labor Day weekend and run through Thanksgiving. Even with the introduction of the Playoff, some of that aura remained—like in 2017, when Ohio State’s loss to Iowa or Miami’s loss to Pitt knocked each out of the national championship hunt. The four-team Playoff wasn’t without its flaws, and 2017 again offers parallels to today. As contenders fell by the wayside throughout the season—USC to Notre Dame, Notre Dame to Miami, Miami to Pitt—the pathway for an outsider like UCF seemed open. Instead, the undefeated Knights were passed over in favor of an Alabama team that failed to win its division, let alone its conference. While Alabama winning the national championship provided the selection committee with the confirmation bias necessary to justify the decision, UCF ran into the same glass ceiling that existed during the Bowl Championship Series era. The 12-team Playoff provides a solution, with Boise State in line to get the title shot it was denied repeatedly throughout the BCS years. In past eras, a Week 2 loss to No. 1-ranked Oregon would have eliminated the Broncos, with the ""every week is a playoff"" mentality applying more literally to teams from outside the autonomy conferences. Not even in the most egregious examples of outsiders being snubbed in the BCS or four-team Playoff eras were there 12 teams worthy of vying for the national championship by season’s end. It’s clear from the first regular season of the 12-team Playoff that there are not 12 teams that should be playing for a national championship now, either. Take Alabama: Fresh off a 24-3 pasting at Oklahoma in Week 13, the Crimson Tide’s Iron Bowl win over a sub-.500 Auburn team, coupled with assorted bedlam around the nation, could position them to sneak into the field. Does a 9-3 team with two double-digit-point losses and a defeat to Vanderbilt really deserve to play for the national championship? Or does that cheapen sports' most exciting regular season?

"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Ranking the Top 10 Biggest Sporting Events in December 2024,https://deadspin.com/ranking-the-top-10-biggest-sporting-events-in-december-2024/,2024-12-01T15:28:41.578Z,"December is one of the best months on the sporting calendar, so Deadspin ranked the top 10 upcoming sporting events this month.","Congratulations! You’ve endured another year—one with a Leap Day, a Summer Olympics and a good old-fashioned U.S. presidential election. 2024 has been a long one. December rewards us with Christmas, Hanukkah, New Year’s Eve and a slew of meaningful sporting events to go with it. Without wasting time, let’s get into our ranking of the 10 biggest events of the month. Football—NFL plus college—makes up half this list, but there’s room for basketball and some other novelties. This can’t go higher than 10th because it’s an exhibition, and because you have to care about golf’s ongoing civil war to see its meaning. I, personally, am here for it. We get to see ex-rivals and current LIV golfers Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau team up against Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy representing the PGA Tour. They’ll play an 18-hole match at Shadow Creek, a legitimately tough course. This is nothing like the hit-and-giggle shows in cozy environments that “The Match” series has turned into. December is so jam-packed with football that hockey gets the squeeze, and the New Year’s Eve “Winter Classic” between the Blues and Blackhawks just missed the cut for this list. But if you get NHL Network, they’ll be carrying this Stanley Cup Final rematch nationally. The Panthers are very good once again, and the Oilers... well, the Oilers still have Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl. This game is an institution. It’s on my personal bucket list. That doesn’t mean it’s always good football. Some years, neither offense can move the ball. This is not one of those years. The quarterback matchup of Navy’s Blake Horvath vs. Army’s Bryson Daily (who have 36 rushing touchdowns between them) is the zenith of a great year for the service academies. This year’s Christmas Day schedule looked much better on paper in the preseason than it does now. (Philadelphia at Boston? The Sixers will be basted like a holiday turkey.) But the Warriors and Lakers are both playing well entering the month, and you never know—this could be the last Christmas game LeBron James plays. Not much room for college hoops on this list, but make time for this one on Wednesday. Auburn has a claim as the best team in college basketball—ranked No. 1 on KenPom, with wins over Houston, Iowa State, North Carolina and Memphis, the latter three coming as the Tigers won the Maui Invitational. Next, they go to Cameron Indoor and tangle with Cooper Flagg and the Dukies. Must-see. The point of the NBA Cup is for basketball to try to stand out in a football-heavy December landscape, and last year’s inaugural tourney had the draw of the Lakers making the final. Group play isn’t finished yet, but some teams that could make it to Vegas include the Knicks, Bucks and Warriors. Still, everyone has their own opinion of whether the NBA Cup matters or not, so I can’t put this any higher than fifth. It just means more in the SEC, except this year, when every interesting team they have owns three league losses. This has been the Big Ten’s year, from Oregon’s dominance to Indiana’s fairytale run.  The NFL has invaded the NBA’s holiday—I’ll never fully be on board with football on a Wednesday. But I can’t pretend I won’t be watching this game. Kansas City and Pittsburgh will be jostling for AFC playoff positioning, and might it be a white Christmas in Western Pennsylvania? On top of that, we all have to tune in to see if Netflix can handle a high-traffic livestream after their Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fiasco. Super Bowl preview? Sure feels like it. December appears to have far more interesting NFL matchups in store than November did, and Week 15 alone will also bring us Steelers-Eagles and Packers-Seahawks. They don’t hold a candle to these two red-hot, well-rounded teams. I only wish the game were in freezing Buffalo instead of indoors in the Motor City. I don’t have enough space here to debate the finer points of the new 12-team playoff format.  What I know is that a few Fridays from now, history will be made with the first FBS-level playoff game held on a college campus, likely somewhere cold like Columbus, Ohio, or State College, Pa. A tripleheader will follow on Saturday. There’s no promise this particular game will be good, but you’ll be watching, and our brave new world of college football will feel realer than ever.

"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Ryan Day’s Ohio State Hits Rock Bottom Against Michigan Wolverines,https://deadspin.com/ryan-days-ohio-state-hits-rock-bottom-against-michigan-wolverines/,2024-12-01T14:47:39.292Z,"Saturday's 13-10 loss to the Michigan Wolverines marked a new rock bottom for Ryan Day and the Ohio State Buckeyes, who will tumble in the CFB Playoff","“I don’t know.” The curt but brutally honest response by beleaguered Ohio State coach Ryan Day could have been the answer to a myriad of questions, such as why can’t you beat Michigan? How can such a talented group look so feeble against a less than stellar Wolverines team that was a three-touchdown underdog? What does this mean for your future? All are good queries, but he was asked specifically how the No. 2 (not for long) Buckeyes regroup for the playoffs after one of the most devastating upsets in the history of the storied rivalry. That’s saying something given the number of times the Wolverines have been spoilers. The 13-10 defeat in Ohio Stadium on Saturday prevented the Buckeyes from getting revenge against Oregon in the Big Ten title game on Dec. 7. The top-ranked Ducks won 32-31 in Eugene, Oregon, on Oct. 12, and ever since Ohio State knew it would have to win out to attain that goal. So, what did the Buckeyes do? They went to Happy Valley and defeated No. 4 Penn State, the same Nittany Lions, who, by virtue of Ohio State’s loss to Michigan, will play Oregon for the conference championship and give another distressed coach (James Franklin) a chance for redemption. Oh, the irony. Ohio State downed overrated No. 5 Indiana handily in the leadup to the Michigan game, and everything seemed in order to pour it on against the Wolverines, who needed a win over Northwestern in the penultimate game to become bowl eligible. So, again, Ryan Day how will a program that spent $20 million to attract or retain players this season and had a dozen of them return when they didn’t have to and stated their top priority was not a national championship but to beat Michigan now prepare for an unknown opponent at an unknown place in three weeks after a demoralizing setback? “I don’t know. I’m fresh off the game so I don’t really have the answer to that,” Day said. “We’re disappointed. Never thought this would happen right here."" “We were expecting to win this game and play in the Big Ten Championship Game and neither of those things happened...."" It’s too soon to figure out what’s next.” He wasn’t the only one shocked. A source said OSU Police were planning to let the fans tear down the goal posts after the Buckeyes’ first win over their rival since 2019. Instead, they spent the moments after the game using pepper spray to disperse the melee after Michigan players tried to plant its flag at midfield and the Buckeyes, uh, objected. It was a farce but another example of the toothlessness of the NCAA, which has no governance on paying players tens of millions before they step on campus to “get an education.” It’s the same NCAA that looks the other way when fans storm fields or courts because, well, kids will be kids. So, who cares about taunting an entire stadium with those big bad flags? Of course, all the Buckeyes needed to do to shut up Michigan was to win. Now, they face the prospect of possibly losing home field for the first round of the playoffs while the heat on Day increases exponentially over the next three weeks until the playoffs begin. Just ask the hordes of fans outside the home locker room area where parents and families were waiting who chanted long and loud, “Fire Ryan Day.” Just making the national championship game may not be enough to mollify them after another Michigan disaster. It’s natty or bust for those who were promised so much and have received so little. Ohio State has an embarrassment of riches. Saturday was simply embarrassing. Copyright 2024"

Detroit and Kansas City (thank you, Travis Kelce) already put wins on the books for Week 13, and Buffalo can follow suit. But the Bills might need to wait for the snow plows to do their business Sunday afternoon with a few feet of snow in the forecast before the evening primetime affair with the 49ers kicks off.  While Denver is a tough place to play again, there should be less concern about precipitation in Atlanta. The Chargers are 1.5-point favorites but go at the Falcons without top back J.K. Dobbins and lost to the Ravens on Monday night.  Let’s tease a parlay with a Monday cliffhanger wrapped around our other two favorite picks and find a prop that looks too good to be true as we test our luck in Week 13. Cleveland Browns @ Denver Broncos Monday 8:15pm ET Denver Broncos: -5.5, +0.5 Spread San Fransisco 49ers @ Buffalo Bills Sunday 8:20pm ET Buffalo Bills: -5.5, +0.5 Spread Los Angeles Chargers @ Atlanta Falcons Sunday 1:00pm ET Los Angeles Chargers: -1.5, +4.5 Spread We understand the trepidation of those thinking fate is being tempted by doubting the Browns, who bagged wins over the Ravens and Steelers and are showing some serious swagger with Jameis Winston at the controls. But a one-point Denver win is far less than any trusted projection, and this is the time of year where homefield starts to matter. There’s a cardiac nature to the teams we are pushing against in this three-leg teaser, and the rationale is following teams you are most confident can win straight up and teasing them to the number. Cleveland has one road win this season—at Jacksonville Week 2—but has the defense to stick around against most teams. What has been largely discounted in Denver is the level of dominance its defense flashes from a constant pass rush to one of the best secondaries in the NFL.

Arizona State has been a scorching-hot team down the stretch and probably doesn't want to leave its fate to the committee in hopes of getting an at-large bid. Iowa State has recorded the first 10-win season in school history and didn't secure its spot until BYU defeated Houston late Saturday night in Provo, Utah. The Cyclones badly want to win this game to ensure they are part of the field as they clearly will get passed over if they are a three-loss squad. How they got here: Big 12 newcomer Arizona State was picked to finish last in the 16-team league, proving that those involved in the balloting aren't a group of geniuses. The Sun Devils lost to Texas Tech in Week 4 and their only other setback (to Cincinnati) came when quarterback Sam Leavitt (rib) was sidelined. Arizona State roared to the finish with five straight wins, including a 49-7 road trampling over Arizona on Saturday. Iowa State beat rival Iowa on Sept. 7 and shut out Houston three weeks later as part of a 7-0 start. But consecutive losses to Texas Tech and Kansas knocked the Cyclones out of the CFP Top 25, making a berth feel like a long shot. Yet Iowa State recovered with three straight victories, including a must-win affair with Kansas State on Saturday before receiving the help it needed from BYU to gain the conference title game berth over Colorado. Names to know: --Arizona State QB Sam Leavitt Has put together a surprisingly good season with 2,444 yards and 21 touchdowns against five interceptions. He has three passing scores in four of his five games since returning from the injury. RB Cam Skattebo Tough guy is the face of Arizona State's rise with 1,398 yards and 17 TDs on the ground along with 35 catches for 468 yards and two scores. WR Jordyn Tyson Collected 75 receptions for 1,101 yards and 10 scores, accumulating 444 of the yards over the past three games. --Iowa State QB Rocco Becht Has 20 touchdowns against eight interceptions while throwing for 3,021 yards, joining Brock Purdy -- the former Mr. Irrelevant -- as the lone Iowa State quarterbacks to throw for more than 3,000 yards in a season twice. WR Jayden Higgins Has 80 catches for 1,068 yards and nine touchdowns while he and teammate Jaylin Noel (1,013) are the first duo to top 1,000 receiving yards in the same season in school history. CB Jontez Williams Those four interceptions lead a unit that allowed 21 or fewer points on eight occasions. Xs and Os: Arizona State has taken to smashing the not-any-good label and has been the best team in the Big 12 in November. Second-year coach Kenny Dillingham had just three wins in his first season and now has the Sun Devils being that team others don't want to face. Iowa State had won nine games in a season on just three occasions prior to this season but now has a chance to win 11 or more this season. The Cyclones won't scare anyone on the overall talent spectrum but the late-season exploits point to a team that is about to play itself into the playoffs.

The Mustangs didn't play Clemson in the regular season and this matchup will be their first-ever clash. The Tigers landed a spot in the title game when Miami lost to Syracuse and now can play their way into the playoffs with a win. Clemson undoubtedly will be passed over if it sustains a fourth loss.  How they got here: SMU didn't seem like much of a playoff threat when it had to score 18 unanswered points in the final eight-plus minutes of the season opener to beat Nevada and then lost to BYU on Sept. 6. But then the Mustangs rolled up 66 points against TCU to start a stretch of nine straight games topping 30. SMU's defense allowed a total of 13 points in wins over Virginia and Cal to end the regular season. Clemson got whipped by 31 points by Georgia in its season opener and lost to South Carolina in Saturday's finale to go 0-2 against ranked foes. The Tigers rolled up several easy victories along the way but never looked as ferocious as some of their other teams during the Dabo Swinney era. The loss to the in-state Gamecocks was a fitting end to the regular season.  Names to know: --SMU QB Kevin Jennings Strong overall season with 2,746 yards and 19 TDs in the air and four scores on the ground. RB Brashard Smith Stellar runner averaging 6.0 yards per carry to go with 1,157 yards and 14 TDs on the ground. LB Kobe Wilson Stands out against both the run and the pass, leading the team with 95 tackles and also compiling three sacks and two interceptions. --Clemson QB Cade Klubnik Has thrown for 3,041 yards and 29 touchdowns and has been intercepted just five times. RB Phil Mafah Tough runner has 1,078 yards and eight touchdowns on the ground, topping 100 six times. DE T.J. Parker Has put together a stellar campaign with 15.5 tackles for loss, including 10 sacks, to lead the defense. Xs and Os: The Mustangs are a little overlooked on defense but have 21 takeaways (15 interceptions, six fumbles) and three players have picked off three passes. The opportunistic nature complements an offense that has scored 40 or more points five times this season. Clemson also has done a great job creating turnovers (14 interceptions, nine fumbles) with safety Khalil Barnes being the lone player to nab three picks. Parker has forced five fumbles and he can be a game-changer if SMU has trouble blocking him. Prediction: SMU 31, Clemson 21 --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Having your first game being in the quarterfinals is much more preferred than risk being upset in the first round. Penn State also is part of the 12-team field no matter what transpires in Indy. But stun the Ducks and get a bye and home-field advantage? That would be a huge development for the Nittany Lions. How they got here: The Ducks needed a last-second field goal to beat Boise State on Sept. 7 and then won their next three games by at least 21 points. They defeated Ohio State 32-31 in a major showdown on Oct. 12 and then beat four straight Big Ten opponents -- including Illinois and Michigan -- by an average of 26.5 points. Saturday's 49-21 whipping of Washington furthered displayed that Oregon is by far the best team in the land. Penn State won its first seven games before once again falling to Ohio State, dropping coach James Franklin to 1-10 versus the Buckeyes during his tenure. The Nittany Lions bounced back impressively with wins of 29 and 39 points against Washington and Purdue, respectively. Penn State closed with a 44-7 rout of Maryland and landed the championship game spot due to Michigan's win over Ohio State. Names to know: --Oregon QB Dillon Gabriel The transfer is always efficient, and he completed 73.5 percent of his passes for 3,275 yards, 24 touchdowns and just six interceptions. RB Jordan James Put together a strong season of 1,166 yards and 13 touchdowns on the ground, contributing 95 or more yards on eight occasions. S Tysheem Johnson Leads the team in interceptions with three, ranks second in tackles with 55 and always seems to know where to be in the back end. --Penn State QB Drew Allar Allar completed 71.6 percent of his passes while throwing for 2,668 yards and 18 touchdowns against five interceptions during the regular season. TE Tyler Warren He has 81 receptions for 978 yards and six scores, topped by that memorable career-best outing of 17 catches for 224 yards against Southern California on Oct. 12. DE Abdul Carter Put together a dominant season that counts 19.5 tackles for loss, including 10 sacks, while terrorizing opposing offensive linemen. Xs and Os: The Ducks departed the Pac-12 for the Big Ten, where wins weren't supposed to come so easily. But Oregon thrived in its new environment and has been the top team in the nation all season. No matter what happens in the conference title game, the Ducks are the team to beat in the 12-team playoff field. One narrative Franklin despises is that his program beats all the teams it should and falls short in the big games. Well, here you go coach, a perfect chance to temporarily silence that chatter, especially since a win over the Ducks gives the Nittany Lions a first-round bye.

But the Longhorns are craving the chance to sweep the SEC (regular season, conference title game) in their first season in the league. Getting that bye is a big deal and Texas also would like to avenge that 30-15 home loss to the Bulldogs on Oct. 19. A third loss is unlikely to leave Georgia on the outside of the 12-team mix but the Bulldogs certainly would be better served to win and gain the bye. A second impressive showing against Texas is something that would rate as a big help after the Bulldogs gave a less-than-impressive performance in the regular-season finale. How they got here: Texas routed Michigan and Oklahoma in the first half of the season before it was fully understood that neither team was all that great this season. The loss to Georgia was shocking as the Longhorns easily were handled and looked like an overrated squad. Texas recovered to win five straight games with three of them being decided by 10 or fewer points. The Bulldogs opened the season with an impressive rout of Clemson but a late September loss to Alabama displayed some defensive warts. Right when it looked like Georgia was back on track, Ole Miss put on a big licking in the second week of November but the Bulldogs survived that and landed a spot in the SEC title game two weeks later. Another eyesore was Friday's win against Georgia Tech as the Bulldogs trailed by 17 points before rallying for a 44-42, eight-overtime victory. Names to know: --Georgia QB Carson Beck Has passed for 3,429 passing yards and 28 TDs but has been picked off 12 times after throwing just six last season. CB Malaki Starks He's a finalist for the Thorpe Award (top defensive back) and regularly shuts down his side of the field. LB Jalon Walker Solid blitzer has 5.5 sacks and two fumble recoveries while being one of the leaders of the defense. Texas QB Quinn Ewers He manages the game well and has been solid with 2,307 yards and 24 touchdowns against just seven interceptions. MLB Anthony Hill Jr. Leads the Longhorns with 84 tackles, 15 stops for losses, 7.5 sacks and four forced fumbles during a standout campaign. EDGE Colin Simmons Freshman has 11.5 tackles for losses, including seven sacks, while helping the unit allow just 11.7 points per game. Xs and Os: Ewers was dealing with a sprained ankle in Saturday's 17-7 victory over Texas A&M and it wasn't hard to think about how the Longhorns have a backup who is better than most schools' top quarterback. But if Ewers were to sustain a setback, Arch Manning (nine TDs in 90 passing attempts) is just as capable of leading Texas to victory this week as well as in the playoffs. The Bulldogs don't have an electric ground game so the offense revives around Beck, who also misses not having a Brock Bowers-type target to rely on. Defensively, it's strange seeing Georgia allowing 31 or more points on three occasions and 20.5 per game overall. Prediction: Texas 26, Georgia 24 --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Dallas will attempt to win for the eighth time in nine games when it visits the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday night. Doncic watched Saturday's 106-94 road win over the Utah Jazz due to a wrist sprain and again is expected to be a spectator for the sixth straight game. Teammate Klay Thompson (foot) likely will sit out for the fourth consecutive game. Kyrie Irving played the starring role against Utah with 30 points, nine assists and four steals. He also tied a season high with six 3-pointers and is averaging 28.0 points over the past four games. Dallas also received a big game from Quentin Grimes, who made five treys while scoring a season-best 24 points. It was his second straight 20-point outing following his 21-point performance during Wednesday's 129-114 home victory over the New York Knicks. Mavericks coach Jason Kidd was happy with the way Irving handled things when the Jazz made a push in the third quarter on Saturday. ""The way he goes about the game, understanding when it's time to go and when it's time for others to go -- he does a really good job of pushing the others to score,"" Kidd said afterward. ""We got some stops and that led to our pace where we could get out and run. I thought Ky did a good job of pushing and getting us some easy ones at the rim."" The Mavericks ran to a 40-22 first-quarter lead against the Jazz before their play began to plummet. Dallas had just 16 second-quarter points to lead by seven at halftime. ""It could've gone either way,"" Irving said of the contest. ""We just had to stay mentally locked in and make sure we finished the game."" Portland, meanwhile, dropped four of five games before notching a 115-106 home win over the Sacramento Kings on Friday. Deandre Ayton scored a season-high 26 points and collected nine rebounds with a strong performance in the middle to lead the Trail Blazers. ""Just attacking the paint and getting as many paint touches and moving the ball,"" Ayton said of the success in the interior. ""Just being confident in our shots and finishing them. ""Hats off to my backcourt for getting me going and being on me and just talking to me about being the last line of defense."" The Trail Blazers also received strong efforts from Anfernee Simons (21 points, nine assists), Deni Avdija (20 points, nine rebounds) and Dalano Banton (17 points, career-high five steals). Banton noted the win over the Kings was pivotal and left Portland 2-1 in West Group A play of the NBA Cup competition. The Houston Rockets have clinched first place in the group while Portland, the Minnesota Timberwolves (2-2) and Los Angeles Clippers (1-2) are still in the mix. The Trail Blazers will visit the Clippers on Tuesday. ""This in-season tournament, I think it's big for all players,"" Banton said. ""Not just our team, but I think everyone. It brings a whole different aspect to the game with the different court and the energy that it brings. I feel like it's amazing. And we really do want to qualify for the next round."" Trail Blazers forward Jerami Grant (knee) and point guard Scoot Henderson (quadriceps) are listed as questionable for Sunday's game. Grant has missed the last two games while Henderson has sat out four of the past five. The Mavericks won all four of last season's meetings with the Trail Blazers and have taken 10 of the past 12. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

His team, which will host the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday night in Salt Lake City, has lost three games in a row and seven of its last eight. But Hardy liked parts of what he saw in the double-digit defeat against a Dallas team playing without Luka Doncic (wrist sprain). ""Tonight's a perfect example of there's a difference between playing bad and shooting bad,"" Hardy said. ""If the competitiveness, the togetherness, the energy, the fight is at that level every night, there's a lot of good things ahead in Utah."" To the Jazz's credit, they made it a competitive game after falling behind the Mavericks by 20 points in the first half. Despite a rough shooting night, Utah got within three points in the third quarter and was within striking distance in the fourth. Utah ended up shooting 35.8 percent from the field while hitting 23.1 percent of its 3-point shots. Lauri Markkanen scored a team-high 19 points but only made 7 of 20 shots from the floor, including 2 of 11 from beyond the arc. Walker Kessler made 7 of 9 shots while finishing with 18 points, 10 rebounds, five blocks and three steals, but the other three players in double figures-- John Collins, Collin Sexton and Brice Sensabaugh -- shot a combined 15-for-40 from the floor. ""Probably my favorite game of the year. We couldn't throw the ball in the ocean,"" Hardy said. ... ""(But) we guarded well enough to win the game. We competed well enough to win the game. We just didn't shoot well enough to win the game."" The Jazz shot much better in their most recent game against the Lakers, a 124-118 win by Los Angeles on Nov. 19. Unfortunately for Utah, the Lakers made 55.3 percent of their shots in that victory. Dalton Knecht hit 12 of 16 -- including 9 of 12 from 3-point range -- for a game-high 37 points. LeBron James and Anthony Davis each scored 26 points on a combined 19-for-32 shooting from the floor. Knecht scored a team-high 20 points in the Lakers' 101-93 loss to the visiting Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday night. ""There were a half-dozen to a dozen plays that just shot us in the foot even before the late-game stuff,"" Lakers coach JJ Redick said. ""We played well enough and hard enough to win against the best team in the West. So there's definitely good stuff."" Los Angeles enters this matchup having lost four of five games. Redick liked his team's defense against the Thunder. The Lakers trailed by only one point before Shai Gilgeous-Alexander drained a 3-pointer with 1:35 left. ""That was as connected as our group has been on that end of the floor since the first game of the season,"" Redick said. ""Just, you know, a really outstanding job with a lot of the stuff we talked about."" This will be Utah's second home back-to-back set in less than a week. Utah was upended by San Antonio 128-115 on Tuesday and then got tripped up by Denver 122-103 on Wednesday night. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

That's the glass sitting half-empty. The Ducks see that same glass as half-full when they consider they are 5-3-1 in their past nine outings. As well, their latest setback was a positive performance against their biggest rivals. As the Ducks prepare for the Senators, the game will be on the heels of Anaheim's 2-1 loss Friday to the Los Angles Kings to kick off a four-game homestand. The Ducks led midway through the matchup but couldn't fend off their Southern California rivals nor pull away despite outshooting the Kings 31-18, including 12-4 in the third period. ""We had the puck maybe more than we have had in the past against these guys,"" Ducks forward Ryan Strome said. ""In the past, I feel like we have been on our heels and they kind of come in waves at us. ... We were kind of pushing the pace on them."" The Ducks are a long shot to be a playoff team but have shown signs the franchise has turned a corner, especially defensively. Anaheim finished in the bottom three in the past two seasons in goals allowed, but the club has solidified things over the recent stretch. The Ducks are 10th overall in goals-against and have been perfect on the penalty kill in their last six games. ""The last 10 or 11 games we haven't had too many stinkers,"" coach Greg Cronin said. ""We had some, maybe, periods that were off, but I think for the most part we've played really well as a group."" The Senators arrive in Anaheim after suffering a 5-2 loss to the Kings on Saturday. The result snapped Ottawa's modest two-game winning streak that followed a five-game slide (0-4-1). ""I like that we play (Sunday) night. When you play a game that stings a little bit, you don't like to sit around and wait,"" Ottawa coach Travis Green said. The Senators dearly need a lengthy run of victories to pull into the playoff mix. They wasted an opportunity on a night in which they led 2-1 just past the six-minute mark of the second period before surrendering four unanswered goals. ""It's frustrating,"" defenseman Travis Hamonic said. ""We felt at parts we played a really good game. But we've got to turn the page."" Green believes his team played better than it did in a victory Wednesday over the San Jose Sharks to begin this three-game road swing against the trio of California clubs. However, costly defensive miscues turned the tide. ""It should sting,"" Green said. ""I'm pretty open and honest with our team after the game, and my assessment was ... we played hard enough to get a point or get a win, but we made a couple mistakes that I don't think were from them earning the goal."" It is not all bad news for the Senators. Tim Stutzle scored once to extend his point streak to six games, in which he has three goals and five assists. Adam Gaudette has scored in three consecutive games and already has 12 goals, which equals his career high. However, those streaks are hard to celebrate when they need team success. ""It's the unfortunate reality that we have to get that angry with losing that things will change,"" captain Brady Tkachuk said. ""To be able to move on and focus on the task at hand is a good opportunity for us. It's an opportunity to finish the road trip off right.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Following planned pre-game ceremonies featuring decades of alumni and other special events, Boston will seek its fourth win in six games under interim head coach Joe Sacco. The Bruins are playing a century to the day after their first-ever game, a 2-1 win over the Montreal Maroons at Boston Arena, which is now Matthews Arena on Northeastern University's campus. Goaltender Jeremy Swayman and his Bruins teammates know the importance of putting on a good show for the franchise's greats of the past, including Patrice Bergeron, Ray Bourque, Johnny Bucyk and Willie O'Ree. ""It's an honor to put this jersey on every single game, and to have those guys in the building -- we've got to do it right. They made this logo what it is before us,"" Swayman said. ""It's going to be really amazing to be a part of (this special game). I know a lot of guys are excited about it. We're going to honor them the right way."" The game will serve as a bounce-back opportunity for the Bruins following a 2-1 loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins on Friday. Charlie Coyle's goal 1:24 in was all Boston could muster two days after a six-goal outburst on 21 shots against the New York Islanders.  Boston's scoring troubles particularly have been magnified at TD Garden, where the team has not scored more than two goals in six consecutive home games. The Bruins have gone since the Oct. 10 home opener against the Canadiens -- a 6-4 win -- without scoring a third-period goal. ""I would like to think (there is no common theme during the stretch),"" Sacco said. ""Right now, it's just a situation where the puck's not finding its way in the net. We had our chances (on Friday) again, but you have to execute at a higher level, finish off your plays."" The Bruins will look to break through against a Montreal club that has lost three of its past four games, including 4-3 to the New York Rangers on Saturday. A last-minute, power-play goal decided the result. A double-minor penalty for high-sticking on Kirby Dach that led to the deciding tally left Canadiens coach Martin St. Louis frustrated while he delivered his short post-game comments.  ""I loved our game, but I'm not going to talk about the refs,"" St. Louis said. Cole Caufield scored the Canadiens' first of two goals in the final frame and added an assist, extending his point streak to three games. Nine of his 14 goals this season have come on the road. Former Boston College defenseman Mike Matheson, who missed the previous two games with a lower-body injury, and captain Nick Suzuki also scored for Montreal. ""I thought we deserved better. I thought we played better than them,"" Suzuki said of the Saturday contest. ""It's a tough way to end a game that way, giving up a goal that late. Special teams (were) the big difference. We've done well in those situations so far this season. We'll clean it up (for Sunday)."" Suzuki's goal tied the score at 3-3 with 5:53 remaining, but New York's three power-play goals and perfect penalty kill were too much to overcome. After Sam Montembeault's 24-save Saturday effort, the Canadiens likely will start Cayden Primeau in goal against the Bruins. He played collegiately at Northeastern. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Rangers, who squandered a two-goal lead early in the third period, were on the power play after the Canadiens' Kirby Dach was called for high sticking on Mika Zibanejad behind the New York net.  Kakko's game-winner ended New York's longest losing streak since the final week of the 56-game 2021 pandemic-shortened season. The goal came after the Canadiens' Cole Caufield and Nick Suzuki scored about 10 minutes apart to tie the score 3-3.

Matthews returned after a nine-game absence due to an upper-body injury and tallied two assists.  Tampa Bay's Michael Eyssimont, Jake Guentzel and Cam Atkinson each scored in the third -- the latter two with goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy pulled for an extra skater -- but Nylander sealed the win with his empty-net goal.

Simon Holmstrom had his second career multi-goal game and second in as many games. He scored New York's second goal and added an empty-netter in the final seconds. The Islanders won for the third time in their past 11 games (3-4-4) and avoided an eighth loss when leading into the final 20 minutes. New York goalie Ilya Sorokin made 29 saves for his 19th career shutout. Buffalo lost to the Islanders for the second time this season and dropped a third straight contest for the third time this season. Buffalo goalie James Reimer made 17 saves in his second start since joining the Sabres.

The 25-year-old Stauber was making just his seventh career start and first with Utah. Ilya Samsonov finished with 22 saves for Vegas, which suffered its third home loss in 12 games (9-3-0). Flyers 3, Blues 2 (OT) Matvei Michkov scored his third overtime goal of November to help Philadelphia close the month in style with a win over host St. Louis. Michkov, who doesn't turn 20 until Dec. 9, scored the decisive goal on a breakaway after Travis Konecny found him with a sprawling outlet pass while falling to the ice.

Fedor Svechkov and Ryan O'Reilly each scored for Nashville, which sustained an overtime loss for the third consecutive game. Roman Josi tallied two assists. Wild goaltender Filip Gustavsson made 25 saves on 27 shots to earn the win. Predators goaltender Juuse Saros gave up three goals on 28 shots. Kaprizov prompted the game-winning goal when he carried the puck into the offensive zone and flipped a backhand pass toward Spurgeon in the slot. Spurgeon buried a one-timer for his third goal of the season, all of which have come during the past two games. It marked the second game-winning goal in as many days for Spurgeon, who lifted the Wild to a 3-2 win over the Chicago Blackhawks on Friday afternoon. The Wild seized a 1-0 lead with 1:03 to go in the first period. Chisholm ripped a slap shot through traffic and into the net for his first goal of the season and the fourth of his career. Nashville evened the score with 21 seconds left in the first period, as Svechkov tallied his first NHL goal on a one-timer from the right circle. The 21-year-old Svechkov celebrated along the boards before his teammates greeted him with fist bumps and hugs. He was the Predators' first-round pick (No. 19 overall) in 2021. Nashville grabbed a 2-1 lead on the power play with 17:31 remaining in the second period. Steven Stamkos fired a hard pass to the slot and O'Reilly redirected it into the net for his fifth goal. The Wild responded with a power-play goal of their own with 11:36 to play in the second period.

Sixteen teams are competing in the Opening Stage, which runs through Tuesday. The top eight will move on to the elimination stage, set to start on Thursday and end on Dec. 8, while the other eight squads will be eliminated.  The Swiss System format is being utilized for the Opening Stage, meaning that teams are required to go through five rounds.  Round 1 matchups were chosen via ""Next Major Slot"" rankings. Winners of those matches are designated as ""high"" teams for the second round, with the losers getting a ""low"" tag.  In the third round, teams branch off into groups once again. Those that are 2-0 are now in the ""high"" division, while any 0-2 challengers are in the ""low"" division. There is also a ""mid"" division for the 1-1 teams.  Each team then plays an opponent within their group that they have not yet faced. Winners of high-group matches get to go right to the elimination stage. Losers of low-group matches get eliminated.  Only 2-1 and 1-2 teams remain in the fourth round, and the former lands in the ""high"" group while the latter lands in the ""low"" group. Teams once again face a new foe within their group, with high-group winners moving on and low-group losers getting bounced.  In the fifth and final round, the remaining teams face off against opponents they haven't seen yet. Winners move on, losers don't.  Seeding from the second round on is based off performance and teams' initial seeds. Any matches with advancement or elimination on the line are best-of-three, while all other matches are winner-take-all.  FlyQuest beat Complexity Gaming 13-6, then topped BIG 13-5 in the second round to reach the high matches of the third round.

The Wolverines (7-5, 5-4 Big Ten) were a three-touchdown underdog but were helped by the mistake-prone Buckeyes (10-2, 7-2), who committed two turnovers and missed two field-goal attempts as Michigan won its fourth straight in the series.   The loss, coupled with No. 4 Penn State's 44-7 victory over Maryland, prevented the Buckeyes from playing Oregon in the Big Ten championship game on Dec. 7.   Ohio State defensive end Jack Sawyer intercepted Davis Warren's pass at the goal line and returned it 12 yards with 7:48 left in regulation, but the Buckeyes had to punt. Michigan used 11 plays to go 57 yards and exhausted 5:28 off the clock on the winning drive. No. 1 Oregon 49, Washington 21 The top-ranked Ducks, already locked into the Big Ten championship game next weekend against Penn State, finished a perfect regular season with a blowout win over the Huskies in Eugene, Ore. Quarterback Dillon Gabriel threw for 209 yards with two touchdowns, and the Oregon ground game gained 222 yards. Jordan James had 99 yards on 15 carries with two touchdowns, and Gabriel, Noah Whittington and Da'Jaun Riggs also scored rushing touchdowns for Oregon (12-0, 9-0). Washington (6-6, 4-5) went with Demond Williams Jr. at quarterback over the more experienced Will Rogers, who was benched in the Huskies' previous game. Williams spent much of the night running from Oregon defenders but ended up 17-for-20 for 201 yards and a touchdown pass. No. 3 Texas 17, No. 20 Texas A&M 7   Quinn Ewers passed for 218 yards and a touchdown and the Longhorns rode a dominant defensive performance to a berth in the Southeastern Conference championship game, beating the host Aggies in College Station, Texas.   Quintrevion Wisner rushed for a career-high 186 yards on 33 carries and the Longhorns (11-1, 7-1 SEC) held the Aggies (8-4, 5-3) to 244 total yards of offense to earn a meeting with No. 7 Georgia in the conference title game next Saturday in Atlanta. Texas has won five straight games since a 30-15 home loss to the Bulldogs on Oct. 19.   Marcel Reed passed for just 146 yards but added a team-high 56 rushing yards for Texas A&M, which got its only points from its defense when Will Lee III intercepted Ewers' pass and ripped off a 93-yard return for a touchdown. No. 4 Penn State 44, Maryland 7 Nicholas Singleton rushed for two touchdowns and the Nittany Lions scored 28 points in the second quarter in their blowout win over the Terrapins in State College, Pa. Drew Allar went 17-of-26 for 171 yards and a touchdown for Penn State (11-1, 8-1 Big Ten), which has won four in a row. MJ Morris threw the only touchdown for Maryland (4-8, 1-8) but also had three passes intercepted.  No. 5 Notre Dame 49, Southern California 35   Despite surrendering a season high in points, the Fighting Irish's defense came through in the clutch with pick-sixes of 99 and 100 yards to beat the Trojans in Los Angeles.   Notre Dame (11-1), which has won 10 straight games, led 35-28 but USC (6-6) was driving. Notre Dame's Christian Gray snagged an underthrown ball from Jayden Maiava near the pylon and returned it 99 yards down the sideline. Then Xavier Watts intercepted Maiava and went 100 yards to make it 49-28 with 1:18 to play. Maiava went 27-for-48 for 360 yards with three touchdown passes, all of which went to Ja'Kobi Lane. Maiava also rushed for a pair of touchdowns in the loss.   Syracuse 42, No. 6 Miami 38 Kyle McCord passed for 380 yards and three touchdowns as the host Orange rallied to upset the Hurricanes in an ACC game. Syracuse (9-3, 5-3) got two touchdown receptions from Jackson Meeks (seven catches, 110 yards). Teammate Trebor Pena caught six passes for 128 yards and one TD. A win would've put Miami in the ACC title game next Saturday against SMU. Instead, the Hurricanes (10-2, 6-2) ended their regular season with two upset losses in their final three games. Cam Ward led Miami, passing for 349 yards and two TDs. He leads the nation with 36 TD passes, and he also went over 4,000 passing yards for the season. No. 8 Tennessee 36, Vanderbilt 23   Nico Iamaleava threw for 257 yards and four touchdowns as the Volunteers stormed back from an early deficit to beat the host Commodores. Two of those scoring strikes went to Dont'e Thornton (three catches, 118 yards) while Dylan Sampson added 178 rushing yards on 25 carries.   Tennessee (10-2, 6-2 SEC) held Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia to 8-of-17 passing for 104 yards and had more snaps (73-49) and yards (538-232) than the Commodores (6-6, 3-5). Vanderbilt still got 17 first-quarter points against the Vols, who'd given up just over 13 points a game.   The Vols won't play in the SEC title game, but likely clinched a College Football Playoff berth and possibly a first-round home game. No. 9 SMU 38, Cal 6 The Mustangs jumped out to a three-touchdown lead and then sealed the game with a fourth-quarter explosion in their lopsided win over the visiting Golden Bears in an Athletic Coast Conference matchup in Dallas. SMU (11-1, 8-0 ACC) was already assured of a berth in the conference title game on Dec. 7. The Mustangs will play Clemson, which qualified when No. 6 Miami fell at Syracuse on Saturday. Kevin Jennings threw for 225 yards and two touchdowns. Brashard Smith had rushing and receiving scores, and Derrick McFall also ran for a touchdown for SMU, which won its ninth in a row. Chandler Rogers had 84 yards passing before leaving with an apparent leg injury in the third quarter for Cal (6-6, 2-6), and CJ Harris came on to throw for 75 yards and had one interception. Nyziah Hunter finished with 85 yards on five receptions. No. 10 Indiana 66, Purdue 0 Kurtis Rourke threw for 349 yards and six touchdowns as the Hoosiers appear headed for an unlikely spot in the College Football Playoff after their lopsided Big Ten Conference rout of the Boilermakers in Bloomington, Ind. Picked 17th among 18 teams in the conference's preseason poll, Indiana improved to 11-1 overall and 8-1 in the conference. Though the Hoosiers lost the tiebreaker to No. 4 Penn State to meet No. 1 Oregon in the conference title game on Dec. 7, they should be among the 12-team CFP field when it's announced on Dec. 8. Their defense stifled hapless Purdue (1-11, 0-9), which managed just 67 yards and five first downs in absorbing its 11th straight loss. No. 15 South Carolina 17, No. 12 Clemson 14 LaNorris Sellers ran for two touchdowns and amassed a combined 330 yards rushing and passing to lead the Gamecocks to a comeback victory over the host Tigers. Sellers led the Gamecocks (9-3) on a nine-play, 75-yard drive that he capped with a 20-yard touchdown run to put them ahead by the eventual winning margin with 1:08 left in the fourth quarter. Clemson (9-3) had one last chance and drove toward the red zone. But Demetrius Knight Jr. made a diving interception with 12 seconds remaining to seal the Gamecocks' second win in three seasons in the Palmetto Bowl series and second in a row at Clemson. No. 13 Alabama 28, Auburn 14 Quarterback Jalen Milroe rushed for 104 yards and three touchdowns and the Crimson Tide bolstered their playoff possibilities with a victory over the visiting Tigers in the Iron Bowl at Tuscaloosa, Ala. Milroe completed 18 of 24 passes for 256 yards and one interception as Alabama (9-3, 5-3 SEC) bounced back from last week's 24-3 road loss to Oklahoma. The victory could return the Crimson Tide to the top 10 when Tuesday's latest College Football Playoff rankings are unveiled. Justice Haynes rushed for a touchdown and Germie Bernard had seven receptions for 111 yards for Alabama. Payton Thorne was 24-of-41 passing for 301 yards, one touchdown and one interception for the Tigers (5-7, 2-6), who clinched their fourth straight losing campaign. No. 16 Arizona State 49, Arizona 7   Cam Skattebo rushed for 177 yards on 21 carries with three touchdowns to lead the visiting Sun Devils past the archrival Wildcats in Tucson, Ariz.   Arizona State (10-2, 7-2 Big 12) will face Iowa State in the Big 12 championship game Dec. 7. Sam Leavitt completed 17 of 22 pass attempts for 291 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions for the Sun Devils, who piled up 643 yards in total offense.   Arizona (4-8, 2-7) ended coach Brent Brennan's first season by losing seven of its last eight games. Receiver Tetairoa McMillan, a projected NFL first-round draft pick, finished with six receptions for 68 yards and a touchdown. Noah Fifita, a preseason Heisman hopeful, completed 14 of 29 pass attempts for 126 yards with a touchdown and no interceptions.  No. 18 Iowa State 29, No. 24 Kansas State 21   The Cyclones scored 14 points off turnovers and defeated the Wildcats on a frigid night in Ames, Iowa.   Iowa State (10-2, 7-2), which will face Arizona State in the Big 12 title game, last won a conference football championship in 1912 when they were members of the Missouri Valley Conference. Iowa State has 10 wins in a season for the first time in school history.   Rocco Becht threw for 137 yards and two touchdowns for the Cyclones. Avery Johnson racked up 220 yards passing and three touchdowns for the Wildcats (8-4, 5-4), who have lost three of their past four games. No. 19 BYU 30, Houston 18 Jake Retzlaff passed for 167 yards and added two rushing touchdowns as BYU rode a stifling defensive performance to beat Houston in Provo, Utah. Retzlaff scored on runs of 13 and 7 yards, the latter coming with 2:52 remaining in the game to help BYU (10-2, 7-2 Big 12) reclaim its two-possession advantage.   Zeon Chriss passed for 156 yards and ran for two scores for Houston (4-8, 3-6). No. 21 Missouri 28, Arkansas 21 Brady Cook ran for a 30-yard go-ahead touchdown with 1:53 remaining, lifting the Tigers over the Razorbacks in a snowy Battle Line Rivalry matchup in Columbia, Mo.   Cook had a quiet day through the air (10-of-20, 168 yards), as Missouri (9-3, 5-3 SEC) opted to lean on Marcus Carroll (22 carries, 90 yards, two TDs).    Taylen Green was 21-of-35 passing for 229 yards and added 53 rushing yards for Arkansas (6-6, 3-5). Ja'Quinden Jackson ran 18 times for 87 yards and three TDs to fuel the Arkansas offense. Andrew Armstrong registered 128 yards on nine receptions. No. 22 UNLV 38, Nevada 14   Hajj-Malik Williams threw for 168 yards, ran for 104 more and accounted for three touchdowns as the Rebels beat the visiting rival Wolf Pack in Las Vegas to clinch a berth in next week's Mountain West Championship Game.   Jacob De Jesus led UNLV (10-2, 6-1) with a season-high 84 yards receiving, while Ricky White III added five receptions for 55 yards and a touchdown in each player's final home game at UNLV. Jai'Den Thomas led the team in rushing with 135 yards on 15 carries, equaling his total from last week's win at San Jose State in 11 fewer carries.   Nevada quarterback Brendon Lewis finished with 292 passing yards, two touchdowns and an interception, completing 27 of his 37 pass attempts. UNLV outgained Nevada (3-10, 0-7) 519-359 in total net yards and outgained it 351-67 on the ground. No. 23 Illinois 38, Northwestern 28   Aidan Laughery ran for 172 yards and three touchdowns, both career highs, to propel the Fighting Illini past the Wildcats at Wrigley Field in Chicago.   The sophomore running back needed just 12 carries to orchestrate his career day and ripped off three runs of 30 or more yards, including a 64-yard touchdown scamper that put Illinois (9-3, 6-3 Big Ten) ahead 21-10 early in the second half.  After Northwestern (4-8, 2-7) pulled within 28-20 entering the fourth quarter, Laughery broke off a 31-yard run to replenish the Fighting Illini's two-score lead.   The Wildcats used two quarterbacks in the loss, their third straight to end the season. Jack Lausch played most of the snaps and threw for 287 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions on 25-of-48 passing. Before the game, head coach David Braun said freshman quarterback Ryan Boe would take snaps with his team out of bowl contention. Boe completed 4 of 13 throws for 42 yards with an interception. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Emanuel Sharp scored 23 points and L.J. Cryer scored 21 for Houston (4-3), which lost to No. 9 Alabama in overtime on Tuesday night, the opening night of the tournament. Both teams traded leads in the first half of overtime before Byrd's reverse layup gave the Aztecs a 70-67 lead with 1:28 left. Boyd then put San Diego State up five with a driving layup with 43 seconds remaining. Magoon Gwath made one of two free throws with 12 seconds remaining to extend the lead to 73-70 before Cryer missed a 3-pointer with two seconds left. Coleman-Jones banked in an off-balance shot with one foot over the 3-point line to cut it to 65-63 with 57 seconds left in regulation. J'Wan Roberts then missed the front end of a 1-and-1 situation and Byrd grabbed an offensive rebound on the other end, was fouled and made both free throws to tie it at 65 with 13 seconds left. San Diego State scored the first six points of the game and the Cougars didn't put points on the board until Joseph Tugler made a layup with 15:24 left in the half.

Coleman-Jones tried to spark a rally by scoring four straight points for the Aztecs, but another 3-pointer by Cryer extended the lead back to double digits. Byrd hit a 3 with 11:44 remaining to cut the deficit to four, but Houston scored five straight points. Boyd cut it to 54-52 with 7:40 left after sinking 3-pointers on back-to-back possessions. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Carnesecca was at the helm for 24 seasons, getting two stints with the Red Storm (1965-70, 1973-92). St. John's broke the news of his death and mentioned that he passed away surrounded by family.  None of Carnesecca's teams ever recorded a losing season, with all 24 of them qualifying for a postseason tournament.  The Red Storm went to 18 NCAA Tournaments under Carnesecca.  Carnesecca was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1992, then landed in the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame 14 years later. He was a two-time National Coach of the Year, a three-time Big East Coach of the Year and a six-time Metropolitan Coach of the Year.  Hailing from New York, Carnesecca stayed local for college and attended St. John's, but before doing so, he served in the United States Coast Guard for three years during World War II. When he wasn't coaching the Red Storm, Carnesecca was with the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association. He was only in as coach for three seasons (1971-73), but during that time, New York didn't miss the playoffs once, even reaching the ABA Finals in 1972.  Carnesecca leaves his wife of 73 years, Mary. In a news release, St. John's said that details of memorial services will be released when they become available.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Jones added six rebounds for Marquette (8-0), which is off to its best start since winning 10 straight to begin the 2011-12 campaign, which ended with a Sweet 16 appearance. Ben Gold added 12 points, while Stevie Mitchell scored 10 and had three steals. David Joplin, Caedin Hamilton and Royce Parham each netted nine points for the Golden Eagles. The Catamounts (2-4) were led by Bernard Pelote's 13 points and eight boards. Jamar Livingston chipped in 10 points and CJ Hyland bundled five points with five rebounds and six assists. Marquette controlled most of the game, thanks largely to 51.4 percent shooting and 21 takeaways. The Golden Eagles built a 16-point lead in the first half before Western Carolina clawed within 37-28 with 3:55 left. Marquette responded with a 12-2 run to take a 49-30 advantage into the break, its largest lead of the game to that point. The game quickly got out of hand from there, with the Golden Eagles eventually scoring 11 straight points to push its lead to 81-45 with 7:15 remaining. Marquette finished with 26 points off of Catamount turnovers and hit 14 of 40 shots (35.0 percent) from 3-point range. The win wasn't all smooth sailing for the Golden Eagles, who lost backup guard Zaide Lowery to an apparent left knee injury. Lowery was helped off the court and into the locker room by his teammates with 1:36 left in the game. Saturday's game was a final tune-up for Marquette, which has three challenging games coming up against No. 5 Iowa State, No. 15 Wisconsin and Dayton before Big East Conference play begins Dec. 18. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Fredrick King started in place of the injured Ryan Kalkbrenner and finished with 14 points as Creighton (5-3) ended a three-game losing streak. Steven Ashworth chipped in 15 points and six rebounds. Notre Dame (4-4) lost its fourth consecutive game despite four players scoring in double figures, including 17-point efforts from Braeden Shrewsberry and Tae Davis. Matt Allocco scored 12 and Garrett Sundra tallied 11. The Irish are still without leading scorer Markus Burton, who injured his right knee in Tuesday's overtime loss to Rutgers. Down by as many as 17, Notre Dame led 53-52 after Shrewsberry hit a 3-pointer with 10:19 to play, capping an 11-0 run. Three consecutive 3-pointers, including two by Neal, helped the Bluejays push their lead to 61-53 with under seven minutes left and never looked back. Kalkbrenner, Creighton's leading scorer (18.1 points per game) and rebounder (8.6), did not start the game due to a lower-body injury and never saw the floor. It didn't matter, with Neal rising to the occasion. He helped fuel a 9-0 run in the first half, burying a 3-pointer and scoring off a layup and free throw. Isaac Traudt then knocked down a wide-open shot from distance that pushed the Bluejays' advantage to 21-11 with 12:12 to play in the half. Creighton had its biggest lead at 30-13 with 8:17 left after Mason Miller connected from beyond the arc. Notre Dame battled back, igniting a 12-0 run highlighted by 3-pointers from J.R. Konieczny and Kebba Njie as Notre Dame closed the gap to 30-25 with 3:40 remaining. Neal's 3-pointer in the corner with 1:58 to go gave Creighton a 35-27 cushion, and his wide-open dunk with 54 seconds to play put the Bluejays back up by 10 at 37-27.

Retzlaff scored on runs of 13 and 7 yards, the latter coming with 2:52 remaining in the game to help BYU (10-2, 7-2 Big 12) reclaim its two-possession advantage. Houston (4-8, 3-6) had clawed to within six points earlier in the fourth quarter before Jack Kelly and Blake Mangelson teamed for the biggest defensive play of the contest for BYU. With Houston facing fourth-and-7 at the BYU 44, Kelly sacked Houston quarterback Zeon Chriss and forced a fumble. After a mad scramble, Mangelson made the recovery at the Houston 18.  Five plays later, Retzlaff scored on third down to secure the victory for BYU, which was eliminated from Big 12 title game contention when Iowa State defeated Kansas State earlier. Chriss passed for 156 yards and, like Retzlaff, ran for two scores. He was intercepted once. After securing a 10-7 lead, Houston slipped into an extended offensive drought. Including a one-play drive that concluded the first half, Houston amassed 55 yards over six possessions. BYU flipped the three-point deficit into a 14-point lead before Houston suddenly responded. Chriss capped a 12-play, 69-yard drive with a 1-yard touchdown run. His subsequent pass to Mekhi Mews resulted in a successful two-point conversion that pulled Houston to within 24-18 with 8:34 to play. When BYU followed with three incomplete passes and a 17-second possession, Houston had its shot. Chriss supplied Houston a 7-0 lead with his 3-yard touchdown run at the 1:47 mark of the first quarter. But Houston squandered the momentum from its 10-play, 80-yard drive by attempting an onside kick that BYU's Talan Alfrey returned 58 yards for a touchdown seven seconds later. Trailing 10-7 early in the second quarter, BYU came to life with a pair of touchdown drives en route to a 21-10 halftime lead. Sione I Moa and Retzlaff produced scoring runs of 6 and 13 yards, respectively, with Retzlaff capping a 6-play, 80-yard drive that took only 50 seconds.

The Blue Jackets went 5-1-1 over the final two weeks of November after a six-game losing streak from Nov. 1-12. They are 4-0-1 in their past five outings, most recently earning a 5-2 victory over the Calgary Flames on Friday.  ""Last year, we went on that bit of a losing skid,"" Columbus center Adam Fantilli said of the Blue Jackets' nine-game rut (0-7-2) from Nov. 4-19, 2023. ""You never want to get used to losing and having a bit of a winning culture in here, and how much fun we have with each other and how tight of a group we have, it makes it way more enjoyable to come to the rink every day."" Columbus is tied for 10th in the NHL with 77 goals scored, averaging 3.50 per game. After scoring 11 goals over the course of the recent slide during the first two weeks of November, the offense has rebounded, producing 25 markers in the past five games. Everyone has been getting in on the action to help the Blue Jackets find their way offensively. Though no one has a double-digit goal total -- Kirill Marchenko is one score away with a team-leading nine -- Columbus has eight players with at least five markers.  Fantilli became the eighth member of that group with a pair of goals against Calgary, his first tallies since Oct. 28.  ""He's been committed to doing the right things in the right areas,"" Blue Jackets coach Dean Evason said of Fantilli. ""If he continues to play like he has played literally all year -- he's had some learning curves -- but if he plays the right way defensively and sound in all areas, the scoring will come."" The Blackhawks, meanwhile, are trying to climb out of the NHL's basement. Chicago is in dead last in the entire league, just one point behind the Montreal Canadiens and two behind the Nashville Predators. Chicago has alternated wins and losses over its past five games, unable to build off big wins against the Florida Panthers and Dallas Stars. On Friday, the Blackhawks held a 2-0 lead against the Wild before Minnesota scored three times in a span of just over seven minutes to steal a 3-2 win. ""We've been playing well the last couple of games, and sometimes the other teams are going to get bounces, too,"" Chicago forward Ryan Donato said. ""It's infuriating and hard to lose games and have it be that way, especially when you get off to a good start."" Chicago has led in the second period in each of its past six games but is 2-3-1 in those contests. ""We're past the first 10 games, the first 20 games,"" Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson said. ""We got to make sure we're getting into a mode where we can hold that and sustain it and play the way we played to get to that point and even better."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Wedgewood got the news early Saturday morning and arrived in Denver on time to serve as Georgiev's backup. Colorado coach Jared Bednar also revealed that forward Miles Wood will miss a ""significant amount of time"" with an upper-body injury.  Despite the shakeup to the roster, the Avalanche jumped out to an early lead on Saturday night on their first power-play chance. Artturi Lehkonen fed Kovalenko for a one-timer at 7:02 of the first period for the latter's fourth goal of the season. Edmonton answered soon after when Connor McDavid sent a blind pass across the front of the crease to Kapanen, who knocked the puck into an open net at 11:48. It was his second marker of the season. The game remained tied until late in the second period, when Podkolzin deflected Troy Stecher's shot from the point at 13:48, his third goal of the campaign.  Colorado had several chances to score early in the third period, but it was the Oilers who struck next. They worked the puck around the Avalanche zone to Kulak at the left point, and his shot through a screen got by Georgiev at 3:56. It was his fifth goal of the season.

Utah, coming in off a 4-3 overtime loss to the Edmonton Oilers on Friday in Salt Lake City, took advantage of sloppy Vegas play to jump out to a 4-0 lead in the first period.   Keller started the barrage at the 5:33 mark with his first goal in 13 games and seventh of the season. He fired a wrist shot from the bottom of the left circle at the end of a two-on-one with Hayton after a Vegas turnover in the neutral zone.   Kerfoot made it 2-0 with a short-handed goal. Samsonov tried to clear the puck from the left corner of his zone with a long pass into the neutral zone intended for Jack Eichel but Kerfoot intercepted it near the blue line and then fired a shot past a diving Samsonov for his fifth goal.   Schmaltz snapped a 28-game goal drought dating back to last season just 69 seconds later when he scored off a one-timer from the bottom of the left circle. Cooley made it 4-0 at the 18:44 mark with his sixth goal when Olli Maatta's shot from the left point caromed in off his hip.   Utah then broke the game open with two more goals in the first 5:28 of the second period to make it 6-0. Carcone got the first when he finished a two-on-one rush with a wrist shot into the far corner from the bottom of the right circle for his first goal of the season. Schmaltz followed with his second goal of the game, firing a shot into an open net off Cooley's pass. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Oregon (8-0) coughed up a six-point lead in the final 30 seconds of regulation when Aden Holloway sliced the deficit in half with a 3-pointer after a pair of Barthelemy free throws pushed the Ducks lead to 81-75. Alabama (6-2) immediately regained possession when Mark Sears swiped the ball from Brandon Angel on the ensuing inbound pass. Sears was then fouled and split his foul shots -- but Mouhamed Dioubate rebounded the miss and was sent to the line himself, where he sank both attempts to tie the game. The Ducks put the ball in Barthelemy's hot hands on their subsequent trip down the court. He shot 4-of-5 from 3-point distance on the night and had given Oregon a critical, four-point cushion in the final minute with a hanging floater earlier. Derrion Reid got a hand on Barthelemy's attempt to alter its trajectory, but Bittle followed up for the game-winning dunk. It capped a 19-point, nine-rebound night for Bittle. Oregon also got 12 points from TJ Bamba -- the only Duck beside Barthelemy to make a 3-pointer -- and 11 points from Supreme Cook. Jackson Shelstad scored six points, with no two bigger than the pair he was awarded on a fast-break layup that underwent a lengthy video review. Shelstad swiped the ball from Grant Nelson's blindside with the score tied at 75. Jarin Stevenson's chase-down shot-block effort was called goaltending, giving Oregon the lead down the stretch. Stevenson was one of five Crimson Tide scorers in double-figures, finishing with 11 points before fouling out. Sears and Holloway added 11 each, Latrell Whitesell Jr. scored 10 points, and Labaron Philon shot 6-of-8 from the floor for a team-high 15 points. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Ferraro gave the Sharks a 1-0 lead at 16:54 of the first period when he received a pass from Granlund as he activated from the blue line. Ferraro had room to skate into the left circle before banking a shot into the net. Kunin made it 2-0 at 1:51 with a wrist shot from the top of the right circle off the rush. Ceci made it 3-0 with his first goal of the season and his first on the road in the past 128 games. Macklin Celebrini took a shot that went wide and off the end boards before coming out the other side to Ceci, who swept it into the net from a sharp angle at 8:59. Smith finished off an odd-man rush 46 seconds later to stretch the lead to 4-0. The Kraken took advantage of a favorable bounce off the end boards to break the shutout at 10:17 of the second period. Matty Beniers took a shot that went wide and caromed toward Blackwood, who poked the puck in the direction of Schwartz and he fired it into the net to cut it to 4-1. McCann scored his team-leading 10th goal of the season with a wrist shot from the left circle to narrow the lead to 4-2 at 6:27 of the third. The Kraken pulled Daccord for the extra attacker with just over three minutes left and appeared to capitalize when Beniers scored with seven seconds left, but the NHL initiated a review for goalie interference and the goal was disallowed upon review. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Joveljic's goal, assisted by Riqui Puig and Mark Delgado on a quick counterattack following a Seattle turnover, seals the second-seeded Galaxy's first finals appearance since winning their record fifth MLS Cup in 2014. Next Saturday, they will host the New York Red Bulls, who won the Eastern Conference final 1-0 earlier Saturday over Orlando City. Joveljic's goal came somewhat against the run of play, as it was fourth-seeded Seattle that had looked arguably more likely to score in the latter stages following an evenly contested first half. The Sounders were looking to make their fifth MLS Cup final appearance since 2016 in search of their third title. But they exit the playoffs having not won any of their four matches in regulation. Joveljic had been the Galaxy player who caused Seattle goalkeeper Stefan Frei the most trouble in the first half when his 19th-minute volley forced him into a somewhat awkward scrambling save. But his match-winner came seemingly out of nowhere on what was one of the very few Seattle errors on the night, when Alex Roldan played an aimless pass from his post on the right flank that fell at Delgado's feet. Delgado quickly passed forward to Puig, who took a couple touches to control and then played the ball into the path of Joveljic's clever diagonal run. Joveljic drove his finish in stride low and hard into the bottom left corner, skimming off Frei's outstretched palm on its way over the line. John McCarthy made five saves to preserve the Galaxy's second clean sheet of the playoffs, with his best moments coming before halftime. He used his leg to deny Albert Rusnak from a tight angle at the near post in the third minute, and an outstretched arm to push over Obed Vargas' free kick from just beyond the left corner of the penalty area in the 41st minute. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After the Wizards used a 9-2 run to pull within 105-103 with 4:57 remaining in the game, Milwaukee answered with 10 straight points. Prince and Lopez capped the rally with back-to-back 3-pointers to put the Bucks ahead 115-103 with 1:29 left. Milwaukee moved over .500 for the first time since winning its season opener on Oct. 23, shooting 51.2 percent from the field and 16-for-35 (45.7 percent) from 3-point range. Antetokounmpo returned after missing one game due to a left knee issue and scored 15 points in the first quarter. Poole had 12 points for Washington, which led 29-28 at the end of the period. Lillard hit a fadeaway jumper at the buzzer to end the second quarter and give the Bucks a 63-58 halftime lead. Lillard had 18 points in the first half, while Poole had 17 for the Wizards. Milwaukee extended its lead to 83-73 on Bobby Portis' 3-pointer with 4:32 left in the third quarter, but Washington battled back and trailed 92-86 at the end of the period. Washington played without forward Kyle Kuzma, who sat out with a left rib sprain. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Spurgeon and Kirill Kaprizov each finished with a goal and an assist for Minnesota, which won its third game in a row. Declan Chisholm also had a goal. Fedor Svechkov and Ryan O'Reilly each scored for Nashville, which sustained an overtime loss for the third consecutive game. Roman Josi tallied two assists. Wild goaltender Filip Gustavsson made 25 saves on 27 shots to earn the win. Predators goaltender Juuse Saros gave up three goals on 28 shots. Kaprizov prompted the game-winning goal when he carried the puck into the offensive zone and flipped a backhand pass toward Spurgeon in the slot. Spurgeon buried a one-timer for his third goal, all of which have come during the past two games. It marked the second game-winning goal in as many days for Spurgeon, who lifted the Wild to a 3-2 win over the Chicago Blackhawks on Friday afternoon. The Wild seized a 1-0 lead with 1:03 to go in the first period. Chisholm ripped a slap shot through traffic and into the net for his first goal of the season and the fourth of his career. Nashville evened the score with 21 seconds left in the first period, as Svechkov tallied his first NHL goal on a one-timer from the right circle. The 21-year-old Svechkov celebrated along the boards before his teammates greeted him with fist bumps and hugs. He was the Predators' first-round pick (No. 19 overall) in 2021. Nashville grabbed a 2-1 lead on the power play with 17:31 remaining in the second period. Steven Stamkos fired a hard pass to the slot and O'Reilly redirected it into the net for his fifth goal.

The Mustangs (11-1, 8-0 ACC) were already assured of a berth in the conference title game on Dec. 7. They will play Clemson, which qualified when No. 6 Miami fell at Syracuse on Saturday. Kevin Jennings threw for 225 yards and two touchdowns. Brashard Smith had rushing and receiving scores, and Derrick McFall also ran for a touchdown for SMU, which won its ninth in a row. The Mustangs had 251 total yards in the first half as they built a 21-0 lead but tallied only 17 yards in the third quarter before regaining steam. They finished with 415 yards to 254 for Cal. SMU also had 17 penalties for 137 yards, with 85 of those yards coming after intermission. The Mustangs' defense, meanwhile, had five sacks, two by Kobe Wilson, among their 16 tackles for loss. Jonathan McGill's interception in the fourth quarter set up Jennings' 23-yard touchdown strike to Smith to seal the win. Reserve quarterback Preston Stone hit Key'Shawn Smith for a 40-yard touchdown with 3:38 left in the game to complete the scoring. Chandler Rogers had 84 yards passing before leaving with an apparent leg injury in the third quarter for Cal (6-6, 2-6), and CJ Harris came on to throw for 75 yards and had one interception. Nyziah Hunter finished with 85 yards on five receptions. The Golden Bears' only points came on field goals of 40 and 53 yards by Ryan Coe in the second half. After picking up a combined 35 yards on its first three possessions, Cal had a golden opportunity to draw within striking distance. Trailing 21-0, the Golden Bears moved from their 25-yard line to the Mustangs' 3. But Rogers lost 2 yards on a rush, 10 more on a sack by Elijah Roberts and, after an incompletion, 5 yards for delay of game.

The Tigers (8-4, 5-3 SEC) finished the regular season with a two-game winning streak after dropping three consecutive games. The Sooners (6-6, 2-6) couldn't maintain their momentum from last week's stunning home upset of Alabama. Nussmeier was knocked from the game early in the second quarter, when he was hit from the blindside by R. Mason Thomas on a sack. But after X-rays to his clavicle were negative, Nussmeier returned with the game tied late in the second quarter and quickly made an impact. He hit four consecutive passes, the final one a 40-yard touchdown to Chris Hilton Jr. to put the Tigers ahead at the break. Then Nussmeier directed a nine-play, 88-yard touchdown drive on LSU's first drive of the third quarter, capped by a 45-yard touchdown to Hilton. Hilton, who had been limited due to injury for much of the season, did not have a touchdown this season going into the game. LSU struck first, on Kyren Lacy's 18-yard touchdown reception from Nussmeier about eight minutes into the game. Thomas helped the Sooners tie it two drives later. Oklahoma defensive tackle Gracen Halton broke through the line of scrimmage and knocked the ball loose from Nussmeier. Thomas scooped it up and returned it 9 yards for a touchdown. It was the Sooners' third consecutive game with a defensive touchdown and their fourth of the season. Oklahoma took its only lead of the game midway through the second quarter on Xavier Robinson's 2-yard run to cap a quick three-play, 75-yard scoring drive. But that lead was extremely short-lived, as Aaron Anderson returned the ensuing kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown. The Sooners tied the game 17-17 on a field goal with 2:13 left in the first half before Nussmeier returned to orchestrate the drive that turned the tide toward LSU for good. LSU outgained Oklahoma 395-277 and held the Sooners to just 4 of 11 on third downs. Oklahoma quarterback Jackson Arnold ran for 75 yards and was 14 of 21 for 110 yards through the air.

The Gators (7-5) ran for 235 yards overall and won their third game in a row. Florida also beat the Seminoles (2-10) for the first time since 2021 as Florida State finished with its worst record since finishing 1-10 in 1974. The Gators now wait to see where they will play their bowl game.  The Seminoles' defense kept the score close for most of the first half and did a solid job on Gators starting quarterback DJ Lagway, who has been an integral part of Florida's resurgence in recent weeks.  Florida State sacked Lagway three times and held him to 133 yards passing on 14-of-22 attempts. But Lagway finished with two touchdowns and one interception. Lagway helped the Gators begin to separate just before halftime when he found Marcus Burke in the corner of the end zone for a 4-yard touchdown pass with 25 seconds left in the second quarter. Leading 17-3, the Gators sealed the win with 12:38 left in the fourth quarter when Johnson broke loose for a 65-yard touchdown run.  Florida's defense consistently put pressure on Florida State quarterback Luke Kromenhoek, sacking him eight times. Cam Jackson and Jaden Robinson each had two sacks to lead the effort.  Florida's Jack Pyburn had a key strip sack, which led to D'Antre Robinson's fumble recovery with 2:54 left in the first quarter. The turnover led to Florida's first score -- Ja'Kobi Jackson's 1-yard touchdown run.  Jackson totaled 51 yards on 10 carries while Jadan Baugh had 81 yards on 11 carries.  Florida's defense finished with 14 tackles for loss and five forced fumbles. Florida State scored its lone touchdown with 3:18 left in the game on a 2-yard run by Lawrance Toafili.

After a missed field goal attempt, the Hoosiers scored touchdowns on three straight possessions an led 28-0 at halftime. For the first of those, Rourke connected with Ke'Shawn Williams for a 14-yard touchdown at the 11:31 mark, followed by an 84-yard strike to Sarratt just over four minutes later.

Simon Holmstrom had his second career multi-goal game and second in as many games. He scored New York's second goal and added an empty-netter in the final seconds. The Islanders won for the third time in their past 11 games (3-4-4) and avoided an eighth loss when leading into the final 20 minutes. They squandered a 4-2 lead in Friday's 5-4 overtime loss at Washington. Lee had his second straight multi-point showing as the Islanders struggled to generate scoring chances at times and had a goal by Matt Martin disallowed due to an offsides call in the first period. New York goalie Ilya Sorokin made 29 saves for his 19th career shutout. He highlighted New York's first shutout of the season by doing a split in the crease to make a sprawling save on Dylan Cozens during Buffalo's short-handed 2-on-1 rush with 18:49 remaining, then made four more stops when the Sabres had the extra attacker in the final minute. Buffalo lost to the Islanders for the second time this season and dropped a third straight contest for the third time this season. Buffalo goalie James Reimer made 17 saves in his second start since joining the Sabres. Twenty seconds into their first power play, the Islanders ended an 0-for-14 skid thanks to Lee getting in good position in front. He went to the net, jostled Buffalo defenseman Owen Power off the puck, got a pass from Kyle Palmieri and used his backhand to redirect the puck by Reimer. The Islanders took a 2-0 lead a little over two minutes later by finishing off a 2-on-1 following a Buffalo offensive zone turnover. Defenseman Henri Jokiharju lost the puck at the blue line and Lee sped down the left side and found Holmstrom racing through the slot.

Michkov, who doesn't turn 20 until Dec. 9, scored the decisive goal on a breakaway after Travis Konecny found him with a sprawling outlet pass while falling to the ice. Michkov also had a sparkling assist earlier in the game, while Aleksei Kolosov made 26 saves for Philadelphia. The Blues' Jake Neighbours forced overtime with a tally late in regulation, and Dylan Holloway also scored for the hosts. Jordan Binnington made 28 saves for St. Louis, which lost for the first time in three games under new coach Jim Montgomery. Following a late penalty on Konecny, the Blues tied it on a 6-on-4 advantage with 18.3 seconds left in regulation. Kolosov made a nice save on Jordan Kyrou in the slot then a sensational toe stop on Justin Faulk on the doorstep, but Neighbours poked the puck into the net as Kolosov was scrambling to smother the rebound. Trailing 1-0, the Blues tied it with 8:49 left on Holloway's seventh goal. Brayden Schenn centered it to Holloway in the slot, and he had plenty of time to gather and unleash a wrister that beat Kolosov. Less than a minute later, Bobby Brink got behind the defense and had Binnington beat, but his soft backhander hit the post. The puck just momentarily sat to the left of the crease, however, and Tyson Foerster pounced on it for his fifth goal of the campaign. Philadelphia opened the scoring 9:15 into the game on Owen Tippett's fifth goal of the season. Michkov drew the attention of a St. Louis defenseman on a 2-on-1 and slipped a perfect pass to Tippett, who shoved the puck past a helpless Binnington. With just under 10 minutes left in regulation, the Flyers had a chance to score on a Sean Couturier breakaway -- and the ensuing scramble in front -- but they were unable to poke it home.

John Tolkin provided a service from a free kick in the match's decisive moment, which continued the seventh-seeded Red Bulls' unlikely run to the MLS Cup final. New York is headed to the championship for the second time in franchise history after coming up just short against the Columbus Crew in 2008.  The Red Bulls will face the Galaxy or Sounders next weekend for the title. LA and Seattle were scheduled to play later Saturday night.  Carlos Coronel made three stops on Saturday for the Red Bulls, recording his third clean sheet of the postseason. He has made a total of 17 saves in those shutouts.  Fourth-seeded Orlando was trying to make its first MLS Cup final in its 10th season in the league. Pedro Gallese did not make any saves for the hosts.  Reyes put the Red Bulls in front only two minutes into the second half on a flawlessly executed set piece. Tolkin provided the service from the right flank, at a perfect height for Reyes to meet near the back post and with too much pace for Gallese to corral. Reyes guided his header off the inside of the upright before it continued its path across the goal line. Orlando City had the majority of the possession after going behind but seldom translated their territorial dominance into threats against Coronel.  The Lions' best opportunity came in the first half through Martin Ojeda's breakaway down the right side in the 32nd minute.

Williams opened the scoring with a 2-yard scamper to the end zone just 3:42 into the game and later provided the Horned Frogs (8-4, 6-3 Big 12) with a 17-7 lead when he once again scored from 2 yards out with 7:34 to go in the second quarter.  A pair of first-half field goals from Kyle Lemmermann -- a 27- and 35-yarder -- allowed TCU to take a commanding 20-7 advantage into the break.  It wasn't until the 5:15 mark of the fourth quarter that the Bearcats (5-7, 3-6) got any closer, doing so at the end of a 12-play, 94-yard drive. Quarterback Brendan Sorsby rushed for an 8-yard TD, but the point after was no good, leaving Cincinnati behind 20-13.  After eventually getting the ball back with one minute left in the game, the Bearcats managed to work their way to the TCU 40, where Sorsby let a deep ball fly that fell incomplete as the clock hit zeros.  Josh Hoover completed 18 of 35 passes for 212 yards and was picked off once as the Horned Frogs ended the regular season on a three-game winning streak. Hauss Hejny had 48 yards on eight carries to headline the rushing attack.  Sorsby was 21-for-34 passing for 160 yards and an interception. He also had 93 yards and the score on the ground on 12 touches.  Cincinnati rushed for 213 yards in all, getting 110 on 23 carries from Corey Kiner, who also found the end zone.  Kiner cut the Bearcats' deficit to 10-7 with 11:12 remaining in the first half, punctuating a seven-play, 75-yard march with a 1-yard plunge over the goal line.

Clippers coach Tyronn Lue's team is back in Los Angeles after a 2-2 road stretch, capped by a gripping 93-92 loss against the Minnesota Timberwolves in NBA Cup action on Friday night. James Harden's four-point play gave the Clippers a three-point lead, 90-87, with 4:10 left in the game before a chaotic finish. Anthony Edwards responded for the Timberwolves with a steal and dunk, a go-ahead 3-pointer and a late free throw. Despite the closing stages not going to plan, Lue preferred to focus on the positives, notably the way the Clippers continue to defend and press. ""I liked our defense all night,"" Lue said after his side held the opposition under 100 points for the sixth time in its past seven outings. ""I thought it was going to be hard for them to score on us -- which it was. ... To hold this team to 40 points in the second half was huge for us."" Harden (20 points, 11 assists) and Ivica Zubac (16 points, 13 rebounds) chalked up double-doubles for Los Angeles in the narrow defeat. Kevin Porter Jr. had 17 points off the bench before hobbling off the court inside the last 90 seconds after hurting his left ankle. Porter will not play on Sunday, and veteran guard/forward Norman Powell (left hamstring strain), who is averaging a team-high 23.3 points per game for the Clippers, is listed as questionable.  Powell has not played since Nov. 18. While Lue has praised the way the Clippers have executed defensively, Denver coach Michael Malone hasn't shared the same view about his own team, even after the Nuggets comfortably eclipsed the Utah Jazz 122-103 on Wednesday. Nikola Jokic was dominant -- per usual -- with 30 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists, continuing his banner campaign, during which he is averaging career highs in points per game (29.7), assists per game (10.6) and 3-point shooting percentage (53.4). He is also grabbing 13.1 rebounds per contest.  He appears well on track to become the sixth player in NBA history -- joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan, Bill Russell, LeBron James and Wilt Chamberlain -- to win four MVPs. Jokic most recently took home the award at the end of last season.  But despite Jokic's individual brilliance and the ease of Denver's victory, Malone believes the Nuggets are still some distance short of reaching the lofty levels of success that they had been accustomed to over the previous two seasons. ""Our defense so far has just been really inconsistent,"" Malone said. ""And obviously, where does that start? It starts in transition. It flows into the paint, and it finishes with the rebounding. And then aside from those areas, I think it also has to go to just being more physical, more urgent and more disciplined.  ""And there are simple mistakes that we're making that are breakdowns in our game plan or personnel. And we have to stop making those if we want to be a team that is gonna be a top-10 defense. We're far from that right now."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Spurs played twice at Sacramento last season, but Wembanyama performed just once before the Kings' fans. He had 19 points, 13 rebounds, five steals and five blocks in his Sacramento debut last February, a game the Kings won 127-122. He sat out the other game with a sprained ankle. The Kings swept the three-game series last season, but Wembanyama broke into the win column against the Western Conference rivals with 34 points, 14 rebounds and three blocks in a 116-96 thumping in San Antonio on Nov. 11. This matchup opens a two-game trip for the Spurs, who could be excused for looking ahead to Tuesday's NBA Cup contest at Phoenix. San Antonio will enter that round-robin finale in a three-way tie atop the West Group B with the Suns and Oklahoma City Thunder. The Spurs saw a four-game winning streak come to an end Wednesday in a 119-101 home loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. Wembanyama had 20 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks in the defeat. Th club found a silver lining in the blowout with Devin Vassell having returned from a five-game absence due to a knee injury to contribute 14 points off the bench in 21 minutes. ""(It) feels good to have him back,"" Wembanyama said. ""He opens up our floor. He's a great offensive player. I'm still looking forward to expanding our game even more once he gets all his minutes back."" Vassell contributed 12 points and four assists off the bench to the earlier win over the Kings. Wembanyama got plenty of support during the team's recent winning streak from rookie Stephon Castle, who averaged 17.5 points and 5.5 rebounds during the run. Sacramento has featured a different look of its own the last two games, with Jae Crowder having not only joined the team but been stuck right in the starting lineup. The 13-year veteran, signed as a free agent, made his season debut with eight points and four rebounds in 27 minutes in a 115-104 win at Minnesota on Wednesday. He then had 10 points and two rebounds in Friday's 115-106 loss at Portland, the Kings' fifth defeat in their last six games. Kings coach Mike Brown was not surprised to see Crowder make an immediate impact despite having played just a total of 68 games the previous two seasons. ""Jae has been around a long time,"" Brown cited. ""He's been in the playoffs 11 straight years, so he knows what it takes to win. He isn't going to back down."" Crowder has yet to play alongside DeMar DeRozan, who has missed Sacramento's last two games with a sore back. He remains questionable for Sunday's game against his former team. Domantas Sabonis had his fourth triple-double of the season in Friday's loss at Portland, putting up 21 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists. He logged 22 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists in Wembanyama's lone visit to Sacramento last season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Kansas pulled away methodically in the second half, as the Jayhawks' lead reached 20 points with 13:22 left in the game.   The first half was a contrast in styles. Furman held an 18-point advantage beyond the arc, but the Jayhawks had a 38-8 edge from closer range.   Furman was hot from distance early in the game. Smith and Hien combined to go 4-of-5 on 3-pointers and the game was tied at 14-all with 13:34 to play.   Just over a minute later, the Jayhawks began a 13-2 run to open a nine-point lead, but Furman answered with an 8-0 run of its own to trim its deficit to 27-26. That's as close as the Paladins would get.  Kansas answered with an 8-0 spurt and finished the half on a 12-2 run to lead 39-28. Furman finished 6-of-23 from 3-point range in the half.   Adams led the Jayhawks with 13 points on 6-of-7 shooting. Hien led the Paladins with eight points. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Mississippi State product was the No. 16 overall pick in 2023, but he has had trouble finding consistent playing time in parts of two NFL seasons. Forbes, 23, has appeared in just six games this season, with one start, one interception and seven tackles. For his career, Forbes has seven starts over 20 games, with two interceptions and 45 tackles. The Commanders traded for four-time Pro Bowl cornerback Marshon Lattimore in early November, though Lattimore has been slow to recover from a hamstring injury. He was limited in practice this week and isn't expected to play Sunday. On Saturday, the Commanders also placed running back Austin Ekeler on injured reserve.  Ekeler, 29, joined Washington this offseason after seven seasons with the Los Angeles Chargers. A spot starter with 355 yards and four touchdowns rushing this season, Ekeler has rushed for more than 4,700 yards in his career and has an additional 4,230 receiving yards, with 73 total touchdowns. Washington also elevated defensive tackle Carl Davis and kicker Zane Gonzalez from the practice squad. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Raptors fell to the Heat 121-111 Friday night in an NBA Cup game to conclude a 1-3 road trip. Afterward, Toronto coach Darko Rajakovic said that he was looking forward to the rematch. ""I'm really, really excited because we're going to play the same team in less than 48 hours, so it's going to be a mini-playoff series,"" Rajakovic said. ""We're going to watch film, learn from it and get better."" A player from each team had a triple-double on Friday. Miami's Bam Adebayo had 14 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists for the eighth triple-double of his career. Toronto's Scottie Barnes had 24 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists for the sixth of his career. The Raptors should take comfort in playing at home, where they are 4-4. The Heat, who have won four of their past five games and two in a row, are 5-4 on the road. RJ Barrett led Toronto with 25 points on Friday while Jakob Poeltl added 24 points and 10 rebounds. The Heat took over the game on Friday with a 38-23 third quarter after trailing by three points at halftime. Toronto still led 79-77 with 4:23 to play in the third, but the frame ended with Miami leading 96-84. ""We know what we're capable of when we play the right way,"" said Miami's Jimmy Butler, who had eight of his 26 points in the third quarter. Tyler Herro had nine of his 23 points in the third. Reserve Jaime Jaquez Jr. had eight of his season-best 15 points in the third quarter. ""It was the second part of the third quarter that we just could not hold it,"" Rajakovic said. ""They started getting hot, making shots. They ended up the game with 21 threes."" Toronto had 11 3-pointers and also committed 19 turnovers leading to 27 points. Miami committed 10 turnovers leading to 14 points. ""Our (19) to their (10) turnovers and their 3-point shooting and our 3-point shooting, that was the biggest difference in the game,"" Rajakovic said. Rajakovic feels that the turnovers can be corrected with better passing on fast breaks. ""We were trying to punish them in transition and some of those passes were not precise enough,"" he said. Adebayo has had two consecutive games with 10 assists and 10 rebounds. ""We want to take advantage of (Adebayo's passing) as much as possible and want him to be aggressive, put pressure on the defense at the rim,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""He's managing that extremely well. That probably puts a lot of pressure on teams scouting against us when Bam gets double-digit assists. A lot can go wrong for your defense when he's in play-making mode."" ""That's what it's all about, trying to get easy looks (for teammates),"" Adebayo said. ""He's getting everyone the ball in position where they can score,"" Butler said. Jaquez hit two 3-pointers during Miami's 19-5 late-third-quarter surge. ""We want (Jaquez) to be aggressive,"" Spoelstra said. ""Part of that aggressiveness, there is a lot of responsibility to make the right read and bring a second defender. If he continues to get to his spots, teams will do that. He was assertive on his catches. He has been working diligently on his shooting."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Even without Chet Holmgren and Alex Caruso, both sidelined by hip injuries, the Thunder remain in first place in the West. Their 101-93 road victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday was their fourth in succession and seventh in nine games, with Oklahoma City set to conclude a four-game road trip against the Houston Rockets -- just 1 1/2 games back of the Thunder -- on Sunday. The Thunder have been forced to grind a bit offensively without Holmgren, ranking 12th in the league in offensive rating (114.4 points per 100 possessions) over the nine games that he has missed with a pelvic fracture. Oklahoma City remains buoyed by its league-leading defense, but while Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored a game-high 36 points against the Lakers, the Thunder shot only 40.9 percent while missing 27 of 40 3-pointers. Losing Holmgren certainly undermines offensive efficiency, but the Thunder experienced similar issues last season after racing out of the gate and establishing themselves as a Western Conference title contender by winning 22 of 31 games before the calendar flipped to 2024. ""It's similar to last season where we got off to a good start ... and teams started to scheme and throw different things at us,"" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. ""And the first time through that you see those things can be challenging. But you'd rather see them in November and December than wait to see them later in the year because it allows you to calibrate. It allows you to work on those things."" Only one of the Rockets' six losses has yielded a double-digit margin: a 126-107 road loss to the Thunder on Nov. 8. Houston's other five losses came by a combined 21 points, making its performance against Oklahoma City an early outlier and worthy of intensive review. Gilgeous-Alexander scored 29 points on 11-of-16 shooting while logging only 29 minutes in the victory. Although he produces matchup difficulties for most opponents -- Gilgeous-Alexander is third in the NBA in scoring (29.8 points per game) -- the Rockets aim to construct a sounder approach to defending him this time around, with a blueprint established against other high-scoring guards serving as the template on Sunday. Dillon Brooks and Amen Thompson are likely to share the individual responsibility in defending Gilgeous-Alexander, but the Rockets' aggressiveness must set the foundation for their plan. ""We were back on our heels a little bit too much and he was getting a head of steam getting downhill and attacking,"" Rockets coach Ime Udoka said of Gilgeous-Alexander. ""We're going to switch and do what we do there but similar to (Tyrese) Maxey and Anthony Edwards, where we were the aggressor in our switches, being aggressive and not sitting on our heels where he's attacking downhill the whole time, we'd like to do that. ""Just show him more of a crowd. He was free to move and had a lot of room to operate. We're going to make him guess a little bit more."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Bailey, a true freshman, completed 14 of 20 passes and also rushed for 54 yards on 14 carries. Hollywood Smothers paced the rushing attack with 83 yards and two touchdowns on 13 carries, while also picking up 34 receiving yards on three catches for the Wolfpack (6-6, 3-5 ACC). Jacolby Criswell threw for 273 yards and three touchdowns on 18-of-33 passing for the Tar Heels (6-6, 3-5 ACC). Omarion Hampton totaled 253 yards of total offense and two touchdowns on 26 touches. The Wolfpack are assured of a non-losing regular-season record for the 10th time in 12 seasons under coach Dave Doeren.  The loss marked the final regular-season game for the Tar Heels under Mack Brown, who is in his sixth season of his second stint leading the program. It remains unclear if Brown will coach North Carolina in its bowl game. With 1:51 left to play, Hampton snagged a short shovel pass from Criswell, knifed through the teeth of the defense, outran five defenders and dragged another into the end zone, covering 47 yards. His 40th career touchdown leaves him third in program history -- and the extra point gave North Carolina a one-point advantage. But NC State quickly responded, driving 75 yards in just six plays and 86 seconds. The drive was highlighted by Bailey connecting with Noah Rogers, covered by two defenders, for 44 yards. Smothers capped the possession with a 2-yard scamper. The Wolfpack scored on all six of their possessions in the second half. For the game, they led in time of possession by about 11 minutes. After the game, several players from both sides were involved in a fight on the field. The Tar Heels played the majority of the game without one of their top pass rushers, Kaimon Rucker -- who has six sacks and an interception this season -- after he was hit by an NC State player away from the action on a play in the first quarter.  Rucker had to be carted off the field and did not return. The team said he suffered a lower body injury. The Wolfpack got on the board first thanks to a 2-yard touchdown run by Smothers. The score was set up by Wolfpack edge rusher Davin Vann, who took possession back for NC State with a strip sack. Vann picked up his sixth force fumble of the season after entering the weekend leading FBS. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Notre Dame (11-1) pulled ahead by two touchdowns late in the third quarter when Riley Leonard connected with Mitchell Evans for a 23-yard score. It was the second of Leonard's two touchdown passes on a 17-of-23, 155-yard day, and his third score overall after a 2-yard end-zone rush earlier in the third quarter broke a 21-21 tie. Leonard's scoring strike to Evans also gave the Fighting Irish the first two-possession lead of the game, but it did not last long. USC (6-6) capitalized on favorable field position when Jayden Maiava threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Ja'Kobi Lane to finish a 45-yard Trojans drive and make it 35-28 with 8:43 to play in the fourth quarter. USC regained possession less than three minutes later after forcing a Notre Dame punt, and Maiava completed passes of 16, two and 22 yards before Quinten Joyner rushed 23 yards to position the Trojans at the Irish 21-yard line. Maiava targeted Kyron Hudson on a pass near the pylon, but Christian Gray snagged the underthrown ball and returned it 99 yards down the sideline for a score to put the game away. Notre Dame snuffed out any hope of a last-ditch USC comeback effort when, on the next Trojans possession, Xavier Watts intercepted Maiava and went 100 yards to make it 49-28 with 1:18 to play. With the win, the Fighting Irish likely sewed up a berth in the College Football Playoff. Coupled with Ohio State's loss earlier in the day, Notre Dame is in position to move into one of four first-round byes. Jadarian Price led Notre Dame's 258-yard rushing attack with 111 yards on 12 carries. Jeremiyah Love ran for 99 yards on 13 carries, and Leonard carried for 50 yards on 12 attempts. All three scored a touchdown. Evans led the Irish with five receptions for 59 yards, and Eli Raridon caught a 12-yard touchdown pass from Leonard in the second quarter. Maiava went 27-for-49 for 360 yards with three touchdown passes, all of which went to Lane. Maiava also rushed for a pair of touchdowns.

Green found Armstrong for 25 yards on fourth-and-8, and two plays later, Jackson rushed up the middle for a 9-yard score as Arkansas slipped in front by a point.   However, the Tigers only needed about 2 1/2 minutes to get back in front, as Cook scrambled up the middle for the decisive score (and the Tigers tacked on the two-point conversion). The Razorbacks drove to the Missouri 32 in the final minute, but Green's final three passes fell incomplete as the game ended.   Following a 7-7 first half, the visitors needed only six plays to find the end zone on their first possession of the third quarter, as Jackson found space on the right side and scampered for a 12-yard score.   Missouri then drove the ball inside the 10, but a false start penalty on fourth-and-1 scrapped any plans of a fourth-down attempt. Instead, the Tigers settled for a 28-yard field goal by Blake Craig, making it 14-10.   On the next play from scrimmage, Jackson fumbled and Carroll quickly made the Razorbacks pay with a 1-yard TD run with 13:45 remaining as the Tigers jumped ahead 17-14.   Following an Arkansas punt, Cook found Theo Wease for 70 yards to set up Craig's 34-yard field goal, making it 20-14 with 9:39 to play.   Arkansas standout defensive lineman Landon Jackson was injured making a tackle in the first half. He was taken off on a stretcher and brought to a local hospital, where he reportedly had movement in all of his extremities.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Arizona State (10-2, 7-2 Big 12) has put itself in potential position to play in the conference championship game with the victory, the Sun Devils' first win against Arizona since 2021. Arizona (4-8, 2-7) ended coach Brent Brennan's first season losing seven of its last eight games. The Wildcats allowed Arizona State 643 yards in total offense while they mustered 210. Skattebo had 113 of his yards and his three touchdowns in the first half when Arizona State led 35-0. Kyson Brown rushed eight times for 100 yards. Sam Leavitt completed 17 of 22 pass attempts for 291 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions. Backup Trenton Bourguet, a Tucson native, completed 2 of 3 passes for 71 yards and a touchdown in his return home. Arizona receiver Tetairoa McMillan, a projected NFL first-round draft pick, likely played his last game in college. He finished with six receptions for 68 yards and a touchdown. Noah Fifita, a preseason Heisman hopeful, completed 14 of 29 pass attempts for 126 yards with a touchdown and no interceptions. Arizona State scored a touchdown on its first four possessions to take control, leading 28-0 with 6:28 left in the second quarter. Skattebo scored three of those touchdowns and Leavitt connected on a 13-yard touchdown pass with Jordyn Tyson for the other score. Arizona State extended the lead to 35-0 with 41 seconds left in the half on a 22-yard pass from Leavitt to Chamon Metayer. Arizona scored its lone touchdown taking the first possession of the second half 75 yards on eight plays, capped by Fifita's 28-yard pass to McMillan. The Wildcats had a chance to cut into the lead more after Arizona State's Parker Lewis missed a 21-yard field goal. Arizona was forced to punt on its next possession. Arizona State extended the lead to 42-7 with 14:55 left on a 31-yard pass from Leavitt to Xavier Guillory. Bourguet had the final score, a 64-yard scoring toss to Derek Eusebio. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After taking down the Hurricanes 6-3 in Raleigh on Friday, the Panthers returned home and their offense continued to dominate. Aaron Ekblad, Mackie Samoskevich, Sam Bennett, Aleksander Barkov, Adam Boqvist and Evan Rodrigues all lit the lamp for the Panthers. Hurricanes netminder Spencer Martin allowed five goals on 28 shots before being relieved of his duties in the third period en route to his second loss to Florida in as many days. Hurricanes top scorer Martin Necas failed to find the back of the net for the third consecutive game despite a pair of partial breakaway opportunities in the first period. At 14:20 of the opening frame, Necas sprung loose, but Knight got his blocker in the way of the sniper's wrist shot. The Hurricanes' superstar had another chance at 7:34 of the first period as he flew down the wing, but Knight again turned the shot aside. The host team thought they broke the deadlock less than three minutes into the second period, but Anton Lundell's goal was taken off the board after the play was ruled offside following a challenge from the Hurricanes. At 13:18 of the second period, Ekblad took advantage of an out-of-position Martin as he lit the lamp for the game's opening goal and his first of the season. The Panthers extended their lead to two with less than one second remaining in the second period, as Samoskevich finished off a beautiful piece of passing. Just more than eight minutes into the third period, Bennett scored his third goal in as many games after Eetu Luostarinen stole the puck and fed him out front. The Panthers then struck 11 seconds apart as Barkov scored on the power play, followed up by Boqvist's goal with 8:12 left in the game to chase Martin from the net. Yaniv Perets came on in relief. Rodrigues then tipped the third shot Perets faced past him for the Panthers' third consecutive power-play goal. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Scarlet Knights (7-5, 4-5) controlled both sides of the scrimmage line after a slow start, more than doubling the Spartans in rushing yardage and gobbling up 35 minutes of clock. Athan Kaliakmanis added 157 passing yards on 13-of-22 accuracy, along with a touchdown. Michigan State (5-7, 3-6) was seeking to become bowl-eligible but saw its season end with an emphatic thud. The Spartans managed 13 first downs, and after a promising start on the ground that saw them rush for 99 yards in the first quarter and a half, barely reached 100 yards for the day. Michigan State initiated the scoring less than three minutes in as Nate Carter ripped off a 26-yard touchdown run. But that was it for the Spartans' attack until Aidan Chiles found Jack Velling for a 5-yard strike with 7:21 left in the game. Chiles finished 13-of-23 passing for 150 yards. By then, Rutgers had more than done its damage. It took the lead for good before the midway point of the first quarter behind Monangai's 7-yard touchdown run and the first of Jai Patel's four field goals, a 25-yarder. Antwan Raymond made it 17-7 at the 6:07 mark of the second quarter with a 13-yard scoring jaunt, capping a 94-yard drive. Patel then punched 42 and 30-yard field goals through snow and a stiff wind in the final 90 seconds of the half for a 23-7 advantage. The Scarlet Knights essentially ended the game's competitive phase on the first drive of the second half, chewing up 7 1/2 minutes to drive 75 yards. Kaliakmanis finished it off with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Ian Strong. Patel added his fourth field goal, a 29-yarder, with 10:55 left in the game to cap off another seven-minute drive. Raymond tacked on a 5-yard scoring jaunt with 1:57 remaining. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Win No. 11 on the season sends the one-loss Nittany Lions to Indianapolis for the Big Ten conference championship game to challenge No. 1 Oregon in Indianapolis next Saturday. Penn State running back Nick Singleton scored two touchdowns and Tyler Warren, the Nittany Lions' record-setting tight end, had another game for the books. After trailing 7-3 at the end of the first quarter, the Nittany Lions (11-1, 8-1 Big Ten) found overdrive in the second quarter, scoring four touchdowns before halftime. Quarterback Drew Allar's desperate toss behind the line of scrimmage to his left found Warren, who hurdled one tackler, busted through another and kept driving for what registered as a 29-yard run to set up PSU's third rushing touchdown in a span of barely six minutes to give the Nittany Lions a 24-7 lead with 6:53 left in the half. Penn State wasn't done, with Warren catching a 7-yard scoring pass from Allar to make it 31-7 with 1:46 left in the second quarter. In all, the Nittany Lions scored the game's final 44 points after spotting the Terrapins an early 7-0 lead. Allar plowed for a 1-yard touchdown with 10:11 on the clock in the second quarter to make it 17-7, Beau Pribula jogged in from 6 yards out a few ticks under the seven-minute mark, then Penn State took the ball right back. Audavion Collins intercepted MJ Morris to set up Allar's TD pass to Warren -- the tight end's 17th career touchdown reception (a school record for the position). Moments after Happy Valley erupted in celebration of the Michigan upset at Ohio State, Maryland took the air out of the stadium. Maryland forced a fumble on Penn State's opening play and the Terrapins scored a touchdown on their first offensive snap -- a 25-yard pass from Morris to Kaden Prather -- to claim a 7-0 lead. Warren set the Big Ten career record for receptions by a tight end with a catch in the first quarter, which was his 15th gain of 20-plus yards in 2024. The same 13-play drive ended with Penn State's first touchdown of the game, Singleton's 2-yard plunge off left guard two minutes into the second quarter. Singleton later broke through for an 18-yard score in the fourth quarter. Pribula rounded out the scoring with a 15-yard touchdown pass to Tyseer Denmark on the game's final play.

Garbers completed 26-of-40 passes without an interception for the third straight game. Moliki Matavao was Garbers' top target, catching eight passes for 120 yards for UCLA (5-7) in its season finale. Mikey Keene completed 30-of-43 passes for 219 yards and a touchdown for Fresno State (6-6), which led 10-6 at the half. The Bruins retook the lead on their first drive of the second half. Garbers connected with Matavao on a 35-yard strike to the Fresno State 5 and T.J. Harden ran into the end zone on the next play to give UCLA a 13-10 lead. UCLA drove inside the Fresno State 10 on its second possession of the second half, but Garbers threw incomplete on 4th-and-1. A roughing-the-passer penalty on the Bulldogs on a third-down incompletion gave the Bruins a first down at the Fresno State 29, and the Bruins finished off the drive with a 2-yard touchdown pass from Garbers to J.Michael Sturdivant, stretching the lead to 20-10 with 1:38 left in the game. Dylan Lynch booted his second field goal of the game for the Bulldogs, a 42-yarder with 31 seconds left, to trim the lead to 20-13, but the Bruins recovered the ensuing on-sides kick to secure the win. Three false start penalties helped stall UCLA's opening drive near midfield. The Bruins had 1st-and-goal at the 9-yard line on their second drive, but had to settle for a 23-yard field goal by Mateen Bhaghani, giving UCLA a 3-0 lead with 4:36 left in the opening quarter.

James finished 20-of-28 for 253 yards, helping the Eagles (7-5, 4-4 ACC) to their second straight and third win in four games. He connected with Reed Harris (three receptions, 85 yards) and Kamari Morales for scores, with the former scoring for the second week in a row. Jordan McDonald and Kye Robichaux rushed into the end zone to help the Eagles open up a 13-0 lead that they would never relinquish, reaching the seven-win mark in the regular season for the first time since 2018. Despite Nate Yarnell throwing for 296 yards and three touchdowns in place of injured starter Eli Holstein, Pitt (7-5, 3-5) suffered its fifth consecutive loss since a 7-0 start. Gavin Bartholomew caught Yarnell's first two touchdowns before Konata Mumpfield finished a 144-yard day on eight receptions with one of his own. Boston College sacked Yarnell six times. Standout defensive end Donovan Ezeiruaku had 10 total tackles (4 1/2 for loss) and 3 1/2 sacks. After Pitt closed within 20-17, James hit Jeremiah Franklin on a third-and-10 scramble to continue a key eight-play, 83-yard scoring drive that Harris finalized on a 28-yard jump-ball in the front corner of the end zone with 2:33 left in the third quarter. Pitt's fumbled snap on 4th-and-2 turned the ball back to James, whose 15-yard dot to Morales with 6:12 remaining added insurance. A Lewis Bond conversion on fourth-and-4 set the table. Mumpfield made a 15-yard touchdown reception with 3:59 left. A play after James completed his third 25-yarder of the first quarter over the middle to Franklin, Jordan McDonald broke out for a 36-yard touchdown run to give Boston College a 6-0 lead with 1:53 left. The PAT attempt was unsuccessful following a bad snap. James' 53-yard strike to Harris set up the Eagles to extend their lead to 13-0 on Robichaux's 2-yard run with 6:35 left before halftime. Pitt used a 75-yard drive to score in the ensuing eight plays. Facing third-and-11, Yarnell found a wide-open Bartholomew for an 11-yard score, cutting the Panther deficit to 13-7. Yarnell then drove the Panthers into opposing territory in four plays, but Neto Okpala's pressure and tipped pass landed in the hands of defensive tackle Ty Clemons for a 55-yard interception return with 33 seconds left before halftime. Pitt's Ben Sauls snuck in a 57-yard field goal as the first-half clock expired. After a fourth-and-2 hold inside their own territory, Bartholomew caught Yarnell's last two passes of an eight-play, 65-yard drive, including a five-yarder with 7:50 left in the third to make it 20-17. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Before that, though, the Knicks will look to continue progressing towards an even more important goal -- establishing the consistency necessary to contend for the NBA title. The Knicks will attempt to break a win-one-lose-one cycle Sunday night, when they host the New Orleans Pelicans in a nonconference matchup. Both teams were off Saturday after playing road NBA Cup contests Friday. The Knicks overcame a six-point fourth quarter deficit to edge the Charlotte Hornets 99-98 in East Group A action while the struggling Pelicans fell to the Memphis Grizzlies 120-109 in a West Group C game. With the win, the Knicks improved to 3-0 and set up a winner-take-all game for the East Group A's automatic bid to the quarterfinals with the Orlando Magic, who are also unbeaten through three games following Friday's 123-100 victory over the Brooklyn Nets. The Knicks entered Saturday one of four Eastern Conference teams with at least 10 wins this season even though they've won back-to-back games just once outside of a four-game winning streak from Nov. 15-20. For much of Friday afternoon, the Knicks appeared headed for their second two-game losing streak of the season. New York, which suffered a 129-114 loss Wednesday night to the Dallas Mavericks despite the latter being without superstar point guard Luka Doncic (right wrist), trailed the Hornets for more than 38 minutes Friday even though Charlotte star LaMelo Ball sat out with a left calf injury. Jalen Brunson helped the Knicks avoid the upset over the final five minutes, when he scored 11 of his game-high 31 points. The victory allowed New York to finish 3-2 on a road trip that began with four games against Western Conference foes before the Black Friday noon tipoff in North Carolina. ""It's a weird schedule,"" Brunson said. ""But there's no complaints and you can't change it, so we've got to go out and find a way. We came out really soft, made some runs and then they made some shots where it looked like they were just going to get away from us. We kept fighting and found a way to get a win."" The search for a win has grown increasingly frustrating for the injury-wracked Pelicans, who suffered their seventh straight loss and fell to 1-13 in their last 14 games with Friday's loss. New Orleans, which is last in the Western Conference with a 4-16 record, has played just three games this season with its optimal starting lineup of Brandon Ingram, Herbert Jones, C.J. McCollum, Daniel Theis and Zion Williamson. The quintet has combined to miss 52 games. Ingram (right calf) is day-to-day after missing the last three games while Jones (right shoulder) and Williamson (left hamstring) are out indefinitely. The Pelicans lost by 11 points or fewer for the sixth time in their last 13 defeats Friday when they missed opportunities to creep closer to the Grizzlies in the second half. New Orleans committed turnovers on consecutive trips while down 83-75 late in the third and went five straight possessions without scoring in a 101-89 game shortly before the midway point of the fourth. ""We had some chances there where we cut the lead to 10, cut it to eight,"" Hornets coach Willie Green said. ""A few miscues, a few missed shots, some 50/50 balls that we had to come up with that we didn't. Our margin for error is extremely small right now, so you've got to capitalize on those opportunities."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After Sommerville put up five straight points for Rutgers, the Aggies made three free throws in the final minute for a 40-34 halftime lead.   Rutgers' 13-0 sprint early in the second half flipped the lead to 47-42 in its favor. Harper made a 3-pointer to get things going and Williams scored three straight buckets -- a dunk in transition, an easy layup and an offensive rebound and putback.   Bailey's second 3-pointer at 12:51 put the Scarlet Knights up 63-54, but Texas A&M scored the next eight points. Then, down 65-62, Taylor made the Aggies' first 3-pointer of the game to tie it at the 8:21 mark. His team had missed its first 11 tries from long range.   Texas A&M won despite going 2 of 15 from the arc (Rutgers was 6 for 26) and being outrebounded 42-35. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Golden Gophers (5-3) are coming off a 57-51 loss against Wake Forest on Friday, which followed a 68-66 overtime loss against Wichita State on Thursday. Both games took place at the ESPN Events Invitational in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. Minnesota coach Ben Johnson cited inconsistency on offense as the main reason for his team's recent skid. ""We're painfully figuring that out,"" Johnson said. ""I thought our defense, though, (Thursday and Friday) has proven this is a top-40 or top-30 defense. We've got to be able to show up with offense and free throws."" Golden Gophers starter Lu'Cye Patterson said he and his teammates remain confident in their potential as the Big Ten conference season approaches. ""We just have to keep doing what we're supposed to do and keep our level of defensive play up,"" Patterson said. ""It's going to win us a lot of games. The offense is going to come."" Bethune-Cookman (2-5) will try to play spoiler on the road. The Wildcats have split their past two games as they beat North Dakota 79-67 on Tuesday and lost to Gardner-Webb 79-64 on Wednesday, both games played in the Cancun Challenge in Cancun, Mexico. Four players for Bethune-Cookman scored in double digits in their most recent game. Reggie Ward Jr. and Daniel Rouzan led the way with 14 points apiece, Trey Thomas scored 13 and Brayon Freeman chipped in 10. Bethune-Cookman is coached by Reggie Theus, who enjoyed a long NBA career and coached the Sacramento Kings for parts of two seasons. Theus said the Wildcats were in better position to compete this season compared with a season ago. ""We've got a lot of depth, and we have age and experience,"" Theus said. ""One of the biggest differences in our team is that we have great size now, where last year we were pretty small."" Dawson Garcia leads Minnesota with 18.6 points and 7.3 rebounds per game. Patterson is next with 10.1 points per contest. Bethune-Cookman is led by Freeman, who is averaging 15.9 points per game. Thomas (11.7 points per game) and Ward Jr. (11.0) also are scoring in double digits. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After the Wolverines' fourth straight win in the series, players converged at the block ""O"" to plant its flag. The Ohio State players were in the south end zone singing their alma mater in front of the student section. When the Buckeyes saw the Wolverines' flag, they rushed toward the 50-yard line. Social media posts showed Michigan offensive lineman Raheem Anderson carrying the flag on a long pole to midfield, where the Wolverines were met by dozens of Ohio State players and fights broke out. Buckeyes defensive end Jack Sawyer was seen ripping the flag off the pole and taking the flag as he scuffled with several people trying to recover the flag. A statement from the Ohio State Police Department read: ""Following the game, officers from multiple law enforcement agencies assisted in breaking up an on-field altercation. During the scuffle, multiple officers representing Ohio and Michigan deployed pepper spray. OSUPD is the lead agency for games and will continue to investigate."" Michigan running back Kalel Mullings on FOX said: ""For such a great game, you hate to see stuff like that after the game. It's bad for the sport, bad for college football. At the end of the day, some people got to learn how to lose, man. ""You can't be fighting and stuff just because you lost the game. We had 60 minutes and four quarters to do all that fighting. Now people want to talk and fight. That's wrong. It's bad for the game. Classless, in my opinion. People got to be better."" Once order was restored, officers cordoned the 50-yard line, using bicycles as barriers. Ohio State coach Ryan Day in his postgame press conference said he wasn't sure what happened. ""I don't know all the details of it. But I know that these guys are looking to put a flag on our field and our guys weren't going to let that happen,"" he said.  ""I'll find out exactly what happened, but this is our field and certainly we're embarrassed at the fact we lost the game, but there's some prideful guys on our team that weren't just going to let that happen.""

Normally a team that avoids committing turnovers and pressures its opponent into making them, Xavier (6-1) will try to recapture its early-season winning form when it hosts South Carolina State on Sunday in Cincinnati. Through their six wins, the Musketeers had just 58 turnovers while forcing 82 by their opponents. But against the Wolverines, they lost the turnover battle 19-10 and the game 78-53. The Musketeers committed 14 turnovers in the first half and fell behind 41-30. Xavier head coach Sean Miller credited his team for typically playing an up-tempo style while avoiding mistakes, while also acknowledging that the turnover bug really bit them against the Wolverines. ""We lost to a really good team; no shame in that,"" Miller said. ""We, on top of that, didn't play well."" ""And that (avoiding turnovers) is something you (usually) do well? That's going to be hard to overcome against a quality team like Michigan."" Leading scorer Ryan Conwell (17.6 points per game) gave the Musketeers a boost with 19 points. Zach Freemantle, second on the team at 15.4 ppg, added 14 points and 10 rebounds. Problematically, however, they also contributed to the turnover problem with three apiece. ""We didn't play well enough to win the game,"" Miller said. ""The game got out of hand. It's not like our guys quit. Their depth just continued to wear on us."" The Musketeers also get 11 points and a team-high 4.4 assists per game from Dayvion McKnight. The guard had just one turnover against Michigan, but he also made just one of his eight shot attempts. Xavier may have an opportunity get right in the turnover area against the Bulldogs (4-4), who are No. 207 in the NCAA in assist-to-turnover ratio at 1.11. South Carolina State is fresh off an 82-53 road loss to Marshall on Wednesday, in a game in which turnovers weren't a huge problem. But assists and made shots were hard to come by for the Bulldogs. Leading scorer Drayton Jones (12.0 ppg) again paced his team in points with 10 vs. Marshall, but the Bulldogs as a team managed just six assists and shot terribly at the 3-point (18.8 percent) and the free-throw (47.1 percent) lines. Jones is also the team's leading rebounder with 5.1 a game, but no Bulldogs player is averaging more than two assists. It's all part of the learning process for coach Erik Martin, whose first team went 5-26 in 2022-23. The Bulldogs improved to 14-18 last season, including 9-5 in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference. ""The only way you can grow sometimes is by failure or by struggling,"" Martin said this offseason. ""You have to fail in order to learn how to deal with failure and move on and become the person you're supposed to be."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Winnipeg will aim to shed its recent struggles and maintain its lead in the Central when it visits the division rival Dallas Stars on Sunday. The Jets enter Saturday clinging to a two-point lead over second-place Minnesota, which hosts Nashville later that night. Winnipeg has gone just 3-5-0 since starting the season historically hot. During their record-breaking 15-1-0 start, the Jets averaged 4.56 goals per game while allowing just 2.13. However, that script has flipped, with Winnipeg now scoring only 2.5 goals per game and allowing 3.25. November's grueling schedule, which wrapped up in Las Vegas on Friday with a mistake-filled 4-3 loss to the Golden Knights, has taken a toll. Heading into Dallas, the Jets have played just one home game in their last nine, but the team knows they have to battle through it. ""It's been such a grind. Just coming off the four (games) in six (days),"" Jets head coach Scott Arniel said after the defeat in Las Vegas. ""We're going into Dallas. We're going against a team in our division ... we have to make sure that we want to finish this road trip off on a good note."" On this six-game road trip, the Jets are 2-3. ""We know what Dallas is. Their building is not easy to play in,"" said Jets forward Cole Perfetti, who snapped an 11-game goal drought with two on Friday. ""They're a tough team. It's a huge division game. The bare minimum we want to go home is .500. ... We have a chance to do it, so we have to make sure that we're ready come Sunday afternoon. I think we will be. I think we know how much that game is going to mean and carry the momentum coming home."" While the Jets have struggled, Dallas has been bouncing back. After a deflating 6-2 loss to last-place Chicago on Wednesday, the Stars responded by holding off a third-period comeback attempt by Colorado to win 5-3 on Friday in Dallas. ""It's a great group for responding to adversity,"" Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. ""When we have a bad night, or a couple bad nights, you always know you're going to get their best ... I thought we had good detail in our game, did a good job bottling up the neutral zone ... we had a lot of contributions."" Defenseman Miro Heiskanen tallied two assists in Friday's win and extended his point streak to four games. ""We knew that we didn't play great in Chicago. We wanted to bounce back right away and not let too many games slip from us,"" Heiskanen said. ""It's work ethic and trying to get back to what we're good at. It's been good for a couple years and hopefully we can keep doing that."" Dallas forward Logan Stankoven will miss his second straight game due to a lower-body injury. Winnipeg might be without Nikolaj Ehlers, who is day-to-day with a lower-body injury after leaving Friday's game following an awkward fall into the boards.

The Cavaliers recovered with a pair of wins over Toronto and New Orleans, but fell in meetings with the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday and Friday.  A 20-point, 22-assist game from Trae Young on Wednesday powered Atlanta to 135 points, the most Cleveland has allowed this season.

The consecutive losses dropped Cleveland to 17-3, tied with Boston for the NBA's best mark in the loss column. The Cavaliers maintain the league's best winning percentage at .850 but are trying to avoid their first three-game losing streak since last April.

His 29 points (19 in the fourth quarter) came on the heels of a 20-point outing in the Celtics' 126-94 home blowout of the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday.  ""The key to him is he finds different ways to impact games. He's grown as a player over the course of his career,"" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said of Pritchard. ""He's a complete player.

New York's Artemi Panarin and Zibanejad scored power-play goals in the opening 40 minutes while Vincent Trocheck also scored in the waning seconds of the first period before the Rangers recovered from blowing the lead. Rangers goalie Jonathan Quick made 25 saves a week after allowing six goals in a 6-2 loss at Edmonton. Mike Matheson also scored for the Canadiens. Montembeault made 24 saves. The Rangers went ahead 9:02 into the contest when Panarin lifted a shot from above the left circle over Montreal defenseman David Savard into the upper corner of the net. Montreal tied with 8:13 left when Matheson entered the offensive zone, stepped into a shot above the right hash marks and ripped a shot over Quick's right shoulder. After surviving Montreal's attempts at going ahead, the Rangers cycled the puck around the offensive zones in the final seconds of the first and took a 2-1 lead when Trocheck tipped in Alexis Lafreniere's shot from the right point with 4 seconds left. New York expanded its lead when Zibanejad faked a one-timer, waited for Chris Kreider to get in front of the net and sent a shot from between the circles by Montembeault. Caufield put a shot from the right circle by Quick at 4:16 into the third, and Suzuki slid the puck into the open net to forge a 3-3 tie nearly 10 minutes later. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Sellers led the 15th-ranked Gamecocks (9-3) on a nine-play, 75-yard drive that he capped with a 20-yard touchdown run to put them ahead by the eventual winning margin with 1:08 left in the fourth quarter. No. 12 Clemson (9-3) had one last chance and drove toward the red zone. But Demetrius Knight Jr. made a diving interception with 12 seconds remaining to seal the Gamecocks' second win in three seasons in the Palmetto Bowl series and second in a row at Clemson. Tigers quarterback Cade Klubnik completed 24 of 36 passes for 280 yards and ran for 62 yards and two touchdowns. On the interception, he threw the ball a bit behind intended receiver Phil Mafah. The ball bounced off Mafah's outstretched hand and Knight took advantage. It was the fifth combined turnover of the game and the second for Clemson. South Carolina bolstered its case to make the College Football Playoff as a potential at-large selection in capturing its sixth consecutive victory. It's the Gamecocks' longest winning streak since 2013. South Carolina had chances to tie the game earlier, but three turnovers continued to impede its progress. One that could have proven costly came with 10:39 left in the fourth quarter after Sellers drove the Gamecocks from their 14 to the Clemson 14. But after a personal foul on South Carolina's Torricelli Simpkins moved the ball back to the 26, Sellers was picked off inside the 10-yard line by Khalil Barnes, preserving a 14-7 Clemson lead at the time. The Gamecocks cut their deficit to 14-10 with 6:48 to go on Alex Herrera's 42-yard field goal. South Carolina attempted an onside kick on the ensuing kickoff, but the Tigers recovered. The Gamecocks forced a punt on the ensuing drive, leading to Sellers' dramatic score for the victory. Sellers completed 13 of 21 passes for 164 yards and one interception, and rushed 16 times for 166 yards and two TDs, including a 25-yard run in the second quarter. Klubnik accounted for both Clemson touchdowns, first on a quarterback keeper from 13 yards to open the scoring with 12:07 left in the second quarter after an early scoreless stalemate. Klubnik then put the Tigers ahead with a run-pass-option keeper from 18 yards out with 9:57 left in the third quarter. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Two of those scoring strikes went to Dont'e Thornton (three catches, 118 yards) while Dylan Sampson added 178 rushing yards on 25 carries. Tennessee (10-2, 6-2 Southeastern Conference) held Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia to 8-of-17 passing for 104 yards and outsnapped (73-49) and outgained (538-232) the Commodores (6-6, 3-5). The Vols won't play in the SEC title game, but likely clinched a College Football Playoff berth and possibly a first-round home game. Vanderbilt got 17 first-quarter points against the Vols, who'd given up just over 13 points a game. Tennessee scored 29 unanswered points starting with the second quarter until Pavia found Richie Hoskins with a 31-yard touchdown with 5:53 to play. The Vols picked up where they left off in the first half as Iamaleava found Mike Matthews for a 14-yard TD pass with 8:43 left in the third for a 31-17 lead. Tennessee's Jackson Ross, punting for the first time all day, pinned the Commodores at their 4. Two plays later, the Vols tackled Sedrick Alexander for a safety. Max Gilbert hit a 22-yard field goal on the Vols' ensuing drive for a 19-point lead. Tennessee averaged 10.3 yards per play and didn't punt in the first half, but led just 24-17 thanks to turnovers (a 2-1 deficit), penalties (seven for 55 yards) and a Vanderbilt special teams touchdown. Vanderbilt's Junior Sherrill opened the game with a 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown, and after CJ Taylor forced a Sampson fumble that Nick Rinaldi pounced on at Tennessee's 26, Alexander scored on a 4-yard touchdown run to put the Commodores up 14-0 just 4:38 in. Iamaleava found Thornton for touchdown throws of 28 and 86 yards, and then hit Miles Kitselman with 22 seconds left in the first half, giving Tennessee its first lead. Vanderbilt's Brock Taylor hit a 32-yard field goal with 4:01 remaining in the first quarter, but the Vols scored the half's final 17 points, starting with Gilbert's 50-yard field goal, which hit the crossbar and bounced over.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The sophomore running back needed just 12 carries to orchestrate his career day and ripped off three runs of 30 or more yards, including a 64-yard touchdown scamper that put the Fighting Illini (9-3, 6-3 Big Ten) ahead 21-10 early in the second half.  After the Wildcats (4-8, 2-7) pulled within 28-20 entering the fourth quarter, Laughery broke off a 31-yard run to replenish Illinois' two-score lead. Fighting Illini receiver Pat Bryant tied a program record with his 10th touchdown reception this season, which came after Laughery's long scoring run in the third quarter.   Illinois quarterback Luke Altmyer completed 10 of 17 passes for 170 with a touchdown and two interceptions. He had an injury scare in the third quarter after taking a big hit and landing on his throwing arm. After receiving medical attention, Altmyer walked off the field and returned on the next drive. The Wildcats used two quarterbacks in the loss, their third straight to end the season. Jack Lausch played most snaps and threw for 287 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions on 25-of-48 passing. Before the game, head coach David Braun said freshman quarterback Ryan Boe would take snaps with the Wildcats out of bowl contention. Boe completed 4 of 13 throws for 42 yards with an interception.   Northwestern's defense created both Illinois interceptions with outstanding individual efforts.  In the first quarter, Brendan Flakes tipped an Altmyer pass that Devin Turner caught and ran 13 yards for a touchdown that put the Wildcats ahead 10-7. The second pick also came from Turner, who sprinted across the field and timed a dive perfectly to grab an Altmyer pass in the second quarter.   Bryce Kirtz caught two passes on Northwestern's first drive but was injured on his second reception. He exited the game with a lower-body injury and did not return.

West Virginia was limited to 125 yards of total offense in the first half while Texas Tech amassed 339. The Mountaineers had only 27 yards on the ground, mostly because Garrett Greene was sacked four times, twice by linebacker Terrell Tilmon. The Red Raiders scored on all six of their six possessions in the first half, two field goals followed by four touchdowns. Brooks' touchdown runs occurred on quick possessions of 2:11, 1:05 and 38 seconds. The last two occurred after turnovers. After CJ Baskerville intercepted a pass from Greene at the West Virginia 32, Brooks scored on a 37-yard run with 1:35 left in the half. Greene was then sacked Tilmon, who forced a fumble that was recovered by Brenden Jordan at the Mountaineers' 35.

Nolan Winter had 12 points and six rebounds and Steven Crowl had nine points, seven rebounds, five assists and three blcks for Wisconsin (8-0), which begins Big Ten play on Tuesday against visiting Michigan. Jalen Forrest scored 10 points and Gabe Spinelli had six points and 11 rebounds for the Cougars (0-9). Max Klesmit (five points, five assists) drilled a deep 3-pointer early in the second half to extend Wisconsin's lead to 37-27. On the Badgers' next possession, Tonje connected on a 3-pointer to cap an 8-0 spurt. The Badgers opened the second half on a 21-7 run and led by double digits the rest of the game.  A three-point play by Winter gave the Badgers a 42-30 lead with just under 15 minutes left. Moments later, Winter, a 7-foot sophomore center who has shot 50 percent from 3-point land this season, hit one from the top of the key and Wisconsin went up 46-30.  Wisconsin opened the game on a 7-0 run punctuated by a Winter layup. But the Cougars hung in there with a Cameron Jernigan steal and fastbreak tomahawk dunk to cut the deficit to 14-8. The Badgers opened a double-digit lead when Crowl snuck a pass to a cutting Tonje for a jam and a 21-10 advantage.  Both teams started out cold from the field. Wisconsin shot 38.7 percent from the field in the first half and just 18 percent from 3-point range (3-of-16). Chicago State also struggled from beyond the arc in the first half, connecting on just 1-of-12 treys. The only make came in transition from Greg Spate (eight points), cutting the Wisconsin lead to 30-25 and triggering a Badgers timeout with 1:36 left.

Wagner attempts to produce another big showing Sunday afternoon when the Magic visit the Nets and try to stretch their winning streak to six games. Wagner is helping the Magic outscore the Nets by 38 points in the first two meetings this season. He scored 29 points in Orlando's 116-101 home win on Oct. 25 and then matched it in Friday's 123-100 win when the Magic outscored Brooklyn 75-54 over the final 27 minutes. Wagner scored 17 points in the second half of the first meeting and on Friday had 21 by halftime before hitting four more baskets to cap a 12-for-20 showing -- the ninth time this season he made at least 50 percent from the field. ""He's our go-to guy,"" Orlando guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope said after hitting four 3-pointers and adding 19 points. ""He gets us going on the offensive end. We're playing through him. He's stepped up and it's showing. ""Every game, the ball is in his hands to make plays, to make shots. He's really doing what he's supposed to do, I would say."" Wagner is averaging a career-high 23.6 points, and his scoring average has gone up every season since Orlando picked him eighth overall in the 2021 NBA Draft out of Michigan. After averaging 15.2 as a rookie, he increased it to 18.6 in 2022-23 and then 19.7 last season to help Orlando win 47 games. The Magic are also 11-5 since losing Banchero to an oblique injury, and Wagner is averaging 25.4 points on 46.6 percent shooting in those games. Wagner also has scored 25 points or more eight times during Orlando's current 11-1 surge, including a 37-point outing against the Los Angeles Lakers on Nov. 21. Brooklyn is 3-10 against Eastern Conference opponents so far and has particularly struggled handling the ball against the Magic, who scored 59 points off 39 turnovers in the first two encounters. The Nets returned home from a 3-1 road trip that featured wins over the Sacramento Kings, Phoenix Suns and Golden State Warriors but took their second-most lopsided loss under first-year coach Jordi Fernandez against the Magic on Friday. ""We were a step slow with our physicality, a step slow with our rotations and our communication and you pay for it,"" Fernandez said. The Nets tied their season high for turnovers (20) and also took a season-low 29 3s, though they made 14. Brooklyn also got 58 points from its reserves as its starting lineup was missing Dorian Finney-Smith (ankle) and Dennis Schroder (personal) along with Cam Thomas (hamstring). ""He's very important to how we play and to our team,"" forward Jalen Wilson said of Schroder. ""Even if he's not here, we still have to step up and have his back, but Dennis is someone that we always lean on."" The absences forced the Nets to start a different starting lineup for the sixth straight game. The group of Wilson, Cameron Johnson, Ziaire Williams, Tyrese Martin and Ben Simmons combined to score 42 points. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Alyssa Naeher had to make only one stop for the top-ranked Americans before 78,346 at London's famed Wembley Stadium.  Naeher could have been making her final appearance in a U.S. uniform. The 36-year-old announced she would be retiring from international competition after this camp, which concludes with a friendly at the Netherlands on Tuesday. The U.S. outshot second-ranked England 10-4 to extend an unbeaten run to 19 consecutive matches, a stretch that includes its gold medal showing at the 2024 Olympic Games. But it was only a draw for the Americans and their England-born coach Emma Hayes after Earps was equal to both of the USA's best first-half chances. In the fifth minute, Earps lunged to her left to deny Alyssa Thompson from an excellent position inside the penalty area after a strong run down the right and cross from Emma Sears to create the chance. In the 32nd minute, it was Thompson playing the provider for Casey Krueger, who also was denied by Earp on a low diving stop. The Americans continued to pressure in the early stages of the second half, with Leah Williamson making an excellent last-moment clearance in the 53rd minute to deny Lindsey Horan's close-range effort. In the 64th minute, referee Lina Lehtovaara pointed to the spot after substitute Yazmeen Ryan's shot caught the torso and then right arm of England defender Beth Mead's right arm. But the decision correctly was reversed after a video review that showed contact with the arm had been indirect. England's best moments came in the final half-hour but rarely translated into a threat on Naeher's goal. The Lionesses only attempt on goal was not particularly dangerous, when Williamson headed Mead's cross but forced only a routine save in the 55th minute. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Cornhuskers (5-1) are a 3-point loss to Saint Mary's from being unbeaten this season, but their signature performance was an 11-point win at in-state rival Creighton, then ranked No. 14, on Nov. 22.  Nebraska most recently beat South Dakota 96-79 on Wednesday behind a career-high 29 points from Connor Essegian for their 16th consecutive home victory dating to last season. ""You see what happens when the first couple go down -- it's the domino effect that goes on to the rest of the team,"" Nebraska coach Fred Hoiberg said of Essegian, a transfer from Wisconsin. ""It's just a confidence builder. The North Florida game, we're going to see quite a bit of zone, and hopefully this confidence will carry over to Sunday.  ""You have to go into games trying to find what you can do to expose a certain defense."" North Florida (5-2) comes to Lincoln after winning 78-73 at SIU-Edwardsville on Friday night, but the Ospreys' more notable victories came the first week of the season, when they won at South Carolina and Georgia Tech. The Ospreys play with a fast-paced attack that looks to shoot quickly -- and often -- from outside. ""Quality of shot is way more important, in my opinion, than anything else,"" North Florida coach Matthew Driscoll said. North Florida makes an average of 13.4 three-pointers per game, shooting 38.2 percent from that distance, with six players averaging at least 10 points per game, including two non-starters. Nebraska only has two starters averaging in double figures in scoring, with senior guard Brice Williams at 18.7 and Essegian at 13.5. The Cornhuskers hope to be at full strength on Sunday after a pair of starters missed most of the South Dakota game. Senior wing Juwan Gary played only two minutes after getting poked in the eye, while sophomore forward Berke Buyuktuncel suffered a hip injury that limited him to 12 minutes. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Bashir, who'd previously put up 38 points in a loss to Rutgers, made 6 of 9 3-point attempts Saturday. Valencia posted 11 points, nine rebounds and four blocks and Jack Collins added 13 points. Monmouth (1-8) outperformed Seton Hall on the glass (34-28) and at the 3-point arc (10 for 21 vs. 5 for 21). Monmouth went 7-for-10 at the foul line and Seton Hall shot a paltry 8-for-16. The Hawks led by as many as 15 points down the stretch. The Pirates (4-4) lost to a mid-major opponent for the third time this season, following one-point defeats to Fordham and Hofstra. Isaiah Coleman poured in 20 points, tying a season high, and Chaunce Jenkins scored 12 for Seton Hall. Fifth-year guard Dylan Addae-Wusu sat out due to illness. Seton Hall established a 12-8 lead when Coleman converted a three-point play with 12:12 to go, but the Pirates were held without a field goal for the next 6:01, missing five shots and losing two turnovers in that stretch. Monmouth scored seven straight points to take the lead, and after Seton Hall answered with two free throws, Bashir knocked down his first of four 3-pointers in the half. The Hawks continually worked the ball around to wiggle Bashir free. Bashir scored the final 14 Monmouth points of the half, and after Hall cobbled together a 9-0 run to retake the lead, Bashir's open triple with 38 seconds to go handed the Hawks a 29-27 lead at intermission.

Fresh off their first setback, the Nittany Lions host Buffalo on Sunday in University Park, Pa., in their final tune-up before Big Ten play begins. Penn State (6-1) won its first six games, all by at least 13 points, before finally feeling the taste of defeat Tuesday in a 75-67 setback against Clemson. Ace Baldwin Jr. led the Nittany Lions with 20 points and 11 assists, but it wasn't enough to defeat the Tigers, an Elite Eight team from a season ago. ""He's just a warrior,"" Rhoades said of Baldwin to the Penn State Sports Network. ""But we needed other guys to help him in other areas. We had a lot of open 3s today that we didn't make that we've been making all year. But I think (Clemson's) physicality and their length had something to do with that."" Indeed, the Nittany Lions shot just 4 of 18 from 3-point range against Clemson and committed 17 turnovers. Yanic Konan Niederhauser complemented Baldwin with 14 points, but the other three starters combined for 20 points on 9-of-23 shooting. ""We've got to learn from it,"" Rhoades said. ""Because if we can play a team like this like we did tonight and take care of some stuff and get more contributions from others, we're going to be better and better."" Baldwin is the team's top scorer at 16.3 points per game, followed by Zach Hicks at 14.6. Niederhauser averages 12.4 points and a team-high 7.0 rebounds per game. Buffalo (4-3) has won two in a row, including a one-point victory over North Carolina A&T its last time out on Monday. Tyson Dunn hit the decisive free throws with 8 seconds left for the Bulls, who were led by Ryan Sabol's 22 points. ""Every guy that got in stepped up for us in different ways,"" said Buffalo coach George Halcovage III, whose team has already matched its win total from last season (4-27). ""In the end, we just had enough and got it done."" Sabol leads the Bulls in scoring at 18.6 points per game, with Dunn next at 13.3. Noah Batchelor is pulling down a team-best 6.8 rebounds per game.

""We've shown that, no matter who is available on a night-to-night basis, we continue to play the right way."" Charlotte has lost four games in a row and six of its last seven. The Hawks have won two in a row following a three-game skid. They turned in perhaps their best defensive effort of the season Friday. Atlanta rode a big third quarter and 23 points from reserve De'Andre Hunter to a 117-101 home victory against the Cleveland Cavaliers, who lost for only the third time this season but the second time in a row to the Hawks. ""I don't think he gets enough credit for the little things he does,"" Atlanta coach Quin Snyder said of Hunter. ""He has really embraced shooting the 3. He's a guy I feel lucky to coach."" Atlanta had three players reach the 20-point mark, including guard Trae Young. The support in addition to Young is a bonus for the Hawks. The Hornets suffered a 99-98 home loss to the New York Knicks on Friday. In addition to Ball, forward Miles Bridges was out for that contest due to a knee bruise and key reserve Tre Mann missed the game with a back ailment. Ball's injury came in the final minute Wednesday night against the Miami Heat. Ball is averaging 31.1 points and 6.9 assists per game. Brandon Miller had 20 points for the Hornets, who led by four with six minutes to play. Charlotte received a lift from KJ Simpson, who provided 11 points in a season-high 16 minutes off the bench. ""He was really engaged, brought a physicality with him, another level of competitiveness,"" Lee said. ""Offensively, I thought he did a great job of making the Knicks have to honor him. He was playing a little bit of pick-and-roll, driving and kicking to some guys."" When these teams last met on Oct. 25 in Atlanta, Ball had 34 points behind a career-high nine 3-pointers but committed 10 turnovers as well. Atlanta countered that night with Young's 38 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds. His strong night helped offset the Hornets' 42-point second quarter and secured a 125-120 win for the Hawks. A bright side for the Hornets on Friday came with their early defense. The 15 points allowed in the first quarter marked the fewest in any quarter this season against Charlotte. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Terrapins (6-1) open their conference slate at home against Ohio State on Wednesday before traveling to face No. 13 Purdue on Dec. 8. They will play three more nonconference games after that before jumping back into league action for good on Jan. 2. Maryland already has proven it can compete with top programs, battling then-No. 15 Marquette in a four-point loss and sliding past Villanova for a one-point win.  But all signs point to Sunday's game against the Braves (0-8) turning into another pick-up game for a Terrapins team that has flattened the less formidable squads on its schedule. Aside from the Villanova game, each of Maryland's five other wins have come by at least 24 points. The Terrapins won their third straight on Wednesday, with reserve Tafara Gapare scoring 19 points to power the team to a 91-67 home victory over Bucknell.  Maryland has done plenty this season to impress coach Kevin Willard, but its ability to turn defense into offense has stood out. ""One of the things we are doing a better job this year is forcing a lot of turnovers and capitalizing on those turnovers,"" Willard said. ""It allows us to continue to press on multiple possessions. Last year, we pressed one out of every five possessions. We're pressing four possessions in a row and that is going to wear opposing teams down."" Alcorn State will aim to break through against the Terrapins' pesky defense after nearly notching its first win of the season on Friday. The Braves led South Alabama by five points with less than two minutes remaining in regulation before the Jaguars rallied for a 74-65 overtime victory. Despite the winless start, Alcorn State coach Landon Bussie has seen improvement from his team since losing its first two games by 41 and 55 points, respectively. ""I was never concerned about us getting better,"" Bussie said in a postgame radio interview. ""I'm not going to take my foot off the gas on these guys."" Guard Keionte Cornelius paces the Braves with 9.9 points per game, while center Derik Queen averages a team-high 16.0 points for Maryland. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

City are the four-time consecutive champions and have come from behind to win the league on multiple occasions in that stretch. But after a six-match winless run in all competitions (0-5-1), including three straight defeats in league play, the second Cityzens (7-3-2, 23 points) visit Anfield with a risk of falling too far behind the Reds (10-1-1, 31 points). The continued absence of reigning Ballon d'Or winner Rodri with a season-ending ACL injury and other defensive ailments have left manager Pep Guardiola's side leaking goals, conceding at least twice in every match of that winless run. Even Wednesday's 3-3 home draw against Feyenoord in UEFA Champions League Play came in heartbreaking fashion, with City giving back a three-goal lead inside the final 15 minutes. While the stakes on Sunday are massive, Guardiola said the only way to play out of this kind of rough stretch is to focus on the short term. ""We have to learn and learn. You can fall down again, to succeed is how many times you stand up when again, again and again, you fall. It's the only way I know, so I know what I have to do,"" Guardiola said. ""In the situation we have, it's not realistic to think of big targets. We think one game to give the momentum to continue."" Guardiola could see key defender Ruben Dias and winger Jeremy Doku return against Liverpool. The former made the bench against Feyenoord after recovering from a calf issue and the latter had rejoined full training. Liverpool have won six straight in all competitions and are unbeaten with only one draw in their past 15 under first-year manager Arne Slot. Any concerns of 32-year-old Mo Salah wearing down with age have proved premature, with the star off to another impressive start to his league season with 10 goals and seven assists. And despite his penalty miss against Real Madrid in Wednesday's Champions League fixture, Liverpool should feel plenty confident after a 2-0 home win on goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gakpo. Even so, Slot knows to underestimate City would be at his own peril. ""They are still a very, very, very good team,"" Slot said. ""And one of the reasons why I think Pep Guardiola is the best manager in the world -- or one of the best managers in the world, but I think the best though -- is that he always comes up with solutions for his problems."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Chiefs didn't wait until the last play to get their good fortune this time, but a botched snap by the Los Angeles Raiders on Friday and a recovery by the Chiefs with 11 seconds left qualifies as another stunning dose. The Raiders were at the Kansas City 32-yard line and in position to attempt a go-ahead field goal when the Chiefs again received late-game magic. That 19-17 escape marked Kansas City's ninth victory by single digits this season—a new NFL record. Five of Kansas City's victories have been determined on the final play of the game: two made field goals, one rushing touchdown in overtime, one blocked field goal and one opponent touchdown overturned. Now they get this latest win where Raiders center Jackson Powers-Johnson unexpectedly snapped the ball. It caromed off the upper right arm of quarterback Aidan O'Connell, and the Chiefs' Nick Bolton recovered it to leave Las Vegas stunned and make Kansas City (10-1) the first team to clinch a playoff spot. Kansas City blew a 16-3 lead against the lowly Raiders (2-10), who scored two touchdowns to move ahead before the Chiefs got a go-ahead field goal from Matthew Wright. Five days earlier, the Chiefs blew a 14-point lead against the horrid Carolina Panthers before needing a field goal as time expired to win. So we're seeing that Kansas City isn't a formidable team. Star quarterback Patrick Mahomes said the Chiefs need to get better. I think we all agree with him. Not to be forgotten is that Kansas City wobbled a lot last season. After their Week 10 bye, the Chiefs lost four of their next six games to fall to 9-6, and people were wondering what was wrong. Kansas City finished 11-6 and beat the Miami Dolphins in the wild-card round when the temperature was minus-4 (feels like minus-27) at kickoff. Then it won road games against the Buffalo Bills and Baltimore Ravens before notching an overtime victory over the San Francisco 49ers. So after 'what's wrong with the Chiefs?' was the big late December question, these guys rallied to win the whole darn thing. That makes it difficult to assess the current Chiefs. They are playing a lot of close games and also playing down to the competition. But only the powerful Buffalo Bills have beaten them. As for the Raiders (2-10), they lost their eighth straight game since beating the Cleveland Browns on Sept. 29. Las Vegas has lost five games by double digits during the stretch, and the one place where Friday's loss helps is that it improves the chances of gaining the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. Quarterback Aidan O'Connell was back after breaking his right (throwing) thumb in Week 7 against the Los Angeles Rams. He fared well by throwing for two touchdowns and a career-high 340 yards. With Gardner Minshew (collarbone) done for the season, the Raiders need to study O'Connell the rest of the campaign so they can make this decision: Is he our quarterback of the future, or do we need to find one? There are certainly things to like about O'Connell. When the Raiders were down 13 points, this game could have gotten away fast. But O'Connell picked up his play and made some big-time throws. Rookie tight end Brock Bowers caught 10 passes for 140 yards and he is a definite future star. But looking at the total picture, this is a miserable season for Las Vegas. The Raiders even lost at home by 14 points to the Panthers. You have to wonder if coach Antonio Pierce will keep his job. He did a good job last season by going 5-4 after taking over, but there isn't much good to dig up this time around. Perhaps he deserves a second full season out of fairness, but you know what can happen when keeping a coach out of charity? Another double-digit loss season. On Friday, that was a game the Raiders were in position to win. Then snap—it wasn't. Copyright 2024"

Three games featuring at least one team chasing a Playoff berth offer intriguing bets for this final Saturday of a historic season. The Palmetto State rivalry returns to Death Valley for the first time since arguably the most stunning entry in modern times of this 128-year-old series. In 2022, the Gamecocks scored their first win over the Tigers since 2013 while also handing Clemson its first home loss since 2016. A key difference between the defeats that bookended Clemson’s 40 straight home wins, however, was that falling to Pitt in 2016 served as a prelude to the Tigers’ first national championship under Dabo Swinney. The loss to South Carolina two years ago, on the other hand, dashed Clemson’s Playoff hopes. The 31-30 loss also set off a stretch that wiped out Clemson’s previously held air of invincibility. Giving South Carolina a receipt in the Gamecocks’ return to Death Valley may not restore Clemson to its latter-half 2010s dominance, but it would presumably land the Tigers back in the playoffs—while denying South Carolina a possible spot in the field. The South Carolina rush defense is statistically the best Clemson will have faced. However, the Tigers' defense, with its ability to generate turnovers, promises to be an equalizer, capable of giving Clemson favorable field position. In losses, South Carolina has committed multiple turnovers, averaging three in those games. With 20 total takeaways, Clemson ranks among the best turnover-generating defenses in the nation—including generating seven over the Tigers’ ongoing, three-game winning streak. Look for a few key takeaways to play a central role in Clemson avenging its 2022 defeat and positioning itself for a Playoff berth. $100,000 Daily Race Sign up now to claim For help with a gambling problem, call or text the NCPG - (1-800-522-4700)  First Bet Safety Net $1000 or Bet $5 & Get $150 Sign up now and get the choice of two incredible offers.

The vibe shift that accompanied the change in quarterbacks saved USC’s bowl aspirations. But it may not be enough to put the Trojans into yet another one-score game with rival Notre Dame visiting Los Angeles, aiming to put an exclamation point on its Playoff resume. Since a staggering loss to Northern Illinois in Week 2, the Fighting Irish have won 8 of 9 games by 18 points or more, thanks to a combination of stifling defense and methodical offense. The one-two punch of Jeremiyah Love and Riley Leonard carrying the ball complements a defense that’s strong against the run (3.5 yards allowed per carry) and downright incredible against the pass. The Fighting Irish have 15 interceptions and have allowed just six touchdown passes this season, capitalizing on a multifaceted and steady pass rush. Maiava, who started slow in both of his previous two starts—including throwing a pick-six against Nebraska before settling in for three passing scores—cannot afford another slow start against the opportunistic Irish. While USC is just a handful of scores away from playing for the Playoff itself, Notre Dame is an especially difficult matchup for a Trojans team with an inconsistent offense. $100,000 Daily Race Sign up now to claim For help with a gambling problem, call or text the NCPG - (1-800-522-4700)  First Bet Safety Net $1000 or Bet $5 & Get $150 Sign up now and get the choice of two incredible offers.

However, for those who have followed the sport long enough, the closest thing to a guarantee anyone can make is that the final weeks of the regular season will bring an earth-shattering result. Week 14 offers a few possibilities involving teams currently in position to land a Playoff bid, including Texas facing historic rival Texas A&M for the first time since 2011. Bettors looking to go for the gusto in the final week of the regular season might consider Syracuse hosting Miami. The former Carrier Dome has been home to plenty of shocking upsets over the years, including in recent seasons. While those results have no bearing on a 2024 matchup, the atmosphere of the Dome itself plays a part in rattling visitors. More pertinent to this ACC contest, however, is that 10-1 Miami’s defense has allowed five conference opponents to score more than their season averages. While that hasn’t cost the Hurricanes often, it has made for some too-close-for-comfort wins. Syracuse should cover the number at +11 across a variety of books. If Kyle McCord settles in and his talented corps of top-three pass catchers—Trebor Pena, Jackson Meeks, and Oronde Gadsden II—find favorable matchups against the Hurricanes' defense, the Orange can dramatically alter the Playoff forecast with an outright win. $100,000 Daily Race Sign up now to claim For help with a gambling problem, call or text the NCPG - (1-800-522-4700)  First Bet Safety Net $1000 or Bet $5 & Get $150 Sign up now and get the choice of two incredible offers.

Macklin Celebrini, the No. 1 overall pick in this past summer's NHL draft, and Will Smith, the No. 4 overall selection in 2023, each had a goal and an assist as the Sharks defeated the Seattle Kraken 8-5 in a Black Friday matinee. The Pacific Division rivals will complete their home-and-home series Saturday night in Seattle. Celebrini has four goals over the past three games and Smith put together his third straight multi-point effort (two goals, four assists), as the Sharks improved to 2-2-1 over their past five contests. Celebrini became the second 18-year-old in franchise history to score in at least three consecutive games. Jeff Friesen tallied in five in a row in 1994-95. The offensive output was San Jose's largest since an 8-2 victory against Philadelphia on Oct. 9, 2018. It came two games after a 7-2 victory against visiting Los Angeles on Monday. The Sharks' Ethan Cardwell, playing in his fourth game, added his first NHL goal. Cardwell converted a wrist shot from the top of the left faceoff circle at 7:37 of the third period to give San Jose a two-goal cushion. ""I think I blacked out there for a minute,"" Cardwell said of his goal. ""It was an awesome moment, everything I dreamed of. To have a crowd go crazy like that and see all the boys' excitement to come to the bench made it all that much worth it."" Klim Kostin, moved up in the lineup, added a Gordie Howe hat trick -- a goal, assist and fight -- for San Jose. ""I didn't expect (to play with Mikael Granlund and Smith) when I go to the rink,"" Kostin said. ""When I saw the lineup, I was like, ‘Hey man, you gotta take that opportunity to prove yourself that you can play hockey.'"" Still, Sharks coach Ryan Warsofsky didn't seem completely pleased. ""It was whoever wanted to play defense would probably win the hockey game,"" Warsofsky said. ""(There are) some things we got to look at and be better for (Saturday)."" Kraken coach Dan Bylsma paused and chose his words carefully when asked a question in a postgame news scrum. ""The finishing statement will be that we gave them a lot of opportunities to demonstrate their skill,"" Bylsma said. The Kraken received two power-play goals from Shane Wright, the No. 4 pick in the 2022 NHL Draft, and Chandler Stephenson added a goal and two assists. Oliver Bjorkstrand had one goal and one assist but netminder Philipp Grubauer stopped just 19 of 26 shots to drop to 1-7-0 this season. ""Just not the type of game we want to get into,"" said Wright, who has five points (three goals, two assists) in three games since returning to the lineup after spending three contests as a healthy scratch. ""Any time you give up eight goals, it's not going to end well for you.""  Bjorkstrand said the Kraken are intent on bouncing back Saturday. ""We have something to prove,"" Bjorkstrand said.

The Pacific Division-leading Golden Knights have won both of the first two meetings with their new neighbors. Vegas won the first contest 4-3 on Nov. 2 on home ice on a Brett Howden overtime goal, then rallied from a 2-0 second-period deficit 13 days later in Salt Lake City to pull out a 4-2 victory.   Both teams will be playing the second game of a back-to-back on Saturday.   Vegas, behind two goals by Howden and Ivan Barbashev, defeated NHL points leader Winnipeg 4-3 on Friday night while Utah garnered a point against the reigning Western Conference champion Edmonton Oilers with a 4-3 overtime loss.   Howden tapped in a William Karlsson crossing pass by the left post with 4:05 remaining for the game-winner as the Golden Knights improved to 9-2-0 at home this season.  The contest came just one day after Vegas returned from a season-long five-game road trip that included stops in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Philadelphia and Wednesday in Denver against Colorado. The Golden Knights, however, didn't show any signs of jet lag in one of their best home performances of the season.   ""We've been away from home for a long time,"" Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy said.

I think we looked pretty good (Friday) and hopefully can come out the same way (Saturday)."" Vegas next will host the Oilers on Tuesday, providing a brief break.   Utah, despite blowing a 2-0 first period lead, did manage to pick up a point against the Oilers on Friday night, thanks to a Lawson Crouse goal early in the third period that tied the score 3-3. Ryan Nugent-Hopkins won it at 1:18 of overtime with a breakaway goal, beating Karel Vejmelka on his blocker side.   Edmonton scored three times in the second period, including power play goals by Leon Draisaitl and captain Connor McDavid, to take a 3-2 lead before Crouse scored his first goal since Oct. 24 in a loss to Colorado to tie it.   ""Finally,"" Crouse replied when asked for his reaction to scoring his fourth goal of the season. ""I think it just speaks volumes to our character in our room, and there's no quit in our team. We went right to the end.""   It was Utah's fifth loss in the last seven games (2-4-1).   ""Take the positives from this, move on and get ready for a big matchup tomorrow,"" Crouse said. ""We've got to move on quickly here. The goal is to come away with two points, not one.""    --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Both teams played road games on Friday night, but the Oilers are the ones who experienced a pleasant flight to Colorado after their 4-3 overtime win at Utah. The Avalanche's rally fell short in a 5-3 loss at Dallas. Colorado lost more than the game in Dallas. Defenseman Josh Manson left in the second period with an upper-body injury and did not return. Coach Jared Bednar did not have an update on Manson but expressed frustration with another of his players getting injured. ""It's definitely frustrating ... it just seems like we're having a tough time getting through a game right now healthy,"" Bednar said. If Manson misses any time, he'll join a long list of Avalanche players who have been on the injured list. A few have come back -- Artturi Lehkonen missed the first 13 games after offseason shoulder surgery, and Jonathan Drouin returned after missing 16 games but is hurt again -- while Ross Colton is out with a fractured foot. Despite that, Colorado had won eight of its previous 11 games before falling to Dallas, in part because the top players have carried the team. Mikko Rantanen has 11 goals and eight assists in November, star defenseman Cale Makar is one pace to record 100 points for the season, and Nathan MacKinnon leads the team with 36 points despite failing to score a goal in the last nine games. Edmonton also is on an upswing. The Oilers are 6-2-1 in their last nine games after opening a three-game road trip at Utah. They have climbed the standings and survived a few games without star center Connor McDavid, who is back in the lineup. ""We're in a fine position,"" Edmonton's Leon Draisaitl said. ""It's not exactly where we want to be, but we're certainly within striking distance of where we want to be. It's just a matter of stringing them together a little bit, finding a couple of win streaks that last a little longer than two games. That's our plan, that's what we're looking to do."" Draisaitl leads the team in goals (17) and points (32) while McDavid, who missed three games earlier this season with an ankle injury, paces the team with 18 assists. Saturday night will be the first of three meetings between the teams that met in the Western Conference finals in 2022. The Avalanche swept that best-of-seven series on their way to winning the Stanley Cup, and both teams remain in their championship windows. The Oilers nearly captured their sixth Stanley Cup last spring but lost Game 7 to the Florida Panthers after rallying from a 3-0 series deficit. Edmonton hopes winger Zach Hyman returns during the three-game road trip. Hyman, who hasn't played since Nov. 19 with an undisclosed injury, practiced with the team on Thursday and is on the trip. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Minnesota is coming off a 3-2 win on home ice against the Chicago Blackhawks on Friday. Captain Jared Spurgeon scored twice and Marco Rossi scored once for Minnesota, which won its second game in a row.  Now, the Wild have a chance to increase their winning streak to three games.  ""Straight lines and simple hockey, that works for us,"" Spurgeon said.  Nashville will try to complicate the Wild's three-game homestand.  The Predators also will play on short rest after losing 3-2 in overtime at home against the Tampa Bay Lightning on Friday. Captain Roman Josi scored both goals for Nashville, which earned one point but has lost two games in a row in overtime.  Nashville coach Andrew Brunette said he was looking for a spark on offense.  ""Nobody's really feeling it,"" Brunette said. ""If you look up and down our roster, we're having a hard time scoring.  ""So, nobody's really feeling great about their game. And usually when you don't feel good about your game, these kind of things happen. So, we have to try to find a way to feel a little better about our game.""  Spurgeon has helped the Wild to feel good about their performance in the first few months of the season. He underwent hip and back surgeries last season and missed six games in October as he continued to recover, but he has provided leadership and production since returning to the ice.  ""Just having him around, having his leadership presence, it's a night-and-day different feel as a group of guys,"" Wild defenseman Brock Faber said. ""Obviously, he's the leader of that. His off-ice characteristics and on-ice (contributions) are just helping us a whole lot."" Nashville could turn to Scott Wedgewood in net if it decides against playing Juuse Saros on back-to-back days. Saros made 25 saves on 28 shots Friday.  Wedgewood is 1-2-1 with a 3.69 goals-against average and an .878 save percentage in five games (four starts) this season. He needs one more victory to reach 50 wins in his career.  This would be Wedgewood's sixth career game against Minnesota. In his first five matchups, he is 1-1-2 with a 2.94 GAA and a .900 save percentage.  The Wild likely will counter with Filip Gustavsson in net. He watched from the bench on Saturday as Marc-Andre Fleury started and made 20 saves on 22 shots. Gustavsson is 10-4-3 with a 2.06 GAA and a .929 save percentage in 17 starts this season. He boasts a 62-44-17 career record with a 2.63 GAA and a .914 save percentage. In five career games against Nashville, Gustavsson is 2-2-1 with a 3.39 GAA and an .882 save percentage.  Josi said he and his Predators teammates would try to break through against the Wild. Nashville has been outscored 11-6 over its past three games. ""It's hard to win in this league when you score two goals a game, and we're working on it,"" Josi said. ""We're trying to find it. I think we've got a ton of talent in here that can put the puck in the net. ...  ""The only thing we can do is press down and keep working on it and keep trying. Keep going to the net, keep shooting the puck.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The New York Islanders are getting to the point where they're having a hard time imagining anything other than recent painful history repeating itself. The Sabres will look to remain entrenched within the middle of the Eastern Conference while the Islanders will again attempt to snap their third-period doldrums on Saturday night when the teams meet in Elmont, N.Y. Both clubs will be completing a back-to-back set after suffering overtime defeats on Friday. The host Sabres dropped a 4-3 decision to the Vancouver Canucks, while the visiting Islanders squandered another third-period lead in a 5-4 loss to the Washington Capitals.  A second straight loss was accompanied by plenty of optimism for the Sabres, who have gone 7-3-1 in their past 11 games and are one of five teams within two points of the two Eastern Conference wild-card spots. Buffalo hasn't made the playoffs since the 2010-11 season. The Sabres assured themselves a point Friday by overcoming a two-goal deficit in the third period against the Canucks, whom they outshot 34-22 overall. The Sabres previously outshot the Minnesota Wild -- who have the second-most points in the Western Conference -- by a 39-29 margin in a 1-0 loss Wednesday night.  ""We played with desperation and that's what this team has,"" said center Dylan Cozens, who scored the Sabres' first goal in the third period. ""We don't have any quit, we're going to battle until the last buzzer and we're going to keep fighting until the game's over."" Losers of eight of their past 10 games (2-4-4), the Islanders are growing increasingly desperate to find some answers for the third-period woes that are threatening to derail their season. New York, which led 4-2 entering the third period Friday, has lost seven games this season in which it held a lead in the final 20 minutes. The Islanders surrendered three unanswered goals in the third period of a 6-3 setback to the Boston Bruins Wednesday night. They were outshot 9-3 in the third period and overtime Friday.  New York didn't generate a shot during a power play that began with 3:50 left in regulation, when Nic Dowd was whistled for slashing. While the Islanders are only three points out of a wild-card spot, they are tied for last place in the Metropolitan Division with the Pittsburgh Penguins. They are ahead of only the Ottawa Senators and Montreal Canadiens -- both of whom have two games in hand -- in the East. ""Same story,"" Islanders left winger Matt Martin said. ""We continue to find ways to lose. It's not good enough. I think we just shoot ourselves in the foot a lot. We're just not taking advantage of big moments in games."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Senators should be plenty rested. They've been in the Los Angeles area for a few days after opening their three-game California swing with a 4-3 win against the San Jose Sharks on Wednesday. The Senators took Thursday off and went through a spirited practice on Friday. ""It's about getting the body moving again,"" Ottawa defenseman Thomas Chabot said. ""Days off are so big with the amount of games we play in such a short period of time. Everybody's in a good mood coming back (Friday)."" Several players have led Ottawa, but the most surprising has been Adam Gaudette, who scored two goals against the Sharks to give him 11 goals in 21 games this season. The most goals he's ever scored in a season during his NHL career is 12 in 59 games with the Vancouver Canucks in 2019-20 -- his second full season in the NHL. ""I'm just playing hockey, just doing my thing out there,"" Gaudette said. ""(I'm) playing with some great players out there, and I couldn't do it without the guys on the ice, so I owe a lot to them."" Gaudette has earned a spot on the top line with Brady Tkachuk and Tim Stutzle, who also have seen their offensive numbers climb of late. Tkachuk had two assists against San Jose to give him five points (two goals, three assists) in his past three games, and Stutzle is riding a five-game point streak (two goals, five assists). ""I just try to find him. I know he's a goal scorer,"" Stutzle said of Gaudette. ""He had a couple of good looks (against the Sharks), and he could have scored more than two."" The Kings are coming off a 2-1 win at the Anaheim Ducks on Friday. Erik Portillo made his NHL debut in goal for Los Angeles and made 28 saves to steal most of the headlines. The Kings finally won back-to-back games after alternating wins and losses for five games. ""We've kind of been treading water a little bit,"" Kings coach Jim Hiller said. ""We really want to start stretching some wins together."" Alex Laferriere had a goal and an assist against Anaheim to give him back-to-back multipoint games, and fellow forward Alex Turcotte scored against the Ducks to give him three points (one goal, two assists) in his past four games. Turcotte did not have a shot on goal in the previous two games, so he didn't hesitate to shoot the puck at the end of a 2-on-1 rush against Anaheim. Turcotte said the coaching staff has encouraged him to shoot the puck more. ""I'm trying to do all the little things out there and make plays, but I've still got to get the puck on net sometimes and be a little bit selfish,"" he said. ""I'm happy I got the opportunity (against the Ducks)."" Los Angeles defenseman Brandt Clarke comes in on a three-game point streak (one goal, two assists). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Since Montgomery replaced the fired Drew Bannister last weekend, the Blues have responded with two wins by a combined margin of 8-2. They blanked the New Jersey Devils 3-0 on Wednesday as Jordan Binnington stopped 31 shots for his 16th career shutout. Binnington's 152nd career victory for the Blues snapped a tie for the franchise record that he had held with Mike Liut. ""It's nice just to get it and to accomplish something like that,"" said Binnington, who needed only 298 games to break the franchise mark. ""It's just a matter of being here long enough to get those wins and to compound those wins over time. I'm proud to be here, and I'm proud to have that many wins."" Binnington's first NHL win was a shutout against the Flyers -- a 3-0 blanking back on Jan. 7, 2019. He famously helped the Blues win the Stanley Cup later that season as part of a sizzling start to his NHL career. Speaking of fast starts, Robert Thomas converted nine seconds into the game against New Jersey, and then Dylan Holloway added two goals later in the period to account for all of the scoring. ""We obviously started great, came with tons of energy,"" said Blues captain Brayden Schenn, a former Flyer. ""Tons of emotion early and got rewarded for it. We surprised them a little bit. They're a great team over there with tons of speed."" The Flyers can attack their opponent with speed, as well, and that is partially what has led to the team's 3-0-1 stretch over the last four games. Philadelphia slipped past the New York Rangers 3-1 on Friday afternoon as Travis Konecny scored a pair of goals and Tyson Foerster made a highlight-reel pass to Bobby Brink for another. ""I think we played the way we wanted to, followed the game plan perfectly,"" Brink said. ""And it led to success against a great team."" Ivan Fedotov made 22 saves for the Flyers, who continue to play well despite the absence of starting goaltender Samuel Ersson. Fedotov and Aleksei Kolosov essentially have split time in net while Ersson recovers from a lower-body injury. ""They've played good,"" coach John Tortorella said of his backup goalies. ""It was a tough game for Feds today -- not much action watching (the Rangers' Ilya Shesterkin) just stand on his head. (Fedotov) made some really key saves at key times. ... Those two guys have done the job and kept us in games when we've struggled and made important saves at important times."" The Flyers (11-10-3) are above .500 for the first time since they defeated the Vancouver Canucks in their season opener. They will play 11 of their next 16 games on the road. ""It's a huge stretch of games,"" forward Noah Cates said, ""but I feel like we got through a tough couple stretches in November with the schedule, and to come out of that and to get our record up to .500 is huge for us.""

Seven days later, the tide has turned for each team before Saturday night's contest in Pittsburgh.  Last Saturday, the Flames concluded an undefeated four-game homestand with a 4-3 shootout triumph against the visiting Minnesota Wild. Two days later, the Flames embarked on a four-game trip through the Eastern Conference. Three games into their voyage, they're still in search of a win, most recently falling 5-2 to the Columbus Blue Jackets on Friday. ""The first period was awful. The second period was awful. The third a push,"" defenseman Rasmus Andersson said of the game versus the Blue Jackets. ""Just not good enough. ... We have to be better on the road."" The road hasn't been kind to Calgary, which is 3-5-4 in opposing rinks compared with a 9-3-0 record at home. The Flames lost six straight on the road (0-3-3) and nine of 10 away from home, with the lone win on Nov. 5 against the Montreal Canadiens. ""It's on each guy. ... Every guy in this room needs to be better (on Saturday),"" Flames forward Blake Coleman said. ""These are games we need to start taking care of on the road if we want to be taken seriously as a playoff team here. It's early, but it's never too early to keep trying to climb up the standings. Good teams find ways to stop the bleeding."" Offense has been hard to come by for Calgary, which ranks tied for 27th in the NHL with an average of 2.54 goals per game.  The Penguins, meanwhile, have won two games in a row after recording only one win in their previous seven games (1-4-2). They beat the Vancouver Canucks, one of the NHL's top road teams, 5-4 on Wednesday, and followed that with a 2-1 victory against the Boston Bruins on Friday. Philip Tomasino, acquired via trade from the Nashville Predators on Monday, scored the go-ahead goal against Boston to give Pittsburgh consecutive wins for the first time since Oct. 31-Nov. 2. ""There's a price to pay to win, and I thought our guys worked really hard tonight,"" Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. ""... The last couple of games, we look so much more like the team that we want to be. Just being proactive, controlling momentum. I just think there's a lot to build on."" Friday's win marked the first time since Nov. 8 that the Penguins have held their opponent to two goals or less. ""Coming down to a tight game in the last period, I guess the whole game was really good for our whole group,"" said goalie Tristan Jarry. ""From top to bottom, just blocking shots, keeping pucks down low, holding onto pucks. I think we held momentum most of the game, and I think that's what really helped us down the stretch."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Charlotte was without top scorer LaMelo Ball on Friday night. Player availability will be critical again leading up to Saturday's game but other players down the roster have played well in bigger roles. ""A lot of optimism from me in terms of potentially getting guys back, but also just optimism in this group,"" Hornets coach Charles Lee said. ""We've shown that, no matter who is available on a night-to-night basis, we continue to play the right way."" Charlotte has lost four games in a row and six of its last seven. The Hawks have won two in a row following a three-game skid. They turned in perhaps their best defensive effort of the season Friday. Atlanta rode a big third quarter and 23 points from reserve De'Andre Hunter to a 117-101 home victory against the Cleveland Cavaliers, who lost for only the third time this season but the second time in a row to the Hawks. ""I don't think he gets enough credit for the little things he does,"" Atlanta coach Quin Snyder said of Hunter. ""He has really embraced shooting the 3. He's a guy I feel lucky to coach."" Atlanta had three players reach the 20-point mark, including guard Trae Young. The support in addition to Young is a bonus for the Hawks. The Hornets suffered a 99-98 home loss to the New York Knicks on Friday. Ball was out with a sore calf, forward Miles Bridges remained sidelined with a knee bruise and key reserve Tre Mann missed the game with a back ailment. Ball's injury came in the final minute Wednesday night against the Miami Heat. Ball is averaging 31.1 points and 6.9 assists per game, so his absence in back-to-back games would loom large if he's not available Saturday. ""He just felt a little something,"" Lee said. ""With the holiday (Thursday) and early tip (Friday), we haven't had a lot of time to evaluate him. They're going to continue doing that, but it's an unfortunate situation."" Brandon Miller had 20 points for the Hornets, who led by four with six minutes to play. Charlotte received a lift from KJ Simpson, who provided 11 points in a season-high 16 minutes off the bench. ""He was really engaged, brought a physicality with him, another level of competitiveness,"" Lee said. ""Offensively, I thought he did a great job of making the Knicks have to honor him. He was playing a little bit of pick-and-roll, driving and kicking to some guys."" When these teams last met on Oct. 25 in Atlanta, Ball had 34 points behind a career-high nine 3-pointers but committed 10 turnovers as well. Atlanta countered that night with Young's 38 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds. His strong night helped offset the Hornets' 42-point second quarter and secured a 125-120 win for the Hawks. A bright side for the Hornets on Friday came with their early defense. The 15 points allowed in the first quarter marked the fewest in any quarter this season against Charlotte. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Defenseman Jakob Chychrun scored at 1:20 of overtime for Washington. Tom Wilson scored two goals and Dylan Strome collected a goal and two assists for the Capitals. Connor McMichael had three assists and Logan Thompson made 20 saves. ""Just shows that we're a really good hockey team,"" McMichael said of the comeback. ""There's an old saying that good teams always find a way to win, and I think it just proves that we're a really good hockey team and we've got guys with high character that never give up on pucks, plays or games."" Washington was 2-for-4 on the power play while killing off all three opportunities by New York. The Capitals rallied after a poor second period that saw the Islanders score three times to take a 4-2 lead. ""When we have a bad period, we take a lot of pride in turning it around the next period, so (you) don't see very many back-to-back periods where we don't have it,"" Chychrun said. Strome has six points (two goals, four assists) in a three-game point streak, and Chychrun has six points (two goals, four assists) in a three-game point streak. Dougie Hamilton, Timo Meier and Jack Hughes each scored a power-play goal in New Jersey's win at Detroit. The Devils, who rallied from an early 2-0 deficit, have surrendered the first goal on the opponent's first shot in the last three games. ""Obviously we don't like the way we started here tonight; that's something we've got to get addressed, clearly,"" New Jersey coach Sheldon Keefe said. ""But loved our power play, went out and reset the game for us, and then from there, we get down again, but we fight our way back and give ourselves a lead and then build that lead so that they get one and it's not enough, and it gives us a chance to keep fighting to the end."" Captain Nico Hischier scored his 150th NHL goal -- and fourth in New Jersey's past three games. He added an assist. ""He impacts the game in so many ways,"" Keefe said. ""Those are the things you need when it isn't really your night as a team. You need individuals to step up and make a difference, and he certainly was one of those guys tonight.""

In a strong November that saw coach Craig Berube's group move near the top of the division standings, the Leafs were slowed Wednesday night by the defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers.  That game had the look of a playoff matchup and brought back memories of Toronto fans famously chanting ""We want Florida!"" in the postseason two seasons ago.  On the night before Thanksgiving, the Leafs got Florida -- got the Panthers' recent best, actually -- and it was more than the visitors could handle.   After dropping six of its past seven games, Florida jumped Toronto, built a three-goal advantage and disposed of Berube's club 5-1 in their first meeting this season.  The Panthers were the better team from the drop of the puck, and they repeatedly hemmed in the Leafs and forced numerous icings that came back for faceoffs in front of starting goalie Anthony Stolarz, a member of the Panthers last season.  Berube was most upset about losing the battle of special teams.  ""We talked before the game and knew 5-on-5 would be tight, but special teams were the difference,"" he said. ""We gave up two power-play goals to them and a shorty. That was the difference in the game. ""We were trying to come back and took six minutes of penalties in the third. That makes it difficult."" The Maple Leafs could get a big boost Saturday should center Auston Matthews return from an upper-body injury that has sidelined him since Nov. 3. Matthews informed reporters Friday that he intends to return against the Lightning. The three-time NHL goals champion has 11 points (five goals, six assists) in 13 appearances this season. The 27-year-old met with reporters Friday, saying, ""In my mind, I'm back and excited to play tomorrow."" Still, the Leafs have points in eight of their past 10 matches (7-2-1) and beat the Lightning 5-2 on Oct. 21 in Toronto.   Against the Panthers, forward Bobby McMann left the game in the second period and is listed as day to day.  In Nashville on Friday, the Lightning deposited two hard-earned points in the standings with a 3-2 overtime win over the Predators to sweep the season series.  Nikita Kucherov missed the second period with an ailment, but returned in the third period to set up Brayden Point's game-winning tally early in overtime as the Lightning improved to 5-2-1 in their past eight contests. Beneath the goal line following a faceoff, Kucherov fed Point out front for his 16th goal to beat goaltender Juuse Saros. It was the center's NHL-leading ninth power-play goal.  Tampa Bay's Brandon Hagel, who scored his 100th career goal, said the team stayed focused after the Washington Capitals rallied past them 5-4 on Wednesday night.  ""I think we kept it simple,"" Hagel said. ""I think we had a good vibe the entire game, and going into the third, we just knew what we had to do. We learned from last game, and we went out there and finished the job."" Added coach Jon Cooper of the game-winning marker: ""Pointer in tight. I don't know if there's anybody better.""  Victor Hedman stands on the threshold of franchise history. The defenseman recorded his 588th career assist on Hagel's 10th goal for a 2-1 lead in the second frame. The helper tied Hedman, in his first year as the club's captain, with Martin St. Louis for the all-time assist lead for the organization.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

They won't have star center Joel Embiid for the fourth consecutive game on Saturday night when they play the Pistons. He'll miss the team's visit to Detroit due to left-knee-injury management and personal reasons. Paul George, who hasn't played since Nov. 20 due to a left knee bone bruise, is listed as questionable after participating in Friday's practice. Caleb Martin, who missed Wednesday's overtime loss to Houston due to a back injury, also is questionable. Teammate Kelly Oubre Jr. told The Philadelphia Inquirer that he was encouraged by how George looked in practice and that George could help the team emerge from the doldrums. ""Getting those reps, being able to see him feeling good, looking good,"" Oubre said. ""Obviously, just the presence alone does a lot for the morale of the team. We have to continue to just build and try to encourage guys and help guys get back to their full rhythm and strength."" Martin isn't close to 100 percent but is hopeful of playing on Saturday. ""We've got guys banged up, and if I can go, I'm going to try to go,"" Martin said. ""I used to do the same thing in Miami. I would tell guys, even when I was really banged up, ‘I can give 10 minutes tonight.' Whatever it is. I'm going to try to give whatever I can give and help the team the best I can."" Philadelphia needs all the help it can get. The Sixers entered the season with championship aspirations with the addition of George, Martin and other free agents to complement Embiid and high-scoring guard Tyrese Maxey. They enter the weekend 3-14, having lost seven of their past eight games. After four losses, Detroit collected its first win of the season at the Sixers' expense, a 105-95 triumph in Philadelphia on Oct. 30. Pistons guards Jaden Ivey and Cade Cunningham combined for 45 points and 10 assists that night. Since then, Detroit has played .500 ball. The Pistons will play the tail end of a back-to-back set on Saturday. They played arguably their best game of the season on Friday, blowing out Indiana on the road 130-106 in an NBA Cup matchup. Detroit shot 57.8 percent from the field and had three players surpass the 20-point mark -- Malik Beasley (25), Cunningham (24) and Ivey (23). Cunningham, who had missed the previous three games with a hip injury, had 11 of the Pistons' 35 assists. ""That was our emphasis on the scouting report and what coach was really preaching to us -- moving the ball,"" Cunningham said in a postgame TV interview. Beasley is one several veterans the Pistons' front office brought in to provide stability. Cunningham, Ivey, Jalen Duren and Ausar Thompson have benefited from their presence. ""It's a lot of new guys with this group,"" Cunningham said. ""The young core, we've been together, but to have time together and be able to play together, feel each other out, that's the name of the game."" The Pistons, coming off the worst season in franchise history (14-68), are 9-12 this season. They most recently finished at .500 or better in 2018-19. ""We're a group of guys who are willing to sacrifice for something more than themselves,"" first-year Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""When you put a group of guys like that together, it's a great start. We'll continue to get better with the schemes and the technical pieces of it, but when you have guys playing out there that way, you give yourself a chance to win, and that's why we're in so many games, because our guys are playing selfless, competitive basketball."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Panthers defeated the Hurricanes 6-3 on Friday in Raleigh, N.C., ending Carolina's nine-game home winning streak in the first half of a home-and-home set. Sergei Bobrovsky got the start in goal for the Panthers on Friday afternoon and stopped 29 of the 31 shots he faced en route to improving his season record to 11-5-1. With Bobrovsky playing on Friday, it is likely that Spencer Knight will get the start in net on Saturday. Knight has a 2.63 goals-against average this season, but he lost each of his past three starts. Bobrovsky owns a 3.04 GAA. Panthers defenseman Aaron Ekblad, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2014 draft, played in his 700th NHL game during the Friday win and provided two assists. ""What our hope and expectation is that Aaron is going to become that complete all-around two-way defenseman that when we get up the ice, you can score points, you can run a power play, but he'll play against the other team's best,"" Florida coach Paul Maurice said. Ekblad played a team-high 27:17 as the Panthers won their second consecutive contest after dropping four straight. Not only did the Hurricanes lose their home win streak, but top scorer Martin Necas also saw his nine-game home point streak end. Necas, who tallied six goals and 14 assists during the run, was held off the scoresheet despite playing a team-high 22:18. The Hurricanes came back from a 3-1 deficit to tie the game late in the second period, but they couldn't finish the job as the Panthers went on to score three unanswered goals in the third period. ""We have to let go of this one pretty quick and focus on the same team,"" Hurricanes captain Jordan Staal said about meeting up with the Panthers again on Saturday. ""It's a battle always against that team, they're a good team. They play hard, they play smart and they don't give you anything. So we're going to have to work for our chances and we're going to have to come up with a big road win down in Florida."" The Hurricanes have lost two consecutive road outings (0-1-1) and have had trouble with the Panthers in recent history, only coming out on top in four of the past 14 meetings (4-5-5)between the regular season and the postseason. Florida swept Carolina in four games during the 2023 Eastern Conference finals. Spencer Martin has started between the pipes for Carolina in four of its past five contests due to injuries to Pyotr Kochetkov (concussion protocol) and Frederik Andersen (knee). Martin allowed a combined 16 goals over those four starts. Kochetkov is considered a possibility for the Saturday contest, but if he is still unavailable, the Hurricanes could turn to Yaniv Perets. A part of Quinnipiac's NCAA championship team in 2023, Perets could be in line for his first career NHL start. He played 12:46 in a relief appearance last season in his lone NHL game. Both teams have been playing in high-scoring affairs of late. The Hurricanes have scored or allowed four or more goals in 18 consecutive games, while the Panthers have seen 11 of their past 15 contests feature a total of six or more goals. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Still trying to find a spark, the Rangers attempt to halt their first five-game losing streak in more than three years Saturday afternoon when they host the Montreal Canadiens. The Rangers will play their next five at home as they return from playing six of their previous seven on the road. Since a 4-3 win over the Vancouver Canucks on Nov. 19, New York has been outscored 21-10 in its first five-game losing streak when getting outscored 21-5 from April 29-May 6, 2021. The Rangers fired then-general manager Jeff Gorton and team president John Davidson three games into that skid. New York's latest loss was a 3-1 setback to the Philadelphia Flyers on Friday afternoon. The Rangers trailed by two goals 4:24 into the game and were outshot 15-4 in the opening period. After the disastrous start, Laviolette switched each of the four forward lines and two of the three defensive pairings. ""We left the game in the first period,"" Laviolette said. ""That can't happen. For a team that's sitting here looking for ways to win hockey games, just the work in the first period wasn't good."" The changes resulted in Artemi Panarin going on a line with Mika Zibanejad and Will Cuylle, rookie Brett Berard doing the same with Alexis Lafreniere and Vincent Trocheck. On defense, Laviolette moved captain Jacob Trouba to the third pairing with Zac Jones and placed Braden Schneider with K'Andre Miller. Trocheck scored the team's lone goal midway through the second period, but the Rangers were outshot 35-23. They have been outshot 198-137 during their skid. ""It's not good enough,"" Trouba said. ""I think everybody knows that. Nobody needs to announce that or scream or kick and yell. As a group, as professionals, I think you know when it's not good enough. That certainly wasn't good enough as a start."" Chris Kreider missed his third straight game due to back spasms and he could be out again as New York attempts to avoid losing six straight for the first time since going 0-2-4 from Feb. 24-March 7, 2019. New York last dropped six straight in regulation during a single season when it did not get a point in the first six of a seven-game (0-6-1) slide from Feb. 13-25, 2018. The Rangers scored a 7-2 victory at Montreal on Oct. 22 but are 7-9-0 since that encounter. The Canadiens have allowed 19 goals in three straight losses to the Rangers dating back to last season, but they are showing some improvement of late. Montreal is 4-2-1 in its past seven games since allowing 29 goals in a six-game skid from Oct. 29-Nov. 9. The Canadiens, who have scored 23 goals in their past seven, avoided a third straight loss when Nick Suzuki scored 44 seconds into overtime for a 4-3 road win against the Columbus Blue Jackets on Wednesday. Montreal is on the rise despite averaging just 21.4 shots on goal over its past seven contest. The Canadiens put 23 shots on goal Wednesday. Juraj Slafkovsky, recently being demoted to the fourth line, scored in the victory. ""You're just driving for consistency,"" Montreal forward Brendan Gallagher said. ""We drop the puck next game, we got to try and continue to put these points together and climb back up. Enjoy it for a little bit, but you move on pretty quick."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

It is not unusual for a struggling NFL team to play well for a day and keep it close against a better,"This time of year can be difficult for bettors. It is not unusual for a struggling NFL team to play well for a day and keep it close against a better team. But if taking such a bet does not sound like a good idea, give one (or more) of the hundreds of player props a try. With three games on Thanksgiving and another on Black Friday, there are fewer games than usual. However, there are still hundreds of NFL player props available. To help you decide which to bet on, here is our top 10 list of player props for Sunday's Week 13 slate. NFL Week 13: Player Props Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Cincinnati Bengals Pat Freiermuth, four-plus receptions at +194 (FanDuel) Freiermuth had four last week in the loss to the Browns and at least that many in each of the first four games of the season. But against a passing team like the Bengals, the Steelers will likely need every weapon in their arsenal to keep up with the Cincinnati passing game. The Bengals' defense has taken it relatively easy on tight ends this year. So, whether the Steelers are trying to catch up or control the ball, there is a good chance Freiermuth plays a bigger part than usual and makes four-plus receptions. Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. Carolina Panthers Bryce Young, O/U 195.5 at -114/-114 (FanDuel) Those of us who have not paid much attention to the Carolina Panthers this season might be surprised to hear that Bryce Young has been playing pretty well since returning to the starting lineup. He's thrown for 200-plus yards in two of his past four games and is completing 60-plus percent of his passes. Tampa Bay has a solid run defense. Since the Bucs will probably throw early and often, the Panthers will need Young to throw the ball to catch up and/or be competitive. With how well Young is playing right now, we'll take the OVER. Indianapolis Colts vs. New England Patriots Drake Maye, O/U 220.5 passing yards at -115/-115 (DraftKings)   Maye threw for more than 220 passing yards against the Rams and Dolphins, two solid defenses, in his past two games. The Colts' defense ranks No. 27 in pass defense and has seen opponents average 34 pass attempts and 231.7 yards per game over the past three. Maye has averaged right around 34 attempts and 230 yards over his past three. Take the OVER. Los Angeles Rams vs. New Orleans Saints Kyren Williams, O/U 19.5 rushing attempts at -102/-128 (FanDuel) O/U 82.5 rushing yards at -113/-113 (FanDuel) O/U 11.5 receiving yards (DraftKings) Williams had 16, 15, and 15 carries the past three weeks but had 20-plus in the previous four and has averaged 18.8 per game this season. But he'll be facing a New Orleans Saints team that has seen opponents run the ball 26.7 times per game and 27.8 at home. The Rams tend to run a little less on the road, but they are fighting to remain in the playoff conversation (just like the Saints). To that end, they'll put the ball in the hands of their playmaker rather than spread the touches among multiple backs. New Orleans has been giving up 134.2 yards per game on the ground but has been especially weak against the run at home (163.2 yards per game). Wiliams has gone for over 82.5 yards in three of the five games in which he had 20-plus carries. But against a Saints team giving up 160-plus at home, take the OVER. Williams has not been targeted in the passing game the past two weeks (three total). In the eight games where he had at least one catch, he finished with under 11.5 yards in three. He is not a priority in the passing game. Take the UNDER. Houston Texans vs. Jacksonville Jaguars C.J. Stroud, O/U 259.5 passing yards at -115/-115 (BetMGM) Tank Dell, O/U 51.5 receiving yards at -113/-113 (FanDuel) O/U 4.5 receptions at +130/-170 (FanDuel) Nico Collins, O/U longest reception 26.5 yards at -130/+100 (BetMGM) This should be the ‘get-right' game C.J. Stroud and the Texans have needed for weeks.  Jacksonville has overtaken the Ravens as the worst pass defense in the NFL. Stroud has gone over 259.5 passing yards just once in Houston's past seven games. But opponents are averaging 278.3 yards per game this season and close to 300 over the past three games.  If Stroud can't go off against this team with the talent at his disposal ... Tank Dell has gone over 51.5 yards in both games with Nico Collins back in the lineup. But against a Jacksonville defense that has allowed an average of 13.5 receptions for 183.5 yards, Dell should see a few more targets. Collins will be the primary receiver, of course, but Dell could still see balls thrown his way and that should be enough for him to go OVER both marks. As for Collins, he has had a reception of 28-plus yards in every game but one. Jacksonville has given up 52 pass plays of 20-plus yards and nine of 40-plus. Take the OVER. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

They shot 44.9 percent from the field, making 14 of 33 3-pointers, and completely stifled the previously unbeaten Shockers (6-1) on defense.   Wichita State entered averaging 80.8 points per game but Florida's length and quickness shut down the Shockers, who converted just 29.8 percent from the field and went 5-of-22 on 3-pointers.

Snowden applied the clinching blow, intercepting a telegraphed pass over the middle by backup quarterback EJ Colson and returning it 13 yards for six points with 3:34 remaining in the game. Luke Bottari, Utah's fourth starting quarterback of the season, completed 13 of 20 passes for 111 yards and a 15-yard touchdown to Landen King 14 seconds into the fourth quarter that made it 21-7.

His interception was on the third play of the game and his first score was an 11-yard catch to give the Buffaloes (9-3, 7-2 Big 12) a 21-0 first-quarter lead. Shedeur Sanders connected on 34-of-41 passes for 438 yards, five touchdowns and an interception, setting Colorado's single-season passing yards record.

Micah Welch had a rushing touchdown for Colorado, which kept its slim Big 12 Championship Game hopes alive.

They could also get to the championship game if BYU and West Virginia both lose. Maealiuaki Smith was 11-of-29 for 70 yards and two interceptions for the Cowboys (3-9, 0-9). Colorado outgained Oklahoma State 471-147. In the first quarter, the Cowboys' offense managed 16 yards, threw a pick to Hunter on its first drive, went three-and-out on its second, had a fumble recovered by Shilo Sanders on its third and punted on its fourth.

Pritchard made 7 of 11 3-point attempts, and he tossed in 19 of his points in the fourth quarter. Boston received 21 points from both Kristaps Porzingis and Jaylen Brown. Chicago was eliminated from the NBA Cup with the loss with a 2-2 record. The Bulls would have advanced as the East Group C champion with a victory. Any chance Boston had of winning the group disappeared when Atlanta beat Cleveland 117-101 on Friday, since the Hawks beat the Celtics 117-116 in an NBA Cup game on Nov. 12.

With his third 3-pointer, he passed Kirk Hinrich for most made treys in franchise history, and he ended the game with 1,051 3-pointers in his Bulls career.

The Celtics extended its lead to 33-20 on a Tatum 3-pointer and led 39-30 after 12 minutes. Boston made 9 of 16 3-point attempts in the opening quarter. The Bulls used a 16-3 spurt to tie the game 42-42, and an 11-0 run later in the second quarter gave Chicago a 55-46 advantage.

After sitting out three consecutive games with a strained left hip, Cunningham contributed a game-high 11 assists to record his sixth consecutive double-double. He hit 10 of his 19 shots and four of his six 3-point attempts. Beasley was even better from the field off the bench, going 10-for-14 overall while connecting five times from deep. The Pistons outscored the Pacers 54-36 from beyond the arc. Jalen Duran also recorded a double-double for the visitors with a game-high 12 rebounds to complement 14 points and four blocks, while Tim Hardaway Jr. made it all five Pistons starters in double figures with 10 points.

Edwards turned a 90-87 deficit into a 93-90 lead by throwing down a dunk, knocking down his triple and sinking a free throw.   Ivica Zubac converted a putback with 50.9 seconds left to get Los Angeles within one, but a sloppy defensive sequence in the final seconds prevented the Clippers from stealing a victory.   Minnesota guard Mike Conley came up with a steal with 26.1 seconds to play, then helped the Timberwolves move the ball around to run out the clock. Conley eventually got the ball back late in the shot clock, forcing the veteran to shoot a quick 3-pointer.   Conley was off the mark, but Edwards was there for the rebound. He also missed a shot, but teammate Rudy Gobert got another offensive rebound and ran out the clock.

Then again, maybe not. It depends, Houston coach DeMeco Ryans said, if the Texans (7-5) are ""locked in"" and able to make a December push. ""I just look at it as being intensely focused on your job and being where you're supposed to be, executing the minor details of your job,"" Ryans said. ""It all comes down to minor, minute details that you get exploited if you don't do them the correct way and teams find those and they make you pay.  ""And a lot of the things, as I talked to our guys about, are things that we can control."" Jacksonville (2-9), sitting at the bottom of the AFC South, is coming off a humiliating 52-6 loss to the Detroit Lions. It marked the fourth straight setback for the Jaguars, who had dropped their previous three games by a combined 13 points. Jaguars coach Doug Pederson noted that changes are coming, although he opted not to show his cards.  ""I'm not going to get into the whole details of things, but there are things in the run game that we have to get back to,"" Pederson said. ""Even in the passing game, tweaking some things there. There are things that can, hopefully, help our production over the last six weeks."" One of those changes is the return of starting quarterback Trevor Lawrence, who has not played since Nov. 3 due to a left shoulder injury. Doug Pederson confirmed Friday that Lawrence will be the QB1 despite being listed as questionable after being limited in practice all week.  Pederson has also had his eye on Houston quarterback C.J. Stroud, who has run into some struggles during his sophomore season.  Stroud has thrown nine interceptions in 12 games (all starts) after throwing only five as a rookie. He was picked off twice in the 32-27 setback against Tennessee, also throwing for 247 yards and two touchdowns on 20-for-33 passing.  Pederson still believes the 23-year-old can hurt the Jaguars, though.  ""Playing the quarterback position is hard,"" Pederson said. ""I don't know everything that goes on down there. I'm sure there's been injury, guys have missed (time). He's missed his playmakers from time to time. And then there's the film. There's the film out there."" The Texans have lost three of their past four games and four of their past six as defenses continue to solve Stroud. For the Texans, safety Jalen Pitre is expected to miss several weeks because of a shoulder injury. Defensive tackle Foley Fatukasi (foot) will sit out Sunday's game after not practicing all week, but defensive ends Will Anderson Jr. (ankle) and Denico Autry (knee) were among those who returned to full practice Friday and will play on Sunday. Jaguars linebacker Yasir Abdullah (hamstring) did not practice all week and won't play Sunday. Cornerback Tyson Campbell (shoulder) was limited in practice all week but doesn't have an injury designation. Sunday marks the second meeting of the season between the teams.

After missing the past five games due to an injured wrist, Doncic returned to practice with his teammates on Friday. It's uncertain whether he'll play against Utah or Sunday in Portland during the Mavericks' weekend road trip, but he will be with the team. ""He's doing his individual workouts. Everything I've heard or seen is trending in the right direction,"" Dallas coach Jason Kidd said on Wednesday. Unlike last season, when the Mavericks only won four of 12 games in Doncic's absence, Dallas has fared well without their top gun since he was injured on Nov. 19 against New Orleans. The Mavs are 4-1 in that stretch, including a 129-119 win at Atlanta on Monday and Wednesday's 129-114 victory over the New York Knicks. Remarkably, Dallas had four players score at least 20 points in each of those most recent wins, setting a team record. Against the Knicks, Naji Marshall scored 24, Kyrie Irving had 23 and Quentin Grimes and Spencer Dinwiddie scored 21 each. Marshall has been particularly effective in Doncic's absence. He's averaged 23 points on 63.3 percent shooting while hitting half of his 3-point attempts in the past four games. Dallas' depth has been critical to their 11-8 record. They've had at least six players reach double figures in each of their last six games. In the Mavericks' 123-120 win over Denver on Nov. 22, seven players scored in double figures. The Jazz haven't had similar success on the scoreboard but their players are getting experience and playing time for a variety of reasons, including injuries. In Wednesday's 122-103 home loss to the Nuggets, Utah was without Lauri Markkanen (personal reasons), John Collins (left knee contusion), Jordan Clarkson (left plantar fasciitis) and Kyle Filipowski (lower leg inflammation). ""We will play some lineups tonight that none of us in this room have seen,"" Jazz coach Will Hardy said before that game vs. Denver. ""We will play some lineups tonight that maybe none of us in this room had even thought about. But in some ways, these nights are fun because we get to lean into our creativity as a staff and as a team."" Collin Sexton led Utah with 26 points, Keyonte George had 23 points, Walker Kessler totaled 16 points and 12 rebounds, and Brice Sensabaugh tallied 13 points off the bench. Nikola Jokic scored 21 of his 30 points in the opening half, helping the Nuggets turn a 12-point deficit into a 10-point lead en route to the blowout win. ""We still have these little windows of the game that turn into kind of like a little disaster,"" Hardy said. ""That four-to-five-minute window is really where the game was decided."" The Jazz were grateful to give Congolese player Oscar Tshiebwe, the 2022 consensus national player of the year from Kentucky, his first playing experience with the team in the loss, too. He had three points and nine rebounds. ""I love everything about Oscar. He just makes you feel good,"" Hardy said. ""He's such a good human being.

Flagg, considered the top prospect for next year's NBA draft, also churned out nine rebounds and seven assists. Caleb Foster scored the first four points of the second half as part of Duke's 13-0 spurt coming out of intermission. After that burst for the Blue Devils, they were outscored 23-20 the rest of the way. Paris Dawson notched 10 points off the bench for Seattle (2-5), which shot 21.3 from the field for the game. Matthew-Alexander Moncrieffe had nine points and 12 rebounds. Exactly half of the Redhawks' points came on free throws, so Duke will want to assess some of its defensive work before a showdown against undefeated Auburn on Wednesday night in Durham. Four of the Blue Devils' victories this season have come in home games. Long-range shooting made a big difference in Duke's favor. The Blue Devils made 10 shots from 3-point range, while Seattle connected just four times. Seattle's starters combined to go 0-for-11 from beyond the arc. Duke was just 39.7 percent from the field for the game, which was the first outing on its home court in nearly two weeks. Nine players scored for the Blue Devils. Duke was sluggish for much of the first half, but finally got rolling in the final 10 minutes. The Blue Devils led 37-25 at the break, with Flagg's nine points leading the scoring. Evans' 3-pointer and Flagg's dunk on consecutive possessions provided a spark. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Lamont Butler added 17 points and six assists for Kentucky (7-0), which eclipsed the 100-point total for the fourth time this year. Amari Williams had 14 points, Otega Oweh added 12, while Andrew Carr and Koby Brea scored 10 apiece for the Wildcats, who made 40 of 67 (59.7 percent) shots from the field. Cesare Edwards led Georgia State (4-4) with 21 points, followed by Zarique Nutter's 19. Malachi Brown chipped in 11 points and five assists for the Panthers, who have dropped two of three. Early in the first half, Nutter's mid-range jumper cut Kentucky's lead to 11-10, before Robinson's layup began a 9-0 Wildcat scoring run. Five straight Georgia State points trimmed its deficit to two points with 5:06 left in the first half. The Panthers were then held scoreless for three minutes, while Kentucky extended its advantage with a 13-0 run, stamped with Kerr Kriisa's 3-pointer, giving the Wildcats a 44-29 lead.

The second-seeded Galaxy romped to a 6-2 win over Minnesota United in a West semifinal last Sunday, with Gabriel Pec, Joseph Paintsil and Dejan Joveljic all scoring twice. That followed a Round 1 series sweep over Colorado in which Los Angeles outscored the Rapids 9-1 over two victories. The Galaxy are also unbeaten in 19 fixtures at their home stadium in all competitions. Despite all that, head coach Greg Vanney is keenly aware how much stiffer the challenge may be against a Seattle side that has won two MLS Cups and reached four finals since 2016. Vanney was the opposing manager in three of those finals, guiding Toronto FC to a 2017 MLS Cup triumph at the Sounders' expense but succumbing to Seattle in the 2016 and 2019 finals. ""I think whenever you talk about Seattle and playoffs and this time of year, you have to talk about the culture that they have at the club,"" Vanney said. ""The grittiness. The resilience. The maturity. They've played in a lot of big games and won a lot of big games."" That has been proven again this postseason, with fourth-seeded Seattle reaching this stage despite failing to win a game in regulation. The Sounders earned a 2-1 victory over Los Angeles FC in a West semifinal in extra time on Jordan Morris' 109th-minute tally, and they swept the Houston Dynamo in a Round 1 series that required a penalty kick shootout in both games. ""These are the games that show us what we got, show us what we're made of,"" Seattle midfielder Obed Vargas said. ""We don't take any team lightly. LA Galaxy and LAFC were top of the West for a reason, but we have full confidence that we have the weapons to exploit them."" However, head coach Brian Schmetzer will be without at least one of those weapons. Influential attacking midfielder Paul Rothrock is done for the season with a major quadriceps injury. And Yeimar Gomez, the team's defender of the year, is questionable after sustaining a hamstring injury in the win against LAFC. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Barnhizer sank four 3-point shots and contributed team highs of nine rebounds and six assists. Barnhizer has scored 20 or more points in three of his four games this season. Jalen Leach chipped in 15 points and Nick Martinelli had 12 for the Wildcats (6-2), who shot only 40.8 percent from the floor. Dedan Thomas Jr.'s 17 points and Jailen Bedford's 15 were tops for UNLV (4-3), which made only 6-of-18 shots from 3-point range. The Rebels also were dinged by 14 turnovers and went cold on offense at the wrong time. UNLV stayed within range despite scoring only six points in a six-minute stretch late in the game. They added seven points in the last 30 seconds after Northwestern had the game in control. Northwestern looked to be in good shape after Martinelli's 3-pointer with less than two minutes left for a 58-51 lead. But Bedford countered with a 3 for UNLV. Barnhizer answered with a three-point play with 1:12 remaining for a 61-54 Wildcats lead. UNLV missed its next two shots, including a dunk, before Northwestern's Ty Berry hit a free throw with 38 seconds to play for his only point. The Rebels were hurt by 42.1 percent shooting from the field despite eight more attempts than Northwestern. UNLV had a chance to come back late unlike a day earlier against No. 25 Mississippi State. Northwestern posted an 18-6 advantage in points at the free-throw line. The teams combined for 25 offensive rebounds, with UNLV collecting 13. Northwestern, coming off a two-point loss to Butler on Thanksgiving, led 26-25 at halftime by wiping out a seven-point edge for the Rebels. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

A 23-year-old former first-round pick who was acquired from the Nashville Predators in a deal on Monday, Tomasino netted the go-ahead goal with 12:34 left in regulation. He gathered Evgeni Malkin's pass out of the corner and wristed home a shot that beat Boston netminder Jeremy Swayman five-hole from the bottom of the left circle. Pittsburgh's Tristan Jarry, who entered the game with an .868 save percentage on the season, stopped 32 of Boston's 33 shots (.970). Thirteen of his saves came in the third period. Rickard Rakell scored the first goal for the Penguins en route to their second straight win. Charlie Coyle scored and Swayman made 33 saves for Boston, which is now 3-2-0 under interim head coach Joe Sacco. Minutes after Tomasino's winning goal, Kris Letang's sliding block helped Jarry regain his positioning to make a key stop on Coyle's attempt to stuff the puck inside the left post. A Jarry stop against David Pastrnak during a Boston power play with 6:36 remaining and another with Swayman pulled in the final minute helped secure the final result. Coyle needed only 1:24 of first-period time to net the game's opening goal. Tyler Johnson picked up the puck off Pittsburgh defenseman Jack St. Ivany's fanned pass, led the rush up ice and fed Trent Frederic, who dished cross-ice to set up the Coyle finish on a wrist shot from the right circle. Despite being outshot 12-9, Boston maintained its 1-0 lead entering the first intermission in large part due to Swayman making key saves less than a minute after Coyle scored. A stop on Sidney Crosby's two-on-one rush with Bryan Rust began the flurry. Facing an even busier workload in the middle frame, Swyaman made a flashing glove save on Anthony Beauvillier near the midway point, but Rakell found the tying goal with only 0.8 seconds left before intermission. After Crosby won a point shot back to Erik Karlsson for a point shot that sailed just wide, the Pittsburgh captain recovered the puck as he circled the net and slid a backhand pass to Rakell in front, where he scored Pittsburgh's first goal into a near-open net. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The game could feature a somewhat rare head-to-head between Olympic teammates Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry, both of whom have been sidelined with recent injuries. After helping the Suns open the season 8-1, Durant missed seven straight games with a strained calf. Phoenix went just 1-6 in those contests. The Suns rebounded with a 127-100 home blowout of the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday in Durant's return, in which he contributed 23 points. He then went for 30 the next night against the Nets, but they weren't enough to prevent a 127-117 defeat. Durant pointed to another stat he deemed more important after the loss. ""That's the game,"" he demanded after scanning the stat sheet. ""I can't have seven turnovers if we want to win."" Turnovers have been a bigger issue for the Warriors than the Suns. Golden State has had more than its opponent in three straight games, and has lost all three. Curry wasn't the culprit in a 105-101 home defeat at the hands of the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday as he sat out with sore knees. But he's had at least three in 10 straight games, including three apiece in losses to the San Antonio Spurs and Nets to start the losing streak that has followed a 12-3 start. Interestingly, Curry's absence gave Pat Spencer an opportunity he's rarely gotten in two years with Golden State. The former lacrosse standout, who switched over to basketball after transferring to Northwestern as a fifth-year collegian just five years ago, had Warriors coach Steve Kerr raving after a six-point, four-rebound, three-assist effort against the Thunder. ""Fantastic,"" Kerr said. ""You love to see a guy just come in and play with great force and energy, and push the ball, and find shooters ... He just plays the game. I thought Pat changed the game; as soon as he got out there, the game finally opened up for us. We started to move the ball."" Curry is expected back for the game at Phoenix, which will be the first meeting this season between the Pacific Division clubs. Curry and Durant were three-year teammates for the Warriors, a run that resulted in championships in 2017 and 2018, and a near-miss in 2019 when Durant and Klay Thompson were injured during the Finals against the Toronto Raptors. The Warriors have met Durant's teams 19 times since he left for the Nets after the 2019 Finals. Curry and Durant have been healthy enough to go head-to-head in just six of those games, with Durant's team prevailing four times -- twice with the Nets and twice with the Suns. Curry has outscored his old pal 157-135 in the six games. The Warriors and Suns have not met in the postseason over those years. In fact, the last time Golden State drew Phoenix in the playoffs was in 1994, when Curry was 6 years old and Durant 5. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Tigers (7-1) picked up their fourth consecutive victory as they broke open a close game nearly five minutes into the second half. The Rattlers (1-5) lost for the fifth time this season to a Power Four conference opponent by 24 or more points. Milton Matthews led Florida A&M with 14 points and Roderick Coffee III had 13 points, six assists and five rebounds. Jordan Chatman had 11 points and Shaqir O'Neal had 10. For a half, it appeared the Rattlers would finally be able to contend against one of those power conference opponents. Clemson led 38-32 at halftime and shot a poor 2 for 13 from 3-point range in the first half. But the Tigers opened the second half making three of their first seven triples. Eventually, Clemson put together a 20-5 run over a span of nine minutes to open a 67-41 lead with 6:16 left in the second half. Hunter was one of four Tigers to score in double figures as Clemson shot 50 percent from the field despite its struggles from long distance. The Tigers compensated for their poor 3-point shooting with excellent shooting from the foul line (17 for 20), set up by attacking the rim and taking advantage of 16 Florida A&M turnovers. Hunter led the Tigers with three steals while Viktor Lakhin, Schieffelin and Jaeden Zackery each had two. Chauncey Wiggins totaled 15 points for the Tigers while Zackery had 13 points, four assists and three rebounds. Lakhin had 12 points, five rebounds and three assists.

After losing eight of their first 10 games, the Bucks have turned things around and bring a five-game winning streak into Saturday's contest. While Milwaukee was able to find solutions for its early-season doldrums, Washington is mired in a 13-game losing streak. The Wizards are three losses away from matching their franchise-record losing streak of 16. Washington had no answers for Los Angeles star James Harden in a 121-96 loss to the Clippers on Wednesday. Harden scored 43 points in his team's victory, including 23 in the first quarter. ""It's still really, really early, but to run into this much adversity early stinks and stings,"" Washington forward Corey Kispert said. ""And it's testing the culture that we put in. There's still a lot of positivity within the room, and there's still a lot of encouragement. While things are tough, they're not toxic and not unbearable."" Wizards guard Jordan Poole returned after missing two games with a hip injury and scored eight points on 1-of-7 shooting. The Wizards shot 24.2 percent (8 of 33) from 3-point range in the loss. ""In moments like this, you can get discouraged, especially in this league,"" Washington guard Malcolm Brogdon said. ""There are no easy games. You've got to pick yourself up. It's really you against you out here. At the end of the day, it's about you performing up to the level you know you can play at."" Things are only going to get tougher for the Wizards, who are beginning a four-game stretch against Milwaukee, Cleveland, Dallas and Denver. The Bucks posted a 106-103 road win over the Miami Heat on Tuesday despite playing without both Giannis Antetokounmpo (left knee soreness) and Khris Middleton (ankle surgery). Damian Lillard led the way with 37 points and 12 assists. Antetokounmpo is expected to return on Saturday, while Middleton could make his season debut against the Wizards after completing a full 5-on-5 practice earlier this week. Middleton will join a much different team than the one that struggled to close out games in the first few weeks of the season. Lillard has four double-doubles in his last five games for Milwaukee, which led by as many as 22 points in the third quarter against Miami. ""We're beating good teams,"" Lillard said after Tuesday's game. ""We're winning at home. We're winning on the road in a game like tonight without Giannis, the way we're doing it is sustainable. And it's showing that we're doing what we wanted to be doing coming into the season, so it's definitely positive."" Veteran guard Pat Connaughton is also putting his slow start to the season behind him. He had 10 points and eight rebounds off the bench against the Heat in his first action since Nov. 16. ""He has one of the highest basketball IQs, if not the highest basketball IQ out there,"" Bucks center Brook Lopez said.

After starting 0-for-5 shooting, Sears did not play the final 11 minutes in the 100-87 win against the Illini at his own request, Alabama coach Nate Oats revealed afterward. Sears, who Oats said believed that night the Tide were performing better without him, returned to form in Las Vegas. Grant Nelson had 17 points and nine rebounds in the win over Rutgers, and a trio of reserves -- Mouhamed Dioubate, Derrion Reid and Jarin Stevenson -- scored 10 points each. Dioubate also grabbed nine rebounds. ""Kind of the second game in a row we won off of toughness and rebounding,"" Oats said in the postgame press conference. ""We'll get our offense figured out."" Although Alabama heads into Saturday's contest averaging 89.7 points per game, tied for 11th in the nation entering Friday's play, Oats was critical of the Crimson Tide's efficiency. Alabama is shooting only 32.8 percent from 3-point range, a steep drop from the 37.3 percent the 2023-24 Tide shot en route to the program's first-ever Final Four appearance. Oregon (7-0), meanwhile, has held opponents to 29.5 percent shooting from deep after limiting San Diego State to 6-of-19 on 3-point attempts in the Ducks' 78-68 semifinal win on Wednesday. TJ Bamba's 22 points led five Oregon scorers in double-figures. ""TJ is doing things right now we saw in the summer,"" Ducks assistant coach Mike Mennenga said in a postgame radio interview. ""He's finding his rhythm and his comfort level, and most importantly, his teammates have got his back. They trust TJ and want him to be aggressive, they want him to be physical."" Bamba is averaging 13.1 points per game, one of four Ducks scoring in double-figures a contest. Jackson Shelstad is posting 10.3 points per game despite a slow opening stretch of 9-of-35 from 3-point distance. Brandon Angel is averaging 11 points per game. Pacing Oregon thus far is Nate Bittle's 14 points a contest. Against San Diego State, Bittle had 11 points, two blocked shots and nine rebounds to help the Ducks to a 41-24 advantage on the glass. Oregon has been solid on the boards through its first seven games, particularly on the offensive end, where the Ducks have a 35-percent offensive rebounding rate per KenPom.com metrics. The Ducks opened the Players Era Festival on Tuesday by beating Alabama's Southeastern Conference counterpart Texas A&M, 80-70. With the two wins in Las Vegas extending a stretch that included a come-from-behind defeat of Oregon State on the road on Nov. 21, Oregon is off to its best start since the 2013-14 season when it opened the season 13-0. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The first-of-its-kind opportunity isn't lost on San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher. ""It's vitally important for us,"" Dutcher said. ""The Mesa Foundation has done an incredible job helping us win NIL, making our fan base aware that we need NIL to be successful. Then to get to play in the (Players Era) event will be nothing but helpful to our program moving forward. It's competitive out there and we have to remain competitive. Not only on the court, but in the NIL world."" Houston (4-2) finds itself in the third-place game after losing an 85-80 overtime thriller in its tournament opener against No. 9 Alabama before beating Notre Dame 65-54 the following day. Houston's four wins have come by an average of 37.5 points. The Cougars also lost to Auburn by five earlier in the month. ""When you've got two really good teams, somebody's going to win and somebody's going to lose,"" coach Kelvin Sampson said following the loss to Alabama. ""It doesn't mean that the team that wins is that much better. It doesn't mean that the team that loses is a bad team. I mean, those two teams are about as even as it gets. ""We were up on Auburn. ... We had a chance to win. We had a chance to beat Alabama. The bottom line is we didn't beat either one, but we had a chance to. We just have to keep working to get better."" Houston is led by LJ Cryer, who is averaging 13.5 points through six games this season. He was 9-of-26 shooting from the floor and scored a season-high 30 points against Alabama. Emanuel Sharp is second at 13 points per game. San Diego State (3-2) was unable to build off a 71-53 win over No. 21 Creighton in its tournament opener, losing to Oregon 78-68 on Wednesday. ""Second half, we battled back,"" Dutcher said. ""I've got a good group of kids. And they're getting better. And we battled back and got close enough, but didn't get over the hump. So all these experiences are giving us a chance to grow as a team. And that's what we're going to look at it as, a chance to grow to start stacking games, like I've said."" BJ Davis leads the Aztecs in scoring with 15.6 points per game and has been their top scorer in Vegas with 18 in each game. Davis also averages 4.2 rebounds, one of four Aztecs averaging four-plus this season. San Diego State's other loss this season came to No. 3 Gonzaga on Nov. 18.

The Cardinal (6-1) opened 5-0 at home and then won at Santa Clara last Saturday before coming up short against Grand Canyon 78-71 in a neutral-site affair Tuesday in Palm Desert, Calif. Despite his team's winning streak, first-year Stanford coach Kyle Smith made two changes in his starting lineup for the Grand Canyon game, inserting forward Aidan Cammann and guard Ryan Agarwal among his three standouts, Maxime Raynaud, Jaylen Blakes and Oziyah Sellers. Cammann and Agarwal combined for just eight points, but Smith said afterward he's confident they'll be more productive as the young players become more familiar with their surroundings. ""As (Raynaud and Blakes) get better, I think other guys will follow,"" Smith said, ""and we'll be in good shape."" Raynaud has recorded double-doubles in all seven Stanford games, averaging 23.7 points and 12.6 rebounds per game. Blakes, a Duke transfer, had a season-high 22 against Grand Canyon. Cal Poly (4-4), meanwhile, continues a nonconference survey of the Bay Area, having already lost at San Francisco, Cal and Saint Mary's. The Mustangs conclude the tour with a game at San Jose State in December. Cal Poly has gone just 1-4 on the road, beating Eastern Washington, to offset a 3-0 start at home. The team edged visiting Grambling 82-79 in its most recent game Tuesday. One Mustang with whom the Cardinal should be plenty familiar is graduate point guard Jarred Hyder, who played two seasons at Cal. He had 13 points in his only previous trip to Stanford in 2021, and when last seen by the Cardinal, was contributing to the rival Golden Bears' win in the Pacific-12 Conference tournament later that season. Hyder had 27 points in a loss at Arizona State last week, but says the Mustangs' need to focus more on defense than big offensive numbers. ""If we stick to our defensive principles, that helps us get out and run,"" he said. ""That is a big emphasis for us."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Hurry adjusted to an underthrown back-shoulder ball in the front-left corner of the end zone, capping a three-play drive. It started at the Cardinal 37 after Isiah Revis made a diving interception of Ashton Daniels' third-down pass over the middle. Eget completed 33 of 49 passes with an interception for the Spartans (7-5), who await their bowl destination. His favorite target, as usual, was Nick Nash, who had eight catches for 91 yards and two scores. Nash, a finalist for the Biletnikoff Award given to the nation's best receiver, ended the regular season with 104 receptions and 16 touchdowns. Daniels hit 26 of 40 passes for 252 yards with a score and three interceptions for Stanford (3-9) while rushing for 91 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries. His 1-yard run with 7:39 remaining gave the Cardinal a 31-27 edge. But Stanford mistakes were the deciding factor. It not only lost the turnover battle 3-2 but committed 10 penalties for 115 yards. Stanford initiated scoring at the 5:49 mark of the first quarter when Emmet Kenney connected on a 24-yard field goal to cap a drive of just over seven minutes. The Cardinal reached the 10 earlier in the drive but false start and holding penalties kept them out of the end zone. San Jose State got its passing game going for 17 points in the second quarter. Eget connected with Nash for touchdown passes of 20 and 2 yards in less than four minutes, giving the Spartans a 14-3 lead with 5:25 left. Stanford got into the end zone for the first time with 42 seconds remaining on Daniels' 12-yard strike to Emmett Mosley V, but San Jose State took the momentum and three more points to the half. Kyler Halvorsen connected from 45 yards as time expired, making it 17-10 at the break. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Dart now has 10,213 yards and moved into 10th all-time in SEC passing yards. He also rushed for 77 yards on 13 attempts.  Bentley, who was healthy but did not play in last Saturday's 24-17 loss at Florida, had a game-high 136 yards on 20 carries and a TD.  Ole Miss leads the all-time series at 66-46-6. The Bulldogs' Michael Van Buren rushed for a TD and was 17-of-32 passing for 280 yards and a touchdown pass to Kevin Coleman Jr. (six catches, 118 yards). Van Buren also threw two interceptions.  Mississippi State (2-10, 0-8) went winless in conference play for the first time since 2002 and lost its 12th straight SEC game.  On the first series, the Rebels' Chris Paul Jr. stepped in and picked off Van Buren for his first career interception. Caden Davis soon drilled a 39-yard field for a 3-0 lead.  After converting a fake punt, the Bulldogs went for it again on fourth-and-7 at the Ole Miss 34. Van Buren hit Coleman on a shallow cross for a 7-3 Bulldogs lead at 7:54.  In the offensive backfield on third-and-1, defensive tackle JJ Pegues rumbled five yards for his seventh touchdown of the season at 2:16 to cap a 13-play, 75-yard drive. Then on the quarter's last play, Van Buren scampered in on a keeper from six yards. Bentley ripped off the Rebels' longest play of the season when he burst through the middle and sprinted 89 yards for a score and a 17-14 halftime lead. After missing a 54-yard kick to end the half, Davis drilled one from 43 yards in the third following a muffed punt return by Coleman that was recovered by Suntarine Perkins.

CJ McCollum paced New Orleans with a season-high 30 points. Dejounte Murray and Trey Murphy III added 21 points apiece while Yves Missi contributed 16 points and 14 rebounds. The Grizzlies entered the game with an 0-6 record in NBA Cup play over two seasons, but led throughout much of the game against the short-handed Pelicans. Memphis, which led nearly the entire game, pushed its advantage to 17 points late in the third quarter after two free throws by Jackson. Marcus Smart made and assisted several key baskets for the Grizzlies midway through the fourth quarter as New Orleans made its final run. The Pelicans trimmed the Memphis lead to nine points with 5:18 to go before Smart made a left-handed hook in the paint and followed with a walkup 3-pointer. Morant returned after missing Wednesday's game against Detroit because of a left knee injury. He entered Friday having missed nine of the Grizzlies' past 10 games.

Fourth-seeded Orlando dispatched ninth-seeded Atlanta 1-0 in their conference semifinal on Sunday via a late first-half goal from Ramiro Enrique scored in the aftermath of an uncleared corner kick. With Miami, Columbus and Cincinnati all losing in their Round 1 series, Orlando is the top remaining seed in the East. Manager Oscar Pareja has led Orlando to the MLS Cup playoffs in each of his first five seasons with the club after the Lions failed to make the postseason in any of their first five years in the league. Pareja, who has the most MLS wins without an MLS Cup Final appearance, understands how precious this opportunity is. ""This is history that needs to be written,"" Pareja said. ""It's a new game with the importance to get a championship, but also to advance to the MLS Cup Final. So we will be prepared. The boys are ready."" Orlando finished winless against the Red Bulls in the regular season, having drawn 1-1 at home on March 30 and lost 1-0 at the Red Bulls on June 1. But the Lions have been a far better team since Aug. 31, winning six of their final eight league games to improve their playoff positioning. The seventh-seeded Red Bulls won only three regular-season matches following that June 1 clash before finding better form as the playoffs began. That dip in form coincided with the absence of Emil Forsberg, who missed several months with a foot injury before recovering just in time for the postseason. Forsberg scored a goal in New York's series-clinching, penalty shootout win over Columbus on Nov. 3. Dante Vanzeir had a goal and an assist in a 2-0 East semifinal win at sixth-seeded New York City FC last Saturday as the Red Bulls kept a second consecutive away playoff clean sheet. But first-year manager Sandro Schwarz insists his side must be at their absolute best on Saturday to earn the right result. ""We have to be ready in our intensity and our energy level, in our mentality as well on Saturday,"" he said.

Though the Paladins (7-0) and the Jayhawks (6-0) have swept through their respective schedules, the quality of their opponents is dramatically different. While the Jayhawks have faced and defeated the likes of North Carolina, Michigan State and Duke, the Paladins have not faced a ranked team or one from the power conferences. Furman's best victory may have come Tuesday when the Paladins defeated Seattle 61-56 in a multi-team event in Las Vegas. Cooper Bowser had career highs of 17 points and 12 rebounds to notch his first career double-double for the Paladins. After the Redhawks trimmed an 11-point Paladin lead down to two with 4:30 to play, Furman's defense did not allow a field goal the rest of the way. The Paladins are winning their games by 25.6 points per game, the 11th-best scoring margin in Division I. They are led by PJay Smith Jr. with 19.2 points per game, one of the top 50 averages in Division I. He's hitting 53.3 percent from 3-point range, which ranked in the top 20 nationally as of Friday. He'll certainly be a key for Kansas' defense. ""The kid's the toughest dude on the court,"" Furman coach Bob Richey said after Smith poured in 29 points in a win over Tulane Nov. 15, ""and he goes out there and he competes on both ends and he does every single thing he can to win. And he's not only a point guard, he's going to be an all-league point guard and he's going to play this game for a while."" Kansas was also in Las Vegas on Tuesday to for a high-powered showdown with Duke. Kansas had a 32-20 first-half lead that was erased with a 12-0 spurt and neither team led by double digits the rest of the way. The Jayhawks were up 75-72 in the waning seconds when Kon Knueppel's 3-point attempt at the buzzer rimmed out. Dajuan Harris Jr. scored 14 points and added a season-high nine assists. Zeke Mayo added 12 points, and Hunter Dickinson and AJ Storr each scored 11. Dickinson was ejected from the game for kicking Duke's Maliq Brown in a scrum under the basket. The Jayhawks limited Duke freshman phenom Cooper Flagg to 13 points on nine attempts from the floor. ""Our ball screen defense was on point,"" head coach Bill Self said after the game. ""We flew around and we guarded well. The most impressive thing that we did was rebound the ball. We did a lot of good things and I am really happy with our guys. What KJ (Adams) did defensively on Cooper was good. We did a lot of good things but the biggest thing we did was find a way to win."" Dickinson leads Kansas at 16.7 points per game, joined by Mayo (12.5) and Harris (10.0) in double figures. But Kansas' depth is what makes the Jayhawks so hard to defend. Four more players are averaging between 9.7 and 7.8 points per game. Self didn't question the flagrant-2 foul on Dickinson that led to his ejection. In fact, Self believes the way the Jayhawks responded without their 7-foot-1 center might benefit them later in the season. ""(That could) be the best thing to happen to us (because) it'll teach (Dickinson) a good lesson and also it'll give some other kids some confidence,"" Self said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Evan Johnson led UMES with 15 points, but the Hawks shot 35.1 percent from the field (20 of 57) and their road record dropped to 0-8 this season. Ketron Shaw, who is averaging a team-best 18.4 points per game, was 3-of-14 from the field in the loss, held to six points. The Hawks will enter Saturday's matchup on a four-game losing streak. ""I thought the offensive rebounding was a problem for us,"" UMES coach Cleo Hill Jr. said. ""We need to be better fundamentally in that area as it has been an issue for us throughout the year up to this point. ""I think some guys played well (against Little Rock), but we need to be better in our transition defense and moving the ball better offensively. We will regroup and rest.

Kansas City (11-1) has played in a slew of close games this season and wrapped up this win when Raiders center Jackson Powers-Johnson unexpectedly snapped the ball. It caromed off the upper right arm of quarterback Aidan O'Connell, and Nick Bolton of the Chiefs recovered it at the Kansas City 37-yard line with 11 seconds left. Mahomes threw one scoring pass to become the franchise leader with 238, surpassing Hall of Famer Len Dawson (237). Fill-in kicker Matthew Wright matched his career high of four field goals for the Chiefs. Brock Bowers and Tre Tucker caught touchdown passes for Las Vegas (2-10), which dropped its eighth straight game. Bowers had 10 receptions for a career-best 140 yards. O'Connell completed 23 of 35 passes for 340 yards and two touchdowns for the Raiders. It was his first appearance since he broke his right (throwing) thumb in Week 7 against the Los Angeles Rams. O'Connell was pressed into duty after Gardner Minshew sustained a season-ending broken collarbone in last Sunday's 29-19 loss to the Denver Broncos. Wright kicked a 32-yard field goal with 9:53 left in the game to give Kansas City a 19-17 lead. The Raiders had a chance to take the lead but Daniel Carlson was short on a 58-yard field goal attempt with 2:17 remaining. Carlson also missed attempts from 56 and 55 yards. Carlson looked in line for one final chance before the errant snap on a play from the Kansas City 32. The Raiders trailed by 13 before stunning the Chiefs with two touchdowns in a span of 1:48. Las Vegas moved within six when O'Connell tossed a 33-yard scoring pass to Bowers with 1:40 remaining in the third. The score was set up by a 68-yard kickoff return by Ameer Abdullah. Then on the first play of the fourth quarter, O'Donnell threw deep and connected with Tucker on a 58-yard touchdown to give the Raiders a 17-16 edge. Mahomes passed the mark of Dawson, who retired after the 1975 season, with a 6-yard scoring pass to Watson to give the Chiefs a 10-3 lead with 2:14 left in the first half. Wright kicked field goals of 42 and 35 yards in the third quarter to boost Kansas City's lead to 16-3. Wright was signed this week to handle place-kicking duties with Harrison Butker and last week's hero, Spencer Shrader, sidelined with injuries. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Gabe Madsen, Utah's top scorer (21.8 points per game), led the Utes to a 94-48 victory over visiting Mississippi Valley State on Tuesday. The senior scored 27 points on a blistering 10-of-13 shooting performance with seven 3-pointers against the Delta Devils.

The 7-foot-1 center had missed the previous five games with an ankle injury. Utah shot 55.9 percent while holding MVSU to 34 percent shooting. It was one of a handful of blowout wins the Utes have had early on this season, which Utah coach Craig Smith believes can be beneficial in helping the team grow even if their games feel like pick-up matches at times. ""We just have to keep learning how to win,"" Smith said in an interview with the team's radio station.  ""We've got to keep growing. You've got to keep demanding ... have discipline, toughness. We're not as smooth as we need to be. We can play so much better on the offensive end."" Eastern Washington (1-6) has lost five straight games and enters Saturday with an 0-4 record on the road. Nic McClain leads the Eagles in scoring (16.6 points per game) and is second on the team with 5.1 rebounds per game. Eastern Washington led in the second half of its most recent outing on Tuesday but eventually struggled en route to a 67-51 defeat at UC Santa Barbara. ""Tonight, I thought we played good defense the first 30 minutes,"" Eagles coach Dan Monson said. ""We gave ourselves a chance to win because we defended and rebounded the best we have all season."" Eastern Washington played without starters Mason Williams (13.5 points per game) and Sebastian Hartmann (10.0 points per game). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

BYU (6-1) was held well below its scoring average of 90.0 points per game, but the Cougars hit 10 of 26 3-pointers and stymied the Wolfpack (5-2) into shooting just 36.8 percent from the field. Fousseyni Traore (10 points) was the only other player to reach double figures in scoring for BYU, which bounced back nicely from its overtime loss to No. 23 Ole Miss on Thursday. Michael O'Connell and Jayden Taylor each scored 16 points for North Carolina State. The Wolfpack lost for the second day in a row in this tournament after falling to No. 13 Purdue in the opener. BYU freshman Egor Demin pulled down a game-high 11 rebounds to go with eight points and four assists in the win. BYU hit its first four 3-pointers and grabbed an early 10-point lead after a left-handed jam by Demin. NC State pulled within 19-14 after back-to-back 3s by Breon Pass and Taylor. The Cougars responded with a 6-0 run and maintained that 11-point lead into intermission. Taylor hit a 3-pointer right after halftime to bring the Wolfpack back to within single digits, but it was all BYU after that. The Cougars went on a 14-2 run thanks to a pair of Demin layups, two 3-pointers by Kanon Catchings and a triple from Saunders for a 52-32 lead with 15:27 to go.

After an underwhelming week bumped them from the AP Top 25, the Red Storm attempt to bounce back Saturday when they host Harvard in New York. St. John's (5-2) won its first four games and entered the rankings for the first time since January 2019 but promptly dropped out after a 1-2 showing in the Bahamas. The Red Storm blew an 18-point lead to then-No. 13 Baylor in a double-overtime loss and fell 66-63 to Georgia in a one-off game on Sunday. Those losses sandwiched an 80-55 thumping of Virginia to close the Baha Mar Championship. Sunday's loss was St. John's worst offensive showing of the young season. The Red Storm finished with their third-fewest points under second-year coach Rick Pitino and shot a season-low 31.1 percent from the floor. ""We had a difficult day offensively,"" Pitino said after his team shot 2-of-19 from 3-point range and lost despite forcing 24 turnovers. ""Our shots were not going down."" However, St. John's did get a few effective individual performances. Zuby Ejiofor scored 12 of his game-high 22 points at the free throw line, while Aaron Scott and RJ Luis Jr. chipped in 14 and 13 points, respectively. Kadary Richmond managed just three points on 1-of-8 shooting Sunday after tallying 26 points across his previous two games. ""As long as we play hard, fight, try to win games, I think we'll be OK,"" Pitino said. ""We're certainly not a great team, but we're a pretty good team."" Harvard (2-5) is averaging 66.9 points so far and is facing its second opponent from a power conference after a 22-point loss at Colorado on Nov. 17. The Crimson were held below 60 points for the third time and shot less than 40 percent for the fourth time when they took a 62-54 home loss to UMass on Wednesday. ""It was what we thought it would be -- the kind of game it usually has been with our two teams fighting, clawing and scratching for a chance to come out on top,"" Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said after Wednesday's game.

Rutgers is still trying to get more consistent on the boards and from the 3-point arc. The Scarlet Knights have a minus-1.5 rebounding margin this year and shot 2-for-13 from deep in the Alabama game. Another SEC opponent awaits in the Aggies (5-2), who lost 80-70 to Oregon on Tuesday but responded with a 77-73 win over No. 21 Creighton the next day. Texas A&M was unhappy with how it allowed Oregon to score the last 11 points of a close game. Facing Creighton and 7-foot-1 star center Ryan Kalkbrenner, the Aggies dominated in the paint 42-20 and grabbed 21 offensive rebounds. One of the best rebounding teams in the country last year, Texas A&M has maintained that physical identity this season and ranks sixth in D1 with a plus-12.4 rebounding margin. ""It starts with how we practice,"" guard Wade Taylor IV said. ""We have two refs in practice that are -- don't tell them I said this -- but are unbelievably terrible. One is a grad assistant, and one is an assistant coach. And they don't call anything. We just go about it every day being physical because that's who we want to be. We want to be the most physical team."" Zhuric Phelps (15.2 ppg) and Taylor (14.7) have been Texas A&M's leading scorers this year. Henry Coleman II (11.3 ppg) and Andersson Garcia (6.1) both average seven rebounds per game. Harper's 24.6 scoring average ranks third in Division I, and he adds 4.7 rebounds and 4.9 assists per contest. Bailey averages 17.8 points and 5.0 rebounds, and Jordan Derkack is a Swiss army knife in the backcourt with 8.0 points, 5.3 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.4 steals in seven games (six starts). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The two-way star wasted little time making a splash. His interception was on the third play of the game and his first score was an 11-yard catch to give the Buffaloes (9-3, 7-2 Big 12) a 21-0 first-quarter lead. Shedeur Sanders connected on 34-of-41 passes for 438 yards, five touchdowns and an interception, setting Colorado's single-season passing record. Koy Detmer had held that record since 1996.  Hunter had 116 yards on 10 grabs with three touchdowns and LaJohntay Wester had 11 catches for 175 yards and two touchdowns.  Micah Welch had a rushing touchdown for Colorado which kept its slim Big 12 Championship Game hopes alive. With Friday's win, the Buffaloes are a half-game ahead of the rest of the league, but two of the three teams breathing down their necks -- BYU, Arizona State or Iowa State -- need to lose tomorrow for Colorado to advance to Arlington next week. They could also get to the championship game if BYU and West Virginia both lose. Maealiuaki Smith was 11-of-29 for 70 yards and two interceptions for the Cowboys. Colorado outgained Oklahoma State 471-147. In the first quarter, the Cowboys (3-9, 0-9) offense managed 16 yards, threw a pick to Hunter on its first drive, went three-and-out on its second, had a fumble recovered by Shilo Sanders on its third and punted on its fourth. Oklahoma State had more penalty yards -- eight for 74 yards -- than it did offense -- 30 yards -- in the first half. The Cowboys had six three-and-outs and just one first down. Colorado opened the second half with Wester's 69-yard touchdown reception and its lead grew to 28-0. OSU fumbled on its next possession, which was recovered by Chidozie Nwankwo. The turnover led to Hunter's second touchdown of the game, an 8-yard pass from Sanders, and a 35-0 Buffaloes lead. After an Alejandro Mata field goal made the score 38-0, DJ McKinney returned an interception 13 yards for a touchdown and a 45-0 Colorado lead on the second play of the fourth quarter. The Buffaloes went up 52-0 when Sanders hit Hunter from 23 yards out as he was being pulled down for his third touchdown of the day. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Bobby Brink also scored and Ivan Fedotov made 22 saves for Philadelphia, which improved to 3-0-1 over its last four games. Flyers defenseman Rasmus Ristolainen recorded an assist in his fourth straight game. Meanwhile, New York dropped its fifth straight contest despite 32 saves from Igor Shesterkin, who was particularly impressive in the first period. Vincent Trocheck scored the lone goal for the Rangers, who now return to Madison Square Garden for a five-game homestand. The Rangers had a chance to draw even with 2:20 remaining, but Mika Zibanejad flubbed a wide-open shot from the doorstep. Konecny's empty-netter sealed the deal with 28 seconds left. Just over three minutes into the game, Tyson Foerster blocked a shot at the blue line, won a race to the puck along the boards and made a perfect behind-the-back, no-look pass to Brink, who beat Shesterkin from point-blank range. Philadelphia doubled its advantage just 50 seconds later. From near his own net, Ristolainen's outlet pass connected at center ice with Sean Couturier, who found Konecny with speed. The Flyers' leading scorer zipped past Jacob Trouba, moved the puck to his backhand and slipped a shot through Shesterkin's 5-hole for his team-leading 12th of the season. New York got within 2-1 midway through the second period. With Scott Laughton skating toward the Philadelphia bench to get a new stick, Will Cuylle found Trocheck with plenty of space in the slot. Trocheck snapped a wrister past Fedotov for his fifth of the season. Konecny's empty-netter marked his fourth multi-goal game of the season and his third in November alone. This was the first meeting between the Metropolitan Division rivals this season. The Rangers will host the Flyers on Jan. 23 and again on April 9. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Brosmer completed 17 of 26 passes for 191 yards without an interception for the Gophers (7-5, 5-4 Big Ten). Wisconsin (5-7, 3-6) closed the season with five consecutive defeats and its first losing season since going 5-7 under Barry Alvarez in 2001. It was the longest active streak of winning seasons among Power 4 teams. The defeat also likely snapped Wisconsin's streak of 22 consecutive bowl games, as there is almost no chance the Badgers get a bid as a five-win team because of Academic Progress Rate (APR). Darius Taylor rushed for 143 yards on 32 carries for the Gophers, who had a 374-166 advantage in total yards. Wisconsin was held to just 36 yards rushing on 24 attempts. Braedyn Locke completed just 15 of 32 passes for 130 yards. Brosmer's 1-yard plunge put Minnesota up 7-0 late in the first quarter, capping a nine-play, 89-yard drive. Brosmer completed 4 of 5 passes for 71 yards on the march, including a 21-yard completion on third-and-7 to the 1-yard line. The Gophers made it 14-0 on their next possession when Brosmer capped the 75-yard drive with a 7-yard scoring pass to Daniel Jackson. Minnesota pushed the lead to 21-0 with a methodical 11-play drive that consumed the first 6:02 of the third quarter. Brosmer completed all six of his passes on the drive, including a 15-yard touchdown to tight end Jameson Geers.

Wake Forest won despite getting next to nothing from its leading scorer, Hunter Sallis (18.4 points per game). He hit only 1 of 11 shots, missed all five of his 3-point attempts and finished with four points. But the Deacons, thanks to Spillers, dominated the boards 42-27. Lu'Cye Patterson scored 12 points for the Golden Gophers (5-3) and reserve Isaac Asuma added 11. Leading scorer Dawson Garcia, who was averaging 20.1 ppg, made only 3 of 12 shots and managed eight points with five rebounds. Garcia scored Minnesota's last points on a short jumper with 2:34 left that made it 54-51 but missed an open 3-pointer on the team's next possession. The Gophers had two other chances to draw within one or tie the game, but Spillers blocked Patterson's layup and Garcia turned it over in the lane. It took Minnesota just over 3 1/2 minutes to score, but once it did, it got on a roll. A 16-6 run, capped by Garcia's free throw with 10:40 left in the half, gave the Golden Gophers a 16-10 lead. Minnesota didn't commit its first turnover until the 9:22 mark of the first half. Wake Forest whittled the deficit by holding Minnesota without a point for more than three minutes and eventually regained the lead at the 5:43 mark when Ty-Laur Johnson converted a layup for a 21-19 advantage. The game went back and forth for the half's remainder with the Gophers having the last say, courtesy of Patterson. His layup with two seconds on the clock allowed them to hit the locker room with a 29-27 edge.

But the Hurricanes were exposed -- at least in Charleston -- as a weak team defensively and on the boards. Drake beat Miami 14-5 on the offensive boards and won the game, 80-69. Oklahoma State shot 10-for-22 on 3-pointers and beat Miami 80-74, and VCU shot 50.9 percent from the floor to record a 77-70 win over the Hurricanes Miami coach Jim Larranaga is hoping that a player such as Paul Djobet can step up in his reserve role. ""He worked very hard in the weight room in the offseason,"" Larranaga said of Djobet. ""He's much stronger."" Meanwhile, Charleston Southern is 0-6 away from home. But the Buccaneers have played a tough schedule, including three power-conference teams: Clemson, LSU and Georgia Tech. The Buccaneers gave perhaps their best performance of the season in that 77-68 loss to LSU. Charleston Southern led 34-29 at halftime. For the game, the Buccaneers had advantages on second-chance points (21-10) and points off turnovers (22-13). Individually, Daylen Berry led Charleston Southern with 19 points and 12 rebounds. Charleston Southern's Saah Nimley is in his first season as a head coach. He is a former Buccaneers player and assistant coach. He was the Big South Conference Player of the Year in 2015. Nimley's top three players this season are Taje' Kelly, Berry and R.J. Johnson. Kelly leads the Buccaneers in scoring (14.9) and rebounds (7.1), Berry is averaging 12.1 points and a team-high 2.4 steals and Johnson is contributing 10.1 points and a club-best 4.8 assists. In addition, freshman guard Anthony Gause is a player to watch. He is fourth on the team in scoring (9.3). ""He's a supreme talent,"" Nimley said of Gause. ""He's got to work on some things, particularly on defense. But he's going to be a really good player."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Before then, the Yellow Jackets will travel to play at Oklahoma and North Carolina, before heading to Milwaukee for a neutral site game with Northwestern Last time out, Georgia Tech pulled away from Charleston Southern for a 91-67 victory Wednesday. Leading by eight in the opening minutes of the second half, the Yellow Jackets used a 23-9 run to help snap a two-game losing streak. ""Happy to get back on the right track,"" Georgia Tech coach Damon Stoudamire said. ""It's a step in the right direction. We had, what I thought, were two or three days of good practices. Sometimes you can get humbled in thinking that you're a little better than you are. That's on all of us. Starting from the top all the way down the program."" A pair of heavily relied on sophomores in Baye Ndongo and Naithan George each led the team with 17 points in the win. Ndongo paces the team with 14.2 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. Lance Terry adds 13 points per contest, followed by Javian McCollum (12.8). Central Arkansas (2-4) is coming off a 92-83 double-overtime win over UNC Asheville. The Bears, of the Atlantic Sun Conference, are led by first-year coach John Shulman. A former NAIA power, Central Arkansas is still searching for its first NCAA Tournament appearance as a Division I member. Saturday marks the third of five power-conference opponents for the Bears, who are out to prove themselves under a new coach. ""We are trying to rebuild a program to get back to the prominence of the good old days here at Central Arkansas,"" Shulman said. ""It's been a process, a good process. ... We didn't come to this school not to play Georgia Tech. How are you going to get better if you don't play these big teams? We're not scared of them, but we respect them. We're going to go to battle."" The Bears fell at BYU 88-50, and at Utah 98-63 to start the year. They play at Arkansas and Oklahoma in December. Layne Taylor leads the team with 15.8 points per game, followed by Elias Cato at 15. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Pirates have had a week off to chart their next steps before Monmouth pays a visit Saturday to Newark, N.J. Seton Hall (4-3) narrowly beat Saint Peter's to begin the season, then lost by a point to both Fordham and Hofstra. After holding Wagner to a mere 28 points in a victory on Nov. 16, the team headed to Charleston and placed third. The Pirates beat VCU in overtime, lost 76-60 to Vanderbilt and then hung on for a 63-61 defeat of Florida Atlantic last Sunday. ""We don't play until Saturday, we got a couple days. I gotta see what lineups work best together,"" Seton Hall coach Shaheen Holloway told reporters at the time. ""But happy to come out 2-1 ... Florida Atlantic is really good, VCU is really good, so to beat those two teams, it's good for us."" The Pirates have the No. 4 scoring defense in Division I (55.7 points per game allowed) and Chaunce Jenkins leads the offense with 14.1 points per game. Question marks dot the rest of the transfer-heavy roster, and Seton Hall ranks near the bottom of Division I at 58.1 points per game. In this all-New Jersey matchup, the Pirates get to face one of seven remaining winless teams in Monmouth (0-8). The Hawks played at a multi-team event hosted by Stephen F. Austin and lost their three games by 10, five and 10 points. Jack Collins led Monmouth in scoring for the first time this season with 25 points in a 71-61 loss to Presbyterian. ""I was so happy for Jack Collins that he played like we all know he can,"" Monmouth coach King Rice said. ""We have to get tougher and there's some things that we know we can fix. We just have to keep working together to get our chemistry."" Abdi Bashir Jr. leads Monmouth with 19.5 points per game. In his last game against a power-conference foe, he dropped 38 points on Rutgers with a program-record 10 3-pointers in a 98-81 loss on Nov. 15. Bashir scored 30 against Stephen F. Austin but was held to 0-for-6 shooting and four points the next day against Presbyterian. When Seton Hall hosted Monmouth last year, the Hawks made the Pirates work for a 70-61 win. Isaiah Coleman, one of Seton Hall's few returning players this year, had a breakout game that day with 17 points. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Hart also considered LSU during his recruiting process, according to On3.com. The 6-foot-5, 190-pound Hart plans to attend the Texas-Texas A&M game in the regular-season finale Saturday, and will enroll early at College Station when the early signing period opens Dec. 4. Just 16 years old, Hart had been part of the 2026 cycle when he committed to Michigan in June, but now becomes Aggies coach Mike Elko's 22nd commit for 2025, per On3.com. Elko had been seeking another quarterback after Husan Longstreet flipped his commitment from Texas A&M to Southern Cal earlier this month. ""I've had a fair share of schools ask me to reclass these past couple of months,"" Hart told ESPN. ""I felt like I'm mentally ready to go to school and start the next step of all this. I just felt A&M was just the perfect place."" Hart led his Cocoa Beach, Fla. team to the state championship as a sophomore.

""This morning, after meeting with (chairman) George (H. McCaskey) and (President and CEO) Kevin (Warren), we informed Matt of our decision to move in a different direction with the leadership of our football team and the head-coaching position,"" Bears general manager Ryan Poles said. ""I thank Matt for his hard work, professionalism and dedication to our organization. We extend our gratitude for his commitment to the Chicago Bears and wish him and his family the best moving forward."" Warren said he supported the decision made by the organization on Friday. ""We understand how imperative the head-coaching role is for building and maintaining a championship-caliber team, leading our players and our organization,"" Warren said. ""Our fans have stood by us and persevered through every challenge, and they deserve better results. Our organizational and operational structure is strong, focused, aligned and energized for the future."" Offensive coordinator Thomas Brown will serve as interim head coach. His dismissal came shortly after Eberflus conveyed plans to conduct business as usual during his Friday morning news conference with reporters. He was then scheduled to meet with Warren and Poles. ""The operation has been normal,"" Eberflus said of his plans for Friday in the office, with players home for the long weekend before returning to practice Monday. The Bears have never fired a coach in-season and Eberflus indicated he didn't expect to be the first. ""I'm confident that I'll be working on to San Francisco and getting ready for that game,"" Eberflus said, pointing to the Week 14 matchup with the 49ers.  Eberflus, 54, won his coaching debut with the Bears, 19-10 over the 49ers in 2022, but is 13-32 since. On Thursday, Chicago lost 23-20 at Detroit, rallying from a dormant first half and had the ball in field-goal range when quarterback Caleb Williams was sacked. In a sequence that began with 32 seconds on the game clock, the Bears had options. They could have spiked the ball to stop the clock, attempting what would have been around a 60-yard field goal, or going for a first down with plenty of time to ""clock"" the ball. Another option Eberflus chose not to use was calling a timeout. Instead, the ball was snapped 28 seconds later and Williams heaved an incompletion down the right sideline as time expired. Media members repeatedly have questioned Eberflus in press conference settings about taking personal accountability. But on Friday he said the Bears handled the final sequence appropriately and ""the operation wasn't fast enough."" Wide receiver Keenan Allen said Thursday afternoon that ""we did enough as players to win the game."" Williams said the timeout call wasn't his to make. ""We can call a timeout there or we cannot,"" he said. ""I'm not going to say I was surprised. My job is just to go out there and make plays. I let the coaches and everybody make that decision -- it is their call. Maybe in the later years of my career, it will be my call."" Poles paid a personal visit to Williams in the locker room for a discussion, and Warren stood watch to take in the wide-lens scene of the locker room packing to return to Chicago with an 0-3 record in the NFC North. The Bears had chances to beat all three division opponents, but the Packers blocked a game-winning FG attempt by Cairo Santos, the Vikings escaped Chicago with a 30-27 overtime win and the Lions wriggled away Thanksgiving Day with Chicago threatening in the final minute. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Galloway got the start with point guard Kanaan Carlyle sidelined by a lower body injury. Malik Reneau added 21 points on 8-of-9 shooting for the Hoosiers, who made 53.3 percent of their shots both overall and from deep as they hit 8 of 15 from 3-point range.

In the final 2:48 of the first half, Mgbako scored seven points to help Indiana to a 44-34 lead at the break. Each time the Friars made a move in the second halfa, Galloway and Mgbako had all the answers for Indiana. Mgbako's 3-pointer with 17:08 remaining maxed out the Hoosiers' lead at 57-38.

Up until this point, I've been doing everything I can to avoid that. I want to be back out there with my guys and finish the season. That's my goal. That's what I want to do. Beyond that, I don't know."" Lawrence was hurt in the Jaguars' Week 9 loss at Philadelphia. Mac Jones led the offense in his absence. Jacksonville returned from a bye last week and Lawrence was able to practice on Monday, but said he felt the clear benefit of rest during the downtime. He has completed 168 of 274 passes for 2,004 yards and 11 touchdowns with six interceptions this season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Less than 24 hours after Eberflus experienced a six straight defeat and third consecutive loss decided on the final play, the third-year coach conveyed plans to conduct business as usual before a Friday afternoon meeting with team president Kevin Warren and general manager Ryan Poles.  ""The operation has been normal,"" Eberflus said of his plans for Friday in the office with players home for the long weekend before returning to practice Monday. The Bears have never fired a coach in-season and Eberflus indicated he doesn't expect to be the first.  ""I'm confident that I'll be working on to San Francisco and getting ready for that game,"" Eberflus said, pointing to the Week 14 matchup with the 49ers. He won his coaching debut with the Bears, 19-10, in 2022 but is 13-32 since. On Thursday, Chicago lost 23-20 at Detroit, rallying from a dormant first half and had the ball in field-goal range when quarterback Caleb Williams was sacked. In a sequence that began with 32 seconds on the game clock, the Bears had options. They could have spiked the ball to stop the clock, attempting what would have been around a 60-yard field goal or going for a first down with plenty of time to ""clock"" the ball.  Another option Eberflus chose not to use was calling a timeout. Instead, the ball was snapped 28 seconds later and Williams heaved an incompletion down the right sideline as time expired.  Media members repeatedly have questioned Eberflus in press conference settings about taking personal accountability. But on Friday he said the Bears handled the final sequence appropriately and ""the operation wasn't fast enough."" Wide receiver Keenan Allen said Thursday afternoon that ""we did enough as players to win the game."" Williams said the timeout call wasn't his to make. ""We can call a timeout there or we cannot,"" he said. ""I'm not going to say I was surprised. My job is just to go out there and make plays. I let the coaches and everybody make that decision - it is their call. Maybe in the later years of my career, it will be my call."" Poles paid a personal visit to Williams in the locker room for a discussion, and Warren stood watch to take in the wide-lens scene of the locker room packing to return to Chicago with an 0-3 record in the NFC North. The Bears had chances to beat all three division opponents but the Packers blocked a game-winning FG attempt by Cairo Santos, the Vikings escaped Chicago with a 30-27 overtime win and the Lions wriggled away Thanksgiving Day with Chicago more than threatening in the final minute.  When Poles and Warren meet with Eberflus, and Bears chairman George McCaskey joins the discussion as he did in January with support for Eberflus to return, they will likely incorporate what they've heard from players in the locker room. It's also fair to presume they're listening to open discussion from Eberflus' peers on the late-game braincramp. New England Patriots first-year coach Jerod Mayo stepped away from the final minute of the Bears' loss on CBS Thursday to talk to his coaches and support staff about the time management elements in play and how they would navigate the situation.   ""I probably would've handled it a little bit differently,"" Mayo said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Wisconsin (7-0) hasn't played since Sunday's 81-75 victory over Pittsburgh in the Greenbrier Tip-Off tournament. The Badgers are off to their best start since 2014-15, a season in which they reached the NCAA Tournament final. Chicago State (0-8) lost to Drexel 83-71 in Tuesday's third-place game at the Sunshine Slam in Daytona Beach, Fla. The Badgers returned just two starters -- Steven Crowl and Max Klesmit -- after leading scorer AJ Storr transferred to Kansas and three-year starter Chucky Hepburn departed to Louisville. Graduate transfer John Tonje, limited to eight games last season at Missouri due to medical issues, has come on to average a team-best 23.0 points per game, including a career-high 41 in a Nov. 15 win over Arizona. He is shooting 95.2 percent from the free-throw line, tops in the country among players with 30 or more attempts. Tonje was named Big Ten Player of the Week on Monday for the second consecutive week. He scored 25 of his team-high 33 points in the second half in the comeback win over Pitt, finishing a perfect 10 of 10 from the line. ""It's like he's been here four years,"" Wisconsin coach Greg Gard said of Tonje. ""He's fit in perfectly within the culture, because he's a really good person. He cares about his team, he cares about winning."" John Blackwell and Nolan Winter moved into the starting lineup this season. Blackwell is second in scoring at 16.0 per game, including a career-high 30 vs. UT-Rio Grande Valley. Winter adds 9.3 points and a team-high 5.6 boards. Wisconsin, long known for its defensive style, has scored at least 79 points in each of its first seven games -- the longest such streak in school history. The Badgers are averaging 86.9 points per game, while allowing 71.6. Wisconsin entered the week leading the nation in free-throw percentage at 86.5 percent. The Badgers have made more free throws (147) than their opponents have attempted (131). Chicago State, which joined the Northeast Conference this season, averages just 59.1 points per game, allowing 84.4. The Cougars' point differential of minus-25.3 ranks 351st out of 355 teams in scoring margin. First-year coach Scott Spinelli's squad has struggled offensively, shooting just 34.4 percent overall and 29.7 percent from 3-point range. They are shooting 65.0 percent from the free-throw line, averaging 11.1 attempts per game to 17.4 for opponents. Jalen Forrest averages a team-high 9.5 points, and Quincy Allen is the leading rebounder at 4.3. Spinelli knew his team, which finished 13-19 last season, would face challenges in his first year. ""We've got kind of a new bunch here of players, a lot of new faces,"" Spinelli said at the Northeast Conference media day before the season. ""We lost 75 percent of our scoring from last year. Really kind of a work in progress."" Wisconsin has swept the last three matchups with Chicago State, all in Madison, including an 80-53 victory last December. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Falcons are seeking their first winning season and playoff appearance since 2017. Prior to the bye last week, Atlanta lost 38-6 on the road to the Denver Broncos. The offense managed just 226 total yards, while producing its lowest point total of the season. The Falcons' defense didn't fare much better, as the unit was gashed by rookie quarterback Bo Nix, who threw four touchdowns. QB Kirk Cousins has thrown for 2,807 yards -- good for fifth in the NFL -- and would become the first Falcons quarterback since Matt Ryan in 2008 to lead the team to the playoffs in his first year. Chargers first-year head coach Jim Harbaugh has his team in the second AFC wild-card spot, sandwiched between the 8-4 Baltimore Ravens and 7-5 Broncos and gained more breathing room with Miami's loss at Green Bay on Thanksgiving night. After starting the year 3-3, the Chargers won four games in a row before dropping their home game Monday to the Ravens, 30-23. In a battle between Jim and his brother John, Los Angeles squandered a 10-0, second-quarter lead. Making matters worse, starting running back J.K. Dobbins suffered an MCL sprain in his left knee in the loss, and is expected to be out this week. He is considered week-to-week beyond that. Chargers backup running backs Gus Edwards and Hassan Haskins will try to account for the absence of Dobbins, who's rushed for 766 yards and eight touchdowns this season. Pittsburgh Steelers (8-3) at Cincinnati Bengals (4-7), 1 p.m., CBS Steelers coach Mike Tomlin heaped praise upon Bengals QB Joe Burrow for his MVP-level play in 2024 and warned his troops this road trip isn't one to take lightly. Pittsburgh isn't panicked after a surprising Thursday night loss at Cleveland last week and with 10 days between games, Tomlin expects an effort representative of a division leader on Sunday. All three of the Steelers' losses this season have come against teams that currently have a losing record. Pittsburgh also fell to the Dallas Cowboys and Indianapolis Colts. The Bengals have been in a rut -- with three losses in their past four games -- and were on the wrong end of a 34-27 decision against the Chargers on Nov. 17. Like Pittsburgh, Cincinnati came back from a sizable deficit only to lose the last time out.  Joe Burrow threw three second-half touchdown passes against Los Angeles as the Bengals climbed out of a 27-6 hole, but Chargers running back J.K. Dobbins found the end zone from 29 yards out with 18 seconds left in regulation to break a 27-27 tie. Burrow went 28-for-50 passing for 356 yards and the three TDs. Making things harder for the Steelers could be the absence of linebacker Alex Highsmith, who did not practice on Wednesday because of an ankle injury that has forced him to miss two games. Houston Texans (7-5) at Jacksonville Jaguars (2-9), 1 p.m., FOX A week after a demoralizing loss to the Tennessee Titans, the AFC South-leading Texans visit Jacksonville with the Jaguars rested following a bye week. The week prior, Jacksonville was overwhelmed in a humiliating 52-6 loss to the Detroit Lions. It marked the fourth straight setback for the Jaguars, who had dropped their previous three games by a combined 13 points. Jaguars coach Doug Pederson noted that changes are coming, although he opted not to show his cards. QB Trevor Lawrence, who has not played since Nov. 3 due to a left shoulder injury, is eager to play and compete against Texans QB C.J. Stroud, who has run into some struggles during his sophomore season. Stroud has thrown nine interceptions in 12 games (all starts) after throwing only five as a rookie. He was picked off twice in the 32-27 setback against Tennessee, also throwing for 247 yards and two touchdowns on 20-for-33 passing. The Texans have lost three of their past four games and four of their past six as defenses continue to solve Stroud. The Texans topped Jacksonville 24-20 back on Sept. 29. Arizona Cardinals (6-5) at Minnesota Vikings (9-2), 1 p.m., FOX Add the Minnesota Vikings to the observers who were urging the Bears to use a time out in the final 25 seconds of their Thanksgiving Day loss to the Lions, who maintained a one-game lead in the NFC North by hanging on for a 23-20 win. With their focus back on the field, the Vikings are targeting a second five-game winning streak this season when the Cardinals come to town. Minnesota claimed a 30-27 overtime win on the road against the Bears last Sunday. The Vikings have won each of their past three games on the road, and they return home for the first time since beating the Indianapolis Colts 21-13 four weeks ago. Arizona is trying to return to winning after a 16-6 defeat on the road against the Seattle Seahawks last week. The defeat snapped a four-game winning streak for the Cardinals, who started the season 2-4 but have gone 4-1 since then. But Sunday's game and a rematch against Seattle could prove pivotal for his team's postseason hopes. Two wins would put Arizona at 8-5; two losses put the team below .500. Kyler Murray owns a 98.0 passer rating, throwing for 2,343 yards, 12 touchdowns and four interceptions. He also has 380 yards and four touchdowns on the ground. James Conner is Arizona's top backfield threat with 705 rushing yards and five touchdowns. Tight end Trey McBride has a team-high 61 catches for 685 yards. Indianapolis Colts (5-7) at New England Patriots (3-9), 1 p.m., CBS Penalties crippled the Colts' offense and erased multiple big plays by QB Anthony Richardson in Week 12, a loss to the Lions that left the locker room frustrated. But all is not lost for the Colts as they hit the road for another AFC East opponent.  Richardson and Co. collected only 11 first downs in a 24-6 loss to the Detroit Lions. Richardson completed 11 of 28 passes for 172 yards. He was also the Colts' leading rusher (10 carries, 61 yards). Star running back Jonathan Taylor was held to 35 yards on 11 carries against Detroit, but Indianapolis coach Shane Steichen is hopeful that he will do more damage against the Patriots. Getting the run going could become even more important if wide receivers Josh Downs, Alec Pierce and Ashton Dulin aren't able to take the field. All three wouldn't have practiced on Wednesday had the Colts not opted to simply do a walkthrough. Downs' absence could end up hurting Indianapolis the most. The second-year man has a team-leading 53 catches for 594 yards and four TDs. Patriots rookie QB Drake Maye said he's not worried about the so-called wall first-year players often encounter with the longer NFL season. Maye makes his ninth appearance (eighth start) of the campaign. He didn't excel in the Patriots' 34-15 loss to the Miami Dolphins last Sunday. He finished with 222 yards, one touchdown and one interception on 22-of-37 passing. Seattle Seahawks (6-5) at New York Jets (3-8), 1 p.m. ET, FOX Most of the focus for the Jets, who have lost six of their past seven games, already points to next season. That's part of the reason they might not risk a hobbled Breece Hall, who has 632 yards rushing along with 46 catches for 401 yards and six total touchdowns this season but began the week with a knee injury coming out of the bye week. QB Aaron Rodgers, who turns 41 Monday, wasn't among those listed on the injury report for the first time since September.  The streaky Seahawks are back to their winning ways and are tied with the Cardinals atop the NFC West. After opening the season by going 3-0, Seattle lost five of its next six games before winning its past two against division rivals. Coach Mike Macdonald's defense has been much improved since a bye in Week 10, as the Seahawks defeated the host San Francisco 49ers 20-17 and visiting Arizona 16-6 over the past two weeks. Coby Bryant returned an interception 69 yards for a touchdown and Leonard Williams had 2.5 sacks against the Cardinals. Tennessee Titans (3-8) at Washington Commanders (7-5), 1 p.m. ET, CBS Trade deadline acquisition Marshon Lattimore, a physical cornerback picked up from the Saints, could debut for the Commanders. They could use a jolt. Having lost three straight after a 7-2 start, the Commanders last won Nov. 3 on Hail Mary touchdown from rookie QB Jayden Daniels. Tennessee is coming off a 33-27 upset of the Houston Texans that featured one of Will Levis' best starts of the season. Washington has lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys the past three weeks and enters Week 13 two games behind the NFC East-leading Eagles. After sputtering for three quarters against Dallas, Washington scored 17 fourth-quarter points in a wild 34-26 loss last week. Daniels completed 25 of 38 passes for 274 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions, but 86 of those yards came on a late catch-and-run score by Terry McLaurin. In the three recent losses, Daniels has a 61.5 completion percentage, three touchdowns, three interceptions and a 77.7 passer rating while being sacked 10 times. Daniels did have his best rushing day since Week 1 when he gained 74 yards against Dallas. Improvement might not come easy. The Titans' defense that ranks second in the NFL behind the Eagles, giving up just 276.4 yards per game. Levis returned from his right shoulder injury and the Titans have averaged 224.3 passing yards per game, with nine touchdown passes and six interceptions in the past six outings. RB Tony Pollard had his best game of the season against Houston, rushing 24 times for 119 yards and a touchdown. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (5-6) at Carolina Panthers (3-8), 4:05 p.m. ET, FOX Few introductions are needed on Sunday, as first-year Panthers coach Dave Canales came to Carolina after serving as Buccaneers offensive coordinator a season ago. Canales' prized pupil last season, Tampa Bay quarterback Baker Mayfield was with the Panthers for part of the 2022 campaign. The Buccaneers (5-6) playing a division opponent for the first time since an Oct. 27 loss to the Atlanta Falcons. The goal will be notching back-to-back wins for the first time since the first two weeks of the season. Four different ball-carriers, including Mayfield, found the end zone on the ground during a 30-7 drubbing of the New York Giants last Sunday. Mayfield also completed 24 of 30 passes for 294 yards. Star wideout Mike Evans was back in action for Tampa Bay following a three-game absence due to a hamstring injury. He finished with five receptions for 68 yards against the Giants and now gets a crack at a Carolina team allowing a league-high 30.9 points per game this season.  However, the Panthers have tightened up their play as of late, winning two games in a row before hanging with the two-time defending champion Kansas City Chiefs in a 30-27 setback last Sunday. The outing against Kansas City may have been the most efficient performance of Panthers quarterback Bryce Young's two-year career. Young completed 21 of 35 passes for 263 yards and one score without throwing a pick.  Carolina and Tampa Bay might as well get used to each other, as the two teams will collide again in four weeks. Los Angeles Rams (5-6) at New Orleans Saints (4-7), 4:05 p.m. ET, FOX The Saints won both games they have played since interim head coach Darren Rizzi was promoted from special teams coordinator to replace Dennis Allen, who was fired Nov. 4 after a seven-game losing streak. New Orleans comes out of its bye sitting in third place in the NFC South, two games behind the Falcons and one game behind the Buccaneers. The Rams' visit will be the third straight home game for Rizzi as interim head coach. The Saints beat the Falcons 20-17 in his debut and followed that with a 35-14 victory over Cleveland in which they outscored the Browns 21-0 in the fourth quarter. A series of significant injuries contributed to the losing streak, but New Orleans has gotten progressively healthier in recent weeks. Quarterback Derek Carr improved in each of the last three contests after returning from a three-game absence caused by an oblique strain. The return of center Erik McCoy from groin surgery after a seven-game absence was a boost against the Browns. The Saints' signing of veteran receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling on Oct. 22 with top receivers Chris Olave and Rashid Shaheed injured has given Carr a much-needed big-play threat. In the past two games, Valdes-Scantling has three touchdown receptions and has averaged 39.2 yards on five catches. The Rams are coming off a 37-20 home loss against the Eagles on Sunday night, their second defeat in three games after a three-game winning streak. They are tied with the San Francisco 49ers for last place in the NFC West, but they're just one game behind the first-place Seahawks and Cardinals and have one game remaining against each of the three rivals. Coach Sean McVay called the loss to the Eagles ""a humbling night"" after his team struggled on both sides of the ball. The defense allowed Saquon Barkley to rush for a career-high and franchise-record 255 yards as well as two touchdowns, and Los Angeles quarterback Matthew Stafford was sacked five times.  Philadelphia Eagles (9-2) at Baltimore Ravens (8-4), 4:25 p.m. ET, CBS The Eagles have won seven in a row and play four of their final six games in Philadelphia, traveling only about 125 miles to visit the Ravens this weekend and the Commanders in Week 16. Sunday's game features the NFL's two leading rushers. Saquon Barkley (1,392 yards) and Derrick Henry (1,325) are far ahead of Green Bay's Josh Jacobs (944) in third place. Henry leads the league with 13 rushing touchdowns. Barkley (10) is tied for fourth and Philadelphia quarterback Jalen Hurts (11) tied for second. The matchup also features two of the top candidates for Most Valuable Player honors entering Week 13 in Barkley and Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson, who won his second MVP award last season. Their competition includes quarterbacks Josh Allen of Buffalo and Jared Goff of Detroit, with Allen widely considered the favorite. The showdown at M&T Bank Stadium also pits Baltimore's No. 1 offense (426.7 yards per game) and No. 2 scoring offense (30.3 points per game) against Philadelphia's No. 1 defense (274.6) and No. 6 scoring defense (18.1). The Eagles have held seven consecutive opponents to under 300 total yards, while the Ravens have gained at least 329 yards of offense in all 11 games. Philadelphia is coming off a 37-20 road win over the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday night in which Barkley smashed the franchise record with 255 rushing yards. Baltimore also earned a prime-time win in Los Angeles last week, defeating the Chargers 30-23 in the ""Harbaugh Bowl"" on Monday night behind Jackson's three touchdowns (two passing, one rushing). Philadelphia is 5-1 away from home this season -- 6-1 if you count their season-opening ""home"" victory against the Packers in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Baltimore is 4-1 at home. San Francisco 49ers (5-6) at Buffalo Bills (9-2), 8:20 p.m. ET, NBC Buffalo can clinch the AFC East before the calendar flips to December while the 49ers are staggered and stumble into New York bracing for snow with a good chance of backups in the forecast. QB Brock Purdy (shoulder) missed the Week 12 loss at Green Bay and San Francisco was also without All-Pro DE Nick Bosa (oblique, hip), with LT Trent Williams (ankle) motoring through the locker room this week on a knee scooter. Buffalo is not the ideal place to try to get healthy. The Bills dealt the Chiefs their only loss this season and Buffalo has scored at least 30 points in five consecutive games. QB Josh Allen has passed for 18 touchdowns against five interceptions this season after throwing a career-worst 18 picks last season. San Francisco got walloped last week without Purdy, falling 38-10 to the host Packers. Brandon Allen started at quarterback and completed 17 of 29 passes for 199 yards with one touchdown pass, one interception and one lost fumble. Allen is 2-8 as an NFL starter. He is again getting heavy work in practice in case Purdy's shoulder doesn't significantly improve. The 49ers could use a big performance from running back Christian McCaffrey, who had just 31 yards on 11 carries and caught three passes for 37 yards against Green Bay. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""We need that one win,"" said Bearcats running back Corey Kiner. ""We're trying to send the seniors out right. The underclassmen understand that, the older guys understand that, everybody understands that."" Understanding and doing are two different things, though, as Cincinnati (5-6, 3-5) has learned during a four-game losing streak that has brought the team to the brink of elimination from bowl eligibility.  The Bearcats were never in last week's 41-15 loss at Kansas State, trailing 27-3 at halftime. They allowed 281 yards on the ground and couldn't get Kiner going until it was too late. Kiner, the first Cincinnati player with back-to-back 1,000-yard rushing seasons since Michael Warren in 2018-19, eventually ran for 140 yards. But with the defense getting gashed constantly on the ground, his contributions weren't close to being enough. Meanwhile, the Horned Frogs (7-4, 5-3) improved their bowl standing last week by stomping Arizona 49-28 on their Senior Day. It was the fourth win in the last five games for TCU, which scored touchdowns on five straight drives to break the game open. One key to the Horned Frogs' recent success has been an increased deployment of wide receiver Savion Williams in the backfield. He rushed for 80 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona and now has 312 yards on the ground, good for second on the team. ""There was one play against Utah and it was supposed to be a one-off,"" TCU coach Sonny Dykes said of the strategy. ""And then it was like, 'That was really good, let's do that again.' I think this has helped his draft status unbelievably."" In addition to his rushing total, Williams is also second on the team with 57 receptions for 596 yards and six TDs. This will be the first meeting of the teams since 2004, when Cincinnati earned a 21-10 home win. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

That's hardly the case on Saturday in Chapel Hill, N.C., where North Carolina's Mack Brown coaches his final home game against rival North Carolina State. The university announced Tuesday that Brown, 73, will not return next season, despite Brown telling reporters on Monday he planned to be back in 2025. ""While this was not the perfect time and way in which I imagined going out, no time will ever be the perfect time,"" Brown said in a statement. ""We've had the chance to coach and mentor some great young men, and we'll miss having the opportunity to do that in the future. ... We want to send these seniors out right and I hope our fans will show up Saturday to do the same."" In addition to the emotionally charged atmosphere at Kenan Stadium for the host Tar Heels (6-5, 3-4 Atlantic Coast Conference), the Wolfpack (5-6, 2-5) desperately need a victory to become bowl eligible. A loss to North Carolina would mark just the third losing season for the Wolfpack since Dave Doeren took over in 2013. NC State is coming off a 30-29 defeat at Georgia Tech in which the Yellow Jackets regained the lead with 22 seconds left on an 18-yard run by Aaron Philo. True freshman CJ Bailey has completed 63.7 percent of his passes for 1,941 yards and 12 touchdowns with eight interceptions. Bailey has also rushed for 201 yards and five touchdowns. With three straight wins over the Tar Heels, Doeren knows how significant a fourth would be, especially considering it would send the Wolfpack to a bowl game and end Brown's tenure on a sour note. ""I'm a little different,"" Doeren said. ""I guess I don't treat it as a normal game. ... It's something that matters deeply. Not just to Dave Doeren. It matters a lot to the former players. It matters a lot to the alumni, to the donors, to the administration. It's not that the other games don't matter. They do, but this one runs deeper."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Unfortunately for the Bruins, they weren't able to secure a bowl berth and their 2024 campaign will conclude on Saturday afternoon with a nonconference game against visiting Fresno State. UCLA (4-7) needed to win its final two games to qualify for a bowl, however those hopes were dashed with a 19-13 loss to crosstown rival Southern Cal last Saturday at the Rose Bowl. ""They kept rebounding this whole season, so they will continue to be resilient and be the type of football players that I know they are,"" UCLA first-year coach DeShaun Foster said. ""The season is not over. They signed up to play ball, and we are going to finish the season on a good note.

UCLA recovered from a five-game losing streak by winning three in a row, but a 31-19 loss at Washington on Nov. 15 put the Bruins into a must-win situation against the Trojans. UCLA held a 13-9 lead entering the fourth quarter versus Southern Cal but only managed one first down on its final three possessions. ""We let one slip through our hands,"" Foster said. ""All of these losses have come to, pretty much, us just letting it slip through our hands. We have to find a way to finish games and just keep coming out after the half and play better and finish a game. We have to really put our stamp on the end of it. We've just got to learn from this."" Fresno State (6-5) secured a bowl bid with a 28-22 win against visiting Colorado State on Saturday.

Antetokounmpo had missed the Bucks' 106-103 NBA Cup victory at Miami on Tuesday due to swelling in his left knee. The two-time MVP has three triple-doubles in the last six games he has played.

The five-time overall World Cup champion will be sidelined for the Killington Cup slalom race Sunday. There's no timetable for her return to racing, the U.S. Ski Team said in a statement sent out before the start of the slalom. Shiffrin was leading after the first run of the GS on Saturday as she chased after her 100th World Cup win. With the finish line in sight on her second run, the 29-year-old leaned into the hill, lost an edge and slid into a gate, flipping head over skis. She then slammed into another gate before coming to a stop in the protective fencing. The banged-up Shiffrin stayed down on the side of the course for quite some time. She asked for a sled to take her down, because she “was in shock, entirely unable to move and worried about internal organ trauma,” Shiffrin said in a statement. Transported by ambulance to a medical center, doctors who evaluated her determined she had no ligament damage and that her bones and internal organs “look OK,"" according to the statement from the team. The team added that Shiffrin suffered severe muscle trauma and a puncture wound on the right side of her abdomen. She did not receive stitches because the wound is ""too deep and there is risk of infection,” Shiffrin explained. Over her 14-year career, Shiffrin has rehabbed from two previous on-hill injuries: a torn medial collateral ligament and bone bruising in her right knee in December 2015 and a sprained MCL and tibiofibular ligament in her left knee after a downhill crash in January 2024. Neither knee injury required surgery, and both times, Shiffrin was back to racing within two months. Sore from the crash, Shiffrin won't attend the slalom race Sunday — a race she has dominated. Shiffrin has won six of the seven times she competed in the slalom at Killington. She is a fan favorite at the venue after growing up in both New Hampshire and Colorado and sharpening her skills at nearby Burke Mountain Academy. “She can’t walk very well right now, so she can’t get to the venue even though she is dying to cheer for her teammates in person,” the statement from the team said. “She will be cheering loudly from her place in Killington.” ___ Graham reported from Denver. ___ More AP skiing: https://apnews.com/hub/alpine-skiing 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Verstappen, who'd been dropped from pole to second place after an incident with George Russell in qualifying, got his revenge on the Mercedes driver off the line in the race. Verstappen got alongside Russell to take the inside line into the first corner, then fended off a challenge from Norris into the next turn.  The race was packed with incidents as the safety car came out three times and Norris was dropped to the back of the field with a penalty for failing to slow under yellow warning flags. Charles Leclerc was second for Ferrari and Norris' McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri was third. Verstappen, who won his fourth consecutive title in Las Vegas last week, has won two of the last three races after not having had a victory since June before that.  At one stage, it looked like McLaren could seal its first constructors’ title since 1998 in Qatar as Norris and Piastri both eyed podium places.  After Norris' penalty, Ferrari cut McLaren’s lead from 30 points to 21 with Leclerc’s second place and a solid sixth for Carlos Sainz Jr. after a puncture seemed to have wrecked his race. The constructors' title will now be decided at the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi next week. Russell was fourth, ahead of Pierre Gasly continuing Alpine’s recent good form, with Sainz sixth and Aston Martin’s Fernando Alonso seventh. Zhou Guanyu picked up his and Sauber’s first points in eighth, ahead of Kevin Magnussen for Haas in ninth and Norris 10th after having been dropped to 15th by the penalty.  Lewis Hamilton and Sainz both picked up punctures shortly after a discarded wing mirror on the track was shattered by Valtteri Bottas’ Sauber. Carbon fiber and glass were spread across the circuit, bringing out the safety car again. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

About three hours after the game ended, they had their ticket to the Big 12 championship game punched when BYU's win over Houston provided the help they needed to advance to a meeting with Arizona State next Saturday night at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The Cyclones (10-2, 7-2 Big 12, No. 18 CFP) will make their second appearance in the conference championship game. They lost to Oklahoma in 2020. “It will have been earned. Our kids have really never wavered,"" said Iowa State coach Matt Campbell, whose team bounced back from two straight losses after a 7-0 start and won their third straight. “It'll be a great opportunity for our program and obviously for our fanbase to be able to be a part of that with us.” Becht’s first touchdown pass, a 15-yarder to Jayden Higgins, came after Myles Purchase recovered Avery Johnson’s errant pitch on the game’s first play from scrimmage. Becht’s 9-yard TD pass to Jaylin Noel came after Joey Petersen picked up Keagan Johnson’s fumble. Noel went over 1,000 yards receiving for the season with the catch. Becht’s 5-yard run put the Cyclones up 24-14 at half. “The ability for our kids to make critical plays in critical moments was certainly the difference in the game,” Campbell said. “We knew with the weather and the field, it was going to be a hard-fought football game. We were going to have to make those plays. Probably fitting for this team to win that way and finish the regular season. Really excited for them and what they’ve accomplished, and certainly for what the future holds for them as well.” A safety and Kyle Konrardy’s 20-yard field goal gave Iowa State an eight-point lead in the middle of the fourth quarter. The Wildcats (8-4, 5-4, No. 24 CFP) turned over the ball on downs at the Cyclones’ 35 when a pass went off Garrett Oakley’s hands on a fourth-and-2 with 4:59 left. They got the ball back for a final possession with no timeouts and 1:11 left when Kyle Konrardy missed what would have been a game-clinching 37-yard field goal. K-State went nowhere, with Avery Johnson knocked out of the game on third down and Ta’Quan Roberson throwing incomplete on fourth-and-15. Becht took a knee, and the fans poured out of the stands to celebrate with the Cyclones on the field. “Can’t play a team like that and make the mistakes we made,” K-State coach Chris Klieman said. ""We made some mistakes in that first half that led to points, and you can’t do that against good football teams. That’s obvious. “Congratulations to Matt and his team. They’ll represent the Big 12 well. They don’t make mistakes, and we made them today, and that got us down at halftime.” Avery Johnson threw touchdown passes of 28 and 65 yards to Jayce Brown in the first half, and his 7-yarder to Oakley pulled K-State within 24-21 late in the third quarter. He threw for 220 yards and ran for 64 on 13 carries, and Brown caught three balls for 106 yards. The Cyclones made a huge stop earlier in the third after DJ Giddens’s 36-yard run set up K-State inside the 5-yard line. They kept the Wildcats out of the end zone, and then Darien Porter blew through the right side of the line to block Chris Tennant’s 21-yard field-goal try. The defense recorded a safety when Jacob Ellis chased Avery Johnson into his own end zone. Johnson desperately unloaded the ball and was called for intentional grounding. Kansas State: The Wildcats failed to play spoiler after finding out their hopes of making the Big 12 championship game were squashed earlier in the day. Two turnovers, having a field goal blocked, surrendering a safety and failing to convert two fourth-and-2s hurt. Iowa State: The Cyclones' seven conference wins are the second-most in program history — they had eight in 2020 — and their 17 wins since 2023 mark their best two-year stretch. They also finished in the top four of the Big 12 for the seventh time in eight seasons. Iowa State could move up a bit with No. 12 Clemson losing this week. Kansas State: Will play in a bowl game.

ABC News: Sports,Face facts: Statues of stars like Kane and Ronaldo don't always deliver. Sculptors offer advice,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/face-facts-statues-stars-kane-ronaldo-deliver-sculptors-116332692,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 06:34:15 -0500",One art critic compared the new Harry Kane bronze statue to a bulging-jawed comic strip character,"One art critic compared the new Harry Kane bronze statue to a bulging-jawed comic strip character LONDON -- One art critic compared the new Harry Kane bronze statue to a bulging-jawed comic strip character.  In Miami, observers say the Dwyane Wade sculpture looks more like actor Laurence Fishburne than the former basketball star. Of course, the infamous Cristiano Ronaldo bust in 2017 gave the chiseled soccer star a chubby face and goofy smile. A statue of Mohamed Salah in 2018 depicted the Liverpool star with a disproportionately large head. In 2011, a terracotta warrior statue of Andy Murray at a Shanghai tennis tournament drew chuckles, including from the star himself: “I thought I was better looking than that."" It wasn't always this way. In classical times, sculptors “had absolutely no interest in depicting people accurately,” explained Lucy Branch, a London-based sculptural conservator. “What they ended up doing quite often, they recycled sculptures so when another athlete became more prominent, they just changed the name on the plaque,” said Branch, host of the “Sculpture Vulture” podcast.  “There’s this idea now, in this era, that commemorative sculpture should be like portraiture — it should look exactly like the person they are commemorating. But actually that's a really new idea in sculpture."" To avoid pitfalls, here are some tips from sculptors: London-based sculptor Hywel Pratley studied countless images of Queen Elizabeth II to create a memorial statue in the East Midlands town of Oakham. “A good portrait sculpture is evidence of 1,000 decisions after 10,000 observations,” Pratley said. In addition, Yorkshire county sculptor Steve Winterburn recommends getting close with a subject's family and friends to help find characteristics. “You don’t want it looking like a Madame Tussauds,” said Winterburn, who created a statue of five Rugby League greats at Wembley Stadium. “It still needs a bit of art in it, a bit of soul. That’s what makes art really sing.” The Ronaldo bust depicted the Portugal star smiling crookedly. Likewise, the Salah sculpture features the Egyptian smiling while celebrating a goal. In Miami, Wade's mouth is open in the statue representing the moment the player famously jumped onto a courtside table and yelled “This is my house.” It's probably best avoided. “It’s really difficult to do teeth looking good in sculpture,” Pratley said. Start ""by understanding the profile"" before moving on to determine widths from the front view, Pratley said. “Get the profile right and you will have won half the battle, because then you can have something at least that you can trust,” he said. “When you’re lost, you can say, ‘well I knew where I was then,’ — and you will get lost as a sculptor in the forms. ""There’s so many to understand. It’s not two dimensions, it’s three. There’s an exponential opportunity for everything to go wrong. If you’ve got the profile, then you can go forward with more confidence.” Winterburn tries to make the eyes “come alive” in his work. ""The eye is the soul of the person that carries it,"" he said. “If you look at a lot of public work, I’m not being funny, they’re dead. There’s nothing in them, they’re just featureless, soulless. With a painting, if in doubt, fade it out. With sculpture, there is nowhere to hide."" For Pratley, especially when he is working with a live model, “I’m often struck by how the absolute essence of somebody is somewhere between the nostrils and the mouth. The flicker of muscles and the subtle movement of muscles around the mouth is so much you — it’s so much that person.” Commemorative sculpture historically has been on plinths, Branch notes. “Part of the reason for that is because we put our heroes on a pedestal,"" she said. ""The problem is, the lower to the ground the sculpture is, the more scrutiny it’s going to get and the less it can get away with not looking quite right.” The Kane sculpture features the England captain seated. “Being so low, people get to look at it incredibly closely,” Branch said. “It’s trying to get sculpture to be more with the people, but then that comes with its own problems.” In the UK, local councils — like a city council in the US — might propose a project, fund it and select the sculptor, sometimes with little input from the public and limited vetting of artists. Branch says there's a better way: Vote on it. That's what happened for the Emmeline Pankhurst statue in Manchester. A selection committee used an online platform to get public input and Hazel Reeves' proposal to honor the suffragette won. “It is a really good balance and check for whether people on the committees have chosen the right sculptor or the right composition for that person who is being commemorated,” Branch said. “(The public) may not necessarily be highly educated about sculpture, but they always tend to know whether the artist has hit the nail on the head.” ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

MELBOURNE, Australia -- Unheralded American Ryggs Johnston won his first professional title by claiming the Australian Open by three stokes, while South Korea’s Jiyai Shin claimed her second Women’s Australian Open, which was played concurrently at two courses on the famed Melbourne sand belt. Johnston shot a 68 on Sunday to finish at 18-under 269 and three clear of Australian Curtis Luck (68), who had briefly taken the lead on the final stretch at Kingston Heath. The 24-year-old Montana native, with a world ranking of No. 953, is the first American to win the Stonehaven Cup since Jordan Spieth won it for a second time in 2016. Other former winners include Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player. “It’s just really cool to be in group that’s with those guys,” Johnston said. “And I’m just pretty honoured to be able to put my name on it now, and I’ll cherish this moment forever.” Marc Leishman (69), who plays on the LIV Tour, and fellow Australian Jasper Stubbs (70) were tied for the third at 14-under 273. After leading, or having a share of the lead after the first three rounds, Australian Lucas Herbert had a testing day on the greens as he shot a 74 to slide to 12-under and a tie for fifth. The day started brightly though for Johnston with an eagle at the first. But he followed that with two birdies traded with three bogeys as he made the turn with a 35.  The former Arizona State University player showed more composure in the final stretch, making three more birdies, for no bogeys, as he closed out the biggest win of his young career with par at the final hole at Kingston Heath, which will host the 2028 Presidents Cup. Defending men’s champion Joaquin Niemann couldn't repeat his 64 from Saturday which saw him storm back into contention and could only manage an even par final round of 72 for a 12-under 275 total and a tie for sixth. The 2022 British Open champion Cameron Smith shot 71 Sunday to finish at 3-under 285 and in a tie for 39th to end his four-tournament stint back home winless.  In the Women’s Australian Open, Shin withstood a late challenge from a fast-finishing Ashleigh Buhai to claim her second Australia Open title. Shin shot a 70 on Sunday for a 17-under-par 274 total to win by two shots from the twice defending champion Buhai (68).  The former world No.1 had led by as many as seven shots in the final round but Buhai's five birdies, with one bogey, on the final stretch made Shin's victory far less certain. The 36-year-old South Korean didn't falter and sunk a seven-foot putt at the last to close out her 65th professional title and a second Australian Open since winning in 2013.  “Now I can breathe,” Shin said. “I only had one Australian Open trophy so I am really excited for this next one, especially at this golf course at Kingston Heath. “I lost in 2008 to Karrie Webb so now I feel much better.” Buhai was bidding to become the first triple consecutive winner at the Australian Open and had a 12-foot birdie attempt at the last to narrow Shin’s margin to one shot, but it skirted by the cup.  The 17-year-old amateur Hyojin Yang finished third at seven under, 10 shots behind compatriot Shin, after a final round 72. Hannah Green (79) had a disastrous start to her final round, falling out of contention early with three bogeys and a double bogey in her first nine holes. Green finished in a tie for fourth with compatriot Grace Kim (70) at 6-under 285.  LPGA Tour regular Minjee Lee shot 71 to finish in a tie for seventh at 3-under 288, while her brother, PGA Tour player Min Woo Lee, had a 70 for a 5-under 282 and tied for 27th. The tournaments had alternating tee times — and with level prize money for the second consecutive year — at the par-72 Kingston Heath (par-73 for the Women’s Open) and par-71 Victoria Golf Club. Kingston Heath hosted the final two rounds after rotating with the Victoria Golf Club for the opening two rounds.  ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

In his first Premier League game at Old Trafford, the home crowd serenaded United’s players with “ole” as they played one of their best performances of the season.  It marks a big change from the boos that rang around the stadium toward the end of former manager Erik ten Hag’s reign.  In Amorim’s third game in charge in all competitions since taking over last month, United produced its best performance under him, with Marcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee scoring two goals each.  “It is a nice result. It is important with a new coach and a new way of playing, we are still learning. We have to back up this performance,” Rashford said. Amorim is undefeated since taking over last month and United is ninth - four points off the top four. While performances on the field are pleasing supporters, there were protests off it over increasing ticket prices.  A banner displayed both inside and outside the stadium read: “Stop exploiting loyalty”.  Third-place Chelsea beat Aston Villa 3-0 and Tottenham drew 1-1 with Fulham a week after thrashing Manchester City 4-0.  It hasn’t taken long for Amorim to get United’s strikers scoring.  Rashford has three goals in three games under the Portuguese, having managed four in 18 before that.  Rasmus Hojlund scored twice in the Europa League win against Bodo Glimt and Zirkzee’s double on Sunday were his first goals since the opening game of the season.  Goals had been hard to come by under Ten Hag, with United only scoring eight in nine games in the league before he was fired.  Rashford began the rout against Everton in the 34th minute and Zirkzee doubled United’s lead five minutes later. Rashford scored again a minute into the second half and Zirkzee’s second came in the 64th after a swift break.  Chelsea moved back level on points with second-place Arsenal after inflicting the latest loss on Aston Villa. Goals from Nicolas Jackson, Enzo Fernandez and Cole Palmer ensured Chelsea kept up with London rival Arsenal.  For Villa, it’s eight games without a win in all competitions and a fifth defeat during that run.  Villa dropped into the bottom half of the standings in 12th place.  Tottenham couldn’t follow up last week’s stunning victory against City with another win that would have seen it edge closer to the top four.  Brennan Johnson put seventh-place Spurs in front in the second half, but substitute Tom Cairney leveled the game before getting sent off late on.  ___ James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

After falling behind 17-0 at halfti... ATHENS, Ga. -- As the clock crept past midnight in a marathon for the ages, Nate Frazier finally ended it for No. 6 Georgia with a little 3-yard burst that may have locked up the biggest prize of all. Another trip to the College Football Playoff. Frazier ran for a 2-point conversion in the eighth overtime after Georgia pulled off an improbable fourth-quarter comeback, giving the Bulldogs a 44-42 victory over Georgia Tech on a Friday night that stretched into Saturday morning. “The overtime was epic,” Georgia coach Kirby Smart said. “What a great game.” After falling behind 17-0 at halftime and being dominated most of the game, the Bulldogs (10-2, No. 7 CFP) showed plenty of grit in their bid for a spot in the 12-team playoff — no matter how they fare in next weekend’s Southeastern Conference championship game against either No. 3 Texas or No. 20 Texas A&M. “That's for someone else to decide,” Smart said. “Our opportunity is in front of us.”  Carson Beck threw five touchdown passes — two of them in OT — in a game the Bulldogs never led until after regulation ended 27-all. He finished 28 of 43 for 297 yards.  Georgia Tech (7-5) was powered by Haynes King, who ran for for three touchdowns and threw for two more. But the Yellow Jackets took their seventh straight loss to the Bulldogs on a frigid, excruciating night between the hedges.  King passed for 303 yards and ran for 110 in a brilliant performance that wasn't quite enough.  Frazier, a freshman, took a handoff from Beck and burst up the middle, sending fireworks into the sky above Sanford Stadium.  It was the longest game in SEC history and just one overtime shy of the record for any FBS game — Illinois' 20-18 victory over Penn State in 2021 that went to nine extra periods. “We are a beat-up football team,” Smart said. “We've got to get well.” King scored on an 11-yard run to give Georgia Tech a seemingly comfortable 27-13 lead with 5:37 remaining, but the Bulldogs drove 75 yards in eight plays to give themselves a chance. Beck connected with Dominic Lovett on a 17-yard touchdown pass with 3:39 to go. Then, the Bulldogs’ defense forced a huge turnover by King after struggling to contain the slithery quarterback most of the game. He kept it himself on third-and-1 — only to cough up the ball on a big hit by Dan Jackson. Chaz Chambliss recovered the fumble at the Yellow Jackets 32, and Beck quickly guided the Bulldogs to a tying touchdown on a 3-yard pass to Lovett with 1:01 left in regulation. Then, it was on to overtime -- and a game that just kept going and going.  Beck and King threw matching touchdown passes followed by conventional extra points. Then it was King scoring on a 1-yard run, only to have Beck respond with a 25-yard scoring pass to Cash Jones. Both teams failed to convert their 2-point tries, so it came down to nothing but 2-point tries. Both teams converted in the fifth OT, but it was Frazier who finally ended it. “There's no moral victories,” Georgia Tech coach Brent Key said, fighting back tears. “But I'm proud of those guys.” The first half was an absolute stunner for the Bulldogs, who have long dominated the state rivalry known as “Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate.” Georgia Tech raced to a lead that could have been even bigger, outgaining the Bulldogs 307-137 in total yards and nearly doubling up in time of possession in the opening half. King, who has battled shoulder issues, looked to be fully recovered as he guided the Yellow Jackets up and down the field. He scored on a 2-yard run and threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Jamal Haynes, who made a soaring leap to the pylon. The Yellow Jackets also got a 31-yard field goal from Aidan Birr. But Birr also clanked a 25-yard attempt off the left upright, and Georgia Tech squandered another scoring chance when Haynes was stuffed for a 1-yard loss on fourth-and-1 at the Bulldogs 25. Even with those setbacks, Georgia Tech built its biggest lead over the Bulldogs since a 20-0 edge in the 2013 game -- when Georgia rallied for a 41-34 victory in double overtime. These Bulldogs did it again, extending their school-record home winning streak to 31 in a row. Georgia Tech: When Key took over this downtrodden program, he insisted the Yellow Jackets could compete with anyone — including their mighty state rival. This one will hurt for a while, but Georgia Tech showed it's on the verge of backing up his bold words after just two full seasons in charge. “He's done a tremendous job turning that program around,” Smart said. Georgia: The Bulldogs aren't nearly as dominant as the team that won back-to-back national titles during the 2021 and 2022 seasons. They surrendered 563 yards to the Yellow Jackets, including 260 on the ground. But, amazingly, Smart's squad still has a shot at winning it all for the third time in four years.  Georgia Tech: Awaits a second straight bowl invitation and another shot at its first eight-win season since 2016, which also was the last year they beat the Bulldogs. Georgia: Heads to the SEC championship game for the fourth straight season and seventh time in Smart’s nine years as coach. The opponent will be the winner of Saturday night’s game between Texas and Texas A&M. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

Pistons: The return of Cunningham from a back injury provided a boost to a team that had lost four of five. The point guard has had eight consecutive games of 20-plus points against the Pacers. Detroit improved to 9-12 overall and 5-7 on the road. Pacers: After three consecutive home wins in which Indiana fell behind by double digits before rallying, this time was different.

Sellers scored his second touchdown, this one from 20 yards out with 1:08 to play, for South Carolina's sixth straight victory, four of them in that run coming over ranked opponents. Are you paying attention, College Football Playoff selectors? “If the committee's job is to pick the 12 best teams, you tell me,” Beamer said. It would be hard to pick against the Gamecocks (9-3, 5-3 SEC; No. 15 CFP) with Sellers, a confident, poised freshman, playing as well as he is. He finished with 166 yards rushing and 164 yards passing. Two games ago, he set career bests with 353 yards passing and five TD throws in twice rallying the Gamecocks from fourth-quarter deficits to defeat Missouri 34-30. This time, Sellers shrugged off his interception near Clemson's goal with less than 11 minutes left to lead his team to a field goal and then his game winner. Sellers spun away from defender Peter Woods in the backfield, broke through the line and cut left to reach the end zone. Sellers hears defenders get angry when they get their hands on him but can't bring down the speedy, 6-foot-3 passer who is in his first year since taking over for Spencer Rattler. How does he do it? “I don't really know,” Sellers said. Beamer had an answer to that one, too. “He's a competitor, he's a warrior,” Beamer said. “He doesn't get too high or too low. He's out there having fun.” The Gamecocks hope to have more fun in a week or so, confident they'll hear their name called among the expanded field of 12 that will play for a national crown. They know, too, they'll have Sellers leading the way. “He's a magician, man,” Gamecocks linebacker Demetrius Knight Jr. said. “LeMagic, LeComeback, whatever you want to call him.” Clemson (9-3, 7-1 ACC, No. 12 CFP) had a final chance and drove to the South Carolina 18 with 16 seconds left — well within reach of a tying field goal — when Cade Klubnik was intercepted by Knight to end things. The Gamecocks were 3-3 after losing at Alabama in mid-October and then pulled off their longest winning streak since 2012. The Tigers were hoping to shore up a spot in the College Football Playoff 12-team field, but their offense had too many costly mistakes and their defense could not corral Sellers. “He’s a great player and made great plays,” Clemson linebacker Barrett Carter said. The Tigers will get another chance at making it into the playoff in the Atlantic Coast Conference title game. They qualified for the game after No. 8 Miami lost at Syracuse 42-38. They play No. 9 SMU. Clemson will be seeking its eighth ACC crown in the past 10 years. Clemson and South Carolina both entered this one with momentum, the Tigers having won three straight and the Gamecocks five in a row, including three consecutive over ranked opponents Texas A&M, Vanderbilt and Missouri. But neither team found its offensive rhythm in the opening half. Sellers was sacked by T.J. Parker and turned the ball over as Parker recovered with South Carolina inside the Clemson 20. The Tigers drove to the South Carolina 11 and turned down a chip-shot field goal to go for it on fourth-and-1. But Mafah was stopped way short by Jalon Kilgore and Knight. Klubnik had scoring runs of 13 and 18 yards for the Tigers.  South Carolina: What a run by the Gamecocks, who before the season were picked 13th in the SEC and now may find themselves part of the national championship playoff field. Clemson: The Tigers lost to both ranked SEC opponents they faced this season, first to No. 1 Georgia to start the year and then to rival South Carolina. Tigers coach Dabo Swinney was proud of his team's regular season but said — before Miami ended up losing — that the loss might leave it short of getting back to the playoff. “We could've had a great year,” he said. ""We got better this season, a lot of positives to build on. “But this one is tough. It's tough. It hurts."" Shane Beamer knew what a big week it was when he got a voicemail from his old boss, former South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier. “Beamer, you're doing great,” said Spurrier, who coached the Gamecocks from 2005-2014. “This might be the biggest game in the history of South Carolina.” South Carolina awaits the playoff selection committee's deicison on Dec. 8.

McCord threw for 380 yards and three touchdowns for the Orange (9-3, 5-3). LeQuint Allen ran for two scores and picked up two critical first downs on Syracuse’s final, clock-killing drive, and Devin Grant forced a fumble that he returned 56 yards for a touchdown to help the Orange beat a ranked foe for the third time this season. “I want to be the one who brought (Syracuse football) back to what it once was,” said McCord, who transferred from Ohio State after starting for the Buckeyes last season. “That’s a testament to this team. This win shows that Syracuse is for real and being part of that team that turned things around, that’s going to last forever. Looking back, everything (coach Fran Brown) said came true and coming here is the best decision I’ve made in my life.” Cam Ward had 349 yards passing with two touchdowns for the Hurricanes (10-2, 6-2, No. 6 CFP), who will be off next week while Clemson faces SMU for the ACC title and will have to hope for an at-large bid into the 12-team playoff. “If we get a chance to go into the playoff, we’re going to make the most of it,” Ward said. Miami had little trouble scoring but settled for a field goal on what turned out to be its final possession when coach Mario Cristobal declined to go for it on fourth-and-goal from the 10. “We use analytics. It was outside the 10-yard line with four minutes to go. Get the points. Get a stop,” Cristobal said. The Hurricanes didn't get that stop. Syracuse ran the ball eight times to run out the final 3:42, aided by an offside penalty. Miami had defeated Syracuse six straight times before this shootout, in which the teams combined for 983 yards of offense and 51 first downs. The Hurricanes began the season 9-0 but have lost two of three, falling three weeks ago at Georgia Tech. “We came up short and that’s on all of us, starting with myself,” Cristobal said. “We don’t shy away from it. We’re not in any way, shape or form anything but hard workers and accountable people. And it’s brutally difficult.” McCord was 26 of 36 and became the first Syracuse quarterback to throw for 4,000 yards in a season. His second touchdown pass to Jackson Meeks was his 27th of the season, also an Orange record. McCord couldn't resist a dig at his old school after the second-ranked Buckeyes scored just 10 points in a loss to unranked Michigan earlier Saturday. “Everything comes full circle,” he said. Allen finished with 143 yards from scrimmage for Syracuse — 22 carries for 82 yards and six receptions for 61 yards. Trebor Pena had six catches for 128 yards and a touchdown, and Meeks had seven catches for 110 yards and the two scores. “They made contested catches 80, 90 percent of the time,” Cristobal said. “We had a difficult time covering them. The ball was out quick. We affected (McCord) early but didn’t affect him much as it went on.” The game was tied at 28 when Grant forced a fumble by receiver Xavier Restrepo at the Syracuse 44. He scooped the ball and ran down the left sideline for the score, giving the Orange a 35-28 lead with 1:47 to go in the third quarter. “We do it in practice,” Grant said. “The ball is the program. You punch at the ball. I was grateful for it to come out and was fortunate to take it to the house.” Damien Martinez ran for a 2-yard TD on Miami's next possession to tie the game at 35-all. Allen's 3-yard run gave the Orange the lead for good at 42-35. Restrepo finished with 148 yards receiving on nine catches for the Hurricanes, and Jacolby George had six receptions for 121 yards. Miami scored touchdowns on its first three possessions and a rout appeared possible. A 40-yard touchdown pass from McCord to Pena midway through the first quarter was wiped out by an illegal formation penalty and seemed to deflate Syracuse. The Hurricanes dominated the first 15 minutes, outgaining Syracuse 189 yards to 42. ""We gave them 21 points. There were a lot of self-inflicted wounds,” said Brown, the Orange's first-year coach. “I think we were just tested again, about how tough we were and our will. I think the 21-0 (deficit) showed we won’t quit and that we’ll continue to push.” The Orange began their rally with two quick touchdowns in the second quarter. Allen took a handoff, bounced off a would-be tackler and maintained his balance for an 8-yard TD, and McCord connected with Meeks in the left corner of the end zone from 9 yards out to make it 21-14 at the half. The scoring didn't slow down after halftime. A 25-yard pass to Pena in the right corner of the end zone tied the game briefly at 21 with less than a minute to go in the third, but the Hurricanes countered three minutes later on Mark Fletcher Jr.’s second 2-yard score of the game. McCord and Meeks tied it at 28-all when they hooked up for another 9-yard TD. Miami must clean up its defense, and given the struggles on that side of the ball, Cristobal will be second-guessed for kicking the short field goal late. McCord and Syracuse showed tremendous fight and resilience. Miami awaits a playoff berth or a bowl game.

Dallas led the entire game despite playing without Luka Doncic (right wrist), Klay Thompson (left foot) and Dante Exum (right wrist). Naji Marshall left in the second quarter and didn’t return because of illness. P.J. Washington had 16 points and 10 rebounds for the Mavericks, who have won four of five games — all without Doncic. The Jazz have lost seven of their last eight games. Lauri Markkanen scored 19 points and Walker Kessler had 18 points, 10 rebounds and five blocks for Utah. The Mavericks led by as many as 20 in the first quarter, thanks to Grimes' quick start with four 3s in the quarter. Mavericks: Dallas made everything look easy when they were shooting 9 for 13 from 3-point range in the first quarter but they had some droughts when Irving wasn't on the floor. The Mavericks had just one point in the first 5:15 of the fourth quarter and the Jazz cut it to 87-82. Jazz: Utah played with energy but couldn't shoot, even when they were able to generate open looks. The Jazz shot 35.8% from the field and only had 20 assists. After watching the Jazz claw within five points while he was resting, Irving made a 3-pointer, then stole the ball and assisted Grimes for a layup to make it 92-82 with 6:19 to play. Grimes was 5 for 6 on 3-point shots but 0 for 4 on free throws at one point in the first half. He finally made a free throw in the fourth quarter, finishing 1 for 6 from the line and 9 for 16 from the field with five 3s.

The excitable St. John’s coach whose outlandish sweaters became an emblem of his team’s rousing Final Four run in 1985, died at 99 on Saturday, just a few weeks shy of his 100th birthday. The university said it was notified by a family member that Carnesecca died in a hospital, surrounded by loved ones. St. John's said the Hall of Fame coach “endeared himself to generations of New Yorkers with his wit and warmth.”  Carnesecca was a treasured city sports figure in his day, affection for “Little Looie” never wavering in a bustling town with scant patience for its players, coaches, executives and owners. He coached St. John’s for 24 seasons over two stints — making a postseason tournament each year — and became the face of a university whose campus arena in Queens would eventually carry his name. A statue of him was unveiled before the 2021-22 season. When asked once in a question-and-answer session with the school to describe St. John’s, Carnesecca said: “home.” It was home where he coached St. John’s to 18 seasons of at least 20 wins, and 18 NCAA Tournament appearances. It was home where he finished with a 526-200 record and had 30-win seasons in 1985 and 1986. And it was home where St. John’s became a charter member of the Big East Conference and a pillar of its success. He was the coach of the year three times in a league that began play in 1979 and quickly asserted itself as one of the nation’s best. Among his star players during those early Big East years were Chris Mullin, Mark Jackson and Walter Berry. Carnesecca coached St. John’s to its fifth NIT title in 1989, although by then the tournament had long been a poor cousin to the NCAAs. He entered the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1992, the year he retired. “I never scored a basket,” he said at his induction, forgoing a sweater for a crisp suit. “The players did everything. Without players, you can’t have a game.” He was an old-school coach, grounded in fundamentals. And through it all, Carnesecca was a swirling, kinetic presence on the sidelines, arms flailing, legs kicking, shirt tails flying, all 5-foot-6 of him curled in exasperation over a missed shot or agonizing call. But his antics never crossed the line into chair-throwing fury. Carnesecca was simply consumed by his players, a love for a game in his marrow, a lifetime spent in schoolyards, beat-up gyms and big-time arenas. He loved the “smell of the sweat” and the “feel of rubber burning” when sneakers met a varnished floor. He remained the consummate gentleman in a sport populated by outsized egos, fierce recruiting wars and a relentless pursuit of the next contract. Mike Tranghese, a former Big East commissioner, once called him “our soul and our conscience” and “one of the giants of the game.” Carnesecca guided St. John's to Big East Tournament titles in 1983 and 1986. His teams reached the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament in 1979 and 1991, and spent more than 70 weeks ranked in the top 10 of the AP Top 25. A banner denoting his 526 wins at St. John's hangs from the rafters at Madison Square Garden.  He coached more than 40 NBA draft picks, with Mullin, Jackson and Malik Sealy among 11 who were selected in the first round.  Despite all that, Carnesecca never took himself too famously. He always believed a rough loss should never get in the way of a glass of Chianti and fettuccini with a Bolognese sauce. He held clinics all over the world, making friends, offering toasts wherever he went. He was there with a kind word as well as a wisecrack in his breathy, raspy voice. His family tree may have gone back to Tuscany, but he could hold his own with the best of Borscht Belt comics. “I don’t know if there’s anybody else in coaching like him,” longtime UConn coach Jim Calhoun once told the Hartford Courant. “Even if people hate the Big East nobody hates Looie. If you like basketball, you like Looie. If you like kids, you like Looie.” Luigi P. Carnesecca was born on Jan. 5, 1925, the son of Italian immigrants. He grew up in Manhattan, in East Harlem, living above the grocery store and deli owned by his father. He took his heritage seriously, rooting for such New York Yankees as Tony Lazzeri and Joe DiMaggio. After a stretch in the Coast Guard during World War II, he became the coach at his high school — now the longtime basketball power Archbishop Molloy. In 1958, he took an assistant’s job at St. John’s, his alma mater, where he had played baseball on a team that reached the 1949 College World Series, but not varsity basketball. He worked for eight seasons under Joe Lapchick, the lessons about humility and hard work from the Hall of Fame coach lasting a lifetime. Carnesecca would later pass along to Mullin some advice he got from Lapchick: “A peacock today, a feather duster tomorrow.” “I learned more when Coach Lapchick cleared his throat than I could have at any clinic,” Carnesecca said. He succeeded Lapchick in 1965, the 20-win seasons piling up quickly. But after five years, Carnesecca was not immune to the siren song of the pros. He coached the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association for three years, Rick Barry among his players. Years later, during a 1982-83 season in which his St. John’s team would finish 28-5, Carnesecca reflected on the pressure of college coaching and his time in the ABA. “I lost 50 games coaching professionally — that was pressure,” he said. “I didn’t feel like getting out of bed. My mother could coach this team.” His stay in the pros didn’t last long. Carnesecca knew that was not his natural habitat. He said he could give the same halftime speech only so many times. He returned to St. John’s in 1973. Winning seasons followed in quick succession even though his city was no longer the recruiting magnet of generations past. Top high school players migrated south and west to campuses with gleaming arenas and didn’t need the commercial pull of New York to burnish their brand. When asked why he didn’t expand his base in his search of players and venture beyond his city’s five boroughs, Carnesecca knew he had plenty of talent in his neighborhood. He took a subway token — now a relic from bygone generations — out of his pocket. “That’s my recruiting budget,” he said. By the 1984-85 season, Carnesecca and St. John’s captivated New York, a throwback to a time when schools like City College and NYU mattered not only in the Big Apple but across college basketball. The Redmen — their nickname years later changed to the Red Storm — played tough, pulsating games at a packed Madison Square Garden against Syracuse teams coached by Jim Boeheim, Villanova teams coached by Rollie Massimino and Georgetown teams coached by John Thompson and led by Patrick Ewing. It was then the saga of The Sweater took hold. Over the years, Carnesecca would recount his baffling entry into the world of fashion time and again like an embellished family tale. Essentially, St. John’s was getting ready for a road trip to Pittsburgh in January and Carnesecca was under the weather. The building would be drafty, and his wife thought it would be good if he wore a sweater. He found one that had been given to him by an Italian basketball coach. It was a brown pullover with broad turquoise stripes. It never made it into the pages of GQ. “It is ugly, isn’t it?” Carnesecca said. No matter. Mullin hit a winning shot at the buzzer, and the coach had his lucky charm. He stuck with the sweater. Along the way, St. John’s ended Georgetown’s 29-game winning streak and soared to a No. 1 ranking. But there were also two lopsided losses to Georgetown during the 16-2 run with the sweater — one when a grinning Thompson upstaged his popular rival by wearing a duplicate onto the court at a buzzing Madison Square Garden in what became known as “The Sweater Game,” which drew a massive television audience in February 1985.  His luck exhausted, Carnesecca eventually put the pullover away. He then went with a tan, snowflake number for the NCAA Tournament. St. John’s defeated Southern, Arkansas and Kentucky before a victory over North Carolina State in the West Regional final sent Carnesecca to the Final Four. “When I’m going to my grave,” he said, “this I’ll remember.” St. John’s headed to Lexington, Kentucky, along with two Big East compatriots — Georgetown and Villanova — and Memphis. St. John’s stuck with Georgetown in the semifinals, down 32-28 at halftime. But the Hoyas pulled away to win 77-59, holding Mullin to eight points. “I think we tried everything,” Carnesecca said of Georgetown, which then got upset by Villanova in one of the sport’s great championship games. After he retired, Carnesecca was succeeded by a parade of coaches at St. John’s, Mullin among them. Even into his 90s, some three decades out of coaching, Carnesecca would make his way to The Garden when the Red Storm were there. His gait may have been tentative but his mind and wit nimble, the crowd roaring when the jumbo screen panned in on him. The coach was at home. “It’s going to be very difficult to put the ball down, but the time has come,” he said at his retirement when he was 67. “There are two reasons, really. I still have half of my marbles and I still have a wonderful taste in my mouth about basketball.” The school said Carnesecca leaves behind his wife of 73 years, Mary, as well as daughter Enes and son-in-law Gerard, a granddaughter, and a niece and nephew in addition to extended family. ___ A previous version of this story corrected Carnesecca’s record at St. John’s. ___ Fred Lief, a retired Associated Press sports writer, was the principal writer of this obituary.

NYT > Sports,Why Losing to Michigan Left Ohio State’s Coach in an Emotionless Daze,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5959638/2024/12/01/ohio-state-will-howard-kyle-mccord-final-thoughts/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 15:56:05 +0000","Ryan Day’s Buckeyes were humiliated by the Wolverines. It’s hard to imagine him returning next season, a columnist for The Athletic writes.","NCAAF And now, 20 Final Thoughts from college football’s Rivalry Weekend, where many of the teams fought for 60 minutes, and then fought some more. 1. On his weekly coach’s show last Monday, Ohio State coach Ryan Day described his team’s losing streak to Michigan in stark terms. “It’s one of the worst things that’s ever happened to me in my life, quite honestly, other than losing my father (at age 9) and a few other things,” he said. “And for my family, (it’s) the worst thing that’s happened. So, we can never have that happen again. Ever.” Advertisement It happened again, and this one was so much worse than those past three losses to top-five Michigan teams. This year’s Wolverines were 6-5 and three-touchdown underdogs, yet they still came to the Horseshoe and humiliated the second-ranked Buckeyes 13-10 in a mistake-strewn game. It ended with Michigan players attempting to plant their flag at midfield, fights breaking out, the police pepper spraying guys on both teams. Which Day watched unfold in front of him in an emotionless daze. Also, Ryan Day, your whole team is in the midst of a brawl, and you’re on the sideline asking “what happened?” Huh!? Get your butt on the field and command your players go to the locker room.   pic.twitter.com/fjiZGNmIfW — Emmanuel Acho (@EmmanuelAcho) November 30, 2024  Whether by his own choice or his employer’s, it’s hard to imagine Day will be back in Columbus next season to try again, given the anguish he says the Michigan losses have caused him and his family. Perhaps he will take a cue from John Calipari, who read the room after Kentucky basketball’s unthinkable NCAA Tournament loss to Oakland last March and hatched his own exit plan to Arkansas. 2. The loss knocked Day’s team out of next week’s Big Ten Championship Game, which will now pit No. 1 Oregon (12-0, 9-0 Big Ten) and No. 4 Penn State (11-1, 8-1). The Buckeyes (10-2, 7-2) will likely fall to No. 7 or No. 8, still safely in the 12-team Playoff field, but their berth will come with a pall hanging over the program. Ohio State has not lived up to the expectations that came with its $20 million roster. Held back by an injury-ravaged offensive line, the Buckeyes couldn’t run the ball on Michigan (77 yards on 26 carries), while quarterback Will Howard threw two costly picks and kicker Jayden Fielding missed 38- and 34-yard field goals. The Buckeyes can still achieve their goal of a national championship. But their performance this season does not elicit much confidence they can pull that off. Advertisement 3. Michigan, led by running back Kalel Mullings (32 carries for 116 yards), managed to beat the No. 2 team in the country despite quarterback Davis Warren going just 9 of 16 for 62 yards and two interceptions. It’s arguably the biggest upset in the history of the rivalry, even more so than the famed 1969 Bo-over-Woody game. (Michigan was a 17-point dog in that one.) Coming on the heels of his Bryce Underwood recruiting coup, the win completely changes the story of Sherrone Moore’s first season as head coach. 4. In the three years since Texas accepted an invite to the SEC, coach Steve Sarkisian purposefully built his program along the lines of scrimmage. The third-ranked Longhorns (11-1, 7-1 SEC) flexed both in their 17-7 win over No. 20 Texas A&M (8-4, 5-3) in the rivalry’s long-awaited return after 13 years. Texas’ defense dominated from start to finish, with the Aggies’ only points coming on a pick six. Meanwhile, Texas running back Quintrevion Wisner ground out 186 rushing yards on 33 carries. It’s no secret Texas A&M staunchly opposed allowing its hated nemesis to join the SEC, and now we see why. It took Texas one season to reach the conference championship game, where it gets a rematch with No. 7 Georgia. Whereas A&M, which joined the league in 2012 and has been selling that cachet in recruiting ever since, is yet to make its first trip to Atlanta. GO DEEPER What does the return of Texas-Texas A&M mean? Here's what I saw before, during and after 5. On the same day that Ohio State’s Howard played his worst game of the season, the guy he replaced, Kyle McCord, led Syracuse (9-3, 5-3 ACC) to its biggest win in years, a 42-38 upset of No. 6 Miami (10-2, 6-2 ACC). The loss knocked the Canes out of the ACC Championship Game, which will now be Clemson vs. SMU, and it could possibly cost Miami a CFP berth as well. A vindicated McCord (26 of 36 for 380 yards, three touchdowns, no interceptions) outdueled Heisman candidate Cam Ward (25 of 46, 349 yards, two touchdowns) to lift the Orange to just their third nine-win season this century. Quite the debut for first-time head coach Fran Brown. Advertisement 6. The best guess here is Miami will fall right behind No. 10 Indiana (11-1) and become the last at-large team as of now. The Canes would still likely need No. 9 SMU (11-1) to win next weekend and keep 9-3 Clemson from stealing a bid. You will also hear an 11th-hour lobbying push from the SEC to elevate 9-3 Alabama, which closed with a 28-14 Iron Bowl win over rival Auburn (5-7), above Miami and/or SMU. But this committee seems to care first and foremost about how many games you’ve lost. Not only do the Tide have three of them, two were to a pair of 6-6 teams, Vanderbilt and Oklahoma. Even SEC Network thinks that’s a tough sell. 7. South Carolina quarterback LaNorris Sellers keeps outdoing himself. His 20-yard touchdown run with 1:08 remaining lifted the 15th-ranked Gamecocks (9-3) to a 17-14 win over rival Clemson, their sixth straight win following a 3-3 start. Per Pro Football Focus, Sellers (who finished with 16 carries for 166 yards and two TDs) forced 18 missed tackles, the most by a quarterback since the company began its tracking in 2014. Afterward, South Carolina coach Shane Beamer suggested Sellers should win the Heisman. That’s a stretch, but he’s very good. LaNorris Sellers forced 18 missed tackles against Clemson.  Ashton Jeanty was the only player to have more in a game this season. Most by a QB in a game we’ve ever recorded, dating back to @PFF_College inception in 2014. 171 rushing yards for Sellers, 176 after contact.… — Max Chadwick (@CFBMaxChadwick) December 1, 2024  Beamer also lobbied for a CFP at-large berth, and he has a case. South Carolina now boasts three Top 25 wins (Texas A&M, Missouri and Clemson) and no “bad” losses. But the committee would need to bump the Gamecocks above two 9-3 teams it lost to, Alabama and Ole Miss. Ironically, the team it just beat, Clemson, is win-and-in next week in Charlotte. 8. Georgia and Georgia Tech’s Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate snuck up on Black Friday and delivered an all-time classic. The Jackets (7-5), up 20-6 in the fourth quarter, appeared on the cusp of ending their rival’s 30-game home win streak, thanks to an epic performance from quarterback Haynes King (303 passing yards, 110 rushing yards, five total touchdowns). But Georgia safety Dan Jackson’s game-changing strip-sack of King — which looked to many like targeting — helped the Bulldogs (10-2) come back and eventually win 44-42 in eight(!) overtimes. Kirby Smart praised his team’s “resilience” afterward, but Georgia has no choice to be resilient when it allows 563 yards, the third-most of the Smart era. The Bulldogs now face a Texas team they pummeled 30-15 in Austin on Oct. 19, but don’t assume that result was a precursor for this one. It depends on which of Georgia’s 27 identities this season shows up. GO DEEPER Emerson: Georgia-Georgia Tech a lesson in never hitting publish until it's really over 9. In his first two-plus seasons, Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman earned a stigma for losing games his team had no business losing. But following a Week 2 clunker against Northern Illinois, the fifth-ranked Irish (11-1) rolled off 10 consecutive wins, nearly all of them blowouts. USC (6-6) put up a fight for three-plus quarters Saturday before Notre Dame notched a 99- and 100-yard pick six within minutes of each other to pull away and win 49-35. The Irish, behind Jadarian Price (12 carries, 111 yards, one touchdown) and Jeremiyah Love (13 carries, 99 yards), ran for 258 yards. Notre Dame is a lock to host a first-round CFP game and could even land the No. 5 seed if Penn State takes its second loss in the Big Ten title game. That would set up nicely for Notre Dame, now 31 years removed from its last major postseason win, to finally end that drought. Advertisement 10. Next week will bring the first Big Ten Championship Game that involves no Midwestern schools. No. 1 Oregon (12-0, 9-0 Big Ten) clinched its berth two weeks ago but added a 49-21 rout of rival Washington (6-6, 4-5) as the cherry on top. The door opened for No. 4 Penn State (11-1, 8-1) when Ohio State lost, and the Nittany Lions stormed through it with a 44-7 rout of Maryland (4-8, 1-8). It was another dazzling day for Penn State tight end Tyler Warren, who had six catches for 68 yards, three carries for 32 yards and a 9-yard pass. James Franklin returns to Indianapolis for the first time since winning the 2016 Big Ten title. Quite the turn of events since the Nittany Lions lost at home to Ohio State on Nov. 2. GO DEEPER Snyder: Everything Penn State wants is suddenly right here — including a path to No. 1 seed 11. Iowa State has been stacking milestones throughout Matt Campbell’s nine-year tenure, and Saturday brought his most notable yet. The 18th-ranked Cyclones’ 29-21 win over No. 24 Kansas State (8-4, 5-4 Big 12) gave Iowa State its first-ever 10-win season, and now the Cyclones are headed to the Big 12 Championship Game to face Arizona State (10-2, 7-2). Iowa State did it with an on-brand performance, stuffing two fourth downs, notching a safety and blocking a field goal. Should the Cyclones win next week, they’ll end a staggering 112-year conference championship drought. Unfortunately, there was no Playoff with automatic berths in 1912. 12. No. 16 Arizona State has surged from 3-9 in coach Kenny Dillingham’s first season to a conference championship game appearance in Year 2. Running back and soon-to-be All-American Cam Skattebo burst for 177 yards and three touchdowns as the Sun Devils drilled rival Arizona (4-8, 2-7) 49-7. It marked a complete 180 from last year’s Territorial Cup, when ex-coach Jedd Fisch’s Wildcats won 59-23 en route to a 10-3 record. Dillingham has stolen all the thunder in the Valley since Fisch left for Washington, and the buzz will grow only louder if he leads ASU to a conference championship. 13. Colorado (9-3, 7-2 Big 12) mercifully ended Oklahoma State’s (3-9, 0-9 Big 12) nightmare season with a 52-0 beatdown that ABC portrayed as a Heisman coronation for Travis Hunter. The remarkable two-way star notched his fourth interception of the season and caught 10 passes for 116 yards and three touchdowns. Playing at the exact same time, Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty carried 37 times for 226 yards and a score —– his fifth 200-yard game this season — in the Broncos’ (11-1) 34-18 win over Oregon State (5-7). Hunter, the sport’s most unique player in decades, is unquestionably the favorite to hoist the trophy, but Jeanty is himself having a transcendent season (2,288 yards, 28 TDs). And he’ll get one last showcase opportunity in front of likely his biggest audience of the season because … 14. After rising to No. 17 in the CFP rankings, Tulane (9-3, 7-1 AAC) fell 34-24 at home to Memphis on Thursday, ruining its chances of finishing as the highest-ranked Group of 5 champion. The Green Wave will still play for their conference championship on Friday, but they now have to travel to West Point to meet unranked Army (10-1, 8-0). All of which turns Friday’s Mountain West Championship Game between No. 11 Boise State and No. 22 UNLV on the blue turf into a de facto CFP play-in game. Advertisement That’s right. Either Boise State, which had two undefeated teams under Chris Petersen that never got to play for a national championship, or UNLV, until recently one of the most downtrodden programs in the sport, will become the first team to officially clinch an automatic berth. What a time to be alive. 15. No. 10 Indiana (11-1, 8-1 Big Ten) brushed off last week’s Ohio State loss to mangle rival Purdue 66-0, the most lopsided score in the 125-year history of the Old Oaken Bucket. Indiana scored nearly as many points as its opponent gained yards (67). “It was the worst performance offensively that I’ve ever seen,” Boilermakers coach Ryan Walters said of his team, which had previously suffered top-10 losses to Notre Dame (66-7), Oregon (35-0), Ohio State (45-0) and Penn State (49-10). 16. Imagine being a Kansas City Chiefs/Nebraska Cornhuskers fan. It must be bittersweet to root for one team that seemingly can’t lose a close game and another that can’t win one. Nebraska outgained Iowa 334-164, gained 20 first downs to the Hawkeyes’ five … and lost 13-10 after Dylan Raiola fumbled with 22 seconds left and Iowa’s Drew Stevens nailed a walk-off 53-yard field goal. Amazingly, it marked the second straight year, and fourth time in seven seasons, that Iowa (8-4, 6-3 Big Ten) has defeated Nebraska (6-6, 3-6) on a last-second field goal. The Huskers are still going bowling for the first time since 2016, but Matt Rhule’s second season ultimately did not feel much different from the previous seven. 17. It was a no-fun week for Mack Brown. On Tuesday, North Carolina fired its Hall of Fame coach, who had said only a day earlier he intended to return for a seventh season. Then on Saturday, NC State (6-6, 3-5 ACC) drove 75 yards in the final two minutes for a 35-30 win over the Tar Heels (6-6, 3-5), the Wolfpack’s fourth straight win in the rivalry. Afterward, Brown, 73, told reporters he would not coach UNC in a bowl. Presumably, he has coached his last game. In his second stint at the school, the former national champion took the Heels to the 2022 ACC Championship Game but lost at least five games in all but one season. North Carolina AD Bubba Cunningham was justified in opting to start anew. 18. For the first time in the 28-year history of the MAC Championship Game, arch-rivals Ohio (9-3, 7-1 MAC) and Miami of Ohio (8-4, 7-1) will meet for the title. (They were previously in the same division.) The RedHawks, defending league champs, mounted quite a surge after starting the season 1-4, knocking off Bowling Green 28-12 to get back to Detroit. The Bobcats will be making their sixth championship game appearance, still looking for their first win. Their last MAC title came in 1968. Advertisement 19. UConn (8-4) reached eight wins for the first time since 2010 with a 47-42 win at UMass (2-10). Then came a bizarre subplot. A UMass collective recently announced the creation of a new trophy for the rivalry, the Southwick Jug, but that collective, Midnight Ride, is no longer recognized by the university. UConn coach Jim Mora tweeted after the game that “I specifically asked for the trophy at the end of the game and was told point blank you folks weren’t giving it up.” This is 100% false. I specifically asked for the trophy at the end of the game and I was told point blank you folks weren’t giving it up.  @FightMA247 come clean, don’t put this on @UConnFootball or @UConnHuskies https://t.co/0c5xXhR4t7 — Jim Mora (@CoachJimMoraFB) December 1, 2024  UConn racks up all sorts of hardware in basketball. Why won’t anyone let it have one lousy football trophy? 20. Finally, a word about the onslaught of postgame skirmishes that permeated the sport Saturday, from Columbus to Tuscaloosa to Tucson to Tallahassee. No tsk-tsk lecture about sportsmanship here. Over the past 15 years, conferences and their TV partners have killed off some of the sport’s best rivalries in the pursuit of more dollars. Meanwhile, many feared the Playoff would deaden their stakes. Turns out, the coaches and players still really, really care about their rivals — especially those who attempt to plant flags on their home fields.

Week 13: Two Top Running Backs Battle in Eagles-Ravens Clash,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5956880/2024/12/01/nfl-week-13-eagles-ravens-barkley-henry/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 15:56:05 +0000",Saquon Barkley and Derrick Henry meet Sunday in a game that could be a Super Bowl preview.,"NFL Week 13 of the NFL season is in full swing following four games on Thanksgiving and Black Friday. The Detroit Lions survived a thrilling second-half charge by the Bears to win 23-20 and improve to 11-1, a game that proved to be the last for Chicago coach Matt Eberflus, who was fired Friday. The Dallas Cowboys topped the New York Giants 27-20 to string together their first two-game win streak in more than a month. The Green Bay Packers rolled to a 30-17 win over the Miami Dolphins to finish Thursday night. And on Friday, the Kansas City Chiefs survived (again) to beat the Las Vegas Raiders 19-17 and also improve to 11-1. Advertisement Sunday’s slate features seven games in the early time slot, three in the late afternoon and a nightcap between the San Francisco 49ers and Buffalo Bills. The Cleveland Browns and Denver Broncos cap it all off Monday night. Here’s a look at five of the most compelling storylines from the remainder of this weekend’s games. (Find the full Week 13 schedule here.) GO DEEPER NFL Week 13 roundtable: Trevor Lawrence's return, Aaron Rodgers' future, second-year QB surge Russell Wilson’s perfect mark as Steelers starting quarterback ended last week as the Browns handed their AFC North rivals their first loss since Week 5, snapping Pittsburgh’s five-game win streak. Now 8-3, the Steelers cling to a slim division lead over the Baltimore Ravens (8-4). A victory Sunday over the host Cincinnati Bengals would go a long way toward helping the Steelers remain in control of the division. Wilson and the Steelers struggled on a snowy night to capitalize on opportunities against Cleveland. They converted just one of three fourth-down attempts and missed a field goal. The offense ventured into the red zone just twice and came away with only one touchdown. The 19 points scored also represented the second-lowest output of Wilson’s stead as starter. This week, the quarterback and his unit need to figure out how to regain their explosiveness. After averaging 30 points per game in Wilson’s first three starts, the Steelers scored just 18 and 19 points against Baltimore and Cleveland, respectively. Will the Bengals, whose porous defense has given up 26.9 points per game, be the get-right opponent for Pittsburgh? GO DEEPER Some games mean more: The Week 13 matchups that will have biggest impact on playoff odds That problematic defense is one of the biggest reasons Cincinnati, coming off its bye this week, is 4-7 and appears likely to miss the playoffs. Joe Burrow and the offense certainly can score with the best of them (averaging 27 points per game) despite injuries at wide receiver. But an inability to get stops on third down and to generate turnovers has proved costly. Advertisement After Sunday, Pittsburgh (1-1 in the division) has a rematch with Cleveland and games against contenders Philadelphia, Baltimore and Kansas City before a season finale against the Bengals. A loss Sunday could come back to haunt the Steelers. (Steelers at Bengals, 1 p.m. ET Sunday.) Arizona and Seattle — the leaders of the ever-intriguing NFC West — find themselves in high-pressure situations as they jockey for position in this final stretch of the regular season. Both 6-5, the Seahawks and Cardinals have little margin for error. The Seahawks look to extend their win streak to three games Sunday as they take on the hapless New York Jets at MetLife Stadium. Meanwhile, the Cardinals aim to rebound from last week’s loss to Seattle as they go on the road to face a tough Minnesota Vikings team. Seattle appears to have shaken off a midseason slump, earning hard-fought wins over San Francisco and Arizona in the last two weeks. A previously struggling defense held the 49ers and Cardinals to a combined 23 points while also proving stingy on third downs. Can Mike Macdonald’s team continue to build momentum, or is facing the Jets the perfect trap game? Arizona needs a strong rebound from Kyler Murray and an offense that had averaged 26.3 points per game during a four-game win streak, only to muster six points against Seattle. The Cardinals converted only three of 12 third downs and went 0 of 2 in the red zone against the Seahawks. Fending off Minnesota’s aggressive pass rushers will rank high on the Cardinals’ list of priorities, but that’s no easy task, especially for a team that has beaten only one opponent with a record over .500 this season. A win over 9-2 Minnesota could provide much-needed momentum for Arizona. A loss could put the Cardinals in an undesirable position entering next week’s crucial rematch with Seattle. (Seahawks at Jets, Cardinals at Vikings, both at 1 p.m. ET Sunday.) The Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ three-year streak as NFC South champions is in danger of ending. After a strong start to the season, injuries impacted the Buccaneers in late October and early November. A four-game losing streak dropped the Bucs below .500 and behind 6-5 Atlanta in the division standings. The healthy return of wide receiver Mike Evans and a blowout win over the New York Giants last week helped Tampa Bay end the skid, and now it’s trying to mount a charge that will keep its postseason hopes alive. Advertisement The Bucs travel to Charlotte on Sunday, where they face the improved Carolina Panthers . Second-year quarterback Bryce Young and his teammates came close to upsetting Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs last week but now seek their third win in four games. Can Young continue to ascend, or can Todd Bowles’ defense and Baker Mayfield, who had a brief stint with the Panthers in 2022, deal their division foes another setback? A victory would improve Tampa Bay’s record to 6-6 and 2-2 in the division. Before their kickoff, however, the Bucs will root for the Chargers, who can help Tampa Bay’s cause by beating Atlanta in a game that begins at 1 p.m. ET. (Buccaneers at Panthers, 4:05 p.m. ET Sunday.) In a potential Super Bowl preview, the Eagles travel to Baltimore to take on the Ravens. There are many similarities between these teams. Dual-threat quarterbacks Lamar Jackson and Jalen Hurts direct well-rounded units that boast big-play ability, and workhorse backs Derrick Henry and Saquon Barkley are having impressive seasons. Philadelphia’s Barkley and Baltimore’s Henry have led the NFL in rushing for the entire season. Last week, Barkley charged ahead of Henry in his quest for the rushing title. Barkley has rushed for 1,392 yards (first place) while Henry trails narrowly with 1,325. Henry, however, still leads the NFL with 13 rushing touchdowns while Barkley trails with 10. Not to be outdone, Hurts is tied for second in the NFL with 11 rushing touchdowns. GO DEEPER Why a former MVP thinks Saquon Barkley can break the QB-only trend Defensively, Baltimore and Philadelphia both endured offseason change with new coordinator hires and the departures of leading players. The Eagles appear to have rounded into form, holding their last three opponents to 20 points or fewer. The Ravens, meanwhile, have had their bright spots but still seek consistency. Philadelphia is on a hot streak, winning its last seven games to cement itself as the NFC East’s leader and one of the best teams in the conference. Baltimore, meanwhile, remains one of the top teams in the AFC but has work to do to overtake Pittsburgh for the division lead. (Eagles at Ravens, 4:25 p.m. ET Sunday.)  Entering the season, Sunday night’s showdown between Buffalo and San Francisco looked like a possible Super Bowl preview. But the 49ers have encountered calamity of every kind this season, and their quest to return to the Super Bowl is in great jeopardy. Back-to-back losses (versus Seattle, at Green Bay) have the 5-6 49ers in a desperate position as they travel to Buffalo. The injuries that have plagued the 49ers for much of the season reached quarterback Brock Purdy last week. He is on track to start Sunday after a shoulder issue forced him to miss last week’s loss to the Packers but obviously won’t be 100 percent. That will make it tough to match blows with Josh Allen and the Bills, winners of six straight and fresh off their bye, especially with 49ers left tackle Trent Williams out again with a bone bruise in his heel. Left guard Aaron Banks didn’t practice at this week and remains in the concussion protocol. Defensive end Nick Bosa and cornerback Deommodore Lenoir won’t play, either. And there may be snow to contend with as well. A loss Sunday could essentially kill San Francisco’s hopes of a late-season surge and deep playoff march. All four NFC West teams remain separated by only a game, but a San Francisco loss and wins by Seattle and/or Arizona could keep both just beyond the Niners, who are last in the division.

NYT > Sports,An N.B.A. Player Broke Down in Tears on the Bench. It Told a Deeper Story.,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5941499/2024/11/26/jalen-suggs-wendell-carter-jr-magic-friendship/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 15:56:05 +0000","Wendell Carter Jr.’s emotion, and Jalen Suggs’ reaction, was emblematic of what makes the Magic different from other N.B.A. teams.","NBA Over the past four years, the Orlando Magic have been aware of a budding friendship between point guard Jalen Suggs and big man Wendell Carter Jr. “Those two have a great relationship,” forward Paolo Banchero said. “Ever since I’ve got here, they have that best-friend type of thing, where they are always joking, always messing with each other, always showing love for one another. It’s been dope to see.” Advertisement On Nov. 3, in a game at Dallas, the rest of the NBA saw just how deep that bond runs between Suggs and Carter. Overwhelmed with frustration after suffering another injury, Carter broke down in the second quarter and cried on the Orlando bench. He not only cried but sobbed, his chest heaving, his eyes swollen. And there beside him was Suggs, covering his friend’s head with a towel, wrapping an arm around his shoulder to comfort, and whispering advice in his ear. “Just love,” Suggs said. Added Carter: “He’s a guy you want on your team, but even more so, he’s a guy you want as your friend.”  What happened in Dallas went deeper than a friend consoling a buddy who was down. There is history behind the emotions and meaning behind the reaction. The scene on the bench was emblematic of what has made the Orlando Magic perhaps the most different culture in the NBA, one that trumpets caring about one another while stressing mental-health awareness, togetherness and transparency. “We can’t talk about being special if we don’t treat each other special,” coach Jamahl Mosley said. “We can’t talk about being unique and doing something different if we are not unique and different. And what you saw there … that’s who this team is.” The closeness of the Magic, Mosley believes, is part of the reason Orlando is 12-7 despite injuries causing All-Star Banchero to miss the last 14 games and Carter the last 12 (Carter is nearing a return). Sure, it helps that Franz Wagner is the NBA’s biggest breakout star, that Suggs is an All-NBA defender and that second-year guard Anthony Black is becoming a reliable burst off the bench. But inside the Magic locker room, they talk about how their communication, compassion and care form an invaluable intangible. So while the scene in Dallas, with Carter sidelined and distraught, was a setback because the Magic were losing their center who entered the game averaging 10.4 rebounds, it also was empowering because it showed the unspoken power inside this roster. Advertisement Arnie Kander, Orlando’s vice president of player performance and wellness, said he could feel that power at the moment. As he approached the emotional Carter being consoled by Suggs on the bench that night in Dallas, he said his heart swelled. “I remember thinking, the healing is starting … the healing is literally starting right here in this moment,” Kander said. It is fitting the spotlight of relationships between Suggs and Carter comes from a moment of despair, with an injury as the backdrop. The seeds of their friendship were planted while both were injured during Suggs’ rookie season in 2021. With Suggs rehabilitating a thumb injury and Carter sidelined with a hamstring injury, the two spent much of December and January in the training room. They did more than just rehabilitate their bodies. They found a connection that also healed their minds. Suggs said he was spiraling emotionally after his injury. He felt the weight of being the fifth pick and not delivering on expectations. Carter could relate. After a variety of injuries held him back early in his career, the Bulls traded him to Orlando two and half seasons after drafting him seventh in 2018. So as the Magic practiced, Suggs and Carter would be in the training room, working on their bodies and minds. They would talk about their anxieties. Their fears. They talked about solutions. Dreams. And, they talked about their faith in God. “I will always hold our relationship close to my heart because of the time it came,” Suggs said. “It was a really vulnerable time for me … I was just not in a good mental space. I was worried about making it in the league, whether this was for me, if I wanted to be here … I just had a lot of struggles those first two years in terms of finding myself, not only in basketball but as a human. But I knew, every day I got to wake up and go to work and see Wendell. He was a bright spot that I had in my day.” GO DEEPER The Orlando Magic have a superpower, and it's love (for each other) Suggs found that Carter was a great listener, and always chose the right advice and the right time to deliver it. Carter found that Suggs, who is two years younger, was exceptionally grounded for his age, and he liked that Suggs was more drawn to family and faith than money, fame and cars. “At the end of the day, this is a job, and having someone you can talk to, relate to, it makes coming to work easy,’’ Carter said. “It’s special to have that.” Advertisement Added Suggs: “I think the best part about Wendell is that we can go from laughing and joking to having a really intimate conversation about life, hardships and the obstacles we’re each facing. And it’s really authentic. It’s not him sharing clichés. I can tell he is listening to me. “So in my time of need, he was there for me,” Suggs said. “And when people are there for you, it means a lot.” In Dallas, it was time to reciprocate.  It was midway through the second quarter in Dallas on Nov. 3 when Carter leaped to deflect a lob pass at the rim. When he landed, he instantly felt pain, like a thousand pins piercing his foot. He knew immediately it was a case of plantar fasciitis. It was a particularly deflating development because Carter had worked so hard to squash the injury bug that had defined his first six NBA seasons. With injuries to his knees, feet, eye, back, hand, hip and hamstring, Carter has missed more than one-third of his games over his career because of injury. “I’ve been battling injury my whole career, and most of it is stuff I can’t control,” he said. “It was frustrating because I went into that game already banged up (knee soreness) …and when it happened, I knew exactly what it was.” Incidentally, on the play Carter was injured, Suggs soared behind him and made a spectacular block of Daniel Gafford, who had caught the lob pass over Carter and was attempting to dunk. Suggs was substituted out of the game after the play, but as he took a seat on the bench, he noticed Carter was limping heavily. “He wasn’t moving well … I could tell something wasn’t right,” Suggs said. “But because the way Wendell is, he doesn’t want to show weakness on the court, he won’t let you know he is hurting. But seeing his movements, he didn’t look comfortable.” Carter played for another minute, but Suggs couldn’t take it anymore. He went to Mosley on the sideline and urged him to take Carter out. Advertisement As Carter limped to the sideline, he knew his injury was serious. All of his hard work over the summer, all of his goals … they were washed out, flooded by the pain. As he looked for a seat on the bench his mind was reeling. “I was getting super emotional … like, not again,” Carter said. “One of my goals was to play all 82 (games), and to be stopped so early in the season was frustrating.” By the time he plopped on the bench, his emotions were winning. Suggs could tell by Carter’s face that he was about to cry. So he got a towel and covered his friend’s head to give him some privacy as his body heaved and his tears flowed. “I’m glad he cried, glad he let out tears,” Suggs said. “I think it’s important to have those moments. In those moments you know you are still human. And it shows he is one with himself. In that space, in front of 17,000 fans, he was still authentically him.” That moment of vulnerability, was in part, fostered by the culture Mosley is forging in Orlando. In the past couple of seasons, Mosley has used a team-building tactic introduced to him by veteran Magic guard Cory Joseph: A player brings in a photograph that means something to him, and he talks to the team about why the person in that photo is special, or why the picture means something to him. “I just think it’s beautiful because it’s helps your ability to get to know the people you are around, beyond the surface level,” Mosley said. “Everyone says, ‘This is my guy … you are my guy …’ but I don’t want that to be lip service.” In conjunction with the photo sessions, Mosley harps to his players about the team being a family, and about the importance of that family communicating when things are awry. “I tell them all the time, if you have something going on, let’s talk about it,” Mosley said. “My door is open, your teammates’ door is open. If it’s enough to put on the table, we’ll put it on the table and talk about it.  We’re human beings, and we all go through things, so why not be able to address it and say, ‘I’m not any less if I address this and say I can’t handle it …” Advertisement Communication is at the center of the team’s push to foster an environment where mental health is not only addressed but also valued. They also do meditation and breathing exercises, all while stressing their mantra: this is bigger than basketball. “We talk about mental health, spiritual health, but I don’t think it gets seen enough,” Kander said. “Because that’s what these guys represent. They’ve been taught to have this bravado, be macho, but strength as we know it is the complete package. It’s about who we are as a human being.” In that vein, Carter said he didn’t hesitate to show his hurt, to express his frustration, and to release his tears, no matter that it was in front of 17,000. Surrounded by his friend, and his team, he felt comfortable. “Coach and the front office has created an environment where we can be like that,” Suggs said. “We can be authentic, exactly who we are and show exactly what we are feeling. It’s such a freeing feeling, honestly. When you can do that, and be that, and not put on any front or facade, it’s comforting. You can just be yourself, be a human being and know that the man next to you will take care of you in those moments.” As Carter sobbed on the bench, his face buried in the towel Suggs provided, his friend leaned in and comforted him. “He made it all make sense,” Carter said. It was like they were back in the training room three years ago, confronting their fears, easing their anxieties and leaning on each other. “The main thing in that moment I wanted Wendell to know was that not only is he strong, he is so much more than a basketball player,” Suggs said. “I told him, the things he has done as a human being — not only for myself, but for his family, for the people in Orlando, for his foundation … he’s been amazing.” Every Thanksgiving in Orlando, Carter provides meals for families. This year, he expects to feed 300 families. And for Christmas, he is rewarding standout students at Orlando high schools with iPads and gaming consoles. His foundation also has a program to help inspire students to consider a career in aviation, spawned from his childhood infatuation with flying after a visit to a cockpit. Advertisement “I’ve done about four off-the-court community service events with him,” Mosley said. “He has one of the best hearts of anyone.” As Carter began to regain his composure on the bench, Suggs continued to lean in and speak into his ear. He knew how obsessed Carter had become over the summer working on his body, and how much emphasis he had put on being healthy the entire year. “I told him this is an amazing opportunity to slow down and really center yourself,” Suggs said. “Injuries are such a hard thing. They often cloud your judgment … they make you ask the question why?” Carter said the words began to calm him. “And as he comforted me, he prayed over me,” Carter said. “Then he started talking about our faith, a lot of spirituality stuff, and it made me look at it differently in that moment.” Said Suggs: “I told him it’s hard to see God’s plan in the moment. And while you feel heavy in the moment, you are going to look back at this time and you are going to realize God was teaching you the whole time. It really turns into a beautiful thing when the process is over. So I just told him that. You are going to see what He is teaching, you are just going to have to trust Him.” Three games later, the roles were reversed. Suggs was ailing, and Carter was there for him. When the Magic returned home, they faced New Orleans. Suggs felt off. He was exhausted, sluggish, and his mind wasn’t moving as fast as the action on the court. During a timeout, Suggs was on the back edge of the huddle and Carter approached. “He was like, ‘Hey bro? You OK?’” Suggs said, lowering his voice to mimic Carter. “It may seem like a subtle thing, that question, but because Wendell and I have that relationship, we can really have a conversation.” As Mosley talked X’s and O’s inside the huddle, Suggs and Carter were on the outskirts, talking about Suggs’ headspace. Advertisement “I told him exactly what I was going through,” Suggs said. “I told him, ‘No, I’m not OK. I’m tired. My energy is low. My spirit is down, and I’m not exactly sure what to do. It feels like a time when I’m not really in control.’” Carter flipped the advice Suggs gave him in Dallas back at him. He told him to take the time to figure it out, that not everything has to be accomplished at this moment. He told him that the team knows who he is as a player, and that he didn’t have to do everything himself. They were all here for him. Even though Suggs had a subpar game against the Pelicans with seven points, six assists and five turnovers, the Magic won 115-88. “Instead of trying to answer questions from within and battling my own mind, I was able to release them to Wendell and put those feelings on his shoulders a bit and get some insight and love,” Suggs said. “Just to have that release … that’s really comfortable.” On a recent trip to Los Angeles, Suggs and Carter continued their rivalry of playing online games. Their favorites are Connect Four and Mancala. On this day, Carter delivered three consecutive beatdowns in Mancala, prompting him to text Suggs a dancing Hulk emoji. “That wasn’t funny,” Suggs deadpanned. “I know he got a great laugh out of that, but I was not laughing. Three straight L’s. I needed time to simmer down after that.” By nightfall, Suggs had cooled, and the two went to watch the horror/suspense film “Heretic.” “Verrrrry interesting, I will just say that,” Carter said of the movie. The next morning, as the team met to go over the game plan against the Clippers, assistant coach Dale Osbourne was giving his report when he used a phrase that Suggs and Carter found humorous. “I’m looking straight ahead, and I can feel Jalen’s presence,” Carter said. “I turned and looked and he’s just staring at me. We both started laughing.” Advertisement Around the Magic, one thing is almost certain: If Carter is laughing, then almost assuredly, so is Suggs. “You know how you have those people when you look at them, you just want to laugh?” Suggs said. “Wendell is one of those people. And he has one of the funniest laughs I’ve ever heard. It’s high-pitched and his whole face cracks up … so when he laughs, I laugh, and that energy just feeds off each other.” Their friendship rolls on, one laugh at a time, one crisis at a time, one moment a time. Along the way, they are unafraid to confront their fears and be themselves, knowing that they have someone who will be there for them if they waver. “Those two for sure have a very special, unique relationship,” Kander said. “Both guys are soul-searchers, they want to dig a little deeper.” Perhaps that is why Carter recalls fondly a set of 30 cards that Kander has players blindly select each day. The cards have symbolic/spiritual sayings … something along the thoughts of the day. On the night he was injured in Dallas, Carter selected his card. It read: “I’m safe.” (Top photo of Jalen Suggs and Wendell Carter Jr.: Benny Sieu / USA Today) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

This happened to Alabama in 2017 after losing the Iron Bowl and to Ohio State after it lost to Michigan in 2022. That was the same season TCU of the Big 12 became the first team to lose its conference championship game (to Kansas State) and still get in. In all those cases, that loss was the team’s only loss. Advertisement Now with a 12-team CFP, backing into the Playoff has a whole new meaning. Looking at you, Ohio State (10-2). Miami (10-2), too. What we learned about the College Football Playoff in the last full weekend of the regular season is we have a pretty good idea of who will be in the College Football Playoff heading into championship weekend. GO DEEPER College Football Playoff 2024 projections: What now for Ohio State after Michigan upset? No. 2 Ohio State’s faceplant against Michigan opened the door for No. 4 Penn State to reach the Big Ten Championship Game against No. 1 Oregon. Side note: Congratulations to the Ducks (12-0) for being the only FBS team to get through 12 games unscathed. The matchup is set 🦁🦆 Early thoughts on who will win the B1G title game?#B1GFootball pic.twitter.com/F5josIsL2T — Big Ten Football (@B1Gfootball) November 30, 2024  The Nittany Lions (11-1) and Ducks look to be safely into the bracket, with the winner getting a bye. Worst case for the Ducks is hosting a first-round game. Penn State could fall all the way out of a hosting spot, depending on how other championship games work out. The SEC has a similar situation with No. 7 Georgia (10-2) facing No. 3 Texas (11-1), which clinched a spot after beating rival Texas A&M. We doubt the committee will punish Georgia for reaching the championship game, though it would be in the Bulldogs’ best interest to not get blown out by the Longhorns. GEORGIA. TEXAS. THE REMATCH FOR A TITLE. 🏆#SECChampionship pic.twitter.com/xpIiXZ65Rk — Southeastern Conference (@SEC) December 1, 2024  Coming off that great escape against Georgia Tech on Friday night in eight OTs, Georgia doesn’t want to give the selection committee any reason to reconsider Alabama or Mississippi, both of which beat the Bulldogs. A wild Big 12 race ended somewhat routinely. All the favorites won this weekend, putting No. 18 Iowa State (10-2) and No. 16 Arizona State (10-2) in the conference title game. We’ll see what the penultimate rankings say Tuesday, but the committee has not been overly kind to the Big 12, which means only the winner will make the field as one of the five highest-ranked conference champions.

The American Athletic Conference will argue for Army (10-1) if it beats Tulane in that title game, but the Cadets failed their Notre Dame test badly and played one of the weakest schedules in the country. 🏈 Highlights from UNLV's 38-14 win over Nevada!#MWFB | #BEaREBEL | #MWPathToThePlayoff pic.twitter.com/gUUX1K6wBB — Mountain West (@MountainWest) December 1, 2024  An interesting race has developed between the Mountain West and Big 12 for the No. 4 seed and bye. Ashton Jeanty and the Broncos (11-1) have held that spot in the last two rankings, comfortably ahead of the highest-ranked Big 12 team. How much the Big 12 can close the gap — if at all — is something to watch Tuesday. Advertisement The Broncos beat Oregon State 34-18 on Friday. On Saturday, Iowa State knocked off No. 24 Kansas State 29-21 and Arizona State thumped Arizona 49-7. UNLV also being ranked — with two victories against Big 12 teams — makes it seem unlikely that the Big 12 title game winner will slingshot past Boise State if the Broncos win. And the Rebels will probably have a good case to make a big leap forward if they win on the Blue Turf. Clemson had a weird day. The Tigers lost 17-14 to rival South Carolina, with Cade Klubnik throwing a brutal interception in the waning moments when Clemson (9-3) was in position to tie it with a short field goal. South Carolina holds off Clemson for its sixth-straight win‼️ pic.twitter.com/UOTr9dGWAv — ESPN College Football (@ESPNCFB) November 30, 2024  But the Tigers did get the help they needed to earn a spot in the ACC Championship Game when Syracuse rallied from 21-0 down in the first half to beat No. 6 Miami 42-38. “Hey, Dabo Swinney, congrats. I got you in, baby!” Orange coach Fran Brown said. The Tigers will face No. 9 SMU (11-1). The Mustangs appear safely in the field no matter what happens in Charlotte, N.C. Win the conference, earn a bye. Easy. Clemson has no path with a loss but shouldn’t have a problem being one of the five highest-ranked conference champions if it wins the ACC. Whether that’s good enough to get a top-four seed and a bye is iffy. But if Clemson is in along with SMU, then another team looking good for an at-large spot right now is getting bumped. Ohio State’s latest loss to Michigan was the worst one yet during this four-game skid in The Game. Still, the second-ranked Buckeyes (10-2) are in a group that looks safely into the bracket even though they won’t play championship weekend. No. 5 Notre Dame (11-1) closed the season with 10 straight victories. The Fighting Irish can’t earn a bye because they’re not in a conference but should have no trouble getting the first-round home game that they have been pointing toward since the end of last season. Advertisement Whether the Irish are seeded No. 5, 6 or 7 will be determined by the conference title games. No. 8 Tennessee (10-2) wiped out an early deficit and beat Vanderbilt 36-23 on Saturday, giving the Volunteers a fairly stress-free week of waiting to find out if they will go on the road or host a first-round game. As for the Buckeyes, being in position to back into the Playoff seemed to be no consolation for losing to Michigan again. “I’m not there right now, quite honestly,” Buckeyes coach Ryan Day said when asked about resetting for a possible playoff run. “Still trying to digest everything that just happened, and I got a locker room full of guys who are just devastated.” GO DEEPER Meet 2024 Ohio State, the unhappiest Playoff team in college football history As we said, if Clemson wins somebody is getting bumped. Who will be that someone? How about Miami? The Hurricanes already handed the Tigers their spot in the ACC title game. The Canes had several great escapes early in the season but closed the year losing two of four. On the bright side, losing one-score games to Georgia Tech (7-5) with Haynes King and at Syracuse (9-3) is nothing to be ashamed of. The Canes don’t have a bunch of wins against highly ranked teams, but the resume looks better than expected with Tech, Louisville (8-4), Duke (9-3) and Florida (7-5) all closing well. “This team won 10 football games against some really good teams,” Miami coach Mario Cristobal told reporters after the loss to Syracuse. What about Indiana? This committee seems unlikely to turn away an 11-1 team, with its only loss at Ohio State, but the fact remains that outside of the Buckeyes, the only team the Hoosiers played that finished above .500 was Michigan (7-5). Hey, Ohio State couldn’t beat the Wolverines at home and Indiana did. So that’s something. Both the Hoosiers and Hurricanes should become big SMU fans. Advertisement The committee hasn’t shown much interest in giving these three-loss SEC teams the benefit of a doubt, but the company line is every week the group starts with a blank sheet of paper, so we should be open-minded to a big shift. The hot team is No. 15 South Carolina, which closed the season with six straight victories. “If the committee’s job is to pick the 12 best teams, you tell me?” South Carolina coach Shane Beamer said. Ironically, South Carolina’s case gets even better if Clemson wins the ACC, but Clemson winning the ACC also clutters the list of at-large teams by adding SMU. The other issue South Carolina has is losses to the two teams ranked directly ahead of it: No. 13 Alabama and No. 14 Mississippi. “Well, I think everyone’s aware of our schedule, and I don’t know the exact stats, but I know we beat four Top-25 teams throughout the year. And I don’t know how many, if anyone, has done that,” Crimson Tide coach Kalen DeBoer said. It’s actually three since LSU dropped out. Still, victories against Georgia, Missouri and South Carolina are nice. Those losses to Oklahoma and Vanderbilt? Both finished 6-6. Surely, SEC commissioner Greg Sankey will have something to say about it, but his opinion doesn’t count. (Photo of South Carolina’s LaNorris Sellers running the ball against Clemson’s T.J.

NYT > Sports,"When Brain Cancer Struck a Baseball Family, a ‘Village’ Provided Shelter",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5947027/2024/11/26/ned-rice-phillies-family-brain-cancer/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 15:56:05 +0000","One year ago, the daughter of an M.L.B. executive received a diagnosis that changed her family members’ lives.","MLB Ten months ago when the nights were longest, Ned Rice emailed total strangers to share his family’s unthinkable dilemma. These were doctors across the country who had not met and did not treat his 3-year-old daughter. Wynnie had brain cancer. This was how Rice, a Phillies assistant general manager, coped. Advertisement He had to gather as much information as he could. “I have still to this day never googled medulloblastoma,” said Cary Rice, his wife. “Because I can’t handle it. And I’m an analytical thinker, too. But if it’s too emotional, I can’t do it.” Everything about this felt impossible. Wynnie had lost her balance a few times — and now her parents faced a sudden and critical decision. Doctors at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) told the Rices they could not treat Wynnie with radiation; she was too young. The neurocognitive damage from radiation would prevent her from having an independent adult life. But her chances of survival were better with radiation. Ned Rice sought a second opinion from another leading children’s hospital. They told him it would be reckless not to use the treatment known to be the best — radiation — no matter the long-term effects. Rice had negotiated player contracts worth hundreds of millions — a high-stakes process that blends objective valuations with a subjective hand. But this was so different. It was a parent’s worst nightmare. Then Rice saw an email. A neuro-oncologist at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital named Richard Graham sent a lengthy reply to one of Rice’s cold calls. “I was really panicking,” Rice said. “He doesn’t even know who I am. He has his own patients and his own life.” Graham shared his advice. He became a frequent resource for Rice. These small, thoughtful moments accumulated. An unexpected gift at the doorstep. A video from Wynnie’s classmates. More responses from out-of-town doctors who would never meet Wynnie. Family members and friends who dropped everything to care for her two siblings. More gifts. Nurses who did not just look after Wynnie — but her parents, too. “It hits you over and over again,” Rice said. “There’s so many people that want to help. Everybody does it in their own way.” Advertisement Rice called his former boss. These weren’t like the late-night talks Matt Klentak and he often had while they ran baseball operations for the Phillies. But it felt normal, even though Klentak worked for the Milwaukee Brewers and Rice was on leave from the Phillies. The phone calls were cathartic. They could dive right into whatever was on Rice’s mind because Klentak knew the latest on Wynnie through an Instagram account the Rices created to chronicle her fight against cancer. It’s grown to more than 700 followers. Friends of friends of friends now reply to posts with, “Go Wynnie go!” The account is a raw look into life with pediatric cancer. It’s become a way for Ned and Cary to express complicated feelings. More than anything, it’s opened a door. “Caregiver burnout is a common phenomenon,” said Jane Minturn, Wynnie’s neuro-oncologist at CHOP, “and (Ned and Cary) have worked together to limit this.” Wynnie knows she is sick, but she does not understand what brain cancer is. The burden is shared by everyone around her. It is immense. Klentak could sense it, at times, during those late-night conversations. It is isolating. But Rice started to carry the goodness of those who had entered Wynnie’s universe. “I couldn’t really relate to what he was going through,” Klentak said. “And I think very few people could. But that doesn’t stop people from wanting to help.” The first sign of distress wasn’t alarming. Wynnie was a happy and healthy 3-year-old learning to move faster. That meant an occasional stumble. But Ned and Cary noticed their daughter’s balance wasn’t improving; it looked a fraction worse every week. They scheduled an appointment last December with their pediatrician. He threw cotton balls across the room to Wynnie, who was content to play the game. She had to bend over and fetch them. She wobbled. The pediatrician agreed something seemed off. He wanted her to see a neurologist at CHOP. The next appointment wasn’t for five months. He suggested the Rices go to the CHOP emergency room — not because it was urgent, but to assuage any immediate concerns. Advertisement They took Wynnie on Dec. 21, 2023. “Sure enough,” Rice said, “we had five neurologists in our room in a few minutes.” Wynnie didn’t have any other symptoms. The doctors scheduled an MRI in three weeks. It could be a muscular disease. Maybe it was vertigo. The Rices visited family for Christmas and Wynnie vomited twice. CHOP rescheduled the MRI for Dec. 29 and, that morning, Wynnie threw up again. She stumbled a few more times. A doctor summoned Ned and Cary during the MRI. He pointed to a screen. There was a large tumor in Wynnie’s brain. Wynnie was sedated for the MRI. The doctors wanted to do immediate surgery to remove the tumor. It was 4 p.m. on the Friday of a holiday weekend. The procedure lasted four hours; it would take a week to know whether the tumor was cancerous. Everything had spiraled so fast. “It’s a long process, but that was definitely a low point,” Rice said. “Those first few days — you took a mostly happy, healthy, sweet girl in for an outpatient MRI. She wakes up and you’re just like, ‘Will we ever see that girl again?’ That was really hard.” Then Wynnie was diagnosed with medulloblastoma. During that first trip to the E.R., before everything escalated, Rice was on the phone with Dave Dombrowski. Yoshinobu Yamamoto’s camp had instructed teams to make their last and best offers for the star free agent. Dombrowski communicated the number to Rice, who relayed it to Joel Wolfe, Yamamoto’s agent. Yamamoto signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers that night. Rice did not mention where he was. The day Wynnie underwent surgery, Rice called Phillies general manager Sam Fuld. He told him what was happening. Dombrowski was out of the country for a rare vacation; Rice talked to the Phillies’ president of baseball operations soon after New Year’s. “We’ll see you when it’s over,” Dombrowski told him. “Take everything you need. We’ll completely cover it. Don’t worry about anything.” Advertisement John Middleton called a few hours later. The Phillies’ principal owner offered to connect the family with doctors. Cary is a lawyer and her firm, Hangley Aronchick Segal Pudlin & Schiller, told her to take as much time as she needed. The Rices were fortunate; they had the means to pay for treatment and ample time to direct attention toward Wynnie. Acquaintances offered to help with whatever the family needed, but what they needed was a cure for cancer. All they wanted was normal. It was an uncomfortable situation that didn’t always have to be uncomfortable. “We just have this wonderful sort of village that kept showing up,” Cary said. “Kept calling. Kept texting. Even when I couldn’t respond. We’re just really grateful for that because we are still the same people. We still want to talk about things and do things that have nothing to do with cancer. We want to feel normal. We want to have hope for a normal future. The worst thing you can do or say is nothing.” Wynnie lived on the third floor at CHOP for almost eight months. The Rices opted against radiation. But her treatment — alternating cycles of chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplants — was so grueling that most of it was inpatient. Ned and Cary would take 24-hour shifts with Wynnie. They were ships passing in the night without much interaction. They found a community inside the hospital. “These nurses, I mean, they’re not just nurses,” Cary said. “They’re therapists. They’re friends. They’re cheerleaders.” Heidi Turner, one of Wynnie’s nurses, worked only overnights. That meant a lot of late-night bonding. Wynnie was discharged Aug. 23. The last night at CHOP, Turner handed Cary a letter to Wynnie. “I’m going to miss you so much,” Cary said to Turner. “We’ll stop by and hopefully I’ll see you.” She stared at Cary. The nurse replied she hoped to never see them again. “And,” Cary said, “it just stuck with me because it’s such a weird feeling to have.” Rice, who has been with the Phillies since 2016, stayed in contact with player agents and rival team executives last offseason but no longer served as the team’s main point of contact. The Phillies had started negotiating Zack Wheeler’s three-year, $126 million extension with B.B. Abbott, Wheeler’s agent at Wasserman. By January, Rice and Abbott had regular talks that started with 30 minutes about Wynnie and progressed to Wheeler’s contract. Advertisement “You’re never what you want to be for these families that are trying to talk about this,” Abbott said. “Because you just can’t be. It’s so all-consuming when you think, ‘My 3-year-old daughter has to go through this.’ It’s hard for parents and families to get their heads around exactly what’s getting ready to happen. The days and nights and hospitals. Watching their little girl lose her hair and be sick. All of this stuff that I knew was getting ready to come.” For years, Abbott has raised awareness for pediatric cancer research through the Rally Foundation and the National Pediatric Cancer Foundation. “I just wanted to be more of a sounding board for him,” Abbott said. The Rices weren’t keeping Wynnie’s illness hidden; it was more of an open secret. Abbott decided to help subtly. He asked Wheeler if he’d lend his name to a fundraiser for the National Pediatric Cancer Foundation near the end of spring training at the Phillies’ complex in Clearwater, Fla. Everyone knew it was for Wynnie, but no one had to say it. Word spread to the team’s front office and support staff. Dozens of Phillies employees had their heads shaved or orange streaks painted in their hair. Players made donations to the foundation. Reliever Matt Strahm’s wife, Megan, organized a present from the Phillies’ wives and girlfriends. “An unbelievable, huge, outrageous gift wagon for Wynnie,” Rice said. He had not met Strahm’s wife until later that summer at the team’s family day. “You’re amazing,” Rice said to her. With Wynnie in the hospital, Rice watched from afar this year as the Phillies sprinted to first place. “The Banatic!” Wynnie said to her dad whenever the furry green mascot appeared on the screen. There are certain rhythms to the baseball season. It is monotonous but contains specific checkpoints. The Rices had none of that with Wynnie. There were no regular updates on her prognosis. They will not know how successful her treatments were until a scan sometime in December. Their focus was singular. Get through today. “Wynnie, she’s something,” Cary said. “She has this tiny little voice and she’s so sweet and gentle with everything she does. We always kind of considered her this little delicate flower. But she’s a beast.” Two weeks ago, Wynnie had a birthday party. The Rices held it outdoors, at a playground by the Schuylkill River Park, because Wynnie’s immune system remains at risk. They had bagels and coffee and a face painter. Cary handed every kid a stuffed fox as a party favor. “Mr. Fox” was Wynnie’s constant companion in the hospital; Cary had so many at the house because people kept sending them when Wynnie would throw up on hers. Advertisement This was a celebration of Wynnie and the village that formed around her. “We were surrounded,” Cary said, “by about 85 of the friends who have been there for us in so many different ways this year.” Wynnie’s hair has started to grow back, although she wore a purple knit cap that covered her head at her party. Everyone could see the three purple flowers painted on her forehead. But Wynnie felt sick near the end of the party. She went to the emergency room with croup. Another challenge. But she was 4 and she was here. She wore her face paint to the E.R. (Top image: Dan Goldfarb / The Athletic. Photos: Ashley Blair Photography)  Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Denigrating them has been an instant firestarter for years, a columnist for The Athletic writes.","NCAAF The most activity Raheem Anderson and Tavierre Dunlap enjoyed Saturday occurred after The Game, when the two teammates joined together to plant their giant Michigan flag in the center of Ohio Stadium. The reaction from Ohio State players was predictable, inciting a type of ugly brawl rarely seen in the 127-year history of this great series. Advertisement If Ohio State and Michigan have been two of the standard bearers across college football for generations, then so they were again this weekend in ways no one should be proud to watch. The Disease of Me, the social media generation of young adults trying to go viral spread to football fields across the country this weekend. Disrespecting an opponent’s logo certainly isn’t new, but to watch at least four of them occur on the same day within hours of each other on rivalry weekend cannot be a coincidence. GO DEEPER College football rivalry weekend heats up with fights, chaotic flag plants The nation watched Anderson and Dunlap plant the Michigan flag after the Wolverines’ stunning 13-10 upset in the biggest of all the rivalry games. Hours later, Arizona State’s Jacob Kongaika, a former Arizona defensive end before transferring, planted the Sun Devils’ spear in the center of Arizona’s logo. Why?

It ended similarly to Ohio State-Michigan with a brawl between the two teams. There was little at stake, other than NC State’s becoming bowl-eligible. Part of the heightened emotions might have been because it was Mack Brown’s final home game at North Carolina, so Tar Heels players did not appreciate the show of disrespect on an important day.

Safety Andrew Mukuba got a few stomps in before Longhorns coach Steve Sarkisian rerouted his players back toward the end zone. And again, police were standing by to protect midfield. There is a simple solution to all of this. The NCAA can fine teams and suspend any players who attempt to denigrate the logo, emblem or property of an opposing team. Advertisement Is it heavy-handed and childish? Perhaps. But so are the actions that led us here. There certainly have been other moments similar to this in the Ohio State-Michigan series — Ohio State players tore down Michigan’s banner in 1973, David Boston and Charles Woodson scuffled on the opening series in 1997 — but none of the previous incidents involved police and pepper spray. Talk about being heavy-handed. Police on the field began spraying players from both teams as things escalated, a wild overreaction and unnecessary use of force. Next time, let the coaches handle it. Coaches have been breaking up fights between teams for decades. Ohio State police issued a statement confirming officers from Ohio and Michigan deployed pepper spray against the players. Just incredible. USA: Brawl Erupts at Michigan-Ohio State Game After Wolverines Defeat OSU and Attempt to Plant Their Flag at Midfield! INSANE VIDEO! pic.twitter.com/7MouiL84ny — News Of The Globe (@NewsOfEarthTr) November 30, 2024  There was a time when former Ohio State coach Jim Tressel spoke frequently about the respect Ohio State and Michigan shared for each other. It was a fierce rivalry, but it was usually clean. Fights and cheap shots were rarely part of it. Until now. The Buckeyes had 60 minutes to fight on the field and chose to wait until after the game to throw their best punch. An embarrassing loss to a mediocre Michigan team Saturday officially stamps OSU coach Ryan Day as the new John Cooper — a good coach and an excellent recruiter who couldn’t beat his biggest rival. It also turned this rivalry to a degree we haven’t witnessed in 30 years. Michigan won the last three games in this series with excellent teams that competed for national championships (and won one). This Wolverines team didn’t have a quarterback capable of throwing for even 100 yards — and it still won the game. Ohio State seniors who returned to school for the expressed purpose of winning this game now depart campus with nothing but a few more college credits. GO DEEPER Ryan Day went all in on beating Michigan — except when it mattered most “For such a great game, you hate to see stuff like that after the game,” Michigan running back Kalel Mullings told the Fox broadcast crew moments after the players were separated. “It’s just bad for the sport, bad for college football. But at the end of the day, some people gotta learn how to lose, man. You can’t be fighting just because you lost the game.” His Wolverines teammates could use a tutorial on how to win, too. ""You hate to see stuff like that after the game. It's just bad for the sport, bad for CFB… They gotta learn how to lose man.

In that moment, maybe he didn’t realize all the problems Anderson and Dunlap created for everybody else. Both are seniors who rarely play outside of special teams. Both are also Academic All-Big Ten selections, but the choice to take the flag to midfield and plant it after already winning the game and dominating this rivalry wasn’t exactly a dean’s list decision. Advertisement There is class in losing. There is class in winning, too. “These guys are looking to put a flag on our field and our guys were not going to let that happen,” Day said. “This is our field and certainly we’re embarrassed at the fact we lost the game, but there’s some prideful guys on this team that weren’t going to just let that happen.” GO DEEPER College Football Playoff 2024 projections: What now for Ohio State? No. 3 seed Boise State? Logos and emblems are sacred across sports. Denigrating them has been an instant firestarter for years. Jackson State and Southern engaged in a similar fight three years ago when Jackson State players planted their flag on Southern’s logo after a win. Michigan linebacker Devin Bush ran to midfield at Michigan State in 2018 and began stomping on the “S” while trying to tear out the turf with his cleats before a rivalry game. Baker Mayfield planted Oklahoma’s giant flag at midfield of Ohio Stadium after a Sooners upset at Ohio State. Buckeyes players were already back in the locker room when Mayfield did it. They were on the field singing the alma mater when Michigan did it Saturday. A healthy level of dislike between teams doesn’t have to be a bad thing. The professional levels have become too sanitized. Only a few genuine rivalries are left, and most are in college sports. But certain actions immediately lead to fights. Flag planting is one of them. “I had said two years ago that (flag planting) was disrespectful,” Brown said on his final night as North Carolina’s coach. “I said all week you need to compete, but you need to do it with composure. So it’s another learning experience. You can’t fight, but you’ve got to win the game.” Sometimes, it’s up to the winners to act with composure, too. Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox.

NYT > Sports,He Left Football For His Mental Health. Now He Returns to His Happy Place.,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5958205/2024/11/30/andrew-luck-stanford-general-manager-football/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 15:56:05 +0000","The former N.F.L. quarterback Andrew Luck is finally back in football. The destination? His alma mater, as Stanford football’s general manager.","By Zak Keefer, Sam Khan Jr. and Lauren Merola Former Stanford star quarterback Andrew Luck is returning to the football program as general manager, the school announced Saturday. Luck will start in his new role immediately, the school said. In the expanded GM position, Luck, 35, will oversee every aspect of the program, both on and off the field. He will work with coach Troy Taylor on recruiting and roster management and with administration on fundraising, alumni relations, sponsorships, student-athlete support and stadium experience, the school said. Advertisement Luck will also be involved in the film room. When asked on “College GameDay” on Saturday morning if he would have a hand in the X’s and O’s, Luck said “absolutely” while acknowledging it’s mainly Taylor’s domain. Luck said he and Taylor are “close,” and that he was on Stanford’s hiring committee when the school brought Taylor on board before the 2023 season. “I imagine this (role) being very hands-on,” Luck said. Ready to build the future of Stanford Football.#GoStanford pic.twitter.com/0F8tTTOBPx — Stanford Football (@StanfordFball) November 30, 2024  While Luck assuming the GM title itself isn’t unique, the scope of his power is. According to ESPN, the entire coaching staff reports to Luck. If he has final say on personnel decisions, that would be a significant evolution in how rosters are currently managed. In virtually every other FBS program, the head coach has the final say on who is signed — or who isn’t. The only other program that approached something akin to an NFL model is Texas Tech, where head coach Joey McGuire allows his general manager James Blanchard to offer scholarships to recruits without his approval and that department is entrusted with the evaluation of recruits and transfers. But McGuire still has the final say. Many power conference programs invest significantly in scouting and personnel departments to manage both high school recruiting and the transfer portal, similar to how NFL teams dedicate staff to college (NFL Draft) and pro (free agency) scouting. Some general managers, like Blanchard, Alabama’s Courtney Morgan, Ohio State’s Mark Pantoni and Clemson’s Jordan Sorrells, make six-figure salaries. But that’s the exception, not the rule — most personnel and recruiting staffers under the GM make five-figure salaries. But GMs, colloquially known as directors of player personnel, have become a must-have position for modern programs. Advertisement The GM role in college football became en vogue in recent years. With the launch of the transfer portal in 2018 and rise of transfers since, the shift to making transfers immediately eligible plus the addition of NIL compensation, roster management has become quite complex. Gone are the days of simply signing 25 high school recruits per year. Now most teams sign a mix of high school recruits and a double-digit number of transfers. Luck’s role also will span far beyond simple roster management, though that’s a key component of it. One aspect that’s unclear: With the coaching staff reporting to Luck, how much influence will he have in hiring and firing decisions? Does that remain the domain of the athletic director and school president? If Luck has significant weight in those decisions, his role more resembles that of an NFL GM. Stanford’s decision to give Luck more power than any other college football GM could foreshadow the sport’s future. With revenue sharing on the way via the House v. NCAA settlement, college football rosters can be managed similarly to the way NFL rosters are: Payrolls will have to be managed. Evolving how players are acquired and teams are built only makes sense. GO DEEPER What to know about House v. NCAA settlement and a historic day for college sports The Cardinal may be on the cutting edge of college football program management and installing someone like Luck, a sharp mind who has a deep football background and is passionate about the school, is a logical first step. “I am a product of this University, of Nerd Nation; I love this place,” Luck said in a statement. “I believe deeply in Stanford’s unique approach to athletics and academics and the opportunity to help drive our program back to the top. Coach Taylor has the team pointed in the right direction, and I cannot wait to work with him, the staff, and the best, brightest, and toughest football players in the world.” Advertisement Stanford has always been Luck’s happy place. It’s where, in four years, he went from nerdy, redshirt freshman to a two-time Heisman runner-up and arguably the best NFL prospect since John Elway. It’s where he met his wife Nicole as an undergrad, and where they settled with their two daughters in 2022 after moving from Indianapolis — where they lived for three years after he stunned the Indianapolis Colts and NFL with his August 2019 retirement. Luck was most recently volunteering as a quarterback coach at Palo Alto High School while pursuing his Master’s degree in education at Stanford. He earned a Bachelor’s degree in architectural design there in 2012. But Luck was looking, since as far back as the early days of his retirement, for his next challenge, unsure of what was next for him. He craves a challenge, and retiring at such a young age — he was just 29 when he walked away from the NFL — left him wandering. He surfed. He skied. He cooked. He read. For a time, he was a stay-at-home dad while Nicole pursued a career in television production. He’d sometimes joke with himself, saying “I can’t be retired at 30. That ain’t right.” So the gig with the Stanford football program — and a unique one at that — fits him and his talents. Along with Jim Plunkett and Elway, Luck is one of the greatest players in program history. In three years with the Cardinal, Luck completed a combined 67 percent of passes for 9,430 yards and 82 touchdowns against 22 interceptions. He added 957 yards and seven scores on the ground en route to a 2022 College Football Hall of Fame induction. Now, Lucks looks to reinstate dominance at Stanford after the program posted four straight 3-9 seasons. “Football gave me a lot,” Luck said last spring. “Most importantly … the relationships and the experiences with people that I love. Part of me feels like it’s my turn to give back to this game.” (Photo: David Madison / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,Meet the College Football Playoff’s Most Unlikely Contender,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5959189/2024/11/30/arizona-state-arizona-cam-skattebo-heisman-big-12/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 15:56:05 +0000",Arizona State was picked to finish last in a 16-team conference. The Sun Devils are one win away from a playoff berth.,"NCAAF TUCSON, Ariz. — The Arizona State Sun Devils gathered at midfield, an enormous mass of maroon and gold celebrating Saturday’s 49-7 win against rival Arizona at Arizona Stadium. Suddenly, Cam Skattebo broke from the pack, lifting the Territorial Cup in his right hand and charging for the stands where Arizona State fans awaited. Advertisement Skattebo had just rushed for 177 yards and three touchdowns, lifting No. 16 Arizona State to its 10th win and a place in the Big 12 Championship Game, an improbable tale for both the bruising running back and the program he represents. Heisman Trophy ballots are sent out on Monday. Like his team, Skattebo began the season as an incredible long shot. Also, like his team, Skattebo has shown he belongs. “He has to be one of the best backs in yards from scrimmage in all of Power 4 football,’’ Arizona State coach Kenny Dillingham said outside the locker room. “How are there many players more impactful than him and what he’s done for this program, picked dead last to playing potentially in the conference championship?” Colorado two-way star Travis Hunter is the favorite for this season’s Heisman, given to college football’s top player. Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty, Miami quarterback Cam Ward and Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel are strong contenders. The top four finalists travel to New York for the Dec. 14 Heisman ceremony. Skattebo has never been to the Big Apple. Has it entered his mind? “I never thought I would be (in this position),” he said. Does he think he deserves to go? “Potentially,’’ Skattebo said. “We got more work to do. But, yeah.” Man of the hour. pic.twitter.com/rSfIoUAH8v — Doug Haller (@DougHaller) December 1, 2024  As Skattebo held up the Territorial Cup, the oldest rivalry trophy in the sport, his teammates gathered around him in the corner of Arizona Stadium. Dillingham told officials to get the players already in the locker room to return to the field. Once they did, Dillingham and the Sun Devils sang the school fight song. After the last word, they took the celebration inside. Skattebo stayed on the field. He looked down the length of the field and noticed Arizona State fans lined the entire way, from one end zone to the other. Skattebo started making his way down, signing autographs, posing for photos and living in the moment. In the locker room, his coaches and teammates celebrated. Skattebo wasn’t concerned. Advertisement “I see those guys every day,’’ he said. “We’ll have our fun later.” Elite players in college football enter the sport in high regard. Hunter was a five-star high school prospect, the top player in his class. Jeanty was a four-star running back. Coming out of Rio Linda High School in California, Skattebo barely registered, a running back who played like a linebacker. Skattebo signed with Sacramento State, the only school that offered him a full scholarship. After two seasons, he transferred to Arizona State. In his first season with the Sun Devils, he rushed for 783 yards and nine touchdowns behind a banged-up line. This season, slimmed down and determined, he’s been among the country’s most improved players, the only back who entered Saturday with 1,000-plus rushing yards and 350-plus receiving yards. “It’s funny because those of us who have watched him grow up — and I talked to his brother last week about it, too — it looks exactly the same,” Skattebo’s high school coach, Jack Garceau, said by phone during Saturday’s game. “It was this way in high school. This way at Sac State. And now it looks this way at ASU. Nothing’s changed. He’s just gotten better and better and better.” Near the stands, Skattebo grabbed a maroon hat and scribbled “Skatt” in black ink. He shuffled to his left, slapping fives, stopping at a blonde-haired boy who asked him to sign his maroon jersey. Skattebo shifted the boy to the side so he could use his shoulder for support. A security guard informed co-workers that Skattebo was still on the field. A photographer informed the running back that his family waited not far down the line. Arizona State achieved bowl eligibility after a Nov. 2 win at Oklahoma State. After that game, Dillingham said the Sun Devils (10-2, 7-2 Big 12) were playing with house money. Quarterback Sam Leavitt said that’s when the expanded College Football Playoff first popped into his mind. Advertisement “Why not us?” he thought. Arizona State hasn’t lost since, winners of five in a row, each win bigger than the last, the most memorable march this program has experienced since the Sun Devils went 11-1 during the 1996 season. Leavitt has developed quicker than expected. The offensive line has stayed healthy. The defense has made plays. “They still surprise me,” Dillingham said. “They’re just a unique, goofy group of misfits that somehow came together and are accomplishing things that are special.” Skattebo has been the engine. Earlier on ESPN’s “College GameDay,” Nick Saban called him his favorite player in college football. “This guy, he’s rugged,” the former Alabama coach said. “Tough. I just love a great competitor. He’s all that.” Skattebo grabbed a cell phone. He held it out as far as his right arm could extend, making sure the fans behind him were in the frame and smiled. He posed in the middle of nine Arizona State cheerleaders. Twenty minutes after the game, Skattebo hugged his family. After a brief conversation, he turned and jogged to the locker room. Fans serenaded him along the way. “Skatt for Heis-man!” “Skatt for Heis-man!” (Photo of Cam Skattebo (left) and Kenny Dillingham: Christopher Hook / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

George Russell (MER) had started on pole alongside Verstappen (RBR), who took the lead on the opening lap and never looked back. Oscar Piastri (MCL) won Saturday’s sprint race from teammate Lando Norris.  Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here GO FURTHER Chaotic F1 Qatar GP ends with Max Verstappen win, sets up season finale showdown Getty Images The Dutch national anthem has been played A LOT over the last four years in Formula One — and you can add another one now. It was notable that in crossing the line, Max Verstappen and his Red Bull race engineer Gianpiero Lambiase (GP) enjoyed pointing out that one-place grid drop ahead of the race.  He’ll love how his start played out and that only one car starting on the front row looked like winning this race.  Advertisement You know what sticks out there?  It’s a brilliant result from Pierre Gasly again, grabbing 10 points for Alpine in P5. He really is backing his talent and ringing a lot out of that car — albeit we didn’t get to see what Esteban Ocon could’ve done with it too, after he was punted out on the opening lap. And then, look at P8. Those are Zhou Guanyu and Sauber’s FIRST points of the year at the 23rd attempt. What a moment for the entire team. Getty Images Here you go. This is the top 10 and where the points-scoring positions went in Lusail and the penultimate round of F1 in 2024: *plus 1 point for fastest lap  The fireworks are flying above Lusail at Verstappen’s win, while Leclerc and Piastri complete the podium. Today’s results mean Red Bull can no longer with the constructors’ championship. As for McLaren’s Lando Norris, he says sorry to his team over the radio for his penalty and the resulting blow to sealing the constructors’ championship. He did at least finish P10 and with the fastest lap, so two more points than it could have been.  Getty Images There is it. Supreme drive from the 2024 world champion, from start to finish. Tough racing, dominant track positioning, and a bit of stirring over the radio too. A typical F1 victory from Max Verstappen. 🔄 55/57: Heartbreak for Bottas? Norris comes piling past to take P10, which also validates his current fastest lap for a bonus point. Magnussen is eight seconds up the road, so this will be as good as it gets for Lando.   Advertisement Getty Images 🔄 54/57: Oh Kevin Magnussen, we’re going to miss you.  It’s an all-timer radio message from him as he picks off Albon for P9. 🔄 53/57: In seeing Hamilton at the back, it’s now noticeable that Norris is back up to P12 — so two places to grab a late point or two.  Zhou Guanyo still running eighth for Sauber, who haven’t grabbed a point all season so far. Teammate Bottas has now taken Albon to grab P10 too! Getty Images 🔄 50/57: Oh boy, what a rank race this has been for Lewis Hamilton. He’s already served a five-second penalty for a jump start. Now he’s given a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane. When he takes that, he asks just to park his Mercedes and end his night there and then. His team has managed to convince him to stay out but now Hamilton is running at the back, P15, and he’s done with this race already. Getty Images 🔄 47/57: That would have felt like an absolute lifetime for Norris in the pits. He asked what the penalty was for as he came into the pits, so clearly had no idea before that. A really rough call on him. Ferrari is now set to actually gain on McLaren in the constructors’ fight and set up a showdown in Abu Dhabi. Getty Images 🔄 47/57: Well, Max Verstappen can claim an assist for that. I’d best keep my thoughts to myself here. Norris needs to take the 10-second penalty as soon as possible, and comes in now to do it. That means the constructors’ championship is going to Abu Dhabi. Ferrari’s eyes will be lighting up.  I sincerely hope no other car did that under those yellows and it wasn’t the radio messages that made that happen.  Norris is now running last of the cars still going.  Advertisement 🔄 45/57: Wow. A 10-second stop and go penalty for Norris for failing to slow for yellow flags.  That’s his race ruined. 🔄 43/57: Time for another restart after the safety car comes in. Verstappen is well clear while Norris is forced to defend Leclerc behind him. Everyone is weaving to get temperature into their cold tires. Getty Images 🔄 42/57: That’s another two cars out. Hulkenberg is in the gravel and Perez is also out after losing drive, reducing the field to 15 cars.  This could be a good chance for some unlikely teams — I’m looking at you, Sauber — to nab a point or two. And uh-oh… Lando Norris has been noted by race control for failing to slow under yellow flags.  Verstappen flagged that on the radio much earlier. Will that result in a penalty? An investigation has been confirmed.  Getty Images 🔄 41/57: Big restart from the safety car as Verstappen goes early, Norris gets the tow and tries to take Max on the outside. Cue Verstappen running as wide as possible and Norris running out of track. Behind all that, Nico Hulkenberg gets beached into the gravel. His race is over. And Sergio Perez too; he loses power and spins before getting out of his car on a run-off. Back out comes the safety car!   Getty Images 🔄 39/57: As the field continues to trail round behind the safety car, here’s the top of the current order: The safety car is in next lap, while Verstappen currently holds the fastest lap. Advertisement 🔄 36/57: And there it is, finally. Safety car in. The likes of Piastri had already come in. This is great news for those who hadn’t stopped so far — a free pit stop effectively. Getty Images 🔄 35/57: Well, that was predictable and feels ridiculous. Valtteri Bottas drives over the wing mirror, while Lewis Hamilton and Carlos Sainz now both have punctures.

Cody Gakpo opened the scoring before Mohamed Salah’s second-half penalty ensured Liverpool moved 11 points clear of the reigning champions. City boss Pep Guardiola was taunted with chants of ‘sacked in the morning’ from a delirious Anfield crowd — and responded by holding up six fingers to signify the six titles he has won with the club.

At the other end, Van Dijk slams the door of a City attack as he puts it out, before he says something presumably unfriendly to Bernardo Silva. Nunez slides in and whips up the crowd, who yell their delight. And... The 'oles' are ringing out now.  Anfield is lapping it up.

The Spaniard smiles wryly in recognition. Then, after a moment's thought, he turns slightly to the crowd and holds up six fingers to represent how many titles he's won at Manchester City. Liverpool have won one in that time. The chants stop quite quickly after that... Getty Images 86' Liverpool 2-0 Manchester City Mo Salah, the Egyptian King, royalty at Anfield, gets a standing ovation as he is taken off by Arne Slot to give him a few minutes' rest. Curtis Jones on in his place. Best player on the park.  He could have had another goal, too! 84' Liverpool 2-0 Manchester City Just as I was praising Virgil van Dijk!

Kevin De Bruyne closes him down, Van Dijk sort of pokes it in a panic but the Belgian controls it and races in on goal, one-on-one, on the angle... Caoimhin Kelleher saves with his legs and dives on the loose ball. The Irishman has saved Van Dijk some serious embarrassment there, and his team a really nervy 10 minutes. De Bruyne should do better... 83' Liverpool 2-0 Manchester City I just love watching Luis Diaz. The Colombian, nicknamed Lucho, protects the ball cleverly and plays it backwards with an entirely needless (but therefore very fun) no-look pass. Cheeky.

All stemmed from Nunez's pressing, they won the ball back high and Ortega sent Diaz flying in the box.

Liverpool are going nine points clear at the top. 81' Liverpool 2-0 Manchester City Salah had a beaming smile on his face after finally scoring, and exchanged words with Erling Haaland in the centre circle before kick-off after his goal. But then, he's angrily jabbing a finger towards Bernardo Silva, who left one on him, really. An ugly swipe brings the foul and a little kick out on Salah's hand after. No yellow, which I think is just about fair enough. Though you can see why Salah is annoyed. The Egyptian is dragged away. Getty Images 80' Liverpool 2-0 Manchester City Pep Guardiola responds to the goal by belatedly bringing on Jack Grealish and Kevin De Bruyne for Rico Lewis and Phil Foden. Bit too late for them to affect the match now. Getty Images 78' Liverpool 2-0 Manchester City Mo Salah! 2-0 and that should be the match! Salah was kicking the ball up calmly before the spot-kick and amid the Manchester City (unwarranted) protests. Loads of grappling going on outside the box but he didn't care. He just focused on his task: scoring. Which he did, with aplomb, rattling it into the bottom-right corner. Stefan Ortega went the right way but it was right in the corner and he couldn't keep it out. Getty Images 76' Liverpool 1-0 Manchester City A massive moment in the match! Ruben Dias is pressed, but instead of passing it back to the goalkeeper, he turns back into danger. Darwin Nunez wins it and slots it to Luis Diaz, cutting in from the left wing. Diaz's first touch is a little heavy but takes him in on goal, Mo Salah (who was offside) moving out of his way. The Colombian takes a touch past Stefan Ortega, who is off his line, dives in and gets none of the ball. Definite penalty. VAR confirms the call. Mo Salah to take...

Darwin Nunez's introduction for Cody Gakpo means that Luis Diaz has moved out to the left.  73' Liverpool 1-0 Manchester City Two changes for Liverpool, one defensive, one attacking. Trent Alexander-Arnold is off for Jarell Quansah, which I expect will see Joe Gomez to right-back and Quansah to centre-half. Darwin Nunez replaces goalscorer Cody Gakpo up front. Getty Images 72' Liverpool 1-0 Manchester City City do look far brighter in this second half, and are pushing hard for an equaliser.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Liverpool 2 Man City 0 - Slot's side dominate struggling City to go nine points clear,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5955206/2024/12/01/liverpool-man-city-premier-league/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 17:59:26 GMT",Our writers break down the action from Anfield as Salah again proves crucial for Liverpool and City's poor run continues.,"EPL A team flying at the top of the league against a side without a win in six games brought the result you would expect as Arne Slot’s side went nine points clear with a 2-0 win over Manchester City. The home side went at City from the start and were ahead early through Cody Gakpo after a brilliant cross from Mohamed Salah but that was surprisingly the only goal of a first half Liverpool dominated. Advertisement City manager Pep Guardiola made tweaks in an attempt to stop the Premier League leaders, but City could not cope with Liverpool and victory was sealed when Salah converted a penalty in the second half after Stefan Ortega had fouled Luis Diaz. Sam Lee, Gregg Evans and Thom Harris break down the action from Anfield.  City would have hoped they could unsettle Liverpool by turning Liverpool around at the toss and forcing them to attack The Kop in the first half, yet it had the opposite effect. Pumped up, the Premier League leaders set the tone by flying out of the blocks in the opening stages and playing on the front foot. One banner in the crowd asked: “Arne you not entertained?” and the home support certainly were. Slot’s side pressed hard and efficiently, winning possession on multiple occasions, and were clearly testing Ortega in goal with shots from all angles. Liverpool 🤝 Gladiator pic.twitter.com/U2EqSJtej1 — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) December 1, 2024  By the time Gakpo scored on 12 minutes, Liverpool could have easily been two or three up with Virgil van Dijk coming close with a header that crashed off the post after other chances went begging. Winning a few early corners in front of The Kop also helped lift the atmosphere which played a part in the early dominance. 39 – Manchester City’s first shot attempt at Anfield came in the 39th minute; their longest wait for their first shot of a Premier League match since April 2010 versus Arsenal (58th minute). Frozen. pic.twitter.com/8DfG0SLb6r — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) December 1, 2024  City played too many short passes in their own half, were dispossessed easily and didn’t manage a shot until the 39th minute. By the halfway stage of the opening period, Liverpool had registered 45 touches in the final third compared to just five from City (and there was no way back for the reigning champions). Gregg Evans The major team news before kick-off was Stefan Ortega starting in goal ahead of Ederson, and obviously the German conceded a penalty, although he was stitched up by mistakes ahead of him and it is hard to imagine Ederson or any other keeper doing better in that scenario. This was obviously a rough day for City and it was always going to be, given their recent well-known issues. But Guardiola made other tweaks, too. Advertisement Even without Josko Gvardiol’s recent struggles (two errors leading to goals in the last two matches), there was a strong case for Nathan Ake to start up against Mohamed Salah, who has terrorised many a City full-back (indeed, many a full-back) over the years. Ake is strong in those scenarios and, as much as anything, Gvardiol has probably been run into the ground as a result of being just about the only defender who has not been injured in the last month. In terms of Matheus Nunes starting, City fans had hoped to see that on Sunday but that was most likely through the middle, with the logic that his energy alone would be exactly what City need in central areas, given the struggles of Bernardo Silva, Ilkay Gundogan and Rico Lewis of late. But Guardiola used Nunes on the left, where in fairness he did well before the international break, but when he actually had to provide an attacking threat he did not, perhaps understandably, have that extra level. He showed what he can do working back, and that should be useful as City try to find their feet in the coming games. Quite what his selection by Guardiola means for Jack Grealish is another story. Towards the end of the match, with Guardiola’s side nearing defeat, Liverpool fans made their views known as they chanted Guardiola would be getting sacked in the morning. The City manager responded by holding up six fingers for the titles he has won while at the club.  Sam Lee Liverpool are now a well-oiled machine, capable of controlling games and seeing them out in style. But without Mo Salah, none of it would be possible. This was the sixth Premier League game in a row where the Egyptian found his way onto the scoresheet. After missing a glaring opportunity midway through the second half, he made amends by slamming home from the spot to secure the win for Liverpool. It was also his assist for Gakpo that helped get the ball rolling early on as his prolific goalscoring form continues to be matched by such relentless creativity, too.  It was the 36th time he had scored and assisted in a Premier League game, equalling Wayne Rooney’s record. At 32 years of age, he is showing no signs of slowing down and continues to be crucial in this table-topping Liverpool team. Already this season he has 24 goals and assists in 20 games, an incredible achievement for a player whose contract expires in the summer and is no closer to extending. Sam Lee City’s structural issues out of possession have been laid bare for all to see throughout their poor run of form, but a dismal first half at Anfield, in which they lost possession 15 times in their own final third, was underpinned by uncertainty with the ball at their feet. Liverpool hunted the ball tirelessly in the opening half an hour, buoyed by the feeling that their aggressive pressing plan was bearing fruit. Slot’s side pushed onto City in their usual 4-2-4 shape, with Dominik Szoboszlai pushing on and joining the front three to form a barrier of four attacking players that worked hard to block the passes into midfield. Advertisement Particularly from goal kicks, City looked vulnerable. Ortega became an auxiliary centre-back while Manuel Akanji pushed forward and provided an option behind that front line, but the Swiss centre-back struggled to turn away from pressure when the ball was played into him with his back to the play. With the ball further up the pitch, Bernardo Silva would drop into deeper areas to help chisel a passage through that four-man block, but City did little to pull the two deeper midfielders — Alexis MacAllister and Ryan Gravenberch — out of position, making it difficult to find Phil Foden with any meaningful forward passes. The second half was better as Liverpool dropped off. Their press was more of a 4-3-3 than a 4-2-4, and allowed City a bit more time to string together passing moves without being hassled and harried by the front line. But even then there were sticky moments; Rico Lewis waved furiously on a number of occasions for Ruben Dias to play a more direct pass into Erling Haaland, but the Portuguese did not seem to back himself to find the pass. City will have wanted to calm the Anfield crowd with assured possession play in the opening stages, but their attempts to open a path through Liverpool were unimaginative, and left their defensive players flapping under the pressure. Thom Harris This is obviously a deep, deep hole that City find themselves in and, in some senses, the result today does not change that. Going 11 points behind rules them out of the title race but in reality even if they had found a way to win today their problems cannot be fixed by a morale boost from one match. They need players to come back from injury soon and with Ruben Dias back here they got a big boost, with Akanji and Ake back, too. But even so, they are weaker in midfield than ever, with players missing through injury and those ‘fit’ run into the ground by playing so many games, and that is the big issue which means that even had City got a result here, they would still be at risk of dropping further points in the coming weeks. Advertisement That is what Guardiola was getting at on Friday when asked if victory here could kickstart their season and it is the simple reality for City. They were deservedly beaten here and that is no good thing but there were spells where they did well and considering how low on confidence they clearly are, it is positive for Guardiola to still see that fight. As long as players come back from injury they will improve again, but they need a new face (or two) in January (and they need any arrival to make an instant impact) to get back to their very best. There is no doubt that things are bleak at the moment but City will see a way out of it, eventually. Sam Lee We will bring you this after he has spoken at the post-match press conference.

Purdue has struggled mightily under Walters, 38, compiling a 5-19 record and not finding any success. Before losing to Indiana, the Boilermakers (1-11) ranked 129th in scoring offense and 130th in scoring defense. Both aspects became direct failures for Walters for different reasons. Advertisement Purdue hired Walters in December 2022 after he guided Illinois to the nation’s top spot in scoring defense and No. 3 in total defense. He replaced Jeff Brohm, who led the pass-happy Boilermakers to the 2022 Big Ten West championship and left for Louisville before the Citrus Bowl that year. For his reputation as a defensive mastermind, Walters’ defenses never were competitive. In 16 of Walters’ 24 games as coach, Purdue gave up at least 31 points. Every FBS opponent scored at least 24 points against Purdue this year, including 66 by Notre Dame, 52 by Wisconsin and 50 by Illinois. But Purdue’s offensive woes were even worse. The Boilermakers’ tradition revolves around high-flying offense, spotlighted two years ago with quarterback Aidan O’Connell and receiver Charlie Jones. Walters wanted to play an offense like what Brohm presented but wasn’t fully committed to the scheme. In his first major hire one week into his tenure, Walters brought in Air Raid proponent Graham Harrell as offensive coordinator. But Walters also wanted to control the clock to protect his defense, which doesn’t mesh with Air Raid conceptually. In three consecutive losses against FBS competition this year, Walters fired Harrell. Without a coach with play-calling experience, Walters first turned to analyst Jason Simmons to step in as the offensive coordinator this year. But Simmons spent only one year in college football as the running backs coach at Miami (Ohio) and coached at two different Indiana high schools. After one game, Walters took over offensive play-calling responsibilities. (Photo: Marc Lebryk / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Charles Leclerc and Oscar Piastri joined the Dutchman on the podium, drawing the constructors’ championship battle between McLaren and Ferrari closer heading into the season finale in Abu Dhabi next weekend. Advertisement McLaren was staring down the possibility of winning its first constructors’ championship since 1998, needing to outscore Ferrari by 15 points on Sunday for it to be wrapped up in Qatar. But with Lando Norris ending the day 10th after receiving a 10-second stop-and-go penalty, the gap now sits at 21 points between McLaren and Ferrari with one race to go. “Simply lovely, guys,” Verstappen said over the radio as he crossed the line. “What an unbelievable race again, that was really fun!” The Qatar Grand Prix had a chaotic start, with a safety car coming out early after multiple collisions occurred. Franco Colapinto, Esteban Ocon and Nico Hülkenberg were involved in a Turn 1 incident, while Alex Albon and Lance Stroll had a separate moment. Stroll took a 10-second penalty, which he served, but the Aston Martin driver later retired from the race. At the restart, Piastri got the jump on Leclerc, an important moment for the constructors’ championship. By Lap 19, Norris and Piastri were second and fourth, while Leclerc and Carlos Sainz sat fifth and sixth. That would mean McLaren would only outscore Ferrari by 12 points, assuming none of the four drivers secured the fastest lap. George Russell was the first front-runner to pit, and it was a very slow seven-second pit stop. McLaren opted to keep Piastri out, and clean air helped his pace improve. But the race completely changed around Lap 34. Both Lewis Hamilton and Sainz suffered punctures, triggering another safety car. Piastri had pitted just before the safety car, which meant he lost out to Leclerc, who pitted (along with the rest of the leaders) during the safety car period. Debris needed to be cleaned up during this stretch as well, such as the broken mirror on the start/finish straight. Verstappen was still in the lead when the safety car ended, with Norris second, Leclerc third, Piastri fourth, and Sainz down in seventh. Norris and Verstappen battled at the restart, but the race didn’t stay at full speed. Hülkenberg ended up in the gravel, and Pérez reported losing drive before the restart. A third safety car was called. Advertisement The same order remained among Verstappen, Norris, Leclerc, Piastri and Sainz at the restart, but Piastri reported seeing sparks coming from one of his tires, feeling a vibration. What changed the constructors’ championship was Norris’ penalty. The stewards handed him a 10-second stop-and-go penalty for “failing to slow under yellow flags.” This initially knocked him out of the points, ruining the Briton’s race and throwing a wrench in the constructors’ battle. Norris recovered for a points finish and secured the fastest lap, though not as big of a haul as it once looked. Meanwhile, Hamilton sped in pit lane and was handed a drive-through penalty. All of the chaos allowed teams in the midfield to score crucial points. Pierre Gasly helped Alpine’s fight for P6 with a fifth-place finish, while Kevin Magnussen ended his day ninth. Zhou Guanyu brought home the first points finish of the year for Sauber, finishing eighth. Here is how the top 10 finished.

United took the lead through a deflected Marcus Rashford strike in the 34th minute, before Joshua Zirkzee profited off a Jarrad Branthwaite error to double the host’s advantage shortly before the break. Advertisement Rashford added his second in the opening 20 seconds of the second half, and then it was James Tarkowski who was dispossessed in the build-up to Zirkzee scoring United’s fourth in the 64th minute. “Too many mistakes again today,” Dyche said to Sky Sports after the game. “The first 32 minutes, I thought we were a good outfit. We looked a progressive outfit, we played well, we opened them up. The final pass, the final finish, we know that’s been a task ever since I’ve been at the club and that happened again today. “One mistake leads to another mistake and before you know it, you’re 2-0 down. And the third one straight after kick-off, which is my biggest gripe, I don’t know where they’re going on such a simple aspect of the game. It goes to show if you don’t stay tuned in all the time, then it doesn’t work for you. Today, that was the case, mistakes — and too many.” GO DEEPER Everton Transfer DealSheet: What to expect in 2025 Dyche was also asked about how difficult it was to legislate for individual errors, especially considering his side’s relatively strong defensive record this season. “Certainly after the first four (games),” the 53-year-old replied. “We conceded a lot of goals early doors, a lot of mistakes in those early games. We eradicated that and came into today with only four against in the last eight games. It shows the structure of the team is good. “And then today, it’s very difficult when they make such glaring individual mistakes, it’s a very difficult task.” Everton return to action on Wednesday when they host Wolverhampton Wanderers, before welcoming Liverpool to Goodison Park next Saturday. Dyche’s side sit 15th in the Premier League with 11 points from 13 matches. (Alex Livesey/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Would Ohio State fire Ryan Day? A better question to ask: Would Day even want this job?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5960272/2024/12/01/will-ryan-day-be-fired-ohio-state/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 17:25:54 GMT","Ryan Day has had a remarkable run at Ohio State, but the pall of losing to Michigan grows ever darker — and fans ever more impatient.","COLUMBUS, Ohio — It’s an image that will remain in Ohio State lore for many years to come: Head coach Ryan Day, minutes after his No. 2 Buckeyes lost, inexplicably, to unranked Michigan 13-10, in a daze as players from both teams fought at midfield. He asked a player returning to the sideline, “What happened?” Advertisement It’s a big-picture question that will remain in lore, too. Day is 66-10 and has had four top-five finishes in the coaches poll in five seasons as Ohio State’s full-time head coach. Ohio State is one of three teams to finish in the AP top 10 each of the past five years, along with Alabama and Georgia. The Buckeyes have the second-best win percentage since 2019, behind Georgia. Day has put his team in the College Football Playoff three times since 2019; he’s made a New Year’s Six bowl his other seasons, and that streak will continue this year. It is a truly remarkable record. Also, Ryan Day, your whole team is in the midst of a brawl, and you’re on the sideline asking “what happened?” Huh!? Get your butt on the field and command your players go to the locker room.   pic.twitter.com/fjiZGNmIfW — Emmanuel Acho (@EmmanuelAcho) November 30, 2024  But Day is 1-4 against Michigan and the loser of four in a row in The Game. And at this moment, it feels like the only ones who actually want him remaining in Columbus are Michigan fans. Losing to Michigan multiple times? “It’s one of the worst things that’s ever happened to me in my life, quite honestly, other than losing my father and a few other things,” Day said earlier in the week during his coach’s show, before Saturday’s loss. “And for my family, (it’s) the worst thing that’s happened. So, we can never have that happen again. Ever.” And on Saturday, it wasn’t just losing that stung (Day’s first loss to an unranked team). It was the worst Michigan team the Buckeyes had faced in more than a decade. It was a Wolverines team with an inept offense, and without its best players: tight end Colston Loveland and cornerback Will Johnson. GO DEEPER Meet 2024 Ohio State, the unhappiest Playoff team in college football history The Buckeyes’ 10 points were their lowest output of the season. Their two elite tailbacks were unable to run the ball. Their special teams melted down. Their quarterback, Will Howard, threw two interceptions; quarterback play has been Day’s specialty and was what brought him to Columbus on Urban Meyer’s staff. Michigan, again, was the tougher team. Advertisement And then the damning postgame brawl erupted. Michigan players literally wanted to plant the Wolverines flag in the middle of The Shoe. Punches were thrown. Police got involved, pepper spraying those in and around the melee. And there was Day, frozen, instead of aggressively trying to settle things with his players. It was a horrible look at the end of a nightmarish day for the Buckeyes and especially Day. It is impossible to truly know just what Day and his family have been dealing with, being on the wrong side of this rivalry and directly in the middle of it, suffocated by it. Though Day seems to be having more fun behind the scenes this year than previously, people close to Day have talked privately about how emotionally hard this had been for his wife and young children. Coaches and their families often get the worst of being connected to proud programs with incredibly passionate fan bases. From what I’ve heard, this is all of that, times a million. And that was before Saturday’s disaster against Michigan — the most shocking outcome of a college football season of stunners. Day, of course, is being compensated very well. He makes more than $10 million a year. Many, I’m sure, would love to have his problems. The Buckeyes have better resources than anyone in the sport; SEC blue bloods are in the same ballpark, but those half-dozen heavyweights are all jostling with each other. In the Big Ten, the Buckeyes stand alone. Michigan, Penn State and Oregon are not committed to football at the level Ohio State is. This year, after seeing how the Wolverines had surpassed Ohio State on the field under Jim Harbaugh, the Buckeyes pumped $20 million into the 2024 roster. But against Michigan — a team that lost almost its entire offense and its defensive leaders, not to mention Harbaugh himself — Day’s team still couldn’t get the job done. GO DEEPER Ryan Day went all in on beating Michigan — except when it mattered most The Buckeyes’ season is far from over, though they will be at home watching the Big Ten Championship Game next Saturday rather than playing in it. Ohio State will make the Playoff, given that the Buckeyes beat top-five Penn State in Happy Valley and blew out top-10 Indiana. This is still an extremely talented team. Advertisement Day is a really good coach, and I wouldn’t be shocked if the Buckeyes ended up winning the national title. (This is after believing that they would win it all this year; I am skeptical now.) Two years ago, Ohio State also had a crushing defeat against Michigan in Columbus. But it then almost beat Georgia in the Playoff, coming within a last-second field goal, which then would have set Ohio State up against an undermanned TCU team in the title game. But this team feels much heavier. More gut punches at the hands of the Wolverines. More of the Buckeyes twisting themselves in knots. Stuck in a mind game they can’t seem to get out of. And if they don’t win the title this year, that seemingly excruciating pressure on Day will only get more suffocating. Many are wondering if Ohio State would fire Day if the Buckeyes don’t win the title this year. Prominent alumni are loud about the Michigan losses and Ohio State hired a new athletic director this year. Day has a buyout of $38 million. Though Ohio State could figure out that sum, would it be justifiable just because he lost to Michigan again? Moving on from Day would present its own challenges. Look around the sport and you’ll see a lot of big programs whose “home run” hires have fizzled out. Maybe Buckeyes great Mike Vrabel could be the answer. But would he want to become a college coach in this era of the sport? And if not him, then who? A better question to me is this: If Day can’t rally the Buckeyes in the Playoff, does he still really want this job? Is it worth it to him and his young family now, given how hot the temperature is in Columbus? At this point, it sure looks like it isn’t. Read more: (Photo: Aaron J.

It’s more about what Darnold has been doing of late and what that might mean for the future. The only quarterbacks with more passing touchdowns than Darnold this season are Lamar Jackson, Joe Burrow and Baker Mayfield. The only quarterbacks with higher big-time throw rates are Josh Allen and Justin Herbert.  When Darnold doesn’t turn the ball over, he is as capable as anyone of explosiveness. And the more explosive he is down the stretch, the higher his value will be this offseason. The Cardinals play a non-traditional defensive structure and have unheralded but savvy personnel. Sunday might require Darnold’s best as a post-snap processor, which will serve as another fascinating data point to the Vikings’ potential ceiling and Darnold’s overall trajectory GO FURTHER Vikings-Cardinals preview, predictions: Can Minnesota keep pace in the NFC North? Advertisement (Getty Images)              Cornerback Marshon Lattimore's streak of inactive games reached five including four consecutive since the Washington Commanders acquired the four-time Pro Bowl selection at the NFL trade deadline. DT Phidarian Mathis, OT Andrew Wylie (concussion), QB Jeff Driskel and LB Dominique Hampton round out Washington’s inactive list ahead of the 1 p.m. kickoff against the Tennessee Titans. The Commanders only have 51 players on the primary roster after releasing 2023 first-round cornerback Emmannuel Forbes and placing running back Austin Ekeler on injured reserve this Saturday. Mathis, Washington’s 2022 second-round pick, is a healthy scratch and missing his first game of the season. Washington elevated kicker Zane Gonzalez and DL Carl Davis from the practice squad. Gonzalez makes his third appearance for the Commanders and first since Ausrin Seibert (hip/groin) was placed on IR this week. Lattimore joined practice this week for the first time since acquired from the Saints, but only on a limited basis due to a lingering hamstring injury that predates the trade. Washington is off this coming week before returning to the field in New Orleans for Week 15. GO FURTHER Titans at Commanders: How to watch, odds, expert picks with Washington favored at home GO FURTHER Commanders release Emmanuel Forbes, place Austin Ekeler on IR in flurry of roster moves Safety Jalen Pitre (pectoral) is out for the Texans today vs. the Jaguars. He suffered the injury last week against the Titans and reportedly could miss extended time. MINNEAPOLIS — Vikings inactives: RG Ed Ingram, TE Josh Oliver, OL Michael Jurgens, DT Levi Drake Rodriguez, CB Dwight McGlothern, S Jay Ward, QB Brett Rypien The notable inactive here is Ingram, who was a second-round pick in the Vikings' 2022 NFL Draft. The Vikings have already parted ways with six players from that draft class. Third-round pick Brian Asamoah and fifth-round pick Ty Chandler play on special teams. Sixth-round pick Jalen Nailor gets meaningful time on offense, but otherwise the draft has been fruitless. Ingram was replaced a couple weeks by Dalton Risner in Tennessee. His inactivity today means Dan Feeney will back up the interior offensive line spot. Minnesota's other inactives are mostly expected; Oliver, who had played the majority of offensive snaps as a key blocking tight end, will miss his second straight game. Tight ends T.J. Hockenson and Johnny Mundt will replace him. (Getty Images)              Chargers inactives: LB Denzel Perryman (groin) CB Cam Hart (ankle) LB Jeremiah Jean-Baptiste OL Brenden Jaimes OL Jordan McFadden QB Easton Stick (emergency 3rd) Linebacker Daiyan Henley (calf) is active vs. the Falcons. Henley was not able to practice Friday because of the calf injury. The Chargers elevated Jean-Baptise, a rookie, from the practice squad on Saturday. But they will not need that insurance with Henley giving it a go. Henley is having a breakout season. His presence in the middle of the field will be crucial as the Chargers try to defend one of the best skill groups in the league, between running back Bijan Robinson, receiver Drake London and tight end Kyle Pitts. Also of note: receiver DJ Chark is active for just the second time this season. Chark was on IR for the first seven games of the season because of a training camp hip injury. He has been a scratch in three of the past four games since he was activated off IR. The Chargers are desperate for a ball-winner on the outside to take some of the attention off their emerging star Ladd McConkey, who has played primarily in the slot. Chark can be that player. Chark has only played one offensive snap all season. Sunday in Atlanta seems like a good opportunity to finally get Chark involved in the offense. With Hart out for the second straight week, the Chargers have some options to replace him on the outside. Last week, fellow rookie Tarheeb Still filled in for Hart. But the Chargers might need Still at nickel this week. Safety Alohi Gilman landed on IR with a hamstring injury. That will likely force Derwin James Jr. to play more safety snaps this week. James had been playing more nickel over the past month, with Gilman and Elijah Molden at safety. Ja’Sir Taylor and Deane Leonard are other options to replace Hart on the outside, if Still moves inside to nickel. GO FURTHER Chargers at Falcons: How to watch, odds, expert picks for near pick’em in Atlanta GO FURTHER Chargers mailbag: What will make this a successful season for Jim Harbaugh? The only lingering question about player availability for Atlanta against the Chargers today was answered when newly signed place-kicker Riley Patterson was made inactive by the Falcons. That means regular starter Younghoe Koo, who was listed as questionable this week due to a hip injury, will kick. Koo began his NFL career with the Chargers in 2017 but was cut. Linebacker JD Bertrand (concussion) will miss his fourth straight game Sunday, and fellow inside linebacker Rashaan Evans also was listed as inactive. Joining them on that list were cornerback Mike Hughes, running back Jase McClellan and offensive linemen Elijah Wilkinson and Brandon Parker. Advertisement FOXBORO, Mass. – After being removed from the commissioner’s exempt list earlier this week amid ongoing assault and drug charges, Jabrill Peppers is active for Sunday’s Patriots game against the Colts and is expected to play. Peppers missed seven games after being arrested in October for charges including assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, strangulation, and possession of a Class “B” substance believed to be cocaine. Peppers was a limited participant at all three Patriots practices this week. He wasn’t allowed to practice with the team during his nearly two months on the exempt list, so it wasn’t clear whether or not he would play Sunday. “To me, it’s out of respect to the legal process to let that stuff play out,” coach Jerod Mayo said earlier this week. “For us inside these four walls, as long as he’s doing the right thing, I expect him to be able to play when he’s ready to go.” (Getty Images)              Jets inactives LB CJ Mosley OL Jake Hanson OL Max Mitchell RB Izzy Abanikanda DB Jarrick Bernard-Converse EDGE Braiden McGregor CJ Mosley will miss his fifth straight game with a neck injury, and it’s fair to wonder if he’s played his last game in a Jet uniform at this point. The 32-year-old has been a crucial piece of the e Jets defensive revival over the last couple years but had started to show some signs of slowing down and now he can’t stay on the field. He’s only played in four games in 2024. He has one year left on his contract after this season.

Other inactives: QB Kyle Allen (3rd QB), WR Scotty Miller, RB Jonathan Ward, OG Max Scharping (Getty Images)              CINCINNATI — The Bengals will have two defensive starters inactive on Sunday against Pittsburgh with Sheldon Rankins and Logan Wilson both ruled out. Wilson was questionable. Inactives WR Charlie Jones (groin) WR Trenton Irwin LB Logan Wilson (knee) TE Tanner McLachlan DT Sheldon Rankins (viral illness) The Bengals will be without Wilson for the first time for a regular season game since 2022. Wilson couldn’t get up to game speed with his knee injury. The biggest difference for the Bengals defense will be Akeem Davis-Gaither entering for his seventh career start. He’s played 21 percent of snaps this year, but been solid in his reserve role. Still, Wilson is the Bengals’ leading tackler. Another key to watch on Sunday will be how the Bengals handle the offensive line with the return of Orlando Brown Jr. at left tackle. The door is open for Cody Ford, who has impressed filling in but plotted as a guard before the season started, to kick inside as both starting guards have struggled. Cordell Volson and Alex Cappa have rated as two of the worst pass-protecting guards in the NFL this year. Part of that is due to Burrow’s style of extending plays, but it has not been good enough.

(Getty Images) Arizona and Seattle — the leaders of the ever-intriguing NFC West — find themselves in high-pressure situations as they jockey for position in this final stretch of the regular season. Both 6-5, the Seahawks and Cardinals have little margin for error. The Seahawks look to extend their win streak to three games Sunday as they take on the hapless New York Jets at MetLife Stadium. Meanwhile, the Cardinals aim to rebound from last week’s loss to Seattle as they go on the road to face a tough Minnesota Vikings team. Seattle appears to have shaken off a midseason slump, earning hard-fought wins over San Francisco and Arizona in the last two weeks. A previously struggling defense held the 49ers and Cardinals to a combined 23 points while also proving stingy on third downs. Can Mike Macdonald’s team continue to build momentum, or is facing the Jets the perfect trap game? Arizona needs a strong rebound from Kyler Murray and an offense that had averaged 26.3 points per game during a four-game win streak, only to muster six points against Seattle. The Cardinals converted only three of 12 third downs and went 0 of 2 in the red zone against the Seahawks. Fending off Minnesota’s aggressive pass rushers will rank high on the Cardinals’ list of priorities, but that’s no easy task, especially for a team that has beaten only one opponent with a record over .500 this season. A win over 9-2 Minnesota could provide much-needed momentum for Arizona. A loss could put the Cardinals in an undesirable position entering next week’s crucial rematch with Seattle. GO FURTHER NFL Week 13 top storylines: Saquon Barkley, Derrick Henry battle in Eagles-Ravens; NFC West drama   Advertisement Jayden Daniels was supposedly over the rib injury, but he still doesn’t look the same. His -0.20 EPA per dropback rate last week was the worst of his career (not counting Week 7 when he took two dropbacks). Maybe it’s just the rookie wall. Daniels should be OK here, as the Titans are not that tough but somehow decent defensively despite not getting much pressure and missing a couple of cornerbacks.  Tennessee has gone 2-2 after a 1-6 start thanks to a surprising improvement by Will Levis — he’s produced at least a 123.3 passer rating in two of the past three games and I swear I heard more than one Brett Favre comparison this week. He can throw it a mile, and he has some guys in Calvin Ridley and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine who can go get it. Ridley (ankle) didn’t practice Wednesday, while Westbrook-Ikhine leads the league the past four weeks in EPA per reception with a 1.9 rate. We’ll ride with the struggling QB, though, as the Commanders like to blitz and Levis/Favre likes to make mistakes when blitzed. The pick: Commanders Scoop City opens up the Scoop Mailbag to answer your pressing NFL questions, from where Justin Fields ends up next year to the process of Dianna Russini's breaking news. Plus, is Jerry Jones serious about keeping Mike McCarthy? Watch here. After all the prep, all the meetings and monotonous drawing of plays, all the work that went into the Pro Day, all the video they’d watched together to get him ready, Clyde Christensen was eager to see where his newest pupil landed in the NFL Draft. For years, Christensen had been Peyton Manning’s top conduit on the Indianapolis Colts’ offense. Later, he buried the hatchet with Tom Brady — only once they shared Tampa Bay Buccaneers garb and Christensen served as Brady’s quarterbacks coach for a Super Bowl run together — joking about all their matchups against each other when Colts–New England Patriots was the biggest rivalry in the NFL. Now, Christensen was ready to see where his next trainee would end up in the NFL. He thought so highly of the kid that he made some comps between Drake Maye and those great ones. But rivalries don’t fade easily for those so closely attached to them. Even if the draft was a night of celebration regardless of Maye’s destination, Christensen would be lying if he didn’t concede there was some hesitation about watching his latest understudy get taken by the Patriots with the No. 3 pick, his new student headed to his longest rival. “There were probably 31 other teams I would’ve rather he had gone to,” Christensen said, laughing. It’s already been weird over these past 12 games (seven with Maye starting) for Christensen to turn on the TV and want the Patriots to be doing well. But now Sunday presents the most awkward of those rooting encounters as the Patriots host the Colts. In a league where business can be ruthless and loyalties diminish as so many bounce from team to team, Christensen is still all about the Colts. He was with them for 14 years. He remains in touch with owner Jim Irsay. The 2006 Super Bowl team still has an active group chat going. Manning often gets the group going. “He’s the great stirrer of the pot of the group chat,” Christensen said. So, yeah, after all those years with the Colts — seven as wide receivers coach, four as quarterbacks coach and three as offensive coordinator — it’s still a bit tough for Christensen to force himself into wanting success for the Patriots.

Sign up here to receive Until Saturday directly in your inbox. Good morning! Football games have happened, and therefore, we need to fight on the field about their results. Jason here, stepping in for Jayna today. There’s more to life than the College Football Playoff, especially this time of year, when everybody’s playing the team they most want to beat. The traditions! The fighting! We’ll get to the fighting. Having said that, I’m now going to type about the Playoff. Here’s a rough estimation of how the ever-evolving field shapes up with a week to go, with Austin Mock’s bracket projections as our starting point. Advertisement First-round byes at stake Next week’s Big Ten championship almost certainly will be for the No. 1 seed. The combatants: The SEC champ also will get a bye, most likely No. 2. As messy as ever, the ACC will still produce at least one CFP contender. That would mean the No. 4 bye will have a handful of moving parts. In the bracket, somewhere Notre Dame (11-1) isn’t eligible for a bye but is certain to host a Playoff game after outgunning USC 49-35. Wherever the Irish appear in the rankings, the top at-large bid seems assured. Who saw that coming back in September when they lost to NIU? Ohio State (10-2) lost to Michigan despite being a three-touchdown favorite, launching an offseason’s worth of worries about Ryan Day’s 1-4 record in the rivalry — and also launching a postgame brawl after an attempted flag-plant (more on that below). But for now, the former No. 2 team gets the surreal vibe shift of probably hosting a Playoff game. Tennessee (10-2) came back to beat Vanderbilt 36-23, and as Joe Rexrode explains, the Vols will be a real Playoff handful. Now to see whether they host. Indiana (11-1) took out some feelings on rival Purdue, winning 66-0. Expect the Hoosiers to play on the road. Bubble In addition to any of those teams listed above who might tumble down here: South Carolina (9-3): If Clemson wins the ACC, the Gamecocks would have a Playoff argument, having thus beaten a power-conference champion. But that’d also mean the ACC taking up two bids. And since head-to-head is a factor … Alabama (9-3): Remember when it felt like we could rule out the Tide? They controlled Auburn 28-14 yesterday, and now their October win over South Carolina might end up mattering about as much as their September win over Georgia. UNLV (10-2): After Tulane’s Thanksgiving loss to Memphis, the Mountain West likely will enter championship weekend with the two highest-rated Group of 5 teams. That would ensure the MWC title game is a veritable play-in. Advertisement Miami (10-2): Honestly, at this point, the Canes feel like a reach. An ehh schedule, a 1-2 finish and only a couple of impressive wins since September. If you want a team with that profile, just take BYU, the only team to beat SMU. But we’ll see. Seven days out. Remember to check Austin’s projections for the numbers-y version. And now for the brawling. As noted, Michigan-Ohio State was just one of this weekend’s many sources of extracurricular rivalry behavior. See also: Nebraska refusing Iowa’s handshakes, the Iron Bowl being the Iron Bowl, UNC and Florida State likewise taking exception to flag plants and Arizona being offended by Arizona State doing the pitchfork-plant version. Additionally, South Carolina’s live mascot reportedly relieved himself on Clemson’s logo. Greatest sport on earth. I think this proves Georgia Tech-Georgia was the only game that went long enough to get all of the football out of its system. After the 8OT voyage in Athens, did Kirby Smart and Brent Key powerbomb each other because of faux pas about which decorations belong in which places on the field? No. They just hugged for a long time. Therefore, the solution to all disagreements is to simply keep playing football. Entering the season, the middle-heavy Big 12 was a good bet to be the messiest league, the answer to the question, “What if we made the whole plane out of the ACC Coastal?” And now that it has become the last league to finalize its conference-title matchup, thereby resolving what’d been a four-way tie for first place, let’s review where this conference started — and where it finished. Here was the Big 12 preseason poll’s predicted order, with emojis signifying how far off those predictions ended up being: Predictions are hard, so no shade here. I’m just not sure I’ve ever seen a conference so close to nearly inverting itself. Impressive! Since 1869, about 14,100 teams have played FBS-level college football, according to Sports Reference’s historical database. (Obviously, “FBS” hasn’t existed for that entire time, so that determination requires some eyeballing and thinkwork.) On each season’s page, S-R has ranked all of those teams with its basic SRS power rating. For years now, I’ve kept a spreadsheet with all of those ratings. Advertisement This season’s most noteworthy takeaway, here at the end of the regular season: 2024 Kent State, the first 0-12 team since 2019, currently ranks 13,732nd out of those 14,100 teams. That number might get even worse, once the system calculates yesterday’s 43-7 loss to Buffalo. (Then again, it could remain an improvement over last year’s 13,817th-place finish. Then again, last year’s team won a game.) I don’t say this to mock the Golden Flashes. That would be absurd. They had one of the most unfair schedules ever, having to play Playoff teams Penn State and Tennessee, plus Pitt and the MAC’s five best teams. Still, this is depressing. So let’s try to find the bright side: Gus Malzahn is stepping down after four mostly disappointing years as UCF’s head coach and will become Florida State’s OC, The Athletic reported. Malzahn’s last stint as a coordinator included Auburn’s 2010 BCS title. Stanford legend Andrew Luck is returning as the program’s general manager. He says he’ll be involved in game preparation, and per ESPN, he’s now the boss of head coach Troy Taylor. That’s a new one. Luke Fickell just oversaw the worst Wisconsin season in decades. Um, now what? Remember when Kyle McCord was the problem? Well, he outplayed Will Howard. Stewart Mandel on that and more Ohio State woes in his Week 14 Final Thoughts.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Giannis Antetokounmpo, Damian Lillard key Bucks' win streak: 'Our chemistry has been incredible'",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5959764/2024/12/01/milwaukee-bucks-giannis-antetokounmpo-damian-lillard/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 17:00:31 GMT","For the third time, Antetokounmpo and Lillard had 25-plus points and 10-plus assists in the same game, the most by any duo in NBA history.","NBA MILWAUKEE — The Milwaukee Bucks know things will become more difficult, but that was not their concern Saturday night. “We just know that no matter if it looks pretty, if we’re playing well, we gotta figure out ways to win the game,” Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo said. “And I was saying it too in the fourth quarter and guys kept saying the same thing, like, it doesn’t matter, just win the game. Advertisement “We’re going to go watch film and see what we can do better and come next game and be better. … But at the end of the day, no matter how the game goes, figure out a way to win that game and then we can move on forward.” And that is what they did, grinding out a 124-114 win over a Washington Wizards team that lost its 14th consecutive game. The Bucks have won six straight. It’s their longest win streak since their six-game streak out of the All-Star Break last season. They have also won eight of nine and are over .500 for the first time since their opening-night victory against the Philadelphia 76ers. But it was a fight. The Bucks raced out to an eight-point lead to open the game, only to see six lead changes and three ties before leading the whole second half. Even then, the Wizards were within two points with less than five minutes to go in the fourth. “I didn’t think we started the game out right,” Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. “We just kinda came out and played and then we kinda got into the game, but you take wins like this because these are games early in the season we would have lost. These games are good teachers for us.” It may have come on a night where the team played poorly in a win against the lowly Wizards (2-16), but Antetokounmpo put together a 40-point triple-double for the first time in his career with 42 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists on Saturday. According to Basketball-Reference’s Stathead tool, he was the 31st player in NBA history to accomplish the feat. Damian Lillard, Antetokounmpo’s All-Star teammate, had a big game as well, adding 25 points, five rebounds and 10 assists. It was the third time Antetokounmpo and Lillard had 25-plus points and 10-plus assists in the same game, the most by any duo in NBA history, according to the NBA. “I thought Giannis and Dame down the stretch really played the two-man game,” Rivers said. “And through the two-man game, they made two great passes — one to Brook (Lopez), one to TP (Taurean Prince) — trusting their teammates. So, there’s a lot of good stuff to show our team to just keep us building.” Advertisement With 4:22 remaining, Rivers took a timeout. The Bucks led 105-103 but they had only scored 13 points in the first seven and a half minutes of the fourth quarter. Over the next three minutes, the Bucks went on a 10-0 run that revolved around their superstar duo making plays and elevating their teammates. On the first possession out of the timeout, Antetokounmpo and Lillard worked together to create an easy bucket for Antetokounmpo. While there will always be a desire to see them use it more as they did in the play above, and for the duo to look better in it, the two-man game with Antetokounmpo and Lillard has grown stronger in their second season. As he has gotten to know Antetokounmpo, Lillard has grown more adept at identifying and creating situations where Antetokounmpo can serve as the roll man with an empty corner — the most effective rolling action for Antetokounmpo over the years — and they have been able to use it with greater regularity this season. “Now we’re going into our second year playing together, and our chemistry has been incredible so far,” Antetokounmpo said after the game. “He hits me in the pocket. If he doesn’t hit me in the pocket, that means he has an open shot. He can get downhill, make another play. “I think we trust one another. We definitely trust way more one another’s decision-making and we give one another space to operate.” Two plays later, a pick-and-roll action (before the clip below starts) with Antetokounmpo allowed Lillard to get downhill, which eventually opened up a chance for Antetokounmpo to attack from the top of the key in isolation. And while it may seem as though the Bucks were only getting things done on the offensive end, Antetokounmpo and Lillard also showed up on the defensive end. As Antetokounmpo and Rivers reiterated after the game, the Bucks were far from perfect in Saturday’s game as giving up an open 3 and allowing an offensive rebound in crunch time is not model behavior. But Antetokounmpo recovered in a big spot by hustling in a scramble situation to come up with a block and then Lillard worked hard to close out Alex Sarr and poke away the ball to create a turnover. As Rivers mentioned, Antetokounmpo and Lillard were not only able to create purely for each other to close out the game, but also the Bucks wrapped up the 10-0 run to close the game with the threat of their two-man game creating for their teammates. With a six-point lead, the Bucks went to one of their regular clutch-time actions where either Antetokounmpo or Lillard have the ball while the other star and Lopez set up on the elbows to create interplay between all three players. On Saturday, that ultimately led to Antetokounmpo getting a switch and working on isolation on the left wing. With wing Bilal Coulibaly in trouble, the Wizards sent a double-team and forced Antetokounmpo to make a play, which led to Taurean Prince knocking down a big 3 from the top of the key. “When we went to the bench, I told him, ‘Way to bail me out'” Antetokounmpo said of Prince, who scored 11 points on Saturday, “because the guy was pressuring me and I was trying to go, but the minute I tried to go by him, the other guy came to double-team. And I was about to throw it to the corner, but he relocated at the last moment. I was able to make the pass. It was great play by him.” Advertisement After Sarr missed a 3 on the next possession, the Bucks grabbed the rebound and immediately let Lillard get into a two-man action with Antetokounmpo. Antetokounmpo’s early screen forced a switch and let the big man try to post up on the left block. Lillard watched as Antetokounmpo tried to push his defender up the floor to create space for a lob over the top. As he worked on his post position, the Wizards’ help defenders started to move closer to him and Lillard took advantage with a strong cross-court pass to Lopez for a 3 to close out the game. “They know that Dame and Giannis are running the pick and roll to get Giannis to the post,” Rivers said. “And teams make a choice. They either lower their big to try to be the guy on the back side of that and if you do that, you’re leaving Brook alone and that’s what they did and they took the gamble. Dame made a great pass.“ It was an ugly win, but it is a win nonetheless and a strong close to November. After serious struggles to start the season, the Bucks went 9-5 in November and outscored opponents by 3.3 points per 100 possessions outside of garbage time. Per Cleaning the Glass, the Bucks have the league’s eighth-best offense (116.9 points per 100 possessions) and 12th-best defense (113.6 points per 100 possessions) since Nov. 1, but the team’s home-heavy stretch against largely inferior teams is coming to an end. Things are going to get more difficult as three of the Bucks’ next four games are on the road. The Bucks will need to clean up things and execute at a higher level to continue to win games and fight their way into one of the top-four seeds in the Eastern Conference.

Fofana, 23, went down shortly before the hour mark during Sunday’s Premier League win over Aston Villa and had to be replaced by Benoit Badiashile. Fofana appeared to be clutching his right leg and went straight down the Stamford Bridge tunnel after coming off. Advertisement “It’s unfortunately bad news,” Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca confirmed after the 3-0 victory. “It was a hamstring problem and with this kind of thing, it’s at least three, four, five weeks. In this moment, (it) means he loses 10 games, 12 games. “The way he was playing it’s a big loss for us, but we have more players and we will try to find solutions. “It’s a big loss. He’s doing fantastic, but it’s normal when you play this amount of games. Fortunately, it was his first injury this season, but we will find a solution.” Fofana had started all 12 league games he was available for to start the season, missing only the 2-1 defeat at Liverpool in October through suspension after picking up five yellow cards. The Frenchman’s injury leaves Maresca with Tosin Adarabioyo and Axel Disasi as senior right-footed centre-back options, though the left-footed Badiashile started alongside Levi Colwill during last weekend’s win at Leicester City when Fofana played at right-back and was again chosen to come on against Villa. Renato Veiga, the 21-year-old Portuguese, is another left-footed centre-back option. Chelsea beat Villa thanks to goals from Nicolas Jackson, Enzo Fernandez and Cole Palmer. They move to third in the league, level on points with Arsenal, and are next in action on Wednesday when they travel to Southampton. Including that Southampton game, Chelsea play nine matches in the Premier League and Europa League between now and January 4.

Flex fliers | Fantasy football player rankings Updated through 11:38 a.m. ET, Dec. 1 Trevor Lawrence, QB, Jaguars (shoulder) — Active
Trevor Lawrence is active for Week 13. Head coach Doug Pederson told reporters, “He’s done some really good things this week. I would say as of right now, yes, he will play.” Fantasy managers with any stake in the Jags are desperate for Lawrence’s return. With him in, TE Evan Engram and WR Brian Thomas Jr. become fantasy-relevant again. Brian Robinson Jr., RB, Commanders (ankle) — Active
Austin Ekeler, RB, Commanders (concussion) — Injured reserve
Ekeler has been placed on injured reserve while Robinson is active. Backup RB Jeremy McNichols has been plucked off waiver wires all week. Lesser-known RB Chris Rodriguez Jr. could also factor into the running game if Robinson suffers any setbacks and with Ekeler on IR. Austin Seibert, K, Commanders (hip) — Injured reserve
Seibert has been placed on IR after missing kicks following his return from injury, and Zane Gonzalez was elevated from the practice squad to replace him. When Seibert was previously out, Gonzalez went 3-for-3 on field goals and 4-for-4 on extra points. Breece Hall, RB, Jets (knee) — Active
Breece Hall is active for Week 13, but Braelon Allen may still be involved in the backfield. Allen had a great Week 2 with 4.7 yards per carry and 19.6 PPR points. But he is averaging 3.7 yards per rush on the year and 5.36 PPR points. Younghoe Koo, K, Falcons (hip) — Active
Koo is active and ready to go for Week 13. Alec Pierce, WR, Colts (foot) — Active
Josh Downs, WR, Colts (shoulder) — Out
Downs has been ruled out, and Pierce is active. Adonai Mitchell is fantasy-relevant without Downs, and Michael Pittman Jr. stands to get the most wide receiver looks for the Colts. Advertisement J.K. Dobbins, RB, Chargers (knee) — Injured reserve
Dobbins sprained his MCL and has been placed on injured reserve. With him out, grab Gus Edwards and think about flexing him. He didn’t do too well after Dobbins left the game in Week 12, but he will likely lead LA’s backfield in Dobbins’ absence. Other names to consider are Kimani Vidal and Hassan Haskins. DeMario Douglas, WR, Patriots (ankle) — Active
Douglas is officially active for Week 13. Averaging 8.56 PPR points per game, Douglas is a flex option in deeper leagues. Kayshon Boutte and Kendrick Bourne could see more work with Douglas out. Tyjae Spears, RB, Titans (concussion) — Active
Spears is active for Week 13. Tony Pollard is the RB1 in Tennessee. In Spears’ Week 12 absence, Pollard had 119 yards on 24 carries, a touchdown and finished with 21.9 PPR points. DeVonta Smith, WR, Eagles (hamstring) — Questionable
Smith missed Week 12 with a hamstring injury and remains questionable for Week 13. According to EJ Smith of The Philadelphia Inquirer, the Eagles receiver said he’s not sure if he will play Sunday. Without Smith on the field last week, A.J. Brown and Dallas Goedert were the only pass catchers with more than one target. Saquon Barkley also caught four passes for 47 receiving yards. Ja’Tavion Sanders, TE, Panthers (neck) — Out
Jalen Coker, WR, Panthers (quadriceps) — Out
Sanders has been ruled out for Week 13, meaning Tommy Tremble will likely get the start. Tremble has not exceeded 5.9 PPR points in any game this season. Coker has also been ruled out, which poses less of an issue for Carolina now that Adam Thielen has returned. In Week 12, David Moore led all receivers with 10 targets, Xavier Legette had four and Thielen had three. Brock Purdy, QB, 49ers (shoulder) — Questionable
Purdy was limited in practice this week, but head coach Kyle Shanahan said that he expects the quarterback to play, according to Nick Wagoner of ESPN.com. Brandon Allen would get another start if anything changes. Managers of Niners receivers would be incredibly thankful if Purdy returns for Week 13. Advertisement Keon Coleman, WR, Bills (wrist) — Questionable
Dalton Kincaid, TE, Bills (knee) — Out
Coleman was limited at practice with a wrist injury, while Kincaid has been ruled out. Coleman hasn’t played since Week 9. If he returns, Coleman will share targets with Amari Cooper and Khalil Shakir. With Kincaid out, Dawson Knox is a quality backup who should demand streaming consideration for this week. Cedric Tillman, WR, Browns (concussion) — Out
Tillman was diagnosed with a concussion during Thursday Night Football in Week 12 and has been ruled out for Week 13. But Jerry Jeudy has been the surging Browns receiver lately. In Weeks 8-12, Jeudy has averaged 17 PPR points, with a 26.2-point performance in Week 11. If Tillman sits, Jeudy is an even better fantasy option. 
  Outdoor games only.  As the weather grows colder, two remaining matchups — 49ers-Bills and Steelers–Bengals — will be played in temperatures below 35 degrees. In Jake Ciely’s fantasy football strategy guide to weather, he notes that the passing game is impacted when temperatures drop below 35 degrees, which is illustrated in the table below. According to Rotowire’s aggregated NFL-related forecasts, there is an 89 percent chance of snow with an expected temperature of 27 degrees when the Bills welcome the 49ers to Buffalo. San Francisco 49ers (5-6) vs. Buffalo Bills (9-2) Snow and precipitation primarily affect the passing game. Typically, running backs are used more in difficult weather conditions, so their value is less impacted. Christian McCaffrey and James Cook should typically produce, and maybe Ray Davis even gets some carries if the game scripts lean run. Josh Allen has played in three games in the snow, in 2020 and 2021. In those games, he averaged a completion percentage of 51.8 percent, compared to a career 63.7 percent (TruMedia). While that’s dismal, he also still threw for an average of 256.33 yards per game. Backup TE Dawson Knox and Cook out of the backfield could see a lot of short-yardage work. I may trust Khalil Shakir more than Amari Cooper this week because of Shakir’s rapport with Allen and consistent fantasy production. Advertisement Brock Purdy hasn’t played in the snow in the NFL. The San Francisco 49ers last snowy game was in Jan. 2022, in a divisional game against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field. They won 13-10, and seven of their points came off a blocked punt that went for a touchdown. Former 49ers QB Jimmy Garoppolo was 11-for-19 and threw for 131 yards and an interception. The team rushed for 106 total yards, and Kittle led the Niners in receiving with four receptions and 63 yards. A typical snow game.

 Game-specific previews and live updates are available on the day of the game. Philadelphia Eagles (9-2) vs. Baltimore Ravens (7-4) After Saquon Barkley’s 302 net yards and Hurts’ efficient performance against the Rams in Week 12, Philly still doesn’t get the odds against the Ravens in Baltimore. Led by MVP candidate Lamar Jackson, the Ravens can beat anyone, even the soaring Eagles. Derrick Henry’s impact on Baltimore’s dominant season cannot be overstated. He’s averaging 20 PPR points per game and just had a 140-yard rushing performance on Monday Night Football, breaking one tackle after another. He faces eight men in the box at the second-highest rate in the NFL (33.9 percent) and still averages 3.55 yards after contact (sixth in the league). Zay Flowers (Ciely’s WR23), Mark Andrews (TE19) and Rashod Bateman (WR54) round out the Ravens offense and give Jackson capable targets. The Ravens allow the fewest yards per rush (3.5), and even Barkley may find less room to run in this game. The Eagles have a great one-two punch with A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith (who was inactive in Week 12 and questionable this week), and TE Dallas Goedert is great for the short game. With much focus on Barkley this season, Hurts’ seventh-ranked passer rating (102.3) and sixth-ranked completion percentage (69.1 percent) have gone under the radar. Brown has 727 receiving yards on the season and averages 16.96 PPR points per game. Read the full preview.  San Francisco 49ers (5-6) vs. Buffalo Bills (9-2) The Niners have been disappointing this year and sit at the bottom of the NFC West. Still in playoff contention, they hope to have Brock Purdy back in Week 13. Christian McCaffrey hasn’t looked the same since his return from injury, averaging 3.5 yards per carry and under 50 rushing yards per game. However, the Bills D gives up 4.9 yards per carry (30th in the NFL), giving fantasy managers who have McCaffrey something to be thankful for this week. Interestingly in the receiving corps, Deebo Samuel is averaging only 10.5 PPR points per game, while breakout wideout Jauan Jennings is averaging 14.9. Advertisement Josh Allen is on a tear this season, averaging 231.18 passing yards and 28.7 rushing yards per game and throwing for 18 TDs while rushing for five. He has only five interceptions with a passer rating of 98.2 and is fantasy’s QB5 with 20.3 PPR points per game. Now Allen has Amari Cooper alongside Khalil Shakir as his top two receivers. Shakir has only scored less than 10 PPR points once in Week 6; he offers a great floor and a ceiling of about 20 points. Read the full preview.  Cleveland Browns (3-8) vs. Denver Broncos (7-5) On the shoulders of Bo Nix’s improved play and a tough defense, the Broncos are favored over the Cleveland Browns. I was big on Nix entering the season. His college career contained few errors, and I thought he’d fit into Sean Payton’s system well. But the first few weeks of his play had me cowering in a corner. But persistence has brought vengeance! Nix has thrown zero interceptions in the past three weeks while scoring eight touchdowns. From Weeks 10-12, his passer rating is 118.6, and he has a 71.4 percent completion rate. Courtland Sutton has been buoyed because of it. During that span, he averaged 81.67 receiving yards per game on nine targets. The Broncos running game is an entirely different story. Payton seems to be using the hot-hand approach to Javonte Williams, Jaleel McLaughlin and Audric Estime, making none of them viable fantasy plays. The Browns have some fight in them with Jameis Winston under center. They aren’t winning games, but they’ve become more fun to watch, and Jerry Jeudy has become flex-relevant in deep leagues. Jeudy has scored 12 or more PPR points since Week 8, and in Week 11, he had 26.2. Denver has a stout pass defense, allowing only 199.8 passing yards per game (ninth in the NFL), so while I think Jeudy deserves flex consideration, temper expectations. Read the full preview (coming Monday).  Statistics in this section come from TruMedia.  Michael Salfino looks at usage trends across the league.  What we’re doing is really simple. For pass-catchers, market share is targets divided by team pass attempts. For running backs, it is touches divided by team plays from scrimmage (not team touches, to be clear). Snap counts, depth of target and type of touch (running back receptions are far more valuable than carries) are also important but will generally not be discussed here. This is pure market share. Consider this a primary tool for assessing waivers and trades. … If J.K. Dobbins is out with his balky knee, Gus Edwards probably elevates to a more prominent role. He’ll definitely be the goal-line back. Advertisement Noah Brown is widely available. He was No. 13 and easily out-targeted Terry McLaurin. If you get 10 targets, I’m automatically adding you off of waivers. Zay Flowers is in such a depressed passing offense that he’s almost certain to underperform his market share, especially given his TD woes. But you have to play him in Flex10 formats (three WRs and a flex). Check out all of Salfino’s insights.
 —Salfino Scott Engel discusses last-minute free agency options to fill roster holes.  Marquez Valdes-Scantling, WR, NO (36 percent rostered): MVS’ rostered percentage indicates that most savvy fantasy players know his fantasy history as an occasional boom but more often bust. Derek Carr, however, appears to favor Valdes-Scantling as a downfield threat, and the injury-riddled New Orleans Saints need MVS. Over the past four weeks, the Rams allowed an NFC-high six touchdown passes to WRs. Devaughn Vele, WR, DEN (18 percent): This sizable pass-catcher (6-foot-5, 210 pounds) is emerging as the No. 2 WR for Bo Nix. In the last three games, Vele has posted double-digit fantasy point totals and delivered his best stat line of the season last week (six receptions, nine targets, 80 yards). He is not showing upside yet, but the rookie looks like a big TD target, and scoring receptions may be ahead. For Week 13, Vele is sporting an 86.8 WR/CB matchup grade on Pro Football Focus against the Cleveland Browns cornerbacks, which qualifies as “Excellent.” —Engel See all of Engel’s Week 13 flex fliers.

Shiffrin, 29, was on the second run of the giant slalom competition when she lost control, tumbled to the snow, flipped and slid into the safety netting. Advertisement The U.S. Ski & Snowboard Team on Sunday shared an update from Shiffrin via X that said no ligament damage was found and that her bones and internal organs “look OK.” “Her return to snow is TBD and more information will be forthcoming,” the team said. After the incident, Shiffrin posted a video to social media showing her with an abrasion on her left hip. “Not really too much cause for concern at this point,” she said in the video. “I just can’t move. I have a pretty good abrasion. Something stabbed me … and so I just can’t move. I’m so sorry to scare everybody.” Quick update. Thank you for your cheers and support. Wishing the best of luck to my teammates tomorrow!! I’ll be cheering from the sidelines on this one.🙏❤️ pic.twitter.com/5siYwSFxMT — Mikaela Shiffrin ⛷️ (@MikaelaShiffrin) November 30, 2024  Earlier Saturday, Shiffrin had the fastest time in the first run of the giant slalom and was closing in on a victory when her ski caught and sent her tumbling. It would’ve been her 100th World Cup title. The injury forced Shiffrin to miss Sunday’s slalom event — her best discipline, in which she’s won 62 of her 99 World Cup titles. Shiffrin, a three-time Olympic medalist, is already the all-time World Cup wins leader in alpine skiing. In March 2023, she passed Sweden’s Ingemar Stenmark to move into first place with her 87th win, two months after surpassing fellow American star Lindsey Vonn’s mark of 82. Shiffrin entered this season with 97 wins and picked up Nos. 98 and 99 in successive weeks in Europe last month, winning the slalom events in Levi, Finland, and Gurgl, Austria. That set her up for a potential landmark 100th win on what is considered a home course for her. Shiffrin trained at Burke Mountain Academy, not far from Killington. She has won the slalom event there six times. Advertisement The next event on the women’s World Cup calendar — next weekend at Tremblant in Québec, Canada — was postponed due to poor snow conditions. The following weekend, Beaver Creek in Colorado — near Shiffrin’s hometown of Vail — hosts before the tour heads back to Europe.

Every fan base wants to fire its coach. Ask Ohio State. The Buckeyes entered Saturday as 20-point favorites with a spot in the Big Ten Championship on the line, but were stunned by archrival Michigan, with an ugly brawl capping the day. But there’s a twist… Two things are true for the Buckeyes, and deliver us a fresh lesson about College Football In The Year 2024: Welcome to 2024! College football coaches who made the old four-team playoff were safe from even the angriest of big-money boosters. Now, it’s uncharted territory. We asked our own Bruce Feldman, who breaks a ton of coaching news across college football, for some help. The Pulse: Bruce, there are many who think Ryan Day needs to win a title to keep his job, which is a wild sentence to type (for a 66-10 coach). Do you buy it? Advertisement Bruce: Well, he’s making over $10 million per year and the school pumped $20 million into its roster in large part because Michigan had surpassed the Buckeyes and won a national title. He’s got better resources than any coach in his league by a wide margin. I think Day is still a really good coach, and I wouldn’t be shocked if they still ended up winning a national title this year. But if they don’t, that intense pressure on him will only get more suffocating. I’ll pose a question: If Day can’t rally the Buckeyes in the Playoff, does he still want this job? Is it worth it to him and his family given how hot the temperature is around there now? Weird situation. But again: This will happen everywhere.  As for that 12-team Playoff field, we grabbed Austin Mock — the man with the projections model — to update us on after a day where, beyond the stunner in Columbus, Miami collapsed, Texas and Notre Dame escaped rivalry games unscathed and Oregon held serve. Locks: Oregon, Ohio State, Texas, Notre Dame, Penn State, Georgia, Tennessee, Indiana, Big 12 winner. (Yes, Ohio State is a lock, kids. Welcome to 2024.)

Philly can go 10-2 and stay a game back of the 11-1 Lions in the NFC if they win in Baltimore today. Imagine telling Eagles fans in September that Nick Sirianni would have some leverage now. Noon
Steelers (8-3) at Bengals (4-7) — A loss probably sends Cincinnati careening out of the playoffs, wasting another prime year of Joe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase, and likely sending Tee Higgins on his merry way to someone else’s WR1 slot. Meanwhile, the Steelers are just a half-game up on Baltimore in the division. Stakes everywhere. TV: CBS 4:25 p.m.
Eagles (9-2) at Ravens (8-4) — This is one of a few plausible Super Bowl matchups we have right now, and from a vibes standpoint, it’s a must-win for Baltimore. Falling 1 1/2 games back with five to play in the AFC North seems unpleasant. This is also just a great regional rivalry, with the teams sitting just over an hour away from each other down I-95. TV: CBS 8:20 p.m.
49ers (5-6) at Bills (9-2) — Well, we thought this was a possible Super Bowl matchup before the season, but now it’s just a sad reminder of how far San Francisco has fallen. Unless … the Niners win and somehow go from last in the division to first with a win here, because that’s extremely possible due to the hardline mediocrity of the NFC West. It will be difficult against a Bills team in full stride. TV:  Eberflus out
The 4-8 Bears fired coach Matt Eberflus on Friday after he was widely criticized for his clock management in Chicago’s loss — its sixth straight — to the Lions on Thanksgiving. It was a decision set in motion back in Week 8, the start of this losing streak, when the Commanders’ Hail Mary win seemingly broke the Bears. We’ll continue to dissect this move in the days to come, but for now, here’s a timeline of Eberflus’ tenure and a list of potential candidates to replace him. Luck’s intriguing new role
Former star quarterback Andrew Luck is returning to Stanford’s football program as general manager, a move indicative of college sports’ changing times. Luck, 35, will oversee every aspect of the program — both on and off the field — with the coaching staff reporting to him. He’s expected to work with coach Troy Taylor on recruiting and roster management and with administration on fundraising, alumni relations, sponsorships, student-athlete support and the stadium experience. More details here. More news To close out the holiday weekend, we’ve got some topics to dig into that you may have missed this week: Perhaps slightly lost amid the Thanksgiving fray was Iga Swiatek’s one-month doping suspension. Sounds serious, right? And probably worse than it really is, as Matthew Futterman points out. Testing detected 50 picograms of a banned substance in the world No. 2’s sample on Aug. 12. Swiatek was informed of her ban on Sept. 12, but we didn’t hear about it until Nov. 28. Is it possible the decision to keep things under wraps may have harmed her reputation, and the sport of tennis, more than the positive test itself? Read Futterman’s full take here. Last year’s inaugural Professional Women’s Hockey League season has largely been heralded as a success, from the skill and physicality level on the ice to attendance and viewership numbers. Season 2 opened last night with many wondering: Can we maintain the momentum? Hailey Salvian went deep on that question. Read that piece as a table-setter today, then follow it with a refresher on rules and other major storylines. We reported last month that the NBA is once again considering changing its All-Star Game format. It’s just the latest attempt to rejuvenate a contest that’s gone stale in recent years. So Marcus Thompson II jumped into the conversation, arguing that any of these new format concepts — whether it be “USA vs. the world” or “old heads vs. the next generation” — would be nothing more than Band-Aids. The real issue, he says: that players simply need to play hard — and the NBA needs to do what it can to encourage them. We’re two days late here, but it’s still fun and relevant: Andy McCullough came up with one Black Friday free-agent deal for every MLB team.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Which defencemen should the Edmonton Oilers target in a trade?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5957782/2024/12/01/oilers-defence-trade-targets-2024/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 15:39:45 GMT",Depth on defence is a strong need for Edmonton if the goal of winning the Stanley Cup is to be realized.,"NHL If Edmonton Oilers general manager Stan Bowman is to move one of the team’s coveted young assets, it’s imperative he secures a player who will be under control for more than just this season. In a conversation this week with Daniel Nugent-Bowman at The Athletic, Bowman addressed the defensive situation by saying “from Games 40 to 50 is when we’re going to try to really decide which type of player would be the best one to add. If we can add a defenceman, we’d like to” and that will come at a price. Advertisement The organization has just four strong trade pieces: The 2026 first-round selection, AHL winger Matt Savoie, OHL centre Sam O’Reilly and OHL defenceman Beau Akey. The team’s prospect pool is so shallow Bowman must secure a legit return for any of these players. Here’s a look at possible defence targets that may warrant such an investment. Jokiharju, 25, is a right-handed defenceman with over 350 games on his NHL resume. His cap hit ($3.1 million) should comfortably fit under the Oilers’ cap by the deadline if Bowman continues to accrue cap dollars as the season wears along. He’s an unrestricted free agent after this season. If the team acquires Jokiharju from Buffalo, it should come with a new deal for this player. Here’s a look at the numbers from Puck IQ against each level of competition so far in the 2024-25 season: All numbers five-on-five, via Puck IQ Jokiharju plays a significant amount against elite competition (ranks No. 2 in terms of percentage of individual ice time) and has delivered solid results. His playing style (impressive skater and puck mover, with passing a strength) fits with Darnell Nurse on a possible second pairing, and it’s also plausible that Jokiharju could slide up to the top pairing with Mattias Ekholm should Evan Bouchard struggle or have an injury. That kind of depth on the right side of the defence is a strong need for Edmonton if the goal of winning the Stanley Cup is to be realized. The cost would be dear. Jokiharju would be a strong option for Edmonton, especially with a contract extension signed as part of the trade. This may be news to some, but Moser’s performance in his new NHL city is notable and probably of great value to a team like Edmonton. The downbeat? It’s also valuable for his current team. Advertisement Puck IQ has Moser playing significant minutes versus elites in all three of his seasons with the Arizona Coyotes, and that trend continues this season with the Lightning. The difference this season? Moser’s DFF percentage (smart Corsi, similar to expected goals) is 51 percent and his actual goal share (all numbers five-on-five) is 58 percent. He’s flourishing in his first sojourn with a contender. His performance against elites is part of an impressive resume this year. He’s 24, left-handed and is signed for this and next season at $3.375 million. Tampa Bay gave up a big asset (Mikhail Sergachev) in the deal to acquire him, and Moser is paired most often with Victor Hedman. There’s no doubt playing with Hedman has zoomed Moser’s numbers, but the Oilers have a defenceman (Ekholm) who can impact possession numbers, too. He’s a significant part of a contender, and that would raise the price. There’s no evidence Moser is available for trade, meaning he is more of a target than an attainable piece. The Lightning have posted a strong start but play in a tight division. Tampa Bay has considerable depth so a deal isn’t beyond reason. After trading defenceman Jack Thompson at the 2024 deadline, the Lightning are without a top-tier prospect on the blue line. It’s possible a deal around Akey could be considered if Tampa Bay management feels there’s enough quality at the NHL level. It’s also possible Akey falls shy of the mark. Edmonton has a specific need, and as the Bowman interview with Nugent-Bowman shows the team is also looking at other areas of the roster for possible improvement. Names like Nick Jensen (veteran right-handed defenceman playing with the Ottawa Senators this season) and Brandon Carlo (Boston Bruins stalwart for almost a decade) may be in play at the deadline, and those players will get traded for value if their general managers decide to move them. Advertisement For Bowman, there must be a clear line between rental price (second-round picks or lower, mid-level prospects and unsigned European draft picks) and names that have a real chance to play a feature role in Edmonton over the next several seasons. The value of keeping his powder dry won’t be lost on Bowman. The interview in The Athletic with Nugent-Bowman acknowledges the organization lacks top-end trade pieces in order to make the kind of trades Ken Holland made not long ago. The Ekholm acquisition is an example of a deal that is probably out of reach for Bowman at this time. On the other hand, Bowman will know the value of an additional year for all of the impact prospects in his system. Another year for Savoie could mean NHL time on a feature line and a higher trade profile. It could also allow Bowman to offload a veteran top-six winger and replace him long-term with Savoie. O’Reilly is exactly the player-type Edmonton needs badly on the NHL team. A two-way centre who is RH and can score, outscore and play a rugged style. O’Reilly’s only downside is the gap between today and the moment he makes a difference in the NHL. That gap could be four years, and Bowman must factor that into the equation. As it pertains to the two names above, Akey would be an asset Bowman could consider dealing. The team already has its impact puck mover and power-play quarterback (Bouchard) who should be here through the end of the decade and beyond. The Oilers roster will have needs in the next two years in important spots on the defence. Ekholm and Brett Kulak are unrestricted free agents in the summer of 2026, and a player like Moser might be able to help. It’s unlikely he’ll fill all of the minutes required, but it would be an astute addition in an area that could be a major need in the days to come. Moser isn’t expensive now, and will still be a restricted free agent at the end of his current deal. Advertisement There isn’t much actively available across the NHL for Bowman on defence, and even less that might warrant trading the 2026 first-round pick, Savoie, O’Reilly or Akey. Jokiharju and Moser do represent quality, with some risk, in this area. Up next: Forwards. (Photo of Henri Jokiharju: Timothy T. Ludwig / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Tottenham Hotspur 1 Fulham 1: Solanke missed, Forster impresses but Spurs remain inconsistent",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5955176/2024/12/01/tottenham-fulham-draw-briefing/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 15:35:50 GMT",Jack Pitt-Brooke and Jay Harris break down the key moments from Tottenham's game against Fulham,"EPL In keeping with their inconsistent form this season, Tottenham followed up last week’s stunning victory over Manchester City with a 1-1 draw against a Fulham team which played out the latter part of the second half with 10 men. Without summer signing Dominic Solanke, who was sent home on the morning of the match because of illness, Spurs initially struggled to puncture Fulham’s defence. A second-half volley from Brennan Johnson put the hosts ahead, but Fulham were soon level as the visitors deservedly scored — Tom Cairney’s fine curling effort left Fraser Forster with no chance in the home goal. Advertisement That Tottenham secured a point had much to do with Forster’s fine performance. The goalkeeper — making his first league appearance since May 2023 — was instrumental in ensuring the home team went into the break level at 0-0 and made two fine saves from Issa Diop and Alexander Iwobi at the start of the second half. With Fulham down to 10 men after Cairney’s red card, Tottenham were unable to make the most of the advantage. Cairney was initially shown a yellow but after referee Darren Bond went to the VAR, the Fulham goalscorer was shown a straight red for his challenge on Dejan Kulusevski.  Jack Pitt-Brooke and Jay Harris break down the action. This was always going to be a difficult day for Tottenham after Solanke was too ill to play. That meant Spurs had to turn to Son Heung-min to lead the line inside. It was just the second time this season Son has started as the No 9. Much of this game was a reminder of how important Solanke is to Tottenham. His ability to hold onto the ball under pressure and link with team-mates is integral to how Spurs want to play. And Son, for all his strengths, cannot do that. Spurs struggled to keep the ball in Fulham’s half, Son often losing it in the tackle. This made it hard for Spurs to create anything and their best chances came from set pieces or on the break. One of those breaks early in the second half led to Spurs’ goal, with Johnson volleying in Timo Werner’s cross. But Spurs could never truly be themselves without the reference point of Solanke up front. They will need him back and fit as soon as possible. Jack Pitt-Brooke A few things have changed since Forster’s last appearance for Tottenham in the Premier League. Back then, in May 2023, Ryan Mason was interim head coach following Antonio Conte’s dismissal. Five of the players who started that 4-1 victory over Leeds United are no longer at Spurs while the style of play has been completely transformed under Ange Postecoglou. Advertisement Forster might have been returning to a familiar competition but he needed to play in a completely different way against Fulham. While Guglielmo Vicario recovers from ankle surgery, Forster will be expected to help Spurs build up attacks. The 36-year-old has played in cup competitions, including Thursday’s 2-2 draw with Roma in the Europa League, but executing that in the Premier League would be a much tougher challenge. He was comfortable receiving the ball from his defenders on multiple occasions against Fulham but in the 39th minute his pass towards Yves Bissouma was intercepted and led to Raul Jimenez having a shot that was blocked. Drawing with Fulham was disappointing for Spurs but it would have been worse without Forster. While the rest of the team struggled, he was one of their best players and produced a series of impressive saves. In the space of two minutes at the start of the second half, he prevented Diop and Iwobi from scoring at close-range. He denied Jimenez several times but there was nothing he could do about Cairney’s powerful drive. Nevertheless, over the last week, Forster has shown enough to suggest that Spurs should be fine while Vicario is absent. Jay Harris After Tottenham’s stunning 4-0 victory over Manchester City at the Etihad, the entire fanbase knew that they could only truly start getting excited about this side’s progression again if they beat Fulham. Spurs have been exceptional at times this season, including in the victories over Manchester United, West Ham United and Aston Villa, but will often follow it up with a sluggish performance. They had an opportunity to break this frustrating habit on Sunday afternoon and prove to everybody that they are heading in the right direction. A victory over Fulham would have put them one point behind fourth-placed Brighton. Advertisement Instead, the cycle continued. Club-record signing Solanke was unavailable due to illness and Spurs missed his presence upfront. Son struggles to hold up the ball and press opposition defenders as effectively as his team-mate. Kulusevski was dropped to the bench to manage his workload and without his driving forward runs Tottenham were less threatening. Postecoglou does not tend to moan about injuries but he was without four of his regular starting XI (Micky van de Ven, Cristian Romero, Solanke and Vicario) while a fifth was on the bench. Maybe the grind of competing in the Europa League, Carabao Cup and the Premier League is taking its toll more than he wants to admit. The counter argument is that Postecoglou took too long to make substitutions against Fulham. Pedro Porro struggled throughout the second half after an awkward slip but stayed on, while Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall did not come on until the 83rd minute. Kulusevski, their best player this season, came on after Fulham’s equaliser but went up front instead of in central midfield where he has been so influential this season. Tottenham continue to confuse everybody and there is still a lot of room for improvement. Jay Harris  On why Spurs can’t replicate the performance against Manchester City every week, Postecoglou said: “If you can’t see that even in seven days, we’ve copped a couple of significant blows since then I think it’s too easy to say ‘let’s just play like we did against Man City every game.’ And it somehow again seems with this club that whenever it is that we do well is then used as a millstone to bring us down at every other opportunity.  “From my perspective, it’s really important that we don’t react to any of that and just stay focused, because I just sometimes feel like, especially the players we’ve got at the moment, they’re just really working really hard for this football club to try and progress as to where we want to be. We’re in good shape, we’re still in good shape, we’re still in a decent position in the league. We’re still in the Carabao Cup, we’re in a decent position in Europe, so it’s about us maintaining our focus on continuing to develop.” Advertisement On Solanke’s late withdrawal, the manager said: “It doesn’t help… From my perspective the players, the ones who are out there anyways, have given absolutely everything and that is all you can ask for. They are working their socks off and digging in as deep as they can to try to keep us progressing.” Postecoglou on Forster’s performance: “He was good. We needed him obviously in some big moments, and when you lose your goalkeeper and somebody as significant as Vic (Guglielmo Vicario) for us, I think the key to that is to have somebody experienced who’s not going to be sort of overawed by filling those shoes. Fraser, certainly, he’s done it for a number of years. We see him every day. What you saw out there, we see every day training and he still has a really strong work ethic and we had a couple of big moments which were important for us and again, he will be important moving forward.” Thursday, December 5: Bournemouth (A), Premier League, 8.15pm GMT, 3.15pm ET (Top image: Henry Nicholls/AFP via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Manchester United 4 Everton 0: Amorim's rotation strikes gold and Zirkzee ends drought in style,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5955164/2024/12/01/manchester-united-4-everton-0-the-briefing/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 15:34:11 GMT",Our writers analyse and evaluate the key talking points from Manchester United's comfortable victory over Everton,"EPL Manchester United thrashed Everton 4-0 at Old Trafford to pick up their first Premier League win under new head coach Ruben Amorim. Two goals each from Marcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee eased the hosts to a comfortable victory that moves them into the top half of the table after 13 games. Amorim made several changes to his line-up following the 3-2 defeat of Bodo/Glimt here in the Europa League on Thursday and it proved sensible as United ran out easy winners. Advertisement There was also a pre-match protest by fans concerning the club’s recently-announced rise in ticket prices, which included chants aimed at minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Here, our writers analyse the key moments in the match.  One noticeable difference between Amorim and predecessor Erik ten Hag comes in their approach to rotation. Where former Ajax manager Ten Hag opted to use many of the same players week in and week out to build player chemistry and “automatisms”, the new man has opted to rotate his options in order to preserve player fitness. The recent arrival from Lisbon’s Sporting CP made six changes from the starting XI that beat Glimt in midweek. Zirkzee came in for Rasmus Hojlund up front, the 23-year-old Netherlands international making his first league start since the 3-0 home defeat against Tottenham Hotspur in late September. Rashford, Diogo Dalot, Amad, Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro also stepped into the team. On paper, it was a lineup that should have been too much for an Everton side who do not carry much attacking threat. However, United were out of sync and off-colour for the majority of the first half. The opening 20 minutes saw Amorim flip between two characters on the touchline; one of frustration at how Everton could regain possession and one of contemplation, often kneeling to try to figure out passing angles (similar to how Marcelo Bielsa or Mauricio Pochettino operate during games). Everton counterpart Sean Dyche appeared to have taken tips from Ipswich’s Kieran McKenna on how to impede United, following last weekend’s 1-1 draw with the latter at Portman Road. The Goodison Park side clogged midfield, making it difficult for Amorim’s men to progress through the centre. Dalot and Amad had difficulty beating their respective markers and getting into the final third out wide. Advertisement Despite all that, United found a foothold in the game in the 34th minute, when Bruno Fernandes’ corner found Rashford in space on the edge of the penalty area. Rashford’s shot looked on target, and he’s been credited with the goal, but Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite’s big toe made certain of things and poked it home. The goal steadied nerves and allowed United – who have been a confidence team for some time – to establish dominance. Amorim’s approach to rotation eventually came good, but it needed a bit of help at first. Carl Anka What to make of Zirkzee? The Dutchman is a curious attacking player, built like a traditional centre-forward and target man, but preferring to drop deep and link the play. He has never been a prolific goalscorer, but a return of one goal in his previous 18 matches for United (he scored in the first game of the season) had some of their fans worried. What would Amorim do with a low-in-confidence, non-goalscoring striker? The answer seemed rooted in the players the new coach put in the team around the £42.5million ($54.1m) summer buy. Rashford and Fernandes were deployed as the two No 10s off Zirkzee, which made a lot of sense as they are two players who relish running in behind defences. On several occasions, the Dutchman dropped deep, pulling a marker away while his team-mates would push on ahead. Add to this, the potent threat of Amad at right wing-back and Zirkzee had increased opportunities to play in those running on ahead of him. Those team-mates responded in kind by playing the 23-year-old in when he was late arriving into the box. United’s second goal was born from Amad hustling Branthwaite into losing possession, while Everton attempted the build from the back. Fernandes pounced on the ball and ran into the penalty area before pulling it back to a grateful Zirkzee. The game’s fourth also came from Amad stealing the ball from an opposition centre-back, this time from James Tarkowski, before driving into the area and teeing up Zirkzee again. The goals brought welcome relief for a player who has had difficulty adjusting to the increased pace and scrutiny of life in the Premier League following his transfer from Bologna of Italy’s Serie A. Zirkzee’s passing — previously his strong point — had gone awry in the early weeks of his debut United season, and he appeared slow to release the ball in the final third.  A good goal can do wonders for a striker however, and Zirkzee spent much of today’s second half rediscovering the flicks and tricks that caught attention when he was at Bologna. He might not yet displace Hojlund in Amorim’s strongest XI, but he has shown he has some goalscoring threat to offer the team. Carl Anka While it was two goals apiece for Rashford and Zirkzee, the man of the match award belonged to Amad. The Ivorian was exemplary from right wing-back, a creative force when in possession and a professional pest when out of it. United’s second and fourth goals were born from him hustling and harrying Everton defenders for the ball. Advertisement And United’s third — scored 20 seconds into the second half — saw Zirkzee release the 22-year-old down their right, before Amad slipped in Rashford to apply the final touches. It’s clear that United’s forwards enjoy playing with Amad. After his reintroduction to the starting XI under recent interim manager Ruud van Nistelrooy, Fernandes spent several games trying to feed the ball to him, curious to see what the youngster could conjure in the final third. Amorim electing to use Amad as a wing-back rather than as a No 10 raised question marks from some, but — despite his size — he has managed to remain an attacking threat, able to wriggle through tight spaces with the ball and make the correct pass more times than not. Amad’s football intelligence can occasionally take team-mates by surprise. Where many United forwards might rush at goal or lose the ball attempting to beat three defenders at once, he appreciates the value of slowing things down. Moments after scoring United’s third, Rashford sprinted at full pace towards Amad, hoping to offer an overlapping run and launch another fast break. But as the England forward approached, he put his hand out in a “slow down” gesture, and worked to recycle the ball back into midfield. A diminutive playmaker who makes the forwards around him better on both sides of the ball, Amad could play a key role for Amorim in the weeks and months to come. Carl Anka This was United’s first Premier League outing since the announcement of Old Trafford’s mid-season price hike, with all tickets for the remainder of the campaign costing £66 ($84), and concession pricing eliminated. GO DEEPER INEOS arrived at Man Utd on a wave of goodwill but ticket price rises put that at risk Around 300 supporters gathered at the Trinity Statue outside the stadium an hour before kick-off to protest against the change as part of a campaign run in conjunction with Manchester City, Liverpool and Everton fans, under a banner reading ‘Stop Exploiting Loyalty’. And interestingly, new co-owner Ratcliffe was as much a target of their ire as the Glazer family, the club’s long-time majority owners, and the subject of several unflattering chants. But then this move on ticket prices was a call by staff from his INEOS empire and its first major flashpoint with the supporters since Ratcliffe’s minority ownership began. Advertisement There was more dissent inside the ground during the game and if fan groups are right to fear that this price hike is the thin end of the wedge, then Ratcliffe may look back on it as where INEOS’ honeymoon period ended. Mark Critchley Speaking to the BBC after the match, Amorim said: “It was far from a perfect performance. We have to improve, you can feel that in the game. After 15 minutes, Everton controlled the game and it was difficult for us and we were losing the second ball. I felt the players could solve some (of the) problems that we have as a team because of the quality they have. (It was) a really good result and tough match. And when asked about Amad, the Portuguese manager responded: “He is really big in talent, but small in size. He did a great job and is (in) a great moment. Ruud van Nistelrooy helped him a lot in his games in charge and now he’s helping me.” Wednesday, December 4: Arsenal (A), Premier League, 8.15pm GMT, 3.15pm ET (Top photo: Gareth Copley/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Chelsea 3 Aston Villa 0: The Palmer press, Fofana concern - and are Chelsea contenders?",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5955133/2024/12/01/chelsea-fofana-palmer-jackson-villa/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 15:30:44 GMT",Enzo Maresca's side maintained their impressive progress this season with their attacking play continuing to thrill Stamford Bridge,"EPL The summit is still a fair way off but, if this rich vein of form is maintained over the hectic schedule this month, Chelsea will force themselves into any conversation centring on the Premier League title race. This impressive victory over Aston Villa hoisted them back level with Arsenal — long considered contenders, and above them only on away goals scored in head-to-head matches — and a run of one defeat in 12 league games points to rare consistency. They remain a vibrant attacking force, with Cole Palmer’s first goal in over a month a reminder of the threat they pose from all quarters. They had far too much for a vulnerable Villa side and the only sour note centred on Wesley Fofana, who hobbled off in the second half. Advertisement Otherwise, this was comfortable. The tone was set early thanks to Nicolas Jackson’s smartly taken goal, volleying Marc Cucurella’s deflected cross in off the post. Other opportunities had been passed up before Enzo Fernandez smashed in the hosts’ second with the outside of his right foot just after a slickly constructed move. There was the occasional pang of anxiety before Palmer’s third, particularly when Ollie Watkins forced Robert Sanchez into smart saves. But Chelsea always felt they had enough to prevail. Liam Twomey and Anantaajith Raghuraman dissect the key talking points from Stamford Bridge. Please don’t leave, because this isn’t what you think it is. Chelsea are, by any traditional metric, not remotely credible Premier League title contenders. This win puts them on pace for 73 points, which is two fewer than the lowest-ever tally recorded by a champion in the competition’s history (Manchester United in 1996-97). Maresca’s squad is also, as detailed by The Athletic last week, almost three years younger than the average age of the last 10 winners. Heading into this weekend, Opta’s supercomputer projected Chelsea to have a lower than one per cent chance of ending up as champions — and a higher probability of finishing eighth in May. Most importantly, even a win here only put them six points off the top of the table before Liverpool and Manchester City kicked off at Anfield. Yet they are level with Arsenal, who unequivocally came into this season with serious aspirations of Premier League title contention. Whether that says more about Chelsea, Arsenal or this peculiar season as a whole depends on your point of view. Liverpool have carried themselves to this point like a team minded to wrap up the title race before the turn of the year, but will it really be so easy for Arne Slot in his first season in English football? Or is the adversity still ahead for them? If it is, all kinds of unexpected conversations may need to be had. Maybe it would mean City could still win a fifth Premier League title in a row, despite enduring a losing run in the autumn that felt like the end of a dynasty. Maybe it means Arsenal finally get over the hump despite a relatively pedestrian first third of the campaign. Or maybe it means Chelsea find themselves sitting at the big boys’ table before Maresca or anyone else expects them to.   On paper, Villa at home was one of Chelsea’s most difficult games in a highly favourable remainder of 2024. Maresca will not encourage any talk of title contention, but the mere fact that the questions will keep coming in press conferences is an indicator of welcome progress. Liam Twomey After three league matches without a goal or assist, Cole Palmer managed one of each on Sunday, setting up Fernandez with a well-weighted pass in the first half to double the hosts’ lead before curling in a spectacular third nine minutes from time. That made him the second-quickest Chelsea player to register 30 Premier League goals for the club (in 46 games, five behind Jimmy-Floyd Hasselbaink’s record). Advertisement He also showed several glimpses of his quality in possession with deft touches and needle-threading passes, and won a couple of useful free kicks along the way. But prior to his offensive contributions, Chelsea benefited significantly from Palmer disrupting Villa’s build-up play by shadowing Youri Tielemans whenever the visitors attempted to play out from the back. This led to a couple of high turnovers resulting in shots in the opening 25 minutes, including the bizarre sequence that resulted in the award of an indirect free kick inside the box after Emi Martinez picked up the ball from Pau Torres’ touch. It was not a flawless out-of-possession performance from Palmer, though. Some of Villa’s best openings came when Tielemans escaped the England forward’s clamps to release a team-mate, but these were low in number — indicating Palmer did a difficult job well with ample support from Moises Caicedo and Romeo Lavia at his back. Anantaajith Raghuraman On the hour mark Wesley Fofana heard a familiar sound, and one he has come to dread: sympathetic applause, rippling around Stamford Bridge as he raised himself gingerly to his feet and limped slowly towards the tunnel, holding back tears and accepting a hug from substitute Joao Felix. Tracking the relentless runs of Watkins was always going to be an exacting test of his joints, muscles and ligaments, but it was treading on the football that prematurely ended Fofana’s afternoon — the most occupational of hazards for a professional footballer. He clearly felt something ping. Precisely what will be important for the timeframe of his rehabilitation — the early assessment was a hamstring issue and, potentially, a month on the sidelines — but not for what it means in the moment: another dispiriting setback in his attempt to rebuild some career momentum, another spell on the sidelines, another unwanted opportunity for he and Reece James to empathise with each other’s misfortune. Fofana has been one of the more encouraging Chelsea stories this season. His fledgling partnership with Levi Colwill shows real promise despite never sailing to a clean sheet, and his numerous physical problems do not seem to have limited his lightning pace or dazzling vertical leap. But the ominous disclaimer was voiced by Maresca in October when he revealed that Fofana will likely need to play with pain for the rest of his career — a startling thing to hear about any 23-year-old footballer. Advertisement This is and will remain part of the Fofana story moving forward, along with the excellent recovery tackles, thrilling carries out of defence and towering headed clearances. Chelsea need to value whenever he is available and plan for whenever he is not. Liam Twomey Jackson’s strike on Sunday was his eighth of the league season in 13 games, already more than half of his 14-goal haul from last season. He displayed fantastic movement to meet and turn in Cucurella’s cross in the seventh minute after the Spaniard won the ball high up the pitch. The finish was even more accomplished given the delivery flicked up off Matty Cash, forcing the striker to readjust. Jackson had two more shots (one on target), improving his season shooting accuracy to 65 per cent and shot-to-goal conversion rate to 26 per cent, up from 51 and 18 per cent last season. Those may not be sustainable but are fantastic numbers for a player who was criticised for his profligacy last season. While adding a consistent final product, Jackson has continued to impress with his hold-up play, which provided Chelsea with a way to bypass Villa’s midfield. It was evident in the build-up to Fernandez’s goal as Jackson dragged a defender with him to meet Colwill’s pass, which eventually found its way to Palmer who set up Fernandez with John McGinn and Tielemans out of position. So, 13 games in, this is shaping up to be the most productive season yet of Jackson’s young senior career. Anantaajith Raghuraman On Fofana’s injury: “It’s unfortunately bad news. It was a hamstring problem, and with this kind of things it’s at least three, four, five weeks. That in this moment means he loses 10 games, 12 games. The way he was playing it’s a big loss for us, but we have more players and we will try to find solutions. Advertisement “It’s a big loss. He’s doing fantastic, but it’s normal when you play this amount of games. Fortunately it was his first injury this season, but we will find a solution.” Are Chelsea title contenders? “I do not agree with that. We are not ready to compete with Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City for many reasons. Because we win today, I am not going to change my idea. We are not ready for that. The good thing is we are improving. Soon, hopefully we can be there.” Wednesday, December 4: Southampton (A), Premier League, 7.30pm GMT, 2.30pm ET (Top photo: Chloe Knott – Danehouse/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The Longhorns beat their in-state rival 17-7 on Saturday night, thanks to the nation’s No. 3 scoring defense, which held the Aggies without an offensive touchdown. Texas nearly doubled up Texas A&M in total yards and dominated in the trenches, holding Aggies dual-threat quarterback Marcel Reed in check for much of the night and running for 243 yards.

That was the goal coming into [this season]. It doesn't matter what conference we're in, our goal is to be champions year in and year out. That's the standard here at the University of Texas, and that won't ever change."" ""Our defense was fantastic all night. They really shut them out. They got the one interception on the tipped ball for the lone touchdown, but our defense was fantastic all night long."" ""We challenged [our offense] about a month ago that our run game had to get going. This guy right here [Quintrevion Wisner] has been a warrior, man, this last month. Just love what the O-line's doing, the tight end, and this guy's brought a lot of heart to this unit.""  The Texas Longhorn defense showed why it is one of the best in college football this season.  Defensive coordinator Pete Kwiatkowski's unit allowed only 248 yards of offense to Texas A&M tonight in a 17-7 road victory. It marked the 11th time in 12 games that the Longhorns allowed less than 300 yards of offense this season.  Texas also registered two takeaways at Kyle Field, keeping the Longhorns in the top-10 nationally in forced turnovers (2.2 per game).  IMAGN Aside from some brief skirmishes, the renewal of the Texas-Texas A&M rivalry did not get overly heated away from the action on the field.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Jamie Gittens: How Dortmund 'golden boy' is becoming one of Europe's most destructive players,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5958867/2024/12/01/jamie-gittens-borussia-dortmund-bayern-munich/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 12:57:43 GMT","Dortmund's 20-year-old English forward is at an exciting moment in his career, with each match revealing something new about his game","Bundesliga Arise, Jamie Gittens. A young career that has been gently picking up momentum in the Bundesliga burst into the mainstream on Saturday. Borussia Dortmund did not beat Bayern Munich at the Westfalenstadion — it finished as a 1-1 draw — but Gittens lit up German football’s biggest club game with a fabulous first-half goal, becoming the first player to score against Bayern in eight games. Advertisement Dortmund could not hold onto the lead as Jamal Musiala equalised late in the second half to maintain Bayern’s unbeaten start to the domestic season and move them seven points clear at the top of the table before second-placed Eintracht Frankfurt play later today. Nevertheless, Gittens authored the match’s signature moment, beating Konrad Laimer with a cute piece of skill, before racing half the length of the pitch to score past Manuel Neuer. What a goal. What a moment. Gittens has certainly captured the imagination of the German media: Bild, the country’s biggest tabloid, described him as a “goldjunge” — golden boy. Kicker, the football website, referred to him as an “unterschiedsspieler” — or difference-making player. So, this feels like a significant moment. Gittens was born in London, raised in Reading, a commuter town just west of the English capital, and is still only 20 years old. He has been at Dortmund for four years, since leaving Manchester City for €90,000 (£74,900/$95,200 at current exchange rates) in summer 2020, and has been quietly developing outside the Premier League hothouse. Occasionally, his goals and highlights have piqued interest back home. He has even tapped politely on the door of the England national team once or twice. Now, it’s really more of a steady banging. England’s next manager Thomas Tuchel will start work at St George’s Park in a month’s time and one of his first orders of business might be to conclude that Gittens’ abilities — his beguiling skill, his two-footed finishing and his blazing speed — are just too intriguing to ignore. Gittens’ start to life in Dortmund was frustrating. After arriving during the pandemic he missed, cumulatively, almost an entire year of football through a succession of shoulder and ankle injuries. Dortmund have always thought highly of him and have been privately bullish about his potential. It’s only really over the past 18 months, though, that theory has become reality. Cameo performances last season have turned into more pronounced impact in the early months of this one. Gittens has been a much more consistent starter under Nuri Sahin, who was appointed Dortmund head coach in the summer, and he has responded with form, confidence and — ultimately — production. Advertisement “His development is great,” Lars Ricken, Dortmund’s chief executive for sport told The Athletic before the game against Bayern. “When we signed him, it was really a cooperation between our scouting, professional and youth departments. He perhaps wasn’t on the level of someone like Jadon Sancho (who made the same move from City’s academy to Dortmund in summer 2017), but we said, ‘OK, we can develop him into a great player’. I think he made his debut under Marco Rose (in April 2022), but since then it’s been great development, especially this season. I think last season he never played 90 minutes, but he has improved his playing time and, to be honest, he’s now a player who makes a difference.” A few hours later, speaking after the match, Ricken was more effusive. “Jamie is doing an outstanding job,” he said. “He was a standout, including in the way he helped Ramy (Bensebaini, Dortmund’s left-back) in defence. He has developed into a real difference maker with his goals and assists.” There it was again: unterschiedsspieler. He is playing in an imperfect Dortmund side who are still adjusting to Sahin’s coaching. He and they still have work to do. But, one-on-one, Gittens is already one of the most destructive players in European football. Fbref.com ranks him in the 99th percentile (so only one per cent of players in the top five domestic leagues, Champions League and Europa League are better) for goal-creating actions when taking on an opponent (0.33 per 90 minutes). His 4.08 successful take-ons per 90 minutes rates him in the 98th percentile. His progressive carries, carries into the final third and carries into the penalty area are in the 93rd, 93rd and 95th percentile respectively. Binary description though they may be, but it’s certainly compelling. Gittens in time will hopefully add a true ruthlessness to his game, but his trajectory is steep enough. So much so, that comparisons are inevitable. Advertisement Being an Englishman in Dortmund comes with certain associations. The more attention he gets, the more likely it becomes that he will be labelled the new this or that. Sancho and Jude Bellingham are still fresh in the mind. Truthfully though, he is not comparable to either; three different footballers, three different people and players. Gittens is a game-breaker. More so than anybody in the current Dortmund squad, he influences matches — often out of nowhere with exhilarating bursts. There’s something quite old-fashioned about him. If the Westfalenstadion still had wooden seats, you would hear them clatter shut whenever he touches the ball, as supporters stand in anticipation. There is an intent and purpose to the way he plays; a real ambition. The goal against Bayern on Saturday was a fine example of that. Back to goal, receiving a pass inside his own half, there ought to have been no danger for Laimer. And yet a drop of the shoulder, a stepover, and Gittens was gone, racing away towards an unguarded Neuer. It would be easy to criticise Laimer and, yes, perhaps he was too tight to his man and too quick to buy the dummy, but from that point on, what could anyone really do? Gittens carries the ball at such speed, that Bayern’s only hope — even with 40 yards between him and the goal — was that Neuer would make the save. He did not. Gittens beat him high and comprehensively. It was an overwhelming passage of play. A marriage of technical and athletic ability that, this season, has become a recurrent theme. Last week, during a 3-0 away win against Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League, he opened the scoring with a dart infield and a savage hit that thundered into the top corner. Last month, amid the wreckage of a 5-2 loss to Real Madrid in the same competition, the surge he made to the back post to give his team a 2-0 lead in the Bernabeu was forgotten. A shame, because in recognising the opportunity ahead of Real’s defenders and racing into space to convert Donyell Malen’s cross, he produced another one of those moments — smart and incendiary, where there had seemed little danger. The real Gittens trademark has been seen three times already this season. Against Frankfurt on the Bundesliga’s opening weekend. Versus Club Brugge in the Champions League in September. And, most recently, during a 4-0 win over Freiburg a week ago. Advertisement Three goals, all scored in the same way: squared up against a lone defender, his feet blurring over the ball, Gittens feinted to the left before driving to the right and, with almost no backlift, fired a shot hard across the goalkeeper and in. That move has an Eden Hazard-like quality to it; like Hazard in his prime, Gittens’ feet move so quickly that defenders are always a split-second behind, and never able to get in position to block the shot. This is heady praise and it should really be tempered. Another chance against Bayern, at the start of the second half, was squandered. There are times, too, when Gittens puts the ball at risk or is too ambitious in taking defenders on. He does not yet dominate whole games, either, and he is yet to show he can have a strong, steady influence over an entire season. But this is an exciting moment in a career. A young player, choosing an alternative path through the game, and learning how to best apply his extravagant abilities. It means that most games he plays seem to reveal something new — a touch, a turn, the capacity to hurt a higher standard of opponent. Add Bayern to a growing list.

Botafogo midfielder Gregore was shown a red card just 30 seconds into the final for a high kick to the head of Fausto Vera, but goals from Luiz Henrique, Alex Telles and Junior Santos guided Artur Jorge’s side to a remarkable victory in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Advertisement Luiz Henrique scored from inside the area in the 35th minute before former Manchester United defender Telles double their lead from the penalty spot a minute before the break after former Real Betis forward Henrique was fouled inside the area by Atletico keeper Everson. Atletico’s Eduardo Vargas, a half-time substitute, scored with his first touch as he headed home from Hulk’s corner but despite 10-man Botafogo visibly tiring, Atletico could not force an equaliser — Vargas spurned a one-on-one opportunity late on to leave Atletico’s manager Gabriel Milito sunken to his knees inside the dugout. Botafogo wrapped up their victory in dramatic circumstances with a rare counter-attack as substitute Santos scored from close-range in the seventh minute of added time. Botafogo are hoping to win just their third Brazilian Serie A title, and their first since 1995, as they lead Palmeiras by three points at the top of the standings with two rounds of matches remaining. Botafogo’s triumph ensures they are the 32nd and final team to qualify for the newly-expanded FIFA Club World Cup. They will be one of four Brazilian clubs to participate, alongside recent Copa Libertadores winners Palmeiras, Flamengo and Fluminense. Argentinean clubs River Plate and Boca Juniors have also qualified courtesy of their ranking. Botafogo will also play in this year’s FIFA Intercontinental Cup, where they will play Mexican club Pachuca at Stadium 974 in Qatar on December 11, with the victors to play Al Ahly in the semi-final, with Real Madrid then awaiting the victors in the final.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"The USWNT needs 'to build better connections'. Fortunately, that may be straightforward",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5959670/2024/12/01/england-women-uswnt-reaction/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 12:06:55 GMT","Against England, the USWNT failed to score for the second time under Emma Hayes, but there are reasons to be positive about the attack","International Football With the game goalless at Wembley on 86 minutes, United States full-back Emily Fox waltzed into the England penalty area. It was then that Emma Hayes was confronted with an alarming realization. “I look, and there’s no one in the box,” U.S. women’s national team manager Hayes said of that sequence of play in Saturday’s 0-0 friendly with England. “Our mentality has to be better than that. That’s what I will be demanding from the team.” Advertisement The sight of Fox’s tempting cross fizzing across the goal only to be scooped up benignly by goalkeeper Mary Earps told a story: for the second time in Hayes’ brief tenure, her side had failed to score in a match. Not that this is a horror story. The world’s top-ranked team do not have a goalscoring problem. In their three previous friendlies — last month against Iceland (a double-header) and Argentina — the team scored three goals in each, totting up an aggregate score of 9-2. In the 13 matches Hayes presided over before facing England, the USWNT scored 28 times, a healthy average of just over twice a game. But, the key question heading into an away meeting with the European champions and No.2-ranked team in the world was how would the new Olympic champions fare without the self-ascribed “Triple Espresso” of Sophia Smith, Trinity Rodman and Mal Swanson? Hayes’ goal-plundering trio have been left out of the November camp to recover from minor injuries after the recent culmination of the NWSL season. In their absence, the USWNT attack was less defined, but it did present the manager with another opportunity to audition others as she continues her post-Paris 2024 evolution. The last time Rodman, Smith and Swanson started a match together was that Olympic final against Brazil in early August. In the three friendlies since, Hayes named three different front lines with varying degrees of experience. In the Iceland games, Hayes fielded front threes with combined caps total of more than 100, while against Argentina that figure dropped to 49. Sarina Wiegman’s England, however, posed a more exacting test. And as Hayes named a different front three in her starting XI for the fourth match in a row — this time, it was Alyssa Thompson, Lynn Williams and Emma Sears — the disjointed chemistry and inexperience of Thompson (12th cap) and Sears (third), alongside 31-year-old Williams (74th), was pronounced. GO DEEPER England 0, USWNT 0 takeaways: New-look front three offer promise, if not goals Despite registering 40 touches in the box (to England’s 14) and edging possession (54 per cent to 46), the visitors struggled to convert their dominance into goals. Of the USWNT’s 10 shots at goal, only three were on target; all in the first half and from around the edge of the penalty area. Earps deserves praise for producing two diving saves to deny Thompson and Casey Krueger, but too often the final pass by the Americans was for want, leaving a slick passage of play spluttering in anti-climax. Advertisement While neither Williams nor Thompson registered a shot on target and had only a single attempt at goal each despite playing for the full 90 minutes, a poor midfield performance from Lindsey Horan had a major impact on the attack. Yazmeen Ryan produced a confident second-half performance after replacing Sears at half-time and showed promise in her interplay with Fox and Rose Lavelle. Yet, she too failed to register a single shot. Caveats are required. Barring Williams, none of Hayes’ attacking options had more than 20 caps coming into this camp, and none are above the age of 25. Wiegman also named a back line of veterans: 33-year-old Lucy Bronze (127 England caps), 27-year-old Leah Williamson (51 caps); 31-year-old Alex Greenwood (96 caps) and 27-year-old Jess Carter (38 caps). Breaking through such a defence required a wit and fluency the USWNT lacked on the night. “I’d expect Bronze and Greenwood to have dominant tactical moments, because when you face those experienced players and they want to go one-v-one with you, you’ve got to position yourself properly,” Hayes said. “The decision-making and execution in the final third, that comes with connections. Trin, Mal, Soph, they’re used to them. Lynn, Emma and Alyssa have never played together before. Alyssa and Emma have got work to do after so few caps.” The experience of playing at Wembley for developing attacking players such as Thompson, Sears, Ryan, Jaedyn Shaw and the latter’s fellow 20-year-old Ally Sentnor, who made her debut in the match’s final minutes, is priceless. Equally advantageous is the opportunity to develop various relationships. Against England, the USWNT made 510 passes, where it was only 236 against Brazil in their gold medal final victory. While the increased volume of passes suggests a more dominant performance against England, the performance against Brazil was notable for its reliance on a few key players through which the USWNT played. The USWNT’s pass map against England (provided by Stats Perform, which depicts the “best XI” in successful passes) shows a team actively building new passing connections and partnerships, which will only bode well for the long-term.  A pass map of the USWNT’s performance against England: (1-Naeher; 4-Girma; 6-Lynn Williams; 7-Alyssa Thompson; 10-Horan (Capt.); 14-Emily Sonnett; 16-Rose Lavelle; 17-Coffey; 20-Casey Krueger; 23-Fox; 24-Yazmeen Ryan). “I’m pleased with the progress, the football we’re playing,” said Hayes. “That, for me, is the most pleasing part, but I’m disappointed we didn’t win. I thought we were the better team.” Advertisement The only other time the USWNT failed to score under Hayes was a goalless pre-Olympic friendly against Costa Rica in July, when a front three of Swanson, Rodman and Smith was deployed for just the second time since her appointment. Six matches and an Olympic gold medal each later, the trio had established themselves as an international nightmare for defences, getting 10 of the team’s 12 goals at the Games between them as the U.S. outscored every other competing nation. The takeaway is that seemingly being able to breathe the same pockets of attacking air requires time and space. Hayes knows she has those three aces up her sleeve. For now, she is maximising the time and space afforded between major tournaments to season more of them and tease out an algorithm that will allow her to utilise those players, too. “We know we have to clean things up in the final third,” Lavelle told reporters after the match. “We did well getting there and got some good opportunities, but then didn’t have that final piece. That’s the thing that we have to work on going forward.” (Top photo: Chloe Knott – Danehouse/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,What I saw at Texas-Texas A&M: Scenes from an essential college football rivalry's return,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5959705/2024/12/01/texas-longhorns-aggies-rivalry-kyle-field/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 11:48:46 GMT","Scenes from the long-awaited renewal of the Texas-Texas A&amp;M rivalry, which ended in Longhorns jubilation after days of Aggies anticipation.","NCAAF COLLEGE STATION, Texas — As Aggies silently filed out of Kyle Field, Texas fans in burnt orange filling the southeast corner of The House That Johnny Built rubbed salt in their wounds with three letters. “S-E-C! S-E-C!’ they chanted. Traditionally, the chant has been reserved for programs expressing their superiority to teams that don’t get to wear the patch on their jerseys. Both Texas and Texas A&M wear it now. And Texas capped its maiden voyage through an SEC schedule with a 17-7 win over A&M for the right to do something A&M has never done: Play for the SEC title. Advertisement “Let’s take this s— to Atlanta!” a member of Texas’ equipment staff yelled as they packed up gear on the sidelines in the game’s final minute. Texas is here. And A&M is left dealing with the fallout of a nightmare resumption of one of college football’s most storied rivalries after a ludicrous 13-year absence fueled by the same pettiness that makes the rivalry so unique and special. “You’re little bro!” yelled senior linebacker David Gbenda, who made three tackles for a defense that didn’t allow a point to Texas A&M’s offense in the win. Texas A&M’s only points came on a pick six off a Quinn Ewers pass that was tipped at the line of scrimmage. GO DEEPER Texas A&M's 12-year SEC head start on Texas leads to same nightmare Texas minister of culture Matthew McConaughey, who moonlights as an A-list Hollywood actor, didn’t need to say a word as defensive lineman Vernon Broughton pounced on a game-sealing fumble. He turned to the crowd and flashed a horns up. Minutes earlier, a loud bang rang out from inside a suite as the Longhorns stuffed Amari Daniels for a 3-yard loss on fourth-and-1 on the goal line, keeping the Aggies’ deficit at 10 with 4:36 to play. “Son of a bitch!” a voice echoed through the hall as elevator doors opened. Thirteen years of waiting ended with Texas’ fight song echoing into the chilly Aggieland night. “It sucks,” Texas A&M quarterback Marcel Reed said. Ewers cradled the game ball and smiled as he walked up Texas’ tunnel, unwilling to let anyone else lay a hand on it. “A win is a win,” he said afterward, downplaying the significance of a ball that might be sitting on his mantle a half century from now, marking the only time the senior will ever play his alma mater’s most hated rival. Does Ewers keep the game ball from every win? “I don’t,” he said. “But for some special ones I like to.” GO DEEPER Texas was all business in dominating its Texas A&M rivalry's return All three decks of the east side of Kyle Field are almost full by the time Kanye West’s “Power” kicks in on the PA system, signaling the team’s entrance for yell practice. A&M moved the tradition from midnight to 5:30 p.m. Friday to accommodate the football team’s schedule and allow it to attend. It brings plenty more fans out to the stadium, too. Advertisement Josiah Brantley, one of five Aggie Yell leaders and a senior at A&M, says Friday night is different from all the yell practices he’d attended before. Texas A&M president Mark Welsh III tells the crowd that 58 suite holders asked for their suites to be open for yell practice, which concludes with a lengthy fireworks show. “Tomorrow we get to beat the hell out of Texas,” he says. “I’m not sure life gets better than this.” The game starts in only 25 hours. pic.twitter.com/tiIcftvQm5 — David Ubben (@davidubben) November 29, 2024  Yell leaders, per tradition, take their turns ribbing their rival ahead of Saturday’s game. “Who trashes their own field?” Jake Carter, head yell leader, asks the crowd, referencing Texas’ loss to Georgia earlier this year when Longhorns fans threw garbage onto the field following a controversial call that was later reversed. “Coach Schlossnagle never belonged here anyway,” says yell leader Kyler Fife, igniting the crowd with a shot at the baseball coach who left A&M for Texas this summer. “Tomorrow is personal,” yell leader Grayson Poage says after referring to Texas’ mascot Bevo as a glorified hamburger. “It’s about who runs Texas.” Sweet-smelling smoke wafts through the air from barrels welded into homemade smokers. If the state of Texas had an official smell, it would be beef being cooked low and slow. The closer one gets to Kyle Field on Saturday, homemade smokers dwindle and food trucks take their place. Signs acknowledging every family member’s graduation date hang over many of the tents filling Aggie Park east of the stadium. These two rivals first met in 1894. The old and new clash in a buzzy tailgate scene 130 years later. A QR code hangs on a sign outside the stadium for fans to enroll in a rewards program. A 12th Man sign sponsored by Valero — oil money does make much of what success A&M and Texas enjoy possible — offers an enticing backdrop for Instagram photos. Advertisement A pop-up store sells Lucchese boots, complete with a singer crooning George Strait’s “Amarillo By Morning” through a small speaker. Another sells Mizzen+Main merchandise alongside a banner featuring Texas A&M quarterback Conner Weigman — who was benched last month — as a pitchman. A field is blocked off with “no tailgating” signs. It serves as a fitting playing field for a fitting prologue for Saturday night’s game. There’s no need to pick teams. One side features kids in burnt orange Arch Manning and Quinn Ewers jerseys. The other: Kids wearing maroon 12th Man and No. 2 Johnny Manziel jerseys. The silence of fans walking up the ramp leading to the northwest corner of the stadium is occasionally interrupted by an A&M fan drumming the familiar rhythm of “Hullabaloo, caneck, caneck!” — the opening words of the “Aggie War Hymn” — on a light post along the sidewalk. Reflexively, any Aggie fan in earshot responds with a “Whoop!” Oscar Torres Jr. graduated from Texas A&M in 1977. He went there because he liked the engineering program. He convinced his younger brother Jorge to attend A&M, too. Jorge graduated in 1990. Another brother graduated in 1986. Ten more nephews from the family later graduated from A&M, all convinced by Oscar Jr. On Saturday, he drove five hours to Aggieland from Laredo and sat outside the west side of Kyle Field with a handful of family members drinking Miller Lites and embracing a game they waited more than a decade to see. Oscar Torres III was 19 the last time the two rivals played and remembered sadly walking out of the stadium as Texas fans celebrated. He’s 32 now and graduated in 2014. “This game just permeates everything,” he says. “My neighborhood has a group chat and nobody ever talks sports. But when this game comes around, it’s all everybody is talking about.” There’s a few people outside Kyle. pic.twitter.com/p8s7cy3Rpt — David Ubben (@davidubben) November 30, 2024  Mike Speller, a banker, graduated from Texas in 1991 and flew down from Connecticut in part to see family for Thanksgiving, but also to go to the game with his son, a ninth-grader whose dream school is Texas. They paid $3,600 for a pair of tickets. “We waited to see if tickets were going to get any more reasonable,” he says. “They only got more unreasonable.” Advertisement Mark Rhodes, a psychologist and 1991 graduate of Texas A&M, brought his wife Trish to the game on Friday from Amarillo. They paid $1,600 for their pair on the secondary market. As soon as Texas’ SEC arrival signaled the rivalry was coming back, they decided they were going to be at the renewal. “We would have paid pretty much anything to come to this game,” Trish Rhodes says. “It didn’t matter.” They aren’t alone in their desperation. Texas A&M police say they arrested one fan who ran past security at an entrance. Two more came to the game dressed as construction workers with fake credentials, hard hats and reflective vests. They are arrested for criminal trespassing. Another is removed from the stadium after gaining access with a fake ticket.

An A&M fan in a maroon shirt looks at them and smiles. His shirt featured scripture: Psalm 75:10. “All the horns of the wicked I will cut off,” it reads. GO DEEPER During Texas–Texas A&M impasse, message board warriors kept the rivalry alive Before the game, Texas athletic director Chris Del Conte chats with McConaughey, who paces across the field and pauses to talk briefly with ESPN’s Kirk Herbstreit, who brought his dog Peter to witness history, too. “When I first took the job, my thought was we have to bring this rivalry back,” says Del Conte, who left TCU to become Texas’ AD in 2017. “Everyone loves the game. It’s part of history.” “The SEC was natural for lots of reasons but one of those was rekindling this rivalry,” Texas president Jay Hartzell says. “We started this journey back in 2020. The Longhorns wanted to get this rivalry resumed. To see it finally coming to fruition is fantastic.” Advertisement Texas dominates the first half 17-0, then holds off the Aggies’ comeback bid in the second. After singing “The Eyes of Texas” with the band after the win, some Texas players sprint to midfield and prepare to celebrate on the A&M midfield logo. Security and coach Steve Sarkisian quickly shoo them away. Another Texas cheerleader, seeking space, runs toward midfield with a giant Texas flag. Security stops him. Security made sure to stop him from planting it.  “I know better. I wave it after every game.” pic.twitter.com/RoBusU8t0r — David Ubben (@davidubben) December 1, 2024  “We’re not planting that!” a Texas support staffer yells. “I’m just waving it. I know better than that. I wave it after every game,” the cheerleader says, before doing so. “I just watched Ohio State and Michigan get in a full-fledged brawl in my hotel room today and I just didn’t think it was right,” Sarkisian says. We shouldn’t be on their logo. Shouldn’t be planting any flags on their logo, and I’d like, whenever that day comes, to get the same respect in return.” The fight songs of both schools take a moment to insult the other. A&M’s ball boys wear white “Saw ’em off” hats on the sidelines. The band’s name tags all read “BTHO t.u.” The prevailing tone, however, radiates far less hate and much more excitement. Aside from a few A&M and Texas staffers needing to be separated in pregame warmups, Saturday’s game lacks the fisticuffs and ugly scenes that color much of Rivalry Week elsewhere in the sport. Most of the 109,028 fans who arrive as part of the third-largest crowd in Kyle Field history eventually leave disappointed. One of the wildest weekends in A&M history — in a game with stakes as high as almost any ever played on that field — ends in sadness at the hands of its most hated rival. But so much of this rivalry’s existence necessitates this game actually being played. Finally, after 13 long years, it was.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,San Jose State volleyball's controversial season ends with loss in Mountain West championship,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5959244/2024/12/01/san-jose-state-volleyball-mountain-west-tournament/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 11:00:51 GMT",The Spartans lost to top-seeded Colorado State in four sets.,"College Sports LAS VEGAS — Colorado State coach Emily Kohan is never overly boisterous. She paces the sideline during each rally, head tilted down in concentration. That composure was especially evident on Friday, as Kohan led the Rams to the conference championship game of a volleyball tournament that quickly became the epicenter of the fraught debate over the participation of transgender athletes in women’s sports.  Advertisement “It’s been a really complex and emotional situation this whole season,” said Kohan, the Mountain West Conference coach of the year. “Unless you’re in those rooms having those hard conversations and making those hard decisions, I don’t think you truly know how this feels.”  Each maneuver surrounding this week’s Mountain West women’s volleyball tournament, held at UNLV, was fodder for a broader ongoing political fight and culture war. Athletes and a coach from several schools attempted to force San Jose State to exclude a player that they assert is a transgender woman. Their push for a court injunction failed twice, prompting the tournament to be held largely as planned, with the Spartans using their whole roster. San Jose State and the player have neither confirmed nor denied the player’s gender identity.  San Jose State did not play its semifinal as expected when Boise State withdrew its participation after its win in the opening round. The forfeit mirrored a similar move on Sept. 28, when Boise State became the first of four Mountain West teams to forfeit to the Spartans during the regular season (Wyoming, Utah State and Nevada followed). That put the Spartans in the final against top-seeded Colorado State on Saturday, their first match in 11 days. Though San Jose State found a spark in the third set to avoid getting swept, the Rams stifled that comeback effort with a dominant 25-16 victory in the fourth set to win 3-1, clinching the conference title and one of 31 automatic bids in next week’s NCAA tournament.  San Jose State is not likely to join them. It would need an at-large selection when the 64 teams in the NCAA tournament are announced Sunday, and the Spartans rank 130th out of 346 Division I volleyball programs in RPI, a key metric for the tournament. On Saturday, in front of an announced crowd of 312 at UNLV’s Cox Pavilion, the championship match unfolded without interruption. San Jose State declined to make its coaches or players available after the game, but coach Todd Kress issued a statement addressing the backlash his team endured this season. Advertisement “I will not sugarcoat our reality for the last two months,” he said.“Our team prepared and was ready to play each match according to established Mountain West and NCAA rules of play. We did not take away anyone’s participation opportunities. Sadly, others who for years have played this same team without incident chose not to play us this season. “To be clear, we did not celebrate a single win by forfeiture. Instead, we braced for the fallout. Each forfeiture announcement unleashed appalling, hateful messages individuals chose to send directly to our student-athletes, our coaching staff, and many associated with our program.”  Kress also thanked those who supported the team and expressed his pride in his athletes.  Because San Jose State had a bye in the first round, the championship game ended up being the only game the team played this week. Boise State said in a statement that its decision to withdraw “was not an easy one” for its team, though the university declined to offer more details on how the decision was made to forfeit. “They should not have to forgo this opportunity while waiting for a more thoughtful and better system that serves all athletes,” the team said in its statement.   University officials said no further comments would be given from Broncos players, coaches or athletic director Jeramiah Dickey, who has publicly supported the Broncos’ decision on social media. At Friday’s semifinals, only a few specks of blue — some for San Jose State, others for Boise State — could be found in the stands as their match was removed from the agenda. The Spartans sat as spectators on the far side of the gym in a section of bleachers closed to fans, sizing up their competition for the championship game. Two protesters stood outside Cox Pavilion, holding posters that read “Boise State should be here” and “Protect women’s sports. Thank you Boise State.” Security was present, but besides an updated spectator policy that included the banning of all signs and clothing with “derogatory or offensive language,” the wider debate was less of an active disruptor and more of an undercurrent for those in Las Vegas. Advertisement Beth Bourne, a Davis, California resident, traveled to Las Vegas in protest this week. She said she was “thrilled” in Boise State’s decision to forfeit its semifinal match while acknowledging the decision was bittersweet for the athletes involved. Bourne said she hoped Colorado State would forfeit the championship. “Those young women took a stand on this. I just wanted them to know that that there’s so many women behind them,” Bourne said of the programs that forfeited against the Spartans this season. “I never imagined we would have this much attention to women standing up for themselves.” Bourne said venue managers asked her and a fellow protester to move to a designated free speech area outside of Cox Pavilion on Friday, but police later intervened and directed them to an area closer to the venue entrance. “I’m not trying to be difficult,” Bourne said. “There’s no free speech if you’re not visible.” Bourne entered the arena without issue, though her signs were taken away, as she expected from reviewing the spectator policy. Earlier this month, 11 female volleyball players, led by San Jose State co-captain Brooke Slusser, and an assistant coach sued the Mountain West Conference and San Jose State University, alleging the defendants violated the U.S. Constitution and Title IX by allowing a transgender athlete to play for a women’s sports team.  The suit sought to exclude the player from competing in this week’s tournament, but a judge ruled Monday that the situation did not warrant an emergency injunction. An appeal request by the plaintiffs was denied on Tuesday.  San Jose State has said all of its athletes “are eligible to participate in their sports under NCAA and MWC conference rules.” An ongoing federal lawsuit is challenging the NCAA’s rules, which were updated in 2022 to follow guidance from the International Olympic Committee by taking a sport-by-sport approach and requiring transgender athletes to “document sport-specific testosterone levels.” Advertisement Slusser and the alleged transgender player, who has played for San Jose State since 2022, did not respond to requests for comment made through the team. The Athletic is not naming the player because the athlete has not publicly identified or spoken about gender. In court documents, Slusser asserted that the player, who was also her roommate, came out to her as transgender in a direct conversation. In the Monday ruling, the judge wrote that “no Defendant disputed that SJSU rosters a trans woman volleyball player.”  When asked if Colorado State felt pressure to play – or to not play – amid the ongoing dispute, Kohan said: “Of course.” “It’s easy to sit there and tweet at us what your opinion is,” Kohan said. “You’re never going to please everyone. We said that the first couple of times we played (San Jose State). I’ll probably get emails either way and the forfeit teams probably get emails either way.  “I’m not an expert on this. I didn’t get a lot of training to manage this situation. But here we are all trying to do our best,” she said.  In winning the Mountain West conference championship, Colorado State also won the rubber match after splitting two matches with San Jose State in the regular season.
 “Regardless of your opinion on it, there’s some room here to acknowledge that there’s been a lot of young people showing courage all season long in a lot of ways,” Kohan said. “This team, we started this season, we didn’t think this would be the storyline.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Blackburn 1 Leeds 0: Familiar issues - and should Farke be more proactive with his subs?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5959272/2024/12/01/leeds-farke-substitutes-gnonto-blackburn-briefing/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 11:00:50 GMT",Daniel Farke's side succumbed to a first-half penalty at Ewood Park to sap some of the momentum out of a previously rousing week,"EFL This always had the potential to be a defining round of matches in the Championship promotion race ahead of the cluttered December fixture list. With Sheffield United hosting fourth-placed Sunderland on Friday night, both Burnley and Leeds faced tricky trips on Saturday as they sought to wrest themselves free of the pack at the top of the second tier. But, while Sheffield United and Burnley (at Stoke) ground out ultimately impressive wins, Leeds slipped up. A rousing week ended on a flat note as they lost at Blackburn. Todd Cantwell’s first-half penalty following Ao Tanaka’s foul on Tyrhys Dolan proved enough. Yet Leeds’ performance validated the popular view that this team, while boasting quality and reasonable strength in depth, still struggle with familiar failings. Leeds’ 2-0 victory in this fixture last season, almost exactly a year ago, was emblematic of a consistent side capable of crushing opponents in one game and also digging out a result three days later. Yesterday, after the highs against Luton at Elland Road in midweek, Leeds looked far from their best. Advertisement Blackburn’s three-man pressing structure from the front meant one or both of Tanaka and Joe Rothwell needed to drop between the centre-backs to move the ball. That, combined with Blackburn’s mid-block, stopped Leeds from progressing play through the middle, effectively taking Brenden Aaronson and Joel Piroe out of the game. At left-back, Junior Firpo returned from suspension and was asked to invert, to allow Dan James to cause problems out wide. Yet Firpo often looked uncomfortable in central areas and as manager Daniel Farke admitted post-match, was “rusty”, while James and Willy Gnonto both preferred the left side, resulting in clogged-up lanes. Farke referenced this after the game, saying he’d had to remind his players of the “basics” and “speak about one or two tactical things” at half-time. Blackburn’s defensive block forced Leeds wide, resulting in 11 open-play crosses from the visitors in the first half, their second most for an opening 45 minutes this season after attempting 16 in the 3-0 home win over Plymouth a month ago. Three of the 11 — many of which came from Leeds’ right flank, despite both their wingers playing off the left — were successful. It became evident early that Blackburn were fresher, having only played once between November 10 and 29 due to their home match against Portsmouth last weekend being postponed due to a waterlogged pitch. Leeds won only 42 per cent of their duels in the first half — below their season average of 47 — while giving away nine fouls, their second-highest figure for that metric so far. “I totally agree,” Farke said afterwards, when asked if Leeds were sloppy and lacked urgency in the first half. “We started a bit too slow and then, especially in the beginning, gave too many unnecessary free kicks and fouls away. I think we were a bit — I don’t want to be too critical, so lazy is perhaps a bit too harsh — but we didn’t deal with the duels properly.” Leeds could have countered their slow start by converting their early chances, the best of which fell to Gnonto, who was thwarted by goalkeeper Aynsley Pears. Alternatively, they could have mustered more accurate passing, but their players were too often out of sync. Blackburn’s first chance of the game, 12 minutes in, stemmed from miscommunication on Leeds’ right flank as Yuki Ohashi headed a cross onto the bar before Owen Beck skied the rebound. Advertisement In that context, it was perhaps not a surprise when Gnonto misplaced a pass to Tanaka which Ohashi intercepted. He found Dolan, who cut inside Pascal Struijk and got into the box before going down under contact from Tanaka for the game’s decisive penalty. “Again, I think we should have defended the situation,” Farke said. It was all so avoidable. A lack of fluidity and communication, an over-reliance on Gnonto, and an inability to break down a block are all problems Leeds have struggled with previously.  Farke’s unhappiness with Leeds’ start was evident as Manor Solomon, Largie Ramazani and Patrick Bamford were sent to warm up late in the first half. Leeds’ substitutes spent the interval preparing to come on, too, but Farke then chose to not make any half-time changes. The visitors emerged after the interval with more urgency as Blackburn retreated, but chances remained at a premium. Struijk’s header from a Rothwell free kick, saved by Pears, was their best opening until Farke finally brought on Solomon, Bamford and Ramazani for Aaronson, Rothwell and Gnonto all at once midway through the half. Farke’s reluctance to make early substitutions is established but, as The Athletic noted in September, losing to a promotion rival brings added scrutiny. He has made only one change between the 45th and 60th minute in a Championship game all season – in the 59th minute against Luton when Max Wober replaced Sam Byram, who had injured a hamstring. Overall, Leeds have made the most substitutions in the division after the 75th minute (2.3 per game) and fourth-least between minutes 46 and 75 (1.8 per game). Farke mentioned the differences in the two sides’ recent schedules post-match, noting that “the other team, due to the cancelled game, (played) more or less one game in the last 10 days, and today was our third game within six days”. In that context, his reluctance to make changes earlier, while a consistent feature of his management style, was questionable.  While Leeds improved in the second half, they could not penetrate Blackburn’s mid-block and the hosts held onto their lead with resilient defending and some canny time-wasting. The introductions of Solomon, Bamford and Ramazani, and later Mateo Joseph, could not prevent Leeds’ third league loss of the season. Advertisement They have now collected 13 points from nine away games, compared to 22 from nine home ones. Their next two matches are both at Elland Road – against Derby and Middlesbrough on December 7 and 10 – but visits to Preston, Stoke and Derby follow before the end of the year. This group must try to find a way of replicating their dominant home form on their travels if they are to stand any chance of breaking free of the promotion-chasing pack. Similarly, as Leeds enter the most cluttered month of the whole season, Farke will need to trust his bench more while figuring out how to extract consistency from his starters. The Championship table is clogged, with only five points separating fifth-placed Middlesbrough from Bristol City in 11th. Leeds are currently third, a point off the automatic promotion places after 18 of the 46 games, but they need to find solutions to old problems if this season is to go the way they want it to.

Ohio State, Georgia appear safe. Indiana, Miami should root for SMU.","NCAAF We have seen college football teams back into the College Football Playoff, losing their last regular-season or conference title game and still earning a spot in the four-team field. This happened to Alabama in 2017 after losing the Iron Bowl and to Ohio State after it lost to Michigan in 2022. That was the same season TCU of the Big 12 became the first team to lose its conference championship game (to Kansas State) and still get in. In all those cases, that loss was the team’s only loss. Advertisement Now with a 12-team CFP, backing into the Playoff has a whole new meaning. Looking at you, Ohio State (10-2). Miami (10-2), too. What we learned about the College Football Playoff in the last full weekend of the regular season is we have a pretty good idea of who will be in the College Football Playoff heading into championship weekend. GO DEEPER College Football Playoff 2024 projections: What now for Ohio State after Michigan upset? No. 2 Ohio State’s faceplant against Michigan opened the door for No. 4 Penn State to reach the Big Ten Championship Game against No. 1 Oregon.

The matchup is set 🦁🦆 Early thoughts on who will win the B1G title game?#B1GFootball pic.twitter.com/F5josIsL2T — Big Ten Football (@B1Gfootball) November 30, 2024  The Nittany Lions (11-1) and Ducks look to be safely into the bracket, with the winner getting a bye. Worst case for the Ducks is hosting a first-round game. Penn State could fall all the way out of a hosting spot, depending on how other championship games work out. The SEC has a similar situation with No. 7 Georgia (10-2) facing No. 3 Texas (11-1), which clinched a spot after beating rival Texas A&M. We doubt the committee will punish Georgia for reaching the championship game, though it would be in the Bulldogs’ best interest to not get blown out by the Longhorns. GEORGIA. TEXAS. THE REMATCH FOR A TITLE. 🏆#SECChampionship pic.twitter.com/xpIiXZ65Rk — Southeastern Conference (@SEC) December 1, 2024  Coming off that great escape against Georgia Tech on Friday night in eight OTs, Georgia doesn’t want to give the selection committee any reason to reconsider Alabama or Mississippi, both of which beat the Bulldogs. A wild Big 12 race ended somewhat routinely. All the favorites won this weekend, putting No. 18 Iowa State (10-2) and No. 16 Arizona State (10-2) in the conference title game. We’ll see what the penultimate rankings say Tuesday, but the committee has not been overly kind to the Big 12, which means only the winner will make the field as one of the five highest-ranked conference champions.

The American Athletic Conference will argue for Army (10-1) if it beats Tulane in that title game, but the Cadets failed their Notre Dame test badly and played one of the weakest schedules in the country. 🏈 Highlights from UNLV's 38-14 win over Nevada!#MWFB | #BEaREBEL | #MWPathToThePlayoff pic.twitter.com/gUUX1K6wBB — Mountain West (@MountainWest) December 1, 2024  An interesting race has developed between the Mountain West and Big 12 for the No. 4 seed and bye. Ashton Jeanty and the Broncos (11-1) have held that spot in the last two rankings, comfortably ahead of the highest-ranked Big 12 team. How much the Big 12 can close the gap — if at all — is something to watch Tuesday. Advertisement The Broncos beat Oregon State 34-18 on Friday. On Saturday, Iowa State knocked off No. 24 Kansas State 29-21 and Arizona State thumped Arizona 49-7. UNLV also being ranked — with two victories against Big 12 teams — makes it seem unlikely that the Big 12 title game winner will slingshot past Boise State if the Broncos win. And the Rebels will probably have a good case to make a big leap forward if they win on the Blue Turf. Clemson had a weird day. The Tigers lost 17-14 to rival South Carolina, with Cade Klubnik throwing a brutal interception in the waning moments when Clemson (9-3) was in position to tie it with a short field goal. South Carolina holds off Clemson for its sixth-straight win‼️ pic.twitter.com/UOTr9dGWAv — ESPN College Football (@ESPNCFB) November 30, 2024  But the Tigers did get the help they needed to earn a spot in the ACC Championship Game when Syracuse rallied from 21-0 down in the first half to beat No. 6 Miami 42-38. “Hey, Dabo Swinney, congrats. I got you in, baby!” Orange coach Fran Brown said. The Tigers will face No. 9 SMU (11-1). The Mustangs appear safely in the field no matter what happens in Charlotte, N.C. Win the conference, earn a bye. Easy. Clemson has no path with a loss but shouldn’t have a problem being one of the five highest-ranked conference champions if it wins the ACC. Whether that’s good enough to get a top-four seed and a bye is iffy. But if Clemson is in along with SMU, then another team looking good for an at-large spot right now is getting bumped. Ohio State’s latest loss to Michigan was the worst one yet during this four-game skid in The Game. Still, the second-ranked Buckeyes (10-2) are in a group that looks safely into the bracket even though they won’t play championship weekend. No. 5 Notre Dame (11-1) closed the season with 10 straight victories. The Fighting Irish can’t earn a bye because they’re not in a conference but should have no trouble getting the first-round home game that they have been pointing toward since the end of last season. Advertisement Whether the Irish are seeded No. 5, 6 or 7 will be determined by the conference title games. No. 8 Tennessee (10-2) wiped out an early deficit and beat Vanderbilt 36-23 on Saturday, giving the Volunteers a fairly stress-free week of waiting to find out if they will go on the road or host a first-round game. As for the Buckeyes, being in position to back into the Playoff seemed to be no consolation for losing to Michigan again. “I’m not there right now, quite honestly,” Buckeyes coach Ryan Day said when asked about resetting for a possible playoff run. “Still trying to digest everything that just happened, and I got a locker room full of guys who are just devastated.” GO DEEPER Meet 2024 Ohio State, the unhappiest Playoff team in college football history As we said, if Clemson wins somebody is getting bumped. Who will be that someone? How about Miami? The Hurricanes already handed the Tigers their spot in the ACC title game. The Canes had several great escapes early in the season but closed the year losing two of four. On the bright side, losing one-score games to Georgia Tech (7-5) with Haynes King and at Syracuse (9-3) is nothing to be ashamed of. The Canes don’t have a bunch of wins against highly ranked teams, but the resume looks better than expected with Tech, Louisville (8-4), Duke (9-3) and Florida (7-5) all closing well. “This team won 10 football games against some really good teams,” Miami coach Mario Cristobal told reporters after the loss to Syracuse. What about Indiana? This committee seems unlikely to turn away an 11-1 team, with its only loss at Ohio State, but the fact remains that outside of the Buckeyes, the only team the Hoosiers played that finished above .500 was Michigan (7-5). Hey, Ohio State couldn’t beat the Wolverines at home and Indiana did. So that’s something. Both the Hoosiers and Hurricanes should become big SMU fans. Advertisement The committee hasn’t shown much interest in giving these three-loss SEC teams the benefit of a doubt, but the company line is every week the group starts with a blank sheet of paper, so we should be open-minded to a big shift. The hot team is No. 15 South Carolina, which closed the season with six straight victories. “If the committee’s job is to pick the 12 best teams, you tell me?” South Carolina coach Shane Beamer said. Ironically, South Carolina’s case gets even better if Clemson wins the ACC, but Clemson winning the ACC also clutters the list of at-large teams by adding SMU. The other issue South Carolina has is losses to the two teams ranked directly ahead of it: No. 13 Alabama and No. 14 Mississippi. “Well, I think everyone’s aware of our schedule, and I don’t know the exact stats, but I know we beat four Top-25 teams throughout the year. And I don’t know how many, if anyone, has done that,” Crimson Tide coach Kalen DeBoer said. It’s actually three since LSU dropped out. Still, victories against Georgia, Missouri and South Carolina are nice. Those losses to Oklahoma and Vanderbilt? Both finished 6-6. Surely, SEC commissioner Greg Sankey will have something to say about it, but his opinion doesn’t count. (Photo of South Carolina’s LaNorris Sellers running the ball against Clemson’s T.J.

No. 18 Iowa State took care of business on the field Saturday night by thwarting No. 24 Kansas State 29-21 in a rivalry now known as Farmageddon. In winning a school-record 10th game, Iowa State (10-2) faces Arizona State (10-2) next Saturday in Arlington, Texas, for the Big 12 championship and a shot at the College Football Playoff. GO DEEPER Big 12 Championship Game set: Arizona State vs. Iowa State for CFP spot With temperatures hovering in the teens and wind chills dipping into single digits at Jack Trice Stadium, the Cyclones survived the elements and persevered. With 34 seconds left, quarterback Rocco Becht took a knee, and the stands emptied out to the hardened grass field. Security officers tried to keep fans from the playing surface and roped off a section of the field, but fans streamed toward midfield and mobbed the players. “Sweet Caroline” blared from the speakers and fans sang the chorus in unison as partial strands of confetti floated in the breeze. “It’s an amazing experience seeing all the joy and passion all these fans and the community have for this team,” Iowa State safety Beau Freyler said. “Moments like that, I’ll never forget.” Long overlooked and rarely successful, Iowa State’s football history is so sparse a 10th win is a rightful cause for celebration. The program had won nine games just three times previously, with the last coming during the COVID season of 2020. Iowa State’s last conference title came 112 years ago when the Cyclones went 2-0 in the Missouri Valley Conference. Advertisement But the Cyclones have shown history doesn’t define the present, especially under coach Matt Campbell. Now in his ninth season and the winningest coach in Iowa State history, Campbell took over a program that had exactly one winning Big 12 campaign in the conference’s first 20 years. Over the last eight seasons, Campbell’s Cyclones have posted seven winning Big 12 seasons. The elusive conference crown nearly came to Ames in 2020 with quarterback Brock Purdy, running back Breece Hall and tight end Charlie Kolar. Iowa State earned its first trip to the Big 12 title game, beat Oklahoma at home during the regular season for the first time since 1960 and posted the best record in regular-season action. But in a rematch with the Sooners, Oklahoma prevailed 27-21 to deprive Iowa State of its championship. “I would just tell you,” Campbell said, “I know what it’s like to win the outright championship on the front end, and then get punched in the gut being 31 yards short in the championship game.” This year brings the same championship chase but a different feel for the Cyclones. The last time, perhaps Campbell and his team were naïve about following up the challenge. Despite the loss to Oklahoma, the Cyclones won their first major bowl that year in the Fiesta, besting Oregon 34-17. The following year, most of Iowa State’s top pieces returned, including Purdy and Hall, but the team slipped to 7-6. With those talented pieces off to the NFL the following year, Iowa State bottomed out at 4-8 overall and 1-8 in the Big 12. Once considered the nation’s hottest coaching prospect, Campbell instead dealt with whispers about his future in Ames. Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox. In 2023, a gambling investigation wiped out seven starters, including his first-team quarterback, running back, left tackle and tight end. But when it got tough, that’s when Campbell showed he was more than a one-term leader. Any quality coach can guide an outstanding group of players to heights. But can that person do it with a completely different group at a developmental program? That’s the difference between good and outstanding. For the coach, it’s also perhaps more rewarding. Advertisement “That personally means a great deal,” the 45-year-old Campbell told The Athletic after the game. “It’s not easy, and every couple years, you may have to take a step back before you take a step forward. Talk about that ’21 season, all of a sudden you lose all these NFL players. I think it was a great learning lesson for me. I don’t think I did a great job as a head coach in ’21, and I think that probably permeated a little bit in ’22.” The FG is blocked by @CycloneFB 💪❌ pic.twitter.com/E75sdjB4Re — FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) December 1, 2024  Campbell shook up his staff after the 2022 season by firing offensive coordinator Tom Manning, offensive line coach Jeff Myers and strength coach David Andrews. In 2023, Campbell found a quarterback in Rocco Becht, who displayed a similar mindset and toughness as Purdy. They worked through some issues as a team, but they did it collectively with Campbell at the helm. “Those were hard times, and those were tough situations,” Campbell said. “I think the reality was that you had to make in ’22 was realignment to team and realignment to one culture. Because at this place, the only chance to be successful is everybody’s got to be pulling in the same direction. There can’t be silos in the football program. Everybody’s got to be unified as one. And it was gut-wrenching at times.” Those tough days paid off for the Cyclones against Kansas State. Every time the Wildcats responded with a score or a drive, Iowa State pulled ahead. The Cyclones won in the margins with better field position, nearly 11 minutes more in time of possession and plus-two in turnover margin. In the frozen temperatures, neither team was successful passing and the Cyclones’ rushing edge in the second half sealed the win. “It wasn’t the prettiest tonight,” said Becht, who completed just 13 passes but threw two touchdowns. “But everybody’s gonna have those games.” Rocco Becht with a DIME to Jaylin Noel for the TD 🎯@Cyclonefb extends its lead 🌪️ pic.twitter.com/BwED9fIbkO — FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) December 1, 2024  Campbell’s leadership through adversity provided his players with direction, which culminated with another Big 12 title appearance. Iowa State rarely inks high-level prospects and only once since 2003 have the Cyclones even finished in the top 40 of the 247Sports composite recruiting rankings. In a saturated region with few readymade football players, development is mandatory to enjoy success at Iowa State. But that’s beyond just physical growth; it’s molding a message that everyone follows. Advertisement To his current players, many of whom were with Campbell through the heights of the Purdy-Hall era and the lows of 2022, Campbell stayed true to his principles but also made program tweaks when needed. “He’s the driving force of everything,” said sixth-year cornerback Darien Porter, who switched from receiver after three seasons. “The players, all of our coaches, everyone that touches this program, has the most respect for him. You can’t do it without a great head coach and a great leader. He’s done a lot for this program. He’s done so much for me, too. I’m forever grateful for him.” “He’s a developer of men,” receiver Jaylin Noel said. “He does everything in his power to not only make you a great man on the field, but a great man off the field. He just wants the best out of everybody.” GO DEEPER College Football Playoff 2024 projections: What now for Ohio State after Michigan upset? At exactly 12:45 a.m. Iowa time on Sunday, with low-powered stadium lights glowing above Jack Trice Stadium and sprinklers watering the frozen grass, BYU knocked off Houston 30-18 to officially send Iowa State back to the Big 12 title game. One more step awaits Campbell to reach the ultimate triumph, but he said that won’t define how he views this season’s success. Process-driven from the top down, the coach and his players critiqued their performance objectively, just minutes after receiving hugs and wishes for an achievement previously never accomplished. “I don’t think we’ve played our best game yet,” Becht said. “Hopefully we’re saving that for next week.” (Photo: Reese Strickland / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Mandel's Final Thoughts: Kyle McCord outplays Will Howard, and more Ohio State woes",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5959638/2024/12/01/ohio-state-will-howard-kyle-mccord-final-thoughts/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 11:00:18 GMT",This Ohio State loss was so much worse than those past three losses to top-five Michigan teams.,"NCAAF And now, 20 Final Thoughts from college football’s Rivalry Weekend, where many of the teams fought for 60 minutes, and then fought some more. 1. On his weekly coach’s show last Monday, Ohio State coach Ryan Day described his team’s losing streak to Michigan in stark terms. “It’s one of the worst things that’s ever happened to me in my life, quite honestly, other than losing my father (at age 9) and a few other things,” he said. “And for my family, (it’s) the worst thing that’s happened. So, we can never have that happen again. Ever.” Advertisement It happened again, and this one was so much worse than those past three losses to top-five Michigan teams. This year’s Wolverines were 6-5 and three-touchdown underdogs, yet they still came to the Horseshoe and humiliated the second-ranked Buckeyes 13-10 in a mistake-strewn game. It ended with Michigan players attempting to plant their flag at midfield, fights breaking out, the police pepper spraying guys on both teams. Which Day watched unfold in front of him in an emotionless daze. Also, Ryan Day, your whole team is in the midst of a brawl, and you’re on the sideline asking “what happened?” Huh!? Get your butt on the field and command your players go to the locker room.   pic.twitter.com/fjiZGNmIfW — Emmanuel Acho (@EmmanuelAcho) November 30, 2024  Whether by his own choice or his employer’s, it’s hard to imagine Day will be back in Columbus next season to try again, given the anguish he says the Michigan losses have caused him and his family. Perhaps he will take a cue from John Calipari, who read the room after Kentucky basketball’s unthinkable NCAA Tournament loss to Oakland last March and hatched his own exit plan to Arkansas. 2. The loss knocked Day’s team out of next week’s Big Ten Championship Game, which will now pit No. 1 Oregon (12-0, 9-0 Big Ten) and No. 4 Penn State (11-1, 8-1). The Buckeyes (10-2, 7-2) will likely fall to No. 7 or No. 8, still safely in the 12-team Playoff field, but their berth will come with a pall hanging over the program. Ohio State has not lived up to the expectations that came with its $20 million roster. Held back by an injury-ravaged offensive line, the Buckeyes couldn’t run the ball on Michigan (77 yards on 26 carries), while quarterback Will Howard threw two costly picks and kicker Jayden Fielding missed 38- and 34-yard field goals. The Buckeyes can still achieve their goal of a national championship. But their performance this season does not elicit much confidence they can pull that off. Advertisement 3. Michigan, led by running back Kalel Mullings (32 carries for 116 yards), managed to beat the No. 2 team in the country despite quarterback Davis Warren going just 9 of 16 for 62 yards and two interceptions. It’s arguably the biggest upset in the history of the rivalry, even more so than the famed 1969 Bo-over-Woody game. (Michigan was a 17-point dog in that one.) Coming on the heels of his Bryce Underwood recruiting coup, the win completely changes the story of Sherrone Moore’s first season as head coach. 4. In the three years since Texas accepted an invite to the SEC, coach Steve Sarkisian purposefully built his program along the lines of scrimmage. The third-ranked Longhorns (11-1, 7-1 SEC) flexed both in their 17-7 win over No. 20 Texas A&M (8-4, 5-3) in the rivalry’s long-awaited return after 13 years. Texas’ defense dominated from start to finish, with the Aggies’ only points coming on a pick six. Meanwhile, Texas running back Quintrevion Wisner ground out 186 rushing yards on 33 carries. It’s no secret Texas A&M staunchly opposed allowing its hated nemesis to join the SEC, and now we see why. It took Texas one season to reach the conference championship game, where it gets a rematch with No. 7 Georgia. Whereas A&M, which joined the league in 2012 and has been selling that cachet in recruiting ever since, is yet to make its first trip to Atlanta. GO DEEPER What does the return of Texas-Texas A&M mean? Here's what I saw before, during and after 5. On the same day that Ohio State’s Howard played his worst game of the season, the guy he replaced, Kyle McCord, led Syracuse (9-3, 5-3 ACC) to its biggest win in years, a 42-38 upset of No. 6 Miami (10-2, 6-2 ACC). The loss knocked the Canes out of the ACC Championship Game, which will now be Clemson vs. SMU, and it could possibly cost Miami a CFP berth as well. A vindicated McCord (26 of 36 for 380 yards, three touchdowns, no interceptions) outdueled Heisman candidate Cam Ward (25 of 46, 349 yards, two touchdowns) to lift the Orange to just their third nine-win season this century. Quite the debut for first-time head coach Fran Brown. Advertisement 6. The best guess here is Miami will fall right behind No. 10 Indiana (11-1) and become the last at-large team as of now. The Canes would still likely need No. 9 SMU (11-1) to win next weekend and keep 9-3 Clemson from stealing a bid. You will also hear an 11th-hour lobbying push from the SEC to elevate 9-3 Alabama, which closed with a 28-14 Iron Bowl win over rival Auburn (5-7), above Miami and/or SMU. But this committee seems to care first and foremost about how many games you’ve lost. Not only do the Tide have three of them, two were to a pair of 6-6 teams, Vanderbilt and Oklahoma. Even SEC Network thinks that’s a tough sell. 7. South Carolina quarterback LaNorris Sellers keeps outdoing himself. His 20-yard touchdown run with 1:08 remaining lifted the 15th-ranked Gamecocks (9-3) to a 17-14 win over rival Clemson, their sixth straight win following a 3-3 start. Per Pro Football Focus, Sellers (who finished with 16 carries for 166 yards and two TDs) forced 18 missed tackles, the most by a quarterback since the company began its tracking in 2014. Afterward, South Carolina coach Shane Beamer suggested Sellers should win the Heisman. That’s a stretch, but he’s very good. LaNorris Sellers forced 18 missed tackles against Clemson.  Ashton Jeanty was the only player to have more in a game this season. Most by a QB in a game we’ve ever recorded, dating back to @PFF_College inception in 2014. 171 rushing yards for Sellers, 176 after contact.… — Max Chadwick (@CFBMaxChadwick) December 1, 2024  Beamer also lobbied for a CFP at-large berth, and he has a case. South Carolina now boasts three Top 25 wins (Texas A&M, Missouri and Clemson) and no “bad” losses. But the committee would need to bump the Gamecocks above two 9-3 teams it lost to, Alabama and Ole Miss. Ironically, the team it just beat, Clemson, is win-and-in next week in Charlotte. 8. Georgia and Georgia Tech’s Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate snuck up on Black Friday and delivered an all-time classic. The Jackets (7-5), up 20-6 in the fourth quarter, appeared on the cusp of ending their rival’s 30-game home win streak, thanks to an epic performance from quarterback Haynes King (303 passing yards, 110 rushing yards, five total touchdowns). But Georgia safety Dan Jackson’s game-changing strip-sack of King — which looked to many like targeting — helped the Bulldogs (10-2) come back and eventually win 44-42 in eight(!) overtimes. Kirby Smart praised his team’s “resilience” afterward, but Georgia has no choice to be resilient when it allows 563 yards, the third-most of the Smart era. The Bulldogs now face a Texas team they pummeled 30-15 in Austin on Oct. 19, but don’t assume that result was a precursor for this one. It depends on which of Georgia’s 27 identities this season shows up. GO DEEPER Emerson: Georgia-Georgia Tech a lesson in never hitting publish until it's really over 9. In his first two-plus seasons, Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman earned a stigma for losing games his team had no business losing. But following a Week 2 clunker against Northern Illinois, the fifth-ranked Irish (11-1) rolled off 10 consecutive wins, nearly all of them blowouts. USC (6-6) put up a fight for three-plus quarters Saturday before Notre Dame notched a 99- and 100-yard pick six within minutes of each other to pull away and win 49-35. The Irish, behind Jadarian Price (12 carries, 111 yards, one touchdown) and Jeremiyah Love (13 carries, 99 yards), ran for 258 yards. Notre Dame is a lock to host a first-round CFP game and could even land the No. 5 seed if Penn State takes its second loss in the Big Ten title game. That would set up nicely for Notre Dame, now 31 years removed from its last major postseason win, to finally end that drought. Advertisement 10. Next week will bring the first Big Ten Championship Game that involves no Midwestern schools. No. 1 Oregon (12-0, 9-0 Big Ten) clinched its berth two weeks ago but added a 49-21 rout of rival Washington (6-6, 4-5) as the cherry on top. The door opened for No. 4 Penn State (11-1, 8-1) when Ohio State lost, and the Nittany Lions stormed through it with a 44-7 rout of Maryland (4-8, 1-8). It was another dazzling day for Penn State tight end Tyler Warren, who had six catches for 68 yards, three carries for 32 yards and a 9-yard pass. James Franklin returns to Indianapolis for the first time since winning the 2016 Big Ten title. Quite the turn of events since the Nittany Lions lost at home to Ohio State on Nov. 2. GO DEEPER Snyder: Everything Penn State wants is suddenly right here — including a path to No. 1 seed 11. Iowa State has been stacking milestones throughout Matt Campbell’s nine-year tenure, and Saturday brought his most notable yet. The 18th-ranked Cyclones’ 29-21 win over No. 24 Kansas State (8-4, 5-4 Big 12) gave Iowa State its first-ever 10-win season, and now the Cyclones are headed to the Big 12 Championship Game to face Arizona State (10-2, 7-2). Iowa State did it with an on-brand performance, stuffing two fourth downs, notching a safety and blocking a field goal. Should the Cyclones win next week, they’ll end a staggering 112-year conference championship drought. Unfortunately, there was no Playoff with automatic berths in 1912. 12. No. 16 Arizona State has surged from 3-9 in coach Kenny Dillingham’s first season to a conference championship game appearance in Year 2. Running back and soon-to-be All-American Cam Skattebo burst for 177 yards and three touchdowns as the Sun Devils drilled rival Arizona (4-8, 2-7) 49-7. It marked a complete 180 from last year’s Territorial Cup, when ex-coach Jedd Fisch’s Wildcats won 59-23 en route to a 10-3 record. Dillingham has stolen all the thunder in the Valley since Fisch left for Washington, and the buzz will grow only louder if he leads ASU to a conference championship. 13. Colorado (9-3, 7-2 Big 12) mercifully ended Oklahoma State’s (3-9, 0-9 Big 12) nightmare season with a 52-0 beatdown that ABC portrayed as a Heisman coronation for Travis Hunter. The remarkable two-way star notched his fourth interception of the season and caught 10 passes for 116 yards and three touchdowns. Playing at the exact same time, Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty carried 37 times for 226 yards and a score —– his fifth 200-yard game this season — in the Broncos’ (11-1) 34-18 win over Oregon State (5-7). Hunter, the sport’s most unique player in decades, is unquestionably the favorite to hoist the trophy, but Jeanty is himself having a transcendent season (2,288 yards, 28 TDs). And he’ll get one last showcase opportunity in front of likely his biggest audience of the season because … 14. After rising to No. 17 in the CFP rankings, Tulane (9-3, 7-1 AAC) fell 34-24 at home to Memphis on Thursday, ruining its chances of finishing as the highest-ranked Group of 5 champion. The Green Wave will still play for their conference championship on Friday, but they now have to travel to West Point to meet unranked Army (10-1, 8-0). All of which turns Friday’s Mountain West Championship Game between No. 11 Boise State and No. 22 UNLV on the blue turf into a de facto CFP play-in game. Advertisement That’s right. Either Boise State, which had two undefeated teams under Chris Petersen that never got to play for a national championship, or UNLV, until recently one of the most downtrodden programs in the sport, will become the first team to officially clinch an automatic berth. What a time to be alive. 15. No. 10 Indiana (11-1, 8-1 Big Ten) brushed off last week’s Ohio State loss to mangle rival Purdue 66-0, the most lopsided score in the 125-year history of the Old Oaken Bucket. Indiana scored nearly as many points as its opponent gained yards (67). “It was the worst performance offensively that I’ve ever seen,” Boilermakers coach Ryan Walters said of his team, which had previously suffered top-10 losses to Notre Dame (66-7), Oregon (35-0), Ohio State (45-0) and Penn State (49-10). 16. Imagine being a Kansas City Chiefs/Nebraska Cornhuskers fan. It must be bittersweet to root for one team that seemingly can’t lose a close game and another that can’t win one. Nebraska outgained Iowa 334-164, gained 20 first downs to the Hawkeyes’ five … and lost 13-10 after Dylan Raiola fumbled with 22 seconds left and Iowa’s Drew Stevens nailed a walk-off 53-yard field goal. Amazingly, it marked the second straight year, and fourth time in seven seasons, that Iowa (8-4, 6-3 Big Ten) has defeated Nebraska (6-6, 3-6) on a last-second field goal. The Huskers are still going bowling for the first time since 2016, but Matt Rhule’s second season ultimately did not feel much different from the previous seven. 17. It was a no-fun week for Mack Brown. On Tuesday, North Carolina fired its Hall of Fame coach, who had said only a day earlier he intended to return for a seventh season. Then on Saturday, NC State (6-6, 3-5 ACC) drove 75 yards in the final two minutes for a 35-30 win over the Tar Heels (6-6, 3-5), the Wolfpack’s fourth straight win in the rivalry. Afterward, Brown, 73, told reporters he would not coach UNC in a bowl. Presumably, he has coached his last game. In his second stint at the school, the former national champion took the Heels to the 2022 ACC Championship Game but lost at least five games in all but one season. North Carolina AD Bubba Cunningham was justified in opting to start anew. 18. For the first time in the 28-year history of the MAC Championship Game, arch-rivals Ohio (9-3, 7-1 MAC) and Miami of Ohio (8-4, 7-1) will meet for the title. (They were previously in the same division.) The RedHawks, defending league champs, mounted quite a surge after starting the season 1-4, knocking off Bowling Green 28-12 to get back to Detroit. The Bobcats will be making their sixth championship game appearance, still looking for their first win. Their last MAC title came in 1968. Advertisement 19. UConn (8-4) reached eight wins for the first time since 2010 with a 47-42 win at UMass (2-10). Then came a bizarre subplot. A UMass collective recently announced the creation of a new trophy for the rivalry, the Southwick Jug, but that collective, Midnight Ride, is no longer recognized by the university. UConn coach Jim Mora tweeted after the game that “I specifically asked for the trophy at the end of the game and was told point blank you folks weren’t giving it up.” This is 100% false. I specifically asked for the trophy at the end of the game and I was told point blank you folks weren’t giving it up.  @FightMA247 come clean, don’t put this on @UConnFootball or @UConnHuskies https://t.co/0c5xXhR4t7 — Jim Mora (@CoachJimMoraFB) December 1, 2024  UConn racks up all sorts of hardware in basketball. Why won’t anyone let it have one lousy football trophy? 20. Finally, a word about the onslaught of postgame skirmishes that permeated the sport Saturday, from Columbus to Tuscaloosa to Tucson to Tallahassee. No tsk-tsk lecture about sportsmanship here. Over the past 15 years, conferences and their TV partners have killed off some of the sport’s best rivalries in the pursuit of more dollars. Meanwhile, many feared the Playoff would deaden their stakes. Turns out, the coaches and players still really, really care about their rivals — especially those who attempt to plant flags on their home fields.

But with a win over Oregon, it could end up getting a first-round bye.","NCAAF STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — As Penn State’s senior class lined up on the field Saturday to meet with their families, many in the Nittany Lions’ locker room figured out what was unfolding in Columbus, Ohio. “We knew it was a close game towards the end by the time we went out (on the field),” said linebacker Tony Rojas. Advertisement There was no public acknowledgement in Beaver Stadium about Michigan’s 13-10 upset of No. 2 Ohio State before Penn State took the field. James Franklin, the leader of the 1-0 each week mantra, made it a point not to tell his players that if they beat Maryland the program would return to the Big Ten Championship Game for the first time since 2016. Still, they’re college students, and like the rest of us, don’t travel far without their phones — even when they’re jogging around for warmups. Senior safety Jaylen Reed listened to music pregame and quickly checked the score of The Game. “I saw they (Michigan) kicked the field goal. I’m like all right, we gotta handle business so we can get where we want to go,” Reed said. No. 4 Penn State took care of the task at hand with a 44-7 win over Maryland, and now next Saturday’s trip to Indianapolis to play No. 1 Oregon in the Big Ten Championship Game is a worthy reward for a team that’s been one of Franklin’s most unflappable groups in his 11 seasons in Happy Valley. In the 18-team Big Ten that now spans coast to coast, this team went 11-1 and never had that clunker of a loss like so many in this sport endured during the regular season. See you in Indy. #WeAre x @B1GFootball pic.twitter.com/glT5306J7J — Penn State Football (@PennStateFball) November 30, 2024  There was no field storming at USC, even if it took overtime to win, or at Minnesota, where it took three fourth-down conversions to finish off the final drive. There was a win with backup quarterback Beau Pribula playing the entire second half at Wisconsin and a sneaky difficult road trip to open the season at West Virginia. When Penn State lost starting safety KJ Winston due to injury early in the year, it reshuffled the deck and still developed into one of the best defenses in the country. For all the consternation about not giving do-it-all tight end Tyler Warren at least one touch around the goal line late in what could’ve been a season-defining sequence in the loss to Ohio State, Warren and the offense spoke right away about wanting another chance in the Playoff to show what this team is capable of. Advertisement The opportunity has arrived early. And it’s perhaps even unwanted by some in the Penn State fan base. But Penn State was delivered a gift-wrapped opportunity to play No. 1 Oregon, and with a win can secure a first-round bye in the Playoff. Since that loss to the Buckeyes on Nov. 2, the entire focus has been on winning out and ensuring that Penn State hosts a Playoff game in Beaver Stadium in December. Now, there’s something much more meaningful, and also more polarizing, at stake. Within a week, we’ll know for sure if this is a Penn State team capable of making some serious noise and competing for a national championship, or if the dream of seeing Beaver Stadium stuffed to the gills for the school’s first-ever Playoff game perhaps gets washed away should Penn State lose by a significant margin next weekend with the eyes of the College Football Playoff selection committee firmly on it. Remember, teams seeded five through eight host first-round games on their campuses. Penn State, as of the most recent set of rankings, was seeded sixth. Where Ohio State slots in now and where the loser of the Big Ten title game is slotted will be fodder for the next seven days. Still, the chance to play for a first-round bye, even with the added wear and tear and risks that come with this conference championship game, should be welcomed by Penn State. This is the very goal they’ve been working toward, even if getting to this point has raised questions about what the Nittany Lions’ Playoff resume actually looks like and just how good they are without a win against a premier team this year. Well, there’s a chance to change all of that and end up with the top seed in the 12-team field should Penn State keep surging. “Everything is still in front of us,” said running back Nick Singleton. Singleton watched highlights of the 2016 Big Ten Championship Game as a kid. He saw Saquon Barkley and Trace McSorley accomplish something in the 38-31 win over Wisconsin that this program has been searching for ever since. For all the years stuck in the crowded Big Ten East division, all the double-digit win totals but no other conference title game appearances to show for it, let this ticket to Indianapolis be a reward for all the years spent banging up against Ohio State and Michigan, but never quite getting the break to get back to the conference championship like this team now has. Advertisement “This is the most competitive Big Ten there’s ever been, and to have your team ready to play week in and week out it is very, very difficult to do, and it doesn’t happen very often,” Franklin said Saturday night. “This team finding a ton of different ways to win: blowouts, comebacks, overcoming adversity, winning because of defense, winning because of offense, winning because of special teams. … I’m proud of our guys.” Franklin sat down in late July in Indianapolis at Big Ten media days full of optimism but also skeptical, like many coaches, about the first season of its kind with mega conferences and a 12-team Playoff. I asked him what would constitute a successful season given the sport’s changing landscape. His answer bounced around in my brain for most of the past two weeks as we crunched Big Ten title game scenarios in the unlikely event that, with quite a bit of help, Penn State would end up there. “For us, it’s what do we do this year to put Penn State in the best position to make the playoffs, but not just make the playoffs but put ourselves in an advantageous position in the playoffs,” Franklin said. “How do we put ourselves to have an opening week bye?” Well, this is Penn State’s chance. Franklin continued with a line of thought that’s quite prescient considering how this year’s 12-team field is unfolding with Notre Dame certainly part of the 12-team field. “It’s amazing,” Franklin said. “I’ve seen so many things about Notre Dame not having a bye as part of their requirements with the Playoff. They do have a bye (because) they don’t have a conference championship game. That’s their bye. How do we get ourselves in a position to get a bye? If not a bye, how do we put ourselves in the best position to have a home game in Beaver Stadium, which would be an advantageous position with those elements at that time of the year?” Franklin reiterated within the past week that the goal is to keep this team together and to keep winning as many games as it can for however long. In a year in which every team has been on upset watch — with Oregon even finding itself in that position two weeks ago in the fourth quarter against Wisconsin — Penn State stands as good of a chance as anyone of getting hot at the right time and going on a run. There’s a chance to squash a narrative about being unable to win the biggest games and maybe finally delivering a knockout blow to one of the sport’s top teams, something that’s eluded Franklin’s Penn State teams. But, there’s also the chance that in stepping into the conference championship game, Saturday might have been the last time this group played a game in Beaver Stadium. With a significant loss, Penn State could end up headed on the road in the first round. With a win against Oregon, that coveted idle week is secured but the second-round game is played at a bowl site. Advertisement As Warren walked through the Beaver Stadium tunnel and stopped to sign autographs Saturday evening, he posed for a selfie with a young fan. Warren took plenty of photos on the field and in the tunnel, wanting to soak up every minute. The video boards informed everyone that this team is Indianapolis-bound. “It’s a good way to end it if this was our last game here,” Warren said.  (Photo: Scott Taetsch / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,What Alabama's Iron Bowl win meant to a team that can't control its Playoff fate,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5959364/2024/12/01/alabama-iron-bowl-auburn-playoff-deboer/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 10:30:39 GMT",Beating Auburn gave Alabama a satisfying end to an up-and-down regular season under Kalen DeBoer. What's next? It's not up to the Tide.,"NCAAF TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — In what might have been their last Alabama home game, Jalen Milroe and Tyler Booker wanted extra time to soak in the moment. Milroe took a lap around Bryant-Denny Stadium following the Crimson Tide’s 28-14 win over Auburn, thanking as many fans as he could for the atmosphere. Booker took it a step further, walking into the stands and singing with the student section as “Rammer Jammer” blared through the speakers. Advertisement It continued into an emotional scene in the locker room. Milroe was teary-eyed as he addressed the team. Then Booker gave an impassioned speech in which he couldn’t hold back his tears. “He just poured his heart, just expressed his heart to the whole team,” Milroe said. At about the same time, some 1,000 miles away, Syracuse had a celebration of its own after knocking off No. 8 Miami, a result that could help push Alabama back into the College Football Playoff conversation. But at that moment, the Playoff wasn’t on Alabama’s mind. “I think it was just all about enjoying the win and enjoying the process that we’ve had,” Milroe said. “Yes, this has not been the easiest (season), but just each hardship, each obstacle that we’ve all been on this whole season, we’ve done together.” Remember these moments! ❤️#RollTide pic.twitter.com/XOWVJsSdRG — Alabama Football (@AlabamaFTBL) December 1, 2024  Still, the process and the Playoff are intertwined. Alabama’s hope seemed all but gone a week ago after losing to Oklahoma, but a few upsets and a win over Auburn have it on the doorstep — potentially. But responses to questions about the Playoff postgame were telling and self-aware. Alabama believes it’s a Playoff team. It also knows its fate is out of its hands. “We just have to sit back and watch,” cornerback Domani Jackson said. “We can’t predict that, we just have to sit back and watch.” GO DEEPER Does Alabama have a Playoff case after beating Auburn? Key Iron Bowl takeaways Kalen DeBoer, on the other hand, gave a firmer answer: “Everyone’s aware of our schedule,” DeBoer said. “I don’t know the exact stats, but I know we beat four Top 25 teams throughout the year. I don’t know how many, if anyone’s done that. … When you talk about the schedule and what it is week to week, it’s just a grind. Having to come back every week, the only conference that has to do that is ours. That’s what I would say.” Advertisement Saturday marked DeBoer’s ninth win in his first season, tied for the most ever by a first-year coach at Alabama. But the losses will stick with him and this team more than the wins, especially if there isn’t a Playoff berth coming. The win over Auburn was a nice finish to the regular season, but what’s left is uncertainty. Who will Alabama’s next opponent be? In what setting? If it’s a bowl outside of the Playoff, who has played their final game already? Uncertainty could’ve been avoided with more consistent play. “There’s more (wins) that I wish we would have had,” DeBoer said. “That’s the way I look at it. But from the season standpoint, highs and lows, that’s part of any program. The championship programs go through the same thing each and every year.” All that’s left for Alabama is reflection. There’s good, bad and everything in between. It’s a team that played the toughest schedule in the SEC by conference record and has notable wins including Georgia, South Carolina and Missouri. There’s been an equal number of inexplicable losses: Vanderbilt, Oklahoma and a disappointing effort at Tennessee. Even Saturday’s win over Auburn, for as triumphant as it was, had elements of what made this team hard to characterize. Alabama turned the ball over four times against Auburn, giving it seven in the past two games. Alabama’s first-half drive chart went as follows: fumble, punt, touchdown, interception, touchdown, fumble. But the defense allowed only six points after those miscues and forced two turnovers of its own. To the offense’s credit, it controlled the game clock by a 14-minute margin with an effective run game. That’s been the 2024 Alabama experience: equal parts dominant, equal parts head-scratching. The sum was the desired outcome for Alabama, the third time this year when it won following a loss. Jackson noted that this week felt different in its preparation, though that’s likely due to the opponent. It meant more to do it against rival Auburn for players like Milroe and Booker who’ve likely played the Tigers for the final time — and to senior Malachi Moore, who’s the first Alabama player to go 5-0 against Auburn. Advertisement It wasn’t perfect, but it was a bounceback win all the same, and a much-needed win for all parties involved. “It was all just coming together,” Jackson said. “People assume this is a bad season and whatnot, so we just had to go out there for the seniors and do it for them. And I think we did.” Everything about this season centers around DeBoer, who was tasked with taking this program and maintaining the standard set by Nick Saban. What’s to be made of year one? In some ways that question leads to an incomplete answer. The season isn’t over, but with no scheduled games left, Saturday night opened the door for players to truly reflect. Milroe, one of this year’s permanent team captains, let off an honest, thoughtful review. “I’m gonna say this: I love coach DeBoer,” Milroe said. “It’s not easy being a head coach in the SEC, but he’s just shown tremendous leadership, pride and how much he cares about us. I’m gonna be quite honest, man, he’s one of the best coaches I’ve been around. “Yeah, we lost some games. Yeah, we haven’t played our best game, but I really enjoyed being a quarterback for coach DeBoer. I appreciate him for his leadership, love and how much he pours into me each and every day.” GO DEEPER Auburn hired Hugh Freeze to beat Alabama. It's racking up missed opportunities instead What is next for Alabama that’s tangible? The early signing period, starting on Wednesday, where Alabama has the No. 2 class in the 247Sports Composite. It’s the next major milestone for DeBoer, who to this point answered questions about his recruiting acumen. That in part made Saturday’s win a big deal. Had Auburn, which has commitments from eight of the top 10 prospects in-state, won the game, it could’ve sold the idea that the Tigers are on the cusp of flipping the rivalry. That’s been slowed by the fifth straight win by Alabama. But a few days after prospects are signed, Alabama will learn its postseason fate. There’s not much left for Alabama to say about why it should or shouldn’t be included. At least outwardly, Alabama seems at peace with whatever the committee decides. Given its play this season, there isn’t much of a choice. “The goal is to go 1-0 no matter who the opponent is,” Milroe said. “ I think we’re excited for what’s ahead and we’ll be prepared for the opportunity whenever it presents itself.” (Top photo of Jalen Milroe:  Jason Clark / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Seattle, Arizona and San Francisco also have key games.","NFL Week 13 of the NFL season is in full swing following four games on Thanksgiving and Black Friday. The Detroit Lions survived a thrilling second-half charge by the Bears to win 23-20 and improve to 11-1, a game that proved to be the last for Chicago coach Matt Eberflus, who was fired Friday. The Dallas Cowboys topped the New York Giants 27-20 to string together their first two-game win streak in more than a month.

The Cleveland Browns and Denver Broncos cap it all off Monday night. Here’s a look at five of the most compelling storylines from the remainder of this weekend’s games. (Find the full Week 13 schedule here.) GO DEEPER NFL Week 13 roundtable: Trevor Lawrence's return, Aaron Rodgers' future, second-year QB surge Russell Wilson’s perfect mark as Steelers starting quarterback ended last week as the Browns handed their AFC North rivals their first loss since Week 5, snapping Pittsburgh’s five-game win streak. Now 8-3, the Steelers cling to a slim division lead over the Baltimore Ravens (8-4). A victory Sunday over the host Cincinnati Bengals would go a long way toward helping the Steelers remain in control of the division. Wilson and the Steelers struggled on a snowy night to capitalize on opportunities against Cleveland. They converted just one of three fourth-down attempts and missed a field goal. The offense ventured into the red zone just twice and came away with only one touchdown. The 19 points scored also represented the second-lowest output of Wilson’s stead as starter. This week, the quarterback and his unit need to figure out how to regain their explosiveness. After averaging 30 points per game in Wilson’s first three starts, the Steelers scored just 18 and 19 points against Baltimore and Cleveland, respectively. Will the Bengals, whose porous defense has given up 26.9 points per game, be the get-right opponent for Pittsburgh? GO DEEPER Some games mean more: The Week 13 matchups that will have biggest impact on playoff odds That problematic defense is one of the biggest reasons Cincinnati, coming off its bye this week, is 4-7 and appears likely to miss the playoffs. Joe Burrow and the offense certainly can score with the best of them (averaging 27 points per game) despite injuries at wide receiver. But an inability to get stops on third down and to generate turnovers has proved costly. Advertisement After Sunday, Pittsburgh (1-1 in the division) has a rematch with Cleveland and games against contenders Philadelphia, Baltimore and Kansas City before a season finale against the Bengals. A loss Sunday could come back to haunt the Steelers. (Steelers at Bengals, 1 p.m. ET Sunday.) Arizona and Seattle — the leaders of the ever-intriguing NFC West — find themselves in high-pressure situations as they jockey for position in this final stretch of the regular season. Both 6-5, the Seahawks and Cardinals have little margin for error. The Seahawks look to extend their win streak to three games Sunday as they take on the hapless New York Jets at MetLife Stadium. Meanwhile, the Cardinals aim to rebound from last week’s loss to Seattle as they go on the road to face a tough Minnesota Vikings team. Seattle appears to have shaken off a midseason slump, earning hard-fought wins over San Francisco and Arizona in the last two weeks. A previously struggling defense held the 49ers and Cardinals to a combined 23 points while also proving stingy on third downs. Can Mike Macdonald’s team continue to build momentum, or is facing the Jets the perfect trap game? Arizona needs a strong rebound from Kyler Murray and an offense that had averaged 26.3 points per game during a four-game win streak, only to muster six points against Seattle. The Cardinals converted only three of 12 third downs and went 0 of 2 in the red zone against the Seahawks. Fending off Minnesota’s aggressive pass rushers will rank high on the Cardinals’ list of priorities, but that’s no easy task, especially for a team that has beaten only one opponent with a record over .500 this season. A win over 9-2 Minnesota could provide much-needed momentum for Arizona. A loss could put the Cardinals in an undesirable position entering next week’s crucial rematch with Seattle. (Seahawks at Jets, Cardinals at Vikings, both at 1 p.m. ET Sunday.) The Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ three-year streak as NFC South champions is in danger of ending. After a strong start to the season, injuries impacted the Buccaneers in late October and early November. A four-game losing streak dropped the Bucs below .500 and behind 6-5 Atlanta in the division standings. The healthy return of wide receiver Mike Evans and a blowout win over the New York Giants last week helped Tampa Bay end the skid, and now it’s trying to mount a charge that will keep its postseason hopes alive. Advertisement The Bucs travel to Charlotte on Sunday, where they face the improved Carolina Panthers . Second-year quarterback Bryce Young and his teammates came close to upsetting Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs last week but now seek their third win in four games. Can Young continue to ascend, or can Todd Bowles’ defense and Baker Mayfield, who had a brief stint with the Panthers in 2022, deal their division foes another setback? A victory would improve Tampa Bay’s record to 6-6 and 2-2 in the division. Before their kickoff, however, the Bucs will root for the Chargers, who can help Tampa Bay’s cause by beating Atlanta in a game that begins at 1 p.m. ET. (Buccaneers at Panthers, 4:05 p.m. ET Sunday.) In a potential Super Bowl preview, the Eagles travel to Baltimore to take on the Ravens. There are many similarities between these teams. Dual-threat quarterbacks Lamar Jackson and Jalen Hurts direct well-rounded units that boast big-play ability, and workhorse backs Derrick Henry and Saquon Barkley are having impressive seasons. Philadelphia’s Barkley and Baltimore’s Henry have led the NFL in rushing for the entire season. Last week, Barkley charged ahead of Henry in his quest for the rushing title. Barkley has rushed for 1,392 yards (first place) while Henry trails narrowly with 1,325. Henry, however, still leads the NFL with 13 rushing touchdowns while Barkley trails with 10. Not to be outdone, Hurts is tied for second in the NFL with 11 rushing touchdowns. GO DEEPER Why a former MVP thinks Saquon Barkley can break the QB-only trend Defensively, Baltimore and Philadelphia both endured offseason change with new coordinator hires and the departures of leading players. The Eagles appear to have rounded into form, holding their last three opponents to 20 points or fewer. The Ravens, meanwhile, have had their bright spots but still seek consistency. Philadelphia is on a hot streak, winning its last seven games to cement itself as the NFC East’s leader and one of the best teams in the conference. Baltimore, meanwhile, remains one of the top teams in the AFC but has work to do to overtake Pittsburgh for the division lead. (Eagles at Ravens, 4:25 p.m. ET Sunday.)  Entering the season, Sunday night’s showdown between Buffalo and San Francisco looked like a possible Super Bowl preview. But the 49ers have encountered calamity of every kind this season, and their quest to return to the Super Bowl is in great jeopardy. Back-to-back losses (versus Seattle, at Green Bay) have the 5-6 49ers in a desperate position as they travel to Buffalo. The injuries that have plagued the 49ers for much of the season reached quarterback Brock Purdy last week. He is on track to start Sunday after a shoulder issue forced him to miss last week’s loss to the Packers but obviously won’t be 100 percent. That will make it tough to match blows with Josh Allen and the Bills, winners of six straight and fresh off their bye, especially with 49ers left tackle Trent Williams out again with a bone bruise in his heel. Left guard Aaron Banks didn’t practice at this week and remains in the concussion protocol. Defensive end Nick Bosa and cornerback Deommodore Lenoir won’t play, either. And there may be snow to contend with as well. A loss Sunday could essentially kill San Francisco’s hopes of a late-season surge and deep playoff march. All four NFC West teams remain separated by only a game, but a San Francisco loss and wins by Seattle and/or Arizona could keep both just beyond the Niners, who are last in the division.

And right as the Atlanta Falcons looked evolved on offense, they’ve sputtered to just 23 points in their last two games. Advertisement The Chargers are still in a good spot at 7-4. And the Falcons still lead the NFC South at 6-5. That makes this one of the more compelling matchups of Week 13, and it hits the market with the fourth-highest point total of the slate. The Falcons need to make the game easier on themselves. They enter with the second-worst average starting field position per drive. Some of that is a shoddy defense getting pushed around. Raheem Morris made his name coaching stout defenses, but these Falcons are certainly not that. The pass rush is anemic, and Atlanta is bottom-10 in both points and air yardage allowed. This offense is paced by Kirk Cousins, tied for the most comebacks, and Bijan Robinson, fifth in scrimmage yards. It will have its work cut out for it against the Chargers. Even with the recent downturn, Los Angeles is still the stingiest scoring defense in the NFL. Opponents are eighth-worst on third down and fourth-worst in red zone conversions. Justin Herbert set his season high for passing in Week 11’s thriller over the Bengals. But he’s still averaging the lowest yards per throw of his career. Far more impressive is his sterling 13-to-1 touchdown-to-interception rate. With his newfound protective play, and Atlanta’s inability to generate turnovers, the Falcons will be expected to lose the field position battle once again. Drake London is the home squad’s best receiver, but Darnell Mooney, the game-breaking vertical option, might be Cousins’ most important read.   Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox.

The Bills have done their part in creating that potential matchup. The 49ers have not. The 49ers are starting to get into desperation mode after back-to-back losses and find themselves as a touchdown underdog in Buffalo. Advertisement Injuries have certainly taken their toll on the 49ers this season, and the latest big one to hit them hard is starting quarterback Brock Purdy. He did not play in Sunday’s blowout loss at Green Bay, and backup Brandon Allen did not really give them a chance to be competitive. Purdy is expected to play, but if he is not 100 percent, that is going to be a big issue for a 49ers team going on the road against Josh Allen and the Bills. The other big issue for the 49ers offense is how much superstar running back Christian McCaffrey has struggled since his return. He is averaging just 3.5 yards per carry in his three games back, while Jordan Mason — who excelled in McCaffrey’s absence — has become an afterthought in the offense. Buffalo, meanwhile, seems to be hitting its stride and is playing like a well-oiled machine at this point. The Bills enter Sunday night’s game on a six-game winning streak while scoring at least 30 points in each of the past five games. They have the third-best offense in the league (29.1 points per game), the seventh-best defense (19.5 points per game) and an MVP contender in Allen. Whether Purdy plays is sharp or not, the 49ers are going to need a herculean effort to win in Buffalo on a Sunday night given the way both teams are playing right now.

Stroud looks to snap a disheartening sophomore slump with a game against a familiar nemesis. The 7-5 Houston Texans come in as road favorites against the 2-9 Jacksonville Jaguars. Houston is first in the AFC South; Jacksonville is last. The Texans have a narrow point differential of 17. They rank in the middle of the league in most team offense stats. After throwing just five interceptions in 15 games as a rookie, Stroud has nine in 12 weeks this year. He’s also the second-most sacked QB in football, trailing only Caleb Williams. Houston is 21st in offensive EPA. Advertisement The defense has mostly held things down, however. They’re first in takeaways and fifth in yards allowed per play. Danielle Hunter is second in the NFL with 10.5 sacks, and trenchmate Will Anderson is fifth with 9.5. This is a get-right game after Houston’s deflating home loss to Tennessee last Sunday. The Texans were outgained by more than 100 total yards and flagged 11 times, all against a flailing Titans team at the league’s cellar. And Jacksonville is the prime get-right candidate, even if Trevor Lawrence makes his expected return. Since Lawrence departed, the Jags have lost two in a row with just 13 points total, but against two of the league’s best teams. With their starter, Jacksonville was 2-7 with wins over just the Colts and the Patriots. The few bright spots include rookie receiver Brian Thomas Jr., who has more yards than fellow 2024 draftees Marvin Harrison Jr. and Rome Odunze through 11 games. He had six catches for 86 yards and a score in these teams’ first matchup back in September.   Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox.

The Jets are a mess and enter Week 13 as home underdogs to a middling Seattle Seahawks team that just took control of their division at 6-5. Aaron Rodgers’s 2024 return has resulted in the ousters of head coach Robert Saleh and GM Joe Douglas, a 3-8 record, and a roster that looks like a Green Bay class reunion. Despite rumors to the contrary, he will suit up against the Seahawks, though the picture of his overall health is murky and his future with the team is in question. Advertisement When the Jets offense flashes, it looks promising. Despite his struggles, Rodgers is still posting serviceable numbers for a QB with his mileage (2,442 passing yards, 17 touchdowns, seven interceptions). Garrett Wilson has blossomed since Davante Adams’ arrival, jumping to sixth in yards over expected and nearly reaching the top 10 in yards. Breece Hall has struggled on the ground as part of a timeshare behind a porous offensive line but has been great as a pass-catcher, ranking second in yards after the catch over expected. The more the Jets use him, the better he is, but his utilization has been confoundingly limited this season. He was questionable this week due to knee soreness, but is expected to play. But even with the occasional pops, the Jets were the only team in the league to have not scored 25 points this season until Week 11, and Rodgers hasn’t thrown for 300 yards in 30 straight games. The Seahawks defense is firmly middle of the road across the board but is certainly up to the task of stopping a scuffling team just waiting to start their umpteenth rebuild. But the Jets have a massive advantage on defense that could keep them in range to cover. Seattle is built around the pass, throwing the fourth-most in the league and boasting the NFL’s yardage leader in Geno Smith. But Smith has a brutal 1-1 touchdown-to-pick ratio, and New York has allowed the second-fewest pass yards and passing touchdowns this season. They’re also fifth in QB pressure rate, and Smith loses nearly 20 points on his passer rating when harassed. If the Jets can get even an average performance offensively, their ability to neutralize Seattle’s primary attack could keep them close enough to get their first underdog win against the spread.

Both teams enter at second place in crowded divisions. The NFC West is a logjam, everyone at either 6-5 or 5-6. Arizona lost its lead after stumbling in Seattle last Sunday. The NFC North, meanwhile, has three of the four winningest teams in the conference, and Minnesota is still looking up at Detroit in the top spot. Advertisement The Cardinals are less equipped to take a loss, entering Sunday on the outside of the playoff fixture. They won four straight games before last week. Still, there’s much to like about this young group. Kyler Murray has the highest QBR of his six-year career. Marvin Harrison Jr. has made moments of brilliance in the vertical game. The rushing attack is third in yards per carry. And the defense has unearthed a few gems — like Dante Stills, a 2023 sixth-round pick with 3.5 sacks in the last five games, and Jesse Luketa, a 2022 seventh-rounder with a sack in three straight. Minnesota touts top-line offensive talent. Justin Jefferson comes into Week 13 second in receiving yards, trailing only Ja’Marr Chase. Aaron Jones and T.J. Hockenson both had hundred-yard days against a good Bears defense. But the Vikings are primarily winning with their defense, averaging a full two takeaways per game. Their opponents have the fewest rushing yards in football, on a tough 3.6 yards per carry. Just 26.6 percent of drives against them end with a score, another league best. Five Vikings have multiple picks this season, and three edge guys — Andrew Van Ginkel, Jonathan Greenard and Pat Jones II — have at least seven sacks. This is Sam Darnold’s first career start against Arizona. Murray has six touchdowns and four interceptions in two games against Minnesota.   Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox.

Looking competitive in the NFC East before the recent slide, Washington needs a win to maintain its playoff position. Following a gritty road win in Houston, the Titans face another quality opponent away from home. Even with the recent losses, the Commanders are favored by close to a touchdown in this matchup. Advertisement Washington’s backfield is a major concern entering Week 13. The Commanders’ top two backs, Brian Robinson Jr. and Austin Ekeler, both exited Week 12’s loss to the Cowboys with injuries. Robinson is expected to play, but Ekeler was placed on the IR with a concussion. Rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels also faces additional pressure with an uncertain running game. Tennessee’s stellar defense (No. 2 in total yards) made life difficult on fellow rookie QBs Caleb Williams and Drake Maye earlier this season. The Titans could bring plenty of pressure on Daniels and force him to make plays. Tennessee finally won this season with Will Levis starting at quarterback. Taking eight sacks against the Texans, Levis needs better protection against a formidable Washington pass rush (No. 9 sack rate). Turnovers remain an issue for Levis, who rates among the league leaders in interceptions and sacks taken despite missing multiple games with injury. The Titans are last in the NFL in interception and sack percentage. An inconsistent Commanders run defense (No. 29 yards per game) has to slow down Tennessee lead back Tony Pollard. Seventh in the NFL in carries and rushing yards this season, Pollard provides stability with zero fumbles on the season.   Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox.

A pair of Super Bowl contenders coming off of primetime road wins in Los Angeles, this marquee matchup features MVP candidates and two of the league’s top three offenses. Baltimore is favored by around a field goal. Advertisement Dominant at times in the win over the Chargers, Baltimore’s No. 1 offense scored on five straight possessions after an early double-digit deficit. MVP candidate Lamar Jackson maintains the league’s top passer rating (117.9), while lead back Derrick Henry (1,325 yards) is second in the NFL in rushing yards. Remarkably balanced on offense, Baltimore is No. 1 in rushing yards and passing yards per play this season — capable of a big gain on any play. The Ravens failed Week 11’s test against Pittsburgh’s strong defense. Philadelphia’s elite defense (No. 1 total yards) offers Baltimore another playoff-caliber test. Completely dominant at times during a seven-game winning streak, the Eagles outgain opponents by an NFL-best 114 yards per game — 34 yards more than second-place San Francisco. Philadelphia has its own credible MVP candidates in quarterback Jalen Hurts and running back Saquon Barkley. Following Barkley’s 255-yard signature performance during Week 12’s win over the Rams, he’s the NFL’s new leading rusher (1,392 yards). Complacency hurts the Eagles at times. A No. 29 offensive sack rate is a glaring issue that needs to be fixed. Hurts needs to stay sharp in case Baltimore’s No. 2 run defense slows down Barkley. The Ravens have been hurt through the air at times this season (31st in passing yards allowed per game), leaving them susceptible to big plays if Hurts gets hot.

Controlling its own destiny in the division until an upset road loss in Cleveland, Pittsburgh tries to regroup against another Ohio opponent. Despite a lowly record, Cincinnati and its high-powered passing game delivers another dangerous test for the Steelers. Winless against teams above .500 this season, the Bengals are favored by a few points in this matchup coming off of their bye week. Leading the NFL in passing attempts and touchdowns, Joe Burrow needs to throw often with the Bengals’ inconsistent run game. Cincinnati hasn’t figured out its post-Joe Mixon backfield, with the Bengals ranked 27th in rushing offense. Against a top-five Pittsburgh run defense, it could be another Burrow-heavy afternoon for Cincinnati. Advertisement The Steelers will do everything to contain receiver Ja’Marr Chase, the NFL’s leader in receiving yards, yards after catch and receiving touchdowns. Even if Chase is kept in check, receiving counterpart Tee Higgins had a monster return in Week 11 against the Chargers. Lead back Chase Brown offers Burrow a decent check-down option despite inconsistent yardage as a runner. Pittsburgh was riding a five-game winning streak before a snowy loss to the Browns. Leading the league in time of possession with its run-heavy scheme, the Steelers will turn to their backs in the hopes of keeping Burrow off the field. Facing a below-average Cincinnati secondary (No. 23 in passing yards allowed), quarterback Russell Wilson seeks a consistent second option besides receiver George Pickens.

In the southeast corner of the Los Angeles Coliseum, as Saturday afternoon turned to night, Notre Dame’s head coach let three months of angst go. It was a guttural release, one that had been building since the Irish opened with a signature win at Texas A&M and followed it with a loss one week later that read like a death sentence. Advertisement Freeman had already had his ice bath around the 40-yard line, dumped on him by his players after he lifted them up all season. He’d already sung the alma mater a cappella in front of the Notre Dame section. And then he got to let it all out. Primal cheer, primal cheer for old Notre Dame, at a volume that’s endeared Freeman to this roster, to this program, to this school. “This is a special place,” Freeman said. “We got a really good football team, but we got an amazing university, and I wanted our fans to have that same feeling that we have as players in our program, and so it’s hard to describe that feeling, but it’s one I won’t forget.” GO DEEPER Notre Dame holds off USC: Takeaways from a Playoff-clinching win for the Fighting Irish In putting away USC 49-35 thanks to pick sixes by Christian Gray and Xavier Watts, Notre Dame not only clinched its spot in the College Football Playoff, it did something potentially bigger for its head coach. Freeman took the Notre Dame job trying to buck trends, which said a first-time head coach wouldn’t make it at a place where first-time head coaches fail. And when Notre Dame lost to Northern Illinois 84 days earlier — Freeman had that number on the tip of his tongue postgame — it felt like the Irish may be about to fail history class. Instead, Freeman feels much closer to Notre Dame head coaches on the other side of the ledger today, the ones who made moves in their third year. Ara Parseghian, Dan Devine and Lou Holtz won national titles that season. Brian Kelly played for one. Maybe Freeman won’t fly that close to the sun this winter. This Irish are probably too imperfect for that, even if nobody in the first 12-team College Football Playoff will be flawless. But Notre Dame will now get a chance to prove itself on the biggest stage for the first time under Freeman. Notre Dame couldn’t win in the Playoff unless it made the Playoff first. And now it has.

It’s an honor to be a part of this football program with these guys, with this coaching staff and to see where we were 84 days ago to where we’re at now. It’s a testament to the trust in the decisions that those guys in that locker room and the coaching staff and everybody that helps have made. Advertisement “And this is what it’s all about, man. It’s the journey, right? There’s a journey, and you can’t let the highest and highs and lowest and lows deter you from what you need to do to reach your goals. And so it’s awesome. I’m excited. We’re going to enjoy this thing. We’ll worry about the future later.” ""You learn the most about yourself when you're at your lowest points… I'm proud of these guys. They continued to battle through the ups and the downs… I'm a part of something special."" After a Gatorade bath and securing an 11th win, @NDFootball head coach Marcus Freeman… pic.twitter.com/xJY8x6KOPn — CBS Sports College Football 🏈 (@CBSSportsCFB) December 1, 2024  There is a future to worry about, which is better than the alternative. USC pushing Notre Dame offered a sobering reminder of what might ultimately turn the lights out on this season. The Irish have feasted on a schedule that’s helped make an elite defense look at times legendary. Notre Dame has been able to play bully ball on the ground, so well it has masked Riley Leonard the quarterback, who might not be able to win with his arm. Still, Notre Dame has played through injuries that would have sunk other seasons, Benjamin Morrison, Howard Cross, Boubacar Traore, Jordan Botelho, Gabe Rubio, Jason Onye, Ashton Craig and the hangover of Mitchell Evans and last year’s ACL tear. And Jeremiyah Love might be next, going down with a potential knee injury that could keep this force of nature on the bench. It’s been so much to play through, it’s fair to wonder when Notre Dame might not be able to make it to the other side. But like Freeman said, he can worry about the future in the future. “Listen, we have to celebrate this thing first,” Freeman said. “Like, these guys work way too hard not to take a moment and enjoy this victory. This is what I call team glory, and it’s when everybody in that locker room knows they had a part of us achieving that. It’s not one person.  It’s everybody that it takes getting their job done for us to achieve this great feeling that we have. So, we’re gonna enjoy this today, on this flight home and probably tomorrow.” Feel free to take a week. Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox.

When Notre Dame needed to change momentum, it got a fake punt from former starting quarterback turned walk-on wide receiver Tyler Buchner. When the Irish couldn’t ride Love, they got a long touchdown run from Price. With Gray struggling at corner, Notre Dame could rely on freshman Leonard Moore. And when Notre Dame needed a 60-yard punt, James Rendell boomed one. Advertisement That’s how a team wins 10 straight games after bottoming out in early September. The entire roster pulls its collective weight, regardless of pounds lifted. And they all listen to the guy giving the workout plan. “Everybody wants to talk about culture in college football,” Leonard said. “Everybody wants to claim they have a great football culture. I think this place is different. It starts with the very top. You’ve got a guy like coach Freeman, who walks into the facility every single day, and he knows every person’s name. “And he told me he asks himself: ‘What do I need to do today? Who do I need to be to elevate this program?’ He asks himself that every single day. And it’s very clear that he is the perfect fit for this program.” When Notre Dame looked spooked before taking the field at Texas A&M, Freeman took the pressure off with a bombastic pregame show that turned heads. When Notre Dame needed to snap in against Army, Freeman demanded “violence” from the roster. And when the Irish needed to be reminded about Northern Illinois until it rewired how they prepared, Freeman was there for that too. Good coaching can be many things. For Freeman, it’s been knowing which levers to pull, when to pull them and when to keep them down. It’s how Gray can go from disastrous second and third quarters to starring in the fourth. It’s how Leonard can throw an abysmal interception and guide the Irish over the finish line. “Sometimes you got to lose the game, right? Sometimes that’s life, you got to lose at the end of the day to gain and make a big jump,” Freeman said. “The greatest thing that happened to this program this season was a loss because it taught us what it takes to handle success. “It taught us what it takes to have success, and that’s why I said, just keep the pain. I don’t want to go back to that place. We don’t need to go back there to remember how it feels, but we’ll look back and be thankful for it.” Advertisement On Saturday evening, Notre Dame was thankful, not just for its destination in the College Football Playoff but for the path it traveled to get there. A season Freeman and Notre Dame needed to become good in the worst way has. And so Freeman could let it all out before leaving the field. After screaming into the void, Freeman embraced Aamil Wagner, then Jaden Greathouse, Rocco Spindler and Pat Coogan. Then Freeman exited the field. Notre Dame just made its biggest statement of the season. And it was impossible not to hear it. (Photo: Kevork Djansezian / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"It's personal with Texas A&M, but Texas was all business in dominating rivalry's return",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5959612/2024/12/01/texas-longhorns-steve-sarkisian-sec/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 10:00:11 GMT",The 2011 Texas team that waved goodbye to Texas A&amp;M finished 8-5. The 2024 Texas team that waved hello is a much different program.,"NCAAF COLLEGE STATION, Texas — The ball came loose, and Matthew McConaughey darted down the sideline. As the Longhorns jumped on Texas A&M quarterback Marcel Reed’s fumble, securing a 17-7 win, the Hollywood star and Texas’ “Minister of Culture” stopped on a dime, bent his knees and threw his arm out straight toward an end zone, signaling Texas possession with the seriousness and body language of a coach. Advertisement Then he turned toward the Texas section behind the bench and threw up the Hook ‘Em hand sign. No hopping up and down. No smiling. All business. Yes, the return of the Lone Star Showdown was a very big deal to fans in this state after 13 years without it. But Texas football has bigger dreams. It always has. Head coach Steve Sarkisian, hired to win it all and win the SEC, has built a fully operational battle station. He’s one win away from winning the SEC in the Longhorns’ first season in the league, while Texas A&M is, once again, rebuilding with a new coach. The state of these two programs looks a lot like it historically has looked: The Longhorns looking for titles and the Aggies looking for answers. For more than a decade, Texas and Texas A&M took swipes at each other from afar, their century-old college football rivalry torn apart by conference realignment when A&M left for the SEC in 2012 as Texas threw its weight around in the Big 12. Texas’ move to the SEC meant the rivalry would return to where it ended in 2011, at Kyle Field. Ticket prices reached the thousands of dollars. Friday’s Yell Practice pep rally turnout was the biggest anyone in town could remember. More than 109,000 people came to the game. The press box swayed. A spot in the SEC championship was on the line. Then the rivalry was renewed in the same way it ended, with a Texas victory. After all that hype and anticipation from fans, Texas itself mostly treated this like another game and finished it the way they’ve finished so many others this season, by taking an early lead and slowly choking the hope out of an opponent with ferocious defense. All business. And that’s what should worry Texas A&M the most. The 2011 Texas team that waved goodbye to Texas A&M finished 8-5. The 2024 Texas team that waved hello is a much different program. It left the Big 12 with a conference title and a College Football Playoff appearance last year. It’s now one win away from an SEC title in its debut season, with a CFP spot unofficially locked up. Advertisement Texas A&M had a decade’s head start on the Longhorns in the SEC. In one season, Texas has made their position in a new conference look the same as the old one. “A lot of our guys have been hearing since the day it got announced we were going to the SEC that we were going to struggle in the SEC, that it’d be hard, that we were going to come into this environment tonight and it was going to be the toughest environment in college football and we wouldn’t be ready for it,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said. “There were a lot of things we’ve been challenged with that have been brewing inside a lot of people in that locker room, coaches and players included. To do it in the fashion we did, that wasn’t a gimmick win.” Texas ran for 240 yards, nearly surpassing Texas A&M’s total offensive output (244). The same Texas run game that averaged 1.1 yards per carry against Georgia (including sacks) and just 3.4 per carry against Arkansas two weeks ago dominated the Aggies on Saturday night. A month ago, Sarkisian challenged the offense that it would have to run the ball better. Star left tackle Kelvin Banks Jr. left Saturday’s game early with an ankle injury and didn’t return. His future status will be key for national title hopes, but on Saturday, redshirt freshman Trevor Goosby more than held his own against the Aggies star lineman Nic Scourton. “We knew we had to step up to the plate and run the ball to open defenses,” said running back Tre Wisner, who took 33 carries for 186 yards. “It all comes down to grit and heart.” The game was only as close as it was because of Longhorn miscues. With a 17-0 lead, a Quinn Ewers pass was tipped and returned 93 yards for a Texas A&M touchdown. On the next drive, Ewers fumbled while sliding in the red zone. Texas also had a punt blocked in the fourth quarter, setting up a short field and a chance for A&M to make it a one-score game. But Texas’ defense made a goal line stand to all but end the game. Advertisement Ewers mostly played well, completing 17 of 28 passes for 218 yards and a touchdown. One turnover was his fault. The tipped interception wasn’t. His 26-yard run in the first quarter set up an Arch Manning touchdown run. Sarkisian said Ewers was far from 100 percent with an ankle injury, and the coach needed to see more from his quarterback in Thursday practice to know whether he would play. When Ewers kneeled the clock out, he held the ball and didn’t let it go. Through handshakes, hugs, selfies with fans and singing “The Eyes of Texas”, he kept the ball tucked tight. He transferred into Texas knowing the SEC move was coming, knowing he’d likely be the quarterback to play when the rivalry came back. He leaves it undefeated, 1-0. Texas was the better team top-to-bottom because Sarkisian and company built it that way, and it’s not changing anytime soon. Ewers appears on his way out to the NFL — he participated in Senior Day ceremonies last week — but next up is Manning, who looks like he may live up to his own five-star hype. Texas lost two NFL defensive tackles from a year ago and hasn’t missed a beat inside. Wisner is a sophomore. Texas is fourth in 247Sports’ Team Talent rankings. When Sarkisian took over in 2021, he went to work rebuilding the program from the trenches outward. Of the 11 former five-star recruits on the roster, three are offensive linemen. From the sideline, Texas’ size compares favorably to a top-level SEC team in a way it hadn’t before. The incoming recruiting class currently ranks sixth nationally by 247Sports and has four more five-star players. Texas A&M’s class is down at No. 19, with one five-star player. Now, in the transfer portal era, it’s easier than ever to turn around a team elsewhere. Maybe coach Mike Elko will find a transfer quarterback he likes better than Reed and Conner Weigman. But Elko has to deal with a reality that previous Texas A&M coaches didn’t. The Aggies’ SEC advantage over Texas in the recruiting pitch is gone, and Texas has a coach maximizing the potential of his own place. It’s a different battle. Losing this game won’t help. For all the rivalry hype, Saturday’s game featured little to no chippiness between players before or after the game. Athletic director Chris Del Conte was calm and reserved coming off the field. When some Texas players tried to stomp on the midfield Texas A&M logo, Sarkisian quickly brushed them away. Advertisement There are more important things to worry about, like next week’s SEC championship and the College Football Playoff spot the Longhorns have already sewn up. Texas and Texas A&M are back together again. That’s good for college football. But for anyone who thought Texas would face a daunting path and a big adjustment in the SEC, Saturday was a harsh wake-up call. Especially for the Aggies.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Back in Texas' shadow, Texas A&M's 12-year SEC head start can't prevent an old nightmare",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5959569/2024/12/01/texas-am-texas-mike-elko/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 10:00:10 GMT","One season into its SEC existence, Texas has passed the Aggies. Truthfully, the Longhorns already had.","NCAAF COLLEGE STATION, Texas — After Texas A&M’s final offensive possession went awry and the finality of the Aggies’ fate set in, Texas fans gleefully took the opportunity to rub salt in their fresh wound. Thousands of burnt orange-clad fans seated near the southeast tunnel at Kyle Field each put an arm up, with index finger and pinky extended, looking to their right at the Texas A&M student section. In rhythm, they rocked the “Hook ’em Horns” sign while unleashing a chant that filled the crisp night air while 100,000-plus Aggies in the building stood in stunned silence. Advertisement “S-E-C! S-E-C! S-E-C!” Thirteen years after Texas last broke the Aggies’ hearts in this very stadium and 12 years after Texas A&M initially planted its flag in the SEC, the Longhorns forcefully announced their arrival, doing something in their first year that the Aggies still have yet to do: clinch a berth in the SEC Championship Game. That’s what will sting the most about Texas 17, Texas A&M 7. Not the Longhorns’ fourth-down stop at the goal line with 4:36 left that killed A&M’s last real chance at narrowing the gap. Not the multiple opportunities that A&M squandered after Texas miscues. Not even the anemic offense A&M fielded in the biggest game of the season. It’s the fact that, 13 seasons into Texas A&M’s SEC membership, the Aggies’ chance to distance themselves from the shadow cast by their biggest rival just disappeared. Never mind that the Longhorns spent many of those 13 years floundering in college football’s abyss. Forget that the Aggies, too, made a grand arrival in their debut SEC campaign, riding Johnny Manziel, Mike Evans and Kevin Sumlin to a fun, action-packed 11-2 season that yielded a Heisman Trophy and helped fill the university’s coffers to the point that it could spend half-a-billion dollars to make Kyle Field the pristine stage it was on Saturday. Texas A&M has been good, but not great, since making its “100-year decision” — as then-president R. Bowen Loftin termed it — to leave the Big 12 for the SEC except for two seasons: 2012 and 2020. This year, under new head coach Mike Elko, was the Aggies’ chance to finally play for something real at season’s end, a trip to the SEC championship and an opportunity to remain in the College Football Playoff race. Instead, they’ll finish 8-4, with three consecutive conference losses after sitting atop the SEC standings at midseason. Advertisement “It sucks,” Elko said. “There’s no sugarcoating it.” One season into its SEC existence, Texas has passed the Aggies. Truthfully, the Longhorns already had, making the Playoff last year while the Aggies fired Jimbo Fisher — the coach who was supposed to lead them to SEC titles and make them national title contenders — and committed to pay him more than $70 million in buyout money through 2031. Texas A&M could try to wave that contrast away because Texas had accomplished that breakthrough as a member of the Big 12, not the rugged SEC. It’s different in this league. But since Steve Sarkisian arrived at Texas, the Longhorns have thoughtfully, gradually prepared themselves and built their team for this moment, and it’s paying off. Meanwhile, the Aggies massively underachieved in their final two seasons under Fisher, and Elko was brought in to fix it. The early returns were promising. Despite a season-opening loss to Notre Dame, A&M rattled off seven consecutive wins to put itself in the SEC’s driver’s seat. But some things can’t be fixed in one season. Texas has better offensive personnel than the Aggies do. If Sarkisian had his pick of the A&M receivers, there’s no guarantee any of them would start for the Longhorns. At the line of scrimmage — where SEC games are won and lost — Texas is also further ahead. Despite losing All-America left tackle Kelvin Banks to an ankle injury in the first quarter, the Longhorns didn’t miss a beat, subbing in redshirt freshman Trevor Goosby with minimal issues. The front paved the way for a 240-yard rushing performance, 186 of which came from running back Tre Wisner. “We (had) way too many misfits, way too (much) lack of leverage, way too many just simple execution errors,” Elko said. “They’re good, they’re talented, and hat’s off to them because they physically annihilated us.” Advertisement On offense, the Aggies couldn’t get tough yards when they needed them most. On fourth-and-1 at the Texas 10 on the game’s opening drive, the Longhorns stuffed A&M running back Amari Daniels for a turnover on downs. Late in the first half, A&M quarterback Marcel Reed tried to scramble for 3 yards, but the Texas front contained him and stopped him for 1. And the game-deciding sequence at the Texas 1-yard line was a mano-a-mano beatdown by the Longhorns’ defensive line. By time Daniels received the handoff from Reed at the 5, three Texas defensive linemen were already past the line of scrimmage. One of them was edge rusher Ethan Burke, who screamed around the left edge, untouched, to hammer Daniels for a loss. Ballgame. “We did terrible, absolutely terrible,” Elko said in assessment of A&M’s performance against Texas’ defensive line. “We got physically beat up. And in order to win games in this league, we can’t do that.” Throughout this season, Elko has been determined to go for it in fourth-and-short situations. It’s part of the identity he’s trying to build in his first year at Texas A&M. But the shortcomings on Saturday and in other instances this season show the Aggies still have far to go to reach that goal. “If we want to be the team that we need to be, we have to be able to convert fourth-and-1s,” he said. “You have to, and obviously, we didn’t.” Even beyond those critical situations, moving the ball was a chore for the Aggies. After two plays of 15-plus yards on the opening drive, A&M didn’t have another such play for the remainder of the first half. Finding open receivers downfield was difficult, and the Aggies spent more time going east and west than north and south. Texas finished with five passing plays of more than 20 yards; A&M had one. The Longhorns had eight runs of 10-plus yards; the Aggies had one. Advertisement Texas A&M got beat by a Texas team that was simply better. Perhaps the foundation Elko laid in Year 1 will pay long-term dividends. But on Saturday night, none of that mattered. Only the all-too-familiar scene of the Longhorns celebrating on Texas A&M’s turf. Thirteen years and six days after Justin Tucker split the uprights to say goodbye to A&M, the Longhorns returned to Kyle Field on Saturday to push the rival Aggies aside, extend their series lead to 77-37-5 and dance their way to Atlanta for a rematch with Georgia. The Aggies, meanwhile, are in a place that’s all too familiar. “There’s a big difference between the SEC Championship Game and the Music City Bowl and the Texas Bowl,” Texas A&M linebacker Taurean York said. “One of those you want to play in and one of those you don’t. “We’ll be playing one of those games that people are really not caring about, people are not watching.” (Photo: Alex Slitz / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

But with the Colts stuck in the mushy middle and the Patriots going through a rebuild, the game has lost almost all of its luster. Especially from the Patriots side, where they are nearly a field-goal home underdog. Advertisement While things look bleak for the Patriots overall, there is a huge bright spot emerging in the presence of rookie quarterback Drake Maye. Despite the team’s record, it is easy to see why the Patriots used the No. 3 pick of the draft on him and why they are excited about his development. He has a chance to really shine on Sunday going against a Colts defense that is allowing 233.3 passing yards per game (27th in the NFL). On the opposite side of the field, things are not quite as rosy for the Colts quarterback situation. Anthony Richardson is still going through growing pains as a young passer. He got his starting job back, and after an impressive come-from-behind win on the road against the New York Jets, he quickly reverted back to inconsistency against Detroit, completing just 11-of-28 passes. He has completed under 50 percent of his passes in four of his eight starts this season, with two additional games where he was at exactly 50 percent. The Patriots defense was supposed to be a bright spot this season but has badly underachieved. If Richardson can’t put up numbers against him, it will be really concerning for the Colts.

The Buccaneers are road favorites for this divisional clash. Tampa Bay (5-6) is a game behind the Arizona Cardinals for the final wild-card spot in the NFC. It’s the same deficit for the division lead, but the Atlanta Falcons have already swept the Bucs, so they need to make the most of their remaining divisional games. Carolina (3-8) is well out of the postseason hunt but has been playing better lately. The Panthers won back-to-back games before falling to the two-time defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs last week on a walk-off field goal. Advertisement Quarterback Bryce Young has bounced back from his benching earlier this season and is coming off his best performance. He finished with 263 passing yards and a touchdown with no turnovers against the Chiefs’ top-10 defense. Young may continue on this upward trajectory against a Tampa Bay defense that is giving up 255.5 passing yards per game (29th in the NFL), has allowed 20 touchdown passes, and recorded only five interceptions. For the Bucs, last week’s rout of the New York Giants was the sixth time they have scored 30 or more points. Baker Mayfield is seventh in the league in passing yards (2,799) and third in touchdown passes (24), despite top wide receivers Mike Evans and Chris Godwin missing significant time. Godwin (dislocated ankle) is on injured reserve but Evans (hamstring) returned after a three-game absence last Sunday and finished with a team-high 68 receiving yards. Tampa Bay also has been productive on the ground, ranking 10th in the league in rushing offense at 128.1 yards per game. Contrast that to Carolina, which is dead last against the run (160.1 yards per game allowed), and it’s understandable why the Bucs are favored as they aim to stay relevant in both the divisional and wild-card races.

Despite their records, they are both still very much alive in their divisional playoff races and the Rams find themselves as nearly a field-goal road favorite. Advertisement The Saints are coming in off of their bye week and have won consecutive games since replacing head coach Dennis Allen with interim head coach Darren Rizzi. That has helped them crawl back to within two games of the NFC South lead with a fairly favorable remaining schedule ahead of them. There is almost no margin for error the rest of the way, but you don’t have to squint too hard to see a potential path. That path almost certainly has to include a win over the Rams on Sunday. Aside from being a big game for both teams’ slim playoff hopes, the matchup also has a chance to be one of the highest-scoring on the NFL schedule this week. The over/under is fluctuating but sits around the second-highest total of the week. New Orleans has hit the over in seven of its 11 games (including four of its six home games), while the Rams have hit the over in six of their 11 games.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Barcelona 1 Las Palmas 2: Lead eroded, lack of depth exposed and De Jong heckled",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5958703/2024/12/01/barcelona-las-palmas-jong-flick-briefing/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 08:59:28 GMT",The side from the Canary Islands won for the first time at Barca in 53 years as the leaders' stuttering domestic form continued apace,"La Liga Everything about the end of this game was surreal. Hansi Flick clapped a crowd that had long since fallen silent. The area of Barcelona’s home stadium that usually houses their noisiest, most partisan fans was empty anyway, with the supporters usually in those seats still banned as the club are yet to pay fines totalling €21,000 (£17,450; $22,214) imposed on them by Spain’s La Liga and UEFA, European football’s governing body, for the behaviour of some in that section. Then there was the kick-off time, with a team more used to starting games at 9pm being asked to begin here at 2pm. Advertisement And, of course, there was the scoreline. Rewind 10 minutes and Flick, having glanced at his watch, looked back towards the home dugout and shook his head as if to acknowledge to his coaching staff that this was not going to be their day.  Las Palmas had not won at Barcelona for 53 years. This was no way for Barca to celebrate the club’s 125th anniversary the day before, though, in truth, perhaps we should have seen an upset coming; after all, they lost to Mallorca as they commemorated their centenary on this same weekend in 1999. Nothing came off here, with the mood of celebration falling completely flat. Barcelona wore the red-and-blue halved shirts and white shorts of the club’s early years, and even unveiled a new mascot — a cat, called “Cat” (short for Catalan) — and trumpeted their new 125th-anniversary anthem, but they were still beaten. All the emotion that had been built up at the gala celebration held in the city’s Liceo theatre on Friday evening petered out. Nothing could get the team going. A fixture that had looked straightforward ended up proving anything but. The 2-1 defeat means Flick’s side have now gone three La Liga games without a win having failed to see off Real Sociedad, Celta Vigo and Las Palmas — all relative low-lights in Spanish football’s top division. This was the first time summer appointment Flick’s team had lost at Montjuic, the 1992 Olympics venue Barca are using for home games during extensive renovations at their iconic Camp Nou stadium, and the first time a visiting side had managed two goals against them there. The impressive start instigated by their German manager this season is tailing off badly. This team are on a downward trend. Remember when everything around Barcelona felt rosy? That fantastic week in late October when they established their status as the team to beat in La Liga by thrashing Real Madrid 4-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu, having demolished their European bete noire, Bayern Munich, in the Champions League a few days earlier. The memories of those giddy occasions are already fading fast, and they happened barely a month ago. Advertisement Flick’s team were six points ahead of Carlo Ancelotti’s team after that win in the capital and it looked like the title was effectively sealed. Barca were playing at an excellent level, too; their offside trap was catching out opponents, they were pressing high and effectively, and the squad had bought into a fast-flowing style of play. They were on a different level to last season under Xavi. Yet, in the games since those eye-catching wins, the momentum and belief have drained away. Against Las Palmas, the team lacked those qualities completely. The side from the Canary Islands went man-to-man in midfield early on yesterday, and Barcelona could never break free of their shackles. There were no effective combinations and, even when the visitors relaxed their approach, Flick’s players were still slow and imprecise in their movement and passing. As an example of the home players being below their level, take Robert Lewandowski. He has been having a spectacular season. He is La Liga’s top scorer with 19, hit the 100th Champions League goal of his career in midweek and is only four away from equalling his La Liga tally for all of last term. But here, the 36-year-old echoed all his toils of 2023-24. He drew a blank against Las Palmas even when Pau Victor, who came on for the last few minutes, found him alone and in front of goal at the death. The Pole took too long to control the ball and, by the time he had gathered his composure, defenders had swarmed around him. Barcelona have taken just one point from nine and all the advantage gained at the Bernabeu has disappeared. If Madrid win there against Getafe today and away to Valencia in their game in hand, they will top the table. “We will have to accept that Madrid can go above us,” Flick said after the match. “If any player is disconnected, the team doesn’t function as it should. We have quality. The team tried for 90 minutes but, today, we came up short. We didn’t know how to score and we will have to have a different attitude. “We have to accept that November was a bad month. We have to hope that it will be different in December.” How short Barcelona are in wide areas in the absence of Lamine Yamal, who has been out for three weeks with an ankle injury but returned yesterday, has been exposed over this dismal run of form. Pablo Torre started against Las Palmas. He is a player with great ability, but there is still a drop-off in quality compared with Yamal. On the right, Raphinha scored again. But he did not offer his usual threat. Neither did Jules Kounde, the right-back behind him. The group had found a way to overcome Yamal’s absence — and the reality that this team have come to lean so heavily on a 17-year-old — to prevail against visitors Brest in the Champions League in midweek but, here, familiar problems appeared. Yamal did come on for the second half but, understandably, was rusty. He lacked accuracy in his passing, like the rest of the side. Barcelona will be delighted to have him back, but they cannot rely on him as they have grown to. The lack of viable alternatives has been exposed in his absence. There is an elephant in the room at Barcelona: Frenkie de Jong. “I didn’t expect anything like that, but I’m very happy with the way people are treating me,” De Jong told Movistar TV back on October 1, after finally returning to action after 163 days out with an ankle injury. That day, against Swiss visitors Young Boys in the Champions League, the fans applauded him when he took the field at Montjuic. The reception took a weight off the Dutch midfielder’s shoulders. He was aware he had yet to convince many Barcelona supporters, despite being at the club for over five years now, but that show of affection suggested he could still turn the tide. Two months later, against Las Palmas, he was whistled by a Barca crowd for the second time in a week. The supporters demand an attitude and leadership from him, as one of the team’s captains, that he has rarely shown at this club. So much had been expected of him when he arrived from Ajax in his home country in summer 2019. But he has never found an ideal position in Barcelona’s system — whether as a holding midfielder, a more advanced role or as one of a double pivot — despite many of his team-mates, Joao Felix and Joao Cancelo among them, stating publicly that he is the player who impresses them most in training. Advertisement De Jong is also one of the club’s highest-paid players, and a legacy of former president Josep Maria Bartomeu’s time at the club. In the last few games, he has rarely stood out. His displays have been eclipsed by those of Pedri and Marc Casado, with the Netherlands international looking so tentative. He seems troubled by his ankle problems, someone playing within himself. And that has cost him a key role in the team. “I know it’s very important for him to have minutes, but we analyse every game and the important thing is to win,” Flick said of De Jong at his pre-match press conference. “I want the best possible team and that’s how we make decisions. And that’s why he might not get as many minutes as he would like or as much as we would like.” He was introduced just before the hour against Las Palmas and, as mentioned, was greeted with whistles. It was notable, too, that Raphinha did not hand him the captain’s armband, having done that on previous occasions this season. Maybe patience is wearing thin.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"After an NBA Cup win, 'exhausted' Pistons lose to 76ers in second of back-to-backs",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5959453/2024/12/01/pistons-exhausted-lose-to-76ers/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 08:11:38 GMT","From the opening tip, Detroit lacked the energy necessary to make its game against the Sixers competitive.","NBA DETROIT — Generally, when NBA teams play back-to-back games, they’ll fly directly to the next city where they’re playing after finishing their first game. Arrival times are usually early mornings, but not quite a few hours from sunrise, either. That wasn’t the Pistons’ reality when they were in transit back to Detroit from Indianapolis on Saturday morning. Advertisement Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff said postgame that his team was “exhausted” because of travel delays and that they played an NBA Cup game the night before. Since its inception a year ago, the NBA Cup has bred a different sense of urgency from players, especially considering each of them on the winning team earned $500,000 last season. Combine the energy his team expended with them not reaching their beds until roughly 5 a.m. ET, and for Bickerstaff, it was a recipe for Saturday’s lackluster performance. To compound matters, Detroit (9-13) has played 22 games, more than any other team in the association. “I mean, our guys were exhausted,” Bickerstaff said after his team lost 111-96 to the Philadelphia 76ers. “We sat on the runway last night until 2:30 (a.m.), 3 o’clock in the morning. Got home at 4 o’clock in the morning in the snowstorm. They drove home, by the time they got to bed it was 5 a.m, 5:30 a.m. I thought they went out and they dug down. “They tried to give it what they had. We just didn’t have it tonight, and that’s fair. They tried but today was just a rough day for them.” Ausar flew for this block pic.twitter.com/bPKFY2GSpR — Detroit Pistons (@DetroitPistons) December 1, 2024  From the opening tip, the Pistons lacked the energy necessary to make it a competitive game which was evident when Detroit allowed Philadelphia to begin the game on a 22-7 run. While coach Bickerstaff spoke postgame, he was sure to urge the NBA to reconsider having teams play back-to-back games when the front end is an NBA Cup game, because of the intense nature of those matchups. Bickerstaff likely has a valid point regarding the atmosphere those games provide and the heightened energy and focus it requires from players, but the Pistons are 1-4 on the second night of back-to-backs this season — whether they were NBA Cup or regular-season games. If Detroit is to take that proverbial next step, it will need to remedy its ways when it comes to back-to-back games. Advertisement The Pistons still have 10 back-to-backs remaining on their schedule. “I’ll scream it to the rooftops, and I hope people will pay attention and they’ll listen,” Bickerstaff said. “I think the league has done a wonderful thing by adding the Cup series. Obviously, as time goes on, there will be adjustments that are made to it, but you should not play a back-to-back after one of those games. The guys are competing their tails off to go out and win at a high level, and it’s just extremely difficult to come back the next night and have to play a back-to-back to follow it up. “So again, hopefully, it’s something that they’ll look at. I’m not a scheduling expert by any means. I just think it’s extremely difficult for guys to go out and compete at that intensity that we’re asking them to, because it means so much, and then to come back and fly and play the next night. I just think it’s really difficult.” Adding to that difficulty was Cade Cunningham being a late scratch after otherwise being listed as healthy and coming off of a double-double in his return from a three-game absence. Malik Beasley continued his consistency from downtown to lead the Pistons in scoring with 19 points, six rebounds and four assists on 6-for-9 shooting from the field and 4 of 5 from 3-point range. Beasley now ranks third in the NBA in made 3s thus far, with 79, trailing only All-Stars Anthony Edwards and LaMelo Ball. Jaden Ivey added 15 points and five assists but on 5-of-16 shooting. Guard Wendell Moore Jr., who scored 11 points in 16 minutes, was just a minus-one despite Detroit losing by 15 points. While Bickerstaff gave his team grace for their performance, Moore held himself and his teammates accountable. “We started off slow but at the end of the day we are the ones out there on the floor,” Moore said at his postgame news conference. “At the end of the day, we have to show up and play basketball. Philadelphia came out and played a good game. They hit a lot of shots early. I think we did a good job fighting to get out of the hole. We have some moral victories we can take from this game. Advertisement “We could have come out and laid down, but I feel like the whole team put up a good fight.” Moore and the rest of the Pistons will have Sunday off before likely practicing Monday and hosting the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday for another NBA Cup game that will be a battle of the undefeated teams in Group B.

Iowa State’s last league title came in 1912.,"NCAAF The 2024 Big 12 Championship Game is set: Arizona State will face Iowa State at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, next Saturday (noon ET, ABC). The Sun Devils (10-2, 7-2 Big 12) and Cyclones (10-2, 7-2 Big 12) both clinched spots with wins on Saturday and favorable tiebreaker scenarios. Nine of the Big 12’s sixteen teams entered the holiday weekend still in contention for the title game, according to the conference. Advertisement No. 16 Arizona State defeated Arizona 49-7 in the Territorial Cup to finish the regular season on a five-game winning streak. The Sun Devils will play in the championship game in their first season as members of the Big 12 after head coach Kenny Dillingham’s squad was picked last in the league’s preseason media poll. Star running back Cam Skattebo rushed for 177 yards and three touchdowns against Arizona, and Sam Leavitt completed 17 of 22 passes for 291 yards and three touchdowns. Arizona State’s last conference title was a shared Pac-10 championship in 2007. No. 18 Iowa State defeated No. 24 Kansas State 29-21 to claim a Farmageddon victory and the first 10-win season in program history. The Cyclones were outgained by K-State but forced a pair of turnovers in a frigid game in Ames, Iowa. Quarterback Rocco Becht tossed two touchdown passes, and the offense rushed for 187 yards in the win. Iowa State’s last league title came in 1912 as members of the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association, a predecessor to the Big Eight Conference. BYU and Colorado also finished 7-2 in league play to force a four-way tie atop the Big 12 standings, but Arizona State and Iowa State advance via the league’s tiebreaker policies, a matchup that wasn’t finalized until BYU’s 30-18 win over Houston in the late window on Saturday. The Sun Devils (No. 16) and Cyclones (No. 18) entered the weekend as the Big 12’s two highest-ranked teams in the latest College Football Playoff rankings. The winner of next week’s championship game is certain to earn one of the five automatic bids to the expanded 12-team Playoff field. The question is whether the champion will do enough in the eyes of the selection committee to earn a first-round bye as one of the four highest-ranked conference title winners, which is not guaranteed to the four power conferences. No. 11 Boise State (11-1) will face No. 22 UNLV (10-2) next Friday in the Mountain West Championship Game, and a win for the Broncos could keep them ahead of the Big 12 champion in the final Playoff rankings and clinch one of the top four seeds. The next batch of CFP rankings will be released on Tuesday. (Photo of Sam Leavitt: Kelsey Grant / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,LA Galaxy outlast Seattle Sounders to earn first MLS Cup berth since 2014,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5959519/2024/12/01/la-galaxy-seattle-sounders-results-score/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 05:40:56 GMT",LA will now host MLS Cup next Saturday against the New York Red Bulls.,"MLS The LA Galaxy attack was flying going into Saturday night’s Western Conference final. Seeking their first MLS Cup berth in 10 years, things did not come so easily against the Seattle Sounders. It took more than 85 minutes for the Galaxy to unlock Seattle’s organized approach, but Dejan Joveljic got on the end of a pass from Riqui Puig and beat Sounders goalkeeper Stefan Frei to lift the Galaxy to a 1-0 win. Waiting to make his move ♟️@JoveljicDejan lights @dignityhealthsp on FIRE! pic.twitter.com/P0mcyvCNhx — LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) December 1, 2024  LA will now host MLS Cup next Saturday against the New York Red Bulls, two of the league’s original franchises meeting in the championship. It is the Galaxy’s first appearance in the championship final since winning MLS Cup in 2014. “Just staying with it,” Galaxy coach Greg Vanney told Apple TV, when asked about the resiliency his side had to show to move into the title game. “There were stretches when we just had to defend and protect our goal. (Seattle is) not the best defense in the league for nothing. We knew it was going to be a challenge. Advertisement “It has been a long time since we lifted a trophy, but we have got one more (win) left — to do what we really set out to do.” The combination of Puig to Joveljic on the game-winning finish was fitting. Those two players were early building blocks in a roster that has helped turn around a Galaxy franchise that had been incredibly disappointing in the last few years. After the final whistle, Puig kept his head under a towel as he hugged Vanney, seemingly crying into his coach’s shoulder. Last year, LA finished in 26th place out of 29 teams. Those struggles led to an overhaul in the front office. Longtime president Chris Klein and technical director Jovan Kirovski were out. Will Kuntz, a former New York Yankees and MLS executive who also helped build the Galaxy’s crosstown rival LAFC, was in as the new general manager. Under Kuntz, the Galaxy spent around $20 million in transfer fees on two stars, Gabriel Pec and Joseph Paintsil. The two wingers were a departure from the Galaxy’s longtime star-driven, big-name approach. Paintsil and Pec may have had less name recognition, but they didn’t lack on-field value. LA would go on to finish second in the Western Conference by goal differential tiebreaker. The two DP signings turned the team around. Pec had 16 goals and 14 assists in the regular season; Paintsil added 10 goals and 10 assists. No two players benefited more from the arrival of the two wingers than Puig and Joveljic, two standout players who were still not fully hitting their potential impact. Joveljic would score 15 regular-season goals with six assists. Puig had 13 goals and 15 assists. In the biggest moment of the season, it was those two that combined to lift the Galaxy to the win. The Sounders were left heartbroken by a loss in a game that they approached with a near-perfect gameplan on the road. The Galaxy had run over and through every team they faced in the postseason, but the Sounders not only limited LA for much of the game, they were the better team for large chunks of Saturday night. Despite controlling the game, however, Seattle couldn’t find the back of the net and LA pounced on a mistake in those final minutes. Puig took a turnover and fed a perfectly-weighted pass into the path of Joveljic, who turned his right foot around the ball and past Frei at the near post.  (Jeff Rueter / The Athletic) It was Joveljic’s 20th goal of the season across the regular season and playoffs. The Galaxy are now one win away from a tremendous one-year turnaround. In LA’s way for what would be a sixth MLS Cup — the Galaxy’s five Cups are most in MLS history — are the seventh-seeded New York Red Bulls, which came into the postseason having won just two of their previous 20 games.

St. John’s confirmed the Hall of Fame coach’s death Saturday night. The school did not provide details on the cause of his death. In Memoriam of Lou Carnesecca (1925-2024) pic.twitter.com/wpSon2v9k2 — St. John's Men’s Basketball (@StJohnsBBall) December 1, 2024  Carnesecca won 526 games and lost just 200 in his 24 years at St. John’s, leading the team to 18 NCAA Tournaments and the 1985 Final Four. He looked like everybody’s favorite uncle, a pocket-sized man in a world full of giants, shuffling about in his ugly sweaters. Lovable “Looie,” the king of one-liners and the maestro of the run-on sentence, charmed them all, and as it turns out, snookered them all. Advertisement “Looie? Please, he’d start the game with a, ‘Bless you, my son,’ and then add a bunch of words I won’t repeat,’’ former Maryland coach Gary Williams said. “He had a mouth on him. He just made sure everyone knew he went to Mass in the morning.” Always high theatre, Carnesecca also was high caliber, the self-described lousy basketball player crafting a program stuffed with local high school stars who became the toast of New York. Coaching at a time when Big East basketball had more plot twists than a Broadway play, Carnesecca was cast perfectly for St. John’s. A native New Yorker who believed the city had all he needed to build a winner, Carnesecca trumpeted the city’s parochialism for all it was worth. St. John’s was New York’s team, playing in New York’s basketball epicenter, Madison Square Garden, and Carnesecca served as the perfect showman. Animated on the sidelines and a colorful quote in the newspapers, he endeared himself to a town that suffers neither fools nor phonies because he was real. “He never made an excuse, never said anything but ‘great game,’’’ former Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim said. “Never blamed anybody. In many ways, he was the best to compete against. It was never any of that bulls—. I have tremendous respect for him, probably the most I have for any coach that I’ve coached against.’’ Carnesecca grew up in Manhattan, the son of a grocery store owner who dreamed of something bigger for his son. He tried to pursue his father’s more scholarly ambitions, but the kid who grew up dashing from basketball playground to baseball sandlot couldn’t imagine a life without sports. Carnesecca idolized the local legends, college players and coaches of his youth, wide-eyed as he watched them play at Madison Square Garden. Carnesecca tried to realize his parents’ ambitions, even enrolling in a pre-med program at Fordham. But he transferred to St. John’s after one year. Advertisement “I told him I wanted to be a coach and my mother said, ‘Look what you raised, he disrespected the family.’ They wanted me to be a doctor,’’ Carnesecca once said. Instead, when he graduated, he went straight to the basketball court. He landed a job at his old high school, St. Ann’s (now Archbishop Molloy). He coached his first game in the Garden with St. Ann’s against another Queens team coached by Rocco Valvano, whose son, Jim, would become a basketball legend in his own right. What Carnesecca failed to achieve as a player, he soon realized as a coach. Although strict and tough, he was also a people person and a teacher and loved relating to his players. He devised unorthodox practice schemes — he liked to make his players shoot over a broom in practice to learn how to arc the ball over shot-blockers — but could X and O with anyone. After an initial 11-loss season, St. Ann’s lost just 23 games in the next six seasons. In 1958, the high school team finished 32-0. Carnesecca’s coaching prowess — and high school connections — got the attention of college coaches, and after that perfect season, he landed an assistant gig beside Joe Lapchick at St. John’s. Carnesecca’s friendly demeanor and New York authenticity helped St. John’s win plenty of living rooms in recruiting. Mandatory retirement rules forced Lapchick to step down when he turned 65 in 1965, and athletic director Jack Kaiser tabbed Carnesecca, the obvious choice, for the head coaching job. Carnesecca continued the success Lapchick began, earning Metropolitan Coach of the Year honors in his second season. But after five years, he had his head turned by the pro game and jumped to the New York Nets of the ABA. His second team made it to the ABA Finals in 1972, but after star Rick Barry left, so did the winning. “It wasn’t for me,’’ Carnesecca said of his dalliance with the pros. Advertisement By good fortune, just as Carnesecca was looking for an exit plan, his St. John’s replacement, Frank Mulzoff, was writing his own. Unable to agree with university administrators on the length of a new contract, Mulzoff walked and Kaiser, the athletic director, turned to Carnesecca, offering him the job again. “If Frank didn’t go, I would be cutting salami!” Carnesecca joked. Instead, he came home and never entertained leaving again. St. John’s flourished anew under Carnesecca, the coach drawing on his lifelong contacts to convince local kids to stay home and star. “I think the furthest we went was Jersey,’’ he said. He found stars in the high schools and the playgrounds, using the draw of starring for the hometown team and playing at the Garden. At the time, East Coast basketball still played second fiddle to its peers in the ACC, with the Northeast lacking the organization that a conference affiliation offered. So when St. John’s knocked off Duke in the 1979 NCAA Tournament second round, the victory sent shock waves around the country and announced St. John’s as a new player on the national scene. That team would go on to the regional finals before losing to underdog Penn. By the next season, St. John’s had a new home. Carnesecca wasn’t initially sold on Dave Gavitt’s pitch for an East Coast-based conference. He liked the way things were, scheduling as he saw fit. But Gavitt wooed the coach over a few bottles of wine, and immediately, Carnesecca saw Gavitt’s plan for the genius idea that it was. Selling St. John’s became even easier in the Big East. Carnesecca coaxed more and more players to stay home and star. He signed Bill Wennington out of Long Island, Mark Jackson out of Brooklyn and Walter Berry, who carried the nickname “The Truth,” from Benjamin Franklin High to the St. John’s campus. Advertisement In 1981, he landed his biggest recruit, a sweet shooter out of Brooklyn who was a regular at Carnesecca’s camps. Chris Mullin considered all of the college basketball powerhouses, but in the end, he couldn’t find a good reason to leave home. Together, he and Carnesecca elevated St. John’s to its pinnacle, the arrival of the great player dovetailing perfectly with the arrival of another high school great to the Big East, Patrick Ewing at Georgetown. The two players put their schools and conference on the national stage, deepening old rivalries forged in the ECAC and igniting new ones with Big East members. The same St. John’s team viewed as an upstart when it knocked off Duke grew in national prominence, led by the entertaining coach who was always ready with a quip. It all coalesced perfectly in 1985 when St. John’s rolled to the No. 1 ranking and a showdown with No. 2 Georgetown. Earlier that season, an under-the-weather Carnesecca tossed on a sweater — fairly hideous maroon, with V-shaped stripes in blue and red — before a game against Pittsburgh. St. John’s won, and the superstitious Carnesecca kept wearing the sweater. St. John’s kept winning, all the way up to that February game against Georgetown. It was a game built for the hype machine — No. 1 versus No. 2, rivals, Mullin versus Ewing — on national television. “Thick with tension,’’ was how broadcaster Len Berman remembered it. Until John Thompson Jr., whipped open his gray suit jacket, revealing an exact replica of Carnesecca’s sweater. “It immediately diffused all of the tension,’’ former Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese remembered. Everyone remembers the sweater game. Few remember Carnesecca’s response. The next time he faced Thompson, he walked onto the court with a string of white towels tied together, managers holding them aloft as if he was a king in a processional. That was always the thing about Carneseccca; he could give as much as he could take and was as much a part of the Big East mayhem as his peers. But between his colloquialisms and his size, he got away with more. He cussed at officials and extended the coaching box to near halfcourt, rarely earning so much as a second glance let alone a technical. “I don’t know if it was his size or people couldn’t understand what the hell he was saying,’’ former Seton Hall coach P.J. Carlesimo said. “He said some unbelievable stuff, but he also said it in a nice way.’’ Advertisement And to Boeheim’s point, Carneseccca handled losing with grace. The 1985 St. John’s team, easily his best, won its way to the Final Four, one of a trio of Big East teams to make it to the national semifinal. Once again, though, Georgetown bested its rival to advance to the title game. Asked about the loss years later, Carnesecca chose to talk about the ride instead. “It was wonderful,’’ he said. Carnesecca retired in 1992 and was inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame the same year. In 2004, the school renamed Alumni Hall in his honor. Carnesecca never coached again but never quite left St. John’s either. He retained an office on campus, operating as the school’s de facto goodwill ambassador, a regular at games until his health made the trips a little more difficult. A trail of coaches failed to match his success at St. John’s. Mike Jarvis took the team to the Elite Eight in 1999, the deepest run for a St. John’s team not coached by Carnesecca. “You know what it was for me?” Carnesecca said. “It was heaven.’’ (Top photo of Lou Carnesecca and his players at the 1983 Big East Tournament: Andy Hayt / Sports Illustrated via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

That was the lone blemish on the league slate of SEC newcomer Texas, the only team in the 16-member league to survive conference play with just one loss. Both the Longhorns and Bulldogs have greater than 99 percent odds to make the College Football Playoff field, according to the latest projections from The Athletic’s Austin Mock. Texas nearly doubled up Texas A&M in total yards and dominated in the trenches, holding Aggies dual-threat quarterback Marcel Reed in check for much of the night and running for 243 yards. The Longhorns jumped out to a 17-0 halftime lead thanks to a touchdown run from backup quarterback Arch Manning and a touchdown pass from starter Quinn Ewers, which appeared to give their defense plenty of cushion. GO DEEPER What does the return of Texas-Texas A&M mean? Here's what I saw before, during and after Texas A&M got the momentum swing it had been looking for all game when cornerback Will Lee Jr. stepped in front of a tipped pass from Ewers and sprinted 93 yards the other way for a pick six with just over five minutes left in the third quarter. And just when it seemed Texas A&M’s comeback had run out of steam in the fourth quarter, Jahdae Walker blocked a Texas punt, and the Aggies took over at the Texas 19. But on a fourth-and-goal from inside the 1-yard line, Ethan Burke broke through the line and stonewalled Amari Daniels on a run up the middle, ending the Aggies’ last best chance to get back into the game. Saturday night’s game was the first meeting between the teams since 2011; the rivalry was paused when Texas A&M left the Big 12 for the SEC and restarted when Texas followed suit 13 years later. Below, Sam Khan Jr., Chris Vannini and David Ubben offer their takeaways from a high-energy night in College Station for the Lone Star Showdown. Advertisement The Longhorns did what they could to keep A&M in the game with their mistakes. The pick six and the blocked punt allowed A&M to threaten late. But with the game on the line and A&M trying to punch it in on fourth-and-goal from the 1, Texas’ defensive line asserted its will. Defensive tackles Vernon Broughton and Bill Norton plugged up the middle, and Burke flew around the left edge to hammer Daniels for a loss, killing the Aggies’ final real chance to make it a game. So much was made of Texas’ move to the SEC and whether the Longhorns would be ready. They more than answered the call this season with strong talent and depth on both sides of the line of scrimmage, built through recruiting with a few key transfer portal additions on the defensive line sprinkled in this summer. After Texas lost NFL Draft picks Byron Murphy and T’Vondre Sweat, some wondered how the Longhorns would hold up. Finding two tackles that talented and dominant is difficult. While nobody has quite approached the level of play that duo reached, Broughton, Alfred Collins, Norton, Jermayne Lole and a host of others have more than answered the call and helped Texas’ defense remain one of the best in the country. ETHAN BURKE WITH THE STOP ❌🛑@eburke4lax pic.twitter.com/gaj2SZcPuN — Texas Football (@TexasFootball) December 1, 2024  Texas A&M’s best chance to make this a game was to jump out to a quick start and apply pressure to Texas. The Aggies did nothing of the sort. Their promising first drive lasted nine plays and gained 65 yards but ended in a turnover on downs. After A&M’s defense forced Texas into a three-and-out on the subsequent drive, the Aggies didn’t take advantage, as Reed threw an interception on A&M’s second possession. Advertisement The Aggies generated two plays of 15-plus yards on the first drive and then did not have a gain that big the rest of the first half. So much of A&M’s offense went east and west, not north and south, and A&M never really challenged Texas’ secondary. One of the biggest issues A&M had in the season-opening loss to Notre Dame was its receivers’ inability to separate from the Fighting Irish defensive backs. That weakness seemed to rear its ugly head again, and without a consistent running game threat, it doomed A&M to a meager offensive output. GO DEEPER Texas A&M's 12-year SEC head start on Texas leads to same nightmare After a week of uncertainty around Ewers’ health and a season in which he went from Heisman hopeful to perceived liability, Ewers looked like the early-season version of himself in College Station, until two third-quarter turnovers briefly kept the Aggies alive. Ewers broke off a 26-yard run on the second drive of the game, showing that his high-ankle injury didn’t seem to be bothering him too much. His previous longest run of the season had been nine yards. He completed passes into small windows, got the ball out on time and kept the offense ahead of the chains with help from a strong running game. Right on the money 🎯🤘@QuinnEwers @Jaydonblue23 pic.twitter.com/libA5zl92I — Texas Football (@TexasFootball) December 1, 2024  But in the third quarter, with the Longhorns up 17-0 and looking to put the game away, a tipped Ewers pass was intercepted and returned 93 yards for a touchdown. Ewers again drove Texas into the red zone on the next drive, but he had the ball knocked out while going for a slide, and the fumble was recovered by the Aggies. This time, Texas got the stop and forced a punt at midfield. GO DEEPER Texas was all business in dominating its Texas A&M rivalry's return Texas controlled possession enough to outweigh Ewers’ two turnovers and the blocked punt, and the bulk of that duty fell on the shoulders of Tre Wisner, who logged the best day of his career in the biggest game of Texas’ season. Wisner’s longest run of the day went for just 22 yards, but he fueled the Longhorns’ running game with 186 yards on 33 carries. He consistently ran through contact, shook off arm tackles and made A&M tacklers pay for squaring up on him when they got a chance. His name will go down in rivalry lore for making sure Texas kept the bragging rights it has held for the last 13 years. Texas coach Steve Sarkisian is known for his schematic prowess, and he added a new wrinkle to the offense on Saturday. Sarkisian, who rarely uses quarterbacks in the running game, sent out the athletic Manning for the early fourth-and-2 that resulted in his 15-yard touchdown run. Mobile Manning™️@ArchManning pic.twitter.com/ahLQVQjne4 — Texas Football (@TexasFootball) December 1, 2024  All season, Sarkisian has refrained from using Manning for specialized plays or personnel packages, only inserting the redshirt freshman when Ewers was injured or the game was well in hand, except for a brief stint in the first half against Georgia when Texas’ offense had failed to get much going (Sarkisian went back to Ewers to finish that game). Advertisement But with Ewers nursing the ankle injury, it was a smart decision that paid off big. The Longhorns lost All-American and future first-round NFL Draft pick Kelvin Banks early in the game to an injury, and he didn’t return. That meant that redshirt freshman left tackle Trevor Goosby was thrust into action in a critical spot. Goosby didn’t miss a beat. There weren’t major pass protection issues on the left side with him in the game, and the run game continued to chug along, fueled by running back Tre Wisner. Sarkisian didn’t offer an immediate update on Banks’ status after the game, and his availability is worth watching as Texas looks ahead to a potential Playoff run. But it’s good to know that the Longhorns have a capable left tackle to turn to if Banks is out for an extended period. (Photo: Alex Slitz/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,New York Red Bulls advance to MLS Cup final with 1-0 win over Orlando City SC,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5959275/2024/11/30/new-york-red-bulls-orlando-city-mls-eastern-conference-final-score/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 03:22:52 GMT",The Red Bulls return to the MLS Cup for the first time since 2008.,"MLS The New York Red Bulls reached the MLS Cup, besting Orlando City in a cagey 1-0 Eastern Conference final. It marks the Red Bulls’ second trip to the final after finishing as the runner-up in 2008. New York was comfortable working off of Orlando’s cues as the away team, ceding 60.1 percent of possession to the hosts and keeping a strong defensive shape thanks to the backline and homegrown midfield pairing Daniel Edelman and Peter Stroud. Advertisement Right wing back Cameron Harper did his part to create a gilded opportunity early in the second half, going to ground as Orlando winger Iván Angulo shoved him in the back down the Red Bulls’ right wing. Left back John Tolkin sent in inch-perfect service on the ensuing free kick, placing his cross just between Pedro Gallese’s far post and the Red Bulls’ targets. Center back Andrés Reyes rose to prod the ball into the net, giving the narrow edge that New York was able to protect. ANDRES REYES WITH AUTHORITY 😤@NewYorkRedBulls take a decisive lead in the Eastern Conference Final! Audi // #MLSCupPlayoffs pic.twitter.com/oftdCBEvep — Major League Soccer (@MLS) December 1, 2024  Ultimately, Reyes was among the most involved players despite his role as a defensive anchor. The Colombian received the game’s first yellow card in the 24th minute after a poorly timed tackle on Facundo Torres. The defender wisely played a clean game for the ensuing forty minutes, including the set piece that sent New York to the MLS Cup. Reyes risked being sent off in the 66th minute as his attempt to clear a ball caused his boot to meet Duncan McGuire’s face. Ultimately, center official Rosendo Mendoza blew the whistle but didn’t show a second yellow, keeping a key Red Bull available for next Saturday’s final. On the whole, New York established a physical advantage with tactical fouls and outfouled Orlando 20-9, only two resulted in a yellow card. Red Bulls captain Emil Forsberg, the squad’s most credentialed player after a successful career in Europe and appearances for Sweden in the 2018 World Cup and two European Championships, said reaching the final validated his decision to move to MLS. “This is why I came,” Forsberg told Apple TV. “I said I wanted a challenge, I think it was the perfect challenge for me. I am so happy we did it. No one actually believed in us but we did it and also, it is not finished. We have one more game.” Advertisement The return to the final comes in what was anticipated to be a year of transition for New York. After years of adhering to the Red Bull Football ideology, with play characterized by counter-pressing and capitalizing on attacking third turnovers, New York appointed Sandro Schwarz as coach in mid-December 2023. Instead, Schwarz’s side looked to more proactively generate their chances and improve shot selection. After averaging 13.8 shots per game in 2023 on 31.3 percent accuracy and an average xG per shot of 0.097 (or a 9.7 percent historical likelihood of those chances resulting in a goal), this year’s team has improved in all three categories: 14.0 shots per game, 37.1 percent accuracy and an xG per shot of 0.116. As crucial as Schwarz’s fresh thinking has been, the arrival of Forsberg, arguably the most talented international signing by the club since Thierry Henry’s 2014 retirement, has also been significant. The Sweden international has been a needed talisman for the team’s attack but played a more supplemental role on Saturday against a focused Orlando defense. Forsberg was limited to just one shot and one chance created but set a season-high mark with 95.5 percent passing on 22 attempts and 100 percent accuracy in the final third. New York began its run to the final with a surprising first-round upset of defending champion Columbus Crew. At the time, it looked like a shock result that could be the reward for a transition year. Instead, it may be a needed exorcism of past demons as the franchise hopes to win its first MLS Cup. After all, Columbus beat New York in the 2008 MLS Cup.

Ohio State and Michigan, one of the sport’s most heated rivalries, started the day’s chaos when a fight broke out after the Wolverines upset the No. 2 Buckeyes. A group of Michigan players attempted to plant a UM flag at midfield at Ohio Stadium. The fight got so heated that multiple law enforcement agencies had to step in and break it up.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Miami upset at Syracuse sets ACC title game: Reeling Clemson against red-hot SMU,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5958916/2024/11/30/miami-syracuse-clemson-smu-acc-championship/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:52:36 GMT",Syracuse’s first win over a top-10 opponent since 2017 shook up the ACC Championship Game matchup.,"NCAAF It turns out the email the ACC sent out (and quickly deleted) on Black Friday prematurely selling tickets to a Clemson-SMU matchup in next week’s league championship game in Charlotte predicted exactly what was going to happen on the final day of regular-season action in the conference’s wild title game race. Advertisement With a 42-38 come-from-behind victory over No. 6 Miami, Syracuse knocked the Hurricanes out of the ACC Championship Game and ushered in No. 12 Clemson, which earlier on Saturday lost 17-14 to rival South Carolina to pick up its third defeat. It was Syracuse’s first win over a top-10 opponent since 2017. The Tigers, who have won eight league titles, will face ACC newcomer No. 9 SMU (11-1) at Bank of America Stadium. The Mustangs wrapped a perfect ACC campaign with a 38-6 win against Cal on Saturday afternoon and entered Saturday night with an 89 percent chance of making the Playoff according to projections from The Athletic’s Austin Mock. Miami (10-2) will likely spend the offseason lamenting what could have been had its defense been able to give quarterback Cam Ward a helping hand against fellow transfer passer Kyle McCord and the Orange (9-3). McCord threw for 380 yards and three touchdowns, and he handed the ball off to LeQuint Allen for what turned out to be the game-winning touchdown run with 9:16 remaining. Miami jumped out to a 21-0 lead behind two Ward touchdown passes and a 2-yard Mark Fletcher touchdown run. But Syracuse quickly erased it, tying the score at 21-21 on McCord’s second touchdown pass of the game 39 seconds into the second half. The teams traded touchdowns before Syracuse’s Devin Grant returned a fumble by receiver Xavier Restrepo 56 yards to the end zone, giving the Orange their first lead with 1:47 to play in the third quarter. Miami tied it at 35 on a two-yard Damien Martinez touchdown run with 13:02 remaining. In the final minutes, Miami drove into the red zone but was shoved back on an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on receiver Jacoby George. Facing a fourth-and-goal from the 10, the Hurricanes chose to kick a field goal to cut the deficit to 42-38 but never got the ball back. Advertisement Miami must now wait to see if the College Football Playoff committee will show them grace and keep them in the 12-team field. The loss dropped the Hurricanes to 10 percent odds to make the Playoff according to projections from The Athletic’s Austin Mock. — Manny Navarro Miami’s top-ranked scoring offense had a chance to tie the game late, but instead of keeping the ball in Ward’s hands and going for it on fourth down at the Orange 10, head coach Mario Cristobal decided to send kicker Andy Borregales out for a 27-yard field goal and put his defense back on the field. It’s a decision Cristobal will likely regret all offseason. He should. The Hurricanes could not stop McCord in the second half. Syracuse scored on three of its first four drives without much resistance. If not for a forced fumble by freshman linebacker Bobby Pruitt at the Miami 17 with 3:49 to play in the third quarter, the Orange would have likely scored at least a field goal on their third possession. Miami surrendered a season-high 479 yards. Syracuse finished 7 of 10 on third down conversions. Miami was also flagged nine times for 90 yards including five on defense for 50 yards. On the game’s final drive, an offside penalty on second-and-4 gave Syracuse a fresh set of downs inside the two-minute warning, all but sealing Miami’s fate. — Navarro At least one South Carolina fan was pulling for Clemson to make next week’s ACC Championship Game. “No disrespect to Miami, but I’m the biggest Syracuse fan in the world,” Gamecocks coach Shane Beamer said Saturday afternoon. “I hope Syracuse goes and wins that game and Clemson can go win an ACC (title) next week, as well.” Beamer, whose team was fresh off an emotional rivalry win against Clemson, got his wish. Advertisement And so did the Tigers. In what seemed like a nearly impossible scenario after Beamer’s South Carolina team rode star quarterback LaNorris Sellers to a 17-14 win in Death Valley, three-loss Clemson is still alive in the College Football Playoff hunt after all. Beat SMU next week, and Clemson will have a chance to earn an automatic big in the 12-team Playoff field as one of the five highest-ranked conference champions. Austin Mock’s latest projections place the Tigers with a 54 percent chance to win the ACC and make the CFP. Welcome to CFP expansion at its finest. “I’ll watch and see what happens, but whatever God’s got for us, he’s got for us and that’s just how I look at it,” a dejected Dabo Swinney had said earlier Saturday, when asked whether he’d watch the second half of the Hurricanes and Orange. “We’ll know our next step here pretty soon.” The Tigers had to beat South Carolina in order to have a seat at the table for an at-large bid and Swinney spoke at his postgame news conference like a coach ready to accept reality: His team had squandered its chance and would start to look ahead to next year. Swinney said his team would not gather to watch Syracuse-Miami together — “Everybody’s pissed.” “We had a good year. We could’ve had a great year,” Swinney said, speaking as if his season was already all but over. “But you’ve got to win that game to have a great year.” Maybe not. The Tigers now turn their attention to an SMU team that has just one loss on the season, to BYU in September. Quarterbacks Cade Klubnik and Kevin Jennings will take center stage with the Tigers’ season on the line — for real this time. “We’ll have another game and an opportunity to hopefully finish with a win, a 10th win and another postseason win and build on that,” Swinney said earlier Saturday afternoon, not knowing just how true those words would ring a few hours later. “A lot of football ahead.” — Grace Raynor (Photo: Bryan M.

On Saturday, Washington released cornerback Emmanuel Forbes, the 16th pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. Forbes is the third first-round selection released or traded by the new Commanders’ staff since August, meaning none of the six first-rounders from 2019 to 2023 remain with the team. Advertisement The NFC wild-card contenders also placed running back Austin Ekeler on injured reserve. The eight-year veteran suffered his second concussion this season in Sunday’s loss to the Dallas Cowboys. Ekeler must miss at least four games. During Washington’s busy transactional week, the team ruled out Ekeler and starting right tackle Andrew Wylie (concussion) and listed cornerback Marshon Lattimore (hamstring) as “doubtful” against the Tennessee Titans. The Commanders (7-5) look to snap a season-high three-game losing streak and maintain their hold on the third and final wild-card spot with a win over the Titans (3-8). With general manager Adam Peters and coach Dan Quinn in charge, the Commanders traded struggling 2022 first-round wide receiver Jahan Dotson to the Philadelphia Eagles for a package including a 2025 third-round pick. Washington released 2021 first-round defensive Jamin Davis in October after a transition from linebacker did not take. Minnesota signed Davis off Green Bay’s practice squad this week. Rivera’s staff traded first-round edge rusher Montez Sweat (2019) and Chase Young (2020) last season and released quarterback Dwayne Haskins (2019) during the 2020 season. Forbes’ career cratered almost immediately. Washington sought more playmaking in the secondary following the 2022 season. That led to the selection of the Mississippi State standout, who set the FBS record with six of his 14 career interceptions returned for touchdowns. The Commanders chose the 166-pound Forbes over cornerback Christian Gonzalez, a higher-profile draft prospect who slid outside the top 10. After a promising training camp, Forbes was torched by opposing wide receivers, headlined by Philadelphia’s A.J. Brown in Week 4 and the Chicago Bears’ passing attack the following week. Washington kept Forbes on the bench the following game and played him sporadically over the remaining games. Advertisement Quinn and defensive coordinator Joe Whitt Jr. gave Forbes opportunities this summer and at the start of the season, but he quickly lost his rotation spot. Forbes started Week 1, missed two games with a thumb injury and then played more than six snaps only twice in the next nine games. Over two seasons, Forbes played in 20 of 29 games — seven starts — with two interceptions and 45 tackles. Unless claimed on waivers, his release accelerates remaining cash totals and prorated signing bonuses, leaving dead cap charges in 2024 ($8.503 million) and 2025 ($4.103) and nothing on the books in 2026.

Second-round rookie Mike Sainristil, 2024 free agent Noah Igbinoghene, four-year starter Benjamin St-Juste and veteran Mike Davis form the rotation until Lattimore is cleared. Despite an upgrade to “limited” practice participation this week, Lattimore likely misses his fifth consecutive game — fourth with Washington since acquired at the trade deadline before Week 10 — with a lingering hamstring injury. Forbes’ release has no barring on Lattimore’s availability. Ekeler is the bigger hit for this season. Following an injury-plagued campaign with the Los Angeles Chargers, he signed a free-agent contract this offseason and answered lingering concerns over his remaining capabilities. The shifty dual-threat back ranks third for Washington in rushing yards (355), yards per attempt (4.8) and receptions (33). However, Ekeler missed one game after a concussion in a Monday night win against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 3 and has now suffered his unofficial fourth concussion in his NFL career. With Washington on bye following Sunday’s game against the Titans, Ekeler is not eligible to return until the Commanders’ Week 18 game at Dallas but could be available for the postseason. Lead back Brian Robinson is cleared to play after a first-quarter ankle injury limited him to five carries against Dallas. Jeremy McNichols, the new pass-catching lead, and Chris Rodriguez are the backups against the league’s defensive leader on third-down percentage. Advertisement Of Washington’s 51 players drafted from 2018 to 2023, only 13 are active on the 53-player roster. That includes the only two remaining members of the 2023 seven-player class — second-round safety Quan Martin and Rodriguez, who the Commanders have released and re-signed multiple times this season. The Commanders elevated kicker Zane Gonzalez on Saturday after placing Austin Seibert (groin, hip) on injured reserve earlier this week. Gonzalez made all three field goal attempts in two games with Seibert sidelined. Seibert returned last week but missed three kicks, including a potential game-tying extra point with 21 seconds remaining.

South Carolina had just defeated then-No. 10 Texas A&M and Sellers had accounted for 350 yards of offense. Advertisement ‘You’ve got bleeping Superman playing quarterback back there,’” Beamer recalled his colleague writing. But on Saturday afternoon, as fans yelled with excitement and the band played in the Gamecocks’ tunnel, Beamer took it a step further. “LaNorris Sellers is the best player in the country,” Beamer said. “And all you media people that vote on the Heisman, if you’re not voting for that guy (to be) in the mix for the Heisman Trophy, you’re out of your minds. Name a player in the country that’s done more than that kid has this year.” Sellers may not be quite ready for a Heisman run this season, but there’s no denying the 19-year-old redshirt freshman has become must-see TV — especially as the expanded 12-team College Football Playoff has given more teams in the hunt increased national exposure in the regular season. Such was the case again Saturday, when No. 15 South Carolina (9-3, 5-2 SEC) beat No. 12 Clemson (9-3, 5-2 ACC) 17-14 in a road matchup that all but spoiled the rival Tigers’ Playoff hopes. GO DEEPER College Football Playoff 2024 projections: What now for Ohio State after Michigan upset? Sellers — a 6-foot-3, 242-pound escape artist from Florence, S.C. — dazzled, breaking through contact all afternoon. Even when it looked like the Tigers’ defense had him wrapped up, he still found a way to slip through and turn on the jets. And with the game on the line and South Carolina facing a third-and-16 with 1:18 to play, he ripped off a 20-yard touchdown run that ultimately won the game. In a game that will forever cement his legacy with the Gamecocks, Sellers finished the afternoon with 16 carries for 166 yards and two touchdowns, in addition to passing for 164 yards. Of South Carolina’s 431 yards of total offense, Sellers accounted for 330. He led the Gamecocks to only their second win in the Palmetto Bowl in the last decade. “LaMagic, LaComeback, whatever you want to call him — he’s a magician for sure,” junior defensive back Nick Emmanwori said. “LaHeisman, I think he’s a Heisman candidate. … I’m glad he’s on my team.” Advertisement Sellers said his final run, with South Carolina trailing 14-10, was actually supposed to be a pass play. Clemson even had a spy on him to help mitigate the threat of him taking off with his legs. But as Sellers went through his first read, then his second, looking for a wide receiver, all he saw was green grass. “I just stepped up,” he said. “Why not take it when I’ve been doing it all game?” And into the end zone he went as some 81,000 Clemson fans sat in stunned silence. “I saw a great player in Sellers today. That was pretty special. There’s a couple you just tip your hat and you’ve gotta give him credit for that,” Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said. “Just watch every game. It’s like a rerun. It doesn’t matter who they’re playing.” Indeed, Sellers has torched defenses all season long — rushing for 106 yards in the upset win against Texas A&M earlier this month and passing for 353 yards two weeks ago against Missouri. The best part? He still has three more years of eligibility after 2024 as South Carolina looks to build itself into a Playoff contender. Beamer now has more wins through his first four seasons than any other South Carolina coach did in the same time frame, including Steve Spurrier. Behind Sellers, the Gamecocks are on the way, and that’s great for college football as expansion creates more contenders. “He’s a competitor. He’s a warrior. Nothing bothers him. He’s so poised and doesn’t get too high or too low. He was just having fun out there playing,” said Beamer, who also made a case for his team being included in the Playoff despite three losses. “I get it. The committee has a really tough job. They have to choose the 12 best teams. I get it, we have three losses, I understand that. But it’s hard for me to sit there and say we’re not one of the twelve best teams in the country when you look at our strength of schedule, when you look at our wins on the road. “I don’t know if there’s a hotter team in America.” Or a hotter quarterback than Sellers for that matter.

The condition on the 2025 first-round pick: If #mnwild end up with a top-5 pick, it pushes the first-round pick to 2026.  That's unlikely, of course. Wild currently have the 2nd-best record in the NHL. https://t.co/7I1U9gUmZA — Aaron Portzline (@Aportzline) November 30, 2024  Hunt, 22, the Wild’s most NHL-ready defense prospect, was supposed to play Saturday afternoon against the Checkers but was pulled from the lineup just before the game. Jiricek, who turned 21 on Thursday and was assigned to AHL Iowa by the Wild Saturday, was selected with the No. 6 pick in the 2022 NHL Draft, but his awkward skating and erratic play kept him from grabbing a lineup spot under three different Blue Jackets coaches, including current bench boss Dean Evason. Advertisement The Blue Jackets had demoted Jiricek last week to the AHL’s Cleveland Monsters after he’d appeared in only six of Columbus’ games this season. In those six games, Jiricek averaged only 11 minutes, 14 seconds of ice time. GM Don Waddell, who joined the Blue Jackets in late May, and Evason, who came aboard a month later, provided Jiricek a fresh start in his third pro season. While it hasn’t been contentious, as it was last season, Jiricek and the organization remain at loggerheads over his NHL readiness. GO DEEPER NHL trade grades: David Jiricek deal is a poor return on investment for Blue Jackets Jiricek and his camp have felt since last season that he was ready for a prominent role in the NHL — top-four ice time, a spot on the power play, etc. The Blue Jackets have given him chances to grab a lineup spot, but his defensive reads and clumsy skating have relegated him to the third pair — and often to the press box as a healthy scratch. Unable to see eye to eye, the two opted to part ways, but Waddell wasn’t going to simply accept the best offer for Jiricek and move forward. The Blue Jackets have been in that spot before with Pierre-Luc Dubois, Patrik Laine and others, but that wasn’t the case here. Waddell wasn’t trading Jiricek until he heard the right trade offer, some combination of prospect(s) and pick(s) that he felt was commensurate with Jiricek’s value. After several days of listening to offers and making counteroffers, the Wild finally met the bar on Hunt and a bunch of picks. TRADE ALERT‼️ We've acquired D Daemon Hunt and 4 draft picks, including a conditional 2025 first-round pick, from the @mnwild in exchange for D David Jiricek and a 2025 fifth-round pick. 📝 https://t.co/zx5iQQChlM@RuoffMortgage | #CBJ pic.twitter.com/tBF3Y1oP2D — Colu❌bus Blue Jackets (@BlueJacketsNHL) November 30, 2024  Brock Faber’s eight-year extension kicks in next season. While the Wild still have right-shot defenseman David Spacek — the son of former Blue Jackets defenseman Jaroslav Spacek — in the pipeline, the opportunity to add a prospect as highly decorated as Jiricek was too good of a chance to pass up. The Wild envision Faber, 22, and Jiricek on the right side in the top four for a decade-plus. In essence, they are planning for life after Jared Spurgeon, the Wild captain and 15-year vet who was limited to 16 games last season due to shoulder, hip and back injuries and has two years left on his contract after this season. Advertisement All teams covet right shots, and Jiricek is a two-way defenseman with a heavy shot who plays hard and will bring much-needed size to a blue line that doesn’t have a ton of it. While mobility has long been his weakness, the Wild believe their skating expert, Andy Ness, could do wonders for him. Jiricek is a decorated junior player with lots of international experience and success. He was named the best defenseman of the 2023 World Junior Championship, helping lead Czechia to a silver medal. In a league that’s awfully unkind to teenage defensemen, Jiricek had 38 points in 55 games in his first year pro with AHL Cleveland in 2022-23 and helped lead the Monsters to the Eastern Conference final last season with 11 points in 14 games. Jiricek’s camp accepts that he will begin his Wild career in Iowa. While it shouldn’t be long before the Wild make room for him on the big club, he has barely played this year (six NHL games and a four-game stint in Cleveland where he has scored two goals and an assist) and the Wild want him to get his game in order in the minors. Of course, with Jonas Brodin hurt, the Wild will need to tap into an extra defenseman and Hunt was their top recall candidate. — Michael Russo, Wild beat reporter Wild coach John Hynes has said since the start of training camp that Hunt was ready for the NHL. They just couldn’t get him in the lineup because of seven defensemen on NHL contracts ahead of him. He played one game earlier this season. He’s a smart, mobile, left-shot defenseman with size. Hunt played 12 games last season for the Wild with one assist. On Nov. 13, Hunt told The Athletic, “I want to be in the NHL, simple as that. But everyone’s path is different, and right now mine is to be in the American League. Time will tell, but I’m hoping someday I’ll be here full-time. But right now everybody’s playing well and the team’s winning, which is great to see.” — Michael Russo, Wild beat reporter   (Photo: Patrick Smith / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Max Verstappen has already clinched his fourth drivers’ crown but McLaren, Ferrari and Red Bull are still battling for the constructors’ title.  Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here Getty Images Max Verstappen may have qualified first, but he received a one-place grid drop for ""alleged driving unnecessarily slowly” and received a penalty point (his sixth in a 12-month span). Here is the reasoning behind the decision and why it is one place rather than three.  Verstappen will now start P2, and Russell will start from pole. Here is the stewards' decision: ""Car 1 was on a different preparation strategy to that of Car 63. Car 1 was well outside of the delta and the driver of Car 1 explained he had let Cars 4 and 14 past. The driver of Car 63 claimed that he had adhered to the delta and did not expect Car 1 to be on the racing line. He stated that if a car was going slow in a high speed corner, it should not be on the racing line. ""The Stewards regard this case as a complicated one in that clearly Car 1 did not comply with the Race Director’s Event Notes and clearly was driving, in our determination, unnecessarily slowly considering the circumstances. ""It was obvious the driver of Car 1 was attempting to cool his tyres. He also could see Car 63 approaching as he looked in his mirror multiple times whilst on the small straight between Turns 11 and 12. ""Unusually, this incident occurred when neither car was on a push lap. Had Car 63 been on a push lap, the penalty would have most likely been the usual 3 grid position penalty, however in mitigation of penalty, it was obvious that the driver of Car 63 had clear visibility of Car 1 and that neither car was on a push lap.” Advertisement The gap between Max Verstappen and George Russell for pole was razor-thin.

The Alpine Academy driver needed to score just 16 points in Race 1 after building quite the lead over the season. Her closest rival was Doriane Pin, the two going neck-and-neck. But Pulling dominated, taking seven wins so far this season compared to Pin's three. GO FURTHER Undaunted, Abbi Pulling forges her own path to Formula 1: ‘It was all my choice’ The stewards have fined Ferrari €5,000 for unsafely releasing Carlos Sainz during Q3 on Saturday in Qatar.

We'll see what comes of this summons.  Advertisement Getty Images That was a good reminder from Max Verstappen just why he is a four-time world champion. A huge turnaround from this morning when he couldn't even keep up with a Haas in the sprint. The driver definitely made the difference at the very end to squeeze ahead of Russell. Ferrari might wonder where things went wrong at the end of the session as Leclerc and Sainz ended up P5 and P7. GO FURTHER Max Verstappen’s toughest F1 title yet? How Red Bull’s star became a 4-time world champion  His first pole since Austria back in June. Norris (3rd) and Piastri (4th) put together final laps good enough to start ahead of their championship rivals, Leclerc (5th) and Sainz (7th).

Even if Verstappen takes pole, it's important that Ferrari doesn't get out-qualified by both McLarens.  About ten minutes to figure out who starts where for tomorrow's grand prix.  Getty Images After how much he struggled in the sprint, I don't think anybody thought Max Verstappen would be in the hunt for pole position. It's been quite the turnaround from him so far. If he can convert the pace so far into pole, it'd be a fine performance and brilliant response. For the sake of the constructors' championship, I'm sure Ferrari is also hoping that Verstappen is up there to help take points off McLaren.

The Dutchman received a one-place grid drop for driving “unnecessarily slowly on a cool-down lap,” according to the stewards’ decision that came a few hours after qualifying ended. In Q3 of qualifying, Verstappen was trying to cool his tires when the incident occurred. Russell had not expected Verstappen to be driving so slowly on the racing line and had to pull up and swerve to avoid a collision. Advertisement “The Stewards regard this case as a complicated one in that clearly Car 1 (Verstappen) did not comply with the Race Director’s Event Notes and clearly was driving, in our determination, unnecessarily slowly considering the circumstances,” the stewards’ decision read. Verstappen will start P2, while Russell starts from pole position. This would have been Verstappen’s first pole position since the Austrian GP in June. This also happened earlier this year when he qualified first in Belgium but had an engine penalty, which dropped him 10 grid positions. George Russell, who initially qualified second, will now line up P1.Qualifying looked rather different than sprint qualifying a day prior. Some drivers who performed solidly and advanced to SQ3 on Friday, like Pierre Gasly, Liam Lawson and Nico Hulkenberg, didn’t have a similar performance on Saturday, as none made Q3. Meanwhile, others like Sergio Pérez struggled during sprint qualifying and the sprint race but advanced to Q3. The competitive picture shifted because the cars were out of parc fermé between the sprint race and qualifying on Saturday. Teams are allowed to make adjustments during this window to the cars’ setups. However, there was some consistency — both McLarens, Ferraris, and Mercedes cars (as well as Verstappen) advanced to Q3. The Dutchman had a surprising qualifying on the hunt for pole throughout. It contrasted his sprint performance, where he finished eighth, and he even commended the team for the turnaround over the radio: “Let’s f—ing go, guys! Well done, what a turnaround. Yes!” As for the papaya, McLaren’s sprint performance didn’t carry over, though they’ll line up ahead of the Ferraris. Verstappen had qualified first at the Belgian Grand Prix in July but took a grid drop penalty for exceeding his engine allowance and didn’t start from pole. All eyes likely will be on Ferrari and McLaren. After Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris finished 1-2 in the sprint race earlier on Saturday, the championship gap between McLaren and Ferrari widened slightly, as the Woking-based crew secured a combined 15 points and the Prancing Horse took nine combined points. It’s a 30-point gap with 88 points remaining this season, and McLaren needs to outscore Ferrari by 15 points during Sunday’s grand prix to secure its first constructors’ championship since 1998.

Malzahn, 59, went 28-24 with the Knights, but after two nine-win seasons in the AAC, UCF fell to 10-15 in its first two years in the Big 12. Advertisement UCF finished 4-8 in 2024, ending the season with a 28-14 loss at home to Utah on Friday. Malzahn and Florida State coach Mike Norvell have known each other for almost 20 years. Malzahn was the offensive coordinator at Tulsa when he heard about Norvell through a friend. Malzahn hired Norvell — then a graduate assistant at Central Arkansas — as a GA with the Golden Hurricane before the 2007 season. Norvell rose the ranks after Malzahn left to become an assistant at Auburn. Malzahn will be taking over a Florida State offense that heads into its season-finale against Florida ranked 131st nationally in both yards per game and points per game. Malzahn is 105-62 in 13 seasons as an FBS head coach with one season at Arkansas State and eight at Auburn. The Arkansas native went 68-35 at Auburn, with a BCS championship game appearance in 2013, his first season as head coach. He never had a losing record there and went 3-5 against Nick Saban and Alabama in the Iron Bowl, but he was fired after the 2020 season, with the school paying a then-record $21.5 million buyout to get rid of him. Malzahn was also a successful offensive coordinator in the SEC, first at Arkansas and then at Auburn, helping Cam Newton and the Tigers win a national title in 2010. UCF athletic director Terry Mohajir swooped in soon after Auburn let Malzahn go and brought him to Orlando, a splashy move to replace Josh Heupel after he left for Tennessee. Malzahn seemed invigorated by the new challenge. He bought into the branding — and underlying idea — that UCF was the future of college football as a growing program in the center of one of the nation’s biggest football states. Malzahn’s 2024 recruiting class was the best in program history, finishing 39th in the 247Sports Composite. His staff fended off one of the in-state powers, Florida, to sign defensive lineman John Walker, the nation’s No. 95 overall prospect and the top recruit in program history. Advertisement But even during two seasons in the AAC, UCF failed to meet the elevated expectations of a program that went to back-to-back New Year’s Six Bowls in 2017 and 2018 under Scott Frost and Heupel. The Knights went 18-9 his first two seasons, losing the American title game in 2021 before beating Florida in the Gasparilla Bowl. All three former AAC schools, including Houston and Cincinnati, have struggled since entering the Big 12. UCF had the best first season by reaching a bowl game. But the Knights had one of the season’s biggest collapses when they blew a 28-point second-half lead to Baylor in their first conference home game in the Big 12. Year 2 was expected to bring success — or at least solid results — with Arkansas transfer KJ Jefferson a promising match for Malzahn’s offense. Instead, it brought a carousel at quarterback, a midseason firing of defensive coordinator Ted Roof, Malzahn handing off play-calling duties to offensive coordinator Tim Harris and several close losses that could have flipped the season. UCF issued the following statement Saturday: “We would like to thank coach Malzahn for his contributions to our football program over the past four seasons, including our transition into the Big 12 Conference. We appreciate his professionalism and dedication to our student-athletes throughout his tenure at UCF and wish he and his wife, Kristi, the very best in their future endeavors.” Malzahn had three years left on a contract that would have paid him about $5.5 million annually.

Dobbins leads the Chargers in rushing yards (766) and touchdowns (eight). He had emerged very clearly as the Chargers’ best back. Now coach Jim Harbaugh will have to move further down the depth chart at running back. Gus Edwards is next in line. But this could be a big opportunity for rookie Kimani Vidal, who has only been active for four games this season. Vidal got his debut regular season NFL action in Week 6 when he caught a touchdown pass on his first career touch. Edwards is a physical back. Vidal could provide an ideal change of pace with Dobbins out. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

Gilman missed the tackle, and Hill scored a 51-yard touchdown that put the game away. Gilman’s absence will have a substantial impact on the defense. With Gilman and Elijah Molden at safety, the Chargers and defensive coordinator Jesse Minter could move Derwin James Jr. around frequently, most notably to the nickel position. Now James will be forced to play more at safety. The Chargers lost their fourth safety, AJ Finley, earlier this week when they waived him and he was claimed by the Seattle Seahawks. They claimed Marcus Maye off waivers from the Miami Dolphins on Wednesday. The Chargers also signed veteran safety Tony Jefferson to the active roster as part of Saturday’s moves.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"West Virginia battered by Texas Tech, 52-15, to finish regular season 6-6: Is it time to part with coach Neal Brown?",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5958605/2024/11/30/west-virginia-regular-season-loss-neal-brown-texas-tech/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 21:26:39 GMT","Since his arrival in Morgantown in 2019, Brown has helped the team to a 37-35 overall record but is 25-28 in the Big 12 over that span.","NCAAF Texas Tech walloped West Virginia 52-15 in the regular-season finale Saturday at Jones AT&T Stadium, drawing a crescendo of criticism for Mountaineers coach Neal Brown. Since his arrival in Morgantown in 2019, Brown has helped the team to a 37-35 overall record but is 25-28 in the Big 12 over that span. West Virginia (6-6 overall) reached bowl eligibility — its fourth time doing so in Brown’s six seasons — with its sixth victory against UCF on Nov. 23, but none of the teams the Mountaineers triumphed over won more than five games heading into the final weekend of the regular season. Advertisement On Saturday, Texas Tech (8-4) outscored West Virginia in every quarter, peaking with a 29-0 second frame. That makes 10 of 12 games this season in which the Mountaineers were outscored in the final half, per the AP. The Mountaineers finished 5-4 in the Big 12. Brown is no stranger to the hot seat. He coached his way off of it in 2023, leading West Virginia to a 9-4 rebound and a Duke’s Mayo Bowl victory after being picked last in the Big 12 preseason media poll. In March he signed a one-year contract extension through 2027 and took a voluntary pay cut, forgoing $400,000 in salary increases over the next three years of the contract and electing to reinvest that money in his staff. Brown earned $4 million in salary in 2024. More than $700,000 was added to the staff salary pool between the pay cut and an additional increase from the university. Athletic director Wren Baker did not hire Brown, but Baker opted for patience when he took the job in November 2022, choosing to retain Brown despite back-to-back losing seasons. That patience was rewarded in 2023, so it will be curious to see Baker’s approach this time. Brown’s amended buyout stipulates that he’s owed 75 percent of his remaining salary if fired, which would be north of $9.5 million if let go after this season. Along with additional staff buyouts, that’s a steep price for West Virginia to pay with the impending House settlement and $20-plus-million in annual revenue sharing on the horizon. WVU athletics had a total operating revenue of $106 million in fiscal year 2023, which ranked in the bottom half of the Big 12. But in a newly wide-open conference and expanded College Football Playoff, there could be enough pressure to make a change after failing to finish better than .500 in the regular season for the third time in four years. — Justin Williams, staff writer, college football (Photo: Chris Coduto / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Michigan, Ohio State players and police involved in postgame fight after Buckeyes' upset loss",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5958692/2024/11/30/michigan-vs-ohio-state-fight/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 21:06:19 GMT","Police and team staff stepped in to break up the fight, which intensified after Michigan planted its flag on Ohio State's field.","NCAAF A dramatic ending to one of college football’s most heated rivalries only intensified after the final whistle Saturday, when Michigan and Ohio State players broke into a fight after the Wolverines upset the No. 2 Buckeyes 13-10 at Ohio Stadium. GO DEEPER How Michigan stunned No. 2 Ohio State for fourth rivalry win in a row: Key takeaways As the two teams congregated at midfield after the game, a group of Wolverines attempted to plant a Michigan flag at midfield. Ohio State players tried to break up the celebration and the heated exchange evolved into a brawl. At one point, Ohio State defensive end Jack Sawyer ripped the flag away from a Michigan player and threw it to the turf. A fight has broken out between Michigan and Ohio State after The Game pic.twitter.com/XPwdAjfYzN — FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) November 30, 2024  Police and team staff stepped in to break up the fight. In the process, some players were seen on the ground rubbing their faces after coming into contact with pepper spray. “Following the game, officers from multiple law enforcement agencies assisted in breaking up an on-field altercation,” Ohio State University police said in a statement. “During the scuffle, multiple officers representing Ohio and Michigan deployed pepper spray. OSUPD is the lead agency for games & will continue to investigate.” Players and coaches from Michigan and Ohio State had differing viewpoints on the fracas. “For such a great game, you hate to see stuff like that after the game. That’s just bad for the sport, bad for college football, but at the end of the day, they’ve got to learn how to lose, man,” Michigan running back Kalel Mullings said in a postgame interview with Fox. Advertisement “You can’t be fighting and stuff just because you lost a game. All that fighting, we had 60 minutes, we had four quarters to do all that fighting. And now people want to talk and fight. That’s wrong. That’s just bad for the game. Classless, in my opinion. And people got to be better.” Buckeyes coach Ryan Day said his players were defending home turf. “I don’t know all the details of it, but I know that these guys are looking to put a flag on our field and our guys weren’t going to let that happen,” Day said. The loss — Ohio State’s fourth in a row to Michigan — cost the Buckeyes (10-2 overall, 7-2 Big Ten) a spot in the conference title game. No. 1 Oregon already clinched its place in the championship, and No. 4 Penn State earned the second spot with a win over Maryland on Saturday. The Buckeyes still have more than a 99 percent chance of making the College Football Playoff and now have a 92 percent chance of hosting a first-round game, according to The Athletic’s Austin Mock. Michigan (7-5, 5-4) and Ohio State were tied at 10 for the entirety of the second half until the final minute of the fourth quarter, when Michigan kicker Dominic Zvada hit a 21-yard field goal to give the Wolverines the three-point pad. Ohio State failed to gain more than a yard on its next drive, turning the ball over on downs and giving Michigan its 62nd series victory. “We’re going to win in your house and we’re gonna plant the flag,” Michigan quarterback Davis Warren said. “You should’ve done something about it.” The planting of the flag is no novice tradition in college football, especially between these two teams. In 2022, after Michigan captured its first victory at Ohio Stadium since 2000 — a 45-23 win over the then-top-ranked Buckeyes — the team also mounted its “M” over the “O” logo at Ohio State’s midfield. That flag was later placed on display in the Towsley Museum lobby inside Michigan’s Schembechler Hall. Infamously, former Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield planted the OU flag over the “O” emblem in 2017, when the Sooners upset the Buckeyes 31-16. Mayfield even ran a victory lap with the flag before stabbing it into the ground, though the Ohio State team had already departed for the locker room. Mayfield said at the time that his and his teammates’ reaction to the 2017 upset was in part because it was “embarassing” to hear the Ohio State players sing their fight song on the Sooners’ field after a 45-24 drubbing the year before. Advertisement With roughly two minutes remaining in the game, several dozen law enforcement officers on bicycles assembled in the end zone as part of the postgame procedure. Michigan players and coach Sherrone Moore were going back and forth with Ohio State fans behind the Michigan bench in the closing seconds, and there was a big celebration on the field with water being sprayed once the clock hit zero. While Moore did his postgame interview on Fox, one group of Michigan players ran to the end zone to celebrate with fans and another gathered at midfield to plant the flag, just as they did after their victory against the Buckeyes in 2022. Shoving broke out as players were in the process of planting the flag, and a chaotic scene ensued with some staff members rushing in to break up the fight and others running away. The fight appeared to be under control, but then it flared up again. At that point law enforcement officers were involved in separating the teams, and at least one Ohio State fan was being handcuffed on the field. I noticed a strong chemical taste when I got closer to the center of the altercation, and a reporter walked away from the scene rubbing her eyes and saying she couldn’t see. Michigan players said several of their teammates were sprayed with mace as well. At that point, Moore and other Michigan staff members were trying to hold back players and direct them toward one of the end zones. The law enforcement officers formed a line with their bikes at midfield to separate the teams and players gradually cleared the field. Buckeyes coach Ryan Day stood on the sidelines; the broadcast later showed him asking his players what happened.  — Austin Meek, Michigan beat writer This story will be updated.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Raiders to send video of final play of loss vs. Chiefs to NFL for review,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5958469/2024/11/30/las-vegas-raiders-kansas-city-chiefs-video-review/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 19:35:05 GMT",The Raiders said they heard an official's whistle on the last play of Friday's game that resulted in a fumble and a 19-17 loss.,"NFL Las Vegas Raiders coach Antonio Pierce said Saturday that his team “heard a whistle” on its sideline during the calamitous final play of Friday’s 19-17 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs and will send the NFL video of the play for a review. Such reviews are often a standard process for teams when they disagree with how a play is officiated in hopes the league at least acknowledges a mistake. Advertisement On the final play, center Jackson Powers-Johnson snapped the ball before quarterback Aidan O’Connell was ready. The ball bounced off O’Connell’s chest and was recovered by the Chiefs to secure Kansas City’s victory. Before the fumbled had been recovered, one referee appeared to run in from the Raiders’ sideline and make the signal for a false-start penalty against Las Vegas — but the infraction was changed to an illegal shift. The Raiders players and coaches protested the change because a false start is a dead-ball penalty and they heard one official whistle the play dead, and therefore the fumble wouldn’t have counted. The Raiders fumble it, the Chiefs recover it to seal the game ‼️#LVvsKC on Prime VideoAlso streaming on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/WvNvUONRM5 — NFL (@NFL) November 29, 2024  The Athletic reached out to the NFL after the game to get clarity on the official’s ruling on the play. NFL senior vice president of football and international communications Michael Signora responded via email, saying: “Had the clock been running at the snap, then by rule an illegal shift would convert to a false start. Since the clock was stopped (due to the spike on the second-down play), an illegal shift is a live-ball foul.” The Raiders were at the 32-yard line with 15 seconds left in the game, within range for a potential game-winning field goal — although kicker Daniel Carlson had already missed three field goals on the day. The botched snap makes the Raiders the first team since at least 2000 to turn it over in the final 30 seconds when in field-goal range (35-yard line or closer) and trailing by one or two points, per the Associated Press’ Josh Dubow. The loss is the eighth straight for the 2-10 Raiders. Leading up to the blunder, Las Vegas spiked the ball with 16 seconds left after a 7-yard pass to Ameer Abdullah. Pierce and O’Connell both said the Raiders wanted to run another play — and throw the ball out of bounds — to kill more clock, something they could have done had they simply waited to spike the ball. Instead, O’Connell lined up in shotgun formation and clapped his hands, but it was a signal for his teammates to hurry up and not for Powers-Johnson to snap the ball. Advertisement Asked Saturday morning if he would do anything differently on the sequence at the end of the game, Pierce said, “No.” He added that he sent a text to his players, coaches and other team personnel thanking them for their effort in a tough loss on a short week against one of the best teams in the league.

Thibault and Whalen will fill the spot left vacant by Katie Smith, who joined Ohio State’s staff, and add a fourth assistant coaching spot on the Lynx bench. The WNBA runners-up have yet to announce a general manager hire, a spot vacated by Clare Duwelius, who left in November to become the GM and executive vice president of the new basketball league, Unrivaled. Advertisement “I am excited to add both Eric and Lindsay to our coaching staff,” Reeve said in a statement Saturday. “Eric has vast experience coaching in the WNBA as both a head and an assistant coach and is a WNBA Champion. Lindsay adds a unique perspective as a Lynx legend and Naismith Hall of Famer. I look forward to working with both in our quest for another WNBA Championship.” WELCOME BACK, WHAY. 💙 pic.twitter.com/Zytd6UyznU — Minnesota Lynx (@minnesotalynx) November 30, 2024  Thibault, a longtime Mystics assistant under his father Mike Thibault, spent the last two seasons as the Mystics’ head coach. The franchise went 33-47 in those two seasons, making the playoffs in 2023 but failing to make the top eight in 2024, which was considered a rebuilding season. Thibault was an assistant on the Washington staff during the franchise’s most successful seasons in 2018 and 2019, when the Mystics advanced to the WNBA Finals, losing in 2018 and winning in 2019. His hiring is the latest development in the WNBA’s offseason coaching carousel, which saw numerous teams including the Mystics part with their coaches in recent weeks. “I’m thrilled to be joining Cheryl’s staff and to be part of the Minnesota Lynx organization,” Thibault said in a statement Saturday. “The players and staff have built an incredible winning culture, and I’m excited to do my part as we pursue a WNBA Championship.” welcome to Minnesota, Eric! pic.twitter.com/gFm8EmxBUj — Minnesota Lynx (@minnesotalynx) November 30, 2024  It’s a homecoming for Whalen, who grew up in Minnesota and spent nine seasons playing for the Lynx, including winning four WNBA championships between 2011 and 2017. Whalen holds the Lynx’s franchise record in assists (1,384) and ranks fifth in scoring (3,233). The team retired her jersey in 2019. Whalen played for just two clubs in her career: the Connecticut Sun (coached by Mike Thibault) and the Lynx (where she was coached by Reeve), in addition to an international playing career and a gold for the U.S. at the 2012 Olympics. Advertisement After retiring, Whalen spent five seasons as the head coach of the Minnesota Gophers from 2018 to 2023. It was her first time on the sideline as a coach. The hometown star who put Minnesota on the map with a Final Four run during her senior season in 2004 was never able to recapture that kind of success as a coach, only making the WNIT postseason tournament twice. “I’m so excited to be back with the Lynx and back with Coach and Becky (Rebekkah Brunson),” Whalen said in a statement Saturday. “Eric and I have also known each other for a long time, and for me, I couldn’t imagine joining a better staff as I return to coaching and get my first opportunity to coach in the WNBA. We have a special group with this team and I can’t wait to get to work.” The two hires bring much familiarity back to Minnesota for Reeve as she has long histories with both the Thibault family and Whalen. Reeve and Mike Thibault, a Saint Paul, Minn., native, have known one another for years. He took over the Connecticut Sun in 2003 and drafted Whalen out of Minnesota in 2004. In 2010, when Reeve became the Lynx head coach after spending nine seasons as an assistant at various franchises, Minnesota — which was trying to bring Whalen back to the Lynx for several seasons — was finally successful in navigating a trade with Thibault and the Sun. Reeve also selected Mike Thibault as an assistant for her Team USA Olympic staff this summer ahead of the Paris Games. In 2024, the Lynx had its most successful season since the Whalen years, winning the Commissioner’s Cup and advancing to the WNBA Finals, where Minnesota lost in five games to the New York Liberty. The Lynx return its core from that playoff run in 2025, including WNBA defensive player of the year Napheesa Collier, as well as standouts Alanna Smith, Kayla McBride, Courtney Williams and Bridget Carleton.

And Nuno believes the man, who turns 33 on December 7, has a few more years left in him yet. “I believe so. I believe so,” said Nuno, when asked if he expected Wood to still be going strong in a few years. “Chris is one of those players who really takes care of himself.

In acquiring Justus Annunen, 24, plus a sixth-round pick next June from the Avalanche in exchange for veteran Scott Wedgewood, the Predators, 7-12-5, have an eye past this season. Internally, there’s hope the Predators’ goaltending department led by Mitch Korn can unlock some of that potential from Annunen. The fact that Annunen is eight years younger than Wedgewood made this trade appealing given the disappointing season Nashville is having.

Luck will start in his new role immediately, the school said. In the expanded GM position, Luck, 35, will oversee every aspect of the program, both on and off the field. He will work with coach Troy Taylor on recruiting and roster management and with administration on fundraising, alumni relations, sponsorships, student-athlete support and stadium experience, the school said. Advertisement Luck will also be involved in the film room. When asked on “College GameDay” on Saturday morning if he would have a hand in the X’s and O’s, Luck said “absolutely” while acknowledging it’s mainly Taylor’s domain. Luck said he and Taylor are “close,” and that he was on Stanford’s hiring committee when the school brought Taylor on board before the 2023 season. “I imagine this (role) being very hands-on,” Luck said. Ready to build the future of Stanford Football.#GoStanford pic.twitter.com/0F8tTTOBPx — Stanford Football (@StanfordFball) November 30, 2024  While Luck assuming the GM title itself isn’t unique, the scope of his power is. According to ESPN, the entire coaching staff reports to Luck. If he has final say on personnel decisions, that would be a significant evolution in how rosters are currently managed. In virtually every other FBS program, the head coach has the final say on who is signed — or who isn’t. The only other program that approached something akin to an NFL model is Texas Tech, where head coach Joey McGuire allows his general manager James Blanchard to offer scholarships to recruits without his approval and that department is entrusted with the evaluation of recruits and transfers. But McGuire still has the final say. Many power conference programs invest significantly in scouting and personnel departments to manage both high school recruiting and the transfer portal, similar to how NFL teams dedicate staff to college (NFL Draft) and pro (free agency) scouting. Some general managers, like Blanchard, Alabama’s Courtney Morgan, Ohio State’s Mark Pantoni and Clemson’s Jordan Sorrells, make six-figure salaries. But that’s the exception, not the rule — most personnel and recruiting staffers under the GM make five-figure salaries. But GMs, colloquially known as directors of player personnel, have become a must-have position for modern programs. Advertisement The GM role in college football became en vogue in recent years. With the launch of the transfer portal in 2018 and rise of transfers since, the shift to making transfers immediately eligible plus the addition of NIL compensation, roster management has become quite complex. Gone are the days of simply signing 25 high school recruits per year. Now most teams sign a mix of high school recruits and a double-digit number of transfers. Luck’s role also will span far beyond simple roster management, though that’s a key component of it. One aspect that’s unclear: With the coaching staff reporting to Luck, how much influence will he have in hiring and firing decisions? Does that remain the domain of the athletic director and school president? If Luck has significant weight in those decisions, his role more resembles that of an NFL GM. Stanford’s decision to give Luck more power than any other college football GM could foreshadow the sport’s future. With revenue sharing on the way via the House v. NCAA settlement, college football rosters can be managed similarly to the way NFL rosters are: Payrolls will have to be managed. Evolving how players are acquired and teams are built only makes sense. GO DEEPER What to know about House v. NCAA settlement and a historic day for college sports The Cardinal may be on the cutting edge of college football program management and installing someone like Luck, a sharp mind who has a deep football background and is passionate about the school, is a logical first step. “I am a product of this University, of Nerd Nation; I love this place,” Luck said in a statement. “I believe deeply in Stanford’s unique approach to athletics and academics and the opportunity to help drive our program back to the top. Coach Taylor has the team pointed in the right direction, and I cannot wait to work with him, the staff, and the best, brightest, and toughest football players in the world.” Advertisement Stanford has always been Luck’s happy place. It’s where, in four years, he went from nerdy, redshirt freshman to a two-time Heisman runner-up and arguably the best NFL prospect since John Elway. It’s where he met his wife Nicole as an undergrad, and where they settled with their two daughters in 2022 after moving from Indianapolis — where they lived for three years after he stunned the Indianapolis Colts and NFL with his August 2019 retirement. Luck was most recently volunteering as a quarterback coach at Palo Alto High School while pursuing his Master’s degree in education at Stanford. He earned a Bachelor’s degree in architectural design there in 2012. But Luck was looking, since as far back as the early days of his retirement, for his next challenge, unsure of what was next for him. He craves a challenge, and retiring at such a young age — he was just 29 when he walked away from the NFL — left him wandering. He surfed. He skied. He cooked. He read. For a time, he was a stay-at-home dad while Nicole pursued a career in television production. He’d sometimes joke with himself, saying “I can’t be retired at 30. That ain’t right.” So the gig with the Stanford football program — and a unique one at that — fits him and his talents. Along with Jim Plunkett and Elway, Luck is one of the greatest players in program history. In three years with the Cardinal, Luck completed a combined 67 percent of passes for 9,430 yards and 82 touchdowns against 22 interceptions. He added 957 yards and seven scores on the ground en route to a 2022 College Football Hall of Fame induction. Now, Lucks looks to reinstate dominance at Stanford after the program posted four straight 3-9 seasons. “Football gave me a lot,” Luck said last spring. “Most importantly … the relationships and the experiences with people that I love. Part of me feels like it’s my turn to give back to this game.” (Photo: David Madison / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The long-awaited report from FIFA’s sub-committee on human rights and social responsibility — finally published on Friday at midnight Central European Time — says the governing body “took a number of steps to seek to meet its responsibility to respect human rights” as part of the delivery of the tournament two years ago. Advertisement However, FIFA failed to meet one of the report’s primary recommendations of using the Qatar Legacy Fund to remedy workers impacted by human rights abuses, instead announcing they would donate the money to several other programmes which will not directly compensate workers in Qatar. FIFA insisted the study was not “a legal assessment of the obligation to remedy”. The independent study, commissioned by the sub-committee and developed by the business and human rights advisory firm ‘Human Level’, notes that “a number of severe human rights impacts did ultimately occur in Qatar from 2010 through 2022” for a number of workers connected to the tournament. This included “deaths, injuries and illnesses; wages not being paid for months on end; and significant debt faced by workers and their families reimbursing the fees they paid to obtain jobs in Qatar.” While acknowledging that “the main responsibility to rectify such shortcomings lies with the direct employers of these workers as well as with the Qatari government” the sub-committee “endorses the view expressed in the Human Level Study that FIFA too has a responsibility to take additional measures to contribute to the provision of remedy to these workers.” World Cup organizers have put the number of deaths directly linked to the delivery of the tournament at 40. Human rights groups have long estimated that thousands of workers died. GO DEEPER Explained: Why it is so hard to provide a death toll for Qatar’s migrant workers A FIFA spokesperson said: “All reports and recommendations were considered during a comprehensive review by the FIFA administration and relevant bodies. While all recommendations could not be met, practical and impactful elements were retained. “It should be noted that the study did not specifically constitute a legal assessment of the obligation to remedy.” The report recommends that FIFA should use its Qatar Legacy Fund to remedy workers impacted or, for those who died, their family members. Advertisement The sub-committee advises them to “act upon the intention, as indicated by FIFA in a press release of 19 November 2022, to dedicate the FIFA World Cup 2022 Legacy Fund in full or in part to further strengthen the competition’s legacy for migrant workers.” However, two days before the report’s publication FIFA announced the $50million fund would instead be used on a series of social programmes globally in collaboration with Qatar and three organisations, the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Trade Organization (WTO) and UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, instead. A FIFA spokesperson said: “The creation of the FIFA World Cup 2022 Legacy Fund was unanimously endorsed by the FIFA Council following a proposal made by the FIFA governance, audit and compliance committee. “A Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was established in Qatar in 2018 and FIFA believes the new Legacy Fund, endorsed by recognised international agencies, is a pragmatic and transparent initiative that will encompass social programmes to help people most in need across the world.” Following the award of the World Cup to Qatar, FIFA has added human rights as a consideration as part of its bidding process for tournaments. On Friday FIFA’s evaluation report for Saudi Arabia’s 2034 World Cup bid declared the risk assessment for human rights to be “medium”. A vote on the hosts for the tournament — where the Saudi bid has no rival — will take place at the FIFA Congress on December 11.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Chiefs survive at Arrowhead on Black Friday after critical Raiders botched snap: Key takeaways,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5957553/2024/11/29/chiefs-raiders-game-takeaways/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 00:26:07 GMT",Kansas City became the first team to clinch a spot in the postseason after earning a stunning Week 13 victory.,"NFL By Nate Taylor, Vic Tafur, Tashan Reed and Jelani Scott The Kansas City Chiefs (11-1) managed to hang on once again against the division-rival Las Vegas Raiders (2-10) in Week 13, thanks in part to a huge late-game error, to earn a season sweep with a thrilling 19-17 win on Black Friday. The reigning Super Bowl champions entered the short week looking to tighten up after facing criticism for their offensive line play and string of one-score games. But against a fiery Raiders squad led by the returning Aidan O’Connell, Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs saw their issues continue in a matchup that came down to the last possession. Kansas City’s two-point lead appeared in jeopardy with O’Connell and company positioning kicker Daniel Carlson for a potential game-winning field goal with 15 seconds left to play. Advertisement Amazingly, a miscommunication between O’Connell and rookie center Jackson Powers-Johnson led to a botched snap that was recovered by Chiefs linebacker Nick Bolton. The Raiders were also whistled for an illegal shift on the play, which added to the drama. The play cost the Raiders a chance to play spoiler and also made the Chiefs the first team to clinch a spot in the postseason on a day when Mahomes unseated the legendary Len Dawson by completing a franchise-record 238th touchdown pass. The Raiders fumble it, the Chiefs recover it to seal the game ‼️#LVvsKC on Prime VideoAlso streaming on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/WvNvUONRM5 — NFL (@NFL) November 29, 2024  What a WILD ending on Black Friday 👀 pic.twitter.com/JtYRVva6Zy — NFL (@NFL) November 29, 2024  Early in the fourth quarter, Mahomes pounded the ball and screamed at the Chiefs sideline in the direction of coach Andy Reid and offensive coordinator Matt Nagy. Mahomes was sacked five times for the second time in five days. The Raiders, much like the Carolina Panthers this past Sunday, attacked the Chiefs’ biggest weakness: the left tackle position, the lineman responsible for protecting Mahomes’ blind side. Left tackle Wanya Morris, who has played the past month with a right knee injury, struggled mightily in pass protection. The Chiefs even replaced Morris midway through the fourth quarter, moving Joe Thuney from left guard to left tackle and inserting Mike Caliendo, a second-year player, at left guard. Although the Chiefs entered the red zone five times, they scored only one touchdown — and even that highlight included Mahomes getting hit by defensive end K’Lavon Chaisson, who beat Morris, just before releasing his pass that resulted in a 6-yard touchdown to receiver Justin Watson. Advertisement On Monday, the Chiefs signed D.J. Humphries, a move general manager Brett Veach made to ensure the team protected itself in case Morris misses time the rest of the season. It appears Humphries, an eight-year veteran, will need to be ready to start for the Chiefs next week against the Los Angeles Chargers. — Nate Taylor, Chiefs beat writer The Raiders had the ball at the Chiefs’ 32-yard line with just 14 seconds left in the game and seemed headed for a game-winning field goal attempt. While Carlson was just 1-for-4 on field goals at that point, all three of his misses were 55 yards or longer. This field goal try would be much shorter. Shockingly, Carlson would never get the chance to try it. On third-and-3, Powers-Johnson snapped the ball before O’Connell was prepared for it. O’Connell mishandled the snap, and it was recovered by Chiefs LB Nick Bolton. There was some drama in the moments that followed because a flag was thrown on the field, but the penalty was on the Raiders. It appeared that one of the officials had whistled the play dead, which could have overturned the fumble, but the play was allowed to continue. That was the correct call, Michael Signora, the NFL’s senior vice president of football and international communications, explained afterward. “Had the clock been running at the snap,” Signora said, “then by rule an illegal shift would convert to a false start. Since the clock was stopped (because of the spike on the second-down play), an illegal shift is a live ball foul.” The Chiefs were able to kneel it out from there to finish off a heartbreaking loss for the Raiders. In an instant, they went from having a chance to upset the back-to-back champions to losing their eighth straight game. — Tashan Reed, Raiders senior writer Advertisement It doesn’t matter who is wearing the jerseys, apparently, the Raiders defense just loves to show up against Mahomes and the Chiefs in Kansas City. Eleven months after beating the Chiefs 20-14 on Christmas, the Raiders defense had a season-high five sacks on a season-high 11 quarterback pressures on Friday to almost beat them again. The Raiders continually harassed Mahomes, as Chaisson had 1 1/2 of the team’s five sacks. The former first-round pick of the Jaguars was signed by the Raiders to the practice squad in September and promoted to the active roster a month later. Chaisson had 1 1/2 sacks going into Friday’s game. — Vic Tafur, Raiders senior writer (Photo: Jamie Squire / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Las Vegas had the ball at the Kansas City 32-yard line with 14 seconds left, well within field goal range, but a mistimed snap by rookie center Jackson Powers-Johnson was recovered by Chiefs linebacker Nick Bolton to secure the Kansas City win and break the Raiders' hearts.  Las Vegas actually outgained Kansas City by over 100 yards in this game, 434-329. Brock Bowers was the standout performer, reeling in 10 catches for 140 yards and a touchdown. Tre Tucker also caught a 58-yard TD pass from Aidan O'Connell.  Patrick Mahomes threw for 306 yards and a TD as the Chiefs improved to 11-1, keeping themselves in the driver's seat for the top seed in the AFC. The Raiders lost their eighth straight game to fall to 2-10. They remain firmly in the hunt for the No. 1 overall draft pick, along with the Giants and the Jaguars.  GO FURTHER Chiefs survive at Arrowhead on Black Friday after critical Raiders botched snap: Takeaways Getty Images Here's what some of you had to say about that stunning ending that handed the Chiefs another improbable win and the Raiders a heartbreaking loss. Soualexandrerocha: The Chiefs should be renamed Houdinis.  Mark M: The Chiefs are the new Patriots.  Rob R: Better to be lucky than good. Best to be lucky AND good.  Martin S: This year the Raiders should just be playing the young guys to evaluate what you got for next year.

The record is what it is, but this team is prideful. ... I don't know what to keep saying after losses,"" Pierce said postgame. The Raiders fell to 2-10 with the loss. Getty Images Both quarterbacks shined on Black Friday, with Aidan O'Connell surprisingly out producing Patrick Mahomes. The Raiders signal caller finished the game 23-35 for 340 yards and two touchdowns. Mahomes finished 26-46 for 306 yards and a touchdown. Getty Images O'Connell takes full blame, said he clapped too early and that's a clear sign to hike the ball. Getty Images It's not the result he wanted, but star Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby continued putting himself in rarified air on Sunday, playing every Las Vegas defensive snap for a record sixth straight game, per NFL's Next Gen Stats. Getty Images Sure, the normally reliable Daniel Carlson had missed three field goals. But the Raiders were set up at the Chiefs' 32-yard line, putting Carlson in line for a 49-yard attempt — a shorter distance than any of his three misses — before rookie center Jackson Powers-Johnson's early snap caused a fumble that the Chiefs recovered.  It's a brutal way to end a game in which the Raiders more than held their own against the Chiefs all afternoon long. Las Vegas outgained Kansas City by more than 100 yards (434 to 329), had more first downs (20 to 18), recorded more sacks and did not commit a turnover until that final play. Advertisement Getty Images Antonio Pierce said the plan was to throw the ball away to kill some more time before the Raiders attempted a field goal. The Athletic If the season were to end today, the AFC West would have three playoff teams for the first time since 2013. With the victory, Kansas City maintains the No. 1 seed in the AFC over Buffalo. It is worth noting that the Bills hold the tiebreaker after beating the Chiefs in Week 11. Getty Images Raiders center Jackson Powers-Johnson said it was a miscommunication on the final offensive play. He thought O'Connell was calling for the snap, but he wasn't. He shouldered the blame. ""We didn't come up short,"" Powers-Johnson said, ""I came up short."" The Athletic With another chaotic victory over a lesser team, Kansas City is now 3.5 games clear of the Chargers in the AFC West. The two teams will face off on Sunday Night Football next week at Arrowhead Stadium. This week, Los Angeles will face the Falcons in Atlanta and the Broncos will host the Cleveland Browns on Monday Night Football. Getty Images The Kansas City Chiefs have now won 14 straight one-possession games (including playoffs), passing the 2003-04 New England Patriots — the last team to win back-to-back Super Bowls before the Chiefs did — for the longest such streak in NFL history.

Getty Images The Raiders will head to Tampa Bay to face the Buccaneers at 1 p.m. ET next Sunday. The game will be televised regionally on CBS. A silver lining for Raiders fans who had hoped for another shocking upset at Arrowhead Stadium: Las Vegas is tied with the New York Giants in pole position for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. That result comes shortly after top prospects Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter continued to burnish their NFL draft stock resumes in Colorado's blowout win over Oklahoma State.  GO FURTHER Travis Hunter, Colorado demolish Oklahoma State 52-0 to keep slim Playoff hopes alive: Key takeaways Imagn Images A Chiefs loss would have left Kansas City vulnerable to lose the No. 1 seed in the AFC if the Buffalo Bills had defeated the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday night. Instead, Kansas City has clinched a playoff spot before the calendar has even flipped to December and remains in the driver's seat in the AFC even with a Bills victory. Advertisement Getty Images The Raiders may have quarterback issues, but whoever is under center in Las Vegas next season (and beyond) will be throwing to someone who looks well on his way to fulfilling the Pro Bowl potential that made him a first-round pick in this year's draft.  Bowers is up to 884 receiving yards this season — leading all NFL rookies by a wide margin — after another spectacular showing. He had 140 yards and a touchdown on 10 catches to help the Raiders to their biggest win of his young career. End of Q4 Raiders 17, Chiefs 19 WOW! O'Connell fires a strike to Bowers for a gain of 25 yards to reach midfield. After two more completions, the Raiders have the ball at the Chiefs 32-yard line when disaster strikes.

Dart’s 515 passing yards in that game also broke the Ole Miss single-game passing record. Archie, Eli’s father, had an All-American quarterback career at Ole Miss from 1968 to 1970 that saw him graduate with the SEC records for most pass completions in a game (33), most career total offense (5,576 yards), SEC Player of the Year honors as well as a plethora of Heisman votes in his final two seasons. Eli (No. 10) and Archie (No. 18) are two of four former Ole Miss football players to have their number retired by the school.

The Buffalo metro area is bracing for heavy lake-effect snowfall leading up to kickoff between the Bills (9-2) and 49ers (5-6) on “Sunday Night Football.” According to the National Weather Service, the greatest snow amounts in the Buffalo area are expected across the nearby Southern suburbs, where Buffalo’s Highmark Stadium is located. They could see as much as 1-to-2 feet of total snow accumulation by Sunday evening. Snow showers are expected to begin late Friday with a lake-effect snow warning in effect from 7 a.m. ET on Saturday until 7 p.m. ET on Sunday, about 90 minutes before kickoff at 8:20 p.m. ET.

Left tackle Trent Williams, who missed the recent game against the Green Bay Packers with what he’s described as a bone bruise on his heel, also will be out for the Buffalo Bills game. Meanwhile, the player who lines up next to him, left guard Aaron Banks, didn’t practice at all this week and remains in the concussion protocol. Advertisement Jaylon Moore, who got high marks against the Packers, will start at left tackle for the second straight week while Ben Bartch is the top candidate to start at left guard. If that’s the case on Sunday, it would be Bartch’s first-ever start for the 49ers. After a very light practice on Wednesday, Purdy threw more aggressively on Thursday and was full go in Friday’s practice. He’s officially listed as questionable for the game, though coach Kyle Shanahan said the plan is for Purdy to start on Sunday. “Lots of things can happen between now and then, but right now he’s playing,” Shanahan said. Unlike last Friday, Brock Purdy is throwing today. What’s more, Brandon Allen is in a scout-teamer-of-week jersey, suggesting he’s not the starter. pic.twitter.com/KQVwFjjIDA — Matt Barrows (@mattbarrows) November 29, 2024  Purdy said he hadn’t missed a start due to a medical issue since his junior year of high school when he sat out the first three games of the season with mononucleosis. He’s been injured before, but always found a way to rebound ahead of his next start. He thought that was going to be the case the Thursday before the Packers game. But when he went to throw that day, the shoulder didn’t feel right and he was shut down until the following Monday. This week went better, especially Thursday’s practice. “That’s when I practiced and felt good about it,” he said. “And (Friday) I felt really good at practice, too.” Purdy’s been sacked 20 times this season, which ranks in the middle of the league and roughly matches his sack rate from a year ago. However, he’s vacating the pocket and rushing the ball far more than he was a year ago. In 10 starts, he has 51 carries for 267 yards and four touchdowns vs. 39 carries, 144 yards and two touchdowns in 16 games last season. Purdy, for example, dove for a touchdown in his most recent game against the Seattle Seahawks. Does he need to re-think his aggressiveness given his recent injury? Advertisement “No,” said Purdy, who said he didn’t know which play against the Seahawks resulted in his shoulder injury. “That’s part of my game – being able to move around and do what it takes to get into the end zone,” he said. “And I’ve done that in high school, college and the NFL. So obviously I have to be smart and protect myself, that kind of thing. But my competitive nature — I want to make it happen if I can.” On defense, the team will be without defensive end Nick Bosa for the second straight week and also will be missing cornerback Deommodore Lenoir, who banged knees with a Packers player on Sunday and didn’t practice this week. Shanahan said Lenoir is dealing with a bruised knee but doesn’t have any ligament damage. The 49ers could see the return of cornerback Charvarius Ward, who hasn’t played since his daughter’s sudden passing last month but who practiced in full during the week. If Ward plays, he could start opposite rookie Renardo Green (neck, questionable) with Isaac Yiadom and Rock Ya-Sin serving as the third and fourth cornerbacks. Bosa (hip/oblique) said earlier in the week that he felt better than he did heading into the Packers game but that he needed to make more progress to be able to suit up in Buffalo. The 49ers also will be without one defensive tackle, Jordan Elliott (concussion), but likely will have another, Kevin Givens (groin), back for this game. Shanahan said the 49ers are not quite ready to activate Dre Greenlaw (Achilles) from injured reserve. Greenlaw has been a limited participant in practice this week. Asked when Greenlaw could return to the playing field, Shanahan noted that next week’s game against the Chicago Bears is followed by a Thursday game against the Los Angeles Rams and that the quick turnaround might be tough for a player who’s been out as long as Greenlaw. That is, the Rams game seems more realistic than the Bears game for Greenlaw’s return. (Photo: Lachlan Cunningham / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The utility man, in several ways, epitomized the kind of optionality the franchise has always coveted. Advertisement So they wasted little time ensuring the Edman would stick around. Edman and the Dodgers are in agreement on a five-year, $74 million contract extension, the club announced Friday. The deal starts next season (he was originally set to make $8.25 million) and includes a club option for 2030, with $25 million being deferred over 10 years, a league source confirmed. ESPN first reported the deal, which it said includes a $17 million signing bonus. That’s our World Series Champ and NLCSMVP! pic.twitter.com/LqEgRYhZXY — Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) November 29, 2024  Edman landing with the eventual World Series champions almost didn’t happen this summer — at least not like it did. Discussions this summer with the St. Louis Cardinals and interested clubs initially had Edman set to be dealt to the last-place Chicago White Sox and then be redirected to a contender. The Dodgers jumped into the talks themselves, sending infielder/outfielder Miguel Vargas to Chicago along with minor leaguers Alexander Albertus and Jeral Perez to acquire Edman and reliever Michael Kopech. Each emerged as critical postseason heroes for the eventual World Series champions, and remained under club control for 2025 as well. Now, the Dodgers are tacking on more time with the ultra-versatile Edman. Edman, 29, went 11-for-27 (.407) with one home run, three doubles and 11 RBI in the Dodgers’ NLCS win over the Mets and won NLCS MVP honors. And he proved to be a valuable contributor through the postseason, finishing with a .328 batting average, 20 hits, two home runs, 13 RBI and 12 runs scored in 16 games. Edman slashed .265/.319/.408 across 2,425 plate appearances in his five prior seasons as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals, for whom he debuted in 2019. He made 13 starts at shortstop and 22 starts in center field in his first season with the Dodgers. Where he plays in 2025 is not immediately clear, with the Dodgers expected to move Mookie Betts to the infield but still seeking to add a corner outfielder. Edman won the 2021 National League Gold Glove Award at second base, where he made 115 starts in addition to 35 in right field and three at shortstop. He tallied 12 Outs Above Average at second base that season. (Photo: Alex Slitz / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Cameron Archer thought he had given the visiting side to The Amex Stadium the lead when he fired home from Ryan Fraser’s cross after 68 minutes. Advertisement However, after a lengthy video assistant referee (VAR) review of more than four minutes the goal was chalked off with forward Adam Armstrong deemed to be in an offside position and interfering with play. The IFAB (The International Football Association Board) laws of the game state that a player in an offside position should be penalised for interfering if they are “preventing an opponent from playing or being able to play the ball by clearly obstructing the opponent’s line of vision; challenging an opponent for the ball; clearly attempting to play a ball which is close when this action impacts on an opponent or making an obvious action which clearly impacts on the ability of an opponent to play the ball.” The Premier League later confirmed that Armstrong was ruled to be impacting goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen’s ability to play the ball coming across the box. “The referee’s call of no goal was checked and confirmed by the VAR as Armstrong was in an offside position and deemed to be impacting Verbruggen’s ability to play the ball,” the Premier League Match Centre account posted on X. #BHASOU – 68’  The referee’s call of no goal was checked and confirmed by the VAR as Armstrong was in an offside position and deemed to be impacting Verbruggen’s ability to play the ball. pic.twitter.com/d7DXvQqTet — Premier League Match Centre (@PLMatchCentre) November 29, 2024  Martin, however, had a different view of the incident. “I’m fed up with talking about it. It’s a brilliant goal, a well-worked goal,” he told Sky Sports. “I respect how difficult the decision is for the referee and the assistant referee. It is really difficult, but I find it hard to accept. “We were told it affects Bart Verbruggen’s ability and if Adam’s run moved Verbruggen from his position then I would understand the decision, but he hasn’t moved. I cannot see how it has affected the goalkeeper. Advertisement “This is the point of VAR, I would rather the (referee) make a mistake on the pitch and we go, ‘No problem.’ “It is still human error in my opinion. The mistake is, it’s not clear and obvious enough to be corrected. The on-field decision carries weight. I am frustrated, but I am really proud of my players.” Southampton were forced to settle for a point with Flynn Downes’ first goal of the season cancelling out Kaoru Mitoma’s opener. The two managers appeared to clash at the final whistle with Brighton’s Fabian Hurzeler later accusing Martin of a lack of respect. “It’s so important to respect each other, how you talk to each other on the touchline. That’s how I got educated,” he said. Asked to expand on what Martin had said, Hurzeler replied: “You should ask him.” In response Martin said: “Respect is mutual. The amount of times in the opposition dugout they asked for a booking for one of our players, I have never known it to be to that level.” Southampton remain bottom of the Premier League table four points from safety while Brighton moved up to second above Manchester City.

After last week’s 37-21 loss at Kansas, the Buffaloes didn’t just respond Friday morning in Boulder, they obliterated the opposition. Colorado walloped Oklahoma State 52-0 inside Folsom Field to improve to 9-3 (7-2 in Big 12 play). It was Colorado’s largest margin of victory since beating Minnesota 58-0 in 1991. Advertisement More important than stampeding over the downtrodden Cowboys (3-9, 0-9), the Buffaloes kept their slim hopes for a Big 12 title game appearance alive. For the Buffaloes to earn a shot at playing for a conference crown, they need at least two of the other three teams sitting at 6-2 in the Big 12 — Arizona State, Iowa State and BYU — to lose on Saturday. Those three teams all have a leg up on Colorado. ASU faces rival Arizona on the road Saturday, while Iowa State hosts Kansas State. BYU hosts Houston on Saturday night. Of the litany of scenarios still in play for several programs to get to Arlington, Texas, for the title game, much of the potential chaos begins with a BYU loss at home.

With a three-touchdown, one-interception outing in the dominant win, Hunter’s plethora of Heisman poses in the end zones in recent weeks seem prescient.

Sanders said earlier this week that both Hunter and his son, Shedeur, will play in whatever bowl game Colorado is invited to next month. “Our kids are going to play in our bowl game,” Sanders said again Friday. “Because that’s what we signed up to do. We’re going to finish. We’re not going to tap out because that throws off the structure of next season.” GO DEEPER Travis Hunter tracker: Potential No. 1 NFL Draft pick closes regular season in style Just a few months ago, Oklahoma State was a trendy pick to not only win the Big 12 but potentially make the new 12-team College Football Playoff. Considering the way the Cowboys’ season just ended, it’s hard to fathom they were even in the conversation. The 52-0 loss at Colorado was the largest margin of defeat in the Mike Gundy era. Oklahoma State lost its last nine games of the year after starting 3-0 and was the only Big 12 team to lose every conference game in 2024. Prior to the last possession of the game, when both sides deployed the depths of their own depth chart, the Cowboys had just 61 yards of total offense. Advertisement Defensively, Oklahoma State was the worst power-conference team in the country entering Friday’s finale. The lopsided loss will only compound the many issues facing the Cowboys as they enter a crucial offseason. Before this disastrous campaign, Gundy, who is tied with Utah’s Kyle Whittingham for the second-longest-tenured head coach in college football, had just one losing season, his first back in 2005.

Advertisement “Personally, I have made the difficult decision that it’s the right time for me to step away from the club, as the organization defines its vision for the future,” Herdman said in a statement via the team. “It has been an honour to wear the Toronto FC crest and contribute to the growth of the club. Working with this dedicated group of players and staff has been a true privilege. “I want to thank Keith Pelley and MLSE ownership for the opportunity, and I also want to thank the incredible fans for the support they’ve shown me both on and off the pitch. “I wish the organization success going forward, and I look forward to the next chapter in my career.” Toronto FC announced today that John Herdman has resigned his position as Head Coach of the club, effective today. 📰: https://t.co/QfxgJo0Y0P pic.twitter.com/iTxhOe9Yr2 — Toronto FC (@TorontoFC) November 29, 2024  MLSE president and CEO Keith Pelley thanked Herdman for his efforts. “On behalf of the entire organization, I thank John for his commitment to Toronto FC and for the important strides for the club during his time as head coach,” Kelly said. “John’s passion for the game and dedication is evident to all those he has worked with and we wish him and his family the very best.” Toronto becomes the fifth open vacancy in Major League Soccer. NYCFC, Atlanta United, Philadelphia Union and Vancouver Whitecaps are all also searching for new head coaches. Inter Miami this week named Javier Mascherano as Gerardo ‘Tata’ Martino’s successor following his own resignation earlier this month. Herdman was the head coach of the Canadian women’s team between 2011 and 2018, guiding the side to Olympic bronze medals in 2012 and 2016. The drone spying scandal uncovered at the 2024 Paris Games sparked questions over his role in creating what Canada Soccer CEO and general secretary Kevin Blue called a “deeply embedded systemic culture” while he was in charge. Herdman was not interviewed as part of a months-long investigation into the use of drones by both the women’s and men’s national teams owing to what Canada Soccer called “scheduling issues” but a “disciplinary process” is underway. Analysis from Joshua Kloke Even with the recent publication of an independent report that concluded some of the coaching staff of Canada’s women’s national soccer team spied on the New Zealand during the 2024 Paris Olympics, Herdman’s role within Canada Soccer’s spying scandal remained in question. The independent report stated a “disciplinary process” was underway to examine “potential violations of the Canada Soccer Code of Conduct and Ethics by the former head coach of the men’s national team”. Advertisement It’s believed Herdman could have been prevented from coaching in Canada Soccer-sanctioned competitions such as the Canadian Championship, which Toronto FC compete in. And so resigning from his position hardly absolves him of any guilt, but only suggests that Herdman and Toronto FC knew questions about his role in the scandal and possible repercussions would continue. The reality as well is that Herdman didn’t necessarily have the full backing from Toronto FC ownership as part of a full rebuild. Herdman inspired TFC to more energetic play early in the 2024 season but he looked unable to get the most out of the team’s stars as the season wore on. If you’re TFC and you’re looking to take this rebuild seriously, that includes taking a hard look at the coaching staff. The issue of the club’s poor culture was front and centre to end the season. If there were any questions from within TFC management and ownership about whether Herdman would have been able to inspire a healthier culture within the team, it’s possible he might have been dismissed before the season anyway.

Center Tanor Bortolini, right tackle Braden Smith and wide receiver Ashton Dulin were also ruled out. All four players did not practice this week. Steichen also said left tackle Bernhard Raimann will return after missing two games with a left knee injury. Advertisement Smith will miss his first game of the season as he deals with a personal matter. Bortolini suffered a concussion in Indianapolis’ loss against Detroit last week, Dulin injured his left ankle and Downs sustained a right shoulder injury. Downs said Friday his shoulder is “fine,” and he’s considered week to week. “Just comes down to what the coaches and the trainers think (is) best,” Downs said of being ruled out. Sunday will mark Downs’ third missed game of the season. He sat the Colts’ first two games of the season due to a right high ankle sprain. His absence is a significant development for quarterback Anthony Richardson and the offense. Downs has emerged as Indianapolis’ top receiver this season, leading the team in targets (78), receptions (53), first-down catches (31) and receiving yards per game (59.4). He’s also tied with fellow wideout Alec Pierce with a team-high four receiving touchdowns. The Colts will likely lean more on Pierce, veteran Michael Pittman Jr. and rookie AD Mitchell since Downs and Dulin are sidelined. Mitchell, whom the Colts selected in the second round of the draft, has 20 catches for 254 yards in 12 games. Pittman has been the team’s top receiver in recent years. He’s had an up-and-down campaign due to a nagging back injury, but is coming off one of his best performances of the season with six catches for 96 yards against the Lions. Pierce returned to practice Friday, after missing a couple of days due to a foot injury, and is questionable to play Sunday. He leads the NFL with 23.3 yards per catch. “We’ve had different situations this year where different guys have been up or down, or maybe even just within the flow of a game, where a guy has been down for a drive or he’s back in the locker room for a little bit,” Colts offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter said Tuesday. “There’s no shortage of guys in that receiver room that are ready to answer the bell when their number is called.” Advertisement Despite Raimann’s return, Indianapolis’ offensive line is even more banged up than its wide receivers. The Colts will turn to their third different starting center this season as rookie fourth-round pick Bortolini remains in concussion protocol and veteran starter Ryan Kelly remains on injured reserve due to a knee injury. Bortolini had started the last three games in Kelly’s absence. Steichen said Monday that the team was “looking at Danny (Pinter)” to replace Bortolini if the rookie was unavailable against the Patriots. Pinter, a fifth-round pick by the Colts in 2020, has started just seven games in his career. Matt Goncalves appears to be the most likely replacement for Smith at right tackle. The rookie third-round pick started three games at left tackle earlier this season, but he started 13 games at right tackle during his collegiate career at Pittsburgh. The Colts’ offensive line changes may not stop there. Undrafted rookie Dalton Tucker has started seven straight games since replacing starter Will Fries, who broke his right tibia in Week 5. However, Tucker has allowed the third-most pressures (23) of any offensive lineman in the NFL during that span, per TruMedia. Asked Friday if he’ll make a move at right guard, Steichen simply said, “we’ll see.” If the Colts do make a change, veteran guard Mark Glowinski would probably be next in line. Glowinski signed with Indianapolis’ practice squad last week, and he started 55 games for the franchise from 2018 to 2021. He last played in an NFL game when he started for the Giants in their regular-season finale last year. “In this league, obviously, it’s next man up,” Steichen said of his depleted offensive line. “We got a lot of confidence in whoever’s out there that we can go out and perform at a high level.” (Photo: Andy Lyons / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Needless to say, he didn’t disappoint. Playing in his final regular-season game, Hunter — who’s already confirmed, to no one’s surprise, that he’ll enter the 2025 NFL Draft — delivered his fourth interception and fourth multi-touchdown performance of the season in a 52-0 blowout win over Oklahoma State.

TRAVIS HUNTER DOING TRAVIS HUNTER THINGS 🔥 Colorado up 21-0 in the first quarter 😳 pic.twitter.com/wpEZUnbLYb — ESPN (@espn) November 29, 2024  They say that if you had to explain college football to an extra terrestrial, you might need a decade. There’s a lot that doesn’t make sense. Take Jim Thorpe. The legendary multi-sport icon truly made a name for himself on the gridiron as a running back — but has his name attached to a trophy (the Thorpe Award) given annually to college football’s best defensive back. Thorpe also played in the secondary, of course, and was outstanding. His true legacy, though, is that he was able to wear (and master) many hats. Advertisement Consider Hunter, too. He’s perhaps the closest thing the sport has seen to Thorpe’s skill set in decades, but apparently that wasn’t good enough to make the final cut for this year’s Thorpe Award — Georgia’s Malaki Starks, Texas’ Jahdae Barron and Ohio State’s Caleb Downs were named as finalists. An absurdly college football premise. Despite the Thorpe snub, Hunter’s sensational Heisman campaign rolled on in full force during Colorado’s thrashing of Oklahoma State. The 52-point blowout also marked Hunter’s final home game in Boulder, Colo., and it’s fair to wonder if it was Hunter’s final college football game period. The answer may depend on how things shake out for the Buffaloes in the Big 12 title race. On Colorado’s Senior Day, Hunter got his own party started in the first half with his fourth interception of the season — and the ninth of his career, putting him in rare air again. ESPN flashed a graphic during the game that Hunter is now the first college football player in “30-plus years” to record at least nine interceptions and 20 touchdown catches in a career. Not even legendary Holy Cross running back/defensive back Gordie Lockbaum — a College Football Hall of Fame inductee and one of the sport’s last true two-way ironmen — pulled that off. If Colorado doesn’t make the Big 12 title game (thus, also effectively ending any type of Playoff bid), the Buffaloes could be headed for a second-tier bowl game. Beyond the question of whether or not Hunter will play for Colorado in a non-championship game, though, it’s also fair to wonder how much he’ll show NFL teams during the upcoming pre-draft process. As of today, six Colorado players have accepted invitations to the 2025 Shrine Bowl, including Shedeur Sanders, WR Will Sheppard and WR LaJohntay Wester. A recent NFL rule change now allows non-seniors to participate in postseason all-star games, which means Hunter could join his teammates at the Shrine Bowl or head to the Senior Bowl. Advertisement More likely? He’ll not only skip both, but teams will count themselves fortunate if Hunter does anything at the NFL combine — including medical evaluations. Not unlike Caleb Williams a year ago, Hunter is pretty clearly the best college player in America, and his value for NFL teams has been obvious for some time. Williams elected to skip medical evaluations in Indianapolis, instead holding them separately for interested teams only. Hunter should have that type of clout, if he wants to utilize it. Either way, Friday afternoon may well have been the last time we get to see Hunter play football for a while. Hope you didn’t blink. — Nick Baumgardner (Top photo: Dustin Bradford / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Cubs promote Casey Jacobson after Daniel Moskos leaves to be Marlins lead pitching coach: Sources,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5957321/2024/11/29/casey-jacobson-daniel-moskos-cubs-marlins-assistant-pitching-coach/,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024 20:35:06 GMT",Jacobson just wrapped up his fifth season with the organization and his second as minor-league senior coordinator of pitching development.,"MLB Just as it seemed that Chicago Cubs manager Craig Counsell was close to finalizing his staff, another organization poached his assistant pitching coach. Daniel Moskos left to be the lead pitching coach for the Miami Marlins under new manager Clayton McCullough, team sources confirmed. But Counsell moved quickly to replace Moskos, promoting from within and adding Casey Jacobson to his staff. Jacobson just wrapped up his fifth season with the organization and his second as minor-league senior coordinator of pitching development. Advertisement Jacobson is a former instructor at Driveline Baseball, a well-known player development academy in Washington, and spent six years coaching in the college ranks. Those within the organization laud Jacobson for his interpersonal skills and ability to connect with young pitchers by earning their trust by clearly delivering messages and tying it into what the player actually values. Multiple people in the organization noted his empathy with players and staff as he works to know who the human is in order to ensure that it’s clear he cares about a player’s development over his own self interests, which has helped with buy-in. From a technical aspect, Jacobson is strong with pitch design and has a keen understanding of what delivery traits lead to release characteristics, an essential part of figuring out avenues for improvement. Jacobson impacted the development of several young pitchers in the Cubs organization, including Porter Hodge (emphasized the elite characteristics of his four-seamer early in his professional career leading to an uptick in usage), Daniel Palencia (helped with pitch design of his breaking ball and overall development) and Jordan Wicks (breaking ball design and velocity training). Young pitching will be a big part of the Cubs’ future as the trio above, along with pitchers like Cade Horton, Ben Brown and Hayden Wesneski, are all going to be needed for the team to win more games in 2025 and beyond. Former manager David Ross added Moskos to his staff prior to the 2021 season as pitching coach Tommy Hottovy’s assistant. Moskos, a left-handed pitcher who was a high draft pick by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2007, spent the previous two seasons as a minor-league pitching coach with the New York Yankees. Moskos departs with high praise for his intelligence and acumen on biomechanics along with insight on pitch grip and pitch usage. Advertisement Soon after the final game of the season, Counsell let go of first-base coach Mike Napoli, bullpen coach Darren Holmes and assistant hitting coach Jim Adduci along with the entire MLB strength and conditioning staff. Third-base coach Willie Harris eventually departed as well and was replaced by former Milwaukee Brewers baserunning guru Quentin Berry. Holmes’ position was filled by Mark Strittmatter, who spent last season as Counsell’s major-league field coordinator, and the Cubs promoted Mark Weisman and Kevin Poppe from the minor-league staff to lead strength and conditioning at the MLB level. The expectation is that an announcement for Counsell’s entire staff, including a first-base coach, will be coming shortly. (Photo: Nuccio DiNuzzo / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is seeking a “period of ineligibility of one or two years” after an independent tribunal convened by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) found the Italian bore “no fault or negligence” for two separate adverse analytical findings. Advertisement Sinner tested positive for the banned anabolic steroid clostebol on two occasions in March of this year, in-competition at the BNP Paribas Open held in Indian Wells and out of competition eight days later. Sinner was stripped of the ranking points and prize money he won for taking victory in Indian Wells but was allowed to continue competing. Any overturning of the initial verdict could see the 23-year-old barred from competing in the sport at all levels. The world No. 1, who said he was “surprised” by WADA’s decision to appeal, has continued playing with the doping allegations hanging over him since and is set to do so again in Melbourne. CAS published its latest list of hearings on Thursday with Sinner’s not listed to be heard between now and February 11. The Australian Open is scheduled to take place between January 12 and 26. “Obviously I’m very disappointed and also surprised of this appeal, to be honest, because we had three hearings. All three hearings came out very positively for me,” Sinner said in September following confirmation of WADA’s decision. “We always talk about the same thing. Maybe they just want to make sure that everything is in the right position.” An independent tribunal convened by the ITIA and conducted by Sports Resolutions ruled that Sinner bore “no fault or negligence” for the positive tests in a hearing on August 15, but still found Sinner committed two anti-doping violations. It accepted Sinner’s explanation that his physiotherapist, Umberto Ferrara, had brought an over-the-counter healing spray containing clostebol to Indian Wells. His trainer, physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi, cut his hand, and then used the spray on that cut. Naldi then conducted massages on Sinner, which led to transdermal contamination with the clostebol from the healing spray. WADA is challenging the decision that Sinner was not at fault for his violation. Sinner parted company with both Naldi and Ferrara on the eve of the U.S. Open, which he went on to win by beating Taylor Fritz in the final.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Lions sign LB Kwon Alexander after Malcolm Rodriguez tears ACL: Sources,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5957008/2024/11/29/lions-sign-kwon-alexander-malcolm-rodriguez-injury/,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024 19:19:34 GMT",Rodriguez will miss the remainder of the 2024 season and will be the fourth Lions linebacker placed on injured reserve.,"NFL By Jeff Howe, Colton Pouncy and Chris Licata The Detroit Lions signed linebacker Kwon Alexander off the Denver Broncos’ practice squad, a league source confirmed Friday, in response to mounting injuries on defense. On Thursday, third-year linebacker Malcolm Rodriguez tore his ACL during the fourth quarter of Detroit’s 23-20 win over the Chicago Bears, a league source said. He will miss the remainder of the 2024 season. Advertisement The Lions entered Week 1 with seven linebackers on the roster, which felt high at the time. The room was praised for its depth and versatility. It was viewed as one of the strongest positions on the team. That’s not the case anymore. Rodriguez will be the fourth of those linebackers to be placed on injured reserve — once he officially lands there. He’ll join Derrick Barnes (knee), Jalen Reeves-Maybin (neck) and Alex Anzalone (forearm), all of whom have or will miss significant time with injuries. Rodriguez was filling in for the injured Anzalone, placed on injured reserve after the Jaguars game, and was a trusted, dependable player for this defense. Anzalone is expected back in late December or early January, but the Lions will be thin until then. Jack Campbell is the only linebacker left standing among Detroit’s top five at the position. Expect the Lions to lean on Ben Niemann, David Long Jr., Ezekiel Turner and now, Alexander. The Lions moved quickly to add Alexander to the mix, with Campbell hinting that Rodriguez’s injury was serious after Thursday’s win over the Bears. Alexander, 30, played in three games for Denver this season, including two starts in Weeks 7 and 9. A former Pro Bowler in 2017, the 10th-year veteran has racked up 639 tackles, 13.5 sacks, 13 forced fumbles and nine interceptions across 107 career games (90 starts). Alexander now joins his seventh NFL team, one that is trying to pick up the pieces after its defense was shattered by injuries. More than just the linebacker room, the entire Lions defense has been hit hard. Marcus Davenport and Aidan Hutchinson are done for the regular season. Starting corners Terrion Arnold and Carlton Davis have each sat out with injuries. Reserve corners Ennis Rakestraw Jr. and Emmanuel Moseley have spent time on IR. Reserve defensive linemen like John Cominsky and Kyle Peko are currently shelved. Josh Paschal (knee) and Levi Onwuzurike (hamstring) left Thursday’s game and did not return. It’s been one thing after another. The Lions won 10 games in a row and are 11-1 for the first time in franchise history, but this isn’t the same team it was even a month ago. They might need to grind out victories, like the one on Thanksgiving. (Photo: Cooper Neill / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The 48-year-old succeeds Steve Cooper, who was sacked following the club’s 2-1 home defeat against Chelsea last Saturday, signing a contract to June 2027. Van Nistelrooy will not take charge of Leicester’s trip to face Brentford on Saturday — first-team coach Ben Dawson will be in the dugout — but the Dutchman will be in position for the visit of West Ham United to the King Power Stadium on Tuesday evening. Advertisement “I’m proud, I’m excited. Everybody that I speak to about Leicester City Football Club is enthusiastic,” he said. “They have great stories about the quality of the people working at the Club, the supporters and, of course, the recent history of the club is impressive. “I’m excited to start and to get to know everyone and give everything I can for the football club.” Welcome, Ruud van Nistelrooy 🦊 💙 pic.twitter.com/wHcwZc85eY — Leicester City (@LCFC) November 29, 2024  Van Nistelrooy arrives at Leicester shortly after taking interim charge of four Manchester United games following Erik ten Hag’s sacking. He won three of those four matches — two of those against Cooper’s Leicester — and drew the other 1-1 at home against Chelsea. It is his first permanent managerial job since leaving PSV Eindhoven at the end of the 2022-23 season, when he cited a lack of support from the Dutch club’s hierarchy. Van Nistelrooy joined Ten Hag’s coaching staff at Old Trafford at the beginning of this season but was not kept on by new head coach Ruben Amorim. Former Brighton & Hove Albion head coach Graham Potter and David Moyes, most recently of West Ham United, were ruled out before the club moved for Van Nistelrooy, who did not cost any compensation, a key factor for the club given ongoing PSR concerns. Van Nistelrooy previously held talks with Burnley over replacing Vincent Kompany before he joined Ten Hag’s coaching staff. His only managerial job to date was at PSV, where he won the Dutch Cup in his sole season at the helm. Before that, he had two separate stints as assistant coach of the Netherlands national team under Guus Hiddink and later Frank de Boer. GO DEEPER Van Nistelrooy's attacking approach might be just what this Leicester team needs The news of Van Nistelrooy’s appointment brings a much-needed morale boost to the Leicester fanbase at a time when they are 16th in the Premier League and just a point above the relegation zone. While their knowledge of the former United striker’s coaching prowess is limited, this appointment provides significantly more optimism to those supporters than the one that brought Cooper to the club in the summer. Advertisement Despite lasting a little over a year as PSV manager, Van Nistelrooy did enjoy some success with the Dutch side. He led them to a second-place finish in the Eredivisie and got his hands on two trophies. The first was the Johan Cruyff Shield, the equivalent of the Community Shield, in which PSV beat Ajax 5-3 and the other was the KNVB Cup, Dutch football’s only cup competition. Despite PSV’s position in the Eredivisie being very different to Leicester’s in the Premier League, fans will be glad to hear Van Nistelrooy favoured a direct, attacking style during his time in the Netherlands that focused on building from the back and utilising the club’s threats in the wide areas. PSV were among the best sides in Europe at creating chances during his tenure. The appointment of Van Nistelrooy is far from a guarantee of Premier League survival, but the main thing that the supporters will want to see in the short term is a clear identity, something that Cooper failed to establish across 12 league games. Van Nistelrooy inherits one of the more limited squads in the division — further weakened by long-term injuries to Ricardo Pereira and Abdul Fatawu — but one with enough quality to stave off the threat of relegation.

Miami once trailed 27-3 but was marching with ease down 27-11, threatening to cut its deficit to one score with plenty of time remaining.  Tagovailoa’s completions weren’t difficult, either. Guys were running wide open. Tagovailoa wasn’t taking deep shots, but rather finding intermediate completions to consistently move the chains. Miami faced a second-and-goal from the 1 with about 11 minutes left in the game, but Green Bay’s goal-line defense stood firm. Defensive end Rashan Gary ripped down running back De’Von Achane on second down. Cornerback Keisean Nixon broke up a pass for tight end Jonnu Smith in the flat on third down. Linebacker Quay Walker sacked Tagovailoa on a delayed blitz on fourth down. Green Bay’s offense followed that sequence up with a nine-play, 78-yard drive for a field goal that consumed four minutes and 31 seconds to take a 30-11 lead and all but seal the game.

(Getty Images)              Tua Tagovailoa completed 37 of 46 passes for 365 yards with two touchdowns. Jonnu Smith, who's been a focal point in the Dolphins' offense in recent weeks, caught 10 passes for 113 yards.  Tyreek Hill caught six passes for 83 yards and a score while De'Von Achane caught eight passes for 56 yards and one touchdown. Packers QB Jordan Love completed 21 of 28 passes for 274 yards and two touchdowns RB Josh Jacobs had 23 total touches for 117 yards and a touchdown.

Tyreek Hill’s touchdown catch gives the Dolphins three players with 20+ PPR points. The list includes Tua Tagovailoa (23.8), De’Von Achane (21.0) and Hill (20.3). Jonnu Smith has also added 15.7 PPR points and Jaylen Waddle 11.3 Advertisement The 49-yard reception by Josh Jacobs has vaulted him to 21.3 PPR points tonight. That’s the third straight game Jacobs has scored 20 or more fantasy points. That streak is tied with Joe Burrow for the longest current fantasy scoring streak of that caliber. Elgton Jenkins' unnecessary roughness penalty means the Packers don't go for it on fourth and goal from the half-yard line. McManus hits the 33-yarder instead. Packers 30, Dolphins 11 Josh Jacobs owes Jordyn Brooks a new pair of ankles.  Quay Walker sacks Tua on fourth and goal. Second and goal from the 1 and Miami comes away with no points. A long drive here should do the trick. Packers still lead 27-11.  The Dolphins had a terrible first half in fantasy scoring. That last drive has helped turned things around for Miami. De’Von Achane (15.7 PPR points), Tua Tagovailoa (14.28) and Jonnu Smith (13.2) all have notched much better point totals and are now in range to have true fantasy scoring impacts with a strong fourth quarter. Advertisement That was a strong drive from the Dolphins and they'll need much more of it to get back into this game. That one went for eight plays and 70 yards and included a fourth-down conversion and two-point conversion.     Christian Watson atoned for his dropped 49-yard TD last Sunday with a diving grab for 46 down the right sideline. That was a nice drive for the Packers but it stops short of the end zone. Brandon McManus' 24-yard field goal extends the Packers lead to 27-3.   Corey Ballentine (knee) ruled out.  Many fantasy managers who started Green Bay players in their lineups have been rewarded with strong performances. Topping this list is Jayden Reed. His 17.8 PPR points mark the fourth time this year that he has scored 16+ PPR points in a game. Josh Jacobs also had a strong first half with 12.3 PPR points. Jordan Love wasn’t far behind that pace with 12.08 points. Tucker Kraft also weighed in with 7.3 PPR points. It wasn’t anywhere near as good on the Miami side of this ledger. Jonnu Smith tallied 8.3 PPR points and thus should be able to rack up his third straight game with 10+ PPR points. De’Von Achane has a solid first half with 7.3 PPR points. Tua Tagovailoa had a meager 5.32 points. The biggest disappointments so far have to Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle. Hill tallied only 1.2 PPR points in the first half and Waddle generated 2.6 points. Advertisement Green Bay is up 24-3 on the scoreboard and that has carried over to the point spread. BetMGM has the Packers listed at -18.5 points. Green Bay also has -10000 odds on the moneyline. The over/under is pushing towards 50 points, as it currently stands at 48.5 points.  The Packers are trouncing the Dolphins through 30 minutes here at Lambeau Field, breezing to a 24-3 halftime lead. Head coach Matt LaFleur moved on from former defensive coordinator Joe Barry after last season and Barry is now the Dolphins' defensive run game coordinator. In the first half, the Packers ran 16 times for 102 yards on Miami (6.4 yards per carry), which ranked No. 8 in the NFL in rushing yards allowed per game entering Week 13.  Quarterback Jordan Love is 11-for-15 with 111 passing yards and two touchdowns, both to wide receiver Jayden Reed. Punter Daniel Whelan forced a muff that turned into seven Packers points and the defense has bent but not broken, with the pass rush even showing up more so than it has most of this season. Just about everything went right for the Packers, who are 30 minutes away from entering Detroit next Thursday at 9-3. (edited)   Rebuilding since 1972 — Manuel S. Why am I watching this? — Robert R. Defense decided not to show up. Lack of hustle and poor tackling. Might as well rush 5+ guys every time to try to get some pressure. Armstead needs to retire, way too slow off the ball. Need to draft some OL players with attitude to get a run game going and some tougher DL players. — Stephen K. Join the discussion here.     Jayden Reed’s touchdown gives him 17.8 PPR points on the night. It’s the fourth game this year that Reed has scored 16 or more PPR points. For perspective, only eight wide receivers have more games of that caliber this season."

The Giants backup started after Tommy DeVito was injured in Sunday’s loss to the Buccaneers. It looked like Lock might provide a little bit of a spark after a 28-yard rush just short of the end zone and a touchdown shortly after but the Giants offense sputtered. Penalties proved crushing too, with the Giants tallying 12 as a team. After 70 total offensive yards on that possession, the Giants finished with 247 offensive yards thanks to a late drive in the final minutes. Lock faced a ton of pressure, throwing one interception and then fumbling and turning over the ball on another possession. He was sacked six times. Advertisement The home losing streak has finally come to an end. With some help from arguably the NFL’s worst team, Dallas now has won two in a row. Playoff talk is still not worth discussing, but it’s clear that the Cowboys are still fighting. The biggest positives: Overshown looks like a star, KaVontae Turpin got more offensive touches and Dowdle continues to play like he deserves to be part of the future. Collectively, the team did a nice job taking the ball away on defense and taking care of it on offense. There’s still a lot of ugly, but it buys them another week where the window has not completely closed on the season. Giants superstar defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence told reporters after Thursday's 27-20 loss to the Cowboys that he suffered a dislocated elbow and is unsure how much time he'll miss recovering from the injury. Lawrence was seen wearing a sling after the game. Any amount of time Lawrence misses would be a devastating blow to a Giants defense that is already one of the league's worst against the run. Especially because fellow defensive tackle Rakeem Nunez-Roches also left Thursday's game with an injury (stinger). Lawrence has slowed down after a torrid start to the season, but his nine sacks still rank sixth in the NFL and No. 1 among interior linemen. He was most certainly on his way to another All-Pro season. The Athletic  Above are the latest NFC wild card standings.

Brian S: NFL needs to relegate the 2 New York teams, this is a disgrace Leslie G: Should have asked Jones if he wanted to play wide receiver - um - no - 23 million reasons why Edward D: The Cowboys finally found a team they can beat at home. Join the conversation by clicking the 'Discuss' tab at the top of this page or by clicking here. In a battle of backup quarterbacks, Cooper Rush outlasted Drew Lock on Thanksgiving. Rush didn’t have a spectacular game and was aided heavily by a strong running game but after a tough start filling in for Dak Prescott, Rush has started to look more comfortable the past couple of weeks, on the road against the Washington Commanders and Thursday at home against the Giants.  This version of Rush looks a lot more like the guy who helped the Cowboys to a 4-1 record in five games without Prescott in 2022. Rush doesn’t make many spectacular plays but he’s fairly efficient, doesn’t throw many dangerous passes and usually avoids the big mistake. His play was especially magnified on a day that Lock had a decent game but made a killer error by throwing a pick-six on a screen play in the first half.  Those are the types of plays Rush has done a good job of avoiding, at least in the passing game. On Thursday, he was also able to overcome some bad drops from his top target, CeeDee Lamb, and found Brandin Cooks in some big moments in the clutch.

GO FURTHER Tottenham 2 Roma 2: Late Hummels equaliser denies Spurs victory in wildly open Europa League clash – The Briefing Alexis Saelemaekers was a second-half substitute for Roma and he was happy with the attitude shown by his team-mates throughout. ""It was a really important point for us,"" he told UEFA.com. ""We fought until the end of the game and we will go forward now. At half-time the coach said we had to continue playing as we had been. ""We came back with the same mentality, we knew if we kept pushing we could score an equaliser and that's what happened."" Advertisement Getty Images Mats Hummels played the hero for AS Roma with a last-minute equaliser to avenge his early penalty giveaway. Tottenham narrowly fumble three points at home in a thrilling 2-2 draw. Ange Postecoglou was then asked if he was shocked by the attacking threat posed by Roma. ""No, they're a good side, that's the reason they're in the Europa League,"" he said.  ""They obviously did well last year, they've had a tough time this year but they've got some quality players. But we still had enough chances to win the game."" Then, he was asked about Fraser Forster who deputised nicely for Guglielmo Vicario. ""Fraser did well, we expect that from him,"" said Postecoglou. ""He's a very experienced goalkeeper, he did his part."" Getty Images Spurs can be very good on the break thanks to Dejan Kulusevski's running power.  We saw that again before the second Tottenham goal.  It was a great run from Kulusevski onto Pape Sarr's pass, matched by the cross for Johnson to make it 2-1.  Getty Images It was briefly 2-1 to Roma after a Stephan El Shaarawy volley. But it was disallowed by VAR.  Roma had playing the better football at that point but it remained 1-1 after the offside was revealed.  Getty Images Roma had been growing into this encounter and they got themselves level.  Evan Ndicka flicked on a free-kick at the near post and the ball did enough to beat Fraser Forster. The goalkeeper stretched to get a hand on it but could not keep it out.  Advertisement Let's look back at the goals! For Tottenham's opener, was a very good advantage played from the referee Glenn Nyberg, who I thought was very sharp tonight. Son wanted a foul, and would have got one, but the Swede played on. Seconds later, Johnson worked a cross into the box, Sarr got a toe to it before Hummels, who made contact with his calf in an impatient kick out for the ball. Definite penalty, and Son slammed it home confidently. Getty Images Not the post-match interview Ange Postecoglou would have wanted to be doing when his side had the lead going into stoppage time. ""It's obviously frustrating, particularly when they score so late,"" he told TNT Sports.  ""It was a good game, we probably should have put it to bed a lot earlier. ""We missed some big chances and at 2-1, you're always keeping them in the game. So it's disappointing not to see it out."" Getty Images Tottenham's Archie Gray was keen to take the positives from the performance when he spoke to TNT Sports after the match. ""It was a tough game. The first 20 and last 20 minutes were tough,"" he said.  ""We had to dig deep but, apart from that, I thought we were good. We played our football and we were good on the counter attack. ""It's just that last moment that cost us and we've got to do better than that. It was a good performance and we'll learn from the mistakes.""  I can only imagine the criticism being aimed at Mats Hummels after he was really sloppy in conceding that early penalty. But the 35-year-old dusted himself down superbly and defended resolutely from there while also contributing with some great passing into midfield and out wide. And then he took it upon himself to decide the match with great reactions to turn Angelino's rocket of a cross into the back of the net. Life in the old dog yet... We know Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou is pretty dogmatic about his style of play. And that swashbuckling style saw them take 24 shots on goal. But it also saw them concede 18 shots. And one of them saw Mats Hummels equalise. What's that phrase about living by the sword and dying by the sword?

The Athletic Lazio, Athletic Club, and Eintracht Frankfurt are near the top of the standings with 13 points from their five matches. Tottenham drop out of the automatic qualification places, overtaken by fellow British side Rangers, who won 4-1 in Nice tonight.

They scraped past Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt thanks to Rasmus Hojlund's winner. Elsewhere, there was a massive win for Rangers in France and Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce won late in the Czech Republic. The second half had everything, even though we had to wait more than 45 minutes for a goal. There were big chances at both ends, saves from both goalkeepers, crunching tackles, and four shots that cannoned back off the crossbar. It was everything we have come to expect from matches involving Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham. On another night, Spurs would have won handsomely but they also had to heed plenty of warnings, including three Roma goals that were denied by the offside flag. A superb game of Europa League football! Advertisement It is kicking off in the away end following the full-time whistle and I can see a lot missiles being thrown. Getty Images Tottenham finally punished for their lack of efficiency in both boxes and concede an added time equaliser to Hummels.  Have to say that result is probably fair enough given everything.  Spurs should have put the game to bed a lot earlier. What a match. It ends 2-2!"
MLB News,Here is the 2024 'All-Awardless' team,https://www.mlb.com/news/2024-all-awardless-team,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:21:24 GMT",,"Anthony Castrovince As someone who has never won a Pulitzer Prize (not even for my article on All-Stars with mustaches), I have a special place in my heart for the awardless. We hand out a ton of awards in MLB. And yet somehow, there are always excellent seasons that slip through the cracks and/or simply get usurped by someone doing something historic. That’s why each year, once they’re done handing out all the real hardware, I provide some hearty virtual pats on the back to players who got shut out of the following honors: BBWAA Awards (MVP, Cy Young, Rookie of the Year)All-MLB TeamHank Aaron AwardsRoberto Clemente AwardGold Glove AwardsSilver Slugger AwardsLCS and World Series MVP AwardsOutstanding DH AwardComeback Players of the YearRelievers of the YearPlayers Choice Awards (Player of the Year, Outstanding Player, Outstanding Pitcher, Outstanding Rookie, Comeback Player) So let’s dim the lights, cue the orchestra and award the awardless! Catcher: Yainer Diaz, AstrosThe 26-year-old Diaz took over the full-time catching duties for the Astros and flourished at the plate. His 117 weighted runs created plus (17% better than league average) tied the Mariners’ Cal Raleigh (a Gold Glove winner) for second best (behind the Brewers’ William Contreras, the NL Silver Slugger) among qualified catchers. Diaz belted 16 homers and 29 doubles and drove in 84 runs. First base: Pete Alonso, MetsWas this the Polar Bear’s best season? Absolutely not. Was it a good season? Absolutely. He was fourth among qualified first basemen in wRC+ (122) while hitting 30-plus homers (34) for the fourth straight season, a career-high 31 doubles and 88 RBIs. He also had one of the biggest home runs of the postseason, taking Devin Williams deep to give the Mets the go-ahead run in their NL Wild Card Series clincher. Note that the Dodgers’ Freddie Freeman wasn’t feted with any awards for his regular season, but considering he was the World Series MVP, it didn’t really make sense to honor him with our fake award. Second base: Luis García Jr., NationalsThis was a really nice season with surprising power from the Nats’ 24-year-old second baseman, who proved himself a legit building block as they try to turn the corner. García (who for the record is the son of onetime Tigers infielder Luis García and not the son of Astros pitcher Luis García, as the latter is mathematically impossible) slashed .282/.318/.444 with 18 homers and 25 doubles. His slugging percentage was a 59-point jump from last year. Shortstop: Gunnar Henderson, OriolesI had to double- and triple-check to make sure Henderson was not an award winner, because it was so hard to believe. But ultimately, this was a bad year to be a shortstop in the same league as Bobby Witt Jr. Technically, Henderson did win his club’s Heart & Hustle Award, but Witt won the national honor there, too. So Henderson still qualifies for this list and is an easy choice given his outstanding .281/.364/.529 slash line, 37 homers, 31 doubles, seven triples, 92 RBIs and 118 runs. He finished fourth in the AL MVP voting. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Third base: Rafael Devers, Red SoxThis was the first full season since 2018 that Devers didn’t get down-ballot MVP support, but it was a typically impactful season for the Red Sox’s centerpiece. He slashed .272/.354/.516 with 28 homers, 34 doubles and a 139 OPS+, and he was an All-Star for the third time. Left field: Riley Greene, TigersThere was a lot of talk about the “pitching chaos” that got the Tigers to the postseason, but don’t ignore the steady, non-chaotic production Greene provided a lineup in need. Greene was one of Detroit's top prospects and had shown potential, but also battled injuries in 2022-23. This year, he posted for 137 games and showed out in a big way, with a .262/.348/.479 slash line, 24 homers, 27 doubles and 5.4 bWAR. He was a first-time All-Star. (Like Henderson, Greene was an individual club Heart & Hustle Award winner, but I hope we can all agree that does not violate the spirit of this important presentation.) Center field: JJ Bleday, AthleticsA guy like Bleday is why this fake awards team exists, because his excellent season is too easily lost in the shuffle. Bleday was the fourth overall pick in the 2019 Draft by the Marlins, for whom he made his big league debut in July 2022 before getting dealt to the A’s in February 2023. Prior to 2024, he had not panned out as hoped. But in his age-26 season, he broke through with 20 homers, 43 doubles and four triples. Only 16 players had more extra-base hits than Bleday’s 67. And because there wasn’t a ton of opportunity for him in that A’s lineup, he only drove in 60 runs. Interestingly, it marked only the 34th time since the RBI became a stat in 1920 that a player had 60 or more extra-base hits and 60 or fewer RBIs. Now you know why you didn’t hear a ton about him. Right field: Seiya Suzuki, CubsThis might be the last place Suzuki is listed as a right fielder, because he became a full-time DH in mid-August. But his defensive struggles notwithstanding, he produced enough at the plate to make our team. For the season, Suzuki slashed .283/.366/.482 in 132 games. His 138 OPS+ tied for seventh in the NL with MVP runner-up Francisco Lindor and was sixth among all outfielders in MLB. His 21 homers were his best since coming over to MLB in 2022, as were his 16 steals and 3.2 bWAR. Designated hitter: Marcell Ozuna, BravesThis is the second straight year Ozuna has been named the All-Awardless DH. So ... congrats? Obviously, there was only one Shohei Ohtani at DH in the NL (and the Astros’ Yordan Alvarez deservedly was the other All-MLB representative at the DH spot), but Ozuna had his second straight season with an OPS over .900. He provided a ton of power, falling one homer shy (39) of last year’s career high, while setting a new career high in doubles (31). But it wasn’t just that. The 34-year-old Ozuna also batted over .300 for the first time in a full season since 2017, and his .378 on-base percentage was a new career best for a full season. Starting pitcher: Cole Ragans, RoyalsThough he was overshadowed by teammate and second-place finisher Seth Lugo in the AL Cy Young voting, Ragans did finish fourth by building on his 2023 breakout in a meaningful way. Ragans had come to K.C. from the Rangers in the midseason trade in ’23 that sent Aroldis Chapman to Texas. Since then, he is 16-11 with a 3.00 ERA and a 143 ERA+ (43% better than league average) in 44 starts. This season, only nine qualified pitchers had a higher ERA+ than Ragans’ 135 mark, including NL Cy Young winner Chris Sale (174), AL Cy Young winner Tarik Skubal (170) and NL runner-up (and All-MLB first teamer) Zack Wheeler (158). So Ragans clearly belonged on the All-MLB Team, but some would say getting mentioned here is a bigger deal. (OK, nobody’s really saying that.) Relief pitcher: Cade Smith, GuardiansSmith had a really strong argument for AL Rookie of the Year (he finished fifth), because his 2.95 Win Probability Added was the highest of any rookie whose team reached the postseason. His bullpen mate Emmanuel Clase was deservedly named AL Reliever of the Year, but for a first-year player who grabbed the last spot on the Opening Day roster, Smith was incredible. In the regular season, Smith had a 1.91 ERA, a 0.90 WHIP and a 6.06 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 75 1/3 innings across 74 appearances. And in pitching all five games of the ALDS against the Tigers -- and only allowing one run in 6 1/3 innings, with appearances anywhere from the third through the seventh innings -- he was a major reason why the Guardians advanced to the ALCS."
MLB News,Are these 2 teams the most likely landing spots for Soto?,https://www.mlb.com/news/juan-soto-rumors,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 22:42:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and rumors surrounding Juan Soto. Nov. 30: Mets and Red Sox appear to be most likely landing spots for Soto (report)According to NJ.com Yankees reporter Randy Miller in an appearance on New York's WFAN Radio on Saturday, the Red Sox and Mets are the most likely landing spots for Soto, with the Blue Jays ""all in"" on the superstar slugger and the Yankees likely to ""finish fourth"" in the Soto sweepstakes. ""I think it's going to come down to the Red Sox and Mets,"" Miller said. ""From what I'm hearing, Big Papi [former Red Sox great David Ortiz] is playing a role in this and recruiting Soto hard. I heard [Soto] was very impressed with the Red Sox and the Red Sox are telling Soto that they're going to bring in a couple of extra players in addition to him. ... I think the Yankees, from what I hear, clearly they value him, but ... I don't think the Yankees will go $600 million. I'm hearing the Yankees will probably top out in the $550 million range."" Nov. 27: Yankees increase offer to Soto (report)The Soto sweepstakes appear to be entering the next round, with the Yankees upping their initial offer in recent days, per a report from MLB Network insider Jon Heyman. While Heyman wrote for the New York Post that the Yanks have also touched base with Corbin Burnes and Max Fried -- as well as some of the other top free agents -- he said New York has not yet extended an offer to either player. Instead, the Yankees' main focus for the time being remains on bringing back Soto. Though it's unclear exactly what New York's latest offer is -- or what the original numbers were -- the club has reportedly told Soto it is willing to include opt-outs in a potential contract. There will likely be other teams also willing to extend that luxury, with the Mets, Dodgers, Red Sox and Blue Jays remaining the most likely landing spots for Soto if he elects to leave the Bronx. Nov. 26: Soto's decision coming before the Winter Meetings?The 2024 Winter Meetings in Dallas begin on Dec. 9. An annual highlight on MLB's offseason calendar, there is usually a flurry of player movement during the four-day event. Some of the best free agents agree to their next contract during the Winter Meetings. But the best free agent this year might agree to his deal before the Meetings begin. A source told Sean McAdam of MassLive.com that there is a “very good” chance Soto selects his next team even before the start of the Winter Meetings. This jibes with what MLB.com's Mark Feinsand reported recently; he wrote that ""the feeling around the industry"" is Soto could make his decision before Dec. 9. Five teams have already made an offer to Soto, a source told MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi: the Mets, Red Sox, Dodgers, Yankees and Blue Jays. However, those are not believed to be final offers as Morosi clarified Tuesday. Morosi said he thinks there is a ""real possibility"" that a Soto signing comes in the early days of the Meetings. If it comes on that first day, it would be the same date (Dec. 9) that Shohei Ohtani made public his decision to sign with the Dodgers last year, although that came after the Meetings concluded. Nov. 26: Red Sox 'stepping up efforts' to sign Soto (report)The Red Sox are one of the five teams that have made a contract offer to Soto, a source told MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi. No one knows the value of that offer, but it shouldn't be taken lightly as Boston is reportedly ""stepping up efforts"" to land the offseason's No. 1 free agent. More > Nov. 26: Five teams submit offers to Soto (source)To this point, Soto's free agency has been about meeting with teams and hearing their general pitches -- but that has changed according to MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi, who reports that five teams have submitted contract offers to the 26-year-old superstar: the Red Sox, Dodgers, Mets, Yankees and Blue Jays. ESPN's Buster Olney reported over the weekend that contract offers were expected to begin rolling in this week. Juan Soto has offers from 5 teams, source confirms the report by @RandyJMiller.

Nov. 20: Soto has 'good meeting' with YankeesThe Yankees met with Soto on Monday in California, and team owner Hal Steinbrenner confirmed Wednesday that it was a ""good meeting"" with ""very honest back-and-forth dialogue."" Steinbrenner said that Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, manager Aaron Boone, president Randy Levine, and special assistant to the GM Omar Minaya were all in attendance during Monday's meeting. But he didn't divulge any part of the team's pitch to Soto or say if any offers were made during the meeting. ""It's been a priority,"" Steinbrenner said about signing Soto. ""We wouldn't have gone out to the West Coast if it wasn't. ... We'll be in the mix. I'll leave it at that."" As of Wednesday, Soto has had in-person meetings with the Yankees, Mets, Red Sox and Blue Jays. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Tuesday that Soto will also meet with the Phillies at some point. Soto also plans to sit down with the Dodgers this week, according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Steinbrenner said he has ""no idea"" if the Yankees will meet with Soto again or if he's confident that the club can re-sign the 26-year-old superstar. But he added, ""[W]e've got the ability to sign any player we want to sign."" Nov. 19: Phillies plan to meet with Soto (report)Yet another team has emerged as a potential suitor for Soto: the Philadelphia Phillies. According to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman, the Phils plan to meet with Soto at some point, though nothing has been scheduled yet. Soto reportedly has already met with the Blue Jays, Red Sox, Mets and incumbent Yankees and is scheduled to meet with the Dodgers next. Per Heyman, it's believed that no offers have been made to Soto yet. The Phillies already have one of the most complete rosters of any MLB team, but they are looking for ways to improve after failing to advance past the National League Division Series in 2024. Phillies ownership has shown a willingness to pay up for some of the top free agents on the market, with Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, Zack Wheeler, J.T. Realmuto, Aaron Nola, Nick Castellanos and Kyle Schwarber all signing lucrative deals with Philadelphia in free agency. Phillies managing partner and CEO John Middleton was candid in addressing Soto's market earlier this month, saying that he believes the outfielder wants to be in New York but adding that Philadelphia could get involved in the bidding anyway as a ""stalking horse."" Nov. 18: Cohen to best any Soto offer by $50 million (report)Yankees broadcaster Michael Kay said on his radio program on Monday that according to a source, Mets owner Steve Cohen is willing to beat any other club's offer to Soto by $50 million. ""I'll put it this way,"" Kay said. ""And I don't think this is something Yankees fans are going to want to hear. I don't think the Yankees are going to go [up to $700 million]. I don't. And then I've heard from somebody in baseball today that Cohen is willing to go $50 million over whatever anybody offers. So it looks like the Mets really want to get this guy."" Nov. 18: Dodgers expected to meet with Soto this weekSoto's decision on where to sign this offseason is the most anticipated in baseball, and according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, ""the feeling around the industry"" is that the decision could be made before the annual Winter Meetings get underway in Dallas on Dec. 9. Feinsand also writes that the Dodgers are expected to be the next team to meet with Soto, with plans to sit down with the superstar slugger sometime this week and perhaps as early as Tuesday. More > Nov. 18: Yanks meet with Soto (report)MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reports in an article for the New York Post that the Yankees met with superstar slugger Juan Soto in Southern California on Monday as they look to retain him after he helped lead them to the World Series. More > Nov 16: Blue Jays, Red Sox and Mets have met with Soto (reports)The Red Sox met with Soto and his representatives, including agent Scott Boras, in Southern California on Thursday night, according to a report from Sean McAdam of MassLive. It appears they aren't the only club that has chatted with the 26-year-old superstar. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Saturday morning that the Blue Jays, along with Boston, have made ""impressive in-person presentations"" to Soto. Heyman later added another team to the list, reporting that the Mets met with Soto on Saturday. He noted that ""all early signs suggest the meeting went extremely well,"" and that owner Steve Cohen and other ""high-ranking Mets officials"" made the trip. The Red Sox's meeting with Soto, which was of an introductory and informative nature, per McAdam, lasted for three hours and was deemed as “productive,” though neither money nor terms were discussed between the parties. Soto was reportedly “impressed” by Boston’s presentation, which included a video noting the franchise’s history of star players from the Dominican Republic, Soto’s native country. The Red Sox also detailed their plans for the future, highlighting a promising group of prospects who could potentially team up with Soto to help the club be successful in the years to come. Heyman reports that Soto is scheduled to meet with a fourth team, the Yankees, on Monday in California."

The Cardinals have reportedly put star third baseman Nolan Arenado on the trade market, and according to NJ.com's Randy Miller, both of this year's World Series participants might look to swing a deal for the eight-time All-Star and 10-time Gold Glove Award winner. ""One guy that could be a possibility [for the Yankees] is Arenado from St. Louis,"" Miller said on WFAN Radio on Saturday. ""I think the Cardinals are trying to trade him, St. Louis would have to pick up some of the money and maybe the Yankees could have a deal where they trade some prospects. ... I keep hearing it's going to be either the Yankees or the Dodgers -- I think he's a West Coast guy that would prefer to go to the Dodgers and I think the Dodgers want him."" According to NJ.com Yankees reporter Randy Miller in an appearance on New York's WFAN Radio on Saturday, the Red Sox and Mets are the most likely landing spots for Soto, with the Blue Jays ""all in"" on the superstar slugger and the Yankees likely to ""finish fourth"" in the Soto sweepstakes. More > The Blue Jays are reportedly one of five teams that have made an offer to superstar free agent Juan Soto, but they clearly aren’t putting all of their eggs in the Soto basket this offseason. With Toronto seen as a “dark horse, at best,” in the Soto sweepstakes, SportsNet’s Ben Nicholson-Smith reports that the club is showing interest in third baseman Alex Bregman, outfielder Anthony Santander, left-hander Max Fried and right-hander Luis Severino. This is a pivotal offseason for the Blue Jays, who are coming off a disappointing 2024 campaign. While Toronto moved a number of players at the Trade Deadline, the club opted to hold onto most of its top trade candidates with an eye on contending in 2025 -- the final year Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette are under club control. However, the team is likely going to need an influx of talent to do so after posting the fourth-worst record (74-88) in the American League last season. Blue Jays president Mark Shapiro said in early October that he was expecting the team’s 2025 payroll to be similar to what it was in 2024, when Toronto had an estimated Opening Day payroll of $225 million (per Cot’s Baseball Contracts). Including projected salaries for arbitration-eligible players, Cot’s puts Toronto’s current payroll at roughly $184 million, which could leave the team with around $41 million to spend. According to Nicholson-Smith, the Blue Jays could stretch beyond their budget “for a special or unique opportunity” such as Soto. Losing Blake Snell is tough for the Giants, but losing him to the Dodgers? That has to sting L.A.'s longtime rival. San Francisco now has a massive void to fill in its rotation. There are a handful of high-quality starting pitchers left on the free-agent market, and the Giants might look toward the very top of it to find their Snell replacement. According to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, the Giants ""are believed to have significant interest"" in Corbin Burnes. More > The Yankees increased their initial offer to Juan Soto in recent days, per a report from MLB Network insider Jon Heyman -- but they've also checked in on some other top free agents. Heyman wrote for the New York Post that the Yanks have also touched base with Corbin Burnes and Max Fried, though the club has not yet extended an offer to either player. More > The Red Sox are one of the five teams that have made a contract offer to Juan Soto, a source told MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi. No one knows the value of that offer, but it shouldn't be taken lightly as it seems like Boston means business in its pursuit of the offseason's No. 1 free agent. Writing in the New York Post on Tuesday, Mark W. Sanchez and MLB Network insider Jon Heyman said the Red Sox ""are increasingly seen as a legitimate contender in the sweepstakes for the generational slugger as word is they are stepping up efforts to lure the superstar hitter away from their historic AL East nemesis."" The Red Sox are also continuing their search for a frontline starter. Per a report from the Boston Globe (subscription required), the Red Sox are looking to add one even if they can seal the deal with Soto. According to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, the Red Sox were in on Blake Snell before he reached a five-year deal with the Dodgers on Tuesday. Boston is believed to be seeking a left-handed starter, so it could turn its focus to Max Fried now that Snell is off the market. The Red Sox are also a team to watch in the trade market for White Sox lefty Garrett Crochet. More > The Yankees and Red Sox are two of the top contenders in the Juan Soto sweepstakes, but might the two storied rivals also find themselves embroiled in a bidding war for another big-name free agent? MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand hears that the Yankees and Red Sox are both looking for a left-handed starter and were interested in Blake Snell before he reached a five-year, $182 million deal with the Dodgers on Tuesday. Feinsand suggests that New York and Boston could now zero in on Max Fried, the top remaining southpaw on the free-agent market. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. However, there's a lot of competition for Fried, especially now that Snell is off the board. Three of the Yankees' AL East rivals -- the Red Sox, Orioles and Blue Jays -- have also been connected to Fried, but they are far from the only teams looking for starters. The Dodgers have been considered the favorite by many to sign Sasaki once he is posted for MLB clubs. Even with Blake Snell joining the Dodgers, L.A.'s interest in the 23-year-old Japanese right-hander seemingly hasn't waned. During his Wednesday chat on Bleacher Report, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman indicated that the Dodgers remain involved for Sasaki. Yet there is one other team that has ""a true shot"" of signing him, according to Heyman: the Padres. More > Few contenders have a greater need for a top starting pitcher than the Orioles, who are at risk of losing Corbin Burnes to free agency. O’s general manager Mike Elias made it clear at the beginning of the offseason that the team’s new ownership group was enabling him to explore the market for frontline arms, though Burnes may wind up being out of the club’s price range. The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required) reported on Nov. 21 that the Orioles appeared “more focused” on other options than they were on bringing back Burnes. However, one of their reported targets, Blake Snell, is now off the market after reaching a five-year, $182 million deal with the Dodgers on Tuesday. While it’s possible Baltimore will pivot to the next best southpaw on the free-agent market, Max Fried, the club is also in the mix for some lower-cost alternatives. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi reports that Baltimore is interested in free agent Nathan Eovaldi, who is a tier below Fried but has performed like a frontline starter in the postseason and can likely be had on a shorter-term deal as he heads into his age-35 season. MLB Trade Rumors projects Eovaldi for a two-year, $44 million contract. Right-hander Jack Flaherty, who won the World Series with the Dodgers this year, could be another possible avenue for Baltimore. The Orioles could face competition for Eovaldi from Fried’s former team, the Braves. MLB.com’s Mark Bowman reported on Nov. 5 that the Braves had Eovaldi near the top of their offseason wish list, and Morosi hears that Atlanta still has interest in him. If the Orioles strike out in free agency, they could also look to the trade market to fill their need for an ace, with White Sox lefty Garrett Crochet a potential option. In the opinion of one National League executive who spoke to MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand, the Orioles are ""the team to watch on [Crochet], for sure."" Jack Flaherty was born and raised in Southern California. He grew up a Dodgers fan. He said during the team's 2024 World Series championship parade that he never wants to leave Los Angeles. But after the Dodgers agreed to a five-year deal with Blake Snell on Tuesday night, is re-signing Flaherty no longer an option for the reigning champs? MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi said Wednesday that the Snell move ""probably"" means Flaherty ""won't be back"" with the club in 2025. More > According to a report from The Athletic's Katie Woo (subscription required), the Cardinals have been exploring the potential trade market for third baseman Nolan Arenado over the past few weeks. Multiple teams have expressed interest thus far, and while talks haven’t yielded any substantive progress, there’s a “growing sense throughout the industry” that the 33-year-old will eventually be dealt. Discussions are likely to intensify as the Winter Meetings approach. Per Woo, Arenado is even open to playing more at first base to create roster flexibility for a potential new team, though it’s believed he would only be willing to waive his full no-trade clause to join a club set up to contend for multiple seasons. Arenado is coming off a down season with the bat (16 homers, 101 OPS+), but he was still worth 3.1 WAR (per FanGraphs) thanks in part to his plus defense at the hot corner. Arenado could be an attractive alternative to the top third-base options on the free-agent market -- Alex Bregman and Willy Adames, both of whom are expected to command a nine-figure deal and are tied to Draft compensation after declining a qualifying offer. Arenado has three years and $74 million left on his contract, but $10 million of that will be paid by the Rockies. Blake Snell is the first elite free agent to come off the board this offseason. The two-time Cy Young Award winner has agreed to a five-year, $182 million deal with the World Series champion Dodgers, a source told MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Feinsand also reported that the Yankees, Red Sox and Orioles were in on Snell before he agreed to join the Dodgers. The left-hander had also been linked to the Blue Jays and the Giants, for whom he pitched this past season. The good news for those teams? There are still a good number of impactful starting pitchers still available. That list is topped by Corbin Burnes and Max Fried, with many of the aforementioned clubs also interested in those two hurlers. Snell's addition may hint that the Dodgers are moving on from Jack Flaherty, but MLB Network insider Jon Morosi recently identified teams such as the Yankees, Padres and Angels as other possible landing spots for the 2024 world champion. Granted, Morosi's report came before the Angels reportedly came to terms on a three-year deal with lefty Yusei Kikuchi. A couple of Japanese pitchers -- 35-year-old Tomoyuki Sugano and 23-year-old Roki Sasaki -- are on many teams' radars. The Dodgers have long been considered one of the favorites to get Sasaki, although he isn't expected to sign with an MLB club until Jan. 15, when the 2025 international signing period begins. There are also trade possibilities out there for teams looking to upgrade their rotation. The most talked about candidate is White Sox left-hander Garrett Crochet, who has been linked to a bunch of clubs, including the Phillies, Dodgers, Orioles and Red Sox. To this point, Juan Soto's free agency has been about meeting with teams and hearing their general pitches -- but that has changed according to MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi, who reports that five teams have submitted contract offers to the 26-year-old superstar. Those teams are the Dodgers, Mets, Yankees and Blue Jays as well as the Red Sox, who are reportedly ""stepping up efforts"" to sign Soto. That is obviously a significant step in the process, especially since MLB.com's Mark Feinsand has said that ""the feeling around the industry"" is that Soto's decision could be made before the annual Winter Meetings get underway on Dec. 9 in Dallas. On Tuesday, Sean McAdam of MassLive.com also reported that there is a ""very good"" chance Soto's decision comes before the Meetings begin. More > The Phillies are among the teams interested in acquiring White Sox ace Garrett Crochet, and Alec Bohm could be one of the players heading to Chicago if a deal is struck, according to USA Today's Bob Nightengale. If the Phillies trade Bohm and create a void at third base, Nightengale adds that Philadelphia ""is expected to make a strong play"" for Alex Bregman or Willy Adames. Bregman has also drawn interest from the Tigers and Red Sox. Adames has spent his entire seven-year Major League career at shortstop and hasn't played third base since 2013, his first year as a pro. However, he is reportedly open to moving to the hot corner ""for the right deal and the right team,"" according to MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi. Morosi said Tuesday that the Astros are also interested in Adames as a third baseman. Houston would have a clear need at the position if it can't re-sign Bregman. Adames, who received some down-ballot MVP votes this year, has been a plus defender at shortstop over each of the past three seasons, judging by outs above average. His talent on both sides of the ball and apparent willingness to accommodate a team by moving to third base has created ""broad"" interest in the 29-year-old, per Morosi. The Angels have been the most aggressive club in free agency this offseason and kept it up with their first big splash, agreeing to terms with lefty Yusei Kikuchi early Monday on a three-year, $63 million deal, a source told MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Here is a breakdown of this move from all angles, via MLB.com experts. More > The Phillies and White Sox have discussed potential trade packages for left-handed ace Garrett Crochet that include Phillies All-Star third baseman Alec Bohm and highly touted outfield prospect Justin Crawford, per a report from USA Today's Bob Nightengale. More > The Braves could look to add an outfielder in free agency after non-tendering Ramón Laureano last week, Ken Rosenthal reports for The Athletic (subscription required). According to Rosenthal, the Braves would prefer a left-handed hitting outfielder, because their only current lefty bats are Michael Harris II, Jarred Kelenic, Matt Olson and switch-hitter Ozzie Albies. But they would also be willing to pursue a right-handed hitter. Even though Atlanta's outfield depth is currently thin, Rosenthal writes that the Braves don't necessarily need to go after one of the top-of-the-market outfielders -- Juan Soto, Anthony Santander, Teoscar Hernández and Jurickson Profar -- because Ronald Acuña Jr. is expected to return from his torn ACL a month or two into the 2025 season. The next tier of left-handed-hitting free-agent outfielders that the Braves could pursue includes Michael Conforto, Ben Gamel, Jason Heyward, Travis Jankowski, Max Kepler, David Peralta, Mike Tauchman, Alex Verdugo and Jesse Winker. Right-handed-hitting free-agent outfielders include Mark Canha, Randal Grichuk, Austin Hays, Connor Joe, Manuel Margot, Andrew McCutchen, Tyler O'Neill, Tommy Pham and Michael A. Taylor. The veteran first basemen on the free-agent market could be in demand among teams looking for a more affordable option than Pete Alonso or Christian Walker. The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal reports (subscription required) that the Pirates, Mariners, D-backs and Tigers all could be looking to upgrade at first base, but not for the price tag that Alonso and Walker will likely command. The Nationals could also join that list, although they still might pursue Alonso or Walker. Rosenthal believes that means there could be plenty of demand for first basemen like Paul Goldschmidt, Carlos Santana, Anthony Rizzo, Josh Bell and Justin Turner. The Tigers are interested in free-agent third baseman Alex Bregman, according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman in an article for the New York Post. Heyman adds that the only club Bregman has played for in the Major Leagues, the Astros, have submitted a contract offer in an effort to re-sign the two-time All-Star, and that the Red Sox have ""inquired and could be a fit for Bregman if they move Rafael Devers to first."" If Bregman was to sign with Detroit, it would reunite him with his former manager in Houston, A.J. Hinch. Hinch was the manager when Bregman and the Astros won the franchise's first World Series title in 2017. With Garrett Crochet headlining the list of potential trade candidates this offseason, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reports in the New York Post that four clubs -- the Orioles, Red Sox, Dodgers and Phillies -- are showing the most interest in acquiring the White Sox left-hander. More > Dodgers right-hander Walker Buehler threw the final pitch of this season at Yankee Stadium, closing out Game 5 of the World Series in the Bronx. Might Yankee Stadium also be where Buehler throws his first pitch in 2025? MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi has been told that there is ""some mutual interest"" between Buehler and the Yankees, who are looking to augment their starting rotation this offseason. More > The Royals and Reds completed a trade Friday headlined by former college teammates, right-handed pitcher Brady Singer and second baseman Jonathan India, heading in opposite directions. The Reds bolster their rotation with Singer, who pitched to a 3.71 ERA over a career-high 179 2/3 innings this season. India, the 2021 National League Rookie of the Year, addresses one of Kansas City's top priorities for this offseason: adding more offense. The Royals also received 25-year-old outfielder Joey Wiemer, who hasn't hit much in his limited time in the big leagues but did record eight outs above average while playing for the Brewers in 2023. The Red Sox are definitely one of the teams vying for Juan Soto. However, will this year's No. 1 free agent actually end up with Boston? MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi said Friday that he will be ""surprised"" if that happens. If Soto does sign elsewhere, the Red Sox will have to pivot to some of the other big bats on the market, and Morosi considers Boston to be one of the top candidates to sign Teoscar Hernández. More > Roki Sasaki isn't the only marquee Japanese pitcher who is expected to make the jump to the Majors this offseason. The 35-year-old Tomoyuki Sugano doesn't possess Sasaki's top-notch velocity, but as a two-time winner of the Sawamura Award -- the Japanese equivalent to the Cy Young Award -- Sugano should have his fair share of suitors. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi has identified two of them this week: the Angels and the Giants. More > Although outfielder/first baseman Cody Bellinger exercised his player option for 2025, it’s not a guarantee that he’ll be with the Cubs on Opening Day. According to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required), rival executives say that the Cubs want to trade the 29-year-old. More > MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said Wednesday that Sasaki is expected to be part of the 2025 international amateur signing class, which means the Japanese right-hander likely won't sign with a club before Jan. 15. ""It looks like ... the signing will happen in the new pool period,"" Manfred said via The Athletic's Evan Drelich. More > Thirteen players were tendered a qualifying offer (a one-year, $21.05 million deal for 2025) this offseason, but Reds right-hander Nick Martinez was the only one who accepted prior to Tuesday's 4 p.m. ET deadline. The following 12 players rejected the qualifying offer and will remain free agents: Since the system was implemented in 2012, only 14 players to receive a QO have accepted it.

MLB News,HOF slugger 'recruiting Soto hard' to sign with Red Sox (report),https://www.mlb.com/news/red-sox-rumors-latest-trades-and-signings,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 22:47:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of all the latest free-agent and trade rumors involving the Red Sox right here. Nov. 30: Big Papi 'recruiting Soto hard' for Red Sox (report)According to NJ.com Yankees reporter Randy Miller in an appearance on New York's WFAN Radio on Saturday, Red Sox legend David Ortiz is working hard to get superstar slugger Juan Soto to sign with Boston. Miller also said he thinks it'll be either the Red Sox or Mets that end up signing Soto. ""I think it's going to come down to the Red Sox and Mets,"" Miller said. ""From what I'm hearing, Big Papi is playing a role in this and recruiting Soto hard. I heard [Soto] was very impressed with the Red Sox and the Red Sox are telling Soto that they're going to bring in a couple of extra players in addition to him."" Nov. 27: Red Sox 'stepping up efforts' to sign Soto, also pursuing frontline arm (reports)The Red Sox are one of the five teams that have made a contract offer to Juan Soto, a source told MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi. No one knows the value of that offer, but it shouldn't be taken lightly as it seems like Boston means business in its pursuit of the offseason's No. 1 free agent. Writing in the New York Post on Tuesday, Mark W. Sanchez and MLB Network insider Jon Heyman said the Red Sox ""are increasingly seen as a legitimate contender in the sweepstakes for the generational slugger as word is they are stepping up efforts to lure the superstar hitter away from their historic AL East nemesis."" Boston has been linked to many of the top free agents during the early portion of the offseason, including starting pitchers Corbin Burnes and Max Fried as well as infielder Willy Adames and outfielder Teoscar Hernández. According to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, the Red Sox were also in on Blake Snell before he reached a five-year deal with the Dodgers on Tuesday. Boston is believed to be seeking a left-handed starter, so it could turn its focus to Fried now that Snell is off the market. Per a report from the Boston Globe (subscription required), the Red Sox are looking to add a top starter even if they can seal the deal with Soto. Signing Soto would leave them with less flexibility to do so, though CEO/president Sam Kennedy said last week that the Red Sox are open to pushing their payroll beyond the first Competitive Balance Tax threshold of $241 million. Including projected salaries for arbitration-eligible players, Cot's Baseball Contracts puts the Red Sox CBT number at roughly $164 million -- $77 million shy of the first tax threshold. If Boston does end up getting priced out of the market for the elite free-agent arms, the club could pursue a trade to fill its need for an ace. In Morosi's view, the Red Sox are a team to watch in the trade market for White Sox lefty Garrett Crochet. Boston is loaded with highly touted position-player prospects, which could make it an attractive trade partner for the White Sox. Nov. 22: Red Sox considered a top candidate for Teoscar if they don't sign SotoThe Red Sox are definitely one of the teams vying for Juan Soto. However, will this year's No. 1 free agent actually end up with Boston? MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi said Friday that he will be ""surprised"" if that happens. If Soto does sign elsewhere, the Red Sox will have to pivot to some of the other big bats on the market, and Morosi considers Boston to be one of the top candidates to sign Teoscar Hernández. ""If Juan Soto goes somewhere else ... get ready to listen to a lot of conversation about Teoscar and the Boston Red Sox,"" Morosi said during Friday's edition of Hot Stove. The 32-year-old Hernández is coming off a fantastic season with the Dodgers, highlighted by a career-high 33 home runs. That was his first season in the National League after eight years in the American League. During that time, Hernández posted strong numbers as a visitor in Fenway Park: That includes 14 home runs in 170 at-bats and a .282/.344/.606 slash line. Morosi considers the incumbent Dodgers as another top candidate for Hernández and said the Orioles may be interested in him as well. Last week, ESPN's Jeff Passan reported (subscription required) that the Dodgers are the ""favorites"" to bring back Hernández while also including the Red Sox, O's and Yankees as contenders. Nov 15: Soto has 'productive' 3-hour meeting with Red Sox (report)The Red Sox met with Soto and his representatives, including agent Scott Boras, in Southern California on Thursday night, according to a report from Sean McAdam of MassLive. The meeting, which was of an introductory and informative nature, lasted for three hours and was deemed as “productive,” though neither money nor terms were discussed between the parties. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Soto was reportedly “impressed” by Boston’s presentation, which included a video noting the franchise’s history of star players from the Dominican Republic, Soto’s native country. The Red Sox also detailed their plans for the future, highlighting a promising group of prospects who could potentially team up with Soto to help the club be successful in the years to come. Soto is expected to continue to meet with more teams in Southern California over the next few days."
MLB News,1 team at each position most in need of an upgrade,https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-team-that-can-make-offseason-move-at-each-position,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 01:34:44 GMT",,"Brian Murphy The offseason is a time for reflection and evaluation as clubs do a full inventory of their rosters and look for ways to be better in the year ahead. Front offices scour the free-agent and trade markets, aiming to improve at any spot on the field. No team is singularly focused on improving at just one position. But for this article, we're playing a little bit of matchmaker, highlighting one team at each position -- including three outfield spots -- where an offseason addition is vital. Note: While it would be easy to say that the Orioles need to upgrade their starting rotation or that the Astros have a hole to fill at third base, we've tried wherever possible to stay away from position-team pairings where the obvious solution would be re-signing a player that team had during the 2024 season. Catcher: RaysThere isn't a glut of game-changing options readily available at catcher this winter; Kyle Higashioka is the top player available at the position in free agency. But upgrading this position is a priority for the Rays, according to president of baseball operations Erik Neander. Tampa Bay has ranked inside the bottom 10 in catcher OPS in each of the past three seasons. Ben Rortvedt was the club's leading backstop in 2024, and he produced a .228/.317/.303 slash line over 328 plate appearances. The Rays will concentrate on adding offense wherever possible this offseason after scoring the second-fewest runs in MLB and finishing with a sub-.500 record for the first time since 2017. But there should be greater emphasis paid to fixing this long-standing weak point. First base: AstrosThe Astros may be most focused on bringing back third baseman Alex Bregman, but they have had a glaring issue on the opposite corner of the diamond for the previous couple of years. Outside of a five-week hot streak at the end of the 2023 season, José Abreu didn't make much of an impact with Houston. He owned a .362 OPS through 120 plate appearances before he was released in mid-June. Jon Singleton received the majority of the reps at first from that point, but his inability to hit left-handed pitching (.457 OPS in 82 PA this season) leaves him best suited as more of a platoon bat who can excel against righties. Second base: MarinersIt's been seven years since Seattle's second basemen logged an OPS of .700 or better. The club thought it had solved its woes at the start of this year with Jorge Polanco, but the veteran hit .213 with a .651 OPS and a career-worst 29.3% strikeout rate while being dogged by a left knee injury. The Mariners declined his $12 million option for 2025, leaving them searching for an answer again at the keystone position. The solution may come from overseas; the Mariners are reportedly interested in Hyeseong Kim, who has been one of the best hitters in the KBO in recent years. The 25-year-old second baseman said earlier this week that he expects to be posted for MLB teams soon. Shortstop: BravesOrlando Arcia, a 2023 All-Star, is penciled in as Atlanta's starting shortstop for 2025, but since appearing in that Midsummer Classic, he has batted .228 with a .652 OPS. His 78 wRC+ over that span is tied for third-worst in the Majors. By run value, Arcia was the least valuable batter in the big leagues this season. It's no wonder Atlanta is one of many teams linked to top free-agent shortstop Willy Adames. The Braves' lineup can still be one of the best in the Majors when it's at full strength, but that strength could be stronger if Atlanta addresses this position. Third base: BrewersIf the Brewers don't re-sign Adames, they can either replace him with a shortstop from outside the organization or shift one of their in-house infielders over to short. We'll assume they go with the latter choice and plug in third baseman Joey Ortiz, who spent most of his college career and his time in the Orioles' Minor League system as a shortstop. However, filling one position creates questions about another. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Oliver Dunn is a possible option at the hot corner, but the 27-year-old ended his injury-shortened rookie season with a .598 OPS. Manager Pat Murphy said that moving Sal Frelick to third base ""is on the table, for sure."" But no qualified hitter packed less of a punch at the plate than Frelick this year. He registered a 19.5% hard-hit rate and a 0.8% barrel rate (three barrels in 400 batted balls). Perhaps Milwaukee's most impactful third baseman isn't on the roster yet. Outfield: Blue JaysNot every team with a flaw in its outfield can go get Juan Soto, but the Blue Jays are reportedly one of the five teams that have extended a contract offer to the 26-year-old superstar. Of course, there is fierce competition for the No. 1 free agent, so Toronto won't put all its eggs in a single basket. The Blue Jays ranked 23rd or worse in OPS at each of the three outfield spots. Collectively, their outfielders put up a 26% strikeout rate, tied for fifth-highest in the Majors. They also had a .210/.283/.362 slash line. To put it another way: 30th in MLB/29th in MLB/28th in MLB. Outfield: PhilliesThe Phillies have been mentioned in recent rumors regarding White Sox left-handed pitcher Garrett Crochet. Maybe bolstering their already great rotation with another ace is what will finally lift the Phillies to their first World Series title since 2008. They have been knocking on the door for a few years, only to be left empty-handed in October. Yet there is a more obvious need in the outfield, where general manager Dave Dombrowski has suggested that Nick Castellanos and Brandon Marsh are locked into starting roles. The Phils were offensively anemic in center field this season (.353 slugging percentage, 80 wRC+), although they could choose to put Marsh back in center for the majority of the time and take a shot on a corner-outfield slugger such as switch-hitter Anthony Santander. Outfield: RoyalsAdding offense is a must for the Royals, who scored 15 runs in their six postseason games. They landed their next leadoff hitter when they traded for infielder Jonathan India about 10 days ago. Kansas City should turn its attention from the dirt to the grass at some point this winter. Royals outfielders compiled a .648 OPS and hit 47 home runs, fifth-fewest in the big leagues. Even though their starting trio from 2024 -- Hunter Renfroe, Kyle Isbel and MJ Melendez -- are all under contract, the club's search for upgrades could be a wide one after that group slashed .221/.284/.386 across 1,249 plate appearances while playing the outfield. Designated hitter: D-backsThis stresses how important Joc Pederson and Randal Grichuk were to Arizona's offensive success this season. Pederson produced a career-best 151 wRC+ while Grichuk batted .310 with an .899 OPS as a designated hitter. They combined for a .276/.378/.517 slash line across 487 plate appearances at DH, helping Arizona lead the Majors in runs scored. D-backs designated hitters had 3.3 FanGraphs WAR, tied for the fourth-most in MLB. But with Pederson and Grichuk now free agents, FanGraphs projects Arizona will be tied for 24th in designated hitter WAR next season (0.6). Between that duo and free-agent first baseman Christian Walker, the D-backs' lineup could look quite different in '25. Starting pitcher: GuardiansA bevy of postseason contenders will be eying the starting pitching market this offseason. That includes the reigning AL Central champions. The Guardians basically ended the season with two reliable starters: Tanner Bibee and Ben Lively. Bibee began the season as Cleveland's No. 3 starter, but injuries to Triston McKenzie and staff leader Shane Bieber, among others, effectively turned the 25-year-old Bibee into the Guardians' ace. Lively was a pleasant surprise in his age-32 season, but he was the only other Cleveland starter who pitched at least 105 innings. Now, Bieber, Matthew Boyd and Alex Cobb are free agents, and the franchise must find ways to lessen the burden on its world-class bullpen. Relief pitcher: CubsThe Cubs made a significant bullpen move recently, acquiring right-hander Eli Morgan, one of the top arms from that aforementioned Guardians 'pen. But there is more work to do. The Cubs lost 11 games this year when leading after the seventh inning -- tied for the most in the National League -- and had a 59.4% save rate. Only four teams converted a lower percentage of their save opportunities. The cupboard isn't bare here; Porter Hodge and Luke Little look like a couple of young building blocks for this squad. But experience is in short supply. Morgan and Keegan Thompson are the only relievers on the Cubs' 40-man roster who have thrown at least 200 innings in MLB. No one has thrown 300."
MLB News,Artwork commemorating Jeter's greatest moments unveiled at Art Miami,https://www.mlb.com/news/derek-jeter-art-collection-unveiled-at-art-miami,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 22:28:43 GMT",,"Christina De Nicola MIAMI -- “The Swing” and “The Jump” are synonymous with Hall of Famer Derek Jeter, and now they’ve been immortalized in a collection of artworks titled JETER. Jeter and artist Russell Young hand-selected and reimagined the two images into 12 large-scale paintings -- six of each portrait -- to go along with a variety of works hand-signed by Jeter and created in Young’s signature style of screen printing finished with “Diamond Dust.” First featured on Oct. 24 at Taglialatella Galleries in New York, the collection will be displayed from Dec. 3-8 at Art Miami. A portion of the proceeds generated from the artworks will be donated to Jeter’s Turn 2 Foundation and to the Perry J. Cohen Foundation. “When we look at the overall sports world, all the great legends and champions have dabbled in the art world a little bit with their image being utilized, but not everyone has had their image commemorated with a real artist, so to speak,” said Nick Korniloff, the executive vice president and director of Art Miami. “These works are unique in the sense that each one is an individual piece of art that has their own color on distinction hand touched by the artist, signed by the athlete, Derek, and also the artist, and they're also authenticated by MLB.” Earlier this year, MLB wanted to pursue the project but didn't know which artist to choose. It was the relationship between Daniel Crosby and MLB front office members, executives and staffers that put the idea in motion. Crosby got into the sport art and collectible memorabilia market in Los Angeles in the mid-1990s, even opening galleries in both the Dodgers’ and Angels’ ballparks. So late this spring, Crosby invited them to Young’s exhibit. “‘You want it to become art and not fan prints, right?’” Young recalled his manager Crosby telling MLB. “‘You want to elevate it into the art world. This elevates it into being art.’” Young began his career as a photographer and visual artist before directing music videos and photographing musicians like Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan and George Michael. He then applied his skills to silkscreen printing on paper, canvas and linen, harnessing the “Diamond Dust” technique originally invented by Andy Warhol in the 1980s, and becoming a household name in pop art. MLB was convinced, but Crosby died over the summer from a massive heart attack and the project nearly fell apart. His tragic passing motivated the group to see it through. A day after returning from his honeymoon, Young flew to New York to meet Jeter and gifted him a similar piece of art he had done of legendary soccer player Pelé. Though Young is from Northern England and Jeter grew up in Kalamazoo, Mich., they bonded over their humble beginnings and love of their three children. Young’s move across the pond overlapped with the Yankees’ Jeter-led dynasty that birthed five World Series championships. As fate would have it, Young experienced the 2000 Subway Series’ postgame celebrations because of his friendships with actor Mark Consuelos and then-Yankees third-base coach Willie Randolph. Over the course of an hour, Young and Jeter settled on the two images for the collection: His home run swing from Game 4 of the 2000 World Series and his signature jump throw. “We were both laser sharp on the images we wanted to do, and he trusted me, trusted me 100 percent,” Young said. “He wasn't second-guessing me or anything.” A post shared by TAG NYC (@taglialatellagalleries) After that meeting, Young and Brian Swarts from Taglialatella collaborated on the names for the custom-mixed colors, incorporating Jeter’s background with titles like “Kalamazoo Blue” and “November Blue.” Upwards of nine people assisted Young in the studio for the process of hand pulling the “Diamond Dust” while crawling across the floor. He calls it no different from what people do with T-shirts but on a bigger scale. Young would return to New York three times for a month’s worth of work before the art was finished. Then last month, the collection debuted. The response was palpable. “What's great is, you see people's eyes, and you watch them look at the work,” Young said. “It only takes one person like that for it all to be worth it. Just their eyes light up. They can't believe what they're seeing, and then people come up with stories: ‘Oh, my dad took me when … Oh, I went here … I was at that game.’ It was a really nice connection.” Even more baseball and art lovers will get a chance to see the collection at Art Miami, which is the leading international contemporary and modern art fair showcasing artworks of the 20th and 21st centuries in collaboration with a selection of the world's most-respected galleries. Anywhere from 70,000-80,000 people travel from across the globe to attend.

We're a very community-based organization.

MLB News,What does Soto's future hold? Let's look to the past to find out,https://www.mlb.com/news/juan-soto-projection-scenarios-for-new-deal,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 03:08:48 GMT",,"Thomas Harrigan Juan Soto is headed for one of the largest contracts in baseball history, perhaps even approaching the $700 million in guaranteed money that Shohei Ohtani got from the Dodgers last offseason, if some projections are to be believed. Ohtani, you might remember, is both a hitter and a pitcher. Soto just hits. But hitters this young and this good simply don’t hit the open market very often, if ever. In fact, there haven’t been many hitters with this statistical résumé through the age of 25, period. MLB offseason signings and trades• Latest free-agent and trade rumors• Top 25 free agents | Every free agent, by position• Tracking every team's offseason moves• FA guides: Soto | Burnes | Alonso | Bregman | Fried | Santander• Offseason dates, rules & terms explained Here are some of Soto’s key offensive stats during his seven-year career, which has included four All-Star selections, five Silver Sluggers, a World Series championship, a batting title and four top-six finishes in his league’s MVP voting: 936 games4,088 plate appearances.285/.421/.532 slash160 OPS+201 HR769 BB Even having that much big-league experience through an age-25 season is a rarity. Only 16 players have amassed at least 4,000 PAs by that point. When you actually factor in his performance, the list of comps gets even smaller. Just nine players have reached the 200 homer plateau by the end of their age-25 season. Five of those players did so with an OPS+ of 160 or higher: Soto, Mickey Mantle, Mike Trout, Jimmie Foxx and Albert Pujols. The number of players with at least 200 homers and 700 walks through the age of 25? Just one. Soto. In other words, direct comps for a hitter of this age and caliber are hard to come by. However, if we loosen the criteria just a bit, we can find some hints that might help in determining how Soto’s bat will age. THE PLAYER POOL We wanted to find players with a similar statistical profile to Soto who also achieved success at a young age, prioritizing power (HR), patience (BB) and overall performance at the plate (OPS+). It’s not an exact science, but it’s not meant to be. The point here is to look to the past for some rough context about what the future might hold for Soto. To that end, we turned to Baseball-Reference’s Stathead for a list of retired hitters who debuted after integration (1947) and reached each of the following thresholds through their age-25 seasons: 100 HR200 BB140 OPS+ Given those parameters, there are 18 potential comps, and the stature of the players on this list lets us know we’re on the right track. Of the 18 players, nine are in the Hall of Fame: Mantle, Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Frank Robinson, Ken Griffey Jr., Frank Thomas, Reggie Jackson, Eddie Mathews and Orlando Cepeda. Two others -- Pujols and Miguel Cabrera -- are likely to be first-ballot inductees when they’re eligible. Another, Dick Allen, has a chance to make it on this year’s Classic Era Ballot. And three more would be surefire Hall of Famers if not for their connection to PEDs: Alex Rodriguez, Mark McGwire and Manny Ramirez. Rounding out the group are Prince Fielder, Darryl Strawberry and Rocky Colavito, each of whom earned at least six All-Star selections. Every one of these 18 players continued to perform at a high level through their age-29 season. All but one had an OPS+ of 143 or higher from the ages of 26-29, and the lone exception still posted a 130 OPS+. Looking at the group’s median value, here is how these players fared on a per-season basis in that span: 664 PA, 37 HR, 155 OPS+, 6.6 WAR Unsurprisingly, there was some level of decline as these players moved into their 30s. Overall, though, the group’s performance remained strong from the ages of 30-33. Its median performance per season in that span looked like this: 620 PA, 29 HR, 153 OPS+, 5.1 WAR The ages of 33-35 is where we begin to see a steeper dropoff, not just in performance but also availability. Only seven of our 18 players averaged at least 550 plate appearances per season from the ages of 33-35. Five averaged fewer than 400 PAs, and one didn’t play after his age-32 campaign due to injury. Here’s how the group performed on a per-season basis in that span, once again looking at its median value: 507 PA, 25 HR, 131 OPS+, 3.1 WAR Of course, there’s a lot of variation here. Below, we’ll break up these 18 hitters into four general categories, based on how they performed from the ages of 26-35. Soto’s new contract is expected to be longer than 10 years, but we’re focusing on that timeframe. If Soto’s next 10 years look anything like his first seven, any value he provides beyond his age-35 season will be an added bonus. The dream scenario: Mays (390 HR, 166 OPS+ from ages 26-35), Aaron (375 HR, 162 OPS+), Robinson (301 HR, 163 OPS+), Ramirez (381 HR, 160 OPS+) The first two names in this group speak for themselves, with Mays and Aaron undoubtedly deserving mention in any conversation about the top five players in MLB history, thanks to their incredible combination of skill, consistency and longevity. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. As a contemporary of Mays and Aaron, Robinson tends to fly under the radar a bit among the legends of the sport, but he had a remarkable career in his own right. The right-handed slugger was the first player to win an MVP Award in both leagues, with the second of those coming after he earned the AL Triple Crown at age 30 in 1966. That was one of five top-four finishes Robinson logged in his league’s MVP voting during the timeframe in question, doing so in his age-26, -28, -30, -33 and -35 seasons. While Mays, Aaron and Robinson all made the Hall of Fame on their first ballot, Cooperstown has thus far eluded Ramirez due to a pair of positive PED tests late in his career. On a statistical level, though, he ranks among greatest right-handed hitters ever. Ramirez recorded at least 33 homers, 102 RBIs and a .976 OPS in every season from the ages of 26-34. The very good scenario: Mantle (311 HR, 173 OPS+ from ages 26-35), McGwire (405 HR, 173 OPS+), Cabrera (290 HR, 158 OPS+), Thomas (314 HR, 156 OPS+), Pujols (359 HR, 155 OPS+), Jackson (293 HR, 151 OPS+), Rodriguez (388 HR, 147 OPS+) On a rate-stats basis, Mantle remained one of the most productive hitters in the game as he aged, posting a 165 OPS+ in his final seven seasons. However, he missed a lot of time due to injuries once he hit his 30s, averaging just 118 games played with 24 homers per season from 30-35 and retiring after his age-36 campaign. Cabrera, Pujols and A-Rod each followed a similar trajectory, stacking up outstanding seasons in their late 20s and early 30s before beginning to decline. From the ages of 26-32, the average season among those three players was 39 homers with a 163 OPS+, and they combined to win seven MVPs in that time. From 33-35? An average of 24 homers per year with a 125 OPS+. It appeared to be going the same way for Thomas, who played just 20 games in his age-33 season and produced 28 homers with a 119 OPS+ the following year, a far cry from his average of 34 home runs with a 164 OPS+ from 26-32. But Thomas rebounded in his age-35 campaign, recording 42 homers, 105 RBIs and a 146 OPS+ over 153 games. Jackson's production from 26-32 was a level below those four, as he averaged 30 homers per year with a 151 OPS+ in that span, but he also didn’t experience a steep decline as he approached his mid-30s. In fact, his OPS+ from the ages of 33-35 held steady at 151. McGwire is a unique case in this group, as he actually had his best seasons after turning 30. The imposing slugger went deep 245 times (61 HR per year) with a 189 OPS+ from 32-35, including a then-record 70 dingers in 1998. McGwire notched a stellar 154 OPS+ from 26-31, though he averaged just 27 home runs per season in that time, missing significant time due to injuries from 1993-95. The mixed-bag scenario: Allen (257 HR, 157 OPS+ from ages 26-35), Griffey (347 HR, 142 OPS+), Mathews (287 HR, 137 OPS+) Although his lifetime 156 OPS+ puts him on par with many of the greats mentioned above, Allen has continued to fall short of the Hall of Fame due to his deficit in the counting-stats department, producing 1,848 hits and 351 homers. Allen averaged 32 homers and 97 RBIs per year with a 164 OPS+ from the ages of 26-30, a stretch that concluded with an AL MVP season in 1972. However, he played just 458 games and recorded 80 homers over the rest of his career, dealing with frequent injuries in that time. He retired after his age-35 campaign in 1977. The late slugger will have another opportunity to make the Hall as part of the 2025 Classic Era Ballot. Griffey was a first-ballot Hall of Famer who finished with 630 homers, but he’s still considered one of baseball’s greatest “what-ifs,” with injuries undermining what could have been an even more prolific career. Griffey had 40 or more home runs in every season from age 26-30, but he produced 98 homers combined over 445 games from 31-35. Similarly, Mathews’ best years came before his 30th birthday, and his offensive production sharply declined from 32-35 (115 OPS+). The Hall of Fame third baseman reached the 30-homer plateau in nine straight years from the ages of 21-29, but did so just once after that. The disappointing scenario: Strawberry (161 HR, 131 OPS+ from ages 26-35), Fielder (129 HR, 131 OPS+), Cepeda (187 HR, 129 OPS+), Colavito (245 HR, 127 OPS+) It’s tough to compare Soto to Strawberry, whose career was derailed by substance-abuse issues. Strawberry appeared in just 335 games after his 30th birthday. Ditto for Soto and Fielder, who retired after his age-32 season due to a neck injury. Cepeda played until he was 37 years old and was voted into the Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1999, but his candidacy largely hinged on what he did in his 20s. The Puerto Rico native’s production took a downward turn following his NL MVP Award-winning season at age 29, as the knee problems that he dealt with off and on throughout his career began to take their toll. He averaged just 18 home runs per year with a 118 OPS+ from 30-35. Colavito had some huge seasons early in his career, averaging 35 homers annually with a 138 OPS+ from the ages of 24-31, a stretch that included a trio of 40-homer campaigns. However, the end of the line came quickly for the outfielder, who played just two more years (101 OPS+) after his final All-Star season at age 32. Overall: While no two players are the same, it bodes well for Soto’s future outlook that we can count 11 of the 18 comps as successes. Even the players that would be categorized as question marks still had their moments -- especially before turning 30 -- with three winning an MVP Award during the timeframe in question. It should also be noted that injuries (or other off-the-field circumstances) were a prevailing theme among the players in the latter two groups. If Soto stays healthy, it's not hard to imagine his next contract going down as a free-agent success story, no matter how large it ends up being."
MLB News,Playoff hero Edman re-ups with Dodgers for five years,https://www.mlb.com/news/tommy-edman-dodgers-deal,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 01:18:00 GMT",,"Juan Toribio LOS ANGELES -- Before acquiring Tommy Edman in a three-team deal in July, the Dodgers had been pursuing the superutility man for years. Now, they made sure Edman won’t get away for the foreseeable future. Edman and the Dodgers agreed to a five-year, $74 million extension, the club announced on Friday. Multiple sources confirmed to MLB.com that the deal runs through the 2029 season with a club option in '30. Edman, who had been signed through 2025 with a two-year, $16.5 million deal from the Cardinals, will receive a $17 million signing bonus. Over the last couple months of the 2024 season, Edman quickly inserted himself as an integral part of the Dodgers’ World Series team. Edman’s versatility proved beneficial, slotting in at center field and shortstop when needed. Dodgers, UTIL Tommy Edman reportedly agree to five-year extension with a sixth-year club option, per multiple reports including https://t.co/Z3s2EpgF39's @juanctoribio. pic.twitter.com/466nyPr5FC Offensively, Edman also surpassed expectations. With some mechanical changes, the switch-hitter posted an .829 OPS with six home runs and six stolen bases in the first 29 games with Los Angeles. That only got better in the postseason, where he hit .328 with two homers and five stolen bases. Edman had a 1.022 OPS in the National League Championship Series against the Mets, earning him Most Valuable Player honors in the NLCS. After winning a World Series, the Dodgers are now committed to put together a core group of players that can help them continue their success. The Dodgers wasted no time this offseason, landing top free-agent target Blake Snell to a five-year, $182 million deal on Monday and now extending Edman to a long-term deal. With Mookie Betts and Gavin Lux in the infield, Edman will likely see the majority of his time in center field next season. Of course, if the Dodgers have some injuries, Edman is more than capable of sliding in as the everyday shortstop, which turned out to be the case down the stretch last season. The Dodgers have leaned on utilitymen in the past, as Chris Taylor and Kiké Hernández were both key pieces of the roster for multiple seasons. But with Taylor on the last year of his current contract and Hernández a free agent, the Dodgers were able to lock up their newest utilityman on Friday."
MLB News,The two skills that make Adames a top free-agent target,https://www.mlb.com/news/willy-adames-power-and-defense-make-him-a-top-free-agent,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 01:38:02 GMT",,"David Adler Willy Adames is the MLB version of a 3-and-D player in the NBA. That's a good thing. It's what makes Adames the most valuable shortstop in the 2024-25 free agent class. The 29-year-old is a homer-and-glove star. Adames has an important two-pronged skill set -- he belts home runs in the middle of the order, and he's a strong fielder at shortstop. It's the same principle that makes 3-and-D players so valuable in basketball: They hit the most valuable shots, three-pointers, and they provide high-level defense on the other end. Adames provides the most valuable kind of hits, home runs, and plays a high-level shortstop, a premier defensive position. Every MLB team needs players like that. That's why you shouldn't worry that Adames is only around a .250 career hitter. Adames' power/defense profile is what made him a key cog on multiple Brewers playoff teams during his Milwaukee tenure, and it's what's going to generate the demand for him this winter. Adames' emergence as a home run-and-defense player began with his first full season with the Brewers in 2022, and has continued through 2024. He's established a track record. Over these last three seasons, Adames has hit 87 home runs, and he has a +20 Fielding Run Value -- that's Statcast's overall measure of how many runs he's prevented with his fielding. He's been one of the top shortstops in the Majors in both categories. It's not just that Adames stands out among shortstops, though. He's in the top tier of power-and-glove players in the big leagues, regardless of position. Let's take a look at Adames' combination of those two tools, using Statcast's flagship metric for each: Barrels for power, and Outs Above Average for glove. At the plate, Adames has 154 barrels over the last three seasons. Barrels are balls hit with both ideal exit velocity and ideal launch angle, the type of contact most likely to be a home run, or at least an extra-base hit. Adames is one of only 22 hitters with at least 150 barrels since 2022, and he has out-barreled a lot of MLB's superstar sluggers over that time. In the field, Adames has been worth +26 Outs Above Average over the last three seasons. OAA measures how many outs an infielder or outfielder saves for his defense, based on the difficulty of all the plays he converts (or misses). Adames is one of only 25 fielders with at least +25 Outs Above Average since 2022, a group that includes plenty of Gold Glovers. And when you combine those two sides of Adames' game, the list of players who can match him is short. Players with 150+ barrels and 25+ OAA since 2022 Julio Rodríguez is close, with 147 barrels and a +28 OAA. Bobby Witt Jr. could have been there (he has 178 barrels and a +18 OAA), if he hadn't struggled so badly in the field as a rookie in 2022. But with those criteria, it's Adames, Lindor and Walker, and that's it. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Even if you lower the thresholds -- let's say, a minimum of 100 barrels and +10 Outs Above Average -- the group is still small. And it's still a select group of the best power-glove players. There are 17 players in that 100 barrel/+10 OAA group over the last three seasons. Here's how they break down by position. First basemen Second basemen Third basemen Shortstops Outfielders All of those players are worth having on your team. They're worth having in the lineup, and they're worth having in the field. But only two are free agents -- Adames and Walker. And those two aren't just free agents, they're two of the top free-agent position players, because of the specific phases of the game where they excel. The team that signs Adames is going to get homers, and it's going to get solid up-the-middle infield defense. Adames is a specialist in his two key areas. And he's the type of specialist plenty of teams will want."
MLB News,Snell agrees to 5-year deal with Dodgers,https://www.mlb.com/news/blake-snell-dodgers-deal,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 22:03:00 GMT",,"Juan Toribio LOS ANGELES -- The Dodgers’ priority this winter was to add an ace to their starting rotation. They got their man on Tuesday. Blake Snell, a two-time Cy Young Award winner and one of the top free-agent pitchers on the market this offseason, has agreed to a five-year, $182 million deal with the World Series champions, the club formally announced Saturday. A post shared by Blake Snell (@snellzilla4) Before Snell signed a two-year, $62 million deal with the Giants with an opt-out clause in March, the Dodgers were one of the teams to make a last-minute effort to acquire the star left-hander. Los Angeles checked in on Snell again before the Trade Deadline as San Francisco fell out of postseason contention. Since then, the Dodgers identified Snell as their top target this winter. The two sides engaged in discussions once free agency opened this month. The deal features a hefty $52 million signing bonus and includes deferred money, something that has become more common throughout the game, especially with the Dodgers. By joining Los Angeles, Snell is reunited with president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman, who was the executive vice president of baseball operations for the Rays when the lefty was drafted in the first round by Tampa Bay in 2011. Snell joins a starting rotation that will feature Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow and Shohei Ohtani. The Dodgers look to add another starter this winter, with Japanese phenom Roki Sasaki among the many targets. It’s a starting rotation that is expected to be much improved from last season. Since the 2018 season, not many pitchers have been more dominant at times than Snell. The left-hander reached free agency for the first time a year ago after posting an MLB-leading 2.25 ERA with 234 strikeouts over 180 innings as a member of the Padres in 2023. He was recognized as the National League’s top arm, earning his second career Cy Young Award and becoming just the seventh pitcher in Major League history to win the award in both leagues. He also won with the Rays in 2018. Snell’s 11.2 career strikeouts per nine innings is the highest in MLB history. After signing well into March and feeling rushed to start the season, Snell struggled at the start of 2024. Without a regular Spring Training buildup, Snell posted a 9.51 ERA over his first six starts and made two trips to the injured list. But once he got a proper buildup following his second IL stint, Snell continued to dominate on the mound. He put together a remarkable stretch with a 1.23 ERA and 114 strikeouts, 30 walks and a .123 batting average in 80 1/3 innings over his final 14 starts. His season peaked on Aug. 2, when he struck out 11 in a no-hitter against the Reds that was also the first complete game of his career. Perhaps most importantly for Los Angeles, Snell has proven that his stuff plays in October. Snell’s most famous postseason start came against the Dodgers in Game 6 of the 2020 World Series when he was pulled after 5 1/3 dominant innings. The Dodgers rallied for a 3-1 victory once Snell came out of the game en route to their first title since 1988. Now, with Snell in the mix, the Dodgers put themselves in position to become the first repeat World Series champions in more than two decades."
MLB News,5 Black Friday blockbuster trades that need to happen,https://www.mlb.com/news/proposing-blockbuster-black-friday-trades-2024,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024 01:26:38 GMT",,"Anthony Castrovince This is not a time for small helpings, folks. If you’re like me and went for that second, third or fourth(?) plate loaded with turkey and stuffing (no vegetables, that’s gross), then surely you can join me in appreciating an unhealthy helping of fake trade ideas. Every year on this day, I dream up blockbuster deals. Which means every year on this day, I am flooded with e-mails and social media reactions about how moronic I am. That’s the cost of dreaming big, and it’s one I’m willing to pay (thank you, mute button). What follows are not small swap proposals. These are bigger barters involving Major Leaguers going both ways. Because that’s where the fun is. So let’s once again fake a deal! (All prospect rankings come from MLB Pipeline.) 1) From north of the border to the North SideCubs get: 1B Vladimir Guerrero Jr., RHP Kevin GausmanBlue Jays get: 1B Michael Busch, OF Cody Bellinger, RHP Cade Horton (Cubs’ No. 3 prospect), RHP Jaxon Wiggins (Cubs’ No. 10 prospect), cash After the Blue Jays missed out on Shohei Ohtani last winter and had yet another disappointing season, your guess is as good as mine what happens next. Do they actually get Juan Soto to take their Canadian dollars? And if not, do they get Guerrero to sign an extension? Or do they do both? Or do they do neither? Guerrero is essentially the same age as Soto and might be every bit as keen on testing the open market next winter, especially after unlocking his potential in the second half of 2024. My job here is to trade people, so let’s just assume for a moment that Toronto’s best course of action is to make the most of Guerrero’s value before he possibly bolts. This trade sends him to a Cubs club that lacks star power and offensive thump in the middle of the order and will have the ability to retain him long-term. Manager Craig Counsell said late last season that the Cubs “should be trying to build 90-win teams here,” and Guerrero helps them do exactly that. In this trade, Chicago would also net Gausman, who is coming off a down year but is an All-Star-caliber arm who had a 2.90 ERA from July through the end of the season and is under contract for another two years. The Blue Jays get back two immediate lineup pieces and a top pitching prospect with the potential to reach the bigs in 2025. Busch was one of the few positives from a frustrating 2024 (118 OPS+ and 2.8 bWAR after coming over from the Dodgers). The Blue Jays would enjoy his positional flexibility (he’s played first, second, third and left field in the big leagues) and long-term contractual control (he’s not arbitration eligible until after 2026). Taking on Bellinger’s $27.5 million salary while sending Guerrero’s arbitration cost to Chicago is essentially a wash, though I think the Cubs would have to fork over some of that Bellinger money in this particular deal. The Jays also get Horton, the No. 42 prospect in all of MLB and seventh overall pick in the 2022 Draft. His 2024 was cut short by a lat strain, but he could be knocking on the door after dominating at the Double-A level early this year. Wiggins pads out the package for Toronto as a high-upside arm whose command issues eventually lead to the bullpen. 2) Knitting together a Crochet tradeRed Sox get: LHP Garrett CrochetWhite Sox get: 1B Triston Casas, OF Braden Montgomery (Boston’s No. 5 prospect), SS Yoeilin Cespedes (No. 7), RHP David Sandlin (No. 10) There’s just something so satisfying about Sox swaps. And though a trade between a contender and a rebuilder is typically built entirely around prospects, Casas is young (24) enough and far enough away from free agency (eligible after 2028), while still having displayed verifiable big league ability, that he would make sense as a centerpiece of Chicago’s trade return for their ace Crochet. Casas missed much of last season with a rib cartilage tear, but he’s shown 40-homer potential, and the Sox could sure use that (among other things). This trade also nets them three of Boston’s top 10 prospects (including Montgomery, who ranks No. 54 overall on MLB Pipeline’s Top 100) to amplify a system in need and a Cespedes for the rest of us (no relation to that other Cespedes who once played for the Red Sox). As for the Red Sox, with Crochet they fill an obvious need for an ace while protecting their absolute best prospects, and they can find a shorter-term solution at first base before eventually shifting star Rafael Devers there in the not-too-distant future. It was just eight years ago that the Red Sox acquired a hard-throwing lanky lefty from the White Sox for a package of prospects around this time of year. And two years later, Chris Sale helped Boston win a World Series. Could history repeat itself? 3) Nayl’d it!D-backs get: 1B Josh NaylorGuardians get: LHP Jordan Montgomery, 3B Gino Groover (D-backs’ No. 9 prospect), cash Naylor, an All-Star in 2024 who cranked out 31 homers and 27 doubles, is a free agent at season’s end and might not fit Cleveland’s long-term plans now that Kyle Manzardo is up. Montgomery, a very good pitcher coming off a very bad year, will also be a free agent post-2025 after picking up the $22.5 million player option on a contract that D-backs owner Ken Kendrick called “horrible.” The awkwardness in Arizona could be an opportunity for a club to buy low on Montgomery, and, as we’ve seen time and again, Cleveland is as good a landing spot as any for a pitcher looking to maximize his talents. So in this trade, the D-backs get a replacement for Christian Walker, who might leave in free agency. They eat some of that Montgomery contract, throw in a prospect (I picked Groover only because that’s too awesome a name to not include in this column) and -- boom -- the awkwardness is over! Everybody happy now?

So let’s talk trade, because the White Sox are certainly open to that. Robert is coming off a blah 2024 (87 OPS+, 1.4 bWAR) but in his defense, he was out with a hip issue for a good chunk of it and, ultimately, he was a member of the 2024 White Sox. That could bring anybody down. He’s still a high-impact talent in his prime years (entering his age-27 season). And he’s got pop, which the Yankees could use … all the more if they don’t re-sign Soto. Robert is guaranteed $15 million in 2025, with separate $20 million team options for 2026 and 2027. If Soto’s gone, this trade allows Judge to return to right, and the Yankees are in the market for a left fielder (Alex Verdugo again?). If Soto returns, maybe he goes to left (though I don’t love that in Yankee Stadium)? Maybe Judge goes to first base? Look, I’m not here to answer every question, I’m just trying to solve the obvious issue of having your soon-to-be-33-year-old, 6-foot-7, 282-pound MVP beating himself up in center field. The Sox give up a star to bring in “The Martian,” who technically meets my “big league requirement in these deals by having seen time in the Majors in both 2023 and ’24."" The Domínguez Hype Machine took a bit of a hit after he sustained an elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery in 2023, then had an unremarkable (and very brief) 18-game sample with the Yanks last season. That New York opted to play the struggling Verdugo over him in October perhaps says a lot. But for the White Sox, who probably aren’t going to be very good in the time remaining on the Robert contract, the toolsy talent is absolutely a worthwhile long-term gamble. Frankly, it’s hard to know if Domínguez is enough for Robert or if Robert is enough for Domínguez. Because of the longer-term control of The Martian, in this trade I’m also sending the Yankees a long-term pitching piece in Eder, who debuted last season and could potentially help in the rotation or bullpen in 2025. But as with all of these trades, I’m focused primarily on the centerpieces. 5) Dealing the Cards (a three-team Bohm-nanza!)Phillies get: 3B Nolan Arenado and RHP Ryan Helsley (from Cardinals), RHP Emerson Hancock (from Mariners), cashMariners get: 3B Alec Bohm (from Phillies)Cardinals get: OF Justin Crawford (Phillies’ No. 3 prospect), RHP Mick Abel (Phillies’ No. 6 prospect), OF Lazaro Montes (Mariners’ No. 3 prospect) As the Cardinals try to get younger, the Phillies try to get over that last hump separating them from a World Series trophy and the Mariners try to bounce back from last season’s letdown, all three could all serve one another's needs. Bohm reached All-Star status in 2024 but slumped down the stretch and was even benched for a game in the playoffs. The Phillies have reportedly indicated an openness to moving him. If they did, they would be an interesting home for Arenado, who would certainly fit right in with their cast of 30-something stars. But more important, his right-handed pull tendencies would play up at the Bank. Philly might be the perfect place for him to enjoy a resurgence. Maybe there’s an Arenado deal to be made that sends the 28-year-old Bohm to St. Louis, but the Cards might be more intent on getting middle-infield prospect Thomas Saggese to the bigs sooner than later, which would allow Nolan Gorman to move to his natural position at third. That’s why I’m roping in a third team in the Mariners, who need to lock in an everyday option at the hot corner and would benefit from Bohm’s reasonable contractual control for the next two years while dealing from an area of strength in shipping Hancock -- a 25-year-old starter who is blocked in Seattle’s elite rotation -- to Philly. The complicating factor in this or any Arenado deal is the big contract that pays him another $74 million total through 2027 (with $10 million of that paid by the Rockies, as if this isn’t all confusing enough). That’s why I’m “tacking on” the not-so-small factor that is one season of control of Helsley, the reigning NL Relief Pitcher of the Year. From the Phillies’ perspective, that’s a pretty good get in exchange for absorbing -- some(?), most(?), all(?) -- of the Arenado money. Ultimately, how much the Cardinals eat would affect the quality of their prospect return. Perhaps (likely) what I’ve proposed falls short for all parties. But I happen to think we have the seeds of something here. So I’ll let the esteemed execs involved round out the finer details. My work is done."
MLB News,Reasons to believe in 5 free agents who underperformed in '24,https://www.mlb.com/news/2024-2025-mlb-free-agents-rebound-candidates,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024 01:26:20 GMT",,"Thomas Harrigan While many free agents absolutely aced their walk years in 2024, others were not so fortunate. For every player who boosted their market value with a standout season, there were those whose struggles or injuries dampened their stock. MLB offseason signings and trades• Latest free-agent and trade rumors• Top 25 free agents | Every free agent, by position• Tracking every team's offseason moves• FA guides: Soto | Burnes | Alonso | Bregman | Fried | Santander• Offseason dates, rules & terms explained Though not ideal for the player’s bottom line, a poor platform season can present an opportunity for a savvy team to uncover a hidden gem in free agency and reap the rewards of a rebound. With this in mind, here are five free agents who offer intriguing upside despite underperforming in 2024. Walker Buehler, SP What happened in 2024: After missing part of 2022 and all of 2023 while recovering from his second Tommy John surgery, Buehler returned in May and went on to post a 5.38 ERA over 16 starts, spending time on the IL with right hip inflammation along the way. He finished with a 19.4% whiff rate, a 24.5% chase rate, an 18.6% strikeout rate and an 8.1% walk rate, all of which were considerably worse than his marks in 2021, his last healthy season. Reasons for optimism: Buehler’s track record is perhaps the biggest reason teams will be willing to overlook his 2024 struggles as they pursue him in free agency. Simply put, there aren’t many pitchers available who have been as good as Buehler was at his best. But we don’t have to look all the way back to 2021 to find something positive to say about the 30-year-old, who boosted his stock with a strong performance under the bright lights of October. Buehler threw 10 straight scoreless innings with 13 K's over his final three postseason games, including a perfect frame to close out the Dodgers’ World Series title. Although it wasn’t a large sample, the righty made some encouraging strides with his arsenal in the playoffs, adding more “rise” to his four-seamer, sharpening up his knuckle-curve and showing glimpses of a nasty sweeper, as MLB.com’s David Adler recently detailed. Max Kepler, RF What happened in 2024: Kepler battled injuries and finished the season with just eight homers and a .682 OPS (91 OPS+) over 105 games, as his barrel rate (6.2%) and hard-hit rate (36.8%) both plummeted from his career-high marks in 2023 (12.2% barrel rate, 47.9% hard-hit rate). Reasons for optimism: If Kepler hit the free-agent market last offseason, he would have been one of the top corner outfielders available. Now, he might be flying under the radar in a market that features Juan Soto, Anthony Santander, Teoscar Hernández, Tyler O’Neill and Jurickson Profar. The 31-year-old Kepler is a plus defender in right field, leading the position by a wide margin in Outs Above Average (+27) over the past four years. He also has six seasons on his résumé with at least 17 homers, including 24 dingers as recently as 2023, when he ranked in the 89th percentile in expected SLG (.503). J.D. Martinez, DH What happened in 2024: Martinez had an uneven season with the Mets after lingering on the free-agent market until late March and spending several weeks ramping up against Minor League pitching. The veteran DH ended up with just 16 homers and a .406 slugging percentage, his lowest in a non-shortened season since 2013 (.378). Reasons for optimism: Martinez may be 37, but he isn’t far removed from ranking among baseball’s most productive power bats. He finished 2023 with 33 homers over 113 games for the Dodgers, notching the eighth-highest slugging percentage (.572) among hitters with at least 450 plate appearances. While Martinez certainly showed signs of decline in 2024, his underlying metrics suggest he still has some pop left in his bat. The right-handed slugger ended 2024 with a 14.9% barrel rate, a 39.3% sweet-spot rate and a .472 expected SLG, placing in the 87th percentile or higher in all three metrics. Martinez was also on track for a much better season before going into a dreadful slump (6-for-59, 0 HR) over his final 17 games. He had a .785 OPS over 103 games prior to that season-ending cold spell. Jorge Polanco, 2B What happened in 2024: Looking to address their long-standing woes at second base, the Mariners swung an offseason trade with the Twins for Polanco. However, the veteran sharply regressed, hitting just .213 with a .651 OPS over 118 games while striking out in 29.2% of his plate appearances (a career worst). Seattle declined his $12 million club option at the end of the year, making him a free agent. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Reasons for optimism: Polanco rediscovered his power stroke in the second half of the season, more closely resembling the player who produced 89 homers with a .796 OPS (117 OPS+) over 544 games for the Twins from 2019-23. The second baseman went deep 11 times and had a .203 ISO over his final 55 games. Further improvement could be on the horizon as Polanco moves on from pitcher-friendly T-Mobile Park in Seattle, where he slashed .193/.284/.322 with a 31.9% K-rate in 2024. Gleyber Torres, 2B What happened in 2024: Torres experienced a curious decline in his age-27 season, producing just 15 homers with a .709 OPS -- barely north of league average (101 OPS+) -- over 154 games. The second baseman’s hard-hit rate dropped nearly five points to 35.4%, and his strikeout rate climbed back over 20% after tumbling to a career-best 14.6% in 2023. Reasons for optimism: Torres has never returned to the lofty heights of his breakout 2019 season, when he swatted 38 homers with an .871 OPS (128 OPS+), but he was one of the most powerful players at his position across 2022-23. He went deep 49 times in that span, ranking second among primary second basemen. Although he had a disappointing 2024 season on the whole, Torres excelled after moving to the leadoff spot in mid-August, slashing .294/.375/.439 with a 40.4% hard-hit rate, a 15.8% strikeout rate and an 11.9% walk rate over his final 53 games (postseason included). One of the youngest free agents on the market, Torres is a good bet to improve in 2025."

HOUSTON -- The favorite meals and desserts typically associated with Thanksgiving and some traditional dishes from Puerto Rico help make for a memorable holiday season each year for Astros manager Joe Espada. The blending of food, music and traditions while spending time with his family give him plenty of reasons to be thankful. This year, Espada along with his wife, Pam, and daughters -- 13-year-old Eliana and 9-year-old Viviana -- made the long drive from their Houston area home to Dallas, where they spent Thanksgiving with Espada’s parents -- his mother Miriam and father Dolores. Joe’s sister, Rebecca, lives in Dallas and helps care for their parents. Espada said the family typically alternates holidays each year, spending Thanksgiving with his family one year and Christmas with his wife’s family the next. They switch it up the following year. “It means a lot, because my parents are getting older and it’s hard for them to travel,” Espada said. “We make time to drive up and see them and the grandkids come and spend some time with them. We make the effort, so we can spend time with them.” Any time Espada can spend with his parents is special these days, especially at the holidays. His father hasn’t been in the best of health the last few years. His parents were at Minute Maid Park last March to see him manage the first game of his career when the Astros took on the Yankees, which was the most memorable moment of his managerial debut. Thankful for you, Astros fans! 🧡Happy #Thanksgiving pic.twitter.com/i4VjPk62xg Miriam and Dolores raised three kids in Puerto Rico, where Thanksgiving is celebrated. Espada’s wife is from Florida, so when both sides of the family get together, it’s a mixture of culture and influences. “We keep some of the Puerto Rican traditions, obviously, when it comes to the food,” Joe said. “We have some of the American-style plates. Pam will do a sweet potato casserole, a green bean casserole, which my family really enjoys. We also have your typical Puerto Rico meals for Thanksgiving, so it’s a combination of both. It’s very typical. There’s a lot of people, there’s a lot of music, we have a good time during this time.” One of the most popular holiday dishes in Puerto Rico is pasteles, which is similar to tamales, but has ingredients wrapped in plantains instead of corn husks. “It’s like a plantain mash and we put meat in it and olives and stuff like that,” Joe said. “We’ll have a ton of desserts, you name it -- cheesecakes and we usually have tres leches. We’ll have leftovers, of course. We’ll be eating this for the next three or four days after Thanksgiving. It’s fun. We start decorating some Christmas stuff during these days. We all do it together.” In addition to food and music, football is on the television. The adults gather to watch the Dallas Cowboys play their traditional Thanksgiving home game, while the children are in front of another television watching the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Of course, baseball remains a big talking point over Thanksgiving dinner, as well. Baseball’s hot stove is just starting to heat up, and Joe can’t escape members of his family peppering him with questions about the Astros. Of course, the future of free-agent third baseman Alex Bregman is at the top of everyone’s mind, even over turkey and dressing. “It’s hard not to talk baseball with my dad,” Joe said. “He wants to know the same questions I get asked from the fans. He wants to know, ‘Are we signing Breggy? Are we getting any starting pitching?’ It’s baseball [talk] for the first day and after that things kind of settle down.” Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Baseball has always been at the heart of the family. Dolores had a hip replacement at a young age and couldn’t work, so Miriam worked long hours while Dolores took Joe to his practices in Puerto Rico. As a young kid, Joe watched baseball at home with his father, who was a fan of the Yankees, Mets and Braves. Espada’s parents put family first, and being with them for Thanksgiving is a reminder for Joe how much that has meant to him. “It’s important for me to take time and make time,” he said."
MLB News,1 reason for every team to be thankful,https://www.mlb.com/news/reasons-for-every-mlb-team-to-give-thanks,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 02:20:45 GMT",,"Will Leitch Happy Thanksgiving, everyone. In the words of a great bird I once met, “Gobble, gobble.” Thanksgiving is not a holiday traditionally associated with baseball, but if you’re reading a baseball site on Thanksgiving Day, you know that in a just world, every holiday is one associated with baseball. So, today, on Turkey Day, we provide you with an old Thanksgiving staple: We give you something for every team’s fanbase to be thankful for. Even if the season didn’t go how you wanted it to, there’s still something you feel lucky to have. Here’s one thing for everyone to give thanks for. Enjoy the yams. AL EAST Blue Jays Last year was an absolute mess, and the sort of year that often leads to a reckoning. But if you are a Jays fan, you have been able to follow players such as Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette from their time as highly touted prospects through their maturation as big league stars. Both are scheduled to reach free agency next offseason, but rather than starting a rebuild, the Blue Jays are keeping the band together to make one last run at the playoffs. Orioles The playoffs have been frustrating the last two years, but this is still a team that’s the envy of baseball. Baltimore is packed with young talent, backed by a fanbase desperate to win, and has clear opportunities to upgrade in its first offseason under new ownership. It was a very rough decade for the Orioles faithful. These are now the good times. There are even better times coming. Rays First off, everyone’s grateful that the Rays are going to have a place to play in 2025, in a stadium that should actually prove a pretty terrific environment for the next year. This is a team with its usual share of young talent, and this could be the year Junior Caminero firmly establishes himself as the next big thing. Red Sox There are all sorts of signs that the Red Sox might be ready to spend big this offseason, and that’s coming off a year that was a lot more successful than many people thought it was going to be. The Red Sox have idled for a while now, but there’s a foundation of talent here, with the opportunity to grow, and a fanbase that is ready to, at last, get moving. Yankees Hey, you finally made that World Series you’d been waiting 15 years for. Sure, it didn’t end with a 28th championship, which means it’s somewhat disappointing. But the Yankees still have Aaron Judge and the money to bring back Juan Soto … if they can make it happen. And again, even though you didn’t win it, no one should be shaking their head at a World Series appearance. AL CENTRAL Guardians The Guardians have reached the playoffs six of the last nine seasons and won their division five times during that time. That is, essentially, the second-best stretch in franchise history, behind only those 1990s teams. There has been some playoff frustration, but these are in many ways the best of times for Guardians fans. Royals Royals fans get to watch Bobby Witt Jr. every day, which is pretty much the best possible gift, all told, especially when you consider that they’re locked into doing so for the next decade. He made his first playoff appearance this year. It won’t be his last. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Tigers That glorious September run didn’t just electrify the fanbase -- it served as a proof of concept for everything this franchise has been trying to do for a decade now. They look primed to add this offseason, and maybe make this the AL Central juggernaut moving forward. It’s a very good time in Detroit sports right now! Twins This year was disappointing, but this is still as stalwart of a franchise as this division has, with stars like Carlos Correa and Byron Buxton that would be the envy of any team. The question, as always, is health. And we should always try to be thankful for whatever health we have, every Thanksgiving. White Sox A trying 2024 is almost over. That’s something to be thankful for, and they also have a highly regarded new manager to help them turn the page. AL WEST Angels The Angels have already made some moves this offseason, making it clear that they’re not slinking away after some rough seasons. They’ve got more young talent than you might think, and you may have vague memories of a Mike Trout fellow who will be back for Opening Day. Astros Their incredible ALCS streak finally ended, but they proved in 2024, after a rough start, that they aren’t going anywhere. The Astros have been the team of the AL over the last decade, and there’s no reason to think that won’t remain the case for at least one more year. Athletics After an emotional goodbye to Oakland, the A’s will start a new adventure in Sacramento, and they’re hardly doing so with a bare cupboard: Who would have thought we’d have a second coming of the Bash Brothers with Brent Rooker and Lawrence Butler? Mariners That starting rotation, combined with Julio Rodríguez, gives them a high floor. One of these years, it’s all going to come together perfectly -- maybe it’s this one. Rangers The title defense was a bit of a dud, but a healthy Corey Seager (and a healthy Jacob deGrom?) would get them right back in the mix in 2025. And all that 2023 World Series champions merchandise you bought still looks pretty, doesn’t it? NL EAST Braves Just about everything other than Chris Sale went wrong for the Braves in 2024 … and they still made the playoffs. They’ll get just about everybody back for 2025, and their luck should improve. Thus, they may well be the NL favorites again. Marlins Every single member of the Marlins rotation and everyday lineup is currently under 30 years old. That sort of youth movement has sometimes worked out quite excellently for the Marlins in the past. Mets The Mets gave their fans the ride of a lifetime this October, and remember, they actually did it a year earlier than anyone expected. Now that we’ve seen where this team seems to be going, Mets fans have a whole offseason to watch their owner and front office add to it. This could get exciting. Nationals The last time we saw all this young talent in one place in a Nationals uniform, they were about to start a run of postseason appearances that would culminate with the 2019 World Series title. Phillies The recent run of frustrating postseason exits shouldn’t distract from the fact that the Phillies have a core that’s probably better than anyone else’s in baseball … a core they may well add to this offseason. Sure, they’re getting older. But hey, aren’t we all. NL CENTRAL Brewers Remember when everyone wrote off the Brewers because they lost their manager and their ace heading into the 2024 season? Well, they ended up sprinting away with the division anyway. Pat Murphy stepped in for Craig Counsell to win the NL Manager of the Year Award, and the team made its sixth postseason appearance in seven years. Cardinals The Cardinals look to be taking a step back this year, but it may just look that way, as they focus on young players such as Jordan Walker, Nolan Gorman and Masyn Winn. That should give them, and Cardinals fans, a concrete answer as to what the future of this franchise is really going to look like. Cubs The Cubs haven’t lived up to expectations the last couple of years, but they’re hardly shrinking from those expectations moving forward. This is still going to be a team worth coming out to see at glorious Wrigley Field anytime you have the opportunity to do so. Pirates Paul Skenes is reason enough to be thankful, of course, but don’t forget Jared Jones and Mitch Keller. If the Pirates are ever able to sneak in the playoffs -- and they just might in 2025 -- that’s a triumvirate no one will want to deal with. Reds Elly De La Cruz finished in the top five of NL MVP voting, and it still feels like he’s only scratching the surface of what he’s capable of accomplishing. And with Terry Francona now in charge, the Reds clearly have an arrow pointing up. NL WEST Diamondbacks The Diamondbacks reached the World Series in 2023 and were still probably a better team in 2024. Ketel Marte has officially reached full-on star status; Corbin Carroll may well be next. Dodgers They just won the World Series. Better yet, both the team and the fans got to enjoy the full-on celebration that the pandemic made impossible in 2020. Giants After years of frustration, the Giants have a True Giant in charge of baseball operations now, with Buster Posey providing much-needed direction for the whole enterprise. The Giants are doing everything they can to bring back those good old days. Padres Last year may in fact have been the best Padres team ever, one that came this close to beating those blasted Dodgers. The ascension of Jackson Merrill has elevated this whole franchise to a brand new level. Rockies The Rockies are always looking for someone to build around, and Ezequiel Tovar is sure starting to look like that guy, as a 23-year-old Gold Glove Award-winning shortstop."
MLB News,How a career in professional baseball saved this Minor League manager,https://www.mlb.com/news/athletics-milb-manager-conklin-saved-by-baseball,"Thu, 07 Nov 2024 15:00:00 GMT",,"Benjamin Hill Benjamin Hill travels the nation collecting stories about what makes Minor League Baseball unique. This excerpt from his newsletter -- which he reported on from Lansing, Mich., on Aug. 27 -- is one of those stories. Read the full newsletter here, and subscribe to his newsletter here. By the time Craig Conklin got his first job coaching in the Minors, he had already survived a volatile childhood, a period living out of his car, drug addiction, a stint in the military and the death of his adult daughter. Through it all, he knew what kept him going. “There are two things that saved my life,” Conklin said. “Baseball and surfing.” It was late in the 2024 season, the tarp was on the field, and the 62-year-old skipper of the Lansing Lugnuts – High-A affiliate of the Athletics -- was in his office telling the story of his long and winding career. Over the course of a 20-minute conversation, the words soundtracked by the muffled pulsation of the reggaeton and hip-hop songs his young charges were blaring in the clubhouse, Conklin shared his lifestory. Undergirding it all was the deeply ingrained tenaciousness that has been his life’s guiding force. “There are thousands of guys out there who can run a drill, hit fungoes, throw BP,” he said. “But there aren’t a lot who have experienced what I have in life, so that was a valuable tool to add to those other things. … People skills. Being able to sense people's emotions and read their body language, just how they can't carry themselves. Have them feel comfortable enough to come talk to me about something. My door is always open.” Conklin has refined those skills over the course of 25 years working for the Oakland organization, but his story begins on the beaches of Malibu. “I grew up in a family that was broken, and I was the blonde hair, blue eyes kid who lived at the beach,” he said. “My dad was involved in a lot of different things that weren’t conducive to the raising of a kid. So he dropped me off at the beach in the summers, and I’d hang out there all day while he went to work in Compton.” Throughout a childhood in which narcotics and criminality were a regular presence, Conklin found solace where he could. His love of baseball took root when he played catch with his grandfather for the first time. “If I was at the beach, or on a baseball field, the world couldn’t hurt. They’re sanctuaries. … I needed to be in those environments to feel safe and protected, so I did whatever I had to do to stay in.” But finding a way wasn’t easy. After getting cut from the Cuesta College juco team two years in a row, Conklin moved to San Diego -- “Where the best baseball in California’s at” -- in hopes of getting noticed there. He lived out of his car, was always low on money and eventually returned home. “I ended up talking my way into a tryout with the junior college team that had cut me two years in a row. … Two weeks later I’m starting in left field and then it got to the point where I could have signed as a free agent.” But Conklin never played baseball professionally. After finding out that his girlfriend was pregnant, he decided that “running off to go play baseball at that particular time wasn’t the prudent thing to do.” He joined the Army instead, serving in Kentucky with the 101st Airborne. When, three years later, his dad became terminally ill, he received an honorable hardship discharge and returned to California. “I was in limbo. I didn’t really know what I was doing. I got in trouble with drugs, three stints in rehab and different things like that,” he said. “Because that’s what I knew. That’s the environment we lived in. I didn’t have baseball to save me anymore. I only had surfing.” Conklin, needing the game back in his life, returned to Cuesta College in a coaching capacity while supplementing his income with all manner of odd jobs. He started to take notice of the scouts who hung around the field, thinking, “Maybe I could do that.” It was tough to get much information from members of this cloistered fraternity, but a scout whom Conklin knew from his playing days told him that Major League Baseball had a scout development program. He enrolled, and eventually landed a position with the (now defunct) Major League Scouting Bureau. “I was finishing concrete with a buddy of mine, told him ‘I gotta make a phone call about a job.’ He knew that I was trying to get into [scouting], goes ‘You know, guys like us don’t get jobs like that.’ I go, ‘Guys like you don’t get jobs like that. … If I don’t get a job this year, it’ll be next year, and if it isn’t next year, I’ll just keep going.” From 1999-2015 he worked for Major League Baseball as an area scout covering southern and central California. After the MLB Scouting Bureau disbanded, the Athletics hired him. “I always wanted to be in [player] development,” he said. “That was always the master plan. But I liked the freedom scouting gave me. I didn't miss any of my kid’s stuff in school. You’re a master of your own time as long as you were responsible and did your work.” Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. In October of 2017 Conklin endured a devastating loss. His daughter, Jordan, was killed in a car accident at the age of 28. “We were like this,” Conklin said, intertwining his middle and index finger. “Being on the road, as a scout, it can be pretty lonely. [After Jordan’s death] I didn’t need to be in my head like that.” Jordan’s death expedited Conklin’s transition from scouting to coaching, a decidedly less solitary pursuit. But there was never a doubt that he wanted to remain in the game. “I don’t subscribe to pouting or pity parties, no matter what happens to me,” he said. “My daughter passing away in the manner in which she did, surviving that and thriving through it, it’s an honor. Honoring her memory is very important to me. Whatever motivates someone to do the right thing, and I’ve always tried to do the right thing. Be empathetic. Compassionate.” These traits have guided Conklin in his coaching career, which began with the Triple-A Las Vegas Aviators and also included a season with the Single-A Stockton Ports. He arrived in Lansing in 2022, assuming the managerial role the following season. Conklin’s ultimate goal, as it is for most everyone, is to reach the Major Leagues. There’s no stopping now. “My upbringing caused me to get derailed and fall into selfishness. But once you rebound you come back to being who you are, if life hasn’t consumed you to a point of no return,” he said. “I was close to that, but that internal fire wouldn’t let me go down that road.”"
MLB News,Phillies support their spring home with $1 million donation,https://www.mlb.com/news/phillies-make-donation-to-amplify-clearwater,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 21:50:00 GMT",,"Todd Zolecki This story was excerpted from Todd Zolecki's Phillies Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. The Phillies have called Clearwater, Fla., their home away from home since 1947. They have played at BayCare Ballpark since 2004. A trip to Clearwater and BayCare should be on every Phillies fan’s bucket list. Nothing beats a stroll along the beach in the morning, watching a Grapefruit League game in the afternoon, and enjoying a grouper sandwich and beer (or two) in the evening as the sun sets on the Gulf of Mexico. Clearwater is a memory-maker, but it is also vitally important to the Phillies. It is no surprise, then, that the team recently donated $1 million to AMPLIFY Clearwater to support the recovery from Hurricanes Helene and Milton. • Phillies in the Community “It’s our second home,” Phillies managing partner John Middleton said recently. “It’s been our Spring Training home for 78 years. It’s very, very important to us. Businesses should feel they have a commitment to their communities, whether it’s the Major League team in Philadelphia, the Florida club, but also the affiliates we have in Reading, Lehigh Valley and Lakewood. You need to be part of the community. You can’t just plop yourself down there and work there and not set roots there. People work there, they have homes there, they raise their kids there and they go to school there. “You build commitments and relationships, and good relationships are two-way streets. If you’ve got a friend who’s hurt, who’s in trouble, you try to help them.” The AMPLIFY Hope campaign launched to support businesses and residents facing extensive damage from the storms, many of which are working through structural repairs and inventory losses. Since its launch, AMPLIFY Clearwater has received more than 50 applications from those seeking assistance. The Phillies’ commitment doubled previous contributions, boosting the impact to local businesses and residents, according to AMPLIFY. “[My wife], Leigh, and I have a home in Clearwater, so we have an additional connection than just the Phillies’ organizational commitment,” Middleton said. “For us, we have the personal and business side of it. So we reached out to them. We talked about it internally. It was something that all of us wanted to do. But what is ‘something’? I said, ‘Let’s do something significant, something really meaningful.’” We are proud to announce that the @Phillies Organization has generously offered to match donations to @ClearwaterArea #Amplify #Clearwater up to $1 million. The fund will directly benefit small #businesses affected by the recent #hurricanes.L to R: Phillies Managing Partner &… pic.twitter.com/ieqR3pLEWf The Phillies spoke to Clearwater mayor Bruce Rector and others shortly after the second hurricane hit. Rector and others suggested AMPLIFY because 100 percent of the money goes to businesses and residents in need. ""The Philadelphia Phillies have stepped forward as champions for our community in this time of need,” Rector said in a statement. “Their commitment to our community shows the profound connection and dedication they have to Clearwater and its people,” AMPLIFY Clearwater president and CEO Amanda Payne said in a statement. Clearwater is working its way back. Some businesses along the beach have reopened, although others have not. It will take time to fully recover. But Phillies fans should see remarkable progress by the time the team plays its Grapefruit League home opener on Feb. 23 against the Orioles. “I was down there recently,” Middleton said. “Hotels are open, restaurants are open, the beaches look great. Honest to God, if you stood on the beach, you wouldn’t know there was ever a problem. They’ve worked really hard.” Asked what immediately comes to mind when he thinks of Clearwater, Middleton said, “I think about that beautiful ballpark and the field, walking around, and how nice and relaxed it is. It’s the calm before the six-month storm. It’s great. That is the Field of Dreams. Down there, everybody is undefeated, everybody is going to have a career year. It’s a really beautiful place.” For more information on how to donate, click here."
MLB News,The wild story of Bo Jackson leaving an Auburn dive team speechless,https://www.mlb.com/news/bo-jackson-dove-with-auburn-diving-team,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 02:59:00 GMT",The wild story of Bo Jackson leaving an Auburn dive team speechless,"Matt Monagan A version of this story originally ran in June 2021 and is revisited today for his birthday. Bo Jackson could seemingly do it all. He was a star at Alabama's McAdory High School -- hitting a mythical 20 homers in 25 games one year, while averaging 11 yards per carry on the football field. At Auburn, he was called the ""best pure athlete in America"" -- winning the Heisman Trophy as a senior, hitting .401 with 17 homers as a junior and qualifying for the 100-meter dash during both his freshman and sophomore seasons. He went on to become an All-Star in MLB and All-Pro in the NFL. His Nike commercials had fun with his multi-sport talents, showing him ready to play polo, golf, basketball and any number of sports that he came into contact with. But could he really excel at any of those other pursuits without much experience? Sports you wouldn't expect a 6-foot-1, 220-pound muscle-bound athlete to be able to pull off? Sports like, say, diving? ""Oh yeah, the story that you're talking about is essentially true,"" former Auburn dive coach Rick Theobald told me over the phone. ""All the divers who were there at the time, they still talk about it whenever we have a reunion."" It was the Fall of 1989, at least as far as Theobald recalls, and 26-year-old Bo Jackson was back at Auburn filming his aforementioned ""Bo Knows"" Nike ads. He was throwing down dunks in the auxiliary gym for the basketball version of the segment, and, during a break, he saw a place down the hall that his two toddler sons might enjoy: the university pool. The Tigers' diving team was holding a practice, and Bo poked his head in to ask if his kids could swim at the other end. As Theobald told me, you don't really say no to somebody like Bo Jackson, so the kids went down to the shallow part of the pool, followed by their dad. After some time watching the divers, Bo asked if he could try it out. Bo wanted to dive. The entire team, including Coach Theobald, were excited that Bo wanted to try out their sport. ""Everyone going to Auburn at that time was always waiting to see the next miracle that Bo was gonna pull off,"" Theobald said. So, the answer again, was yes. Bo left the pool area, pulled on some shorts and walked back in toward the 1 meter board. He was, of course, much bigger than most divers -- especially back in the 1980s. ""He was probably about 220 and the amount of muscle on him -- it was a ridiculous amount for one person,"" Theobald recalled. ""... When I was coaching Auburn, the largest guy I had was a guy named Mike Smith. He was 5-foot-10, 5-foot-11 and probably weighed about 170 pounds. A solid rock stomp of muscle. The NCAA champion Jose Roach was about 150 pounds and he was 5-foot-7 or 5-foot-8. The other guys in the pool who I think were there probably weighed about 130?"" Bo had about 100 pounds on the average diver. As Auburn's most famous alum walked out to the edge of the board, the divers were eager to see him, but honestly, not expecting too much. I mean, had Bo ever tried this before? A giant professional football and baseball player ... diving? ""Let's just say there was a healthy dose of skepticism floating around the pool,"" Theobald said. Bo proceeded to the end of the plank and, as Theobald recalled, jumped into the air about a foot higher than most divers would -- maybe 3 1/2 or four feet. A ""ginormous hurdle."" It was a bit out of control. But when he came back down on the board to execute his dive, he had settled his body. Then came a sight Theobald had never seen before in his decades of coaching at a competitive level. ""I was the most shocked I'd ever been by watching a non-diver,"" Theobald told me. ""He hit the end of the board and bent it all the way downward where the tip of the board went in the water. Probably six inches. He was in the water up to his ankles."" Bo shot back out of the pool and flew up into the air, doing a 2 1/2 tuck. Two full front flips! And he landed in a dive! Basically this, but from a bouncing board lower to the water. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. ""My jaw must've hit the floor,"" Theobald said. ""And all the divers, all the kids that were there, clapping and saying. 'Oh my god!' They were all just as shocked and impressed as I was."" Any thought that this would be a silly, entertaining moment dissipated quickly. ""The element of funny went right out the window,"" Theobald told me. ""The awe went right up to the roof."" One story (actually, the only story that talks about this ever happening) mentions Bo then going up to the 3 meter board and doing the same thing. Theobald only remembered this one dive but said he did ask Bo if he wanted to get up and try it from a greater height. Bo said something like, ""No, man, I'm not crazy."" ""I think when you do that good the first time, I think Bo knows the moment,"" Theobald said. ""He stepped away and went back to the other end of the pool and started playing with his kids again."" That's it. That's the story of Royals All-Star outfielder Bo Jackson taking a break from dunking basketballs -- for a commercial about him being able to play every sport -- and then casually pulling off a double-front flip at an NCAA Division I collegiate dive practice. Theobald guessed it probably wasn't the first time Bo had ever tried out diving, but he had never seen him around the pool during his time in school as a player or coach. Either way, one thing was now officially clear: Bo knew diving."
MLB News,Inbox: Jobe vs. Painter; prospects who could rise in 2025,https://www.mlb.com/news/pipeline-inbox-jackson-jobe-vs-andrew-painter,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024 20:01:12 GMT",,"Jim Callis I hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving. Let's dive into some questions to go with the leftovers ... More from MLB Pipeline:• Top 100 prospects | Stats | Video | Podcast | Complete coverage Hey Jim, what player or two outside of the Pipeline’s Top 100 has the upside and best chance to be ranked as a top ten Pipeline prospect a year from now would you say? Thanks! This actually happened in 2024, with Kristian Campbell going from not making our Top 100 Prospects or Red Sox Top 30 lists at the start of the year to ending it at No. 10. We don't see rises like that happen very often, but I'll play along. The two demographics that seemingly would provide the best candidates are international signees making their U.S. debuts, or players selected in the previous Draft (a la Campbell). Dominican shortstops Jesus Made (MIL No. 4) and Emil Morales (LAD No. 8) are two international players to watch. Made signed for $950,000 last January and batted .331/.458/.554 with six homers and 28 steals in 51 games in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League. He has 25-25 upside, a strong arm and tools similar to Leodalis De Vries, who signed for $4.2 million with the Padres as part of the same 2024 international class and already has risen to No. 28 on the Top 100. Morales received a higher bonus ($1.9 million) and posted even louder numbers in the DSL, slashing .342/.478/.691 and leading the league in slugging, OPS (1.169), homers (14 in 46 games), extra-base hits (25) and total bases (105). He has a similar profile to Made with a little less quickness, meaning he's more likely to move to third base in the future. The prime 2024 Draft possibility is Rays outfielder Theo Gillen (TB No. 5), the best pure hitter in this year's prep class and the 18th overall selection. The Texas high school product could develop into a .300 hitter with 25 homers if he reaches his ceiling, and he's also a plus runner who should be an asset in center field. If -- and it’s a very big if -- Orioles outfielder Vance Honeycutt (BAL No. 3) can make consistent contact, he could rocket toward the top of the Top 100. The 22nd overall pick out of North Carolina, he had the best tools in the college crop (well above-average raw power, speed and center-field defense, plus arm strength) but also carried a 26 percent strikeout rate during his Tar Heels career and a 43 percent K rate during his brief pro debut. Who would you rather have on your team in 2025, Jackson Jobe or Andrew Painter? I saw Painter -- MLB's No. 32 prospect -- earlier this month in the Arizona Fall League, where he ranked as the top prospect. The Phillies right-hander's mid-90s fastball, upper-80s slider/cutter and low-80s curveball were all weapons. He also showed feel for his 90-mph changeup and threw strikes, though he did battle his fastball command a bit -- understandable considering that he missed all of the last two seasons while dealing with an elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. All that said, I'd take Jobe (MLB No. 5) for 2025. The Tigers righty has a formidable fastball/slider/changeup repertoire of his own and usually fills the zone, though his control was erratic at times this season. I like Painter's stuff and command better for the long run, but Detroit should get significantly more innings out of Jobe than Philadelphia will from Painter. Though Jobe's career high is the 95 2/3 innings he tallied in 2024, when he lost seven weeks to a hamstring injury, he should be able to work 135 next season. The Phillies will have to be more careful with Painter, with 80-100 innings a realistic workload. They'll have to manage him judiciously in order to have him available for a high-leverage role as a starter or reliever in the postseason. I'm sure the Dodgers feel Dalton Rushing's bat is close to Major League ready, but how much work does he need defensively in left field to get the call? -- @jaredjmassey on Bluesky Rushing's bat does look like it's ready for the big leagues. MLB's No. 39 prospect tied for second among Minor League catchers with 26 homers in 2024 while slashing .271/.384/.512 between Double-A and Triple-A. The Dodgers had him regularly play the outfield in the last two months of the Minor League season, looking for a way to get him more at-bats when he serves as Will Smith's understudy in the Majors. Deceptively athletic and quicker than most catchers, Rushing could play an adequate left field right now. Smith made his second straight All-Star Game in 2024, but his defense slipped as he caught a career-high 121 games during the regular season and he looked exhausted during Los Angeles' World Series run. Los Angeles could cut Smith back to 100 games at catcher and give him another 20 starts at DH, while Rushing could catch 60 games, get 40 games in left field and DH occasionally. That would keep them both fresh behind the plate and Rushing can get the job done as a sporadic left fielder. For what it's worth, Teoscar Hernández was the worst defensive left fielder in baseball in 2024, so Rushing in left won't torpedo the Dodgers' defense. Thoughts on Tyler Black? Many had him as a 55 FV but Brewers don't seem super eager to find a place for him. Lack of defensive home where bat will play may be too much to overcome. -- @Badgermaniac on Bluesky Everything that Badger Maniac says is true. Black is an on-base machine with the potential to hit 15-20 homers and steal 25 bags per season. But he also has fringy arm strength and less savvy in the field than he does on the bases. The Brewers tried him at second base, third base, left field and center field before deploying him mainly at first base in 2024. A 2021 supplemental first-round pick from Wright State, Black (MIL No. 5) doesn't really fit the first-base profile. He got just six starts there for Milwaukee last summer and batted .204/.316/.245 in an 18-game trial. The Brewers don't have a clear-cut third baseman for next season, though Black's arm would be an issue. Black's offensive game is still appealing but he may need a trade to find regular big league at-bats. His best infield fit is second base, but Milwaukee is set there with Brice Turang and Black's glove is substandard there. He's 24 years old and at a crossroads in his career."

NEW YORK -- As more than 1,000 fans streamed through the Citi Field team store last week, donating a record 13,000-plus pounds of food to the Food Bank for New York City, Mets staffers tried to analyze what had gone so right. Were their marketing efforts working that well? Were people simply feeling extra charitable this year? Or had the Mets’ extended postseason run elevated their brand in the eyes of many, creating a closer relationship between the club and its fans? “I’m sure it was a combination of it being the holidays but also the team having finished on such a strong, high note,” said Jane Son, head of foundation and community engagement. “It’s great that, certainly from a foundation and community perspective, we’re benefiting from fan excitement of wanting to support the team -- and, as we head into the holidays, the community.” This year’s MetsGiving initiatives have been as ambitious as ever, beginning with the aforementioned food drive on Nov. 19. Later that week, the Mets received a surprise invitation to ring the Nasdaq opening bell, with former Mets captain John Franco doing the honors to spread MetsGiving awareness. Franco subsequently drove to the New York Common Pantry in Harlem, where he handed out turkeys to families in need. For the rest of that day, Mets employees fanned out around the five boroughs to donate 8,500 turkeys -- another record for an annual team initiative. Ding ding ding!John Franco rang the @NasdaqExchange opening bell along with Mr. and Mrs. Met this morning to celebrate MetsGiving! 🔔📈 pic.twitter.com/88Uwenpxht “We’re home here in Queens, but we also want to make sure we’re supporting others that need it in the other boroughs,” Son said. “We want the city to know we’re here for them.” It’s a charge that will continue for another month, with three more events scheduled: a public coat drive on Dec. 11, followed by the Amazin’ Mets Foundation’s Holiday Dinner for local families in need on Dec. 18, and the team’s annual Kids’ Holiday Party on Dec. 19. Another Mets alumnus, Todd Zeile, will play Santa Claus this year at the party. “We’re grateful that we’ve got alumni that are looking to give back to the community and be there with us to continue to support them,” Son said, “even though they’re no longer playing for the team.” The @Mets and @newyorkcares are teaming up for their annual Coat Drive, presented by your local @DriveToyota dealers.

In that fashion, the Mets hope their on-field success will continue to aid their philanthropic efforts off it. “Obviously, just always looking to give back to the community,” Son said. “The holidays are a tough time for a lot of people, more so this year. And I know every year, everybody says it. But we’re just really focused on helping the community during this time.”"

The Braves announced they signed Gillispie to a one-year, non-guaranteed contract on Friday night. The financial figures weren’t revealed. With this arrangement, the 27-year-old pitcher has been given a spot on Atlanta’s 40-man roster. But he will be owed just a portion of his contract if released before the end of Spring Training. Gillispie made his MLB debut on Aug. 4 against the Orioles, but he spent most of this season in Cleveland’s Minor League system. He allowed four hits and two earned runs in eight innings over three appearances before being sent back down. He posted a 4.05 ERA in 27 appearances (15 starts) for Triple-A Columbus this year. With Joe Jiménez expected to miss most or all of the 2025 season, closer Raisel Iglesias, Pierce Johnson, Aaron Bummer, Daysbel Hernandez, Grant Holmes and Dylan Lee are currently Atlanta’s only projected bullpen members. Gillispie's experience as a starter could make him a long relief candidate."
MLB News,The top 10 moments of Larry Walker's HOF career,https://www.mlb.com/news/larry-walker-top-career-moments,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 02:25:00 GMT",,"Thomas Harding After a distinguished career, Larry Walker was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2020, receiving 76.6 percent of votes to join Derek Jeter in that year's class. It took until his final year of BBWAA ballot eligibility for his greatness to be rewarded, accomplished mostly with the Rockies but with stellar play for the Expos and the Cardinals at either end of his career, but now his career lives forever in Cooperstown. As Walker celebrates a birthday, let’s look back at a career full of great feats and much flair. Here is a top 10 list to savor. 1. He taketh away: July 4, 1992, Expos at Padres The Padres’ Tony Fernández had what he thought was a line-drive single to right. The call by Padres broadcaster Ted Leitner was classic: “Base hit … I take it back.” Walker erased plenty of pitchers this way. But an All-Star infielder? 2. He made us laugh as well as cheer: April 4, 1994, Expos at Dodgers; July 8, 1997, All-Star Game Walker was always quick with the quip and smile off the field, and as he showed on a couple of occasions, he could laugh at himself during competition. Forget how many outs? Go into self-preservation mode with intimidating future Hall of Famer Randy Johnson on the mound in an All-Star Game? Walker could have a good time, either way. 3. Special man, special place: April 26, 1995, Mets vs. Rockies While with the Expos in 1993 and ’94, Walker became swept up in the mania at Mile High Stadium, and told his agent that he would love to sign with the Rockies when he became a free agent in ’95. In his first Rockies game, which also was the Coors Field opener, he doubled three times. His last two-bagger tied the game in the ninth and, eventually, set up Dante Bichette’s 14th-inning walk-off homer. 4. When it counted: Oct. 1, 1995, Giants vs. Rockies Some voters at times fell back on docking Walker for not playing in enough big games. But in the 1995 regular-season finale, the 3-year-old Rockies needed to beat the Giants to earn the National League Wild Card and become the youngest expansion franchise at the time to make the postseason. His bat was key to overcoming an early 8-2 deficit in the 10-9 win. Walker went 3-for-4 with two runs, a double, a homer and three RBIs -- to bring his total to 101 in 131 games during a labor strife-shortened season. 5. A hat trick in Montreal: April 5, 1997, Rockies at Expos By the time of his third homer, Walker's old fans at Olympic Stadium were cheering him. Manager Don Baylor wanted him to go for four, but Walker asked to come out of the game so teammate John Vander Wal could get an at-bat to stay sharp.

Validation: Sept. 26, 1997, Dodgers vs. Rockies Sometimes, folks just have to recognize greatness. Walker flirted with .400 for a good portion of the year, made the final of the Home Run Derby before falling to Tino Martinez and finished so strong -- .366/.452/.720 with 49 home runs and 130 RBIs -- that writers couldn’t deny him the NL Most Valuable Player Award. No Rockies player won before or has won since. 7. Outer space and outta here: Aug. 18, 1999, Braves vs. Rockies Remember the widely panned futuristic uniform experiment? Walker's two homers -- an opposite-field shot off Kevin Millwood in the first inning, a three-run walk-off blast against John Rocker -- somehow made the black jersey a classic look. 8. Winning with the arm: April 2, 2001, Cardinals vs. Rockies The Rockies’ signing of Mike Hampton to (at the time) the largest contract for an MLB pitcher turned out to be a brief and forgettable chapter in club history. But it sure started exciting, thanks in big part to Walker’s arm. In the first inning, Fernando Viña attempted to score from third on a Mark McGwire fly ball, but Walker executed an on-the-fly strike to home plate for Brent Mayne’s tag. Walker’s two-run homer in the eighth capped an 8-0 victory. 9. He’s still got it: June 25, 2004, Rockies at Indians The Rockies were struggling and wanting to go young. Multiple trade possibilities had fallen through, but a deal was inevitable. As if sending a message that his new team would be getting someone special, Walker went off in Cleveland by going 3-for-4 with three homers, including the go-ahead shot in the 10th inning of a 10-8 win. 10. Pleasing the people in red: 2004 stint with Cardinals Walker debuted with the Cardinals on Aug. 7, 2004, in such a St. Louis way. Fans gave him a lengthy standing ovation before his pinch-hit at-bat against the Mets’ Kris Benson. Amid calls of “Larry! Larry! Larry!” Walker struck out. But man did he give them much to cheer. He cracked 11 home runs in 44 games, and six in the postseason before the Cards fell to the Red Sox in the World Series. Walker had retired by the time the Cards won the '06 Fall Classic, but the organization showed such respect that it granted him a World Series ring."
MLB News,The Crawford Boxes didn't make Alex Bregman,https://www.mlb.com/news/alex-bregman-free-agent-home-road-splits,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 19:31:00 GMT",Third baseman has almost identical OPS on home and on road,"Mike Petriello Unlike Juan Soto, a generational hitter who is going to be productive no matter where he plays, Alex Bregman is the type of hitter who – according to popular opinion – would be massively affected if he left the short porches of what was until recently Minute Maid Park in Houston. It’s not hard to see why that feeling persists, either: You already know how this gag goes: We share something that seems true, and then tell you why it’s not true, so let’s just get the punchline out of the way. Over the course of his career, Bregman has no discernable home/road split whatsoever ... … and, like many players who don’t call Coors Field home, his annual splits have been wildly inconsistent over the years, fluctuating in one direction or the other. In some years, like in 2017 (that's right, 2017) and 2019, he’s hit better on the road. In some years, like in 2018 and 2022, he’s hit much better at home. In 2024, there was barely any difference at all. For the most part, it’s up-and-down. If there’s evidence that he’s a mere product of his home field in Houston, we’re not seeing it here. But: Why? How is it that a medium-powered hitter with a swing geared for a very friendly landing spot in his home park hasn’t actually been meaningfully better at home? We have two ideas. 1. First things first: Houston’s home field is not the right-handed home run haven you think it is. We’ve all seen it, of course. It’s a moderately-hit fly ball to left that’s a lazy fly ball in every other park, but just ever so barely sneaks over the wall in what will now be known as Daikin Park. It happened to Ronel Blanco just last summer, as one example of several. Bregman himself has benefited from it too, certainly, like in 2022 when he hit a ball not that hard (94.1 MPH) and not that far (341 feet) and ended up with a home run out of it anyway. It’s not that those things never happen. It’s just that they don’t happen nearly as often as you think, and if you were to look at Statcast park factors for right-handed hitters over the last three years, you’ll learn something interesting. Daikin Park has been almost exactly average park for righty batters, and only slightly above-average for homers, where it ranks tied for 11th. There's a whole lot of ""that's average, or close to it,"" so far as Houston park factors go. Why? We’ve been talking about this since at least 2018, that the park is better for pitchers than you think, and way back in 2005 the New York Times was on it about the park's neutrality. In 2023 the Athletic spoke to visiting hitters who claimed that the batter's eye wasn’t favorable for seeing the ball – and it’s worth noting the team did make changes to that backdrop both in Sept. 2023 and in Aug. 2024 in response. That can be seen somewhat in the fact that the hard-hit rate factor is near the bottom over the last three years – hard to hit it hard if you can’t see it well, we suppose – but if we’re talking about homers, then it might come down to the fact that since 2021, Houston batters have 419 homers at home, and 428 on the road. It’s essentially identical. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. So, the park isn't really what you think it is. Turns out, neither is Bregman. 2. While Bregman is a pull guy, he’s not only hitting cheapies either. Because Bregman isn’t of Aaron Judge-esque stature (he’s listed as 6 feet, 190 lbs.), and because he’s hardly a Giancarlo Stanton-like exit velocity god (he’s maxed out at only 109 MPH, and that happened only twice in his entire career), and because he is essentially a pull-only homer hitter (84% of his homers have been pulled, one of the highest rates on record since Statcast tracking began in 2015), it’s easy to think that the Crawford Boxes are responsible for creating his homers. Again: It’s not that it’s never happened. In May, MLB.com’s Theo DeRosa investigated those “stadium specials,” the kind of “out in just 1 of 30 parks” cheapie homers that you’re very familiar with in Yankee Stadium’s right field, among selected other places. It is true that Bregman was tied with DJ LeMahieu for the most of those types of homers, with 10, ahead of Aaron Judge and Jose Altuve. (Yes, there’s a home-field theme here.) It’s just that 10 out of 191 career homers over nine seasons is just really not very many. It’s one per season. It’s also not recent. There were 595 of those “out in only 1 of 30 parks” home runs in 2024, playoffs included, and Bregman didn’t hit a single one of them. (Gleyber Torres had the most, with three, all at Yankee Stadium, one coming off of Michael Wacha in the pivotal Game 5 of the ALDS.) Bregman hasn’t actually done this since June 2023, when he took Jacob Webb out for a grand slam, and he’s actually done it just four times in the last five seasons – once in 2021, once in 2022, and twice in 2023. So what’s happening here? It’s mostly that while he only hits moderate exit velocity homers to left field is true, those home runs he hits aren’t just created by the Crawford Boxes is also true. When he hits them that way, they stay hit. His first homer of the year certainly doesn’t look, visually, like anything Judge has hit, but it was also out in all 30 ballparks. When he took Simeon Woods-Richardson out of the yard in June, it was well past the Crawford Boxes, and would have been out in 29 of the 30 parks – everywhere but Baltimore. It’s that last part – a homer everywhere but Baltimore – that’s key here. It’s not that a moderately-powered hitter like Bregman can’t be affected by ballparks, because he can. It’s just that it’s probably less “he badly needs Houston to prop him up,” and more that “there’s a few specific ballparks where this profile would not work out well,” parks that eat up right-handed power due to dimensions or atmosphere, like in San Francisco, or Pittsburgh, or Miami, Baltimore (depending on how the again-changed left field plays), or Seattle, or St. Louis, – or Detroit, a popularly-suggested destination both due to the Tigers' need for offense and Bregman’s association with former Astros manager AJ Hinch. Maybe Soto, or Pete Alonso, can muscle the ball out of any park. Bregman likely can’t. Which means that the primary goal shouldn’t be “staying in Houston,” so much as it is avoiding the places listed above – or managing to get himself to stronger right-handed power parks, be they places unlikely to sign him (Colorado, Cincinnati, Los Angeles [Dodgers]), or teams that are more plausible landing spots (Phillies, Red Sox, Blue Jays). As Davy Andrews wrote recently, Fenway may be the most ideal home for this profile, as Bregman is the only player in history with at least 60 regular season plate appearances there and an OPS north of 1.200. If there is a concern here, it’s this: Bregman’s once-vaunted plate discipline wasn’t quite so disciplined last year. His usually-excellent walk rate declined in half, to a below-average 6%; his once-strong sprint speed, which had been in the 83rd percentile as a rookie, is down to a below-average 32nd percentile. It’s not that he’s not aging, and it’s not that there’s nothing at all to give you pause about what kind of future he has. But it’s probably going to be a lot more about the fact that he’s a ballplayer in his thirties than it is that he’s possibly no longer going to have the Crawford Boxes to take aim at."

They were tripped up on a visit to Ohio — a snowy one, in a loss to Cleveland on a Thursday night — but after the mini-bye, they're back in the Buckeye State, and trying to avoid getting tagged again, this time by Cincinnati. The Bengals are a great passing team, leading the league in yards per game, but they're in dire straits with five one-score losses to teams that would be in the playoffs today. They may need to win out to have a shot at the playoffs, but in any single game, Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase can make a massive difference. In the NFC, the Cardinals are in Minnesota to face the quietly 9-2 Vikings. Arizona is tied for the NFC West lead, but the Vikings have been as steady as they come at the top of the NFC this year. Yes, they play in maybe the toughest division in football — the NFC North has three of the league's nine eight-win teams heading into Week 13 — but they can take another step toward securing a playoff spot with a win over a division contender at home.

They beat City 2-0, and the simplest evidence of the shift is now the EPL table. The Reds lead by a whopping nine points, with City 11 points back in fifth place. But the best evidence was all over the Anfield pitch. Liverpool mauled the four-time defending champs for most of the 90 minutes. In the first half, they extinguished a once-prolific City attack by swarming the ball, biting into tackles, and repelling any attempt to build possession before City had even reached midfield. The home side scored within 12 minutes, via Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mohamed Salah and finally Cody Gakpo. LIVERPOOL LEAD. ANFIELD ERUPTS. IT'S CODY GAKPO WITH THE BREAKTHROUGH.📺 USA Network | #LIVMCI pic.twitter.com/nKjEPWGg2v — NBC Sports Soccer (@NBCSportsSoccer) December 1, 2024 And they really should have scored more. Virgil van Dijk pinged the post with one header; he narrowly missed with two others. Gakpo and Salah skied great chances. As a collective, through 60 minutes, the Reds had created 2.3 Expected Goals (xG) — a measure of chance quality and quantity — to City’s 0.2. City steadied throughout the second half. But on 78 minutes, a Salah penalty sealed the deal. And over 90 minutes, the one-way flow of traffic was overwhelming, and the conclusion clear. Because this was not just one game. It was a continuation and convergence of two distinct trends: while City has slipped and splintered, Liverpool has soared to the top of the league. Both trends seem sustainable; neither has shown signs of abating; and so, until further notice, this is how the balance of Premier League power is. The Reds, under new coach Arne Slot, have meshed the most devastating aspects of Jurgen Klopp’s heavy-metal football with technical quality, opportunistic counter-attacking and impressive control. They have now won seven straight in all competitions. They’ve established themselves as the 2024-25 title favorites, and the most complete team in the league. City, on the other hand, have now lost four straight in the league. They haven’t won in seven games across all competitions — the longest winless run of Pep Guardiola's managerial career. They look flawed and old, like a fallen power clinging to battle plans that banged-up soldiers can no longer execute. They have been vulnerable without Rodri, the Ballon d'Or winner whose ACL tore in September. They have sputtered in the final third, with Erling Haaland's supporting cast looking rather ordinary. They have failed to replace Rodri or adjust without him. They have failed to acclimatize to their new reality. They have failed to recalibrate a team that once bossed games and hummed up and down the field like a well-oiled machine. As all of that crystallized Sunday under the lights at Anfield, joyous Liverpool fans sang to Guardiola: ""You're getting sacked in the morning! Sacked in the mooooorning!"" Guardiola smiled, and, in response, held up six fingers — presumably one for each of the Premier League titles he has won. Liverpool fans, though, sauntered off into the Mersyside night knowing that No. 7 probably won't be coming to Guardiola's trophy cabinet, and to Manchester City, anytime soon."

According to ESPN, the school is firing coach Ryan Walters after his second season. Purdue was 1-11 in 2024 and just 5-19 in Walters’ two seasons in charge. The Boilermakers capped the season Saturday night with a 66-0 rivalry game loss to No. 10 Indiana. It’s the worst loss Purdue has suffered to Indiana in the history of the Old Oaken Bucket rivalry. Purdue ended the season on an 11-game losing streak and its only win came against FCS-level Indiana State. Outside of a 50-49 overtime loss at Wisconsin, the Boilermakers weren’t really close to winning any other games either. Purdue was outscored 40-16 on the season and lost six games by at least 35 points. The Boilermakers were possibly the worst power conference team in the country. Walters, 38, was hired after he spent two seasons as Illinois’ defensive coordinator. Before he was at Illinois, Walters was an assistant at Missouri and was the Tigers’ defensive coordinator for three seasons. Before getting into coach, Walters played defensive back at Colorado. Despite his defensive background, Walters took over the offensive play-calling duties during the season. Before the loss to Illinois, Walters installed himself as the offensive play-caller. It was the first time he’d called offensive plays in his coaching career. Purdue is the third power conference school to have a head coaching vacancy. North Carolina fired coach Mack Brown before its season finale and UCF coach Gus Malzahn resigned Saturday to take the offensive coordinator job at Florida State."

Max Verstappen won the race as Lando Norris had to pit from second place to serve a 10-second drive-through penalty for failing to slow under a yellow flag. In the middle of the race, a wing mirror from someone’s car had fallen off and sat in the middle of the main straight for numerous laps. Race officials simply waved yellow flags at the end of the straight instead of summoning a safety car or calling for a virtual safety car to pick the mirror up. As officials waited to do something about the mirror, Valtteri Bottas ran it over and the mirror broke into myriad pieces. Those pieces then appeared to cause front tire punctures for both Lewis Hamilton and Carlos Sainz. After the two drivers had tire failures, F1 finally summoned a safety car. Norris’ penalty happened in the laps where the intact mirror sat on track. He was forced to pit with 12 laps to go and 10th while posting the fastest lap. As Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc finished second and his teammate Carlos Sainz was sixth and Norris’ McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri was third, Ferrari gained nine points on McLaren and now trails by 21 points heading into the season finale in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 8. The victory is Verstappen's ninth of the season. He clinched the 2024 title a week ago in Las Vegas. Polesitter George Russell finished fourth ahead of Alpine's Pierre Gasly in fifth. The race featured three safety car periods including one on lap one when Nico Hulkenberg, Franco Colapinto and Esteban Ocon collided at the back of the pack. The crash ended the day for both Colapinto and Ocon. The second safety car came after the mirror fiasco and the third happened as Hulkenberg and Sergio Perez both had problems as the race restarted.

According to NFL.com, the former Atlanta Falcons coach and current Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator has taken himself out of the running for the job. A North Carolina alum, Smith had been in preliminary contact with UNC administrators. The school announced last week that it was firing coach Mack Brown at the end of the season. North Carolina lost 35-30 to rival NC State on Saturday to drop to 6-6 on the season. After the game, NC State players tried to plant a flag on the North Carolina logo at midfield and Tar Heels players didn’t take too kindly to that. Flag planting was a theme on Saturday. NC State - UNC fight that starts after trying to plant flags on mid field logo 🤯 pic.twitter.com/kVY3XyuhER — College Football Alerts  (@CFBAlerts_) December 1, 2024 Brown had said that he planned to to return for the 2025 season after North Carolina was blown out by Boston College in Week 13. A day later, North Carolina announced that the longtime coach would not be retained for the 2025 season. Brown coached Saturday’s loss, a game that will be his final one with the school. Brown said afterward that he would not coach in whatever bowl game the Tar Heels play in. Smith, 42, is in his first season as Pittsburgh’s offensive coordinator following his stint as the Falcons’ head coach. He coached the Falcons for three seasons after serving as an assistant with the Tennessee Titans from 2011-2020. He got his coaching start with North Carolina as a graduate assistant in 2006. Depending on how the coaching carousel shakes out, North Carolina could be the biggest job that opens up ahead of the 2025 season. The Tar Heels were the first power conference team to make a head coaching move and UCF is the only outer power conference program with a head coaching opening as of Sunday morning. Saturday night, Knights coach Gus Malzahn resigned to reportedly take the offensive coordinator job at Florida State."
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games","Giants wanted Daniel Jones to stay home, with pay",https://sports.yahoo.com/giants-wanted-daniel-jones-stay-002443851.html,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:24:43 GMT",Setting the record straight on why Jones asked to be released.,"On Thursday, Fox's Tom Brady criticized former Giants quarterback Daniel Jones for asking to be released, after he was benched for business reasons. Brady prefaced his comments by saying this: “I don’t know how that whole situation went down. . . ."" So we did the legwork for him. Here's what we learned, per a source with knowledge of the events. For starters, the Giants initially wanted Jones to stay home, with pay. That's what happened in Las Vegas two years ago, after Derek Carr was benched. (Carr, we're told, asked to go home, and the Raiders decided it was the best approach.) The player has to be willing to stay home; he can't be locked out. The rule dates back to Steve McNair's grievance against the Titans in 2006. After they drafted Vince Young, the Titans didn't want McNair to get injured while on the premises, triggering his otherwise non-guaranteed salary. McNair and the NFL Players Association fought it, they won, and they set a precedent that teams cannot keep a player from showing up for work for non-disciplinary reasons. There's nothing wrong with the Giants wanting Jones to stay home. It's the natural extension of their decision to take him out of the lineup. But the request for Jones to stay home laid the foundation for Jones eventually asking to be released. His first choice, we're told, was to remain active — and to help the other quarterbacks prepare to win games. When he decided not to stay home, the Giants altered his workout program, in order to minimize if not eliminate the possibility of injury. He wasn't going to be throwing at practice, and his lifting program was significantly restricted. All in the name of keeping him healthy. Business considerations prevented Jones from doing anything to help the team. No real practice (other than scout-team, walk-through safety), no throwing, limited lifting. He wasn't getting ready to play, because he wouldn't have played. He wasn't permitted to participate in practice, because they didn't want to risk triggering his $23 million injury guarantee for 2023. Again, there's nothing wrong with the Giants wanting to avoid the injury guarantee. But that helps explain Jones's eventual decision to ask to be released. Brady, we're told, didn't reach out to Jones or his representation to obtain an explanation as to why Jones asked to be released. It's easy for Brady to say he would have handled the situation differently, because he was never put in that situation during his 20-plus year career. What would he have done if the Patriots or Buccaneers had benched him for business reasons, asked him to go home with pay, and then kept him from practicing when he said he wanted to stay? Also, Brady left his New England teammates in free agency after the 2019 season. After the 2021 season, he retired. Roughly a month later, he came back. In the interim, an effort was undertaken to lure him to Dolphins; it has never been suggested that Brady wasn't on board with the plan to pair him with Sean Payton in Miami, after Brady had essentially quit on the Buccaneers. Then, during 2022 training camp, Brady left the team for more than a week. We'll stipulate that Brady had good reasons for every single business decision he made. So would he have wanted Greg Olsen or Tony Romo or Cris Collinsworth or Troy Aikman or Kirk Herbstreit to make assumptions during massive broadcast windows about Brady's motivations and his actions? Or would Brady have wanted them to make a phone call or two in search of, you know, facts? For $37.5 million per year from Fox, Brady should be expected to spend a little time getting the player's side of the story before casting aspersions before a crowd of 38.5 million."
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Fantasy Football Week 13 Start 'Em Sit 'Em,https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy-football-week-13-start-em-sit-em-155912543.html,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024 15:59:12 GMT",Fantasy football analyst Dalton Del Don delivers his game-by-game lineup advice for the main Week 13 slate.,"Set your Week 13 lineups with Dalton Del Don's key start/sit advice for every game on the slate. Herbert has been fantasy’s QB9 over the last five games, and the Chargers will likely continue to rely more on the pass with J.K. Dobbins out. The Falcons have yielded the 10th fewest fantasy points to RBs but the seventh most to QBs this season. Atlanta has ceded multiple TD passes in seven straight games, allowing a whopping 18 over that span. The Chargers have a healthy 24.25-point implied total, so Herbert is a top-five QB this week. Pickens is coming off a quiet game, but he saw the second-most air yards (143) last week. Pickens’ prorated season stats during games with Russell Wilson would be 136 targets, 88 catches, 1,404 receiving yards and 7 touchdowns. His fantasy production has seen a 60.2% boost with Wilson compared to Justin Fields this season. The Bengals have been a pass-funnel defense over the last five games, when they’ve allowed the second most schedule-adjusted fantasy points to wide receivers but the second fewest to running backs. Etienne will return to splitting work with Bigsby, who was back practicing in full this week. Houston has allowed the sixth-fewest fantasy points to running backs this season, and Jacksonville has an implied team total of just 20.25 points. Bigsby’s averaged 16.7 fantasy points (0.5 PPR) in games without Etienne this season but just 6.8 with him. Etienne has struggled even without Bigsby, so both backs are bench candidates in Week 13. Conner has a 48% carry share over Arizona’s last three games, while rookie Trey Benson has a 29% share over that span. Conner leads the league in evaded tackles and continues to see work in the passing game, but he’s losing work overall and gets the league’s toughest matchup this week. The Vikings have allowed just 62.3 RB rushing yards per game, an NFL-low five rushing touchdowns and by far the lowest EPA/rush. Vikings’ opponents have averaged the fewest rushing attempts per game (20.9) this season. Meanwhile, Kyler Murray has gotten just 5.4 YPA against zone coverage, which Minnesota has used at the league’s second-highest rate (79.5%). Murray has also struggled against the blitz and two-high coverage (25th in fantasy points/dropback), which are two features of Brian Flores’ defense. Minnesota has ceded an NFL-low 8.6 rushing yards per game to quarterbacks. Moreover, Marvin Harrison Jr.’s target rate falls from 30.3% against man down to 18% versus zone, while his fantasy points per route run takes a similar tumble (0.65 to 0.34). Harrison Jr. hasn’t seen more than seven targets in a game since Week 3, and no wide receiver in the top 60 is averaging fewer fantasy points per game if you removed touchdowns. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Murray has the same number of top-five QB weekly finishes (four) this season as he does bottom 10. There is admitted risk he goes off on your bench against a Minnesota pass-funnel defense allowing the second most pass attempts per game (37.9). Conner is the RB21 in this week’s “expert consensus ranks,” so you may not have better alternatives. But at minimum, temper expectations for Conner, Murray and Harrison Jr. this week. Here’s a sleeper for this week. Josh Downs and Ashton Dulin are out for Week 13, while Alec Pierce will reportedly play through a foot injury that could limit his effectiveness, so Mitchell could be looking at a vastly expanded role Sunday. Michael Pittman Jr. will likely be shadowed by Christian Gonzalez, and Mitchell has seen his target rate (43.2%) and fantasy points per route run (0.49) skyrocket against man coverage, which the Patriots have used as the league’s second highest rate (40.2%). Mitchell hasn’t experienced much success with Anthony Richardson this season, but AR played far better than the box score indicated last week, and his willingness to throw downfield appears like a good fit for the rookie WR. If there’s a player who’s widely available (just 4% rostered) on waiver wires who could make an impact this week, it’s Mitchell. The Jets’ defense has unquestionably fallen off since firing Robert Saleh, but they’ve allowed just two passing touchdowns and have the league’s second-highest pressure rate over the last four games. For the season, New York has yielded the third-fewest passing yards per game (197.2) and the fewest passing touchdowns (five). DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett were cleared to play, but likely aren't 100 percent. The Seahawks’ defense ranks fourth in EPA/play since trading for Ernest Jones, so game script may not call for much passing in this slow-paced matchup. Sit Smith this week. Pollard won’t likely see a 94% snap share or quite as big of a workload as he did last week with Tyjae Spears returning to a full practice Thursday and Friday, but he should remain in fantasy lineups. The Commanders have yielded 4.8 YPC, the fifth-most EPA/rush and the second-most RB rushing yards per game (120.8). Will Levis is playing much better, and the Titans defense should help keep the game script manageable. Start Pollard even if Spears returns. Irving’s big game last week could’ve been massive if not for being tackled at the one-yard line on two separate drives and losing fourth-quarter work in the blowout. He out-snapped and ran more routes than Rachaad White for the first time this season. Irving is first in the league in yards after contact per rush (4.2), and he ranks top five both in YPC and yards per route run. Irving has been fantasy’s RB11 since Week 6 despite seeing less than 50% of the snaps over that span, as he quite simply looks like one of the NFL’s best running backs right now. Irving will continue to lose some work in Tampa Bay’s backfield, but he should remain in fantasy lineups in a prime matchup this week. Carolina has allowed the most rush attempts per game (27.5), rush yards per game (129.5), touchdowns (16) and schedule-adjusted fantasy points to running backs. Bryce Young has undeniably looked far better recently, but the Buccaneers are 6-point road favorites Sunday, so game script should be favorable. Tampa Bay also sports one of the league’s highest implied team total (26.25 points), so treat Irving as a top-12 back this week. Stafford has been fantasy’s QB43 (8.9 fpg) in five games without both Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua on the field this season; he’s been the QB8 (19.0 fpg) during five games with the wide receivers. Stafford’s season pace would be 4,887.5 passing yards and 37.4 touchdowns with Kupp and Nacua on the field, and that includes facing the league’s current best defense last week. The Saints have allowed the eighth-most schedule-adjusted fantasy points to QBs over the last five games. The Rams have one of the league’s highest projected totals (26 points) in a fast-paced matchup against a depleted and vulnerable New Orleans’ secondary. Stafford is the QB14 in “expert consensus ranks” this week, but he’s my QB4. Jalen Hurts has averaged just 21.3 pass attempts over the last six games, but more volume should be there in this fast-paced matchup. Baltimore has allowed the fewest RB rushing yards per game (60.5), while Ravens’ opponents have averaged by far the most pass attempts (39.2) this season. Moreover, Goedert saw a 33.3% first-read target share last week without DeVonta Smith. The wideout returned to a limited practice Thursday and Friday, but is reportedly trending toward sitting. Smith likely won't be 100% even if he’s able to suit up. Fire up Goedert against a pass-funnel defense in a matchup with this week’s highest total (51.0 points). Samuel is the WR43 in fantasy points per game this season, sandwiched between Quentin Johnston and Rashod Bateman. He’s the WR42 in expected fantasy points, just behind Allen Lazard. Whether it’s injuries or recovering from pneumonia, Samuel simply hasn’t looked like nearly the same player this year. He’s committed multiple drops and ranks #118 out of 123 pass catchers in ESPN’s Open Score. Samuel feels “due” for a breakout game, and the 49ers are getting the second most yards per play (6.3) and due for red-zone regression. But San Francisco’s offense was a disaster without Brock Purdy and Trent Williams last week. Purdy is reportedly on track to return, though he likely isn't 100 percent, while Williams will sit again. The 49ers have the second-lowest implied team total (19.25 points) this week in a windy game with temperatures in the 20s. The Bills have let a WR eclipse 16.1 fantasy points during just one game all season, so Samuel is a bench candidate Sunday night. Chubb saw season highs in snap share (64%), rush yards (59) and carries (20) last week, but his fantasy day was only saved by two short touchdown runs. He’s getting just 3.0 YPC and averaging only 1.4 targets (and 1.4 receiving yards) over five games since returning from another serious multi-ligament knee surgery. Chubb remains a threat to score at the goal line, but he gets a tough matchup this week. The Broncos have allowed the second-fewest rush yards before contact per attempt (0.8) and the third-fewest rushing scores (six) this season. Denver has been vulnerable to receiving backs, but Chubb ran only eight routes last week, and the Broncos have ceded the fourth fewest schedule-adjusted rush fantasy points to RBs over the last five games. The Browns have issues at left tackle and a lowly 18-point implied total, so Chubb deserves bench consideration Monday night."

""You look at, offensively, what they've been able to do,"" he said. ""The system, coach (Kevin) O'Connell, his staff, just a lot of good things happening across the board -- as a team, as an organization but on offense especially. So just excited to join that and help out wherever I can."" O'Connell was the Washington Commanders' offensive coordinator in 2019 when Jones entered the NFL Draft as a first-round prospect from Duke. ""He played the position in the league and has a lot of experience as a coach,"" Jones said of O'Connell, who lasted five NFL seasons (2008-12) before getting into coaching in 2015. ""I got to know him through the draft a little bit when he was in Washington, so that was cool. His system's been successful. He knows quarterback play, knows how to build the quarterback environment and I think just being a part of that and learning from him and his whole staff was a great opportunity for me."" In 70 games (69 starts) over six seasons with the Giants, Jones went 24-44-1 while completing 1,437 of 2,241 passes for 14,582 yards and 70 touchdowns to 47 interceptions. He rounded out his production with 399 rushes for 2,179 yards and 15 touchdowns while fumbling 50 times. ""You're always looking to grow and improve and to work on your craft, see where you can get better and pick up on certain things,"" said Jones, who joins a position group that has former Jets quarterback Sam Darnold as the starter. ""So, yeah, I'm looking forward to that but more so just to help out -- to be part of a good quarterback room, part of a good offense and see where I can help."""

No. 3 Texas clinched a spot in the SEC title game with a 17-7 win over No. 20 Texas A&M. The early portion of the day already delivered some big surprises, with Michigan shocking No. 2 Ohio State 13-10 to end OSU's Big Ten title hopes. And then, No. 6 Miami saw its ACC title hopes slip away with a 42-38 loss to unranked Syracuse. Might that cost Miami a shot at the playoff as well? One team that won't need to worry about its playoff status is No. 5 Notre Dame, which secured its spot in the field with a 49-35 win over USC.

Rivalry week matchups are always heated with tensions and resentments building. But four annual clashes ended with fights between opponents when the winning road team attempted to plant a flag on the home field of their adversary to punctuate a victory. Each scuffle was notable for different reasons. But they were all provoked by similar sentiments. The victors wanted to make a statement, while the defeated wanted to protect their home turf and prevent further indignity. The melee receiving the biggest spotlight occurred at the end of Michigan's 13-10 win over Ohio State in Columbus. Wolverines players brought a maize flag bearing the block ""M"" out to midfield and thrust it into the Ohio Stadium turf. The Buckeyes took exception to the gesture and confronted their opponents, resulting in several players pushing and shoving each other, with punches being thrown. A fight has broken out between Michigan and Ohio State after The Game pic.twitter.com/XPwdAjfYzN — FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) November 30, 2024 Unfortunately, what made the Michigan-Ohio State fight stand out was coaches, security personnel and police getting involved to break up the conflict. In the process, law enforcement officers used pepper spray to subdue players, with several bystanders also being affected. Michigan players on the sideline after the altercation between Ohio State and Michigan pic.twitter.com/m5tdgIOma4 — FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) November 30, 2024 Ohio State University Police issued a statement on social media saying the matter was being investigated. ""Following the game, officers from multiple law enforcement agencies assisted in breaking up an on-field altercation,"" the statement read. ""During the scuffle, multiple officers representing Ohio and Michigan deployed pepper spray. OSUPD is the lead agency for games & will continue to investigate."" A similar scuffle broke out after North Carolina State's 35-30 win over North Carolina in Chapel Hill. Following the victory, which made the Wolfpack bowl eligible, NC State players brought a red school flag to the middle of the field with the intention of planting it into the turf. However, Tar Heels players confronted their opponents to stop them from spearing the flag into Kenan Memorial Stadium's field. Pushing and shoving quickly resulted and North Carolina's Tylee Craft eventually took the flag and attempted to throw it into the stands. Wolfpack players DK Kaufman and Jacarrius Peak shoved Craft before coaches stepped in.

""Somebody said they tried to plant their flag on our field. I had said two years ago that was disrespectful.” Coaches were more directly involved in the skirmish after Florida defeated Florida State, 31-11. Gators defensive end George Gumbs Jr. planted a black Florida flag into the grass at FSU's Doak Campbell Stadium. Florida State players led by Jeremiah Byers and Julian Armella ran to midfield to pull the flag out, which led to the two teams fighting. No midfield logo is safe!!! pic.twitter.com/cqJzsBHNaF — College Sports Only (@CollegeSportsO) December 1, 2024 Seminoles coach Mike Norvell got his hands on the flag and tossed it aside. He then confronted Florida coach Billy Napier and let his counterpart know that he didn't like what happened. “I told him what I thought. They won the game — they have the right to celebrate just like we have in previous years,” Norvell said afterward, via Tomahawk Nation. “If you want to come do that, that is your decision you can have within the team — but I told him what I thought.” Napier didn't endorse the flag-planting and apologized for the incident. ""Obviously what happened there at the end of the game is not who we want to be as a program,"" Napier said, via the Associated Press. ""It's embarrassing to me and it's a distraction from a really well played football game. I want to apologize on behalf of the entire organization just in terms of how we represented the university there. We shouldn't have done that. We won't do that moving forward. And there will be consequences for all involved."" Many of Napier's fellow coaches might express similar sentiments to their players after what happened this weekend. Flags weren't the only object planted by the victorious road team in a rivalry game on Saturday. After No. 16 Arizona State's 49-7 win over Arizona, Sun Devils defensive lineman Jacob Rich Kongaika — who played his previous two seasons with the Wildcats — took their mascot's signature pitchfork and stabbed it into the midfield logo at Arizona Stadium.

Speaking to reporters afterward, Wildcats running back Quali Conley said Kongaika's actions were ""disrespectful."" ""That's our field. Just doing that was disrespectful,"" Conley said. ""I just feel like that was uncalled for."" Asked about the fight by PHNX Sports, Arizona State star running back Cam Skattebo said, ""I didn't know that happened, but that's awesome."""

No. 3 Texas beat the No. 20 Aggies 17-7 on Saturday night to clinch a spot in the SEC title game against Georgia on Dec. 7. It was the first game between the longtime rivals since the two teams last shared a conference in 2011. The Longhorns sealed the game with a fourth-quarter goal-line stand with 4:35 to go. Instead of kicking a field goal to cut the lead to one possession, Texas A&M elected to go for a TD on fourth down and cut the lead to three. It didn't even come close to working out for the Aggies. HORNS GOALLINE STAND 🤯@TexasFootball x 📺 ABC pic.twitter.com/kzqxpQX6Q9 — Southeastern Conference (@SEC) December 1, 2024 Texas (11-1, 7-1 SEC) was then able to run the clock down inside the two-minute warning as Texas A&M used its timeouts. Once the Aggies got the ball back, Texas forced a fumble with 1:29 to go to seal the win. Texas jumped out to a 17-0 lead at halftime and had multiple opportunities to put the game away in the second half. But mistakes allowed the Aggies to hang around in the second half. QB Quinn Ewers threw an interception and fumbled deep in Texas A&M territory and a blocked punt preceded the Longhorns' goal-line stand. Texas A&M’s only points of the night came on Will Lee’s pick-6 of Ewers. After a third-quarter pass was deflected, Lee ran 93 yards for a TD to give the Aggies a glimmer of hope.

A&M had just 248 yards of offense on 57 plays. The Aggies (8-4, 5-3) failed on all three of their fourth-down attempts. “Our defense was fantastic all night, they really shut them out,” Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said after the game on ABC. The Texas offense rode RB Quintrevion Wisner all evening. Wisner had a career-high 33 carries for 186 yards as Texas rushed 50 times for 240 yards and a TD. That score was provided by Arch Manning, who saw limited snaps in Texas A&M territory. Manning opened the scoring in the first quarter when he rushed 15 yards for a TD by diving over the pylon. Mobile Manning™️@ArchManning pic.twitter.com/ahLQVQjne4 — Texas Football (@TexasFootball) December 1, 2024 The Longhorns added to the lead in the second quarter when Ewers threw an inch-perfect pass to Jaydon Blue for a score and then Bert Auburn kicked a field goal. The win should ensure that Texas is in 12-team College Football Playoff no matter what happens against the Bulldogs. An 11-2 Longhorns team with its only losses to the SEC champion would surely not be left out of the field. Especially given what's happened across college football over the past two weekends. A&M, meanwhile, has no shot at the playoff after ending the regular season on a two-game losing streak. The Aggies lost 43-41 at Auburn in four overtimes a week ago, and needed to beat Texas and Georgia to have any chance of making the playoff."

Remember how an 8-5 season last year felt as if it was rock bottom? Well, things have unraveled at USC to the point where the infamous Clay Helton era, in retrospect, is starting to look half-decent. Following a 49-35 defeat to No. 5 Notre Dame at the Coliseum on Saturday, Lincoln Riley has a 25-14 record as USC’s coach. In the same role, Helton was 28-11 through his first 39 games. Read more: USC pushes No. 5 Notre Dame, but fall to Irish after disastrous fourth quarter Once viewed as a savior, Riley has imprisoned USC in a cycle of mediocrity. His shortcomings as have kept the Trojans from even dreaming of realizing their championship ambitions. His eight-figure annual salary pretty much guarantees he won’t be fired anytime soon. A program that defines itself by championships risks becoming irrelevant when there’s an absence of hope, and USC is hopeless at the moment. If there’s a way out of his purgatory, no one can see it, the mounting defeats and shortage of high-end talent obscuring the path ahead. “Finish 6-6 and just really have no clue what we are?” former USC quarterback Matt Leinart posted on social media. “Who we are? There’s no identity. We have good players. Need to recruit harder. As frustrated as anyone. Want to see USC back to being a contender. Don’t think we are close at the moment.” Another former Trojans quarterback, Matt Barkley, was more succinct. “This,” Barkley posted, “is not USC football.” This is USC football now, and this could be USC football for a while. Riley certainly has called into question whether he has the comportment required to clean up his personal Chernobyl. This is the same thin-skinned coach who this year closed practice to the media, the same one who last year suspended a Southern California New Group reporter for alleged violations of the program’s media policy. In the wake of the Notre Dame loss, Riley was asked why he was confident USC could live up to his mandate of competing for championships. Riley wouldn’t say. “This game finished 20 minutes ago,” Riley said. “We’ve got time to go here. I know I get to answer all those. That’s part of being the head coach. I don’t shy away from it. But this is about this team and this moment, these guys that played their last game here at the Coliseum. Read more: Do front offices see USC's Lincoln Riley as a future NFL coach? “I could sit up here for an hour and talk about the things I know are happening within this program. I could rattle off all the stats. I could show you the facilities. I could show you recruiting. I could show you the staff. I could go on about that for an hour, but I just don’t think it’s the appropriate time right now.” Riley’s approach almost certainly didn’t result in a wave of fawning media coverage of USC’s seniors, and it definitely didn’t address the concerns of the tens of thousands of loyal fans who packed the Coliseum, so what did the coach accomplish other than spare himself an unpleasant but entirely necessary line of questioning? While praising quarterback Jayden Maiava, Riley slipped in another reference to the difficulty of USC’s schedule, echoing an opinion he’s shared throughout the season about his team’s record being a reflection of his opposition. The Trojans were never blown out this season, including Saturday. They were ahead 7-0; they tied the game at 14-14 and 21-21. Until Irish cornerback Christian Gray intercepted a pass by Maiava and returned it for a 99-yard touchdown with 3 minutes 39 seconds remaining in the game, the Trojans were down by only a touchdown — 35-28. Their five other losses were by a combined 19 points. The Trojans were in every game they played. Their inability to win these games, however, pointed to another, potentially more disconcerting, problem: their lack of playmakers. Maiava threw some passes that, while difficult to catch, would have been hauled in by the likes of Jordan Addison, Drake London, Amon-Ra St. Brown or Michael Pittman Jr. The Trojans don’t have a player like that. One catch here, one catch there, and the Trojans might have won a few more games. Is this a recruiting problem? Is this a player-development problem? Either way, it’s a Lincoln Riley problem, which means it’s a USC problem.

They started the 2024 Major League Soccer campaign relatively strong, but by the end of the 34-match grind, they'd claimed only 11 victories. For eight months, they epitomized mediocrity. They entered the MLS playoffs as the Eastern Conference's No. 7 seed, with title odds of +5800, as beneficiaries of the bloated format more so than deserving contenders. And yet here they are, 90 minutes from an MLS title. The Red Bulls beat Orlando City 1-0 on Saturday night to advance to MLS Cup, where they'll meet the Los Angeles Galaxy next weekend.

The Red Bulls beat the vaunted Columbus Crew in Round 1, first on the road, then in Game 2 at home on penalties. Atlanta, meanwhile, with all of 10 regular-season wins, upset top-seeded Inter Miami. FC Cincinnati also fell on penalties to sixth-seeded NYCFC. The Red Bulls then beat NYCFC in the quarterfinals. They topped Orlando with a scrappy, solid performance on Saturday in the semis.

He was 99 years old. Carnesecca coached St. John's for 24 seasons. His career in Queens began with his first stint from 1965 to 1970, during which his teams earned three NCAA tournament bids as an independent. He then left for the ABA's New York Nets, for whom he was head coach and general manager from 1970-73. The Nets made the postseason in each of his three seasons. Following the 1972-73 season, Carnesecca returned to St. John's. The Redmen (now the Red Storm) played for three more years as an independent before competing in the New York-New Jersey 7 conference for the next three seasons. His teams made four more NCAA tournaments during that span. In 1979, St. John's joined the Big East conference and became part of an acclaimed era which included John Thompson at Georgetown, Syracuse's Jim Boeheim, Villanova's Rollie Massimino, P.J. Carlesimo at Seton Hall, Boston College's Gary Williams and Jim Calhoun at UConn. ""I am what I am.

That 1984-85 squad had six players who eventually played in the NBA, including Chris Mullin, Walter Berry, Bill Wennington and Mark Jackson. Carnesecca retired from coaching after the 1991-92 season, but he maintained an office on campus for more than 30 years as an assistant to the university president. He was also a regular presence at St. John's home games. Alumni Hall was eventually named Carnesecca Arena. A statue also pays tribute to him there. In his 24 seasons (none with a losing record), Carnesecca compiled a record of 526-200. After his retirement, Carnesecca was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1992.

The Trojans' defense then forced Notre Dame to punt on the next possession, helped by a holding penalty and sack by Jamil Muhammad. A 60-yard punt from James Rendell pushed USC back to its 16-yard line. However, the Trojans drove 63 yards in five plays before Gray's fateful interception demolished the chances of a comeback. Notre Dame's chances for a place in the College Football Playoff looked uncertain after a shocking upset loss to Northern Illinois in its second game of the season. But the Irish won their next 10 games, including Top 25 victories over Louisville, Navy and Army. And Notre Dame opened its season with a win against Texas A&M, one of the top teams in the SEC. The Irish were ranked fifth in the latest iteration of the CFP rankings and will presumably move up after Ohio State's loss to Michigan. Either way, they essentially locked up a home playoff game with the win (they can't get a bye since they are an independent)."

"Yahoo!

Two things have stood in the way of that getting done: Ingram's $36 million salary that is hard to move, and the fact it's the last year of his deal, so he is looking for a team that will sign him to a max or near max new contract. There was enough friction between New Orleans and Ingram that he did not show up for the team’s voluntary offseason workouts, although by all reports he has been professional through this young season. The update on this saga is that there is no update. Through what has been an ugly 4-16 start to the season, the Pelicans are still looking for a trade — one where they take back less money and lower their tax bill — but finding a taker that will sign Ingram long-term is still a problem. Here is what Brian Windhorst wrote at ESPN. Sources told ESPN the two sides can't agree on a contract extension and trade talks since last summer have failed to align. Finding a place where New Orleans can send Ingram's $36 million salary and get value while also reducing salary -- the Pelicans are currently in the luxury tax for the first time ever and not likely to stay there -- is hard enough. But finding a deal with a team Ingram will be comfortable signing a new contract with has also stalled talks, per sources. ESPN’s Tim Bontemps adds that the NBA's new CBA and its tax aprons are adding to the challenge. The league's new collective bargaining agreement continues to cause a lot of friction for teams. Signing a player such as Ingram, a 6-foot-8 forward who has averaged at least 20 points per game for six consecutive seasons, will require a hefty contract next summer. All but a few franchises have limited salary cap space, and teams are reluctant to hard cap themselves with a trade early in the season. The several teams in the second apron aren't even allowed to trade for him. Injuries have decimated the Pelicans through the first 20 games of the season and with Zion Williamson expected to miss a chunk more time due to a hamstring strain, the Pelicans have some hard choices to face. While we may be just one-quarter of the way into the NBA season, the Pelicans are already 6.5 games out of even the last play-in spot in the West and would need to leapfrog five teams — and improve their record to .500 or better — just to get into that conversation. At what point does management start thinking about a pivot to tanking, er... focusing on young players and looking to the NBA Draft? (Nobody in the NBA would actually tank, right?) This is a different situation than Philadephia in the East just because of the conference disparity — the 3-14 Sixers are just four games out of the postseason and don't need to get back to .500 to make it. Philly has time to turn it around, but does New Orleans? None of which makes trading Ingram any easier. Maybe the Pelicans will just ride with him all season as a scorer on a struggling team. Nothing is coming easy for New Orleans this season."

Since playing 75 games in his second year, Ball has appeared in a total of 76 games during the past three seasons. Last season, he played in only 22 games after having surgery on his right ankle and struggling with continued soreness afterward. Ankle injuries limited him to 36 games during the 2022-23 campaign. Charlotte lost forward Grant Williams for the season with a torn ACL last week.

According to ESPN, the UCF coach is stepping down to become the offensive coordinator at Florida State. UCF ended its season on Friday night with a home loss to Utah. The defeat dropped the Knights to 4-8 on the season. “We would like to thank Coach Malzahn for his contributions to our football program over the past four seasons, including our transition into the Big 12 Conference,” the school said in a statement. “We appreciate his professionalism and dedication to our student-athletes throughout his tenure at UCF and wish he and his wife, Kristi, the very best in their future endeavors.” Florida State is 2-9 ahead of its regular-season finale against Florida on Saturday night. The Seminoles have been searching for an offensive coordinator for weeks after coach Mike Norvell fired both offensive coordinator Alex Atkins and defensive coordinator Adam Fuller following a 52-3 loss to Notre Dame. FSU's only wins this season are over Cal and Charleston Southern and the Seminoles have scored more than 21 points just once this season. That came in the team's 41-7 win over the FCS-level Pirates a week ago. Malzahn, 60, is taking the route UCLA coach Chip Kelly did less than a year ago. Kelly stepped down at UCLA to take the offensive coordinator job at Ohio State ahead of the 2024 season. The former Auburn head coach recently completed his fourth season at UCF. The Knights won nine games in each of his first two seasons but fell to 6-7 in 2023 before winning just four games this season. The drop in wins has coincided with UCF’s move from the American Athletic Conference to the Big 12. Before UCF, Malzahn was the head coach at Auburn from 2013 through 2020. The Tigers lost the BCS title game to Florida State in his first season in 2013 and won just 10 games once over the next seven seasons. However, Auburn never posted a losing season under Malzahn and was 6-4 in his final season. Malzahn was Auburn’s offensive coordinator when the Tigers won the national title following the 2011 season. He left Auburn to be the coach at Arkansas State for a season and then replaced Gene Chizik after one season with the Red Wolves."

Let's discuss three potential trade destinations for the Rangers' captain.,"Sergei Belski-Imagn Images Earlier this week, NHL insider Elliotte Friedman reported that the New York Rangers are ready to shake up their roster due to their ongoing struggles. Friedman specifically mentioned defenseman Jacob Trouba as one of the Rangers' available players. Trouba should generate interest, as he is a right-shot, top-four defenseman who plays a heavy game and kills penalties. However, his $8-million cap hit until next season and 15-team no-trade list creates some obstacles. Nevertheless, let's discuss three teams that could look to acquire him. The Detroit Red Wings were heavily linked to Trouba during this past off-season, so they are a clear team to watch in the sweepstakes. They have had a tough start to the season, as their 10-11-2 record demonstrates. They have also won only four out of their last ten games, so GM Steve Yzerman could look to make a move soon. Brian Bradshaw Sevald-Imagn Images There's no question that the Red Wings could use a defender like Trouba right now. The Rochester, Mich. native would provide them an upgrade for their second pairing and would instantly become a significant part of their penalty kill if acquired. If Trouba is more open to a move to the Red Wings this season, they could be the perfect landing spot for the veteran. The Buffalo Sabres were rumored to be interested in Trouba last off-season, so they could be another club to watch. Similar to the Red Wings, the Sabres are another Atlantic Division club that could use a top-four, right-shot defenseman. They also have plenty of cap space to work with, so Trouba's salary would not be an issue. Danny Wild-Imagn Images The Sabres currently have an 11-10-2 record and are one of several Eastern Conference teams fighting for a playoff spot. Thus, they could benefit from adding a veteran defender like Trouba to their group as they look to take that next step. If he is willing to be traded there, the Chicago Blackhawks could be an interesting landing spot for Trouba. David Banks-Imagn Images The Blackhawks are an exciting team on the rise, with Connor Bedard being the superstar youngster they are building around. With this, it would not be too surprising if the Blackhawks looked to add a proven leader like Trouba to mentor their young players and help develop their culture. Trouba would also boost the Blackhawks' blueline and could be a perfect fit on their second pairing. In addition, he would make the rebuilding Blackhawks a more challenging team to go up against because of his hard-nosed style of play.

""Obviously, he’s underrated around the world in the league and how he’s viewed, but I know there’s nothing he can’t do in my eyes.""

The confounding final 32 seconds of the game that saw the Bears fail to use their final timeout as they were driving down 23-20 to set up a game-tying field goal did not just go over poorly with the front office — Eberflus was fired on Friday — he also lost some of his players. According to The Athletic's Adam Jahns and Dianna Russini, cornerback Jaylon Johnson, a team captain, was ""emotional and pissed"" about the game's ending and directed his anger toward Eberflus. Johnson wasn't the only upset Bear. Multiple players and staff members were reportedly wondering why no timeout was called. It clearly wasn't just another loss for the 4-8 team. “Guys were furious,” a staff member said. “It was an accumulation of this season.” “The locker room was ugly,” another staffer said. “There was a lot of yelling.” Said the first player: “We felt as players it’s been too many instances where we fought our way back into games to lose because of bad time management and decision-making.” Eberflus reportedly exited the locker room as soon as he was done with his speech and speaking with players. On Friday, while Bears brass was discussing their next steps, Eberflus held his regularly scheduled video conference with reporters. Not long afterward, he was out of a job. Why was Eberflus allowed to answer questions shortly before he was fired? Team owner George McCaskey, president and CEO Kevin Warren and general manager Ryan Poles had not decided on the move until they held their meeting and the feeling was if Eberflus' media session was canceled or postponed, alarm bells would be ringing that a decision had been made. The Bears had never fired a head coach during a season until Friday. Eberflus gave them numerous reasons to make the move leading up to the Thanksgiving disaster. Once the locker room was gone, his time had run out."

""I'm excited,"" Luck told ESPN. ""I think Stanford is taking an assertive and innovative step. We're undoubtedly the best athletic department in college sports. We have to re-prove it in football, and we're excited to be part of that challenge."" The 35-year-old Luck, who quarterbacked the Cardinal from 2008-2011 and was a two-time Heisman Trophy finalist, is going back ""home"" for this newly created role that will put him atop the program's hierarchy. The GM job will see Luck involved in everything Stanford football related, including handling the coaching staff, player personnel staff, recruiting and roster management. There is a business side to Luck's new gig. He will deal with important aspects of the NCAA experience, such as fundraising, sponsorships and alumni relations. According to Luck, this idea was devised last month in a conversation with school president Jonathan Levin when Levin proposed that the 2012 No. 1 pick in the NFL Draft run the football program. “Andrew Luck exemplifies the Stanford student-athlete,” Levin said in a statement. “I’m excited he’s returning to campus to help lead our football program and ensure that our student-athletes achieve excellence in the changing collegiate athletics environment.” Luck has remain closely involved with Stanford since leaving for the NFL. A decade after graduating with a degree in architectural design, he went back to school and got his master's degree in education. During the Paris Olympics this past summer, Luck and his wife, Nicole Pechanec, who was a gymnast at Stanford, helped get the school's mascot, The Tree, to the Games to support 59 athletes with ties to the school. ""I'm a product of this place,"" Luck said. ""Besides my folks and the friends and extended family I grew up with, Stanford, this is home for my wife and I. I'm profoundly influenced by Jim Harbaugh, David Shaw, Pep Hamilton and all the coaches and professors that I've ever had."" Luck said he understands he's entering this job without a lot of experience, but he's taking it on with ""eyes wide open and aware of my strengths and my limitations."" The program has plenty of work to do to turn around their recent history. Stanford has not made a bowl game and has not won more than four games in a season since 2018. This year, Troy Taylor's team finished 3-9 in their first season in the Atlantic Coast Conference. ""I'm very thankful for what football has given me,"" Luck said. ""In many, many ways on many, many levels. Stanford is one of those deeper levels. There's something about it, especially the people there. This is going to be a daunting challenge. It's a steep climb. But I'm fired up. ""It's going to take a whole team of people."""

The Cavaliers, Charlotte Hornets, Miami Heat, Brooklyn Nets, Philadelphia 76ers and last year's in-season tournament runners-up, the Indiana Pacers, were all eliminated from group play after the Hawks improved their record to 3-1 and clinched first place in East Group C. Charlotte, Brooklyn and Indiana were knocked out anyway with losses on Friday, while Miami's win didn't matter with both the Hawks and Detroit Pistons winning. The Pistons and Milwaukee Bucks, both 3-0, will decide East Group B with their matchup on Tuesday. 6th Man Dre is a FORCE23 PTS5 REB4 3PM#TrueToAtlanta x @UPS pic.twitter.com/LedaHRNazj — Atlanta Hawks (@ATLHawks) November 29, 2024 De'Andre Hunter led the Hawks with 23 points off the bench, followed by Trae Young with 20 points and 11 assists. Jalen Johnson compiled 20 points, nine rebounds and seven assists. Clint Capela added 13 rebounds, while Dyson Daniels swiped three steals. Cleveland got 29 points from Darius Garland (who shot 5-for-8 on 3s) with Evan Mobley adding 24 points and 13 rebounds. Donovan Mitchell scored 11, shooting 5-for-23, with 11 rebounds and six assists. The inaugural in-season tournament was a bright spot in a rough 2023-24 season for the Los Angeles Lakers. They are not having as easy a time in the second one. The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Lakers 101-93 on Saturday, pushing the defending IST champions to the brink of elimination in Group B. It was a brilliant night from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander with 36 points, while Isaiah Hartenstein pulled in a season-high 17 rebounds. pic.twitter.com/Ptkdb18kp8 — Thunder Film Room (@TFRVideos) November 30, 2024 The win leaves the Thunder in a good position at 2-1 and the Lakers in a bad one at 2-2. The Phoenix Suns and San Antonio Spurs both sit at 1-1, but with positive point differentials. The Lakers, meanwhile, are sitting at minus-24, which isn't good when point differential is the second tiebreaker after head-to-head record. With no more games to play, the Lakers are going to need some help to advance. The Boston Celtics stayed alive in group play with their 138–129 win over the Chicago Bulls. The Celtics could have been eliminated with a loss, along with Detroit, Atlanta, the New York Knicks and Orlando Magic winning. Jayson Tatum led the Celtics with 35 points (shooting 4-for-8 from 3) and 14 rebounds, while Peyton Pritchard added 29 points and seven rebounds off the bench. Jaylen Brown and Kristaps Porzingis each scored 21. The Bulls were paced by Nikola Vučević, who scored 32 points (on 6-for-9 shooting on 3s) with 11 rebounds. Zach LaVine added 29, and Josh Giddey dished out nine assists. Boston could have clinched East Group C with its win and a Hawks loss. Chicago also could have clinched East Group C by beating the Celtics combined with the Cavs' loss. But neither scenario occurred. The Hornets were eliminated from group play for the NBA Cup in-season tournament with a 99–98 defeat to the New York Knicks on Friday. Charlotte was led by Brandon Miller's 20 points with Josh Green adding 15. Tidjane Salaün contributed 14 points with eight rebounds, while Moussa Diabaté grabbed 11 boards. The Hornets were without LaMelo Ball, who missed the game due to illness. Ball had averaged 40 points over his past four games, including a 50-point effort last Saturday versus the Bucks. For the season, he's averaging 31.1 points, which likely would have made a difference in a one-point game. Jalen Brunson scored 31 points (going 4-for-6 on 3s), six rebounds and six assists to lead New York. Karl-Anthony Towns followed with 19 points, 12 rebounds and five assists, while Josh Hart added 13 points, 12 rebounds and five assists. Miles McBride tallied 14 points off the bench."

The bizarre play, on which the Raiders had a miscommunication that resulted in quarterback Aidan O'Connell not knowing that a shotgun snap was coming to him, ended the Raiders' hopes of winning on a last-second field goal. The Raiders were flagged for an illegal shift on the play, which the Chiefs declined, but it sounded like an official blew the play dead for a false start, which would have negated the snap. ""We heard a whistle on our sideline,"" Pierce told reporters on Saturday. Pierce said he'll send that play in to the league's officiating office and ask for an explanation, but he said that's a typical practice after every game when the team has questions about a call. The official near the Raiders' sideline appeared to blow his whistle and signal timeout before the Chiefs jumped on the loose ball, which should have meant the play didn't count. Pierce has a legitimate complaint about that."

The Bulldogs scored 14 points in the final four minutes of regulation to force an overtime section that felt like it would never end. The eight overtimes are the second-most in FBS history after Illinois’ nine-overtime victory over Penn State in 2021. CLEAN OLD FASHIONED 8️⃣UGA COMES BACK TO WIN IN 8OT‼️ pic.twitter.com/QpMIXjgJLi — ESPN (@espn) November 30, 2024 Frazier scored after Georgia Tech’s pass attempt was incomplete to start the eighth overtime. College football rules mandate that teams take turns attempting two-point conversions starting in the third overtime. And the teams combined to score in just two of the final six overtimes. Both teams scored touchdowns in the first overtime and got touchdowns without two-point conversions in the second overtime. They both scored on their first two-point attempts in the third overtime and went scoreless for the next four overtimes until Frazier finally got into the end zone. “No, I have not — anything like this,"" Georgia coach Kirby Smart said when he was asked if he'd ever been a part of a game like this. The Bulldogs trailed 27-13 with 5:37 to go after Georgia Tech QB Haynes King scored his second rushing TD of the night. A Georgia offense that hadn’t been very good all game promptly went 75 yards in eight plays as Carson Beck found Dominic Lovett for a 17-yard TD to cut the lead to seven. Georgia Tech had a chance to seal the game with a couple of first downs, but Georgia safety Dan Jackson jarred the ball loose from King with two minutes to go as King appeared to have gotten enough yardage for a first down. After Georgia recovered, Beck hit Lovett again with 1:01 to go and the game-tying score. Georgia Tech's final drive of regulation didn't get into field goal range. BECK ➡️ LOVETT FOR 6GEORGIA TIES IT AT 27 LATE IN THE FOURTH 🍿 pic.twitter.com/c3s42SK7ie — ESPN (@espn) November 30, 2024 Beck finished the game 28-of-43 passing for 297 yards and five touchdowns, while King was 26-of-36 for 303 yards and two scores. He also rushed 24 times for 110 yards. No other player in the game for either team had more than 13 carries. Georgia Tech will rue its missed opportunities, including a field goal at the end of an 18-play drive that took over 10 minutes in the second half. A touchdown would have given the Yellow Jackets a three-score lead. Instead, the field goal extended the margin to 14, and Georgia cut it to seven six minutes later. Smart lamented his team’s mistakes at halftime and the end of the game too. Lovett fumbled in the first half and the Bulldogs also had a turnover on downs as Georgia had less than 15 minutes of possession at one point during the third quarter thanks to Georgia Tech’s ball-control offense. But the Bulldogs responded when things got dire against a team that entered the game as a 17-point underdog. The win pushes Georgia to 9-2 and will assuredly keep the Bulldogs in the top 10 of next week’s the College Football Playoff rankings. Is it good enough to ensure that Georgia can withstand a loss in the SEC title game? Georgia will play the winner of Saturday’s game between Texas and Texas A&M on Dec. 7 in Atlanta. The winner of that game will get a top four seed in the inaugural College Football Playoff. If Georgia isn’t the winner, are the Bulldogs getting an at-large berth? It’s hard to say yes for certain given this format’s lack of history. But Georgia can take any postseason doubt away with a much better performance in a week."

Ridley continued his strong second half of the season in Week 12 when he caught five of six targets for 93 yards. He’s now played five games since DeAndre Hopkins was traded and has averaged an elite 32% target share across these contests. Since Week 8, Ridley has averaged 14 fantasy points per game which ranks eighth among all receivers ahead of Puka Nacua and Terry McLaurin. Ridley has benefitted from Will Levis playing better the past month. During this time, Levis ranks fourth among all QBs, averaging 9.6 yards per attempt. This week, Ridley gets a beneficial matchup against the Commanders. Washington ranks 29th in coverage this season according to PFF and they allow the fifth-most touchdowns to wide receivers. The Titans are six-point underdogs this week so there’s an increased chance they play from behind. If so, this could lead to more targets and production for Ridley. Make sure he’s in your lineup this week. Addison is coming off a big week against the Bears. He produced 162 yards on eight catches and found the end zone. Addison was the No. 1 fantasy receiver on the entire week after this career-high performance. He benefitted from the Bears focusing most of their attention on Justin Jefferson. This allowed Addison to see plenty of one-on-one matchups and he took advantage of these. Addison has now finished as a top-24 receiver in three of his last four games. He’s coming off back-to-back games of at least eight targets and a touchdown. The most impressive part about all of this is he’s found so much success despite difficult matchups against the Titans and Bears. But this week Addison finally gets a good matchup. He’ll face the Cardinals this week who allow the 10th most efficiency per passing play this season. Last week, Jaxon Smith-Njigba totaled 77 yards and a touchdown against the Cardinals. Expect Arizona to focus most of their attention on Jefferson and for Addison to see lots of one-on-one matchups again. He’s a start this week. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Irving had a great matchup last week against the Giants who allow the most rushing yards per play. We deemed him to be in the best spot of the week in Week 12 and he came through for us. Irving turned 18 touches into 151 total yards and a touchdown. He posted his first top-five finish of the season and even saw an improvement in his receiving-game usage. The Bucs rookie ran 59% of the team's routes, his second-highest mark in a game this season, leading to six receptions. This week, Irving gets another elite matchup against the Panthers. Carolina allows the most rushing yards per game and second-most rushing touchdowns this season. Opposing backfields average 29.3 fantasy points per game against the Panthers, the most in the league. Even if you’re loaded at the running back position, make sure Irving is in your lineup this week. McConkey is coming off a rare game where he didn’t lead the Chargers in target share. In Week 12, McConkey earned 17% of the team's targets in a strong matchup against the Ravens. He saw two fewer targets than teammate Josh Palmer. Despite this, McConkey still led the team with six catches and 83 yards. He’s now averaging 103 yards the past two weeks and continues to look great as a route runner. There’s a chance the Chargers feature McConkey even more moving forward given Quentin Johnston’s drop issues. This week the quality matchups continue for McConkey against the Falcons. The last time we saw Atlanta was in Week 10 before their bye, when they gave up 307 yards and four touchdowns to Bo Nix and the Broncos. Atlanta allows the seventh most receiving yards per game and ranks 31st in pressure this season according to PFF; Justin Herbert should have plenty of time to throw this week. McConkey is once again a top-20 option and start this week."

Luke Schoonmaker, Nick Westbrook-Ikhine and Roschon Johnson had touchdowns and Will Dissly was solid, as usual. We like that. But Quentin Johnston toasted a bagel on Monday (so many soul-crushing drops) and there were some other bricks. Here's hoping you don't need a lot of sleepers in your Week 13 lineups. All 32 NFL clubs are in action this week and you are probably jostling for playoff position. The stakes are rising. But if injuries or underperformance have bitten you, perhaps some of these names can help out. At this stage of the game, we know what Edwards is — a two-down pounder who offers almost nothing in the pass game. However, he's going to be the first look at the goal line with J.K. Dobbins (knee) set to miss time, and the Falcons present a rushing defense that's slightly below average in most metrics. Edwards probably needs a touchdown to pay off his projection, but I'd give him a better than 50% chance to get that score here. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Here's another back who's shown nothing in the pass game (just two receptions), but McNichols has been efficient when asked to carry the ball (in a mild surprise, his success rate is actually slightly higher than Brian Robinson Jr. and Austin Ekeler). Robinson suffered an ankle injury in Week 12 (though he was left off the final injury report), and Ekeler (concussion) has been ruled out. It's unclear if Robinson will be limited at all, which could put McNichols in play against an average Tennessee rushing defense. Bo Nix isn't the only rookie winner in Denver; Vele's role continues to expand and he's been impressive. Vele is coming off his busiest and most productive game of the year (6-80-0, nine targets) and the Monday draw is favorable, up against a Cleveland secondary that's allowed the fifth-most points to opposing wide receivers. Boundary specialist Courtland Sutton is the undeniable alpha in the Denver passing game, but Vele will probably see a target share of 20% or higher in this spot. One of the biggest fantasy stories from Week 12 was the emergence of Bryce Young, who looked poised and in control against the intimidating Kansas City defense. Young wasn't fazed by the blitz packages and made several on-target throws despite challenging pressure. It appears the Panthers knew what they were doing when they gave Young a temporary benching; he's looked like a different player since the return. This means we can start attacking the Carolina receiver room with some level of confidence. Thielen's resume probably makes him the more comfortable sleeper play, off a solid 3-57-0 line in his return from injury, but we also have to note Moore saw heavy usage in the Kansas City game (6-81-1) and drew a team-best 10 targets. The Buccaneers play a lot of shootouts, with a capable offense and a leaky secondary. Perhaps the Panthers can uphold their end of the bargain. Some fantasy managers didn't want to hold MVS through the bye week and I get it, given his history of inconsistent performance. And even in two smash games, they've come with limited volume — just seven targets led to his 5-196-3 line the past two games. The hope is that Valdez-Scantling will make one big play to justify your faith, and at least there's little downfield competition in this offense. The Rams secondary has been a plus matchup for most of 2024. It's becoming a cut-and-paste case with NWI, a low-target player who somehow has scored in 6-of-7 games. NWI is seeing snap shares over 90% each week in the aftermath of the DeAndre Hopkins trade, making him the second-most important target in his offense. I'm not afraid to dial him up against an average Washington defense; the Commanders are heavy favorites, which could push Tennessee into a more proactive passing game."

The team is making sure it gets a few more. The super-utility man has agreed to a five-year, $74 million contract extension with a sixth-year club option, the Dodgers announced Friday. Per ESPN's Jeff Passan, the deal includes a $17 million signing bonus and deferred money. The Los Angeles Dodgers have agreed on a contract extension with IF/OF Tommy Edman for five years for $74M through the 2029 season with a club option for the 2030 season. — Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) November 29, 2024 Edman was previously set to hit free agency after 2025. He now joins Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Blake Snell and Will Smith as Dodgers players under contract through 2029. The structure is similar to the Dodgers' other significant deal of the offseason (so far), as Snell's five-year, $182 million deal also included a significant signing bonus and deferred money. That setup helps the Dodgers when it comes to CBT calculations, with little cost to the player thanks to the up-front money. Edman landed with the Dodgers at this year's trade deadline, joining the club in a three-team trade that also saw reliever Michael Kopech go to Los Angeles. The trade wound up vital for the Dodgers' playoff run, with Kopech quickly becoming one of the team's high-leverage bullpen arms and Edman winning NLCS MVP honors while providing both flexibility and highlight plays on defense. Edman is the rare player who can provide above-average fielding at shortstop, center field and second base, playing the former two during the Dodgers' World Series run. The Dodgers prioritize positional flexibility, and Edman gives them that at three premium defensive positions. He also gives them a strong bat, with a catch. Edman is a switch-hitter who clearly has a better side, hitting .181/.256/.267 against right-handed pitchers and .412/.417/.882 against left-handed pitchers. He can also catch fire at times, such as when he hit .407/.393/.630 in the NLCS against the New York Mets. Shortstop in particular has been a problem position for the Dodgers since Trea Turner left in free agency, so much so that they tried Mookie Betts at the position this year. Center field isn't a strength either, with a platoon of Andy Pages and James Outman looming for 2025. Edman figures to see plenty of time at both in 2025. Locking down that kind of piece for the next five years is significant for the Dodgers, who entered the offseason with a lengthy to-do list despite holding the Commissioner's Trophy. Extending Edman was one item, as was getting a starting pitcher such as Snell. Still remaining are another starting pitcher (the Dodgers truly cannot have enough), a corner outfielder (think Juan Soto or Teoscar Hernández) and perhaps a bullpen arm or two (Blake Treinen is a free agent). That's all to say the team which has already spent $256 million this offseason is nowhere close to finished."

Brown spent three years as a running backs coach, tight ends coach, and assistant head coach on Sean McVay's staff with the Rams and McVay was asked about Brown during his Friday press conference. McVay said Brown, who was bumped up to call offensive plays a few weeks ago, is different from others in the league because of ""the competitiveness, the spirit, and the never-say-die attitude"" that he brings to the job. ""Well, I know that he's always been a guy that's had an incredible command,"" McVay said, via a transcript from the team. ""He's been a great competitor. He kind of demands respect from people that he's around just by the way that he carries himself. Anytime these things come up . . . and I think even Thomas did a great job of handling it when he got the opportunity to be the OC. He's done a great job, obviously, but it's unique in which the circumstances have come about but he's going to attack it. I think guys will follow his lead."" The Rams and Bears already played this season, so McVay won't get the chance to match wits with Brown in his new role. If Brown is as successful as McVay thinks he can be, they may get the chance to face off in the future."

Many called for his job after the Chicago Bears went 7–10 last season, beginning the campaign with four consecutive losses and a 2–7 start, which followed a 3-14 debut season in 2022. The Bears were on the way to the No. 1 overall selection in the 2024 NFL Draft as a result of a trade with the Carolina Panthers the previous year and it was questionable whether or not a franchise quarterback prospect — widely projected to be USC star Caleb Williams — should begin his career with a coach likely to be fired. But then Chicago began to play better under Eberflus. Here's a timeline of how it all went wrong from there: Players quitting on a coach is probably the worst indictment, yet the Bears weren't doing that. They were playing hard for Eberflus and the results began showing on the scoreboard. The turnaround began with a Week 10 win over the Panthers, then became two of three victories before their bye week. After the bye, Chicago went 5-3 in its final eight games, including a win over the Detroit Lions. The Bears still finished last in the NFC North, but general manager Ryan Poles said the improved play demonstrated leadership and believed keeping Eberflus would maintain stability. ""Just in terms of his leadership and stability,"" Poles said. ""I really think that the head coach needs to be able to captain the ship when the seas have storms and really keep everything settled. When you go through hard times and you can keep everyone together, that's the critical piece in a big market like this. You have to be strong."" Keeping his job, Eberflus quickly made changes to his offensive staff in anticipation of adding a new, young quarterback. Luke Getsy was dismissed and Shane Waldron was hired. In three seasons leading the Seattle Seahawks' offense, Waldron worked with Russell Wilson, then helped revive Geno Smith's career. The thinking was that he could play a major role in tutoring Williams in his rookie season. That looked like a good move with Chicago starting 4-2. Yet after nine games, Eberflus decided the offense wasn't working with Waldron and he was fired. The Bears dropped to 4-5 and had gone 23 consecutive possessions without a touchdown despite a presumably upgraded offense with No. 1 pick Williams, running back D'Andre Swift, and receivers Keenan Allen and Rome Odunze joining star wideout DJ Moore. Passing game coordinator Thomas Brown was promoted to OC, but firing Waldron had the look of a head coach in jeopardy who was making moves to save his job. Chicago's record was discouraging enough, but what truly worked against Eberflus was late-game decision-making that cost his team potential wins. In his third season, game and clock management looked to be inept. The players had stuck with Eberflus, but the mistakes had to affect their faith in him and almost certainly was a key factor in the decision to make a coaching change. The beginning of the end was in Week 8 when the Bears suffered a crushing 18-15 loss to the Washington Commanders on a 52-yard Hail Mary touchdown pass from Jayden Daniels to Noah Brown with no time remaining.

Chicago had driven 42 yards in seven plays, moving in position for a game-winning field goal on three passes for 49 yards by Williams. However, Cairo Santos' 46-yard attempt was blocked and the Packers escaped with a 20-19 win. Eberflus and the Bears complained to the NFL that Green Bay's T.J. Slaton made illegal contact with long snapper Scott Daly. But the league disagreed, holding up another crushing loss for Chicago.

Unfortunately, Chicago went three-and-out in its first possession of OT due to a sack and false start penalty. On its ensuing possession, Minnesota went 68 yards in 10 plays with Sam Darnold completing six passes. Parker Romo kicked a 29-yard field goal to give the Vikings a victory, denying the Bears after a valiant comeback.

However, after Williams was sacked, Eberflus did not use that timeout and the clock ran down to six seconds remaining. All the Bears could do was attempt a desperation pass toward the end zone that fell incomplete. Everyone watching criticized Eberflus' inept clock management, yet he insisted that he liked how those final seconds played out. What everyone else saw was a head coach fail to rescue a chance for his team to tie the game when it was in position to do so. That included the players, who expressed their disbelief afterward, and Bears executives who could no longer listen to Eberflus' rationalizations made an obvious decision that had developed during a lost final season for a doomed head coach."

The Cowboys lost 52-0 to No. 25 Colorado on Friday to cap a 3-9 season that included a 0-9 record in Big 12 play. It was the worst loss ever for coach Mike Gundy to cap his worst season in charge and the first time Oklahoma State hasn’t won at least four games in a season since the Cowboys were 3-8 in 2000. It was a miserable showing for the Cowboys. The offense couldn’t do anything with freshman QB Maealiuaki Smith at the helm, and the pass defense was gashed by Colorado QB Shedeur Sanders. Oklahoma State turned the ball over three times and even committed three personal foul penalties in a first quarter that featured three touchdowns for the Buffaloes. The game was over after Colorado built a 21-0 lead that included an 11-yard pass to prohibitive Heisman favorite Travis Hunter. Hunter finished the game with 10 catches for 116 yards and three touchdowns. His final TD catch was a 23-yard grab in man coverage to put the Buffs up 52. TRAVIS HUNTER, ARE YOU KIDDING!? 😱THIRD TD OF THE DAY 🔥 pic.twitter.com/6yTD1nk1Cq — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) November 29, 2024 Oh, he also had an interception. The Cowboys went 10-4 a season ago and lost to Texas in the Big 12 title game before capping the season with a win in the Texas Bowl. It was the eighth time in 19 seasons that a Gundy-coached team had won at least 10 games. That season, along with a host of returning starters like RB Ollie Gordon, QB Alan Bowman and WR Brennan Presley, led to a preseason ranking of No. 17 in the AP Top 25 and made Oklahoma State one of the favorites in a wide-open Big 12. The Cowboys started the season 3-0 but things fell apart from there. A 22-19 home loss to Utah to start Big 12 play ended up being a matchup of the two worst teams in the conference. A week after losing to the Utes, OSU was blown out by Kansas State and then lost by 24 to West Virginia. A close call against BYU on Oct. 18 — as the Cougars got a late TD to win the game — ended up being the closest Oklahoma State came to a conference win. In early November, Gundy apologized for comments he made at a news conference as the team was 0-6. When discussing fan criticism of the team during its losing streak, Gundy said that “most people are weak” and “they fall apart and panic” when things aren’t going well, while also saying that “in most cases, the people who are negative and voicing their opinion are the same ones that can’t pay their own bills.” Given the way that Oklahoma State played in 2024, you can understand why fans were criticizing a program that had been to a bowl game for 18 straight seasons. A loss to TCU a week after Gundy's comments meant that Oklahoma State wouldn't be going to a bowl for the first time since Gundy's first season. Colorado’s win eliminates TCU, Texas Tech and West Virginia from Big 12 title contention. However, the Buffaloes still need some help to get to the Big 12 title game. Colorado entered Week 14 tied atop the conference at 6-2 with Arizona State, BYU and Iowa State. The Buffs are on the wrong side of tiebreakers in a three or four-way tiebreaker and will need two of the three other teams to lose on Saturday to make the conference title game."

The Bucs get a date with a Carolina secondary that has allowed the second-highest EPA per dropback and the sixth-most fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks. Vegas is buying the Bucs’ offense as well with a 26.25 team total that trails only the Ravens. Don’t miss episodes of Fantasy Football Happy Hour with Matthew Berry and Rotoworld Football Show all season long for the latest player news, waiver wire help, start/sit advice, and much more. Sit: Kyler Murray, Cardinals  The Vikings are a below-average opponent for the fantasy production of opposing quarterbacks in general and match up particularly well against Murray and the Cardinals. They have allowed the fewest rushing yards to quarterbacks this year and have only given up one rushing touchdown. Minnesota’s biggest weakness on defense is an inability to contain deep shots, but the Cardinals aren’t big on attempting those throws. Murray ranks 24th in deep throw rate this year. Murray is stuck on the QB1/2 border this week. Start: Bucky Irving, Bucs Irving has been one of the league’s most efficient backs this year, ranking second in yards after contact per carry and seventh in Next Gen’s rush yards over expected per attempt. Watch Baker on the lead block How can you not love Baker Mayfield?!: #TBvsNYG on CBS/Paramount+: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/wuCgzLl5kn — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024 He is now marrying those fancy numbers with an increase in touches. Irving earned a season-high 18 touches in Week 12. His 55 percent snap share and 59 percent route rate were both high-water marks in games with Rachaad White active. Now he gets a Panthers defense that has allowed the most fantasy points to running backs. Sit: Nick Chubb, Browns The Browns have the lowest implied team total of any team playing on Sunday at 18 points. They are 5.5-point underdogs on the road versus a Denver defense that ranks seventh in rush EPA per attempt allowed. Chubb isn’t involved as a receiver out of the backfield and is generating no explosive plays. He has one gain of 15 or more yards and is last in the NFL in yards per carry (min. 70 attempts). Start: Courtland Sutton, Broncos Sutton was held without a target in Week 7. Since then, he’s seen more targets than all but seven wide receivers. He has a 29 percent target share and a 45 percent air yards share since the doughnut game. Sutton gets a Cleveland defense allowing the sixth-most fantasy points to opposing wideouts. Sit: Marquez Valdes-Scantling This feels like low-hanging fruit, but MVS is the player I’ve been asked about the most this week. With playoff berths on the line, the risk isn’t worth the reward. Despite scoring three times in his past two appearances, he has just seven targets and a 15 percent target share in those games. MVS was the WR56 in expected points in Weeks 10 and 11. He finished as the WR3 overall. Given his modest role, I don’t buy that he can sustain anything close to this level of efficiency going forward. Start: Evan Engram, Jaguars Engram has appeared in nine games with Christian Kirk inactive over the past two seasons. He has averaged 15.5 fantasy points on the back of 9.6 targets per game in those contests. His target share is up to an absurd 32 percent in three games without Kirk this year. With Trevor Lawrence expected to return on Sunday, Engram is pushing for a top-five ranking at tight end. Sit: Kyle Pitts, Falcons Pitts is a volatile player and cold streaks are to be expected, but his latest downswing has been accompanied by a noticeable hit to his role. Pitts has scored 13.5 fantasy points over his past three games combined. During that stretch, he has a disastrous 11 percent target share while running 74 percent of the routes. The Chargers defense is sixth in EPA per dropback allowed and has faced a -3% pass rate over expected. Pitts should get back on the board with a big game at some point, but Week 13 isn’t the time to make that bet."
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games","Bears had never fired a coach during a season, but Matt Eberflus gave them no choice",https://sports.yahoo.com/bears-had-never-fired-a-coach-during-a-season-but-matt-eberflus-gave-them-no-choice-193304384.html,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024 19:33:04 GMT",The Bears need to reevaluate everything after another bad season.,"The worst part of the Chicago Bears' absolute tomfoolery at the end of their Thanksgiving loss might be that Matt Eberflus said afterward he liked what they did. He told a fan base that what everyone saw at the end of the Bears' horrific final 30 seconds in a 23-20 loss to the Detroit Lions actually wasn't that bad. No matter the context, that was going to turn out poorly. And it did, with Eberflus being fired on Friday. For anyone who missed it on the holiday, the Bears trailed 23-20 in the final minute. Caleb Williams was sacked just before 30 seconds remained in the game. And the clock kept ticking. The Bears had a timeout but didn't call it. Williams looked like a confused rookie. Eberflus didn't throw him a life preserver. The clock ticked down until six seconds, and when the ball was finally snapped, Williams' incomplete pass downfield was the final play of the game. ""I like what we did there,"" Eberflus said after the game as part of his explanation. The Bears had never fired a coach during a season before, a fact they made sure everyone was aware of on multiple occasions. They had to break that weird tradition for Eberflus, and it wasn't just the Thanksgiving fiasco that led to it. Part of a coach's job is what he says after a loss. It's not a big part of the job, but you also can't tell a devoted fan base that your mistakes were actually totally fine. When the Washington Commanders beat the Bears on a Hail Mary, picking up an easy 13 yards on the second-to-last play when the Bears played way back to give Jayden Daniels a shot to throw it to the end zone, Eberflus said he wasn't concerned about gain. Meanwhile, Commanders coach Dan Quinn said the Commanders couldn't have completed the Hail Mary without it. In a loss to the Green Bay Packers, a last-second field goal was blocked. Eberflus said the team ""felt good"" about not trying to move the ball closer for kicker Cairo Santos, though Packers players said afterward they knew Santos kicked a low trajectory on longer kicks. Then came the end-of-game situation against the Lions. If you have said you've never seen something like that before, you are right. OptaSTATS said that over the past 30 NFL seasons, in 1,501 instances, there was only one team that lost by three or fewer points and run a play inside the opponents' 30 on their final drive, but had the clock expire without trying a field goal or using all their timeouts. That was the Bears on Thursday. Eberflus had the worst record among all 221 coaches in NFL history with 20 or more games decided by seven or fewer points, according to Associated Press' Josh Dubow. Eberflus was 5-17 in those close games. It can't be chalked up to bad luck, either. The Bears aren't exactly a clean organization either. They had Eberflus address the media on Friday and then fired him a couple hours later. That's a really unprofessional look. The entire franchise needs a cleansing. Maybe that started Friday. The Bears haven't won a Super Bowl since the 1985 season. They've never had a 4,000-yard passer. They haven't won a playoff game since January of 2011. And they've also never had a quarterback prospect quite like Caleb Williams. The Bears firing a coach midseason was a sign that they know holding onto old axioms has been holding them back. Chicago has been stuck in the past in many ways. The Bears need to modernize their operation to maximize Williams. They already wasted a season with him, giving defensive-minded head coach Eberflus one season too long after he finished last season on a high note. Lost in the commotion over Eberflus' end-of-game mismanagement was that Williams played a very good second half against Detroit, almost leading a wild comeback win. He has had ups and downs as a rookie, but a lot of that can be attributed to coaching. The Bears' offense has looked better since they fired offensive coordinator Shane Waldron three weeks ago. Maybe it will look even better with Eberflus gone, too. The Bears as a whole can't help but be more organized at the end of games from here on out. The Bears have tried it all when it comes to head-coaching hires, so who knows what direction they'll go in this time. But it has to be done with Williams' development in mind. They can't afford to blow a great prospect like Williams. Whatever the Bears decide to do, they can look at their long history first. Then do the opposite."

Friday was the weirdest of all.,"The Kansas City Chiefs are finding weird ways to win this season. Friday was the weirdest way of all. The Las Vegas Raiders were in field goal range with less than 20 seconds left, and they were trying to get closer. Rookie center Jackson Powers-Johnson then snapped to quarterback Aidan O’Connell in shotgun before he was ready, and it hit him in the chest. The Chiefs fell on the ball and after a long conference between the officials, they ruled the Chiefs had recovered the fumble. Game over. Chiefs win 19-17. The Raiders fumble it, the Chiefs recover it to seal the game ‼️#LVvsKC on Prime VideoAlso streaming on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/WvNvUONRM5 — NFL (@NFL) November 29, 2024 After the game, Powers-Johnson took the blame for the blunder, saying it was a miscommunication between he and O'Connell. Likewise, O'Connell took accountability, saying: ""it was completely my fault. I was looking out to right, making sure guys were set and I started clapping. In my head I was thinking signal the ball to get the ball, but when I start clapping it tells Jackson, basically, snap the ball. Jackson did exactly what he should have done and I clapped too early."" Kansas City is doing just enough to get by, and they seem to find a way to win close games over inferior teams every week. Amazingly, that’s been good enough for a 11-1 record. The Chiefs looked unimpressive yet again on Friday, but as usual they found a way to win. This time it was holding off the Las Vegas Raiders, who are now 2-10. The Chiefs are now the first team this season to clinch a playoff spot, but their issues are legitimate. Their offensive tackles are struggling badly. The offensive skill-position talent is good but doesn’t have a lot of explosive speed outside of Xavier Worthy, who is an unreliable rookie. The defense this season has been good but short of what it was last season. And despite all of that, the Chiefs are 11-1. And as we all learned last season, when the games matter most in January, the Chiefs’ issues just seem to fade away once the postseason starts and they’re marching to another Super Bowl. But they shouldn’t be barely beating teams like the Raiders. Early on the game seemed to be there for the taking for the Raiders. They just kept blowing opportunities. The Raiders were able to move the ball well enough but couldn’t do enough on the Chiefs’ side of the field. Daniel Carlson missed two long field goals. The Raiders, one of the worst rushing teams in the NFL over many years, also got stuffed on a fourth-and-1 handoff at the Chiefs’ 31. Late in the third quarter, right before O’Connell took a 15-yard sack that led into Carlson missing another field goal, the Raiders were outgaining the Chiefs. And they trailed 13-3. Finally, the Raiders made a move. Ameer Abdullah had a long kickoff return and then electric rookie tight end Brock Bowers had a great touchdown grab from 33 yards out. The Raiders trailed 16-10. Once again, the back-to-back champion Chiefs were in a closer game than anyone expected against one of the worst teams in the NFL. Then it got serious as the Raiders took a fourth-quarter lead. On the first play of the fourth quarter, O’Connell threw deep down the left sideline. Tre Tucker got behind the Chiefs secondary and caught a 58-yard touchdown that gave the Raiders a lead and gave everyone a jolt. At that moment, eight seconds into the fourth quarter, the Raiders had outplayed the Chiefs. At Arrowhead Stadium. With O’Connell returning from injury to play his first game in over a month. The Chiefs put together a drive into Raiders territory, though that stalled when both tackles were beaten on a third-and-goal play and Kansas City settled for a field goal and a 19-17 lead. Mahomes was visibly upset after that play, and on the next series guard Joe Thuney replaced Wanya Morris at left tackle. That’s a situation the Chiefs have to figure out before the playoffs. The Raiders had a shot to take a late lead. They drove into Chiefs territory in the final minutes. But with 2:17 left, not facing a decent option on fourth-and-11, Carlson tried a 58-yard field goal and was well short for his third miss of the day. Carlson has been one of the best kickers in the NFL over his career, but the Chiefs caught him on what might be his worst day as a pro. And because the Chiefs couldn’t put the game away, the Raiders had yet another chance. Bowers had a huge 25-yard catch down the middle to get the Raiders close to field-goal range, and then Jakobi Meyers and Ameer Abdullah made catches to get Las Vegas even closer. But the Raiders screwed up the shotgun snap, the Chiefs fell on it and the game was over. The play call came in late, and with the play clock winding down, O’Connell started clapping almost as soon as the huddle broke for the snap to come quickly. The left guard tapped Powers-Johnson, who snapped it before O’Connell was ready. It bounced off O'Connell and the Chiefs fell on it to end the game. The Chiefs haven’t played well for much of the season. But their record is still almost pristine, somehow. With the win and improving to an 11–1 record, the Chiefs have clinched a playoff spot. Ten years in a row, and it never gets old.

But the Raiders ended up on fourth-and-one, and decided to go for it. Unfortunately for Las Vegas, the Chiefs defense gets the huge stop and the Raiders turn over on downs. Patrick Mahomes hit a 34-yard pass to DeAndre Hopkins with less than 30 seconds remaining in the half, giving the Chiefs a chance to score before halftime.

Mahomes' nine-yard pass to Noah Gray was complete, but short. The referees ruled that the catch happened at 14 seconds, but that it required a 10 second runoff, giving the Chiefs only four seconds left in the half. Matthew Wright went for the 59-yard field goal, but it was no good, falling short of the posts. The two teams head into the locker room with the Chiefs up 10-3. A franchise leader in more ways than one.

The Chiefs are forced to punt, and Las Vegas will get a chance to make a play before the end of the first quarter. Stuck at 3rd & 16, Aidan O'Connell's seven-yard pass to Brock Bowers wasn't enough to move the chains, so Las Vegas went for the punt...and Raiders punter AJ Cole was able to get the ball at the one. A holding penalty called on the Chiefs moved the ball further back, half the distance to the goal. But wait! The referees corrected the mistake, saying that it was supposed to be called on the Raiders, and Cole redid the punt...and to make it more confusing, all of this happened during the commercial break. So here we are. Chiefs have the ball at the 23. We're all on the same page now. The Chiefs got into the red zone off a pass interference penalty, but two incomplete passes from Mahomes forced Kansas City to go for the field goal. Matthew Wright, who is replacing an injured Harrison Butker, nails the kick, and the Chiefs have an early 3-0 lead. Matthew Wright's 25-yard field goal attempt is good! pic.twitter.com/CRrrALQsWn — Kansas City Chiefs (@Chiefs) November 29, 2024 Chiefs running back Isiah Pacheco, who has been out for two months with a broken leg, is back on the field for Kansas City.

Cincinnati has lost three of its last four games, making this a must-win game for the Bengals. They are three-point favorites in the Week 13 NFL odds, one of eight Week 13 NFL spreads smaller than four points on Sunday. Another close game is expected in Baltimore when Lamar Jackson and the Ravens (-3, 51) host Jalen Hurts and the Eagles in a game between Super Bowl contenders. The Eagles have won and covered in three straight games. The weekend concludes with Sunday Night Football featuring Buffalo (-6.5, 44.5) vs. San Francisco in a game where a lake effect snow warning is in effect.

Tennessee turned heads last week with its shocking win at Houston as an 8-point underdog, but the Titans had failed to cover the spread in their previous six games. They did not score more than 20 points in any of those six outings, so their win over Houston appears to be an outlier.  Meanwhile, Washington is suddenly in desperation mode after losing its last three games by one possession. The Commanders rank sixth in the NFL in yards per game (370.5) and fifth in points per game (27.8), led by star rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels. The model has Daniels finishing with 225 passing yards and two touchdowns on Sunday, one reason why Washington is covering the spread in almost 60% of simulations. See which other NFL parlay picks to make here.

The 29-year old Shiffrin, the winningest skier in World Cup history, had been in pursuit of her 100th career victory when the accident occurred. After leading the first run of the giant slalom, Shiffrin was approaching the finish line when she lost grip on her outside ski, hitting a gate and then flipping over before sliding into another gate and being stopped by protective fencing at the edge of the course. Shiffrin remained down for some time before eventually being taken off the hill on a sled and transported by ambulance to Rutland Regional Medical Center for further evaluation. On Sunday morning, the U.S. Ski & Snowboard Team shared that while no ligament damage was assessed and Shiffrin's bones and internal organs looked OK, she had suffered a puncture wound into the right side of her abdomen and severe muscle trauma. The team says Shiffrin's return to competition is yet to be determined. The team statement backed up a direct update that Shiffrin herself had shared, saying that she had suffered an abrasion and could not move. ""Not really too much cause for concern at this point, I just can't move. I have a pretty good abrasion,"" Shiffrin said while showing a doctor working on the abrasion. ""So I just can't move. I'm so sorry to scare everybody. It looks like all scans so far are clear. Thank you for the support and concern. And congratulations to the winners and my team."" Quick update. Thank you for your cheers and support. Wishing the best of luck to my teammates tomorrow!! I’ll be cheering from the sidelines on this one.🙏❤️ pic.twitter.com/5siYwSFxMT Shiffrin was left with only the 19th DNF of her World Cup career, and the first since all the way back in January 2018.

We saw our first snow game last Thursday in Cleveland, and the we could see a variety of NFL weather on Sunday and Monday. After losing to the Browns, Pittsburgh will make another trip to Ohio as a three-point road underdog at Cincinnati in the Week 13 NFL odds, with an over-under of 46.5. In other NFL games this week, the Patriots host the Colts (-2.5, 42.5), the Jets host the Seahawks (+1.5, 41.5) and the Bills host the 49ers (+6.5, 44.5). You'll need to keep weather in mind before making any NFL betting picks. Speaking of the Browns, they will get an extended mini-bye as their Thursday victory is followed by a Monday Night Football appearance. Browns vs. Broncos features a pair of squads that are very familiar with wintery conditions, and Denver is favored by six points at home, according to the Week 13 NFL Vegas odds, one of the largest NFL spreads of the week. All of the updated Week 13 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 13 NFL picks now. The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model entered Week 13 of the 2024 NFL season on an incredible 22-8 betting hot streak on top-rated NFL picks this year.

Anyone following at sportsbooks and on betting apps has seen strong returns. Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 13 NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. We can tell you one of the model's strongest Week 13 NFL picks is that the Saints (+2.5, 49) cover the spread at home versus the Rams. The model has New Orleans not only covering, but outright winning, as it has the Saints prevailing versus the spread well over 70% of the time. New Orleans has a rest advantage, coming off its bye, and the Saints have been revitalized under interim coach Darren Rizzi. The team has three offensive touchdowns of 40-plus yards since he took over two games ago, after the Saints had just one such score over its previous seven games combined. The defense has also noticeably improved and allowed fewer points in each of its last five games, holding opponents to 17 or fewer in Rizzi's two games. As for L.A., it's coming off a game in which it allowed two touchdowns of 70-plus yards as the Rams defense ranks 26th or worse in points allowed, yards allowed and rushing defense. When you factor in that the Saints have beaten the Rams in four straight regular-season matchups in New Orleans, you can see why the SportsLine model is so bullish on the Saints (+2.5) covering as underdogs. See which other teams to pick here. Another one of its Week 13 NFL predictions: the Jets (-1.5, 41.5) cover at home versus the Seahawks. New York is coming off a bye, while the Seahawks will have a cross-country flight, which hasn't been very conducive to them having success recently. The Seahawks have covered just once over their last five games in the Eastern Time Zone. Additionally, Seattle is just 1-5 straight-up over its last six road games versus the Jets. The line moved almost a field goal in the two hours leading up to kickoff with late money coming in on the Jets. This game pits Seattle's No. 2 passing offense versus New York's second-ranked passing defense, so with those two cancelling each other out, the run game could make the difference. That's where the Jets have the edge as just six teams allow fewer yards per rush than New York, while the Seahawks rank 28th in both rushing yards per game and yards per carry. The model has New York covering in over 50% of simulations, and it also says the Under hits almost 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here. The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 13 NFL schedule and just revealed four teams that outright win at least 70% of the time, potentially giving you a huge payday. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.

Cincinnati (4-7) has been prolific on offense, with quarterback Joe Burrow and wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase having erupted recently. In his last two games, Burrow has thrown for 784 yards, seven touchdowns and no interceptions. Still, the Bengals are virtually on the brink of elimination. With 10 wins likely to grab the final AFC Wild Card spot, Cincinnati has little to no room for error going forward and is 1-4 against the spread at home, but has covered in two of the last three games. Can the Bengals take down the AFC North leaders this week at home, where the latest NFL weather is calling for sunny skies and temperatures around 30? Before you make any Week 13 NFL picks, be sure to see the exact NFL score predictions from SportsLine expert Eric Cohen. Cohen, a SportsLine NFL expert and host of the Friday ""Early Edge NFL Props Show"" on SportsLine's YouTube page, evaluated the entire Week 13 NFL slate and delivers NFL score predictions and NFL analysis for each matchup.

After diving into all 16 games from the NFL's Week 13, Cohen is high on the Buffalo Bills (-6.5, 44.5) to beat the San Francisco 49ers, 31-17 on Sunday Night Football. The Bills have six straight games, including handing the Chiefs their first loss, 30-21 in Week 11. Quarterback Josh Allen is playing at an elite level, having thrown for 2,543 yards and 18 touchdowns, against five interceptions. He has added 316 yards and five scores rushing and is the current favorite for the league's MVP award. Running back James Cook has been excellent in his third season, with 596 yards rushing, 182 receiving, and 11 total touchdowns. Buffalo ranks fourth in the NFL in points scored (320) and boasts the league's second-highest point differential (+106). Against a 49ers team who is struggling at 5-6, the Bills' home field advantage should be a key factor, with a lake effect snow warning in effect before kickoff. Cohen believes that even if San Francisco plays well, Buffalo is too strong right now and will cover the touchdown spread. See his other Week 13 football score predictions at SportsLine.

CBSSports.com Headlines,"Ryan Day blew it with Kyle McCord ousting, offensive overhaul that came up short yet again versus Michigan",https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/ryan-day-blew-it-with-kyle-mccord-ousting-offensive-overhaul-that-came-up-short-yet-again-versus-michigan/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 16:56:08 +0000",Fran Brown owes Day a bottle of Dom Perignon after the Buckeyes jettisoned McCord,"The sport's most expensive roster was built to avoid a result like this. An offseason overhaul that saw Ryan Day give up play-calling duties to his mentor Chip Kelly and aggressively pursue some of the nation's top portal options -- the No. 1 overall player in Caleb Downs, the No. 1 running back in Quinshon Judkins, for starters -- should have managed more than 10 points in a losing effort against a 7-5 Michigan team.  Everyone in the sport knew why Ohio State went on its offseason shopping spree. After watching its archrival Michigan win the national championship last season, Ohio State's power players tried to do everything in their power to prevent it from happening again. They wanted that glory that comes with sitting atop the sport. The total price to try to ensure that was more than $20 million for this 2024 version of the Ohio State Buckeyes, according to athletic director Ross Bjork. Judkins, the transfer from Ole Miss, committed to Ohio State the night of Michigan's national championship win, if it gives you any idea of the desperation to send a message.  That included raiding the SEC for two first-team all-SEC players (Judkins, Downs) and a starting center (Seth McLaughlin). The Buckeyes also added the nation's No. 1 overall recruit, Jeremiah Smith, a freak receiver who OSU had to fight Miami late to hold onto.  But, perhaps, the most important decision Day made was jettisoning Kyle McCord, last year's starting quarterback, in the favor of a transfer portal option that turned out to be Kansas State QB Will Howard.  In a poetic sense, Saturday's action showed how Day erred there.  McCord was badly maligned last season as critics believed he was holding back OSU's all-star cast which included first-round receiver Marvin Harrison Jr.. A New York Giants assistant coach even tried to goad Harrison into calling out a poor McCord throw during the draft process, which Harrison Jr. refused to do.  After a 30-24 loss to Michigan last year, Day declined to commit to McCord long-term and all but pushed him out the door. It was a bold move but one that was largely accepted at the time. McCord landed at Syracuse, a signal to some that there wasn't as robust a market for the Ohio State transfer as one would have anticipated. And yet as Will Howard struggled in a loss to Michigan, throwing two costly interceptions, McCord was up in Syracuse out-dueling the nation's best quarterback, Cam Ward, in a thrilling comeback 42-38 win over No. 6 Miami. Down 21-0 early in the second quarter, McCord erupted for 380 yards and three touchdowns on 26 of 36 passes.  When asked after the game about beating Miami while his former school Ohio State lost to Michigan yet again, McCord had the perfect response.  ""Everything comes full circle,"" McCord said. Syracuse coach Fran Brown, who deserves Coach of the Year consideration after guiding the Orange to a 9-3 record in his first year, made headlines earlier this year that he should send Day a bottle of champagne for letting him have McCord. I asked McCord in October what caliber champagne Brown ought to send Day and after a good laugh about it, McCord finished with, ""Time will tell."" Time told that Brown better send Day a bottle of Dom Perignon to drown his sorrows for making a catastrophic mistake in letting McCord leave the program. McCord looked freer and more confident this season than he ever did at Ohio State, a credit to Brown and a knock on Day whose teams always seem to take on his personality and turtle up in big games. McCord has a nation's best 4,326 passing yards plus 29 touchdowns (fourth-best in the country).  ""A lot of that comes from self-confidence as well as knowing all the coaches and all the guys around me have confidence in me,"" McCord told CBS Sports earlier this year. ""When you put in a lot of preparation and you watch a ton of film and study the playbook, it allows you to go out in a game and just play free. Trust your eyes, trust what you see and just let it rip."" McCord told me he prepared like he had something to prove ""because obviously I do"" and that ""you have to have the mindset you're the best player on the field."" That confidence did wonders for McCord and Syracuse against Ward and Miami in what could be the biggest win in decades for the program.  And it was certainly needed Saturday in Columbus. It's not fair to put the blame on Howard, who took a big hit against the Wolverines and never quite looked completely the same afterward. Day and Kelly insisted on trying to ride with an inefficient run game that averaged 2.96 yards per carry and managed only 77 yards total. Judkins, the highly-anticipated Ole Miss transfer who is believed to be the highest-paid running back in college football, had 46 rushing yards on 17 carries. Ohio State showed sparks of life when it sped up its tempo but Day was never willing to fully commit to it.  After a fourth consecutive loss to Michigan, the calls for Day's dismissal have increased as has the pressure on the team to win it all to justify this team's hefty expense. If it doesn't work, Day will think back on an offensive offseason overhaul that went bust. MORE: After Ohio State once again came up short, it must go on deep CFP run for Day's sake"

Before tuning into Sunday's game, you need to see the NFL picks from SportsLine's advanced computer model. The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 13 of the 2024 NFL season on an incredible 22-8 betting hot streak on top-rated NFL picks this year. Longer term, it is on a 202-136 roll on top-rated NFL picks that dates back to the 2017 season and a 56-29 roll on top-rated NFL picks since Week 7 of 2022. The model also ranked in the top 10 on NFLPickWatch four of the past six years on straight-up NFL picks and beat more than 94% of CBS Sports Football Pick'em players four times during that span. Anyone following at sportsbooks and on betting apps has seen strong returns. For Patriots vs. Colts, the model is backing New England to cover the spread. The Colts have more consistently covered this season, however, they are 1-3-0 ATS over their last four games. Quarterback Anthony Richardson had a strong outing against the New York Jets in Week 11 but has a completion percentage under 42% in three of his last four games. He could have an even harder time moving the ball downfield in Week 13 because of an injury-plagued receiving corps and offensive line. Drake Maye, meanwhile, has completed over 59% of his passes in four straight games. He is interception-prone, but will also be going up against a Colts defense that has given up the second-most yards in the league (4,510). It isn't likely the Patriots will rout the Colts, but the model does have them covering the spread in over 60% of simulations. You can stream the game here. Now that you know what to pick, get ready to watch your live local NFL on CBS games on Paramount+ on any device you want. Don't forget you can get Paramount+ for $2.99/month for two months (expires 12/4/24)."

Despite the fact that the Wolverines are only 7-5, I don't expect the Buckeyes to fall too far in the rankings because of the loss.  No. 10 Indiana is the absolute floor for them because of Ohio State's dominant win over the Hoosiers just one week ago. However, I am projecting them to be ahead of 8th-ranked Tennessee as well, which is due to the fact that the Buckeyes have two top-10 wins, one of which came on the road. In the SEC, No. 3 Texas won at No. 20 Texas A&M 17-7 as their rivalry was renewed for the first time in 13 years. The win put the Longhorns in the SEC Championship Game against No. 7 Georgia. The Bulldogs needed eight overtimes to beat Georgia Tech on Friday night, but their spot in the SEC title game had already been assured. My CFP projection is based on a win by Georgia over Texas for the SEC title, which would give the Bulldogs the No. 2 seed. The Longhorns should not be hurt too badly if the game is competitive, but Georgia would definitely jump them. The No. 1 seed in the CFP is projected to be Big Ten regular season champion Oregon. The top-ranked Ducks will now play No. 4 Penn State for the Big Ten title following Ohio State's loss and the Nittany Lions' win over Maryland. They win the tiebreaker with Indiana because of the conference records of their league opponents. The Hoosiers remain projected to be the last team in following a 66-0 rout of Purdue in a game that was not as close as the score would indicate. Indiana needed a dominant win to try and protect its position against teams playing better opponents.

The difference is that the Hurricanes lost a conference game, which dropped them out of the ACC Championship Game. The Tigers will now be the opponent for No. 9 SMU, which completed an undefeated conference season with a 38-6 win over Cal.   The Big 12 was unusually chalky on Saturday. The teams in control of their own fate for the conference title game both won. No. 16 Arizona State pummeled in-state rival Arizona 49-7, while No. 18 Iowa State took care of 24th-ranked Kansas State 29-21. This will be a one-bid league, although you will note that I do not have the champion projected as the last team in the field. That is one change this week. I may make adjustments to these projections when the CFP rankings are released on Tuesday evening. Now that the regular season is over, teams that are not playing this week typically hold their spots relative to each other, so my changes would reflect that. The teams playing in championship games can move around some, of course. For example, if Ohio State is ahead of Tennessee this week, as I am projecting, they will likely be ahead next week as well, although some other team that is playing could jump in between. As the dust settled, we ended up with the exact number of bowl-eligible teams needed to fill the games. Nobody will be left out and there are no sub-.500 teams in the postseason. Most bowls will not announce their matchups until after the championship games next week, but the Bahamas Bowl could announce this week. That is the only bowl not played in the United States, so there is more lead time necessary to make sure everyone has proper paperwork, etc. However, the game is later this season than it has been in the past, so maybe it will be able to wait to announce as well.

The Memphis Grizzlies will stay at home for another  game and welcome the Indiana Pacers at 3:30  p.m.  ET on Sunday at FedExForum. The Grizzlies are strutting in with some offensive muscle as they've averaged 121  points per game  this season.  The Grizzlies' season wasn't pretty last year but it's starting to look like struggles are in the rearview. They came out on top against the Pelicans by a score of  120-109  on Friday.  The Grizzlies got their  victory on the backs of several key players, but it was  Ja Morant out in front who  went 10 for 18 en route to 27 points plus seven  assists and three  steals. Jaren Jackson Jr., on the other hand, was considerably less helpful: he went 0-5  from beyond the arc.  The Grizzlies were working as a unit and  finished the game with 36  assists (they're ranked first in  assists per game overall). That strong performance was nothing new for the team: they've now  racked up at least 29  assists in five consecutive  matches.  Meanwhile,  the point spread  may have favored the Pacers  last Friday, but the final result did not. Their  bruising  130-106 defeat to the Pistons  might stick with them for a while. Indiana's loss signaled the end of their three-game winning streak.  Memphis pushed their record up to 13-7 with the  win, which was their fourth straight  at home. As for Indiana, their defeat  ended  a  four-game streak of wins at home  and  dropped them to 9-11.  Sunday's  matchup is shaping up to be a scrappy  game:  The Grizzlies have crashing the boards this season,  having  averaged 48.2  rebounds per game (they're ranked third in  rebounds per game overall). It's a different story for the Pacers, though, as  they've been averaging  only 40.2. Given the Grizzlies' sizable advantage in that area, the Pacers will need to find a way to close that gap.  Looking ahead, the Grizzlies are the favorite in this one, as the experts expect to see them win by eight  points. They might be worth a quick bet  since they've covered the spread the last six times they've played Indiana.  Memphis is a big 8-point favorite against Indiana, according to the latest NBA odds. The line has drifted a bit towards the Grizzlies, as the game opened with the Grizzlies as a 6.5-point favorite. The oddsmakers are expecting fireworks from the offense and set the over/under at a high 243.5  points.

They will host the Orlando Magic  at 3:30  p.m.  ET at Barclays Center. The Nets might want some stickum for this one  as the team gave up 20 turnovers  on Friday.  The Nets are probably headed into the  match with a chip on their shoulder considering the Magic just ended the team's  three-game winning streak  on Friday. They wound up on the wrong side of a  bruising 123-100 walloping at the hands of Orlando. Brooklyn has struggled against Orlando recently, as the game was their fourth consecutive lost matchup.  The Magic can attribute much of their success to   Franz Wagner, who  went 12 for 20 en route to 29 points plus eight  assists and eight  rebounds, and   Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who  went 7 for 8 en route to 19 points plus two  steals. The dominant performance also gave  Caldwell-Pope a new career-high in  three-point shooting accuracy (80%).  The Magic were working as a unit and  finished the game with 29  assists. They easily outclassed their opponents in that department as the Nets only posted 22.  Brooklyn's loss dropped their record down to 9-11. As for Orlando, the  victory was  the fifth in a row for them, bringing their record for this year to 14-7. Keep an eye on the arc in  Sunday's  contest:  The Nets have been dynamite from deep this season,  having  nailed 39.2% of their  threes per game. It's a different story for the Magic, though, as  they've  only  made 31.9% of their  threes this season. Given the Nets' sizable advantage in that area, the Magic will need to find a way to close that gap.  Orlando is a solid 6.5-point favorite against Brooklyn, according to the latest NBA odds. Bettors have moved against the Magic slightly, as the game opened with the Magic as a 9-point favorite. The oddsmakers are predicting a defensive showdown and set the over/under low at 209.5  points.

This is especially the case for Carolina, for as while anyone will tell you there's no such thing as a moral victory, the past week has offered the Panthers considerably more morale and reason to believe that their franchise is heading in the right direction. After finally piecing together a win streak heading into their bye, Carolina proceeded to give the mighty Kansas City Chiefs all they could handle, sacking Patrick Mahomes five times and tying the game at 27 with 1:46 left to play. While a late field goal ultimately did in the 3-8 Panthers, it marked an inspired effort against the two-time defending champs. It also gave reason to believe that quarterback Bryce Young -- once exiled to the bench -- may very well be the quarterback he was promised to be when he was chosen No. 1 overall in 2023. The Panthers now meet the Buccaneers, who ended a four game losing streak last week with a 30-7 beatdown of the New York Giants and have resumed their charge towards another NFC South title -- a task made more feasible by the return of certain players from injury, including star wide receiver Mike Evans. While a victory alone may not be enough for the 5-6 Bucs to get on the same page as the division leading Atlanta Falcons, what they can't afford is a loss to a Carolina team that has one of the worst records in the NFL. Tampa Bay is a 6-point favorite against Carolina, according to the latest NFL odds. The over/under is 46.5  points. See NFL picks for every single game, including this one, from SportsLine's advanced computer model. Get picks now. After Carolina had dominated Tampa Bay throughout the 2010s, the shoe has been on the other foot as the Bucs have  won eight out of their last 10 games against the Panthers including three in a row. Carolina's last win over Tampa Bay came in 2022, and it halted the Bucs' four-game win streak in the series."

After getting off to a 1-4 start, the Rams were able to piece together a three-game winning streak to improve to 4-4, only to now have stumbled to 5-6 thanks to two losses in their last three games -- including a 37-20 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, in which their run defense was embarrassed to the tune of 255 yards by Saquon Barkley. While all that the Rams want is still out in front of them in a tight NFC West, they have little margin for error while also offering little in terms of what to expect from week to week. The New Orleans Saints, meanwhile, have offered their last several opponents something rather unexpected: After the firing of Dennis Allen, interim coach Darren Rizzi has compelled his team to continue fighting, and they have responded with two straight victories over the Atlanta Falcons and Cleveland Browns entering their Week 12 bye. Coming out of the bye, the Saints are 4-7 and still have a shot at a winning season -- and they can create even more believers with another win under Rizzi. Those will be the stakes at the Superdome this weekend as the Rams try to remain in the hunt for the NFC West while the Saints continue trending towards becoming the NFL's ultimate spoiler. And this game will also continue what has become one of the NFL's more unlikely rivalries, as there has existed a bitterness between these two teams ever since their fateful meeting in the 2018 NFC Championship that sent the Rams to a Super Bowl and left the Saints feeling cheated out of one.

They did both: After a dominant defensive performance and a 16-6 victory, the Seahawks were able to improve to 6-5 and take the upper hand in the battle for their division in the first of two battles with Arizona over a three-week stretch. Those two games against the Cardinals are interrupted by a trip to The Big Apple to play the New York Jets, a team and franchise that is reeling coming off a bye week to interrupt what has been a tumultuous 3-8 season. With coach Robert Saleh and general manager Joe Douglas already gone after midseason firings, quarterback Aaron Rodgers could soon follow them out the door as observers begin to wonder if he will continue to play for the Jets in 2025 -- if he even plays at all. Rodgers will turn 41 next Monday, and the hope in New York is that the early birthday present of a victory can salvage both his and the Jets' respectability. But they've got plenty of old faces on the other sideline to stare down in trying to do so, whether it's former Jets quarterback Geno Smith under center for Seattle or former first-round pick Leonard Williams, who is coming off one of the most dominant performances of his career against Arizona a week ago.

CBSSports.com Headlines,"With the Maui Invitational returning to its scenic Lahaina home, questions emerge about tournament's future",https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/with-the-maui-invitational-returning-to-its-scenic-lahaina-home-questions-emerge-about-tournaments-future/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 16:45:07 +0000","In a time of big economic changes in college athletics, the Maui tournament may be forced to change later this decade if it wants to keep getting the biggest schools","LAHAINA, Hawaii -- Maui is forever scarred. Physically, spiritually, emotionally.  One of the more awe-inspiring and paradisal island landscapes on this planet was permanently changed in August 2023 when cataclysmic wildfires razed almost the entire town of Lahaina, a hamlet humbly posted on Maui's western coastline. The blaze -- brought on by especially dry conditions and accelerated by a superfluity of wind gusts -- came without official governmental warning well in advance, leading to the deaths of at least 102 people. It was the deadliest wildfire on American soil in more than 100 years. Almost all of Lahaina was seared; more than 2,200 homes, churches, businesses and other structures were destroyed. Approximately 8,000 residents had to relocate, many of them living in hotels for months. According to the United States Department of Commerce, the cost of the devastation was $5.5 billion. Though the town has seen accelerated commercial revitalization in some parts, Lahaina by and large is nowhere near close to being fully rebuilt. In some ways, Lahaina can never again be what it once was. A tragedy of this scope will be recounted and remembered for generations, long after we are all gone. The landscape that girdles the town is still covered in singes of black, brown and beige where it should otherwise be green. Inside Lahaina limits, swaths of neighborhoods remain gray blank slates, either from housing foundations that lay in the char or new ones not yet built. Road barriers along Route 30 are scarred with rust-orange, giving evidence of how the flames rolled down from the upper elevations of Maui and pushed right into the Pacific Ocean.  Things do seem to be getting better, though. Look above from Route 30 and you'll see new houses are being built in rows, one after another. They're bringing character and color back. There are blue houses and red houses and yellow houses and green houses. There is that spirit. The Aloha Spirit. You can see what happened here, what's still happening here, what the Lahaina people are persevering through.  Less than two weeks ago, the first family moved back into the first house rebuilt in Lahaina. The second one will soon be next. Then another, then another. There are nearly 250 housing permits already approved, with hundreds more ready to follow in the months ahead. Maui is forever strong. Physically, spiritually, emotionally.  The Maui Invitational, college basketball's most prestigious regular-season event after more than four decades of existence, has kept going despite its toughest stretch in history. Due to COVID, the tournament was forced out of Hawaii 2020 and 2021 and moved to Asheville, North Carolina, then Las Vegas. After coming back to Maui in 2022, the wildfires mandated a relocation to Honolulu in 2023. Tom Valdiserri is the executive vice president and managing director of KemperSports, which has run the Maui Invitational for decades. He flew to the island in February, when it was still unclear whether or not the tournament would be able to return to Lahaina this year. Without disclosing who he was or why he was there, Valdiserri unassumingly asked locals -- at the airport, at hotels and restaurants -- about this famed basketball tournament that might be trying to get back to Lahaina in 2024. What did the people who live here think? Were they ready for it to come back? Was it too soon?  ""Bring it, bring it, bring it,"" was the response, Valdiserri said.  After exceedingly careful consideration with the mayor's office, Lahaina's city council members and Hawaii's governor, the decision was made to bring the Invitational back to its proper home for 2024: The Lahaina Civic Center.  It was an unequivocal success for everyone except UConn, which provided one of the more unexpected storylines in Maui history by going 0-3 despite being the favorite to win the event as the No. 2 team in the country. Instead, Auburn won this year's title in eye-opening fashion and made its case for the patented Maui Bump, while teams like Iowa State, Memphis and Michigan State went 2-1 and got good résumé boosts. Beyond the basketball implications, the joy was what was most abundant. An air of gratitude and appreciation permeated the premises with every game, as febrile fan bases shuffled in and out of the Civic Center. After more than a year of devastation and rebuilding efforts, the Maui Invitational served as the first major event to signal a return to Lahaina as it should be.  You can't really get that just by watching it on television. Being here, seeing how tourists interact with locals, witnessing the exchange of respect, it's something unique in American sports. There is no other arrangement like it. A gym with a capacity of 2,400 -- a simple building that could have easily been phased out in the 1990s in favor of something much bigger and more modern -- has instead continued to play host to some of the best players and coaches in basketball history. Hall-of-Fame figures -- even ones still coming back to watch, just like Magic Johnson and Roy Williams did for this 41st iteration of the Maui Invitational -- give credence to Maui's unique communal aura.  ""It tells the world Maui is open and alive and ready,"" Valdiserri said of high-profile games with high-profile attendees. ""The mayor's been phenomenal. The state has been phenomenal."" That a major American sport continues to hold a crown jewel event at a building that is smaller than plenty of high school gyms speaks to college basketball's charm appeal -- and humble nature of the Hawaiian spirit.  ""It's not just the fact that they're here and there's money coming in, economic development, but people see it as 'it's coming back,'"" Valdiserri said. ""Everything's coming back. They want this tournament. … It means a lot.""  More than 100 students from the Kalama Intermediate School, in nearby Makawao, strummed ukuleles and sang traditional Hawaiian songs on Day 2 of the tournament. During halftime of the championship game between Auburn and Memphis on Wednesday, the Old Lahaina Luau dancers captured the attention of everyone in the gym with their riveting performance. Most of us mainlanders had no idea of the meanings behind the dances, but we were awestruck by it all the same.  ""The Maui Invitational is more than just a basketball tournament,"" Lahaina mayor Richard Bissen said. ""For over 40 years, it has made a significant impact on our community by driving our local economy, supporting community programs and youth initiatives and introducing visitors from across the nation with our unique culture and spirit of aloha."" This year the expectation is to raise close to or more than $24 million for the Lahaina community, Valdiserri said. That means the tournament went a long way to getting Lahaina back to a closer version of normal.  ""Hotel properties have been operating roughly 50% through the year,"" Valdiserri said. ""We're here now, they're about 90% and we're in the shoulder season … what that really means is people are getting back to work earlier than they normally would, because we're here. They need more restaurants, need more servers and bartenders, and hotels need more house cleaners and all that kind of stuff. And then, you know, even the Westin this year, they bought inventory that they've never bought before. And the reason why they did it is because they want the world to know they're open."" The tournament was gifted something terrific in its anticipated return: the best Day 1 in Maui history.  ""Monday's games, the consensus around those people, with other just general fans that I ran into: best first day of the tournament, we couldn't ask for three better games to tip it off,"" Nelson Taylor, Maui's tournament director, said. ""So to be able to bring back and see those faces again and have them be excited to greet us. Just phenomenal."" The wildfires prompted more support for the Maui Invitational and the citizens of Lahaina and Maui than the area had ever seen. Taylor and others working to help the Hoops for 'Ohana auction (to benefit the Maui Strong fund) reached out to all 102 schools that have participated in the event for the past 41 years. The schools donated items to auction, in addition to Kansas, Illinois, Tennessee and Michigan State playing exhibition games to benefit the Maui Strong fund. It's always been a special event on the sports calendar -- the Monday tip-off symbolizing the unofficial alert that Thanksgiving week has indeed arrived -- but to witness this year's was to see an increased respect and appreciation. ""Collectively, through the auction and the broader college basketball community, we raised over $1.7 million for wildfire relief,"" Taylor said. ""The response that we saw from the schools and the fans and willingness to support shows, I think, the position the tournament has within college basketball shows how important it is to them to support.""  What the Maui Invitational means to the island is a kinship. Its return to Lahaina was significant not just for the people of Maui, but because of the timing amid the modern landscape of college sports. For as memorable as the 2024 tournament was, questions loom over how the tournament will change later this decade, as economic forces in college sports continue to threaten the business model that built Maui into a behemoth.  There's a chance the 2024 field, which included four top-12 teams and could realistically wind up having as many as seven of its participants make the 2025 NCAA Tournament, is the last great Maui bracket ever. There is a catch to the glamour and prestige of a Maui invite: Schools lose a lot of money for the opportunity to play on a huge stage in a small gym. Sources that played both in this year's tournament and have played in previous versions all said the price is easily north of $400,000, with some schools putting the cost well above $450,000 when taking charter flights into account.  ""When you compare it to three games elsewhere with guarantees or [home game revenue], when you put it in that context, the disparity is enormous,"" one source said.  The bill also includes hotel rooms, meals, on-site events and ticket packages the athletic departments have to sell to fans, which schools pay for in advance. Universities don't recoup that money. Nobody that plays in the Maui Invitational winds up coming close to breaking even.  In a previous time, this was worth it. Maui was the biggest basketball TV draw the week of Thanksgiving and its competitors lagged far behind. But not in 2024. More games than ever are watchable, and with other events creeping in -- like the Players Era Festival, which is purportedly set to pay out nearly $9 million to the eight teams that played in this year's first-of-it-kind multi-team-event in Las Vegas -- Maui's business model can get threatened in a hurry.  ""I have a really strong idea of the two sponsors who are on the floor and what they paid,"" Valdiserri said of Players Era. ""And right now, we have a good idea, based on the pricing of their tickets and the fans that we're seeing … and so I don't see it. I don't see $8 million."" ""I'm not disparaging them,"" Valdiserri added. ""They're very interesting. It's a really unique (event) and it's obviously shaken the industry a little bit. … I think there's a lot of wait-and-see."" Even beyond the Players Era Festival, there are one-off events like the one Duke and Kansas played in Las Vegas on Tuesday, which benefitted those schools because they were paid handsomely to play in that game. In a world where coaches and athletic directors are desperate to make real money anywhere they can to raise for NIL, the Maui Invitational is, for now, opting to survive on its pristine reputation. ""We will continue to make sure that we make the appropriate decisions for the tournament to keep it relevant,"" Taylor told CBS Sports.  The format is not going to change for the next three years, organizers said. The teams that have agreed to play for 2025, 2026 and 2027 have done so knowing it will still be three games in three days with the same bracket arrangement Maui has been for most of its existence. That doesn't mean it can't change, but it's not expected to until at least 2028. This has caused some notable high-major programs to pass on considering Maui for the near-term, though not all. ""Schools that were here in '22 and '23  have already said we want to come back,"" Valdiserri said. ""But I think with the way and the speed at which things are changing, we have to be looking at everything. There's nothing that can't be on the table right now, and that is including the format adjustments, the financial format. We have to look at new ways to bring sponsors on and create more inventory so that we're keeping it alive from a sponsor standpoint.""  With a few notable exceptions, if Maui wants to continue to produce the best fields, it's probably going to have to break from tradition. It's going to have to figure out a way to make it so teams don't have to lose money to come to play. Come 2028, this might no longer be three games in three days with eight teams in the same bracket anymore. There could be four high-majors and four mid-majors. Organizers might have to start paying schools, or players, in an effort to making the trip as close to a break-even proposition as possible.  ""As the marketplace changes, as the industry changes, we're not going to sit and stand pat,"" Valdiserri said. ""We're going to do whatever we need to do to stay relevant without sacrificing who we are and what this tournament is to the fans, the players and coaches."" In recent weeks, I spoke with nearly a dozen sources about the pros and cons of playing in Maui. The common theme: It's such an amazing event, but the cost and the travel almost make it not worth it. Organizers charge schools a $35,000 marketing fee alone. The resorts the teams stay in are gorgeous -- and obviously pricey -- and for most part are paid for by the schools. Meantime, other events and/or showcases are providing hotel rooms at major discounts and paying teams tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to participate. The model is admittedly year-by-year in a business with tight margins, but a lot schools preparing for potential revenue sharing of their college athletes aren't going to be jumping at the chance to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars just to play three games. ""I'm not sure how MTEs can survive making schools pay that type of money,"" a coach who participated in the Maui Invitational told CBS Sports. On Saturday, UConn coach Dan Hurley said he would never play in a three-day MTE again. ""Maui's the only one I've ever seen where they don't do anything for you, monetarily,"" another source said. ""The fact you have to pay to go and they don't give you anything, it's unusual you have to pay to get into the tournament and they don't provide anything other than the games. ... It's like bowl games, man. It's been this way for so long, people want to be in the tournament, but it's not advantageous like before."" Valdiserri and Taylor told CBS Sports that, in addition to the 2025 field that's already been announced, they've received commitment from eight schools apiece for 2026 and 2027. The 2025 field is Arizona State, Chaminade, NC State, Seton Hall, Texas, UNLV, USC and Washington State. (In keeping with the tournament's origin story, Chaminade will continue to play in odd-numbered years.) The 2026 field is tentatively scheduled to include the likes of Arizona, BYU, Maryland, Ole Miss, Providence and VCU. Those fields are substandard to Maui's usual crop. (Arizona State and Washington State were backfills after Baylor and Oregon bailed and paid $200,000 to not be in Maui, instead opting for Players Era.)  Maui also comes with travel concerns that no other event carries. Coaches have lamented how the adjustment back to the mainland can have some lag on their teams.  ""It's too much travel,"" one source told CBS Sports. ""The next two weeks have a real impact on it. We love it .... but we don't think we're going to do it again."" Said another high-major source: ""There are many prominent teams that feel like the three-day format in three days and travel distance and finances of Maui, Battle 4 Atlantis and some others need to adjust. The 2025 fields already shows signs of the shifting mentality."" One coach going on the record about his eagerness to return: Auburn's Bruce Pearl. His team won it this year and came in third in 2018, the same season the Tigers made their only Final Four.  ""I will take Auburn back here anytime they'll have us,"" Pearl told CBS Sports after winning the title Wednesday. ""Coaches, we are still old school and we're going to abide by certain traditions. And you know, as long as ESPN continues to put -- as long as we get the right time slots. In the sense that it won't be about NIL. There was Duke-Kansas during this week. That took a primetime spot. There's just more competition."" Pearl also told me he believes so long as television continues to make Maui a priority, and national media members continue to show up to cover the games, top-25-level schools will continue to want to be in it. ""It's an environment like no other,"" Valdiserri said. ""And there are moments where it's louder than any place I've been, including Final Four, World Series, NBA, I've been to all of them, Super Bowl. There's nothing like it. You know, Bill Self said a few years ago, it's better than the Final Four in terms of the atmosphere, because the fans are IN it, and I think that's what coaches get off on, too."" But if it's going to remain special and keep bringing the likes of UNC, Kansas, Duke, Michigan State, UConn, Gonzaga, UCLA, Arizona and on and on, it can't continue as it's been. Maui will always be special, but there's no bequeathal ensuring it will always be the best. The Great Alaska Shootout was once a terrific men's basketball event that brought in top-10 teams and was a sibling November tournament to Maui. It disappeared in 2017 after a prolonged run of being a mid-major event.  ""Nobody can predict the future,"" Valdiserri said. ""I get where some things are heading. I also see some events that pop up really quickly, and then they realize, holy cow, that's just not working. And you know, we're in it for the long haul."" Sitting in that cozy gym on the hill on the northern edge of Lahaina, I can testify to the Maui Invitational's irresistible appeal once you're there, on the island, experiencing the drama and inside the deafening cement walls of that bare-bones gymnasium. A unique setting in American sports. And this year, with gratitude and renewed purpose -- both for Lahaina and for people on the basketball side -- it never meant more than in 2024.  So let's hope that some of the forces that have changed college sports for the worse don't come down on this event as well. If Maui needs to change its tournament format and money situation in order to keep getting top-10 teams playing each year, then do it -- and don't wait until 2028, because things can flip in a hurry in college athletics. The Maui Invitational is too good of a thing to see spoiled by the economic maelstrom that has sucked up a lot of what we love about college sports. Some things are so pure they need to be saved at all costs, few of them more meaningful than the beloved Maui Invitational."

For all their success so far this season, both the Vikings and Cardinals find themselves looking up at a division foe entering this pivotal month in the year, and both had greatly frustrating experiences a week ago -- albeit with opposite outcomes. For the Vikings, what should have been a routine onside kick recovery to seal a 27-24 victory over the Chicago Bears turned into a complete disaster on special teams, as the Bears were able to recover the onside kick with 22 seconds left and then kick a field goal to force the game to overtime. Though Minnesota could have crumbled in that moment, they were able to dig deep and persevere as a 29-yard field goal by John Parker Romo allowed them to escape the scare with a 30-27 victory that improved them to 9-2, bit still leaves them chasing the 10-1 Detroit Lions for the NFC North title. The Cardinals, meanwhile, had an opportunity to take firm control of the NFC West in a divisional showdown with the Seattle Seahawks, only to get beaten into submission and relinquish control of the top of the standings to Seattle. After being shut down in a 16-6 loss, the 6-5 Cardinals are now on the wrong end of a tiebreaker with the Seahawks for the division lead, and are only a slight step above the 5-6 49ers and Rams, making their trip to Minneapolis one that they can't afford to return from empty handed. Minnesota is a 3.5-point favorite against Arizona, according to the latest NFL odds. The over/under is 45  points. See NFL picks for every single game, including this one, from SportsLine's advanced computer model. Get picks now. Minnesota has won three out of its last five games against Arizona.

Stroud stepped out of the back of his own end zone while being pursued while the Texans were down by three with 73 seconds to play. For the sake of their ambitions, and with the Indianapolis Colts still not far behind at 5-7, what the Texans cannot afford is a second straight loss to an opponent at the bottom of the division, a foe which they now face in the Jacksonville Jaguars. At 2-9, the Jags are tied for the worst record in the NFL and had lost four straight games entering their Week 12 bye. The future of Jags coach Doug Pederson -- and perhaps quarterback Trevor Lawrence, once hailed as the savior of the franchise -- hangs in the balance over the course of Jacksonville's final six games of the season. The Texans will be looking to complete a season sweep, as they have already beaten the Jaguars, 24-20, back in Week 4.

Brown is an icon at North Carolina with a 282-150-1 all-time record over two stints at the university, but the North Carolina Athletic Director Bubba Cunningham announced on Nov. 26 that Brown wouldn't be back as head coach next season. The next North Carolina football coach will take over for a legend who won more than 65% of his games over 16 seasons with the Tar Heels. Will UNC seek a coach with head coaching experience like it did in bringing Brown back in 2019? Could there be a young, up-and-coming coordinator who will emerge during the North Carolina football coaching search? If you love the Tar Heels, or just want to know who will call the shots for UNC football in the future, be sure to see what the proven team of insiders are saying at InsideCarolina, the 247Sports affiliate that covers UNC. The InsideCarolina insiders are providing on-the-ground updates on every development surrounding Brown's departure and the future of the UNC football program, including insights from Evans Rogers and Buck Sanders, who have deep-rooted ties inside and around the UNC community.

The team at InsideCarolina already has a list out of several potential candidates and there are some surprising names on the list. Head to InsideCarolina now to see them all.  One name the staff has identified as a potential target is Georgia defensive coordinator Glenn Schumann. Six Georgia assistant coaches under Kirby Smart have left to become head coaches, most notably Dan Lanning, who was coaching the No. 1 team in the nation after 13 weeks. Lanning has Oregon off to an 11-0 start in his third season as the Ducks head coach and Schumann followed a similar trajectory to Lanning. Lanning was a graduate assistant at Alabama and a linebackers coach at Georgia before becoming the Bulldogs' defensive coordinator.  Schumann was also a graduate assistant for Nick Saban and linebackers coach for Smart before becoming Georgia's defensive coordinator. Schumann took over as defensive coordinator after Lanning became head coach at Oregon and after seeing how quickly Lanning elevated the Oregon program, North Carolina may see something similar in Schumann's potential. Georgia ranked seventh in scoring defense last year and fifth the season before in Schumann's first two years as Georgia's defensive coordinator. See more candidates at InsideCarolina. The rest of the list includes several other intriguing names, including two former NFL head coaches and a college coach who is on a ""meteoric"" rise. You can only see who they are at InsideCarolina.

CBSSports.com Headlines,"MLB rumors: A Juan Soto free-agency sweepstakes update, plus the Orioles hunt for starting pitching",https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-rumors-a-juan-soto-free-agency-sweepstakes-update-plus-the-orioles-hunt-for-starting-pitching/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 15:57:21 +0000","Here are your hot stove rumors for Sunday, Dec. 1","A quick glance at Mike Axisa's handy offseason guide to key dates shows that we're just one week away from the Winter Meetings. Most offseasons, that means business is about to pick up. Sometimes it doesn't, but we'll hold out hope that it means we're in for a busy week of rumors before the Winter Meetings provide lots of movement.  Given that it is the Sunday after Thanksgiving, things are bound to be slow for this particular day, but there could well be some foundation laying for the two weeks ahead.  We'll gather the news and rumors for the day right now. Let's get on with it.  Through much of the offseason so far, most of us have believed free-agent superstar Juan Soto was going to end up in New York, with either the Yankees or Mets. The leaders in the race at this juncture, however, are the Mets and Red Sox, according to Randy Miller of NJ.com. He says that the Yankees are likely to cap their bid around $550 million while the assumption is the Red Sox and Mets might go to $600 million.  Also of note here, ""I heard [Soto] was very impressed with the Red Sox and the Red Sox are telling Soto that they're going to bring in a couple of extra players in addition to him."" The Red Sox finished last season 81-81, which was five games out of a playoff spot. Soto was worth 7.9 WAR last season when he hit .288/.419/.569 (178 OPS+) with 41 homers, 109 RBI and 128 runs.  The Dodgers, Blue Jays and Yankees are the other three teams that have been heavily connected to Soto in addition to the Mets and Red Sox.  One big-time starting pitcher is off the market so far this offseason, as southpaw Blake Snell has signed with the Dodgers. We heard in the aftermath that the Orioles were one of the teams in on Snell. The big takeaway there is that the Orioles were discussing a very high-priced free agent pitcher. They haven't been swimming in that pool in a long time. Roch Kubatko of MASN Sports reports that bringing back Corbin Burnes ""remains a possibility"" and the Orioles' reported interest in Nathan Eovaldi has long been assumed as a possible play.  Burnes, 30, won the NL Cy Young in 2021 and has gotten Cy Young votes five straight seasons, finishing fifth in the AL last year. He was 15-9 in 2024 with a 2.92 ERA (128 ERA+), 1.10 WHIP and 181 strikeouts in 194 ⅓ innings. In his lone playoff start, he allowed one run on five hits in eight innings.  Eovaldi, 34, is the much cheaper option in free agency. He went 12-8 with a 3.80 ERA (104 ERA+), 1.11 WHIP and 166 strikeouts in 170 ⅔ innings last season for the Rangers. He's a two-time All-Star with good postseason pedigree, but he isn't Burnes."

Longer term, it is on a 202-136 roll on top-rated NFL picks that dates back to the 2017 season and a 56-29 roll on top-rated NFL picks since Week 7 of 2022. The model also ranked in the top 10 on NFLPickWatch four of the past six years on straight-up NFL picks and beat more than 94% of CBS Sports Football Pick'em players four times during that span. Anyone following at sportsbooks and on betting apps has seen strong returns. Now, the model has set its sights on Buccaneers vs. Panthers and just locked in its picks and NFL Week 13 predictions. You can head to SportsLine now to see the model's picks. Here are several NFL odds and betting lines for Bucs vs. Panthers: Tampa Bay got a big performance from quarterback Baker Mayfield in last week's blowout win over the Giants. Mayfield completed 24 of 30 passes for 294 yards, while rushing four times for 29 yards and a score. On the season, the Bucs QB has thrown for 2,799 yards with 24 touchdowns and nine interceptions. Having top wide receiver Mike Evans back in the lineup helped as well, catching five passes for 68 yards in the 30-7 victory. The real star for Tampa Bay was running back Bucky Irving, who rushed for 87 yards and a touchdown, while catching six passes for 64 yards. Fellow running backs Rachaad White and Sean Tucker also rushed for short touchdowns, but seem to have been passed on the depth chart by the rookie Irving. The Panthers give up a league high 160.5 yards on the ground so Tampa Bay's rushers should feast once again this week. See which team to pick here. The three-win Panthers put a scare into the league's top team, Kansas City, in part due to the fine play of second year quarterback Bryce Young. The former No. 1 overall pick, who was benched earlier this season, threw for 265 yards and a touchdown, while not turning the ball over against a top defense. He seems to have made strides in his development and should continue his progress for the remainder of the season. Carolina's offensive star in 2024 has been running back Chuba Hubbard, who rushed for 58 yards and a score against a stingy Kansas City rush defense. Once an afterthought in the Panthers offense, Hubbard has rushed for 876 yards and scored eight times (including one receiving) this season. Second round pick Jonathon Brooks made his NFL debut last week, carrying the ball two times for seven yards, and should see more action going forward. The Panthers have young pieces in their offense who look to be building blocks for the future. See which team to pick here. The model has simulated Tampa Bay vs. Carolina 10,000 times and the results are in. It is leaning Over on the point total, and it also says one side of the spread hits almost 60% of the time.

New Orleans is wrapping up a three-game homestand that began with wins over the Falcons and Browns to keep its playoff hopes alive. Los Angeles has lost two of its last three games to fall back below the .500 mark overall this season, including a 37-20 setback against Philadelphia last week. The Rams are only one game back of the Seahawks and Cardinals atop the NFC West standings.  Kickoff is set for 4:05  p.m.  ET on Sunday at Caesars Superdome. The Rams are favored by 2.5 points in the latest Saints vs. Rams odds, while the over/under is 49 points per SportsLine consensus. Los Angeles is a -148 money line favorite (risk $148 to win $100), while New Orleans is a +125 underdog.

Here are several NFL betting lines for the game: New Orleans lost seven consecutive games while dealing with multiple key injuries earlier this season, but it has responded with back-to-back wins to keep its playoff hopes alive. The Saints likely need to win almost all of their remaining six games under interim head coach Darren Rizzi. Taysom Hill has provided a boost since returning from an upper body injury, creating a formidable backfield with running back Alvin Kamara.  The Saints have rushed for at least 197 yards in two of their last three games, including 214 against the Browns two weeks ago. Hill had a career-best 138 yards and three rushing touchdowns, and he is facing a Rams defense that gave up 314 rushing yards to the Eagles last week. New Orleans has covered the spread in nine of its last 13 Sunday games. See which team to pick here.  Los Angeles will be looking to use its strong defensive front to apply pressure on Saints quarterback Derek Carr, who has only been sacked seven times this season. The Rams have a pair of elite young pass rushers in rookies Braden Fiske and Jared Verse, along with second-year players Byron Young and Kobie Turner. They have combined for 21.5 of the team's 28 sacks this season.  The Rams have also been improving in the secondary, as rookie safeties Kam Kinchens and Jaylen McCollough have seven of the team's 10 interceptions. Los Angeles has also been able to lean more on its passing attack since wide receivers Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp returned from injuries, giving quarterback Matthew Stafford some dangerous weapons.

The Texans (7-5) enter off a surprising 32-27 home loss to the Titans, while the Jaguars (2-9) had a bye in Week 12 following a 52-6 road loss to the Lions. Houston won the teams' matchup earlier this season, a 24-20 victory at home.

You can head to SportsLine now to see the model's picks. Here are several NFL odds and betting lines for Texans vs. Jaguars: After a 5-1 start to the season, Houston has dropped four of their last six games heading into Week 13's road matchup. Quarterback C.J. Stroud hasn't been the same since the start of the season, having only thrown for five touchdown passes combined in those six games. On the season, he has thrown for 2,875 yards and 14 scores against nine interceptions. Fortunately for Stroud, Jacksonville is surrendering the most passing yards per game in the league (278.3). Wide receiver Nico Collins has missed five games this season, but when he's been healthy, teams are doing a poor job of slowing him down. Collins has 41 catches for 713 yards and four touchdowns in only seven games, not including a pair of touchdowns called back due to penalty over the last two weeks. On the ground, Joe Mixon has been excellent, with six games of more than 100 yards rushing and ten touchdowns. Jacksonville's poor defense should have trouble with the Texans' weapons this week. See which team to pick here. The Jaguars may be 2-9, but six of those losses were one possession games. With a bit more good fortune, their season could look entirely different at this point. Before the team's bye week, quarterback Trevor Lawrence (shoulder) missed two games but is listed as questionable this week. The former No. 1 overall pick has been a disappointment in his fourth season, with only 2,004 passing yards, 11 touchdown passes, and three rushing scores. If there's been a bright spot for the Jaguars' offense this season, it's rookie wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr., the team's first round pick in April's draft. Thomas leads the team with 42 receptions for 689 yards and five touchdowns. Earlier this season against Houston, Thomas caught six passes for 86 yards and a touchdown. He will need another strong effort for his team to pull the home upset in Week 13. See which team to pick here. The model has simulated Houston vs. Jacksonville 10,000 times and the results are in.

Although Tampa Bay tight end Cade Otton was a top option for daily Fantasy football players over recent weeks, the 25-year-old only had one reception on three targets for 30 yards last week in Mike Evans' first game back. Otton had at least eight targets in the previous four games and that usage increase has lifted his price tag in NFL DFS tournaments and cash games. Is he worth rostering in Week 13 NFL DFS lineups and NFL DFS stacks? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Sunday or locking in NFL DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel, be sure to check out SportsLine's advanced NFL DFS Lineup Optimizer. The DFS Optimizer uses info from the SportsLine Advanced-Data Projection Model and DFS Professional Millionaire Mike McClure to identify top DFS picks/plays for any slate on betting apps like DraftKings and FanDuel. It simulates every game 10,000 times to help DFS players optimize and build winning DraftKings and FanDuel lineups. Optimize, export, and enter lineups confidently with injury updates, floor and ceiling player projections, and Vegas lines and picks all with one winning tool for sports betting apps. Now, SportsLine's NFL DFS Optimizer has turned its attention to Sunday's 2024 NFL Week 13 schedule and just locked in its top daily Fantasy football lineups. You can only see its optimal lineups at SportsLine. One of the Optimizer's top DFS value picks for Sunday is Bengals running back Chase Brown ($6,200 on DraftKings and $7,300 on FanDuel). Brown rushed for 86 yards on 22 carries and added five receptions for 57 yards in Week 11 before Cincinnati's bye last week. The 24-year-old has turned into a workhorse running back over recent weeks, playing at least 80% of snaps in three straight weeks, including 83% against the Chargers in Week 11 Sunday Night Football. Although the Bengals play the Steelers, who have one of the best defenses in the NFL, Brown's usage makes him an appealing option for Week 13 NFL DFS lineups. Brown played more snaps than any other running back in the league in each of his last two games. The Bengals are averaging 34 ppg over their last three games and his opportunity and involvement in both the rushing and passing attack makes him a strong option for NFL DFS picks. Brown has scored a touchdown in three of his last four games and is averaging 6.3 receptions over his last three contests. See who else to pick here. The Optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Chargers wide receiver Ladd McConkey ($6,100 on DraftKings and $6,300 on FanDuel). McConkey had six receptions for 83 yards last week against the Ravens after having six receptions for 123 yards the week before. The second-round pick and No. 34 overall selection in the 2024 NFL Draft is second among rookies in receiving yards (698) this season as he's quickly become Justin Herbert's top option in the passing attack. McConkey leads the Chargers in receptions (49), targets (69) and yards (698). The Chargers are 4-1 over their last five games and averaging 27.4 ppg over that span with the rookie receiver as a key contributor toward that success. The Chargers play the Falcons, who are allowing the highest completion percentage (71.6%) in the league, and with McConkey at a 71% catch rate this season, he and Herbert can find continued success on Sunday. You can see the rest of the Optimizer's NFL DFS picks here. The NFL DFS Optimizer is also targeting multiple undervalued players who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday. Those players could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who they are, and the rest of the Optimizer's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.  So what is the optimal NFL DFS lineup for Sunday, and which under-the-radar NFL DFS picks offer huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, rankings, advice and stacks, all from an NFL DFS Optimizer that simulates every game 10,000 times, and find out."

This will keep Little under contract in Jacksonville through the 2027 season. The deal was made just a few hours ahead of the Jags' Week 13 game against the Houston Texans. According to the report, Jaguars general manager Trent Baalke was significantly involved in the negotiations. Baalke was the interim GM in 2020 after Dave Caldwell was fired and has officially been the team's GM since the 2021 offseason. There are a lot of question marks surrounding the team, which stands at 2-9, last in the AFC South and one of the worst records in the conference. Head coach Doug Pederson is certainly on the hot seat and the Jaguars' last game, a 52-6 loss against the Detroit Lions, didn't help his case. His job survived the bye week, but his time in Jacksonville may be soon over.  The struggles also put a spotlight on Baalke's future and whether he leaves on his own terms, get the boot or stick around. His heavy involvement in securing a piece of the offense for the future does make it look like he is committed to the team, and the team is committed to him, past this year.

CBSSports.com Headlines,"Cardinals vs. Vikings odds, line, start time: 2024 NFL picks, Week 13 predictions from proven model",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/cardinals-vs-vikings-odds-line-start-time-2024-nfl-picks-week-13-predictions-from-proven-model/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 15:14:28 +0000",SportsLine's model just revealed its NFL picks for the Arizona Cardinals vs. Minnesota Vikings on Sunday,"The Arizona Cardinals (6-5) will try to bounce back from their first loss since mid-October when they face the Minnesota Vikings (9-2) on Sunday afternoon. Arizona had its four-game winning streak snapped in a 16-6 loss at Seattle last week, falling a half-game behind Washington for the final NFC wild-card spot. Minnesota is on a four-game hot streak of its own following an overtime win at Chicago last week. The Vikings have not played a home game since their Nov. 3 win over the Colts.  Kickoff is set for 1 p.m. ET on Sunday at U.S. Bank Stadium. The Vikings are favored by 3.5 points in the latest Vikings vs. Cardinals odds, while the over/under is 45 points per SportsLine consensus. Minnesota is a -172 money line favorite (risk $172 to win $100), while Arizona is a +145 underdog. Before entering any Cardinals vs. Vikings picks, you'll want to see the NFL predictions from the model at SportsLine. The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model entered Week 13 of the 2024 NFL season on an incredible 22-8 betting hot streak on top-rated NFL picks this year. Longer term, it is on a 202-136 roll on top-rated NFL picks that dates back to the 2017 season and a 56-29 roll on top-rated NFL picks since Week 7 of 2022. The model also ranked in the top 10 on NFLPickWatch four of the past six years on straight-up NFL picks and beat more than 94% of CBS Sports Football Pick'em players four times during that span. Anyone following at sportsbooks and on betting apps has seen strong returns. The model has set its sights on Arizona vs. Minnesota. You can head to SportsLine to see its picks. Here are several NFL betting lines for the game: Minnesota is returning home following three straight road wins over the Jaguars, Titans and Bears. The Vikings were able to get through that stretch unscathed, remaining one game back of Detroit atop the standings. They have a rematch with the Lions during the final week of the regular season, so they cannot afford a loss in this game.  Veteran quarterback Sam Darnold threw five combined interceptions against the Colts and Jaguars, but he has four touchdowns and zero picks in his two games since then. Darnold has completed 67.6% of his passes for 2,717 yards and 21 touchdowns this season. Minnesota has won 10 straight home games against Arizona and 13 of the last 17 meetings overall. See which team to pick here.  Arizona is coming off a disappointing outing against Seattle, but it won its previous four games to get back into the playoff conversation. The Cardinals scored 28-plus points in their wins over the Dolphins, Bears and Jets, powered by a strong stretch from quarterback Kyler Murray. He has completed 68.7% of his passes for 2,343 yards, 12 touchdowns and just four interceptions this season.  Murray also provides a dynamic rushing ability, racking up 380 yards and four touchdowns on 48 carries. The Cardinals are a half-game back of the Commanders for the final NFC wild-card spot, making every game a crucial one for them right now. Arizona has covered the spread in four of its last five games, while Minnesota is 0-5-2 against the spread in its last seven December games. See which team to pick here. The model has simulated Cardinals vs. Vikings 10,000 times and the results are in. The model is leaning Under, and it's also generated a point-spread pick that is hitting in well over 50% of simulations. You can only see the pick at SportsLine.

This tiny piece of pasta is so small, roughly 372 nanometers, it's actually smaller than some wavelengths of light, and certainly way smaller than anything you can see with the naked eye. It's so small, you could eat a pile of it and still be able to say you didn't cheat on your keto diet. That's what scientists at UCL did: they made the world's tiniest spaghetti. And they made it by pressing flour and water through nanoscopic holes in a piece of metal.   Unfortunately, the tiny pasta is pretty worthless in the culinary world even though they used store-bought flour to make it. Study co-author, Professor Gareth Williams, said, I don't think it's useful as pasta, sadly, as it would overcook in less than a second, before you could take it out of the pan.  Nanofibers, such as those made of starch, show potential for use in wound dressings as they are very porous. In addition, nanofibers are being explored for use as a scaffold to regrow tissue, as they mimic the extracellular matrix — a network of proteins and other molecules that cells build to support themselves. The future is going to be an interesting place. Just imagine your ER visit ten years from now.

Patel has, according to Trump, ""spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American people."" So, obviously, the media, the deep state, and the Democrats are very upset with this pick. Here are a few headlines from major news: ABC:Newsweek:NBC: Newsweek:NBC: Newsweek:NBC: NBC: NBC:  Never mind all of his experience and qualifications. Never mind that, as Robby Starbuck points out:  ""First FBI Director of Color is chosen in groundbreaking and party defying move by president."" But why is MAGA celebrating? Why are the deep state goons peeing their pants? We can find the answer in the ready-to-go New York Times hit piece on Mr. Patel called Five Things to know about Kash Patel. It's the second thing that's the major sticking point: Mr. Trump ordered that Mr. Patel be given a job on the National Security Council staff after Mr. Patel, then a House Intelligence Committee staffer, impressed Mr. Trump as the primary author of what has come to be called the secret ""Nunes memo."" The document was a key element in the effort of House Republicans to undermine the Justice Department's investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election.Mr. Patel's memo, which Mr. Trump declassified over the objections of the intelligence agencies and Democrats, fueled bogus claims by Mr. Trump, Republicans and conservative media that politics drove the Russia investigation and that the government had spied on the Trump campaign itself. Mr. Patel's memo, which Mr. Trump declassified over the objections of the intelligence agencies and Democrats, fueled bogus claims by Mr. Trump, Republicans and conservative media that politics drove the Russia investigation and that the government had spied on the Trump campaign itself. The New York Times is really out here trying to tell us that the Trump-Russia hoax wasn't a hoax, wasn't politics driven, and that the FBI didn't spy on Trump? In the year of our Lord 2024 they still want to act like the FBI is clean as the driven snow? And, yes, this is why they are mad, because their nearly decade-long narrative about Trump and Russia was discredited by Patel, Patel knows that the FBI is a partisan swamp, and Patel is going to do something about it. You can read the rest of the New York Times hit piece, it's all weak sauce about selling t-shirts, disgruntled former coworkers, and Patel not buying the January 6th narrative. This is such a good sign.  Dismantle, disrupt, distract the FBI and to possibly use it as a tool for the president's political agenda. Umm, hello, Russian collusion? This is literally projection. McCabe is super scared that turnabout could become fair play and the FBI could go after his side of the political aisle the same way his side has used the FBI to go after conservatives forever.  ""But he's not qualified!"" the lefties scream at the heavens!  Patel's qualifications? Well, he wants to do THIS:  We need a 24/7 declassification office. Rolling papers out 24/7. And not just like JFK, not just like 9/11 ... as a guy who is an intel guy, who believes wholeheartedly in the classification of information, I believe that it has been over abused by these corrupt officials in government to hide the truth and enact more corrupt activities. This guy ... this is my kind of guy. Exactly the swamp draining type of dude we need in the FBI. Here's an interview he did a few years back all about Spygate.

One day, workers came to the school in the morning to find a total of 15 shoes belonging to 10 children gone missing, with more scattered around the building.   The school reported the incident to the Fukuoka Prefectural Police, and after several recurring thefts, the police installed security cameras to get to the bottom of the bizarre crime spree.  The video revealed that it was not a malicious actor but a sneaky weasel that had a taste for stinky feet. The same night the cameras were installed, the suspect returned around 7:30 pm, when the school was quiet, and quickly snatched a white sneaker from a cubby before running off with it.  One employee at the school said, We were very worried, but now that we know it was an animal, we are relieved.  As for the police, they say they were also surprised to discover the identity of the culprit, saying,  We're relieved that the incident was not caused by a human, but this is the first case of its kind. The stolen shoes have not yet been recovered, but the school has installed netting over the cubby holes at night to prevent the crime spree from continuing, as the suspect still remains at large.

The folks over at The Economist, the economics magazine in Britain, have pored over the US budget and think they know exactly where to make cuts.   I think we can all agree, with the defense spending and endless wars, with a gigantic welfare state, with paying for housing and healthcare for illegal immigrants, and the myriad of fake and gay university studies subsidized by the US government, the first place we need to cut is ... veterans benefits.  The current system was introduced during the first world war. It provides tax-free monthly payments to soldiers who are injured or sick owing to their service. From 1960 to 2000, roughly 9% of veterans qualified for payments, typically for ailments such as hearing loss or burns. The department assigns a rating from zero to 100% based on the severity of disabilities. In 2000 the average rating was 30%; monthly payments averaged the equivalent of $975 today. Few qualified for the top tier.The modern programme bears little resemblance to its original form. This year 6m veterans — or a third of the total — qualified for payments, with an average monthly benefit of $2,200. The modern programme bears little resemblance to its original form.

	Michigan stunned Ohio State in Columbus, then attempted to plant their flag at midfield in Ohio Stadium.","Arguably the most sunning twist of the college football season happened in Columbus on Saturday afternoon. The second-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes played host to the 6-5 Michigan Wolverines, and with a win, the Buckeyes would be able to secure their spot in the Big Ten championship game. Instead, the Wolverines — which were missing two of their best players in tight end Colston Loveland and cornerback Will Johnson — did the unthinkable and pulled off a 13-10 win, their fourth in a row against Ohio State and their first without Jim Harbaugh at the helm since 2011. After the game, things got incredibly tense as Michigan players attempted to plant their flag at midfield in Ohio Stadium. This, unsurprisingly, did not go over well among the players in the scarlet and gray, and as a result, a fight broke out near midfield between both teams. While it’s unclear which players exactly caused things to boil over, it was an ugly scene in the Horseshoe, and it got to the point that the authorities on the field had to use pepper spray, according to reports. The loss knocks the Buckeyes to 10-2 on the season, and while they should still make the playoff, they are almost certainly not going to make the Big Ten title game barring something unforeseen. As for now, Oregon has already earned a berth, while Penn State is in line to make it if they can avoid a loss to Maryland on Saturday afternoon in Happy Valley."

	The Chiefs continue to find new ways to win football games, this time with the Raiders fumbling a snap in field goal range down two.","The Chiefs have had an incredible run of luck this season, which feels borderline unfair for a team as talented as they are to also have luck on their side. They’ve won one-possession games in just about every way possible, with walk-off kicks, blocked kicks, and now, walk-off turnovers.  In a Black Friday slugfest against the Raiders, the Chiefs once again found themselves trailing in the fourth quarter, but were able to march down the field before settling for a field goal to go up 19-17. Vegas, with Aidan O’Connell now under center, isn’t exactly an explosive offense, but in the final minute they were able to cross midfield and were seemingly in field goal range for a game-winning try with 15 seconds left in the game. After spiking it on second down on the 32, the Raiders lined up for third down to try and get a little closer for the kick, but miscommunication on the snap saw the ball bounce off O’Connell’s chest because he wasn’t ready for it, bouncing away where the Chiefs eventually recovered it.  What a WILD ending on Black Friday 👀 pic.twitter.com/JtYRVva6Zy — NFL (@NFL) November 29, 2024  Given the Raiders were out of timeouts, it didn’t really matter who recovered the fumble as the clock would’ve wound down to 0:00 even if O’Connell had corralled it. It’s a horrific way to lose if you’re the Raiders, as this season has been a disaster but they take pride in managing to be a thorn in Kansas City’s side. Unfortunately, one of the complications of being on a backup QB is the snap count can be a bit different, and O’Connell was trying to survey the defense one last time before taking the snap when the ball was suddenly on him. For the Chiefs, they somehow move to 11-1 despite another mediocre offensive showing, but they don’t put pictures on the scoreboard and the win counts all the same to move them one step closer to a first round bye and the top seed in the AFC."

	Black Friday features a 10-game slate of NBA Cup action, and there are a variety of clinch (and elimination) scenarios at stake.","The 2024 Emirates NBA Cup is winding down group stage play, with Friday bringing the fourth and final game for some teams — and the third for others. Two teams (Houston and Golden State) came into Friday having already clinched a spot in the knockout rounds, while a few others (Utah, New Orleans, Washington, and Toronto) had already been eliminated.  In total, 20 teams will be in action on Friday, as the league filled out the Black Friday slate for a full day of Cup action, and there’s plenty at stake when it comes to keeping hope alive of getting to Las Vegas. Here, we’ll go through what’s at stake in each group with Friday’s games ahead of Tuesday night’s group stage finale.  Knicks (3-0) defeat Hornets (0-3)
Magic (2-0) at Nets (1-2) The Knicks beat the Hornets by one in a fun one to open Friday’s action, and in doing so they improved to 3-0 to give themselves a really good look at the knockout rounds — and officially eliminated Charlotte. Orlando needs a win to keep pace with New York (and to boost their odds at the Wild Card), but those two teams will play on Tuesday so even with a loss to Brooklyn, the Magic would be alive to win the group if they can beat the Knicks.  Raptors (0-2) at Heat (1-2)
Pistons (2-0) at Pacers (0-2) The Pistons are the only team playing on Friday still in the hunt for the group. A win over Indiana would give them a big boost in odds to make the knockout rounds, especially if they can get a comfortable win, as they’d be 3-0 before facing the similarly undefeated Bucks. 3-1 will have a good shot at the Wild Card, but they’ll need to boost their point differential (+4) to get there. Toronto and Miami is more a game for pride, but the Heat could technically be in play for a Wild Card with a win as they’d be 2-2 with a good point differential (+10 currently). Miami would need a lot of help, including a Pistons loss, for 2-2 to be the best record of the second place teams in all the groups in the East.  Cavs (1-1) at Hawks (2-1)
Celtics (2-1) at Bulls (2-1) All four of these teams are still alive in the group, as the Wizards (0-3) have been eliminated, and the three 2-1 teams all have clinch scenarios in play today. Atlanta clinches the group with a win over Cleveland and a Chicago win over Boston. Boston clinches with a win over the Bulls and a Cavs win over the Hawks. Chicago clinches with a win over Boston and a Hawks win over the Cavs. Cleveland will be alive for the group win if they beat Atlanta and get a Chicago win over Boston. A loss will effectively eliminate any of these teams from the knockout rounds (as 2-2 will almost assuredly not earn a wild card).  Clippers (1-1) at Timberwolves (1-2)
Kings (0-2) at Blazers (1-1) The 3-0 Rockets have already clinched this group by beating L.A. and Portland, meaning the rest of these teams are all playing for Wild Card berths. The Clippers and Blazers both need wins to give themselves a chance at 3-1, which is obviously much more likely to get a Wild Card spot than 2-2. The Kings and Wolves, meanwhile, will need to not only get wins but get help from around them — while also thinking strongly about point differential if they’re going to make it in a 2-2 tiebreaker.  Thunder (1-1) at Lakers (2-1) Only two teams are in action on Friday for the most competitive group in the West, and this will be an eliminator of sorts. A win will keep OKC alive, with a game against already eliminated Utah left on Tuesday, while the Lakers would wrap up a 3-1 campaign and simply be waiting out the results of Tuesday night’s game between the Suns and Spurs, as they would need a Spurs win to have the head-to-head tiebreaker.  Pelicans at Grizzlies The Warriors have already clinched Group C with a 3-0 record including a win over Dallas. New Orleans is already eliminated, as their point differential of -38 makes it impossible for them to make up ground on other potential 2-2 teams. Memphis is 0-2 and will need a miracle to get in as a Wild Card team, but they’ll need a win on Friday afternoon to keep those slim hopes alive (and preferably by a lot to pad point differential)."

	Shaboozey performed ""A Bar Song,"" ""Last of My Kind,"" and ""Highway"" from Ford Field.","The NFL kicked off its Thanksgiving slate on Thursday afternoon with an NFC North showdown between the Chicago Bears and the Detroit Lions. It’s a matchup between two teams that bookend the division standings — the Lions are on top, the Bears are in the basement — but part of what makes the Thanksgiving games interesting despite that is the pageantry of the whole thing. Of course, there was CBS sending its top crew, the celebration of John Madden, and all the fun little touches that come from games taking place on Thanksgiving. And of course, while it’s not the Super Bowl halftime show, fans at the stadium and watching on television got treated to a performance while both teams made their ways into their respective locker rooms. While Lainey Wilson is scheduled to perform during Giants-Cowboys and Lindsey Stirling is the halftime show during Dolphins-Packers, Shaboozey took the stage at Ford Field during the early game. Unsurprisingly, he performed his smash hit “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” along with “Last of My Kind” and “Highway.”  A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  If you’d like to watch the full performance, you can do that right here. While Shaboozey performed, the Lions were certainly the happier of the two teams in the halftime locker room, as they held a 16-0 lead and limited the Bears to only 53 yards of total offense in the first half."

	The Lions star right tackle hasn't given up a sack all year, but on Thanksgiving he took a sack on a trick play that the Bears covered up.","The Detroit Lions have been the best team in the NFC this season, thanks in part to one of the most balanced offensive attacks in the league. Detroit is built inside out, relying on arguably the best offensive line in football to pave the way for their two-headed rushing attack with David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs, with Jared Goff picking defenses apart in the play-action game off that running game.  On top of that, offensive coordinator Ben Johnson is about as creative as they come when it comes to dialing up some trickeration, and on Thanksgiving he tried to let his star right tackle, Penei Sewell, shine on the Lions first drive of the game. After picking up a first down to put them just outside the red zone, Sewell lined up at tight end and came around on a reverse, but instead of running it, the big fella was looking to throw it downfield. Unfortunately for Sewell, the Lions, and everyone watching hoping to see some Large Man Excellence, the Bears covered it extremely well and there was nowhere for Sewell to go, with the Bears defense eventually swarming him and pushing him out of bounds — because they could not bring him to the ground.  Penei Sewell tried it 😅 📺: #CHIvsDET on CBS/Paramount+📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/tPb5KRWNCr — NFL (@NFL) November 28, 2024  It’s actually a really good play by Sewell not to force a throw into coverage like most non-QBs would do in that situation, and the fans still went crazy for the play call and for Sewell shrugging off the entire Bears defense to stay on his feet. The craziest part of the whole thing is that Sewell, by losing two yards, took a sack on the play, which means he has taken more sacks this season than he’s given up at right tackle. Sewell came into the game having allowed 0 sacks in more than 700 snaps, per PFF, which is an astonishing stat and a great example of why he’s a perennial All-Pro. Hopefully, this won’t be the last time we see Sewell given the chance to throw the ball cause I want to see him get a chance to let the ball fly."

	Come get these winners.","Thanksgiving is here and that means a virtual smorgasbord of football action. The weekend begins with a tripleheader on the big day itself, and the fun doesn’t stop until Monday. In this space, it’s been a tough season but, on the bright side, four of the last five weeks have ended in the green as we scratch and claw our way toward respectability. There is still a long way to go but, before we get to the Week 13 picks, let’s take stock of the progress. Come get these winners. I’m tired of fading the Lions. It hasn’t gone well, and I hate it. But this is another spot where I think I have to. Detroit is banged-up and, while the Lions should win this game at home, Chicago is a step above the doormats that should be catching double-digits in this spot. Thoughts and prayers. In the interest of full disclosure, I’m a Falcons fan. I don’t want to bet on the Falcons. I actively try not to. But this is a spot I really like. Atlanta is coming off a bye, while Los Angeles played a high-impact game on Monday on the west coast. I would already have the Falcons as a tiny favorite before accounting for the situation, so give me the candy on the home underdog.  This is Cincinnati’s last stand. At 4-7, they have zero margin for error. That’s not why I’m taking them, but the Bengals should be able to move the ball and score, even against Pittsburgh’s defense. The market is still a touch higher on the Steelers than I am, and grabbing this below a field goal is advantageous.  Make no mistake, Carolina isn’t very good, but they are undervalued at this number. Bryce Young looks like an NFL quarterback and, while the Panthers are going to give up some points here, they can go shot-for-shot with the Bucs at home. NFC South overs have crushed all season. I’m not getting off the train just yet and, as noted earlier, I think this might even be a spot when the Over is correlated to the underdog to some degree. Tampa Bay’s defense should pave the way for some fireworks."

	A pair of Buffaloes go off the board to start our latest mock draft, while four quarterbacks end up going in the first round.","We are at the end of college football’s regular season, which coincides with the unofficial start of the stretch run for the NFL season: Thanksgiving Day games. Right now, we have a pretty good idea of who the best teams are in the league, and can start to predict with a little bit of certainty what needs teams will have as the 2025 NFL Draft rolls around and which college football players could do a good job filling them. As such, it’s time for us to roll out the second version of our mock draft for next April — you can check out how things played out the last time we did this right here. As for how this one is going to go, well, how about a team trading up for Shedeur Sanders to get us started? (Draft order as of Nov. 27, 2024) If it’s not evident by the fact that they benched then cut Daniel Jones midseason and are currently starting Tommy DeVito when he’s healthy, the Giants really want a high pick and really need a quarterback, and a trade up to 1 to take Sanders makes sense if they can’t tank their way to the top pick. While he doesn’t have the strongest arm on earth, Sanders is an excellent processor of the game and can throw the ball accurately all over the place. He’s gotten better about getting the ball out and not hunting big plays that lead to sacks — Colorado’s OL taking a step forward helps, of course — and while the Giants don’t have nearly the level of playmakers that Colorado has relative to their level of competition, he’d love getting to throw to Malik Nabers. Add in that he has the sort of big personality that can handle New York and the Giants could theoretically hire his father if they fire Brian Daboll and Sanders checks a ton of boxes here. The Jaguars move down a spot, pick up some extra picks for their trouble, and get the best football player in this Draft — and in fact, if you were to look up “football player” in a dictionary, there should be a photo of Travis Hunter there. Hunter is doing things we’ve never really seen playing both ways at an elite level in college, and while it’s possible he eventually has to choose a primary position in the NFL – I could see him picking receiver or corner and then playing mostly high leverage snaps at the other – his versatility and ability at either spot would be a welcome addition or a Jags team that just needs more talent. Also, if his goal is to play both sides in the NFL, the Jags are a team that needs help at both spots, so they’d likely be thrilled to let him give it a go.  Ward’s rise from a QB at Incarnate Word to a Heisman contender for the College Football Playoff-bound Miami Hurricanes really has been impressive. He’s a dynamic thrower of the ball with good mobility and has gotten better and better over the course of his career. He’ll take some sacks and put the ball in danger a little more than I’d like, but that’s an area where he’s grown during his time with the Canes. The Raiders need a lot of help in a lot of different places, but above all else, their top priority this April should be getting a franchise quarterback they can build around. Ward would provide that. The Patriots need to bolster their offensive line to better protect Drake Maye. The rookie QB has impressed in flashes since taking over as the starter, but he’s under pressure far more often than New England would like. This isn’t the best tackle class in history, but Kelvin Banks Jr. has been terrific for the Longhorns and would be welcomed with open arms by Maye and the Pats. He’s just a junior but has 37 starts already under his belt at Texas and has excellent movement skills and strength.  It’s still unclear if Bryce Young is the long-term answer for the Panthers, but it has been impressive how he’s managed to respond to getting benched earlier this year — he hasn’t been an MVP candidate or anything, but it looks like getting a hard reset has led to the game slowing down a bit for him. No matter who the QB is, Carolina could use a No. 1 receiver to add to an interesting group of pass catchers, and Burden is that guy. He’s got everything you want outside of the fact he’s 5’11, as he’s a major big play threat who can line up just about anywhere and would give Young another really fun target to go alongside promising youngsters Xavier Legette and Ja’Tavion Sanders. The Titans could be in play for a new QB, but if Sanders and Ward are off the board, I think their focus needs to be in the trenches. Will Campbell is the other top tackle in this Draft and whether Tennessee rolls with Will Levis for one more year or addresses the QB situation in free agency, they’ll want to do a better job keeping them upright. Campbell figures to be capable of providing that help, and it’s time to build inside-out in Tennessee.  The Jets are in the middle of one of the most disappointing years we’ve ever seen out of an NFL team relative to preseason expectations, and they’re going to need throw the baby out with the bathwater as they move on from the Aaron Rodgers era, which means a big roster shakeup that should include Haason Reddick leaving as a free agent. There isn’t really a QB worth taking here, so New York should just go with the best player available, which we think means Carter. The linebacker-turned-edge rusher has seemingly gotten better every week for the Penn State defense, he’s going to destroy the Combine, and would bolster a good Jets defensive line that features building blocks in Quinnen Williams and Will McDonald. It’s can come off as lazy to compare Carter to Micah Parsons as another LB-turned-EDGE from Penn State who wears 11, but also, that’s a pretty good comp. The Browns would be in a really interesting spot at this spot in the Draft. Perhaps by April a third QB will emerge as a consensus top-10 guy, but based on the play on the field this year, I’m not willing to put any other QB up here. Whoever is under center in Cleveland next year is going to need some guys to throw to, as Amari Cooper is gone and the current receiving corps is far from loaded. Tet McMillan would immediately give them a big-bodied No. 1 that can help any quarterback that ends up taking snaps in Cleveland next year. Arizona may have fallen off as a team, but the 6’5 McMillan is a one-man wrecking crew on the outside that no one has been able to figure out. As long as they don’t go down the Nick Wright path with this pick, they should really target McMillan if they can’t get one of the QBs. Good things tend to happen when teams select guys who played in Georgia’s defense. The Saints need to figure out a direction after firing Dennis Allen midseason (it does seem like interim coach Darren Rizzi has a real shot at getting the job), but a big part of that direction is figuring out a succession plan for guys like Cameron Jordan and Demario Davis. Chase Young is a free agent after this year, too, so they have a big hole at EDGE, and Williams is a long and talented option to build the pass rush around going forward. His numbers haven’t been quite as imposing as you might expect, but the measurables, good tape, and Georgia pedigree all make him worth a top-10 pick. The Bengals can’t stop anyone this year, and as a result, they are completely wasting what should be an MVP season from Joe Burrow. If they’re picking 10th and the best corner is sitting on the board still available, they should sprint to the podium to get this pick in. Johnson has been a bit out of sight, out of mind while sitting out with an injury, but he’s a bad dude on the outside and Cincy desperately needs an upgrade in their secondary. I know the temptation will be to replace Tee Higgins (who is almost assuredly not going to be back) with a top-10 receiver, but this is a thin receiver class at the very top once Burden and McMillan are off the board and their bigger issues are on defense, anyway.  Dallas has to figure out a ton of stuff this offseason, and in my eyes, none are bigger than “how do we keep opposing offenses from moving the ball on us at will?” Sorting out Micah Parsons’ future is important, but so is bolstering the heart of their defensive line, which is just not good enough. Graham could fix that immediately, as he’s the rare gigantic defensive tackle (6’3, 315 pounds) who is disruptive on all three downs and would make it easier for a guy like Parsons to eat off the edge. You can go in a lot of directions here, but Graham is the perfect mix of best player available and fills a need for the Cowboys. The Bears have to upgrade their line this offseason in front of Caleb Williams. The interior of the line is really the biggest need, but they could use an upgrade at tackle, as well. Simmons suffered a season-ending knee injury against Oregon, but was in the mix as one of the top tackles coming into this year after the way he played as a junior in 2023. They addressed the skill positions last year, but this Draft should be all about the trenches (on both sides of the ball) for the Bears.  Don’t discount a tight end here, as the Colts do seem like they’re still all-in on Anthony Richardson and that’s the biggest skill position hole on their offense — both Colston Loveland and Tyler Warren would be outstanding fits in Indianapolis. But their defense is not great, and Scourton would give them a powerful EDGE who can play the run or the pass, and is big enough (6’4, 285 pounds) that he can line up at defensive tackle in some situations. He’s been a key piece on the Aggie defense this year, and would be a good fit on a Colts defensive line that prioritizes big, physical dudes. Miami might see both of their safeties leave this offseason, and just generally could use a talent upgrade in the middle of the field. Malaki Starks would provide that, as the Georgia safety is a special player with positional versatility at either safety spot and can play some nickel. Starks flies around at the back end of the Georgia secondary and would bring some needed juice to the Dolphins defense.  It’s unfortunate that Morrison is out for the year with a hip injury, because he is a fantastic player and would make a Notre Dame defense that might be the best in America even better. He has just about every tool in the toolkit that you want out of a star cornerback, as he’s comfortable manning up opposing receivers or dropping into a zone, and he’s very willing to do what he needs to do against the run. A starting outside corner is going to be high on the list of priorities for the Bucs this offseason, and they manage to get one here. The Rams would be slightly upset they can’t get Morrison, but then, they’d remember they can get Revel and would be over the moon. If he didn’t tear his ACL before the season, Revel would have a real shot at going in the top-10 this year because of his elite size, athleticism, and competitive nature. Los Angeles desperately needs to come out of the Draft this year with one of the three standout cornerbacks, and while they miss on Johnson and Morrison, Revel fills the need they have, and it won’t shock us if you see a number of comparisons between him and Eagles rookie standout Quinyon Mitchell. The Niners are going to be in a fascinating spot this offseason if things don’t turn around quickly. But whether they are making major changes to personnel or just trying to retool for one more run with this group, adding some talent on the offensive line would be a good idea. Upgrading their right tackle spot would make a ton of sense, and if Williams doesn’t stay another year at Texas (which is in play if he thinks that’d get him a top 5-10 pick next year), he’s a mountain of a man that would likely intrigue John Lynch and company in the Bay.  James Conner is a free agent, and the Cardinals have seen the value in having a physical, bruising rushing threat alongside Kyler Murray this season. Well, there’s no one better at that style of running than Ashton Jeanty, and while it’s always a little tricky to find the spot for a running back in the first round, he’s a no-doubt talent. The Cardinals would be thrilled to land him at this spot, and the likely Heisman finalist would be very fun to see alongside Murray in the desert.  At some point, the Falcons will be good at rushing the passer again. It really is stunning just how long it has been since they’ve had a player record double-digit sacks in a season (it hasn’t happened since 2016!), and it’s not going to happen this year barring a miracle, either. They don’t even really pressure quarterbacks. Enter Pearce, who has been a load off the edge for Tennessee over the last two seasons — as of this writing, he has 17 sacks in two years. He could use some polish, but he’d be as good of a bet as Atlanta’s made on a young pass rusher in quite some time. Seattle is gonna be looking for some help up the middle on defense at just about every level this offseason. If the board shakes out this way, Seattle would have to at least consider adding the big fella from Kentucky to bolster the interior of their defensive front, with Jarran Reed a potential free agent departure. Mike MacDonald is going to want to beef up his defense and what better way to do that than adding a 6’6, 344 pound wrecking ball up front, as Walker pops off the screen every time you watch Kentucky.  This is a bit of a luxury pick, but Washington has its face of the franchise under center in Jayden Daniels, and one of his favorite targets is soon-to-be free agent tight end Zach Ertz, who turns 35 this offseason. As such, we’ll give him Warren, who has been the best tight end in college football this year and a remarkably versatile piece for the Nittany Lion offense. He’ll play as a tight end, outside receiver, slot receiver, running back, quarterback, and snap the ball, all in the same game. An offense built around Daniels, Warren, and Terry McLaurin would be one of the most fun in the NFL, and if the Commanders want to challenge the Eagles in the NFC East, they’re going to need guys who will help them win shootouts. The Texans have two great edge rushers in Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson, but their interior line play has left something to be desired. Williams helps anchor the excellent defensive front for Ohio State, as very few teams find room to run in the middle against the Buckeyes this season. Putting the 327-pounder between Hunter and Anderson would help address some of Houston’s problems, and the Texans have shown in the past they want to invest heavily in their defensive line.  One of the biggest surprises in the NFL this year has been the Broncos, which look like they struck gold by picking Bo Nix last year. Their tight end room hasn’t given them much of anything this year — Adam Trautman has nine catches on 15 targets — but as we saw with Jimmy Graham in New Orleans, Sean Payton can do some really fun things with a big time player in that position. Loveland fits that bill. He’s a good blocker for a college tight end who hasn’t been able to show off his effectiveness in the passing game as much this year because of how bad the QB play has been in Ann Arbor. And with no receivers really worth taking here, Denver brings in the best skill position player on the board for their young QB. Wow, crazy, Jim Harbaugh takes one of his former Michigan players, what a shock. Truth be told, if Loveland is on the board, we think Harbaugh himself might sprint to the podium to say his name within 10 seconds of the Chargers getting on the clock, as he would fill a critical need for another pass catcher. Instead, they go with another Michigan Man™ who fills a need in Grant, who moves really well for his size (6’3, 339 pounds) and would know exactly what he needs to do in Jesse Minter’s defense from day one. He can slide right in at nose tackle and make life easier for everyone in the Chargers’ front seven. The Ravens defense has not been playing at the level folks in Baltimore are accustomed to, and that figures to be the focal point of their offseason. Walker would give the Ravens a really talented and versatile linebacker that they can use as an edge rusher and play off ball some when needed next to fellow Bulldog Roquan Smith. Walker has shown flashes this season, particularly in the Texas game where he had three sacks in a blowout win for the Dawgs, and Baltimore could find plenty of ways to use his talents.  A real wild card team at the end of the first round right now, the Steelers could be all over the place. One thing they’ll at least have to think about is a quarterback, as they don’t have a long-term answer right now. I’d expect Russell Wilson to be back on a short-term deal, but at this pick, they might consider taking the hyper-talented Milroe and letting him sit and learn some of the finer points of the passing game at the NFL level before throwing him out on the field. Milroe is an S-tier athlete, and the Steelers could get him some touches and action in running packages, where he’d be even more dynamic than Justin Fields is in those spots now.  In a division that features three opposing teams with a wealth of pass catching options, Green Bay could really stand to upgrade its cornerback room and put someone on the other side of Jaire Alexander, who has also missed some time this year due to injuries. Bolstering their pass rush wouldn’t be a bad idea, either, but Barron is a veteran, battle-tested member of the Longhorn secondary who plays all over the place and would brings some versatility and tenacity to Lambeau. Aaron Jones has been great for Minnesota on a 1-year rental, but they will likely be looking for a long-term answer at running back next year as they presumably prepare for JJ McCarthy to take over as their starting quarterback. Hampton doesn’t get a lot of discussion because UNC stinks, but he’s a crazy talented back and I think he’s going to be really good in the NFL. The Vikings love using running backs in the pass game, too, and Hampton has 34 catches for 295 yards this season. Beck has had a rollercoaster season in Athens, which has led to some reconsidering his position in this Draft. That said, I think by the time we get to April, he’ll be firmly back in the first round conversation thanks to some Pro Day buzz, and this might be too late to get him. If he is still on the board, someone that missed out early on the top two guys would have to look at trading back in to get him, and I think the Browns should seriously consider doing that. Philly is a willing trade-back team and there’s no one particularly exciting here to add for them. Cleveland desperately needs an answer at QB long-term after the disaster that has been Deshaun Watson. Beck had a really bad stretch of turnover-prone games and the decision-making has been questionable at times, but he also makes the kinds of throws that make scouts and coaches go wild. Perhaps the Browns would rather bottom out next year to chase on of the top QBs then — a top guy in the 2026 class if he stays in school another year, Penn State QB Drew Allar, is from northeast Ohio and a childhood Browns fan — but I think someone will look to jump back into the first round to secure Beck if he slides this far.  Receiver wouldn’t be a bad course of action for the Bills, but there really isn’t anyone who would step right in and raise the group’s ceiling, plus they can just re-sign Amari Cooper. Instead, let’s have them get a running mate at defensive tackle for Ed Oliver in Harmon, who has been really good for the Ducks this year after transferring in from Michigan State. He’s big, disruptive, plays the run well, and is among Oregon’s leaders in sacks and tackles for loss.  The name of the game in Kansas City is keeping Patrick Mahomes upright, and despite being only 11 games into the season, he’s been sacked 27 times — he’s never been sacked more than 28 times in his career, and he’s getting sacked on 6.62 percent of his dropbacks, a career-high. They have to protect him better, and targeting Ersery to replace Wanya Morris at LT would make a ton of sense. A three-year starter for PJ Fleck, Ersery is 6’6, 325 pounds, a good athlete for his size, and brings some bite as a run blocker, too. He impressed in his biggest test of the season (Abdul Carter had zero sacks when Minnesota played Penn State), and we wouldn’t be surprised if he’s off the board sooner than this, especially if he tests well in Indianapolis. The Lions will have a vanity pick, which is pretty wild to consider, and what says “Dan Campbell vanity pick” more than taking an interior offensive lineman. The tackle position is set for years in Detroit, but they could use some help bolstering their guard spot between them — it’s worth remembering that Graham Glasgow turns 33 this offseason, while Kevin Zeitler turns 35. I think the Lions would love to have a swing guy that can move around as needed on the line, and Jackson started the year as a guard for the Buckeyes but kicked out to left tackle when Josh Simmons got hurt and will presumably finish the year there."

	A very good 'Inside the NBA' riff revolved around one moment on Kendrick Lamar's new album and some curious decisions Drake's made recently.","Kendrick Lamar stunned everyone last week when he teased and then dropped his newest album, GNX. Two things happened very quickly: One, it began receiving widespread acclaim, and two, people started screaming “MUSTARD” as loud as they could immediately after they heard “TV Off” for the first time. Lamar screams it on the track as a way to shout out collaborator DJ Mustard, and because the internet just does this sometimes, it got turned into a meme. Because it was a thing people were making jokes about, it seemed a foregone conclusion that it would pop up on Inside the NBA sooner rather than later. And during halftime of Tuesday night’s NBA Cup game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Phoenix Suns, “TV Off” came over the speakers, which led to a very good riff from the fellas and special guest panelist Jalen Rose. Shaq decided to scream “MUSTAAAAAARD” a few times and crack a joke or two, while Rose slid in a spectacular line that we assume Drake won’t love. “I don’t know if y’all should be playing that Kendrick,” Rose told the desk. “You don’t wanna get a lawsuit up in here.” “Lawsuits don’t scare us around here,” Ernie Johnson quickly responded. Rose, of course, is referencing the multiple legal actions that Drake has threatened against Universal Music Group around the biggest song from his feud with Kendrick over the summer, “Not Like Us.” No lawsuits have been filed yet, but if this does turn into a full-blown legal fight between Drake and UMG, we are willing to be large sums of money that Inside is going to make a ton of jokes about it."

	While it is unclear if Jokic has picked a side in the Drake and Kendrick feud, at least he knows one of the songs from it.","Here’s the thing with Nikola Jokic: Despite being the best basketball player on the planet, he’s done a very good job of keeping his personal life and interests away from the court out of the public eye. All we really know about him is that the dude absolutely loves horses, to the point that he was pretty bummed when he learned that the Denver Nuggets’ championship parade in 2023 was going to keep him from getting back to his horses in Serbia as soon as possible. Well as it turns out, we now know a thing that Nikola Jokic apparently likes: the song “Not Like Us.” While warming up for Monday’s game between the Nuggets and the New York Knicks, Jokic rapped along to the song while Russell Westbrook had the time of his life on the bench, which you can view here. I would love to know Jokic’s complete thoughts on the feud between Kendrick Lamar and Drake, along with whether or not he knows all the words to “Euphoria,” “6:16 in LA,” and of course, “Meet the Grahams.” A lot of this is because, when we did this back in 2019, Jokic refused to answer because he claimed it was someone I’d have never heard of, so I am fascinated in learning more about his taste in music."
Sports – UPROXX,Charles Barkley Thinks The Lakers Are Doing An ‘Awful’ Job Handling Bronny’s Development,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/charles-barkley-lakers-bronny-james-development-g-league/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:27:33 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	Barkley thinks the Lakers are doing Bronny a disservice keeping him from playing road games with the G League.","The Los Angeles Lakers have gotten off to a solid start to the 2024-25 season, going 10-6 in their first 16 games with JJ Redick at the helm. Even with the actual play on the court going pretty well, the Lakers still manage to create a bit of controversy with the way they are handling the rookie season of second round pick Bronny James.  Bronny made his debut in the opener alongside LeBron, becoming the first father-son duo in league history to play together, and since then has made 6 NBA appearances — including in the Lakers visit to Cleveland, where Bronny was born. He’s also spent some time in the G League with the South Bay Lakers, playing two games so far with the Lakers affiliate. The reason Bronny has only made two appearances in the G League is the decision was made not have Bronny traveling and playing road games with South Bay. That, of course, limits the opportunities for James to get in game action, which is the point of having him in the G League, but travel for G League teams isn’t by charter and the decision was made just to keep him in L.A.  That move has led to plenty of conversation, with much of it focusing on whether the Lakers are stunting Bronny’s development with their plan. Charles Barkley certainly thinks so, explaining on a recent radio hit on “The Bettor Angle” why he thinks it’s not fair to Bronny or the South Bay Lakers (10:00 mark of the below video).  “They’ve handled it awful,” Barkley said. “Awful. … I thought it was great, a little ceremonial first game, but the kid’s not ready to play in the NBA. He should be in the G League so he can play basketball. He’s not going to get better sitting on the bench. But also this thing where he’s only gonna play home games, it’s wild? You mean stupid. It’s not fair to him. It’s not fair to the team. Can you imagine a coach of that — like, you come off a road trip and there’s a player you ain’t seen in a week or two, and then you feel like you gotta play him. I don’t think they’re doing Bronny any favors and they just handled this thing really bad. It’s a bad look for the Lakers. I actually think it’s a bad look — I really like everything LeBron’s done, but this is a bad look for him in my opinion.”  There’s no doubt that Bronny needs game reps and keeping him off of the road certainly limits his chances to get those. As for the bit about a guy being on and off the roster throughout the season, if there’s anywhere guys are going to be accustomed to dealing with that, it’s the G League where you regularly have players going up and down to and from NBA rosters — particularly with two-way deals being so prominent now. The reasoning from the Lakers (and James family) perspective is likely that flying commercial and going to G League arenas brings some considerable security questions that are not guaranteed to be met for someone with Bronny’s popularity. That said, it’s hard to argue with the criticism that James isn’t getting the maximum opportunity to develop from a basketball perspective."

	Four injured All-Stars are all expected to return to the court this week.","Injuries: They’re not fun! For the first month or so of the season, fans have lamented that some of the biggest stars in the league have missed time due to knocks they suffered this season. Fortunately, we haven’t seen too many long-term injuries that are set to cost guys extended periods of time, and this week, a handful of former All-Star selections who have spent time on the sidelines are slated to return to action. Arguably the biggest beneficiaries of this are the Phoenix Suns, which have spent the last seven games without Kevin Durant due to a calf strain and have looked awful with him sidelined. Over the last five games, Phoenix has also dealt with the absence of Bradley Beal due to his own calf strain. Fortunately for the Suns, both are expected to be back for Tuesday’s NBA Cup game against the Los Angeles Lakers, according to Shams Charania of ESPN. The Memphis Grizzlies, meanwhile, have seemingly been in a state of injury crisis for the last year, with Ja Morant getting caught up in that. After only appearing in nine games last year due to a suspension and a shoulder injury that he suffered in practice, Morant has only played in eight games this year due to a hip injury, but that is going to change on Monday night, according to Chris Haynes. Morant, who has not played since Nov. 6, is in line to return for the Grizzlies’ game against the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday night. In a good bit of news for the New Orleans Pelicans, Haynes also reported that their high-profile offseason acquisition, Dejounte Murray, is slated to return to action after suffering a hand fracture in the team’s season opener — although he won’t play in Monday’s game against the Toronto Raptors, Murray is expected to return on Wednesday against the Indiana Pacers. The team traded for Murray in a deal with the Atlanta Hawks, but he’s only been able to give them 30 minutes this year due to his injury, which is part of the reason why New Orleans is off to a Western Conference-worst 4-13 start to the year."

	Porzingis has not played this season after suffering a foot injury during the 2024 NBA Finals.","The Boston Celtics have been on a role to start this season, as the team is 14-3 at this early juncture, sits in second place in the Eastern Conference behind the scorching hot Cleveland Cavaliers (who Boston has already beaten this year), and looks to be in as good of a position to defend a championship as any team in recent memory. All of this has happened without the services of Kristaps Porzingis, who has not played this season after suffering a foot injury during the NBA Finals that required surgery. Fortunately for the Celtics, their time without Porzingis on the floor is about to come to an end. According to Shams Charania of ESPN, Boston is going to get Porzingis back during Monday night’s game against the Los Angeles Clippers. “Porzingis has been making rapid improvements in his recovery from foot surgery in late June, completing scrimmages in recent weeks of practices with the Celtics and their NBA G League affiliate, Maine,” Charania wrote. Porzingis joined the Celtics via a trade with the Washington Wizards last offseason and immediately became a perfect fit for how Joe Mazzulla wants to use his centers. His three point shooting and ability to protect the rim were invaluable when he was able to play, but a calf injury limited him to only seven games in the team’s run to a championship last year. Not long after his return in the NBA Finals, the Celtics announced that Porzingis suffered a torn medial retinaculum allowing dislocation of the posterior tibialis tendon in his left leg during Game 2, which the team deemed a “rare injury.” He was able to play 16 minutes in their Game 5 win that sealed a championship, but needed offseason surgery."

	The Cowboys led 20-9 with just over three minutes to play and ended up with a 34-26 win thanks to the dumbest finish to a game this year.","The Commanders and Cowboys played in. one of the funniest games in the NFL this season, as the two divisional rivals went back and forth with each team being on the wrong end of some massive blunders in what ended up a 34-26 Cowboys win.  The final three minutes was particularly insane, as it saw the game go from 20-9 Dallas to 34-26 with a truly outrageous sequence of events. The first was a touchdown from Jayden Daniels to Zach Ertz, with Daniels running in the two-point try to make it 20-17. On the ensuing kickoff, Kavontae Turpin let the ball bounce in front of him and had it roll past him for a near-disaster, before turning it into a touchdown return with a quick spin move and outrageous speed, making it 27-17.   A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  The Commanders would then kick a field goal with just under two minutes to play to make it 27-20. A failed onside kick figured to be about the end of things, but it was truly just the beginning. Washington’s defense got the three-and-out needed to give their offense a chance at a miracle, and Daniels delivered for the second time this season as Dallas’ defense melted down, allowing Terry McLaurin to catch the ball and evade everyone on his way for an 87-yard touchdown. However, Austin Seibert had already missed an extra point earlier in the game, so it was anything but a guarantee they would tie the game, and sure enough a bad snap led to a rushed operation and Seibert hooked another left of the uprights to keep it a 1-point game (videos below).   A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  On the ensuing onside kick, the Cowboys scooped it up and ran it back for a touchdown, which was the one thing that could keep the Commanders hopes alive, as they would get the ball back with time on the clock and a chance at another Hail Mary. Alas, this time Daniels’ efforts at a miracle ended up being caught by Dallas and the game finally ended with a Cowboys win that became far more difficult than it ever needed to be."

The frustrations of that loss were evident late in the fourth quarter when Fred VanVleet got ejected after getting into it with the officials, telling them all that they suck, but then took things a step further after getting run by walking directly to the official that tossed him, pointing in his face, and telling him “you’re a b*tch.”  pic.twitter.com/wtHPtHgSMc — Diamond Scar (@diamondscar22) November 24, 2024  From the TV angle, it wasn’t clear if VanVleet made contact with the official’s face, which was of concern to the Rockets broadcast crew as that would’ve been an auto-suspension. However, a side angle showed that he did not make contact, but did still point his finger right in the ref’s face in a moment that wasn’t exactly his finest. This will definitely lead to VanVleet paying a hefty fine to the league office, and we’ll have to wait and see if, even without actually poking the ref, this crossed enough of a line to earn him a night off without pay. VanVleet is averaging 14.9 points and 6.2 assists per game this season for Houston."

	The Warriors tend to have very good seasons when Kendrick Lamar puts out an album.","Kendrick Lamar stunned everyone on Friday afternoon. There had been hopes for months that a new album was on the way following his high-profile feud with Drake, and it looked like we were going to get another sign that something big was on the horizon when he released the music video for “GNX.” And then, Kendrick took things a step further by just releasing his sixth studio album, which is also titled “GNX.” Because it is an album that Kendrick Lamar released out of nowhere, people went from being stunned to praising the project. And it’s possible that no one ends up being happier about this than the Golden State Warriors. Why, you may ask? Well, as it turns out, good things tend to happen to the Warriors — which entered Friday night’s game against the New Orleans Pelicans with an 11-3 record, good for first place in the Western Conference — when Kendrick puts out an album. Each of the last four times that has happened, the team has gone on to win an NBA championship, with To Pimp a Butterfly coming out in March 2015, Damn. getting released in April 2017, and Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers dropping in April 2022. There was also the soundtrack to Black Panther, which came out in February 2018 and featured songs that were either performed or curated by Kendrick. As for his other two studio albums, Section.80 and good kid, m.A.A.d city, the former came out a few weeks after they drafted Klay Thompson, and the latter was released in Oct. 2012, one week before the start of the 2012-13 NBA season, which marked the first time that Golden State made it to the postseason with Steph Curry on the team. Now, the overwhelming likelihood is that this is a bunch of insane coincidences, but if the Warriors do end up winning a championship, we’re going to think something weird is going on … and Kendrick will probably be a little bummed, as he’s a well-documented fan of the Los Angeles Lakers, which are currently the 4-seed in the West and find themselves 1.5 games back of Golden State."

	Jones, the No. 6 overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, was benched by the Giants earlier this week.","The New York Giants made the decision to bench starting quarterback Daniel Jones earlier this week amid a brutal year where the offense has struggled to find any sort of consistent rhythm. Now, in a shocking turn of events, the team announced on Friday afternoon that the sixth overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft asked for and was granted his immediate release. In a statement, which you can read in its entirely below, Giants president John Mara praised Jones for his handling of his benching, and made clear that parting ways was a mutual decision. Daniel came to see me this morning and asked if we would release him. We mutually agreed that would be the best for him and for the team.  Daniel has been a great representative of our organization, first class in every way. His handling of this situation yesterday exemplifies just that. We are all disappointed in how things have worked out.  We hold Daniel in high regard and have a great appreciation for him. We wish him nothing but the best in the future. Jones has had a tumultuous tenure in New York, as the decision to draft him that high was largely based on his perceived upside. While he’s certainly flashed the ability to be an accurate passer and a threat with his legs — so much so that the team gave him a $160 million extension in 2023 that was cited as a reason why they could not bring back Saquon Barkley in free agency this offseason — he’s never been able to become the face of the franchise the team envisioned. The Giants sit at 2-8 on the season, and are playing host to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday afternoon. The team has already announced that Tommy DeVito will start under center. To add some intrigue to this, the Giants face the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving this year. Dallas has had its own QB struggles this season as Dak Prescott is out for the year with the injury, and if they wanted, it would make sense to bring in Jones and try to get him up to speed ahead of Thursday."

While neither of them are expected to compete for a championship or anything, both are built around promising young players and hope that better days are on the horizon. One of the brightest young stars in Thursday’s game was Brandon Miller, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft who flashed as a rookie and has built on that in a big way during his second year in the league. Unfortunately for the Pistons, that meant finding out that Miller is a freak of nature, as evidenced by him making one of the best defensive plays you will ever see when he single-handedly blew up an attempted alley-oop by picking a Wendell Moore lob out of mid-air.  A post shared by NBA (@nba)  If Miller became horizontal during this, it’d look an awful lot like Odell Beckham Jr.’s famous one-handed catch from when he played for the Giants. Anyway, the Hornets won in overtime, 123-121, with Miller leading the way, as the former Alabama standout went for 38 points, seven rebounds, four assists, four steals, and a block in 42 minutes of work."

	Gobert got a 3-second call as he pouted over not getting the ball late in a tie game, and Anthony Edwards was not happy.","The Minnesota Timberwolves were one of the best teams and stories of the 2023-24 season, as Anthony Edwards made the leap into superstardom, Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert figured out how to play off of each other around him, and they made a run to the Western Conference Finals.  The vibes in Minnesota were, as they say, immaculate, but then a week before training camp they traded Towns to New York for Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo in a trade that has seen both the Knicks and Wolves struggling to build chemistry early in the season. Both teams are still hovering around .500, but the Knicks can get away with that in the East and still have a good look at a top-4 seed. In the West things are very different, as the Wolves came into Thursday’s game in Toronto with a tenuous hold on sixth at 8-6, needing a win to avoid dropping to a tie for 10th early this season.  In theory, the 3-12 Raptors should’ve been a good spot to get a win for the Wolves, but Minnesota found themselves in a dogfight with Toronto (on their incredible alternate court) late in the fourth quarter. With the game tied at 95-95 and five minutes to play, the Wolves chemistry issues became apparent when Randle waved off Gobert who had deep post position under the hoop, and the 4-time DPOY responded by walking to the other side of the lane to get a 3-second violation.   A post shared by LeagueAlerts Inc. (@leaguealerts)  While Gobert’s frustration is understandable, as he had two feet in the restricted area with a seal on a smaller defender and didn’t get the ball, you also can’t purposefully get a turnover in a tie game in the fourth quarter. That was what Anthony Edwards was thinking, as he got on Gobert as they came down the floor, letting him know that’s not an acceptable reaction to not getting the ball. That turnover proved to be important as the Wolves saw the Raptors pull away late for a 110-105 win, dropping Minnesota to 8-7 and a tie for 10th in the West with Dallas and Sacramento."

	To celebrate Hubie Brown calling it a career, we looked back on how old he was during major events that happened in his lifetime.","Basketball fans are going to see broadcasts get a little worse sooner rather than later. That’s because Hubie Brown, the legendary former coach who has turned into a stalwart on ESPN’s coverage of the league, will only call one more game before he retires at 91 years old. “We are going to give Hubie one last shot on a game,” ESPN president Burke Magnus told Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated. “He deserves that. We think the world of him. I think it is absolutely remarkable the level in which he still calls games at age 90-plus. I don’t mean to be purposely mysterious here but we are going to honor Hubie during the regular season at some point to be determined and send him off in style.” That he is still capable of working at 91 is remarkable, but Brown is still sharp as a tack and as good as it gets calling basketball games, and while no one has deserved retirement more, it’s always a tough day when someone as highly-regarded as him calls it a career. There is, still, no one better at seeing something, pointing it out, and explaining why it’s a big deal than Brown, and he has terrific chemistry with his broadcast partners. We’re all going to miss Hubie, and to celebrate the end of his time in the booth, we wanted to celebrate him by having some fun and looking at everything he’s seen over his extraordinary life. You see, Hubie was born on Sept. 25, 1933, which means he has been around for, quite literally, every single game that the NBA has played — the league was founded in June of 1946, when he was 12 years old. That got us wondering: How old was he during some of the biggest moments in world, American, and NBA history over the last century or so? Let’s dive in. Start of WWII: 5 years old (Sept. 1, 1939)
End of WWII: 11 years old (Sept. 2, 1945)
The first NBA game: 13 years old (Nov. 1, 1946)
Jackie Robinson breaks baseball’s color barrier: 13 years old (April 15, 1947)
The first NBA Draft: 16 years old (April 25, 1950) Bill Russell plays in his first NBA game: 23 years old (Dec. 22, 1956)
Wilt Chamberlain plays in his first NBA game: 26 years old (Oct. 24, 1959)
John F. Kennedy Assassination: 30 years old (Nov. 22, 1963)
Super Bowl I: 34 years old (Jan. 15, 1967)
First moon landing: 36 years old (July 20, 1969) End of the Vietnam War: 41 years old (April 30, 1975)
Hubie Brown’s first game as an NBA head coach with the Atlanta Hawks: 42 years old (Oct. 21, 1976)
The first time Larry Bird and Magic Johnson played in the NBA Finals: 51 years old (May 27, 1984)
First NBA Draft Lottery: 52 years old (May 12, 1985)
End of the Cold War: 56 years old (Dec. 3, 1989)
Michael Jordan retires for the first time: 60 years old (Oct. 26, 1993) 9/11: 67 years old (Sept. 11, 2001)

	ESPN content president Burke Magnus explained that the network's biggest star ending up on its newest property is a bit tricky.","ESPN has about a year to figure out how it’s going to handle Inside the NBA. As part of Warner Bros. Discovery’s deal to remain in the NBA’s media ecosystem, it was announced that Turner will continue to produce Inside, but license it out to ESPN, which solves the network’s longstanding issues trying to put together a pregame, halftime, and postgame NBA show that viewers enjoy. An unsurprising question that popped up after this was whether Stephen A. Smith — who is in the middle of some high-profile contract negotiations with ESPN — would find a way onto the show. Smith is the guy ESPN has built its NBA coverage around, and while that has come under plenty of criticism, he’s famously close with the Inside crew and has appeared on it in the past. But apparently, as of now, the network doesn’t have any intetion of putting Stephen A. on their newest property. “We have no plans to do that,” ESPN content president Burke Magnus told Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated. “And that’s because, frankly, the construct of the deal really doesn’t — that’s not how it was conceived. What is conceived is that Turner, as they have always done with this show, with this cast, with the people involved behind the scenes, are going to continue to do what they’ve always done. And we’re going to distribute it on the ESPN platform. Frankly, that’s exactly what we want. We don’t want to change it. We don’t want to interject new talent into it. We don’t want to really do anything to it.” It is worth mentioning that the scuttlebutt around Smith’s contract negotiations revolves around him wanting to do more NFL stuff for ESPN, but considering how big Inside is and his relationship with the guys, it is fair to wonder if he’d want to have any sort of presence on the show as part of a new deal (if, of course, he comes to terms with the network on one). For now, the complexities of the deal with Turner gives ESPN a way to say they have no plans of putting him on Inside in any capacity, but we’ll certainly be waiting to see if that changes as Smith and ESPN sit down at the negotiating table.

	Come get these winners.","In many circles, Week 11 has been described as the best slate of games so far when it comes to the 2024 NFL season, and it is hard to argue. There was entertaining action in every window other than Monday night and, on a week-to-week basis, that is not always the case. In this space, we also found success with a third winning week in the last four. Granted, it came with a hilarious investment in a team that lost by approximately 100, but a loss counts the same by a half-point or 30 points, right? Before we get to the Week 12 schedule and five picks against the spread, let’s take a look at the (unfortunately negative) season-long progress. Come get these winners. We struck with our principles last Thursday to success, and we’re doing it again here. It is unsightly to bet on Cleveland right now, and I won’t argue that. The Browns are 2-8 and having a season from hell. With that said, the market is too high on the Steelers in this spot. Pittsburgh continues to be unreal in an underdog role under Mike Tomlin, but the Steelers are 33-41-3 (44.6%) as a road favorite under his watch. Do I think the games from 2008 impact this week? I do not, but I can’t get this to more than a field goal on a short week in Cleveland. Let’s go Browns. This is a space that prides itself on taking the stands that few others will take. This is another example. The Lions are dominating everyone. We found that out the hard way last week. But this is really a 7.5-point number on the road? Detroit’s ATS record (8-2) is stellar but things have gone too far. Or maybe we’ll lose this bet and swear off fading the Lions for a while. Either way, I like the home dog here. Our Wong teaser of the week is here. Tennessee’s defense has been spunky this season, but the Titans still have Will Levis and a rudderless offense that gives us hope in the Texans at home with the move through key numbers. On the other side, I’ve actually been a touch low on the 49ers compared to the market this season and, while that has been the right stance on the whole, this is a principle play to take it up to 8.5. Remember when the 12th Man meant something? Well, the Seahawks are 2-4 at home this season, and the word is out on that. While I am not suggesting that home-field advantage is the reason for this play, I like Seattle to keep it going after a strong performance in an upset over San Francisco a week ago. Arizona is off a bye and on a four-game winning streak but, no matter what I do, I can’t get this to a pick’em, much less than +1 available at BetMGM right now. I don’t give out many road favorites, but I tend to make exceptions for when the Chargers are the home team. Granted, a lot has changed in Los Angeles, with Jim Harbaugh immediately turning the Chargers into a very competent and effective outfit. However, the Chargers still might have the least significant home-field advantage in the NFL, and Baltimore is at least slightly undervalued here coming off a loss to Pittsburgh."

	Charles Barkley wasn't gonna let the night go by without making a joke about their upcoming move to ESPN next fall.","Over the weekend, some exciting news broke regarding the future of Inside the NBA, as ESPN is adding the beloved studio show as part of a new licensing agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery. The show will continue to be produced independently by TNT Sports from their Atlanta studio, with Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, Shaquille O’Neal, and Charles Barkley remaining employees of WBD — well, so long as they get Shaq’s contract done — but they’ll be part of ESPN and ABC’s coverage of the Playoffs, Finals, and major regular season games. That was stunning news to many fans, largely because ESPN has been trying to figure out how to create a competitor to Inside for decades to no avail, and the fellas have never been afraid of making fun of ESPN — particularly Barkley. Chuck has taken ESPN and their analysts to tasks a number of times over the years, and while I doubt that stops in total, he knows times are changing soon for he and the rest of the fellas. On Tuesday night, after the Spurs beat the Thunder in the late game on TNT, Chuck couldn’t help but crack a joke to Kenny Smith that they’ve gotta “go back to kissing ass” ahead of their move to ESPN next fall.  No one has been more outspoken over the last six months about the contract negotiations with the NBA than Barkley, sometimes to the chagrin of his colleagues. He’s been extremely vocal about his frustrations with TNT not keeping NBA rights and has noted his biggest concern is trying to figure out how to keep everyone at TNT employed. That mission seems to have been accomplished with this latest news of the show being licensed to ESPN, and he showed still going to be Chuck and poke fun at the new arrangement."

	Another case of Vince Staples, being Vince Staples.","Vince Staples isn’t afraid to voice his opinion regarding anything and anyone. No one is exempt from the “Little Homies” rapper’s blunt takes—not fellow musicians, fans, or content creators. Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum is the latest person to feel his humorous wrath. Today (November 19), Vince Staples and Jayson Tatum came face-to-face in a new commercial for the Jordan brand (viewable here). Instead of using his beloved lyricism on full display, Vince channelled his words for another reason. As highlights of Tatum’s Championship season took over the screen, Vince gave Tatum a piece of his mind. “What type of dude is Jayson Tatum,” asked Vince. “The type of dude who’d crush a team and then say some cold sh*t like, ‘We just played our game and the rest took care of itself.'” As Vince pointed out, Tatum is a many of few words but when he does speak out against his opponents it cuts deeps. However, Tatum manages to keep a cool head or so Vince argued, saying: “The type that have a whole city and internet, booing him. And he’s just smiling.” Before the clip ends, Vince has one more grievance to air as a long-suffering Los Angeles Clippers fan. “That sh*t really message me up, man,” he said.  Unfazed by it all, Tatum laughs off Vince’s monologue. In Tatum’s eyes, it doesn’t matter who hates him because his partner, singer Ella Mai and their child provides more than enough love to make up for it."

	After a loss dropped the Sixers to 2-11 on the year, the team held a players-only meeting where Maxey voiced a gripe about Embiid.","The Philadelphia 76ers have been the biggest disappointment in the NBA to start the 2024-25 season. While there have been injuries to Joel Embiid, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey that have prevented them from taking the court as a trio, Philadelphia has gotten off to a 2-11 start this year, which is tied with the openly tanking Washington Wizards for the worst record in the NBA. For a team that entered this season with championship aspirations, it’s pretty shocking to see just how bad Philly has been. And following a 106-89 loss to the Miami Heat on Monday night where the team blew a 19-point lead, Kyle Lowry called for a players-only meeting, according to Shams Charania of ESPN. And per Charania, the meeting included Maxey confronting Embiid with a message that the former NBA MVP “accepted.” Via ESPN: In the meeting, Maxey challenged Embiid to be on time to team activities, calling out the former league MVP about being late “for everything” and how it impacts the locker room, from other players to the coaching staff, sources briefed on the meeting told ESPN. Maxey and Embiid have a close friendship and have a history of holding each other accountable, according to those around the team. Embiid was listed as doubtful to play against the Heat with an illness, but eventually took the floor and struggled, going for 11 points, eight rebounds, and five assists in 31 minutes of work on 5-for-11 shooting from the field. Maxey, meanwhile, was unable to play, as he’s working his way back from a hamstring strain he suffered earlier this season. Charania also noted that Sixers players addressed head coach Nick Nurse, saying that “they want to be coached harder, and coaches in turn said they want players to practice with purpose and attention to detail.”"

	Powerhouse Hobbs has a list of aspirations after spending seven months out with a knee injury.","Powerhouse Hobbs wasn’t sure how fans were going to receive his return. Recency bias is a real thing in the wrestling industry, and any extended absence comes with the reality that you’re out of sight and out of mind.  When he walked out of the tunnel to the roar of the live audience as Ricochet’s surprise partner just two weeks ago, any anxiety over what the reaction would look like evaporated. For Hobbs, it was like he’d never left.  “It was one of those things where it let me know how special this business is, how special the fans are,” Hobbs tells Uproxx Sports. “When it comes down to it, we do it for them. We do it for their entertainment. We do it for their reactions. We do it because we love it. We all love to go out and perform in front of them. But then when they go ahead and give you that love back, man, it makes you want to go even harder.” As smooth as he looked in his return to the ring, the prior seven months were anything but easy.  He ruptured his patella tendon in a main event match, going from the high of being prominently featured on television on Wednesday night to having surgery the following Monday. The next day, he flew across the country, and just a week later was back in the gym determined to return stronger.  “I probably had a few days to be in my feelings and soak everything in,” Hobbs says. “But my main objective was to come back better than when I left. This recovery, I would get up at five, eat, in the gym by six on one leg for two hours, come home, eat, then off to PT for three hours a day, Monday through Saturday.” There were moments Hobbs says he felt helpless. He couldn’t bend his knee at all. He remembers the emotions of asking his three-year-old daughter to help take his sock off, asking his son to help him stand, or making sure he had something to hold onto so he didn’t fall in the shower.  The experience, Hobbs says, humbled him. Small accomplishments compounded. A strong support system that included conversations with wrestling legends like Sting, Mark Henry, and Billy Gunn helped him prepare for the ups, downs, and evolving mindset in how he’d navigate his return.  In his time away, Hobbs focused on the things he could control and put extra effort on how he could elevate other areas of his game.  “I got a lot of promos just sitting on the couch watching wrestling. I was very angry, not being able to do what I want to do,” Hobbs says.  Practicing patience is something Hobbs has had to learn over his four years in AEW, and especially now in what’s essentially a fresh start. You can’t manufacture many of the special moments in wrestling — they’re going to happen organically, like the infamous Meat chants last year. “You’re going to hear the people tell you what they want,” Hobbs says, “so it’s on you to capitalize on it.” Hearing the crowd react to his return, and feeding off their energy over the past few weeks, should give him confidence that he’ll be able to be successful in his career refresh. He created a list of aspirations during his time away, including another singles championship reign.  There’s no order to how he goes about checking off his accomplishments, but admits the primary focus is a “longer, stronger reign.” His path to wearing championship gold again comes with confidence, believing in himself, and turning the volume up on his character.  Before his injury, Hobbs says there were discussions about how he could start bringing who he is in real life to his character. Now that he’s had time to sit and stew on the future, he’s ready to show the world who he is.  “I’m going to start bringing my life into my character, the things that I hate, the things that I love. I’m just gonna show everyone how much more intense I can be, how destructive I can be, how I don’t give a shit at times who’s in my way,” Hobbs says. “In the end, this business, there only can be one. It’s going to come to a point where I’m going to show everybody that it’s all about me. They’re either going to be with me or be against me. It doesn’t matter. They boo me, I’m just going to start tearing everything up in front of them.  “And I think that’s what wrestling is missing a little bit. That one guy who makes people afraid, but they want to see him kick someone’s ass. I feel that it’s time to bring it out.”"

	Jake Paul's boxing fit in his match against Mike Tyson was one of the most expensive in boxing history. Here is what he wore.","Over the weekend, social media sensation turned legit boxer Jake Paul faced off against the mighty (if aged) Mike Tyson, attracting the eyes of 60 million viewers for what was undoubtedly the fight of the year. The two fighters, aged 27 and 58 respectively, lasted the entire eight rounds, with Paul ultimately besting Iron Mike, crushing the hearts of pretty much everybody over the age of 30. But we’re not here to talk about the fight, we’re here to talk about Jake Paul’s fit, which Paul revealed on the “Talk Tuah” podcast was worth over $1 million. “This outfit that I’ve made for the fight is the most expensive fight outfit in the history of boxing,” said Paul. The fit was a custom piece designed by Dominic Ciambrone’s Surgeon Studios and featured metallic silver shorts with diamond tennis chains, and a graphic of Mr. Monopoly holding a money bag. The full outfit was completed with a jewel-encrusted gray jacket prominently featuring the logo of Paul’s new body care line W. It’s flashy, brash, and eye-catching, a perfect reflection of Paul’s whole vibe. Love him or hate him, you can’t deny that this fight helped to solidify Paul’s status as a pop culture icon of the 2020s, and despite Tyson’s advanced age, being able to go toe to toe with the GOAT and come out on top is no easy feat. This is also a big win for Ciambrone, who we’ve been keeping a close eye on since the days he was simply referred to as the Shoe Surgeon. Check out the fit in action below."

	Tyrese Haliburton took over the NBA Cup last year. Which young, up-and-coming player is most likely to do that this year?","Tyrese Haliburton entered last season in an interesting spot. Yes, everyone knew he was a really good, really talented basketball player — he even made it onto the 2023 All-Star team. And yet, Haliburton was mostly a guy who did some cool things on a not great Indiana Pacers team, which came on the heels of him doing some cool things as a rookie and a second-year player on a not great Sacramento Kings team. And then, last season happened. More specifically, the inaugural NBA Cup (known at the time as the In-Season Tournament) happened, and Haliburton was the driving force behind an upstart Pacers team that took it to everyone and made the championship game, where they fell to the Los Angeles Lakers. It was the exact sort of springboard to stardom that a cup competition should provide, as a young, up-and-coming team led by a young, up-and-coming star went on a run and nearly won the whole thing. Haliburton averaged 26.7 points, 13.3 assists, and 4.9 rebounds in seven tournament games, and while he cooled off a bit as the year went on due to lingering injury issues, he was still able to use his NBA Cup performance as a springboard to an All-NBA Third Team nod and an appearance in the Eastern Conference Finals. Now, with this season’s NBA Cup underway, it’s worth wondering which young star is going to use this edition of the tournament as a way to assert themselves as a superstar, and today, we wanted to look at some of the frontrunners to do just that on teams that have already gotten off to good starts in Cup play. The Rockets have been one of the best up-and-coming teams in the league so far this season, and while you can toss a few guys in as their answer (Jalen Green would be a good fit here, too), we’ll go with Sengun, who was great last year but was sidelined with an injury during their big run later in the calendar. Anyone who watches Houston knows that Sengun is good, but ever since they traded James Harden, the Rockets haven’t gotten a ton of attention. The NBA Cup is a chance to change that — they steamrolled the Clippers in their Group A opener last week — and if they can win their game in Minnesota next week, they’re going to be the overwhelming favorites to move out of their group. Add in that Houston has a net rating of +12.98 when Sengun is on the floor this season and while depth is one of their biggest strengths, we’re willing to bet that he’s the guy who will carry them to Cup wins if they come. Atlanta beating the Celtics in their NBA Cup opener was a shock, and they followed it up with a win over Washington in their second game. The craziest thing about the game against Boston: Trae Young didn’t play, as Daniels was a two-way menace (28 points, seven assists, six steals) and Johnson stuffed the stat sheet (18 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists, three steals, a block). Young is, obviously, the face in Atlanta, but on the heels of the Dejounte Murray trade, there’s space for someone to blossom into his star running mate. Daniels’ ability to just ruin opposing backcourts and Johnson’s ability to do anything Atlanta needs on a given night both fit well alongside him, and they’ll both have to be great if the Hawks go on a run. Things have been completely dire in Detroit for a while now, and as a result, Cunningham hasn’t lived up to his billing as a No. 1 overall pick. But things are starting to change — Detroit is 2-0 in Cup play, with Cunningham going for 21 points, nine assists, seven rebounds, and two blocks against the Heat before putting up a 21-point, 10-rebounds, 10-assist triple-double with five steals and a block against the Wizards. He has to cut down on his turnovers, but he’s spearheading the Pistons as they try to take a big step forward under JB Bickerstaff. So far, so good, and if Detroit goes on an improbable NBA Cup run, it’ll be because Cunningham took a big leap towards becoming the face of the franchise the Pistons have craved for years. The most likely option to go on a Haliburton-esque run. Orlando is 2-0 with wins over Charlotte and Philly, even though Paolo Banchero is out with a torn oblique. The ball has been in Wagner’s hands a lot as a result, and the decision has paid off in a big way. He’s starting to find his shot after he couldn’t hit anything last season, while he looks really comfortable as a scorer and a facilitator. The Magic being good without Banchero is only possible because of Wagner, and a trip to the knockout rounds of the NBA Cup is within reach — their game in New York on Dec. 3 looms large, and we cannot wait to see what Wagner does under the bright lights of Madison Square Garden. You might have heard this by now: The Cavs are the best team in basketball this year at 15-0, and they won their only NBA Cup game so far against Charlotte. All eyes are on Tuesday night’s trip to Boston to take on the defending champs, which is the exact sort of high-profile stage Cleveland could use to emphatically say they’re championship and NBA Cup contenders. A big reason for the success? Mobley, as the decision to bring Kenny Atkinson on board as head coach has led to him looking more comfortable on offense and his usual brilliant self on defense. He has to continue to do that if the Cavs are going to be championship contenders, and the NBA Cup is a great place for him to show that he’s taken a step forward in his fourth season. If you want, you can also make a case for Darius Garland here, who has been nothing short of spectacular this season and is showing why he’s one of the best young guards in the league. However, Garland has been an All-Star and Donovan Mitchell is a known commodity, so we’ll go with the young big man as the Cav most likely to turn heads.  The Thunder are in a tricky spot due to the injuries suffered by Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein, so it’s possible they are just not big enough to go on an NBA Cup run. If they can, though, our hunch is it’s because of Williams stepping up and being the perfect running mate alongside Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. He keeps getting better and better the more experience he gets under his belt, and so far this season, Williams has done that again, as he’s putting up career-best marks in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks per game. He won’t unseat Shai as the man in Oklahoma City any time soon, but the Thunder are the exact sort of team that can use the NBA Cup as a chance to announce their arrival to the rest of the league. Williams can do the same."

We pick up the HBCU Homecoming series with only a day left before Director of Bands Chancellor Mills gets to prove himself in his first year in the position with the help of more than 100 band members and his staff. “It’s all in the planning, first and foremost,” Mills said in preparation for the event. “We don’t want to throw anything together and just put it out there; it’s huge this year.” As Mills said, the planning is critical, as the pressure of the occasion couldn’t be any higher, with current students and alumni all expecting a great show. “This performance is just going to signify where this program is,” said Mills. “It’s going to dictate how we’re going to move for the next 3-5 years. It’s significant in terms of what we want to give back to our community.” Fortunately, the hard work pays off as the band comes out at halftime to give the crowd their best with renditions of hip-hop classics produced by Just Blaze, including Joe Budden’s “Pump it Up” and “What We Do” by Freeway, who appeared to perform the song in-person. “I’ve had my songs played at a million sporting events,” Blaze said of the performance. “This is just kind of a great add-on to that part of the legacy. It sounded amazing.” As Blaze says in the episode, the party was far from over after the performance. Check out additional footage from the band’s night performance and more to see how the performance was received."

	Apparently, Shaq is a little upset with things, although he would like to remain on the show.","Basketball fans got some pretty monumental news over the weekend. As part of the agreement that will keep Warner Bros. Discovery as one of the league’s broadcast partners during its upcoming media right deal, Turner Sports will continue to produce “Inside the NBA” but license the show out to ESPN, which will air it going forward. The deal officially got announced on Monday, and there are some pretty big questions that continue to hang over the agreement that ESPN and Turner will have to get sorted out between now and the start of the 2025-26 season. As it turns out, there’s one especially big one that hangs over the deal, as Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated reported that Shaquille O’Neal is out of a contract on July 1, 2025. And apparently, there’s a bit of tension on the Hall of Fame inductee’s side of things right now. While sources say Shaq wants to remain on the show, he’s frustrated that there has been congratulations and press releases hyping that Inside the NBA is remaining the same while he is currently not under contract to be with the company next season. As Traina noted, Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, and Charles Barkley all do other things for Turner, so their deals are different from Shaq’s, who exclusively does NBA work for the network. It goes without saying, but Inside without Shaq would not feel the same, although we’re optimistic that Draymond Green joining the show whenever his playing career ends would be a good fill-in for him. Still, whether it’s agreeing to another deal with Turner or working something out with ESPN, here’s hoping that Shaq is at the desk with the rest of the guys when Inside airs on the Worldwide Leader for the first time."

	There's no word on whether the league will have a high-profile halftime show for its other Christmas game.","The NFL has started to have a larger and larger presence on Christmas Day over the years. This season, the league will put a pair of marquee games on Dec. 25, as the Kansas City Chiefs will travel to Pittsburgh to Take on the Steelers in the 1 p.m window, while the Houston Texans will play host to the Baltimore Ravens at 4:30 p.m. ET. Late on Sunday night, the NFL decided to announce that it has something special up its sleeve for the late afternoon game, as it was revealed that Beyonce will perform at halftime in her hometown.  A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce)  There’s no word on whether the league has a similarly huge name lined up for the early game, but lining up Beyonce — who headlined the Super Bowl halftime show back in 2013 — for a performance during a showcase game like this makes a ton of sense. Of course, there is a potential problem that will be monitored throughout the Christmas Day schedule, as the games will be aired on Netflix, which just struggled mightily with its broadcast of the boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul. Adding Beyonce to what will already be a highly-anticipated NFL game should only bring more eyeballs onto the platform, and there’s going to be a whole lot of interest in whether or not Netflix will be able to keep up with the demand."

The ping-pong balls fell in favor of the Wings, who will get the opportunity to select Bueckers first overall next spring and figure to create one of the WNBA’s most exciting backcourts immediately with Bueckers joining established Wings star Arike Ogunbowale in Dallas. For the second straight year, the Sparks will hold the No. 2 overall pick and the Sky will pick at No. 3, while the Mystics will have the fourth pick. The fifth pick will go to the expansion Golden State Valkyries, followed by the playoff teams from a year ago — aside from the Aces, who forfeited their draft pick as part of a league punishment.  The 2025 WNBA Draft first round order looks as follows:  1. Dallas Wings

5. Golden State Valkyries
6. Washington Mystics (via the Atlanta Dream)

10. Chicago Sky (via the Connecticut Sun)
11. Minnesota Lynx
12. Phoenix Mercury (via the New York Liberty)  Behind Bueckers, Kiki Iriafen is the presumptive No. 2 prospect in this class, which means she could be making a very short trip from playing college ball at USC this season to pro ball with the Sparks.

	Jon Jones successfully defended his UFC Heavyweight championship at UFC 309 in New York.","Jon Jones (28-1) knocked out Stipe Miocic (20-5) in the third round to retain the heavyweight championship at UFC 309 from Madison Square Garden in New York.  Jones opened with a couple shots up top, a leg kick, and eventually a takedown. On top, Jones worked the ground and pound, refusing to give Miocic any room on the ground in a dominant first round — but while it looked like Jones could have ended it early, Miocic was able to hang on. Miocic opened the second round with a more measured approach, waiting for his own opportunities to attack without being taken down. The former heavyweight champion was relatively flat-footed before opening a more active approach in the third, but as Miocic moved, it was Jones who picked apart Miocic.  Jones hurt Miocic with a big right hand midway through the round, but kept the champ at bay with a combination of his own. Jones hurt Miocic with a spinning back kick to the body, then finished him off with lefts and rights on the ground before the referee stoppage.  Jones’ return to the UFC on Saturday was just his second bout in the heavyweight division. He hadn’t fought since last year, claiming the UFC Heavyweight belt in his debut in the heavyweight division against Ciryl Gane. Jones is arguably the greatest fighter in UFC history, but his background is riddled in controversy amid two victories over another greatest of all-time contender, Daniel Cormier. Miocic hadn’t fought since 2021, when he suffered a second-round knockout at the hands of Francis Ngannou.  Jones as the winner has an interesting path forward. On one hand, the interim champ, Tom Aspinall, is waiting in the wings and ready to prove himself against an all-time great. On the other hand, Alex Pereira seems prepped to climb to the heavyweight division, making possibly two weight jumps in three year as the former middleweight and current light heavyweight champion. Jones hasn’t seemed as interested in Aspinall recently, but opened the door to that fight after the win.  After his loss, Miocic retired from the UFC."

	Chuck, Shaq, Kenny, and Ernie will continue covering NBA games in 2025, as ESPN will license the show from TNT starting next year.","When TNT Sports lost the rights to the NBA this summer, with the league opting for a three-network deal with ESPN, NBC, and Amazon, the biggest question from fans was what would the future look like for ‘Inside the NBA’. After initially sounding as though it would end after this season, TNT was able to get Charles Barkley to agree to stick around for the remainder of his contract, with plans to continue the show in some capacity.  Now, we know what that will be, and instead of TNT airing the fellas talking about various sports (as was rumored at one point), they will continue to cover the NBA as part of ESPN’s NBA coverage in a unique licensing deal between Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery. According to the Wall Street Journal and Andrew Marchand of The Athletic, the deal will see TNT Sports continue producing the show, but it will air on ESPN.  Separately, Warner Bros. Discovery struck a deal with Disney to license the TNT show “Inside the NBA” to ESPN and ABC starting next season, according to the people familiar with the matter. The show, which features the former players Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal, has an enthusiastic and large following. The show will air throughout the course of the season. This all happens alongside a larger settlement between the NBA and WBD, with Bleacher Report and House of Highlights maintaining rights to NBA videos. That is all excellent news for those at TNT Sports and those outlets, and sources inside TNT Sports tell Dime that they are “considering it a best case scenario” after losing NBA game broadcasts. [UPDATE: This post previously stated WBD would continue operating NBA TV and the league’s digital platforms, as was reported by the WSJ, but that was incorrect. NBA Digital and WBD will continue their current relationship but will not be operated by WBD (as is the current structure), while NBA TV will not be operated by WBD in the future.] For NBA fans the biggest news is that Charles Barkley, Shaquille O’Neal, Kenny Smith, and Ernie Johnson will still be on our televisions — one would assume from Studio J in Atlanta still if TNT is producing it — each week during the NBA season. One would expect they’ll move from their Thursday slot to Wednesday for ESPN’s biggest night of games — as the other options are Friday and Sunday and I have a hard time imagining them moving to either of those. The move allows the best show to continue without any changes to talent in front of or behind the camera, which is particularly important, and one would think if ESPN is adding the show they will understand what makes it so good and give it the kind of space and time it deserves, rather than what they currently do with their studio offering. It remains to be seen what happens with NBA Countdown, as they’ll still need to have something for those Friday and Sunday games, but may shake up their main crew with the Inside fellas becoming their A-crew and Finals team."

	The NBA has big plans for how it wants to build on 2024's shooting competition between Steph Curry and Sabrina Ionescu.","The NBA struck gold at All-Star weekend in 2024. While the game itself was bad enough that the league is considering a major shake-up in its format and the Dunk Contest was a dud, a shooting contest between Steph Curry and Sabrina Ionescu injected a whole lot of excitement into the festivities on Saturday night — Curry was able to win, but it was awfully close. With the 2025 edition of the All-Star Game taking place in the Chase Center, it would make a ton of sense for the league to run back a Steph vs. Sabrina shootout. According to Shams Charania of ESPN, that is, indeed in the works, but there’s a catch: They may not be the only NBA and WNBA players involved. Curry and WNBA star Sabrina Ionescu of the New York Liberty participated in the first NBA versus WNBA 3-point challenge at All-Star Saturday night this February in Indianapolis. Curry and Ionescu are in strong conversations to return in a variation of the shootout, which could include other NBA and WNBA players such as Klay Thompson of the Dallas Mavericks and Caitlin Clark of the Indiana Fever, sources said. Expanding on the competition and including Thompson and Clark always made far too much sense, so it’s good to see that the NBA might do something that would obviously be a huge draw."

	The NBA is considering a shakeup to make the All-Star Game a 4-team tournament like Rising Stars -- and include the Rising Stars winners.","The last really good NBA All-Star Game was in 2020, which was both the first year of the Elam Ending format and just a few weeks after Kobe Bryant’s tragic death. Players took the game more seriously than we’ve seen in quite some time, as it was a league-wide celebration of the Lakers legend, but since then the game has fallen back into old habits of being a glorified pickup run with barely a hint of defense being played.  That has led to fans tuning out and TV networks being upset, and Adam Silver seemed like a broken man after last year’s game was the highest scoring in history, handing Giannis and the East the All-Star Game trophy with the glowing praise of “you scored the most points. Well, congratulations.” The truth is, the All-Star Game just isn’t important enough for players to go all-out, especially with how much money is at stake for them nowadays. It’s no longer the biggest national stage some of them will get to show out and build their profile, and the result is a bunch of guys trying not to get hurt while producing a few highlights.  For that reason, the league needs to get creative. We offered our thoughts on what that should look like last year, as they’ve bounced back-and-forth between formats and how they pick teams to varying degrees of success. This year we might see a significant change to the format, as ESPN’s Shams Charania brought word that the league is in deep discussions on a new format that would be similar what they did with the Rising Stars Game, breaking the All-Star rosters into 4 teams and having them play a semifinal game and then the winners of those playing in the final. The teams would be 3 teams of 8 All-Stars and the winning team of the Rising Stars Challenge from Friday. Charania highlights how discussions around this format started at Summer League and have included league personnel, team executives, players (including Stephen Curry), and coaches, with significant momentum towards being adopted for the 2025 game in San Francisco. At the very least, you could bet that whatever team of All-Stars got matched up with the Rising Stars winners would likely have a little more juice to not lose, which would yield the intended results of raising the level of competition.  I think anything would be an improvement over a regular four-quarter game, and the Rising Stars games have been improved as a result of this format change. Even if they aren’t suddenly the greatest basketball games in history, they move quicker and when it’s close late the competitive juices get flowing in a way we don’t see often in the current All-Star format."
Sports – UPROXX,It Is Silly That Nikola Jokic Has Somehow Gotten Better To Start The 2024-25 Season,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/nikola-jokic-start-2024-25-nba-season-denver-nuggets/,"Fri, 15 Nov 2024 21:41:00 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	Nikola Jokic entered this season as an all-time great already. Somehow, someway, he keeps getting better.","There’s this fun thing I like to do sometimes that I affectionately call the Barry Bonds game. How it works: You go onto baseball-reference, pull up the page for the legendary San Francisco Giants slugger, and just look at how ridiculous it was that Bonds was able to put up the numbers he did during his prime. Yes, steroids, I know, but even with that caveat, individual players are not supposed to break their sport the way that Barry Bonds was able to break the game of baseball. We’re not fully there yet, but going onto Nikola Jokic‘s basketball-reference page is getting to a similarly very silly point. Ever since becoming the no-doubt cornerstone of the Denver Nuggets back in 2018-19, Jokic has consistently put up some of the wildest numbers in the league. His last four years feature three MVPs and a second-place finish while averaging 26.1 points, 12.2 rebounds, 8.7 assists, and 1.4 steals in 34.1 minutes per game while shooting 58.8 percent from the field and 36.4 percent from three. The advanced stats especially love him — scroll on down to the “Advanced” section, a lot of stuff is bold (led the league) and a few things are gold (all-time career marks). There is no one quite like Jokic, and there has never been anyone quite like Jokic. His career True Shooting percentage is third in league history, behind only Rudy Gobert and DeAndre Jordan, while attempting 1,942 more three-pointers than those two combined. His career total rebound percentage is 15th, right in between ABA legend Mel Daniels and Marcus Camby. He’s 25th all time in assist percentage — the three names directly behind him are Ja Morant, Ricky Rubio, and LeBron James. The dude just has his fingerprints all over games in a way that no one has ever consistently matched. I say all of that to say this: Somehow, someway, on a team that needs him more than ever (which says a lot as the entire franchise is built around having him), Jokic has raised his game through the first stretch of the 2024-25 season. This should not be possible. It’s not even like he’s suddenly adding something new to his bag of tricks, he’s just better than ever at being Nikola Jokic. Small sample size caveats are prominent here, but here’s some stuff to consider: Points per game: 29.7 (fifth in the NBA, his current career-high is 27.1 PPG)
Rebounds per game: 13.7 (leads the NBA, current career-high is 13.8 RPG)
Assists per game: 11.7 (leads the NBA, current career-high is 9.8 APG)
Steals per game: 1.7 (t-9th in the NBA, current career-high is 1.7 SPG) The only players to ever average a triple-double over a full season, of course, are Oscar Robertson (once) and Russell Westbrook (four times). Neither of them, in any of their triple-double seasons, were in the same galaxy as Jokic’s current True Shooting percentage of 66.7 percent — both guys, funny enough, posted a TS% of 55.4 percent in their most efficient season with a triple-double. And all of the advanced stats that tend to show that Jokic is a marvel (PER, win shares per 48 minutes, box plus/minus) are outrageous — if the season ended today, he’d post the highest single-season PER (33.31) of all-time, the highest BPM (15.02) of all-time, and the fourth-highest WS/48 of all-time behind some guys named Kareem and Wilt. So, yeah, Jokic is a joke, the single best basketball player in the world today and the guy spearheading a Nuggets team with some flaws that came as the result of a talent drain over the last few years to an early 7-3 record and, as of this writing, the longest-active winning streak (five games) in the Western Conference. And here’s the funny thing: If Denver did not have Jokic playing like this, they would be in some serious trouble. Have a look at how dire things get when he is not on the floor, via PBP Stats: There is a reason why, when asked what the ideal number of minutes is for Jokic to be on the floor for the Nuggets, Michael Malone said “48.” We’ve seen plenty of teams over the years be totally helpless when the sun around which everything revolves goes to the bench — LeBron’s teams in his prime were famously horrendous when he would sit, the Sixers have an organizational commitment to being awful without Joel Embiid, etc. — but seeing as how Jokic is either scoring or assisting on nearly half of all the points that Denver scores, well, it’s pretty important that he never comes off the floor. That’ll have to change at some point (well, probably), but Jokic playing like this means it’s easier for the Nuggets to slowly bring along their young guys who have to take on bigger roles this season — although it must be said that Christian Braun has impressed as the de facto Kentavious Caldwell-Pope replacement. They can also afford to be patient with Jamal Murray, who still hasn’t quite looked like himself on the heels of a pretty nasty run of injuries that made his postseason and Olympic efforts hard to watch at times, but just got paid in a big way and absolutely has to get on track. Of course, at some point, Denver is going to need to totally round into form, even if there are some really encouraging signs beyond Jokic. Aaron Gordon has been awesome so far this year when healthy, while Michael Porter Jr. continues to just do his thing as a huge dude who can shoot the hell out of the basketball. When 75 percent of the core your team is built around is playing at a high level from the start of the year — and that final member of your core has a reputation for saving his best for when the lights get brighter — you’re usually in a pretty good spot. There are still big picture questions that can only be answered when the playoffs roll around, which is the curse of being a team with title-or-bust aspirations. In the meantime, all anyone can really do is sit back, watch, and marvel at the spectacle that is Nikola Jokic, the best player in the world at the very height of his powers, someone who keeps finding ways to break the game of basketball, and an all-time great who stands shoulder-to-shoulder alongside the greatest players to ever set foot on the hardwood. And the scary part? As the early portion of this season has shown, if anything, he’s only getting better."

	'We’re nothing. We’re just dead. We’re dust.'","Tonight, November 15, is the much-publicized boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul. Ahead of the fight, which will stream on Netflix, Iron Mike was asked by internet-famous teen reporter Jazlyn Guerra, a.k.a. Jazzy’s World TV, for his thoughts on legacy. He took it very seriously.   “Well, I don’t know. I don’t believe in the word ‘legacy,'” Tyson replied. “I just think that’s another word for ego. Legacy doesn’t mean nothing. That’s just some word everybody grabbed onto. Someone said that word, and everyone grabbed on the words, and now it’s used every five seconds. It means absolutely nothing to me. I’m just passing through. I’mma die, and it’s gonna be over. Who cares about legacy after that?”  Tyson somehow wasn’t done. “What a big ego,” he continued. “So I’mma die. I want people to think that I’m this, I’m great. I’m, no. We’re nothing. We’re just dead. We’re dust. We’re absolutely nothing. Our legacy is nothing.” Guerra responded to Tyson’s stream-of-consciousness existentialism with a polite “thank you so much for sharing that,” but 50 Cent had another takeaway. “G*ddam it! Mike ya scaring the kids, WTF chill,” the rapper wrote on X. “Note to self, keep the kids away from Mike.”  You can watch the video here. Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson streams on Netflix beginning at 8 p.m. ET."
Sports – UPROXX,Ranking The 2024-25 NBA City Edition Uniforms From Worst To Best,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/nba-city-edition-uniforms-ranked-2024-25/,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 18:01:22 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	This year's NBA City Edition unis were officially unveiled on Thursday, so we're ranking them from 30 to 1.","The NBA and Nike officially unveiled the 2024-25 City Edition uniforms for all 30 teams on Thursday, and while the designs have been leaked since this summer, I like to wait until we get the official images to rank them. That is because the actual jerseys themselves almost always look better than their 2D mock-ups, which is certainly the case with this year’s crop. The leaks got roasted to no end on social media and while I’m not crazy about this year’s group of uniforms, they aren’t as bad in actuality as the leaks looked.  That said, there are some heaters and some really bad ones, along with a big crop this year of very “meh” looks as it’s fair to wonder if Nike and the teams are running a bit short on ideas — good news guys, at least another 12 years of these! Here we are ranking the uniforms from worst to best, where there’s one that should become part of one team’s permanent look.  NBA
Creating good alternates is hard when you have an iconic jersey set, and that’s the problem the Celtics (and Lakers) run into every year. These are just bad and don’t even seem to be trying to do anything interesting. Wear your normal (and great) uniforms, please.  NBA
Same goes for the Lakers. These are just unbecoming of a once proud franchise.  NBA
I’m honestly kind of stunned they went back to the Heat Culture well again after the reaction to when they did this last year, but it does look a little better on the all red uniform. Still, c’mon guys, stop trying to make this a thing. NBA
On the opposite end of the spectrum from Boston and L.A. is OKC, which has had one uniform in its history that I thought was legitimately good (the 2018 City Edition honoring Oklahoma’s Native American heritage). Everything else has been either “meh” or outright bad. I’ll say this, these aren’t the worst unis they’ve ever had, but I just am not a fan.  NBA
The Pacers have done this look before in black, and it’s just not for me.  NBA
A retro look that just doesn’t really land for me. I will say, I bet the court they have for this color scheme will look great, but I’m just not a big fan of the lettering.  NBA
I wouldn’t call these bad, they just don’t land for me, but that’s also been the case for a number of the Brooklyn City Editions over the years.  NBA
I’m just out on the 5280 thing. I like the mountains on the side and the topographical map thing, and while I think there are better executions, leaning into the rainbow coloring is generally good for Denver. However, I just can’t get on board with the 5280 in place of lettering. NBA
All of the uniforms in this tier have the same issue of not being bad, but also not being particularly inspiring. Dallas’ are particularly plain, which, again, not necessarily bad, but not memorable either.  NBA
I get they’re going for the Chicago musical font here, but it feels like they weren’t willing to go all-in on it and the end result is pretty bland.  NBA
I get what Minnesota’s going for, but I just see an old Windows 98 screensaver in that design.  NBA
They aren’t as bad as the Lakers and Celtics, but they also have a similar problem where their normal uniforms are iconic classics and trying something new often just makes you want them to do what they always do.  NBA
The Magic are at the top of this group by virtue of having the best lettering/logo — the Magic with a star for the A is always great — but Orlando has great uniform looks and this one just falls flat comparatively.  NBA
Like Orlando, Charlotte has some great throwback looks and this just makes me wish they were wearing one of those instead.  NBA
My colleague Mark said the logo looks like it should be for store brand paper towels and I can’t unsee it. I do like that shade of blue though.  NBA
Perfectly fine, even though it’s still a little confusing when the Bucks are wearing all-blue.  NBA
Never seen a more Oklahoma State jersey in my life. Go Pokes.  NBA
I actually kinda like these, but they are giving off strong vibes of made up Houston jerseys for a movie that couldn’t afford NBA licensing.  NBA
If I were to guess, these will be among the most polarizing unis. I dig New Orleans leaning into being a little different and weird, and the herringbone pattern with actual bones certainly does that. They will likely be at the bottom of some folks rankings but I don’t think their standard unis are so good that they can’t get weird and have it work.  NBA
These have grown on me a bit, in part because they at least look like Warriors uniforms — unlike their Michigan/Marquette alternates from a year or two ago. They aren’t the best uniforms in the world, but a solid attempt at playing off something unique to the Bay (the Golden Gate Bridge).  NBA
I really like the District font and this year they put it on a nice color instead of whatever the hell the black and green and orange thing was a year ago. The Wizards won’t be good this year, but I do think they’ll look good in these.  NBA
I like this Spurs font, they’ve done it before but it works for me. I also like this shade of blue. These aren’t as good as their fiesta look in the past, but a solid choice and I just like when the Spurs have a little pop of color.  NBA
I like these, even though I will not immediately spot this color and go “Cavs” in my brain. Part of why these will work is their court that goes with them is phenomenal.  NBA
Another one that gets a big boost from an unbelievably good court design. These play off the old 1995 All-Star logo, and while I’m not crazy about the font, I still dig them. If they incorporated the saguaro cactus into them, they’d be higher.  NBA
The Blazers almost always do a good job with the City edition uni, and this year is another good addition to their rotation. A big part of that is their “Rip City” font just looks good on anything. NBA
The Jazz are finally making the move back to the purple mountains with their full-time uniform set, and this year’s City Edition is a very good version of that.  NBA
The throwback to the Memphis Sounds just looks fantastic. I love that Memphis font and these are going to look fantastic on the floor — even if it’ll take a little adjustment to seeing a team in red and thinking “Grizzlies”.  NBA
The Kings also have another really good throwback look, taking it to the days of the Cincinnati Royals. The royal blue and red just pops, and they didn’t try to do too much with a uniform that doesn’t need much more.  NBA
I’m a sucker for this spectrum Sixers look. I just think it’s so clean and the white edition is even better than the navy look from a couple years back.  NBA
The Vince Carter Raptor doing his legendary between-the-legs dunk is so good and the Raptors need to just make it their permanent logo. These with the purple retro look they brought back this year is a damn-near perfect uniform set and it’s a shame they will move on to something new next season."
Sports – UPROXX,We’re Picking Winners For Week 11 Of The 2024 NFL Season,https://uproxx.com/sports/nfl-picks-winners-week-11-spread-best-bets/,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:03:27 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	Come get these winners.","Sometimes, you simply want to unplug the season and plug it back in. That is where we are when it comes to NFL handicapping in 2024. After a pair of encouraging weeks, the ugliness returned in Week 10, including a Falcons-Saints game that impossibly stayed under with three missed field goals and other malodies. We won’t be deterred from the goal of righting the ship but, hey, you could also fade these picks if you’re feeling spicy. Before delivering this week’s five-pack, let’s take a look at the carnage in 2024.  Come get these winners. A Thursday night Under? Let’s get back to basics. Washington has been an “over” team to the tune of 7-3 this season, but Philadelphia has been quietly stout on defense in recent weeks. This is, of course, a short week for both teams, and Washington has some injury issues along its offensive line. I tend to think the Commanders defense is a touch undervalued in this spot as well, and this is a favorable price. The Saints got the bounce last week after firing their coach and, with the help of one of the worst kicking performances of the season for Atlanta, New Orleans won a game it shouldn’t have won. That could benefit us this week, as the Browns are underdogs in a spot where they probably shouldn’t be. Let’s ride the Jameis roller coaster and hope it goes well. Detroit is a wagon. They seemingly cover every week and, when they don’t like in Week 10, they somehow win the game despite a million turnovers. With that said, getting a full 14 here on Jacksonville is something I can’t pass on. Trust me, I know how ugly it is. Seattle is healthier and coming off a bye, including the projected return of DK Metcalf. I’ve also been a touch low on San Francisco all season, and I simply can’t get this to 6.5 points, even with McCaffrey back for the 49ers. This teaser happens to involve a pair of prime time games, but I would like it even if it didn’t. Candidly, I love each leg here, with the Bengals more than able to get in the backdoor if things go south at the outset. Houston is on the road, which does scare me a bit, but the situation in Dallas is rather dire, and the Texans may be discounted a bit after a maddening loss to Detroit."

	Giannis got called for a foul despite getting all ball. But fortunately for the Bucks, as Rasheed Wallace once said, ball don't lie.","The Milwaukee Bucks played host to the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night, and while there is still a ton of basketball left to be played this season, you won’t find a more insane final 90 or so seconds of regulation than what we got out of these two Central Division opponents. The two teams traded the lead back and forth, and after a Marcus Sasser three tied things up with just under 30 seconds left, Milwaukee got the ball and had a chance to win. A wide open look by Taurean Prince did not fall, and with a hair over a second left on the clock, Detroit called a timeout, advanced the ball, and tried to replicate the magic it found on a sideline out of bounds play on Tuesday night against Miami. It looked like that was going to happen, as Cade Cunningham lobbed one up to Ron Holland near the rim, but Giannis Antetokounmpo was able to break things up … well, at least it looked like he did, but the referees called a foul that stood after a review even though it really did not look like Giannis fouled Holland at all. However, in the words of the great philosopher Rasheed Wallace, ball don’t lie. Holland stepped up to the charity stripe and missed short twice, which ended up sending the game to overtime. It would’ve been an awfully harsh way for the game to end for Milwaukee, but, again, Sheed’s got us covered here."
Sports – UPROXX,Draymond Green Claims Steph Had Extra Juice For Warriors-Mavs Because Klay ‘Ghosted Him’,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/draymond-green-klay-thompson-ghosted-steph-curry-warriors-mavs/,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 23:16:08 +0000","<div class=""upx-component upx-embed-url""><div class=""embed-holder""></div></div>Steph Curry apparently had a little extra motivation for Klay Thompson's return to the Chase Center.","Klay Thompson made his return to the Chase Center on Tuesday night as a member of the Dallas Mavericks. It went the way that things tend to go when teams travel to take on the Golden State Warriors: Steph Curry did some absolutely ludicrous Steph stuff, and the Warriors went on to pick up a 120-117 win to start their NBA Cup campaign. Curry scored all 12 of the Warriors’ points during a 12-3 run to close out the game, and plenty of people noted that he looked especially fired up after hitting a three with 27 seconds left that essentially iced things. It turns out there’s a reason why: According to Draymond Green, Curry was ghosted by Thompson in the lead-up to the game. “I’m stirring the pot, I pissed Steph off,” Green said on his podcast, which you can watch at the 4:30 mark of the video at the top of this post. “He’s like, ‘Yeah, I talked to Klay last night about’ — cause he was supposed to speak before the game. He was like, ‘Yeah I called Raymond and told him I’m not speaking. I just need to lock in on the game, so I ain’t speaking and I talked to Klay about it.’ He tried to check in with Klay about something else, and Klay ghosted him, so he got pissed. And here we go. Locked in.” Steve Kerr said that Curry was supposed to address the crowd before the game, but he and Thompson decided against it, while Green did drop a hint after the game that Thompson isn’t an easy guy to get a hold of when he told the press “You ever try to keep in touch with Klay? It’s very one-sided. The love is there. The relationship is there.”"

	The legendary Spurs coach has been away from the team since Nov. 2.","The San Antonio Spurs have been without the services of legendary head coach Gregg Popovich since the start of November. While the team previously said that Popovich’s absence was due to an illness, on Wednesday afternoon, the Spurs revealed that Popovich suffered what was described as a “mild stroke” ahead of their game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Nov. 2, 2024. “The San Antonio Spurs today announced that Head Coach Gregg Popovich has suffered a mild stroke,” the team said in a statement. “The episode occurred on Nov. 2 at the Frost Bank Center. Popovich, who has already started a rehabilitation program, is expected to make a full recovery. At this point, a timeline for his return to the sidelines has not been determined. During this time, the organization is grateful to the extended community for providing privacy and space to the Popovich family.” Assistant coach Mitch Johnson, who has been part of the Spurs’ famed coaching system since 2016, has filled in for Popovich as he’s been away from the team for the last six games. When asked last week for an update on Popovich, Johnson said that the Hall of Fame coach was “in good spirits,” even though there was no word on when fans could expect to see Popovich back on the sideline. One of the greatest basketball coaches of all time, the 75-year-old Popovich has been at the helm of the Spurs since 1996. He is a 5-time NBA champion, a 3-time Coach of the Year, and is the NBA’s all-time wins leader among coaches."

	Let's be honest, Charles Barkley and Shaq were always going to do this at some point.","It’s been a rough start to the year for the Toronto Raptors. While they were never expected to compete for a championship this year, injuries to a number of key contributors like Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickly have played a big role in the team going 2-10, which is the worst record in the league at this early juncture. A bright spot has been the play of Gradey Dick, the No. 13 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft who is shooting 37.3 percent from three and his upped his scoring to 20.1 points per game. He’s a good player whose last name has led to stuff like this happening, and shockingly, it was not until Tuesday night that the Inside the NBA guys had their inevitable meltdown over him.   A post shared by Dime (@dimemagazine)  “This boy’s ballin right here, y’all,” Charles Barkley told the crew. “I think you pointed that out, Gradey Dick,” Ernie Johnson responded. “I can’t say his name,” Barkley shot back. “I just can’t say his name. I’m not gonna say his name, I don’t give a damn what y’all say around here.” It was right around this point that we got one of the consistently funniest things on Inside: Shaq laughing so hard at something insane that Chuck said that he sounds like he’s furiously trying to clear his throat. Anyway, the fellas kept going down this road for a bit longer, because there was never going to be any stopping this riff once it finally happened. As for how the rest of Dick’s night went, he scored a career-best 32 points with five rebounds and three assists in a 99-85 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks."

	There was some extra juice in the building for Klay Thompson's return to the Bay, and Steph reminded the fans whose house it was late.","The biggest game of the night in a packed slate of NBA Cup games was the Mavs taking on the Warriors in Klay Thompson’s first game back in San Francisco since leaving as a free agent this summer for Dallas.  It was an emotional scene as they played a terrific tribute video and had the crowd in captains hats to honor their former star, but once the game got going there was plenty of juice on both sides in a reunion that wasn’t all happy. The two teams went back and forth, as the stars on both sides all played their roles, with Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving combining for 52 for the Mavs, while Thompson hit 6 threes on his way to 22 points in his return, including a big one late that gave Dallas a five-point lead midway through the fourth quarter.  That lead would get up to seven before Stephen Curry took over for the Warriors, scoring 12 points in the final 3:10 of game time, including a personal 10-0 run (aided by some spectacular defense from Draymond Green) that turned a Golden State deficit into a 4-point Warriors lead. His final bucket of that run was a vintage stepback three-pointer over Dereck Lively II, as he hit the Mavs big man with his signature “night night” celebration, before making a demonstrative declaration to the crowd that “this is my sh*t.”  STEPH CURRY HAS THE LAST 10 WARRIORS POINTS. 10-2 run to put GSW up 4 with under 30 seconds. 🏆 DAL-GSW | West Group C action🏀 #EmiratesNBACup on TNT pic.twitter.com/xNxak7xWr5 — NBA (@NBA) November 13, 2024  The Mavs would hit a three to cut the lead to one, but a pair of Curry free throws and a missed Luka three saw the Warriors win in regulation, 120-117. Curry finished with 37 points in the win, and while it’s clear there’s not actual bad blood between either side in the Splash Bros. breakup, there did seem to be a little extra fire from Curry for a mid-November game to make a statement at home with Klay now on the other side. While the “night night” is nothing new, the jersey popping and yelling “this is my sh*t” was more than we ever see from Curry in a non-playoff environment, and while I am a fan of the NBA Cup and think it brings out more competition in these games, I think this had more to do with who was on the other side than the Cup ramifications of this game."

	Shaq, who is never shy about being brutally honest when modern big men come up, did not mince words about Joel Embiid.","Joel Embiid took the floor for the Philadelphia 76ers for the first time this season on Tuesday night. Embiid, who has spent the start of the year ramping up to play after some knee problems, looked like someone who needs to work off a ton of rust, as he went for 13 points on 2-for-11 shooting with five assists and three rebounds in a 111-99 loss to the New York Knicks. It’s probably safe to assume that Embiid will be fine as long as he can manage whatever is up with his knee, while the Sixers — which find themselves 2-8 at this early juncture — have to get him, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey all healthy and clicking as soon as possible. But even if that happens, Shaquille O’Neal is not optimistic about Philly’s ability to win a ring with Embiid at the center of things, which he expressed at halftime on TNT. “In New York, it’s a tough team to play,” O’Neal said. “But this was the fear I had for Joel Embiid. You announce arrogantly, I’m not playing back-to-backs, Ernie. I’m not injured but I’m sore. I’ll come back when I want to come back. Now, when you say things like that, you’re supposed to come back with extra energy. 0-for-3? I would have been 0-15. But you know what y’all would have said. ‘Hey, Shaq’s not playing well, but he’s playing aggressive.’ The plan that they are having, it’s not working. And not only that, I say this respectfully, Joel Embiid will never win a championship until he gets his mind and his attitude right.” Shaq has essentially staked out a place in the basketball punditry world as the guy who will call out big men when he feels they aren’t living up to what they’re capable of, and clearly, he thinks Embiid is the kind of guy who can lead Philadelphia to a championship. In fairness to Embiid, while he did say he may not play in back-to-backs going forward in an effort to be healthy when the playoffs roll around, he said after the loss to the Knicks that he wants to play in Wednesday’s game against the Cleveland Cavaliers, even if the decision is out of his hands."

In the East Group B, the Detroit Pistons played host to the Miami Heat and looked like they were going to cruise to a win before Miami got hot down the stretch of regulation. With things tied up, the two teams went into overtime, where Miami was able to take a lead with just under two seconds left before things got very, very weird. First, the Pistons drew up a beautiful sideline out of bounds play to get a dunk for Jalen Duren that tied things up. And then, a furious Erik Spoelstra walked onto the court and called a timeout. There was just one problem: Miami didn’t have one, which meant we had a classic Chris Webber situation on our hands — perhaps it was fate that one of Webber’s Fab 5 teammates, Jalen Rose, was in attendance and lost his mind. Malik Bealey stepped up to the free throw line, buried it to put Detroit ahead, then on the ensuing Pistons possession, got fouled one more time with 0.1 seconds left to seal the game. It was, quite frankly, stunning to watch Spoelstra make such a big mistake, but at the very least, we got a really entertaining end to a game that suddenly has some stakes to it because of the NBA Cup."

	Caitlin Clark found a very unique pitfall of fame at The Eras Tour: Getting so many friendship bracelets you start to lose circulation.","Taylor Swift’s “The Eras Tour” has been the biggest show in the world for the past few years, as the tour has had millions of fans pass through the gates at stadiums around the globe. After finishing her international leg of the tour, Swift added another run of U.S. tour dates, which included recently playing three nights in Indianapolis at the start of November.  In attendance for those shows was the biggest sports star in the city at present, as Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark wasn’t about to miss a chance to see her favorite artist play shows in her new home city. The only problem for Caitlin at the Eras Tour was that she’s too popular in Indianapolis, which meant she was being constantly given friendship bracelets from other Swifties. That’s a very nice problem to have, but in her effort to wear every one she was given, it started to create an issue, as she explained at the Women’s Leadership Summit.  “Taylor Swift, I just went two nights in a row in Indianapolis. I’ve been three times,” Clark said. “I had a ton [of bracelets], all the way up the arms. I had to take them off, my circulation was getting cut off! Everyone was just chucking their bracelets at me. I’ve seen her three times, and every time the show has just gotten better.”  She showed off her collection on Instagram during one of the shows and it was a lot of bracelets.  Clark has spent the last year or two learning the ups and downs of life as a superstar, but this is certainly a very unique pitfall of fame, being so popular you get too many friendship bracelets and start to lose feeling in your arm."

	The NBA Cup is back for a second season, and here's how it will all work and what groups each team ended up in.","The NBA’s efforts to add a little excitement to the doldrums of its regular season will return on Tuesday evening. For the second straight year, the league will hold its new cup competition, now known as the Emirates NBA Cup. The first year was fun, with the Los Angeles Lakers winning the whole thing by knocking off the Indiana Pacers in Las Vegas, and now, the NBA will continue its efforts to turn this nascent event into a crucial part of its calendar. What does this all mean? Well, we tried to answer that today by explaining what’s new this year, how the whole thing will work, and why we’re excited to watch this as it tries to become a tentpole event on the NBA calendar. So is this just the In-Season Tournament but with a new name? It is! While the NBA has never explicitly said this, my assumption is that they spent the first year calling it the In-Season Tournament so fans would get a sense of what it is before calling it what they always wanted to call it: The NBA Cup, or more specifically, the Emirates NBA Cup. Or maybe they just couldn’t find a sponsor in the first year. What’s that Emirates thing? I’ve seen its logo on courts but never actually looked into what it is. It’s an airline based out of the United Arab Emirates that sponsors a lot of stuff. They’re sponsoring this event, which is the second-best thing that the NBA does, and fortunately, Emirates has plenty of experience sponsoring the second-best thing, as they are the shirt sponsor for Arsenal. What? Just let me cook. Ok, so, any major differences from last year other than the name? A big one are the courts. Last year, they came under criticism from players (who kept slipping on them) and fans (who thought some were huge eyesores, particularly because of the weird, cumbersome stripe they had going down the middle of the courts). They’re not nearly as bad this year, as they replaced the stripe with rings in the center of the floor and got rid of some of the more abrasive designs that just do not work on television. I’m sure not everyone will love them, but I think they are a huge improvement on last year — we just have to see if players struggle with their footing on them, or else the aesthetic changes do not matter at all. What about point differential? I know some players disliked that. Well, that’s still sticking around as a potential tiebreaker for which teams do and do not advance. Frankly, I think it’s fine and we saw last year that some of the European players were trying to egg their teammates on — Domantas Sabonis was the main one I remember — but it’ll still take a bit of a shift for everyone to get on board with it. Remind me how determining how teams advance will work again? Sure! Right from the league: So the easiest way to move on is to just win your group and not worry about any tiebreakers. That is correct. Well then, what do the groups look like? Once again, the NBA broke things up into three groups of five teams in each conference — this will, hopefully, look a lot cleaner when expansion happens, we get up to 32 teams, and they can do groups of four in each conference where each team plays group games home and away. The group games will happen on Tuesdays and Fridays starting tonight and running through Dec. 3. Here’s how it all looks: West Group A: Minnesota, LA Clippers, Sacramento, Houston, Portland West Group B: Oklahoma City, Phoenix, LA Lakers, Utah, San Antonio West Group C: Denver, Dallas, New Orleans, Golden State, Memphis East Group A: New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Charlotte East Group B: Milwaukee, Indiana, Miami, Toronto, Detroit East Group C: Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington How do these teams qualify for the knockouts? Same as last year — win your group and you get a spot. Both conferences then get one remaining spot for a wild card team, which goes to the best remaining team that did not automatically qualify by winning its group. This is probably where those aforementioned tiebreakers would come in, but you never know. And will the knockouts work like last year, too? Yup! Single-elimination basketball games, with the quarterfinals happening on-site at home arenas and the semifinals and final happening in Las Vegas. The quarters are on Dec. 10 and 11, the semis are on Dec. 14, and the final is on Dec. 17. And are these games all considered regular season games, too? For the most part they are — group games, the quarters, and the semis will all count towards regular season records again, while the championship game will not. So it looks a lot like last year, then. That’s right, the league has, essentially, decided to keep a lot of things the same other than the name and the courts. Oh, also, as a programming note: home teams will wear their Statement Edition uniforms, while road teams wear their Association edition uniforms, according to the league. Huh, well then, ok. You don’t seem enthused about all of this, dear reader. Yeah, I mean, I am still unsure why I should care about this. Well that’s easy: You don’t have to! You’re an adult with agency and the ability to care about whatever you want, times are tough, maybe you don’t want to get super personally invested in a new thing the NBA is doing, that’s fine. But you seem to like this. I do! Why? I think a big split I have noticed here is “fans who like soccer” and “fans who do not,” with the former being more open to the idea of a midseason cup competition — Adam Silver has compared the NBA Cup to the FA Cup in English football, but basically every domestic league has a secondary cup competition. The thing is that these competitions are universally considered not as important as winning the league, but they are still important because it’s an opportunity to win something historic and provide some validation for a team’s season. The NBA Cup is only in its second year, so clearly, it has a way to go before it gets taken that seriously — the whole saga with the Lakers debating putting up a little banner is an example of this. But the FA Cup, for example, is not considered cool because everyone farts around and then Manchester City wins it at the end. It’s considered cool because teams from several levels of English football have a chance to win it, and sometimes, you get magical runs to the very end. We got a glimpse of what that could look like last year when the Indiana Pacers nearly won the whole thing. Hell, if not for the fact that they’re the Lakers, it’d probably be viewed as proof of concept that the final was between a Play-In team and an upstart young squad trying to win something for the first time. That is, to steal a phrase from the English, the magic of the cup. So acknowledging that this isn’t as important as winning the NBA Finals is fine? One-hundred percent. The longer the NBA sticks with this — and, let’s face it, Silver is essentially staking his legacy as a commissioner on this becoming a big deal — the more likely it is that it’ll settle into a spot where fans/franchises like that it is a thing that they can win, all while understanding that the big prize is still waiting for them in June. It helps, of course, that there’s a financial incentive to do well. Remind me what that is. Sure! Players whose teams make the quarterfinals make $50,000, players whose teams make the semifinals make $100,000, players on the runners-up make $200,000, and players on the team that wins the whole thing makes $500,000. Nice. I agree. Anyway, this sounds like, bare minimum, a thing I can have on my television on Tuesdays and Fridays. It is, and really, if that’s all that comes from this for the next year or two, that’s totally fine. Something like this will only become a big deal the more it happens and the more it becomes ingrained as part of the sport’s culture, and as long as this year is a step towards doing that, I’m sure it’ll all work out in the long-run. Nice. Well, I suppose I can tune in. That you can, and if you want to know what games are on, when they’re on, and which networks they’ll be on, you can click right here."

While the league will have a presence in a few different places, its two main events — All-Star Saturday Night and the All-Star Game — will set up shop at the Chase Center in San Francisco, which is the home of the Golden State Warriors. It stands to reason that we’ll see some of the big names associated with the franchise involved in the festivities — Steph Curry, if I had to guess, is going to be an extremely busy man for a few days. And in the lead-up to the league making its way to California, a number of the biggest names in music from the Bay Area teamed up with the Warriors to release a new song in celebration of the All-Star Game going to San Francisco. The track is titled “Players Holiday ‘25,” and features Saweetie, G-Eazy, P-Lo, LaRussell, Larry June, Kamaiyah, Thuy, and YMTK.

	In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, Most Valuable Promotions clarified that the record-breaking boxing match was not rigged in Paul’s favor. 
	“It is further illogical and inane that MVP, in the debut of a hopeful long-term partnership with the world’s biggest streamer—an organization that made its first-ever foray into live professional sports with Paul vs. Tyson—would even so much as consider such a perverse violation of the rules of competition,” detailed the statement. 
	Earlier this month, the former YouTube vlogger faced off against the former undisputed world heavyweight champion in a boxing match broadcast on Netflix. The bout, which had viewers fighting streaming issues, resulted in a unanimous decision victory for Paul in the officially sanctioned match.  
	After the fight, Michael Irvin, sports commentator and former NFL player, joined Cam’Ron and Mase’s It Is What It Is talk show and shared his belief that the results of the match were predetermined. 

	








 
	“That fight was a lie,” he exclaimed. “Everybody’s lying […] they had no intentions to really strap it on. If you look through that, I didn’t see one patented uppercut by Mike Tyson. What did Mike Tyson win on? Uppercut.”

	“This is not the first time Jake Paul has faced unfounded skepticism or outright disbelief as a professional athlete, and frankly, the claim that his bout must have been rigged is just the latest backhanded compliment to come his way,” Nakisa Bidarian, co-founder of Most Valuable Promotions reiterated to THR.  
	“This event, which broke attendance and viewership milestones for a professional sporting event, is yet another example of his ability to deliver on the biggest stage. As long as Jake continues to exceed expectations, there will always be those who try to discredit his achievements.

He eventually landed on his dad’s Los Angeles Lakers squad in the second round of this year’s NBA draft. After just a few games, however, he was sent to play in the NBA’s G League to build up his skills.  
	Upon his arrival, it was reported that Bronny would “shuttle” between both teams during an undisclosed period of time and will only be playing in G League home games, as to not fly commercial with his South Bay Lakers teammates. It is also reported that Bronny would be skipping road games due to the team staying at affordable hotels like the Courtyard-Marriott, rubbing many, including former NFL star and podcaster Ryan Clark, the wrong way.

	








 
	On his The Pivot podcast, Clark shared his confusion over Bronny’s ability to skip games due to travel and lodging accommodations when he hasn’t earned his stripes as an athlete just yet.

	“What has Bronny James done that he shouldn’t be able to stay at the Courtyard-Marriott?,” Clark questioned. “You say, ‘well, they fly commercial.’ What has Bronny James done where he should be too good to fly commercial? The pros isn’t about where you came from, how you were raised, what your parents had. Professional sports is about how well you can contribute, and you don’t get treated differently because of your parents.” A post shared by The Neighborhood Talk (@theneighborhoodtalk) 
	Many agree with Clark, including ESPN reporter Brian Windhorst, who believes coddling Bronny now will be “detrimental” to his career, adding that he believes the special treatment the former USC student receives from the Lakers has gone “too far,” The Post reports.   
	Another ESPN insider, however, is arguing that the Lakers are treating Bronny differently because, well, he’s different.  
	“Bronny James isn’t just your normal, everyday G League player,” ESPN’s Shams Charania said on The Pat McAfee Show on Tuesday. 
	“I don’t know if it’s a security thing, but there’s a different level of fanfare when he’s on the road for these G League games, a different level of everything when he’s with that G League team. How do you manage that on the road? I don’t think the door is necessarily completely shut on him playing in those road games as the G League season goes on, but as of right now that is the plan that the Lakers have laid out, and they want him to continue to shuttle back and forth, spend as much time on the active roster as possible.”

The fight ended up being highly underwhelming for many, and Michael Irvin recently shared his belief that most likely was not an accident. 
	“That fight was a lie,” he said during an appearance on Cam’ron and Ma$e’s popular sports talk show It Is What It Is. He continued, citing how both boxers didn’t seem to be putting in 100% effort and Iron Mike did not utilize a special move in his arsenal. “Everybody’s lying […] they had no intentions to really strap it on. If you look through that, I didn’t see one patented uppercut by Mike Tyson. What did Mike Tyson win on? Uppercut.”

	








 
	The NFL Hall Of Famer revealed rumors he heard that could explain why the fight wasn’t as exciting as it was promoted to be. “I heard some people talking about they couldn’t put [Mike Tyson’s uppercut] in the contract,” he stated. “He couldn’t body and then uppercut. Like, how can you put that in a fight contract?”

	Michael Irvin continued his assessment of the fight and rumored contrast terms by drawing a parallel to his NFL career. “That’s like making me play a game without running a slant route in the deep end or the deep out,” he said. “You do what you do best. If they take that away, you ain’t that dude anymore, and they took that away.” 
DJ Whoo Kid supported Irvin’s claims when he recounted a conversation he had with Jake Paul at a fight after-party, saying, “Legally they each cannot go at each other hard.” Despite being disappointed by how the boxing match went, the former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver was happy to see Mike Tyson secure a large payday. “I’m happy he got every dime, or whatever it is,” he said. “I want him to get his money. I just wanted him to free the beast.” 
	Per the final tally of the fight, Tyson threw 97 punches and only landed 18. Paul threw 278 punches and landed 78. Iron Mike was paid $20 million and Paul got $40 million. One valid explanation for the underwhelming bout is the health issues Tyson dealt with in the lead-up, which made them postpone the match as it was originally booked for July. He suffered from an ulcer flare-up and revealed that he almost died in June. 

	








 
	“This is one of those situations when you lost but still won,” Mike Tyson wrote on X. “I’m grateful for last night. No regrets to get in ring one last time. I almost died in June. Had 8 blood transfusions. Lost half my blood and 25lbs in hospital and had to fight to get healthy to fight so I won. To have my children see me stand toe to toe and finish 8 rounds with a talented fighter half my age in front of a packed Dallas Cowboy stadium is an experience that no man has the right to ask for. Thank you.”

	On Nov. 6, Portis, the Milwaukee Bucks forward released a public message via Instagram pleading for the public’s assistance in locating the stolen items, which he’s willing to pay $40,000 cash for. In the video, Portis spoke of his love for the city of Milwaukee, where he became a resident after signing a deal with the Bucks organization in 2020. 
	“Over the last four-and-a-half seasons, I’ve considered Milwaukee as a home,” Portis, 29, said. “I’ve grown here, I come here a boy and elevated into a man. The love you guys have given me here isn’t something I’ve ever felt before in my NBA career.”

	








 
	He continued, explaining the circumstances behind the burglary, which occurred while Portis was out of town for the Bucks’ matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers earlier this month.

	“While I was at the game yesterday, we had a home invasion and they took most of my prized possessions,” Portis added, expressing the importance that the items, which he did not specify, hold to him and his family. 
	The burglary of Portis’ home marks the latest in a string of home invasions seemingly targeting professional athletes that have occurred in recent months. 
	In September, Minnesota Timberwolves guard Mike Conley’s Minnesota home was broken into and ransacked, with jewelry being listed among the items stolen. Authorities believe the burglary of Portis and Conley’s homes could possibly be connected due to similarities in the two break-ins, despite occurring in neighboring states. 
	NFL stars and reigning Super Bowl champions Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce’s homes were also burglarized in October, within a 48-hour period of one another. While no items were reported as stolen from Mahomes’ residence, the culprits in the burglary of Kelce’s home made off with $20,000 after breaking into the property through a rear door.

	








 
	Drafted in the first round of the 2015 NBA Draft by the Chicago Bulls, Portis has spent time with Bulls, Washington Wizards, and New York Knicks before joining the Bucks, winning a championship with the team in 2021.

Tyson, however, walked out to the ring with pure intention of throwing down and nothing more. And all the built-up tension was released as the two combatants entered the ring for the highly-anticipated showdown. 
	While both Tyson and Paul promised to knock the other boxer out before the 5th round, the match surprisingly went for the entire eight rounds. Tyson came out swinging for the first two rounds but Father Time quickly got Iron Mike together, as the icon began to slow down with each subsequent round.

Anthony expressed that the national spotlight would benefit both him and the rest of his teammates who are looking to restore Syracuse to greatness and possible futures in the NBA. “All that played a part into why I chose Syracuse,” Kiyan said on the podcast. 
	“I’m overwhelmed,” La La said following her son’s announcement during the podcast. “I’m happy because he’s happy…It’s big shoes to fill, but at the same time, this is his moment, his lane and his time to create his own reality.”

	Kiyan Anthony also talked to ESPN about his decision, saying, “Ultimately, it came down to my relationship with the staff. From day one, when they started recruiting me, they made me feel like it was family. My dad’s name on the facility is special, but I want to go in there and create my own name, and I’ve already done that through my dedication in the offseason, with early-morning practices, playing at camps, playing on the circuit.” 
	Kiy then spoke about the culture that Coach Adrian Autry is trying to establish with the Orangemen basketball unit. Anthony expressed to the outlet that Autry, who was named the head coach after the 2022-23 season, had already begun getting to work on the 2025 season. 
	“I’m going to do everything Coach Autry needs me to do,” Anthony added. “We talk a lot, especially late at night, about how we can make Syracuse basketball great. Off the court, Coach is super cool. You could go out with him on a Friday night. He’s still young and connects with all his players; he is very relatable.” 
	While Carmelo Anthony only played one season for the Orangemen, his impact on the university is undeniable. 
	During his lone 2003 season, Melo, a freshman, led the Orangemen to a storybook national championship. His performance was one for the ages, with the Brooklyn native being named both an All-American and the NCAA Final Four’s Most Outstanding Player. Kiyan understands the pressure, but wants to carve out his own page in the NCAA history books.

	








 
	According to ESPN, Kiyan Anthony is currently ranked No. 36 in the out of 100 players and “is one of the best pure scorers in the country.”

Thursday (Nov. 14) found the two men doing their final weigh-in and stare down ahead of their Netflix exhibition. Tyson weighed in at 233 pounds and promptly took his spot on stage. Paul was clocked at 220 pounds, a career-high for him, and then began his usual antics. Hitting the stage in a crawling stance, Jake Paul then immediately began running toward Iron Mike, getting directly in his face. 
ESPN reports that around this time, the YouTuber “purposefully” stepped on Tyson’s foot, to which he responded by slapping him in the face. A source close to the event claimed that Mike Tyson had grown “tired” of the content creator’s trash talk in the days leading up to Thursday. So, Paul stepping on the OG’s foot finally set him over the top, resulting in him slapping his opponent. “[Mike Tyson] hits like a bi**h! It’s personal now. He must die!” Paul dramatically screamed to the crowd while Tyson walked away from the stage.

	The slap marks a shift in Mike Tyson’s behavior towards Paul. Throughout the event’s rollout, Tyson and Paul have played it fast and loose, keeping the banter semi-playful while throwing in a couple of laughs and jabs here and there. However, as the day of the fight quickly approached, Tyson transformed into something far more intense. On Tuesday (Nov. 12), the boxing legend talked to reporters about the fight, promising to unleash “the devil himself” on Friday night. 
	“I’m bringing the devil himself [to the ring],” Tyson told ESPN. “There are no feelings attached. My own mother should be very careful if she has to get in the ring with me. When it’s over, it’s over. But while the process is going on, my intention is to hurt him. I hope he has the same intentions, or he is in trouble.” 
	Mike Tyson’s first fight in almost two decades will go down on Friday (Nov. 15) at 8 PM EST live on Netflix.

Sports,"Carmelo Anthony, Rudy Gay Chime In On Drake-DeMar DeRozan Feud",https://www.vibe.com/news/sports/carmelo-anthony-rudy-gay-drake-demar-derozan-feud-1234943651/,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:22:01 +0000",The biggest topic of the year and all of its subsidiaries continues to make headlines.,"The intersection of Hip-Hop and sports means twice as many people chiming in on topics involving artists and athletes. Former NBA stars Carmelo Anthony and Rudy Gay recently chimed in on the recent back and forth between Drake and DeMar DeRozan, which was a byproduct of the 6 God’s feud with Kendrick Lamar earlier this year. 
	“I think Drake was hurt a little bit because of the relationship he built with DeMar in Toronto,” Melo said on an episode of his show 7PM In Brooklyn. “Representing the 6, Raptors — you know that was a lot of connection with those two. He’s a Raptor for life from a basketball standpoint. Yes, that jersey should be going up.” 

	








 
	Gay, who just recently retired from the NBA, previously played for the Raptors, and is a new recurring co-host on 7PM, disapproved of Drizzy’s behavior. “That’s wack, man. Drake is wack for that,” he asserted. “You gotta pull up on DeMar if you feel that way before you go on camera.” Melo agreed, especially regarding the Toronto rapper’s comments on taking down DeRozan’s banner if the Raptors ever hung one up for him.

	“Drake did a lot when he said I’ma go up there and take it down. That part is a lot,” Carmelo Anthony said. However, he acknowledged that DeRozan turned himself into Drake’s opposition when he joined Kendrick Lamar on stage at The Pop Out concert and appeared in the “Not Like Us” music video. “Those are shots. You my man, we in the crib, we hanging, we building the 6 up. From that standpoint, that would f**k me up, too. I’m gonna feel a way no matter what, but yes, you do have a conversation. As a man, you have a conversation.” 
	Though Rudy Gay did not like the “First Person Shooter” rapper’s actions, he leveled with Anthony on that part. “If you got a problem, come at me,” he said. “To see your man’s out there dancing with the enemy, that’s kinda crazy.” 
	Drake and DeMar DeRozan went viral earlier this month when the For All The Dogs rapper sat courtside for the Toronto Raptors matchup against the Sacramento Kings. At one point, he was interviewed on air and said, “Unfortunately, we’re playing this goof [DeRozan] tonight, but it is what it is” as well as “If you ever put up a DeRozan banner, I’ll go up there and pull it down myself.”

	








 
	After the Raptors defeated the Kings, Drake could be seen mouthing “F**k outta here pu**y” as DeRozan walked off the court. During a post-game press conference, the six-time All-Star was asked about the comments regarding the banner and said, “Well he gon’ have a long way to climb to take it down, so tell him good luck.” 
	This is a significant change in their relationship, just three years after DeRozan said that Drake would “forever have a friend” in him. When he was traded from the Raptors to the Spurs, despite being told he would not be traded, the five-time Grammy winner invited him to his house and gave him support in his time of disappointment. Even after appearing at The Pop Out and in the “Not Like Us” music video, he claimed that he still had love for the OVO head honcho. Those days are seemingly over.

The Baltimore Ravens came away with a huge road win over the Los Angeles Chargers on Monday night as John Harbaugh beat his little brother, Jim, for the third time in their illustrious coaching careers.  While the Ravens got back in the win column, they have a short week and a very tough opponent upcoming which requires special attention from one player in particular when breaking down the film.  Saquon Barkley, the elite running back for the Philadelphia Eagles, has been putting together an MVP-caliber season that notched another milestone in the team's latest win over the Los Angeles Rams.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Philadelphia Eagles running back Kenneth Gainwell is congratulated by running back Saquon Barkley after scoring against the Los Angeles Rams in Inglewood, California, Sunday, Nov. 24, 2024. (AP Photo/Ryan Sun) Barkley set the single-game franchise record for rushing yards with 255, breaking Eagles Hall of Fame member LeSean ""Shady"" McCoy, who had previously held it with 217 yards. Barkley did so by ripping over two monster rushing touchdowns, while also hauling four catches for 47 receiving yards to break 300 yards from scrimmage on his incredible night.  At the moment, Barkley is on pace to beat Adrian Peterson's 2012 rushing season with the Minnesota Vikings, where he ultimately won MVP after falling just nine yards shy of breaking the single-season rushing record by Eric Dickerson.  All of that is to say the Ravens have a ""tall task,"" as one of their star defenders said to Fox News Digital.  RAVENS STAR KYLE HAMILTON TALKS ABOUT HELPING MILITARY CHILDREN FOR NFL'S ANNUAL MY CAUSE MY CLEATS ""A lot of teams have tried and failed at it this season,"" Ravens star safety Kyle Hamilton said while also discussing his choice of Our Military Kids as the organization to represent for ""My Cause My Cleats"" this week. ""But I think on a short week, it’s gonna be a lot of preparation, just mental stuff to put us in the right position to be successful. Not being in the wrong gaps, not fitting wrong as a DB, tackling well.  ""[Running the ball] I think that’s such a big part of this team. They run the ball really well, but they also have weapons on the outside to throw the ball to if you get too aggressive. They keep you honest, but I think knocking out the run game will help us out a lot winning that game."" Barkley leads the NFL with 1,392 rushing yards and has scored 10 times on the ground this year, making him one of the most productive backs in the NFL.  But Hamilton knows Barkley and the Eagles, while owning the top rushing attack at 193.4 yards per game, are not the best all-around offense in the league. He watches it every week when he’s on the sidelines.  Baltimore Ravens safety Kyle Hamilton prior to the game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Raymond James Stadium. (Kim Klement Neitzel-Imagn Images) The Ravens are averaging a whopping 426.7 yards per game compared to the Eagles’ 389.1. And while quarterback Lamar Jackson’s dual threat abilities with his arm and legs play a large role there, a lot of it has to do with the addition of Derrick Henry this offseason, which is clearly paying dividends.  In the Ravens’ win over the Chargers, Henry totaled 140 yards on the ground, giving him 1,325 total on the year – just behind Barkley. He also has 13 rushing touchdowns, though for the first time this season, he wasn’t able to find the end zone against Los Angeles. While Hamilton and his defensive brothers are ready to make plays in one of the league’s most anticipated games this Sunday, he also wants to see himself on the sidelines more often than not.  That means Jackson, Henry and the Ravens’ offense are in control. ""We want to be out there playing and making plays, but typically if you dominate time of possession, you win the game,"" Hamilton explained. ""Having those long drives, keeping us fresh and going out there playing fast. We get three-and-outs, you kinda get into a groove right there and you can get the score really high at that point. Score points, get a three-and-out.  Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley uns the ball against the Los Angeles Rams at SoFi Stadium. (Gary A.

Las Vegas Raiders coach Antonio Pierce is speaking out just over 24 hours after his team suffered a heartbreaking loss to the Kansas City Chiefs on Friday. Pierce, who is in his first full season as the Raiders head coach, told members of the media that the Raiders believed referees had blown a whistle moments before the ill-fated fumble on the poorly timed snap. In the case of a whistle, the play in question would have been ruled dead. Pierce also noted that the Raiders intend to submit video evidence in support of the claim to the NFL office for further review.

But the Raiders had a costly miscue on third down from the Kansas City 38-yard line with just 15 seconds remaining.

The NFL did stipulate that a false start would have been assessed if the clock was running at the time of the mishandled snap. Patrick Mahomes then took a knee to allow the final seconds to tick off the clock. The Chiefs recover a fumbled snap at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Nov. 29, 2024.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,"Coach of trans SJSU volleyball player blames teams that forfeited for 'appalling, hateful messages' to players",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/sjsu-volleyball-coach-trans-player-blames-teams-forfeited-appalling-hateful-messages-players,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 21:58:56 -0500",San Jose State volleyball head coach Todd Kress spoke out against teams that forfeited matches against his team after losing the conference championship.,"San Jose State University's women's volleyball co-captain Brooke Slusser told 'The Ingraham Angle' she is standing up for herself and her team as sports journalist Michele Tafoya reacts. San Jose State volleyball head coach Todd Kress provided a statement to Fox News Digital  Saturday after his team's loss in the Mountain West Conference tournament final to Colorado State.  Kress addressed the national controversy surrounding a transgender player on his team and seven forfeited conference matches, including a tournament semifinal with Boise State.  ""I will not sugarcoat our reality for the last two months. Our team prepared and was ready to play each match according to established Mountain West and NCAA rules of play. We did not take away anyone’s participation opportunities,"" Kress wrote.  Boise State, Wyoming, Utah State and Nevada forfeited a total of seven matches against SJSU this season.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Kress said each of those forfeits resulted in the team's players, coaches and staffers receiving ""appalling, hateful messages."" ""Sadly, others who for years have played this same team without incident chose not to play us this season. To be clear, we did not celebrate a single win by forfeiture. Instead, we braced for the fallout. Each forfeiture announcement unleashed appalling, hateful messages individuals chose to send directly to our student-athletes, our coaching staff and many associated with our program,"" Kress wrote.  The coach, in just his second season with the team, admitted it was one of the toughest seasons of his life.  ""This has been one of the most difficult seasons I’ve ever experienced, and I know this is true as well for many of our players and the staff who have been supporting us all along. Maintaining our focus on the court and ensuring the overall safety and well-being of my players amid the external noise have been my priorities,"" Kress said.  SJSU TRANSGENDER VOLLEYBALL SCANDAL: TIMELINE OF ALLEGATIONS, POLITICAL IMPACT AND A RAGING CULTURE MOVEMENT Kress was named in a lawsuit filed by team co-captain Brooke Slusser and several other Mountain West players against the conference and San Jose State. The lawsuit alleges Kress has communicated with a private lawyer as part of his effort to get Slusser removed from the team and has told others he has filed Title IX complaints against Slusser based not on comments Slusser has made in practice, but on communications Slusser has made to the media and in public forums concerning her beliefs. Slusser has also alleged the university has threatened to take away her scholarship for speaking on the issues of sharing a team, locker room and bedroom with transgender teammate Blaire Fleming.  Still, Kress thanked Slusser in his statement Saturday, along with Fleming and the other seniors on the team.  ""Our team played their hearts out today, the way they have done all season. I want to recognize and thank our seniors — Alessia [Buffagni], Chandler [Manusky], Brooke [Bryant], Brooke and Blaire — for their tremendous efforts on the court all season long. They have all helped us to get where we are,"" Kress wrote.  Kress also thanked San Jose State University Police Chief Michael Carroll for his work protecting the team from potential threats this season.  A San Jose State spokesperson previously confirmed to Fox News Digital that the program did not formally notify any of the opponents on its schedule of the situation involving Fleming and Slusser ahead of matches this season after Slusser joined her first lawsuit against the NCAA in September over her trans teammate's presence.  However, that spokesperson also confirmed the university did coordinate police protection for the players with the schools that hosted the team's away matches after security measures had to be elevated due to the attention the team was getting.  When Southern Utah became the first program to announce it would be forfeiting a match against the Spartans in early September, that was the first indicator of heightened security. That’s when the college brought in armed security. INSIDE SAN JOSE STATE'S POLICE BATTLE TO PROTECT WOMEN'S ATHLETES THREATENED BY A TRANSGENDER CULTURE WAR A San Jose State University spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital the volleyball team was told it would be getting added security of some kind after the first forfeit by an opposing program as news of Slusser’s lawsuit spread. Shortly after the first forfeit, the university’s in-house police department was alerted to the situation and got involved. Police protection was assigned for every game thereafter, and police departments at other campuses were assigned to protect the team when it traveled.  Police presence was noticeably strong for the Spartans' first meeting against eventual conference champion Colorado State Oct. 3. Multiple officers were photographed on the court that night, looking alert in the stands, entrances and at the players.  Colorado State University Police behind the San Jose State University Spartans' bench monitor Moby Arena during a volleyball match between the Spartans and the Colorado State Rams in Fort Collins, Colo., Oct. 3, 2024. (Santiago Mejia/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images) Slusser previously told Fox News Digital she had received a warning from a teammate Oct. 2, the night before a match, to ""stay away"" during the match because something ""bad"" was going to happen to her.  San Jose State University responded to questions about whether federal investigators had been involved.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The university has asked students and staff to share all concerning communications with UPD to be evaluated and addressed appropriately, including in conjunction with proper authorities where appropriate,"" San Jose State said in a previous statement. And Kress was tasked with coaching his team through all of it. Kress is not the coach who recruited Fleming to SJSU. That was former head coach Trent Kersten, who left the program after Fleming's first season in San Jose State in 2022.  A lawsuit that includes former Spartans assistant coach Melissa Batie-Smoose alleges Kersten recruited Fleming knowing the player was transgender but didn't tell other players.  Kress took over the program in 2023 and expressed frustration with Kersten's decision in an interview with OutKick.  San Jose State University Spartans head coach Todd Kress speaks with reporters after a loss against the Colorado State University Rams in Fort Collins, Colo., Oct. 3, 2024. (Santiago Mejia/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images) ""My frustration with Trent is an unfortunate situation,"" Kress said. ""[Kersten] obviously knows Blaire is in the crosshairs of this debate, and yet he has not reached out to [Fleming] one time to check in on [Fleming's] mental health. I find it sad, to be honest."" Before that, Kress suggested tension in the locker room because of Fleming's presence on the team and Slusser's lawsuits ""might not be a bad thing.""  ""Sometimes tension is not necessarily a bad thing, and I'm not saying that there is. But, you know, when you do have tension or you do have confrontations, I mean, I'm a person that believes that, from confrontation, good things usually happen. We settle our differences, and we work through it,"" Kress told reporters Oct. 3 after the first Colorado State match.  ""The last thing that I would want is there's the white elephant in the room, and there is no tension, we don't address it, and we never move past it, right? So I think there may be tension, but it dies. If we're in a meeting room and there's tension, it dies there. If there's tension on the court, it dies there. We really don't let the boundaries cross over, and that's how I think we've been so successful thus far."" Now the Spartans' tournament run is over. The players made it through unharmed. But the lawsuits continue.  Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter. Jackson Thompson is a sports writer for Fox News Digital.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,SJSU transgender volleyball player Blaire Fleming's college career likely over after championship loss,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/sjsu-trans-volleyball-player-blaire-flemings-college-career-likely-over-after-championship-loss,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 20:19:05 -0500",San Jose State transgender volleyball player Blaire Fleming probably played the athlete&apos;s final college volleyball game in a loss to Colorado State.,"Former NFL player Jack Brewer joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss his reaction to the team forfeiting, 'Squad' member Ayanna Pressley's concerns about the future of the Democratic Party and how he is giving back this Thanksgiving. Draw the curtain.  San Jose State volleyball player Blaire Fleming probably played the final college volleyball game of the athlete's career after a Mountain West Tournament final loss to Colorado State Saturday night.  Fleming led the Spartans on a run to the championship match in a senior season overshadowed by lawsuits from a teammate and a national controversy over Fleming being transgender. Fleming led the team in spikes and prompted four Mountain West rivals to forfeit a total of seven conference games, including a tournament semifinal. But Colorado State never shied away from playing Fleming or the Spartans.  The Rams played San Jose two times in the regular season, splitting the season series, and then taking the championship match three sets to one. Colorado State's Malaya Jones, the Mountain West player of the year, led the game with 26 kills after kneeling during the national anthem before the match.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Blaire Fleming of the San Jose State Spartans reacts during the second set against the Air Force Falcons at Falcon Court at East Gym Oct. 19, 2024, in Colorado Springs, Colo. (Andrew Wevers/Getty Images) Jones was also alleged to have conspired with Fleming in a plan to spike a ball in the face of San Jose State teammate Brooke Slusser in a game Oct. 3, according to a lawsuit filed by Slusser and a Title IX complaint.  Slusser was never spiked in the face, and the Mountain West concluded an investigation into the Title IX complaint, saying it did not find sufficient evidence of wrongdoing. Slusser's attorney has questioned the validity of the investigation.  Fleming, meanwhile, led San Jose State in the game with 17 kills but committed nine errors and hit poorly in the first two sets when the Spartans fell in a two-sets-to-none hole.  San Jose State's loss will also mean it won't advance to the NCAA tournament, which would have introduced further controversy with potential matchups against teams outside the conference. Boise State forfeited its Mountain West Tournament semifinal match against San Jose State, which could have set a precedent for teams in other states with laws that prevent transgender inclusion in women's sports.  WHO IS BLAIRE FLEMING? SJSU VOLLEYBALL PLAYER DOMINATING FEMALE RIVALS AND ENRAGING WOMEN'S RIGHTS GROUPS Boise State, Utah State, Wyoming, Nevada and non-conference opponent Southern Utah all forfeited regular-season matches against San Jose State this season amid the controversy. Meanwhile, Louisiana Tech, which played its season opener against San Jose State Aug. 30, has told Fox News Digital it did not know Fleming was a biological male and suggested the match wouldn't have happened if the team had known.  The situation became so widely publicized, Fleming's presence on the team drew criticism from President-elect Trump on the campaign trail during the most recent election cycle.  Trump weighed in on the situation involving Fleming during a town hall event on Fox News Channel’s ""The Faulkner Focus"" Oct. 17. Trump referenced Fleming specifically, describing a video in which one of the athlete's spikes hit another player.  ""I saw the slam. It was a slam. I never saw a ball hit so hard, hit the girl in the head,"" Trump said. ""But other people, even in volleyball, they’ve been permanently, I mean, they’ve been really hurt badly. Women playing men. But you don’t have to do the volleyball. We stop it. We stop it. We absolutely stop it. You can’t have it.""  Trump revealed his intention to ban transgender inclusion in women's sports if elected. It became a talking point he made sure to reference at every campaign rally from then until Election Day. He and Republican allies hammered Democrats' position of protecting transgender inclusion, which grew increasingly unpopular. A federal judge could have ended Fleming's career earlier but decided to allow the player to compete in the conference tournament.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Federal Judge Kato Crews of Colorado, appointed by President Biden in January, denied a motion for injunctive relief in a lawsuit by college volleyball players against the conference. The players were looking to have their forfeits for refusing to play against Fleming and the Spartans rescinded, which would, in turn, shift the standings heading into the tournament. They also wanted Fleming banned from the tournament.  Crews, however, wrote that the plaintiffs’ request for an emergency delay ""was not reasonable"" and ""would risk confusion and upend months of planning and would prejudice, at a minimum, (San Jose State) and other teams participating in the tournament."" Despite the lawsuits, Slusser and the rest of the San Jose State roster took the court with Fleming for matches all season.  Fleming was second in the conference in kills per set with a .386, still well behind Jones, who led the way at .457.  Fleming had a signature moment in the second-to-last match of the season against first-place Colorado State at home on Senior Day. Fleming led the game in kills with 24 and total attacks and clinched victory in the fifth set with a match-point service ace.  Right after the play, Fleming was swarmed by teammates in celebration. Even Slusser got involved. This group celebration took place just days after Slusser and other Mountain West players filed a second lawsuit over Fleming's presence on the team against San Jose State and the conference.  Now, Fleming, Slusser and their other senior teammates will look ahead to their post-volleyball lives.

But the Orange chipped away and tied the game on their first drive of the second half. Late in the third, though, with the game tied at 28, Devin Grant of Syracuse picked up a fumble and returned it 56 yards to the house to give Syracuse the lead. Miami responded with a touchdown, but the Orange answered with another one. On 4th and goal at the 15-yard line late in the game, the Hurricanes made the curious decision to kick a field goal to cut their deficit to four. Granted, scoring would have required a 15-yard play, but Miami also risked not touching the ball the rest of the game while still needing a touchdown.  That's exactly what happened. Syracuse got three first downs to end the game.

The Mountain West volleyball tournament final Saturday pits San Jose State and transgender player Blaire Fleming against Colorado State and its star, Malaya Jones. Fleming has been the subject of controversy, with two lawsuits objecting to Fleming's presence on the team as a transgender athlete. But Jones and her teammates introduced some controversy of their own.  Jones and teammates Kennedy Stanford and Naeemah Weathers knelt during the national anthem ahead of Saturday's match for the second night in a row.  The three players also knelt during the national anthem ahead of a semifinal match Friday night.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM After Friday's game, Colorado State head coach Emily Kohan told reporters the players have knelt before games for five seasons.  ""They've knelt since their freshman year, when the Black Lives Matter movement was going on, and, in this program, we raise critical thinkers to make decisions for what's important to them,"" Kohan said. ""And, for those three, they're Black players, and it's been important to them for five years. And they've stood their ground for saying that this is something that they believe in, and we've all supported them.""  Questions arose whether the Spartans would even play Saturday's match after their semifinal opponent, Boise State, forfeited a playoff match amid the controversy.

We get an opportunity to play for another championship tomorrow, but we also are showing some courage to be the team that says, ‘Hey, we’re going to go out there, and we’re gonna show courage in the way we play and that this can stop with us.’ ""We're not going to pass these difficult conversations on to the NCAA committee or any other team to have those crying conversations in the hotel."" Colorado State has been the best team in the conference this season, and San Jose State finished second. In their first match of the regular season Oct. 3, Spartans head coach Todd Kress thanked Kohan and her team for simply participating.  At the time, San Jose State had just had three matches wiped off its schedule due to forfeit over the Fleming controversy.  San Jose State University Spartans head coach Todd Kress speaks with reporters after a loss in an NCAA Mountain West women’s volleyball game against the Colorado State University Rams in Fort Collins, Colo., Oct. 3, 2024.

It's the people choosing not to play us, and that's very unfortunate when it comes to these young women that have earned the right to step on the court and play,"" Kress said in a postgame press conference Oct. 3.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fleming's San Jose State teammate Brooke Slusser is involved in two separate lawsuits, citing her experience with Fleming as a teammate. Slusser has alleged she was made to share living and changing areas with Fleming despite having never been told Fleming is a biological male.  Slusser's most recent lawsuit against the Mountain West alleges another San Jose State teammate was present for a meeting between Fleming and Jones in which they discussed a plan to throw the Oct. 3 match in favor of the Rams, while also planning to have Slusser spiked in the face by Jones. Those same allegations were included in a Title IX complaint by former Spartans assistant coach Melissa Batie-Smoose.  The Mountain West has concluded an investigation into the allegations of the Title IX complaint without finding sufficient evidence to support the claims.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Who is Blaire Fleming? SJSU volleyball player dominating female rivals and enraging women's rights groups,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/who-blaire-fleming-sjsu-trans-athlete-dominating-female-rivals-enraging-nation,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 07:00:25 -0500",San Jose State volleyball player Blaire Fleming will play for a conference championship at the center of a political firestorm over transgender inclusion.,"Former NFL player Jack Brewer joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss his reaction to the team forfeiting, 'Squad' member Ayanna Pressley's concerns about the future of the Democratic Party and how he is giving back this Thanksgiving. San Jose State volleyball player Blaire Fleming built a prosperous athletic resume en route to the epicenter of national controversy. Many of Fleming's past competitors had to settle for losses along the way. Fleming is the leader in kills for a San Jose State team that will compete in the Mountain West tournament final Saturday against Colorado State. The athlete's spiking ability has been a competitive asset and a point of outrage by critics, including President-elect Trump, amid the controversy over Fleming competing against women as a transgender athlete.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM But the team and coach Todd Kress have ridden the power of Fleming's spikes back to the conference final for the second time since 2022, Fleming's first season at San Jose State.  This time, they didn't even have to play in the semifinal to get there after Boise State forfeited a semifinal match to the Spartans amid the controversy. But even when Fleming's presence isn't prompting other teams to give a match away, which has resulted in seven conference wins for San Jose State this year, Fleming's natural physical ability is still there to help the team win.  That ability has been there since high school.  Fleming was born in 2002 at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, just south of Omaha. But Fleming grew up in Aldie, Virginia. Fleming has also been referred to as ""Brayden Fleming"" in reports from multiple media outlets. San Jose State's official volleyball website lists the player's birth name as Blaire Rene Fleming.  Fleming played girls' volleyball at John Champe High School. At a listed height of 6-foot-1, Fleming is inches taller than the average women's college volleyball recruit of 5-foot-9, according to NCSA College Recruiting.  The advantage in height and spiking ability coincided with Fleming being a game-changing player for John Champe and girls volleyball head coach Jasmine Jackson. In November 2018, Fleming posted a highlight reel for college recruiters on the high school sports social media site Hudl. Fleming's highlights showed multiple clips that demonstrated the athlete's leaping and spiking ability.  Most of the clips show the same type of play over and over again: Fleming leaping high above the net, higher than any other player on the court, and slamming the ball down with authority as trap music blared in the background. Multiple opponents were seen diving to the floor in an attempt to reach Fleming's spike on time but falling well short of where Fleming's spike landed. One year later, Fleming was the centerpiece of the best volleyball team in John Champe High School history with a historic 19-win season in 2019 – Fleming's senior year. That year, Fleming was named first-team all-district and set the school's single-season record for kills in a season with 266. Fleming set the school's single-game record for kills with 30 against Battlefield High School in September of that year.  The Hudl video of that game showed Fleming with dyed blonde hair, leading the team to victory with 30 powerful slams. Fleming's finished as runners-up in the district tournament and made the regional playoffs that year, and Fleming was crowned the team's MVP by teammates.  Fleming's college career began at Coastal Carolina during the COVID-affected 2020 season. So Fleming's college debut came a few months later than usual, in October that year. And even as a true freshman, Fleming averaged 1.86 kills per set, third on the team.  Fleming's dominance came out even more when the game mattered most. After a staggering 19-1 regular season, Coastal Carolina reached the Sun Belt Conference championship game against Texas State. Fleming put up career-highs in kills with 12, three digs and two blocks, but Fleming's team lost in the deciding fifth set. That was the last match Fleming played for Coastal Carolina, and it would be another 22 months before Fleming played another college volleyball game after entering the transfer portal.  No reason has been officially given by Fleming, nor San Jose State or Coastal Carolina, for the player deciding to transfer. If Fleming had stayed at Coastal Carolina, it's possible the player wouldn't have been playing in a conference championship game this year without breaking state law. South Carolina, where Coastal Carolina is located, passed the Save Women's Sports Act May 16, 2022. The bill was prefilled Nov. 17, 2021.  SJSU TRANSGENDER VOLLEYBALL SCANDAL: TIMELINE OF ALLEGATIONS, POLITICAL IMPACT AND A RAGING CULTURE MOVEMENT No stats or games have been recorded for Fleming for the 2021 season. But Fleming got a chance for a new start in California at San Jose State.  According to a lawsuit against the Mountain West filed by a plaintiff list that includes suspended San Jose State volleyball coach Melissa Batie-Smoose, former head volleyball coach Trent Kersten allegedly targeted Fleming as a transfer recruit and gave the athlete a full scholarship, allegedly while knowing Fleming is a biological male.  ""Prior to the 2022 season the then coach of the SJSU Team, Trent Kersten, recruited an outside hitter from Coastal Carolina University, a NCAA Division I program in Conway, South Carolina, named Blaire Fleming, who had entered the transfer portal,"" a lawsuit states.  ""Fleming was given a full scholarship to play for the SJSU Team. On information and belief, SJSU advised the MWC that Blaire Fleming was a trans-identifying male and would be participating in women’s volleyball on the SJSU Team."" Kersten left the program after the 2022 season.  California is one of 24 states that allow transgender student-athletes to play for teams that match their gender identity. The Golden State's law is one of the oldest of its type in the country, having been in place since 2013.  However, according to the lawsuit, when the program made the decision to recruit Fleming out of the transfer portal, the coaches involved allegedly didn't go out of their way to inform all the players on the team. San Jose State has confirmed to Fox News Digital the university never formally notified any of the opponents on its schedule of the ongoing controversy and lawsuits in which Fleming is named this season.  Former San Jose State volleyball players Alyssa Sugai and Elle Patterson have joined the lawsuit against the Mountain West and recounted the events that led to them no longer being on the team.  Sugai claims she was told by coaches she was not ""physical"" enough as a player compared to Fleming. ""As a result of her frustration and feelings of inadequacy, because she was not able to make the starting line-up through effort and sacrifice and because her diminished playing time behind Fleming prevented her from receiving offers through the transfer portal, Sugai faced depression during and after the transfer portal period and ultimately determined that she had no realistic choice other than to give up playing collegiate volleyball after the 2022 season,"" a court document states.  Blaire Fleming of the San Jose State Spartans attempts to block a shot during the first set against the Air Force Falcons at Falcon Court at East Gym Oct. 19, 2024, in Colorado Springs, Colo. (Andrew Wevers/Getty Images) ""Losing to Fleming caused Sugai to doubt her ability to play volleyball at a high level, even though she had rigorously trained and competed since childhood. It also caused her to doubt her self-worth and caused her to feel ‘defeated.’"" Patterson also played behind Fleming and alleges the university did not fulfill previous verbal offers of a scholarship to her for the 2023 and 2024 seasons. Patterson says she even paid full tuition to play in 2023 after being told she would get a scholarship for 2024. However, the program did not make good on that offer either, she alleges.  ""Ultimately, Patterson informed Associate Head Coach Batie-Smoose and Head Coach Todd Kress that she was financially unable to pay for full out-of-state tuition, room and board at SJSU again in 2024 and therefore would be unable to return to the SJSU Team without a scholarship,"" the documents state.  ""Nevertheless, Todd Kress remained firm in his position that Patterson would not receive a scholarship to play on the SJSU Team in 2024, and that Fleming would receive a full scholarship to play on the SJSU Team."" San Jose State volleyball co-captain Brooke Slusser will take the floor beside Fleming for the Spartans on Saturday night in the championship game. Slusser will be doing this despite being at the forefront of the lawsuit against the Mountain West over Fleming's presence on the team and the lawsuit against the NCAA over its policies on gender identity headed by Riley Gaines.  Slusser has alleged that she was never told what Fleming's biological sex was when Slusser transferred to San Jose State in 2023, one year after Fleming did. Slusser also alleges she shared living spaces with Fleming and frequently was assigned to share hotel rooms for road games because Fleming requested it.  ""Slusser did learn however that the reason she had been assigned to room with Fleming so often during road trips in the 2023 season was that Kress and other SJSU women’s volleyball officials asked Fleming who Fleming wanted to room with, and Fleming chose Slusser,"" the court documents say.  Slusser previously told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that she would not have ""opened up"" with Fleming on the personal level she had during that first season had she known Fleming was a transgender athlete.  The lawsuit claims Fleming admitted to being a biological male in a conversation with Slusser over ice cream in April.  ""Slusser asked why Fleming had not shared this information with her before, particularly as they had been living together. Fleming responded that there never seemed to be a good time to bring it up, and that he had been afraid that Slusser might not be his friend if Slusser knew the truth. Fleming also said that if Slusser was uncomfortable with it that Fleming would leave the volleyball team,"" the documents state.  Things got more complicated in October, when Slusser alleges she learned of a plot by Fleming to have her spiked in the face by a volleyball during a game against Colorado State Oct. 3. The lawsuit alleges the incident was reported by teammate Tanner Manusky to Kress and Batie-Smoose the night before the game, and that Manusky was present during a conversation between Fleming and Colorado State player Malaya Jones.  Jones is one of the only players in the conference with better kill numbers than Fleming.  Batie-Smoose was suspended by the program after filing a Title IX complaint that included the same allegations.  According to a letter obtained by Fox News Digital from Mountain West Commissioner Gloria Nevarez, the conference says it conducted an investigation into the allegations of the Title IX complaint but did not find sufficient evidence to confirm the claims. Slusser's attorney has provided a statement to Fox News Digital questioning the validity of the investigation.  Slusser previously told Fox News Digital the program's response to the allegations makes her feel ""unsafe"" and being treated unfairly compared to Fleming.  Brooke Slusser and Blaire Fleming (Getty Images) ""If this was me, and I was the one threatening to do this to my teammate who's caused so much commotion, there would have been action taken immediately,"" Slusser said. ""I was definitely very angry, and I was glad at first to know that it was already made aware to the coaching staff and compliance and everyone, but I don't know if that made me feel any differently. I was just angry because I didn't think someone would go to these lengths. ""Threatening to want to hurt one of your own teammates, I just feel like there's so many things in that whole conversation that would make a school want to get it dealt with.""  Slusser also said she has not spoken with Fleming about the allegations, adding that speaking with the athlete ""isn't worth my breath.""  ""I think anyone can see that's in my circle and in the gym that they're not here to support me. They're here to support Blaire, and they have decided that they will basically do anything to keep supporting Blaire and to not be there for me and my needs,"" Slusser said. ""I just have decided you can't really trust anyone here.""  Fox News Digital has reached out for a comment in response from Fleming via San Jose State University multiple times but has not received a response.  Despite these tensions, when Slusser and Fleming are on the court together, they play as one of the most effective duos in the conference. Slusser and Fleming were each named to the Mountain West all-conference honorable mention list.  The Spartans finished the regular season with the third-best hitting percentage in the conference. Slusser finished with a top 10 individual hitting percentage in the conference. Fleming was second in the conference in kills per set with a .386, still well behind Colorado State's Jones, who led the way at .457.  In Slusser's first lawsuit against the NCAA, she alleged Fleming's spikes travel at 80 miles per hour and that her and her teammates felt as though they ""couldn't protect themselves.""  Still, Slusser has been quick to help set up Fleming for some of those signature spikes despite the situation.  During games, they have been seen closely communicating, even patting each other on the back and huddling up next to each other.  Brooke Slusser and Blaire Fleming of the San Jose State Spartans call a play during the first set against the Air Force Falcons at Falcon Court at East Gym Oct. 19, 2024, in Colorado Springs, Colo.  (Andrew Wevers/Getty Images) In the first game played after Slusser filed her lawsuit against the Mountain West, the Spartans faced Colorado State in a rematch of a game in which Fleming was alleged to have conspired to have Slusser spiked in the face.  Fleming was cheered during Senior Day ceremonies by the San Jose State crowd, and some fans even brought signs into the arena in support of the transgender player.  And, with Slusser's help, Fleming put on one of the best performances of the athlete's career. Fleming finished the match with 24 kills, one shy of a career high, and a game-winning service ace in the decisive fifth set.  When the ball from that play hit the floor, Slusser joined the rest of her teammates in rushing to embrace Fleming and celebrate the game-winning play. It put the team in position to play in the conference tournament.  Fleming had not made any public statements Fox News Digital was aware of at the time of publication, since the controversy surrounding the team erupted nationally.  The athlete has been the subject of frequent online discussion that has become more confrontational as the season has progressed.  San Jose State did not respond to questions about whether Fleming has been harassed or threatened during controversy. However, the university has confirmed the team has had armed police protection since September after news of the first forfeit on the schedule. ""The team has been a subject of significant attention, not all of it positive, and we are ensuring their security,"" a spokesperson told Fox News Digital.  Fox News Digital provided a series of questions to San Jose State about the measures it is taking to protect the players, including whether digital forensics by the university police department is being used or whether the situation has been elevated to state or federal investigators.  ""The university has asked students and staff to share all concerning communications with UPD to be evaluated and addressed appropriately, including in conjunction with proper authorities where appropriate,"" said part of a statement San Jose State provided to Fox News Digital. Trump called out Fleming during a town hall event on Fox News Channel’s ""The Faulkner Focus"" Oct. 17. ""I saw the slam, it was a slam. I never saw a ball hit so hard, hit the girl in the head,"" Trump said. ""But other people, even in volleyball, they’ve been permanently, I mean, they’ve been really hurt badly. Women playing men. But you don’t have to do the volleyball. We stop it. We stop it. We absolutely stop it. You can’t have it.""  Trump also revealed his intention to ban transgender inclusion in women's sports if elected. San Jose State has insisted the footage Trump is referring to shows the ball hitting another player's arm, not her head. High-profile figures and social media groups, including Gaines, the International Council on Women's Sports (ICONS), XX-XY Athletics and the popular right-wing X account ""Libs of TikTok"" have frequently used Fleming's image and story to promote awareness for opposing transgender inclusion in women's and girls sports.  However, some have also come out in support of Fleming.  Fleming was defended in a recent ESPN interview by transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, who tied Gaines at the 2022 NCAA championships, sparking Gaines' ongoing lawsuit against the NCAA.  ""To have my own personal identity and personhood turned into a culture war talking point just totally takes all my humanity away. It can be very difficult to keep trying to persevere through that,"" Thomas said. Multiple left-leaning media outlets have chosen not to identify Fleming by name in coverage of the team and situation.  The issue of protecting Fleming's identity was even a lengthy talking point in a recent emergency hearing in Colorado that decided whether Fleming would be allowed to play in the Mountain West tournament.  Federal Judge Kato Crews presided over the hearing brought by Slusser, Batie-Smoose and the other Mountain West players with their lawsuit against the conference. The players and Utah State aimed to contest Fleming's eligibility to compete in the upcoming tournament and to reverse the six conference wins awarded to San Jose State after teams forfeited over Fleming's presence.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Crews dedicated the first 45 minutes of a hearing to a debate over what pronouns to use while referring to Fleming and whether the athlete's name should be used. Crews ruled that the player's name could be used and that anyone could use pronouns they felt like using.  Crews ruled that Fleming was eligible to play in the tournament. It was a decision that enraged activists fighting transgender inclusion and has only raised the heat of the controversy Fleming and the other Spartan players are playing through.  Fleming's presence has essentially ensured, on its own, that San Jose State will play in the conference championship with a chance to clinch an NCAA tournament berth after Boise State forfeited a semifinal match.  The last time Fleming played in a conference championship, the athlete had a career day. Now, Fleming is a senior, possibly playing college volleyball for the last time under a much brighter and intense national microscope. The country will watch and see how Fleming affects the course of women's sports history.  Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Georgia needed more than 60 minutes to avoid being upset - they also needed more than seven overtimes. Finally, when it was all said and done, Georgia took home a 44-42 victory over their in-state rival Georgia Tech in eight overtimes. It was the second-most overtimes in FBS history, one shy of Illinois and Penn State from 2021.

But after scoring a touchdown, they recovered a fumble and then scored another touchdown to force overtime. Nothing worked for either team, as passes fell incomplete and runs were stopped - the new overtime rules make teams alternate two-point attempts from the third overtime on.

"NY Post Sports – Latest News, Scores, Stats & Videos",Buffalo stadium threatened by lake-effect snow ahead of match between Bills and 49ers,https://nypost.com/2024/12/01/sports/buffalo-stadium-threatened-by-lake-effect-snow-ahead-of-match-between-bills-and-49ers/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 12:42:17 -0500","Highmark Stadium, situated in Orchard Park, is under a Lake-Effect Snow Warning for Sunday night’s San Francisco 49ers vs. Buffalo Bills game. Lake-effect snow bands could produce multiple feet of snow through parts of western New York. Kickoff is set for 8:20 p.m.","ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. – After a brutal loss on Sunday, the San Francisco 49ers will face another tough competition during Week 13’s Sunday Night Football matchup against the Buffalo Bills as snow, freezing temperatures and gusty winds from a potent winter storm are expected to douse western New York. The FOX Forecast Center is calling for heavy lake-effect snow, with multiple feet of snow possible for areas near and south of Highmark Stadium through the multi-day event lasting into next week. A Lake-Effect Snow Warning for Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park through the game, though latest projections as of Friday morning indicate the snow may drift south of Orchard Park during Sunday evening’s game. Snow totals can vary greatly depending on where the lake-effect snow bands set up. “Multiple feet of snow will be possible through the weekend in the most persistent lake snows,” the National Weather Service office in Buffalo said. “Snowfall rates will average 1 to 2 inches an hour, but higher rates will be possible.” Forecasters warned that travel will be very difficult and, at times, “nearly impossible” due to poor visibility and deep snow cover on roads. The Bills are coming off a bye week after winning against the previously undefeated Kansas City Chiefs. Rest and being no stranger to playing in extreme weather could set the Bills apart for a potential seven-game win streak. Bills tight end Dalton Kincaid could be back Sunday for the 49ers game. He will be a great option to use as your main tight end or even a flex option, as he could very well lead the Bills in targets this season. Also, hopeful to be back will be rookie wide receiver Keon Coleman from a wrist injury. San Francisco’s starting quarterback, Brock Purdy’s status is still up in the air for Sunday after he injured his shoulder in Week 11 against Seattle. Meanwhile, a now-healthy Christian McCaffrey should be an automatic start in your RB1 position. The reigning NFL Offensive Player of the Year was held to only 31 yards during their game against Green Bay, but due to the possibility of poor visibility due to snow and wind, fantasy owners can bank that he should get more than 11 carries in this game. With winds potentially gusting to 30 mph and arctic air invading, temperatures will feel anywhere from the single digits to the lower teens. Gusty winds will make kicking tough, and cold temperatures have been shown to affect the performance of how a quarterback can throw the ball. Should heavy snow bands set up over Orchard Park, Highmark Stadium could be in for another snow globe game similar to ones seen in years past.

					Never miss a story.				 The Bills head coach Sean McDermott said the team is prepared for whatever weather comes their way. “It’s just about how we respond to it. Our staff does a phenomenal job,” he said. McDermott said if snow needs to be shoveled from the stadium like in years past, they’re ready for it. “I’ve always been amazed since moving here, that you can get a foot, 2 feet, 3 feet, 7 feet (of snow), and the roads are cleared in some miraculous way,” McDermott said. While Bills fans remember last season when their Super Wild Card game against the Pittsburgh Steelers had to be postponed, it was the November and December of 2022 that Buffalo will never forget. Snow from the historic lake-effect snowstorm that hit Orchard Park in November 2022 was so deep that you could make an over 80-foot-tall snowman with all the snow on the Buffalo Bills’ football field. The Cleveland Browns were supposed to play the Bills at Highmark Stadium on that snow day, but NFL officials decided to move the game to Detroit’s covered Ford Field instead. Just a month later, a historic blizzard dropped feet of snow in nearby locations, stranding motorists and forcing a state of emergency across Erie County. The FOX Forecast Center says that this Thanksgiving weekend storm isn’t expected to produce as much snow as these historic days, but snow could cause road closures and significant travel delays across the state."
"NY Post Sports – Latest News, Scores, Stats & Videos",Chiefs’ struggling offense could be getting a Marquise Brown boost soon,https://nypost.com/2024/12/01/sports/chiefs-offense-could-be-getting-a-marquise-brown-boost-soon/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 12:34:16 -0500",The rich are getting richer.,"The rich are getting richer.  The Chiefs have escaped with narrow victory after narrow victory this season against an array of underwhelming teams, largely due to their ho-hum offense.  But the defending Super Bowl champions, going for a third consecutive title, could be seeing an uptick in explosiveness with the return of Marquise “Hollywood” Brown to their receiving group.  According to NFL.com, Brown has a Week 15 appointment with his surgeon that will determine whether or not he can return.  The former Ravens and Cardinals wideout has been out and on injured reserve with a shoulder injury, and he hasn’t suited up for the Chiefs during the regular season. Brown suffered a sternoclavicular shoulder joint injury in the Chiefs’ first preseason game back in August.  NFL.com noted that the initial plan was to have Brown rehab the injury and eventually return, but the shoulder didn’t heal as well as all parties had hoped, so they opted for surgery.  The expectation was that Brown would be done for the season.  Brown was one of Kansas City’s biggest acquisitions of the 2024 offseason, and his return could add another spark to the team’s passing game — which hasn’t been the bright spot it historically is with quarterback Patrick Mahomes.  The Chiefs are also missing wideout Rashee Rice, who was injured earlier this year and isn’t expected back anytime soon.  The Chiefs managed to add DeAndre Hopkins before the trade deadline in October, and he has made an immediate impact for the team.  They also welcomed back starting running back Isiah Pacheco during Friday’s win over the Raiders.  Pacheco returned from a fractured fibula that sidelined him following the first game of the season.  Brown is a former 1,000-yard receiver who caught 51 passes for 574 yards and four touchdowns while playing for the Cardinals last season.  His best season came in 2021 when he hauled in 91 passes for 1,008 yards and six touchdowns for the Ravens."

The senior defensive assistant of the Arizona Wildcats was so fired up Saturday before the team squared off against rival Arizona State that he head-butted helmeted defensive back Owen Goss in a wild pregame moment.  The Fox broadcast, which captured the initial exchange, then panned to Cecil, 60, on the sideline wearing an Arizona ball cap as blood dripped down his forehead. “Get into it, Chuck,” the commentator said, adding as the camera showed a bleeding Cecil, “And then, the eventual result is that.” Cecil’s efforts to hype up Arizona fell short as the Wildcats lost to the Sun Devils in the Territorial Cup, 49-7.  Arizona trailed 35-0 at halftime. “For what this game means to everybody here and everybody in this town and everybody in the state, for us to be so unproductive today is soul-crushing,” Wildcats coach Brent Brennan said postgame, according to Arizona Desert Swarm. Arizona State advanced to the Big 12 championship with the win. Cecil was the safeties coach for Arizona from 2021-23 and even played for the school in the 1980s before he was selected in the fourth round of the 1988 NFL Draft by the Packers. Cecil’s NFL career spanned from 1988-95, and he was even named to the Pro Bowl in 1992 while playing for Green Bay. A 1987 All-American and Pac-10 defensive player of the year, Cecil’s No. 6 is retired by Arizona.  He had previous coaching stints with the Titans in various roles, including defensive coordinator. He also had a run with the Rams as a secondary coach prior to re-joining Arizona in 2018."

Hunter, a two-way star and Heisman Trophy candidate, attempted to hug Lenee on the field postgame to start an exchange that ended with Lenee appearing to turn away from Hunter and both of them eventually pointing off-camera. While it’s unclear what prompted the exchange, Hunter posted four photos of the couple on Instagram the next day with the caption, “Queen,” followed by a crown emoji. Lenee, whose engagement to Hunter was announced in February, wore a jacket with “He12man” — a reference to Hunter’s jersey number — printed on the back to watch Colorado end its regular season with a 52-0 win over Oklahoma State at Folsom Field. The pair started dating while students at Collins Hill High School in Georgia and will be getting married in May 2025, according to Sports Illustrated. Hunter finished with 10 catches for 116 yards and three touchdowns while also adding two passes defended, one tackle and an interception on defense — the latest boost to his case for college football’s top honor, as well as for being one of the top picks in the 2025 NFL Draft. He began his collegiate career at Jackson State under Deion Sanders before transferring to Colorado when Sanders accepted the Buffaloes’ vacancy, and across the last two seasons, Hunter has collected 149 catches for 1,873 yards and 19 touchdowns, in addition to his regular contributions on defense. “He’s the best player in college football,” Sanders told reporters postgame. “You can find ways to hate, criticize and condemn him and you won’t come out of that looking professional. Travis Hunter proved today, and he’s proved every week, that he is the best player in college football.” Despite finishing 9-3 during Sanders’ second season, Colorado didn’t qualify for the Big 12 championship game — where Arizona State will face Iowa State — and will instead await its bowl location. Sanders said last week that Colorado’s best players — including Hunter and son Shedeur, the Buffaloes’ star quarterback — will play in their bowl game and not opt out, according to the Associated Press. “Our kids are going to play in our bowl game because that’s what we signed up to do,” Sanders told reporters, according to the AP. “We’re going to finish. We’re not going to tap out because that throws off the structure of next season.”"

Our team prepared and was ready to play each match according to established Mountain West and NCAA rules of play. We did not take away anyone’s participation opportunities,” Kress wrote.  Boise State, Wyoming, Utah State and Nevada forfeited a total of seven matches against SJSU this season.  Kress said each of those forfeits resulted in the team’s players, coaches and staffers receiving “appalling, hateful messages.” “Sadly, others who for years have played this same team without incident chose not to play us this season. To be clear, we did not celebrate a single win by forfeiture. Instead, we braced for the fallout. Each forfeiture announcement unleashed appalling, hateful messages individuals chose to send directly to our student-athletes, our coaching staff and many associated with our program,” Kress wrote.  The coach, in just his second season with the team, admitted it was one of the toughest seasons of his life.  “This has been one of the most difficult seasons I’ve ever experienced, and I know this is true as well for many of our players and the staff who have been supporting us all along. Maintaining our focus on the court and ensuring the overall safety and well-being of my players amid the external noise have been my priorities,” Kress said.  Kress was named in a lawsuit filed by team co-captain Brooke Slusser and several other Mountain West players against the conference and San Jose State. The lawsuit alleges Kress has communicated with a private lawyer as part of his effort to get Slusser removed from the team and has told others he has filed Title IX complaints against Slusser based not on comments Slusser has made in practice, but on communications Slusser has made to the media and in public forums concerning her beliefs. Slusser has also alleged the university has threatened to take away her scholarship for speaking on the issues of sharing a team, locker room and bedroom with transgender teammate Blaire Fleming.  Still, Kress thanked Slusser in his statement Saturday, along with Fleming and the other seniors on the team.  “Our team played their hearts out today, the way they have done all season. I want to recognize and thank our seniors — Alessia [Buffagni], Chandler [Manusky], Brooke [Bryant], Brooke and Blaire — for their tremendous efforts on the court all season long. They have all helped us to get where we are,” Kress wrote.  Kress also thanked San Jose State University Police Chief Michael Carroll for his work protecting the team from potential threats this season.  A San Jose State spokesperson previously confirmed to Fox News Digital that the program did not formally notify any of the opponents on its schedule of the situation involving Fleming and Slusser ahead of matches this season after Slusser joined her first lawsuit against the NCAA in September over her trans teammate’s presence.  However, that spokesperson also confirmed the university did coordinate police protection for the players with the schools that hosted the team’s away matches after security measures had to be elevated due to the attention the team was getting.  When Southern Utah became the first program to announce it would be forfeiting a match against the Spartans in early September, that was the first indicator of heightened security. That’s when the college brought in armed security. A San Jose State University spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital the volleyball team was told it would be getting added security of some kind after the first forfeit by an opposing program as news of Slusser’s lawsuit spread. Shortly after the first forfeit, the university’s in-house police department was alerted to the situation and got involved. Police protection was assigned for every game thereafter, and police departments at other campuses were assigned to protect the team when it traveled.  Police presence was noticeably strong for the Spartans’ first meeting against eventual conference champion Colorado State Oct. 3. Multiple officers were photographed on the court that night, looking alert in the stands, entrances and at the players.  Slusser previously told Fox News Digital she had received a warning from a teammate Oct. 2, the night before a match, to “stay away” during the match because something “bad” was going to happen to her.  San Jose State University responded to questions about whether federal investigators had been involved.  “The university has asked students and staff to share all concerning communications with UPD to be evaluated and addressed appropriately, including in conjunction with proper authorities where appropriate,” San Jose State said in a previous statement. And Kress was tasked with coaching his team through all of it. Kress is not the coach who recruited Fleming to SJSU. That was former head coach Trent Kersten, who left the program after Fleming’s first season in San Jose State in 2022.  A lawsuit that includes former Spartans assistant coach Melissa Batie-Smoose alleges Kersten recruited Fleming knowing the player was transgender but didn’t tell other players.  Kress took over the program in 2023 and expressed frustration with Kersten’s decision in an interview with OutKick. “My frustration with Trent is an unfortunate situation,” Kress said. “[Kersten] obviously knows Blaire is in the crosshairs of this debate, and yet he has not reached out to [Fleming] one time to check in on [Fleming’s] mental health. I find it sad, to be honest.” Before that, Kress suggested tension in the locker room because of Fleming’s presence on the team and Slusser’s lawsuits “might not be a bad thing.”  “Sometimes tension is not necessarily a bad thing, and I’m not saying that there is. But, you know, when you do have tension or you do have confrontations, I mean, I’m a person that believes that, from confrontation, good things usually happen. We settle our differences, and we work through it,” Kress told reporters Oct. 3 after the first Colorado State match.  “The last thing that I would want is there’s the white elephant in the room, and there is no tension, we don’t address it, and we never move past it, right? So I think there may be tension, but it dies. If we’re in a meeting room and there’s tension, it dies there. If there’s tension on the court, it dies there. We really don’t let the boundaries cross over, and that’s how I think we’ve been so successful thus far.” Now the Spartans’ tournament run is over. The players made it through unharmed. But the lawsuits continue."

Against the Jaguars, rookie wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr. had just two catches for 22 yards.  Two weeks ago, Commanders star Terry McLaurin had just one reception for ten yards.  CeeDee Lamb had no luck against the Eagles’ quarterbacks, too, with six catches for just 21 yards.  Flowers’ receiving yards over/under is sitting at 58.5 (-115, DraftKings Sportsbook), which is a tick below his season average (65.75), but this is his toughest task yet.  Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson has been spreading the ball around more in recent weeks as well, which is also working against Flowers on Sunday.  After receiving nine or more targets in five of his first eight games, Flowers hasn’t had more than eight targets in his last four as tight end Mark Andrews recovers from a dreadful start and the team added Diontae Johnson at the trade deadline.  Bet Flowers to have a quiet day on Sunday.  The play: Zay Flowers less than 58.5 receiving yards (-115, DraftKings Sportsbook)"

Stephanie Otey of 97.1 The Fan took to social media in the immediate aftermath, detailing in a video shared on X that “cops came out and started pepper spraying” everywhere. “I got nailed in the eyes,” Otey said in the clip as she held a tissue. Warning: Explicit language Otey’s video then panned to the chaotic scene at midfield, including the moment she appeared to get hit with the pepper spray as the camera went dark. “I don’t know where it came from, but there was a lot of chaos,” Otey said. “First time being pepper sprayed, right in my eyes.” In a statement shared by Ohio State University Police on X Saturday afternoon, “Following the game, officers from multiple law enforcement agencies assisted in breaking up an on-field altercation,” and that “during the scuffle, multiple officers representing Ohio and Michigan deployed pepper spray.” “OSUPD is the lead agency for games & will continue to investigate,” the statement concluded. The wild scene broke out Saturday moments after Michigan players attempted to plant their flag on Ohio State’s logo after the Wolverines upset the No. 2 Buckeyes.  Michigan players were captured on the broadcast with teary eyes on the sideline. In a follow-up video message shared later on Saturday, Otey said she was “fine” and reflected on the experience of reporting from the chaos. “What an experience to get pepper sprayed and to be in a quarrel like that. Honestly, it’s like a reporter’s dream to be part of those kind of games,” she said.  “Nope, I’m good. It hurt at first. I was more scared that I couldn’t see, as you could hear when the video was still rolling, but I was more so concerned my vision. And then when people said, ‘Oh, it was pepper spray,’ that’s when I felt the pain of it all. But yeah, I felt better pretty quick, recovered and then we got to the postgame. … We’re all good, kind of pumped about that experience, it was thrilling and chaotic, but that’s the game for you guys.” The mayhem in Ohio was just one of the fiery scenes that erupted across the college football landscape during Rivalry Week, with brawls breaking out over flag planting during a number of contests."

Lou essentially adopted Dave and was a surrogate father to him. Lou Carnesecca was a special man beyond the BB court. RIP.” ESPN college basketball analyst Dick Vitale wrote, in part, that Carnesecca was “one of a kind.” Fox Sports’ John Fanta added, “You cannot tell the story of college basketball — of the Big East — of NYC hoops — without Looie, who was St. John’s. 526 wins in 24 years. Never had a losing season. 1985 Final Four. 2-time National [Coach of the Year award winner]. All-time personality.” Ed Cooley, head coach of the Red Storm’s Big East rival at Georgetown, shared, “Sending condolences from our Hoya Family to those nearest and dearest to Coach Lou Carnesecca and St. John’s Basketball. One of the pioneers of the BIG EAST Conference — he is synonymous with this great league and will be truly missed by all in the basketball world.” Fans who came up watching Carnesecca’s championship-winning teams honored the late coach as well.  “I know we can’t live forever but I feel a piece of me dies whenever an icon from my youth dies,” one wrote. “The early days of the Big East were the best. They had the best teams, rivalries, and coaches. Those coaches felt like uncles to me growing up.” “RIP to Lou Carnesecca,” shared another. “As a kid, the first college basketball team I gravitated to were the late 80s and early 90s St. John’s teams, because I got to watch their games on Ch. 9 in NY, coached by LC. He is not only a St. John’s legend but a Big East legend.” After leading the Red Storm for 24 seasons and a brief stint behind the bench of the then-Long Island Nets, Carnesecca retired from coaching in 1992.  He returned home to St. John’s soon thereafter, keeping an office on the Queens campus and serving as an assistant to the university president.  He was a fixture at Red Storm basketball games until 2022.  Carnesecca, who would have turned 100 years old on Jan. 5, is survived by wife Mary and daughter Enes."

As Wolverines coach Sherrone Moore celebrated with players and waved toward the crowd with just over 20 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, Johnson, who called the game for Fox, said the first-year head coach’s name and then added, “We didn’t cheat this time.” While Johnson didn’t mention Stalions by name, he seemingly referred to the sign-stealing scandal that overshadowed the Michigan program during their run to the national championship last season. Stalions, a former Michigan staffer, was suspended by the program and ultimately resigned in November 2023 after being accused of orchestrating the in-person scheme. At the time, Moore served as former head coach Jim Harbaugh’s offensive coordinator and offensive line coach and became the Wolverines’ interim head coach for their final three games of the regular season — including a victory over the Buckeyes — when Harbaugh was suspended three games as a result of the sign-stealing investigation. When Harbaugh left to become the Chargers’ head coach in the offseason, Michigan hired Moore to serve as his replacement, with the effects of the scandal still lingering as Stalions resurfaced as the defensive coordinator of Mumford High School in Detroit. Michigan defeated the No. 2 Buckeyes for their fourth consecutive victory in the series, though the afternoon took a scary turn when a brawl broke out after the Wolverines attempted to plant a flag on the Ohio Stadium field — one of four flag-related scuffles that occurred Saturday. Police officers attempting to break out the fight appeared to pepper spray players, while Ohio State head coach Ryan Day defended his “prideful guys” who weren’t going to let Michigan players plant a flag. “I don’t know all the details of it, but I know these guys are looking to put a flag on our field and our guys weren’t gonna let that happen,” Day told reporters. “I’ll find out exactly what happened, but this is our field. We certainly were embarrassed of the fact that we lost the game, but there’s some prideful guys on this team that weren’t just gonna let that happen.” The Wolverines, which used a one-yard touchdown run by Kalel Mullings and two field goals to secure the upset, improved to 7-5, while the Buckeyes, after missing out on a chance to play in the Big Ten championship game, will await their College Football Playoff fate."

The Chargers have a few factors working against them in this spot.  First, they are at a massive rest disadvantage with the Falcons coming off a bye and Los Angeles having lost Monday to the Ravens.  Second, they are traveling east for this 10 a.m. PST kickoff. In picking against the Chargers last week, we noted how their stats seem to have been inflated by an easy schedule.  In their past two games, the Bengals and Ravens have scored a combined 57 points against them, and Baltimore rushed for 212 yards Monday.  Atlanta’s rushing attack is one of the most potent in the NFL and stopping a fresh Bijan Robinson may be quite tough.  The Falcons also should be the more desperate team after awful losses to the Saints and Broncos. The Browns had their feel-good moment of the season Thursday, but the vibes won’t continue in the Mile High City.  Denver is a historically tough place to play and Jameis Winston throwing against an opportunistic Broncos defense seems like a mismatch.  Nick Chubb also seemingly is a step slower compared to the past while he works his way back from injury. The Broncos, meanwhile, have an ascending rookie quarterback in Bo Nix who is playing quite well, and Denver should feed off a home crowd that hasn’t seen a meaningful game in some time.  Let’s remember that in Winston’s last road start, the Browns could not keep pace with a mediocre-at-best Saints team in a 35-14 defeat.  Denver is also one of the NFL’s best against the spread with a 9-3 mark, including a 4-1 stretch. Last week: 2-0. Eagles (W), Ravens (W) Season: 9-15. Matt Ehalt has been picking against the spread since his childhood days when he entered his father’s newspaper pool and even took the top prize on more than one occasion. He specializes in NFL wagers and is quite successful with NCAA brackets."

Heading into this week 13 contest at East Rutherford’s MetLife Stadium, Aaron Rodgers, Davante Adams and co. are languishing near the bottom of the AFC East with a 3-8 record. Most recently, they blew a 17-16 third-quarter lead and lost a 28-27 heartbreaker to Anthony Richardson and the Colts. To combat their woes, the Jets have offloaded head coach Robert Saleh and general manager Joe Douglas. What comes next for the franchise with the aging quarterback is yet to be seen. On the other side of the gridiron, Mike Macdonald’s Seahawks have won back-to-back games, muscling their way to a respectable 6-5 and the top spot in the middle-of-the-pack-heavy NFC West. Their last two victories came at the hands of sturdy divisional rivals, the Cardinals and 49ers. What may be most notable of all about this matchup though is that this is former Jets quarterback’s Geno Smith’s first game against his old team at MetLife Stadium. When the two clubs last met in January 2023, the Seahawks won 23-6 at Lumen Field. Below, check out everything you need to know to tune into the game, from start time and channel, to how to watch for free. Kickoff for the Jets vs. Seahawks is set for 1 p.m. ET today, Dec. 1.

Reed The return of Geno Smith is the major subplot to this week’s game. Smith has not faced the Jets at MetLife Stadium since he left following the 2016 season.  The 2013 second-round pick of the Jets has reinvented himself in Seattle over the past three years and now returns as the No. 2 passing yards leader in the NFL with 3,035 yards. “I’ve always had tremendous love and respect for that organization,” Smith said. “Obviously, the team that drafted me, gave me a chance out of the gate. A lot of great people there. Some people that I was there with, a lot of those people are now gone. “So as far as the whole revenge thing, that’s not on my mind.” The Jets defense has not had its best season. Gardner has struggled and the unit gave up a game-winning drive to the Colts in the previous game. Reed has had a strong season, but the Jets are going to need a better effort against Smith than they’ve shown lately. “Man, he is, I don’t know what not to say about him, he’s got excellent mobility,” Jets interim coach Jeff Ulbrich said of the Seattle QB. “He’s killing people with his feet at times, he’s got the ability to extend plays, he’s way more athletic than you think when he moves around, and he makes the off-platform stuff go. He can make every throw.” Much of the Jets organization has turned its eyes to 2025 with a search for a new GM and coach already underway.  The players and coaches are left to play out these final six games.  I think the Jets will keep this close until the fourth quarter, when Geno Smith throws a game-clinching touchdown. Seahawks 30, Jets 20  Rejuvenated Rodgers: The bye week stirred up plenty of speculation about the future of Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and whether injuries have affected his play.  Rodgers, who turns 41 on Monday, said he is unsure if he wants to play in 2025 but if he does, his first choice would be the Jets. As for his health, Rodgers was not on the injury report this week for the first time since Week 4. He has recovered from the hamstring, knee and ankle injuries that plagued him in October.  Rodgers has had a disappointing season but is still hoping to get something out of these final six weeks. “I’m going to enjoy them,” Rodgers said. “Obviously, the future is unknown for a lot of us, but yeah, I have a lot of pride in this game — when I take the field, when I go to practice. So I’ll be excited about being out there with the guys and finish off strong.” Leaping Leonard: Geno Smith is not the only former Jets early draft pick to be returning to MetLife Stadium this week.  Leonard Williams, the Jets’ first-round pick in 2015, is coming back to MetLife as a Seahawk. Williams spent his first 4 ¹/₂ seasons with the Jets then played at MetLife for the Giants before being traded to Seattle last season.  Williams had a huge game last week against the Cardinals with 2.5 sacks. “He’s been a game wrecker for a long time in this league, and when he turns it on, he is as impressive as they get,” Jets passing game coordinator Todd Downing said. “So, we’re going to have to have a plan for him. He’s playing at a high level with a lot of energy and certainly yesterday that jumped off the tape.” Point of no return: The Jets spent a portion of the bye week studying the issues that have held them back this season.  One of the areas they identified that needed improvement was in their return game — both on kickoffs and punts. They have gotten very little from returner Xavier Gipson this season and are trying to find ways to get more explosiveness.

Smith-Njigba has become a focal point of the Seahawks offense in recent weeks and has had some monster games. He had 180 receiving yards and two touchdowns against the Rams three weeks ago and scored a touchdown against the Cardinals last week. “No. 11 has been coming alive the past few games especially,” Jets cornerback D.J.

Then again, what GM, coach, player or fan isn’t at this point of the year, before game results start to count? But Daoust’s excitement is not rooted in blind optimism alone.  An eventful past few months for New York’s Professional Women’s Hockey League team has set it up for better success in its sophomore season, which begins this weekend. Not only do the Sirens have a team name — and, perhaps more importantly, an established identity for fans to rally around — but they also boast a new star player, new coach and new home arena. “We are writing our brand new [Sirens chapter] with a new environment,” Daoust said this week. “It’s on us to get that page to be as great as we want it to be.” If there was any consolation for New York’s dud of a debut campaign during the PWHL’s inaugural season, it was the rights to the No. 1 pick in the draft.  The Sirens selected former Princeton star Sarah Fillier, who dazzled for the Canadian Olympic gold-winning team in 2022. The Sirens also moved on from Howie Draper and hired former college coach Greg Fargo, who has a knack for player development as shown in his 12 years at Colgate, where he launched the Raiders program into national prominence. The Sirens also finally have a place to call home at Prudential Center and have been practicing at a training facility that’s just eight miles away. All the offseason changes have led to entering training camp early this month with a “totally fresh take on the season ahead,” team captain Micah Zandee-Hart said. “I’m really looking forward to the year ahead,” she said. “There’s an energy about our group. Obviously, yeah, we’re motivated to do better than we did last year, and I think every team in the league is motivated to win a championship. But overall, we’re just focusing on the day-to-day right now to be prepared for Dec. 1.” The Sirens started the league’s inaugural 2023-24 season well, winning four straight games before sputtering to a last-place finish in the PWHL standings with a 5-4-3-12 record. Forward Alex Carpenter and defender Ella Shelton were two of the more reliable skaters.  Carpenter scored a team-high eight goals and tied for second-most points in the league with 23.  Shelton, the No. 4 pick of the 2023 draft, recorded 21 points (seven goals, 14 assists). Goaltender Corinne Schroeder held up as well as she could in the crease, but a porous defense didn’t provide much help.  Schroeder posted a .930 save percentage while facing a league-high 34 shots per game. It also probably didn’t help that New York bounced between three locations for home games.  They played in Bridgeport, Conn., at UBS Arena in Belmont Park, home of the NHL’s Islanders, and at Prudential Center.  The different home venues may have been part of the reason the Sirens averaged 2,496 fans in the 12 games they hosted.  The team being based at a training facility in Connecticut also led to players sometimes driving two-plus hours to games. The constant movement between arenas in different states diluted home-ice advantage, Zandee-Hart said.

					Never miss a story.				 That won’t be the case this time around.  Essex County Codey Arena, the former practice facility for the New Jersey Devils, is the Sirens home base this season and all home games will be played at Prudential Center. “It [takes] a ton of energy traveling that players had to go through last season that they won’t have to do this year,” Daoust said. “So this is a huge improvement. We’re giving them the best environment to perform. And it’s on us, and it’s on them, to make sure that we reach our full potential.” Added Zandee-Hart: “I can notice it in our team — just everyone has a calmer presence and is kind of excited to build their routines out and have somewhere that we can call home.” Over the past few weeks, Daoust has become increasingly more comfortable with the team’s depth and versatility, but he knows there’s plenty of work to be done still. “Having all the ingredients on the table doesn’t mean that your recipe will play the best,” Daoust said. “You need to cook, and you need to taste, and you need to make sure that you’re going to have the best meal. But it doesn’t mean that [if] you mix all the ingredients it will give you the best meal. It’s on them to accept a role, to accept the mission, to roll and to push and to walk and to pull in the same direction, and we’ll see which group can do that.” The Sirens are scheduled to start their season Sunday against the defending champion Minnesota Frost.  New York’s home opener is set for Dec. 18 against the Toronto Sceptres. Games will be more accessible for fans to watch at home after the Sirens inked a deal with MSG Networks to broadcast their games. “We’re really excited,” Zandee-Hart said. “Every year is a new year, especially in our league. … [We’re looking forward to] what we can do to be the best we can be this year.”"

The NFL’s best feel-good story has taken a turn for the worse. The Jayden Daniels-led Commanders have dropped three straight, including an embarrassing loss to Cooper Rush’s Cowboys on Sunday.  Those who plugged Washington in as a shoo-in playoff team may have gotten ahead of themselves after what looked like perhaps the best offense in the league has taken a big step back in recent weeks, following a longtime second-half trend for offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury. The Titans defense, which quietly has been one of the best in the NFL, should be able to take advantage. Tennessee ranks 11th in defensive DVOA and 8th in DVOA against the rush.  With Austin Ekeler likely out with a concussion and Brian Robinson Jr. banged up, the Commanders will have to rely on Daniels’ arm, which has been shaky since his rib injury a few weeks ago. The Panthers may be … competent? Carolina has won two of its past three games and very nearly pulled off the upset of the season against the Chiefs on Sunday before losing on a walk-off field goal.  Bryce Young had perhaps his best game of the season against the vaunted Kansas City defense, throwing for 263 yards and a touchdown without an interception. He’ll have it much easier against the Buccaneers, who, despite holding the lowly Giants to just seven points last week, have had a hard time slowing opposing offenses down this season. Oddsmakers are still pricing the Panthers as one of the league’s worst teams while their most recent play places them in the merely mediocre category. ‘ Playing in their fourth straight home game, the Panthers haven’t had to travel in a month, to boot. Look for Young to keep this game close. Last: 1-1. Cardinals (L), Broncos (W) Season: 2-6."

First, he was utterly right that ”nobody would give a damn” about the cost if the Knicks win a championship. Wiping away a 52-year drought grants sweeping immunity — even for ownership — and we appreciate Hart’s ambition even if a title feels today like pipe-dreaming with the Celtics still roaming the Eastern Conference. But what Hart got wrong was dismissing the draft picks sent to the Nets as just “five 12th-graders.” For a very long time, those were much more than theoretical rookies in high school. Just ask any Knick fan old enough to remember Kurt Rambis’ Twitter likes (note: Rambis said he was hacked). Those picks were hope for Donovan Mitchell, Joel Embiid, Dame Lillard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Zion Williamson, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis. They were either the best reasons to believe the Knicks can get over the top for real title contention under Leon Rose, or the best reasons to believe the franchise could recover in the dark days of the late 2010s."

Every game, every week. Failure to do so will result in the additional punishment of reviewing each and every snap from the first 12 games from this season, heretofore referred to as “The Dirty Dozen.’’ There is almost no conceivable way that what has been bad will not get worse, as able-bodied players such as Dexter Lawrence — the biggest-bodied and most able of them all — and promising rookie tight end Theo Johnson are now lost for the remainder of the season.

Filip Chytil was back in the lineup for the first time since colliding with K’Andre Miller in the win over the Sharks on Nov. 14.  The Czech center, who was cleared of a concussion by specialists in New York, missed seven straight games with an unidentified upper-body injury. “It’s not easy when you’re feeling good out there and then you miss two weeks and you have to jump back,” the 25-year-old said after the game. “But I think every shift I was feeling better. Now, just need to keep going like that. I want to be healthy for the rest of the season.” Declining to get into his feelings on evading another head injury, Chytil simply left it at the fact that it wasn’t an easy time and he’s happy to be back. Chytil noted there was no set date for his return.  He and the Rangers took everything day by day, he said, until he felt 100 percent ready to go back into the lineup. “I know my body, I know what’s going on — even with my head,” said Chytil, who missed 72 of 82 regular-season games last season with what is believed to be the fourth concussion of his eight-year NHL career. “I know what I went through last year. It’s been hard. [There’s] been hard moments. I say all the time, I’m staying positive in every situation. When there is an opportunity to be back and my whole body feels great, I jump back in. I’m happy, after two weeks, I could play today.” Additionally, Chris Kreider played his first game since the Rangers’ four-game road trip, after dealing with back spasms. With the returns of Chytil and Kreider, Reilly Smith and Jonny Brodzinski were bumped from the lineup.  Smith, who the Rangers gave up a 2025 fifth-round pick and a 2027 second-rounder to acquire this past summer, served as a healthy scratch for the first time in his New York tenure. The personnel changes were presumably only part of the reasoning for head coach Peter Laviolette’s major lineup shake-up.

As was the case for a nine-game stretch earlier this season, Adam Edstrom, Sam Carrick and Jimmy Vesey made up the fourth line.

The team announced last week that it had begun the process of searching for a new GM and head coach by hiring The 33rd team, led by Mike Tannenbaum and Rick Spielman.  It feels like ownership has turned its eyes to 2025. But there are still six games left in this season. The players and coaches now must find a way to stay motivated at 3-8 with the playoffs still mathematically, but not realistically, possible.  That begins with a visit from the Seahawks, who are 6-5 and in first place in the NFC West. It feels like old friend Geno Smith and the Seahawks have everything to play for while the Jets are just playing out the string.  But they insisted this week that the locker room is still motivated. “I’ve felt zero, any human being, not a single individual on this team deviating from staying engaged, preparing at the highest level,” interim coach Jeff Ulbrich said. “The energy has been good. The detail has been good. The approach has been amazing, but it’s been amazing I felt like this entire time. The process has been right. The results have not been right.  “This is the week.” The Jets have lost seven of their past eight games in this disappointing season — including a heartbreaker in the final minute to the Colts two weeks ago before the bye week.  They have spent that time off searching for answers about what went wrong. The Jets have lost five straight against the Seahawks, with their last win over Seattle coming in 2004. “Listen, I mean, when you win, everything’s better, so, if we win this one, thing are going to get better, and get the next one things will feel better. But this is the hardest part at this point in the season when things have been slipping away the last few weeks,” quarterback Aaron Rodgers said. “This comes down to guys being motivated, you can inspire guys, [Ulbrich] can put up a great quote, or give us a great message, or we can have a great talk Saturday night, but in the end it comes down to guys being motivated individually, and then just wanting to play for something bigger than themselves, and hope we all do that.”"
"NY Post Sports – Latest News, Scores, Stats & Videos",Precious Achiuwa on final hurdle he must clear to return to Knicks’ lineup,https://nypost.com/2024/12/01/sports/precious-achiuwa-on-final-hurdle-he-must-clear-to-return-to-knicks-lineup/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 04:49:06 -0500","Six weeks after Precious Achiuwa was shelved with a hamstring strain, the backup big broke his silence and revealed the final hurdle before his return.","CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Six weeks after Precious Achiuwa was shelved with a hamstring strain, the backup big broke his silence and revealed the final hurdle before his long-awaited return. “I need to get to that point where I’m able to build confidence with myself again,” Achiuwa said after collecting his 19th straight DNP in Friday’s Knicks victory over the Hornets. “I’m an explosive player. For me to be able to explode, I’m going to have to build that confidence.” Achiuwa, who was ruled out for Sunday’s game against New Orleans, said he doesn’t know when that will happen, but he’s practicing full contact and remains “day to day.”  After Sunday, the Knicks play at home Tuesday (Orlando), Thursday (Charlotte) and Saturday (Detroit). “Once I get to that point where I feel like I’m optimal to play, I’ll be out there playing,” Achiuwa said. The recovery has taken longer than the Knicks originally indicated.  Achiuwa, 25, suffered the strain in the preseason finale on Oct. 18, and was given a “2-4 week” window before reevaluation. It was the only official update or timeline provided by the Knicks until coach Tom Thibodeau said Achiuwa was cleared to practice during last week’s road trip. “I mean, it’s been a very long process,” Achiuwa said. “It’s tough. Any player would want to be out there playing, especially seeing the game and knowing there’s things that you probably could do out there. That’s the toughest part of this.” In Achiuwa’s absence, the Knicks (11-8) have mostly utilized an eight-man rotation that leaned heavily on the starters with Jericho Sims as the lone frontcourt reserve.  Achiuwa is more of a power forward than a center and, unlike Sims, elicits the confidence from Thibodeau to be in the same lineups as Karl-Anthony Towns. His presence might help with the glaring issues protecting the rim that are occurring with Towns at center.  Achiuwa led the Knicks last season in blocks per 36 minutes at 1.7 — which was even higher than averages for Mitchell Robinson or Isaiah Hartenstein. Achiuwa, who can also knock down an occasional 3-pointer, was one of the better Knicks performers in preseason before his injury. “I think one of my biggest gifts is defensive versatility, being able to guard multiple positions 1-through-5,” Achiuwa said. “For me, coming back, we’re already probably the best offense in the league right now. So how can I add onto the team on the defensive end and being able to make us elite on that side? I think we do have the potential to be elite defensively.” The Knicks entered the weekend at No. 24 in defensive rating, according to NBA.com, which would represent the worst finish since Thibodeau took over the team.

Sims boasts the team’s top individual defensive rating, a testament to his ability to guard on the perimeter and at least partially because he never shares the court with Towns. Offensively, however, Sims is limited exclusively to screening and dunking.  The 26-year-old said recently that he’s capable of more but understands it’s not his role. “Growing up, I’ve done different things. I’m a pro basketball player and I think that’s what people tend to forget,” Sims said. “Guys can do certain things that maybe they aren’t exposed to as much throughout the game because that’s not their role at the time. So that’s all it is. “Obviously, our offense is already really good, so me coming in, my mentality is just to work as hard as I can and check off all the boxes and knock down my assignments and whatnot, whether that’s defensively or getting guys open,” Sims added. “I like to set hard screens for [Brunson] when he’s in the game.”Achiuwa and Sims are both free agents after the season."
"NY Post Sports – Latest News, Scores, Stats & Videos",College football brawls break out during Rivalry Week over flag-planting celebration: ‘Causing too many problems’,https://nypost.com/2024/12/01/sports/college-football-brawls-ignite-during-rivalry-week-over-flag-planting-celebration/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 04:44:44 -0500",College football descended into chaos Saturday night when several winning teams attempted to plant a flag in the middle of their opponent's fields during Rivalry Week.,"College football descended into chaos Saturday night when several winning teams attempted to plant a flag in the middle of their opponent’s fields during Rivalry Week. The postgame on-field antics ignited mass brawls — and forced police to use pepper spray to contain the flood of athletes and coaches converging onto the field — while broadcasters pleaded that university officials ban the controversial taunt. The chaos quickly unfolded after Michigan’s 13-10 upset over No. 2 Ohio State. Michigan edge rusher Derrick Moore attempted to plant the Wolverines’ flag into the Buckeye’s “Block O” logo but was intercepted by Ohio State linebacker Jack Sawyer, who ripped the flag away as tensions flared between the two schools. Several players were knocked to the ground during pushing and shoving as others tried to quell the mayhem. Columbus police officers deployed pepper spray, striking several players and leaving them wincing in discomfort. The Fox Sports broadcast caught Wolverines Tavierre Dunlap and Jason Hewlett on the sideline with tearing eyes after apparently being pepper sprayed by police officers on the field. Ohio State head coach Ryan Day backed his team after the loss, saying their frustration came from their pride. “I don’t know all the details of it, but I know these guys are looking to put a flag on our field and our guys were not gonna let that happen,” Day said. “I’ll find out exactly what happened, but this is our field. We certainly were embarrassed of the fact that we lost the game, but there’s some prideful guys on this team that weren’t just gonna let that happen.” Michigan running back Kalel Mullings called the Ohio State players “classless” for getting involved with their celebrations after the game. UNC head coach Mack Brown’s swan song at Chapel Hill was anything but a peaceful farewell. Following the Wolfpack’s 35-30 victory over their instate rival, the teams met at midfield where orderly gamesmanship initially took place as Brown was greeted by several NC State players and his counterpart head coach Dave Doeren. Brown embraced NC State’s Kevin Concepcion and Hollywood Smothers while their teammate defensive end Davin Vann took the wolf head-adorned flag from a cheerleader on the sideline and looked to skewer it into the field at Kenan Memorial Stadium. UNC wide receiver Tylee Craft did not allow the rival flag to be planted into his home turf, grabbed the red banner and chucked into one of the benches before being shoved. Wolfpack and Tarheel players scuffled for a few minutes before NC State headed over to their loyal fans and celebrated with them as one player waved the controversial flag high above his head in enemy territory. In Tallahassee, the Seminoles’ dismal season ended the way most should’ve seen coming as head coach Mike Norvell confronted Florida’s coach Billy Napier for his players’ antics. After the Gators handed Florida State its tenth loss this year, some players didn’t leave Doak Campbell Stadium quietly. The madness played out as Florida players – celebrating their dominating 31-11 win over their cross-state rival – gathered around midfield as edge rusher George Gumbs Jr. speared the team’s flag into the cheek of the shouting Seminole. Several FSU players including offensive linemen Jeremiah Byers and Julian Armella took exception to the taunting celebration. Byers got in the face of several Gators as Armella attempted to grab the flag, but was met with resistance. Norvell raced across the field, where he got in the face of an apologetic Napier pointing towards midfield telling him off for the controversial flag planting that started the whole ordeal. The Seminoles’ fifth-year head coach was the one to ultimately rip the Florida flag from the midfield logo, and throw it aside. “They got to get rid of this flag planting stuff, this is causing too many problems here, it’s unnecessary,” ESPN broadcaster Rocky Boiman said. Napier apologized for his team’s antics after both sides were separated “Obviously what happened there at the end of the game is not who we want to be as a program,” Napier said. “It’s embarrassing to me and it’s a distraction from a really well-played football game. I want to apologize on behalf of the entire organization just in terms of how we represented the university there. We shouldn’t have done that. We won’t do that moving forward. And there will be consequences for all involved.” Following the Sun Devils’ 49-7 walloping of the Wildcats, Jacob Rich Kongaika planted a pitchfork into the Arizona logo but it was quickly snatched up by Montana Lemonious-Craig. The scuffle only lasted a few seconds, as cooler heads prevailed and separated the players. Other skirmishes broke out during the game at other rivalry games Saturday, including a sideline brawl during the “Iron Bowl” between Auburn and Alabama and punches were thrown between Houston and BYU players after a BYU touchdown.

Sports Collectors Daily,Annual Cincinnati Moeller Card Show Draws Holiday Crowd,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/cincinnati-moeller-november-card-show/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 17:03:52 +0000",The annual Black Friday weekend sports card show in Cincinnati is a holiday tradition with a vintage vibe.,"December 1, 2024 By Rich Mueller  As they’ve done nearly every year since the late 1980s, thousands of Black Friday weekend shoppers flocked to a well-known Ohio high school Friday.  They weren’t tossing credit card big TVs, air fryers or bargain priced clothing here, though.  The currency was mostly cash, the crowd was mostly male, the product was mostly sports cards and not much of what was purchased would be wrapped and put under a tree. After stuffing yourself with turkey and trimmings, the long running Thanksgiving Weekend Card Show at Archbishop Moeller High School in Cincinnati offers a chance to get your fill of sports stuff.  A small roster of former Cincinnati Reds players signed autographs on Saturday and Sunday.  Vintage and modern cards, memorabilia and autographs were piled high inside a gymnasium at the school where Ken Griffey Jr. first made a name for himself (Barry Larkin, Buddy Bell and Doug Williams, too).   The weather had a winter bite to it, with cold and a relentless wind greeting collectors and dealers who made the journey, but within a half hour of the show’s 11 AM Friday opening, the aisles were packed.    “Every Friday is always busy here,” said dealer Jerry Katz, while taking a short break from customers.  “It’s a great mix. It’s a great buying show if you’re into memorabilia. Vintage (cards), new stuff. There’s something for everyone here so the dealers like doing it and we bring a lot of product here because we know it’ll move.”   The show always attracts dealers and collectors, some of whom drive several hours and give up or modify their holiday plans.  Katz came down from the Cleveland area. “I had to find some people who had dinner earlier than later,” he joked after making a nearly four-hour trip. The show had its share of modern cards in slabs and monster boxes full of dollar singles but the content definitely leans more toward the vintage side and has since its inception during the junk wax era.  Collectors make the annual trip to Moeller because they know there will be cards to check off of want lists and some high-end older material they don’t otherwise see at a lot of local shows.  It’s much like the Strongsville show, also held in Ohio each spring. That  is, small enough to not feel overwhelming but big enough to have options.   As he’s done for the last 15 years, Reds fan Brandon Williams of Timeless Sports drove up from Lexington, KY, to make a weekend of buying and selling. He brought brought tobacco cards, 1950s and 60s stars, old programs and pennants, among other things. The Moeller show is one place where he was likely to find some buyers. “I used to come up with a good friend of mine, Tim Imes, who mentored me into this and it was kind of our family tradition,” he explained. “He passed away in 2020 so I kind of kept his legacy going.” Williams caught up with some dealer friends he sees at larger shows and picked up a couple of Ted Kluszewski items for his own collection.  Cincinnati Reds past and present are a popular draw.   “It’s evolved a little bit with the guys who bring newer stuff but there are a lot of familiar faces,” he told SC Daily during a break from helping customers. “That’s what keeps the show strong. “People are here to buy Cobbs and Mathewsons, not so much maybe Elly De La Cruz. They’re here for the good old stuff.” Occasionally people who aren’t active collectors will bring in items to sell to him or one of the dozens of dealers on the floor. Dealer JD Heckathorn sent time looking at cards from one man’s childhood collection of 1950s cards.  Williams recalled one pre-War find from a previous Thanksgiving show.  “One of the most memorable was the 1939 W-711s (a Reds team issue set). A big stack came in and I was almost able to put a set together.” Katz, who spent the spring and summer of 1998 as the public address announcer for the Cleveland Indians, once owned a shop. He still sells cards full-time and has set up at more than 1,000 shows in the last 35 years. “One of these days I’m going to figure out what I’m going to do when I grow up,” he joked. The three-day events can get be a grind but when the crowds are buying, life is good and there are worse things to do than spend a long holiday weekend kidding around with collectors and making some money.

Another 20 requests are going into the mail this week, putting me at 200 sent this year. I’ll come up well short of my initial goal of 300 unless I feel like getting a severe case of carpal tunnel in December. Bob Costas  The preeminent sports broadcasting voice of my era, Costas recently announced he was stepping away from baseball broadcasting. I fully expected my request to take more than a year judging by the response times I had seen online. Costas and I both got our start calling games in different versions of the North American Hockey League 30 years apart, but his career in the booth went significantly better than mine. He signed a pair of 1989 Pro Set cards for me in three months via his New York home. Supplies Surprise: Holiday Gifts for Graphers Last Christmas, I gave you my cards, but the very next day, you traded away,
This year, to save me from tears, I’ll case break with someone special.
–the other guy in Wham, probably It was rare that I got cards for holidays as a kid. Most years I was so busy buying them year-round that I’d ask for everything else at Saturnalia– and that’s when the Lego sets, CDs, and my first guitar came rolling in. But now as an adult, I can always use some things for the collection. Not just cards or autographs since I am very selective about what I need there, but more importantly supplies. There are always things that I never realize I need until I discover that I’ve run out of them– like penny sleeves, stamps, and notebook paper. So if you have a grapher in your life, consider getting them some of the following for the upcoming holiday season. Deck the halls with photo corners…
I go through photo corners like crazy all throughout a season. Whether I’m making a new grapher book, or having a corner break on me in an old book, or needing an extra one so I can place a horizontal card in my book appropriately, these little buggers are always a necessity at some point or another. Sometimes they can be tough to find at the local craft store, so if the grapher you know uses a book with photo corners to hold their cards, get them an extra pack or two of these. Or if you know they need to make a new grapher book soon, get them a few boxes since they’ll use 8 to 18 corners per page. I’ll have a blue (pen) Christmas…
The only thing worse than having no pen is having a non-functioning pen. So it’s good to have a few backups. Blue is still the hobby standard in both Sharpies and ballpoints. I’ve always been a proponent of the Staedtler Lumocolor, but something has changed in their ink formula: they now tend to bleed and bubble on glossy cards when they never did before, and fine-point ones now bleed like crazy on baseballs. So, it’s easier and cheaper to go with Sharpies for photos and (well-prepped) cards, and a standard ballpoint on baseballs. If your collector likes pucks, jerseys, or anything darker, metallic Sharpies and various colors of paint pen are the way to go. Rockin’ around the sorting tray…
I never knew just how convenient sorting trays were until I started organizing cards for spring training last year. I had one that I had picked up for cheap at the local card shop years ago, but I never used it much. But it turns out they really do work well and make sorting go much faster than having to lean over the top of a table or sit uncomfortably on the floor. I’m intrigued by BCW’s modular sorting tray that can expand from as few as six spaces to… well… the sky is the limit. Maybe 26 so the whole alphabet is covered, or 32 so every team in a league has its own space. O envelopes, O envelopes…
Envelopes are the bane of my existence. Even having sent over 3000 TTM’s I still tend to run out at the worst possible moments– such as going out and buying a roll of stamps to send out 50 requests and then realizing I only have 38 #6-3/4 envelopes left. It’s not just the #6-3/4 and #10 envelopes though: having some 6×8 and 8.5×11 are good for getting some photos returned, and of course some larger clasp envelopes or bubble mailers for sending those out to begin with. If your collector does a lot of trading, #00 bubble mailers would be great. I bought a case in 2018 and am still using them now. God rest ye merry catalog…
If you don’t mind spending a couple G’s and have a forklift lying around, get your collector an old library card catalog! This Brobdingnagian thing is a stylish way for them to store several thousand cards in a series of pullout drawers, weighing in at only 500 pounds (empty). Or, if you want to avoid hernias, BCW recently began making a smaller, lighter, and more affordable card catalog, which got the Troy Rutter stamp of approval. Best of all, they’re stackable so you can have yours as small or as large as you wish. Mele toploader-maka…
Spoiler alert: this week Les mentioned 8×10 photo toploaders as a great gift, and I completely agree. But I’ll expand on this: ANY kind of toploaders. Whether for cards, photos, or pennants, I bet the collector in your life burns through these like crazy. Get a few packs in different sizes– basic 3×4 card ones, maybe some of the thicker jersey/patch card ones, even some 3×5, 5×7, 8×10, or 11×14 ones depending on what they collect.

Sports Collectors Daily,Ohtani Petitions To Recover Cards Bought By Former Interpreter With Star’s Money,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/ohtani-petitions-to-recover-cards-bought-by-former-interpreter-with-stars-money/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 14:08:17 +0000","Shohei Ohtani is asking for the baseball cards purchased by his former interpreter, who bought them with money he stole from the Dodgers superstar.","December 1, 2024 By Bob D'Angelo  Shohei Ohtani wants his former interpreter to surrender approximately $325,000 worth of baseball cards to the Los Angeles Dodgers superstar. Ohtani, who won his first World Series title with the Dodgers in October and was a unanimous choice for National League MVP honors this year, filed a petition in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on Nov. 26. In addition to Ippei Mizuhara returning the baseball cards that Ohtani claims were bought with his money, the Dodgers star wants his former employee and friend to return signed baseball cards that were in Mizuhara’s “unauthorized and personal collection.” Mizuhara, of Newport Beach, California, had already pleaded guilty to bank fraud and tax fraud in June after he was accused of stealing approximately $17 million from Ohtani. The latest accusations came after Mizuhara allegedly used Ohtani’s bank account to secure funds, which he then used to buy cards on eBay and Whatnot beginning in January 2024. He was also accused of using the cash to pay medical bills and cover gambling debts to an illegal bookmaker. The complaint stated that Mizuhara was still buying cards through April 2024. Prosecutors alleged that the interpreter bought approximately 1,000 cards, using the alias “Jay Min.” Some of the packages were mailed to Mizuhara in care of the Dodgers, according to court documents reviewed by Sports Collectors Daily. Embed from Getty Images Ohtani asked for a hearing to regain ownership of the sports cards that authorities seized from Mizuhara, The New York Times reported. A judge granted the hearing, which will be held on Dec. 20, according to the newspaper. Mizuhara’s attorney, Michael Freedman, declined to comment on the filing, The Los Angeles Times reported. Mizuhara was fired in March 2024, The New York Times reported. His sentencing in the case involving tax and bank fraud had been set for Dec. 20 but was delayed to Jan. 24, 2025, The New York Times reported. In a declaration filed with the court on Nov. 27, Freedman said that Mizuhara was “in the process” of being evaluated by a forensic psychiatrist, The attorney stated that the psychiatrist was unable to complete the evaluation process before Dec. 6, but added that Mizuhara missed his Nov. 24 appointment due to an illness. In light of the psychiatrist’s schedule and the Thanksgiving holiday, Freedman requested an extension, which was granted. According to the documents filed on Nov. 26, Ohtani, as the petitioner in the case, has a “right, title and/or interest” in the sports cards because they were allegedly bought by Mizuhara using money prosecutors said he stole from the Dodgers’ two-way star. The items described in the petition are “collectible sports cards found in (a) silver and black Panopply case; collectible sports cards found in (a) gray Panopply case; a box containing collectible sports cards; a card wrapping device; and plastic card protectors holders.” In the $17 million fraud case, Mizuhara potentially could be sentenced to as long as 30 years in prison, the Los Angeles Times reported. As a legal permanent resident who owns a green card, Mizuhara also faces deportation to Japan, according to the newspaper. Embed from Getty Images Mizuhara had been with Ohtani for many of the hitting-pitching star’s achievements, according to ESPN. He was Ohtani’s catcher during the Home Run Derby competition during the 2021 All-Star Game and was there when the star signed his record-breaking $700 million, 10-year deal with the Dodgers. His bets to the bookies included wagers on NBA, NFL and college football games, along with international soccer, ESPN reporting. Prosecutors said that Mizuhara never bet on baseball games. The MVP award Ohtani won this year was the third of his career. He also won NL honors in 2023 and was the American League MVP in 2021 when he played for the Los Angeles Angels. Bob has been a sportswriter and copy editor for more than 45 years and a blogger for two decades. He is celebrating his 60th year of card collecting, and still counts his 1965 Topps Mickey Mantle as his favorite.  You can reach him at [email protected].

Sports Collectors Daily,Brothers Give Up Hockey Collection to Help Fallen Officer’s Family,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/grice-hockey-collection-officer-darron-burks/,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 11:19:21 +0000",Two brothers from Colorado have turned their collection of game-used hockey sticks and one very special puck over to Heritage Auctions to raise money for the Assist the Officer Foundation.,"November 27, 2024 By Rich Mueller  Two brothers from Colorado have spent the last several years collecting game-used hockey sticks from some notable NHL players.  Now, they’ve giving them all up to raise money for a fallen police officer. 20-year-old Austin Grice and his 12-year-old sibling Blake have consigned the collection of 19 sticks—14 of which are autographed—to Heritage Auctions, which is offering them in single lots. The sticks include those used by Alex Ovechkin, Peter Forsberg, Patrick Kane, John Tavares, Vladimir Tarasenko and Tukka Rask.  There’s also a puck signed by the late Johnny Gaudreau and it’s that item that was part of what compelled the brothers to sell the sticks.  Gaudreau, a member of the Columbus Blue Jackets, and his brother Matthew were killed while riding their bicycles in Salem County, NJ on August 29.  That same week, Dallas police officer Darron Burks was shot and killed while sitting in his patrol car.  A rookie officer in his first year on the force, Burks had just left his job as a high school math teacher and coach to join the force.  The Rice brothers will donate all proceeds from their items to the Assist the Officer Foundation, which is helping the Burks family.   “The boys went through the hockey stick collection they built, looking for the Johnny Gaudreau stick they knew they had,” recalled their father, Barrie Grice. “Sure enough, they found it, and decided they wanted to sell it to raise money for the police officer, using Johnny and Matthew’s spirits to help another, uniting tragedies in kindness. Brothers honoring brothers.” According to Heritage, “While the acquisition of each of the different items has a unique story behind it, one stick has meant more to the Grice Brothers than any other. When Blake was born, he spent his first month in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) due to his extremely premature birth. During that time, Austin attended a L.A. Kings/Colorado Avalanche game where he was given an autographed, game-used stick from Kings center Anze Kopitar.” Barrie Grice says that stick, too, went into the auction after Blake and Austin decided it was more important to support the charity.  “When Blake was talking to Austin about it on the phone, he asked his brother if he was sure he wanted to give that stick up. Austin responded, ‘There are more important things than a hockey stick, Blake. Like with your birth, the main thing is you are OK and you are here to be my brother. Those families lost people forever. It’s fine. Let’s donate that one, too.” The online auction runs through Dec. 7. Rich is the editor and founder of Sports Collectors Daily.

Sports Collectors Daily,"Dalton Knecht Basketball Cards Exist Thanks to NIL, Instant",https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/dalton-knecht-rookie-cards/,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 11:15:55 +0000","A strong start to his NBA career has the Lakers feeling good and Dalton Knecht basketball cards are generating a buzz, too.","November 27, 2024 By Brendan Cross  The 2023-24 NBA rookie class was loaded. Victor Wembanyama led the way, while secondary names like Amen and Ausar Thompson, Brandon Miller and Scoot Henderson headlined the second tier of rookies. The 2024-25 class is still emerging but one player has Lakers fans–and their superstar–excited.  Dalton Knecht rookie cards will definitely be worth watching in the years to come. Knecht, the 17th overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft, is separating himself from the crowd. The 6’6″ guard/forward is averaging just over 11 points per game as of Nov. 23, but his recent string of performances suggests Knecht could be climbing into stardom soon enough.  Knecht followed up a 27-point game on Nov. 16 at New Orleans with a 37-point output at home against the Jazz. In that game he drained 9 threes while helping lead the Lakers to a 6-point victory. In a postgame interview, LeBron James said he has no idea how Knecht fell to the Lakers at 17. He added that he was grateful Knecht was on the team and that he knew exactly what the Lakers were getting. Collectors are grateful as well. 76ers rookie Jared McCain is near the top of the well-performing rookies list so far, but Knecht is neck-and-neck with him.  2024-25 NBA trading card products will make their way to market soon enough but here are 5 of Knecht’s earliest cards. 2023-24 Bowman U NOW  
Knecht had a pair of Bowman U NOW cards while he was a Tennessee Volunteer. Bowman U Now is the collegiate version of Topps NOW. Cards are only available for 24 hours on the Topps website and lucky collectors who ordered a card had a random chance at receiving a numbered parallel. The total print run of the shooting picture (#30 in the series) is 919 while the print run of the dunking card (#60) is 999. The base versions aren’t actually serial numbered, but these cards will also be some of his most rare, considering less than 1,000 were made of each. Ninety numbered parallels, including a Gold 1/1, are part of those print runs. 2023-24 Bowman U Chrome #48  The Bowman U Chrome brand has been a popular addition to the Topps lineup in the last few years. For collectors who love prospecting outside of baseball, collegiate basketball and football athletes now have true Bowman autographs before they make the pros. There are numerous parallel versions on the base card along with the autographed versions. Base non-auto versions of this card are selling for $5-$10 but a PSA 10 Yellow Refractor Auto numbered to 75 sold for $1,275 on November 21. 2023-24 Bowman U Chrome Sapphire  Chrome, but make it Sapphire. Collectors love the gleaming blue Sapphire version of nearly every chrome product, so it should come as no shock that 2023-24 Bowman U Chrome also has a Sapphire release. Knecht does not have any autographs in this set, but there is still a full parallel rainbow that can be put together. A PSA 10 sold for $100 on November 23 while a raw Gold Sapphire Refractor parallel sold for $158.50 on November 23. Standard base versions have been bringing $30 and more. 2023-24 Bowman U Best 
Initially, 2023-24 Bowman U Best did not release to the same fanfare as its Chrome counterpart, but the design of the product is so striking and different that it will standout it any collection. Knecht has base cards and autographs here with parallel autographs numbered to /125 and lower. The pictured raw Refractor Auto /125 sold for a whopping $450 on November 22. 2024 Panini Instant Draft Night 
For now, Panini still has the NBA licensing rights, making this 2024 Panini Instant Draft Night card Knecht’s first true NBA rookie card. While he isn’t wearing a Lakers jersey, he is sporting a Lakers hat and the card itself has the Lakers logo on it.  The print-on-demand cards are only available for a short time and the total print run for Knecht’s card is just 512. There were also several different numbered parallels that collectors could buy for a higher price via Panini and those who did are feeling pretty good right now. Collectors on eBay are scooping these up as they realize that Knecht’s first true rookie card is in fairly short supply.   Raw versions of the base card have been selling in the $150 range while a Jungle parallel /25 sold for $511 on November 21.  Since Knecht has exploded on the scene, Panini has also produced some official Knecht rookie cards via Instant including one from his NBA debut.  Brendan Cross is a freelance journalist with a degree from San Jose State. A lifelong sports fanatic, his love of cards really blossomed in 2012 with the first release of Panini Prizm. He’s been hooked ever since, and he loves writing about it.

Replay Sports Cards has launched a campaign “to inspire the next generation of sports card collectors.” Kicking off during the holiday season, Replay Gives Back aims to donate one million cards to kids across the country. Collectors can donate cards at any of the company’s three shops in Charlotte, NC, Mt. Pleasant, SC and Boca Raton, FL.  The company says the cards will then be sorted into packs that will be distributed to young people through partnerships with local organizations, many of whom may have no access to cards.  “Our passion for sports card collecting goes beyond the cards themselves—it’s about the joy, connection and the fond memories that come with them,” says Brent Schepel, co-founder of Replay Sports Cards. The first distribution is planned for the days leading up to Christmas. Mike Weinberger, co-founder and president of the company’s franchising efforts says the program “is the beginning of a long-term effort to bring smiles to kids through the universal love of sports.

Some are already underway.,"November 26, 2024 By Rich Mueller  While we may not be into standing in line at 5 AM, waiting for the department or electronics store to open Friday morning, collectors have never been above a good hunt for Black Friday deals on sports cards, supplies or memorabilia.   Your local shop might be having an event but there are plenty of online deals to be had, too, no matter your interest.  Black Friday has become Black Friday Week in some cases, with promotions already underway. And yes, many will extend into Cyber Monday and beyond. While this is undoubtedly not an  all-encompassing list, here are some sales we know are happening across the landscape.  Happy hunting. eBay   Some eBay sellers have discounted items this week. They can be found on the Deals page. Just type something into the search box (like Topps, Panini, Upper Deck or whatever you’re looking for) and you’ll get the results of what’s been marked down. SportsMemorabilia.com and Fanatics Fanatics’ main website, SportsMemorabilia.com and Steiner Sports all fall under the Fanatics umbrella now and all will be offering discounts on autographed items and other collectibles.   A quick check at SportsMemorabilia.com showed autographs from Shaq, Jayson Tatum, Nolan Ryan, Don Mattingly, Chipper Jones, Henrik Lundqvist, Auston Matthews and numerous other stars discounted quite a bit as well. This signed, time lapse photo of Carlton Fisk’s famous 1975 World Series game-winning homer is less than $65.  If you’re an Eagles fan–or a football fan in general–this unsigned photo of Saquon Barkley is about as cool as it gets for a very low cost.  Cards are typically excluded from the sale but it’s possible certain card products will be discounted. It’s best just to start browsing. Fanatics, of course, will have mountains of team gear, too, where the discount will apply. The company’s offers will change by the day for those types of items, including a one-time $50 discount for new customers. If you’re all about baseball, MLBShop is another option. Card Companies Topps’ Holiday sale is open now.  The company offers discounts on certain items, including current and recent unopened boxes like Holiday Baseball, supplies and other items. There isn’t a ton of variety but they do sometimes sell out quickly so it’s best to at least check out the deals ASAP. Upper Deck is touting its Black Friday deals on cards and items from the UDA store. We suspect Panini America will also have some special deals on their website. Online retailers Black Friday/Cyber Monday is a big one for the big online retailers of trading card boxes.  Steel City Collectibles, Blowout Cards, Dave & Adam’s and other big sellers usually offer ongoing specials.  Steel City has a page devoted to their specials.  Another big seller, Baseball Card Exchange, will roll out its Black Friday specials (5-10% off depending on the size of an order) at one minute past midnight on Thursday night/Friday. Amazon/Walmart  Shopping for card deals on Amazon can be a little frustrating as the site isn’t really well organized but there are quite a few Black Friday deal offers for supplies–everything from penny sleeves to top loaders, graded card carrying cases, display stands for single cards and storage boxes. You can start here and search around for what you’re looking for. They do have a few unopened boxes of recent product in their Black Friday section. While prices may not always be better than eBay, shipping is often free, which can sometimes more than make up for it.

Sports Collectors Daily,How the 1994-95 NHL Lockout Spelled More Trouble for The Hobby,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/how-the-1994-95-nhl-lockout-spelled-more-trouble-for-the-hobby/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 01:40:06 +0000","Thirty years ago, a hobby already trying to stay alive due to the baseball strike had to face an NHL lockout to start the 1994-95 season.","November 25, 2024 By Jeff Morris  While 1994 in the sports card industry will always be linked to the Major League Baseball players’ strike that shut down the season and hastened the unraveling of what had been a booming market, there was another labor stoppage that gave the hobby a double whammy. The NHL locked out its players for the start of the 1994 season. The players had gone to training camp and there were even some pre-season games played. But on October 1, the players were locked out. They had played the entire previous season without a deal in place. The lockout lasted until the sides finally settled on Jan. 11, saving what would be a 48-game season and playoffs that would run deeper into the summer than ever before. The key issues involved salary cap and luxury tax proposals. The league wanted a mechanism in place that would benefit the small market teams and add parity. The players’ union was not on board with the plan. Meanwhile, the collectibles business took a second hard hit on the heels of the already devastating baseball strike. Series 1 trading card products rolled out on time, but the demand was nowhere near at the level it had been in the previous two years. While there is a monopoly with Upper Deck and the NHL today, the 1994 hockey card market was the wild west. The number of brands at that time was staggering compared to what is being released today. Joining Upper Deck in the market were Pinnacle, Fleer, Topps, O-Pee-Chee and Donruss/Leaf. Pro Set was gone but the Parkhurst name was being shopped around and eventually picked up by Upper Deck. Action Packed had produced some fringe items and was knocking at the door for an NHL license. There were food issues and other sets, too.  Kraft was producing a food promotion set for Kraft and Jell-O products in Canada. Upper Deck was producing a McDonald’s set in Canada, which is the license that Tim Hortons has now. They also produced an NHLPA-licensed set called Be A Player, which included an autograph in every pack. Another big seller for a brief time that year was a set of NHL POGs from the World POG Federation. Panini was producing an NHL sticker book and stickers which sold well in Canada and Europe but did not do as well in the United States, a market that had not warmed up to stickers yet. There was also a Kitchener, Ontario-based company called Slapshot that produced junior hockey cards, as well as prospect sets from Signature Rookies and Classic. One promoter told the Calgary Herald in November of 1994 that the work stoppages “have devastated an already depressed business.”  In Alberta, hockey accounted for about 80% of store sales. At the time of the hockey lockout, I was the editor of Canadian Sportscard Collector and was also contracted to write some card backs. I went into a lot of shops and attended a lot of shows. I remember one shop owner closing his doors in the Ottawa area that year. He said he had to invest so much money into hockey and baseball to carry at least a few boxes of every product that he couldn’t afford the inventory needed to compete. He also said that he didn’t have the counter space to carry every item he wanted to. Another shop in Michigan that I visited had the same problem. Hockey was a huge seller in his shop, and he struggled to stock hockey and baseball products. Plus, he carried every NFL product and NBA product, as the Lions and Pistons were both popular at the time and driving sales. Because I was based in the Niagara area at that time, I also frequented shops and shows in the Buffalo area. They were also hit hard, but they had the popularity of the Bills to help them weather the storm. Before the lockout, there were a number of monthly shows at small hotels and community centers on both sides of the border that were put on hold and never came back. The decline in interest in the hockey card market was noticeable was at a pair of big shows. The October Montreal show saw attendance take a hit. The hardcore vintage and diehard collectors were there, and the autograph list of retired Montreal Canadiens and local stars who had played for other teams was good.  However, the vibe of the show and the feeling on the floor was downright depressing. First of all, the baseball strike hit Montreal harder than any other city and market. It ripped out the potential for a World Series from what was the best and hottest team in baseball. Olympic Stadium, at the same Olympic Park complex, stood somewhat-less-than-majestically behind the Maurice Richard Arena, where the show took place. Just seeing the stadium was a stark reminder that what had once been one of the best sports cities in North America had, at that time, no professional sports. The Canadiens were locked out. The Expos were on strike. The Alouettes had folded and would not return for a couple years, leaving only memories of Johnny Rodgers, Jimmy Jones, Tom Cousineau, Junior Ah You, and other Montreal football legends.  The city and its collectors had a blanket of depression thrown over them. It was a far cry from the same show from the previous year, when the Canadiens were the defending Stanley Cup champions, Patrick Roy was the most celebrated hero of the generation, and the excitement around the Expos was gaining momentum and was bringing the city back to the Gary Carter-Andre Dawson-Tim Raines era. The dealers in 1994 were there on the show floor with little to no crowds at their tables. Stacks of hockey and baseball wax boxes gathered dust. The autograph lineups drew enthusiastic collectors and fans, but the turnout was smaller than usual. That show was almost like a turning point in the city and in the entire province of Quebec. The sports card market would not be the same for about the next quarter century. Like in every other city, it wasn’t until COVID that things really blossomed into what it had been before 1994. The next big show that year was the Sport Card and Memorabilia Expo in Toronto. It was more of the same, yet even more pronounced. There was still excitement around the Maple Leafs, who in 1993 made their best Stanley Cup playoff run since winning their last Stanley Cup in 1967. But that excitement was temporarily deflated. The Blue Jays had been drawing four million fans per year and had won back-to-back World Series. They would not have made the post-season that year, as the New York Yankees were running away with the division and the wild card was a long shot. But there was still a buzz about the National League Expos, as all baseball fans in Canada wanted the World Series to stay in Canada. There were even conspiracy theories floating around in Canada that Bud Selig and Donald Fehr wanted the season cancelled because it would be better for baseball to lose a World Series than have a third straight in Canada. It wasn’t the first ridiculous sports conspiracy theory, and it was certainly not the last. The attendance at the 1994 Toronto show was a little better than half of what it had been in years past. Like in Montreal, the hardcore collectors were there with their want lists. Sales of new wax boxes were flat, but stronger than they were in Montreal. The number of collectors who travelled to Toronto from the United States, most notably from Buffalo, Boston and Detroit, was way down. The corporate booths were still there, but on a much smaller scale. About 30 miles away along the QEW, Hamilton was hosting the “4-on-4 Challenge”. It was a four-team tournament of four-on-four hockey featuring the locked out stars. Team Ontario, Team Quebec, Team Western Canada and Team USA played a three-day tournament on the same weekend as the Expo. Patrick Roy, Luc Robitaille, Brett Hull, Doug Gilmour, Joe Sakic and a number of top NHL stars took part in the tournament. The teams wore NHLPA logo uniforms. The tournament raised more than a half million dollars for Ronald McDonald Children’s Charities of Canada and minor hockey associations throughout the country. Wayne Gretzky, meanwhile, was organizing a barnstorming tour of Europe. He joined forces with IMG to create the Ninety-Nine All-Stars Team which spent the first two weeks of December touring Norway, Finland, Sweden and Germany. The 4-on-4 Challenge and the Ninety-Nine All-Stars also found their way onto hockey cards. The Be A Player brand, which started as an NHLPA project with Upper Deck, featured many photos from the tournament. Also included in the 1994-95 Be A Player set was a 19-card insert set called Wayne Gretzky’s 99 All-Stars. The set features photography from the December, 1994 games. Meanwhile at Canadian Sportscard Collector magazine, it seemed like there was a continual daily discussion with my co-worker and close friend Baron Bedeksy about the situation. Who are we going to put on the cover? Our 50th issue fell in November, 1994. We needed to come up with something a little bit different for the issue that would be for sale at the Expo, which was the biggest opportunity of the year to showcase our magazine. At that time, the 1993 seven game semi-final series between the Leafs and the Los Angeles Kings was still talked about. It was one of the greatest NHL playoff series ever. One of the hockey card licensing rules was that fighting was not allowed on cards. In that series, Wendel Clark and Marty McSorley dropped the mitts and had one of the most epic fights in NHL playoff history. Bruce Bennett Studios sent us a great image from the fight. Maybe the card companies couldn’t put fighting on their cards, but we could put it on the cover. The headline was “Why you won’t see this on an NHL hockey card”. During the lockout, we also focused on some future stars. Brett Lindros, the younger brother of Eric Lindros, was a highly touted junior star with the Kingston Frontenacs of the Ontario Hockey League. He had been drafted ninth overall by the New York Islanders. Lindros was destroying junior hockey. In 26 games with Kingston, he had 24 goals and 23 assists for 47 points. Putting him on one of our covers was a slam dunk. Many said he would be just as good as his older brother. He joined the Islanders when the lockout ended. Concussions put an early end to his career. He played only 51 NHL games and scored just two goals. He was a player that many collectors had invested in. Injuries turned him into one of the biggest busts in hockey card history. Pinnacle already had Eric Lindros under contract as a spokesman. Brett spent more than half the 1993-94 season with the Canadian National Team before returning to Kingston. His time with the national team in Canada opened the door for a special insert card in 1993-94 Pinnacle of the Lindros brothers. The other junior cover we did was Jeff O’Neill. He was pictured in his Hartford Whalers jersey from the NHL Draft. The headline was “The Real Deal”. O’Neill had been drafted fifth overall and was in the midst of his second straight monster year with the Guelph Storm of the OHL. O’Neill had a very good NHL career with Hartford, Carolina and Toronto. He is a very popular media personality in Canada and especially in Toronto. He is a Toronto sports radio co-host and is a commentator on Leafs TV broadcasts. He is also on The Sports Network in Canada as a hockey analyst. He is usually on the TSN show as part of their panel of experts from his home office. Behind him on the wall on every episode, several times a week on national TV in Canada, is a framed cover of Canadian Sportscard Collector. I have never met Jeff O’Neill, though several years ago a friend of mine got him to sign a copy of the magazine for me. But seeing that issue on his wall, when I was the one who decided to put him on the cover, picked the photo, and came up with the headline, is pretty cool. I hope I get to meet him some day so I can tell him about what went into that piece of memorabilia on his wall. In January, 1995, the puck dropped and play resumed. The lockout was over. The hockey card market was easing into the new normal. Unfortunately, the lockout was the knockout punch to many sports card stores already staggering from the baseball strike. Jeff Morris is a hobby veteran who has been a collector for more than 50 years. Originally a hobby journalist, he became brand manager at Pinnacle, and then was an executive for Collector's Edge and Shop at Home before joining Pacific Trading Cards as VP of Marketing. He is the former editor and publisher of Canadian Sports Collector magazine, and he was also a columnist for ESPN.com.

Sports Collectors Daily,"With Canton Calling, a Look at Adam Vinatieri’s 1997 Pacific Philadelphia Rookie Card",https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/adam-vinatieris-1997-pacific-philadelphia-rookie-card/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 01:30:18 +0000","Only one company put New England's young kicker in its trading card set. Now, Adam Vinatieri's lone rookie card is one of the most sought after of the era.","November 25, 2024 By Horacio Ruiz  He’s the NFL’s all-time leading scorer and a four-time Super Bowl champion. If you’re looking to digest the Adam Vinatieri rookie card checklist, though, it won’t take long. A guy who could soon have a bust in Canton has just one, from a company that no longer exists.  That might tell you how long ago it was. If you think you can pick one up for a buck or two, though, you’re in for a surprise. In his first year of Hall of Fame eligibility, Vinatieri now has an opportunity to become the first ever first-ballot kicker to be inducted. Last week, Vinatieri was one of 25 Modern-Day semifinalists announced by the Pro Football Hall of Fame. While Vinatieri needs to go through two more rounds of cuts, he appears to be a favorite for this year’s class. He is the NFL’s all-time leading scorer, having passed the last kicker inducted into the Hall of Fame, Morten Andersen. Vinatieri was an integral part of the New England Patriots dynasty during the first half of the Tom Brady era, appearing in four Super Bowls and winning three. But Vinatieri made a name for himself by being clutch in high-pressure situations. He was a weapon his teammates could rely on in close games.  Embed from Getty Images During the 2001-02 AFC Divisional Playoffs, Vinatieri kicked the game-tying and game-winning field goals for the Patriots in blizzard-like conditions. Later in those playoffs, as New England marched towards its first title, Vinatieri kicked the game-winning field goal as time expired in Super Bowl XXXVI. Vinatieri would do it again two years later, kicking a game-winning 41-yard field goal in Super Bowl XXXVIII with four seconds remaining as the Patriots claimed their second title in three years. After ten years in New England, Vinatieri signed with the Indianapolis Colts, where he helped win Super Bowl XLI in his first season with the franchise. Embed from Getty Images Vinatieri retired after the 2019 season, and he remains the all-time leader in career field goals made, field goals attempted, consecutive field goals made, and most combined regular-season and postseason games played. There is a valid argument for calling him the greatest placekicker ever. For football card collectors, especially those who focus on Hall of Fame rookie cards, now might be a good time to look at Vinatieri. While Vinatieri started his NFL career as an undrafted free agent in 1996, his lone rookie card (no parallels) is found in the 1997 Pacific Philadelphia football set. Vinatieri is the key card in the set because it was released in May 1997 – too soon to feature the recent draft class and too late to issue any “true” rookie cards. It’s a humble start for a guy who turned out to be an all-time great but something the long defunct Pacific made a habit of doing (see Kurt Warner). Rodney Harrison, a teammate of Vinatieri’s in New England, also has a rookie card in the ’97 Pacific Philadelphia set. He was named a Hall of Fame semifinalist this year after being one of 15 finalists last year. Card #199 shows Vinatieri just after a kickoff, with the Patriots logo in the bottom right corner and his name in gold foil. The back of the card highlights his rookie campaign and highlights from his college career at South Dakota State.  The back discusses his college and pro career to that point.
 PSA has graded the Vinatieri rookie 370 times, with 95 Gem Mint 10s and 151 Mint 9s. Beckett has graded the card 145 times, with one Pristine 10 and 41 Gem Mint 9.5s. Raw cards on eBay are selling for between $50 and $70. The most recent PSA 10 sold for $417 and the most recent PSA 9 sold for $135. It would be two more years before additional cards of Vinatieri would arrive in packs, inside the Triumph set from Collectors Edge. There are no guarantees this will be the year Vinatieri gets inducted. Hall of Fame voting can be unpredictable and, at times, political. But Vinatieri is poised to become the fifth-ever placekicker inducted into the Hall of Fame. Being a semifinalist in his first season of eligibility bodes well for his future chances.

Earlier this year, the Bruins announced the uniform for today’s December 1st contest, one hundred years to the day of their first-ever NHL game, played on December 1, 1924. Much like those 20th-century ’24-25 Bruins, these 21st-century ’24-25 Bruins face Montreal. However, this time, it’s the Montreal Canadiens since the Montreal team they played in 1924 hasn’t seen the ice in almost 90 years. You may have thought the Bruins would wear a uniform from 1924, perhaps for such an occasion, or maybe even one from the 1930s? But no, instead, they’ll wear the design from the 1980s and ’90s, which coincides with when the club president played for the team (hey, the man knows what he likes). The base of the black sweater is pure Bruins in the ’80s, with the same yellow and white striping style used during the decade. The crest is slightly different from what the club wore during that era as serifs have been added to the “B” within the spokes — this is the same style logo the Bruins wore in 2023-24, but now presented in their traditional black and yellow colour scheme rather than the commemorative black and metallic gold it was dressed in last season. A modified Bruins 100 patch is on the upper right front of the jersey, now incorporating the date of their first game. The best part is that they actually placed the patch on the front of their jersey with the Rapid7 advertisement that usually goes there temporarily relocated to the right shoulder for the game. Inside the jersey are some additional details—the inside collar reads “BOSTON BRUINS 2 – MONTREAL MAROONS 1,” the score from their first game (should I be the one to break it to them that the Montreal team wasn’t officially known as the Maroons for another year? I’m available for consulting gigs, folks!). Inside the bottom hem, the team’s “core values” of tradition, grit, passion, and heart are contained, with each word separated by Boston Bruins logos. “The Centennial Game will be a special moment for our organization and more importantly, our fans, so the jersey design had to be fit for the occasion,” said Cam Neely, Boston Bruins President in the teams’ press release. “There are so many elements for both fans and the players to enjoy, but my favourite part of the jersey is on the bottom hemline; When our players pull this jersey over their heads, they will see our core values: tradition, grit, passion and heart. These are the values that we have embodied for a century and will carry with us for the next generation, which starts December 1.” Outside of the jersey, we see some other changes when comparing this to the Bruins’ uniform of the ’80s. The pants now feature the Bruins’ current wordmark logo (instead of nothing). The new socks are black at the top and yellow at the bottom, with a yellow and white stripe separating the two halves.

For fixtures between November 29 and December 5, Premier League players are wearing rainbow boot laces and rainbow captain’s armbands. Other materials around stadiums will be adorned with rainbows, including corner flags, ball plinths, handshake boards, pitchside advertising boards and substitute boards. The Rainbow Laces campaign is an initiative of Stonewall, an organization in the United Kingdom that aims to “drive positive change in public attitudes and public policy” and “ensure LGBTQ+ people can thrive throughout our lives by building deep, sustained change programmes with the institutions that have the biggest impact on us.” Football has the power to bring us together. Clubs and communities are stronger when everyone feels welcome, and it’s down to all of us to make that happen.

The Storm took advantage of the day to launch their new black alternate jerseys on their website and social media channels, and they’ll wear them on the ice for the first time tonight (Friday, November 29) at home against the Windsor Spitfires. This is the first time in almost 15 years the Storm will have an alternate jersey in their wardrobe. The black jerseys have broad horizontal crimson stripes with white borders running around the chest and back and around each sleeve. The front of the jersey features a new alternate logo depicting a G inside a roundel with a lightning bolt stretching across and forming the crossbar. “GUELPH” is written out in the roundel above the bolt, while “STORM” is written out below. Crimson and white stripes run around the waist. It's Black Friday #StormCity | #IoftheStorm pic.twitter.com/mOZHq6mOVc “For several seasons, we’ve had fans ask for the return of a black Storm jersey. We’re proud to debut a collaborative design on Friday night that answers their calls and brings a black jersey back into our team sweater rotation for years to come.” The new logo on the front of the jersey matches one that was filed with the Canadian Trademark Database back in May. The shoulders of the jersey also have a new logo that was first seen in the May trademark filing. It’s a stylized S, with the top half swirling around a puck and the bottom half turning into a lightning bolt. This logo was also at centre ice at the Sleeman Centre in Guelph for the Storm’s annual Pink the Rink night, which was held on November 16. Both new logos were created by late designer Keith Flynn of Flynnagain Productions when the Storm underwent a redesign in 2017. The numbers on the back and sleeves of the new jersey are white with crimson and metallic silver outlines, while names on the back are one-colour white. The jersey will be paired with black helmets, black gloves and black socks with the same crimson and white stripes found on the sleeves and chest. Merchandise with the new logos is now available through the Storm’s online shop. Replica jerseys are not available, though, “due to league-wide shipping issues.” The last time the Storm had an alternate jersey was in the 2010-11 season, when they wore a retro design from the 1951-52 season honoring the Biltmore Mad Hatters. Named for the Biltmore Hat Factory in Guelph, the team won the city’s first Memorial Cup in 1952 with a team that featured four future Hockey Hall of Fame inductees."

The ECHL affiliates of the Minnesota Wild based in Coralville, Iowa, are celebrating their home state’s proud tradition of pork production on Saturday, November 30, when they host the Bloomington Bison on “Crispy Bacon Night.” And the themed uniforms that the Heartlanders will wear for the game are something else. The Heartlanders unveiled the uniforms on their social media channels on Wednesday, November 27, calling them “horrendously perfect.” The jerseys, pants and socks combine to give the overall effect of a pig farmer wearing denim overalls. The jersey itself has a pink and grey plaid pattern on the sleeves and the upper chest for the farmer’s collared shirt. The denim overalls cover most of the chest and back. On the front of the jersey, the Heartlanders’ primary logo sits on the pocket of the overalls in the middle of the chest. Several strips of bacon poke out of that same pocket. The shoulders of the jersey depict the straps and buckles of the overalls. Sponsor logos are overlaid on the shoulders and the right chest. The pants and socks both have a blue denim pattern, completing the overalls look, with darker pockets on the back of the pants. The numbers on the back and sleeves are pink with black outlines and set in the Heartlanders’ usual font. Nameplates are black with white lettering. Under the number on the back, a pink curly pig’s tail pokes out from the overalls. According to the Heartlanders, there are more pigs (23 million) in Iowa than people (4 million), so a pork-and-bacon-themed night is a perfect fit. Along with the jerseys, the Heartlanders will be handing out thundersticks designed to look like bacon strips, and they’ll host a bacon-themed pregame party at the nearby Hyatt Hotel Exhibit Hall. Your Crispy Bacon experience doesn’t end when you walk in the door… in fact, it’s just beginning and will carry over into the game, with specialty concessions, in-game bacon activities, and pork eating contests.  This is sure to be be one of the most unique nights in Heartlanders history.  Game-worn jerseys are being auctioned off through Dash, with bids closing at 7:45 p.m. CT on Saturday. Puck drop between the Heartlanders and Bison is set for 6 p.m. CT Saturday at the Xtream Arena in Coralville. If you want to see these jerseys in person, tickets are still available through the Heartlanders’ website."

It then returned for a Thanksgiving victory over the Giants in 2022, as well as last year’s win over the Washington Commanders.

The team posted a message to fans on their website and social media channels on Tuesday, November 26. In it, they say they are launching “a deliberate process through which we will seek out, listen to, and reflect on input about our team name from fans, supporters, and a group of advisors assembled to reflect a diverse range of voices and perspectives.” We appreciate you pushing us to be the best we can be.  To learn more about our process and share your thoughts, please visit: https://t.co/2Ae5eamAnI pic.twitter.com/pfuBI1XMUp We want to assure you that we have heard your feedback and are actively listening. We share your high expectations, and together, we will build a storied club that reflects the essence of the beautiful game and the character of our dynamic city. The “BOS Nation” moniker was originally chosen in part because the letters could be rearranged to spell “Bostonian.” “It starts with ‘Bostonian’ — those nine letters that make up that word are so meaningful to those of us that come from there,” controlling owner Jennifer Epstein told CBS in October. “When you rearrange those letters you get BOS Nation, and that was very intentional. This team is fan-centric, fans first, and our new identity is made up of the diverse communities that live in our strong city and have a love — or will soon have a love — of the beautiful game.” The team also launched two wordmark logos at the time, both of which used a color scheme of green and black with pink accents. It was unclear at the time if these were intended to appear on kits or if another crest would be forthcoming. This commitment remains clear: to create a Club that represents the strength, diversity, and passion of this community, and that starts with the team’s name. Here’s how we’re leading the charge: • Hosting Dedicated Forums and Opportunities to Listen: Engaging with fans, women’s sports advocates, former players, and Boston leaders. We’ve already begun hosting sessions and welcome suggestions for groups and individuals we should include here. • Assembling Brand Advisors:  We’ve identified a diverse group of voices to guide and shape our future and welcome additional nominations here. • Listening to Your Feedback: We have read, archived, and are now studying, all feedback provided to date. We welcome you to continue to share your thoughts through this quick form. No matter what the name ends up being, Boston’s NWSL franchise is slated to begin play in the 2026 season. They’ll play their home games at White Stadium, a 10,519-seat facility in historic Franklin Park that recently underwent a $30-million renovation. The team’s ownership group includes Hollywood actor/producer/director Elizabeth Banks and Team USA Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman. No related stories."

The Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) and Puma announced the new deal on Wednesday, November 27. The contract is effective January 1, 2025, and formally brings to an end the FPF’s partnership with Nike, who had been producing kits for Portugal since 1997. The deal with Puma covers all of Portugal’s men’s, women’s and youth national teams, along with the FPF’s futsal, beach football and E-Sports teams. “Signing a top-tier national team was one of our priorities in football and I am very excited to welcome a team as popular as Portugal to the Puma Family,” said Puma CEO Arne Freundt in the company’s press release. “Given the large number of fans all over the world and the great potential of the next generation of this squad, we are looking forward to the upcoming big tournaments such as the 2026 World Cup.” Portugal is also one of three host nations for the 2030 FIFA World Cup, along with Spain and Morocco. While Puma has never made kits for Portugal before, the company did partner with legendary Portuguese player Eusébio in the 1960s. Known as “O Rei” (“The King”), Eusébio and Puma collaborated on the iconic Puma King football boot. Eusébio was the top scorer in the 1966 FIFA World Cup, in which Portugal finished third. “We were attracted to PUMA because of the way in which they engage with the fans and tell the unique story of every team they work with,” said FPF president Fernando Gomes in the press release. “We look forward to creating an exciting range of products with them which will resonate with our large fan base all over the world.” During their time with Nike, Portugal won the 2016 European Championship and the 2018-19 UEFA Nations League. Their best showing at a FIFA World Cup during that stretch was a fourth-place finish in 2006. Puma will unveil the first of its new FPF products in early 2025."

On Thursday, November 21, the Guinea Football Federation (Feguifoot) lodged a formal complaint with the Confederation of African Football (CAF) over their men’s national team’s 1-0 loss to Tanzania two days before. That win vaulted Tanzania to second place in Group H of the 2025 African Cup of Nations qualification round — one point ahead of Guinea — and secured their spot in the tournament finals, to be held from December 21, 2025, to January 18, 2026, in Morocco. Feguifoot contends that Tanzanian substitute Ibrahim Ame was listed as number 24 on the official teamsheet for the match, but when he entered the game in the 73rd minute, Ame was wearing number 26 on his shirt. “Therefore … the player in question was not eligible to take part in the match,” Feguifoot’s press release reads (translated to English by Google). “By bringing this player into the game in the 73rd minute with this number 26, Tanzania therefore used an unqualified player.” “The situation was all the more serious because the absence of a listed number was combined with the absence of a name on the jersey, making it de facto impossible to verify the player’s identity,” they add. Feguifoot has asked the CAF to award the win and the three points to Guinea, which would mean they would qualify for the AFCON finals instead of Tanzania. Tanzania scored their goal in the 61st minute of the match, before Ame came on as a substitute. The Tanzanian Football Federation (TFF) responded on their Facebook page, saying their players “were checked by the opposing team and the Commissioner where they were allowed to play” (translated to English by Google). “(The) TFF does not have any information from the Confederation of African Football (CAF) that Ame’s participation in the match was illegal.” Feguifoot’s release also alleges that the kickoff time for the game — which was held in Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania — was unfairly moved ahead three hours, forcing players to play in extreme heat with only 48 hours’ notice of the change. It also noted that the match commissioner and security officer were both from Kenya, a country that borders Tanzania. Both nations are also part of the Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations (CECAFA) Zonal Union. The CAF has yet to make a ruling on the formal complaint."

Coming soon to Milan Puskar Stadium 👀 pic.twitter.com/lfWGg27Pd8 A gold Flying “WV” will still be prominently featured at the 50-yard line, just like it has been since the 1997 season, when West Virginia moved away from the state outline and a smaller Flying “WV” at midfield. However, the Mountaineers have replaced the wordmarks in the navy blue end zones and the yard-line numbers with their current typeface, which was introduced in 2019, while two parallel stripes also flank the wordmarks. The stripes are reminiscent of the pants stripes on West Virginia’s uniforms, which were revealed prior to this season. The stripes were a staple under Hall of Fame head coach Don Nehlen from 1980-93 and were used on their “Country Roads” alternate uniforms in 2022 and 2023. Lastly, the out-of-bounds area behind the end zones and down the sidelines to the designated team areas at the 25-yard line is now navy blue. The sidelines and out-of-bounds area behind the end zones have been white since 1988. This marks the first update to the turf at Milan Puskar Stadium since 2016, when – according to our friend Ethan Dimitroff of the Mountaineer Uniform Database — West Virginia increased the size of the Flying “WV” and changed the placement of the Big XII logos to the 25-yard lines.

SportsLogos.Net News,Did The Los Angeles Chargers Leak New Alternate Helmets?,https://news.sportslogos.net/2024/11/27/did-los-angeles-chargers-tease-navy-blue-alternate-helmets-in-skate-club-collaboration/football/,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 08:42:08 +0000","The Los Angeles Chargers may have teased a new navy blue alternate helmet as part of their collaboration with Crenshaw City Skate Club, though we have reason to believe it was nothing more than a display from inside their facility.","The Los Angeles Chargers recently announced a collaboration with Crenshaw City Skate Club that merges their brand with skateboarding culture through limited-edition hoodies, t-shirts and skate decks. In doing so, however, the Chargers may have accidentally revealed their plans to unveil a navy blue alternate helmet – which would be worn with their navy blue Color Rush uniforms – ahead of next season. The Chargers have paired their navy blue Color Rush uniforms, which feature a single-color lightning bolt on the shoulders and pants, with their standard white helmets since their current uniform design was unveiled in 2020. They simply swap the powder blue and gold lightning bolt decals, powder blue numbers and gold facemasks for navy blue and gold lightning bolt decals, navy blue numbers and navy blue facemasks to complete the look. dark mode activated pic.twitter.com/K4a1qez9Dl The reason for this is the NFL’s one-helmet rule, though the league has since relaxed that rule, allowing teams to introduce a second or third shell to their closet. The Chargers are among a handful of teams that have not yet taken advantage it. But if the promotional photos that were shared on social media by the Chargers and the skate club are any indication, they could soon have a navy blue helmet with single-color lightning bolt, gold numbers and navy blue facemask at their disposal. That said, a closer inspection of the photoshoot suggests the navy blue helmet is nothing more than a display piece from the Chargers’ facility, as it is a Riddell Speed with interior padding that is consistent with full-size collectible helmets. There’s also the presence of a large white warning sticker on the back, which typically states, “This replica helmet is for display only. It is not designed or intended for use as a protective helmet. Do not wear this helmet.” You can also see the sticker on the inside. Compare those features to the white helmet, which is an authentic Vicis Zero2 and includes other details such as the Chargers’ front and back bumpers, as well as the American flag, NFL shield and a warning label that lists the potential dangers of playing football. Now, that’s not to say the Chargers won’t eventually unveil a navy blue alternate helmet. After all, they scrapped their royal blue Color Rush uniforms this season – and, if you’re going to add another helmet, you might as well maximize the amount of times it can be worn each season. But given the information we shared above, it would be a stretch to constitute this as a leak at this time. Of course, we’ll keep you posted anything changes, seeing as we’ve been on top of the alternate and throwback helmet news for the last two seasons.

In July 2024, Leicester City announced it had signed a sponsorship deal — one of the most valuable in its history, the club said at the time — with BC.Game, an online cryptocurrency gaming platform. The site’s logo has appeared on the front of the Leicester City men’s first team jerseys since the 2024-25 Premier League season began in August. But BC.Game’s financial health has been seriously questioned lately. According to iGamingBusiness, bankruptcy petitions were filed in October against the site’s former owner, Blockdance, and its current parent company, Small House, in Curaçao, the Caribbean island nation where BC.Game is licensed. These petitions were filed by The Foundation for the Representation of Victims of Online Gaming and allege Small House has failed to pay out more than $2 million in player winnings since acquiring the site in February 2024. In a statement dated November 21, 2024, BC.Game says the allegations “lack substantive evidence and fail to demonstrate any violations by our platform.” The allegations lack sufficient supporting evidence, with many claims based solely on unverified statements. Our internal investigations have revealed discrepancies in the cases cited by the plaintiffs, with most accusations lacking a clear legal or technical basis. We affirm that BC.GAME has adhered to industry compliance standards in all relevant operations. The statement also raises concerns about lawyers’ conduct in the case and inconsistencies in the case evidence. For their part, Leicester City also released a statement of support for BC.Game: “We have been and continue to be in regular discussions with BC.Game with regard to an active legal case in Curacao. BC.Game have provided the Club with the strongest assurances that they are actively appealing this case, and that the process which has been initiated in Curacao is administrative in nature and has not arisen due to any concerns with their financial standing. “BC.Game have further assured us that they have no issues with liquidity and that they remain fully committed to meeting their ongoing contractual and financial obligations, including to the Club, and that this case will not impact on BC.Game’s continuing international operations.” Should BC.Game not be able to fulfill their deal with Leicester City, it wouldn’t be the first time in recent memory that a cryptocurrency firm has had to terminate a sponsorship contract early. Late in the 2022-23 season, Italian clubs AS Roma and Inter Milan both dropped their front-of-shirt sponsor, blockchain company DigitalBits, over missed contract payments. AC Milan played in blank shirts for a few games before securing streaming service Paramount+ as a new sponsor for the final match of the Serie A season and the UEFA Champions League final. AS Roma, meanwhile, played the rest of the season with the initials “SPQR” on their shirts. The acronym stands for “Senatus PopulusQue Romanus” (“The Senate and the People of Rome”) and it also “appears on Roman currency, at the end of documents made public by an inscription in stone or metal, and in dedications of monuments and public and civil works,” according to Wikipedia. The full phrase “appears in Roman political, legal, and historical literature.”"

The new brand has been a long time coming. “The Nook Nation alternate brand has been years in the making,” Chinooks GM Eric Snodgrass said in a statement. “We wanted an alternate and fresh look that we could use on occasions through the off-season and during the summer while still keeping our classic branding as our primary look. From the different unique elements in the logos to the new color palette, we think the new brand will be a great representation of our fan base in the Northshore and the Milwaukee metro area.”  Per the team, the Chinooks fanbase has called itself by the nickname Nook Nation since 2013.    The fish in the logo is an updated version of the chinook (a kind of salmon) reflected in the team’s original logo.

The Federación Mexicana de Futbol (FMF) announced on Friday, November 22, that they had extended their kit contract with German sportswear giant Adidas for another 10 years, “seeking to continue building memorable stories alongside the players; but above all, with the help of the fans,” according to a press release (translated to English by Google). “For the FMF it is an honor that adidas continues to be part of our history for 10 more years. This collaboration is based on shared values ​​to which adidas has shown a deep commitment, such as respect for our culture, traditions and passion for soccer. We are sure that the renewal will continue to inspire generations of Mexicans to proudly wear the colors of our National Team,” said FMF executive president Ivar Sisniega. “For adidas, being on the side of Mexican soccer has always been important; being part of the process of achieving success is becoming increasingly important today, and in this sense, we are happy to continue being part of this path. We are convinced that the triumphs will come and will be memories that will be close to the hearts of soccer fans forever, not just for the next ten years,” added Adidas Mexico general manager Jorge Dionne. The new contract will cover the 2026, 2030 and 2034 FIFA World Cups. The FMF first partnered with Adidas in 1984, and that contract lasted until 1990. Mexico kits were then produced by various companies like Umbro, ABA Sport, Garcis and Atletica until 2003, when the FMF signed a contract with Nike. In 2007, Mexico partnered up with Adidas once again, and that relationship that lasted ever since.

The new look maintains the popular bee character, a staple in the minor league baseball landscape since 2006, while updating the typography and adding some alternate identities. The new type, which is included in the primary logo and the interlocking cap logo, is meant to allude to the sting of a bee. The interlocking SL cap logo pre-dates the Bees in Salt Lake City, with previous teams in the city like the Gulls and the Trappers using a version of the baseball custom in the 1970s and ’80s. New alternate identities pay tribute to the state of Utah, including one that features the state outline with the word Bees set in a descending staircase that evokes a classic logo from the team’s parent club, the Los Angeles Angels. Another alternate pays homage to the Beehive State with a beehive icon. If you’ve driven through Utah, you’ll know this symbol from the state’s highway signs. Yet another alternate sets pair of crossed bats within a honeycomb, with icons of a baseball and the state of Utah set opposite the letters S and L. The new Bees look pays tribute to teams from the early 20th century with a recreation of a bee illustration on uniforms from the 1920s. The team unveiled a series of wordmarks derived from their new custom typography. The Bees, affiliates of the Los Angeles Angels in the International League, played their final game at Smith’s Ballpark September 22. Next season the team will play in South Jordan, about 20 miles south Salt Lake City, at brand-new Daybreak Field."

About two weeks after the conclusion of the 2024 Korean Series in late October, the KBO League team based in Daejeon, South Korea, unveiled a new suite of logos and uniforms for 2025. While the orange remains in their colour palette from previous seasons, it is now complemented by a dark shade of navy blue instead of black.

Both identities were created by designer Matthew Wolff. The wordmarks include one in cursive script and one in all caps. Both were “developed with the motif of an eagle’s beak and talons,” the team said on social media. The cursive script—used in the primary logo and on both the white home and orange alternate uniforms—is “a modern reinterpretation of the logo from the championship days,” when the Eagles won their only Korean Series in 1999. Also included in the new suite is an eagle head logo with lightning bolts in the neck. This logo doesn’t appear on the Eagles’ new uniforms, but it is used on their website, on team merchandise, and on a flag that was used in the photo shoots for the new uniforms. The Eagles’ white home uniforms feature the scripted wordmark in one-colour orange, while the front number is navy blue. The corporate wordmark of the Hanwha Group — a worldwide conglomerate based in Korea that deals in everything from energy to finance — appears in orange on the left shoulder. A single orange stripe runs down each side of the pants. The grey away uniforms have slightly darker grey pinstripes and a navy blue all-caps wordmark on the front, along with an orange front number. A navy blue stripe runs down each side of the pants. The Eagles also unveiled two alternate jerseys, one orange and one navy blue. The orange one has a navy blue script wordmark and a white front number, while the navy blue one has a white all-caps wordmark and a white front number. The navy alternate is also the only one where the unveiling photos showed a clear view of the back; in this case, the player name is one-colour white, while the number is one-colour orange. The Eagles’ social media announcement pictured all four jerseys with the same cap or batting helmet, which has a navy blue base and an orange script “E” on the front. Along with the Eagles and Twins, Wolff has done design work for Major League Soccer’s Chicago Fire and Los Angeles Football Club; New York/New Jersey Gotham FC, Racing Louisville, San Diego Wave FC and Angel City FC of the National Women’s Soccer League; and USL clubs like Louisville City, Union Omaha and FC Tulsa. He also worked on the typography as part of the rebranding of the National Basketball Association’s Los Angeles Clippers, which was unveiled in February 2024. The Hanwha Eagles joined the KBO League in 1986 as the Binggrae Eagles, as Binggrae was the name of Hanwha’s confectionary branch. They changed their name in 1993 when Binggrae separated from the Hanwha conglomerate. They won their only Korean Series championship in 1999 but have been runners-up five times (1988, 1989, 1991, 1992, 2006)."

Max Verstappen had already secured the drivers' championship in Las Vegas, but there was still plenty to play for. Notably, McLaren were looking to claim the constructors' championship after a tidy 1-2 finish in Saturday's sprint race. Here's how Sunday's main race unfolded in Lusail. MORE: Which driver has the most wins in F1 history? Max Verstappen took out the Qatar Grand Prix – his ninth race victory of 2024. The recently-crowned world champion proved why he is still the driver to beat, delivering a calm performance despite plenty of movement around him.  Verstappen got an ideal start as he pushed past pole-sitter George Russell at the first turn, with Norris slotting into second ahead of the Mercedes driver. There was also action at the back of the grid on the opening lap. Esteban Ocon and Franco Colapinto found themselves caught in a collision and were retired shortly after. Midway through the race, a stray wing mirror was controversially not removed from the track, and its debris eventually saw Lewis Hamilton and Carlos Sainz suffer punctures. Another safety car was called moments later when Nico Hulkenberg beached his car and Sergio Perez lost drive in his Red Bull. There were no further additions to the five-car DNF tally, but race control delivered some crucial penalties. Hamilton copped a five-second drive-through penalty for speeding in the pitlane, with the seven-time world champion considering retirement over the radio. Norris was also handed a 10-second stop-go penalty for failing to slow under a yellow flag, which saw him placed at the rear of the grid with just over a dozen laps remaining. His McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri got himself on the podium, but Norris' single point from a P10 finish means the constructors' championship battle goes to Abu Dhabi. Their rivals in the standings, Ferrari, shrunk the gap thanks to a second-placed finish from Charles Leclerc. MORE: Full F1 2025 season schedule, calendar Elsewhere in the final race standings, Zhou Guanyu helped Sauber claim their first points of the season with an eighth-placed finish.

Salah, whose long-term Liverpool future remains up in the air, provided a magnificent assist for Cody Gakpo to open the scoring as Slot's men made an irresistibly rampant start. City, who have caused plenty of heartache on the red side of Stanley Park by winning six of the previous seven Premier League titles, are a shadow of their former selves and have lost their past four league games to fall 11 points off the pace. Salah passed up a glorious one-on-one opportunity midway through a more even second half but when a ragged City defence malfunctioned once again, forcing goalkeeper Stefan Ortega to bring down Luis Diaz, the Egyptian superstar put his midweek penalty miss against Real Madrid behind him and drilled into the corner. Liverpool lead second-placed Arsenal by nine points. There are still two-thirds of the season to go and a drop-off from a run of 18 wins out of 20 under Slot is surely inevitable at some point, but right now the Reds look more than a cut above their main domestic rivals.

In fairness to a bedraggled City, they acquitted themselves far better after halftime. Doku's cameo was enjoyable and there are some green shoots of recovery. But Liverpool are 11 points down the road and nine points ahead of Arsenal. They'll take some stopping from here. Thanks very much for being with us. 90 mins+3: Doku shuffles into some room. If City can keep him fit that would be something. Van Dijk sees it out for a corner to deny Silva. Nunez gets back to concede another. 90 mins+2: Liverpool attacking with a cavalier swagger here. They know City are spent 90 mins: There'll be four added minutes.  Harvey Elliott makes his long-awaited return from a serious ankle injury in place of Diaz.  84 mins: Salah departs to a standing ovation. Curtis Jones in on to see Liverpool over the line. 83 mins: Huge error from Van Dijk! De Bruyne steals in... but can't nutmeg Kelleher. We almost had a grandstand finish on our hands. 82 mins: Doku and Grealish look to thread the needle but Liverpool's defence has been imperious all day. To underline the point, Dias aims a frankly rubbish shot that bobbles through to Kelleher. 80 mins: Silva wins a tackle on Salah and there are a few afters that the referee has to calm down. 79 mins: Foden and Lewis make way, with Grealish and De Bruyne on for City to try and be miracle men. 78 mins: GOOOOOOAAAAAAAALLLLLLL!!!!! Mohamed Salah (penalty)!!!! Ortega guesses correctly but Salah stokes unerringly into the bottom right corner, with none of his midweek jitters repeated. They're going nine points clear of Arsenal and 11 of City. It looks like their title to lose. 76 mins: PENALTY TO LIVERPOOL! Dias has been immense today but the gets in a mess trying to deal with Nunez. Diaz is on the scene, Walker can't stop him. Ortega has to try to get there but doesn't. 74 mins: Diaz from the left, where he'll be deployed now. The cross is cleared by his phonetic namesake Dias. On that other Liverpool change, it looks like Quansah will simply operate from right-back. 73 mins: Gakpo makes way for Nunez, while Quansah comes on for Alexander-Arnold. Gomez will switch to right-back to try and shackle Doku, who looks by far the most likely player to make something happen for City. 68 mins: Doku twists Alexander-Arnold this way and that and then spins pass him for good measure. Haaland is on his heels in the middle. It allows Liverpool to break again and Gakpo thuds at Ortega. The game-state seems pretty set. 66 mins: Fantastic save from Ortega to deny Alexander-Arnold! He's done his chances of claiming the shirt full-time no harm today. Diaz gets to the second ball but then the flag goes up. That was another chance coming from the diminutive Lewis getting run over. 63 mins: Lewis is now in-field after the City changes and get gets gobbled up. Salah on the charge but it's another hit, wide and wild effort. Admittedly not with the goal at his mercy this time. 62 mins: Twice Dias clears from the edge of City's six-yard box. The Portugal centre-back didn't play at all during November and how his team have missed him during his ongoing ordeal. 60 mins: Doku is instantly committing people and there's a bit of pinball in the Liverpool box with Foden at the heart of it. The hosts need to hang in because there are surely more transition opportunities now. 58 mins: Doku and Savinho on for Gundogan and Nunes for City, who will have a more direct threat out wide. 56 mins: OH MY GOOD HEAVENS, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE MOHAMED SALAH! Akanji gets in a mess and Salah is through on goal. He could pass to Diaz if he wants. Instead he skies it into the City fans in the Anfield Road End. 55 mins: Silva drives City forward through midfield. He can't quite get Walker's drilled return ball under his spell and lofts over. Anfield now trying to rouse their team. 54 mins: Another poor delivery from Gundogan, but City at least snap into a couple of challenges to prevent the counter. They've competed better at the start of the second half. Oh, lads, what are you doing? Kelleher and Gomez doss around with it in the Liverpool box. Nunes steals in and wants a corner. Replays show he had a point. 53 mins: Akanji and Walker look to drive a City attack. The latter's cross is blocked but Lewis wins the second ball, over to Nunes who wins the corner. 51 mins: Alexander-Arnold takes and Van Dijk is there again, glancing onto the roof of the City net. 50 mins: City looking to work an angle down the Liverpool right. Foden wins a corner. Gundogan to take, Kelleher easily gathers Akanji's looping header. He rolls it to Robertson and City have gone asleep... Gakpo... brilliant tackle by Nunes, who is on a yellow card, remember. Liverpool corner. We're back underway. No changes for either side, although Savinho, Doku and Grealish were all going through energetic warm-ups during halftime. Liverpool will wonder how this is only 1-0, although they did take their foot off the gas after a raucous first 20 minutes in which Cody Gakpo scored and Virgil van Dijk hit the post. Guardiola has Grealish, De Bruyne, Savinho and Doku on the bench, Surely they form some part of a plan B, but the best City's current configuration offers in meandering damage limitation. 45 mins+2: Alexander-Arnold clouts one halfway up the Kop. City will take that and are a minute away from getting back to the sheds. 45 mins: Into three minutes of stoppage time. City attack with plenty of passes but no cutting edge. Then Liverpool win a couple of second balls and it's another Liverpool corner. Akanji is booked for a challenge on Gakpo earlier in the move. 44 mins: Nothing more than an accidental tread from Gundogan on Salah there but those do hurt and the Egyptian is furious. 42 mins: It's getting a bit scrappy now, with a sense that City want to scrap to halftime with things as they are. Given the red tornado they found themselves engulfed by early on, they'd certainly have taken 0-1 at that point. 39 mins: Better from City as Haaland sets one off to Lewis, who scuffs wide of the far post. One of those mis-hits that have goalkeepers fearing they might be on the end of some horrible misfortune. 38 mins: Diaz can't get the ball under his spell and tumbles as Ortega gathers. Again, the Colombian isn't especially interested in the crowd's penalty shouts. 37 mins: Gundogan sent tumbling about 35 yards out. Taken short. What are they doing. Then it's hoofed to Kelleher. An attack greeted fittingly during pantomime season by Anfield. 34 mins: Out to Alexander-Arnold on the edge. Ohhh, that was close and I'm not sure Ortega smelt it. 32 mins: Foden booked for tugging back Gravenberch, which is absolutely fair. However, he's aggrieved that the foul a few minutes ago in the other direction didn't see his opposite number cautioned. Liverpool get down the right and win another corner. 31 mins: Liverpool get back to it after unfussily soaking up a little pressure and Alexander-Arnold cannons a shot into Akanji. 27 mins: Some decent time in the Liverpool half here for the visitors, orchestrated by Foden. It ends with an Akanji cross in Haaland's direction that Kelleher is able to claim. 26 mins: City lack tempo and forward passing options. Liverpool harry them all the way back to Ortega, They play out nicely here and Gravenberch fouls Foden. 24 mins: City so tepid in possession end up reduced to booting kamikaze aerial balls across their own box. More by luck than judgement it became a promising attacking position but Nunes runs into Alexander-Arnold and then earns a booking for nibbling back at the England star. 22 mins: Robertson wins a corner. Van Dijk swaggers up for another go. Haaland boots clear at the near post. 19 mins: Van Dijk just wide! He has to score there. However, it already feels like missed Liverpool chances won't really matter, because there'll be loads more against opponents entirely ineffective in and out of possession. Now Gakpo lifts a good chance over. Mayhem in the City defence. 18 mins: City's press is non-existant. It means Alexander-Arnold can flight a glorious ball over the top for Salah. Ake is forced to concede a corner.  16 mins: Foden back on the field. I'm sure he'll have a lovely time. 14 mins: To compound things for City, Foden is now down in pain after a coming together with Gravenberch. City have started a lot of the games in their winless run well. They haven't here. There's no conviction and little indication of a plan. They're getting blown away at the moment. 12 mins: GOOOOAAAAAALLLLLLL!!!!! Cody Gakpo!!!! Boy has it been coming. Salah chases a raking ball down the flank. He arrows a fantastic ball across the box. Ortega can't get there and Gakpo taps home. 11 mins: Again, City can't play their way out. Szoboszlai with a blistering hit that Ortega saves. Nunez concedes a corner. Anfield is rocking.... Van Dijk heads against the post! 8 mins: City bodies in the way to block from Gakpo and Diaz, an Alexander-Arnold cross flies through the area. Ake is in pain from one of those blocks. The visitors are under siege, as we probably expected. 7 mins: Ake gives it away, Szoboszlai into that pocket on the right again, he picks out Gravenberch this time and Ortega saves. 6 mins: Szoboszlai drills in a low cross that Diaz can't control as he falls over. The Kop appeals for a penalty, Diaz doesn't. 4 mins: Excellent save from Ortega to deny Gakpo, but the flag goes up. He didn't know that and the sight of Gundogan getting ransacked in midfield is ominous for the champions. 2 mins: Salah fizzed a flat ball to the back post but it skips away from Gakpo. City win the toss and turn the team around, meaning Liverpool will attack the Kop during the first half. The visitors' first job will be to quieten down a crowd baying for blue blood. It looks like Lewis on the right flank for City, with Nunes on the left and Akanji stepping out of defence to support Gundogan and Silva in the middle. If there's any confusion there, Diaz is playing at centre-forward for Liverpool to take advantage. 4 mins before kickoff: Here are the teams. It is LOUD at Anfield. Pre-match pleasantries including You'll Never Walk Alone to come. 15 mins before kickoff: Arne Slot is a curious character in this whole tension-wracked occasion. Pep Guardiola is carrying all the usual intensity from his battles with Jurgen Klopp, the Liverpool faithful want to see their great tormentors demolished at a moment of vulnerability. Then there's Slot, a man who's simply turned up and won football games as if it's all a walk in the park. He looks wonderfully, enviably above the fray. Will he madness drag him in today? 40 mins before kickoff: So, let's dig into that big Manchester City talking point a little more. Stefan Ortega has, funnily enough alongside his opposite number today Caoimhin Kelleher, proved himself to be as good as any No. 2 in the Premier League. During the run-in to City's fourth consecutive Premier League title last season, he replaced the injured Ederson during matches three times. The first of those came after the Brazilian injured himself in the act of fouling Darwin Nunez in the penalty box in front of the Anfield Road End. Alexis Mac Allister converted and City had to settle for a 1-1 draw. A save that altered the destination of the 2023/24 Premier League title...👏 Stefan Ortega pic.twitter.com/MfGkb5d9iH Ortega was also called upon after halftime when City won 2-0 away at Nottingham Forest and Tottenham. In the latter game, his save from Son Heung-min with the game in the balance at 1-0 provided the defining moment of City's title triumph. During the close season, Ortega signed a contract to remain at City and Ederson was heavily linked with a move to the Saudi Pro League. He elected to stay and had played well up until the collapse against Feyenoord. Irrespective of whether today's big call contributes to a positive result for City, the fallout is likely to test Pep Guardiola's skills of diplomacy. 1 hour before kickoff: The Liverpool XI is a lot more settled, looks a lot more expansive and you sense they won't mind the look of the line-up Guardiola has decided upon. Trent Alexander-Arnold is back in at right-back with Conor Bradley injured, while Dominik Szoboszlai and Cody Gakpo get the nod over Curtis Jones and Darwin Nunez in midfield and attack respectively. Team news is in 👊🔴 #LIVMCI pic.twitter.com/fluG0mAkcy 1 hr 15 mins before kickoff: The teams are in and Ortega does indeed start for Manchester City, who have Ruben Dias back in their defence. Aside from Erling Haaland, it looks a team light on goal threat, with Jack Grealish, Kevin De Bruyne, Jeremy Doku and Savinho all on the bench. Your City side for #LIVMCI 🩵XI | Ortega Moreno, Walker (C), Akanji, Dias, Ake, Lewis, Gundogan, Nunes, Bernardo, Foden, HaalandSUBS | Ederson, Carson, Grealish, Doku, De Bruyne, Gvardiol, Savinho, O'Reilly, McAtee#ManCity | @etihad pic.twitter.com/v5dHmGN3V4 1 hour 40 mins before kickoff: Confirmed team news is 25 minutes away. Liverpool are looking fairly settled as you'd expect for a team in such form, with Ibrahima Konate's absence at centre-back the only major blot on Arne Slot's plans. There will be plenty of intrigue over what Pep Guardiola puts out there. He's famously gone for something a bit left-field on such occasions, with mixed results, and City's recent form gives him license to mix things up. One strand of speculation doing the rounds is that Ederson has been dropped after his part in the midweek collapse against Feyenoord and Stefan Ortega will start.  2 hours before kickoff: Hello and welcome to The Sporting News' live coverage of Liverpool vs. Manchester City. This fixture has almost always lived up to its lofty billing over recent years but the first encounter since Jurgen Klopp's departure from Anfield has a different feel about it. Arne Slot's Reds are swaggering at the top of the Premier League, while Pep Guardiola's usually imperious champions have been missing key personnel and are winless in six across all competitions. Another defeat today could effectively end their title defence. This Premier League match kicks off in Liverpool, UK at 4 p.m. local time. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories: Both goalkeeper Alisson and forward Diogo Jota are nearing returns from thigh and abdominal injuries, respectively, but Slot confirmed that neither would feature against City. Trent Alexander-Arnold returns to the lineup after the excellent Conor Bradley appeared to suffer a muscle issue towards the end of the Real Madrid game. The Reds' main absentee is Ibrahima Konate, with Joe Gomez coming in to partner Virgil van Dijk at centre-back. Slot is also without Kostas Tsimikas after the left-back injured his ankle in training, ruling one of the club's better performers in recent games out of two crucial contests this week. Dominik Szoboszlai and Cody Gakpo have got the nod over Curtis Jones and Darwin Nunez in midfield and attack respectively. Liverpool lineup (4-3-3, right to left): Kelleher (GK) — Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson — Szoboszlai, Gravenberch, Mac Allister — Salah, Gakpo, Diaz Substitutes: Jaros (GK), Davies, Endo, Nunez, Jones, Elliott, Quansah, Morton, Nyoni MORE: All the latest Liverpool news | Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings A key part of City's recent struggles has been multiple injuries, and top of the list is Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, who'll be fortunate to see any more action this season. Mateo Kovacic is out until Christmas or just before, courtesy of an injury picked up on international duty, ruling out the team's best stand-in option for the Spaniard. Ilkay Gundogan, Rico Lewis, Matheus Nunes and Bernardo Silva have all been selected to carry some part of the midfield load. Defender John Stones is out with a foot injury, but Jeremy Doku's quadriceps muscle complaint has progressed well enough for him to take a spot on the bench alongside compatriot Kevin De Bruyne. Ruben Dias, who was injured during the first defeat of City's winless run at Tottenham in the Carabao Cup in late October, returns to the heart of defence. The biggest sensation, though, came behind the backline where Ederson felt the consequences of his midweek mistakes against Feyenoord and Stefan Ortega was handed a start between the posts. Ortega's performances since joining City on a free transfer in summer 2022 have seen him earn a maiden senior call-up for Germany. During last season's corresponding fixture, he replaced Ederson and impressed after the Brazil international injured himself in the act of fouling Darwin Nunez in the penalty area. Man City lineup (4-2-3-1, right to left): Ortega (GK) — Walker, Dias, Akanji, Ake — Lewis, Gundogan — Silva, Foden, Nunes — Haaland Substitutes: Ederson (GK), Carson (GK), Grealish, Doku, De Bruyne, Gvardiol, Savinho, O'Reilly, McAtee If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.

On Sunday night, temperatures will dip into the low 20s with a 51% chance of snow. Snow showers hit Buffalo throughout the weekend. The team hired shovelers and snow plows to try and ensure the playing surface would not be impacted too much, but it is worth noting that Highmark Stadium's field is not heated. The forecast calls for a low of 20 degrees Sunday night. With wind speeds of 10 to 15 miles per hour, the temperature could feel slightly colder than what the reading calls for.

Kyle Shanahan's crew currently sits in last place in the NFC West at 5-6 and are outside of the playoff picture.  The good news is that all four teams in the division are sitting right around .500, with the Seahawks and Cardinals at 6-5 and the Rams also at 5-6. The next six weeks will determine who emerges from the contentious NFC West.  The bad news for San Francisco? The team has the seventh-toughest remaining strength of schedule the rest of the way, and it starts with a difficult task in Week 13 against the Bills in Buffalo. To make matters worse, the 49ers may have to play once again without starting quarterback Brock Purdy.  Purdy is dealing with an ailment to his right shoulder that kept him out of Week 12. Brandon Allen stepped in his place, but the veteran did not perform well, and San Francisco was blown out by Green Bay at Lambeau Field.  Will Purdy return in Week 13? Here is the latest on his status ahead of Sunday night's game.

However, he is expected to start on ""Sunday Night Football"" against the Bills, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.  49ers QB Brock Purdy, listed as questionable due to his shoulder soreness, did not experience any setbacks Friday or Saturday and is expected to start Sunday night vs. the Bills, per source. pic.twitter.com/AM0YTiTIyK The third-year quarterback for San Francisco was a limited participant at practice Wednesday and Thursday, but he did practice in full Friday. Schefter reported that Purdy did not suffer any setbacks Saturday, so it appears as though he will be under center for the defending NFC champions.  If his status does change before kickoff on Sunday night, Allen is expected to be the starting QB again for the 49ers.  WEEK 13 FANTASY FOOTBALL RANKINGS:QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/ST | Kickers Allen is behind Purdy on the depth chart and would be in line to start again if Purdy's injury is too serious for him to play. He started the Week 12 game against the Packers, which ended as an ugly 38-10 loss for the 49ers. Allen went 17-for-29 for 199 yards, a touchdown and an interception in the losing effort.  Behind Allen is Dobbs, who started 12 games just last year between the Cardinals and Vikings.

That story continued during the dangerous WarGames match at the Survivor Series event in Canada.  After months of fighting tooth and nail for an advantage, Roman Reigns and the Original Bloodline stood tall over Solo Sikoa and The New Bloodline. With the addition of CM Punk, which caused some initial tension, including who would enter the match, Reigns, The Usos, Sami Zayn, and Punk walked out of the deadly structure bruised, but also inflicted plenty of damage to the opposition.  The crowd of over 17,000 were on their feet as The Usos teamed up against Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa (Guerillas of Destiny in New Japan Pro Wrestling), while Jacob Fatu exited. He may have potentially blown his knee. Paul Heyman played the middle man in making sure Punk and Reigns co-existed. In the end, they worked together to take down Sikoa, the man who abused his power and got his comeuppance.  The family stood tall after a long time away. What's next for the Original Bloodline? Where do Reigns and Sikoa go from here? Is Fatu OK? Last but not least, what favor does Heyman owe Punk? Watch: WWE Survivor Series: WarGames 2024 replay on Peacock Gunther faced his most challenging task to date as World Heavyweight Champion when he successfully defended against former champion Damian Priest. Priest fought back and showed heart, even when Gunther took out both his arms. He even had an edge as the bigger man at one point, giving Gunther some confidence issues. Priest tried to put The Judgement Day behind him, but Finn Balor had different plans. He interfered in the match and distracted Priest, allowing an angry Gunther to attack Balor and pin Priest.  The rivalry between Balor and Priest continues. Who will Gunther face next?  The best match of Survivor Series saw Bron Breakker successfully defend the WWE Intercontinental Title against Sheamus and Ludwig Kaiser. Breakker continued his dominant reign, proving he is the future of WWE.  The story of the match was Sheamus vying for the one title he has never put around his waist. Kaiser also made it his mission for Sheamus not to win gold, involving himself in all aspects of the match. It resulted in him getting punished, though Sheamus did not leave the match unscathed.  crushed. pic.twitter.com/9Vis990wkj It resulted in a hard-hitting affair that will be remembered well.   In one of the biggest shocks of the night, Shinsuke Nakamura squashed LA Knight to become a three-time WWE United States Champion. Knight seemed out of it from the start, dropping his title as he entered the ring. Nakamura got into his head. He used it to his advantage, not giving Knight a chance to breathe.  Nakamura, a man reborn, holds gold once again. Will Knight try to get some revenge against the Japanese star? ☝️☝️😴☝️🙏☝️#SurvivorSeries #WarGames pic.twitter.com/l4MBjdghAJ The women's WarGames match opened the show and was as chaotic as expected. Bodies flew everywhere, especially Iyo Sky and Tiffany Stratton. Sky landed a moonsault on one side of the top of the cage while wearing a trash can. Meanwhile, Tiffany Stratton hit a Swanton off the other side of the cage.  Rhea Ripley, wearing a devil-like mask to protect herself from a previous injury, put herself in harm's way to get to rival Liv Morgan. The champion used a bat against Ripley but got too cocky. Setting up a table, Morgan eventually got slammed through it via a top-rope Riptide. The babyfaces stood tall.  The match didn't answer who took out Jade Cargill, allowing Bayley to enter the match, but perhaps we may find out on Raw or SmackDown. The next chapter of Morgan and Ripley's rivalry continues, while champion Nia Jax still has to keep her eye on Stratton, Ms. Money in the Bank. The Sporting News provided results, analysis, and match grades for WWE's latest Survivor Series event, featuring the WarGames match. Hello everyone, and welcome to The Sporting News' coverage of WWE Survivor Series! The U.S. and Canadian anthems are being sung, and we are underway. The women's WarGames match opens the show! It is Rhea Ripley, Bianca Belair, Bayley, Naomi, and Iyo Sky vs. The Judgment Day (Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriguez), Nia Jax, Tiffany Stratton, and Candice LeRae. Ripley is wearing a demon-like protective mask, as she is still healing from an injury. Bayley started the match for her team. Jax started for her team, who are all wearing black and white. Jax used her size to pummel Bayley early. The latter fought back as the timer slowly made its way to zero. Jax bounced Bayley's head into the cage. Naomi entered the match to help Bayley. She took out a kendo stick and a toilet seat. Using the stick, Naomi tried to weaken Jax. Jax used the stick and seat on both but they were used against her. LeRae entered the ring next, bypassing Stratton. She brought out chairs, which Jax used. Jax and LeRae worked well together as they pummeled their opponents. Belair entered the match, bringing in a table and a fire extinguisher.  Get the ... TOILET SEAT?! 🚽#SurvivorSeries #WarGames pic.twitter.com/70TMwc6uey Biana Belair brought some interest into this women's WarGames match by using her incredible skills. Stratton brought a trash can into the ring. Things picked up as Jax and Stratton worked together, landing blockbusters and clotheslines. Sky brought another garbage can, this time with rope, and climbed the cage. LeRae tried to bring her down, but Sky landed a big dropkick. Sky and Stratton showed off until Sky took control. Rodriguez entered the match and used her power to take over.  Jax and Rodriguez used their power to take down all of the face competitors. Ripley entered the match. She brought in a table. Things got exciting when all the weapons were used, as well as Belair's braid. Morgan entered the match, which means WarGames can officially begin. She brought a baseball bat. Ripley took off her mask. Ripley got attacked by everyone in the match and Ripley got hit in the gut with the bat. Ripley almost got handcuffed into the ropes.  Things start to break down with everyone landing big moves. Sky went to the top of the right side of the cage with the can and Stratton climbed the left. Sky wore the trash can and landed a moonsault. Stratton landed a Swanton to the other side. Wow.  🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯#SurvivorSeries #WarGames pic.twitter.com/tnIfCn7cZ3 Stratton had her Money in the Bank briefcase. Sky used a fire extinguisher. Rodriguez got handcuffed.

Belair tried to attack Morgan but a handcuffed Rodriguez took her down. Ripley tried to attack Morgan but Rodriguez interfered again. Morgan set up a table. Riptide from Ripley to Morgan from the top rope through the table for the win.  That match got good towards the end, but didn't have a proper flow outside it. We didn't figure out who took out Cargill. Still, it was entertaining and Ripley gets a measure of revenge on Morgan.  Grade: C+ LA Knight defends the WWE United States Title against Shinsuke Nakamura next. Nakamura used his kicks to get into Knight's head. An angry knight took control after some stalling, bullying Nakamura down to the floor. Back elbow by Nakamura took Knight off his feet. Knight with a Torture Rack to a Burning Hammer but only for two.  Nakamura with a kick to the back of Knight's head while on the top rope. He got dropped face first to the floor.

Wow.  We have a NEW United States Champion at #SurvivorSeries! pic.twitter.com/9JtLLF0sYW That was a squash match, which was surprising. Shinsuke Nakamura will get a big push, for how long is unknown.  Grade: B UFC welterweight champion Belal Muhammad is at Survivor Series. That TKO synergy is real. Bron Breakker defends the WWE Intercontinental Title against Sheamus and Ludwig Kaiser. The belt is the only one Sheamus has not won in his WWE career. Breakker and Sheamus broke the other down as Kaiser started on the outside. Sheamus tried to hurt the back of Breakker. Kaiser went in and out of the ring to take advantage of any opening. He wedged a chair between the ropes, but Breakker and Sheamus turned their focus to him. Breakker stood tall as he took both men down.  Kaiser intercepted Breakker who was looking for a spear. He hurt Sheamus and Breakker flew from out of nowhere to take down Kaiser. Breakker and Sheamus pummeled one another in the middle of the ring. Breakker landed a diving elbow over both of his opponents over the announce table. Sheamus finally landed the Ten Hits of the Bodhran, and Breakker got a few of his own.  Kaiser took Sheamus' shillelagh, but the latter used it against him. Sheamus and Breakker back in the ring, and they go after one another to the crowd's delight. Celtic Cross to Breakker but only for two. Frankensteiner by Breakker. Spear attempt but Sheamus moved, and he hit the chair on the corner. Brogue Kick by Sheamus, but Kaiser took the referee out. Kaiser beat Sheamus up with the shillelagh.

Spear to Sheamus and Breakker retained.  A fantastic match, exactly what the event needed. Sheamus continued to fight for the one title he never held, while Breakker looked like a million bucks. Kaiser looked good in the match and acted as a thorn in Sheamus' side.  Grade: A+  Damian Priest looks to once again hold the World Heavyweight Title when he challenges Gunther for the belt.  Gunther and Priest exchanged wrestling holds to start, showcasing their talent. Spinning kick attempt by Priest which forced Gunther out the ring to rethink his strategy. Priest used his long reach to take control of the match, which bothered Gunther.

Clothesline attempt by Priest got countered into a sleeper. Powerbomb attempt by Gunther but Priest fought out of it. Triangle choke from Priest.

Powerbomb to Priest, elbows, and a rear-naked choke for the win.  Déjà vu...#SurvivorSeries pic.twitter.com/ap6K9p8nEL What a match. These guys have great chemistry. Gunther is on my shortlist for Wrestler of the Year. The rivalry between Priest and Balor continues.  Grade: A  The men's WarGames match is next. The OG Bloodline (Roman Reigns, Jey and Jimmy Uso, Sami Zayn) and CM Punk take on The Bloodline (Solo Sikoa, Jacob Fatu, Tama Tonga, and Tonga Loa) and Bronson Reed. The New Bloodline (and Bronson Reed) entered as a unit. The OG Bloodline and CM Punk, individually. Tama Tonga started things off for The Bloodline. Jey Uso started for the OG Bloodline. Reigns stared down Punk while in their waiting cage.  Jey played to the crowd as he took down Tonga. Tonga took control, breaking down his body. Bronson Reed entered the match and brought in chairs. Jey threw the chairs at him, but he slapped them away. Senton by Reed. Jimmy entered the ring to help his brother. He cleaned house, and the Usos used old school tag team moves to have an edge.  Jacob Fatu entered the match. The Usos tried to gang up on him, but to no avail. Spinning elbow, cage splashes, rolling sentons to flips. The match is perfect for him. Punk tried to enter the match, Reigns stopped him, and Zayn took his spot. Zayn took care of Reed. Fatu got superkicked. Loa entered the match (with two tables) and The Bloodline took over.  Who else just got flashbacks?!#SurvivorSeries #WarGames pic.twitter.com/UpjVjK8yNJ Roman Reigns was going to enter WarGames and CM Punk pushed him aside to enter. Oh, it just got fun. Punk took out a tool box. He put Fatu's head to the tool box but Fatu got up and landed a Samoan Drop. Again, The Bloodline took over, just in time for Sikoa to come in. Sikoa hit the other members of The Original Bloodline with the cage.  Everyone was down as The Bloodline stood tall, mocking Reigns. Sikoa locked the WarGames cage with a chain. Reigns made his way to the cage but couldn't enter. He climbed up top, fighting his way through everyone. He flew on top of everyone with a crossbody. Reigns didn't help Punk up as the lines have been drawn. Heyman came out to make peace. The Original Bloodline took over, finally having an edge in the rivalry.  Fatu and Sikoa teamed up on Punk and Reigns. Reigns accidentally speared Punk. Sikoa spiked Reigns but only for two. Punk got hit with a variety of moves. Fatu might have blew his knee when attempting a moonsault. Spear by Reigns. Reed put Reigns on a table. On top of the cage, he missed a Tsunami as Punk saved Reigns. Reigns grabbed Punk back up, but Fatu managed to attack both. Spike by Fatu but The Usos hit a superkick.  Superkicks to Fatu. A 1D by Jimmy and Jey. Fatu on a table. Tonga tried to interfere but it was all for naught. Jimmy went to the top of the cage and landed an Uso Splash to Fatu. The Usos and Zayn brought everyone up.

Spear by Reigns for the win.  It all comes down to THIS!#SurvivorSeries #WarGames pic.twitter.com/5HBNzXWQmI Excellent match with a lot of storytelling involved.

On one end of the spectrum, Courtland Sutton scored 29.7 PPR points, his third time clearing 19 points in the last month. Jaylen Waddle also finally had his breakout performance, although it likely came on everyone's bench. Sutton and Waddle highlighted the positives, but Justin Jefferson was one of the major disappointments of the week. He scored fewer than five points for the first time this season. Somewhere out there, there's a team that started both Jefferson and Jordan Addison and can stomach Jefferson's tough outing thanks to Addison's 30.2 points.

But taking on the Ravens in Baltimore, Philadelphia will almost certainly have to air it out in what could be a back and forth matchup. The Ravens are giving up the most points to wide receivers this season, so look for Brown to eat in this monster of a matchup.  Nico Collins was on a bit of a snap count in Week 11 in his return from a hamstring injury, but he was a bigger force in Week 12 in a surprising loss to the Titans. Collins hauled in five catches for 92 yards and a touchdown, but his day could have been even bigger. He had a go-ahead touchdown called back late in the fourth quarter due to an illegal formation. With the Jags up next, it wouldn't be surprising to see Collins make up for it with a multi-TD effort.   The Steelers can be stingy at times and do have an effective pass rush, but Ja'Marr Chase is just on another level right now. He moves all around the field, and if the Steelers pay too much attention to him, then Tee Higgins will make them pay. With Cincinnati's defense finding it hard to stop anyone at the moment, the Bengals will have to air it out quite a bit to stay competitive. That bodes well for Chase.  There aren't any teams on bye in Week 13, with three games taking place on Thanksgiving on Thursday, Nov. 28. The Broncos, Colts, Patriots, Commanders, Ravens, and Texans will be on bye in Week 14.   The options left at wide receiver won't get many fantasy managers too excited, but a guy like DeMario Douglas can certainly help out in a pinch during bad bye weeks or if you're struggling with injuries. Douglas has at least four catchers and five targets in the last five games and has grown into one of Drake Maye's favorite targets. The Pats will have to take to the air more times than not in order to be competitive, so Douglas could come in handy down the stretch.  Adam Thielen made his return to the Panthers after being placed on IR with a hamstring injury. While he didn't light up the Chiefs, he looked spry pitching in three catches for 57 yards. He also drew what looked like a crucial pass interference in the end zone late in the fourth quarter. Carolina went on to score, giving the Panthers the improbably lead over the defending Super Bowl champs with just over a minute to play. But the defense couldn't hold up, and the Chiefs escaped with a victory. But with Bryce Young improving, Thielen could carve out a role for himself as rookie Jalen Coker battles a quad injury.  WEEK 13 FANTASY ROSTER MANAGEMENT ADVICEStock Watch | Start 'Em, Sit 'Em | Sleepers | Busts | Usage Report | Flex Finder | Weather Nick Westbrook-Ikhine continues to be a major player for the Titans since the departure of De'Andre Hopkins. While Calvin Ridley is clearly the alpha in this wide receiver group, Westbrook-Ikhine now has a TD in six of his last seven games. He only had two catches in Week 12 against the Texans, but they went for 48 yards and a score. Facing a leaky Commanders secondary this week, look for NWI to reach pay dirt yet again.  With the release of Daniel Jones, the Giants have turned to Tommy DeVito at quarterback. Getting the ball out quickly is the name of the game for Tommy Cutlets, and that plays right into the skill set of Wan'Dale Robinson. The slot receiver compiled his way to some productive games earlier in the season, but he's quieted down lately, as much of the Giants' passing game has. Robinson was able to rack up 47 yards on five catches in the losing effort. Robinson isn't a good bet for TDs, but given the volume he's likely to see, he could be a valuable asset once again, especially in PPR leagues.  The Bills will be coming off a bye, but prior to that Keon Coleman missed two weeks with a wrist injury. Updates on his progress have been scarce, so we're leaving him unranked at the moment.  DeVonta Smith had to sit out a Sunday Night Football matchup against the Rams in Week 12 with a hamstring injury. He's battled the same injury earlier in the season, so it's possible this is a reaggravation and he'll have to miss multiple weeks. There's no doubt Philly will do everything they can to have him ready for the Ravens, but his status is very much up in the air right now, so we're leaving him out of the rankings for now.  Brandin Cooks had been on IR with a knee injury, and his practice window to return began last week. He was unable to suit up against the Commanders in Week 12, so we're leaving him unranked for now. But there is still a chance he'll be active on Thanksgiving as the Cowboys host the Giants.  Romeo Doubs went down with a concussion in Green Bay's victory over the 49ers. If he can't go, look for Dontayvion Wicks to see an uptick in targets.  Josh Downs is week-to-week with a shoulder injury for the Colts, so he's been removed from the rankings, with Michael Pittman being the primary beneficiary. Adonai Mitchell and Alec Pierce may also see increased volume.  Ed Williams is a Fantasy Sports Editor at The Sporting News. A two-time Sports Emmy Award winner, he brings two decades of experience in sports media including a 16-year run at NBC Sports/Rotoworld, most recently as the Sr. Director of Content for Fantasy Sports and Sports Betting.

Guys like Joe Mixon, Bijan Robinson, Saquon Barkley, and Derrick Henry have been carrying teams to victories throughout the season. If you have any of these players on your roster, you're likely quite happy with how they've been performing. However, not everyone is lucky enough to roster a stud who's going to deliver them 15-20 points nearly every week. Some people have to decide if they want to start Rico Dowdle or Najee Harris each week. If that sounds like your team, hang in there and keep trudging along. Regardless of which end of the spectrum you fall on, it's important to evaluate your running back's outlook each and every week. With the Sporting News' running back rankings, you should know exactly how your team's running backs stack up with the rest. WEEK 13 FANTASY FOOTBALL RANKINGSQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/ST | Kickers Rankings based on PPR scoring. These rankings were updated on Dec. 1 and will be updated throughout the week, so check back often. Those who have played already are listed in italics. Despite the Texans putting up 27 points in a surprising loss to the Titans, Joe Mixon was only able to muster 22 yards on the ground. He did add five receptions for 23 yards as well. The one positive to take away from the game, though, is that Mixon was the only running back to touch the ball for the Texans. He's a true bell cow back, and this week's matchup against the Jags is the perfect bounce-back scenario. The Jags give up the second-most points to running backs, so look for Mixon to feast in Jacksonville.  The Jets are definitely a team that's reeling, but they're giving up the 10th-fewest points to the running back position. That being said, Kenneth Walker is the engine that makes the Seattle offense go. Walker has become a much bigger part of the passing game this year, which has taken his fantasy production to another level. It also gives his managers a little protection for those games in which they're just not moving the ball via the run. And as mentioned earlier, the Jets are a mess right now, and there's a chance the team just doesn't show up this week.  Jonathan Taylor struggled against the Lions in Week 12 against the Lions, but his matchup this week against the Pats should be much more favorable. He only had 11 carries in the loss against the Lions, but he had a combined 45 carries the two weeks before that. If he can get closer to the 20 touches, which should be doable as they're likely to be in a positive game script, then Taylor could have a splash week, which his fantasy managers have been waiting for.  There aren't any teams on bye in Week 13, with three games taking place on Thanksgiving on Thursday, Nov. 28. The Broncos, Colts, Patriots, Commanders, Ravens, and Texans will be on bye in Week 14. It is slim pickings on the waiver wire at this stage of the season, especially at the running back position. With both Alexander Mattison and Zamir White inactive on Sunday, Ameer Abdullah go the start for Las Vegas against the Broncos. It was a committee-approach with Abdullah, Dylan Laube, and Sincere McCormick, but Abdullah appears to be the leader of the committee and is also the preferred option in the passing game. If White and Mattison both have to sit again, Abdullah should have a big role against the Chiefs.   D'Andre Swift is the still the lead back in Chicago, but Roschon Johnson has been eating away at the goal line opportunities. While Johnson does have some minimal standalone value when facing weaker defenses, this would be more of a stash in case Swift has to miss any time later this season. He was questionable with a groin injury coming into this one, but was able to play through it.   WEEK 13 FANTASY ROSTER MANAGEMENT ADVICEStock Watch | Start 'Em, Sit 'Em | Sleepers | Busts | Usage Report | Flex Finder | Weather Nick Chubb still hasn't had a monster yardage game since returning from his devastating knee injury, but he did score two touchdowns on Thursday Night Football against the Steelers. The Browns have the Broncos up next, and the best way to attack Denver's defense is on the ground. While Jarome Ford gets involved at times, Chubb handled 20 carries against Pittsburgh in Week 12. Look for him to see plenty of volume against the Broncos.  Bucky Irving has proven he's the most electric runner in the Tampa Bay backfield, but Rachaad White continues to see plenty of carries. He's also typically very involved in the passing game. Mike Evans did return in Week 12, which could be a reason why White only had one reception. Irving hauled in six catches, so the backs were still getting plenty of targets - they were just all going to Irving in this one, and that was likely more of a fluke than by design. The Panthers give up the most points to running backs in the entire league, so there should be plenty of touches for both Irving and White in this one.  As mentioned earlier, Alexander Mattison (ankle) and Zamir White (quad) both had to sit this week. They didn't get in any practice all week and were listed as doubtful by Friday. Given that scenario, we've left them unranked for now. Check back often for updates on this situation, though.  All indications were that Isiah Pacheco was on track to make his return from a broken leg in Week 12, but he ended up inactive, giving Kareem Hunt another game as the Chiefs' bell cow back. Pacheco is now practicing in full, and barring a setback, he'll make his return on Black Friday. He's been added back into the rankings.  Austin Ekeler and Brian Robinson both suffered injuries in a surprising loss to the Cowboys. Robinson went down in the first play of the game in what looked to be an ugly leg injury, but he did return to the game. Ekeler went down with just 10 seconds left in the game after a brutal hit on a kickoff return. Ekeler actually landed on IR with the concussion, so Jeremy McNichols should see more action over the next month. And Chris Rodriguez should also receive more opportunities as well.   J.K. Dobbins suffered a knee sprain in the loss to the Ravens on Monday Night Football. While not believed to be a very long-term injury, the Chargers are being cautious and put him on IR to keep him fresh for the home stretch. Gus Edwards will be the first man up, and in addition to Hassan Haskins getting some reps, rookie Kimani Vidal will see additional touches as well.  Breece Hall, coming off a bye week, was a DNP with a soreness in his knee. We've adjusted him down a bit, but are leaving him ranked until we hear more concerning updates.  Ed Williams is a Fantasy Sports Editor at The Sporting News. A two-time Sports Emmy Award winner, he brings two decades of experience in sports media including a 16-year run at NBC Sports/Rotoworld, most recently as the Sr. Director of Content for Fantasy Sports and Sports Betting.

His latest victim was the Las Vegas Raiders, who he shredded for 273 yards and two touchdowns on his way to yet another QB1 finish in fantasy. If he's able to keep this up, we'll have a highly-contested race for OROY at the end of the season. One of the bigger storylines heading into Week 12 surrounded fellow OROY candidate Jayden Daniels. After starting off the year blazing hot, Daniels has failed to register a top-10 fantasy finish in seven straight games. Daniels silenced any doubters with a 30.4-point performance in a devastating loss to the Cowboys. Who will highlight the top fantasy storylines of Week 13? It's too early to say, but one thing is for certain, fantasy managers will have a lot to sift through as all 32 quarterbacks will be in action this week. If you don't want to pour over the matchup data on your own, don't worry, we've got you covered with the Sporting News' Week 13 quarterback rankings. WEEK 13 FANTASY FOOTBALL RANKINGSQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/ST | Kickers These rankings are based on four-point passing TD scoring. These rankings were updated on Dec. 1 and will be updated throughout the week, so check back often.  Those who have played already are listed in italics. Josh Allen is coming off a bye week, so he should be well-rested. It also means his banged up wide receiver corps should be healthier as well. While Keon Coleman's status is still uncertain as he continues to deal with a wrist injury, but Amari Cooper who's also banged up with a wrist injury should be in better shape. While Allen's rushing production has been down in general, he showed in the huge win over Kansas City that he's more than willing to take matters into his own hands when the situation calls for it. Allen seems to be heating up, so look for him to keep building up his MVP resume.  Jalen Hurts hasn't had to air it out as much this year with the arrival of Saquon Barkley, but he continues to be among the top fantasy QBs every week, thanks to the ""Tush Push"". Hurts has converted at least one of those for a TD the last five weeks heading into their Week 12 matchup with the Rams. But with the Ravens on tap this week, Hurts will also likely have to take to the air more. Baltimore has a stout run defense and is much more beatable in the passing game. Look for Hurts to pepper A.J. Brown with targets, and Dallas Goedert should be able to see success from the tight end position as well. The big question is whether DeVonta Smith will be healthier enough (hamstring) to suit up and give Hurts another dangerous target.  Joe Burrow is also coming off a bye, and he's been lights out. Burrow has thrown 12 touchdowns over his last three games, averaging 345 yards per game over that same stretch. The Steelers' pass rush can certainly pose problems for Burrow, but they're also beatable down field if he has time to throw. Pittsburgh is giving up the 5th-fewest points to quarterbacks this season, but Burrow is on another level right now, so we're not betting against him.  There aren't any teams on bye in Week 13, with three games taking place on Thanksgiving on Thursday, Nov. 28. The Broncos, Colts, Patriots, Commanders, Ravens, and Texans will be on bye in Week 14.     Don't look now, but that early-season benching may have actually done wonders for Bryce Young. Little by little, Young has been looking better each week since returning to the starting lineup. He was on the verge of knocking off the mighty Chiefs until the defense caved. But before that, Young looked impressive against what was considered one of the better defenses in the league. Young threw for 263 yards and a touchdown and did not throw an interception. He also rushed for 20 yards, and that was coming off of running for 30 yards against the Giants. If the rushing production becomes a stickier part of the equation, then he could be startable against weaker defenses, and Tampa Bay's leaky secondary ticks that box.  Jameis Winston looked like a little kid on Christmas morning during the Browns' improbable win over the Steelers in the snow last Thursday. Winston did give you the full Jameis Experience. He threw a pick, he lost a fumble, but he also led his team on a game-winning touchdown drive to close out the game. Winston is fearless and will throw it in any weather conditions and against any defense. But the reason to make this pickup is to try and deploy Winston when he's in a clear plus-matchup.   WEEK 13 FANTASY ROSTER MANAGEMENT ADVICEStock Watch | Start 'Em, Sit 'Em | Sleepers | Busts | Usage Report | Flex Finder | Weather Similarly to Young, Anthony Richardson's benching may have done him some good as well. While he didn't do much against the Lions in Week 12, he did look as good as he ever has in Week 11 against the Jets. Richardson was 20-for-30 for 272 yards and a touchdown. He also ran for 32 yards and two more touchdowns. And while Richardson didn't have a good passing day against the Lions in Week 12, he did run for 61 yards and protected the football well with zero turnovers. Facing the Patriots this week, it's fair to expect a performance closer to what we saw against the Jets. Russell Wilson struggled in the snow against a tough Cleveland defense in Week 12, but things should lighten up a bit this week as the Steelers travel to Cincinnati to face the Bengals. While Cincinnati can score in bunches, they can also give up points in bunches. The Steelers will surely want to pound the rock on the ground, but there should also be plenty of moonball opportunities for Russ as he tries to keep the emotional George Pickens involved in the offense.  The biggest injury at the quarterback position right now is definitely Brock Purdy. A shoulder injury proved too tough to play through as San Francisco ruled him out on Friday last week. Kyle Shanahan is saying he remains hopeful Purdy can return next week, but the last time we saw him on the practice field, he couldn't put any zip on the ball. Until we hear some positive updates, we're leaving Purdy unranked, which means Brandon Allen could get the call once again versus a very tough Buffalo defense. Joshua Dobbs is another option, and his mobility could also lead to him getting a chance if Purdy can't go as well. And of course, rumors continue to swirl that they may bring in Daniel Jones once he clears waivers on Monday.  The Jets are a mess right now, and there have been rumors that Aaron Rodgers may be playing much more hurt than he has been letting on. Ian Rappaport even reported that he may have been putting off getting scans in fear of what may be found as he doesn't want to miss any game action. We are leaving him ranked right now, but this is a situation to keep monitoring.  How banged up is Aaron Rodgers? It’s hard to say. Sources say he’s resisted getting scans done. From my story: https://t.co/XHOicpNIpX pic.twitter.com/CEQpGSZTFi Trevor Lawrence will be coming off a bye week, but he's also missed the last two games before that with an injured non-throwing shoulder. While he's not 100%, it sounds like he will be suiting up for Jacksonville against the Texans. With a chance of reinjury and facing a decent defense, we have tempered expectations for his performance in this one.  And Gardner Minshew suffered a broken collarbone during the Raiders' loss to the Broncos. Minshew is now out for the season, and it looks like the Raiders will activate Aidan O'Connell off IR to take his place.  Ed Williams is a Fantasy Sports Editor at The Sporting News. A two-time Sports Emmy Award winner, he brings two decades of experience in sports media including a 16-year run at NBC Sports/Rotoworld, most recently as the Sr. Director of Content for Fantasy Sports and Sports Betting.

Nobody can deliver a 40-point explosion quite like Hill. Considering he played six or seven different positions in that game, it might not even be fair to include him amongst the tight ends. Either way, fantasy managers will surely be thrilled to see him back in action this week. Without Hill in action, the tight end position was carried by Noah Gray and Jonnu Smith. If you took a trip back to draft season and asked who would be the scoring leaders in Week 12 at tight end, nobody would have been able to give you those two names. But hey, weird stuff happens at tight end all the time. Thankfully, there aren't any teams on bye this week, so most fantasy managers should be able to find a starting tight end without much of an issue. Even still, it's a good idea to consult a solid set of rankings to ensure you're making the right call in your TE slot. WEEK 13 FANTASY FOOTBALL RANKINGSQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/ST | Kickers Rankings based on PPR scoring. These rankings were updated on Dec. 1 and will be updated throughout the week, so check back often.  Those who have already played are listed in italics.  Travis Kelce has been on a tear in the last six weeks. He wasn't a part of the Chiefs' scoring frenzy in Carolina, but he still had a respectable 12.2 PPR points. Kelce is one of the few tight ends who's a weekly threat for eight-plus targets while maintaining strong red zone usage. He's a top-tier tight end for the rest of the year, and he'll contend for a TE1 ranking every week. Brock Bowers is on track to set the single-season record for receptions by a rookie, and he could legitimately lead the league in receptions this season. As you can imagine, this volume has allowed Bowers to thrive in PPR leagues. He's seen 10-plus targets in four of his last seven games and has finished as top-5 TE in each of those weeks. Given his usage and playmaking ability, he's firmly in the elite TE tier. Bowers is on a different level, but Trey McBride is capable of commanding targets at a high rate as well. His 0.26 targets per route run leads the team, and he's regularly out-targeted Marvin Harrison Jr. this season. The Vikings' defense has been known to generate pressure and create issues for opposing quarterbacks, so this could be a game with plenty of quick passes to McBride. If he could finally find the endzone, fantasy managers would be thrilled. There aren't any teams on bye in Week 13, with three games taking place on Thanksgiving on Thursday, Nov. 28. The Broncos, Colts, Patriots, Commanders, Ravens, and Texans will be on bye in Week 14. Given the lack of talent at wide receiver in New England, Hunter Henry is one of the few tight ends who can legitimately go out and lead their team in targets each and every week. He did just that in Week 12, the fifth time he's done so this season. His volume creates a respectable floor and the play-making ability of Drake Maye can help Henry reach his weekly ceiling by extending plays and making difficult throws. Somehow, Zach Ertz is still rostered in less than 50 percent of leagues. Week 12 marked Ertz's 7th TE1 performance of the year. He's also now seen at least seven targets in four of his last five games. Ertz requires a touchdown to finish as a top-5 weekly tight end, but with this sort of volume, he can be a reliable option with a steady floor. WEEK 13 FANTASY ROSTER MANAGEMENT ADVICEStock Watch | Start 'Em, Sit 'Em | Sleepers | Busts | Usage Report | Flex Finder | Weather When looking for a sleeper tight end, you're oftentimes simply looking for a tight end who will grab a touchdown to carry their fantasy output for the week. If that's the route you choose to take this week, Dalton Schultz might be your best option. The Jacksonville defense has been torched for 14 touchdowns in their last four games and has been liable to give up 30-plus points in any week. The hope here is that C.J. Stroud will lead the Texans to the red zone several times, and Schultz can snag a pass to cap off a scoring drive. At this point, Mark Andrews also falls into the ""touchdown or bust"" tier of tight ends. He's regularly rotating with Isaiah Likely and has just one TE1 finish in games in which he did not score. Thankfully, this should be a game environment where the Ravens' offense will be forced to score several touchdowns in order to win. Baltimore and Philadelphia have two of the most talented offenses in the league, and they could easily push each other into a track meet. Ideally, Andrews can get involved near the goal line and put six points on the board for the Ravens. Dalton Kincaid has been dealing with a knee problem that kept him out of action in the Bills' last game. Buffalo was on bye in Week 12, so Kincaid has been given plenty of time to recover. Kincaid's practice participation should give us an idea of his availability this week. Jake Ferguson missed Week 12 after suffering a concussion the week prior. Mike McCarthy has not yet provided an update on his status, but players are often able to return from concussions after missing one game. Look for Ferguson to be back in action this week. Rookie Ja'Tavion Sanders was carted off last week after suffering a scary neck injury. He was becoming a popular sleeper option at tight end, but it would be shocking to see him return in time for Week 13.

In the final three minutes of the Commanders and Cowboys game, we saw a missed extra point, two kicks returned for touchdowns, and an 86-yard touchdown from Terry McLaurin on a play where Dallas dropped all 11 defenders into coverage. Suffice it to say, if you missed the end of this game, make sure you catch the highlights. This wasn't the only matchup with nonsense in the final moments of the game. After converting a touchdown and two-point conversion with 22 seconds left in the game, the Chicago Bears recovered an onside kick to give themselves a glimmer of hope. Caleb Williams then found D.J. Moore for a 27-yard gain to set up Cairo Santos for a game-tying field goal as time expired. The Bears ultimately lost, but it required some unlikely plays on special teams to give them a chance. It's unlikely that we have two games like this in the same slate for the rest of the season. Even though it may not be as exciting, fantasy managers still have to fill their D/ST slot this week. Let's see where each defense stacks up in our rankings. WEEK 13 FANTASY FOOTBALL RANKINGSQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/ST | Kickers These rankings were updated on Dec. 1 and will be updated throughout the week, so check back often. Those who have played already are listed in italics. The Denver Broncos' defense has been fantastic throughout the year. All-Pro cornerback Patrick Surtain has played a big role in leading Denver's top-10 pass defense. Jameis Winston has created some memorable moments this season, but it's hard to see him getting the best of Surtain and company. The Broncos can be started with confidence in Week 13. The Chiefs' defense hasn't been as dominant as they were in 2023, but they still have been among the league's better defensive units this season. They're a top-10 group in terms of both total defense and scoring defense. As long as they can contain Brock Bowers on Sunday, it should be a quiet day for the Las Vegas offense. The Washington Commanders come in as our D/ST3 on the week. Over the last six weeks, Washington has shown an ability to completely shut down inferior opponents. We saw this in action in Week 7 when they held the Panthers to 7 points and 180 yards of offense. Will Levis and the Titans have a similar caliber of offense and don't pose a threat to many NFL defenses. The Commanders are a premier fantasy option this week as they should be hungry to avenge an ugly loss to the Cowboys. WEEK 13 FANTASY ROSTER MANAGEMENT ADVICEStock Watch | Start 'Em, Sit 'Em | Sleepers | Busts | Usage Report | Flex Finder | Weather There aren't any teams on bye in Week 13, with three games taking place on Thanksgiving on Thursday, Nov. 28. The Broncos, Colts, Patriots, Commanders, Ravens, and Texans will be on bye in Week 14. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have not been known for their defensive prowess this season. In fact, they rank toward the bottom of the league in nearly every defensive efficiency metric. However, a matchup with the Panthers can jumpstart any defense. This is an offense that's failed to hit 200 yards of offense more often than they've cleared 400 yards. Whenever the Panthers are on the schedule, the opposing defense immediately becomes a viable fantasy option. Taysom Hill and Marquez Valdes-Scantling have been making some miraculous plays in recent weeks, but the Saints are still an offense with a limited arsenal of weapons. Hill and MVS aren't going to be ripping off 70-yard plays every week and this profiles as an offense to target with defensive streamers. The Rams can be the defense to put an end to the Saints' nonsense on offense and they're a fringe starter this week.

For the matchup, the Patriots have listed seven players as inactive, including safety Marte Mapu. Joining Mapu on this are wide receiver K.J. Osborn, guard Lester Cotton, guard Tyrese Robinson, defensive end Titus Leo, defensive tackle Jaquelin Roy and quarterback Joe Milton III (emergency third quarterback). The Patriots are getting safety Jabrill Peppers back after his reinstatement from the NFL's commissioner's exempt list. That could be a huge boost to a defense that really needs it. New England also decided not to activate offensive lineman Cole Strange ahead of this meeting with the Colts, so the former first-round pick will have to wait to make his return after suffering a torn patellar tendon late last season.

Most notably, Ka'imi Fairbairn missed a game-tying 28-yard field goal as the Texans fell to the Titans. This was his third miss inside of 30 yards in his career. The Commanders were down seven points to the Cowboys with 30 seconds remaining in Washington. Terry McLaurin miraculously scored an 86-yard touchdown to give the Commanders a chance to go to overtime. Somehow, Austin Seibert missed the extra point, his first missed PAT of the year. There seems to be no in-between with kickers this year, they're either drilling 60-yarders or missing routine kicks. Even though there have been some dramatic swings in performance, there are still numerous kickers who can be relied upon each week in fantasy lineups. WEEK 13 FANTASY FOOTBALL RANKINGSQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/ST | Kickers These rankings will be updated throughout the week, so check back often.  Those who have played already are listed in italics. Chris Boswell has single-handedly won two games for the Steelers this season. No, he hasn't nailed two game-winners, the Steelers have scored on exclusively field goals on their way to two victories this season. Boswell's heavy usage has led to him scoring 15-plus fantasy points three times this season. Against a struggling Cincinnati defense, he could realistically attempt four field goals this week. Outside of the brutal miss last week, Ka'imi Fairbairn has been a stud for the Texans all year long. He's made 84 percent of his field goals and has been a top-5 kicker throughout the season. This week, the Texans get a Jacksonville defense that has allowed their opponents to score 28-plus points in three of their last four games. Houston should be in Jacksonville territory quite often, and Fairbairn should have a handful of PAT and field goal attempts. Typically, we want to target kickers who are attached to potent offenses. In the case of Jake Bates, the Lions' offense might be too good. The Lions offense scores touchdowns at such a high rate that Bates is often kicking extra points instead of field goals. He now has four games this season with five-plus extra point attempts. Even with his attempts being heavily skewed towards PATs, Bates is a weekly starter given the strength of the Detroit offense. WEEK 13 FANTASY ROSTER MANAGEMENT ADVICEStock Watch | Start 'Em, Sit 'Em | Sleepers | Busts | Usage Report | Flex Finder | Weather There aren't any teams on bye in Week 13, with three games taking place on Thanksgiving on Thursday, Nov. 28. The Broncos, Colts, Patriots, Commanders, Ravens, and Texans will be on bye in Week 14. Despite being an appendage of the Philadelphia offense, Jake Elliott has largely been an afterthought in fantasy leagues this season. However, he should be in starting consideration this week. The Eagles face the Ravens in what should be the most fantasy-friendly game environment of the week. Baltimore has struggled to contain their opponents through the air this season, meaning Jalen Hurts should be able to lead the Eagles on numerous scoring drives, which lead to kicks for Elliott. The return of Tua Tagovailoa has elevated the fantasy outlook for several players in Miami, including kicker Jason Sanders. He's now scored double-digit points in three of his last four games while scoring nine points in the fourth. The Dolphins' matchup with the Packers could also lead to the two offenses trading punches, which would be tremendous for Sanders. He should be in lineups everywhere this week.

The Buckeyes have consistently been a top-five program year in and year out under his watch, as he has never finished a season with more than two losses.  So how is it that Buckeyes fans are vehemently calling for Day to be fired? Look no further than Saturday's result.  Ohio State fell victim to rival Michigan in one of the worst results in the history of the rivalry. The Buckeyes came into rivalry week ranked as the No. 2 team in the country with just one loss on their record, while the Wolverines sat unranked at 6-5. Despite that, it was Michigan that left The Shoe victorious, coming out with a 17-14 win.  If there is one thing ingrained into the culture at Ohio State, it's that you simply do not lose to Michigan, no matter the circumstances. However, Saturday's loss marked the fourth year in a row that the Buckeyes came out on the wrong side of ""The Game,"" and it has Ohio State fans calling for Day to be fired.  MORE: What Ohio State’s loss to Michigan means for Big Ten, College Football Playoff Will Ohio State pull the trigger on the head coach? Here's what to know about Day's status following the loss to Michigan.  It's unclear in the immediate aftermath of the Ohio State loss to Michigan if Day will lose his job. However, if it were up to the Ohio State boosters, no change is coming.  Day would have to be bought out of his current contract with the university, and it won't be cheap. His buyout is reportedly at $37 million, and while the Buckeyes boast a massive booster program, that number may be too large for a change, according to reporter John Bacon.  Apparently Day's buy-out is going viral on Ohio media.It's $37M, and insiders tell me OSU boosters have no appetite for it, with NIL demands, and the like. FYI. The Buckeyes' season is not yet over, with a Big Ten Championship set for next weekend, as well a berth to the College Football Playoff. While it won't be completely wiped away, a conference championship followed by a national championship would go a long way to erasing the sour memories of the Michigan loss.  With that said, if the Buckeyes end the season once again without a trophy to show for it, questions will emerge about Day's security going forward.  Since Day took over the program in the middle of the 2018 season, he owns an ugly 1-4 record against rival Michigan. He won his first game against the Wolverines in 2019. The two teams did not play in the shortened 2020 season. Since then, it's only been losses for the Buckeyes, with four consecutive defeats at the hands of ""That Team Up North."" In comparison, Day owns a record of 45-1 against the rest of the Big Ten.  MORE: Projecting College Football Playoff bracket for championship week It's not just the rivalry games that Day has fallen short in. The Buckeyes haven't played in the Big Ten Championship since 2020 He also has not experienced an immense amount of success in bowl games either. Ohio State lost in the 2019 Fiesta Bowl to Clemson, missing out on a chance to play for the national championship. In 2020, the Buckeyes got their revenge against the Tigers in the Sugar Bowl, but then fell to Alabama in the national championship.  Ohio State has not been to the title game since. The program did not make the College Football Playoff in 2021, settling for a Rose Bowl win over Utah instead. That was followed by a loss to Georgia in the Peach Bowl in 2022, missing out on the national championship, and then the program failed again to make the College Football Playoff in 2023.  Ryan Day wins the 90% of games Ohio State is always going to win with its inherent talent advantage. He’s shown no evidence that he’s capable of winning big games or rivalry games. But anybody who’s mentioned that the last four years has been labeled a psycho. The rest of this season could dictate Day's fate. If he brings a national championship to Columbus for the first time since 2014, all likely would be forgotten from rivalry week.  MORE: College football bowl projections for championship week However, if it's another season with a similar ending to those in the past for Day and the Buckeyes, the boosters may change their mind.  Since Day took over the Buckeyes program in the middle of the 2018 season, Ohio State has been a dominant force in college football. Ohio State has never ended a season with more than two losses, as Day has compiled a record of 66-10 as of Dec. 1, 2024.  MORE: Ohio State, Michigan players get into brawl over flag planting Here's a look at his season-by-season results at Ohio State.  * = record as of Dec. 1, 2024.  Day is currently signed with Ohio State through the 2026 season. He is the fifth highest-paid head coach in college football, earning $9.95 million in 2024 , according to USA Today's coaches salaries database. MORE: College football top 25 rankings for conference championship week If Ohio State chose to fire Day, the university would owe him $37.28 million as of December 1, 2024, according to the database. His buyout is not one of the largest among active head coaches, but it is not an insignificant amount. There are 16 head coaches in college who would be paid more in a buyout than the Buckeyes' boss.  Bryan Murphy joined The Sporting News in 2022 as the NHL/Canada content producer.

Johnson has been a hot name around the league for head-coach vacancies in recent years due to his success in Detroit. But would he really consider taking the Bears' job in 2025 if offered? On Sunday morning, ESPN's Adam Schefter said that Johnson may have interest in the job, which is a change from what he said earlier in the month. “Everybody’s gonna have their eyes on Ben Johnson, the Lions offensive coordinator, and I think he might have some interest in that job,"" Schefter said. ""We’ll see if they can convince him to come to Chicago.” During an appearance on ESPN's ""Get Up"" on Nov. 7, Schefter said something very different about Johnson's potential interest in going to Chicago. ""Ben Johnson is going to be very, very selective about the place that he chooses to go, if he decides even to leave Detroit. He's going to be very careful,"" Schefter said. ""I don't know that Ben Johnson desires to leave and head into the division to go to a place where you're talking about the dysfunction that has existed within that organization."" It's easy to see why Johnson could have interest. The Bears have a promising young quarterback in 2024 No. 1 overall pick, Caleb Williams, a solid supporting cast on offense and defense, and Chicago is slated to have $82 million in cap space in 2025, according to Over the Cap. But the Bears are not exactly the epitome of a well-run organization, as we saw yet again with how the team let Eberflus go after he did his day-after press conference following his epic blunder in Week 13 against the Lions that led to his firing. Whether or not the Bears' history of dysfunction will be enough to outweigh all the positives Chicago's job has remains to be seen, but Johnson possibly jumping ship for the Lions' division rival will be one of the most interesting storylines to follow this offseason.

Sports Weez,What is a Trebles Bet? Learn the Secrets of Advanced Betting,https://sportsweez.com/what-is-a-trebles-bet/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 11:28:41 +0000","A trebles bet is not just another random term in the world of sports betting. It’s the betting equivalent of putting all your eggs in three carefully chosen baskets, hoping each pays off in cascading glory. Unlike your typical single bet, where one outcome makes or breaks your day, a trebles bet rolls the dice [&#8230;]","A trebles bet is not just another random term in the world of sports betting. It’s the betting equivalent of putting all your eggs in three carefully chosen baskets, hoping each pays off in cascading glory. Unlike your typical single bet, where one outcome makes or breaks your day, a trebles bet rolls the dice three times, multiplying your potential winnings in a way that feels almost magical—but it’s not magic. It’s strategy, risk, and a dash of guts. Imagine this: it’s Saturday, and the football lineup has your favorite teams ready to clash. You spot three matches with juicy odds and outcomes you feel confident about. Maybe Manchester United is on fire, Arsenal is showing championship form, and Chelsea is just looking solid. Instead of betting separately on each team to win their respective matches, you combine these three predictions into one powerful trebles bet. Now, you’re not just rooting for one team; you’re living and dying by the collective success of all three. Here’s the kicker—your initial stake works harder than a lone wolf bet ever could. Let’s say you place $10 on a trebles bet with three selections, each with odds of 2.0. If the first bet wins, your $10 doubles to $20, which then rolls over to the second bet, turning it into $40 if that wins, and finally to $80 if the third selection also hits. That’s $80 from a mere $10 bet! But—here’s the catch—all three outcomes need to be perfect. One loss? Game over. It’s the ultimate all-or-nothing approach. Some people swear by trebles betting because of the high-risk, high-reward dynamic. You’re essentially wagering your confidence across multiple events, and that creates this electric feeling of anticipation. It’s like betting on a domino rally, knowing the smallest wobble can ruin everything, but also knowing the rush when they all fall perfectly in place is unmatched. The beauty of trebles bets isn’t just in the potential payout. It’s in the strategy. This isn’t a scatter-gun approach to betting where you pick random teams or outcomes. You need to know your stuff. Are you diving into football stats? Tracking player injuries? Noticing patterns in underdog victories? A trebles bet rewards the sharp bettor who can combine knowledge with intuition. It’s like building a house of cards. Patience and precision are everything. But let’s not sugarcoat it—trebles betting can burn you faster than you realize. Many novice bettors fall into the trap of overestimating their knowledge or getting seduced by big potential payouts. Remember, the risk is amplified with each selection. If even one of your three choices fails to deliver, the whole bet collapses. For casual bettors, trebles might seem daunting, but for those who thrive on calculated risks, it’s like the Holy Grail of betting. A real-life example helps make this concrete. Let’s say you place a trebles bet on these outcomes: You wager $10. If Manchester United wins, your $10 turns into $25. Then Arsenal wins, taking that $25 to $45. Finally, Chelsea pulls off the draw, turning your $45 into a massive $135. That’s over ten times your original stake. But if even one of these results doesn’t go your way? You lose the entire $10. It’s a razor’s edge between triumph and despair. Trebles bets are often the playground of intermediate to advanced bettors who’ve got a decent grasp of the sport they’re betting on. They understand how to spot value in odds and how to hedge their risk elsewhere, if needed. Sure, there’s always luck involved, but successful trebles betting feels less like blind luck and more like threading a needle while riding a roller coaster. If you’re thinking about diving into trebles betting, start small. Experiment with low stakes while you get the hang of spotting value. Track your wins and losses meticulously, and resist the urge to bet with your heart instead of your head. And always remember: the higher the odds, the lower the probability. Trebles betting is exhilarating, but it’s no place for reckless gambling. So, what’s the secret to trebles bets? Confidence, preparation, and knowing when to walk away. It’s not for the faint of heart, but for those who love a challenge and the thrill of multiplied odds, there’s nothing quite like it. Play smart, and you might just hit the jackpot."

No longer are we confined to rigid odds and uninspiring options; bet builders have redefined how we gamble.

Sports Weez,What Is a Bet Builder? Simplified Guide to Betting Smart,https://sportsweez.com/what-is-a-bet-builder/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 11:26:13 +0000",A Bet Builder is the holy grail of personalized betting. It’s that perfect tool that turns a standard sports wager into a customized masterpiece crafted entirely by you. Imagine you&#8217;re watching your favorite soccer team play this weekend—let’s say it’s Arsenal vs. Manchester United—and you’ve got a hunch about everything from who’s scoring to how [&#8230;],"A Bet Builder is the holy grail of personalized betting. It’s that perfect tool that turns a standard sports wager into a customized masterpiece crafted entirely by you. Imagine you’re watching your favorite soccer team play this weekend—let’s say it’s Arsenal vs. Manchester United—and you’ve got a hunch about everything from who’s scoring to how many corners are happening. A Bet Builder lets you pack all those predictions into a single bet, creating a one-of-a-kind ticket with skyrocketing odds. Here’s the magic: you’re not stuck with boring, one-dimensional bets anymore. Traditionally, betting meant picking one outcome—like which team wins, maybe the total goals, or the halftime result. But a Bet Builder throws open the doors to creative possibilities. You can combine markets like “Both Teams to Score,” “Over 2.5 Goals,” “Bukayo Saka to Score Anytime,” and even “Total Match Cards Over 3.5” into one compact bet. The more selections you add, the higher the potential payout—but, and here’s the kicker, every single part of the bet needs to hit for you to cash in. This feature works brilliantly for people who know the sport inside out and feel like they’ve got a crystal ball about how a match will unfold. It’s as if you’re assembling your dream scenario—like Lego blocks for gamblers. For example, if you’ve been watching Manchester United’s erratic form lately and know they’re good for a defensive lapse, you could build a bet like this: Marcus Rashford to Score Anytime, Over 9.5 Total Corners, and Arsenal to Win. Boom. Now, you’re rooting for multiple layers of action instead of just sitting there, biting your nails over a single outcome. But don’t be fooled into thinking this is easy money. Bet Builders are risky. You’re essentially linking multiple predictions, and one wrong turn—say, Rashford misses an easy tap-in or the referee decides to keep his cards in his pocket—and your bet is toast. This is why it’s often referred to as a “high-risk, high-reward” style of betting. It’s not for the faint-hearted, but for the thrill-seekers who want that adrenaline-pumping, multi-faceted action. What makes Bet Builders especially exciting is their versatility across sports. While they started as a staple for soccer betting, they’ve expanded into basketball, tennis, American football, and even niche sports. Fancy a basketball game? You could combine “Steph Curry Over 30.5 Points,” “Golden State Warriors to Win,” and “Total Team Assists Over 20” into one glorious bet. Tennis, you say? Build a bet on “Rafael Nadal to Win, Over 9.5 Total Aces, and Second Set Over 10.5 Games.” The options are almost limitless. Here’s where it gets even better: Bet Builders are incredibly user-friendly. Most online sportsbooks now have dedicated sections for them, with a sleek interface where you can toggle through markets and see your odds update in real time. Platforms like Bet365 and FanDuel lead the charge, offering intuitive Bet Builder tools that even a first-timer can figure out. And let’s not forget the thrill of seeing those odds stack up with each added prediction—nothing beats the dopamine rush of watching your custom odds climb higher and higher. A word of advice, though: don’t go wild stacking every prediction under the sun. The allure of massive odds is strong, but a ticket with ten legs (selections) is more likely to crash than a house of cards in a hurricane. Stick to what you genuinely believe will happen, and don’t throw in “fun” picks just for the thrill. It’s called betting smart for a reason. In the end, a Bet Builder is more than just a betting tool—it’s an experience. It transforms passive viewing into edge-of-your-seat excitement, where every corner, shot, and card matters. You’re not just watching the game; you’re living it, predicting its twists and turns like a modern-day sports oracle. And when it all comes together and your custom bet hits? That’s the stuff legends are made of."
Sports Weez,Gambling vs Betting: Key Differences You Need to Know,https://sportsweez.com/gambling-vs-betting/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 11:13:36 +0000","Gambling and betting—two words often tossed around interchangeably—aren’t quite the same, even though they walk hand-in-hand through the thrilling world of chance.

They’re like cousins at a family gathering: closely related, but with distinct personalities. If you’ve ever found yourself wondering where one ends and the other begins, buckle up. This ride’s about to get interesting. Let’s cut to the chase: gambling is the umbrella, while betting is a snug, specific corner under it. Gambling encompasses a wide variety of activities, from slot machines winking at you with promises of jackpots, to rolling dice in high-stakes games, to buying lottery tickets in the hopes of becoming a millionaire overnight. It’s an expansive, unpredictable universe where the outcome often relies solely on luck. You’re playing against the house, the odds, or even fate itself. Betting, on the other hand, has a bit more swagger and calculation. Think of it as gambling’s more disciplined sibling. Betting is essentially wagering on an event where the outcome may be uncertain, but you’re making an educated guess. Whether it’s betting on your favorite sports team, the outcome of a horse race, or even quirky things like which celebrity might name their baby after a fruit next, betting feels like it has strategy baked into it. Sure, there’s risk, but it’s not just blind chance—it’s an informed roll of the dice. Now, here’s where the plot thickens. If you’ve ever been at a sports bar during the Super Bowl, you’ve probably witnessed the betting frenzy firsthand. That guy yelling at the TV about a missed touchdown? He isn’t just upset about the game—he’s likely got a few bucks riding on the result. That’s the charm of betting; it’s rooted in something tangible. Unlike a slot machine, where you’re up against cold, calculated algorithms, betting lets you rely on knowledge, gut feelings, or pure fandom. But don’t let betting fool you into thinking it’s risk-free. If gambling is a wild roller-coaster, betting is a slick poker game. Both can clean out your wallet if you’re not careful. Gambling often seduces with its glitz and glamour—casinos are built to dazzle, after all. The sights, the sounds, the free drinks—they’re not just perks; they’re part of the plan to keep you playing. Betting, however, hooks you with the illusion of control. Think you know your football stats better than anyone? Put your money where your mouth is. Spoiler alert: the universe doesn’t always care about your research. There’s also a cultural twist to this. Gambling carries a certain mystique, often seen as a high-stakes affair tied to smoky poker rooms or bustling Vegas floors. Betting, meanwhile, has gone mainstream, with legalized sports betting apps making it feel as casual as scrolling through social media. One feels larger than life, while the other is woven into everyday conversations. Still, at the heart of it, both gambling and betting tap into the same primal urge: the thrill of risk. Humans love to gamble in every sense, whether it’s with money, emotions, or life decisions. It’s about the high of the unknown—the “what if” that keeps us coming back for more. And while betting may feel more calculated, let’s be honest, it’s still a gamble. So, what’s the takeaway here? If you’re venturing into this world of risks and rewards, know thyself. Are you here for the adrenaline rush of a high-stakes poker game, or do you fancy yourself a sports genius who can outsmart the odds-makers? One isn’t inherently better than the other; they just cater to different vibes. Gambling is for the dreamers, the “all or nothing” folks who are ready to spin the wheel of fortune. Betting? That’s for the tacticians, the ones who like to believe they’re playing with their heads, not just their hearts. At the end of the day, whether you’re spinning slots or analyzing game stats, the key difference between gambling and betting boils down to your mindset and approach. Both are thrilling, risky, and capable of delivering sky-high rewards—or devastating losses. The real question is: how much are you willing to risk, and what kind of thrill are you chasing?"
Sports Weez,Courtside Betting Secrets: How to Outplay the Odds Live!,https://sportsweez.com/courtside-betting/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 11:12:11 +0000","Courtside betting isn’t just a game-changer; it’s the adrenaline-fueled arena where the sharpest bettors thrive. Imagine this: you’re sitting courtside, watching the sweat drip from players as they fight tooth and nail, milliseconds ahead of the TV broadcast. You’re not just a spectator—you’re part of the game, exploiting every split-second advantage. This is the realm [&#8230;]","Courtside betting isn’t just a game-changer; it’s the adrenaline-fueled arena where the sharpest bettors thrive. Imagine this: you’re sitting courtside, watching the sweat drip from players as they fight tooth and nail, milliseconds ahead of the TV broadcast. You’re not just a spectator—you’re part of the game, exploiting every split-second advantage. This is the realm of courtside betting, and if you’re not in it, you’re playing catch-up. Let me paint the scene for you. A friend of mine once got last-minute tickets to an NBA game. Courtside seats, the holy grail for any sports fan. While the rest of us marveled at his luck, he was busy doing something far more interesting. Every time a buzzer-beater landed or a turnover flipped possession, he was glued to his phone. Not texting, not tweeting—betting. By the time the game ended, he’d walked out with more than just memories. He’d turned those seats into a personal ATM. So, what’s the secret sauce? It’s simple: speed, strategy, and the ability to read the game like a seasoned coach. When you’re courtside, you have access to real-time information that online bettors sitting at home can only dream of. TV broadcasts? They’re lagging behind, often by as much as 5–10 seconds. That’s an eternity in sports, where a single play can flip the odds. Courtside bettors capitalize on that delay, placing wagers on outcomes before sportsbooks adjust. It’s like seeing the cards before your opponent plays them. But don’t think it’s all easy money. The sportsbooks know courtside betting exists, and they’re not going to hand over their profits without a fight. They’ll suspend betting during critical moments or tighten the odds faster than you can refresh your screen. That’s where your strategy comes in. First rule: know your game inside and out. If you’re courtside at a basketball game, you better understand the players, the coaches, and the momentum swings. Courtside betting isn’t for casual fans; it’s for those who can feel the energy of the game and predict what comes next. For example, a player who’s gassed after back-to-back possessions might miss an easy free throw. A team that just nailed two three-pointers is probably going to lean on that hot hand for their next possession. Second rule: pick your moments. The beauty of courtside betting is the sheer number of opportunities it gives you. Live bets are dynamic, constantly shifting with the game’s flow. Don’t rush to place bets on every play; instead, wait for those moments where the odds misalign with reality. A team down by 10 in the first quarter? Odds might undervalue them, but if you know their second-half performance is killer, that’s your window. Finally, there’s the human element. Being courtside gives you access to the players’ body language, interactions, and emotions in a way TV never could. A star player arguing with the ref might signal frustration, or a bench player warming up could indicate an impending substitution. These subtle cues give you an edge—a way to predict the unpredictable. Of course, like any form of betting, courtside wagering isn’t without risks. You’re going to lose some bets, no matter how sharp you are. But that’s part of the thrill. The key is managing your bankroll, staying disciplined, and not letting the highs or lows cloud your judgment. So, how do you get started if courtside tickets are out of reach? You don’t have to be physically in the arena to benefit from courtside betting principles. Follow live streams or faster data sources and practice reading the flow of the game. And if you ever do land those golden tickets, treat them as more than a chance to brush shoulders with the elite. They’re your shot at mastering the art of courtside betting and outplaying the odds in real time. Every game has its players, and every bet has its bettors. But courtside? That’s where the real players show up."

Odds are the lifeblood of betting. They determine how much you could win, reflect the probability of an event happening, and even reveal subtle insights into what bookmakers think about a game or race. Let’s strip away the mystery and break it down into bite-sized pieces. Imagine this: You’re eyeing a horse race. The bookmaker offers odds of 5/1 on a horse named Lucky Shot. What does that mean? It’s shorthand for “you’ll win $5 for every $1 you bet,” plus you get your original stake back if you win. That’s fractional odds, which are super common in the UK. They’re simple enough, but they can look intimidating when the numbers balloon, like 25/7. Thankfully, other formats exist, like decimal odds, which are more popular in Europe and growing in the US. With decimal odds, the math becomes ridiculously easy. If Lucky Shot’s odds are 6.0, all you do is multiply your stake by the odds. Bet $10? You get $60 if you win. And yes, that includes your original stake. Clean and straightforward. But what about American odds, also known as moneyline odds? They flip the script entirely. Positive odds like +500 show how much profit you’d make on a $100 bet, while negative odds like -200 tell you how much you need to bet to win $100. Here’s the kicker: odds aren’t just payout calculators—they’re windows into probabilities. Bookmakers use complex algorithms to estimate how likely an event is to occur. Let’s say a team has odds of 2.0 in decimal form. This implies a 50% chance of winning, calculated as 1 divided by the odds (1/2.0 = 0.5). For fractional odds like 5/1, it’s 1/(5+1) = 0.166, or about 16.7%. This is called the implied probability, and it’s a crucial piece of the betting puzzle. But don’t be fooled into thinking bookmakers offer a direct reflection of reality. Odds include a profit margin—often called the overround—that tilts things in the bookmaker’s favor. If you sum up the implied probabilities of all possible outcomes in a match, they usually exceed 100%. That extra percentage is their edge, ensuring they come out ahead in the long run. It’s like playing blackjack against a house with a loaded deck. You can win, but the odds aren’t naturally stacked in your favor. Now, what about those swings in odds you see leading up to a big event? That’s the market talking. Odds shift based on factors like injuries, weather, or even a flood of bets on one side. It’s not just the bookmaker adjusting for new information—it’s also a strategy to balance their books and minimize risk. If too much money flows to one outcome, the bookmaker risks a massive payout if it hits, so they tweak the odds to encourage bets on the other side. Knowing how to interpret and use odds is where the fun—and strategy—comes in. Are you spotting value? This is when the odds offered by the bookmaker suggest a lower probability than you believe to be true. For example, if a bookmaker gives odds of 4.0 (25% implied probability) on a team you think has a 40% chance of winning, you’ve found a value bet. These golden opportunities don’t come around often, but hunting for them is half the thrill. At the end of the day, understanding odds is about leveling the playing field. The more you grasp how bookmakers calculate and adjust them, the better your chances of finding those edges that make betting exciting. So whether you’re diving into football, tennis, or even esports, remember this: the odds aren’t just numbers—they’re a map to smarter betting. Grab your compass and start exploring."
Sports Weez,Betting on Correct Score: The Secrets to Winning Big!,https://sportsweez.com/betting-on-correct-score/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 11:04:29 +0000","Betting on the correct score isn’t for the faint of heart.

It’s the high-risk, high-reward adrenaline rush of the betting world, where a single goal can either send you into ecstasy or leave you clutching your ticket in despair. But let’s be honest—there’s something intoxicating about nailing a prediction down to the exact score. It’s not just betting; it’s clairvoyance with a payday. The key to succeeding in correct score betting is recognizing that it’s not just about luck. Sure, luck plays its part, but if you rely solely on fortune, you might as well flip a coin. The real magic lies in strategy, research, and understanding the beautiful game in a way most bettors don’t. You need to be part analyst, part psychologist, and part mathematician to come out ahead in this tricky market. Start with the basics: Know your teams inside out. Look at their form, not just in terms of wins and losses, but how they score and concede goals. A team like Manchester City might crush weaker opposition with a flurry of goals, while a defensive powerhouse like Atletico Madrid thrives on 1-0 wins. Patterns matter. Study the head-to-head history, too—some matchups consistently produce high-scoring thrillers, while others are more subdued. Then there’s the all-important factor of context. Is it a league game or a cup final? Is one team desperate for points, while the other is comfortably mid-table with nothing to play for? Even weather conditions can sway a game’s flow. A rainy day might favor a scrappy 1-1 draw rather than an explosive 4-3 shootout. Every detail counts when you’re narrowing your bet down to a single scoreline. Here’s a pro tip most casual bettors overlook: Focus on the likely rather than the flashy. Betting on a 5-4 thriller might offer sky-high odds, but how often do you see a score like that? Instead, target common outcomes like 1-0, 2-1, or 1-1, especially in games where defenses are solid and attackers are clinical but not wasteful. Sure, the payouts may not be as jaw-dropping, but they’re still lucrative enough to be worth your time. Now, let’s talk bankroll management—because no matter how confident you feel about a prediction, putting all your eggs in one basket is a recipe for disaster. Correct score betting is volatile by nature. Even the savviest punters only win a fraction of the time. Spread your bets wisely, perhaps placing smaller wagers on multiple plausible outcomes for the same game. This hedging strategy can mitigate losses and keep your bankroll intact for future wagers. Another insider trick? Leverage in-play betting. Watching a game unfold can provide critical insights you simply can’t predict beforehand. A team starting the game aggressively might indicate they’ll score early, while a defensive setup could hint at a low-scoring affair. Adjust your bets based on the flow of the match to improve your chances of landing that golden scoreline. And let’s not forget the psychological side of things. Betting on the correct score can mess with your head if you’re not careful. It’s easy to get caught up in “near-misses”—that painful 2-1 bet when the game ends 3-1—or let a big loss push you into chasing your money. The trick is to stay cool and stick to your game plan, win or lose. Emotional betting is sloppy betting, and that’s a quick ticket to losing it all. Of course, there’s a seductive thrill in chasing underdog scorelines with astronomical odds. Who doesn’t dream of hitting the jackpot with a bold 4-2 prediction in a Champions League clash? But these long shots should be treated like a lottery ticket: fun, exciting, but not something you rely on for consistent winnings. Keep your ambitions grounded in probabilities, not pipe dreams. Finally, don’t underestimate the value of technology. Use stats and data from trusted sources to inform your bets. Advanced metrics like xG (expected goals) can help you gauge a team’s offensive and defensive tendencies more accurately than traditional stats. Combine this with tools that track betting trends to understand where the smart money is going. The more informed you are, the better your odds of winning big. Correct score betting isn’t easy, but that’s what makes it so rewarding. The thrill of getting it right, of outsmarting the bookies, is unmatched. If you approach it with discipline, patience, and a solid strategy, you can turn the odds in your favor. Just remember, this game is a marathon, not a sprint. Celebrate the wins, learn from the losses, and keep chasing that perfect scoreline—it’s out there waiting for you."
Sports Weez,Why Shots on Target Betting is Perfect for Football Fans,https://sportsweez.com/shots-on-target-betting/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 10:59:49 +0000","Football betting has come a long way from just picking winners and losers.

If you’re a true fan who spends matchday shouting at the screen about how your team “just needs to shoot,” shots on target betting might be your calling. It’s not only an exciting way to engage with the game, but it also rewards those of us who obsess over stats and know the ins and outs of players’ performances. So, let’s talk about why this type of betting could become your favorite—and why it’s a perfect fit for football fanatics. First things first: what is shots on target betting? It’s exactly what it sounds like. You’re betting on how many shots on target will be recorded in a game, by a specific player, or even across an entire team. For those who aren’t stat nerds, a shot on target is any effort that would have gone into the net if it weren’t for a save by the goalkeeper or a defensive block. Simple enough, right? Now, here’s why it’s a thrill. Shots on target bets don’t care about who wins or loses the match. You could bet on a striker to have at least three shots on target, and whether their team gets smashed 4–0 or pulls off a miraculous win, your bet still holds as long as they hit their target quota. For fans tired of nail-biting over final scores, this opens up a whole new world of stress-free excitement. Imagine this scenario: you’re watching Manchester United play Liverpool. You’ve got a bet on Mo Salah to have over 2.5 shots on target. You don’t care about the result anymore—every time Salah gets the ball near the box, you’re on the edge of your seat. A curling attempt from outside the box? Yes, please! A rapid-fire volley after a corner? Even better. It’s like turning every attacking move into your personal mini-game within the match. What makes shots on target betting so special is how it rewards football knowledge. Casual fans might not think twice about how often Kevin De Bruyne shoots or how Bruno Fernandes loves a speculative effort from distance, but seasoned fans know these details like the back of their hand. You’ve seen Harry Kane hit five shots on goal against Burnley or noticed how Jack Grealish’s positioning guarantees at least a couple of decent chances every game. This inside knowledge is pure gold when it comes to placing these bets. Another big appeal? Flexibility. Shots on target betting offers a variety of options to suit your preferences. Want to back a specific player? Go for it. Want to bet on a team as a whole to have over eight shots on target? It’s all yours. Feeling particularly bold? Combine it with other bets in an accumulator and watch the potential winnings soar. It’s not about predicting a winner anymore—it’s about knowing the rhythm of the game, the patterns of play, and the habits of the players. One of the best parts about shots on target betting is that it keeps even the dullest games interesting. Picture this: a drab, goalless stalemate between two mid-table sides. Normally, you’d be counting down the minutes, hoping the final whistle comes quickly. But if you’ve got a bet riding on someone like Ivan Toney or Ollie Watkins to hit a shot on target, every moment suddenly has stakes. A breakaway in the 85th minute could turn your boring game into an unforgettable winner. Let’s not ignore the tactical side, either. Modern football is dominated by data—xG (expected goals), possession stats, heat maps, you name it. Managers have favorite strategies, and players have tendencies. If you know a team plays high-pressing football and forces their opposition into mistakes, you can predict more shots on target. Conversely, a deep-lying defensive team might make it hard for the opposition to rack up too many clean strikes. Understanding this layer of the game gives you an edge over casual bettors. Of course, no betting discussion is complete without mentioning discipline. It’s easy to get carried away when your favorite player is involved, but always remember: stats over sentiment. Cristiano Ronaldo may be a legend, but is he averaging enough shots on target lately to justify a bet? If the numbers say yes, go for it. If not, save your money. Betting smart is always more satisfying than betting blindly. Ultimately, shots on target betting isn’t just a wager—it’s an invitation to immerse yourself in the intricacies of the sport. It’s for the fans who yell, “Take the shot!” during every attack, the ones who analyze every match like a scout, and the dreamers who believe every counterattack is a chance for greatness. It’s the perfect blend of passion, strategy, and adrenaline. So, the next time your team lines up for kickoff, why not make every shot count?"

<h1>Canucks Triumph Over Bruins, Thanks to DeBrusk's Stellar Return and Lankinen's Impenetrable Guard</h1>
<p>In a riveting display of skill and strategy, the <a href=""https://21sports.com/petterssons-power-play-prowess-propels-canucks-over-flames/"">Vancouver Canucks</a> clinched a 2-0 victory against the <a href=""https://21sports.com/pastrnaks-late-strike-seals-bruins-thrilling-comeback-victory-over-blues/"">Boston Bruins</a> on a chilly Tuesday night. The Canucks were powered by Jake DeBrusk's impressive power-play goal and Kevin Lankinen's formidable guard with 32 saves.</p>
<h2>DeBrusk's Exciting Homecoming</h2>
<p>Returning to Boston after seven seasons, DeBrusk, now a Canucks' star, reminded the Bruins what they're missing. He skillfully poked a rebound 5:53 into the second period, marking his third goal in two games and his 16th point in November alone. DeBrusk had recently shown his prowess by scoring twice and assisting once in a narrow 4-3 victory against Ottawa on Saturday.</p>
<h2>Lankinen's Unyielding Defense</h2>
<p>Lankinen's exceptional performance was a critical part of the Canucks' victory. He impressively blocked 13 shots in the second period, followed by another 11 in the third. With about 25 seconds left on the clock, he masterfully thwarted Brad Marchand's attempt to sneak the puck through, securing his second shutout of the season.</p>
<h2>Canucks' Noteworthy Achievements</h2>
<p>The Canucks were also buoyed by the return of forward Brock Boeser, who had been sidelined for seven games due to an upper-body injury sustained on November 7. The team celebrated their eighth consecutive road victory and improved their record to 5-2-2 when they score first. DeBrusk's hot streak continued with him racking up five points in his last five games.</p>
<h3>Bruins Struggle Under Interim Leadership</h3>
<p>The Bruins, now led by interim coach Joe Sacco after Jim Montgomery's recent firing, fell to 2-1. They struggled to make a mark during the game, being held shotless during their fourth power play, which was met with audible frustration from the home crowd.</p>
<h3>Key Game Moments and Stats</h3>
<p>The game's pivotal moment came when Boeser was penalized for interference midway through the third period. However, the Canucks turned the tables and dominated the next two minutes, leaving the Bruins scoreless. In terms of stats, Vancouver outperformed Boston in hits (30-29) and blocked shots (26-11).</p>
<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
<p>The Canucks are set to face off against Pittsburgh on Wednesday night, while the Bruins will be visiting the New York Islanders. The thrilling season continues, and hockey fans are eagerly awaiting the results.</p>

Despite Florida’s efforts to equalize in the final moments, Foligno sealed the deal for the Blackhawks with a decisive empty-netter with just a minute left on the clock. Despite a couple of golden opportunities, the Panthers couldn’t capitalize, leaving the ice empty-handed. The Stanley Cup champions, with Spencer Knight stopping 17 shots, experienced their fourth loss in five games. Blackhawks’ coach Luke Richardson was on the lookout for a more spirited performance from his team following their capitulation of a 2-1 lead in the third period against the Ducks. His team did not disappoint, presenting a resilient front, particularly in the game’s final stages. A noteworthy moment of the game came when Blackhawks’ defenseman Wyatt Kaiser was benched for delay of game 12:22 into the third period. Despite this setback, the Blackhawks successfully killed off the penalty, rendering the Panthers’ power-play opportunities futile. Foligno boasts an impressive record against Florida, with 10 goals and 14 assists to his name in his career against them. The Panthers are set to kick off a three-game homestand against Colorado on Saturday night, while the Blackhawks will travel to Philadelphia for their next game on Saturday.

<h1>St. Louis Blues Snatch Victory from Sharks, Putting an End to Home Losing Streak</h1>
<p>Jake Neighbours emerged as the shootout star, while Jordan Binnington defied all three attempts by the <a href=""https://21sports.com/robertson-shines-bright-as-dallas-stars-overpower-san-jose-sharks/"">San Jose Sharks</a>, leading the <a href=""https://21sports.com/st-louis-blues-triumph-over-tampa-bay-lightning-in-thrilling-ice-showdown/"">St. Louis Blues</a> to a 3-2 triumph on Thursday night. This win ended a four-game home losing streak for the Blues. Binnington displayed resilience by bouncing back from Alexander Wennberg's equalizing goal with only 8.8 seconds remaining, securing his 151st career victory. This tied him with Mike Liut's franchise record.</p>
<h2>Standout Performances</h2>
<p>Wennberg was the lone double-goalscorer for the Sharks, with Mikael Granlund and <a href=""https://21sports.com/macklin-celebrinis-overtime-goal-fuels-san-jose-sharks-victory-over-detroit-red-wings/"">Macklin Celebrini</a>, the 2024 NHL draft's top pick, providing assists for both goals. For the Blues, Jordan Kyrou and Nathan Walker found the back of the net during regulation time. This marked only the second victory in their last nine matches.</p>
<p>Walker's goal came just 11 seconds into the game, thanks to Radek Faksa's interception of a pass from Sharks' goalie Yaroslav Askarov. Later, Kyrou, positioned between Granlund and Timothy Liljegren, nudged home a pass from Pierre-Olivier Joseph for his sixth goal of the season, with 8:13 remaining in the second.</p>
<h2>Goalkeeper Highlights</h2>
<p>Binnington held the fort with 22 saves, contributing significantly to the Blues' victory, while Askarov managed 29 saves.</p>
<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<p>The Sharks, who have been outscored 28-10 in the season's first period, struggled from the onset, despite netting a first-period goal for the third consecutive game. On the other hand, Binnington, with 295 games under his belt, stands second among goalies in Blues' franchise history. He reached the 151-win milestone in 56 fewer games than Liut, whose record from 1979-1985 stood at 151-133, with 52 ties.</p>
<h3>Game-Changing Moment</h3>
<p>Neighbours played the hero, delivering the shootout victory with a wrist shot that outsmarted Askarov on his glove side.</p>
<h3>Key Statistics</h3>
<p>The Blues have been outscored 14-2 in the third period across their last seven games.</p>
<h3>What's Next?</h3>
<p>The Blues are set to play seven out of their next eight games on the road, commencing Saturday against the New York Islanders. The Sharks, on the other hand, will start a four-game homestand against Buffalo the same day.</p>

<h1>Werenski's Overtime Goal Brings Columbus Blue Jackets a Remarkable Comeback Victory</h1>
<p>Zach Werenski's masterstroke at 1:25 of the overtime session marked the climax of a thrilling game as the <a href=""https://21sports.com/los-angeles-kings-emerge-victorious-in-dominant-performance-against-columbus-blue-jackets/"">Columbus Blue Jackets</a> overcame a three-goal deficit to triumph over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/vasilevskiy-shines-with-stellar-saves-as-lightning-strike-devils-4-0/"">Tampa Bay Lightning</a>, in an electrifying 7-6 victory on Thursday night. Werenski, shining in the spotlight, equalized the game at 4 in the second period and contributed with three assists, helping the Blue Jackets secure their second consecutive win.</p>
<h2>Key Players in the Clash</h2>
<p>Sean Monahan and Dmitri Voronkov greatly supported their team with a goal and three assists and a goal plus an assist, respectively.

<h1>Colorado Avalanche Triumphs Over Washington Capitals in Nail-Biting Encounter</h1>
<h2>Miles Wood Fires Avalanche to Victory</h2>
<p>In an electrifying Thursday night showdown, Colorado Avalanche clinched a tight 2-1 win over <a href=""https://21sports.com/capitals-dominate-avalanche-in-thrilling-5-2-victory-a-night-of-twists-and-triumphs/"">Washington Capitals</a>, with Miles Wood playing the hero as his third-period goal became the decider. Mikko Rantanen, another Avalanche star, also found the net, marking the team's fifth victory in their last six outings.</p>
<h2>Alexandar Georgiev Continues Winning Streak</h2>
<p>Alexandar Georgiev, the formidable Avalanche goaltender, demonstrated his mettle with an awe-inspiring performance that saw him repel 29 shots. This marked his fourth consecutive win after returning from an upper-body injury that sidelined him for two games.</p>
<h2>Capitals Feel the Absence of Ovechkin</h2>
<p>For the Capitals, it was Pierre-Luc Dubois who scored, but the team's winning spree came to an abrupt end, halting at three victories. Logan Thompson, the Capitals goalkeeper, experienced his maiden regulation loss of the season with 25 saves. Earlier, the team was dealt a significant blow as Alex Ovechkin, their superstar, was ruled out for four to six weeks due to a broken left fibula, sustained during their Monday clash against Utah.</p>
<h3>Avalanche's Takeaways</h3>
<p>Despite Nathan MacKinnon failing to score for the second time in three games — both against the Capitals — Rantanen maintained his impressive form, securing points in five of his last six games.</p>
<h3>Capitals' Takeaways</h3>
<p>Without Ovechkin's presence, the Capitals found it difficult to generate momentum offensively. Their usually effective power play, often energized by their captain, went 0 for 2.</p>
<h2>Key Moment of the Match</h2>
<p>The defining moment came just 3:29 into the third period when Wood, positioned at the front of the net, deflected Cale Makar's point shot, sending it past Thompson for the lead.</p>
<h2>Crucial Statistic</h2>
<p>A telling statistic dating back to the 2021-22 season reveals that the Capitals have a dismal 4-14 record without <a href=""https://21sports.com/ovechkins-decisive-strike-propels-capitals-to-victory-over-predators/"">Ovechkin</a> in the team. At the time of his injury, the captain was leading the league with 15 goals, only 27 short of Wayne Gretzky's record.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>The Avalanche is set to square off against the reigning Stanley Cup champions, Florida, on Saturday, while the Capitals will host New Jersey.</p>

<h1>Golden Knights Prevail Over Senators in Hard-Fought Match</h1>
<p>In a hockey game that kept fans on the edge of their seats, the Vegas Golden Knights claimed victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/tkachuks-overtime-magic-propels-senators-to-victory-over-bruins/"">Ottawa Senators</a> with a nail-biting 3-2 score on Thursday night. Ilya Samsonov, who had let in 10 goals over his last two games, bounced back with a remarkable performance, pulling off 38 saves.</p>
<h2>Samsonov's Key Saves Halt Senators' Attack</h2>
<p>Despite the Senators' aggressive play, Samsonov held strong, making crucial saves against formidable players like Josh Norris, David Perron, Tim Stutzle, and Brady Tkachuk. The Senators (8-10-1) find themselves trapped in a four-game losing streak, having scored just two goals throughout their last three games.</p>
<h2>Golden Knights Gain the Upper Hand</h2>
<p>In the initial phase of the game, the Golden Knights (12-6-2) seized control when Linus Ullmark made a spectacular diving save but failed to reposition quickly enough. This left Jack Eichel with an unhindered shot to the net, marking his sixth goal this season. Brett Howden extended their lead to 2-0 in the mid-second period, slipping a goal past Ullmark, who had 29 saves in the game.</p>
<h3>Sensational Third-Period Action</h3>
<p>Adam Gaudette managed to get one past Samsonov 7:17 into the third period, narrowing the lead. However, the Senators' joy was short-lived as Pavel Dorofeyev restored the two-goal lead just two minutes later. Drake Batherson kept the Senators' hopes alive, scoring a goal off a Jake Sanderson rebound with a little over seven minutes left. Despite the Senators outshooting the Golden Knights 18-5 in the third period, they fell short of a comeback.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways and Statistics</h2>
<p>A recurring issue for the Senators has been their habit of conceding the first goal, which has led to eight consecutive losses and a dismal 1-9-1 record when they let in the first goal. On the other hand, the Golden Knights capitalized on an ill-timed Ottawa line change, delivering a swift counter-strike leading to Howden's goal. The Golden Knights have an impressive 12-1-1 track record against the Senators since their entry into the league in 2017.</p>
<h3>What's Next for Both Teams?</h3>
<p>Looking ahead, the Senators are gearing up to host the Vancouver Canucks on Saturday night, while the Golden Knights prepare to face off against the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday afternoon.</p>

Jack Hughes, with three assists under his belt, maintained his robust performance for New Jersey. He is currently second on the team with 25 points, including eight goals. On the other hand, the Hurricanes announced on the same day that veteran goaltender Frederik Andersen is scheduled for knee surgery and will be absent for the next eight to 12 weeks. Andersen, with a record of 3-1-0 this season, will be sorely missed, as Martin fell to a 1-2-0 record. A key moment in the game was when Markstrom denied all seven shots aimed by Carolina in the second period, maintaining it as a one-goal contest. The Devils showed their home prowess with a record of 5-3-2, and an impressive 8-4-0 on the road. The Devils are scheduled to face the Washington Capitals on Saturday, while the Hurricanes will be visiting the Columbus Blue Jackets on the same day.

<h1>A Nail-biting Victory for Detroit Red Wings against New York Islanders</h1>
<p>In a thrilling showdown, <a href=""https://21sports.com/lucas-raymond-inks-lucrative-eight-year-contract-with-detroit-red-wings/"">Lucas Raymond</a>'s incredible goal in the final seconds helped the Detroit Red Wings to a 2-1 victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/islanders-thrilling-rally-overcoming-penguins-in-post-regulation-showdown/"">New York Islanders</a> on Thursday evening. Jonatan Berggren's crucial equalizer also played a pivotal role in breaking Detroit's run of three consecutive losses. The Red Wings' goaltender, Alex Lyon, displayed a remarkable performance with 22 saves.</p>
<p>For the Islanders, the only ray of hope came from Simon Holmstrom, who managed to score the sole goal for his team, unable to reverse their pattern of losses with five out of their last six games ending in defeat. Despite a valiant effort with 29 saves, Islanders' goalie Ilya Sorokin couldn't prevent the defeat.</p>
<h2>The Turning Points of the Game</h2>
<p>Holmstrom sparked the Islanders' spirits by scoring the first goal of the match at 5:51 of the first period, marking his third goal of the season. However, Berggren, with just 4:46 left in the game, managed to level the score with his third goal of the season. The decisive moment came when Raymond, with a skillful assist from Dylan Larkin, netted the puck from the left circle, beating Sorokin's glove with just 51 seconds to spare.</p>
<h3>Key Takeaways from the Game</h3>
<p>The Islanders, despite having the league's worst penalty-kill entering the game, successfully thwarted three power plays from the Red Wings, who boast the second-best power play in the league. Sorokin was instrumental in this, making six crucial saves.</p>
<p>In contrast, Raymond, who had an impressive tally of 31 goals last season, ended his scoring drought with a game-winning goal in the final minute, providing a much-needed boost to the Red Wings.</p>
<h2>Flashback and Key Statistics</h2>
<p>Recalling the teams' first encounter last month, which saw the Red Wings triumph with a 1-0 victory thanks to Patrick Kane's first-period goal, it seemed history might repeat itself with Holmstrom's early goal. However, the Red Wings turned the tide with two goals in the final five minutes of the game.</p>
<p>A noteworthy stat from the game revolves around the Red Wings' knack for comebacks last season, boasting an 11-24-3 record when trailing after two periods. This season, however, they had a 0-8-0 record when down after two periods, a statistic they managed to overturn with their late rally in this game.</p>
<h3>What's Next for the Teams?</h3>
<p>Looking forward, the Islanders will be hosting St. Louis on Saturday, while the Red Wings will welcome Boston to their home ground.</p>

Bedminster, New Jersey. (Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images) For professional golfers, the pursuit of peak physical and mental condition is a constant endeavor. One wrong move, one bad swing, or one mismanaged meal can be the difference between victory and defeat. For Phil Mickelson, a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis in 2010 was a wake-up call that forced him to reevaluate his approach to health and wellness. With the help of his friend and performance coach Dave Phillips, Mickelson began to focus on his overall well-being, leading to a significant transformation in his life. He lost 30 pounds in 2021, and his newfound emphasis on wellness helped him to feel more energized and focused on the golf course. Phillips’ passion for wellness and nutrition led to the creation of The Good Stuff coffee packets, a healthier coffee option that provides a natural energy boost without the negative side effects. Mickelson was a big fan of the product, and the two soon began brainstorming other healthy products that could complement it. Phillips spent countless hours researching and experimenting with different ingredients, determined to create products that would help people to feel their best. His hard work paid off, and The Good Stuff coffee packets quickly became a hit among golfers and non-golfers alike. The success of The Good Stuff coffee packets led to the creation of For Wellness, a brand that offers a range of healthy food and beverage products. In addition to The Good Stuff coffee packets, For Wellness also offers low-calorie Superfood Energy Bites and high-antioxidant coffee pods. With For Wellness, Mickelson and Phillips aim to help others achieve their wellness goals and improve their overall health and performance.

Not only that, Mickelson’s one routine has been proved successful. Phil Mickelson's wellness journey: Is his 6-day fast the ultimate health hack or just a fad? Debate Phil Mickelson’s journey to wellness began with a 6-day coffee and water fast, which he undertook to reset his body and mind. With the help of his performance coach, Dave Phillips, Mickelson had crafted a special coffee blend that he believed would help him power through the fast. The fast was a game-changer for Mickelson, who reported feeling more energized and focused than he had in years. Inspired by Mickelson’s success, Sean Zak, a journalist from (link unavailable), decided to follow in his footsteps and try the 6-day coffee and water fast for himself. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Zak’s experience was not easy, especially in the first two days. Hunger pangs were intense, and he found himself craving all sorts of foods that he normally took for granted. But as the days went by, he began to feel a strange sense of clarity and focus. The coffee blend, which Mickelson had dubbed “The Good Stuff,” seemed to be working its magic. Zak was able to power through his days with ease, and he even found himself enjoying the feeling of hunger, which he had come to realize was not as unbearable as he had thought. By the end of the six days, Zak had lost 11 pounds and felt like a new person. The true test of the fast came after it was over. Would Zak be able to maintain the healthy habits and sense of discipline that he had developed during the fast? The answer, happily, is yes. With Mickelson’s guidance, Zak has been able to stick to a healthier diet and exercise routine, and he’s even found himself enjoying the feeling of hunger, which he now sees as a sign that his body is working properly.

This adds up to their fifth title since 2011, but it can most definitely be called their best win so far. Apart from John Cook’s visionary leadership and the girls’ formidable play, many staffers like Taylor Raiola need to be credited for the same. The Huskers make the most well-balanced team in the country this year and that has shown in their peformances. Apart from the Penn State slip-up, they had been undefeated all-conference. Plus, they are 7-0  against top-10 teams this season, which is the most top-10 wins in a regular season in school history. And a lot of these achievements have to do with graduate managers like Taylor Raiola recruiting great talent to Nebraska. But wait, who is she and what her background is, here’s all about that. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Taylor Raiola as mentioned is in her first season as Nebraska’s graduate manager for recruiting. She holds a bachelor’s degree in Youth Advocacy and Education studies from TCU, completed in 2024, after which, she shifted to Nebraska. However, as a volleyball player, she holds a decent record with TCU, starting 41 matches as a member of their volleyball squad. In fact, she was the first Horned Frog since 2005 to bag a double-double. And a lot of this has to do with the rich sports lineage she comes from. Yes, Taylor Raiola’s family is full of collegiate athletes, starting with her father Dominic played 14 years in the NFL for the Detroit Lions and was also an All-America center with Nebraska. Next up, her mother, Yvonne was a water polo player at the University of Hawaii. And her younger brother, Dylan Raiola is a Husker quarterback and the consensus No. 1 overall football prospect in the class of 2024. Is Taylor Raiola the secret weapon behind Nebraska's volleyball dominance this season? Debate In fact, Taylor’s brother Dayton recently committed to the Nebraska Cornhuskers too. Moreover, speaking of her extended family, Taylor Raiola has three aunts and uncles who set foot in the world of college sports. One of whom is Donavan, NU’s offensive line coach. However, among all of them, Taylor appears to be close to her siblings. Here’s a glimpse of her adorable equation with her brothers. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Taylor Raiola has two brothers, Dylan and Dayton. And she makes a frequent appearance to cheer them both for their NFL matches. However, it appears that she shares a particularly close bond with the former, for the two live together and are associated with the Huskers. Acknowledging how college brought them closer as siblings, she shared a TikTok video stating, “One minute you are 9 & 12 and can’t agree on anything and the next you’re 19 & 22, living together and taking care of each other in college.” In fact, on her 22nd birthday, when TCU volleyball added an X post to wish her, Dayton reposted it and captioned it with, “Happy Birthday TAYLOR! Best sister ever!!” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Also, his brothers often find mention on her social media. Be it a causal appreciation post for them that says, “sibling appreciation post bc I love these two ding dongs so very much❤️‍🔥” or a post for Dylan’s Huskers match that says, “We’re your biggest fans 1️⃣5️⃣!! What an honor it was to be a small part of your big day. It’s just the beginning. So proud of you“, she never fails to honor her siblings.

After a run that saw him defend his title five times, establishing himself as one of the sport’s pound-for-pound greats, ‘The Nigerian Nightmare’ is all set to find himself in the win column at UFC 312 after three straight losses. But the task won’t be easy as he’ll be facing the dangerous Australian KO artist Jack Della Maddalena, who last knocked out Usman’s teammate Gilbert Burns at UFC 299. Usman was rumored to fight Shavkat Rakhmonov at UFC 310 since champion Belal Muhammad pulled out due to a nasty bone infection. However, the matchup was too short-notice for ‘The Nigerian Nightmare’, especially since Rakhmonov is a dangerous prospect. Now, with the matchup against the Australian being scheduled for February, Usman has ample time to prep for the #4-ranked welterweight. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Usman last stepped into the Octagon as a middleweight against the rising star Khamzat Chimaev at UFC 294 in his last fight and took the fight on short notice. Despite losing via unanimous decision, he gained the respect of fans for his resilience against the Chechen’s initial onslaught, and found his rhythm in the later rounds, even standing toe-to-toe, striking with ‘Borz’ in the third. Now, the welterweight champion has an opportunity to make a statement by taking on the ever-dangerous, surging Jack Della Maddalena in the latter’s home turf, no less. The news of Kamaru Usman vs. Jack Della Maddalena was first broken by MMA journalist Rueben Carter on his X (formerly Twitter) account. The post on X read, “Kamaru Usman vs Jack Della Maddalena targeted for #UFC312 in Sydney Australia”. The fight could very well see the winner in line for the title, in one of the most stacked divisions in the UFC.   BREAKING NEWS 🚨 Kamaru Usman vs Jack Della Maddalena targeted for #UFC312 in Sydney Australia pic.twitter.com/iF5b3TtGgd — Rueben Carter 🥇 (@realruebenking) November 30, 2024 Expand Tweet  Can Kamaru Usman reclaim his glory, or will Jack Della Maddalena prove too much in Sydney? Debate The stage has been set, and Usman will now prepare for the biggest challenge of his post-title reign career. While Usman gained immense respect for stepping into the cage at the last minute against Khamzat Chimaev, he was unwilling to step in at the last minute to face the undefeated Kazakh Shavkat Rakhmonov. It wasn’t because Usman was scared to face ‘Nomad’, it was just that ‘The Nigerian Nightmare’ was unwilling to take short notice fights against a dangerous opponent, especially since he’s in the precarious position of being on a three-fight losing streak. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Currently, with an 18-0 undefeated record, and all finishes, Shavkat Rakhmonov is the current boogeyman of the welterweight division. Finishing top names like Neil Magny, Geoff Neal, and Stephen Thompson is no small feat, and Kamaru Usman is highly aware of that. The Nigerian-American athlete tipped his hat to the Kazakh phenom in a conversation with Henry Cejudo but also thinks that the fight with the undefeated prospect from Central Asia is very winnable. While speaking on his ‘Pound 4 Pound’ podcast Usman said, “I’m getting ready if I get that call. But, to be honest, it’s a fight that I’ve looked at and I know it’s definitely a very winnable fight. And I know that I can, of all people, go out there and expose what hasn’t been exposed in a young, hungry, streaky guy in Shavkat Rakhmonov.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad However, he further shared the reason for him not taking the fight and said, “He’s very talented, [he] is very very good. But I do see the holes and I think that I can exploit that when that time is right. But December 7th might be a little too early for that time. So yeah, that’s where I’m at with it.” Do you agree with Kamaru Usman’s statements about the Shavkat Rakhmonov matchup? Do you think Usman will be able to find a win against him if they ever fought?

Let’s rewind a bit and take a look at how his incredible year unfolded. It all started with a historic moment at the Paris Olympics, where the 21-year-old sprinter from Botswana clinched gold in the 200m, stunning fans and competitors alike. But the story didn’t end there. Tebogo went on and won the ANOC Male Athlete of the Year trophy in Paris, which was a massive one to add. And as if that wasn’t enough, he won another! He finished the year by winning the title of Best Male Track Athlete of the Year at the World Athletics Awards, an award, and his rival Noah Lyles did not even get nominated for this despite winning the gold medal in the Paris 100m. So, you bet 2024 has well and truly been his year! But if you look back at Tebogo’s journey to this point, it’s been a mix of triumphs and challenges. He started 2024 strong, staying unbeaten in his first three meets, including wins at the Curro Podium Final and ASA Athletics Grand Prix 2 and 3. While he’s best known for his dominance in the 100m and 200m, he also helped Botswana secure an Olympic spot in the 4x400m relay at the World Athletics Relays. At the Paris Olympics, Tebogo had a tough moment when he finished 6th in the 100m, but he made an epic comeback in the 200m, outpacing Lyles to win the gold. With everything Tebogo has accomplished, it’s clear that this is just the beginning for him. The future is looking bright, and he’s ready for whatever’s next!

Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images Andre Drummond has been one of the most reliable back-to-the-basket big men in recent memory. The ‘Big Cat’ has showcased his brilliant low-post scoring and rebounding skills for each of the six teams he’s played so far in the league. However, there was a time when the towering center failed to make an impression on the hardwood. During this time, the parents of his teammates begged the coach to keep Drummond on the sidelines so that he wouldn’t negatively impact the game. It is safe to say that the game took its time to grow over the Philadelphia 76ers star as Drummond was a part of his elementary school team but was so uncoordinated with his movement and positioning that he failed to make an impact on the court. USA Today via Reuters Oct 4, 2021; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Philadelphia 76ers forward Andre Drummond (1) shoots as Toronto Raptors guard Dalano Banton (45) and forward Justin Champagnie (11) and forward Yuta Watanabe (18) defend during the first half at Scotiabank Arena. Mandatory Credit: John E. Sokolowski-USA TODAY Sports “His love was basketball. But he just wasn’t very good at it yet,” said Andre’s mother who further recalled. “You’d brush against him, and he’d fall over on the floor. I used to joke that the ball would be going to one end, and he’d be going to the other end. When he would go on the court, you have parents shouting from the stands, ‘Don’t put him in! Don’t put him in the game!”  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad However, Drummond’s love for hooping was much stronger than the struggles he faced as a kid and soon he made a giant leap by working hard on his skills. Later on, he went on to have an illustrious career in his high school and became one of the most sought-after names entering his collegiate career. All of this was made possible by his hard work and his parents’ support let’s dive into his family roots and get to know more about the two-time All-Star Center. Andre Drummond hails from Mount Vernon, New York, and the Sixers star was born to Jamaican parents back in 1993. However, he soon had a change of scenery as he, along with his mother Christine Cameron and sister moved to Middletown, Connecticut when Drummond was just seven. It was in Connecticut where he would grow up and start his basketball journey. Drummond attended Woodrow Wilson Middle School before transferring to Capital Preparatory Magnet School in Hartford. Furthermore, he holds American nationality and has Jamaican roots. Also, Christine and Andre share a pretty special bond and the Center even refers to his mom as his ‘best friend’. From uncoordinated kid to NBA star—Is Andre Drummond the ultimate underdog story in basketball? Debate     A post shared by Andre Drummond (@drummond)  So much so that she has been the biggest influence in Drummond’s basketball career. One such incident took place while Andre was selecting a college program to represent and his mother had the final say, as he landed to play for the University of Connecticut. He explained, “I had no chance of going anywhere else,” The center recalled, “You’re going (to UConn), whether you like it or not,” this is what his mother told him while he was assessing schools to pick from. Christine wanted him to stay close by so that his close-knit family could watch his games and support the future star. One thing other than his family’s support which has remained constant throughout his journey from Connecticut to the NBA has been Andre Drummond’s faith. The Sixers star has been an avid follower and believer of Christianity and has also displayed that on multiple occasions during his time in the league. One such event occurred when a fan on X asked him, “I will give someone 1000 bucks if they can tell me one thing @AndreDrummond has improved on since his rookie year” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad   My faith in Christ — Andre Drummond (@AndreDrummond) October 19, 2017 Expand Tweet  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Following it, Drummond wrote an epic reply by commenting on the tweet, “My faith in Christ” which is a clear indicator of how highly the center regards faith in his life. However, this interaction wasn’t the only one where he credited god. After putting up 24 points and 25 rebounds in a matchup when he used to play for Chicago, Drummond thanked god for this achievement saying, “Just thanking God for the opportunity, can’t take this game for granted, you never know when’s the last time on the court,” Drummond acknowledges how lucky to make it to the league and that he has to make the most of this opportunity.

Let’s narrow this down. SEC has been nothing but weird this season. While Longhorns, Bulldogs, and even Vols are off the playoff list, the same cannot be said for Bama, South Carolina, and Ole Miss. See, after their embarrassing loss to Oklahoma, Bama marked their 3rd loss of the season. Now, if they hadn’t lost to an unranked Vandy team early on, then the situation would still be debatable. The same problem stands for Ole Miss. Lane Kiffin was on full blast this season and after holding the Dawgs to just 10 points, everyone knew that these guys were making it to the playoffs. But then the Gators happened, and they walked all over the Rebels’ defense and offense. And for South Carolina? See, the Gamecocks had some respectable losses. One was to Ole Miss and the other to Bama. The LSU disaster could’ve been avoided, but here we are. So, it ain’t no wonder why Paul Finebaum thinks that these 3 teams are just not cracking it for the playoff bracket. “I think I think the problem with Alabama, Ole Miss, and South Carolina, there’s not a convincing argument,” Finebaum mentioned. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Now you might argue that well, Bama won. Why can’t they make the cut? Yes, Kalen DeBoer and Jalen Milroe managed to overcome everything and got a win over Auburn marking the 5th Bama win in the Iron Bowl, but do you think they deserve a spot after what they did against Vanderbilt? Alabama has arguably one of the best defense and offense in the country, and what do they do? Give Vandy 40 points. That Iron Bowl win pretty much means nothing when you can’t even protect your run against a washup 5-loss Oklahoma team. And even for Ole Miss. How do you keep an offense with Carson Beck at 10 points but lose the game to a team that is reliant on their backup QB to stay relevant? South Carolina still had respectable losses to its name, so it’s fine for them. If the committee does decide to pull Alabama from the list, then it could be because of Clemson losing to SC and going out of the 12-team bracket, but this is wishful thinking. SEC, this year, has been nothing but disappointing and this tells you all you should know about the new era of college football. Is Alabama's playoff dream over, or can they still pull off a miracle this season? Debate ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Boy, oh boy, the Big 10 has been wild. From the entire playoff picture, the Big 10 conference is the leading champs. Oregon is sitting on top with an undefeated 12-run season and the first seed into the playoffs. Following them will probably be Penn State. The Nittany Lions secured their final game win and have an 11-1 run. Now, for the previous 2nd spot holder; Buckeyes. Things are not good for Ryan Day and Co. Not only did these guys lose to MICHIGAN, but they also lost by THREE POINTS. In what world do you lose to a team that didn’t even have their star TE on the field and had a walk-on QB who has thrown more interceptions than touchdowns? ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Pretty sure Buckeyes fans are buck wild on the Ryan Day firing, but we still gotta wait for that to unfold. See, this year, the confirmed contenders are the Ducks, Nittany Lions, Fighting Irish, and Hoosiers. The SEC can talk a walk.  Let the world know your perspective.

Forced out of competition due to a knee injury, the track and field realm had some new names at the summit. Dutch hurdler Femke Bol took the track by storm and began to notch up wins one after the other. Thus, coming to the Paris Olympics, Bol was being heavily hyped. She was also touted as the potential kryptonite to McLaughlin-Levrone’s Superman. However, when the US athlete did step back onto the field, things panned out quite differently.  Abiding by her doctor’s instructions to take a step back and rest, McLaughlin-Levrone looked like a well-oiled machine in Paris. As the gun was fired in Paris, the 25-year-old looked like a bolt from the blue. With the athletes crossing the finish line, there was no doubt as to who would be crowned as the champion. But there was a more important question that lingered: how fast did the returning McLaughlin-Levrone run? The scoreboards indicated that the hurdler had yet again smashed the world record. McLaughlin-Levrone clocked a blitzkrieg of 50.37s to stun her opponents.  And as for Femke Bol, her third-place timing of 52.15s was impressive but did not match the American’s madness. Thus, reclaiming her crown back, the 400m hurdle queen made a unique record. She was inducted into the club of elite athletes who had clinched gold medals in all the Olympic events. Now, after reclaiming her crown on the track, there was just one small thing left for the 25-year-old to conquer. And she did that too, in style! ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad In a recent update, the World Athletics have announced their list of the best male and female athletes for the year. After losing out to Faith Kipyegon last year, the 2022 winner has once again been declared the 2024 Female Track Athlete of the Year. This is quite an accomplishment for Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, as she yet again established her dominance in the track realm.     A post shared by World Athletics (@worldathletics)  And remember, the competition was not easy! Giving the US 400m hurdle queen a tough fight for the title was none other than the women’s 100m Olympic gold medalist, Julien Alfred. Alfred too surprised the fans by beating the crowd favorite Sha’Carri Richardson to clinch the first Olympic gold for St. Lucia. Thus, despite having a host of accolades to ornament her charismatic career, this particular win surely will be a special one for the hurdle queen. After all, her time off the track was so tough that McLaughlin-Levrone mourned while narrating the painful experience in her book.

Debate With two Olympic golds and back-to-back world records, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone’s name has become synonymous with dominance and historical triumphs. She indeed seemed invincible until a sudden barrier put a pause to her journey. 2023 introduced a rare vulnerability in her journey, as a knee injury forced her to withdraw from the World Championships in Budapest. Such a stop in an otherwise unstoppable career shocked the track world.  via Reuters Paris 2024 Olympics – Athletics – Women’s 400m Hurdles Semi-Final – Stade de France, Saint-Denis, France – August 06, 2024.

In an Instagram post that resonated with heartbreak, Sydney addressed her fans, “I am so sad to share that I must withdraw… After consulting with my doctors and coaches, I need to take care of a minor knee issue so that I can be fully healthy for next year’s Paris Olympics.” However, the spirit of determination continued to grow within her. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Narrating this tough chapter of her life she wrote in her book ‘Far Beyond Gold’, “It’s a tough pill to swallow knowing that I didn’t lose the race, but I didn’t even get the chance to step on the line,” Sydney revealed the internal battles she had to face. However, instead of dwelling on the disappointment, she embraced the lessons of patience and perseverance.  Faith remained her anchor, she acknowledged how it reminded her, “God’s presence does not mean the absence of problems.” And by channeling her setbacks into personal growth, Sydney emerged stronger, her focus sharpened for a triumphant return. She indeed took the pause to wreak havoc on the track in the City of Love. Not only did she secure her 2nd individual gold in the Olympics but also broke her own world record for the sixth consecutive time! Let the world know your perspective.

Gampel Pavilion. Mandatory Credit: David Butler II-Imagn Images When the UConn Huskies started this season, they had one major concern: their center Samson Johnson committing a lot of fouls. Even HC Dan Hurley was doubtful of his playing abilities at that time. However, now that Johnson has gotten over his tendencies, the Huskies have fallen prey to another issue, and it remains to be seen if they will be able to get over that. On Saturday’s episode of Locked On UConn, Mark Zanetto and Dan Meehan shared their take on Johnson’s revival into the NCAA, while also expressing another major concern surrounding the consecutive NCAA Championship winners. “Samson was perfect from the field… So we would like to see Tarris starting, but if this is the Samson Johnson we get for the rest of the year, I can live with it. He had 2 blocks, 2 steals, did not have a ton of fouls which is a very good sign. As a will of the matter who Samson Johnson plays, is he fouls a ton,” Zanetto expressed. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Though Johnson could only score 7 points in the 20 minutes he played, he did not commit even a single personal foul which proved that he wasn’t trying too hard. Other than that he had 3-of-3 from beyond the arc and a cent percent from the charity line. Adding to that he performed 4 rebounds, 2 blocks, and 2 steals which showed that he was putting in the needed efforts in defense. via Imago Nov 25, 2024; Lahaina, Hawaii, USA; Connecticut Huskies head coach Dan Hurley reacts to play as his team takes on the Memphis Tigers during an NCAA college basketball game at Lahaina Civic Center. Mandatory Credit: Marco Garcia-Imagn Images Previously, Hurley had stated that “it’s dumbfounding,” that Johnson commits a lot of fouls. However, he also rationalized for his mistakes, saying,  “I just don’t know how he put him. Why he keeps putting himself in these situations? I think he’s such a great guy… And he wants to do well so badly that he’s… you know he’s pressing, and he’s fighting for every inch. And he’s playing with a level of desperation that’s admirable.”  Johnson had committed four personal fouls against the New Hampshire Wildcats in a span of 11 minutes that he played. Similarly, when the Storss-based team had opened their season against the Sacred Heart Pioneers, Johnson had committed 5 personal fouls in the 16 minutes that he played. While this issue was resolved, they had another problem waiting for them. Meanwhile, Meehan spoke of the issues the Huskies might face in the absence of Karaban. “Noted the line of change, Tarris still comes off the bench. But with Karaban out, I am not sure how much weight we can throw into the roster. Changes tonight will see into what happens going into Baylor next week. Another tough shooting night for Liam, I think he was 1 of 8 or around there from three, so that’s two games in a row.” Without Karaban, do the Huskies have the depth to tackle upcoming challenges like Baylor? Debate While Tarris Reed came off the bench, plying his trade for 17 minutes and scoring 10 points, a major setback to the Huskies was that their main star Alex Karaban wasn’t on the floor. Karaban averages the highest for the Huskies this season with 15.9 points per game. He unfortunately hit his head on the floor during the last game of the Maui Invitational and therefore did not play in this one, though he was present at XL Center. While the Huskies did manage it in this matchup winning the game by a 99-45 margin, Meehan was concerned if they could get going in the upcoming games without Karaban. However, the game did have other positives for the Huskies. Meanwhile, Zanetto praised Solo Ball for scoring 12 points and having 2-out-5 from the three-pointer line. Although, he opined that “he should have little improved on defense,” and being beaten by the guards was concerning. Nonetheless, he was happy that other players too contributed their best. Meehan on the other hand, compared Ball to Jordan Hawkins and was also satisfied with Isaiah Abraham’s 10-minute, 6 points performance. Zanetto lauded Jaden Ross and Tarris Reed for scoring double-doubles. While Ross hit 10 points with 10 rebounds, Reed scored 10 points with 12 rebounds. Plus he also noticed Aiden Mahaney’s efforts of 11 points with 4 assists, calling it “his best game,” while concluding that “I still wanna see him be more aggressive but there was a little bit more of that today.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad As for Meehan, he was sure that “their depth just trains the other team on offense and that opens up something for UConn.” Meanwhile, he also looked impressed with the Huskies scoring 10-27 threes (37%), with 48 rebounds, and 23 assists, while wanting to look forward to how they tackle Baylor. Hopefully, the Huskies will continue this performance and make sure don’t feel the absence of Karaban.    ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad    Let the world know your perspective.

Petit-Frere’s journey from Ohio State to the NFL carries an inspiring story as this season marks his third for the Titans. Known for his quick feet and athleticism, Petit-Frere is one of just four offensive linemen to start all 16 games in his rookie season. And ever since the Titans drafted him in the third round of the 2022 NFL Draft, the fans know exactly who’s been the biggest support for his career. Let’s meet the protagonists of his story: his single mom, Loris and his dad. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Loris Petit-Frere is the major figure behind the 25-year-old offensive tackle. Petit-Frere was born when Loris was a senior in her high school. After graduating high school, Loris earned an academic scholarship to South Florida and finished her degree in the next three years. While Mama Loris was in college, Petit-Frere’s grandparents raised him for his first five years. As a single mother, Loris was the only caretaker of her son when he was growing up and evolving in sports. “There was a period of time where I had to work two jobs to make ends meet,” Stated Loris. “He’s a growing boy, he’s involved in sports, all that costs.”     A post shared by Nicholas Petit-Frere (@nicholas_petitfrere)  No doubt, it was her love and support that helped her son get that NFL call from the Titans. “It’s the biggest impact I can describe. I’ll describe it. But whatever I say is not going to be enough for me to describe the impact on my life,” the jersey number 78 said. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Can Nicholas Petit-Frere overcome his setbacks and become a key player for the Titans again? Debate Petit-Frere is of Haitian descent through his father, who passed away when he was just seven years old. Mom Loris ensured that her son never felt the lack of a father figure while raising him as a single parent. She told him that God is his father. Being a single child and living with her mother for his whole life, football somehow became Petit-Frere’s family. “I’ve created so many different relationships and new families because of football,” he once said. Thanks to Mama Loris, Petit-Frere is having a good start to his career with the Tennessee Titans. However, the offensive tackle had quite ups and downs in his short NFL career. He kicked off his career with a strong rookie season, starting 16 games and appearing in the 97% of the snaps. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad However, Petit-Frere was sidelined during his second season for violating the league’s gambling policy. The Titans suspended the offensive tackle for six games. Following his suspension, he was later placed on injury reserve. The Titans are sitting with 3-8 on the table and, just like the team, Petit-Frere had also faced challenged throughout the season.

   It’s been over a decade since we last saw the NFL give the MVP to a non-quarterback. This season, however, might be the end to that run. Saquon Barkley has been arguably the most impactful offensive player in the entire league this season. At least, that’s how Charles Woodson feels. Talking on FOX Sports NFL, the legendary defensive back tipped his hat to the Philadelphia Eagles star. Should Saquon Barkley be the favorite for MVP this season? 👀@CharlesWoodson makes a case! pic.twitter.com/pky94MHjlE — FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) December 1, 2024  He praised him for his performance in his last game against the Los Angeles Rams, in which he ran for 255 yards and two touchdowns. He believes that delivering a strong performance against two fellow MVP candidates, Lamar Jackson, and Derrick Henry – who are currently trailing him in the rushing race – could enhance his chances of being named the league’s Most Valuable Player this season. Unfortunately, the MVP has been a QB-exclusive award more often than not. We all agree that the quarterback might be the most important position in the game, but this is still a team sport, and some players in other positions have been as impactful – if not more – than some quarterbacks. If he doesn’t win the award, he will most likely have to settle for the Offensive Player of the Year distinction. Barkley will focus on the bigger picture and try to lead his team to a win against another Super Bowl contender. Even so, it would be nice to see MVP voters also give credit to other players for a change."

   The San Francisco Giants have suffered a significant loss this season after watching 2-time Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell leave them to sign a 5-year deal with their biggest rivals, the defending World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers. The loss of Snell is a significant one and creates a major void in the team’s starting rotation. However, the Giants look to move on quickly and are reported to have “significant interest” in another big free-agent starter. MLB Network Insider Mark Feinsand shared that the Giants are believed to have “significant interest” in free-agent Cy Young winner Corbin Burnes. The Giants are believed to have 'significant' interest in Corbin Burnes, per @Feinsand pic.twitter.com/PF7aSEXAn8 — B/R Walk-Off (@BRWalkoff) November 30, 2024  Burnes is the biggest pitching prize on the open market and will command a hefty payday, likely bordering on $300 million, if not more. The ace is coming off another stellar season in 2024, his first with the Baltimore Orioles. In that season, he won a career-high 15 games and posted a 2.92 ERA in 194.1 innings. Burnes is a throwback workhorse who has made four straight All-Star teams and just turned 30, which is something the Giants desperately need after losing Snell. San Francisco will undoubtedly face heavy competition for Burnes. Nearly every team with deep pockets will be after him, which typically doesn’t bode well for the Giants. This organization has a history of finishing in second or third place when it comes to big free agents. Still, with three-time World Series champion and former MVP Buster Posey now running the show, perhaps things will be different this time around."

   The Philadelphia Eagles finished last season on a low note. Some thought the team had to part ways with Nick Sirianni after they deflated in the second half of the season, especially considering some troublesome reports about his leadership with the team. Instead, the front office gave him some of the best assistant coaches in business, and it worked. That’s particularly true for their defense. Vic Fangio has turned their underperforming defense around in a way that’s hard to explain. That’s why former NFL quarterback Alex Smith tipped his hat to the defensive coordinator. Talking on ESPN, Smith praised Fangio for his outstanding job of turning this defense from one of the worst in the league to the absolute best in almost no time. ""This was one of the worst defenses in football last year … They are No. 1 right now."" Alex Smith credits Vic Fangio, along with Saquon Barkley, for turning the Eagles into Super Bowl contenders 🏆 pic.twitter.com/JNJEwyapvP — NFL on ESPN (@ESPNNFL) December 1, 2024  Fangio’s reputation as a defensive guru precedes him. He didn’t succeed much with the Miami Dolphins, with some reports claiming he didn’t get along with the players, but he still deserved another shot at doing his thing. The Eagles had a lot of talent on defense, so it was hard to explain why they struggled so much last season. And even though they got off to a somewhat slow start this year, it’s now more than evident that they made the right choice when they brought Fangio there. There are still reasons to doubt Sirianni, but the Eagles are playing like a legitimate Super Bowl contender right now, and a lot of that has to do with their defense."

   The Cincinnati Bengals have little margin for error for the rest of the season. Unfortunately for them, things won’t be easy for them on Sunday. They will host the Pittsburgh Steelers for a divisional clash, and Colin Cowherd doesn’t like their chances. Even if they win, he thinks this will be a very close game. Talking on The Volume, the renowned analyst said that he liked the Steelers to cover the +3-point spread here. He stated that as great as Joe Burrow is, he won’t be able to do much when the Steelers star in a run-heavy game and dominate the time of possession. Is @ColinCowherd Sharp or Square for thinking the Steelers beat the Bengals today? 🔪@DKSportsbook #dkpartnerhttps://t.co/7bfZQURcOt pic.twitter.com/PRdik54eRv — The Volume (@TheVolumeSports) December 1, 2024  The Steelers are coming off a loss and had some additional time to prepare for this divisional clash. Mike Tomlin is one of the savviest coaches in the National Football League, and it’s rare for the Steelers to drop consecutive games, so Cowherd’s prediction makes a lot of sense. The Steelers know how to win ugly, hard-fought games. The Bengals have been a much better team in the second half of the season under Zac Taylor, but their defensive miscues have been way too much to ignore this season. Burrow is 3-2 vs. the Steelers in his career, but for the first time, he’ll face a somewhat competent offense that can also score points. Divisional matchups are usually a toss-up, but placing your money against Mike Tomlin is not always wise."

   The Detroit Lions managed to keep Ben Johnson around for another season, but they might not be able to pull that off twice. Johnson, who was strongly considered as a head coaching candidate in the offseason, withdrew from that consideration to stay in Detroit. He reportedly felt like he had some unfinished business, and his decision to run it back has proved to be the right one. This time, however, he might choose to spread his wings and leave Dan Campbell’s side. According to an ESPN report by Adam Schefter, the Chicago Bears will likely try to lure him to the Windy City (via Field Yates). “Everybody’s gonna have their eyes on Ben Johnson, the Lions offensive coordinator, and I think he might have some interest in that job. We’ll see if they can convince him to come to Chicago.” 👀 https://t.co/chkhZcrJzK — Field Yates (@FieldYates) December 1, 2024  The Bears just fired Matt Eberflus, making him the first mid-season coach fired in franchise history. It was hard to justify keeping him there for much longer after how things transpired this season and the debacle vs. Johnson and the Lions on Thanksgiving. He seems to be a tailor-made fit for the Bears. Even if Keenan Allen leaves, they will still have more than enough offensive resources to work with, not to mention a promising quarterback in Caleb Williams. The Bears must urgently address their offensive line issues, but hiring a young, offensive-minded coach like Johnson could be what they need to finally make progress. Also, he knows the NFC North inside out, which is another plus for this hire. The Lions might also lose defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn in the next coach hiring cycle, so they must make the most of this Super Bowl window while keeping their coaching staff intact."

   As it happens every year, several NFL coaches did not survive another season. We’ve already seen Robert Saleh (New York Jets), Dennis Allen (New Orleans Saints), and Matt Eberflus (Chicago Bears) fired midway through the season, but they likely won’t be the only ones. Several candidates will likely join them in the unemployment line, either at some point in the season or shortly after it. With that in mind, Dov Kleiman took to X to engage with the fans and ask them their predictions about the next coaches to be fired, with one name being mentioned the most. Which head coach is next to be fired? pic.twitter.com/WvJKxpuGTP — Dov Kleiman (@NFL_DovKleiman) December 1, 2024  Pierce — safk (@K_FAS1776) December 1, 2024  AP — Tyler (@highlanders97) December 1, 2024  Should be Pierce, that organization needs a major overhaul from top to bottom. — Ruben Alejandro (@DiazRuben96) December 1, 2024  I can only hope AP — tomp (@NavyTomP) December 1, 2024  Antonio Pierce, while young and leading a team with little talent, has left plenty to be desired in his first season as the main guy in charge. Some believe you either have the intangibles to lead a team or you don’t. Some think the Dallas Cowboys had to fire Mike McCarthy after last season’s debacle with the Green Bay Packers, and now that the team is struggling, it’s only harder to justify him keeping his job. The same goes for Doug Pederson, who failed to keep the good momentum after a strong first season with the Jacksonville Jaguars. It’s not easy to find success in the NFL, and some people are better suited to be assistant coaches, so it’ll be interesting to see who’s the next one to go."

   The Chicago Bears made unfortunate history this week when they fired their head coach in the middle of a season for the first time in 100 years, canning Matt Eberflus following an unfathomable late-game collapse on Thanksgiving Day against the Detroit Lions. The 23-20 loss featured inexcusable clock management in the final minute of the game. Caleb Williams and the Bears offense got off nothing more than a Hail Mary attempt in the final 36 seconds of the game despite being in field goal range and having a timeout that was never used. Speculation about who will be the team’s next head coach has already commenced, and one candidate has emerged above the rest as the potential solution. NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport shared on Sunday morning that the Bears’ opening should be one of the most coveted in the league this offseason and that the organization will conduct a wide-ranging search that includes Washington Commanders offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury as a potential top candidate. From @NFLGameDay: The #Bears now have a coveted opening, and expect a wide-ranging search. They'll consider all the top candidates, including #Commanders OC Kliff Kingsbury — whose ties to Caleb Williams are obvious. Plus, #Chiefs WR Hollywood Brown is expected back soon. pic.twitter.com/tYqxwUkjvf — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) December 1, 2024  Kingsbury has apparent ties to Caleb Williams, thanks to their time together at USC. Kingsbury spent last season as a senior offensive analyst, while Williams played quarterback for the Trojans. The Bears will certainly entertain the usual suspects regarding this coaching search, and it would be silly not to, as Mike Vrabel, Bill Belichick, Aaron Glenn, and Ben Johnson are all certain to see their names thrown into the hat for this opening. It was clear immediately after the loss that the Bears made the right decision, as multiple players voiced their opinions about Eberflus’ exit. It’ll be interesting to see who is next in line in Chicago."

   The Minnesota Vikings have a new quarterback in the room. However, they’re thinking about the long run. That’s why they won’t rush Daniel Jones into the action. According to Ian Rapoport of the NFL Network, the newcomer won’t be active for Sunday’s game vs. the Arizona Cardinals. Daniel Jones WILL NOT be active today.  Could be another 1-3 weeks. A long term play by the #Vikings according to @TomPelissero with Jones spending time with O’Connell, Udinski, and McCown getting up to speed.  pic.twitter.com/BSO6Czw1P3 — The Purple Persuasion (@TPPSkol) December 1, 2024  It might take 1-3 weeks before he’s ready, as he’s getting up to speed with the coaching staff. Jones claimed that his decision to join the Vikings was highly motivated by getting an opportunity to work with coach Kevin O’Connell. The Vikings most likely never intended him to be the starter, but they know they could’ve used an upgrade over Nick Mullens as the backup quarterback. Sam Darnold has done a solid job for the most part, and he’s earned the right to stay as their starter for the remainder of the season. Even so, this is a physical game, and injuries can happen anytime. The Vikings have also had some issues at left tackle lately, and if Darnold were to fall with an injury, Jones gives them a proven and experienced backup who might be able to finish the job for them. Jones hasn’t been very good in his career, but the Vikings give him the best supporting cast he’s had since entering the league. Also, we’ve seen how much of a difference a system and good coaching can make for struggling quarterbacks, so perhaps O’Connell and company can help him."

   The matchup between Ohio State and Michigan is consistently one of the most significant games of the college football season. After many years of dominance by the Buckeyes, Michigan has recently taken the lead, winning four consecutive games, including a close 13-10 victory on Saturday. Michigan’s record improved to 7-5 following the victory, but it hasn’t lived up to expectations since last season’s National Championship victory. Still, fans and alumni are basking in the victory, including the quarterback of that aforementioned national championship team, J.J. McCarthy, the current Minnesota Vikings rookie quarterback. McCarthy posted on Instagram following the game, sharing a meme from “The Office” depicting Jim Halpert and Dwight Schrute holding up a sign that says, “1,827 days since our last loss vs. Ohio State.” #Vikings QB JJ McCarthy is having fun trolling Ohio State after Michigan’s win over them today 🤣 📸: @jjmccarthy09 via IG pic.twitter.com/3MxJ2zv1Kd — VikingzFanPage (@vikingzfanpage) November 30, 2024  Coincidentally, Ohio State has lost all four of its most recent matchups while being ranked No. 2 in the nation. As embarrassing as this loss was, given that it took them out of the mix for the Big Ten Conference Championship game, the Buckeyes’ place in the College Football Playoff should be unaffected. Ohio State can have the last laugh if they can win the National Championship, but for now, fans are fed up with losing to the Wolverines. The loss was only made worse by the fact that Michigan emphatically planted their flag at midfield of Ohio Stadium and started a massive fracas that resulted in multiple players getting pepper sprayed by the cops, all while head coach Ryan Day stood by confused. It wasn’t the best day to be a Buckeye."

   The Chicago Bears are finally ready to move on from Matt Eberflus. Some analysts and fans thought the firing was long overdue, stating that there was no reason to bring him back this season in the first place. The Bears would have a new quarterback and offensive cast, so they could’ve also gone after a new coach. Caleb Williams will have at least two different coaches in his first two seasons in the league, assuming they keep Thomas Brown permanently. But even if that’s not the case and they pursue someone else, some still wonder what might happen with GM Ryan Poles. It’s getting more usual to see teams fire their general managers when they also part ways with their head coaches. This time, however, will be different. According to a report by Ian Rapoport of the NFL Network, the Bears intend to keep Ryan Poles around. .@RapSheet with the latest morning headlines on the Bears upcoming HC search, plus an update on Hollywood Brown. pic.twitter.com/Xzz6LpPGgc — NFL Network (@nflnetwork) December 1, 2024  This move makes sense. Poles made some interesting moves in the offseason, maximizing his assets and surrounding his prized rookie quarterback with talent. He’s also made significant trades to bolster the roster in the past. The Bears desperately need to revamp their offensive line, which is the only other thing holding this team back aside from coaching. It was almost impossible to keep Eberflus in charge of the team after what happened on Thanksgiving, and with the Bears free-falling after a promising start to the season, something had to give."

Goals from Nicolas Jackson, Enzo Fernandez and Cole Palmer saw Chelsea win to move level on points with Arsenal, but Maresca told us afterwards on Fofana: ‘Unfortunately, it’s bad news.   ‘It’s a hamstring problem. These kind of things require at least three, four, five weeks. In this moment, you lose 10 games or 12 games. In the way he was playing, it’s a big loss for us. But we have more players and we’ll try to find solutions. ‘It’s a big loss. He’s doing fantastic. But it’s normal when you play this amount of games and fortunately it’s his first injury this season. But we’re going to find solutions.’ Benoit Badiashile replaced Fofana, who has been partnering Levi Colwill this term. Chelsea managed to see out the clean sheet against Villa, their first in eight matches. Maresca was asked if this classified as a statement win and he said: ‘It was a very good game for many reasons, one is that we played a team that is fantastic and I consider Emery a top manager.

But the 21-year-old felt discomfort in his hamstring and was forced off in the latter stages of the midweek win at Anfield.    There was initially a fear that the right back could be out for around four weeks.  However, following further assessments, Bradley is not expected to return until after the new year as he faces six weeks out, according to the Belfast Telegraph.  It’s a huge blow to Liverpool as it means he will miss the busy festive period with Liverpool set to play nine games in December.       Conor Bradley (left) is set for an extended period on the sideline, according to reports      Bradley is not expected to return until the new year after felt discomfort against Real Madrid Bradley was absent from the Reds squad for the showdownwith Manchester City on Sunday and will sit out Premier League games against Newcastle, Everton, Fulham, Tottenham, Leicester and West Ham as well as the Champions League game against Girona and League Cup quarter-final against Southampton.  Liverpool were boosted by the return of Trent Alexander-Arnold who is fit again after a hamstring problem.  Meanwhile, Ibrahima Konate is facing a spell on the sidelines after also suffering an injury in the win over Real Madrid.  The Frenchman wrote on Instagram: ‘So frustrating to pick up this injury right at the end of a great game on Wednesday night. Now we start the recovery process but one thing I promise is I will come back and be the best I can be once again. ‘Thank you for the amazing support at Anfield.

Despite braces for Marcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee, United’s new head coach, who took his unbeaten run since succeeding Erik ten Hag to three games, believes far more is to come as players get used to his methods. ‘The result was good but we were pragmatic,’ he said. ‘It was not pretty but we were pragmatic. We did our job, which is to win.   ‘You can feel that we have a long way to go. You can feel that in the first few minutes, where we were OK, but then Everton controlled the game.  ‘Then we got the goals in the right moment and that changed the game. ‘You can’t just focus on the result, you have to focus on the way the result appeared.

It isn’t a line of top performances, it is a rollercoaster of performances.  ‘We have some moments when we are good but then we have moments when we have to suffer. We need time to train and improve.’ Amad Diallo produced a man-of-the-match display from right wing-back with his two assists a key factor in United taking the game away from Everton, and closing the gap on the Premier League top four. ‘He is really big in talent, but small in size!’ Amorim laughed. ‘He did a great job but he is also has to improve. He is in a great moment. Ruud van Nistelrooy helped him a lot in his games in charge and now he’s helping me.’ But for all the satisfaction of United on the pitch, hundreds of disgruntled fans turned on minority co-owner Jim Ratcliffe and the Glazer family over their controversial mid-season ticket price hike. Last week fans recoiled at the club’s decision to raise matchday ticket prices to £66 per game, with no concessions for children or pensioners. In front of the Trinity Statue, United fans held onto a ‘Stop Exploiting Loyalty’ banner, with chants against Ratcliffe and the Glazers, accusing them of being ‘touts’ and ‘taking the p**s’.      In front of the Trinity Statue, United fans held onto a ‘Stop Exploiting Loyalty’ banner    Flares were sent off and fans continued their annoyance with chants inside the ground about the controversial price hike, which United insist won’t affect 97 per cent of fans with that number of tickets already sold. Liverpool and Manchester City fans also came together to protest before they faced off at Anfield in solidarity with the Football Supporters’ Association (FSA) campaign. ‘The rivalry between these four clubs has been, and is, fierce. But we all go to games, love our club and want to keep football affordable for future generations while protecting heritage and communities,’ a spokesperson for Manchester United fan group FC58 said. ‘The only way we can achieve this is collaboration.

Wales to tackle the FA The attempt by Welsh clubs playing in the English league to qualify for Europe by entering the Welsh League Cup will now go before the full FA Board, rather than just a sub-committee. In what would appear to be a blow for those wanting to ‘have their Welsh cake and eat it’, as one English exec quipped, EFL clubs have been told that the decision has been made ‘due to the importance and significance of the topic’. Clubs have also been assured that they will be given the opportunity to respond as part of the consultation process.      The attempt by Welsh clubs playing in the English league to qualify for Europe by entering the Welsh League Cup will now go before the full FA Board   Ignorance is Faes Not all of Leicester City’s footballers were out partying while manager Steve Cooper was getting sacked. A group including Conor Coady and Harry Winks were spotted in a Copenhagen nightclub, close to a sign which read ‘Enzo I Miss U’, which many interpreted as a dig at Enzo Maresca’s replacement, hours after the defeat by Chelsea which saw Cooper punted despite his side not being in the relegation zone. However, with the squad not expected back in until Tuesday, centre-back Wout Faes was spotted in the more tranquil surroundings of Cliveden House in Buckinghamshire. Indeed, as club bosses were harshly deciding that Cooper was out of his depth, Faes was relaxing in the spa’s swimming pool.      Wout Faes was not out partying while Leicester players were snapped out just before Steve Cooper’s sacking The Gretsy Lights Christmas lights of a different variety have arrived at Crewe Alexandra courtesy of Cheshire Police, rather than Santa Claus. Officers arrived at Gresty Road last week armed with LED grow lights, which they had seized following a raid at a cannabis factory. With the League Two side’s pitch having suffered in previous winters, the donations were well-received by club staff, with one insider claiming they now had their own version of the Northern Lights.

Rashford scored twice in the 4-0 victory against Everton at Old Trafford, Amorim’s first home league game in charge, and admitted he is feeling ‘energised’. The result meant that Amorim is still to suffer his first defeat at the helm, having also overseen a 3-2 win over Bodo/Glimt in the Europa League and a draw with Ipswich.   Despite flickering in and out of form under Ten Hag, Rashford has been pivotal to Amorim’s start, with his second and third goals of the new era arriving on Sunday. And, speaking post-match, he shared his belief that there is more to come. ‘It is a nice result,’ Rashford told Sky Sports. ‘It is important with a new coach and a new play of playing, when we are still learning.       Marcus Rashford scored twice in Manchester United’s 4-0 victory against Everton      Ruben Amorim remains unbeaten and Rashford has praised his early impact at Old Trafford ‘We have to back up this performance and win in midweek. ‘We all, as individuals, want to get back to our best and then push to improve so even in the bad moments you are doing the right thing. ‘The connection is going to build and grow the more we get used to him.  ‘He’s [Amorim] come in in a busy period and hopefully the connection keeps building and growing. He’s come in with a great attitude and it’s passed onto the players. ‘The atmosphere is one of the most special things about his club and playing at this great stadium is always a great feeling. ‘It is early on but I feel energised and ready for the next game. This game has only just finished but the next one is always the focus for the players.’ United moved up into ninth, four points adrift of the Champions League places, but Amorim was not entirely satisfied with his side’s performance. ‘The result was good but we were pragmatic. It was not pretty but we were pragmatic. We did our job, which is to win,’ he said.      Rashford has been in resurgent form since Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag in the dugout ‘You can feel that we have a long way to go. You can feel that in the first few minutes, where we were OK, but then Everton controlled the game. Then we got the goals in the right moment and that changed the game.  ‘You can’t just focus on the result, you have to focus on the way the result appeared. ‘Like before the game, we have so much to do, but it is better to work with victories. Let’s focus on the performance more than the result. ‘You can feel it during the game. It isn’t a line of top performances, it is a rollercoaster of performances. We have some moments when we are good but then we have moments when we have to suffer. We did it again like in the Europa League.  ‘We need time to train and improve. It is better to work with victories.’ Your email address will not be published.

Sportsdark,Shock update on Aaron Rodgers' Jets future emerges moments before Seattle Seahawks showdown,https://sportsdark.com/nfl/shock-update-on-aaron-rodgers-jets-future-emerges-moments-before-seattle-seahawks-showdown/,"Sun, 01 Dec 2024 16:45:00 +0000","Aaron Rodgers is considered a &#8216;long shot&#8217; by the New York Jets to be their quarterback next season, it has been claimed.

NFL reporter Ian Rapoport made the bombshell revelation just two hours before the Jets resumed their season after last weekend’s bye week against Seattle Seahawks at 1pm ET. Speaking on NFL GameDay, Rapoport said: ‘Is Aaron Rodgers going to be the Jets quarterback in 2025?   ‘You mention the money: none guaranteed but they do owe him a $35million option bonus if they decide to bring him back. My understanding is that Rodgers right now is considered a long shot to return to the Jets. ‘Those conversations will happen with the new powerbrokers after the year but that is my understanding right now.’  If Rodgers and the Jets were to part ways, it would leave the 40-year-old quarterback facing a serious decision about his future in the game.      Aaron Rodgers is currently considered ‘a long shot’ to return to the New York Jets next year   Surprise candidate emerges to take over as Chicago Bears head coach after Matt Eberflus was fired 
  Earlier this week, in an appearance on the Pat McAfee show, Rodgers said his first option is to keep playing in New York after the current season is up. I haven’t told anybody in my life that I wanna play in 2025 and not on the Jets,’ Rodgers told McAfee and co. on the ESPN program. ‘That’s 100 percent false and I actually said the opposite. I’m going to wait and see what happens at the end of the season and if they want me back. ‘But I’ve really enjoyed my time in New York. Obviously we haven’t had the success that we’ve all wanted to have but I’ve made some great friendships on the team. I’ve enjoyed living in Jersey.  ‘I don’t even know if I wanna play yet but New York would be my first option.’ The Jets are currently looking for a new head coach and general manager, two positions that will likely dictate how Rodgers’ future at the organization will eventually look. Robert Saleh was fired as Jets head coach earlier this season, with Jeff Ulbrich replacing him on an interim basis until the end of the season. Joe Douglas was later fired as Jets GM, too, signalling that there will be quite an overhaul in the offseason regardless of what happens with Rodgers.  The Jets are 3-8 going into Sunday’s game against the Seahawks, who are leading the NFC West. Victory is imperative to keep their slender hopes alive of making the postseason. Your email address will not be published.
