Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

"If there were ever a week to fire up Taysom Hill, week 10 is it",165,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gn89ek/if_there_were_ever_a_week_to_fire_up_taysom_hill/,1gn89ek,RVG_Steve,"Shaheed and Kendre on IR. Jamaal is doubtful having aggravated his groin injury (some reports claiming he has already been ruled out). Olave is most definitely out week 10. And now Cedrick Wilson has been ruled out.

Saints WRs are Mason Tipton, MVS and Jermaine Jackson. Honestly it will be more like Kamara WR1 and Taysom WR2.

Taysom will also be QB2, RB2 and TE1. Juwan Johnson is healthy but he’s no threat. The Saints offense will literally be Carr, Kamara and Hill. He’s going to see a lot of snaps and touches.

And he has historically performed really well against Atlanta. Back in week 4 he had 2 rushing TDs and 14.4 points before exiting due to injury having only played 20% of the snaps.

A lot of TE rankings I seen have Taysom way too low. Don’t want to get too hyped but this could easily be a 20+ point Taysom Hill explosion game incoming. It wouldn’t shock me in the least if Taysom ends up being the highest scoring TE on the week.

I could see him throwing, catching and rushing in a TD. Or 2 rushing TDs and 60+ receiving yards. That kind of upside is there for Hill in week 10.",2024-11-09 11:39:00,162,fantasyfootball

Could Trey Lance be Utilized as a Taysom Hill Type?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gn56rk/could_trey_lance_be_utilized_as_a_taysom_hill_type/,1gn56rk,Safe_Cold800,"Seems like he could make a great gadget player if used right. He was actually originally recruited in college as a WR but held out for a school that would play him at QB (though he did ball out in college).
At 6’4” 226lbs and with solid speed (ignore his 40 time as he never actually ran - he was clocked at 21+ mph in a game), he could definitely be an asset in that gadget role. 
Jerry’s been hinting at something coming as well…

"With the current uptick of great TE performances in an otherwise underwhelming season for TEs, who are your top 3 TEs ROS?",125,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gn2ome/with_the_current_uptick_of_great_te_performances/,1gn2ome,Street-Dare-3402,"After what seemed like a TE wasteland through the first four weeks of the season, we're finally in a position where TEs can explode at any given week. Guys like Cade Otton, David Njoku, Hunter Henry, and even Mike Gesicki have gone out and had amazing performances, with many TEs even salvaging some managers' games.

With that said, Kittle is still TE1 despite missing a game and having a Bye Week (dependent on your scoring system!), and Bowers and Kelce have still been relatively consistent with high end TE production.

I think my top 3 TEs ROS are

1. Kittle
2. Otton
3. Bowers

I could very obviously be way off the mark, but was wondering how people's perception on the TE spot looks like for ROS. 

Will someone else, like Mark Andrews keep getting hot? Will Hock take one of the spots? Will Kmet finally get looks? Will TEs look to have higher trade value moving forward? 

Did you somehow luck out and get two great TEs this season? Plenty stuff to talk about with TEs!

[Butler] McDaniel might be hinting at something when asked about playing time for Jaylen Wright amid Raheem Mostert's ball-security issues,231,https://x.com/alaboutsports/status/1854590880096956558?s=46,1gn257t,grindingaway69,,2024-11-09 04:32:32,64,fantasyfootball

Justin Herbert whirlwind this season. ,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gn16yq/justin_herbert_whirlwind_this_season/,1gn16yq,Impressive-Vast-8789,"First 2 seasons we got from Herbert were elite. A Top 5 finish his rookie season followed up by a top 2 finish his sophomore year. We knew we had a top 3 QB in our hands for years to come. 

Next 2 seasons were tough for Herbert, in 2022, he dealt with a nagging broken rib injury that he had suffered in Week 2 vs the Chiefs, it clearly affected his play for the remainder of the season resulting in a QB11 finish. The 2023 season was interesting for Justin Herbert, through the first 4 weeks he had 3 QB1 finishes. He lost Mike Williams, the offense took a hit and his floor regressed resulting 3 finishes outside the top 12 after his BYE week. Justin Herbert then fractured his index finger and missed the remainder of the 2023 season. 

Now fast forward to the 2024 offseason. Fantasy discourse around Herbert was that he now had a run-heavy scheme built around him with the departures of Keenan and Mike Williams and the arrival of Jim Harbaugh and Greg Roman who are known for establishing run-heavy approaches. So now, a guy who was being drafted in consensus as a top 5 QB for the first 3-4 years of his career, is now being drafted outside the top 15… Was his ADP correct? Well, first 4 weeks defintely showed that. JK Dobbins was a monster unleashed, racking up various RB1 finishes and being a waiver wire darling or late round steal for people. This resulted in 4 QB22 or worse finishes for Herbert, gross… 

Now coming out of the BYE, things changed, drastically, Chargers are now top 10 in the NFL in neutral pass rate since Week 6, Herbert has 3 games with over 275+ passing yards (had zero before the BYE), 2 Top 12 finishes and 0 turnovers. The situation around him is the best it’s ever been. Elite offensive line that lets him process the field. Elite defense thet gets him on the field frequently to dictate games. Herbert, in a real life aspect, is playing the best football of his career. 

Now this is where it gets interesting, Herbert actually has.. weapons? Ladd McConkey has been sound for the Chargers as a chain mover after the BYE. Joshua Palmer has shown chemistry with Herbert in the past when Mike Williams or Keenan Allen went down and has a knack for making difficult catches. Dobbins is one of the best pure runners in football averaging 4.9 YPC on 126 attempts. Quentin Johnston believe it or not is actually making catches and scoring TDs. 

The Chargers remaining schedule… Titans (9th), Bengals (29th), Ravens (32nd), Falcons (27th), Chiefs (14th), Buccaneers (31st), Denver (8th), NE (17th). I see 5 games that will have a 44-46 point total in Vegas Books leading up to the week that puts Herbert in a position to be throwing the ball. 

We’ve always known the talent Justin Herbert possesses, he’s a top 5 talent in the NFL when things around him are clicking. With the context surrounding Herbert in both offensive situation and a soft remaining schedule. Could he back into QB1 status? ",2024-11-09 03:38:46,54,fantasyfootball

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

---------------------

**PLEASE TRY TO ANSWER SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS BEFORE POSTING YOUR OWN**

* When answering questions, please make sure to **sort by NEW!**

----------------

Player Projections Powered by Vegas Player Props - Week 10,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gmw30q/player_projections_powered_by_vegas_player_props/,1gmw30q,MundaneNumber,"Intention and misdirection.  Perception subconsciously influencing your decision making.  Your heart says to start one player, yet your head is flailing over all the public rankings disagreeing with your decision.  Which voice is right?  

Voices in your head, the materialization of your brain's response mechanisms to stimuli.  Our major five senses (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch) send powerful signals throughout your nervous system, yet our brains interpret them in various ways.  I doubt NFL players feel pain the same way we do.  Which leads me into wondering, how valid are our interpretations of stimuli?  Arguably feelings are fake, a reality your brain conjures into existence.  Do you really control how the sodium and potassium ions move in your brain?  Imagine a life independent of feelings.  

Reach fantasy prowess through taking advantage of [VegasProjections.com](https://www.VegasProjections.com), the unbiased, statistically driven fantasy tool above all others.  We are on a constant improvement arc, with constant feature releases.  We have a new major feature, which I detail later in this post.  When you inevitably start to question if your heart is lying to you on a roster decision, why not check if the market agrees with you.  All figures here are driven by market data, where players have a financial incentive to protect their utility/money.  Hence leading to arguably the best predictor of reality you can find. 

Top 15\* rated skill players this week include: 

1. Alvin Kamara 20.73
2. Ja'Marr Chase 18.03
3. Kyren Williams 17.73
4. Joe Mixon 16.94
5. Bijan Robinson 16.81
6. Puka Nacua 16.69
7. Tyreek Hill 16.67
8. De'Von Achane 16.48
9. Saquon Barkley 16.12
10. Jonathan Taylor 15.98
11. Justin Jefferson 15.89
12. Tyrone Tracy 15.58
13. Jahmyr Gibbs 15.38
14. James Conner 15.32
15. Breece Hall 15.04

\*These figures are using the new mean projection feature, and Christian McCaffrey should probably be somewhere in this list but he's missing his reception o/u prop atm.

This week we see that Jayden has solidified his position as the best quarterback behind Lamar.  Let's go Maryland.  Never thought I'd live to see the day that the Redskins are good again.  Brock Purdy is on waivers in my league, yet highly respected by Vegas.  You might want to pick him up.  Achane is rightfully exploding up the rankings, with Saquon surprisingly slightly lagging behind.  Tyrone Tracy may be that rare midseason acquisition shooting you into championship relevance.  Forget about Puka throwing hands, as Vegas has him above Tyreek.  And stop doubting James Conner.  Kittle still has the highest projection, as Cade has vaulted into red tier status with him and Travis.

We have a major update for this week, namely mean projections extrapolated from the median projections.  Using some statistics through assuming a gamma distribution due to fantasy scoring being right-skewed, I have extrapolated two mean projections through shifting each median projection rightward based on a skewness calculation determined using this season's data, or recent data.  I also performed an accuracy analysis, to compare my projections to ESPN's projections.  Remarkably, for top 10-15 players with high ceilings within a position, my figures outperformed ESPN's figures.  In general across all players, the mean projections with all season data performed nearly identically to ESPN's projections, while the mean projections using recent data were less accurate.  Granted, I calculated this ""accuracy"" through mean absolute error, but I am experimenting with other techniques as I am concerned that players with lower projections may not have truly right-skewed distributions.  Note, recent data entails all data within the past six weeks, with a maximum of four data points and a minimum of three.  So players who have played all of the last six weeks are using only their most recent four performances, while players who have been injured for more than half of these six weeks are omitted.  Additionally, we have some styling updates to improve the user experience. 

Thanks for all the love, GL this week everyone!",2024-11-08 23:18:37,32,fantasyfootball

Week 10 Bold Predictions,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gmnf6o/week_10_bold_predictions/,1gmnf6o,Colin_McT,"The point of these bold predictions is to give managers a few players that *could* put up big numbers and swing your matchup.

I wouldn’t recommend substituting an obvious stud for these players, but if you’re looking for some juice with bye weeks or injuries to others, then consider these players in Week 10.

After solid picks in back-to-back weeks in 8 and 9, looking to keep things going in Week 10.

Please note: WR Amari Cooper is listed as questionable for Sunday. This was written before today.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Bypassing the Name Value: Which Players are Under or Over Rated Due to Reputation,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gmlruv/bypassing_the_name_value_which_players_are_under/,1gmlruv,19683dw,"My intent with this post is to discuss our name-based biases and evaluate players that are over and under rated based on expectations related to reputation. (All of my examples will be based on PPR scoring).

Trading deadlines are coming soon, and if you can identify who might be under rated, you might find an asset to pursue. (As a reminder, the best way to trade is figure out what you have that could make another team better, then see if you can build a deal which also makes you better from that position).

* As an example, Baker Mayfield is currently scoring the 2nd most points per game in 4PT passing TDs. His reputation likely places him in the 8-12 QB range for most people, but his performance is vastly exceeding that.

* Tee Higgins is currently 10th overall at WR (borderline WR1) on a per game basis.

* Patrick Mahomes, meanwhile, is averaging an 18th place in PPG, despite frequently starting. CJ Stroud, meanwhile, is 21st.

* Breece Hall is averaging 16th place in PPG, despite getting RB8ish value from many.

* Joe Mixon, meanwhile, is averaging 3rd best PPG performances when active.

My intent here is not to recap waiver wire or buy sell articles. Instead, where are players being underappreciated for their performance? What's notably missing from my examples are players that have picked up their performance recently. An example might be Cedric Tillman, who is getting talked about fairly often, but is also doing incredibly well. Is Tyrone Tracy another example? He's been more of a boom bust since taking the backfield from Singletary.

As we get closer to playoffs, this is the best time to attempt to consolidate talent. You don't need depth as much in the playoffs, not to say it's meaningless, but it's less valuable than high performing starters. At this point in the year, it's a reasonably good idea to overpay if you can increase your expected points in any given game.",2024-11-08 15:55:52,163,fantasyfootball

What is your current record?

Just curious.

Let's chat and analyze!

Edit: Bonus, if you feel like it, who are the players you drafted that are still on your roster???

Extra bonus if you tell us 1) who are some notable players you traded away and/or 2) who are some notable players you acquired via trades/waivers...

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful

8 Players to Buy/Sell/Hold + Injury Report,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gm4ivb/8_players_to_buysellhold_injury_report/,1gm4ivb,movesfantasy,"**Injury Report**

* **WR Tee Higgins** (quad) - doubtful for Thursday night.
* **WR Nico Collins** (hamstring) - eligible to return in Week 10, but is yet to practice. Per the Houston Chronicle’s Jonathan Alexander, only two Texans players have missed practice on a Thursday and played on a Sunday this season.
* **RB Christian McCaffrey** (achilles) - per Richard Sherman, who spoke to CMC himself: all signs point to CMC playing in Week 10, and probably playing a significant role.
* **QB Trevor Lawrence** (shoulder) - unlikely to play in Week 10, “weighing options” for treatment and could be out a while.
* **WR Drake London** (hip) - limited in practice Thursday, day-to-day.
* **WR AJ Brown** (knee) - full participant in practice Thursday, good sign for Week 10.
* **WR CeeDee Lamb** (shoulder) - Lamb himself says he’s good to go for Week 10.
* **WR Darius Slayton** (concussion) - unlikely to play in Week 10, per Daboll.
* **WR Keon Coleman** (wrist) - didn’t practice Thursday, hasn’t been ruled out for Week 10 yet, but recovery could take “more than just this week” per Sean McDermott.
* **WR Amari Cooper** (wrist) - limited in Thursday’s practice, seems to be trending the right way for Week 10.
* **RB Jonathon Brooks** (knee) - activated on Wednesday, full practice participant all week, trending towards a Week 10 debut.
* **WR Chris Olave** (concussion) - per Saints interim head coach Darren Rizzi, Olave and his family want to be thorough with the recovery process given his history of concussions. Likely out multiple weeks.
* **QB Dak Prescott** (hamstring) - partial avulsion of right hamstring, best case recovery timetable is 4-6 weeks per NFL Network’s Jane Slater.

**Buy RB Aaron Jones**

While doing my research for this post, this was the screaming buy that stood out to me the most - I had to put Jones at the top of this list. Since returning from injury in Week 7, Aaron Jones’ role has been amazing. From Weeks 7-9, Jones has the 3rd-highest snap share among all running backs (76.1%), the 5th-highest route share (58.1%), and the 5th-highest percentage of his team’s High Value Touches (86%). With this kind of usage, you would think that Jones has performed as a clear-cut RB1 in fantasy. However, over the last three weeks, he’s been the RB23 overall, with just 14.8 fantasy points per game. And it’s not like he’s been bad, either - he’s PFF’s 6th-highest graded running back on the season. What’s the problem, then? Touchdowns. Jones has just 1 touchdown in the last three weeks and 3 total on the season. Based on his usage this season, Jones’ expected touchdown total is 6.9 TDs per PFF, 5th-highest among all running backs. Here’s the kicker - his expected vs. actual touchdown differential of -3.9 TDs is the highest among all running backs on the season, making Jones a massive positive regression candidate and the best buy-low opportunity at the position. If that wasn’t enough, the Vikings have the 3rd-best schedule for running backs the rest of the season by fantasy points allowed over expectation to the position. Act fast - the Vikings play the Jaguars in Week 10, the 3rd-best matchup for running backs by the same metric. After this week, the secret may be out on Jones, and your buy-low window could be slammed shut. Take a break from reading this post and text/call/e-mail/fax the Jones manager in your league with an offer immediately.

**Sell RB Derrick Henry**

Look, I know. I didn’t want to write this either. But I think right now, as fantasy’s overall RB1, is the time to…clears throat…sell Derrick Henry. His value will never be higher than it is right now, and here’s why. Remember that expected vs. actual TDs metric I mentioned in the Aaron Jones section above? Derrick Henry sits at the top of the list with the most touchdowns over expected among all running backs this season. His expected total of 7.72 TDs is awesome by itself and is the 2nd-highest among all running backs. However, his actual total of 13 touchdowns gives him a differential of 5.28 TDs over expected. Not only is that the highest differential at the running back position, but the next-highest figure is 3.14 touchdowns over expected (James Cook, for those curious). That’s a whopping 2-touchdown difference between Henry and the next highest TD over-performer. Ok, so we have established that Derrick Henry is due for some regression in the TD category, but he does still have the 2nd-highest expected TD total among all running backs. So, why sell? Well, I think that expected TD figure could drop significantly given the Ravens’ upcoming schedule. The Ravens have the 2nd-worst schedule for running backs the rest of the season by fantasy points allowed over expectation to the position. Additionally, if Henry struggles to get there on the ground, he’s not going to make up for it in the receiving game - he has just 10 targets on the season. With a primetime matchup on deck against a Bengals defense that is the 10th-worst matchup for fantasy RBs, now is the time to cash in and sell fantasy’s overall RB1.

**Hold WR DeAndre Hopkins**

In case you were considering cashing in on Hopkins’ 2-TD performance on MNF - don’t. Hopkins played on 60.2% of snaps in Week 9 and ran a route on 62.0% of dropbacks, up from 32.4% of snaps and a 33.3% route share in his first game as a Chief in Week 8. He was able to earn 9 targets (a 20.5% target share) and finished the week as the overall WR4 in both expected fantasy points and actual fantasy points. Admittedly, Hopkins’ schedule isn’t great, as the Chiefs’ next four games are all against bottom-7 matchups for wide receivers by fantasy points allowed over expectation. However, their schedule for the fantasy playoffs is nothing to shy away from. To be honest, I’m just not super concerned about the Chiefs’ ability to produce in bad matchups, and I’m not remotely worried about Juju Smith-Schuster’s eventual return to the lineup. Hopkins is the most talented wide receiver on a team quarterbacked by Patrick Mahomes - HOLD!

**Buy RB Breece Hall**

Look, I don’t need to sell anyone who’s reading this on Breece Hall’s talent level. However, it’s been kind of a weird season for Hall, and you may be able to pry him from a concerned manager. After ceding significant work to Braelon Allen early in the season, Breece Hall has regained his workhorse role since Robert Saleh was fired following the Jets’ Week 5 loss to the Vikings. In the 4 weeks since, Hall has the 4th-highest snap share (79.6%) among all running backs, the 4th-highest target share (15.7%), and the 6th-highest expected fantasy points per game (19.0). However, over the last two weeks, Hall is averaging just 10.2 fantasy points per game (overall RB32), presenting a nice buying opportunity if there is a short-sighted manager in your league looking to sell. The Jets have the best remaining schedule for running backs by fantasy points allowed over expectation, and they get the Cardinals in Week 10, the 2nd-best matchup for running backs by the same metric. Go get Breece now before the price of the brick goes up.

**Sell WR Jayden Reed**

Jayden Reed leads all wide receivers in fantasy points over expectation this season with 47.7, per PFF. While Reed is currently the WR19 in fantasy points per game (14.8), his expected fantasy points per game (9.5) would have him as the WR54! Reed has gotten there with explosive plays, but has earned more than 6 targets in just one game this season. That game was Week 4 vs. the Vikings, where Christian Watson was lost for the game in the first quarter to an ankle injury. Reed saw a season-high 8 targets in that one, good for just a 14.8% target share given Love’s 54 pass attempts. With the Packers’ WR corps healthy and the emergence of TE Tucker Kraft as a weapon, there are simply too many mouths to feed on this offense. Reed is explosive and will have his share of big plays, but I’d be looking to sell coming off his Week 9 16.3-fantasy point performance. Wait too long and you may just miss your sell window - the Packers play the Bears in Week 11, the 3rd-worst matchup for wide receivers by fantasy points allowed over expectation.

**Buy WR Malik Nabers**

Excluding the two games he missed with a concussion, Malik Nabers trails only Cooper Kupp and Nico Collins among all wide receivers in expected fantasy points per game this season (19.6). His usage has been awesome, leading all wide receivers in targets (83), target share (34.9%), air yards (883), air yards share (50.6%), and first read percentage (45.6%) in the 7 games he’s played. Despite such monster usage, Nabers has just two weekly fantasy finishes inside the top 5 at the position and four finishes outside of the top 20, meaning his fantasy managers might not realize what they’re sitting on. The Giants’ offense is largely to blame, as Daniel Jones is averaging just 208.9 passing yards per game, 22nd among all quarterbacks. The good news, however, is that the Giants have a favorable upcoming schedule for fantasy WRs - the 10th-best rest-of-season schedule and the 7th-best fantasy playoff schedule by fantasy points allowed over expected to the position. Coming off a Week 9 game in which Nabers was targeted just once in the first half (yet still went 9-59), I’d be eager to buy the single best role at the wide receiver position.

**Sell RB Jahmyr Gibbs**

Despite his current status as the overall RB7 in fantasy points per game with 18.8, Gibbs is just the RB22 in expected fantasy points per game with 13.8. He has massively outperformed his utilization with explosive play after explosive play, resulting in his 2.38 touchdowns over expected this season, the 4th-highest TD overperformance among all running backs. Additionally his usage in the Lions’ split backfield has grown increasingly concerning. Gibbs is averaging 12.75 carries per game but, more concerningly, just 3.13 targets per game. In Week 9, Gibbs recorded season-lows in snap share (36.4%), rush attempt share (34%), and route share (21.7%), yet scored a touchdown to salvage his day with 14.6 fantasy points. Additionally, he hasn’t topped a 10% target share in either of the last two games. The usage simply isn’t appealing or reliable, as the Lions love to pound the rock with David Montgomery, and Gibbs’ production is coming on insane efficiency rather than elite usage. Gibbs is an explosive, talented player who will continue to create big plays on a high-scoring offense, but I’d be looking to sell at the RB7 price tag based on his utilization profile. The Lions get the Texans in Week 11, the 4th-toughest matchup for running backs by fantasy points allowed over expectation. I’d be looking to move him before the game.

**Buy TE Dalton Kincaid**

Kincaid is the overall TE15 on the year, averaging just 8.6 fantasy points per game. However, his underlying usage tells a much different story. On the season, Kincaid has the 6th-highest target share (19.2%), the 4th-highest air yards share (21.6%), and the 5th-highest targets per route run (0.26) among starting tight ends. For some reason, Kincaid’s awesome utilization just hasn’t yet converted to fantasy production. In Week 9, Kincaid led all tight ends in underperformance, scoring just 7.2 fantasy points versus an expected 16.2 points based on his usage. Consequently, a buy-low window has opened at the perfect time. The Bills play the Colts in Week 10, the 3rd-best matchup for tight ends based on fantasy points allowed over expectation. Buy Kincaid’s strong utilization now before it starts converting to production as early as this week.",2024-11-07 23:33:28,66,fantasyfootball
FGB's Week 10 Flex Projections,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gm3ydk/fgbs_week_10_flex_projections/,1gm3ydk,FantasyGoldenBoy,"# Week 9 Recap

Mean Absolute Error(MAE) is the average absolute gap between my projections and the final score of each player.  Decision Success Rate(DSR) is how often a decision made based on these projections, between any two players, would be correct(.9 point buffer).

**Mean Absolute Error**

* Overall = 4.6
* Flex Range(36-100) = 5.0
* RB = 4.3
* WR = 5.2
* TE = 4.0

**Decision Success Rate**

* Top 175 = 76.93%
* Flex Range = 76.71%

Week 9 was another solid week.  Wide Receivers dragged the overall average down as they were the highest MAE position and had the single largest miss(Jaxon Smith-Njigba - proj. 9.4, actual 33.5, diff. 24.1). It was also Deandre Hopkins that I felt like I got the most questions on and was way off, I obviously did not expect this large of an increase in work so quickly.

# Week 10 Half PPR Projections

Projections focused on predicting touchdowns using high value plays adjusted for match-ups, weather, game script and implied team totals among many other factors.

|Position|High Value Plays for projecting TDs|Weather|Spread|Implied Team Total|Matchup|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Wide Receiver|1st Read Targets inside the 20 and 1st Read Targets with 20+ AY|High Wind effects performance adjusted for each receivers individual aDOT|Adjusts usage for expected blowouts|Adjusts touchdown chance|CB/WR Matchup rating and Coverage Grades from ([www.fantasypoints.com](http://www.fantasypoints.com)) as well as adjusted points allowed to alignment(Wide/Slot).|
|Running Back|Designed Carries inside the 20 and Routes run inside the 20|NA|Adjusts usage for expected blowouts|Adjusts touchdown chance|OL/DL grade, adjusted rec pts allowed to backfield and adjusted neutral game script YPC|
|Tight End|1st Read targets inside the 20|NA|Adjusts usage for expected blowouts|Adjusts touchdown chance|Adjusted pts allowed to Wide/Slot/Inline|

**Weather** : NE vs CHI has some high winds, currently projected as a minor knock to the passing game, especially higher aDOT players.  PIT vs WAS has some scattered showers but nothing major yet, a slight decrease to passing efficiency is projected.

**Injuries** : All injuries are based off of projected lineups and injury reports, many of the Questionables will be projected here until Friday practice reports, any non projected players either have flagged phrases like ""not expected to play"" in their injury report or are not in expected lineups.  I do not have inside information, I go off of Rotogrinders projected lineups and ESPN injury reports.

Please feel free to ask any questions/leave criticisms about roster decisions or the projections themselves, good luck!

The Rookie Report: Week 10 Starts & Sits,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gm3lya/the_rookie_report_week_10_starts_sits/,1gm3lya,xylopolist,"Welcome back to the Rookie Report! We’re now halfway through the NFL season, and that means we’re entering the closing stretch of the fantasy regular season. In most fantasy leagues, you’ve got 5 weeks left to improve your positioning and make a push for the playoffs. Make sure you know where you stand at this point, and act accordingly going forward. If you’re on the outside of the playoff picture looking in, maybe explore some trades to improve the roster. If you’re in good position, keep doing the things that got you here, but don’t be afraid to look at ways to upgrade your roster as we inch closer to the playoffs. The next 5 weeks should be a lot of fun.

 

Week 10 features 4 teams on byes, but lucky for us, Brock Bowers is the only notable rookie that has the week off, so we’ve got plenty to talk about. This week’s article is being dropped a little earlier than usual due to a pre-planned personal engagement, so keep a close eye on the reporting as the week goes on before locking in any lineup decisions based on the info below. There are a lot of injury updates to monitor and make sure you’re making final decisions with the most complete information.

 

A couple of housekeeping notes for the players listed below – All players listed under the same header at the same position are listed in the order that I would play them this week. All usage rates (snap share, target rate, air yardage share, etc.) are from the MB Fantasy Life Utilization Tool from Dwain McFarland, and all references to fantasy points and points allowed rankings are based on half-PPR scoring unless otherwise noted.

 

Let’s dive into week 10…

 

**Rookies You Already Know You Should Start:**

**QB Jayden Daniels, WAS (Wk. 10: vs. Pit.):** Daniels faces one of the toughest matchups he’s faced this season against the Steelers, but Daniels is the QB4 in PPG for the season, and he finished as a QB1 the only other time he faced a top QB defense. If you have another top-10 QB and really don’t like the matchup here, I wouldn’t fault you for being worried, but in my opinion, the upside of Daniels is too great to sit, even in a tough spot like this. The Steelers have allowed the 3^(rd)\-fewest QB points per game, and the 2^(nd)\-fewest QB rushing yards per game.

 

**WR Malik Nabers, NYG (Wk. 10: @ Car.):** Nabers has now finished as worse than the PPR WR20 in three straight games, but he’s still finished in the top-36 every single game he’s played and he’s still dominating the looks in this offense. Carolina ranks 31^(st) in FTN’s pass defense DVOA, and Nabers is a virtual lock to see a 30% or higher target share against that defense. I like him to get back on track this week, but even if he doesn’t, a WR3 floor is a nice starting point.

 

**Borderline Rookies I’d Lean Toward Starting:**

**QB Caleb Williams, CHI (Wk. 10: vs. NE):** I’m not sure I’d want to plug in Caleb as my starting QB in a 12-team league, but I list him in this section to signify that I like him more this week than I do his fellow rookie signal callers Bo Nix and Drake Maye. Caleb has struggled mightily in the passing game the last couple weeks, but I have a feeling a matchup with the Patriots is just what the doctor ordered to get him back on track throwing the ball. New England ranks 30^(th) in pass defense DVOA. They’ve allowed 7 of the last 8 QBs they’ve faced to score 15+ fantasy points, and they’ve allowed 3 of the last 4 to throw for multiple TDs, including 2 scores by Mason Rudolph last weekend. We did see a 4-game stretch of Caleb playing well against bad pass defense prior to the last two down games, and 3 of those strong games were in Chicago, where they’ll be playing this week. I like his chances to get back on track. I’d view Caleb as a high-end QB2 this week in spite of his recent poor play.

 

**RB Tyrone Tracy, NYG (Wk. 10: @ Car.):** In 3 games since Devin Singletary returned from his groin injury, Tracy has averaged 16 touches per game and played at least a 60% snap share in each contest. Against the abysmal Panthers’ defense, that makes him a top-20 RB option this week. The Panthers rank dead last in run defense DVOA and have allowed the most RB points per game.

 

**RB Bucky Irving, TB (Wk. 10: vs. SF):** Irving played his lowest snap share since week 3 on Monday night and barely finished inside the top-40 RBs for the week, but it was just his first finish outside the top-20 RBs in the last month. This week’s matchup with SF looks tough at first glance, but the 49ers rank just 19^(th) in run defense DVOA, and the Bucs’ passing game should continue to heavily feature the running backs due to injuries to WRs. With 4 teams on byes in week 10, that’s just enough to get Irving to the right side of the cut line for me as a flex option.

 

**WR Brian Thomas, Jr., JAX (Wk. 10: vs. Min.):** Thomas is coming off his worst fantasy performance in weeks, finishing with just 2 catches for 22 yards and adding a 2-point conversion. The issue seems to be that he earned just a 10% target share despite being in a route on 97% of the team passing dropbacks. That won’t be the norm going forward, and I expect him to get some squeaky wheel treatment this week and be peppered with more targets than usual. The Vikings have a good pass defense, but still allow the 2^(nd)\-most WR points per game. BTJ should return to the WR2 ranks this week. This outlook changes if Trevor Lawrence is unable to play this week. Doug Pederson hinted on Wednesday that there’s a chance that he might sit due to an ‘upper body injury’. If T-Law sits, Thomas becomes more of a WR4 option with Mac Jones under center. Luckily the Jaguars play at noon Sunday, so most replacement options should be on the table still at that point.

 

**WR Keon Coleman, BUF (Wk. 10: @ Ind.):** This is going to sound counter-intuitive, but it seems like Keon Coleman is a better fantasy play if Amari Cooper is active this week, rather than out. Coleman has earned 7+ targets exactly twice this season. He’s finished as a top-20 PPR WR exactly twice. Those performances happened in the two games that Amari Cooper was on the field for Buffalo. With Cooper out last week, Coleman was targeted just twice and pulled in 1 catch for 21 yards. I’m guessing it’s more coincidence than correlation, but I’m willing to lean into the coincidence this week if Cooper returns as the Colts rank 28^(th) in pass defense DVOA and have allowed the 2^(nd)\-most completions of 40+ yards this season. Coleman will be boom or bust as usual, but I like his chances to bounce back and boom this week against a bad Indy secondary.

 

**WR Ladd McConkey, LAC (Wk. 10: vs. Ten.):** McConkey has finished as a PPR WR3 or better in 4 of his last 5 games, and while this week’s matchup is a tough one – the Titans allow the 4^(th)\-fewest WR points per game – I still like McConkey’s chances of compiling his way to another solid PPR performance. In their last 4 games, the Titans have allowed 3 different slot WRs to reach 7 receptions against them (Khalil Shakir, Demario Douglas and Josh Downs). I’ve talked in this space about how good McConkey has been vs. man coverage before, and the Titans’ man coverage rate is in the top-10 in the league.

 

**WR Xavier Legette, CAR (Wk. 10: vs. NYG):** With Diontae Johnson out of his way, Legette has served as the Panthers’ WR1 over the last two weeks, and he’s logged back-to-back top-30 PPR finishes as a result. Bryce Young being back under center hasn’t been a problem for him, and this week Legette figures to see a lot of Giants’ corner Deonte Banks, who is allowing nearly a half a PPR point per route run into his coverage despite being targeted on just 22% of those coverage routes. The return of Adam Thielen could complicate things for Legette when it comes to target share, but Thielen should have zero impact on Xavier’s snap share. The opposing WR1 facing the Giants has gone for 70+ yards and/or a TD in 6 of their last 7 games. Legette is an upside WR3 this week, with even bigger upside if Thielen somehow sits again.

 

**WR Marvin Harrison, Jr., ARI (Wk. 10: vs. NYJ):** I know, Harrison is getting harder to trust each week that he underperforms, but the biggest issue last week was low passing volume due to a blowout win. Harrison’s 5 targets still accounted for a 26% target share and a 66% air yardage share, but that doesn’t change the fact that in his last 4 healthy games, Harrison has finished outside the top-45 PPR WRs 3 times. A matchup this week with the Jets, who allow the 2^(nd)\-fewest WR points per game doesn’t exactly make you feel better about playing him, but at least a couple WR1s have had success against the Jets in recent weeks. Tank Dell posted 6-126 last week, and George Pickens posted 5-111-1 in week 7. There’s obvious downside here, but few WRs offer the top-12 ceiling that Harrison does. I’d probably be willing to roll him out there as a WR3/flex option this week despite the tough matchup and recent struggles.

 

**Borderline Rookies I’d Lean Toward Sitting:**

**QB Bo Nix, DEN (Wk. 10: @ KC):** Nix will likely be a passable mid-range QB2 this week, but I wouldn’t count on a ceiling week against a KC defense that ranks 7^(th) in pass defense DVOA and has allowed just 193 passing yards per game in their last 5 contests. They’re not completely invulnerable though, as KC has allowed 2 total TDs to each of the last 4 QBs they’ve faced, and hasn’t held a single QB below 11 points this season. There’s a floor here, even if not much ceiling. I’d expect Nix’s passing volume to be on the higher side with KC favored by 8 points, and he’ll still have his regular rushing upside, but this probably isn’t a week where he’ll wind up in the top-10 QBs.

 

**QB Drake Maye, NE (Wk. 10: @ Chi.):** In the 3 full games Maye has played this season, he’s scored at least 17.7 fantasy points in each and finished as QB17 or better in all 3 games, but he faces a Chicago defense that allows the fewest QB points per game and has allowed just 2 QBs all season to reach 15+ fantasy points. I would expect Drake to post his worst performance to-date, and would treat him like a lower-end QB2 option.

 

**RB Isaac Guerendo, SF (Wk. 10: @ TB):** Guerendo made the most of his opportunities ahead of the 49ers’ bye last week, but all signs point to Christian McCaffrey returning this week, and Jordan Mason will likely be back as well (Kyle Shanahan hinted that he could’ve probably gone back into their week 8 game if Guerendo wasn’t playing well). If CMC is back as expected, I wouldn’t give strong consideration to Guerendo, even if Mason is out. If only Mason returns, there’d be a little more hope that Isaac can peel off enough work to be useful against a Tampa defense that allows the 7^(th)\-most RB points per game, but he’d still be a dicey option. If both CMC and Mason remain out, then I’d treat Guerendo as a strong RB2 option in a plus matchup.

 

**WR Jalen McMillan, TB (Wk. 10: vs. SF):** McMillan missed last Monday’s contest with a hamstring injury, and it remains to be seen if he’ll be able to get cleared to play this week against the 49ers. In McMillan’s absence on Monday, no receiver really took the reins of the WR1 role as 4 different wideouts combined for 13 total targets (Sterling Shepard led the way with 5). If McMillan returns, there’s a good chance that he’ll step into the WR1 role if Mike Evans remains sidelined. That lead role led to 15 total targets for McMillan in his last 2 games, but he fell short of double-digit PPR points in both games despite facing bottom-10 WR defenses. If McMillan is active, he should have a big enough role for fantasy consideration, but the combination of the injury, the limited production with the full-time role, and the fact the 49ers rank 2^(nd) in pass defense DVOA all adds up to me leaning against playing Jalen this week.

 

**WR Xavier Worthy, KC (Wk. 10: vs. Den.):** Now that DeAndre Hopkins is fully integrated into the KC offense, it looks like he could be a problem for Worthy. Xavier was limited to just 2 targets on Monday night on 40 routes run, and he pulled in zero catches and added negative-10 rushing yards to boot. I’d expect the Chiefs to still look to take deep shots to Worthy to keep defenses on their toes, but his 32% and 24% target shares from weeks 7 & 8 are likely a thing of the past. There’s still upside here if you need a boom-or-bust WR4, but the Broncos rank 9^(th) in the league on pass defense DVOA on deep throws, so I’d lean against plugging the rookie into lineups this week.

 

**WR Jalen Coker, CAR (Wk. 10: vs. NYG):** Coker’s role is very much in flux moving forward now that the Panthers have officially not traded away Adam Thielen ahead of the trade deadline. Coker was limited to a 59% route participation rate last weekend while both David Moore and Xavier Legette logged rates above 90%. Some of those lost snaps went to Jonathan Mingo, who is no longer a Panther, but Thielen’s return will replace Mingo with an even bigger threat to Coker. Both Coker and Thielen have been primarily used in the slot by Carolina, but the hope for Coker is that Thielen will replace David Moore on the perimeter rather than Coker. But even if that happens, the Giants are more vulnerable on the perimeter than in the slot. Pay attention to the reporting here. If Thielen sits another week, Coker is probably a passable WR4 against a New York defense that ranks 24^(th) in pass defense DVOA. If Thielen plays, He’s probably a risky WR5.

 

**WR Mason Tipton, NO (Wk. 10: vs. Atl.):** It doesn’t seem to matter how many wide receivers are out for the Saints, Tipton just keeps failing to produce. He’s logged an 85% or higher route participation rate in each of the last 3 games but has just one finish all year higher than the WR60 to show for it. Atlanta does allow the 9^(th)\-most WR points per game, but I’m not counting on Tipton cashing in on this good matchup. The Saints will likely lean heavily on the run game and Taysom Hill to get by until Chris Olave returns. I’d view Tipton as a dicey WR4/5 option.

 

**TE Ja’Tavion Sanders, CAR (Wk. 10: vs. NYG):** I mention Sanders here with the caveat that I like him less if Tommy Tremble is active this week, but if Tremble is out as he was last week, Ja’Tavion has some modest appeal as a fill in TE1 this week. We’ve seen him post lines of 5-49, 6-61, and 4-87 in the last 3 games that Tremble missed, but the matchup this week isn’t a great one. The Giants have allowed the 3^(rd)\-fewest TE points per game, and only Jake Ferguson and Zach Ertz have posted double-digit PPR points against them. Some of their success has been due to facing mostly weak TE competition, but they haven’t allowed a tight end touchdown all season long.

 

**TE Theo Johnson, NYG (Wk. 10: @ Car.):** Johnson has finally started to produce some fantasy points in the last two weeks, totaling 6-86-1 on 10 targets in the last two contests. A 35-yard TD last Sunday helped him to a PPR TE7 finish for the week. The concern is that most of his production has come during furious efforts by the Giants to come from behind at the end of those games. Of that production listed above, 4-78-1 of it has come in the final 4 minutes of those games with the Giants down at least a touchdown. The Panthers have been the worst defense in the league at limiting TE fantasy points, but I’m not sure there will be garbage time production in a game the Giants are favored to win by 5 points. I think Theo would be fine to use as a TE2 this week, but would be uncomfortable plugging him in as a fill-in TE1, even in this very good matchup.

 

**Rookies You Already Know You Should Sit:**

**RB Trey Benson, ARI (Wk. 10: vs. NYJ):** Benson posted his best fantasy game of the season last week, finishing with 55 yards and a TD on 9 touches. I’m not convinced it’s a sign of things to come. He scored his touchdown with James Conner on the sideline after taking a hard hit near the goal line, and most of Benson’s touches came in the 4^(th) quarter when the game was essentially over. The Cardinals have won 4 of their past 5 games, but 3 of those 4 wins were decided by less than a field goal. Benson totaled just 1 touch in those 3 games. Arizona is favored by just a single point this week. The Jets rank just 24^(th) in run defense DVOA, but you can’t count on Benson to play enough to take advantage.

 

**RB Braelon Allen, NYJ (Wk. 10: @ Ari.):** While Allen’s playing time has ticked back up in the last couple weeks, he’s still finished as a top-40 fantasy RB just once in the last 6 games. I wouldn’t roll the dice on a breakout here, even against an Arizona defense that allows the 9^(th)\-most RB points per game. Allen is still playing less than 35% of the offensive snaps.

 

**RB Jonathan Brooks, CAR (Wk. 10: vs. NYG):** Brooks will likely finally be active this week. If the Panthers don’t activate him, his practice window closes, and he sits for the full year. With that said, he’s still going to have work to do if he wants to put any dent in Chuba Hubbard’s RB1 workload. Hubbard has played 75% or more of the snaps in each of the last 4 games.

 

**RB Jaylen Wright, MIA (Wk. 10: @ LAR):** Over the last 3 weeks with both Raheem Mostert and De’Von Achane healthy, Wright have averaged just 6 snaps and 2.6 PPR points per game. I don’t see a good reason to expect a spike in those numbers this week in a game that should be close (Dolphins are 2.5-point underdogs).

 

**RB Kimani Vidal, LAC (Wk. 10 : vs. Ten.):** Over the past 3 games, Vidal has totaled 42 yards on 15 touches. The Titans rank 5^(th) in run defense DVOA. 5 touches against that Titans’ defense probably won’t result in significantly better efficiency than we’ve seen from Vidal in recent weeks.

 

**RB Carson Steele, KC (Wk. 10: vs. Den.):** Steele has not reached a 20% snap share or reached 3 PPR points in a game since week 3.

 

**RB Blake Corum, LAR (Wk. 10: vs. Mia.):** Corum hasn’t played more than 15% of the offensive snaps in any game this season, and he’s totaled just 28 scrimmage yards on 9 touches in the last 3 games. The Dolphins can be run on, but Kyren Williams will be the one doing the running.

 

**RB Audric Estime, DEN (Wk. 10: @ KC):** It’s up to you if you want to believe Sean Payton when he says Estime is going to see an increased workload going forward. It’s not the first time Payton has said it this season, but Estime hasn’t played more than a 10% snap share in any game this season and has topped out at 3.5 PPR points. Those season highs were hit just last weekend, but most of the opportunities came in the 4^(th) quarter of a blowout loss. They could get blown out again this week by the Chiefs, but KC ranks 2^(nd) in run defense DVOA and allows the fewest RB fantasy points per game. It’ll take a substantial increase in playing time for Estime to be a viable fantasy option.

 

**WRs Troy Franklin & Devaughn Vele, DEN (Wk. 10: @ KC):** Franklin and Vele both failed to come through last week against a Baltimore defense that allows the most WR points per game. I wouldn’t count on a bounce back against the Chiefs, who rank 7^(th) in pass defense DVOA and have allowed the 9^(th)\-fewest WR points per game. If you were desperate to pick one of these WRs to play, I’d lean towards Franklin since he fares better than Vele against man coverage and KC ranks in the top-10 in the NFL in man coverage rate, but neither player is a good option this week.

 

**WR Adonai Mitchell, IND (Wk. 10: vs. Buf.):** Mitchell was limited to just 4 routes run in week 9 as he logged his lowest route participation rate since week 3. He was targeted just once and turned that target into a 22-yard catch. The switch to Flacco should be better for Mitchell when he’s on the field, but he’s not playing enough that you can count on him even as a deep ball dart throw.

 

**WR Ja’Lynn Polk, NE (Wk. 10: @ Chi.):** Polk was down to just an 11% route participation rate in week 9, his lowest mark of the season. Even if that number bounces back a bit this week, the Bears allow the fewest WR points per game.

 

**WR Luke McCaffrey, WAS (Wk. 10: vs. Pit.):** McCaffrey has been targeted just 3 times in the last 4 games. He’s just not involved enough to consider.  

 

**WR Jermaine Burton, CIN (Wk. 10: @ Bal.):** Burton missed the team walkthrough last Saturday and was a healthy scratch on Sunday as a result, just days after Joe Burrow talked about him playing a bigger role. I’d expect him to be in Zac Taylor’s doghouse for at least a couple weeks. This is a week where Burton would have some sleeper appeal if we knew he would play a meaningful role. Tee Higgins is expected to sit again, and the Ravens allow the most WR points per game. Instead, I’d expect to see a lot of Andrei Iosivas and Trenton Irwin in 3-wide sets if Tee Higgins sits again.

 

**WR Malachi Corley, NYJ (Wk. 10: @ Ari.):** Corley recorded his first touch since week two last Thursday, and it looked like that touch was going to result in a rushing TD, but the rookie dropped the ball short of the goal line and wasn’t heard from again for the rest of the night. The Jets did trade Mike Williams ahead of the deadline this week, and Allen Lazard remains on injured reserve, so the Jets might not have a choice but to start using Corley more, but for now he remains at best the team WR4 behind Garrett Wilson, Davante Adams, and Xavier Gipson. Monitor his usage this week. If there’s a big spike, he may be worth a pickup in the deepest of leagues.

 

**Deep League Sleepers and Stashes:**

**RB Ray Davis, BUF (Wk. 10: @ Ind.):** Davis in week 9 played his lowest snap share in about a month (14%), but he posted his second-best fantasy day in the process. He turned just 6 touches on 8 snaps into 90 yards and a TD. I wouldn’t expect that kind of performance to repeat itself if he plays such limited snaps again in week 10, but I think he’s earned more playing time this week against a middling Colts’ run defense that has allowed 120+ rushing yards in 7 of their 9 games this year. James Cook is still going to be on the field for more than 50% of the offensive plays, but this strikes me as a week where we’ll see a lot more Davis than Ty Johnson behind Cook. Don’t be surprised if Davis ends up with double-digit touches, and finds his way to an RB3 performance against a beatable Indy defense.

 

**WR Rome Odunze, CHI (Wk. 10: vs. NE):** Odunze has mostly had a disappointing rookie season, but he showed signs of life last weekend in Arizona as the Bears finally treated him like an important part of the passing game as he finished with 5-104 on 7 targets. I’ve been fooled by Odunze after a big game once before (6-112-1 in week 3), so I’m not going to go all-in on him this week, but if his usage last week carries over, he’s got WR3 upside in a matchup against the Patriots, who rank 30^(th) in pass defense DVOA. It feels like Caleb is due for a bounce back passing effort after a couple down weeks, and if that happens, Odunze will hopefully get some of the benefit. There’s risk here given Odunze’s up and down production this season, but I wouldn’t be afraid to try Rome if you’re in a tight lineup spot due to byes. 

 

**WR Ricky Pearsall, SF (Wk. 10: @ TB):** The 49ers could be close to full strength this week with Christian McCaffrey, Jordan Mason and Jauan Jennings all possibly returning, but don’t forget about Pearsall in this offense. The rookie should still be a starter in 3-WR sets with Jennings back, and while the touches could be consolidated to the stars, I expect Pearsall’s role to continue to grow as he gets more NFL reps under his belt. Juan Jennings isn’t supposed to be a focal point of this passing game, and the 49ers are hoping Pearsall can be the Aiyuk replacement they need. We’ve already seen his big play ability on a 39-yard run against Dallas. There’s risk that Pearsall could be limited to just a handful of targets this week, but the Bucs allow the 7^(th)\-most WR points per game, and due to injuries will be starting CBs that opened the season on the 2^(nd) and 3^(rd)\-string of the depth chart. Pearsall is probably no more than an upside WR4/5, but the 49ers have one of the higher team totals of the week, and Pearsall should face favorable individual matchups.

 

That’s all I’ve got for this week. Hopefully it helps you sort through your lineup decisions and find your way to a win this weekend. Feel free to hit me up on Twitter/X (@Shawn\_Foss) if you have any questions or want to yell at me about anything written above, and always make sure to apply what’s written in the context of your own league rules and roster. Keep a close eye on the injury report throughout the week if you have any guys who are questionable and do a final pre-game check to make sure you don’t start any inactive players. As always: Good luck, trust your gut and have fun. It’s just a game.

For those who need a TE streamer, who are you adding? For those with Mike Gesicki, what’s your confidence level in the Bengals’ TE?

Pollard ROS Outlook?,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gm23eu/pollard_ros_outlook/,1gm23eu,CrustyEyeBalls,"We've seen them say they want creatively manage his workload, whatever that means, and spears will be coming back probably this week. But Pollards numbers have looked good both with and without spears.

Through weeks 1-4 (with Spears, Spears played in week 6 but was injured during that game)

* 15.4 Weighted Opportunities per Game - Tied for 13th Among RBs
* 13% Tgt Share - 9th Among RBs
* 14.6 FP/G - 21st among RBs
* 14.8 xFP/G - 18th Among RBs
* 62.7% Snap Share
* 58.1% of Rush Attempts

He had 3 carries inside the 5, 100% of his teams attempts, 60% inside the 10, and 56.3% inside the 20

Now Lets take a look at the weeks without Spears (7-9)

* 19.2 WO/G - 6th Among RBs
* 11.7% TGT Share - 11th Among RBs
* 13.9 FP/G - 24th Among RBs
* 17.8 xFP/G - 7th Among RBs
* 89% Snap Share
* 66.7% of Rush Attempts

Pollard obviously saw an increased workload without spears, but a decrease in tgt share. He also scored less PPG during that time, although was pretty significantly below his expected Fantasy Points per game. Titans have the 7th easiest playoff schedule for RBs by adjusted fantasy points allowed, but a pretty mid ROS schedule in total. FantasyPros has him as RB21 ROS, but I think im a bit higher, which is right in line with his weeks 1-4 production.

Personally, I'm a bit higher on him, RB21 seems to be his floor with Spears, unless they are planning to get him more involved then he was before. Hamstrings tend to linger and reaggravate, so I wouldn't be super surprised if Spears ends up missing more time. I think he can potentially be a solid buy for a RB needy team.",2024-11-07 21:46:27,59,fantasyfootball

I'm building a free tool to help you set your line up based on player props. Looking for feedback!,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gm0ljy/im_building_a_free_tool_to_help_you_set_your_line/,1gm0ljy,HohnJogan,"I've been working on this tool over the last several weekends in my spare time. It started as a way for me to learn webdev (come from an mobile background), but quickly grew into something I thought others would find useful. I'm sure there's many similar or identical tools out there like it but I plan to continually add on to this. Anyways, here are some of the main features (with many more planned):

* **Vegas insights**: See betting odds (updated daily) for all current NFL week games and players. I have average odds from several bookmakers but you can select individual if you'd like.
* **Player performance ratings**: See custom ratings for players based on prop odds, projected yardage, game context (spread, over/under, moneyline), ppr adjustments, position specific metrics, and your own risk factor. This was a bit of a fun one for me, I used historical data to try to come up with a algorithm that could give a somewhat decent estimate. This has performed well for me but mileage may vary, definitely need feedback from others!
* **Weekly rankings**: See weekly rankings of players based on projections. Can be useful in finding interesting prop values.

I'm still actively building and improving it (mobile support ironically isnt great), so any feedback would be super helpful! Whether it's feature suggestions, bug reports, or general thoughts, I appreciate all input.

There are *plenty* of players I *could* include in this piece each week, but these I feel are important to mention with an emphasis on *remaining schedules* in this week’s piece.

As always, feel free to discuss risers and fallers of your own, and whatever else, in the comments!

For Week 10:

**RISERS** include a rookie running back who has a lead back role and league-winning schedule. 

**FALLERS** include a rookie wide receiver who’s seemingly taking a backseat to a veteran.

**THE HOT SEAT** has Christian McCaffrey on it. I’m not going to allude to who it could be. It’s time for the 1.01 pick (in many leagues) to play like it immediately upon his return. LFG!

Which top 10 WR in PPG is most likely to fall out of the 10? Who is most likely to replace them?,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1glz6jn/which_top_10_wr_in_ppg_is_most_likely_to_fall_out/,1glz6jn,YungRobbin,"The RB version I asked had some great discussion, so figured why not gauge where people are at with WR. Using half PPR points per game to keep things simple, here are the current top 10 WRs in fantasy points per game.

1. Nico Collins **(18.1)**
2. Justin Jefferson **(16.7)**
3. Ja'Marr Chase **(15.8)**
4. CeeDee Lamb **(15.2)**
5. Cooper Kupp **(15.1)**
6. A.J Brown **(14.8)**
7. Malik Nabers **(14.5)**
8. Garrett Wilson **(14.1)**
9. Amon-Ra St. Brown **(13.8)**
10. Tee Higgins **(15.6)**

\--------------------------------  
NEXT FIVE

* Drake London **(12.9)**
* Jayden Reed **(12.8)**
* Terry McLaurin **(12.8)**
* DeVonta Smith **(12.7)**
* DK Metkalf **(12.6)**

Sneakily I think Amon-Ra is the most likely to fall out of the top 10, not just because he's already at 9 but because his hot run on TDs and has been masking that his volume and YAC are both down. I think he's going to have a few weeks coming up that look more like 5 catches for 45 yards and without a TD that's a tough week for your WR1.

I think the most likely to replace him going forward will be Tyreek and Puka, who have their QB and O-lines getting healthy and are healthy themselves. I think we start to see a shift more towards their usage last year and they become focal points of their offenses.",2024-11-07 19:44:16,107,fantasyfootball

Apply that to Evan Engram and any other players who might be affected by emerging circumstances.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

---------------------

**PLEASE TRY TO ANSWER SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS BEFORE POSTING YOUR OWN**

* When answering questions, please make sure to **sort by NEW!**

----------------

**WHEN ANSWERING QUESTIONS**

* Do **NOT** reply with only a yes or no. This just removes the other person from the index without them getting information. You are not helping.
* Explain why you came to the conclusion you did

Kareem Hunt Fantasy Playoffs Outlook,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1glstqt/kareem_hunt_fantasy_playoffs_outlook/,1glstqt,Clashur,"Disclaimer - I am not an expert by any stretch, and I'm hoping for some healthy discussion and insight here.

With Pacheco set to make his return soon, and the Chiefs with a healthy hold on their division, it feels to me that there may be a couple potential upsides to holding on Hunt.

1) the Chiefs decide to stick with the hot hand. This feels unlikely (20-40%) given how dynamic Pacheco is, but it's non-zero in my opinion.

2) the Chiefs continue to roll along with Pacheco at the helm, and they are in a position to rest their starters in the final week or 2 of the season. This could bring a large upside in a deep playoff run.

Do you all agree with these? Do you think he is worth holding onto as Pacheco gears up to make a return this month?",2024-11-07 15:18:33,47,fantasyfootball

I will do it with 0.5ppr scoring rules.

|POS|PLAYER - TEAM|ROSTERED%|OPPONENT
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|QB|Bryce Young - CAR|4%|vs NYG|
|RB|Samaje Perine - KC|5%|vs DEN|
|RB|Cordarrelle Patterson - PIT|1%|at WAS|
|WR|Parker Washington - JAX|4%|vs MIN|
|WR|Mason Tipton - NO|1%|vs ATL|
|TE|Theo Johnson - NYG|1%|at CAR|
|FLEX|Andrei Iosivas - CIN|4%|at BAL|
|D/ST|Arizona Cardinals|4%|vs NYJ|
|K|Chad Ryland - ARI|4%|vs NYJ|

This team is available in between 75.16% and 95% of leagues.

**Bryce Young** has played better recently and plays at home against the Giants this week. The Giants defense has been better than expected but they do give up the 10th most points to opposing QBs. With Legette and Coker emerging, Young could return another decent performance.

I am staying in on **Samaje Perine.** He made the squad the last two weeks and has another chance this week. Perine could be used as a pass catcher again, against a good Broncos defense. Hunt was also limited yesterday, though that was probably a Wednesday rest day as he was also limited last week with the same quadriceps injury.

Pittsburgh is a great defense but they will be tested by the Commanders offense. Pitt may find themselves needing to throw more and Arthur Smith loves him some **CPatt.** Patterson is a full participant after missing the last 4 weeks plus their bye. 

The Jags are banged up at receiver and **Parker Washington** should be in line for more work with BTJ and Gabe Davis limited. Minnesota should be able to handle the Jaguars and are a pass funnel.

Similarly, the Saints are banged up and the Falcons are vulnerable to the passing attack. **Mason Tipton** will be competing with veteran Cedrick Wilson (who I very much considered for this team) and the newly arrived Marquez Valdes-Scantling (who I did not consider for this team). I like Tipton to capitalize on the opportunity as the Saints will ride the bump teams get from firing their head coach.

Rookie tight end **Theo Johnson** made the squad last week and now gets to face the Panthers who bleed points to everyone. I expect him to keep that momentum going as his usage starts to reflect his high snap share.

Tee Higgins is out again. Mike Gesicki has been the major beneficiary of Tee’s absences lately but Gesicki only played 36% of snaps. I expect that number to increase but I also expect **Andrei Iosivas** to flash like he did in weeks 2 and 3 in what could be a high scoring affair.

The Jets are finding their offense at the same time the **Cardinals** are starting to play some good complimentary football. I like the Cardinals at home to beat the Jets. Along with that, **Chad Ryland** should get several kicking opportunities in this one, hopefully they close the roof if it hails this week…

Who is your desperation start this week?

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

"Speaking purely from opportunity and efficiency, what exactly is the difference between Pollard and Walker, Hall, Jacobs, Jones, or Swift?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1glfssu/speaking_purely_from_opportunity_and_efficiency/,1glfssu,Flrg808,"Confusing to me why every week Pollard is ranked as a low end RB2 despite elite usage and being top 10 in pretty much every metric (besides the all mighty TDs). Right now pollard is RB20 in half PPR despite having a bye week, if you give him an extra week of his 13.2 yearly average and just one extra TD he is suddenly a mid range RB1.

Despite all of this, ROS and weekly rankings constantly have him much lower and projections easily have him a tier lower (closer to players like Javonte, rachaad white, healthy Zach moss) compared to the names I mentioned despite them not really showing to be in a higher tier production-wise. Yahoo has him projected for 9.8 pts next week ffs lol.

I know some will point to the return of Spears as a concern but I think after 10 weeks it’s clear the coaches may want to split the backfield but there is just no chance of that actually happening. Pollard has been by far the best player on the Titans team all year and teams tend to focus on getting their money’s worth of these off season RB acquisitions while they can.",2024-11-07 02:11:05,46,fantasyfootball

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Week 10-17 Player Specific Strength of Schedules,149,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1glct0i/week_1017_player_specific_strength_of_schedules/,1glct0i,FantasyGoldenBoy,"Last week I posted the first version of my player specific dynamic strength of schedules and did not do a great job of explaining what they are. So here is another attempt at explaining it and charts for the rest of the season.

**Player Specific Strength of Schedule**

Every player scores fantasy points in different ways, every defense gives up points in different areas.  Each position is broken down into parts and those parts are matched against how a defense defends against each.  This means two WRs on the same team may have different ratings, that will be because they play in Wide/Slot at different rates or a larger/smaller % of their points come from YAC and when matched against how a defense defends against each of those, they will end up with different matchup ratings.  Here is a chart breaking down each position.  All defensive values are adjusted to opponents faced.

|Running Back|% Fantasy Points from rushing vs Adj. Rushing Fantasy Points allowed|% Fantasy Points from Receiving vs Adj. RB Receiving Fantasy Points Allowed|% Total Fantasy Points from Explosive Plays vs. Adj. Explosive runs allowed|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Wide Receiver|% Routes from Wide vs Adj. Fantasy Points Allowed to Wide|% Routes from Slot vs Adj. Fantasy Poiints Allowed to Slot|% Total Fantasy Points from YAC vs Adj. YAC/Rec allowed|
|Tight End|% Routes from Slot vs Adj. Fantasy Poiints Allowed to Slot|% Routes from Inline vs Adj. Fantasy Poiints Allowed to Inline|% Total Fantasy Points from YAC vs Adj. YAC/Rec allowed|
|Quarterback|% Fantasy Points from Passing vs Adj. Passing Fantasy Points Allowed|% Fantasy Points from Rushing vs Adj. QB Rushing Fantasy Points Allowed||
|Defense|% Fantasy Points from Turnovers vs Adj. Turnovers by offense|% Fantasy Points from Sacks vs Adj. Sacks allowed by offense|% Fantasy Points from Yardage/Points vs Adj. Fantasy Points from Yardage/Points allowed by offense|

All charts are sorted by average Rest of Season ratings, the column labeled ""1-9"" is the average rating of the matchups faced so far this season and the final two columns are Regular Season and Playoff matchup averages.  These can all also be seen at [my website](http://www.fantasygoldenboy.com) where it may be easier to see than these images and, if something were to change, they would be updated.  Thanks for reading and let me know if you have any questions.

Which RBs are you still stashing?,191,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1glchc3/which_rbs_are_you_still_stashing/,1glchc3,reigningnovice,"Saw a thread about a month ago and stashing RBs and would like to get a better lay of the land on people's opinions.

I've been seeing a lot of chatter about Corum and how Kyren might not hold up all the way and the Rams want to give some workload to not exhaust Kyren.

Other RBs that are a standard ""injury away from starter"" are Kimani Vidal, Allgier, Charbs, Braelon Allen, Ray Davis, etc.

Russ comes in and he has 22.1 and then the next game has ""only"" 11.4 but 2 NEAR TDs didn't get to count for him

So new QB comes in, he gets much higher quality targets on a better offense, clearly a RZ threat, clearly super talented..

And on top of all that, he's either playing really terrible defense for WR FPts (CLE twice, BAL twice) or he's got the Bengals, Eagles and Commanders all games that should be superbly competitive and its not like those defenses are elite either....

Just think he's primed to dominate the LA stretch here, Go GP!",2024-11-06 23:16:15,80,fantasyfootball

Saints WR situation,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1glbmt9/saints_wr_situation/,1glbmt9,henny_on_da_rocks,"Saints WR situation is pretty grim, looks like their WR1, 2 & 3 are out for at least the short/medium-term

\- Cedrick Wilson Jr. (Q)

With Olave out for the immediate future and Shaheed on IR, I was wondering if anyone has any idea who (if any) of the Saints WR's is the new number 1 option? There has to be at least 1 rosterable WR on this team right?

If not, does anyone know whether Johnson or Taysom benefit more from the lack of receiving options?

Not all sites include the same players, some specifically list players at 0. Any player unrated by a particular site has been left empty. STD values for FP/RSJ will be 10% lower than PPR value. RSJ 2QB values are 2x 1QB value.

There is a weighted-(W) average to offset CBS and I also left the raw-(R) average for comparison. Overall it brings the averages down a little bit.

This does not include PeakedinHighSkool or FantasyCalc values as these guys are doing much more behind the scenes with a lot more data than just the five sites included here. This sheet is mainly to avoid having to look at a bunch of separate pages for other trade values. It also helps see if a certain site is higher/lower on particular players.

I first looked at moving Chase Brown and Hock for Tyreek and Pickens and it gave scores of 82 and 78 respectively. 
When you add Pacheco to the deal from the second team it now becomes 77 to 82 in favor of the team trading away Tyreek, Pickens, and Pacheco.

Messed around after and kept the same deal of Chase Brown and Hock for Henry. The outcome was 85 to 73 in my favor (Obviously) but when Pacheco was added it swapped to 79 to 81 in his favor.

I somehow deleted the text I had in here so I'll rewrite it hopefully the same. The Table above shows the Top 50 players in Rushing or Receiving first down plays.

* Number of Rushing and Receiving First downs broken down by week. ""Total FD"" is the sum of all of the FDs achieved by that player this season.
* The Total number of Receptions and Rushes this season by the player. This is summed up in the column ""Total Touches""
* The % of touches that result in a FD. Quite simply this is **Total FD** / **Total Touches**.
* Touchdown plays are counted as First down plays as well.
* RIP Godwin and Diggs

I would love feedback and if you think this is viable information to know.

Thanks!

\* I had a filter in there I forgot about. Should now show all players correctly. Thank you u/dhs98 for pointing it out for me!",2024-11-06 20:23:15,23,fantasyfootball

Cincinnati Bengals vs Baltimore Ravens - Not So Brief Armchair Analysis (Bold Player Names and Even Longer!) ,169,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gl41zi/cincinnati_bengals_vs_baltimore_ravens_not_so/,1gl41zi,1standFantasyPodcast,"Cincinnati Bengals (+6.5 - 23 Implied Point Total) vs Baltimore Ravens (-6.5 - 29.5 Implied Point Total)
52.5 point total over/under 

Joe Burrow
QB #5 on the year - 20.16 fantasy points per game
268.5 passing yards over/under (-114)/1.5 Passing TDs over/under (-146)/8.5 rushing yards over/under (-114)

Joe Burrow has quietly been having the best season of his career so far this year. Halfway through the season, he is on pace for 4400 yards with 40TDs and 8INTs along with 234 rushing yards with 2TDs. Not nearly as good as his 35TD season in terms of yards per game, however, he is coming off an injury plagued 2023 along with turmoil regarding his top 2 WRs. 

With all of that said, Burrow is averaging 249.33 yards (273 yards at home vs. 219.75 yards on the road) on 33.55 attempts and 23.55 completions with 2.22TDs and .44INTs per game while completing 70% of his passes. Remember Week 1 where he threw for 164 yards and 0TDs? Well that has been a thing of the past (outside of Week 6) as he has thrown for 1+ TD in every game since. The downside (or upside depending on how you look at it) is the connection between him and Chase has been inconsistent all year (see more below), as well as the injury problems of Tee Higgins. That absolutely restricts Burrow’s production and shows the potential of what he could be next year when the Bengals let Higgins walk and potentially draft a highly touted WR (Burden maybe?).

Right now, Burrow is the QB #5 on the year averaging 20.16 fantasy points per game. Not bad for where you took him in drafts especially compared to other highly drafted QBs (Maholmes?). Compare that to his 2022 season where he averaged 21.70 fantasy points per game or his 2021 season where he averaged 20.52 fantasy points per game. He very well may have his highest QB finish fantasy-wise this season. 

Vegas has set his passing line at 268.5 passing yards (19.17 yards higher than his season average) along with a 1.5 passing TD line (-146 over) and an 8.5 rushing yard line (-114 over). It appears that Vegas believes this game will be a shootout and for good reason. Remember Week 5 when Burrow threw for 392 yards and 5TDs against…..the Ravens? Well Vegas sure does. History is also on their side as Burrow has a 3-5 all time record against the Ravens in his career. However, he has always produced when playing them, averaging 283.9 passing yards on 36 attempts and 24.5 completions with 2.1TDs and .6INTs per game. The Bengals are 5-4 against the spread this season, hitting the over in 6 of their 9 games (Week 5 the over/under was 48.5 and they scored a total of 79 points). The Ravens are giving up the most passing yards per game in the NFL (280.9 yards) and are ranked 22nd in scoring defense allowing 24.3 points per game. 


Projection: 27/39 290 yards 3TDs 1INT


Chase Brown
RB #19 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 11.8 fantasy points per game
-130 Anytime TD Scorer Odds (2nd highest in the game) 
57.5 rushing yards over/under (-114)

Chase Brown truthers get in here! I called it in one of my previous posts but by mid-season Chase Brown will be the RB1 of the Bengals. Obviously, Zack Moss got hurt but regardless of how it happened it still happened. 

Honestly, I’m shocked it didn’t happen sooner. We all watched the games showing Moss being slow, indecisive and lacking the vision to hit the holes when they opened up. Brown on the other hand looked like he had the “juice” and the Bengals obviously recognized that. This season, Brown is averaging 53.22 rushing yards (54.2 yards at home vs. 52 yards on the road) on 11.67 attempts with .44TDs per game along with 10.88 receiving yards (13.2 yards at home vs. 8 yards on the road) on 2.88 targets and 2.33 receptions with .22TDs per game as well. Those stats put him solidly at the RB #19 on the year in Half PPR Scoring where he averages 11.8 fantasy points per game. 

Now, let’s take a deeper look into the trends. Since Week 6, Brown has averaged 62.5% of the snaps and 19 opportunities per game averaging 62.25 rushing yards, 14.75 receiving yards and .75TDs per game (.5 rushing TDs and .25 receiving TDs). He has averaged 13.58 fantasy points per game over that 4 week span which would put him as the RB #12 on the year. 

Vegas has set his line for 57.5 rushing yards (4.28 yards more than his season average) and have given him -130 odds to score an anytime TD (2nd highest in the game). The Ravens have a porous defense this season, ranking 21st overall in total defense (yards allowed + TDs allowed). However, they rank 1st in rushing yards allowed per game averaging just 75.7 yards on the ground to opposing teams. Vegas believes the volume will win out for Brown and I would have to agree as well with Moss landing on the IR. 

Projection: 17 attempts 55 yards 1TD/5 targets 3 receptions 37 yards 

Ja’Marr Chase
WR # 1 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 15.81 fantasy points per game 
78.5 receiving yards over/under (-113)/6.5 total receptions over/under (-148)/-125 Anytime TD Scorer Odds (3rd highest in the game) 

Ja’Marr has not been consistent this year but is still having a great season. It just goes to show the potential that Chase has to be the overall WR1 when things click in their offense. 

So far this season, Chase is averaging 79.67 receiving yards (94 yards at home vs. 61.75 yards on the road) on 7.77 targets and 6.11 receptions with .77TDs per game. This puts him at the WR #1 on the season in Half PPR Scoring where he averages 15.81 fantasy points per game (Justin Jefferson has averaged 16.69 fantasy points per game on 8 games played putting him as the WR #1 in scoring average but not overall points). All of that just to mention that Chase only has eclipsed the 100 yard receiving mark 2 times this season (he did it 5 times his rookie season, 4 times his injury shortened 2nd season and 5 times last season - mainly without Joe Burrow). 

Vegas set his receiving line at 78.5 yards (1.17 yards less than his season average) on 6.5 receptions (.39 receptions more than his season average) and gave him -125 odds to score an anytime TD (3rd highest in the game). Over his career, he has averaged 99.7 receiving yards on 10.3 targets and 6.7 receptions with .7TDs against the Ravens. With Tee Higgins most likely missing this game, he is in line for a monster performance against a poor pass defense that allows 22.56 targets and 14.44 receptions with 187.56 receiving yards and 1.44TDs per game this season against opposing WRs. 

Projection: 14 targets 8 receptions 140 yards 1TD


Tee Higgins
WR #45 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 13.32 fantasy points per game (5 games played)
-125 Anytime TD Scorer Odds (3rd highest in the game)

Not really a lot to say. When he is on the field Higgins is great. Some would argue he is more consistent than Ja’Marr Chase when they are both on the field. The problem is that he very rarely on the field. It is hard to gauge a player and whether or not they are “injury prone”, however, Higgins definitely seems like he falls within that category if it exists. 

He has only played 5 games this season where he has averaged 68.2 receiving yards (61 yards at home vs. 73 yards on the road) on 9 targets and 5.8 receptions with .6TDs per game. That puts him at the WR #45 on the season in Half PPR Scoring where he averages 13.32 fantasy points per game. 

Higgins is 3-5 against the Ravens in his career (2-2 at home vs. 1-3 on the road) and averages 62.1 receiving yards on 8.8 targets and 5.1 receptions with .8TDS per game. 

Vegas has given him -125 odds to score an anytime TD (3rd highest in the game), however, they have not set lines for receiving or receptions leading me to believe they assume he will miss this week (which is the direction he is trending). 

Projection: DNP

Andreis Iosivas
WR #68 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 5.71 fantasy points per game 
21.5 receiving yards over/under (-113)/2.5 total receptions over/under (+102)/+270 Anytime TD Scorer Odds (9th highest in the game) 

Iosivas is an interesting player. It seems like the Bengals have a lot of faith in him, especially in the red zone, but it seems like that is where the trust ends. He does not see a lot of targets between the 20s even though he is on the field a lot (80.5% snap share). It’s perplexing since the Bengals were so high on him this off-season and gave him 100% of the snaps in Week 1 when Higgins was mysteriously ruled out. In Week 3 he had the highest number of targets on the season at 7 and still did not eclipse the 60 yard mark. 

Overall, Iosivas is averaging 22.11 receiving yards (25.4 yards at home vs. 18 yards on the road) on 3.44 targets and 1.66 receptions with .44TDs per game. That puts him at the WR #68 on the year in Half PPR Scoring where he averages 5.71 fantasy points per game. The ironic thing is, out of his 15 total receptions on the season 4 of them have gone for TDs. He has the same red zone catch percentage as Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins but has been targeted considerably less than both of them. Just goes to show you that they trust him in the short area of the field but he might not have the speed or separation to get consistent targets elsewhere (the stats don’t back it up though as he is 30th out of 144 qualifying WRs in separation score this season so even more confusing). 

Vegas has set his receiving line at 21.5 yards (.61 yards less than his season average) on 2.5 receptions (.84 more than his season average) and has given him +270 odds to score an anytime TD (9th highest in the game). With Higgins trending to be out I would imagine that Iosivas and Gesicki will be the main benefactors in this game with Irwin and other ancillary pieces getting a small bump up as well. In his career, Iosivas is 0-2 against the Ravens averaging 39 receiving yards on 1 target and .5 receptions with 0TDs per game. 

Projection: 5 targets 3 receptions 43 yards 1TD

Mike Gesicki
TE #11 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 6.7 fantasy points per game 
48.5 receiving yards over/under (-113)/4.5 total receptions over/under (+106)/+240 Anytime TD Scorer Odds (8th highest in the game) 

Gesicki is now in a prime position for this week and the rest of the season as well. With Eric All going on the season ending IR and Higgins missing this week, Gesicki should see a high number of opportunities against the Ravens who are better against opposing TEs but still give up 7.67 targets and 5.78 receptions with 67.56 receiving yards with .11TDs per game on the year. 

So far, Gesicki is averaging 39.22 receiving yards (53.8 yards at home vs. 28 yards on the road) on 4 targets and 3.33 receptions with .22TDs per game. It has definitely been an inconsistent season so far for him as he has ranged from the TE52 to the TE1 this past week. Hopefully, moving forward you will see a more consistent role in the offense with a handful of more targets per game. Even with his inconsistency, Gesicki is the TE #11 on the year in Half PPR Scoring where he averages 6.7 fantasy points per game. This is more of an indictment on the TE landscape than it is on Gesicki. 

Vegas has set his receiving line at 48.5 yards (9.28 yards more than his season average) on 4.5 receptions (1.17 receptions more than his season average) and have given him +240 odds to score an anytime TD (8th highest in the game). I’m a little bit surprised that he is so low on the TD scorer odds with the high implied point total for the Bengals and the lack of options due to injuries. 

Gesicki has a 2-2 record all time against the Ravens in his career (1-2 at home vs. 1-0 on the road) where he averages 25.8 receiving yards on 4.8 targets and 2.0 receptions with .3TDs per game. Those games came when he was on the Miami Dolphins and had a completely different offensive scheme and usage though so it is hard to take away anything from his historical statistics. 

Projection: 8 targets 6 receptions 54 yards 1TD

21st in total defense (yards allowed/TDs)/32nd in passing yards allowed (280.9)/1st in rushing yards allowed (75.7)/22nd in scoring defense (24.3 pts per game)/12th in Red Zone Defense - 53.3%)/29th in 3rd down defense (46.2%)

____________________________________________________________________________

Lamar Jackson
QB #1 on the year - 25.30 fantasy points per game
237.5 passing yards over/under (-114)/1.5 Passing TDs over/under (-130)
+165 Anytime TD Scorer Odds (6th highest in the game) 
51.5 rushing yards over/under (-114)

Lamar has been playing out of his mind this season. I remember going into last season everyone was talking about the Todd Monken offense and the changes that were going to be made. Obviously, last season did not work out the way that they had hoped but it showed us glimpses of what was to come. With a second year in the same system, the Ravens are looking unstoppable on the offensive side of the ball. 

Lamar is averaging 264.33 passing yards (251.5 yards at home vs. 274.6 yards on the road) on 28.33 attempts and 19.33 completions with 2.22TDs and .22INTs per game while completing 68% of his passes (highest completion percentage of his career). If that isn’t enough, he is also averaging 56.11 rushing yards (34.75 yards at home vs. 72.4 yards on the road) on 9.33 attempts with .22TDs per game as well. In Lamar’s first MVP season (2019) he ended the year with 3127 passing yards with 36TDs along with 1206 rushing yards and 7TDs. At the pace he has now, he will end the year with 4,758 passing yards and 40TDs along with 1,010 rushing yards and 4TDs. That is absolutely ridiculous when you think about it as he should have his third MVP on lock as long as he is able to finish the season. 

Obviously, Jackson is the QB #1 on the season averaging 25.30 fantasy points per game (Baker is 2nd averaging 23.5 fantasy points per game). He is also doing this when his #1 target going into this season has had a very inconsistent, bordering on poor first 9 weeks. Maybe this is just all good timing with Rashod Bateman finally being healthy and Zay Flowers looking like a legit WR1. The addition of Derrick Henry doesn’t hurt either as now there is a consistent threat in the backfield alongside Lamar that defenses have to account for (remember Week 1 when they ran the option a bunch leading to Lamar having 120+ rushing yards?). 

Vegas has set his passing line at 237.5 yards (26.83 yards less than his season average) along with 1.5 passing TDs over/under (-130). He has a 51.5 yard rushing line (4.61 yards less than his season average) and has been given +165 odds to score an anytime TD (6th highest in the game). This might be based more on historical averages as he is 9-2 all time (5-1 at home vs. 4-1 on the road) against the Bengals in his career and has only averaged 198.4 passing yards on 26.2 attempts and 16.2 completions with 1.6TDs and .4INTs. With the Bengals ranking 19th in overall defense (yards allowed + TDs allowed) and in the bottom half for rushing yards allowed per game(18th), passing yards allowed per game (17th), scoring defense (25th), red zone defense (27th) and third down defense (26th); it should be a high scoring affair where Jackson will continue his MVP case.

Projection: 24/33 245 yards 2TDs/11 attempts 100 yards 1TD

Derrick Henry
RB #1 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 21.89 fantasy points per game
-290 Anytime TD Scorer Odds (highest in the game) 
90.5 rushing yards over/under (-114)

I bet the Titans are kicking themselves now for letting Henry walk. Even if it is just to put him behind center instead of running out the gross combination of Will Levis and Mason Rudolph. I guess the NFL should take notice regarding the “RB Age Cliff” as it seems like that might be a thing of the past. Henry has looked phenomenal and honestly, what else were we expecting? 

This season, Henry is averaging 116.88! Rushing yards (130.25 yards at home vs. 106.2 yards on the road) on 18.67 attempts with 1TD per game. Without question, he is the RB #1 on the year in Half PPR Scoring averaging 21.89 fantasy points per game (Kamara is #2 averaging 18.63 fantasy points per game). He has almost as many rushing yards this season (1,052) as he did all of last season through 17 games (1,167). If he continues this pace, he will end the year with right around 2,000 rushing yards and 20+ TDs. Crazy to consider that the Ravens have two of the top 5 players in the MVP race halfway through the season. 

Henry has a rushing line of 90.5 yards (26.38 yards less than his season average) by Vegas who has also given him -290! Odds to score an anytime TD (highest in the game by far). This might be based on historical data as Henry is 3-2 against the Bengals in his career (2-1 at home vs. 1-1 on the road) where he averages 83.2 rushing yards on 16.6 attempts and .6TDs per game. Also, it is worth noting that this season when Lamar has exceeded 38 passing attempts, Henry has had his worst finishes of the year (RB30, RB7 and RB18). Now he is matched up against the 18th ranked rushing defense and the 27th ranked red zone defense. I believe this game the Ravens will try to get Henry involved early and often leading him to another 100 yard rushing game. 

Projection: 19 attempts 110 yards 1TD

Zay Flowers
WR #10 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 12.34 fantasy points per game
+135 Anytime TD Scorer Odds (5th highest overall) 
58.5 receiving yards over/under (-114)/4.5 total receptions over/under (-146)

It’s official, Zay Flowers has broken out. We saw flashes last season but with the Monken offense not clicking, it was hard to see what was to come. Now with everything firing on all cylinders, Flowers looks to be a lock for a WR1 finish this season. They are using him differently than in the past as he is averaging 14.2 yards per reception compared to 11.1 yards per reception from last season. He has also been more efficient in the Red Zone this year (5 targets so far with 2TDs) compared to last season (15 targets and 3TDs). 

This season, Flowers is averaging 72.67 receiving yards (90 yards at home vs. 58.8 yards on the road) on 7.44 targets and 5.11 receptions with .33TDs per game (last year he averaged 52.44 receiving yards on 6.88 targets and 5 receptions with .11TDs per game through the first 9 games). He has definitely become a more complete player and the Ravens are using him more at the detriment of Mark Andrews. Right now, Flowers is the WR #10 on the year in Half PPR Scoring where he averages 12.34 fantasy points per game. Flowers has been open on 55.9% of his targets this season (3 or more yards of separation) according to Next Gen Stats. I’ll admit, I was on the fence regarding Flowers in the beginning but he has definitely proven he belongs in the conversation when it comes to top 12 WRs in the league. 

Vegas has set Flowers’ receiving line at 58.5 yards (14.17 yards less than his season average) on 4.5 total receptions (.61 receptions less than his season average) and have given him +135 odds to score an anytime TD (5th highest in the game). I think these lines might come at a surprise to some people, however, the Bengals are in the top 10 when it comes to fantasy points given up to the WR position this season. The Bengals only give up 12.11 completions on 19.67 targets for 143.33 total receiving yards and .67TDs per game to opposing WRs. This makes things a little more difficult as well with the addition of Diontae Johnson and his further integration into the offense. 

Flowers is 3-0 against the Bengals in his career and has averaged 72 receiving yards on 7 targets and 4.7 receptions with 0TDs per game. I am expecting a more modest game for Flowers with the various WRs used in this offense and the fact that Henry will take over this game unlike the last time the Bengals and Ravens faced off.

Projection: 8 targets 5 receptions 55 yards 1TD

Rashod Bateman
WR #29 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 8.35 fantasy points per game 
+310 Anytime TD Scorer Odds (11th highest in the game) 
28.5 receiving yards over/under (-114)/2.5 total receptions over/under (+116)

Bateman has been fantastic this season especially compared to where he has been in the past. I am sure I am not the only one who has been scorned by Bateman over the past few years hoping that it’ll finally be his breakout. Lo and behold, 2024 was the year. 

Bateman is currently averaging 49.67 receiving yards (39.75 yards at home vs. 57.6 yards on the road) on 4.33 targets and 2.77 receptions with .33TDs per game. Definitely a big improvement from his previous best seasons’ stats (2021 where he averaged 42.91 receiving yards and only had 1TD in 12 games played). He definitely falls into the “injury prone” category along with Higgins as I mentioned above. It is the perfect storm for him as Lamar’s completion percentage is the highest it has ever been and he is averaging the most passing attempts in his career. The Monken offense has been great to Bateman, however, there is reason to be concerned moving forward. 

As much as Harbaugh says that Johnson will not take Bateman’s role away, I find that particularly hard to believe for two reasons. First, I am not sure that Bateman will stay healthy for the entire season, meaning that Johnson will take over his spot due to injury if he misses time. Secondly, Johnson is a proven elite WR and has been for some time. The Ravens did not do a mid-season trade to acquire a WR just to allow him to return punts and have a limited role in the actual offense. 

Vegas is also uncertain about the roles of Bateman and Johnson moving forward as they set his receiving line at 28.5 yards (21.17 yards less than his season average) on 2.5 total receptions (.27 receptions less than his season average) and have given him +310 odds to score any anytime TD (11th highest in the game). To me, this is showing they are hedging their bets as one of the two aforementioned WRs will exceed 30 yards and 2.5 receptions but no one is sure which one (I’m leaning Johnson). Again, with the Bengals allowing very few points per game to the WR position, it might be a tough game in terms of fantasy production for the three WRs. 

Projection: 5 targets 3 receptions 49 yards 


Diontae Johnson
WR #41 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 8.67 fantasy points per game (1 played with Ravens - Scored 0pts and had 4% of snaps) - 9.9 fantasy points not including Week 9
+270 Anytime TD Scorer Odds (9th highest in the game) 
21.5 receiving yards over/under (-114)/2.5 total receptions over/under (+130)

Last week was a blip when it comes to Diontae Johnson and his performance. He was just traded to the Ravens and played 4% of snaps, had 0 targets and scored 0 fantasy points. I would imagine all of that is going to change on Thursday night. 

This season, Johnson is averaging 44.63 receiving yards (44 yards at home vs. 45.25 yards on the road) on 7.25 targets and 3.75 receptions with .38TDs per game. All of those stats were with the struggling Carolina Panthers and two different starting QBs along with his poor Week 9 performance. If you exclude the last game with the Ravens, he is actually averaging 51 yards per game on 8.29 targets and 4.28 receptions with .43TDs per game. Again, it is hard to gauge where he will fit into this offense and whether or not Harbaugh was telling the truth about his utilization. 

The historical data I can use as an example is that Johnson is 6-4 against the Bengals all time in his career (3-2 at home vs. 3-2 on the road) where he averages 60 receiving yards on 9.3 targets and 5.6 receptions with .4TDs per game. Vegas is again in the dark as they have set his receiving line to 21.5 yards (23.13 yards less than his season average) on 2.5 total receptions (1.25 receptions less than his season average) and have given him +270 odds to score an anytime TD (9th highest in the game). Even the fact that they have given Johnson higher TD odds than Bateman should be somewhat telling. 

It should be interesting to see what his involvement is like this week as well as what it does to the other WRs and their opportunities. I can see a world where Johnson receives the 2nd highest target share this week as he should prove that he is a better WR talent-wise than Bateman. 

Projection: 7 targets 5 receptions 55 yards 


Mark Andrews
TE #9 on the year in Half PPR Scoring! - 7.21 fantasy points per game 
+210 Anytime TD Scorer Odds (7th highest in the game) 

It has been a weird year for Mark Andrews. He was injured coming into this offseason. Then he had a mysterious car accident where there was little to no information for the Fantasy Football community. Then Week 1 he only received 2 targets and ran less routes than Isiah Likely as the Ravens were still holding strong that nothing was wrong with Andrews healthwise. Well obviously I think that was a lie since as the season has progressed he has improved week to week. 

Right now, Andrews is averaging 32.11 receiving yards (35.75 yards at home vs. 29.2 yards on the road) on 3.22 targets and 2.67 receptions with .44TDs per game. That is a far cry from his previous seasons when he has been the go to target for Lamar everywhere on the field and especially in the red zone.  Even with his 2 target game in week 1 and back to back goose eggs in weeks 3 & 4, he is still the TE #9 on the year in Half PPR Scoring where he averages 7.21 fantasy points per game. That is extremely crazy to think about as he was the TE29, TE11 and unranked in weeks 3 and 4 of this season. Just another indictment on how the TE position is not utilized by teams which could be a product of the NFL’s offensive schemes or the lack of high end talent at the TE position (looking at you Brock Bowers). 

When we look at Andrews' production over his previous seasons, there is an alarming trend. Since 2019, he has averaged around 56 receiving yards per game and capped at 80 yards per game in 2021. Since that season, he has progressive decreased in his receiving yards per game and has not had over 6 TDs either (2019 he had 10TDs, 2020 he had 7 and 2021 he had 9). Let’s take a look at that same time period for Red Zone targets where he received 21 in 2021, 18 in 2022, 14 in 2023 and only has 7 this season (and is out targeted by Likely in the Red Zone 10 to 7). That is a concerning decrease in opportunity and targets over the past few years, especially for a TE that is not considered “old” for the position. Maybe the car accident affected him more physically than the team wanted to let on? 

Andrews is 9-3 against the Bengals in his career (5-1 at home vs. 4-2 on the road) where he averages 54.7 receiving yards on 6.6 targets and 4.7 receptions with .6TDs per game. After his back to back goose eggs, he has averaged 44.8 receiving yards a game along with 4 targets and 3.6 receptions and has had 4 total TDs in that 5 game span. 

Vegas has set his line at 42.5 receiving yards (10.39 yards more than his season average) on 3.5 total receptions (.83 receptions more than his season average) and have given him +210 odds to score an anytime TD (7th highest in the game). The Bengals are 26th when it comes to fantasy points allowed to the TE position this season where they average 58.44 yards on 7.33 targets and 5.67 completions with .56TDs per game. Coupled with the Bengals awful Red Zone defense and the likelihood that Henry will face stacked boxes leading to open areas in the middle of the field, Andrews should be in line for another top 10 TE finish this week (unless Likely takes his TDs). 

Projection: 6 targets 4 receptions 41 yards 1TD

FINAL SCORE: Cincinnati Bengals 27 - Baltimore Ravens 31 

Cincinnati Bengals 19th in overall yards (17th in pass yards allowed/18th in rushing yards allowed/25th in scoring defense giving up 25.2 pts per game/27th in Red Zone Defense - 67.9%/26th in 3rd down defense - 44.5%)",2024-11-06 17:34:14,199,fantasyfootball

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

**PLEASE TRY TO ANSWER SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS BEFORE POSTING YOUR OWN**

#Background

For years, I’ve searched for a tool with the combination of data I wanted to help me make tough start-or-sit decisions. For instance:

* Do I need a safe, floor play or a risky, high-upside play?
* How consistently has this player performed in the last few weeks?
* How involved is this player on a play-by-play basis?
* How have similar players performed against this opponent?
* How is this player’s team expected to perform?

When knowing these variables, I find that my confidence in making a decision is significantly higher than blindly relying on site projections or a rankings-based sit-or-start tool.

#Overview
When comparing players with the Head-to-Head Player Comparison Tool, the following sections are available to explore:

* [**High-level Details**](https://fantasyondraft.com/assets/images/screenshots/head-to-head_2024-10-16/Details-Odds-Props-Projections.PNG) - displays player information and high-level comparison labels (for quick decisions)
* **Matchup Odds** - displays the opponent, over/under, spread, and implied team total. Odds are from DraftKings via [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/).
* **Player Props** - displays passing, rushing, receiving, and other props (subscription required).  Props can be selected from DraftKings, Fanduel, Underdog Fantasy, and PricePicks via [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/).
* **Projections** - displays raw projections (from [SportsData.io](https://sportsdata.io/)), matchup bonuses/penalties, matchup adjusted projections.
* [**Performance Trends**](https://fantasyondraft.com/assets/images/screenshots/head-to-head_2024-10-16/Performances-Opportunities.PNG) - contains graphical views of performance trends:
 * Overall view of weekly points scored
 * Low-variance view of weekly points scored, excluding high-variance stats like touchdowns and turnovers
 * View of weekly projections vs performances
 * Points breakdown that shows how points were scored.
* **Opportunities** - contains graphical views of opportunity trends:
 * Weekly snap counts
 * Weekly snap percentages
 * Passing Attempts
 * Rushing Attempts
 * Targets
 * Snaps breakdown that shows snap outcomes.
* [**Similar Performances**](https://fantasyondraft.com/assets/images/screenshots/head-to-head_2024-10-16/SimilarPerformances.PNG) - a list of “similar” players who have performances against the opponent of the player you are comparing. Each past performance displays projected fantasy points against actual fantasy points, with a difference that is highlighted to easily show underperformances and overperformances.


The combination of these sections should help you outline and weigh the risks associated with each player you are comparing. Ideally, one player will stand out as the “best” choice, but sometimes, it really can come down to a coin flip. In these cases, at least you have some data to back up the decision to flip a coin.

#Confidence Metrics
The Metrics page has been updated to include data from week 9. [You can check out the full breakdown here.](https://fantasyondraft.com/head-to-head-metrics) Below are some highlights:



* Over 20,000 comparisons since the tool went live for 2024 in week 4, with ~1k-2k unique comparisons a week - so plenty of data to work with. There were 2,292 unique comparisons last week!
* The High-level comparison labels are leading players in the right direction a majority of the time:
 * Consistent: 73%
 * Best on Average: 73%
 * Safe: 70%
 * Risky: 72%
 * Upside: 81%
* When looking for the best possible play, look for these label combinations:
 * Best on Average/Upside/Consistent (73% success rate)
 * Best on Average/Upside/Safe (72% success rate)
 * Best on Average/Upside/Risky (67% success rate)
* When looking for guaranteed points when you are favored to win a matchup, look for these label combinations:
 * Safe/Consistent/Best on Average (92% success rate)
 * Best on Average/Upside/Safe (91% success rate)
 * Safe/Consistent/Upside (88% success rate)
* The ""magical"" label combination **Best of Average/Upside/Safe** has both a very high chance of being the better play (72%) and one of the best ways to guarantee points by outperforming the projected floor (91%)
* Finally, while these are great metrics for utilizing the high-level labels, there are still many more sections of the tool that you can pair with these labels to make a start-or-sit decision you are comfortable with.

Market Adjusted Trade Value Charts - Week 10 – Final Countdown,134,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gkyjhr/market_adjusted_trade_value_charts_week_10_final/,1gkyjhr,PeakedInHighSkool,"The NFL trade deadline was yesterday and the trade deadline is likely coming up soon in your leagues!

I know some platforms default to Week 11 and others go until Week 13. 

Take a moment to double-check your deadline. 

Time to make a move. 

**What makes these charts different?** 

These trade value charts generate a market snapshot by using a weighted formula that mixes aggregated expert rankings (from over three dozen sources), user trade data, and expected points models. 

The goal is to get as many references as possible to get a good picture of the community. 

Forget all that. Let’s skip to the charts!

**TL;DR Here are the Trade Value Charts**

* [0.0 PPR, 4 Point Passing TD, 1 QB](https://x.com/PeakedInHS_FF/status/1854147159060255167)
* [0.5 PPR, 4 Point Passing TD, 1 QB](https://x.com/PeakedInHS_FF/status/1854149726301458611)
* [1.0 PPR, 4 Point Passing TD, 1 QB](https://x.com/PeakedInHS_FF/status/1854153268978458697)

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

4. Taysom Hill (NO QB, TE): $6

See the rest on [www.faabtastic.com](https://www.faabtastic.com)

**Note:** I wasn't able to post Week 7 due to work constraints. I'd like for that to not happen again, so I'm asking for a volunteer to help me input expert bids each week. As I don't currently charge for any part of my website, this volunteer position will be unpaid. However, you will get insight into how I put this together each week and also an early peek into bids before they're published. Please DM me if you're interested, with a quick blurb about your availability each Mon/Tue and why you think you'd be a good fit. Thanks!

**How to Use**

Each week I collect suggested FAAB waiver wire bids from fantasy football experts and publish them to [www.faabtastic.com](https://www.faabtastic.com). The Expert Count column is how many experts mentioned that player. All bids are a based on a starting budget of $100. I then average the bids for each player. The trimmed mean is the average, but without the highest and lowest values.

**Tips & Tricks**

At the bottom of each table, I linked all the articles in the footer row so you can get all the details about why bids are what they are.

You can click any column header to sort it low-to-high (ascending). Click the same header again to sort it high-to-low (descending).

Keep in mind that these are just suggested bids. It's what the experts are suggesting to spend up to, but also maintain enough money for the rest of the season. If you really, really want a player then by all means break the bank if you need to.",2024-11-06 04:06:15,22,fantasyfootball

Week 10 - Survivor Pool Picks - Riding High",18,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gkmi6w/week_10_survivor_pool_picks_riding_high/,1gkmi6w,stvnknwy,"Hey, NFL fans! We’re back with the Week 10 breakdown. Last week was another perfect week, and we’re riding that momentum into this one! It wasn’t without some drama, though, as the Bills narrowly edged out the Dolphins in a nail-biter.

Here’s hoping this week’s insights give you the edge you need for your survivor pools, bets, or simply enjoying the matchups. We’ll dive into some of the most intriguing games, with a focus on key stats like offensive efficiency, defensive resilience, and turnovers.

**I highly recommend checking out the data.** Each matchup is reviewed in the SportWise DataSpace below—you might even find a few other favourites worth considering!

**Home Team Favourites to Watch**

**Los Angeles Chargers** vs. Tennessee Titans

The Chargers enter Week 10 with a slight edge over the Titans, boasting a 5-3 record and averaging 5.3 yards per play on offense. With 159 points scored and only 4 offensive turnovers, their offense has been efficient. The Titans, on the other hand, have struggled this season with a 2-6 record and 20 offensive turnovers, which is a major vulnerability. Expect the Chargers’ playmakers to capitalize on the Titans’ turnover issues and maintain control at home.

**Chicago Bears** vs. New England Patriots

The Bears have shown more stability than the Patriots this season, sporting a 4-4 record compared to New England’s 2-7. Chicago’s offense has been able to put up 172 points with a modest 4.6 yards per play, and their defense has held opponents in check. New England has had a rough season, managing only 141 points while allowing 211 points on defense. The Bears’ balanced approach on both sides of the ball makes them the safer pick in this one.

**Kansas City Chiefs** vs. Denver Broncos

Kansas City is having a stellar season at 8-0, with 203 points scored and an efficient offense averaging 5.2 yards per play. Denver, despite a respectable 5-4 record, has struggled with turnovers which plays into the hands of Mahomes.  Kansas City’s combination of defensive resilience and scoring efficiency gives them a clear edge over Denver, making them a strong survivor pick for Week 10.

**Away Team Favourites to Consider**

I generally avoid road teams, but there are some tempting matchups this week.

**Minnesota Vikings** vs. Jacksonville Jaguars

Minnesota is heading into Jacksonville with a solid 6-2 record and a balanced offense averaging 5.7 yards per play. Jacksonville, at 2-7, has allowed 250 points and has one of the league’s highest points-against totals. With Minnesota’s ability to sustain drives and capitalize on scoring opportunities, they’re likely to take advantage of Jacksonville’s defensive weaknesses and come away with a win.

**Buffalo Bills** vs. Indianapolis Colts

The Bills, with a strong 7-2 record, are favourites in this matchup against the 4-5 Colts. Buffalo has been prolific on offense with 260 points scored and a steady 5.8 yards per play. The Colts’ defense will have a tough time keeping up, given Buffalo’s consistency in scoring and Indianapolis’ occasional turnover issues. Look for Buffalo’s offensive firepower to overwhelm the Colts on the road.

**Detroit Lions** vs. Houston Texans

The Lions head to Houston with a formidable 7-1 record, and they’ve averaged a strong 6.1 yards per play on offense. Detroit’s ability to pile up points (258 so far) gives them a clear edge over Houston, who has been solid but not as dominant at 6-3. Detroit’s explosive playmakers and the Texans’ recent defensive lapses make this a promising pick for the Lions to secure a road win.

What do you think of this week’s picks? Do you agree with the analysis, or do you see potential upsets? Let’s hear your thoughts and predictions for Week 10!

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

"Week 10 Kicker Rankings - Metric Based Projections
",35,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gkknqx/week_10_kicker_rankings_metric_based_projections/,1gkknqx,juicyKW,"\*I UPDATED the kicker for the Vikings to be John Parker Romo based on reports of Reichard heading to IR\*



This is my 5th week of kicker projections, and it's been fun so far (for a stats nerd). I hope you're finding it useful as well and this is a thread you can discuss kickers.

See my Kicker Rest of Season and Power Rankings [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gkknfd/kicker_ros_rankings_and_power_rankings_week_10/)

**HOW IT WORKS**

The projections are done by multiplying the kickers fantasy points per game by a weighted average of stats for the defense the kicker is going against. *You'll find that these projections have a wider range of points than the big sites.*

**WEATHER IS NOT** factored into the projections. Just remember wind over 15 mph, extreme cold, rain, or a combo of wind and rain, can affect kicking totals negatively. ***\*I've added a column to show if the kicker is playing in a dome or not.\****

Metrics used for the opponent defense are:

* Points Allowed Per Game
* Kicker Fantasy Points Allowed Per Game
* Extra Points Attempts Per Game
* Field Goals Attempts Per Game
* Red Zone TD % (LOW=more FG attempts)

***NOTES:***

**Week 10 Byes**: Brandon McManus, GB; Daniel Carlson, LV; Dustin Hopkins, CLE; Jason Myers, SEA

**Younghoe Koo, ATL** \- I found it hard to believe he averaged out to #2 this week. I did a double check of my numbers, as well as checked projections on other sites like ESPN (8th) and FantasyPros (3rd). He scored 20 points last time against the Saints. This could be the last week worth hanging onto him though. I'd have a hard time trusting him due to his recent performance.

**Jake Moody, SF** \- If he doesn't end up playing this week, I'll update the projections.

**Chris Boswell, PIT** \- Washington's defense has been a tougher matchup for kickers. While his appeal is great long term, this might be a 'down' week for him.

**Brandon Aubrey, DAL** \- While Dak is out for the time being, the Cowboys may have trouble scoring. But they could just have trouble scoring touchdowns. If they get into range for Aubrey, he may be their best bet at putting points on the board.

**Vikings** \- John Parker Romo is kicking for them. He's a rookie with a college career of 51/52 XP and 20/27 FG made.

Kicker ROS Rankings and Power Rankings - Week 10 Update - Metric Based,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gkknfd/kicker_ros_rankings_and_power_rankings_week_10/,1gkknfd,juicyKW,"\*I updated the Vikings kicker now that I saw that Reichard will be out\*

Having fun with these, so I'm going to continue them. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me or the community. Hoping this continues to provide a landing spot for anyone wanting to discuss kickers!

Find Week 10 Projections [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gkknqx/week_10_kicker_rankings_metric_based_projections/)

***Notes***

**Siebert, WAS** \- The opportunities for Seibert just keep coming. The Washington offense is here to stay and will continue to give ample opportunity to score. His lowest points in a game so far this season is 9.

**Boswell, PIT** \- While this seems obvious, he should be rostered (only 40% rostered currently). Boswell is now past his bye and may be available in some leagues if the owner decided to drop him last week.

**Moody, SF** \- I'm using Moody for ROS rankings. If he misses this week, I'll only be updating the weekly projections. The 49ers produce top 5 opportunities for their kickers, it's just a matter of capitalizing.

**Aubery, DAL** \- With the injury to Dak Prescott there is uncertainty to how the team will move the ball. Luckily, Aubrey has the best leg in football and is accurate from any range, so he's in range more often than other kickers.

**Fairbairn, HOU** \- With a great seasonal and playoff SOS, his consistency should continue and be an asset to have on your team. Only downside is his bye is Week 14. If you're fighting for a playoff spot you may have a decision to make that week.

**Tucker, BAL** \- Don't look now, but Tucker has been skyrocketing up the board. Ranking 6th in PPG among active kickers, he should continue to produce top 10 numbers ROS. His schedule is on the harder side, but with the way Baltimore is moving the ball, he should still see great opportunities. The Ravens rank 1st in RZ TD%, so that limits his short distance FGs a bit.

# ROS Rankings

I use the same stats I use for weekly projections to create these ranks. I create an adjustment % based on rankings of the remaining defenses the kicker is facing and do a weighted average to project their ROS Rank.

* Kicker Individual Fantasy Points Per Game
* Opposing Defense Points Allowed Per Game
* Opposing Defense Kicker Fantasy Points Against Per Game
* Opposing Defense Extra Points Attempts Per Game
* Opposing Defense Field Goals Attempts Per Game
* Opposing Defense Red Zone TD % (LOW=more FG attempts)

***Notes***

**Byes:** Players with \* have had their bye weeks.

**Week 10 byes:** Brandon McManus, GB; Daniel Carlson, LV; Dustin Hopkins, CLE; Jason Myers, SEA

**Drop:** Younghoe Koo, ATL. His last 3 weekly finishes are 27th, 22nd, and 26th. Outside of two blowup weeks (weeks 4 and 5) he hasn't finished higher than 9th in weekly scoring, with 6/7 of those weeks 14 or lower. He did have a huge week against New Orleans last time with 20 points, so this may be the last week to hang onto him.

**Add:** Jake Moody, SF. Coming off bye/injury, he looks to be available in 53% of leagues. I'd take a look as SF has a top 3 opportunity rank so far this season.

**Keep An Eye On:** Will Reichard, MIN. He's on IR and John Parker Romo has replaced him. He's a rookie with college stats of 51/52 xp  and 20/27 on Field Goals. Tough to project it, but I'd expect a dip in points.

**SOS ranking**: 1=best, 32=worst

# Kicker POWER RANKINGS

These are the stats that go into these rankings. I've added in player specific XP% and FG% this week (typically just used team versions of this). With some kickers being injured and players losing their jobs, I had to find a way to include this. It also balances out the rank a bit more as we don't want a previous kicker's stats to dramatically affect the new kickers ranks.

* Fantasy PPG
* Player 50+ Field Goal Makes
* Player FG%
* Player XP%
* Team FG Attempts
* Team XP Attempts
* Team Kicking Points
* Team Points Per Field Goal Attempt
* Team Points Per Game
* RZ TD% (looking for low % to increase FG attempts)
* RZ Attempts

***Notes:***

**Biggest Riser:** Tyler Bass, BUF (+9)

**Biggest Faller:** Cameron Dicker, LAC (-8)

**Notable Riser:** Justin Tucker, BAL (+5)

I hope Week 9 treated you well! I am here to bring you your weekly dose of data trends related to Fantasy Points Allowed compliments of [FFToday](http://www.fftoday.com).

Because things change so drastically on a week to week basis in the NFL, I wanted to see how the matchups looked using a three week window.

**Here's the results for Week 10:**

|Scoring|Total Points URL|Differential from Average URL|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Standard|[https://i.imgur.com/w7OkQQY.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/w7OkQQY.jpeg)|[https://i.imgur.com/sD5RO7k.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/sD5RO7k.jpeg)|

**How to read the chart:** This data is showing the number of points allowed, so if you’re looking at QBs, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are allowing a lot of PPG in the last 3 weeks (good matchup for Brock Purdy) while the Pittsburgh Steelers are not (bad matchup for Jayden Daniels).

* Blue = good matchup, White = average matchup, Red = bad matchup.
* The team in the Opponent column is who plays the team on the left this week.
* The teams in the Prev 3 Opponents column are the teams that the team on the left has played in the last 3 weeks.
* The team in the Opponent column is who plays the team on the left this week.
* The team in the Next Opponent column is who plays the team on the left next week.
* Teams with a bye in the last 3 weeks will look back a 4th week to capture 3 games worth of data.

Please keep in mind that D/ST Data will likely be different due to varied league settings.

Also, some have asked for the ability to sort by position, so [here's a link to the data in a Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uYjQkCLPh-AufIkJyvd7EYrad_2LWkebyLEHHZIle2k/edit?usp=sharing).

Kenneth walker then has to run back and recover the ball to avoid the fumble recovery by the defense. When this happens, Kenneth Walker is awarded with negative rushing yards even though he was not the ball carrier. What I am asking is if you think the Kenneth should be awarded negative points for a play like this. How would you handle it in your leagues?

For those of you that are new to this thread, every week I will put up a thread for each individual game. Please post some details about **what you actually saw** for those of us that didn't happen to catch the game. A few things to remember:

**Please give good detail.** No one is asking to write a novel (though those can be great too!) but a little more depth than ""Joe Flacco locked in league winner"" is appreciated. This is a great way to help one another in this community to give some insight to games and hopefully some good, actionable fantasy advice.

Also, if possible, **please try to bold player names in longer writeups**. Again, not mandatory, just very helpful. To bold something on reddit, put two asterisks in the front and back of the sentence.

Lastly, **do not reply to this post with game discussion. reply to the actual individual game threads**. Each game will have a thread to discuss the games individually, if you reply to this OP it will just get buried.

If you are writing in your phone, you can bold words using two \* at the begging and at the end of the word.

|FLEX|Theo Johnson - NYG|1%|vs WAS|12.6
|D/ST|Arizona Cardinals|3%|vs CHI|12
|K|Chad Ryland - ARI|2%|vs CHI|11

This team is available in between 88.55% and 96% of leagues and would've scored 119.9 points. The team doesn’t change if you increase the threshold to 10% this week.

I thought Levis would be back this week but it was another week of **Mason Rudolph,** who continues the holiday festivities by staying on top of the unrostered team. Rudolph led the Titans to an OT win over the Patriots.The Titans face the Chargers next week so whoever starts will likely have a rough go.

The Cardinals handled the Bears pretty easily. **Emari Demercado** and Trey Benson both got in on the fun. Both scored and Benson actually out-snapped Demercado (28% to 24%), but Demercado gained more yards and an extra target. I saw many people pick up Benson in case Conner goes down. While that is a good idea, I think Demercado could have value in that case as well. 

**Samaje Perine** joins Rudolph in going back-to-back. He returned a much better performance than his 4 points last week as well. The Chiefs are using Perine as a pass catcher, he only ran once but he caught 4 of 5 targets compared to Hunt’s 1 catch on 1 target. Perine hit paydirt on one of those catches and could retain that role even when Pacheco returns. 

**Nick Westbrook-Ikhine** played 97% of snaps and turned 6 targets into 5 catches for 50 yards and a touchdown. Ikhine has flashed at times but he is now getting more consistent work than he has in his career. With Hopkins catching TDs from Mahomes, NWI has more target opportunities. Again, probably best left on waivers ahead of the Chargers game but his usage is encouraging. 

The Bills are a good offense so anyone can flash any week. **Mack Hollins** has a history of making the unrostered team once and disappearing the rest of the year. Hollins will likely be more viable in any games Cooper misses but I suspect we will see more and more of Cooper and Hollins will remain behind Shakir and Coleman as well. 

A week after National Tight End Day two TEs make the unrostered team. **Josh Oliver** took advantage of Hockenson still ramping up. Oliver played 56% of snaps compared to Hock’s 45%. Hockenson did take a shot and I think that may have changed the plan for his work load but I have not heard any reports confirming that. 

Tight end **Theo Johnson** joins the squad in the flex spot. The Giants rookie has been garnering a lot of playing time all year, never slipping below 71% and averaging 84%. This week he had the most targets he’s seen in a game, that trend could continue against the Panthers next week. 

As stated before, the **Cardinals** handled the Bears easily, winning 29-9. Not only did their RB3 make the unrostered squad, the defense and kicker also join the squad. As an aside, all three outscored the Cards QB. **Chad Ryland** hit a 55 yarder as well as a short field goal and a few extra points on his way to the 4th best kicking performance this week. The Cardinals seem to be finding their groove and could be a solid team down the stretch. They are currently sitting atop the NFC West.

This team was available in between 86.75% and 96% of leagues and would've scored 61.66 points.

u/HotDonkus took the top spot in their first attempt. As soon as I saw the **Emari Demercado** I knew that was a good call. It turned out even better than I expected.  **Westbrook-Ikhine** was another great call. He could be viable going forward. The **Cardinals** defense was the last correct guess. 

Parker Washington is still an interesting name. He saw 6 targets and 85% of snaps. He should be involved the rest of the way with Kirk out. Coker is intriguing as well, unfortunately his snap share dropped to 45%, even more odd considering the Diontae Johnson trade.

u/Kezzup got **Demercado,** , **NWI**, and **Chad Ryland** correct. 

Gardner Minshew let us all down, he was the most guessed QB this week. No one guessed Rudolph.

u/OhKayGetAwayFromMe finds themselves at the bottom again. I guess they join Mason Rudolph and Samaje Perine in going back to back, silver linings you know? The **Cardinals** D was once again a correct guess, they were the most guessed defense this week.

Boutte will likely make this squad again. AJ Barner has a shot too. I think the Metchie hype is officially over, unfortunately. 

Who are you targeting on waivers? Samaje Perine, Theo Johnson, and Westbrook-Ikhine seem like they could be decent pickups. I would love to have you join me in guessing on Thursday.",2024-11-05 18:04:54,5,fantasyfootball

Let me know what you think, and I hope it helps!

**Injury Report**

*New Injuries*

**WR Chris Olave** (concussion) - Olave suffered the fourth concussion of his NFL career and his second this season. I’d expect him to miss Week 10 at a minimum with a potential multi-week absence. Note that the Saints have a Week 12 bye - Olave could be held out until Week 13 or longer.

**QB Dak Prescott** (hamstring) - Likely to be placed on IR, will miss at least four weeks.

**WR Drake London** (hip) - London suffered a hip pointer and an oblique strain. It isn’t believed to be serious and he could suit up as early as Week 10.

**WR AJ Brown** (knee) - No structural issues, more of a contusion - he could play as early as Week 10.

**WR CeeDee Lamb** (shoulder) - Sprained AC joint, not considered serious, could play in Week 10.

**WR Darius Slayton** (concussion) - In concussion protocol, typically miss one game or so.

**WR Keon Coleman** (wrist) - Waiting for news.

**QB Caleb Williams** (lower body) - Will likely be fine for Week 10.

*Existing Injury Updates*

**RB Zack Moss** (neck) - expected to miss rest of regular season.

**WR Nico Collins** (hamstring) - eligible to return this week, no update yet.

**RB Christian McCaffrey** (achilles) - back at practice and trending towards playing this week .

**Waiver Wire Week 10**

**Quarterbacks**

1. **Drake Maye** \- In the three full games Drake Maye has played, he has finished as the QB8, QB7, and QB 11, averaging 21.4 fantasy points per start. That would make him the overall QB6 across weeks 6, 7, and 9. With a season/career-high 95 rushing yards against the Titans in Week 9, Maye provides both a strong floor and enticing upside as a dual-threat quarterback.

**Running Backs**

1. **Ray Davis** \- We know that James Cook isn’t going anywhere. However, it’s that time of year where we want to roster high-upside handcuffs as the fantasy playoffs approach. Davis looked explosive this week, taking a checkdown pass 63 yards to the house, and we know what he is capable of (18.2 fantasy points in Week 6) were James Cook to go down.
2. **Trey Benson** \- Similar to fellow rookie RB Ray Davis’ situation, Benson is unlikely to be startable in fantasy without an injury to James Conner. However, Benson is coming off the highest fantasy output of his young career (12.5 fantasy points), including scoring his first NFL TD from the one-yard line. It doesn’t hurt that the Cardinals have the most favorable fantasy playoff schedule for running backs. Stash him!
3. **Blake Corum** \- Kyren Williams leads all running backs in snap share with an outrageous 88% through 9 weeks. The next highest player at the position is Breece Hall with 76% - a 12% difference. Sean McVay loves to utilize a workhorse RB, and rookie third-round pick Corum is next in line were Kyren to miss time.
4. **Khalil Herbert** \- Herbert was traded to the Bengals this morning, and with Zack Moss expected to miss the remainder of the regular season, Herbert’s upside case is filling in as the 1B in Cincinnati’s backfield. Additionally, he would be the biggest beneficiary if Chase Brown were to miss any time.

**Wide Receivers**

1. **Elijah Moore** \- While his 5.8 point performance in Week 9 was disappointing, Moore still saw 8 targets (19% target share) this week after seeing 11 targets (30%) in Week 8. In the wake of Amari Cooper’s departure, Moore will continue to be valuable as long as Jameis Winston remains at quarterback. Cleveland has the 6th-highest pass rate over expectation in the league since Jameis took over.
2. **DeMario Douglas** \- In three full games played with Drake Maye, Douglas is averaging 7 targets - tied with Hunter Henry for the team lead. Based on how Douglas was utilized in Week 9, he had the 16th-most expected fantasy points among wide receivers. A bet on Douglas is a bet on his ascending rookie quarterback elevating the entire offense, and DeMario doesn’t have much to compete with at the WR position.
3. **Noah Brown** \- In Week 9, Brown led the Commanders in targets with 6 in a game where Jayden Daniels only attempted 22 passes, good for a 27.3% target share. Additionally, Brown posted a 76+% route share for the second straight week, an indication that he has cemented himself as the second option in Washington’s WR corps. While Terry McLaurin will typically see more than his 3 Week 9 targets, Brown offers access to a Washington offense scoring the 4th-most fantasy points per game.

**Tight Ends**

1. **Taysom Hill** \- Simply put, the Saints are low on weapons. Rasheed Shaheed is out for the year. Chris Olave will likely miss time with a concussion. Jamaal Williams is nursing a groin injury. And last but not least, running back Kendre Miller is on IR. In Week 9, Hill finished as the overall TE5, setting season-highs across the board in targets (5), receptions (4), and reception yards (41), with a rushing touchdown to boot. Expect his increased usage both on the ground and through the air to continue, especially while Olave remains out.
2. **Hunter Henry** \- In three full games played with Drake Maye, Henry is averaging 7 targets per game, tied for the team-high with DeMario Douglas. Additionally, based on how he has been utilized in those three games, Henry has the 4th-most expected fantasy points per game among tight ends, according to PFF. On an offense starving for production from their wide receivers, Henry’s strong usage should continue.
3. **Mike Gesicki** \- Gesicki set season-highs in route share (61%), air yards share (38%), and of course, fantasy points (27.0) in Week 9, and has shown the ability to capitalize on additional volume when given the opportunity. An important note, however, is that Tee Higgins’ (quad) absence was the main factor in Gesicki’s expanded role - I wouldn’t expect him to be featured once Higgins returns. That being said, the Bengals just lost TE Erick All for the season, and next week, Gesicki faces a Ravens defense giving up the 7th-most fantasy points over expectation to tight ends. He would be a fine start in that spot were Higgins to miss another week.
4. **A.J. Barner** \- Based on his Week 9 usage, Seattle’s rookie tight end had the 7th-most expected fantasy points among tight ends, according to PFF. While he turned his 7 targets into just 4 catches for 27 yards, he posted the highest route share (86%) of any Seahawks TE this season. He may not be a special talent (his pro comp was Durham Smythe, per Player Profiler), but his role is worth stashing on your bench until we get a better idea of how long Noah Fant will be out.
5. **Theo Johnson** \- Johnson had his best performance of the season on Sunday, turning a season-high 6 targets into 3 catches for 51 yards and a touchdown. He trailed only Malik Nabers in target share with 23.1%, and had a 72.4% route share. Johnson has the 7th-highest athleticism score among 479 all-time tight ends analyzed by PlayerProfiler, and the Giants have the most favorable remaining schedule for tight ends rest of season.

**Notable Snubs**

* WR **Quentin Johnston** \- More than half of Johnston’s Week 9 receiving yards came on a 66-yard touchdown, and he’s had more than 5 targets in just one game this season. Johnston also had the second-most fantasy points over expected (+14.3) among WRs in Week 9. Additionally, per Ryan Heath of FantasyPoints, busted coverage plays account for 44% of Johnston’s 2024 fantasy output. QJ has flashed at times in Year 2, but his production has been too dependent on splash plays.
* WR **Demarcus Robinson** \- Robinson benefitted from Puka Nacua’s ejection on Sunday, but his four touchdowns over the past two games are fool’s gold. With Nacua and Kupp back and healthy, Robinson can not be trusted in fantasy lineups.
* TE **Jonnu Smith** \- Smith set a season-high in route share (83%) in Week 9 and turned 6 targets into a respectable 5 catches for 46 yards. However, I don’t see the upside for his role given where he stands behind Tyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle, and De’Von Achane in the target pecking order.
* WR **Jalen Coker** \- Coker took a step back in Week 9 as his route share dropped from 80% to 59% and he earned just 3 targets. Assuming Adam Thielen doesn’t get traded, his return is imminent, which is bad news for Coker’s role expanding. While Jonathan Mingo (targeted once in Week 9) was traded to the Cowboys, it’s hard for me to see Bryce Young supporting Coker in addition to Thielen and Legette on a weekly basis.
* TE **Ja’Tavion Sanders** \- In Week 9, Sanders generated the most receiving yards over expected in a game by a rookie tight end this season (+50) ,per Next Gen Stats. He also led the Panthers in receiving, catching 4 balls for 87 yards. However, he’s still contending with Tommy Tremble (when healthy) at the tight end position on a team quarterbacked by Bryce Young.
* RB **Jaylen Wright** \- While Wright has shown promise as a rookie, he is one Mostert or Achane injury away from a 1B role in Miami’s backfield. That role is valuable in an explosive offense like the Dolphins’, but I prefer the upside of guys like Davis, Corum, and Benson, who are one injury away from potential workhorse roles. If you have the bench space, however, he’s worth the stash.
* RB **Isaac Guerendo** \- With CMC trending towards a Week 10 return and Jordan Mason back at practice, it remains to be seen who the CMC backup to roster is. Until we have an answer, I prefer to roster guys like Davis, Corum, and Benson who have clear paths to workhorse roles.",2024-11-05 17:58:53,128,fantasyfootball

How it works: parent comment the name of a player you want feedback on. People respond to your comment with either Buy/Sell/Hold. Try to Ctrl/Cmd + F to find a player before posting a player name.

• Buy- you think a players value will go up compared to trade market price currently

• Hold- you think a players value will hold steady

• Sell- you think a players value will go down but is worth trading away right now

• Drop- you think this player is no longer worth owning

Reminder many people use buy and hold interchangeably. If you think a player is generally undervalued then he’s a buy not a hold. If a players value looks steady and valued correctly then he’s a hold not a buy/sell. Looking forward to helping each other out in this thread!

Week 10 Buy Low Candidates: Trade Deadline Edition,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gkbzau/week_10_buy_low_candidates_trade_deadline_edition/,1gkbzau,jalendepew,"**Buy Low Candidates for Week 10:**

Last week, I suggested Evan Engram, BTJ, Tank Dell, Nico Collins, DeAndre Hopkins and Travis Etienne Jr. as possible buy low/at cost candidates. I will explain how these options fared and an updated Buy, Hold, Sell or TBD rating depending on how last week looked under this week’s list.

1. **Drake London (ATL):** London only played 19% of snaps before being ruled out with a hip pointer on Sunday, following a poor performance against Tampa in Week 8. His status for week 10 is up in the air, but his schedule for the fantasy playoffs is absolutely beautiful and this is not expected to be a long-term injury. 

**OFFER:** Would absolutely throw an offer of someone like JSN, Terry McLaurin, or possibly Chase Brown if somebody is really high on him following his dominant performance, plus a WR3 or WR4. 

1. **Marvin Harrison Jr (ARI):** Marvin Harrison Jr is one of the more frustrating players of anyone drafted in the first two rounds without including injury. I would not be comfortable trading for him at a WR1 or even WR2 price tag. However, after he puts up 3.4 I would absolutely trade for him from an owner who is fed up with probably starting him when he’s been bad and benching him when he’s been excellent. Beyond the expectation of rookies improving as the season goes on, we also have amazing matchups against NE, CAR and LAR on the schedule in the fantasy playoffs. Not a start every week but when it’s time to win your league, this could easily change. 

**OFFER:** Try to send a higher floor, lower upside piece like Tony Pollard who has looked nice all year but will probably see Tyjae take some work when he returns.

1. **Tyreek Hill (MIA):** Tyreek has underwhelmed all year, but surprisingly he has also been uninspiring in the games Tua has played since returning from his concussion. The offense has still looked good, scoring 27 in both contests and Tyreek is a proven talent where we can expect positive regression. Get him now before his inevitable blowup against the Rams. Could easily finish Top 3 in PPG ROS at WR.

**OFFER:** I’m offering low-end WR1s or two WR2s for Hill. 

1. **Brian Thomas Jr (again, JAX):** Last week I said to buy Brian Thomas Jr. at a high-end WR2 price tag, which I felt was lower than his ceiling and worth it. Now I would advise to buy even more aggressively after he sees 91% of snaps and still only puts up 2 receptions for 22 yards. This was a bit of an odd contest where Jax only possessed the ball for 21:48, last in the entire NFL by over a minute, and Thomas didn’t practice fully all week with his injury. 

**OFFER:** I would bid aggressively now. Offer a middle-tier WR2, or an RB2 and a WR3-4. However, be willing to seemingly “overpay,” and you will likely come out ahead by season’s end.

1. **Breece Hall (NYJ):** Similar to London and Hill with having back-to-back disappointing weeks, Breece Hall has now had 4 contests under 10.6 PPR points. Some people may also be concerned about Braelon Allen’s usage, which I think is overblown given Breece still gets 19 opportunities to Allen’s 5 and still a 76% snap share. Also, he has been efficient this season in his usage against good matchups and I expect the Jets offense to improve to around average as Adams continues to get comfortable, raising his touchdown upside. Finally, Breece also has possibly the best RB playoff schedule of JAX, LAR, and BUF. Buy. 

**OFFER:** If someone really likes David Montgomery or Chase Brown I would send them with some depth options for Breece. Or possibly trade a player like Amon-Ra for Breece and another piece on this list if your team is struggling with injuries/depth. 

1. **Ceedee Lamb (DAL):** There is a wave of anxiety around Ceedee Lamb that is entirely understandable. Not bad enough that he has a sprained AC joint - although reports are optimistic that he will play - his pro bowl quarterback is likely to be placed on IR with a hamstring. Additionally, the Cowboys offense has looked dysfunctional pretty much all year and won’t look to have a sudden jolt with Cooper Rush at the helm. People are trying to get off of Ceedee now before he plays again just in case he stinks it up with Rush. I would absolutely be buying. In the 3 4th quarter drives that featured Rush, Ceedee was targeted 7 times including the 2-point conversion attempt. Ceedee has also seen some rushing usage in key situations, they clearly plan to lean on him especially with a backup QB. While he might not be a top 3 options every week with Rush, I still expect him to be a PPR hog like we’ve seen with Nabers in NY despite another awful QB in Jones. Additionally, Dak will possibly be back for the fantasy playoffs when the Cowboys will have an amazing schedule of CAR, TB, and PHI. Buy now. 

**OFFER:** Sending my low-end RB1s or WR1s for him. 

Honorable Mentions: Kenneth Walker III, Mike Evans, Pacheco and Amari Cooper



**LAST WEEK’S RECAP:**

1. **Engram (JAX):** BUY/HOLD Evan Engram gets you 10 targets and 11.5 PPR points, which you will absolutely take given how gross the tight end market, albeit improving, has looked this year. Would still try to acquire if able.
2. **Brian Thomas Jr (JAX):** **BUY IN HUGE BLINKING MASSIVE RED LETTERS** Even a BETTER buy low this week, given he played 91% of snaps and put up one of his worst performances of the year. Expect positive regression going forward as he gets to 100% health.
3. **Tank Dell (HOU): HOLD** Puts up a good, albeit not unbelievable PPR performance as the WR1 this week. Encouraging 9 targets though and 126 yards, matching and surpassing his season high respectively. Probably will not be able to get him for any significant discount as his value rest of season is a high-upside WR2 instead of the possible high-end WR3 he was valued at last week.
4. **Nico Collins (HOU): HOLD/TBD** I’d expect positive news about Collins’ potential return this week so the window to acquire him is likely shut. However, there’s a small chance the Collins owner may be concerned about how CJ Stroud has looked this season, and may want to part for an asset like Nabers in which case I would still pull the trigger. 
5. **DeAndre Hopkins (KC): HOLD/SELL** Absolutely smashes on MNF, the window to buy low is slammed close. 
6. **Travis Etienne Jr. (JAX): BUY** Etienne was a longer-term buy low, I would still throw out a feeler after his lackluster performance. De’Ernest Johnson still had a 24% snap share which I’d expect Etienne to fully replace once he’s healthy. He will also have the more valuable 3rd down and redzone role.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Every league is different. Players on the waiver wire in your league may not be available in someone else’s league. It’s important to evaluate each team in each of your leagues on a case-by-case basis when submitting claims.

Here's the Kicker -- Week 10 -- New Visualization Announced!,147,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gk8kud/heres_the_kicker_week_10_new_visualization/,1gk8kud,subvertadown,"\[Kicker Rankings below, and [DST post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gk669j/defensive_maneuvers_2024_week_10_subvertadown/)\]  Hi everyone! I don't remember when I last made an early-week version of Kickers.  Mostly I've done Thursday aggregate rankings in 2024.

But today I wanted to draw your attention to a new Kicker tool:

# Background

I've had this creation in the works for a long time.  In a way, it's the culmination of many various developments:

* **Last week**, I posted my most complete (and hopefully clearest) explanation of all the [considerations that go into the predictive modeling](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gge0c7/heres_the_kicker_midseason_explanation_of/).  Read it if you want to know the whole philosophy.
* **And back in week 3**, I'd made a post [explaining what variables determine likely field position for kicking](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1fjryti/heres_the_kicker_a_new_view_on_field_goal/).  Answering ""*which variables determine long kicks versus short kicks*?""

I think BOTH of these posts\^\^ provide some of the most super-interesting stuff to explore.  So I hope you didn't miss them.  (If you like the nerdier side of this stuff.)

# Situational Kicker Curves

And \^\^these two pieces of background bring us to this new visualization:  The whole purpose is to better communicate ""*What kind of situation the kicker is likely to see-- relative to the average kicker circumstance?*""

If you go to the [website front page now](https://subvertadown.com/), you can **freely browse images like the following for all kickers** (The top 8 are free on the front page):

[These new charts appear on the tool-tip, for all kickers.  It shows how much more likely a kicker is to be at each field position.](https://preview.redd.it/fo13mxc9b3zd1.jpg?width=4623&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ee0b5d544b9b7c06859ebb9445d7bab6994d0ac)

I programmed the text explanations in the bullet-points, so they are auto-generated, to help you interpret the graph.

The example shown above is curvier than some others.  Here's how to read it, starting from left to right:

1. **Punts.** At the far left, the curve goes negative, which means this team is expected to punt less often than other teams.  All these are *for the current match.  Not necessarily for all games in the future.*
2. **Fourth downs.**  Next-- at about 55 yards-- there is a region labeled ""4th"", which means the models believe that this kicker's team will go-for-it-on-the-4th (not punt, and not take a long FG), at this section of the field.  The width of 4th down region is different for each kicker-- and for each matchup.
3. **Long Field Goals.** Then we come to FG range, and you can see that the curve bends to the positive.  The models think this kicker will have slightly *more chances* to take long kicks.  (Compared to the average kicker.)
4. **Short field goals.** Interestingly, for this example, the curve goes negative again.  That means the team is less likely to stop in the region of a 10-29 yard field goal, compared to the average kicker.  (That doesn't mean it won't happen-- in fact there's still a good chance of ending up there-- it just means it's more likely to happen for other kickers than this one.)
5. **RZ.** In this case it's weakly relevant due to point #4.  But again, the ""4th"" label means this team is expected more likely to go-for-it-on-the-4th (not take the FG), in cases when they end up a few yards shy of the end-zone.
6. **TDs and PATs.**  Finally, to the far right, the curve bends up in the end-zone, meaning this kicker should see slightly more PATs than the average.  (The occurrence of two point conversions is considered here too, by the way.)

# Background: Input data

At risk of repeating myself... Very many pieces go into all this, even though it comes out like a simplified picture.  **So a reminder, here are examples of some variables that I test for statistical significance (**[**original post here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gge0c7/heres_the_kicker_midseason_explanation_of/)**):**

* **TD- related**: Extra points, Missed XPs, Two-pt conversions.
* **FG-related**: Missed FGs, Overall volume, and by distances: 20yd FG, 30yd, 40yd, 50+.
* **Vegas lines**: Own team implied score, and opponent implied score.
* **Conditions**: Wind, Grass/turf, Dome/outdoors, Rain, Snow, Home/away, Mondays, Thursdays.
* **Team defense**: rushing yards allowed, interceptions, early game points allowed, forced fumbles
* **Team offense**: Pace of game, Passing efficiency, QB rushing, 1st-quarter scoring, RZ
* **Opponent**: Division, Playoff chances, Drive success rate, allowed rushing yards, RZ%-allowed scoring.
* **A lot of other**: rushing or receiving volumes and efficiencies, sacks, turnovers, etc.
* **And yes**: Fourth downs.

# What about ""Why so high / why so low?""

The new Situational Kicker Curve tool above is something ***calculated*** *from primary inputs*.  In contrast, the ""Why so high / why so low"" tool usually identifies those primary ***inputs***.  The inputs feed into making that the curve.  (And, of course, the resulting curve helps to describe the expected fantasy points).  So the two tools are not redundant-- they work together.

# Kickers for Week 10

To celebrate this milestone-- meaning a tool that I will personally enjoy even if nobody else does!-- I will break from tradition of not ordering kickers here on Reddit.  So for this week, here is a list of the current (Tuesday)  rankings:

|Kickers in week 10|
|:-|
|Koo (frustrating)|
|Elliott (also frustrating)|
|Bass|
|~~Reichard~~ (O)|
|Tucker|
|Bates|
|SF kicker (Carlson or Moody)|
|Butker|
|Seibert|

I hope you can tell, I've always really like sharing things, so I'm happy to be able to share this before we add some restrictions to the site next week  (some content to be locked-- [Reasons due to my situation, which I posted at my private channel here](https://www.reddit.com/user/subvertadown/comments/1ginker/the_subvertadown_site_a_couple_additions_and_also/)).    So hopefully you'll enjoy this as much as I will.  I'll be interested in your feedback-- There are kinks to iron out, but overall I hope it helps your decision-making process.  For me, that's what it's all about!

Good luck.

Brock Bowers sits as TE1 going into his bye week. He just recorded his *second* touchdown.,936,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gk76qd/brock_bowers_sits_as_te1_going_into_his_bye_week/,1gk76qd,Glum-Ad8210,"We know Bowers has been killing it. But it is ridiculous that most of this comes without the benefit of TDs.

Taking out week 3 and 4 low target days, his floor was against a stout KC defense at 10.8 in PPR on 5 targets. Besides those three games, never less than 8 targets on 10.2 YPC. Once he finds the end zone more his numbers will only go up. Oh and we all know he's been doing this with a trash QB and OC situation.

I believe in a higher Bowers",2024-11-05 13:53:55,159,fantasyfootball

The browns offense has been terrible this year and is currently the 31st ranked offense and his upcoming schedule is BYE, NO, PIT, DEN, PIT, KC, CIN, MIA. During that time only the NO and MIA games are arguably good matchups. What are you doing with Chubb going forward?",2024-11-05 13:34:20,56,fantasyfootball

Defensive Maneuvers -- 2024 Week 10 -- Subvertadown Early D/ST Picks,138,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gk669j/defensive_maneuvers_2024_week_10_subvertadown/,1gk669j,subvertadown,"\[[Post about kickers here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gk8kud/heres_the_kicker_week_10_new_visualization/)\]

Let's continue the debate and deliberations of our D/ST options!

.

# Last week 

Frankly, week 9 felt like the letdown that many of us sensed:  3 busts near the top!

Saints had already fallen naturally in the rankings (CB injuries), but the biggest surprise was the Chiefs not coming through in MNF.  Well done if you chose the Chargers.  We should have heeded the comment that one of you left on the website: ""Hard to believe they're \[Chargers\] so low... Winston is going to come back to earth this week"".  Prescient.

.

# Pick6x6 

We had **69** votes last week.  [Don't forget to cast your week 10 picks here!](https://subvertadown.com/pick-six-by-six/2024/10)

# Defensive Maneuvers -- Week 10 Tiers 

There seems to be a good mix this week.  We have some standout options, then some less uncertain picks that are worthy of discussion.

|Tier|Why so high?|Why so low?|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1 - Chargers vs. Titans|Pros: Vegas implied score, QB Interceptions|Cons: Yards allowed, Def. Interceptions|
|1 - Bears vs. Patriots|Pros: Vegas implied score, Yards allowed|Cons: Opposing QB, Yards allowed|
|2 - Chiefs vs. Broncos|Pros: Vegas implied score, Yards allowed|Cons: QB Interceptions|
|2 - Eagles @ Cowboys|Pros: Vegas implied score, Opposing QB change|Cons: Def. Interceptions, Yards allowed|
|2 - Giants @ Panthers|Pros: Vegas implied score, QB Interceptions|Cons: Def. Interceptions, Yards allowed|
|2 - Vikings @ Jaguars|Pros: Vegas implied score, Def. Interceptions|Cons: QB Interceptions, Yards allowed|
|2 - Falcons @ Saints|Pros: Vegas implied score, Yards allowed|Cons: Yards allowed|
|3 - 49ers @ Buccaneers|Pros: Vegas implied score, Yards allowed|Cons:  QB Interceptions|
|3 - Bills @ Colts - Lower in ESPN|Pros: Opposing QB, QB Interceptions|Cons: Opposing QB change, Yards allowed|
|3 - Patriots @ Bears|Pros: QB Interceptions, Yards allowed|Cons: Def. Interceptions, Vegas implied score|
|3 - Lions @ Texans - Lower in ESPN|Pros: Sacks, Yards allowed|Cons: QB Interceptions, Vegas implied score|

As before, D/STs are in tiers, as sorted by an algorithm-- to provide early-Tuesday rankings. The rankings are for Yahoo scoring, and any significant deviations for ESPN scoring are indicated.  The ""pros/cons"" categories are just quick and dirty simplifications of the website tool.

Remember this is just a Tuesday **preview**, serving to help discussion and thoughts for waivers tonight. Always expect the D/ST rankings to shift during week. At the moment you can still [check the website](https://subvertadown.com/weekly/defense) for the most up-to-date model projections.  (Sorry that might not be the case next week, [as described here](https://www.reddit.com/user/subvertadown/comments/1ginker/the_subvertadown_site_a_couple_additions_and_also/). I would much prefer to keep it up!)

.

Good luck!

We've already seen some big names moved in the last few weeks. Maybe wait to cut a fringe player that could be in a new situation by the end of the day (i.e. Nuk a couple weeks ago). 

Potentially try to sell high on players that may be getting competition soon (i.e. Otton 🐐 or Pickens). 

Not everyone is paying attention to the fact the deadline is today, so you may be able to take advantage. At the very least, try your best to wait until the dust settles to make any rash decisions.",2024-11-05 12:06:41,146,fantasyfootball

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Hunt has been a beast and Pacheco coming off broken leg… how soon would they really turn the keys back over to Pacheco?

From a production standpoint I fear Hunt fades, even if he is still utilized in a committee. I suppose the hope is that Hunt is the one getting goal line carries.

Anyways, what are your thoughts on Hunt and whether he stays relevant come fantasy playoffs?",2024-11-05 10:28:56,47,fantasyfootball

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Jayden Reed catch* at end of first half?,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gjj1j9/jayden_reed_catch_at_end_of_first_half/,1gjj1j9,henny_on_da_rocks,"Not sure if this is allowed, but it didn't seem to be against the rules so I figured I'd ask: Did the Jayden Reed catch at the end of the first half of GB/DET get confirmed to be a catch anywhere? The broadcast never showed a replay and it looked like it hit the ground? It was like a \~50 yard catch and then the clock for the half expired.

Does the NFL review stuff like that and take away the catch if they determine it wasn't or is it just a non-issue because it was inconsequential to the game? Feels like it could be a pretty major stat correction if they do take it away

  
**EDIT:** This guy found a replay that's pretty clearly ruling it a catch on the field so question has been answered, thanks u/[rvH3Ah8zFtRX](https://www.reddit.com/user/rvH3Ah8zFtRX/): 

""I'm not sure why the NFL uploaded the video in stupid 4:3, but you can clearly see the ref signal that Reed was down where he caught it:

As I've noted [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1fnld28/explainer_how_stats_are_assigned_to/), it's all encompassed by the [NFL Guide for Statisticians (2024 ed.), p. 20](https://www.nflgsis.com/gsis/documentation/stadiumguides/guide_for_statisticians.pdf):

>When the receiver of a lateral is beyond the line of scrimmage, or if there is no line of scrimmage, it is his position that determines the yardage gained by each of the individuals involved. The player who throws the lateral is credited with yards gained only to the point at which the lateral is caught, provided this point is behind the spot from which the lateral is thrown.

>Example: Second-and-20 on own 20-yard line. Player catches a forward pass at his own 40, then attempts to lateral to a teammate who is at the 38. The teammate then:

>(a) Catches the ball and is downed at the 38. Scoring: First player gets one reception for 18 yards.

>(b) Catches the ball and runs to the 45. Scoring: First player gets one reception for 18 yards; second player gets 7 yards in pass receiving category, but is not credited with a reception. Credit a first down passing.

>(c) Muffs the ball and an opponent recovers on the 33. Scoring: First player gets one reception for 13 yards and a fumble. Opponent gets a fumble recovery.


The [NFL Gamebook (.pdf) records the play thusly](https://static.www.nfl.com/gamecenter/ae9ce486-1312-11ef-afd1-646009f18b2e.pdf): ""1-10-MIA-30:  T.Tagovailoa pass short right to D.Achane to MIA 29 for -1 yards. Lateral to J.Waddle to MIA 6 for -23 yards (G.Rousseau).""

And that tracks -- even though Achane advanced to the 33, he is credited with a 1-yard loss because the 29 is where Waddle received the lateral.  His yards are receiving yards because the play started with a forward pass, and he loses what he lost.

Folks, do bookmark that [Statisticians Guide.](https://www.nflgsis.com/gsis/documentation/stadiumguides/guide_for_statisticians.pdf) When someone in your league is whining about a QB tackle behind the line of scrimmage which ""should have been"" a sack, the answer's right there.",2024-11-04 15:17:02,141,fantasyfootball

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)

*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Is it a risk to roster elite fantasy options on teams that likely aren't headed to the playoffs?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gixbrw/is_it_a_risk_to_roster_elite_fantasy_options_on/,1gixbrw,ponderingorangutan,"For instance, the Miami Dolphins are loaded with elite fantasy options but likely won't have a lot to play for soon. The worry is that if one of their superstars, like Hill or Achane gets hurt, they could choose to just sit them out the rest of the season regardless of if it's a season ending injury because there's no point in bringing them back. Maybe I'm still scarred from the 2020 Joe Mixon day-to-day injury that ended up being season ending, but this is a concern that pops up for me every year. Thoughts?

As such, I do a lot of reading from various websites. Having no knowledge of the players or other such instincts, when faced with a ""do I or don't I"" decision, I will more heavily weigh the opinions of the experts.  Often, I end up regretting it.  For example, this week multiple sites and experts said that Zay Flowers' production will be limited with the addition of Johnson to the roster, and that the Broncos' Suritan would shadow him and lock him down. So, mourn me fellow managers, because I benched him. At the half, he already has 30fpts. 

So, veterans, how do you go about reconciling ""experts opnions"" vs. reality in your decision making process?",2024-11-03 19:43:33,45,fantasyfootball

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

Jauan Jennings (58% owned in ESPN leagues) and Ricky Pearsall (19% owned); both on BYE this week. Who has more value going forward with Aiyuk done for the year?,173,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gio6hm/jauan_jennings_58_owned_in_espn_leagues_and_ricky/,1gio6hm,2021darkmosssxp,"There's a good chance one or both are available in your league given the bye week.

Jennings was a 7th round pick in 2020.

Pearsall was a 1st round pick this year.

We haven't seen much of Pearsall since he missed the first 6 games of the season.

We also haven't seen a single game yet where both of them played (Jennings missed weeks 7 and 8), so it's not clear how they'll be used going forward.

I think it's most likely Deebo, Jennings and Pearsall will be the 3 starting WRs for the 49ers; just unclear which of the latter 2 will have more value going forward.

Is Jennings JAG who had one outlier game? He's been underwhelming in 5 of 6 games, and the one great game he had was with Deebo out.

What do you think?

Posting this because I am sure there are others out there who are curious and may have someone on their bench worth dumping for one of these two before their bench players get locked today.",2024-11-03 14:33:28,111,fantasyfootball

Know Your Weather - Week 9,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1ginklo/know_your_weather_week_9/,1ginklo,Mortiegama,"**Lions @ Packers:** This is going to be some decent rains, wet field, and high winds! It could cause a hit to the passing game, but this still plays to be a major battle! The Vegas over is still 47.5 so unless you have someone that is ranked directly behind any of your Lions or Packers players, I wouldn't pivot.

**Buccaneers @ Chiefs:** Another good shot at rain, though being so far out things could change a lot before then. With the winds not playing into this as much, shouldn't downgrade much here.

FGB's Week 9 Flex Projections - Sunday Update,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gin3x0/fgbs_week_9_flex_projections_sunday_update/,1gin3x0,FantasyGoldenBoy,"# Week 9 Flex Projections

**Weather**

GB vs DET is going to be nasty, high winds and a lot of rain at some points.  The passing attack for those teams has been reduced, mostly in the high aDOT area.  The only other weather issue is maybe a little wind in NE vs TEN but as of now it's not high enough to effect anything.

**Biggest Difference vs Consensus Projections**

* **T.J. Hockenson** (10.3, +2.87 vs ECP) - I choose to believe Hock will be back with no limits.  The Colts defense is a solid match up and Indy plays super fast so Minnesota should get a lot of plays in.  As long as the Colts can look decent on offense, which they have with Flacco, I think Hockenson is in for a good game.
* **Amon-Ra St. Brown** (11.3, -3.03 vs ECP) - This is mostly because of the weather but also a bit due to the Detroit offense.  His role has changed from last year and many of the High Value Plays I look for to project TDs have been taken on by other positions.  Also GB and DET are both in the lower third of pace of play, if this game is sloppy and run heavy on both ends I think ARSB's ceiling is limited.

Injuries should all be up to date based on current Projected Lineups.  Doubtful is considered Out and Questionable with no flagged phrases is considered in.  I do not have any inside information, inactives/actives are all based on Rotogrinders expected lineups and ESPN injury reports. I will try to update the rankings below when the game time decisions are made but the [website](http://www.fantasygoldenboy.com/) will be quicker to update, as well as having a Range Plot view showing upside/downside, Full PPR/STD rankings, positional rankings and deeper rankings.  Any changes between Thursday and today will most likely be due to Offensive/Defensive injury updates, weather or betting lines changing, I rarely do major changes to the model mid-week. Feel free to ask any questions or leave any criticisms. Thanks for reading and good luck.

A quick breakdown of some of the more important variables that go into the projections.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Hes tied with nabers for the most catchable targets per game when Flacco is under center.

The other Recievers that rank top 10 in catchable targets per game include: 
Kupp, Godwin, Lamb, G Wilson, Nico, Chase, JJ & London.  

In his last 9 games (Cle & Ind) Flacco leads the NFL in passing touchdowns per game at 2.2. 

The other QBs top 5 in touchdowns per game Love, Cousins, Mayfield, Prescott - All attached to a top 15 WR. 

Downs is 17th is YAC per game, has also been a great separator so far this season.

Week 10 Waiver Wire Additions *EARLY* from Kevin Tompkins,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gi7kb4/week_10_waiver_wire_additions_early_from_kevin/,1gi7kb4,NatePolvogt,"This season has been a struggle for us fantasy managers, and combing the waiver wire every week has felt depressing, if we're being honest. Heading into Week 9, Kevin Tompkins has ***5 players*** that are rostered in ***10% or less of leagues on ESPN.***

***Stay ahead of your league mates with these Week 10 Waiver Wire targets a week early.***

# Elijah Moore (WR – CLE)

***ESPN Rostership (7.1%)***

Moving to Moore, he’s been a forgotten-about slot man for the Browns this season. He has run between 60-70 percent of routes and has done it with no fanfare. Enter Winston’s aggressive arm and a renewed optimism, and Moore is back in the limelight. Not only that but being used downfield too. Moore’s 9.2-yard [aDOT](https://optimusfantasy.com/fantasy-football-terms-101/) is a far cry from his 5.7-yard aDOT the previous seven weeks of the season, and he took 26 percent of the air yards en route to an 8-85 game on 12 targets, a 32 percent target share.

That’s also 29 percent of the team’s first-read targets as well, a clear sign of not only Winston’s intent on targeting a player but offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey’s intent as a play-caller to call plays, with Moore being the first read for Winston.

Player Projections Powered by Vegas Player Props - Week 9,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gi6htt/player_projections_powered_by_vegas_player_props/,1gi6htt,MundaneNumber,"Angles and curves.  At its core, football can be broken down to physics and geometry.  We have Derrick Henry running through you with Bucky Irving repeatedly cutting back across the entire field.  What is a route other than a redirection angle.  Space and volume.  Within music, the absence of sound is arguably more important than moments saturated with sound.  Paralleled with the NFL as players on offense have a primary objective to fill empty space through avoiding defenders.  Legitimately every physical sport and virtual esport are predicated by human beings attempting to find the ""best"" angles and curves.  Maybe even the root of life in itself. 

Another fresh wave of data points from last week, obviously some more telling than others.  I just traded Devonta Smith for Ladd McConkey and Josh Downs, due to a firm belief in the significance of their week 8 performances, and Flacco's immortality.  Back to the main objective, we are purely focused on predicting week 9's outcome.  Does data from week 1 and 2 even matter anymore?  You need to be constantly devaluing fantasy data, as time goes on.  As you delve deeper into the past, each week's data becomes increasingly less significant for fantasy purposes.  Yet, Alvin Kamara's 43 point week 2 performance isn't even his career ceiling.  I'd imagine *that* 43 has significance.  One above 42 the meaning of life, as the supercomputer from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy would claim. 

Forget about making these significance estimates on your own.  [VegasProjections.com](http://vegasprojections.com/) has weekly median projections dictated by advanced math models factoring in nearly every aspect/angle we aren't aware of.  In evidence of a stronger system that outperforms Vegas's models, a rapid adjustment mechanism guarantees restoration of profitability equilibrium.  The primary driving force behind the lucrativity of sportsbooks.  

Top 26 rated skill players\*\* this week include:

1. Kyren Williams 16.24
2. Alvin Kamara 16.08
3. Joe Mixon 16.06
4. Saquon Barkley 15.83

\*\*Derrick Henry is missing his reception prop but is at 13.75 without it.  Ja'Marr as well at 11.85.  All values except Aaron Jones and Kenneth Walker are from consensus projections. 

This week we see that Kyler has risen to elite orange status, regardless of the new Call of Duty release.  A potential under bet?  Given his history of failure post Call of Duty release.  Mahomes is flying up the rankings, making us question if the old Patty is back (in terms of fantasy value).  While the Kansas City defense rightfully has stifled Baker's value.  At the top of the board is a large grouping of elite running backs with similar monster 16 point projections, causing no running back to have a red valuation (colors are determined by percentile within players on the current page).  You may want to prioritize efforts to acquire anyone in this grouping, an epiphany I recently reached, or else fall behind.  The top five running backs all outproject the top WR with CeeDee at 15.71.  Having an elite reciever at this moment is an extreme positional advantage (in no order CeeDee, JJ, ARSB, AJB, Malik, Ja'Marr).  If you're wondering what Vegas thinks about Diontae's value in Baltimore, they're clueless as well.  Kelce might be his old self again, and Njoku is apparently reaching his potential.  

As always, thank you all for the support.  Incredibly, out of over 300 hits to the sportsbook affiliate link, not a single person has actually made an account.  Kudos, as I repeatedly stress to be careful betting against Vegas. I just have the link there so that the occasional individual refusing to acknowledge the site figure's veracity has an easy outlet to put their money where their mouth is.  Which I respect, as long as you have strong statistical data or historic accuracy backing up your wagers.  Test your systems on the past 8 weeks for concept validation.  Vegas is not perfect, and if you are determined enough, you can find profitable edges.  Yet be warned, sportsbooks notoriously cheat by limiting super profitable customers, so mastery of sportsbetting goes hand in hand with a life of rotating sportsbooks worldwide, through a wide array of devious techniques. 

As a final reminder, remember these are median projections, not mean projections.  Mentally elevate values on players with higher ceilings, as outliers are not captured in the median as much as the mean, which is the true score projection.",2024-11-02 21:09:09,38,fantasyfootball

* **Normalized Predicted Player Stats** – 18 machine learning models under the hood to create 0-100 predictions for projections, yards, touchdowns, opportunities (model per stat). This is used on all layers of the app.
* **Matchup Summary –** *One of our favorites*, Shows the offense dimensions against the opposing team’s dimensions and DEF rating. (We’ve had great luck with this showing where stacks live and predicting game outcomes with this table)
* **Swipe to Select –** Selection ability at team, offense component, and player level:
   * **Team –** selects QB1, RB1, WR1, WR2, WR3, TE1 puts into player pool
   * **Component –** selects underlying players (ex: REC = WR1, WR2, WR3) into pool
   * **Player –** select individual player (selections flow up and down the layers)
* **Slate & Position Filtering –** Select/Deselect day or position type
* **Selection Buckets –** The app lets users select players into the buckets RPO (default), DFS, Props, and Waiver (intended to help categorize players by use)
* **Player Detail (Click name) –** RPO stats including consolidated YTdOT which combines a quick view of Yards, Touchdowns, Opportunities, and Touches for last three games. Also shows percentile ranking, against DEF stats, draftkings and fanduel salaries, variance, opposing def against position. *Another one of our favorites* – production AGAINST the opposing defense last 3 games showing pass and run delineation. 

**What we are considering adding (added numbering for referencing):**

**#1.   Changing Stat Scoring to Stat Predictions (**[recently put output of this on tik tok](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP88EonsK/)**) –** We’ve been predicting actual stats using our models with pretty good accuracy. We feel like this reduces simplicity of analysis compared to 0-100 scoring but we know it would be useful for picks/props. (Think seeing actual TD prediction instead of 0-100 scoring potential).

**#2.**   [Production against 9-Box](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gcqmcu/nfl_receiver_9box_heatmap_week_8_r_visualizations/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) **–** see digest here, we’ve leveled this up a bit since the post and it’s creating interesting views.

**#3.   Add More Player Detail Stats –** we’ve found ourselves wanting things like target share, airyards, total team scoring last three, information about players on the team, information about coverage, etc.

**#4.   Live stat/injury/news/weather data –** we are working on the API infrastructure for this, but since it’s available in so many other apps it feels like we want deeper analytics over duplicative content. But we know it’s currently annoying for things like IR players showing up because they were on the roster when we ran the models.

**#5.   Player Pick Recommendations –** this one is a decent amount of work, but we know the analysis without clear ""who to pick"" can still be dense, even with the 0 to 100 scoring. Think a swipe up menu where it shows you top 3 RPO plays relative to the format you are looking at.

**#6.   Team Detail Pop-up (Click team) –** a view to see players underlying a team and associated stats. Would show rolling team production, and potentially which players in that team you have selected. We think this could facilitate team level pick’ems/bets.

**#7.    DFS/Props/Waiver Helper Swipe Ups –** supplemental swipe up tools to help execute picks. Think prop builder for constructing props or a DFS lineup workbench in the app.

We are two guys + a developer doing this as a hobby project, so any thoughts are welcome on how to spread our capacity. Feel free to give current app input as well if you are a user!

Defensive Backs Height: Does It Matter? A Comprehensive Analysis,0,https://brainyballers.com/defensive-back-height-does-it-matter-a-comprehensive-analysis/,1gi3fcj,Zachr08,"The “Does It Matter?” Series is back! Last week we looked at [RB’s Draft Capital](https://www.reddit.com/r/DynastyFF/s/nOY80Tx5Q9) to find whether that affects performance. For part 29 of “Does It Matter?” we looked at Defensive Back height.

Next week’s topic: Defensive Backs Weight

TL;DR: 5’10-3/8” and above is a threshold that occurs at a 14.2% higher frequency in the top 10 versus the bottom 10 since 2003. Further, there is no correlation between DB Height and success in regards to Fantasy Football production using standard statistical methods.

"Hi, I'm Chris Dell. I was the fantasy football industry's #1 most accurate ranker in 2023 (FantasyPros). I'm also #1 for QB, #1 for DST and #4 for RB in 2024. AMA!",1307,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gi2ovc/hi_im_chris_dell_i_was_the_fantasy_football/,1gi2ovc,ChrisDellFantasy,"Hi everyone! Chris Dell here. I won first place out of 235 an­a­lysts in the Fan­ta­syPros’ 2023 Fan­tasy Foot­ball NFL Draft Ac­cu­racy rank­ings com­pe­ti­tion. I'm also currently the #1 ranker for QB, #1 for DST, #4 for RB and #6 overall out of 175+ analysts in the FantasyPros' 2024 in-season NFL accuracy rankings. I'm here to help answer any and all questions you have: Week 9 starts, sits, streamers and stashes, as well as rest of season rankings and trade advice, or anything else you want to know about the sports media/fantasy football industry, etc etc. I currently own and operate [BettingPredators.com](http://BettingPredators.com) (BASED ON THE MOVIE, NOT THE HANSEN SHOW LOL), where I focus on fantasy football content and NFL player props, as well as prop betting for NBA and golf. I'm also the sports editor at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and have worked in the sports media industry now for 20+ years. I'm currently based in Pittsburgh, PA.

My journey into the fantasy football space is a bit more unconventional than most. I started in 2003 as a sophomore in high school/15-year-old kid covering sports for the Sarasota Herald-Tribune in Southwest, FL. My father, now retired, helped me start early in the newspaper business. He covered the NFL and all levels of sports reporting for decades since the 1970s, and over the years, I wrote for various outlets such as the New York Times, NY Daily News, ESPN .com, Yahoo!'s Rivals .com and many many others before pivoting to more of an editor/managerial role and eventually launching my own media platforms soon after.

I spent 10 years at the Herald-Tribune, a former New York Times-owned media outlet, before moving to NYC in 2012 to pursue my master's degree in entrepreneurial journalism. From 2012 to 2022, my life took many twists and turns. I built and launched a sports app with funding from Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert, as well as built and launched a sports website for famous sports bettor and philanthropist 'Mattress Mack.' During that time, I also worked in marketing, consulting and web/app design, collaborating with some really cool clients like NYC mayor Eric Adams and others in the music/hip-hop industry space as well.

In 2020, during COVID, I had some downtime and built the Betting Predators platform with some professional handicappers in Las Vegas. It's been a passion/side project of mine over the years. Over the past year, I've poured much more time into honing my specialties of fantasy football analysis and player prop betting/**producing the following weekly content**:

Outside of the sports/fantasy world, it's me and wifey up here in Pittsburgh. Most of family is either in Florida or Colombia (my mom is from Bogota). Her family is mainly from Belize/Guatemala, where we're taking a trip for Christmas this year. No kids (yet) and we're taking our time there (too much fantasy to analyze lol). My favorite teams to root for (unfortunately) are the University of South Florida Bulls (my alma mater), Colombian national soccer team (my first love), the Orlando Magic and the Cincinnati Bengals. Needless to say, I do not have much to brag about as a sports fan. I'm also a HUGE old-school/golden-era hip-hop fan. If you ever want to talk more of that or any of the above, just hit me on Twitter/X.

We'll get this AMA started around 2:30 p.m. EST today (Saturday 11/2) so I'll touch base back here shortly. Get your questions in ASAP. I'll be here for at least an hour or so to help out!

Launched a Free AI Trade Analyzer That Actually Explains Trades (Instead of Just Spitting Out Numbers),13,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gi2jqm/launched_a_free_ai_trade_analyzer_that_actually/,1gi2jqm,Aishik-Lala,"Hey r/fantasyfootball!

Ever notice how most trade analyzers just give you some vague numbers and charts, but never actually explain why a trade is good or bad? After getting frustrated with this myself, I built [**RotoBot AI**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rotobot-ai/id6502530085), a trade analyzer powered by advanced language AI that breaks down trades in plain English—and it's completely free to use.

**What makes RotoBot AI’s trade analyzer different:**

* Uses large language models to explain trades like a real analyst would
* Actually breaks down the logic in clear, conversational language
* No more generic ""Player A is worth 25.3 points"" responses
* Run as many trades as you want, completely free
* Analyzes trades from multiple angles (upside, floor, schedule, etc.)

Just plug in your players and get detailed explanations for why a trade makes sense (or doesn’t). No limits on usage.

Our team has been developing this tool for nearly two years, fine-tuning it to make sure it truly adds value for fantasy football players. For those who want to dive even deeper, we've also built a full AI chatbot assistant that can answer questions like:

* “Mooney, Dell, Moore, Coleman start 2”
* ""What's the downside risk of trading for Breece Hall?""
* ""Compare Waddle vs Higgins factoring in their QB situations and upcoming matchups""

But first and foremost—the trade analyzer is completely free and always will be. We built RotoBot AI because we were tired of trade tools that didn't actually explain their reasoning, and we knew modern AI could do better.

[**Try RotoBot AI here**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rotobot-ai/id6502530085). Only on iOS at the moment. Here's our [website](https://rotobot.ai/).

Would love your feedback as we keep building this out! Let me know if you have any questions about how it works.

Edit: Thanks for all the responses! Working through feedback and making improvements based on your suggestions. This product is literally just 3 weeks old so there is a long way to go, Looks like missing players is currently the frontrunner for errors - going to get that all patched up by the end of the week. Thanks again and hopefully our tool can help you.",2024-11-02 18:10:06,57,fantasyfootball

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Week 9 Bold Predictions,90,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1ghyeqb/week_9_bold_predictions/,1ghyeqb,Colin_McT,"I haven’t been consistent in posting these weekly bold predictions on this sub.

Bold predictions aren’t too consistent themselves.

But I’m on a high after a *BIG* Week 8 with bold prediction hits for Bo Nix, James Conner, and Cedric Tillman so I’m looking to keep the party going in Week 9.

The point of these bold predictions is to give managers one player at each position that *could* put up big numbers and swing your matchup. 

I wouldn’t recommend substituting an obvious stud for these players, but if you’re looking for some juice with bye weeks or injuries to others, then consider these players in Week 9.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

His rookie season was electric but he never r she’d those highs again, could it be a result of poor qb play and lack of opportunity, I think so.

I think we’re all jazzed about tillman and rightfully so, but can we really overlook the upside with Elijah, schedule ahead sucks but how the offense perform against the chargers will show just how productive this offense can or cannot be with Jamies undercenter, this guy moore sued to be a beast, maybe he hits a rebound, what do you think?

Spot start week for Jermaine Burton?,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1ghdsij/spot_start_week_for_jermaine_burton/,1ghdsij,FFdarkpassenger45,"Jermaine Burton is very talented no doubt (based on his collegiate and Preseason success) but has been hampered by off the field concerns (allegedly sleeping during team meetings in the preseason) and immaturity. This week could finally be the chance for Burton to really show what he is capable of on an NFL field. He has played very limited snaps this season and has only two catches (47, 41). He logged his highest snap count last week in Higgins absence at 41% and recorded 1 catch for 41 yards on 3 targets (nearly logged his 1st career TD on a red zone target). The big question is, why would Sunday's game be different than last week and give hope for an expanded role and usage? Here goes:

First off, Tee got injured late in the week last week likely after the team had installed their offensive gameplan. This means that they likely didn't install anything specific for Burton's skill set and he was probably not intending to get more than a handful of snaps if he wasn't going to be a healthy scratch. This week, the Bengals have known all week that Tee is unlikely to play and could plan accordingly to better suit Burton's skillset.

Next is the narrative coming out of Cincinnati surrounding Burton. There was an [article posted](https://www.bengals.com/news/jermaine-burton-emergence-of-another-in-a-line-of-explosive-bengals-wide-receivers-in-the-details) yesterday discussing the emergence of Jermaine Burton. Joe Burrow said in his presser that Burton needed to see more opportunities and he has natural abilities that can't be taught and they need to get him involved in the offense. Zac Taylor dismissed any concerns that he has had any off field issues recently and that he has earned the trust of the coaching staff. The WR coach said that during the snaps that he played last week he didn't miss a single assignment. It all adds up to a concerted effort to prepare the fanbase for an expanded role for Burton, at least this week, and potentially the remainder of the year.

Lastly, fresh legs this late in the season can't hurt, and Burton was the top rated WR by PFF in the preseason. The Bengals offense is lacking in weapons outside of Chase and need someone to step up. This could be a good opportunity for a least a spot start and a roster stash for the next time Tee gets hurt if you are like so many this year mired in WR injury hell.

TL:DR - If you are really hurting for a WR this week, you should give Jermaine Burton consideration for a spot start .",2024-11-01 19:32:19,49,fantasyfootball

"Mike Macdonald on @KIRONewsradio on DK Metcalf's (knee) potential return in Week 9: ""Unfortunately it's still a little bit cloudy on what's going on on that front.

Mike Gesicki is a good TE streaming option if Higgins doesn't play,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gha5nd/mike_gesicki_is_a_good_te_streaming_option_if/,1gha5nd,aceofspadez138,"Higgins has missed three games this year (weeks 1, 2, and 8). In those games, Gesicki was targeted 4, 9, and 8 times respectively and put up 3.3, 12.6, and 8.8 points in half-PPR. 

Full stats:



Week | Targets | Receptions | Yards | Pts Std | Pts HPPR | Pts PPR
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
1 | 4 | 3 | 18 | 1.8 | 3.3 | 4.8
2 | 9 | 7 | 91 | 9.1 | 12.6 | 16.1
8 | 8 | 7 | 73 | 5.3* | 8.8* | 12.3*
****Lost a fumble in week 8***

The upside here is volume, as Gesicki essentially serves as the WR2 when Higgins is out, and a good matchup for TEs. The downside is he has yet to score a TD and may not get a chance if the Bengals are playing ahead. 

Regardless, he's a high floor play if you're looking to stream and Higgins is ruled out!",2024-11-01 16:56:01,64,fantasyfootball

"Hi, I am Joey Wright with Footballguys! AMA!",36,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gh95wi/hi_i_am_joey_wright_with_footballguys_ama/,1gh95wi,foreputtscore,"Hey everyone! It’s Joey Wright with [Footballguys](https://www.footballguys.com/) here to answer whatever questions you have! Draft strategy, player rankings, how to get started in the fantasy football industry, favorite movies, whatever you’d like!

My path in the industry started at [Razzball](http://Razzball.com) in 2020 writing their waiver wire column. I also hosted a bi-weekly AMA here during that season. From there, I joined the team at [Front Yard Fantasy](https://www.youtube.com/@FYF), everyone’s favorite daily game show with a fantasy football twist. While there I created the series [Starts, Sits, & Salutations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCikkJujqTAyyo_d4aqRRWMrhY5o-Jclb) where I would go out into nature and give fantasy advice while talking to animals. I joined the team at Footballguys in the winter of 2022 and became their full time Community Ambassador at the beginning of the 2023 season. There I run anything and all things community including contests, expo events, and the Footballguys Bowl, a 1900 person super tournament combining our Footballguys subscribers with some of our favorite Footballguys team members! I am the host of our Sunday Pregame Start and Sit show, Footballguys Sunday Morning Live! You can find it on our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@FootballguysFantasy)!

Outside of the fantasy industry I am married and a father of two beautiful little girls. I have a cat named after Kevin McAllister from Home Alone, but identify as more of a dog person. I am also a former film critic and avid fan of Japanese pro wrestling!

Feel free to follow me on [Twitter/X](https://x.com/thejoeywright) for the latest updates on all things Joey Wright. Anyway, thanks to the [](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/) mods for having me. Like my favorite girl-pop artist of the moment Chappell Roan, I am H-O-T-T-O-G-O so start sending in those questions! 

>Hey All! I see there are some questions still up on the board. I will try my best and hit the rest of them by tonight! Have a safe one everyone!!!",2024-11-01 16:14:17,284,fantasyfootball

[New Concept] Special Teams Flex — Adding Value to Kickers & Defenses,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gh5mr5/new_concept_special_teams_flex_adding_value_to/,1gh5mr5,kidcreative6,"Recently I got an idea I think could make leagues way more interesting: a *Special Teams Flex* spot that would add some value to kickers and defenses (similar to what superflex did for QBs). Very curious to hear this community's thoughts on this

  
Right now, kickers and defenses—even the best ones—don’t hold any real trade value. You can have the #1 defense or kicker, and nobody’s biting. And during bye weeks, managers will just drop top-tier options rather than use a roster spot to keep them, which never happens with other positions. Seeing this conversation a lot this week with Boswell, for example. It’s like these guys are disposable, and that doesn’t add much fun nor does it align with what I see from the position. I consistently see the top scoring teams have great defense and kicker pairings which puts them over the top.

**The Fix: Special Teams Flex!**  
So, picture this: a flex spot just for either a kicker or a defense. Here’s why I think it would work wonders:

1. **Makes Them Trade-Worthy**: With an extra slot for a kicker/defense, there’d be just enough scarcity to make people think twice. Suddenly, that top-tier kicker or defense might be worth trading for, instead of hitting waivers on a whim.
2. **Creates Lineup Diversity**: Think about the lineup possibilities. You could roll out two defenses or two kickers, adding a layer of creativity and letting managers play around with new roster builds.
3. **Adds Challenge on Bye Weeks**: Managers would have to make actual decisions about whether to carry two kickers or defenses during byes, rather than the usual “drop and move on.” It keeps things a bit more competitive and hands-on.

I’d love to know what you all think—would this add some juice to your league? And has anyone ever tried something similar? I know how popular eliminating kickers is as a rule suggestion so please please do not kill me in the comments lol",2024-11-01 13:39:21,42,fantasyfootball

Fantasy Football MVPs of October,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gh22qv/fantasy_football_mvps_of_october/,1gh22qv,Colin_McT,"October is when things really get rolling in fantasy football. We start to get a clearer picture of player values, for better or for worse. Bye weeks come to into play, as well. Players who began the year on PUP, and missed at least four games, are also eligible to return.

Often times, fantasy football managers, *myself included*, get hung up on how poorly a player performed or how they narrowly lost a matchup. The point of this post is to do the opposite. I’m going to name players worth celebrating and bragging about having on our rosters over the last four weeks. People seemed to enjoy a similar discussion back in September. So, let’s jump into the Fantasy MVPs of October (Weeks 5-8).

Let me know if you had drafted, traded for any of these guys or have MVP shoutouts of your own!

What I took into consideration:

• **Availability** - Playing in 3-4 games. This is very important given the long list of injuries. Bye weeks were *not* held against players.

• **Consistency** - No dud performances…unless there’s one “dud” that’s still double-digit fantasy points.

• **Trust** - Whether or not managers realistically started these players throughout the *entirety* of October after how they performed throughout, or at the end of, September

QB: **Lamar Jackson**
- 28.0 fantasy points per game
- That’s up from 23.0 ppg in September
- Two games of 33+ points (4 pt TD leagues)
- No less than 19.9 fantasy points
- 12:1 TD:INT ratio
- Average of 10 rush attempts per game
- No rush TDs, but average of 4.82 fantasy points per game from rushing yards each week

Honorable mention: *Baker Mayfield*

RB: **Joe Mixon**
- RB is *tough* to choose from. So far, 2024 is definitely the best year for the position in awhile.
- Missed a game due to injury, so I’m going against my own rules…but Mixon is worth doing so for.
- Despite his missed game, he only scored 6.1 less total points (77.0) than highest scoring RB, Bijan Robinson (83.1)
- Mixon averaged 25.7 fantasy points per game (3 games)
- That’s^ the 4th highest-scoring player in points per game and highest-scoring *Non-QB* in October
- Three games of 100+ yards rushing
- Averaged 130 all-purpose yards per game
- 5 total touchdowns 

Honorable mention: *D’Andre Swift*

WR: **Ja’Marr Chase**
- 22.9 fantasy points per game. WR1.
- Started the month with 41.3 point performance
- 4 total touchdowns
- At least 5+ receptions and/or 54+ yards in each game
- Less total targets (24) than Tee Higgins (29) from Weeks 5-7 and less in every game played together

Honorable Mention: *Garrett Wilson*

TE: **George Kittle**
- 20.8 fantasy points per game
- Three games of 20+ points
- Only 13 different 20+ point games from TEs
- No other TE had multiple 20+ point games
- 4 total TDs
- 5+ receptions and 58+ yards in every game
- Season-best 128 yards in Week 8

Honorable Mention: *Brock Bowers*",2024-11-01 10:17:08,53,fantasyfootball

The Rookie Report: Week 9 Starts & Sits,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1ggtbdx/the_rookie_report_week_9_starts_sits/,1ggtbdx,xylopolist,"Welcome back to the Rookie Report! Raise your hand if you’re tired of hearing the phrase ‘National Tight Ends’ Day’. I promise I’ll keep mentions of it to a minimum this week, but there’s no question big tight end performances were all the rage last week. 6 of the top-7 tight ends by average draft position this year matched or bested their highest fantasy point total of the year in week 8, but there was plenty of non-TE action to be excited about as well.



We DID get our showdown between Caleb Williams and Jayden Daniels after Daniels was able to battle through a rib injury to be able to play, and the game didn’t disappoint. Caleb struggled for 3 quarters before righting the ship and leading a comeback that should’ve won the game, but Daniels connected on a Hail Mary that won’t be forgotten in DC or Chicago for decades. We also saw great performances by Bo Nix, Marvin Harrison Jr., Ladd McConkey, Tryone Tracy, and Keon Coleman, and hopefully we’ll be treatied to more scintillating rookie showings in week 9. Let’s not waste any more time reminiscing about last week - you’ve got new matchups to win.



A couple of housekeeping notes for the players listed below – All players listed under the same header at the same position are listed in the order that I would play them this week. All usage rates (snap share, target rate, air yardage share, etc.) are from the MB Fantasy Life Utilization Tool from Dwain McFarland, and all references to fantasy points and points allowed rankings are based on half-PPR scoring unless otherwise noted.



Let’s get into week 9…



**Rookies You Already Know You Should Start:**

**QB Jayden Daniels, WAS (Wk. 9: @ NYG):** Daniels surprised me by being active last week. I really thought Dan Quinn was deploying some gamesmanship when he said last Friday that Daniels might play through his rib injury, but he wasn’t lying. Daniels made the start, and thanks to a fortuitous bounce on a Hail Mary, he finished as a top-12 QB for the 6^(th) time in 7 full games played this season. Interestingly enough, the one time he failed was against the Giants in week 2, but I expect a much better showing this time around. Washington wasn’t letting Daniels throw the ball downfield in his first couple of games this year, something he’s done much more regularly in recent weeks, and the Giants have allowed the 6^(th)\-most QB rushing yards per game. Those factors are enough for me to trust Jayden as a solid QB1 once again this week



**WR Malik Nabers, NYG (Wk. 9: vs. Was.):** Nabers certainly would be putting up gaudier numbers if he were getting better QB play, but his production this season is nothing to scoff at. He’s now earned higher than a 30% target share in each of the last 5 games he’s played, and he earned a 50% or higher air yardage share in 4 of those games (42% in the other). He hasn’t finished lower than the PPR WR35 in any game he’s been active for this season. You already know he should be locked into your lineup. He posted a line of 10-127-1 in his first meeting with the Commanders this year, and while their secondary has been playing much better in recent weeks, Benjamin St-Juste is still a very burnable individual matchup for Nabers. Nabers is a top-10 WR play this week.



**WR Brian Thomas Jr., JAX (Wk. 9: @ Phi.):** Thomas left last week’s game early with a chest injury and was in a route on just 49% of the Jaguars’ passing dropbacks…and he still finished the week as a fantasy WR2. There was concern that the injury would keep Thomas out for multiple weeks, but that diagnosis changed quickly and there’s a very real chance BTJ is active this week after logging limited practices on Wednesday and Thursday. If he plays, you should find a way to get him into your lineups. He faces a Philly defense that allows the 10^(th)\-most WR points per game, and the Jags will be playing without Christian Kirk and possibly Gabe Davis as well. Those absences likely mean an even higher target share than normal for Thomas if he’s able to suit up. He’s a solid WR2 play again this week if he’s active. Just keep in mind that the Jaguars play in the late afternoon window, so you’ll need a replacement option who plays at least that late as a backup plan in case the rookie can’t get cleared to play.



**TE Brock Bowers, LV (Wk. 9: @ Cin.):** Bowers posted a ho-hum stat line of 5-58 on 5 targets last week, but on National Tight Ends’ day, that performance was good enough for just a TE18 finish for the week. It’s a little troubling that Bowers earned just a 20% target share with Jakobi Meyers back in the lineup, but don’t let that cause you to waver on starting him this week. The Bengals allow the 7^(th)\-most TE points per game, Bowers is still running a route on more than 80% of the team passing dropbacks, and there should be plenty of passing volume this week with the Raiders a 7.5-point underdog. Bowers should be locked in as a top-10 TE play as usual.



**Borderline Rookies I’d Lean Toward Starting:**

**QB Bo Nix, DEN (Wk. 9: @ Bal.):** Nix put on a passing clinic against the hapless Panthers last Sunday, posting season-highs with 284 passing yards, 3 TD tosses, and a 124.2 passer rating. He also added 6+ fantasy points with his legs for the 6^(th) time this season. The Broncos’ rookie has quietly topped 19 fantasy points in 4 of his last 6 games and 21 points in 3 of his last 4. He’s worked his way up to the QB14 in PPG for the season. He faces the Ravens this week, and while the Ravens’ offense has been a juggernaut, their pass defense has been a sieve. Baltimore has allowed the 3^(rd)\-most QB points per game and has given up more than 30 more passing yards per game than any other team in the league. They’ve allowed 4 of the last 6 QBs they’ve faced to throw for 330+ yards, and 5 of the last 6 to score at least 20 fantasy points. It all adds up to the improving Nix having huge upside this week. I’d treat him as a borderline top-10 QB option in week 9.



**QB Caleb Williams, CHI (Wk. 9: @ Ari.):** Williams’ performance last week in a plus matchup against the Commanders is one we’d like to forget. He did enough to have his team in a position to win before they gave up a stunning Hail Mary completion, but through 3 quarters of that game Caleb had completed just 4 of 14 passes for 36 yards. Maybe the nerves of playing in front of his hometown crowd against fellow top rookie QB Jayden Daniels got to him. Maybe Shane Waldron just called a terrible game. But either way, it was a rough performance prior to the comeback effort in the 4^(th). Caleb gets another favorable matchup this week against the Cardinals. Arizona ranks 29^(th) in FTN’s pass defense DVOA and has allowed the 7^(th)\-most QB points per game, and more importantly, they aren’t likely to pressure Caleb on nearly 40% of his dropbacks like the Commanders did last week. Arizona blitzes at the 2^(nd)\-lowest rate in the league, and generates pressure at the 4^(th)\-lowest rate. That extra time to throw should help Caleb have a much better performance. QB fantasy performances against the Cardinals this season have had some interesting groupings. One QB was held below 7 points against them. 3 QBs scored more than 25 points against them. The other 4 all scored in the narrow range between 14 and 16 fantasy points. QBs vs the Cardinals have typically either put up a middling fantasy score or an excellent one (and that one terrible one). It’s worth mentioning that the Cardinals gave up 25+ to the opposing QB in 2 of the 3 games where they traveled east for 1 PM EST starts. This week’s game is in the late afternoon. I’m not sure if the trend will hold, but somewhere around 16 points for Caleb wouldn’t surprise me. I think he’s a high end QB2 this week.



**RB Tyrone Tracy, NYG (Wk. 9: vs. Was.):** Tracy’s situation bears watching this week as he was diagnosed with a concussion on Monday night and still needs to clear the protocol, but the Giants are optimistic he’ll be able to play, and if they’re right, he should be treated as an RB2 with upside in a favorable matchup against the Commanders. Washington ranks just 24^(th) in run defense DVOA, and has allowed a top-24 fantasy finish to an opposing back in 7 of 8 games this season. It became clear this week that Devin Singletary wasn’t just being eased back in after his injury in week 7, he’s now the backup. The duo had equal involvement in the passing game on Monday night, but Tracy played 60% of the snaps and handled 83% of the rushing attempts. He’s now scored a TD in two of his last 3 games and topped 100 rushing yards in two of the last 4. He’s a great RB2 option as long as he’s able to clear the protocol.



**WR Marvin Harrison, Jr., ARI (Wk. 9: vs. Chi.):** Harrison got back on track in a big way last weekend, finishing with 6-111-1 on 7 targets in a tough matchup with the Dolphins. Harrison accounted for nearly half of Arizona’s air yards and was in a route on 97% of the team’s passing dropbacks. He gets another tough matchup this week against the Bears. Chicago allows the 9^(th)\-fewest WR points per game and ranks 6^(th) in pass defense DVOA, but Marv’s usage and talent gives him weekly WR1 upside. We’ve seen his floor more often than the we have with Nabers or Brian Thomas, so he’s still in the Borderline section for now, especially in a tougher matchup like this, but he’s got the ability to earn his way back up to auto-start status. I’d treat him as a lower-end WR2 this week.



**WR Ladd McConkey, LAC (Wk. 9: @ Cle.):** Like Marvin Harrison Jr., McConkey finished week 8 with 6 catches for 111 yards, but McConkey did so on just 6 targets rather than 7, and he found the end zone twice rather than just once. It was easily Ladd’s best fantasy game of the season, but it was also the 3^(rd) time in the last 4 games that he’s finished as a WR3 or better. The Chargers have been throwing the ball more in recent weeks, and as a result McConkey has been turning the corner in fantasy. Justin Herbert was averaging just 23 pass attempts per game before the team’s week 5 bye, but he’s averaged 35 per game in the 3 games since. This week’s matchup is also a favorable one for Ladd. The Browns allow the 5^(th)\-most WR points per game, and they play man-to-man defense at the highest rate in the league. McConkey averages a whopping 0.92 PPR points per route run against man coverage, and his counterpart this week, Cleveland slot corner Greg Newsome II, has a PFF coverage grade of just 51.2 for the season. McConkey could feast again. He’s a solid WR3 this week.



**WR Xavier Worthy, KC (Wk. 9: vs. TB):** Worthy has been targeted 8+ times twice this season, and both of those happened in the last 2 games since the team lost JuJu Smith-Schuster to injury. I do expect DeAndre Hopkins’ playing time will increase in the coming weeks and eventually eat into Worthy’s targets a bit, but this week’s matchup seems well set up for Worthy’s deep ball ability. The Bucs have allowed the 4^(th)\-most completions of 20+ yards this season, and they’re tied for the 3^(rd)\-most completions of 40+ yards allowed. There’s always going to be an element of risk with Worthy (he’s caught just 51.4% of his targets this year), but he’s finished as a PPR WR3 or better in 3 of the last 4 games, and he’s got some extra upside this week against a Tampa defense that has struggled to limit splash plays in the passing game.



**Borderline Rookies I’d Lean Toward Sitting:**

**QB Drake Maye, NE (Wk. 9: @ Ten.):** Maye left last week’s contest with a concussion, and at this point, it’s still up in the air whether or not he’ll get cleared to play this weekend. If he’s able to start, he’ll be taking on a Tennessee defense that has shown cracks in recent weeks, but still ranks 12^(th) in pass defense DVOA and has allowed the fewest passing yards per game this season. Only 2 of the 7 QBs the Titans have faced reached 200+ passing yards, and one of those was a bizarre outlier game against Malik Willis. The other was against Josh Allen. Maye was impressive in his two starts this year, throwing for over 500 yards and 5 TDs, and rushing for over 50 yards to boot, but betting on another big performance in a tough matchup, coming off a concussion, feels like a risky proposition to me. I’d view Maye as a low-end QB2 this week, but the upside is there for more.



**QB Spencer Rattler, NO (Wk. 9: @ Car.):** Derek Carr should return to the lineup in week 9, relegating Rattler back to the bench. If that doesn’t happen, Rattler could get a start against a Carolina defense that ranks 31^(st) in pass defense DVOA and allows the 5^(th)\-most QB points per game. It would be a scenario where he could be a serviceable QB2 for fantasy lineups, but keep in mind that he’s been pulled for Jake Haener in each of his last 2 starts. In week 8, he was pulled while it was still a competitive game. He’s risky here, even as a QB2, if he gets the starting nod again.



**RB Bucky Irving, TB (Wk. 9: @ KC):** Irving was a PPR weapon in week 8, piling up 7 catches and 84 scrimmage yards as the Bucs played without their top-2 receivers for the first time this year, but the workload split with Rachaad White wasn’t much different than what we’ve been accustomed to this season. There were some positive signs – Bucky out-carried and out-targeted White against Atlanta. It was just the 2^(nd) time this season he’s out-carried White when both were active, and the 1^(st) time he’s out-targeted him, but White still played 10 more snaps and ran 12 more routes than Irving. With that sort of usage, there’s no guarantee that Irving continues to see more opportunities. It does look like the duo has at least relegated Sean Tucker to a distant RB3 role again, and it also looks like the injuries to Mike Evans and Chris Godwin are going to lead to more targets for the running backs going forward. None of that makes Bucky a great play against a Chiefs’ team that allows the fewest running back points per game and ranks 2^(nd) in run defense DVOA. Only Bijan Robinson and Alvin Kamara have reached 12+ PPR points against Kansas City this season. Earning only half of the backfield work against a very difficult matchup, Bucky is just an RB3/flex option this week.



**RB Braelon Allen, NYJ (Wk. 9: vs. Hou.):** Allen had seemingly been fading away from the Jets’ offense since Todd Downing took over play calling a few weeks ago, but he was back with a vengeance in week 8, handling 43% of the team rushing attempts en route to a 12-32-1 rushing performance and a RB31 finish for the week. The issue here is that we don’t know if he’ll continue to play that much going forward, and the Texans are a much tougher matchup for RBs than the Patriots were last week. Houston has allowed the 4^(th)\-fewest RB points per game and rank 4^(th) in run defense DVOA. I can’t recommend starting Braelon in that matchup when the upside case is that he’ll play 35-40% of the offensive snaps.



**RB Jonathan Brooks, CAR (Wk. 9: vs. NO):** Brooks is practicing in full this week and seems poised to finally make his NFL debut. He may be returning at the right time – the Panthers face a New Orleans defense that ranks dead last in run defense DVOA, and Chuba Hubbard is coming off his worst fantasy performance since week 1 and has averaged fewer than 4 yards per carry in each of the last 2 contests. Unfortunately, I still think the Panthers are going to slow play Brooks’ roll out. I expect Chuba to still see the lion’s share of the backfield work with Brooks mixing in with Miles Sanders for backup opportunities. You should definitely be monitoring Brooks’ performance this week if he’s still on your league waiver wire, but I wouldn’t consider starting him this week unless you like to live very dangerously.



**WR Keon Coleman, BUF (Wk. 9: vs. Mia.):** Coleman continues to be an enigma for me. He struggled to break through for much of the first 6 weeks of the season when he averaged 3.3 targets and 33 yards per game. Somehow, the team trading for Amari Cooper has triggered a Coleman breakout where he’s posted lines of 4-125 and 5-70-1 over the last two weeks on 7 targets in each game. It’s easy to say that the addition of Cooper has reduced the defensive attention paid to Coleman, but that doesn’t hold up when you realize that Cooper wasn’t on the field for any of Coleman’s week 7 targets. At any rate, the Cooper addition has clearly been good for Coleman. I wouldn’t fault you if you wanted to get him in lineups again this week, but against a Miami defense that allows the fewest WR points per game, he’s just on the wrong side of the cut line for me. I expect Amari’s playing time to continue to climb, and I think it’ll be tougher for Coleman to hit the big plays that have really carried him in the last couple weeks. Miami has allowed the 7^(th)\-fewest completions of 20+ yards this season, and have allowed just 1 connection of 40+ yards. Four of Coleman’s nine catches in the last 2 weeks have gone for 20+ yards, and 2 of them went for 40+.



**WR Jalen McMillan, TB (Wk. 9: @ KC):** McMillan slotted in as the Bucs’ WR1 last weekend as expected with Chris Godwin done for the year and Mike Evans sidelined for a few weeks. Jalen was in a route on 90% of the team passing dropbacks and earned a 28% air yardage share, but he earned just 15% of the targets as the passing game flowed through the running backs and tight ends. Rachaad White, Bucky Irving, and Cade Otton combined for 50% of the teams’ total targets. McMillan finished the week with 4 catches on 7 targets and 52 scrimmage yards, and that was in a good matchup against Atlanta’s bottom-10 pass defense in a game where the Bucs threw the ball 50 times. Passing volume should be plentiful again as an 8.5-point underdog against KC, but the Chiefs allow just the 7^(th)\-fewest WR points per game and rank 8^(th) in pass defense DVOA. I’d view McMillan as more of a risky WR4 than a WR3 option this week.



**WR Rome Odunze, CHI (Wk. 9: @ Ari.):** Odunze faces a favorable matchup this week as the Cardinals allow the 9^(th)\-most WR points per game, and rank 29^(th) in pass defense DVOA. He also saw promising usage last week, earning a 30% target share and 41% air yardage share, but those positive indicators aren’t enough for me to overlook the overall lack of production from Odunze this season. He’s finished as a PPR WR3 or better just once this year. The usage last week points to good things to come for Odunze in weeks where the Bears have passing success, and they very much should have that success against the Cardinals this week, but it’s hard to recommend Odunze as anything more than an upside WR4/5 option.



**WR Jalen Coker, CAR (Wk. 9: vs. NO):** Coker posted his best fantasy game of the season last week (4-78-1 on 6 targets) as Bryce Young surprisingly managed to put up a respectable passing performance against the stingy Broncos’ defense. Now the Panthers have traded away Diontae Johnson and opened up more playing time for the other receivers. Everything should be looking up for Coker going forward, right? Not so fast, my friends. Adam Thielen could be on the cusp of returning, and if he does, there’s a real risk that Coker loses a LOT of playing time. Thielen’s primary role with the Panthers has been slot receiver. He’s spent over 65% of his snaps with Carolina lined up in the slot while Coker has lined up there on 71.7% of his snaps this season. You’d hope the Panthers would find a way to work around Thielen’s return and keep their exciting rookie on the field, but Xavier Legette, Jonathan Mingo, and David Moore are all more experienced on the perimeter and are likely to cut drastically into Coker’s snaps if Thielen is indeed back this week. If Thielen sits again, or you’re confident in Coker not losing snaps this week, he’s an intriguing WR3/flex option against a New Orleans defense that allows the 7^(th)\-most WR points per game. There’s enough risk here for me that I’d recommend against plugging him in.



**WR Devaughn Vele, DEN (Wk. 9: @ Bal.):** Vele gets to face off with a Baltimore defense that allows the 2^(nd)\-most WR points per game, but the Ravens play man coverage at the 11^(th)\-highest rate in the league, and all of Vele’s production this year has come vs zone coverage. Vele has just 1 catch for 3 yards vs man coverage all season long, and his playing time has been decreasing since he returned to action a few weeks ago. His route participation rate has gone from 71% in week 6, to 58% in week 7, to 39% in week 8. His dwindling playing time, and his struggles against man coverage make this a bad week to trust Vele to find his way to a respectable PPR score.



**TE Ja’Tavion Sanders, CAR (Wk. 9: vs. NO):** Sanders’ positive momentum toward the TE1 ranks was derailed last week by the returns of Tommy Tremble and Bryce Young to the lineup. Sanders has undoubtedly been more successful than Tremble as a receiver this season, but the coaching staff has consistently treated Tremble as their top TE when healthy. Tremble was in a route on 51% of the Panthers’ team passing dropbacks last weekend compared to 44% for Sanders. Sanders has also struggled to put up any kind of production this year when Bryce Young is under center. He has below a 5% target share from Bryce and has totaled just 4-19 on 4 targets in Young’s 3 starts this season. The Saints are a middling TE defense, allowing the 15^(th)\-fewest TE points per game, but you just can’t count on production here with Bryce at QB.



**TE Theo Johnson, NYG (Wk. 9: vs. Was.):** Johnson posted a respectable 3-35 line on 4 targets in week 8. It was his best fantasy performance of any game Malik Nabers has been active for this season. In fact, prior to week 8, Johnson had a combined total of just 3 catches for 37 yards on 8 targets in the other 5 game games Nabers played in this year. While it’s a promising sign to see Theo produce with Nabers in the lineup, it’s worth noting that 3 of the targets came in the 4^(th) quarter while the Giants were mounting a comeback effort, and he put up 2 catches for 28 yards on the game’s final drive. It’s possible the Giants find themselves in similar situations this week, but against a Washington defense that allows the 9^(th)\-fewest TE points per game, I’m not going to bet on a repeat performance for Johnson here. With increased tight end production league-wide in recent weeks, even if he does post another 6–8-point performance, it’s just not that useful from your starting tight end in 12-team leagues right now.



**Rookies You Already Know You Should Sit:**

**RB Ray Davis, BUF (Wk. 9: vs. Mia.):** Davis gets a good matchup this week – Miami ranks 28^(th) in run defense DVOA and allows the 9^(th)\-most RB points per game, but he’s played 25% or more of the snaps with James Cook active just once all year. The Bills have made a point to get him 5-8 touches per game (he carried 6 times for 29 yards last weekend), but he basically has to get in the end zone to return value on that kind of workload. That’s a risky bet to make when he’s seen just 1 carry inside the 5-yard line all season.



**RB Blake Corum, LAR (Wk. 9: @ Sea.):** Corum was on the field for just 11% of the snaps in the Rams’ upset win over the Vikings last week, finishing with just 18 yards on 5 touches. He’s the clear RB2 in this backfield, but this backfield remains a one-man show.



**RB Kimani Vidal, LAC (Wk. 9 : @ Cle.):** Vidal’s week 8 usage was less than optimal for his outlook going forward. The Chargers played mostly from ahead, but Vidal played his lowest snap share in 3 weeks and ceded more receiving routes to JK Dobbins than usual, which is especially alarming since the Chargers have been throwing the ball more in recent weeks. Vidal finished the game with 6 carries for 16 yards and zero targets. I expected him to see an increase in playing time with the Chargers comfortable favorites, and instead, his usage went in the other direction. I wouldn’t recommend considering him against Cleveland, who allows the 6^(th)\-fewest RB points per game.



**RB Jaylen Wright, MIA (Wk. 9: @ Buf.):** Wright has been below a 10% snap share in each of the last two games with Raheem Mostert and De’Von Achane both healthy. He’s been effective when he gets carries, but the carries have been sparse, and there’s no reason to expect that to change this week, barring an injury ahead of him.



**RB Trey Benson, ARI (Wk. 9 : vs. Chi.):** Benson has played just 8 snaps in the last two weeks, totaling 1 carry and zero targets. He’s not on the fantasy radar right now.



**RB Carson Steele, KC (Wk. 9: vs. TB):** After 3 straight weeks of playing exactly a 19% snap share, Steele’s playing time finally changed in week 8 - it dropped to 10%. He’s a distant 3^(rd) in the Kansas City backfield, scoring fewer than 5 total PPR points over the last 4 games, and at some point, Isiah Pacheco is going to return as well.



**RB Audric Estime, DEN (Wk. 9: @ Bal.):** I was optimistic that Estime would see at least a handful of garbage time touches last weekend against the Panthers, but Sean Payton couldn’t let me have that. The Broncos ran 19 offensive plays in the 2^(nd) half with a 3-touchdown lead last Sunday, and Estime logged just one touch in that span. Jaleel McLaughlin and Javonte Williams combined for 12 opportunities in those 19 plays as Payton kept his starters in. If Estime can’t get opportunities in blowout wins, it’s hard to envision a path to getting them this week, when the Broncos are 9.5-point underdogs.



**RB Marshawn Lloyd, GB (Wk. 9: vs. Det.):** At some point Lloyd is going to return from IR. And when that happens, he’ll have work to do before he can move ahead of Chris Brooks or Emmanuel Wilson on the depth chart here. If Lloyd’s active this week, anything more than a few snaps would be a surprise, and the Lions allow the 3^(rd)\-fewest RB points per game.



**RB Will Shipley, PHI (Wk. 9: vs. Jax.):** Shipley handled the first 10 carries of his career in the last two games, and nearly scored his first career TD last Sunday had it not been called back on a hold, but it doesn’t mean you need to have Shipley on your radar. All 10 of his carries came in garbage time with the Eagles leading by 17points in the 4^(th) quarter.



**WR Ja’Lynn Polk, NE (Wk. 9 : @ Ten.):** Polk should be able to return from a week 7 concussion this week, but there’s no guarantee that he’ll play a significant number of snaps or that he’ll have Drake Maye throwing him the football as Maye recovers from a concussion of his own. Polk’s playing time was already headed in the wrong direction before he suffered the injury, with Kayshon Boutte, Demario Douglas, and Kendrick Bourne serving as the team’s top 3 wide receivers. If Maye is out, starting Polk shouldn’t even be a thought in your head as potentially the WR4 against a Tennessee defense that allows the 6^(th)\-fewest WR points per game. Jacoby Brissett hasn’t thrown for more than 168 yards in a game this year. If Maye is able to get cleared, it adds a little bit of upside to Polk, but the matchup and the playing time will still be problems.



**WR Jordan Whittington, LAR (Wk. 9: @ Sea.):** I was hopeful for Whittington for the rest of the season last week when Cooper Kupp trade rumors were swirling. Now that Sean McVay has put those trade rumors to bed and Kupp and Puka Nacua are back in the lineup, you can probably drop Whittington in most standard redraft leagues. Kupp and Nacua will be locked into full-time roles while healthy, and that’ll leave Whittington to split WR3 work with Demarcus Robinson and Tutu Atwell.



**WR Mason Tipton, NO (Wk. 9: @ Car.):** Bub Means will likely miss a few weeks with a high ankle sprain, and Derek Carr is expected to return this week, but I’m not sure those things move the needle enough for Tipton to be a real consideration for lineups. Tipton has exceeded 15 receiving yards just once this season, and it happened in a contest where the Saints were playing without Chris Olave and threw nearly 40 times in a blowout loss. The Saints are favored by 7.5 points this week, so I’d expect the passing volume to be significantly lower (they threw 24 times in their blowout win over Carolina in week 1), and much of that volume will run through Chris Olave and Alvin Kamara. If you’re looking for a Saints’ sleeper in this matchup, I’d much rather target Taysom Hill or Jamaal Williams in the run game than Tipton in the passing game.



**WR Luke McCaffrey, WAS (Wk. 9: @ NYG):** McCaffrey nearly scored his first touchdown last Sunday, but was shoved out of bounds in the end zone before he could get his feet down for the score. It was the closest thing he had to a highlight as he finished the day with 1 catch for 8 yards on 2 targets. He logged his lowest route participation rate of the season and continued to split the WR3 snaps with Olamide Zaccheaus and Dyami Brown.



**WR Jermaine Burton, CIN (Wk. 9 : vs. LV):** Tee Higgins was a surprising inactive last week after suffering a late-week quad injury, but the injury forced Burton into extended action for the first time since week 2. He set new season-highs in route participation rate (43%) and targets (3), and he hauled in a 41-yard catch. I’d bet against a repeat this week though. The Bengals are optimistic Higgins will be back for week 9, and Burton’s best path to fantasy usefulness is the deep ball. The Raiders haven’t allowed a completion of 40+ yards all season long.



**WR Malik Washington, MIA (Wk. 9: @ Buf.):** With Tua back under center in week 8, Washington’s route participation rate was back down to 30%, and Tua barely even looked his way in the game, let alone throw to him. It was a positive sign that Washington still ran more routes than Odell Beckham Jr., but I doubt we see much fantasy relevance from the rookie this year unless the Dolphins fall fully out of playoff contention and try to get the young guys some opportunities.



**TE Erick All, CIN (Wk. 9: vs. LV):** All’s most productive weeks this season were in September when Tee Higgins was sidelined and then working his way back into form. Erick wasn’t playing massive snap shares back then, but he was being targeted when he was on the field. Unfortunately, that high target rate for All didn’t return last weekend with Higgins sidelined again. The rookie was in a route on 38% of the team’s passing dropbacks, but he was targeted just twice. The 2-32 line he finished with is similar to the type of production he was putting up in the first few weeks of the season, but 5-7 PPR points from a tight end just isn’t as useful in lineups anymore as tight end production has increased league wide. Bringing up National Tight Ends’ day was popular last weekend, and tight end scores in week 8 were the best we’ve seen all season, but it was the 3^(rd) time in the last 4 weeks that at least 16 tight ends scored 10+ PPR points.



**TE Cade Stover, HOU (Wk. 9: @ NYJ):** Stover has seen a small uptick in his playing time and usage in recent weeks as the Texans have played without Nico Collins and now Stefon Diggs. He set new season-highs in target share and PPR points last Sunday, but he totaled just 2 catches for 19 yards on 3 targets. That sort of usage probably declines when Nico Collins returns, and this week’s opponent, the Jets, allow the 8^(th)\-fewest TE points per game.



**TE Ben Sinnott, WAS (Wk. 9: @ NYG):** Sinnott scored his first NFL touchdown in week 7 garbage time with Marcus Mariota in at QB, but in week 8 he was back to running a handful of target-less route. He’s still not an option in fantasy leagues.



**Deep League Sleepers and Stashes:**

**WR Xavier Legette, CAR (Wk. 9: vs. NO):** Legette is probably a bit too established to list here in the ‘Sleepers’ section of the column, but be honest…were you giving serious consideration to starting him this week with Bryce Young under center again and Adam Thielen likely returning? My guess is no, but I think you should. With Diontae Johnson gone, Legette is now the team’s top perimeter target, and the Saints, who already allow the 7^(th)\-most WR points per game, are likely going to be playing without their top 2 perimeter cornerbacks, Marshon Lattimore and Paulson Adebo. The Saints play man-to-man coverage at the 8^(th)\-highest rate in the league per PFF, and Legette’s 0.61 fantasy points per route run vs man coverage is far and away the best mark among the Panthers’ receivers. There’s still a lot of uncertainty here with Thielen returning, and I know we’re not ready to trust Bryce just yet, but Young was much better last week than he was prior to his benching, and I think Legette will be the biggest beneficiary if Young keeps it up this week. I’d treat him as a WR4 option and would prefer Legette over any other Carolina WR.



**WR Troy Franklin, DEN (Wk. 9: @ Bal.):** Like Devaughn Vele, Franklin saw his playing time go in the wrong direction last week as the Broncos heavily utilized their tight ends in the passing game. Unlike Vele, Franklin has not struggled against man-to-man coverage this season. The Ravens play man-to-man at the 11^(th)\-highest rate in the league, and Franklin has averaged 0.73 fantasy points per route run (top-10 in the league) and earned a whopping 45.5% target rate when facing man coverage. If he’s on the field, and the other team is playing man-to-man, Bo Nix throws in his direction nearly half the time, which means he has big upside against a Ravens’ defense that allows the 2^(nd)\-most WR points per game. This can certainly backfire if Franklin is in a route on less than 40% of the dropbacks again like he was last week, but there aren’t many guys who are rostered in as few leagues as Franklin is (he’s 12% rostered in redraft leagues on Sleeper) that have the kind of upside he does this week. If you’re scrounging the wire for a deep plug-and-play option, Franklin is your guy.



**WR Adonai Mitchell, IND (Wk. 9: @ Min.):** I’m not sure I can tell you with a straight face to start Mitchell this week. After all, he’s posted more than 5 PPR points just once this season, but the return of Joe Flacco to the starting lineup does make him more intriguing as a stash. I keep repeating it every week – Mitchell earns targets at a high rate when he’s on the field. He’s been targeted on at least 30% of his routes run in 6 straight games. The problem is that he’s not on the field enough, and that those targets aren’t connecting often enough. According to Dwain McFarland’s (MB Fantasy Life) Utilization Tool, just 53% of Mitchell’s targets this season have been catchable. That’s largely due to Anthony Richardson’s abysmal 55.6% on-target rate. Joe Flacco is at 71.2% on the year, and Flacco was at QB for the one game where Mitchell scored more than 5 points. With Alec Pierce making less of an impact in recent weeks, there may finally be an opening for Mitchell to start logging route participation rates above 30%, and once that happens, we’re not going to be too far off from Adonai becoming a viable fantasy WR. This week’s opponent, the Vikings, do allow the most WR points per game, so there’s some YOLO appeal for the deepest of leagues this week, but I mostly mention Mitchell as a stash for the back half of the season.



That’s all I’ve got for this week. Hopefully it helps you sort through your lineup decisions and find your way to a win this weekend. Feel free to hit me up on Twitter/X (@Shawn\_Foss) if you have any questions or want to yell at me about anything written above, and always make sure to apply what’s written in the context of your own league rules and roster. Keep a close eye on the injury report throughout the week if you have any guys who are questionable and do a final pre-game check to make sure you don’t start any inactive players. As always: Good luck, trust your gut and have fun. It’s just a game.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

FGB's Week 9 Flex Projections,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1ggm468/fgbs_week_9_flex_projections/,1ggm468,FantasyGoldenBoy,"# Week 8 Recap

Mean Absolute Error(MAE) is the average gap, positive or negative, between my projections and the final score of each player.  Decision Success Rate(DSR) is how often a decision made based on these projections, between any two players, would be correct.

**Mean Absolute Error**

* Overall = 4.6
* Flex Range(36-100) = 4.9
* RB = 4.1
* WR = 4.7
* TE = 4.7

**Decision Success Rate**

* Top 175 = 74.45%
* Flex Range = 73.39%

Week 8 was a great bounce back after the nightmare week 7.   MAE’s all below 5 with a 4.1 for RBs.  DSR both finished in the mid 70s which is about the highest I’ve seen.  Despite the solid week there were still some big misses, Ceedee Lamb being the biggest, blowing out my 13.9 projection by 19.2 pts finishing at 33.1.  On the other end my biggest over projection was Amari Cooper, I expected an increased role and instead he gave us .8 fantasy points finishing 9 below my projection of 9.8.

# Week 9 Half PPR Projections

Projections focused on predicting touchdowns using high value plays adjusted for match-ups, weather, game script and implied team totals.

|Position|High Value Plays|Weather|Spread|Implied Team Total|Matchup|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Wide Receiver|1st Read Targets inside the 20 and 1st Read Targets with 20+ AY|High Wind effects performance adjusted for each receivers individual aDOT|Adjusts usage for expected blowouts|Adjusts touchdown chance|CB/WR Matchup rating and Coverage Grades from ([www.fantasypoints.com](http://www.fantasypoints.com))|
|Running Back|Designed Carries inside the 20 and Routes run inside the 20|NA|Adjusts usage for expected blowouts|Adjusts touchdown chance|OL/DL grade, adjusted rec pts allowed to backfield and adjusted neutral game script YPC|
|Tight End|1st Read targets inside the 20|NA|Adjusts usage for expected blowouts|Adjusts touchdown chance|Adjusted pts allowed to Wide/Slot/Inline|

**Weather** : A few games to monitor but nothing extreme.  DET vs GB and TB vs KC look like a good chance of some rain and wind.

**Injuries** : All injuries are based off of projected lineups and injury reports, many of the Questionables will be projected here until Friday practice reports, any non projected players either have flagged phrases like ""not expected to play"" in their injury report or are not in expected lineups.  I do not have inside information, I go off of Rotogrinders projected lineups and ESPN injury reports.

My [website](http://www.fantasygoldenboy.com) has deeper rankings, positional rankings and Full PPR/Standard as well as a Range Plot view that illustrates upside/downside based on TD% and explosive plays vs explosive plays allowed.   Please feel free to ask any questions/leave criticisms about roster decisions or the projections themselves, good luck!

5. Jahmyr Gibbs **(18)**

* Kareem Hunt **(15.5)**
* David Montgomery **(15.2)**
* D'Andre Swift **(14.3)**
* Aaron Jones **(14.3)**
* Breece Hall **(14.1)**

I personally think the one most likely to fall out of the top 10 is Ken Walker. He's playing on one of the most pass heavy offenses, and isn't getting a ton of volume or all of the goal line work. He has been getting more work in the passing game and he's a home run hitter but the volume is a little concerning to me.

The person I think will replace him is De'Von Achane who would be on the list if Tua started every game, but outside of that Breece Hall has a great chance. The vibes are terrible in NY at the moment but he's their best offensive player and the more banged up Rodgers gets, the more check downs to Breece will stay a part of the gameplan.",2024-10-31 18:39:51,209,fantasyfootball

Diontae Johnson's Projected Role in the Ravens Offense,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1ggjtmh/diontae_johnsons_projected_role_in_the_ravens/,1ggjtmh,Bauklotze,"* Derrick Henry Run 1st Offense, lots of 12 Personnel - Likely in the slot. This isn't likely to change.
* Bateman (88%) and Flowers (96%) route participation is very high on the year (When they are on the field they run routes, they are **NOT** blocking)
* Agholor (43%) and Wallace (7%) route participation is very low on the year. This means they are **BLOCKING** for Henry rushing plays.
* Diontae Johnson is not known to give any effort in run blocking


**My Projection as a Diontae owner:**

* Agholor remains in the lineup for blocking purposes (Same role)

* Bateman and Diontae compete for snaps at X receiver PASSING plays. Bateman's ~4 targets per game is likely the new floor for Diontae Johnson assuming Diontae is a replacement for Bateman since he's a better X receiver.

* Diontae was brought in because they were one receiver injury away from starting Agholor at WR2. He will be volatile, he does not replace Zay Flowers role at all in the offense, he is either replacing or competing with Bateman.

* Diontae still has Red Zone upside, he is bigger than Zay and more reliable at the catch than Agholor and Bateman.

* If you are expecting high volume from Diontae I would try and trade now before it's too late. Diontae might take a few weeks to acclimate to offense and by then the value will tank. I would like to shop him but the market looks bleak.",2024-10-31 17:19:11,61,fantasyfootball

Ranking high volume low efficiency RBs ROS? ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1ggje66/ranking_high_volume_low_efficiency_rbs_ros/,1ggje66,LumpySpaceGunter,"There's a tier of RBs who aren't lighting the world on fire but get 15-20 touches a week. This includes guys like JK Dobbins, Brian Robinson, Najee Harris, D'Andre Swift, Rhamondre Stevenson, and Tony Pollard. While these guys have all had big plays/games/stretches, they typically live off volume more than they do efficiency and explosiveness. 

Robinson and Dobbins seem like the best of the tier going forward since they're on better offenses (Chargers not so much, but they have Herbert at least), but Robinson is banged up and Dobbins hasn't had an explosive play in weeks. Dobbins also has a tough stretch of games coming up. 

Najee and Swift seem like the next best because they're on reliable offenses that are figuring things out (QB change + a rookie QB figuring things out). Najee has a brutal schedule though.

Pollard and Rhamondre seem like the third best because they're not on very good teams on top of having to deal with QB injuries. 

Any thoughts? Anyone you see falling off a cliff vs primed for a ROS break out? Or even just continuing as they have been? ",2024-10-31 17:00:25,42,fantasyfootball
This feels like a Taysom Hill week ,261,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1ggjdd7/this_feels_like_a_taysom_hill_week/,1ggjdd7,themeattrain,"This week has the feel of a Taysom Hill blow-up 

1) Carr is coming back from injury and has been on a ""pitch count"" at practice 

2) Saints backup situation is a mess. Haener moved to backup, Rattler benched. Both have been terrible 

3) Saints over/under on team points is 26.5. Vegas sees touchdowns being scored 

4) Carolina is dead last in rushing defense and 28th in passing.

Mine is Alvin Kamara.

2021 He had 30+ pt 10 catch game vs the Seahawks (I remember this game too well bc I'm a Hawks fan)

2022 He dropped 40+ on me on a year where he was fairly mid

2023 I decided to draft him and I ended up trading him early on only for him to finish as a top RB

2024 Week 2 he dunked me again for another 40+ pt week

I have traumatic flashbacks of those checkdown passes to Kamara.",2024-10-31 16:48:24,129,fantasyfootball

What has fantasy football meant to you?,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1ggfcqn/what_has_fantasy_football_meant_to_you/,1ggfcqn,MrBearded1,"Two years ago, I got roped into a fantasy football league with a group of dads. Having never really watched football, I did not understand the draw of the sport or any professional sport really. Immediately, the numbers jumped out at me and finally I had some context for football. 

Ever since, I’ve been part of a handful of free leagues and always enjoy listening to my gut and comparing it to the experts. 

I use football related analogies teaching my business classes and in conversations frequently. 

I’ve connected with distant friends where having a league has helped us connect and even rehash old business ideas. 

I’m in a couples league this year where my wife, who picked up D’Andre Swift three weeks in after I dropped him (thanks sub for all the Swift criticism in week 3), is crushing it. 

So, I’m surprised at what I’ve gotten out of fantasy football so far. I’ve enjoyed the fantasy Focus podcast - it reminds me of our goofball conversations in an earlier season when I’d work in a stuffed closet of an audit room. 

And I’ve enjoyed you guys - you guys are hilarious. Really fun to see this collective community effort and all the jokes everyone makes each week.

So, what has fantasy football meant to you?",2024-10-31 14:06:27,143,fantasyfootball
"Stat Correction Alert (week 8): Caleb Williams +6 rushing yards, WAS D/ST +1 sack.",211,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1ggf6y6/stat_correction_alert_week_8_caleb_williams_6/,1ggf6y6,oliver_babish,"As flagged by u/flockavelli8 and confirmed by the NFL [here](https://fantasy.nfl.com/research/statcorrections?position=O&sort=pts&statCategory=stats&statSeason=2024&statType=weekStats&statWeek=8), the NFL has officially added a sack by the WAS D/ST and therefore the yards Williams lost on that play no longer count as negative rushing yardage.

~~I cannot confirm which play it was~~. 

As u/Consistent_Vast3445 notes, this was on a busted screen pass where Williams clearly pump-fakes once, and WAS HC Dan Quinn petitioned the league to review the play to give his team a credited sack. [Video here.](https://x.com/NickiJhabvala/status/1851666353159057793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1851666353159057793%7Ctwgr%5Ed306af7c7372baf582baabf051e98f9bb97502ef%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.windycitygridiron.com%2F2024%2F10%2F30%2F24283041%2Fchicago-bears-sackwatch-2024-week-8-vs-washington-commanders-caleb-williams-kiran-matt-pryor)  Per [NFL's Guide for Statisticians (bookmark this!)](https://www.nflgsis.com/gsis/documentation/stadiumguides/guide_for_statisticians.pdf):

>When the quarterback or a teammate makes an apparent attempt to pass at any time before he or a teammate is tackled, steps out of bounds, or fumbles behind or at the statistical line of scrimmage, the play is scored as a sack and any yards lost attempting to pass. (Should he advance the ball across the statistical line of scrimmage, it is a rushing play.) ...

>When a quarterback rolls out, or a player other than the quarterback handles the ball on an option play, and with the ball in his throwing hand looks directly at an eligible receiver running a route, before being tackled or stepping out of bounds behind or at the statistical line of scrimmage, it shall be scored as a sack and any yards lost attempting to pass. If the player tucks the ball away without looking at a receiver, or lifts his arm as if to throw on an apparent designed rushing play (i.e., receivers blocking downfield or not looking back) in order to deceive the defense, the play shall be considered a rushing play.  ...

>The individual passer shall not be charged with an attempted forward pass, or yardage lost, when the play is scored as a sack. However, the yardage lost on such plays MUST be deducted from his team’s gross passing yardage to reflect net yards gained passing.",2024-10-31 13:59:28,77,fantasyfootball
Houston Texans vs New York Jets - Not So Brief Armchair Analysis ,436,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1ggf1rj/houston_texans_vs_new_york_jets_not_so_brief/,1ggf1rj,1standFantasyPodcast,"Well we are now over halfway through the entire Fantasy season. How are you all feeling? I have a few teams where I’m a lock to make the playoffs. Then there’s a few….well that aren’t looking so hot. But that’s Fantasy right? Anyways, hopefully you guys enjoy this breakdown and let’s hope we get an exciting TNF game. 

Houston Texans (+2.5 - Implied Point Total = 20) vs. New York Jets (-2.5 - Implied Point Total = 22.5) - Started at +1.5 for Texans. Money has been placed on the Jets over the past 24 hours. 
42.5 total point over/under 

CJ Stroud
QB #15 on the year - 15.29 fantasy points per game 
223.5 passing yards over/under (-113)/1.5 passing TDs over/under (+172)/8.5 rushing yards over/under (-128)

CJ Stroud has definitely taken a step back from last year, that much is obvious. Maybe we were too high on him going into this season or maybe the changes in the offense created a learning curve over the first few weeks. Then, Nico Collins got hurt and last week Stefon Diggs tore his ACL. It could be the dreaded 2nd year step back for QBs that often happen as well which isn’t an indictment of his talent. Or is it possible that we are overreacting to a slight decrease in production but for obvious reasons? 

Through 8 weeks, Stroud is averaging 243.5 passing yards (305.25 yards at home vs. 181.75 yards on the road) on 33.25 attempts with 1.38TDs and .5INTs per game while completing 67% of his passes. Let’s compare that to last year, where he was averaging 283.75 passing yards through the first 8 weeks on 34.88 pass attempts with 1.75TDs and .13INTs per game, completing 63% of his passes. Ultimately, CJ has not been as good as he was last year but it hasn’t been as bad as we have made it out to be. The biggest difference is the TD discrepancy, as he had 14 TDs last season at this time but has 11 this season (again not the biggest difference). I think a large majority of his statistical decline has been due to Joe Mixon’s addition. He has been stellar (see below) which has allowed the Texans to easily win games on the ground instead of using a 4 quarter air attack. Now it can be argued that when Joe Mixon was injured CJ’s stats should have improved, which they really didn’t. However, I would say that defenses were not as worried about the run with Cam Akers so instead they dropped back more into coverage to stop the pass. A real chicken or the egg debate. 

Overall, Stroud is the QB #15 on the year averaging 15.29 fantasy points per game. He will be facing the 2nd best defense in passing yards allowed this week in the Jets. With Nico and Diggs out, I would imagine that CJ will have a harder time passing the ball than usual. Vegas agrees, as they have set his passing line at 223.5 yards over/under and 1.5 passing TDs over/under (+172 odds for over). I do think this game is going to be a slow paced matchup between the two star RBs leaving the QBs to pick up the scraps for fantasy production this week.

*CJ Stroud has averaged 91 passing yards on 23 attempts and 10 completions with 0TDs and 0INTs in one career game vs the Jets*

Projection: 20/32 200 yards 1TD 1INT/6 attempts 17 yards 

Joe Mixon
RB #13 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 20.96 fantasy points per game (5 played)
81.5 rushing yards over/under (-113)/-135 anytime TD Scorer odds (highest in game)

Mixon has been elite this season. His age has not slowed him down yet and the only thing that has is an illegal hip drop tackle which forced him to miss 3 games. When he has been on the field, the production has followed. Last season, by Week 9, Mixon was averaging 61.25 rushing yards on 15.75 attempts with .38TDs per game. He was also averaging 19.75 receiving yards on 3.75 targets and 3 receptions with 0TDs per game as well. 

Compare that to Mixon’s mid-season averages this year, where he is rushing for 100.6 yards (63.5 yards at home vs. 125.33 yards on the road) on 20.4 attempts with 1TD per game (5 games played). He is also seeing more work in the receiving game averaging 23 receiving yards (28.5 yards at home vs. 19.33 yards on the road) on 4 targets and 2.8 receptions with .2TDs per game. Even with 3 missed games this season, Mixon is the RB #13 in Half PPR Scoring, averaging 20.96 fantasy points per game played (compared to last year where he averaged 11.85 fantasy points per game in the first 8 games of the season)! He would be RB #2 on the year in terms of ppg average. 

It definitely helps when you are able to play with as many offensive weapons as Mixon has this season even though his O-Line ranks 22nd in the league according to PFF. Mixon has just been on another level and is not showing any signs of slowing down. However, with the loss of Diggs and Nico still out, he might be facing stacked boxes moving forward which would affect his 2.7 yards after contact per attempt average so far this season (ranks 11th for qualified RBs with over 30 attempts this season). 

Going into this week, Mixon will be facing the 17th ranked defense this season in terms of rushing yards allowed (they give up 125.6 yards per game). Vegas and I disagree on this one as they have set his rushing line at 81.5 yards (19.1 yards below his season average) but have given him -135 odds to score an anytime TD which is the highest in the game. I personally think with the loss of the WR options for the Texans and how well Mixon has been playing, they will feed him the ball and work the clock to keep the game close. 

*Mixon has averaged 33.7 rushing yards on 15 attempts with .7TDs and 32.7 receiving yards on 5.3 targets and 3.7 receptions with .3TDs per game in three career games vs. the Jets*

Projection: 23 attempts 110 yards 1TD/4 targets 3 receptions 27 yards 

Tank Dell
WR #58 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 7.12 fantasy points per game (7 played)
56.5 receiving yards over/under (-113)/4.5 receptions over/under (-114)/+185 anytime TD scorer odds (4th highest in the game)

Man, this one hurts. I was so high on Tank Dell last season and it paid off big time. Coming into this season I was one of the people in the “Dell will be the WR1 on the Texans” camp. Unfortunately, that has not worked out so far and most likely won’t pan out this season (though he is the pseudo WR1 with the injuries now so…). I do still believe Tank Dell is an above average NFL WR and his connection with CJ Stroud was unmatched last year. Maybe they had a falling out? Maybe Dell’s injury is taking longer for him to get back to his old self? Maybe he was really the 3rd best WR on the team in terms of skill when all three were healthy? Whatever the reason, Tank has been having a rough season so far.

Through 7 games played, Dell is averaging a meager 32.71 receiving yards (23.33 yards at home vs. 39.75 yards on the road) on 5.42 targets and 3.42 receptions with .29TDs per game (compared to last season when he was averaged 63.75 receiving yards on 7.13 targets and 4.25 receptions with .63TDs per game). Some of the regression is due to Diggs taking on the role of the WR2 leaving less opportunities for Dell. I also do believe that the first few weeks of the season Dell was not fully back to himself and we (the fantasy community) saw his one pre-season TD and piled onto the hype train. With the numbers he has put up so far this season, he is the WR #58 on the year in Half PPR Scoring averaging 7.12 fantasy points per game played. Definitely not what we were hoping for where we took him in redrafts this season but there is still hope. 

Moving forward, with Diggs out and Collins coming back in a few weeks, I expect Dell to bounce back in the second half of the season. Vegas thinks this might be the start as they have set his receiving line at 56.5 yards (23.79 yards more than his season average) with a 4.5 reception over/under (-114 over) which is 1.08 receptions more than his season average. They have also given him +185 odds to score an anytime TD which is the 4th highest in the game and 2nd highest for a WR. I think this will be a great game for Dell as there is really no one else to throw to beyond an aging Schultz and a few unproven WRs. 

*Tank Dell has never played against the Jets in his career*

Projection: 12 targets 6 receptions 89 yards 1TD

Dalton Schultz 
TE #25 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 4.23 fantasy points per game 
40.5 receiving yards over/under (-113)/4.5 receptions over/under (+126)/+360 anytime TD scorer odds (6th highest in the game)

Going into this season I figured Schultz would be a consistent staple in the offense especially after they aired it out so much last year with a rookie QB. Then Joe Mixon was added along with Stefon Diggs. Then CJ Stroud took a step back and his efficiency was not nearly what it was last year. Yes, Schultz got paid but he was ultimately put in a position where he was only there for emergencies. Well, the Texans have an emergency and Schutlz is here to help out. 

Through the first 8 weeks, Schultz is averaging 27.88 receiving yards (35.25 yards at home vs. 20.5 yards on the road) on 4.75 targets and 2.88 receptions with 0TDs. I expect these numbers to change moving forward as Diggs is out of the year and Nico Collins is dealing with a hamstring injury that put him on the IR immediately. This offense could be the Dalton/Dell show for the foreseeable future. Based on his numbers this season, he is the TE #25 on the year in Half PPR Scoring where he averages 4.23 fantasy points per game. I would be shocked if this is the finish at the end of the year in both TE rankings and fantasy points per game. We saw a glimpse of it last week where Schutlz received 6 targets (2nd highest of the season) and 4 receptions for 52 yards (most receiving yards in the season). There should be more consistency moving forward.

Vegas agrees as they have set his receiving line at 40.5 yards (12.62 yards more than his season average) with 4.5 total receptions (+126 over). They have also given him +360 anytime TD scorer odds which is the 6th highest in the game and the best odds for any TE in the game. Although Schultz will see more targets this week, due to the potential run heavy game script, I believe he won’t break out quite yet. 

Projection: 7 targets 4 receptions 50 yards 
____________________________________________________________________________

Aaron Rodgers 
QB #14 on the year - 15.41 fantasy points per game 
233.5 passing yards over/under (-113)/1.5 passing TDs over/under (+112)

I was never an Aaron Rodgers fan. He was a great QB in his prime and had a way of winning games that you didn’t think were possible. The problem is that it was about 10 years ago. Since then, Rodgers has dealt with some injuries and below average seasons by fantasy and NFL standards. Still, the New York Jets thought it was a great idea to give him a ton of money and allow him free reign to call the shots in the front office and out on the field. Well, we have seen how that has worked out of them. They have a worse record than when they had Zach Wilson as their starting QB, they have fired their head coach and they just traded for an aging disgruntled WR who hasn’t played meaningful football in years according to his own words. 

So far, Rodgers is averaging 237 passing yards (261 yards at home w/ 1 London Game vs. 213 yards on the road) on 35.5 attempts (his most since 2019) with 1.5TDs and .88INTs per game while averaging 62% completion percentage (his worst since 2015). He is averaging 6.7 yards per completion this season which is his lowest since 2015 as well. All in all, although he is performing better than the majority of 40 year old NFL QBs, he is still a shadow of his former self in his prime. Again, his age and the fact that he is coming off of an achilles tear last year does make sense. With that said, regardless of the reasoning, the result is the same. 

Rodgers is QB #14 on the year where he is averaging 15.41 fantasy points per game. Hopefully, as the year goes on and Adams gets more integrated into the offense, they will find their stride and Rodgers can be a more consistent streaming option. At this point, I would steer away from him and look for other options (Joe Flacco) to start until Rodgers becomes more of what he was in the past. 

Vegas has set his passing line at 233.5 yards (3.5 yards less than his season average) and 1.5 passing TDs (+112 odds for over 1.5 TDs). They are not expecting too much from him against the 3rd rated pass defense in the league this season. As I stated below, I do believe this should be a ground and pound game to get Breece Hall back on track and to target the Texan’s perceived weakness, their run defense. 

*Aaron Rodgers has averaged 281.3 passing yards on 32.8 attempts and 21.5 completions with 3.5TDs and .3INTs in four career games vs. the Texans**

Projection: 21/30 220 yards 2TD 

Breece Hall
RB #8 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 14.11 fantasy points per game 
66.5 rushing yards over/under (-113)/30.5 receiving yards over/under (-113)/4.5 receptions over/under (+114)/-130 anytime TD Scorer odds (2nd highest in the game)

Breece was and still is the best offensive player on the Jets, and personally, I don’t think it is very close. The Jets corrected themselves in Week 6 and 7 when they gave Breece 85% of the snaps where he finished as the RB #8 in both weeks in Half PPR scoring. The Jets seem lost as to what they want their identity to be on offense. Sometimes they will pound the ball with Breece and Allen, other times they will air it out with Wilson and then occasionally they will just take Breece off the field entirely. Last week, he dropped to 74% of the snaps and only received 3 targets in the entire game (he has never had less than 4 in any previous week this season). He was efficient on the ground averaging 5ypc, however, Allen got 12 carries himself and averaged 2.67ypc. It doesn’t really make a whole lot of sense outside of if the Jets are trying to tank this season which would make even less sense. 

Through the first 8 weeks, Breece is averaging 53.5 rushing yards (48.5 yards at home vs. 58.5 yards on the road) on 13.88 attempts with .38TDs per game. He is still being utilized in the passing game, averaging 39.5 receiving yards (28.25 yards at home vs. 50.75 yards on the road) on 5.75 targets and 4.13 receptions with .13TDs per game. Those are basically the same stats he had last year in terms of opportunity in both the rushing and receiving aspect of the offense. Hard to believe the offense was more efficient when Zach Wilson was behind center but it is starting to look like it was. 

Vegas believes that Hall will have a bounce back game, setting his rushing line at 66.5 yards (13 yards more than his season average), his receiving line at 30.5 yards (9 yards less than his season average) on 4.5 total receptions (.37 more than his season average) and have given him -130 odds to score an anytime TD (2nd highest in the game). If the Jets want to salvage the season, they should make Breece the focal point for this game as the Texans are ranked 13th in the NFL in terms of rushing yards allowed per game but 3rd in the league in passing yards allowed per game. 

*Breece Hall has averaged 40 rushing yards on 10 attempts with 1TD and 86 receiving yards on 9 targets and 8 receptions with 1TD in one career game vs. the Texans**

Projection: 17 attempts 76 yards 1TD/6 targets 4 receptions 49 yards 

Braelon Allen
RB #41 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 6.08 fantasy points per game
20.5 rushing yards over/under (-113)/+450 anytime TD Scorer odds (9th highest in the game)

So, looking back at my Week 3 write-up I would like to take a small victory lap (you have to take them when you get them since projecting NFL usage or fantasy football production is extremely difficult). I wrote that although Braelon Allen is absolutely skilled and most likely the top-end handcuff at the RB position, he would not and should not be heavily integrated into the offense at the sacrifice of Breece Hall. Well, since that week, Allen has seen only 24.2% of the snaps and only 7.2 opportunities per game. 

Overall, Allen is averaging 23.38 rushing yards (27.5 yards at home vs. 19.25 yards on the road) on 6.13 attempts with .25TDs per game. He is utilized in the passing game as well, albeit inconsistently, as he is averaging 9.25 receiving yards (10 yards at home vs. 8.5 yards on the road) on 1.75 targets with 1.13 receptions and .13TDs per game. Those stats put him at RB #41 on the year in Half PPR Scoring where he is averaging 6.08 fantasy points per game. That is very good for a player who has never seen more than 40% of snaps in a week and will only be playing his 9th NFL game this week. 

As I said before, Allen is the premier handcuff and should be rostered in all leagues. However, that does not mean to expect him to make the backfield a committee or take over as the lead back at any point this year outside of an injury to Breece. The week after the coaching change, the Jets only gave Allen 19% of snaps and a meager 5 opportunities. I believe we are going to see more of that same script this week as they need to establish their best player as the focal point of the offense again if they want to salvage their season. Vegas agrees, as they have given Allen a rushing line of only 20.5 yards and +450 odds to score an anytime TD which is the 9th highest in the game. 

*Braelon Allen has no career games vs. the Texans**

Projection: 7 attempts 25 yards/2 targets 1 reception 7 yards 

Davante Adams
WR #62 on the year in Half PPR scoring - 8.75 fantasy points per game (5.95 per game with the Jets)
57.5 receiving yards over/under (-113)/5.5 receptions over/under (+136)/+150 anytime TD Scorer odds (3rd highest in the game)

Adams has not been what we were hoping for when Rodgers and he forced his way onto the Jets with a Week 7 trade. Since he joined the Jets, his numbers have left a lot to be desired as he has averaged only 5.95 fantasy points per game in Half PPR Scoring since the move. 

On the year, Adams is averaging 58.6 receiving yards (40 yards at home vs. 63.25 yards on the road) on 8.4 targets and 5 receptions with .2TDs per game. His season long numbers put him at WR #62 on the year in Half PPR Scoring where he is averaging 8.75 fantasy points per game. Is it possible the Raiders have a more efficient and less broken offense than the New York Jets?? It is entirely possible that Adams is still recovering from his “hamstring” injury which made him miss his last few games as a Las Vegas Raider. It is also possible that Adams is having a hard time adapting to the new offense while the Jets as a whole might need some time as well since they only recently transitioned to a new play caller. This week will show a lot in terms of the Jets as a whole and their individual fantasy pieces as well. 

Vegas believes that the distance between Adams and Wilson is closing as they have set his line at 57.5 receiving yards (5.75 less than his season average) on 5.5 receptions (.5 more than his season average) and have given him +150 odds to score an anytime TD (3rd highest in the game). I do believe this is the week where we get to see why Adams was added to this roster even though he was forced to lose to the Steelers twice in a row. 

*Davante Adams averages 102.7 receiving yards on 10.7 targets and 7.3 receptions with .7TDs per game in three career games vs. the Texans**

Projection: 9 targets 6 receptions 100 yards 1TD

Garrett Wilson
WR #7 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 12.66 fantasy points per game 
59.5 receiving yards over/under (-113)/4.5 receptions over/under (-174)/+185 anytime TD Scorer odds (5th highest in the game)

A few weeks ago I wrote an analysis about Garrett Wilson and what I thought about him as a player. TLDR: he is a WR2 and does not really show the WR1 Alpha traits that most WRs should at this point in time in his career. Especially with how many targets he receives. I am still in the “Garrett Wilson is not that guy” camp but we should know one way or another by the end of this season. 

So far, Wilson is averaging 71.63 receiving yards (70.5 yards at home vs. 72.75 yards on the road) on 10.5! Targets and 6.38 receptions with .38TDs per game. Those numbers put him at the WR #7 on the year in Half PPR scoring where he is averaging 12.66 fantasy points per game (averages 1.98 fantasy points per reception in Half PPR scoring vs. Drake London who is WR #6 on the year in Half PPR Scoring averages 2.22 fantasy points per reception). Wilson has been top 10 in separation score over his first two seasons. He ranks 3rd all time in most targets through his first three seasons and is on pace to break the all time record. So, the opportunity is there and the ability to beat his defenders as well. What is the issue? Wilson does rank 7th in the league this year in dropped passes with 4. The jury is still out on him but there is definitely something that is missing or broken in his game that is holding him back from excelling to the next level. 

Going against the team allowing the 29th most receiving yards per game but giving up the 6th most fantasy points per game to the WR position averaging 19.88 targets and 10.38 receptions with 145.25 yards per game. Those numbers are decent, however; it is hard to split that between Adams and Wilson (along with the ancillary pieces) and still have enough for two productive fantasy weeks. Vegas thinks that Adams will have a better game than Wilson, setting his line at 59.5 receiving yards on 4.5 receptions and +185 odds to score an anytime TD (5th highest in the game). 

*Garrett Wilson averages 108 receiving yards on 14 targets and 9 receptions with 0TDs in one career game vs. the Texans*

Projection: 9 targets 6 receptions 70 yards 

Tyler Conklin
TE #16 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 5.15 fantasy points per game
22.5 receiving yards over/under (-113)/2.5 receptions over/under (-120)/+480 anytime TD Scorer odds (11th highest in the game) 

Conklin has been somewhat serviceable this year especially when you look at the Jets offense as a whole. He is definitely not a plug and play TE option, however, he is viable for streaming or breaking glass in case of emergencies. 

On the year, Conklin is averaging 30 receiving yards (43.75 yards at home vs. 16.25 yards on the road) on 4.75 targets and 3.25 receptions with .25TDs per game. That puts him solidly at the TE #16 on the year in Half PPR Scoring where he is averaging a meager 5.15 fantasy points per game. With that said, over the past two weeks (since Adams has signed) Conklin has only seen 24.5 receiving yards on 4 targets and 3.5 receptions with 0TDs. He has also decreased his snap share from 87% the first 6 weeks of the season to 83% over the past two weeks. This could be a sign of a few different things. One, Rodgers has improved over the season and early on with the rust he could have been searching for his safety blanket. This could also be a change from the offensive scheme point of view when Salah was the head coach. 

This should be a very interesting matchup as the Jets and the Texans rank #2 and #3 respectively in pass yards allowed per game. The Texans also rank top 5 in the NFL in terms of fantasy points given up to the TE only allowing 21 yards per game average and 4 fantasy points per game. Vegas knows this as has set his line at 22.5 receiving yards (7.5 yards less than his season average) and 2.5 total receptions (.75 less than his season average) They have also given him +480 odds to score an anytime TD in this game (11th highest odds). I would expect a quiet night from Conklin due to the defensive matchup and the fact that I think the Jets will once again focus on getting Breece Hall the ball early and often. 

*Tyler Conklin averages 28.5 receiving yards on 3 targets and 2 receptions with 0TDs in two career games vs. the Texans*

Projection: 4 targets 2 receptions 17 yards 

FINAL SCORE: Houston Texans 20 - New York Jets 24

Best Unrostered Team Guesses - Week 9 2024,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1ggepgf/best_unrostered_team_guesses_week_9_2024/,1ggepgf,fritothedog,"This is my guess for the best lineup using players rostered in 5% of leagues or less according to Yahoo. I will do it with 0.5ppr scoring rules.

|POS|PLAYER - TEAM|ROSTERED%|OPPONENT
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|QB|Gardner Minshew II - LV|3%|at CIN|
|RB|Will Shipley - PHI|0%|vs JAX|
|RB|Samaje Perine - KC|4%|vs TB|
|WR|Jalen Coker - CAR|3%|vs NO|

|FLEX|Xavier Hutchinson - HOU|2%|at NYJ|
|D/ST|Arizona Cardinals|2%|vs CHI|
|K|Joey Slye - NE|0%|at TEN|

This team is available in between 81.62% and 96% of leagues.

QB seems easy enough this week, **Gardner Minshew** or Bryce Young? I’ll take the better QB with the better matchup. Minshew should get Jakobi Meyers back in the lineup and should have to throw to keep pace with the Bengals. 

Running back is the hardest position every week for this game. This week feels impossible. **Will Shipley** hasn’t been used much this year but there is a chance this game gets out of hand and the Eagles could throw the rookie in to close out the game.

Last week, **Samaje Perine** made this team with a mere 4 points. I am hoping for more this week. Tampa has been susceptible to pass catching backs and Perine should benefit from that. 

The Panthers may get back Adam Thielen in this one; if he can’t go **Jalen Coker** should be in line for a good deal of work. He caught 4 on 6 targets and scored last week. Legette should draw top coverage from the Saints so Coker may run free for another score this week.

The Ravens are a solid defense but they do tend to give up points to receivers. The Broncos are finding their offense with Bo Nix and **Franklin** could be a big beneficiary this week. 

The Saints should get Derek Carr back, which should elevate the offense as a whole, and **Juwan Johnson** should get plenty of opportunity against the Panthers who give up points to every position but are 3rd best for opposing Tight Ends. 

Don’t start Thursday players in your flex. But that rule doesn’t really apply here. As hard as unrostered RBs are, there were many WRs in consideration this week. Tonight, **Xavier Hutchinson** looks to operate as Houston’s WR2 behind Tank Dell. The Jets have struggled lately. I think they get back on track tonight at home, but Hutchinson could take advantage of the largest workload he’s seen as a pro.

The Bears have been a little up and down. The **Cardinals** seem to be getting their defense going. I like the Cardinals at home to handle the Bears even better than the Commanders did last week. 

The Titans are reeling and the **Patriots** are moving the ball well these days. They just beat the Jets with Brissett, who may get the start this week with Maye in the protocol. I suspect they’ll move **Joey Slye** into range enough times to return a good game. If Maye starts, even better.

Who is your desperation start this week?

It's mid-season now, and I realized I **never gave you a good explanation in  2024** of what goes into my kicker rankings!  I normally explain each year ('[18](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/9cutvg/oc_week_1_subvertadown_projections_for_dst_and/) [19](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/ctyvgb/but_heres_the_kicker_kickers_ranked_for_week_0/) [20](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/ihkl5a/but_heres_some_two_cent_maneuvers_week_0_rankings/) [21](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/p6qpoz/draft_advice_streaming_strategy_2021_subvertadown/) [22](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/wy9d4g/draft_advice_streaming_strategy_2022_subvertadown/) [23](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/16777t2/literally_the_last_thing_you_need_right_now_heres/)), but this year, my [pre-season](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1f7zsvd/thats_the_last_thing_i_need_heres_the_kicker_2024/) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/user/subvertadown/comments/1en7bsw/subvertadown_2024_use_this_post_for_your_questions/) focused on ""How-to-use""-- but not ""*how-they-work*"".

The reason?  I'd planned on creating a video explanation!  But I got too busy to produce it.  So I'm coming back now, because it's important to tell you what they contain.  After all, the key motivation of my work is that you can gain confidence from knowing how the models are built.   Yes, [Accuracy](https://subvertadown.com/article/accuracy-report----first-third-of-the-season-weeks-1---6) is important too... (and it's going well this year!!).  But the *method* is something you should care about.

Let's use today for that.

# Inputs to the Subvertadown Kicker Models

Let's start simple:

* **The entire approach is about asking** ""What information could have been used in past years' games, that would have boosted ranking accuracy?""
* And then we perform many, many ""*does it improve?*"" tests.  Like trial and error, with validation to ensure that we're doing it the right way.

**This is the opposite** of a ""scorecard"" approach-- which we've seen so many times-- where rankers just choose stats they like.  Or blindly ""believe in"".  For example, someone who ranks QBs might use a recipe like *""I'm going to mix a bit of rushing yards-- combine it with a bit of passing efficiency-- add a dash of OL rankings-- and sprinkle in time in the pocket... Voila!"".*

Those kinds of formulas don't really hold up well, not against advanced rankings.  Not for QBs, D/STs, or Kickers.  You can always ask ""*How do you know that's the right combination?*""

And I know some people have published reports online that show ""*look, kickers actually do better on teams that make more TDs!*"", and similar observations like that.  But the key problem is how to *use* that information, because that becomes a problem when you combine multiple metrics together.  For example, once you mix TDs in the same formula with Drive Success Rate, the significance of TDs shrinks (or becomes negative).

What I do, instead, is test hundreds of various metrics by little ""mini-studies"".  The method is a guided machine learning process (AI), to figure out what sticks.  Each study asks, ""What *fore*knowledge (data before each game) would have improved rankings accuracy?""

**Here are examples of some variables that I test for statistical significance:**

* **TD- related**: Extra points, Missed XPs, Two-pt conversions.
* **FG-related**:  Missed FGs, Overall volume, and by distances: 20yd FG, 30yd, 40yd, 50+.
* **Vegas lines**: Own team implied score, and opponent implied score.
* **Conditions**: Wind, Grass/turf, Dome/outdoors, Rain, Snow, Home/away, Mondays, Thursdays.
* **Team defense**: rushing yards allowed, interceptions, early game points allowed, forced fumbles
* **Team offense**: Pace of game, Passing efficiency,  QB rushing, 1st-quarter scoring, RZ
* **Opponent**: Division, Playoff chances, Drive success rate, allowed rushing yards, RZ%-allowed scoring.
* **A lot of other**: rushing or receiving volumes and efficiencies, sacks, turnovers, etc.
* **And yes**: Fourth downs.

I could write fun little reports about all of these!  But mostly I look for ways to combine them, in meaningful ways.  ""Ways that give forward-predictions"".  (Not just fitting data to the past.)  I won't bore you with fancy words like ""collinearity, p-tests, regularization, and cross-validation"".  But there's a lot that goes on here.  (Because it's dangerously easy to ""trick yourself"" that a metric is important, when in fact it just adds noise.)

The main point is we're trying to extract ***situational*** expectations-- real ""game script"".  By allowing the machine to be the judge of what has truly been predictive, before.  Not just what we feel is right.

Let's pause, to look at an example.  Say we want a good formula for ""how many field goals are likely to be kicked from 30-39 yards"".  You might think ""Let's just take the  FG30 average!""  But it turns out that won't give you a very accurate answer.  This is the difference between ""just taking averages""-- which exactly explains the past-- and predictive statistics-- which estimates the future.   The improved, forward-looking answer looks something like:  **{Constant} + 0.02\* #OpponentTurnovers + 2.6\*QB-rating - 0.01\*OpponentImpliedScore - 0.1\*dome -0.03\*#OwnTurnovers - 0.1\*#PassTDs + 0.1\*#FourthDownsAllowedByOpponent...**.

Fun fact, I chose this particular case to illustrate that kicking metrics have almost no predictive influence on FG30 kicks!!  There is **no kicking** in the above equation (#number of FGs, #misses).  So with this approach, we are really estimating how field position is resulting from *game flow* factors, and not always resulting from kicking performance alone.

# Side note

I've skipped a big first step, which probably nobody would notice.  Think about this: ""What average should you use?""  So, pick your favorite variable, like field goals, or sacks.  Is it better to use the full season average?  Or maybe just the past 4 weeks, to catch recent trends?  What if a data point is really high one week, just because they faced an easy opponent?  Should you include such outliers in the average?  Most people won't care about this, but I've actually studied this... Actually, for every input that goes in, I optimize how many weeks to include, how to account for outliers, and how to account for previous opponent strength.

# Blending of Various Kicker models

The next steps are something I haven't really talked about much before...: Sub-models.

Sure, there is one ""overall kicker model"" you can get from the above method.  But I actually create ***many*** smaller models.  For example:

* **Multiple models by time of season**: Different models for early / mid / late season.  NFL teams will use kickers differently, over the year!
* **Multiple models by game score**:  Kickers follow different patterns, depending if their team will score higher or lower.
* **Models for Tuesday vs. models at kick-off**:  Vegas lines and weather change from Tuesday to Sunday, so it helps to tune models for forecasting from early in the week.
* **Separate models for each component**: Models for total FGs.  Models for PATs.  Models for number of punts, and models for FG at 20, 30, 40, 50+ distances.  [I hope you read this post at week 3 explaining key findings about these.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1fjryti/heres_the_kicker_a_new_view_on_field_goal/)

As you can see, with so many model variations, this gets pretty hard to describe!  All-in-all, this adds up to **over 50 kicker models** working together.  (Yeah.)  Then all these pieces need to come together.  That means I also need to run tests asking ""How should these separate models have been combined, in the past, to improve historical rankings?""  (Note: Finally... there are 2 extra adjustments I apply, I'll be happy to describe-- some other time!)

# The Outputs

On the other end of all this, y'all get the Top-8 Kickers on my website [front page](https://subvertadown.com/)!

At the time of writing, they are **Seibert, Aubrey, Dicker, Butker, Elliott, Tucker, Reichard,** and **Koo**.

As many of you know, I also use the models to simulate all future games, which is how I make the 17-week ROS charts-- which (don't forget!) you can view freely for [RB](https://subvertadown.com/rest-of-season/running-back?sort=week_9&week_offset=9&scoring_type=standard), [TE](https://subvertadown.com/rest-of-season/tight-end?sort=week_9_deviation&week_offset=9&scoring_type=ppr), and [WR](https://subvertadown.com/rest-of-season/wide-receiver?sort=week_9_deviation&week_offset=9&scoring_type=ppr)\-- and how I create the ""Hold"" column I show freely for [D/STs here](https://subvertadown.com/weekly/defense?sort=current_week_projection).

Although the top 8 kickers are not in ranked order (for non-subscribers), I believe I'm giving valuable input (freely) for your lineup decisions.  Nobody has to stick to them, of course-- It's best that you always decide your own information source-- but it's a fine check.  The rankings have worked very well this year, after all my off-season updates (It was a very different situation 1 year ago, when I announced the updates were needed).  And while there will **always** be busts every week, and even this week could go horribly-- because Kicker rankings will always be ""bad""-- the approach I've described above should help avoid them.  I wrote my last [accuracy report](https://subvertadown.com/article/accuracy-report----first-third-of-the-season-weeks-1---6) after week 6, and I can say the 2 weeks after that have gone decently for kickers.

.

And that leads me to the Aggregated Kicker Rankings, which I last did a few weeks ago:

# Aggregated Kicker Rankings

**Week 9.**   Some of you still miss the point, somehow!  These are not mine.  And no, I don't use them as inputs!

The purpose is to provide you with a ""second opinion"", based on other rankers who have usually done pretty well over the years.  They are aggregated from 5 sources I've found ""least untrustworthy"" over years, to provide a ***different viewpoint*** for you to consider from my own.

|Aggregated Rankings|Subvertadown difference|
|:-|:-|
|1 - Aubrey|**\~** close|
|2 - Koo|**\~** close|
|3 - Tucker|**\~** close|
|4 - Reichard|**\~** close|
|5 - Butker|**\~** close|
|6 - McPherson|\- lower|
|7 - Bass|\- lower|
|8 - Seibert|**+**higher|
|9 - Elliott|\- lower|
|10 - Fairbairn|\- lower|

Note, it actually takes a lot of time to compile this aggregated picture, too, so it's only worth continuing if you guys care.  :-)

Remember that you can always refer to my list of [kicker pros-and-cons](https://subvertadown.com/weekly/kicker), which should help regardless of which ranking source you choose.

Good luck.

There are *plenty* of players I *could* include in this piece each week, but these I feel are important to mention.

As always, feel free to discuss risers and fallers of your own, and whatever else, in the comments!

For Week 9:

**RISERS** include a wide receiver on last week’s fallers list who will benefit greatly from a QB change

**FALLERS** include an RB averaging 5.8 yards per carry this season whose schedule is absolutely brutal

**THE HOT SEAT** has a wide receiver with just a single week with a double-digit PPR score…and that was in Week 1
