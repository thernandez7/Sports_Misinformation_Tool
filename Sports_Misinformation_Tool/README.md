**SportsNewsTool.ipynb** is the main notebook that includes the step-by-step outline of the project's main steps. This is where the tool can be found and run. The database is on Tiziana's local machine, so it will only work through her computer. However, the CSV file **new_data_predictions.csv** is an exact replica of the data currently in the database. 


**GloveEmbeddings.ipynb** and **SentimentToolAnalysis.ipynb** contains the code exploring bias and evaluating the glove embeddings and sentiment analysis tool respectively. 

The final important notebook file is the **heuristic_analysis.ipynb**. This notebook contains our preliminary analysis of true and false headline feature to biuld into our heuristic. It also contains the heuristic labeling function, but this is also included in SportsNewsTool.ipynb. 

-----------------------------------------------
The CSVs include the various datasets we worked with and created throughout our project when we were evaluating potential strategies. 

The main one to note is **All_RSS_articles.csv**, which contains all the data the models are trained/tested on. 

Note: Glove embedding was too large to push, so must be downloaded before running.
