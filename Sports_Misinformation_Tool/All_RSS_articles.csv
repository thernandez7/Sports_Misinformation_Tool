Brennan Rigsby added 15 points on 5-for-10 shooting for Minnesota (3-1), which bounced back from its first loss of the season. Lu'Cye Patterson finished with seven points to go along with a team-high six assists.   John Poulakidas scored 21 points and grabbed six rebounds to lead Yale (2-3). Isaac Celiscar had 11 points and seven assists off the bench, and Casey Simmons finished with nine points on 4-for-5 shooting from the field.   Minnesota shot 36.4 percent overall (20 of 55) and 17.6 percent (3 of 17) from beyond the 3-point line. Yale shot 44.4 percent (20 of 45) from the field and 50 percent (7 of 14) from long distance.   The Golden Gophers overcame poor shooting by limiting their turnovers. They committed only three turnovers, compared with 14 turnovers by Yale, and in large part because of that advantage Minnesota outscored Yale 15-2 in points off turnovers.   Yale led 29-19 at the break. Minnesota outscored the Bulldogs 40-27 in the second half.   The score was tied at 50 after Garcia made a jump shot with 4:28 remaining.

Garcia finished 10 of 12 from the free-throw line.

The top-seeded Sinner rolled to an easy 6-1, 6-2 victory over sixth-seeded Casper Ruud in Saturday's semifinal to return to the championship match. Sinner will face fifth-seeded Taylor Fritz on Sunday after the American knocked off second-seeded Alexander Zverev 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (3) in the other semi at Turin, Italy. The Italian racked up nine aces and won 81.5 percent (22 of 27) of his first-serve points while dispatching Ruud of Norway. ""I felt I was returning well in the first games of each set and then when going up a break I tried to be very concentrated with service games,"" Sinner said. ""I tried to be intense with each shot and I'm very happy with the performance and to be in the final again."" Sinner received a boost from the home-country crowd during the 70-minute win. He had a 22-10 edge in winners. After the match, a loud ovation was touching to Sinner, who was won 69 matches this season, won major crowns at the Australian Open and U.S. Open in addition to becoming the first Italian man to reach No. 1. Now on deck is winning this event. Last season, he lost the title match to Novak Djokovic after beating the Serbian in round-robin play. On Tuesday, Sinner defeated Fritz 6-4, 6-4 in the round-robin stage. ""It's a very similar circumstance to last year as we have already played in the round-robin,"" Sinner said. ""I just try to play the best I can tomorrow. From last year to now I feel I have more experience and have grown as a player. Hopefully it will be a good day after a very positive week and a very positive year."" Fritz became the first U.S. player to reach the finals in this event since James Blake in 2006 with his victory over Zverev of Germany. Fritz had a 15-10 edge in aces with both players delivering a high level of power tennis. Fritz jumped out to a 4-1 lead in the tiebreaker before Zverev won the next two points. Fritz then won the next three to seal it. ""I trust my game and I trust my level,"" Fritz said. ""I don't feel anywhere near as uncomfortable in these situations anymore because I've been putting myself in these situations against the top guys at big events a lot lately. ... I'm really confident in my game."" Fritz is 1-3 against Sinner, losing twice this season, including being swept in three sets in the final of the U.S. Open. It was the fifth time Fritz and Zverev squared off this season. Fritz won four of the meetings and eliminated Zverev from Wimbledon (round of 16) and U.S. Open (quarterfinals). ""This one will hurt maybe a bit more because I thought I played at a decent level and I had more chances generally in the third set,"" Zverev said. ""I felt like statistically and shot-wise, my level maybe was even higher than his until the important moments. That's where I kind of blew it. This one will hurt more than the other few."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

Altmyer hit 19 of 32 passes, primarily to senior wideouts Pat Bryant (4 catches, 135 yards, 1 TD) and Zakhari Franklin (7 catches, 44 yards, 1 TD) on Senior Day.   Aidan Chiles completed 23 of 40 passes for 256 yards and two touchdowns for the Spartans (4-6, 2-5), but also suffered five sacks and narrowly avoided several others. After losing its third straight, Michigan State must beat Purdue and Rutgers at home to secure a bowl berth in Jonathan Smith's first year at the helm.   After the teams exchanged punts on their first drives, they swapped touchdown bombs on their second drives.   Bryant got behind two Spartans down the left sideline and caught a 57-yard touchdown pass from Altmyer at the 9:52 mark of the first quarter. Michigan State responded with Aziah Johnson getting wide open down the right sideline on a coverage bust for a 52-yard scoring strike from Chiles two minutes after Illinois' TD.

Oregon is coming off an 80-70 overtime win over in-state rival Portland on Tuesday. The Ducks trailed by as many as 13 in the second half and were down 11 with less than five minutes left in regulation before rallying. It wasn't a solid performance for the Ducks, who looked better in wins over California-Riverside and Montana. The Pilots took advantage of the Ducks' cold shooting and defensive miscues to take the lead and hold it for much of the game. Pacing the Ducks' comeback, Jadrian Tracey provided energy and offense off the bench with 19 points and four steals, and Keeshawn Barthelemy was clutch down the stretch, scoring 11 of his 13 points in the last four minutes of the second half. ""Those first 36 minutes were probably the worst 36 minutes we've played all season, honestly, including myself,"" Barthelemy told the Register-Guard in Eugene. ""Defensively, we didn't impose our will, we gave up a lot of easy baskets, we messed up a lot of switches, we were just too cool to care at that point. It was probably really obvious from the naked eye."" Troy (2-1) of the Sun Belt Conference posted wins over Toledo and New Orleans before a 65-49 loss at No. 18 Arkansas on Wednesday. The Trojans led the Razorbacks 27-26 at halftime but couldn't sustain the defensive effort in the second half ""First half, we were locked in and did a great job executing. When the defense is down on our end, it's a little easier to help our guys out,"" head coach Scott Cross told the school's athletics website. ""Second half, we just turned the ball over and didn't have the same grit and toughness defensively. We didn't do the little things we normally do."" Jackson Fields leads Troy in scoring at 12.7 points per game. He had a team-high 13 against Arkansas. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

As good as Novak and Campos were to reach 16-under par for the tournament, Wesley Bryan was one shot better in the third round amid a steady wind to tie the tournament record with a 10-under 61. Bryan moved up 42 spots into sole possession of fourth place at 13 under. Second-round leader Justin Lower (68) was alone in third place at 15 under. Novak shot a 7-under 29 on the front nine, birdied two of the first five holes after the turn and cruised home with four consecutive pars. Campos birdied each of the last four holes in the front nine and three of the last four on the back nine for his 62. ""Luckily, we had not much wind early and so I was able to get a nice rhythm going early in the round,"" Novak said. ""We really didn't start feeling much wind until about the sixth hole and by then I'm 5 under through six. So I picked up a little bit then and carried some momentum (into) some downwind holes and was able to take advantage of that."" Novak and Campos, each seeking their first PGA Tour victory, delivered their lowest round of their careers. Novak is making his 85th start, while Campos is in his 80th start. Not only is Campos trying to earn his PGA care for the 2025 season, he is playing after his wife gave birth to the couple's daughter this week. ""I held my daughter (and) I thought about in like 20 minutes I had to go to the airport,"" Campos said. ""I do want to provide for them as much as I can, so we're here and fortunate.  Everything went well and we got our flights in and we were able to get here on Thursday morning and make our tee time. Obviously, it's a bonus that I'm doing well this week."" Campos was equal parts dreading the windy conditions, while also embracing them after he won on the Korn Ferry Tour in 2019 on a windy day. ""It was very windy today, especially at the end, but it does give me confidence,"" Campos said. ""The harder it gets, the better it is for me, I believe. I have to admit I'm not the best ball-striker, but I can move my way around the course trying to keep trajectories down and all those things."" Lower was tied for the lead with one hole to play in the third round but his tee shot at No. 18 found the penalty area and he finished with a bogey 5. He shot 1-over 36 on the back nine, with a bogey 5 at No. 11 and a birdie at the par-5 No. 17. ""I was fuming pretty good there after the tee shot (at 18) and going up to the drop and whatnot, but just like I'm still playing well, still have a chance,"" Lower said. ""My caddie did a good job keeping me in it."" Lower considered the wind unplayable late in his round. ""I think if a top-10 or top-15 player in the world was here and they wanted to stop, I think the rules officials would have said, ‘Yeah, we'll stop,'  "" he said. ""... If we would have said ‘I don't feel comfortable playing in this,' we would have been told 'tough' and to proceed with the round. So that's how I feel about it."" Bryan now shares the tournament record low round with Taylor Pendrith (second round, 2021) and Alex Noren (first round, 2022). His 29 on the back nine tied a tournament record, and he had two eagles Saturday to give him three in the tournament. His memorable round came after a long night. ""I'll be honest, woke up this morning on very, very little sleep,"" Bryan said. ""Stayed up for the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson (boxing) match and that didn't finish until about, shoot, 2 in the morning. It was one of those spectacle events that I just felt I needed to watch."" A group of three tied for fifth place at 12 under included Lucas Glover (66), Troy Merritt (66) and Sam Ryder (68). Glover and Merritt moved up five spots Saturday, while Ryder dropped one spot. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

It was supposed to be a pass to Mgbako, who sealed his defender, but the ball sailed over the top of the defense and into the hoop.   South Carolina took an early 4-0 lead, but the Hoosiers responded with a 14-0 run that culminated with a Rice jumper at the 14:34 mark of the first half. An Ugusuk 3-pointer cut the Gamecocks' deficit to 20-17 with 8:31 remaining in the first half. Indiana was able to push its lead back to double figures at 35-24 on a Mgbako layup.

""A lot of ugly stretches. Pretty clear that I didn't have these guys ready to play. Put the responsibility on me. I've got to do a better job of getting these guys prepared. It was embarrassing. There were two stretches where our fans booed, and rightly so. I was ashamed to hear that, but they were right."" One of the most surprising aspects of Friday's game was the performance by Heat forward Kevin Love, who scored all 15 of his points in the third on 6-of-8 shooting, including 3-of-4 from beyond the arc. The 36-year-old Love added seven rebounds, four steals and two assists in just 12 minutes. Love has started the last three games but could move back to a reserve role when Butler returns.

Pitt used a 13-0 scoring run in the fourth quarter to take a 20-17 lead with 1:36 remaining after a 47-yard field goal from Ben Sauls capped off an eight-play, 26-yard drive that burned nearly three minutes off the clock. Clemson (8-2, 7-1 ACC) needed three plays to move back in front. Klubnik dropped back to pass and took off at midfield zig-zagging and then sprinting up the field for the longest touchdown of the game. The Panthers (7-3, 3-3) had 76 seconds and two timeouts to respond, but their potential game-winning drive ended on fourth-and-1 at the Clemson 26-yard line when Nate Yarnell's pass was intercepted by Khalil Barnes. Klubnik completed 27 of 41 passes for 288 yards and two touchdowns. He also finished as Clemson's leading rusher on the day with a net 41 yards after he was sacked eight times. Antonio Williams hauled in 13 of Klubniks passes for 149 yards and both of Clemson's scores through the air. Yarnell, starting in place of an injured Eli Holstein for Pitt, completed 34-of-54 passes for 350 yards and a touchdown. Panthers tight end Gavin Bartholomew had the TD reception during Pitt's fourth quarter comeback. Pitts' offense was also boosted by running back Desmond Reid, who piled up 176 yards of total offense on 24 touches, that included 10 receptions for 108 yards Clemson had a 17-7 lead at the end of the first half after Klubnik's 28-yard score with Williams early in the second quarter and after Nolan Hauser kicked a 51-yard field goal. Pitt had the ball for about nine minutes longer than Clemson, but turned the ball over twice and had 13 penalties for 100 yards. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

Jalon Moore also had 21 points and five rebounds as the Sooners (3-0) remained unbeaten thanks to two big surges in each half, which helped stave off the resilient Hatters (1-3), who dropped their third in a row. After falling behind early in the game, Oklahoma used a 23-2 run in the first half to open up an 18-point lead. But Stetson, which was led by Abramo Canka's 22 points on 8 for 12 shooting, would not go away easily. The Hatters cut the deficit to 51-43 with 14:01 left with an 8-0 run sparked by sharp shooting by Canka and Jordan Wood, who finished with 11 points and two assists. Duke Miles (six points, four assists) snapped the run with a corner triple. Elvis and Moore then sparked another big run as the Sooners scored 16 unanswered points to put themselves ahead 70-46 with 7:39 left in the second half. While Stetson's 3-point shooting (9 for 24) kept it in the game, turnovers were the major detractor. And Oklahoma took advantage, turning 23 Hatters giveaways into 31 points. Elvis and Sam Godwin each had three steals to lead the effort for Oklahoma on the defensive end. Godwin also had a game-high 10 rebounds and the Sooners collected 15 offensive rebounds. Jeremiah Fears also had 11 points, three rebounds and three assists for the Sooners. Oklahoma also shot 9 for 24 from 3-point range and totaled 21 assists while only turning the ball over 11 times.

Lampkin finished with 20 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists and Donnie Freeman chipped in 19 points and 12 rebounds for the Orange (3-0), who recovered after blowing an eight-point lead in the final 75 seconds of the first overtime.   EJ Farmer recorded a career-best 26 points for the Penguins (1-2), while Nico Galette pitched in 21 points and seven rebounds and Ty Harper notched 17 points and seven rebounds.

The Penguins' Juwan Maxey made two 3-pointers to cut the deficit to two. Jaquan Carlos missed two foul shots for Syracuse, setting up Harper's game-tying free throws with seven seconds to play.

Lampkin then took over with three buckets in a stretch of 1 1/2 minutes, helping the hosts take a 95-91 lead with just over two minutes left.   Starling's layup with 1:11 to go created a 98-93 lead, and the Orange made their free throws down the stretch.   The game was tied at 64 when Galette drained a 3-pointer with 2:38 remaining in regulation. Lampkin and Freeman answered with buckets for the Orange, however, as Syracuse slipped ahead 68-67 with two minutes left.   Farmer, meanwhile, was doing everything he could on the other end.

Thorne was 20 of 29 for 224 yards with no interceptions.

Tigers running back Jarquez Hunter carried 14 times for 102 yards for a season total of 1,015, his first time eclipsing the 1,000-yard plateau. By winning for just the second time in seven games, the Tigers improved their all-time record against the Warhawks to 12-0.

With starting quarterback Thorne returning from a shoulder injury, Auburn went 60 yards on its first series and counted on Coleman, who caught three passes on the eight-play drive. He broke a tackle on the final one and dashed 20 yards at 10:57.  Auburn kicker Ian Vachon made his first attempt for the Tigers, a 22-yarder with 5:21 remaining in the first quarter. On its best drive of the day, Thorne and the Tigers used 16 plays to travel 99 yards in 7:34 to make it 17-0. The quarterback capped the possession with a 3-yard TD lob to Coleman.

Colton Parayko dished a pass to Schenn in transition, who buried a wrist shot past Boston goaltender Joonas Korpisalo for the winning goal. Radek Faksa registered a goal and an assist, Nathan Walker also scored and Alexey Toropchenko dished out two assists for St. Louis, which had been in an 0-3-1 rut -- including a 3-2 home loss to Boston on Tuesday. St. Louis had a 31-17 shots-on-goal advantage, holding Boston to no more than six in any regulation period. Jordan Binnington made 15 saves.  Playing against his hometown team, Trent Frederic scored both Boston goals. Korpisalo stopped 28 shots on goal for the Bruins, who have dropped back-to-back games (0-1-1) following a 2-0-1 run. Walker brought the Blues even with 10:42 left in regulation and forced the extra session, burying a wrister from above the right circle after receiving a low-to-high pass from Faksa. Faksa gave the Blues a 1-0 lead at 6:25 of the first period, tipping Scott Perunovich's shot from just inside the blue line. The initial game-tying goal came from Frederic at the 9:34 mark, as he buried a rebound after Georgii Merkulov tipped Charlie McAvoy's pass down low from the point.  Merkulov's primary assist marked his first NHL point in his fifth career game. Frederic netted his second goal of the period only 2:38 later, redirecting Mason Lohrei's drive from the left point while screening Binnington at the net front.

The Suns will look to bounce back from their lowest-scoring game of the season when they visit the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday afternoon in Minneapolis.   Phoenix has lost back-to-back games and three of its last four, including a 99-83 road setback against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday night. The Suns shot 29.3 percent (22 of 75) overall and 24.3 percent (9 of 37) from beyond the arc.   ""We played great defense,"" Suns veteran Royce O'Neale said. ""Offensively, we missed a lot of shots, especially wide open.""   Phoenix coach Mike Budenholzer agreed.   ""We've probably got to play a little bit better offensively,"" he said. ""That's the great thing about playing great teams and great defenses. They test you. They make you learn what you've got to work on, how you've got to be better.   ""We'll learn from (Friday night) and be better.""   The Timberwolves hope to keep the Suns searching for answers.   Minnesota returns home after a disappointing road trip that included two straight losses against the Portland Trail Blazers, followed by a 130-126 overtime win against the Sacramento Kings on Friday.   Anthony Edwards scored a team-high 36 points on 14-for-27 shooting to lead the Timberwolves to their latest victory. Julius Randle scored 26 points and Rudy Gobert notched a double-double with 11 points and 11 rebounds.   ""This game was super important,"" Edwards said. ""I'm glad we were able to come out with the win.""   The Timberwolves feature five players who average double digits in scoring.   Edwards leads the group with 28.4 points per game on 46.8 percent shooting from the field. Randle is next with 20.6 points and Naz Reid is contributing 15.4 points in about 25 minutes off the bench.   Gobert (10.8 points) and Jaden McDaniels (10.1) round out the top five.   Phoenix is without top scorer Kevin Durant, who is averaging 27.6 points but is sidelined by a calf injury. Fellow veteran Bradley Beal, who is third on the team with 17.8 points, also is dealing with a calf injury.   That leaves the bulk of the scoring responsibility to Devin Booker, who ranks second with 22.5 points on 42.3 percent shooting from the floor. Booker struggled against Oklahoma City on Friday, when he was held scoreless in the first half and finished with 12 points on 2-for-10 shooting.   ""They put two people on him pretty much every time he had it,"" Budenholzer said. ""There was a ton of attention on him.""   This is the Suns' first visit to Minnesota since last season's first-round playoff series between the teams. The Timberwolves swept the Suns 4-0 in the best-of-seven Western Conference quarterfinals.   Minnesota posted home victories against Phoenix by margins of 120-95 and 105-93 to open the series. The teams then traveled to Phoenix, where the Timberwolves recorded victories of 126-109 and 122-116 to secure a trip to the conference semifinals.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

The game was the first for the two programs as league foes since 1990 when they were a part of the now-defunct Southwest Conference. The intensity still was high as the Longhorns (9-1, 5-1 SEC) stayed on track for a spot in the SEC Championship game in their inaugural season in the conference.    Up 10 points with 9:05 to play, the Longhorns forced a fumble and then held on to the ball over the final 6:55 to secure the victory, their third straight after a lone loss at home to Georgia on Oct. 19.   Jaydon Blue rushed for 83 yards on 13 carries as Texas outgained the Razorbacks 315-238 in total yards during the victory.   Arkansas quarterback Taylen Green had 149 yards passing but absorbed six sacks for 48 yards in losses and threw an interception for the Razorbacks (5-5, 3-4).    The Longhorns struck first, moving 61 yards in six snaps to a 20-yard Ewers-to-Golden TD pass midway through the first quarter. Texas added to its lead with a 39-yard field goal by Bert Auburn at the 11:15 mark of the second quarter .   Texas' defense dominated the first half, holding the Razorbacks to just 74 total yards while recording four quarterback sacks and six tackles for a loss. Arkansas crossed midfield just once, and then to just the Texas 46.   The Longhorns extended their advantage to 13-0 on Auburn's 33-yards field goal on their opening possession of the third quarter.    Arkansas finally responded, moving 75 yards in 12 plays to a Ja'Quiden Jackson 1-yard TD plunge to make it 13-7 with 3:39 to play in the third. The Razorbacks more than doubled their prior offensive output on the scoring march.   Matthew Shipley's 44-yard field goal with 12:48 remaining at the end of a 10-play, 39-yard drive culled the Arkansas deficit to just three points.   Ewers then found Golden on a nifty 1-yard touchdown pass to stem the Arkansas tide and re-establish the Longhorns' 10-point lead. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

Gotham goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger had nine saves prior to the shootout while Kingsbury stopped four. Hatch began the shootout by sending a right-footed shot into the top right corner of the net. Kingsbury then easily saved Gonzalez's right-footed attempt. Silano was up next and sent a right-footer into the wide-open right portion of the net. Gotham's McCall Zerboni's right-footer was then stopped by Kingsbury. McKeown then sent a right-footed grounder into the lower left corner for Washington's third shootout tally. Gotham then faced do-or-die and Jenna Nighswonger's left-footer was gobbled up by Kingsbury to end it. Earlier, Gotham took a 1-0 lead in the 56th minute as Yazmeen Ryan delivered a left-footed cross toward the center of the box. Gonzalez then sent a header toward the right corner that trickled into the net. Things looked bleak for the Spirit as the seven minutes of second-half stoppage time began. But Nighswonger was called for a yellow card for a rough foul to give Washington a free kick. Makenna Morris took the kick and delivered a solid pass toward the center of the box and Hershfelt rose to head the ball into the left corner of the net to tie it. Gotham played with just 10 players for the last 19 minutes of extra time after Bruninha knocked down Trinity Rodman at the sideline. Bruninha was given her second yellow card of the game with the automatic elevation to red. Three minutes later, Rodman set up Hatch for an opportunity in front of the net but Hatch's left-footed shot was saved by Berger. Gonzalez had a huge chance in the 24th minute of extra time but her header off a corner kick was knocked away by Kingsbury.

That possession ended in a three-and-out, and Horvath was done for the day. His only pass was an incompletion, and he had 25 yards on five rushes.

Three plays later, Mensah scrambled up the middle for a 14-yard touchdown and a 7-0 lead.   Navy tried to answer, converting a fourth-and-1 at the Tulane 44 on its next possession. But on a fourth-and-3 at the 35, the Green Wave's Caleb Ransaw broke up a 5-yard pass play that would have yielded a first down.   Tulane then marched 65 yards on 11 plays, chewing up more than six minutes, and capped by Hughes' 14-yard touchdown run. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

A layup by Sorber made it 44-29 at the break.   A pair of 3-pointers 45 seconds apart by Epps sliced the deficit to 50-40 with 18:10 left. But the Hoyas got no closer the rest of the way. Notre Dame pulled away behind Burton, who tallied 12 of his points in the second half, and Micah Shrewsberry, who scored seven of his nine points after intermission.   Notre Dame maxed its lead out at 25 points with 4:27 left as Allocco scored on a driving layup, making it 79-54. - Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

Tate, who had four receptions for 52 yards, made an 8-yard TD catch on the first drive for the Buckeyes (9-1, 6-1 Big Ten) in the second half to make it 28-7 before a pro-Ohio State crowd. The score was set up by a 68-yard catch-and-run by Jeremiah Smith, who finished with four catches for 100 yards. Ohio State made it 31 straight points on a 28-yard field goal by Jayden Fielding with 44 seconds left in the third. Ohio State has won 11 straight vs. Northwestern since 2004. The victory sets up a showdown at home next Saturday against No. 5 Indiana. The Hoosiers (10-0, 7-0) are idle this week. Northwestern (4-6, 2-5) frustrated the Buckeyes in the first quarter, limiting them to one possession that resulted in a punt while the Wildcats held the ball for 10 minutes. They had 118 total yards compared to 30 for Ohio State. The Wildcats took a 7-0 lead early in the second quarter when quarterback Jack Lausch, who lost a fumble at the Ohio State 16 on Northwestern's first possession, ran for an 8-yard score to complete a 92-yard drive. Lausch was 21-of-35 passing for 201 yards with Bryce Kirtz making seven catches for 92 yards. Ohio State responded by going 85 yards in 12 plays with Judkins going in from the 1 to make it 7-7. The Buckeyes soon made it 14-7 thanks to blocking a Northwestern punt after a bad snap to get the ball at the 1. Two plays later, Judkins again scored from the 1. Ohio State extended the lead to 21-7 with 47 seconds left in the half on a 25-yard catch by Tate from Will Howard (15-of-24 passing for 247 yards). Howard's passing success was complemented by the running of Judkins (76 yards) and TreVeyon Henderson (74).   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

Tennessee (3-0) is vying for its second straight 4-0 start following three convincing victories. Last time out, the Volunteers followed up a 22-point win at Louisville with Wednesday's 92-57 home drubbing of Montana. Tennessee led by just seven early in the second half before pulling away for its largest margin of victory this season. Charlotte transfer Igor Milicic Jr. led the way with 18 points and 10 rebounds, while Felix Okpara, Chaz Lanier and Cameron Carr each chipped in 13 in the Volunteers' balanced scoring effort. Milicic, who also tallied five assists, upped his season scoring average to 11 points per game, third on the team behind Lanier's 16.7 and Zakai Zeigler's 14.3. ""Igor can handle and shoot the ball, and he showed that,"" Tennessee head coach Rick Barnes said. ""But he changed his mindset tonight. I thought he made good plays as opposed to thinking he's got to score every time the ball is in his hand. I thought he played with flow, made some really good passes. We thought his versatility was the biggest thing he could bring to our team."" A key in Tennessee's last two wins has been its edge on the glass, as the Volunteers have outrebounded Louisville and Montana by a combined total of 78-43. ""(Rebounding) is a big part of what we talk about in our program,"" Barnes said. ""It's a major emphasis for us and it's a compliment to the players, because it's not an easy part of the game. It's something that takes determination and fight to do it. ... It's important. You can't be a great defensive team if you can't finish with a rebound, and you don't want to be a one-and-done offensive team either."" Barnes and Tennessee hope the advantage continues Thursday, when the Volunteers take on Virginia in the first round of the Bahamas Championship. Tennessee will play either Baylor or St. John's in the next game. Before that, Austin Peay comes to Thompson-Boling Arena in Knoxville in hopes of its second upset this year. The Governors (3-0) won at Butler 68-66 on Nov. 8, before beating Chattanooga 67-61 at home on Monday. LJ Thomas leads Austin Peay with 19.7 points per game, followed by Sai Witt's 12. Witt, a Preseason All-ASUN Conference first-teamer, recorded 17 points and eight boards in Monday's victory over the Mocs. ""Sai is a force to reckon with,"" Austin Peay head coach Corey Gipson said. ""He is great at working angles. He does his work early. When he is playing against defenders that don't do their work early, they have to pay. I don't think you can guard him in one-on-one coverage, and teams are starting to double him, but since we have such good spacing, he is savvy enough to play inside-out."" Austin Peay is 1-10 all-time against Tennessee, with its one victory a 74-70 upset in December 2011. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

Dayvion McKnight supplied 13 points and Zach Freemantle notched 11 for the Musketeers (4-0).  Xavier received its stiffest test in four home games to begin its schedule but outscored the Demon Deacons by 30-15 from beyond the 3-point arc.

That's what this young basketball season has been like for the Miami Hurricanes (2-0), who on Sunday will host the Coppin State Eagles (0-5). In Miami's opener, Fairleigh Dickinson swarmed Hurricanes players who even thought about shooting a 3-pointer. As a result, Miami attacked the rim, tying a school record for shooting percentage (66.7) while cruising to a 113-72 win. Center Lynn Kidd, making his Miami debut, scored 24 points on 10-for-11 shooting. In Miami's second game, Binghamton double-teamed Kidd repeatedly. As a result, Kidd was held to just six points, but starting guards Nijel Pack and Jalen Blackmon scored 17 each. ""We're versatile on offense,"" Pack said. ""We have so many weapons. Our offense, as long as we continue to keep getting better each game, with our defense, and continue to learn, we should be set."" Indeed, Pack (19.0 ppg), Blackmon (16.0) and Kidd (15.0) are Miami's leading scorers. Pack also leads the team in assists (5.5), and Blackmon is No. 1 in 3-point percentage (60.0). Miami's other top veterans are Brandon Johnson (8.5 points, team-high 8.0 rebounds) and Matthew Cleveland (9.0 points, 5.5 rebounds). Two freshmen also have been impressive for the Hurricanes, as Divine Ugochukwu and Jalil Bethea are both averaging 11.0 points per game. Pack and Blackmon both played high school ball in Indiana. Yet, they had never played on the same team until this season, when Blackmon transferred in from Stetson. Blackmon said the quality of players around him this season has improved his game. ""I find it a lot easier when you're playing with such good players that can make plays for you and you can make plays for them, so I don't have to take as tough shots,"" he said. ""I can get easier shots and can help other guys get easy shots as well."" Meanwhile, Coppin State is coached by Larry Stewart, a former NBA forward.

The teams combined for only 12 fastbreak points. Yacine Toumi chipped in 12 points and seven rebounds for the Pirates (2-2), who held the Seahawks to 23.9 percent shooting from the field and 16.7 percent shooting from 3-point range. Seton Hall connected on 45.5 percent of its shots overall, including 8 of 18 attempts from long range (44.4 percent). Wagner (1-3) got eight points and five boards from Javier Ezquerra and seven points from Ja'Kair Sanchez. After Keyontae Lewis cut the Seahawks' deficit to 26-16 with a layup to open the second half, Seton Hall turned the game into a rout by scoring 20 of the next 24 points to make it 46-20 with 8:57 to play. Dylan Addae-Wusu, Isaiah Coleman and Jenkins each drained a triple during the Pirates' back-breaking run. Seton Hall never let the lead dip below 21 the rest of the way. Wagner grabbed a 7-2 lead 4:34 into the game, but the Pirates dominated the rest of the first half.

With a victory, the Chiefs might as well consider themselves 12-0, as the Carolina Panthers and Las Vegas Raiders await them in Weeks 12 and 13, respectively. Kansas City will be tested down the stretch due to meetings with the Los Angeles Chargers, Houston Texans, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Denver Broncos, but it has already downed two of those teams this season, so we still like its chances. And oh yeah, the Chiefs’ game on Dec. 15 against the Cleveland Browns? That’ll be a win, too. Running back Isiah Pacheco won’t be back this week for Kansas City, but he’s nearing a return after fracturing his fibula in Week 2. Wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins has also been a seamless fit in the offense, hauling in 12 receptions for 142 yards and two touchdowns over the past two games. The Chiefs are somehow only getting better. Knowing that perfection is very much within reach for Kansas City is a hard pill to swallow. We hear about this team more than enough on a weekly basis, and mainstream media seemingly hasn’t said a bad word about it in almost 10 years. Just imagine what we’d be force-fed if the Chiefs became the first team to complete an undefeated regular season since the New England Patriots did so during the 2007 campaign. One can only wonder how the league would tie Travis Kelce’s relationship with Taylor Swift to the 17-0 record. Well, if Buffalo doesn’t win on Sunday, we’re all bound to find out. Of the teams Kansas City still has to face, the Bills have the best shot of tagging the Chiefs with their first loss in our eyes. The Chargers are on a three-game winning streak, but all three victories came against low-level competition; the Texans have been on a steady decline for nearly a month, the Broncos don’t have the experience to get the job done, and we’d imagine the Steelers will fade at some point with Russell Wilson under center. Pittsburgh has to, right? Have no fear, though, NFL fans. No matter how the Chiefs finish the regular season, they won’t be going all the way in the playoffs. No team has ever managed to win three Super Bowls in a row, and that’s not going to change this season. You could even argue that going 17-0 might hurt Kansas City in the long run. Sure, the Chiefs are battle-tested and have proven that they have what it takes to win on the league’s biggest stage, but we don’t know how they’d respond to the added pressure of following up an undefeated campaign with another championship. At the end of the day, taking home the Lombardi Trophy is what really matters. That New England team back in 2007 had 18 wins and just one loss—the Super Bowl—and that one loss made it get lost in history. And the Chiefs might find themselves in that same predicament if they put too much emphasis on chasing perfection. Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

With two games left on the season, Ball State is 3-7 with a 2-4 record in the Mid-American Conference. ""Coach Neu has poured his heart into the Ball State football program,"" athletic director Jeff Mitchell said Saturday. ""I commend him for his professionalism and the positive team culture he has constructed. His efforts have greatly impacted the lives of hundreds of young men. He has represented the Ball State brand with integrity and class, and I wish him well in future pursuits."" Neu, 53, had just one winning season since taking the helm in 2016. The Cardinals were 7-1 in 2020, finishing the season with the MAC title, a 34-13 win over San Jose State in the Arizona Bowl and the No. 23 postseason ranking. The following season, Ball State lost 51-20 to Georgia State in the Camellia Bowl to finish 6-7. A native of Indiana, Neu was the Ball State quarterback from 1990-93. He led the Cardinals to the MAC title in his senior year, making him the only person to win the MAC as both a player and head coach for the same school. Neu's record through nine seasons at Ball State was 40-63.  Offensive line coach Colin Johnson, also a former Ball State player, will be the interim head coach for Ball State's two remaining contests this season: a Nov. 23 home game against Bowling Green and a Nov. 29 road game against Ohio. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

The Hoosiers are 10-0 for the first time in their history. They never won 10 games in a season before this one, either, and they are fifth in the College Football Playoff rankings. The new contract averages $8 million a year and includes an annual $1 million retention bonus. He initially signed a six-year, $27 million contract when he was hired on Nov. 30, 2023.  His new pact brings his salary more in line with the highest-paid coaches in the Big Ten, where Lincoln Riley at Southern California and Ryan Day at Ohio State earn just more than $10 million annually. ""After first meeting Coach Cignetti, we were very confident that he was the perfect fit for what we were trying to build with our football program,"" athletic director Scott Dolson said. ""We were confident IU could become a winning program and we love what he's building here. We love the student-athletes that he's bringing here. We love how our fanbase has rallied around this team and made Memorial Stadium the place to be on Saturday afternoons. And now, we love the fact that he's going to be doing all those things right here in Bloomington for a long, long time."" Cignetti, 63, replaced Tom Allen, who was fired after a 3-9 overall record and a 1-8 mark in the Big Ten last season. His teams were 33-49 in seven-plus seasons and finished above .500 in the Big Ten just twice. The Hoosiers are 7-0 in the conference this season. Idle Saturday, they travel to No. 2 Ohio State next Saturday for a highly anticipated Big Ten showdown.

Unbeaten through three games and coming off its first win as a ranked team in nearly a decade, No. 22 St. John's will host New Mexico on Sunday afternoon in New York in the fourth coaching matchup between Rick Pitino and his son Richard Pitino.  Rick Pitino is 2-1 against his son. The Red Storm (3-0) are starting a week when they not only face New Mexico, but 12th-ranked Baylor on Thursday in the Baha Mar Hoops tournament in the Bahamas/ St. John's might face 11th-ranked Tennessee or Virginia in that event.  St. John's is coming off three wins in its on-campus arena in Queens over Fordham, Quinnipiac and Wagner by a combined 76 points. ""New Mexico is probably the No. 1 offensive-pace team in the country, and I know it better than anybody,"" Rick Pitino said after the Red Storm earned their first win as a ranked team since Dec. 28, 2014.  ""So we've got to get ready for this pace. They've got a great guard, they've got great support players, they've got a terrific inside player. This is a tough, tough test.""  The first three games featured moments when the Red Storm struggled, especially during Wednesday's 66-45 win over Wagner. St. John's scored 18 straight points to pull away in the final 10 minutes. The Red Storm shot 50 percent from the field (21 of 42) but took 13 fewer shots than Wagner and missed 12 of 30 free throws. RJ Luis Jr. scored 13 points as St. John's top scorer, but Aaron Scott made three key shots during the decisive run and added 11. Scott made his key contributions after sitting out against Quinnipiac on Nov. 9 with an illness and tweaking his ankle in practice ahead of the Wagner game. ""We did our job against these three teams,"" Rick Pitino said. ""Now it's really going to get tough."" Pitino changed the starting lineup by having Kadary Richmond come off the bench along with Zuby Ejiofor, but both could return to starting on Sunday. New Mexico (3-0) received 15 points in this week's Top 25 poll and is seeking its second win over a ranked opponent this season. The Lobos knocked UCLA out of this week's poll by beating the then-No. 22 Bruins 72-64 on Nov. 8. New Mexico is attempting to start 4-0 for the second time in three seasons after earning a 100-81 home win over Texas A&M Corpus Christi on Tuesday, when the Lobos forced 22 turnovers following forcing 21 against UCLA.  Donovan Dent, who is averaging a team-high 19 points a game for the Lobos, totaled 25 points and 10 assists and continued his improvement from his sophomore season. Dent averaged 14.1 points on 52 percent shooting from the field but last season but is shooting 58.8 percent in 2024-25. ""It was a good win for our guys,"" Richard Pitino said. ""I thought they were ready to go. When you have a big win like UCLA, everyone is telling them how great they are. Then you have another big game against St. John's coming up. I thought the mental approach was terrific to handle their business against (Corpus Christi)."" Besides Dent's big showing on Tuesday, Kayde Dotson added 18 points and Tru Washington 15.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

McIlroy, of Northern Ireland, needs to finish in the top 11 of the tournament to capture his sixth season crown. McIlroy will enter the final round of the DP World Championship in Dubai on Sunday in a three-way tie for first place, sitting at 12-under after shooting a 68 on Saturday. Tied with McIlroy are third-round leader Antoine Rozner of France (69) and Dane Rasmus Hojgaard, who rode six birdies on the front nine to a 66 at Jumeirah Golf Estates. McIlroy mixed six birdies with two bogeys on the round, but couldn't capitalize on any birdie opportunities after the 12th hole, recording pars the rest of the way. ""After the birdie on 12, you know, I had a good chance,"" McIlroy told reporters after the round. ""I hit a really good shot into 13 and just caught the edge. And then 14 and 15 are birdie holes, and not being able to birdie either of those, and only with a 6-iron in my hand going into the last green and not making birdie there, as well. ""A little disappointed how I played those last five holes, but still obviously in a really good position heading into tomorrow."" One person who wasn't disappointed was Hojgaard, who picked up six strokes on the field early with six birdies on the front nine. He was three strokes off the lead entering play Saturday, then three ahead as he made the turn. And at the par-5 No. 18, he saved what appeared to be a sure bogey -- or worse -- with a par-saving putt. He said he'll approach the final round the same way that he did on Saturday. ""Try not to worry too much of what's ahead of me. Try and play one hole at a time and see if I can get the best score possible out of that hole, just like 18,"" Hojgaard said. ""So yeah, I think that's my target for tomorrow, try and keep the bogeys away."" Rozner, who entered the round with a one-stroke lead, will enter play Sunday with some momentum after an eagle at No. 18 kept him atop the leaderboard. ""I think the eagle on last helped me big time. I'm happy with my day overall,"" Rozner said. ""I didn't produce my best golf of the week so far but I was always hanging in there. I managed to hole a couple putts on the back nine that were big for me."" Chasing the leaders on Sunday will be Sweden's Jesper Svensson, whose 68 tied him with Joaquin Niemann of Chile (69) two shots back at 10-under. England's Tyrrell Hatton (71) is alone in sixth place, three shots off the pace, and Tom McKibbin of Northern Ireland and Japan's Keita Nakajima sit at 8-under. All eyes are likely to be on McIlroy as he tries to win the tournament and the season championship in the same season for the third time. ""It's a great opportunity to end the year on a really high note,"" he said. ""Going to go out there tomorrow and give it everything I can and hopefully things fall my way and I'm able to stand on that 18th green with both trophies."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

Bettors have the rest of Week 11 ahead of them, but they don't have to settle for the traditional betting line if they don't want to. No, each game comes with a healthy menu of player props. Bettors can choose from over a thousand player props for the Sunday games. The following is a list of our top 10 player props for NFL Week 11 (in no particular order). NFL Week 11: Player Props Green Bay Packers vs. Chicago Bears Jordan Love, O/U 32.5 passing attempts at -102/-128 (FanDuel) Opponents have averaged just over 30 attempts per game against the Bears this season and just over 27 in the last three. Why so few? Because foes don't need to throw on the Bears. Once teams get out to a sufficient lead, they lean heavily on the run to run time off the clock. That's what the Patriots did when they beat the Bears last week, as did the Cardinals the week before. Love has exceeded 32.5 attempts in four of his seven starts this season, including two of his past three. But don't count on him to do it again, as the Packers will do like everyone else when they play the Bears and lean on the run game. Take the UNDER. Cincinnati Bengals vs. Los Angeles Chargers Joe Burrow, O/U 265.5 passing yards at -115/-115 (DraftKings) Burrow widely is regarded as one of the better passers in the NFL. Anyone who watched him throw for 428 yards last week vs. the Ravens will probably agree with that sentiment. However, there are a couple of things working against Burrow going OVER this total. For one, the Chargers have a solid pass defense that is allowing just 191.6 yards per game. While Burrow is averaging 267.2 passing yards per game, take away his two ridiculous outings against the Ravens, and his average is 231.5 yards per game. Take the UNDER. Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Baltimore Ravens George Pickens, O/U 68.5 receiving yards at -120/-110 George Pickens, longest reception, O/U 26.5 yards at -135/+100 George Pickens, O/U 4.5 Reception made at -130/+100 George Pickens, 75+ Receiving Yards at +110 *Odds via BetMGM The Ravens can't defend against the pass (league-worst 294.9 yards allowed per game). It's been well-documented and evident whenever they play a competent quarterback. Russell Wilson appears to be one once again, and he has done a great job connecting with George Pickens on deep balls. In Wilson's three starts, the veteran quarterback hit Pickens with a long of 44, 43 and 34 yards. No one gives up more 20-plus-yard receptions than the Ravens (47). Wide receivers are averaging nearly 200 yards a game against the Ravens. If Wilson targets Pickens eight times, he will make at least five catches and almost certainly will go OVER 68.5 yards, if not 75+ as well. Unless the Ravens suddenly figure out how to defend against the pass, Pickens will have a career day. Take the OVER for each prop. Lamar Jackson, O/U 43.5 rushing yards at -127/-108 (Caesars) Jackson has gone over this number in seven of 10 games this season but not in his past two. Against the Steelers, he will face one of the best run defenses in the game (No. 4, 87.1 ypg allowed). But they are not just good at stopping running backs. Pittsburgh is quite good at containing running quarterbacks. The Steelers' defense is one of the best at keeping quarterbacks from scrambling. Quarterbacks are running on 1.5 percent of dropbacks, the lowest rate in the league. If Jackson sets his mind to it, he would clear 44 yards against the Steelers D, but they don't need him to. That's what they signed Derrick Henry for, so someone other than their quarterback can run for the tough yards. Take the UNDER. Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Detroit Lions Amon-Ra St. Brown, O/U 76.5 receiving yards at -105/-115 (DraftKings) Jared Goff, O/U 228.5 passing yards at -113/-113 (FanDuel) Jahmyr Gibbs, O/U 15.5 rushing attempts at +100/-130 (BetMGM) Bonus: Jahmyr Gibbs, O/U 69.5 rushing yards at -113/-113 (FanDuel) St. Brown has gone over this total just twice this season, vs. the Buccaneers in Week 2 and the Vikings in Week 7. The Jaguars do not have a defense that can contain him, but don't count on him to go OVER 76.5 yards. Why not? The Lions will not need him to. Detroit is a massive favorite in this game. Once the Lions get a comfortable lead, the offense will focus more on running the ball and eating up the clock. That is also why Goff will probably not go over 228.5 yards passing, a number he has gone over once in his past three games. Take the UNDER for both. As for Gibbs and his rushing attempts, he has gone over 15.5 carries just twice this season as he is in a committee with David Montgomery. (They both have 122 carries heading into this game). Thus, Gibbs is getting 13.6 attempts per game, so he would need at least two more to hit the OVER. Assuming the Lions do lean on the run in the second half once the game is in hand, he would get closer to 20 carries and closer to 90-100 yards than 69.5. Take the OVER on both. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

Fox was 22 of 35 from the field and 6 of 10 from 3-point range in a 130-126 overtime loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night. ""I would've rather us gotten the rebound in the fourth and me not even get 60,"" Fox said. ""It's definitely cool, but obviously, I definitely wanted to get the win."" Fox moved into the franchise record book by surpassing Jack Twyman's 59 points for the Cincinnati Royals on Jan. 15, 1960. Sacramento rallied from a 20-point deficit in the third quarter despite playing without Malik Monk (right ankle) and DeMar DeRozan (lower back tightness), who missed his first game of the season. Fox engineered the Kings' comeback by scoring 39 of his 60 points after halftime. ""He's an All-Star, and the sky is the limit for him,"" Sacramento coach Mike Brown said. ""He knew we needed help, and he put us on his back, and he almost carried us to the finish line, but he did everything in his power and it was a spectacular performance by him."" The Kings also received another strong outing from center Domantas Sabonis, who recorded his 12th straight double-double with 23 points and 12 rebounds. Keegan Murray added 14 points and 10 rebounds. Sacramento will aim for its sixth straight win over Utah. The Kings won the first meeting this season on Oct. 29, when Sabonis finished with 28 points and 11 rebounds in a 113-96 victory. Utah has won three of its past five games, including 115-113 over the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday. John Collins scored 28 points and Jordan Clarkson added 20 for the Jazz, who recorded their first home victory of the season after Collins scored with 6.4 seconds remaining. ""Tonight isn't about the Xs & Os piece, it was about the mental and physical toughness that the team showed,"" Jazz coach Will Hardy said. ""It felt really, really good to battle through a tough moment and pull out a win here at home."" Rookie Kyle Filipowski is quickly emerging as a key building block for Utah, which took the 6-foot-11 forward with the 32nd pick in this year's NBA draft. Filipowski is expected to make his second straight start on Saturday in place of Walker Kessler, who is out due to hip bursitis. Jazz forward Lauri Markkanen is listed as questionable with an eye contusion. Filipowski has totaled 32 points on 13-of-19 shooting from the field over his past two games, but Hardy was most impressed with his defense against Dallas star Luka Doncic on Thursday. ""I think Doncic picked him a lot to isolate, and I thought that Kyle was fantastic,"" Hardy said. ""Luka is one of the hardest players in the league to guard in isolation, and I thought that Kyle did a really good job of moving his feet, using his body, bracing up for contact and really not being sloppy with his hands and fouling."" Hardy also has been pleased by the play of Collins, who is averaging 21 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 3.3 assists in six games this month. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

The best bets for Week 12 dive into a trio of games featuring teams currently in position to reach the inaugural 12-team College Football Playoff. Week 12’s biggest game pits sixth-ranked Tennessee against No. 11 Georgia, with the Bulldogs possibly fighting for their Playoff lives. The stunning 28-10 loss at Ole Miss in Week 11 has put Georgia's back against the wall. There’s value in taking Tennessee on the moneyline: FanDuel offers the 9.5-point underdog Vols at +270 to win straight up, while DraftKings has Tennessee ending its six-game losing streak to Georgia at +295. For those not confident in a Tennessee outright win, Tennessee at -105 (FanDuel, BetMGM) to cover the 9.5-point spread is worth a look—particularly in light of the factors that make the 46.5-point under a smart bet. At 12.6 points allowed per game, the Vols are holding opponents to the fifth-lowest yield in the FBS. They’re allowing 0.3 points per game fewer than the Ole Miss defense that gave Georgia fits a week ago, including holding Alabama’s 38.1-point-per-game offense to just 17 points. No opponent has scored more than 19 points against Tennessee, which came in the Vols’ lone defeat. That 19-14 setback against Arkansas highlighted the weaknesses in the Tennessee offense that might make bettors hesitant about taking the Vols to win outright—particularly against a talented Georgia defense allowing just 18.4 points per game. But with the Bulldogs having had their own offensive struggles against Kentucky and Ole Miss, two of the best defenses they’ve faced this season, Saturday’s contest should be an old-school, low-scoring SEC grind, no matter which side wins.

Undefeated BYU comes into its Week 12 matchup with the Jayhawks having won five one-possession games, including last Saturday’s wild 22-21 comeback victory over rival Utah. Kansas, meanwhile, is 0-4 in one-score games after taking its rival and another Big 12 Playoff hopeful, Kansas State, to a 29-27 final on Oct. 26. Each team’s tendency to play close games may have contributed to the opening line of BYU -7 plummeting to the Cougars being favored by less than a field goal. Kansas is better than its 3-6 overall record suggests, and the Jayhawks should give BYU another competitive game. However, KU has struggled on the road—the Jayhawks are 0-4 away from Lawrence this season—and Lance Leipold’s team may struggle to limit BYU’s passing offense as effectively as Utah did last week. Jake Retzlaff went just 15-of-33 for 219 yards against Utah, with a season-low 6.6 yards per attempt. Utah’s defense is holding opponents to fewer than 50 percent completions with just 10 touchdowns allowed on the season. Kansas heads into Provo ranked No. 89 nationally against the pass, allowing 233.4 yards per game with a completion percentage yield greater than 60. Expect a more efficient Cougars offense against the Jayhawks, and a bit more breathing room in a BYU win than it had a week ago as Kalani Sitake’s team moves one win closer to the Playoff.

Ashton Jeanty, however, was impressive, breaking 200 rushing yards for the fourth time this season. His three touchdowns also marked his fifth outing with at least three scores. As the Boise State running back looks to become the first Heisman Trophy winner from a non-Autonomous Five conference since BYU’s Ty Detmer in 1991, look for his production to increase down the stretch. That starts with Saturday’s visit to San Jose State, a surprising 6-3 team with a slim but realistic chance of reaching the Mountain West Conference Championship Game. San Jose State’s rushing defense has been stout, holding opponents to just 3.7 yards per carry. But SJSU has also been giving up points—31 or more in four of the last six contests. While reaching the 200-yard milestone again may be a tough ask of Jeanty, Boise State should have scoring opportunities. That means Jeanty will see plenty of chances to punch it into the end zone and continue building his Heisman resume.

The Mavericks head home for the battle with their Lone Star State rivals after dropping a 115-113 setback to the Utah Jazz on Thursday. Naji Marshall misfired on a corner 3-pointer at the buzzer for the Mavericks, who have four consecutive losses by a combined eight points. ""Poise, calmness is a big thing and we're not there yet,"" Dallas coach Jason Kidd said. ""With a new group, that could be an issue early on, but there's no better way to go through it than being able to play close games and learn from your mistakes and also learn from being able to win games.  ""It's the small details. If we can clean up some of these little things on these plays, that puts us in a better seat."" Luka Doncic led all scorers with 37 points in the loss. Marshall scored 19 points, Klay Thompson had 17, Quentin Grimes added 15 and Daniel Gafford had 10 for the Mavericks, who played without Kyrie Irving (strained right shoulder). Dallas was down by 14 points after three quarters and charged back, going up by two with 1:33 remaining to set up the furious finish.  ""It's adversity, man,"" Marshall said. ""That brings out the best in people. We're going to run through a wall facing this adversity and get better. Later on in the season as we made the right changes, we'll look back on this and see how far we came."" The Spurs head north for the second game of a home-road back-to-back set after a 120-115 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday. The contest was the first in NBA Cup group play for both teams. Victor Wembanyama paced the Spurs with 28 points and 14 rebounds and Stephon Castle added 22 points. Devin Vassell had 15 points, Keldon Johnson hit for 12 and Chris Paul collected 11 points and 11 rebounds for San Antonio, which saw its two-game winning streak come to a halt. Vassell, who missed nine months with a broken foot, still is coming off the bench under a minutes restriction as he works his way back into the starting lineup.  ""I'm not tripping about it as long as we are winning and playing well,"" Vassell said of his reserve role.   San Antonio was down by just a possession when Castle was forced to settle for a contested, step-back 3-pointer with 12 seconds left that was rebounded by the Lakers. San Antonio still has yet to win an NBA Cup game after going 0-4 last year. The Spurs could have backup guard Tre Jones back in the fold for Saturday's game. Jones has been out since Oct. 26 with an ankle injury. ""I would hope sometime very soon. I'm not sure if it's (Saturday) or Tuesday, but I would suspect very, very soon,"" Spurs interim coach Mitch Johnson said Friday. Dallas beat the Spurs in the teams' first matchup this season, 120-109 at home on Oct. 24.  The teams won't play again until back-to-back games March 10 and 12 in the Alamo City. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

They will face the host Los Angeles Kings on Saturday less than 24 hours after squandering a two-goal lead late in the second period in a 6-4 setback to the Ducks in Anaheim.   The Red Wings saw a 3-1 lead go away after the Ducks scored four unanswered goals, the final two of them 38 seconds apart midway into the third period. Alex DeBrincat scored on the power play with 3:44 left to pull Detroit to 5-4, but an empty-net goal clinched the victory for Anaheim.  ""This is back-to-back games where we had really good starts. We built leads and we got away from it,"" Red Wings coach Derek Lalonde said.  Detroit led 2-0 in the second period in Pittsburgh on Wednesday but had to go to overtime to get a 3-2 win.  Marco Kasper scored his first NHL goal and added an assist, and DeBrincat and Lucas Raymond also scored and set up a goal Friday. Three of the Red Wings' goals came on the power play, giving them 11 with the man advantage in their last 10 games. Alex Lyon made 23 saves for Detroit, but Cam Talbot likely will get the start in goal Saturday. The Kings are coming off a fruitless two-game road trip, losing 3-1 to the Calgary Flames on Monday and 4-2 to the Colorado Avalanche on Wednesday.   Adrian Kempe scored both goals on Wednesday, and Trevor Moore and captain Anze Kopitar each had two assists. ""They pushed, and we didn't do a very good job handling it,"" Kings coach Jim Hiller said. ""I thought, for whatever reasons, once we got into the second period, we had a really tough time connecting on passes. Turning pucks over because we just couldn't get ourselves out of the D-zone.""  Goalie Darcy Kuemper (undisclosed) and defenseman Caleb Jones (upper body) left Wednesday's game with injuries and were placed on injured reserve on Friday.  Kuemper made 20 saves before departing 4:34 into the third period. David Rittich, who replaced Kuemper, will start in goal Saturday. Defenseman Drew Doughty (broken ankle) and forwards Alex Turcotte (upper body) and Arthur Kaliyev (broken collarbone) remain out with long-term injuries. Los Angeles recalled goaltender Erik Portillo and defenseman Jacob Moverare from the Ontario Reign of the American Hockey League. Forward Tanner Jeannot is eligible to return to action Saturday after serving a three-game suspension for his hit on Vancouver Canucks forward Brock Boeser on Nov. 7. Alex Laferriere leads the Kings with nine goals while Kopitar has club-best totals in assists (15) and points (20). Kempe is tied with Kevin Fiala with seven goals to go with 16 points.   Raymond's 16 points (two goals, 14 assists) lead the Red Wings, DeBrincat is next with 15 (seven goals, eight assists), and captain Dylan Larkin has 12 points, including a club-best nine goals. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

Next, they will try to halt the Los Angeles Lakers' four-game winning streak as both teams look to sweep back-to-backs Saturday night in New Orleans.  The Pelicans had lost six in a row and nine of 10 amid a rash of injuries before recording a 101-94 win over the visiting Nuggets, who played without three-time league MVP Nikola Jokic (personal reasons).  ""It's a credit to all of our players, the character in our locker room,"" Pelicans head coach Willie Green said. ""I'm asking these guys to do so much. They're giving it everything they got in practice and film.  ""Our whole staff has been super supportive and together, and everybody's working as hard as they can to go out on the floor and be as good as we can be, but also working to get guys back on the floor. So, really good win for us, especially trying to weather this storm.""  Brandon Ingram had 29 points, nine rebounds and seven assists in 37 minutes against the Nuggets. The Lakers selected him with the second overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft, and he spent three seasons in Los Angeles. ""He has been big-time for us,"" Green said of his team's leading scorer. ""Who knows where we would be without him on the floor right now. His contribution night-in and night-out has been at a super high level.  ""He's been seeing double teams, triple teams, picking him up full court, trying to wear him down and he's handling all of this with grace and he's been super supportive with his teammates. He's minimizing the frustration out there and he's doing a great job of leading.""  Brandon Boston Jr. scored 19 points and Trey Murphy III added 17 to supplement Ingram's scoring.  In Jokic's absence, New Orleans out-rebounded Denver 56-38, including 17-5 in offensive rebounds. Rookie center Yves Missi led the way for the Pelicans with a game-high and season-high 12 rebounds.  LeBron James had his career-high fourth consecutive triple-double (15 points, 16 rebounds and 12 assists) and Anthony Davis had a double-double (a season-high 40 points on 14-of-26 shooting and 12 rebounds) in the Lakers' 120-115 win at San Antonio on Friday.  In addition to the two stars, Los Angeles had four other players score in double figures. Austin Reaves scored 19, rookie Dalton Knecht had 14, D'Angelo Russell 13 and Max Christie 11.  ""It was big time for our team knowing that we can execute down the stretch,"" James said. ""It doesn't always have to be just the ball in my hands and we isolate or whatever the case may be.""  Davis, who is averaging a career-high 31.1 points and has scored 30 or more points in seven of 11 games, noted the significance of the Lakers winning for the second time in six road games this season.  ""We want to be just as good of a road team as we are a home team,"" said Davis, who played his first seven NBA seasons with the Pelicans. ""And we can't do that if we don't come out and compete.  ""We've just been a different team when we've been out on the road. The way we compete, share the ball, play together at home, is totally different than when we (go on the road).

Struggling Pittsburgh is coming off a 6-2 loss at the Columbus Blue Jackets on Friday night and will play its next five games at home. Anthony Beauvillier collected a goal and an assist and Michael Bunting also scored on Friday for the Penguins, who have lost three straight games and five of their last six (1-3-2). ""We're looking for (consistency), obviously,"" Pittsburgh superstar captain Sidney Crosby said. ""We've got to commit to play the same way. That's not always easy to do. There's a lot of things that can affect that. We can't allow anything to change the way we play."" Crosby, who had an assist on Friday, remains two goals shy of 600 for his career. Beauvillier extended his goal streak to three games and is tied with Crosby and Rickard Rakell for the team lead in goals (six). Tristan Jarry returned from a stint at Wilkes Barre/Scranton of the American Hockey League to work on his game. He made 33 saves in his first start since Oct. 16. Bunting's goal tied the game 2-2 in the second period before Columbus pulled away in the third. ""You look at a couple of the goals they score, they're outside shots where the rebound lays there,"" Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. ""We're either puck-watching or we don't get into people. We got to be harder at our net front, and we got to make 'em work harder for those types of goals."" Pittsburgh defenseman Kris Letang missed the game due to illness. Meanwhile, forward Matt Nieto played 13:26 and had one shot on goal in his first NHL game since Nov. 30, 2023. He had reconstructive MCL surgery on his left knee in May after undergoing laparoscopic surgery to his right knee in January. The Sharks fell to 1-1-1 on their road swing after dropping a 3-2 decision at the New York Rangers on Thursday. The game started well for San Jose as defenseman Timothy Liljegren scored his first goal of the season at 2:51 of the first period to give the Sharks a 1-0 lead. But the second period belonged to the Rangers, who scored three times, once after Chris Kreider intercepted Mackenzie Blackwood's backhand pass along the boards that ultimately led to Mika Zibanejad scoring the tying goal. ""We mismanaged some pucks, and a good team like that will make you pay,"" Sharks coach Ryan Warsofsky said. ""We didn't do that in the first, and that's why we had success. But we mismanaged pucks, soft puck play, and it's in the back of our net."" The Sharks were outshot 16-6 in the second period and 11-4 through the first 10 minutes of the third. Fabian Zetterlund scored a power-play goal with 26 seconds remaining to pull the Sharks within 3-2. Blackwood finished with 32 saves. ""Did a lot of good things in this game,"" San Jose's Alexander Wennberg said. ""There are parts of it that you want to learn from. But we made a push at the end. Obviously, it wasn't enough.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

It will be the first of four games at home for the Canadiens, who are coming off a four-game trip in which they were outscored 17-11 while going 1-3-0. Seven of Montreal's goals came in a 7-5 win against the Buffalo Sabres on Monday. That victory snapped a six-game slide for the Canadiens, who followed with a 3-0 loss to the Minnesota Wild on Thursday. The Canadiens are 3-9-2 since winning two of their first three games of the season. ""We're not in the business of being happy with losses,"" defenseman Mike Matheson said after the game against the Wild. ""Teams that are high in the standings find a way to win."" Montreal sits last in the NHL's overall standings with 12 points through 17 games. It's been a struggle at both ends of the ice. The Canadiens have more than three goals only five times thus far, winning four of the games, and more than half of the team's 46 goals have come largely from three players. Cole Caufield is tied for second-most goals in the league with 12, which leads the team. Brendan Gallagher is second with seven, while captain Nick Suzuk  follows with six. Suzuki enjoyed a four-point effort (two goals, two assists) against the Sabres, his only points over the past six games. Juraj Slafkovsky has scored once and not since Oct. 14, though his 10 assists are tied for second on the team behind Suzuki (11). Kirby Dach also remains stuck on a single tally, last scoring on Oct. 26, and has just two assists - both against Buffalo - in his past eight games. ""We had a good effort (against Minnesota), but at the same time, we have to convert on our chances,"" Matheson said after the most recent loss. Not helping matters is the puck going in at the other end. Montreal has allowed 70 goals, second-most in the NHL. Only the Pittsburgh Penguins (77) have given up more. The Blue Jackets, meanwhile, head north of the border looking to build off a 6-2 win against the Penguins on Friday that snapped a six-game slide (0-5-1). The Blue Jackets have only 14 points in 16 games. ""Now we have that win,"" said goalie Elvis Merzlikins, who played Friday, ""we have that winning mentality back on and we have to keep going."" Daniil Tarasov is expected to start in goal against the Canadiens. He will aim to pick up his first win since Oct. 22, when he backstopped Columbus to a 6-2 triumph against the Toronto Maple Leafs. He's 0-2-1 in his three appearances since. Before Friday's offensive outburst against Pittsburgh, the Blue Jackets had just 11 goals in six games in November. ""The frustrating part on the whole is that we're playing extremely well in a lot of areas, we're outplaying teams in a lot of areas, and we're not getting the results,"" Columbus coach Dean Evason said before the game. ""That's a positive end of it, but we're a results league. We're not satisfied with where we're at, and we don't want to get into a position where we're accepting losing."" Forward Mathieu Olivier scored his first goal since Oct. 28 in Friday's win, tying his career high with five goals on the season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

It will be the second game in as many nights for Toronto, which is coming off Friday night's 99-95 loss against Detroit in the second NBA Cup game for each team. The loss extended Toronto's overall losing streak to six games. Toronto's Jakob Poeltl had 25 points and 18 rebounds, but the Raptors dropped to 0-2 in NBA Cup play.   ""We depend on (Poeltl) a lot,"" Toronto coach Darko Rajakovic said. ""He needs to do a lot for us offensively and defensively. ... When he is connected with his teammates he's able to score, but also find his teammates. I think he's making huge strides for us.""   Toronto's RJ Barrett added 22 points in Friday's loss. Gradey Dick scored 16 but was 1 of 10 from 3-point range. Boston hasn't played since it beat Brooklyn 139-114 Wednesday night. Jayson Tatum had 36 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds in the win. Boston also received 24 points and 12 rebounds from Jaylen Brown and 23 points from Payton Pritchard. The 139 points were the most the Celtics have scored in a game this season. Boston scored 74 points in the second half. That victory came one night after Boston lost 117-116 to Atlanta at home. The Hawks prevailed even though Trae Young, the team's leading scorer, didn't play because of right Achilles tendinitis. ""As far as our attitude and our bounce-back, I thought that was important,"" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. ""There's going to be ebbs and flows throughout the season. I care more about how we respond to things when they don't go our way, and I liked the approach that we had to the game today on both ends of the floor."" Boston committed 20 turnovers against the Hawks, who had a 19-6 advantage in offensive rebounds. The Celtics turned the ball over seven times and had a 12-3 edge in offensive rebounds against the Nets. ""Back to back, obviously heavy legs and stuff like that,"" Brown said after the Brooklyn game. ""It took a little bit to get settled into the game, but great adjustment, great response. It was just about being physical, being tough and embracing that.""   Tatum, at an average of 30.2 points a game, and Brown (25.4) are Boston's leading scorers this season. Tatum also leads the team in rebounds (7.6) and steals (1.5). Brown is second on the team in rebounds (7.2) and is tied with Pritchard for second in steals (1.2) ""It starts with them taking responsibility as far as what needs to be done on the floor,"" Mazzulla said. ""So they played at a high level on both ends of the floor. Defensively, their communication, the accountability on their individual defense. Then offensively, taking the shots that they want to take and getting the ball where it needs to get to.   ""So it's a credit to them, and they know how important two-way basketball on both ends of the floor is for our success."" For the Raptors, Barrett is averaging a team-high 21.4 points a game, and Poeltl is first in rebounds at 11.6.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

Bailey, a consensus top-5 recruit, missed the first two games with a hip injury but displayed little rust. He was 5-for-10 from the field with a game-opening 3-pointer and added two thunderous dunks. He also chipped in six rebounds and two steals in 30 minutes. Another freshman for Rutgers (3-0), Dylan Harper, added 20 points, six assists and five rebounds.

Fifita completed 20 of 35 passes for 224 yards for the Wildcats (4-6, 2-5 Big 12), who never trailed and went up 27-3 on Quali Conley's 50-yard touchdown run late in the third quarter. Conley had scored on a 13-yard reception earlier in the quarter. Houston (4-6, 3-4), which entered the game third-to-last nationally in scoring (15.2 points per game), committed three turnovers and turned the ball over on downs four times, including on fourth-and-goal from the 1 in the second quarter and on a fake punt near midfield in the third quarter. Loop ended the first half with his 62-yard field goal, breaking the Arizona record of 57, held by four players. Loop added a 51-yard field goal in the third quarter. Conley finished with 107 yards on 11 carries. Tetairoa McMillan caught six passes for 70 yards and a touchdown. Arizona safety Genesis Smith had an interception and a fumble recovery to go with seven tackles, 1.5 for loss. Houston, which had won three of its previous four games, failed to reach double-digit points for the fourth time this season. The Cougars' final scoring chance was thwarted on a fumble inside the Arizona 10 with 4:27 to go. Cougars quarterback Zeon Chriss completed 16 of 27 passes for 191 yards with an interception. He also rushed for 55 yards on 18 carries.

Carolina went 1-2-0 on a road trip that ended Wednesday with a 4-1 loss to the Utah Hockey Club. The Hurricanes fell despite attempting a season-high 50 shots, but they left Salt Lake City with an even bigger concern. In that game, Hurricanes goalie Pyotr Kochetkov left midway through the third period. Coach Rod Brind'Amour told reporters afterward that the 25-year-old Russian got ""banged up"" earlier in the game. Kochetkov did not dress for practice on Friday, and Brind'Amour said he doubted the netminder could play Saturday, although the team did not immediately make a decision to call up a substitute. Kochetkov has an 8-2-0 record with a 2.56 goals-against average. He had been playing the majority of the games since Frederik Andersen went down with a lower-body injury late last month, and it's uncertain when Andersen will return. ""We were hoping it was going to be week-to-week, but now it's going to be, I would say, way longer,"" Brind'Amour said Friday. ""Let's just leave it at that."" Should Kochetkov be unavailable, then Spencer Martin likely would get the start on Saturday. Aside from replacing Kochetkov on Wednesday, the 29-year-old has started only one game this season, a loss to the Colorado Avalanche on Nov. 9. Overall, he has allowed six goals on 31 shots. Those are not the only injuries Carolina must overcome. Forward Seth Jarvis missed the games in Las Vegas and Utah with an upper-body injury, and the 22-year-old, who logged 33 goals and 34 assists last season, may not return to the ice until sometime next week. The Hurricanes, who had won eight straight games before the three-game trip, have been carried by Martin Necas in the first month. The 25-year-old center leads the team with 16 assists and 25 points, and he and Jack Roslovic share the team lead with nine goals. Necas enters play Saturday with a career-best 11-game point streak during which he has eight goals and 14 assists. Ottawa saw its modest two-game winning streak end Thursday with a 5-4 overtime loss to the visiting Philadelphia Flyers. The Senators led 4-2 midway through the third period before giving up two goals in a span of 2:03. Matvei Michkov netted the game-winner for the Flyers with 55 seconds left in the three-on-three extra session. Even though the Senators squandered a late advantage, coach Travis Green had few qualms with how his team played. ""We've been playing well here for three games, and you hate to lose a game like that where you dominated in a lot of areas for most of the night,"" Green said. The Senators, whose 16 power-play goals are tied for fourth in the league, converted on 2-of-6 chances with the man advantage against the Flyers. Tim Stutzle, who leads the team with 21 points, tallied an assist. The 22-year-old left winger has recorded at least one point in five of his past six games and in 13 of 16 contests this season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

The second-year player will draw plenty of attention as many of his family and friends are expected to be in attendance, judging from all the requests for tickets. ""Nothing crazy, but I'll be paying to play for a day,"" he said, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Bedard, the 2023 first overall draft pick and last season's Calder Trophy winner as rookie of the year, missed his team's lone visit to Vancouver last season due to a broken jaw. A return to his hometown might spark the 19-year-old forward. In 17 games this season, Bedard has netted only three goals and 13 points. He has just one assist in his past four games and hasn't scored a goal in the past eight games. ""Lately, I've just been less of an impact and not really making a difference,"" he said this week, according to The Hockey News. ""Hopefully, I can contribute more."" The Blackhawks are coming off a 3-1 loss to the Seattle Kraken on Thursday and have managed only one victory in their past four games. Chicago was outplayed through the first two periods but stayed within striking distance until a late empty-net goal sealed its fate. Yet nobody was kidding themselves. ""It's disappointing,"" Chicago forward Nick Foligno said. ""We talked about it. They start fast, too, and we just didn't have an answer for that, and that's disappointing. ""I guess you could say our legs were there in the third. We were hanging around, hanging around, the game was almost waiting for us to take it over, and we just didn't."" The Canucks are back in action after yet another lackluster performance at home. After their 5-2 loss to the New York Islanders on Thursday, Vancouver has managed only two wins at home (2-3-3) yet has won six of seven road games. The Canucks scored first against the Islanders but surrendered five consecutive goals, which left Vancouver coach Rick Tocchet apologizing to the fans. ""We're not playing good enough at home. It's on me,"" Tocchet said. ""Guys played light (Thursday). I thought we were ready to go. We weren't. It's on me."" Whether the coach or the players deserve the most blame is a debate, but something must change soon.  Even with Dakota Joshua returning to the lineup after being diagnosed with testicular cancer in the summer and 2022 first-round draft pick Jonathan Lekkerimaki opening the scoring, his first NHL goal in his second career game, the Canucks faltered and have now lost two of three games to kick off a six-game homestand. ""We're going to lose games. We can't win all 82, so it's normal to lose games,"" defenseman Vincent Desharnais said. ""But it's not normal to lose games like we're doing right now. We're letting our goalies down. We're not playing to our standards right now. We have a big stretch of games coming, and we've got to figure it out."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

A Saturday night matchup between the Minnesota Wild and Dallas Stars in St. Paul, Minn., is one such game that commands extra attention. That is true not only for the fans of the Central Division rivals but also for the players. ""Measuring-stick game,"" Wild forward Marcus Foligno said. ""It's like playing against Florida or Tampa. You've just got to ... be patient, be smart. We know last year was not a lot of fun against these guys, so we've got to try to make amends for that."" Both teams have enjoyed hot starts to the season. The Wild have earned at least one point in 14 of their first 16 games, and the Stars have won 10 of their first 15. Dallas is coming off back-to-back wins against the Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins, whom they outscored by a combined margin of 14-3. Evgenii Dadonov made a penalty shot in the Stars' latest victory. It marked his fourth successful penalty-shot goal in five attempts in his career. ""That shows you how deep our team is,"" Stars forward Tyler Seguin said. ""He can't crack the top couple of shootouts. We might need to get him out there."" Kirill Kaprizov leads the Wild with 30 points (10 goals, 20 assists) in 16 games. Matt Boldy ranks second on the team with 17 points (10 G, 7 A) in 16 games. The Stars' top scorer is Matt Duchene, who has 20 points (9 G, 11 A) in 15 games. Mason Marchment is second with 15 points (4 G, 11 A) in 14 games. Seguin, who is fourth on the Stars with 13 points (7 G, 6 A) in 11 games, picked up two assists in the Stars' most recent game against the Bruins. ""This is a hard league to score in -- and to score at the rate he's scored at,"" Stars coach Peter DeBoer said. ""I like the way he's getting his points right now. He's just playing honest."" Wild goaltender Filip Gustavsson is expected to make the start Saturday against Dallas' high-scoring attack. Gustavsson is 8-2-2 with a 2.08 goals-against average and a .924 save percentage this season, and is coming off a shutout victory against the Montreal Canadiens on Thursday night. In four career games against Dallas, Gustavsson is 3-1-0 with a 1.73 GAA and a .950 save percentage. The Stars are expected to counter with Jake Oettinger in net. The 25-year-old Oettinger, who grew up in nearby Lakeville, Minn., is 8-3-0 with a 2.39 GAA and .914 save percentage.

Paul (11-1, 7 KOs) finished with an 78-18 edge in punches connected against the 58-year-old former world champion. With Paul clearly ahead, the final round turned into a victory lap. A smattering of boos could be heard throughout the arena as both men embraced one another before the judges' decision was announced. Round 1 saw a quick pace from both men. While there were clinching sessions at times, Paul got the better of the exchanges but didn't stun Tyson. The second round was similar, but Tyson's volume began to pick up. Paul started throwing more power shots, but Tyson remained in survival mode again. Heavy, deep breaths began to set in as a crowd of 65,000 looked on. Paul's most dominant round was the third. A right-hand, left-hook combination stunned Tyson and put him on wobbly legs. It was unclear whether Paul's gas tank was emptied, but Paul had the upper hand despite finishing 1-for-11 on power shots. The pace slowed in the fourth round, but Paul kept the pressure on Tyson, who couldn't provide volume in return. Round 5 saw Tyson fight more conservatively. It didn't faze Paul, as he kept firing off left hooks and right hands. Tyson's chin held up well, but it didn't translate to a faster pace, let alone a potential knockout. Tyson was visibly slower in the sixth round, taking several Paul shots. The seventh round was more of the same as the sixth. Tyson gasped for air as Paul picked intelligent shots. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

Blake Coleman also scored for Calgary, which has only one regulation loss in its last six games. Goalie Juuse Saros stopped 31 shots for the Predators, who have only one win in their last seven games. Miromanov finally opened the scoring at 6:38 of the third period with his first goal of the season. After Nazem Kadri cleanly won an offensive-zone faceoff to the point, Miromanov headed down the right wing for a pass from MacKenzie Weegar, after which he lifted a top-shelf shot to snap a 22-game goal-scoring drought. Coleman secured the victory by potting an empty-net goal with 69 seconds remaining in regulation, his fourth tally of the campaign. The low-scoring affair was between a pair of clubs who are struggling offensively, but the goaltenders did a strong job of keeping the puck out of the nets. Saros was especially key when he denied Matt Coronato late in the second period. He denied Coleman during a two-man breakaway shortly after Calgary opened the scoring. Wolf was the busier of the two twine-minders in terms of high-danger chances. The rookie NHLer who twice was named the AHL's top puck-stopper showed he was up to the challenge from the start. In the first period, he robbed Steven Stamkos and then both Cole Smith and Gustav Nyquist on bang-bang chances in the middle of the opening frame. Wolf also blanked Jonathan Marchessault midway through the second period.

Arizona, which trailed by 18 late in the first half, pulled even at 65-65 with 14:13 remaining in the game. The Badgers (4-0) answered with a 10-3 run, going in front 75-68 on Tonje's deep 3-pointer from the top left. John Blackwell's free throw put Wisconsin up 86-74. Tonje's three-point play extended the lead to 99-84 with just over four minutes remaining. Tonje, a 6-foot-5 guard who was limited to eight games at Missouri last season due to injuries, hit 8 of 14 field-goal attempts, including 4 of 6 beyond the arc, and 21 of 22 free-throw attempts. Tonje's previous career high was 31 points for Colorado State against Oral Roberts in 2021. Blackwell added 14 points and Max Klesmit had 13 for Wisconsin, which hit 41 of 47 free-throw attempts. Jaden Bradley had 22 points, Trey Townsend 17 and KJ Lewis 15 for Arizona (2-1), which had allowed just 108 points combined in its two victories. The Badgers' advantage at the free-throw line offset the Wildcats' 52-28 edge on the boards and a 24-5 margin in second-chance points. Wisconsin hit 12 of 27 3-point attempts (44.4 percent), while Arizona was just 4 of 23 (17.4 percent) from deep. Wisconsin sank 23 of 26 free throws in the first half en route to a 55-44 lead at the break. Tonje had 22 points in the first half, and he was 13-for-13 from the line. Xavier Amos hit a 3-pointer to put Wisconsin up 49-31 with 5:05 left in the half, but the Wildcats answered with an 11-point run, pulling within 49-42 on a free throw by Carter Bryant. Wisconsin got an early seven-point run when Caleb Love was assessed a technical foul for pushing Blackwell after a foul. The Badgers hit four free throws, then Blackwell hit a 3-pointer on the retained possession to build a 16-8 lead. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

The Flyers opened their campaign 1-5-1 while the Sabres started 1-4-1. But they've both turned things around and are playing their best hockey of the season recently. Philadelphia is 3-0-1 in its last four games and Buffalo is 4-1-0 in its last five. Both sides used a third-period comeback to win in overtime in their most recent games. Philadelphia trailed the Ottawa Senators 4-2 with under 10 minutes to play Thursday before Anthony Richard and Bobby Brink found the net to force overtime. Matvei Michkov played the hero in OT, helping Philadelphia win a game after struggling early on. ""It's the National Hockey League at its best,"" Flyers coach John Tortorella said. ""You play as bad as we did and then come out a winner. I just ... I have no idea."" Michkov became the youngest player in Flyers history to score an overtime goal. It's the second straight clutch performance from the 19-year-old Russian, who was a healthy scratch in each of the previous two games. Travis Sanheim contributed a goal and two assists for Philadelphia, which knows it must play better in Saturday's opener of a five-game homestand. ""It's obviously not our best,"" Sanheim said of the win over Ottawa. ""I think any time you can get two points out of not playing a good hockey game, you'll take it and move on. We'll get ready for a homestand that we've got to be good at. It's learning lessons, areas we need to be better at."" Ivan Fedotov recorded the win for the Flyers, but the team will likely turn back to Samuel Ersson in net against a Buffalo team that enters with plenty of momentum. The Sabres were down a goal against the St. Louis Blues with less than eight minutes to play Thursday when Alex Tuch's equalizer sent the game to overtime. Rasmus Dahlin's deciding goal sent the fans home happy. Buffalo earned their first overtime win of the season despite playing without leading goal scorer Tage Thompson and starting goalie Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen. Both missed the contest and are considered day-to-day with undisclosed injuries. ""Good response,"" Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said. ""Again, you've got to be able to overcome tough moments."" Ruff was particularly pleased with the way Ryan McLeod (one goal, one assist) raised his game with Thompson, whose 11 goals are tied for sixth in the NHL entering Friday, out of the lineup. ""I thought he stepped up the way we needed,"" Ruff said. ""It was the next man's opportunity, and he took advantage of it."" The Sabres will hope for more of that in Saturday's matchup against a team following a similar path in the opening months of the season. ""It was not pretty today, but we found a way,"" Dahlin said after beating St. Louis. ""That's what good teams do. I think it was a really mature game by us. So, I'm really happy about the effort by everybody."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

The contest is the first of a home-and-home series between the teams. They'll face off again in Winnipeg on Tuesday night.  The Jets saw their seven-game winning streak come to an end with a 4-1 loss to the host Tampa Bay Lightning on Thursday. That marked the first road loss of the season and just the Jets' second of the season through 17 games. ""End of the day, they were on a mission and they were not going to let us get into our game, and that's a good lesson for us,"" Jets coach Scott Arniel said of the Lightning. ""We know how we have to continue to play, we know what helps us have success, and just get back to it."" Captain Adam Lowry scored in the second period on Thursday to trim Winnipeg's deficit to 3-1. But the Jets couldn't find the net again and saw their franchise-best seven-game road winning streak snapped as well. Kyle Connor, who leads the team in goals (11) and points (22), was held off the scoresheet for the fourth time in his last five games. Mark Scheifele and Gabriel Vilardi saw their respective eight-game point streaks come to an end on Thursday. Winnipeg defenseman Josh Morrissey, who leads the team in assists (15), is expected to play in his 600th career NHL game on Saturday. ""Every time you get another 100 games, it's a cool moment,"" Morrissey said on Friday. ""It's cool to be coming up on 600. It goes by fast. You hear everybody say that. A lot of great memories, and it feels like I'm just getting going."" Like the Jets, Florida has endured a bit of turbulence after a stellar start. The Panthers had won a season-high seven in a row before dropping 4-1 and 6-2 decisions to the New Jersey Devils, both games in Sunrise. ""We haven't loved our last two,"" Florida head coach Paul Maurice said following Thursday's loss. ""You are not going to love them all."" Sam Reinhart scored in both contests, giving him eight goals in his last eight games and a team-leading 13 for the season. He also has 13 points (eight goals, five assists) during his nine-game point streak. Captain Aleksander Barkov extended his point streak to seven games (two goals, 11 assists) on Thursday but was in no mood to celebrate. ""In both games, they played really good offensively and we couldn't get our offense going at all,"" Barkov said. ""We're not happy at all with the past two games, especially this one. We just have to learn from it and move on."" Barkov added that the defending champions won't underestimate the Jets. ""We know who's coming into town, the best team in the league right now playing unbelievable hockey,"" Barkov said. ""We got to be ready right away."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

After reaching the milestone Thursday night by cooling off the Winnipeg Jets, the NHL's hottest and best club, the goaltender will likely start again at home searching for No. 301 on Saturday night against the visiting New Jersey Devils. Tampa Bay never trailed in the 4-1 win against Winnipeg, a team that had won its previous seven games and outscored opponents 33-12 in that span. The Lightning kept the best power-play unit in the NHL scoreless in five tries and did so without top center Brayden Point, who missed his third consecutive game with a lower-body injury. Captain Victor Hedman moved into second place on the franchise's all-time assist list, dishing out No. 583 and inching him within five of legendary playmaker Martin St. Louis' 588. Anthony Cirelli scored his 100th career goal and Brandon Hagel netted one in his 200th game wearing a Lightning jersey. But the night belonged to Vasilevskiy, the backstop the club affectionately calls ""The Big Cat,"" who became the fastest player to reach the victory total in NHL history.  The 2019 Vezina Trophy winner did it in 490 career games, 31 fewer than previous record-holder Jacques Plante.  ""How do you become the best?"" said Lightning coach Jon Cooper, whose club broke a four-game losing streak. ""You are put in the big moments at the big times and you deliver time and time again. ""To do what he's done and get 300 wins in the time he accomplished that, along the way winning the Vezina and two Stanley Cups and participating in four Finals, I'm not sure what else you could say about the man."" After a 1-0 home loss to the San Jose Sharks on Sunday, New Jersey headed on a three-game road trip in Florida. In a rare two-game stop against the same team in three days, the Devils defeated the defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers 4-1 on Tuesday and 6-2 on Thursday. New Jersey has won five of its past six games, including four road matchups, ahead of its matchup in Tampa on Saturday. In the two wins against the Panthers, the Devils took early leads before pulling away. Jacob Markstrom, who was selected in the second round in 2008 by Florida, starred in goal Tuesday, making 34 saves. Jesper Bratt recorded his second career hat trick Thursday after his two-assist performance in the first win over the Panthers. ""We won the (first game) by playing really, really good defensively and capitalized on our chances,"" Bratt said after his three-goal outing. ""We took a little more command of the game offensively (tonight). We played a little more with the puck and had more time in the (offensive) zone. ""I think we took a step as a group and built some character. We're playing another really good team (in Tampa)."" Tampa Bay won the last matchup between the teams, earning an 8-5 victory in New Jersey on Oct. 22. The Lightning have won eight of the past nine games in the series.  After their game Saturday, the teams will complete their season series Jan. 11 in New Jersey. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

The 23rd-ranked Aggies (3-1) won their third consecutive game since a season-opening loss at UCF. The 21st-ranked Buckeyes (2-1) took their first defeat of the season in their second matchup with a Southeastern Conference opponent. Ohio State beat Texas in its season opener on Nov. 4. Bruce Thornton scored 15 points to lead the Buckeyes, but Ohio State buried itself early after abysmal shooting in the first half. Dealing with an aggressive Texas A&M defense, Ohio State shot an awful 7 for 32 (21.9 percent) in the first half and missed 12 of their first 17 shots. The Buckeyes did make 5 of 17 three-pointers to keep the Aggies from running away with the game by intermission. Texas A&M shot only 6 for 25 (24 percent) in the first half. But the Aggies' aggressiveness on offense made a huge difference as they continually earned trips to the free-throw line, and made them count. For the game, Texas A&M made 32 of 40 shots from the line, which doubled the amount of makes for Ohio State, which made 16 of 22. The Buckeyes led only once in the game, when Thornton opened the scoring with a 3-pointer. The Aggies scored the next 12 points and never looked back.

This was their third victory with more than a 25-point margin. DePaul led 37-31 at halftime after trailing 16-9 less than eight minutes into the game. Following the early burst, Duquesne had a stretch in which it scored only two points in more than five minutes. The Blue Demons outscored the Dukes 25-13 across barely more than nine points to begin the second half, with that stretch capped by a Rivera 3-pointer for an 18-point lead. During that span, the Duke went 2 1/2 minutes without scoring, and they couldn't recover. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

Zachary Aston-Reese, Mathieu Olivier, Damon Severson and Cole Sillinger scored the other goals for the Blue Jackets, who snapped a six-game losing streak (0-5-1). Columbus outshot Pittsburgh 39-22, including a lopsided 19-4 margin in the third period. Voronkov, Severson and Sillinger all scored in the final frame, turning the Jackets' narrow 3-2 lead at the second intermission into a comfortable win. Blue Jackets goalie Elvis Merzlikins stopped 21 of 23 shots in his 200th NHL game. Merzlikins' milestone was highlighted by a robbery of a glove save on Anthony Beauvillier late in the second period. The slumping Penguins are 1-3-2 in their past six games and are winless in their past three games (0-2-1). Beauvillier had a goal and an assist, extending his goal streak to three games. Michael Bunting also tallied for Pittsburgh. Tristan Jarry stopped 33 of 37 shots in his first NHL game since Oct. 16. After struggling in his first three NHL outings this season, Jarry was sent to the Penguins' AHL Wilkes-Barre/Scranton affiliate. Aston-Reese gave Columbus an early advantage with a tip-in goal 2:20 into the first period. Werenski scored a power-play marker on another redirection at 8:39 of the first, as his one-timer glanced off Penguins forward Noel Acciari and past Jarry. A fortunate bounce helped Pittsburgh reduce the deficit at 11:51 of the first period. The puck deflected off Sidney Crosby's stick and into the air, falling right at the corner of the net for Beauvillier to deposit his sixth goal of the season. The unconventional assist was the 1016th of Crosby's career, tying the superstar forward with Joe Sakic for 13th on the NHL's all-time list. Both teams scored once in the second period. Bunting's power-play goal equalized for Pittsburgh 12:06 into the frame, but Olivier finished off a three-on-one rush at the 16:27 mark to restore the Blue Jackets' lead for good. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

McDavid reached 1,001 career points when he had a goal and an assist as the Oilers defeated the visiting Nashville Predators 3-2 in overtime on Thursday night. The Oilers captain became the 99th player and the fourth fastest to reach 1,000 points with a second-period goal. He also assisted on Darnell Nurse's overtime winner. McDavid (341 goals, 660 assists) has played 659 games, and at 27 is the fourth-youngest player to hit 1,000 points. Edmonton has won three in a row and five of seven as it starts a three-game Eastern swing.  The Maple Leafs defeated the host Washington Capitals 4-3 in overtime on Wednesday. Toronto will be without Auston Matthews (upper-body injury) for the sixth straight game on Saturday. McDavid was glad to reach his milestone at home. ""Just seeing the way the players reacted means the world to me. It means everything to me,"" McDavid said. ""To hear the fans, that stuff means more to me than any of the numbers. It was a really special moment. ""These milestones are a great time to reflect and look back. It's been a good 10 years and hopefully 10 more good ones. Some of these things have kind of hit me a little more emotionally than I would have thought."" The previous player to reach 1,000 points was Toronto's John Tavares on Dec. 11, 2023, in his 1,109th game. Tavares scored Toronto's overtime winner on Wednesday. Leon Draisaitl, who assisted on McDavid's goal and has factored into 445 of his points, said he would not be surprised if his teammate reached 2,000 points. ""If not him, who else? That is the only question I have,"" Draisaitl said. ""I never bet against Connor McDavid. I have learned that over the last 10 years. It wouldn't surprise me."" The Maple Leafs have won four of their past five games, all without Matthews, who led the league with 69 goals last season. ""No setbacks,"" Toronto coach Craig Berube said on Friday. ""We're doing what we can. We have two games in a long stretch here, so we're just letting him recover."" Toronto does not play again until Wednesday against the visiting Vegas Golden Knights. Max Domi (maintenance) did not take part in practice. Toronto scored twice in the final 4:09 of regulation to force overtime at Washington. It was Toronto's first road win when trailing by more than one goal with fewer than five minutes remaining since Dec. 6, 2010 -- also against the Capitals. ""They just kept working,"" Berube said. ""I mean, we got behind, I get that, but I thought in the second period from the 10-minute mark on, we started to really press and do some real good things in the offensive zone and get some opportunities, and it carried over in the third."" ""We talked about staying with it,"" Tavares said. ""Their lead increased and a couple didn't count, but we found a way. Good character win and bounce-back."" Toronto had two goals called back and Washington had one disallowed. Toronto defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson played in his 1,000th NHL game on Wednesday. Another Toronto defenseman, Jani Hakanpaa (lower-body injury) made his season debut after missing the first 17 games. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

Friday night, 87-74. Clayton scored 16 of his points in the first half, and in the second half, Sam Alexis and Allijah Martin matched Clayton's output with nine points each to close out the game. Martin finished with 17 points and Alexis added 12 to give Florida (4-0) the victory. Florida State (3-1) pushed the tempo late, after going down 15 points with 7:53 remaining, the Seminoles went on a 19-8 run to cut the lead to 77-73 with 2:23 to go. Daquan Davis had nine points in the run for Florida State.  Martin responded, hitting a three-point shot after Thomas Haugh hit two free throws, a bank shot at the end of the shot clock to stake the Gators to a nine-point lead with 1:35 left. What helped the Gators was their work on the boards, with Florida outrebounding the Seminoles 47-29. 34 of their rebounds were defensive. Those rebounds gave the Gators an edge in second chance points, 16-9. Florida needed all of the rebounds too, after having a difficult evening holding onto possession, giving the ball away 19 times (compared to eight turnovers for FSU). The Gators built a 44-31 halftime lead thanks to 7-for-15 shooting from beyond the arc and 55.6 percent shooting overall. The Seminoles were cold, shooting 3-for-9 from 3-point range and 36.4 percent overall. The Noles were down by as many as 18 points with 5:38 remaining in the first half, but the start of the second half saw a renewed energy for the home side and they outscored the Gators 9-5 to bring the deficit to single digits. Jamir Watkins continued leading Florida State in scoring, leading the team with 19 points Friday. Watkins' biggest help came from the bench with Justin Thomas, who scored 11 points on 4-of-6 shooting while going 3-for-3 from deep. The win for Florida is their fourth in a row against the Seminoles, extending the Gators' series lead to 47-28. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-16

Following the 1968 season, Ferrara was chosen in the expansion draft by the Padres and was the prime left fielder for the franchise during their first two seasons. He batted .260 with 14 homers and 56 RBIs in 1969, and hit .277 with 13 homers and 51 RBIs in 1970. He played 138 games both seasons. The Padres traded Ferrara to the Cincinnati Reds in May 1971.

That result may not have seemed particularly likely through the first half of Round 2 after some members of the field completed the first round earlier in the day after a suspension due to darkness Thursday. Lower still began his second round tied for the lead with Hayden Springer and had three birdies over the first five holes before a bogey at No. 9. ""I had a bad break on 6 and 9,"" Lower said. ""To not get the par 5s when they're all kind of reachable other than No. 2 just being into the wind, that part kind of sucks."" But things heated up for Lower at Port Royal Golf Course when he carded birdies on Holes 10, 12, 13 and 14 to stake himself to an eventual two shot-lead over Robby Shelton and Ryan Moore. Most of the field completed the second round before play was suspended due to darkness for a second straight day. Lower still felt he could have finished a little stronger. ""Yeah, it felt good most of the day, pretty solid for the most part,"" Lower said. ""It would have been nice to get one of those last two putts to go in on 17, 18, but still a great round and I'm happy where I'm at."" On Thursday, Springer and Lower shot 6-under-par 65s to grab an early one-shot edge over Patrick Rodgers, Joseph Bramlett and Kevin Dougherty before play was suspended. Springer shot a 1-under 70 to fall off of Lower's pace and fall into a tie for 10th. Rodgers (71), Bramlett (72) and Dougherty (73) also fell behind the leaders. Shelton and Moore, meanwhile, matched Lower on Friday to stay in contention. An eagle on 17 highlighted Shelton's day, and he added five birdies to finish 7-under 64. Moore was a little more up-and-down, with bogeys at 16 and 8 to go along with his eight birdies. ""If you start missing it 20 yards offline here, you can get it in trouble really quick,"" Moore said. ""For me, it's controlling that ball and keeping the misses at least in reasonable places to be able to play. The greens are receptive enough that it's not ideal being in the rough, but you still have a chance to knock it on the green and have a reasonable putt, but it's always better being in the fairway."" Shelton spoke about not looking ahead to the FedExCup rankings and to focus on the moment. ""You know you have to play well and you know that you need to win,"" Shelton said. ""A top-5 would be great, but you're really looking for the win. You're not looking at the cut line, you're going out to win. That should be your mentality every week."" Among those who did not finish the second round, Greyson Sigg is in the top position at 4 under through 16 to tie for sixth place.

Forward Jordan Eberle, the Kraken's captain, will miss at least Saturday's game against the Islanders and Sunday's contest with the Rangers because of a lower-body injury that happened early in the second period of Thursday's 3-1 victory against the visiting Chicago Blackhawks. Kraken coach Dan Bylsma said after practice Friday that Eberle will need additional tests and will be re-evaluated early next week. The addition could come in the form of forward Daniel Sprong, who was re-acquired in a trade with Vancouver a week ago.

However, Sprong hasn't played since Nov. 7 so the Kraken might instead look to their American Hockey League affiliate in Coachella Valley, which is playing this weekend in nearby Abbotsford, B.C. Eberle was injured 13 seconds into the second period Thursday when he slid awkwardly into the end boards after a collision with Blackhawks defenseman Connor Murphy. Eberle made it to the bench on his own bunch hunched over in pain immediately afterward and trainers helped him down the runway toward the locker room. ""We were moving pretty well before (Eberle) got hurt. I think there was a little bit of a step back, obviously, after your captain goes down in a not great way,"" said Kraken forward Matty Beniers, who scored the opening goal later in the period.

The foul in question occurred midway through the third quarter of Friday's 123–118 win by the Golden State Warriors over the Memphis Grizzlies. As Green was driving to the basket, he lost the ball and fell in the lane near Edey's feet. Edey picked up the ball and passed downcourt. But as the rookie attempted to run, Green clamped his left elbow on Edey's right foot, causing him to fall to the floor.

The Patriots confirmed Saturday they've released third-year wideout Tyquan Thornton. ESPN's Adam Schefter first reported the news. Thornton's release ends a disappointing tenure for the 24-year-old, whom Bill Belichick's Patriots selected in the second round (50th overall) of the 2022 NFL Draft. The Baylor product boasts blazing speed (he ran a 4.28-second 40-yard dash at the NFL Combine) but could never translate that to on-field success. Thornton tallied 22 receptions for 247 yards and two touchdowns as a rookie, which would all be career highs; he caught 13 passes for 91 yards over nine games in 2023 and has been an afterthought in the Patriots' 2024 offense, with just four catches for 47 yards in six games played. Thornton is one of several busts from New England's 2022 draft class, Belichick's second-to-last with the franchise. The Patriots selected the 6-foot-2, 185-pound wideout two spots ahead of Pittsburgh Steelers star George Pickens and three spots ahead of Alec Pierce, who had more yards as a rookie for the Indianapolis Colts (593) than Thornton has in his career to date (385). After Thornton's release, the Patriots have just one player from their 10-man 2022 draft class (cornerback Marcus Jones) on their active roster.

Yarnell started the game for Eli Holstein and played well, though he was sacked eight times by Clemson’s defense. Yarnell was 34-of-54 passing for 350 yards and a TD and an interception. Before Klubnik’s run, it looked like he had done enough for the Panthers to pull the upset. Pitt got its go-ahead field goal after stopping Clemson on a fourth-down run. The Pitt defense had dominated against Clemson’s run game … until Klubnik broke the game open. Even with the 50-yard run, Klubnik finished the game with 10 carries for 41 yards (after accounting for sack yardage taken). RB Phil Mafah had 17 yards on 17 carries. The Tigers are now 7-1 in ACC play and 8-2 overall with two non-conference games to go. However, they need a loss from No. 9 Miami or No. 14 SMU if they want to play for the ACC title or some help from Louisville and Georgia Tech. The conference is likely going to come down to the common opponent tiebreaker and Louisville has two conference losses to Georgia Tech’s three. Assuming the Cardinals stay ahead of the Yellow Jackets in the standings, Clemson would be on the wrong side of a head-to-head tiebreaker against Miami or a three-way tiebreaker against both Miami and SMU because both the Hurricanes and Mustangs beat the Cardinals and Clemson did not. To avoid that scenario and make the ACC title game, Clemson needs to end up in a two-way tie for first-place, finish in a solo second or have Georgia Tech pass Louisville in the conference standings to change the common opponent tiebreaker with Miami. Got all that? Good. There’s still a lot to play for in the ACC over the final two weeks of the season. And all Clemson can do is watch the results from everyone else.",2024-11-16

NASCAR has dropped a clause from its charter deal that would have prevented the teams from running as open teams next season because they brought legal action against the sanctioning body. Neither team has signed the charter agreement with the sanctioning body and have filed an antitrust lawsuit against NASCAR accusing it of monopolistic practices. “We are pleased to announce that NASCAR has removed the anticompetitive release requirement in its open agreement, which will now allow 23XI and Front Row Motorsports to race as open teams in 2025,” attorney Jeffrey Kessler said in a statement. “My clients will continue their appeal to the 4th Circuit to issue an injunction so that they can run as chartered teams therefore avoiding irreparable harm.” “Both race teams are pleased that they will continue to be a participant in this sport that they love while fighting to make it fair and just for all.” The teams’ initial request for an injunction was denied last week. The two teams are appealing the ruling as they ask to compete as chartered teams next season while the lawsuit proceeds. Chartered teams are guaranteed entries into every race on the Cup Series schedule and get a larger share of purse money than open teams do. The two teams were the only ones to not sign NASCAR’s new charter agreement. The previous agreement expired at the end of the 2024 season. The teams have called NASCAR “monopolistic bullies” and 23XI Racing co-owner Denny Hamlin had said that NASCAR’s offers to teams had not improved over the course of the season. Both teams competed as two-car entries in 2024. 23XI Racing fielded cars for Bubba Wallace and Tyler Reddick, while Front Row had cars for Michael McDowell and Todd Gilliland. While the removal of the clause means that both teams will at least be able to attempt the Daytona 500 without a guaranteed starting spot, the fates of their potential charter deals for third cars are still unknown. Stewart-Haas Racing closed down at the end of the 2024 season and had an agreement to sell a charter to each team. If both 23XI and FRM compete as open teams in 2025, it’s unclear who will own the charters if the deal doesn’t go through.",2024-11-16

The school announced Saturday morning that it had signed its first-year coach to an eight-year contract extension. Cignetti was hired from James Madison over the offseason and the No. 5 Hoosiers are 10-0 with two games remaining in the regular season. Cignetti will receive $8 million per season in a deal that basically doubles the per-year salary of his initial deal. ""Since arriving on campus, Coach Cignetti has been the architect of one of college football's greatest turnarounds and has shown the world that IU is also a football school,"" Indiana president Pamela Whitten said in a statement. ""Coach Cignetti exemplifies IU's goal to win in all that we do. The success he has brought to Indiana football is shining a light on all that is amazing about Indiana University. We are excited that Coach Cignetti and his wonderful family will be a part of the Hoosier Nation for many years to come."" Indiana has been the biggest surprise of the 2024 college football season so far. The Hoosiers can clinch a spot in the Big Ten title game with a win at Ohio State on Nov. 23. Indiana has never played in the Big Ten championship game. And the Hoosiers had never won 10 games in a single season until 2024. Cignetti overhauled the roster through the transfer portal in the offseason. The group of new players included quarterback Kurtis Rourke from Ohio. Rourke has completed nearly 72% of his passes for over 2,400 yards so far and is averaging just over 10 yards per throw. He’s also thrown just four interceptions to 21 TD passes. The Hoosiers’ success this season also means Cignetti’s remarkable coaching streak continues. He has never coached a team with a losing record since becoming a college football head coach in 2011. Cignetti was hired by IUP 13 years ago and went 53-17 with the Crimson Hawks. He was then 14-9 in two seasons at Elon before taking over at James Madison in 2019. The Dukes were 33-5 in three seasons at the FCS level and made the semifinals in each of those seasons. James Madison moved up to the top level of college football in 2022 and promptly went 8-3, though it was ineligible for a bowl game.

Hull, who won in Saudi Arabia two weeks ago to end a two-year winless drought, pulled away with three birdies in a five-hole stretch on the back nine at Pelican Golf Club. Korda, playing for the first time in nearly two months because of a minor neck injury, started with a bogey and finished with back-to-back birdies in her round of 68. She was two shots behind and will be in the final group with Hull. As for that holiday? Turns out Hull made a bet with her boyfriend that she could add one extra day to her vacation to Europe for every round she makes five birdies. She made seven birdies Thursday. “I played pretty solid,” Hull said. “It was quite windy, so quite tricky. Yeah, made five birdies today so extra day on holiday.” Alexa Pano made nine birdies before her round ended with a double bogey. It still was good enough for a 64 that left her three shots behind, along with Jin Hee Im (65), Wichanee Meechai (66) and Mi Hyang Lee (68). Pano is at No. 66 in the Race to CME Globe. This is the final tournament to be among the top 60 who qualify for the CME Group Tour Championship next week, where the winner of the season finale gets $4 million. Lee is at No. 59 and took a big step toward making sure she is down the Gulf coast in Naples. But the attention for the weekend is at the top — Hull, the carefree character from England who has found a big dose of confidence, and Korda, the best in women’s golf who took time to join other athletes posing for the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. “I always enjoy playing with Charley. She’s always a fun time. Hopefully, we give a good show,” Korda said. Hull was at 10-under 130. The wind was strong enough that Korda’s main goal was to try to keep her shots pin-high. Add that to slick greens, and she did well for another 66. “They’re slick, yeah. It’s like putting on ice almost,” Korda said. “They’re doing a really good job with the golf course, especially with the wind and how slick the greens are. I feel like when the greens get that firm and fast the wind actually plays a bigger role in the putts because it seems to just kind of play with the putt a little bit more.” Gabby Lopez of Mexico came into the week at No. 61 in the Race to CME Globe and posted a 66 to join the group in a tie for eighth at 5-under 135, five shots behind. Also at 135 was Carlota Ciganda, a Solheim Cup regular from Spain who is at No. 63. Also at stake this week is keeping a full LPGA card for the 100. Yuri Yoshida came into the week at No. 100 and missed the cut.

The incident happened at Estadio Francisco Morazán in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, as Aguirre, 65, was approaching Honduras manager Reinaldo Rueda for a post-match handshake. Here’s the video. Great night for Honduras marred - once again - by bad fan behavior.We’ve gotten too used to fans chucking things. It shouldn’t take this for the culture to shift, but here’s a wake-up call.https://t.co/2eiXvBN168 — Jon Arnold (@ArnoldcommaJon) November 16, 2024 ""Nothing, nothing, it's football,"" Aguirre said of being hit with a beer can that ended up bloodying him. ""They deserved to win, they were better than us in areas, I've got nothing left but to congratulate them, and well, to try to lift my team's spirit. The other thing, there's no point in even mentioning it because well, it's football, I'm not one to complain."" Said Rueda of what happened, ""I’m sad about what happened at the end. That truly can’t ever happen again, here or in any other stadium in Honduras or any stadium in the world. “I’m sad because he’s a human being, because just like they hit [Aguirre], they could’ve hit me. That’s something that can’t happen, we send our apologies to Mexico, its people and Aguirre. The party gets damaged, all the efforts our players made on the pitch get tarnished. Something like this happening is regrettable.” Mexico's soccer federation condemned the actions in a statement released after the game. ""The FMF unequivocally condemns the acts of violence that occurred tonight at the Francisco Morazán stadium in San Pedro Sula, Honduras. Such behavior has no place in our sport. ""We demand that CONCACAF take immediate and decisive action to address this matter in accordance with its regulations. Soccer should be a celebration, not a battleground. We urge all parties, including institutions, managers, players, fans, and the media, to work together to create a safe and respectful environment for everyone involved."" CONCACAF has begun an investigation and referred the incident to the CONCACAF Disciplinary Committee for further review. After losing the first leg, Mexico needs to score at least twice in Tuesday's second leg at home to have a a chance to move on to the semifinal round in March. Nations League utilizes away goals as a tiebreaker in this stage of the competition.",2024-11-16

Iamaleava missed the second half of the Vols’ win over Mississippi State in Week 11. On Monday, Tennessee coach Josh Heupel said Iamaleava would be good to go for the weekend. But he needed to get through concussion protocol, a development that became public Tuesday. Iamaleava is 144-of-221 passing for 1,879 yards and has thrown 11 TDs to four interceptions this season. He began the season as a Heisman Trophy favorite, though he’s fallen from that race as Tennessee’s offense has struggled to find explosive plays during its SEC slate. Had Iamaleava missed Saturday’s game, Gaston Moore would have been in line to make his first start. Moore replaced Iamaleava in the second half against Mississippi State and was 5-of-8 passing for 38 yards. Georgia is likely playing for its College Football Playoff life Saturday night. The Bulldogs fell to the first team out of the 12-team bracket in Tuesday’s rankings and would fall further with a third loss. With games remaining against UMass and Georgia Tech, it would seem unlikely that Georgia could get into the playoff at 9-3. Tennessee, meanwhile, may have a path to the playoff even if it loses on Saturday night. The Vols could finish the season at 10-2 with wins over UTEP and Vanderbilt to end the season. That could be good enough to sneak into the field depending on how the rest of the conference shakes out.",2024-11-16

Defensive end Yetur Gross-Matos was activated off the injured reserve list and is expected to play Sunday after missing the last five games with a knee injury that required surgery. It was the same knee he injured during the preseason. Punter Mitch Wishnowsky is headed to injured reserve with a back injury. It’s an injury that coach Kyle Shanahan said flared up earlier in the week and “bothered him a ton” dating back to training camp. San Francisco also promoted punter Pat O'Donnell from the practice squad to fill in for Wishnowsky (back). Veteran safety Tashaun Gipson and cornerback Nick McCloud also were activated from the team's practice squad (standard elevations). Meanwhile, cornerback Darrell Luter Jr. also was placed on the injured reserve list, and offensive lineman Jon Feliciano's game status for Sunday have been downgraded from questionable to out.

The air in the building throughout Klay Thompson’s return was that of an NBA playoff atmosphere. The mood Friday night buffered as often as millions streaming a spectacle of a 58-year-old pigeon fiend fighting a cartoon character cosplaying as a boxer. A letdown game certainly was on the table. Instead, the Warriors fought off early shooting struggles and outlasted the Ja Morant-less Memphis Grizzlies, 123-118. Steph Curry in his previous two games scored a total of 73 points and made 12 3-pointers. The Grizzlies made it a point to face-guard Curry wherever he went, which led to him scoring just 13 points in 26 minutes. Curry only took nine shots, going 4 of 9 overall and 3 of 7 on threes. But he did add eight rebounds, five assists and four steals. Steph pulls up and walks it in 🔥 pic.twitter.com/9nKYXmKYJO — Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) November 16, 2024 As the Warriors made 19 threes and had a 41.3 3-point percentage, the Grizzlies only made seven, with a lowly 16.7 3-point percentage. The Warriors also won the bench battle, 67-61. Here are three takeaways from the Warriors improving to 10-2, as well as 2-0 in the NBA Cup. On a night where Curry isn’t an inferno, every point counts. Especially from Draymond Green, and even more so behind the 3-point line. Green missed his first two 3-point attempts in the first quarter and didn’t try once in the second. But in the third, he connected on 2 of 4 shots from long distance. That isn’t exactly a heater, but historically it is a big deal for Green and Golden State as a whole. Dray for trey 3️⃣ pic.twitter.com/PV8fFUr2mn — Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) November 16, 2024 Back-to-back threes early in the third quarter by Green gave the Warriors an 11-point lead on both makes. It also pushed his streak of hitting multiple threes to four consecutive games, matching a career high. How big of a deal is that? The Warriors now are 140-30 all time in the regular season when he makes two or more 3-pointers in a game. This past season, Green shot a career-high 39.5 percent on 3-pointers. After going 3 of 7 against the Grizzlies, Green now is shooting 45.2 percent beyond the arc this season, making 19 of 42 attempts. The Warriors on Thursday received a blow from the injury bug when it was announced De’Anthony Melton sustained a sprained left ACL. Coach Steve Kerr in his pregame press conference said there still isn’t a timetable for Melton’s return, but he’s expected to miss at least a chunk of games. Then during the second quarter Friday night, the Warriors again were bitten by the pest of an injury. Lindy Waters III received his second start of the season, stepping in for Melton, and scored five points in the first quarter. His 3-pointer from the corner marked the Warriors’ first three points of the night. Waters has his shot flowing early 💦 pic.twitter.com/FT9UDxSfwN — Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) November 16, 2024 With two minutes remaining in the first half, Waters was up to eight points and had made two threes. He also had a great block, but the result saw him on the ground and out for the game. Waters jumped off two feet to meet Santi Aldama at the rim to block him off the backboard. But when he landed, Waters’ left leg buckled and he immediately grabbed his left knee. Waters rolled on the floor to get out of the play while writhing in pain. After being down for a little while and being tended to by trainers, Waters got up and jogged down the tunnel without assistance, but with a slight limp. During halftime, the Warriors announced he was out for the rest of the game with what was diagnosed as a left knee hyperextension. Brandin Podziemski started the second half in Waters’ place. Scratch that. Play of the year? From a purely highlight standpoint, it has to be. Heart and hustle with eyes in the back of his head. Podziemski displayed all three in a play that seemed too good to be true. Words don’t do it justice. Watch and do your best to keep your jaw from hitting the floor. WHAT A PASS FROM PODZ 🤯 pic.twitter.com/6GSOAIlTFB — Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) November 16, 2024 What started with Jonathan Kuminga jabbing away a Grizzlies pass attempt ended with him throwing down a dunk on the run for two points. In the middle was one of the more impressive passes by anyone in the entire NBA. Not only did Podziemski run into the first row of fans to keep the play alive, he used his non-dominant right hand to whip a pass behind his back, somehow delivering it in stride for Kuminga, who caught the ball off one bounce and quickly leapt to dunk over former Defensive Player of the Year Jaren Jackson Jr. The start to the season has been less than ideal for Podziemski. That play also is a direct example of the energy he always brings whenever his name is called. Download and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast",2024-11-16

The 18th-ranked Hatton’s general unhappiness with his game in Dubai this week boiled over during the third round of the season-ending tournament at the Earth Course. It started in ignominious fashion when he lazily attempted to tap in from barely a foot for par at the fourth hole — only for the ball to strike the back of the cup and lip out — and finished when he threw his ball toward the water guarding the green at No. 18 after completing his round. In between those incidents, the most grievous example of Hatton’s poor behavior came at No. 14 when he pulled his third shot at the par-5 No. 14 and pressed his iron so hard into the ground that it snapped. Ewen Murray , a commentator on British broadcaster Sky Sports, reacted by saying: “It’s time for change, I’m afraid. That’s a terrible influence on the next generation.” Earlier, Hatton angrily took a swipe at a divot after missing the green with his approach to No. 8. And his behavior became more erratic on the 11th when, after missing a five-foot putt for birdie, he slammed his putter down on the green and repeatedly swore in comments picked up on TV. He was heard cursing again on the 13th after his tee shot settled on the fringe. After the round, the European tour confirmed Hatton’s behavior breached its code of conduct. “He will be fined as a result,” the tour said. Hatton started the third round one shot off the lead and ended it three back from joint leaders Rory McIlroy, Rasmus Hojgaard and Antoine Rozner.

	Netflix had its first live boxing event on Friday night (Nov. 15) with a card headlined by the Jake Paul, 27, and Mike Tyson, 58—the widest age disparity in sanctioned boxing history. And the generation divide wasn’t the only stark distinction between the two men. 
	Jake Paul came out to to the ring to Phil Collins’ “In The Air Tonight,” riding in a customized low-rider with his brother Logan Paul. The entrance was jam-packed with thinly veiled jabs at Tyson, with the song referencing the boxer’s appearance in The Hangover, and even a bird, referencing the “Now Kith” meme. Tyson, however, walked out to the ring with pure intention of throwing down and nothing more. And all the built-up tension was released as the two combatants entered the ring for the highly-anticipated showdown. 
	While both Tyson and Paul promised to knock the other boxer out before the 5th round, the match surprisingly went for the entire eight rounds. Tyson came out swinging for the first two rounds but Father Time quickly got Iron Mike together, as the icon began to slow down with each subsequent round. Paul kept to a moderate pace throughout the whole match.

	Jake Paul’s even-keeled strategy allowed him to drastically out-punch Tyson throughout the match. By round four, Tyson’s legs looked tired and shaky, which were tell-tale signs of exhaustion for a boxer. 
	As the fight ended in round 8, Jake Paul began bowing to Mike Tyson out of respect for “being an all-time great in this sport” and for “all that he’s done to allow us to be here.” Tyson kept his guard up but gave Paul some dap as he realized the fight was over.

Anthony expressed that the national spotlight would benefit both him and the rest of his teammates who are looking to restore Syracuse to greatness and possible futures in the NBA. “All that played a part into why I chose Syracuse,” Kiyan said on the podcast.

And then, in a moment of unbridled competitive adrenaline, all of Fleming's teammates, including players Brooke Slusser, Chandler Manusky and others listed on the lawsuit, quickly jumped into the group celebration.  Slusser and Manusky have alleged Fleming conspired with Colorado State's Malaya Jones to have Slusser spiked in the face in the first meeting between the two teams Oct. 3, according to the lawsuit.  ""Manusky said that at Jones’ residence Fleming had shared with Jones the scouting for the CSU-FC game and they had discussed Fleming ‘throw[ing] the game’ and how they would set up Jones to ‘blow up’ Slusser and ‘blast’ her in the face during the game,"" the court documents state.  ""Manusky also said that Fleming stated, ‘I’m going to leave center court open,’ which would allow Malaya Jones to have a wide open shot to try to ‘blow up Slusser,’ i.e., to try to hit Brooke Slusser in the face with the ball."" Slusser appeared on Fox News Channel's ""The Inghram Angle"" Friday night to further speak out against Fleming's presence on the team and the university and Mountain West for enabling it.  Blaire Fleming, a redshirt senior at San Jose State University, plays as an outside and right-side hitter on the women’s volleyball team. (San Jose State University) ""After finding out that they had planned to give each other our scouting reports and leave the block down so the ball could easily be swung at me during the game, it was astonishing for me to find that information out. It was incredibly insane,"" Slusser said.  One day later, Slusser and Fleming, two seniors, appeared on the court for the team's senior day and played like normal volleyball teammates. Fleming was even cheered loudly by the San Jose State crowd during the senior day ceremony.  Fans in the audience held posters that said ""dare to struggle, dare to win,"" and ""block out the haters.""  Despite suing over alleged danger and unfair advantages over Fleming's presence on the team, Slusser and Manusky contributed to a game plan that was based on setting up Fleming to deliver powerful spikes.  INSIDE SAN JOSE STATE'S POLICE BATTLE TO PROTECT WOMEN'S ATHLETES THREATENED BY A TRANSGENDER CULTURE WAR Fleming led the game with 24 kills, 56 total attacks and 10 errors. Fleming fell one kill shy of tying a career high.  Slusser previously joined a lawsuit earlier this year, headed by former college swimmer Riley Gaines, against the NCAA over the association's policies on gender identity that allowed Fleming to join the team without the other players knowing the athlete's natural birth sex. ""Brooke estimates that Fleming’s spikes were traveling upward of 80 mph, which was faster than she had ever seen a woman hit a volleyball,"" Slusser’s complaint states. ""The girls were doing everything they could to dodge Fleming’s spikes but still could not fully protect themselves."" Fleming previously set a single-game record at John Champe High School with 30 kills in a match and a single-season record of 266 kills for the school's girls volleyball team. Footage from the athlete's Hudl page of the school-record 30-kill match in September 2019 shows how hard and fast Fleming's spikes came down at the high school level against female opponents. President Trump even went out of his way to comment about footage of one of Fleming's plays in which the player spiked a ball at San Diego State player Keira Herron in a match earlier this season. ""I saw the slam. It was a slam. I never saw a ball hit so hard,"" Trump said during a Fox News town hall. ""But other people, even in volleyball, they’ve been permanently — I mean, they've been really hurt badly. Women playing men."" The most recent lawsuit, which is filed against San Jose State and the Mountain West Conference, alleges other players were passed over for scholarships in favor of Fleming. Fleming received a full scholarship, while a biological female, Alyssa Sugai, did not receive a scholarship and alleges she was told by coaches she was not ""phyiscal"" enough as a player compared to Fleming. Sugai is now part of the lawsuit and seeking monetary damages after the decision to grant Fleming a scholarship instead caused Sugai's volleyball career to end, resulting in severe depression.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Former San Jose State player Elle Patterson is also part of the lawsuit and alleges she did not receive a scholarship. Patterson also played behind Fleming and alleges the university did not fulfill previous verbal offers of a scholarship to her for the 2023 and 2024 seasons. Patterson says she even paid full tuition to play in 2023 after being told she would get a scholarship for 2024. However, the program did not make good on that offer either, she alleges.  San Jose State previously addressed the allegations in a statement to Fox News Digital.  ""The safety and well-being of our student athletes and employees is our highest priority. The university has taken and will continue to take multiple steps to provide security, support and resources to all members of the team as the program navigates this challenging time,"" the statement said. ""San Jose State takes all reports and complaints seriously, but we are unable to provide any information regarding confidential complaints and reports out of respect for the parties involved and due to federal and state privacy laws.  ""The university also has concerns about a number of inaccuracies in the press but is not able to comment further on those in light of privacy rights of all involved. We will continue to honor the privacy of our employees and students. We require and expect that all of our employees abide by our standards, policies and applicable laws regarding student and employee privacy."" The team has just one match left in the regular season with a meeting against Fresno State scheduled for Tuesday. Questions still remain about the team's postseason prospects.  San Jose State has had seven matches on its schedule forfeited amid the controversy involving Fleming. Southern Utah, Boise State, Utah State, Wyoming and Nevada all declined to face the Spartans. Boise State and Wyoming forfeited two matches each, taking multiple losses to avoid competition against Fleming.  And now, standing alone in first place in the conference, the Spartans are set to have a top seed in the Mountain West tournament, starting Nov. 27. Slusser told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview she and her teammates are in limbo about what a potential postseason run might look like as they navigate a demoralized locker room. ""We're just mostly wondering, are teams even gonna play us, period, if we go there? Because of just everything that's happened this season,"" Slusser said. ""It seems like every few days it looks like It'll be a fine day and everything's normal, and then something else happens. So, I truly do think everyone's just kind of taking things day by day and taking the punches as they come.""

Less than 24 hours after losing to Jake Paul in their highly anticipated bout, Mike Tyson says he has ""no regrets"" over having entered the ring one final time at 58 years old.  But as he was preparing for his first professional fight in nearly two decades, Tyson revealed that his health scare earlier this year was actually a near-death experience.  Tyson posted on X on Saturday afternoon, where he revealed that his ulcer, which caused him to go to the hospital, led to him almost passing away.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Mike Tyson and Jake Paul exchange punches during their heavyweight world titles of the Premiere Boxing Championship on Friday night at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, United States on November 15, 2024.

""I was explaining to my trainer I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Coming here from Miami on the plane, I went to the bathroom, and I threw up blood.

""She said, ‘We have options, though.’ That’s when I got nervous."" Tyson was eventually cleared to return to training, where he says he needed to gain back his weight lost and continue building his endurance.  The fight, despite fans and critics opining on social media that it was a downer, saw Tyson last all eight, two-minute rounds against Paul, who was eventually ruled the winner by unanimous decision.  Paul did a bow to Tyson to honor him during the final ticks of the eighth round, and the two fighters shared an embrace afterwards.  Sept. 15, 2024; Arlington, Texas.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. As in baseball when a manager calls in the closer to end the game, Belle Sessions called on Henry Silver to kick for a chance at $150,000 on ESPN’s ""College GameDay"" Saturday. Sessions arrived at the ""College GameDay"" set at 3 a.m. Saturday, one of the first 300 people to arrive, and was entered into Pat McAfee’s kicking contest raffle.  Sessions' raffle ticket was selected, but she knew she had no chance at making the kick.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM A Georgia Bulldogs helmet during the 2023 Orange Bowl at Hard Rock Stadium.

""I’ve kicked a ball before. I played soccer my whole life. I think I can do it,"" Silver said confidently.  Because Sessions and Silver decided to split the winnings, McAfee upped the winnings by making the kick worth $200,000, giving each student $100,000 if Silver nailed the kick. On top of that, if Silver made the 33-yard field goal, McAfee would donate $200,000 to hurricane relief.  GEORGIA ON OUTSIDE OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF BRACKET AS WILD WEEK BRINGS RANKINGS SHAKEUP Pat McAfee sits on the ESPN ""College GameDay"" set before a game between the Penn State Nittany Lions and the Ohio State Buckeyes at Beaver Stadium in University Park, Pa., Nov. 2, 2024.

To add even more pressure to Silver as he was lining up, McAfee decided to double the purse to $200,000 for Silver and Sessions each and $400,000 for hurricane relief should he make it. But the only catch was he only had one kick to make it. In past weeks, McAfee has given the raffle winner a second try to make the kick. Silver had one shot at making it through the uprights for a total of $800,000.  No pressure, right? Wrong. Silver wasn’t lying when he told Sessions he could make the field goal.  Silver crushed the ball perfectly through the middle of the uprights with plenty of distance, leaving no doubt it was good once the ball left Silver’s right foot.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Dooley Field prior to a game between the Missouri Tigers and Georgia Bulldogs at Sanford Stadium Nov. 4, 2023, in Athens, Ga.

Former host of ""The View"" Rosie Perez was part of Netflix's broadcast booth for its Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul fight on Friday.  Perez is an actress who served as the grand marshal for the International Boxing Hall of Fame parade in 2013. Among some, she holds the nickname ""the First Lady of Boxing.""  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM ""I learned how to box because I used to get beat up a lot. And I was scrappy. I would always fight back all the time, even though I would lose,"" she told The Guardian in 2022. Perez was also a temporary host on ABC's ""The View"" earlier this year and contributed thoughts about the recent election multiple times, and often voiced opposition to President-elect Donald Trump.  During an episode on October 14, Perez criticized Trump's response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017.  ""He blocked federal funding to go down there, he threw paper towels at us!"" Perez said.  She also pointed to Latino unemployment levels under Trump's administration and to reports that Trump had sent COVID-19 tests to Russia.  ""Please go to the polls and vote for Kamala Harris,"" Perez said while claiming to address Latino voters. After Trump's Oct. 27 rally at Madison Square Garden, Perez was one of the many liberal voices to criticize a comedy routine by Tony Hinchcliffe, who jokingly referred to Puerto Rico as a ""floating island of garbage."" ""I was angry, I was hurt"" Perez said in response during an interview on MSNBC on Oct. 31. ""But I have to tell you, they picked on the wrong people.""  ""We don't take it, we don't take it sitting down . . . I think a lot of people are going to go to the polls.""  Trump went on to win the Electoral College and popular vote, while earning the largest percentage of Latino voters for a Republican candidate in the party's modern era.  Perez made a post on Instagram on Nov. 6 acknowledging Trump's electoral win, with an image of a quote by famed poet Toni Morrison. Perez acknowledged that many were ""disappointed and saddened"" about the results but said Americans ""must respect it if we truly believe in democracy.""  But since then, the only activity on any of Perez's social media channels has been all about boxing. Now she is in the booth to put her political differences with Paul and Tyson aside to broadcast one of the biggest events in sports history.  MEGAN RAPINOE TAKES SWIPE AT ‘VIOLENT REALITY’ OF ANOTHER TRUMP PRESIDENCY Rosie Perez attends the world premiere of Apple's ""Before"" series at the Museum of Modern Art on October 16, 2024, in New York City.  (Michael Loccisano/WireImage) Paul and Tyson are vocal Trump supporters, with Tyson's connection dating back to his personal friendship with Trump during the prime of the boxer's career. Tyson endorsed Trump during his first presidential run in 2016, confirming it in an interview with HuffPost Life in October of that year.  ""He should be president of the United States. That's what he should be... Why are people mad at the people? Because this is who the people want to be president,"" Tyson said. ""Let's try something new. Let's run America like a business, where no colors matter. Whoever can do the job, gets the job."" Paul endorsed Trump in a video where he made a passionate plea to his followers to vote for the former president on Oct. 31.  ""Do the right thing, vote for Donald Trump. Not because I said so, not because Beyoncé said so, but because it’s what’s right. . . .

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Jake Paul dismisses negative reactions to Mike Tyson fight: 'I don’t care what people have to say',https://www.foxnews.com/sports/jake-paul-dismisses-negative-reaction-mike-tyson-fight-dont-care-what-people-say,"Sat, 16 Nov 2024 03:51:29 -0500","Jake Paul, 27, said he let off the gas pedal against a clearly exhausted 58-year-old Mike Tyson, which prompted a rather boring fight and restlessness from the crowd.","Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Nearly 80,000 people were hoping boxing legend Mike Tyson would turn back the clock Friday night against Jake Paul – and the excitement at AT&T Stadium was through the roof early on. But by the fourth round, as Tyson began to look like a 58-year-old who hadn’t had a professional fight in 19 years, the crowd began to die out. Several moments later, boo-birds were loud, and the crowd then grew restless.  The reaction on social media was similar, with many losing interest rather quickly in the biggest boxing spectacle in modern history. Perhaps tons of connection issues on Netflix, where the fight was shown live, and minutes of buffering added to the let-down as well.

(Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images) Sure, almost no one in the crowd wanted to see Jake Paul win, but the crowd was booing the action as a whole – not just Paul. In the end, it was a victory by unanimous decision for Paul. Tyson clearly ran out of gas early, which could have prompted Paul, 31 years Tyson’s junior, to pounce, but Paul later admitted he had let off the pedal. ""Definitely a bit. I wanted to give the fans a show, but I didn’t want to hurt someone that didn’t need to be hurt,"" he said in his post-fight presser. Tyson did not speak with the media. ""I tried to give the best fight I possibly could, but when someone’s just surviving in the ring, it’s hard to make it exciting. I couldn’t really get him to engage me or slip shots and do something super cool or whatever,"" he added.

In fact, the most exciting part of all of this may just have been Tyson's slap at Thursday's weigh-in. But Paul, in his own words, doesn’t care about the negativity. ""I don’t care what people have to say. They’re always going to have something to say. It is what it is."" Most Valuable Promotions co-founder Nakisa Bidarian added, ""The only way people would have been happy is if Jake lost. People would've been like ‘oh, what a great fight! Mike's a legend!'

ARLINGTON, Texas – Jake Paul defeated Mike Tyson by unanimous decision on Friday night in Texas. The anti-Paul, and very pro-Tyson, crowd had been buzzing after Amanda Serrano was arguably robbed against Katie Taylor in the fight prior.

But Paul clearly held his own in round one. Paul connected on a couple of lefts in the third, and Tyson began to show his age.

Tyson said he wasn’t sure if this would be his last fight, but he did crack a joke about fighting Paul’s brother, Logan.

Stroud a go-to weapon behind an offensive line struggling to protect last year’s No. 2 overall draft pick.  Collins was a chance to play ahead of last week’s game against Detroit but was given another week to heal.  Speaking to reporters on Friday, Collins sounded confident he’d take the field at Jerry World for a must-win game against the Texans’ inter-state rivals.  ""Yeah, I'm playing this week,"" Collins told ESPN.  ""Just going out there, being with my brothers. There's no better feeling than that. Just happy to be feeling good and happy to be able to have the opportunity to play this week and just continue to pick back up where I left off.""  Collins won’t offer Stroud pass protection, but he should prove a vital piece in the screen game and on short-yardage situations.  His breakout game came in Week 2 when he caught for 135 yards and a touchdown in the win over the Bears, a week after he posted similar numbers in a game against the Colts.  Ryan Cook is a freelance sports journalist from Australia.

Results, highlights from 2024 Riyadh Season 'Latino Night' as Zurdo unifies cruiserweight titles",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/boxing/news/gilberto-zurdo-ramirez-vs-chris-billam-smith-live-fight-updates-results-highlights/b1396b91229850c546301416,"Sat, 16 Nov 2024 23:50:19 +0000",WBA champion Gilberto 'Zurdo Ramirez added Chris Billam-Smith's WBO cruiserweight title to his collection over 12 rounds of concussive punching in Riyadh. Australia's IBF king Jai Opetaia could be next.,"Dom Farrell Gilberto 'Zurdo' Ramirez turned on the style to inflict a punishing unanimous decision defeat on Chris Billam-Smith and add the WBO cruiserweight title to his WBA crown in Riyadh. Back in the Middle East two years after being comprehensively outclassed by Dmitry Bivol in Abu Dhabi on a chastening quest for light heavyweight glory, Ramirez was the man with the skills equation in his favour this time around. The Bivol defeat was Ramirez's last at 175 lbs and, after dethroning France's Arsen Goulamirian in March, he overcame a tricky opening round to dominate the bloodied and brave Billam-Smith. That heart and spirit perhaps earned the Englishman more credit than he was due on the scorecards — his relentless refusal to accept the inevitable meant he slugged away to the final bell to drop scores of 116-112 (twice) and 116-113. Zurdo is chasing greatness and wants Jai Opetaia NEXT 🏆#RiyadhSeason | #LatinoNight | @Turki_alalshikh pic.twitter.com/nipRXApRiL Australia's lavishly gifted IBF champion Jai Opetaia — already a fixture on Riyadh Season cards – could be up next. That is a mouthwatering prospect and a bout that would propel Zurdo unquestionably into the big leagues. A carefully managed journey over 48 professional fights moving up the weight divisions might not always have progressed at a satisfying pace, but on Saturday night Ramirez made good on his superstar billing. The Sporting News provided live updates from 'Latino Night' as well as round-by-round coverage of Zurdo vs. Billam-Smith 2:22 a.m. AST/ 6:22 p.m. ET: The cards read 116-112 (twice) and 116-113 in Zurdo's favour, which feels a touch kind to Billam-Smith but maybe he earned that kindness with an unflinchingly brave effort. In truth, Ramirez was a level above in terms of footwork and punch variety. All the talk will be of a fight with Australia's super-slick IBF champion Jai Opetaia. That could be a cracker. Thanks for joining us tonight. Round 12: Zurdo has no need to do anything heroic in this round, yet here he is trading hooks. Billam-Smith has to swing for the fences but this is all instinct and heart. Ramirez as him pinned in the neutral corner, Billam-Smith tags him with a couple of rights. Switches the attack to the body. Zurdo dips back onto the ropes and doesn't entirely successfully smother an uppercut. Trading to the be bell. The crowd rise. Superb bravery and will from Billam-Smith but Ramirez's skills have paid the bills here. SN unofficial scorecard: Zurdo 117-111 Billam Smith What a fight by Zurdo and Chris Billam-Smith 👏#RiyadhSeason | #LatinoNight | LIVE and FREE on DAZN | @Turki_alalshikh pic.twitter.com/G9ucyZGvAe Round 11: Billam-Smith looking to build on that little bit of momentum but Zurdo is back to moving coolly around the target and landing clean head shots. Nice one-two from CBS, who forces Ramirez to retreat. Even so he's still eating power shots and surely can't see out of his left eye at this juncture. SN unofficial scorecard: Zurdo 108-101 Billam Smith Round 10: Ah, a good moment for Billam-Smith as he lands to the body and Zurdo retreats to the ropes. And another in centre-ring. That definitely had an effect, but Ramirez is still able to respond with a couple of lefts of his own. ""Stay on him!"" hollers coach McGuigan. Definitely CBS's best round since the opener. SN unofficial scorecard: Zurdo 98-92 Billam Smith Round 9: Zurdo works an angle for a hellacious left that snaps Billam-Smith's head back. His chin is made of granite but there must be a few cracks. He's still having moments of success but Ramirez is winning the exchanges with interest. CBS' eye is gushing blood. As is his nose. The doctor will probably have another look. SN unofficial scorecard: Zurdo 89-82 Billam Smith Round 8: A brave, better round from the bloodied Billam-Smith. But he finds himself on the end of a stingingly precise three-punch combination. Now a brutal right to the body from Zurdo. CBS gamely fires back but there's not as much on his punches as there was in those opening stages. A closer round but another to the Mexican. SN unofficial scorecard: Zurdo 79-73 Billam Smith Round 7: The doctor has a long look at Billam-Smith's eye, which is in a dreadful mess. We'd go to the cards if he can't continue, where you have to assume Zurdo has a very handy lead. Good combination from Billam-Smith but he's stopped in his tracks by another Ramirez counter. Zurdo stepping around to open up new angles of attack all the time, in and out. Quality stuff. A huge left the body hurts Billam-Smith. Zurdo follows up with a volley of head shots. The end might be close here. SN unofficial scorecard: Zurdo 69-64 Billam Smith Round 6: Zurdo finds his man upright at mid-range and he's running through the repertoire. It's starting to look like it's having an effect on Billam-Smith. There's a left hook down the pipe at close quarters again. Billam-Smith is trying to throw with Zurdo. It's brave but he can't match him for output or variety and is bleeding from the left eye. SN unofficial scorecard: Zurdo 59-55 Billam Smith Round 5: Billam-Smith has swelling around the left eye and damage to the eyelid from a head clash. That impressive first round suddenly feels a long time ago. But 'The Gentleman lands a fine uppercut moving in. He's better when he's not right in front of Ramirez and not loading up. Back comes Zurdo with a heavy hook to the midsection. Better round from Billam-Smith's round but he takes another clumping left hook to the jaw on the bell. SN unofficial scorecard: Zurdo 49-46 Billam Smith Round 4: Slightly more circumspect start to this session from CBS. Ramirez working around the target nicely before walking into a left hook. Billam-Smith a bit too much of an upright target at this juncture and Zurdo is scoring freely with hooks. And a right rocks Billam-Smith to his boots! The WBO champ looks to fire back to the body but takes another clipping left hook. SN unofficial scorecard: Zurdo 39-37 Billam Smith Your @autozone Moment of the Night 🇲🇽🏆#RiyadhSeason | #LatinoNight | @Turki_alalshikh pic.twitter.com/AraQNBzVfQ Round 3: Shane McGuigan in Billam-Smith's corner tells his man not to forget the jab. He doesn't need to be loading up on power shots when everything that lands seems to be having an impact on Zurdo. Nice straight right from Ramirez catches Billam-Smith pulling back. Now a left to the jaw. Good moments for the Mexican but Billam-Smith digs to the body and then moves upstairs. When they meet in that fashion it looks like a pumped up former super-middleweight against a fully-fledged cruiser. The Billam-Smith eats a huge left just before the bell. SN unofficial scorecard: Zurdo 29-28 Billam Smith Round 2: Billam-Smith finds the body with a right but ships a Zurdo left-hook for his trouble. That honey punch looks in good order for the WBA champ, who hasn't got much else going just yet. There's combination upstairs on the ropes that might get the juices flowing. Short left from CBS, Zurdo responds with a one-two. Billam-Smith check hook but there coming back in twos and threes now from Ramirez. SN unofficial scorecard: Zurdo 19-19 Billam Smith Round 1: Billam-Smith opens up with as solid jab that Ramirez has to wear. Zurdo looking to thrown under the Englishman's lead, then turns one around into a hook. Billam-Smith put some shots together off the straight right to wobble Zurdo! Referee Harvey Dock has word with Ramirez regarding use of the elbow in a clinch. Nice left from Zurdo but Billam-Smith walks through it and responds with a right of his own. And another right hook out of the break on the bell. Good opener for 'The Gentleman'.

UK, Mexico and Saudi Arabia all to get an airing. That gives me the opportunity to remind you we'll be going round-by-round for the WBA and WBO unification showdown. 1:17 a.m. AST/ 5:17 p.m. ET: It's main event time. Michael Buffer is in position doing his thing and Chris Billam-Smith has stormed into the ring. No messing about, black hood over his head. All business. Zurdo on the way. 12:58 a.m. AST/ 4:58 p.m. ET: No nonsense as Barboza prevails by margins of 97-93 and 96-94 twice. The victor is ecstatic and emotional in his moment of triumph. He wanted this fight for a long time and when it came around he got the job done. Now opportunity knocks for the 32-year-old in a wide-open 140 lbs division. Some lovely warm words for Ramirez from Barboza, who has put his awful previous outing against Sean McComb behind him tonight . Main event next. 12:54 a.m. AST/ 4:54 p.m. ET: We got the distance and they both threw up to the bell. Barring anything daft on the cards, Barboza has got this. There were shades of Ramirez's old brilliance but he struggled to get going and get his best work off for any sustained period. Perhaps the 10-stone limiting is just too sapping for him nowadays. Barboza controlled the action and it looked very much like a former champion being left behind by a potential future champion. 12:31 a.m. AST/ 4:31 p.m. ET: Okay, so it hasn't really caught fire at all. That one's on me. Oh, hang on, booming right hand right on the money from Ramirez in five. He needed to pick up the pace and there we are. Ships a couple of rights in return from Barboza though, who is probably just ahead at this point.

Former unified champion Jose Ramirez and Arnold Barboza Jr. are into the first of 10 scheduled rounds in the super lightweight division. Former stablemate who don't particularly get along. Expect this one to catch fire and stay lit when it does. 11:54 p.m. AST/ 3:54 p.m. ET: Zepeda gets it 95-94 on two cards, with Farmer by the same margin on the other scorecard. You can't get any closer than that and the Mexican's Golden Boy handlers breath a huge sigh of relief. Farmer is crestfallen, leaning on the top rope before being consoled by his partner. The Philadelphia fighter produced a performance few thought he had left in the tank and he can be so proud of what he produced once the disappointment subsides. On that evidence, Shakur Stevenson would box merry rings around Zepeda but even on a bad night his relentlessness got the job done... just. BELT 2… 11:46 p.m. AST/ 3:46 p.m. ET: Into the final session. Farmer looked to go with Zepeda blow-for-blow in an absorbing ninth. It seems he had a few rounds off and wants to come on strong here. Will that be enough? It's might be as two left hands rock Zepeda. The Mexican comes back the only way he knows, piling forward, throwing a relentless barrage of shots. But that could very well be Farmer's round, you know. It could be close on the cards. Has Zepeda busily slugged his way to enough rounds to compensate for the knockdown and getting pinged with frequent big left hands? I think he probably has, but that's not the statement performance to entice Shakur Stevenson. WHAT A FIGHT‼️#RiyadhSeason | #LatinoNight | LIVE and FREE on DAZN | @Turki_alalshikh pic.twitter.com/p93xGK4ukk 11:32 p.m. AST/ 3:32 p.m. ET: The tide might have turned here. Zepeda's superior output and in particular the short shots he is digging into the body are starting to have an effect on Farmer, who has slowed a touch.  Good sixth and seventh for Zepeda but at the end of the latter he was wide open to a couple of head shots. 11:24 p.m. AST/ 3:24 p.m. ET: Farmer hurts Zepeda with the left again in round five. And again! He can't miss with that left down the pipe. Zepeda comes back, ploughing forward fearlessly but he's taking too many sharp shots.  11:20 p.m. AST/ 3:20 p.m. ET: Farmer is here to win and is standing and trading with Zepeda. You wonder if he has the power to make that a viable strategy...WOW, DOWN GOES ZEPEDA! Short, sharp left hand counter, beautiful work from the veteran and Zepeda has to pick himself up off the mat. TEVIN FARMER DROPPED WILLIAM ZEPEDA 😱#RiyadhSeason | #LatinoNight | LIVE and FREE on DAZN | @Turki_alalshikh pic.twitter.com/ar1MCcZIZM 11:14 p.m. AST/ 3:14 p.m. ET: Farmer enjoyed a good first round and steadied Zepeda with a clubbing left hook in round two. The younger man responded with volume and intensity. This is hearing up nicely. 11:07 p.m. AST/ 3:07 p.m. ET: William Zepeda and Tevin Farmer are each in the ring. This is a fascinating crossroads clash, Zepeda is the coming man at lightweight and if he can get past wily former world champion Farmer a mega fight against Shakur Stevenson will loom into view. 10:40 p.m. AST/ 2:40 p.m. ET: Collazo clinically stalking his prey. There's the right hook again and down goes Niyomtrong again! He's up, but the end is surely close. Surgical stuff from Collazo, he's not rushing. This is a statement performance. Another knockdown and it's waved off! The longest active world-title reign in boxing is over and Oscar Collazo is a unified champion. The moment @Oscalito6 unified the mini flyweight division 🥊😤#RiyadhSeason | #LatinoNight | LIVE and FREE on DAZN | @Turki_alalshikh pic.twitter.com/Ld8RADGOQz 10:35 p.m. AST/ 2:35 p.m. ET: Niyomtrong down in round six! Collazo was already in the ascendency and he lands a peach of a right hook to the jaw as Niyomtrong was throwing. The 34-year-old landed on the seat of his trunks. He rose gamely but how much does he have left? Collazo has seven KOs in 10 victories. A storm is on the way. 10:11 p.m. AST/ 2:11 p.m. ET: Two good fights so far and this one should be a cracker. WBO champion Oscar Collazo and WBA king Thammanoon Niyomtrong put their minimumweight belts and undefeated records on the line. The vacant Ring Magazine title at 105 lbs is also up for grabs. 10:03 p.m. AST/ 2:03 p.m. ET: Vergil Ortiz is being interviewed by DAZN alongside his promoter Oscar De La Hoya. He says the undefeated star's next fight will be against one of Sebastian Fundora, Terence Crawford or Jaron Ennis. That'll do!  9:53 p.m. AST/ 1:53 p.m. ET: Duarte now has back-to-back wins following his eight-round stoppage loss to Ryan Garcia last December. After the fight the called out Garcia's bitter rival Devin Haney. Sure, that would be very watchable but Akhmedov surely deserves the chance to run that back. Assuming he's not simply done with this sport altogether. He landed more punches, at a greater rate of accuracy and also produced the cleaner work. That was enough for two rounds from one judge and three from another. Nonsense. 9:50 p.m. AST/ 1:50 p.m. ET: 98-92, 97-93, 96-94 all in favour of Duarte. Well, well. The Mexican finished strong but it's hard to shake the impression that Akhmedov has been absolutely stiffed on the cards once again. A four career defeat for a man who could very reasonably say he should be undefeated. 96-94 for Duarte, I'll allow it. Those other two scores are a shambles. 9:47 p.m. AST/ 1:47 p.m. ET: We're going to the cards in a close fight that I think Akhmedov has done enough to win. He has, of course, been here before. Duarte laid it on with some heavy shots down the stretch but Akhmedov should realistically have this by a couple of points. 9:23 p.m. AST/ 1:23 p.m. ET: Four rounds down and there's very little to chose between these two men, who must feel like they're fighting a mirror image of themselves as they trade a pick shots in centre ring. If anything is shading it, it's Akhmedov's slightly higher work rate, as evidenced by some reddening around the eyes of Duarte. 9:05 p.m. AST/ 1:05 p.m. ET: Our next bout is in the ring and ready to go. The heavy-handed Oscar Duarte taking on two-time world title challenger Batyr Akhmedov in a super lightweight bout scheduled for 10. The Uzbek fighter could very easily have won each of those bouts against Mario Barrios and Alberto Puello. Duarte tends to avoid the cards being brought into the equation, with 22 of his 27 career wins coming inside the distance. 8:55 p.m. AST/ 12:55 p.m. ET: We've just had a mini barnburner in our first fight of the night. Local favourite Ziyad Almaayouf boxed to a six-round majority draw against Juan Garcia. One judge scored the bout 58-56 in the Saudi boxers favour, with the other two scoring it even at 57-57. It amounts to the first blemish on Almaayouf's pro record of 6-0-1, while 21-year-old Mexican slugger Garcia is now 5-6-1. 8:30 p.m. AST/ 12:30 p.m. ET: Hello and welcome to The Sporting News' live coverage of Gilberto 'Zurdo' Ramirez vs. Chris Billam-Smith.

""Lillard’s addition would take considerable pressure off Houston’s young players, allowing Green to play off the ball more effectively and Sengun to focus on his role as a secondary playmaker and inside presence.”  “Moreover, Lillard’s veteran experience and leadership would add much-needed direction and poise to a Rockets team looking to make their first playoff appearance in years."" ""Although Lillard’s defense has been a liability, Ime Udoka’s system and the defensive prowess of players like Thompson and Tari Eason could provide some balance, allowing Houston to use Lillard primarily for his offense.” “If Houston is serious about accelerating its rebuild and capitalizing on the talent already in place, adding a veteran star of Lillard’s caliber could be the missing piece that makes them competitive right away.” Houston would need to be content with shipping Dillon Brooks, Jabari Smith Jr., Jock Landale, a 2027 first-round pick (via the Phoenix Suns), and a 2029 first-round pick (via the Rockets) to the Bucks for Lillard.  Despite forming a frightening big three composed of Lillard, Khris Middleton, and Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee’s vision has yet to come to fruition from a team success standpoint. While the Weber State product has played his part in Milwaukee, pouring in 20+ points and dishing out at least five assists nightly, the Bucks haven’t looked like a team capable of making a meaningful postseason run.  Lillard may not be at the top of his game at age 34, but his talents would be valued on a surging 9-4 Rockets squad.  Adding an established point guard with wicked space-creating ability and 65 games of playoff experience would transform Houston into a near-complete basketball club.  Without Lillard, Houston would still be a well-respected Western Conference contender. Still, acquiring an asset of Lillard’s caliber would drastically change the perception of the franchise.

Leading by one point with less than 10 seconds to go, Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo was called for a foul, sending Hornets guard LaMelo Ball to the free throw line. He nailed both before Antetokounmpo missed the game-winner, but the call did not come without controversy. Bucks coach Doc Rivers was trending on social media in two different ways thanks to the situation. Firstly, Rivers' instant reaction to the foul on the jumbotron was one to remember. He looked on with pure disgust on his face as Ball approached the charity stripe. The facial expression gathered much attention, but not nearly as much as his postgame comment. When asked about the foul on his star player, Rivers decided to push the blame toward the referees rather than taking accountability. ""I thought the final play was the ref blowing the call. This is back-to-back games now where on the final play there's been an incorrect call made,"" Rivers said. ""LaMelo Ball fell. He just fell down. Nobody was near him. Slipped on his own. We come up with the ball. The game's over."" Unusually, many fans backed Rivers' remark. It appears Ball lost his footing and fell, not Antetokounmpo forcing him off his feet. The bad news is, regardless of opinions on the call, the Bucks dropped yet another winnable game. They now sit at 4-9, or 12th in the Eastern Conference.

Phillips only recorded two solo tackles. But, as reported by ESPN's Alaina Getzenberg, ""Bills DT Jordan Phillips was fined $6,722 for unsportsmanlike conduct (taunting) in the second quarter vs. the Colts. This was not called during the game and the Bills offense was on the field at the time."" There is speculation on X (formerly Twitter) that Phillips was fined for taunting Colts linebacker Zaire Franklin on the sideline following Bills wide receiver Mack Hollins' 44-yard catch.

I bet if you ask him he will tell you it was money well spent #Bills #BillsMafia pic.twitter.com/ylcGawuKbT https://t.co/Z0FYtNdFQm It's as good a guess as any, especially considering Phillips taunted Franklin on Instagram after the game. Phillips, 32, re-signed with the Bills after the Dallas Cowboys released him on November 5. This is Phillips' third Bills stint. The Oklahoma alum began his NFL career with the Miami Dolphins, who cut him early in the 2018 season. The Bills claimed Phillips off of waivers in October 2018, and he remained in Buffalo through the 2019 season. Phillips hit free agency and signed with Arizona in March 2020, but he only played 18 games across 2020-21 for the Cardinals before landing back in Buffalo for the 2022 and '23 seasons.

So is Travis Hunter's remarkable season. Not only is he in the conversation for the Heisman Trophy, but the Buffs' two-way superstar is also being recognized for his leadership qualities on and off the field. The Buffaloes earned their eighth win of the season and fourth in a row, moving one step closer to a College Football Playoff and Big 12 title berth, defeating Utah 49-24. Hunter had a spectacular spectacular game -- which included one rushing touchdown, an interception, 55 receiving yards, and three solo tackles. At one point in his career, shortly after Sanders was hired, Hunter thought he couldn't be a catalyst for Colorado's future success, but one conversation between the two changed everything. According to 247 Sports' Carl Reed, Sanders was one of the few coaches who trusted Hunter, which was all he needed to take the next step. ""When Travis Hunter chose Jackson State to play for Coach Prime, everyone said he was ruining his life,"" Reed wrote. ""When he followed him to Colorado and still didn’t choose a “blue blood,” they said he would regret it and that it would hurt his draft stock. Trust your vision for yourself."" It's clear Sanders has liked Hunter, as evidenced by his postgame interview with Fox Sports' Jenny Taft. ""He's a straight A student,"" Sanders said. ""He ain't smoking, he ain't getting high, he ain't doing nothing stupid like that or getting drunk. He's a great human being.""

Chandhok reckons Imola is too narrow to allow multiple overtakes in the current F1 cars, while the German GP would make more sense considering Mercedes' influence in the sport.  The German Grand Prix featured on the F1 calendar before 2019. Italy, on the other hand, hosts two races at Imola and Monza. With Mercedes supporting another customer team in the sport from 2026 when it will supply power units and gearboxes to Alpine, and with F1 legends such as Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel hailing from Germany, Chandhok feels strange about the lack of a German Grand Prix on the calendar. In addition, with Formula 1 cars of the current era being much larger and heavier than cars from one or two decades ago, it has made it challenging to overtake on narrow race tracks such as Imola, prompting Chandhok to suggest its cancellation. He told Sky Sports F1, as quoted by RacingNews365: “It's a fantastic venue to go to, it’s obviously historic. In qualifying, it's a very exciting track to watch and for the drivers [to take part in]. “But it's too narrow for the racing nowadays, with the size of the cars we've got, I think F1 has outgrown it. We're not seeing much overtaking there.” Chandhok noted that it feels odd not to have a German Grand Prix on the calendar, and similarly, the absence of the French Grand Prix also stands out. He said: ""I feel like we need a German Grand Prix back on the track. “It feels really strange to have an F1 calendar without a German Grand Prix and a French Grand Prix. “There’s obviously Mercedes, and we have such a long lot of German influence in the sport, the time with [Sebastian] Vettel and [Michael] Schumacher and all that sort of stuff. “It feels a bit odd not to have a German Grand Prix.” Chandhok's remarks follow a recent announcement by Formula 1 CEO Stefano Domenicali, who revealed that several European circuits may be added to a rotating calendar, appearing every other year. This move aims to make room for new venues, as the demand for the sport continues to grow significantly. Announcing that the rotational calendar will be revealed soon, Domenicali stated on a Liberty Media investors call, as reported by Motorsport.com: ""We have some news to share very, very soon with regard to the possibility in the mid-term to have some rotational European Grand Prix and some other new options coming later. ""This is something that, of course, we will clarify in the due course. It is true that we have a large demand of new possible venues that want to come in and our choice will always be balanced between the right economical benefits that we can have as a system and also to leverage the growth on the market that we can see potential that will be beneficial for us to grow even further our business.""

Former Seattle Seahawks and Baltimore Ravens safety Earl Thomas saying he was better than Pittsburgh Steelers great and Hall of Famer Troy Polamalu is an example of the latter. Thomas appeared on Josina Anderson's new show ""The Exhibit"" and not only said he was better than Polamalu, but also fellow Hall of Fame safety and Ravens legend Ed Reed. ""I'm better than Ed Reed,"" Thomas said. ""I'm better than Troy Polamalu."" Thomas didn't help his case much after that. He went on to say that after seeing the ""older career"" of both players, he has no doubt in his mind he was better than them. ""I saw the older career of Ed Reed, the older career of Troy (Polamalu),"" Thomas added. ""Based on what I saw from that, I'm better than these guys."" When comparing players and trying to figure out who was better, it only makes sense to use their primes in the argument. When you do that, it's easy to see that Polamalu and Reed were both better. Now, none of this is to say that Thomas wasn't a fantastic player, because he was. He should get into Canton after he was a seven-time Pro Bowler, a three-time first-team All-Pro and a two-time second-team All-Pro. But Polamalu was just simply better. On top of all the clutch plays the Steelers great had during his illustrious, Hall of Fame career, Polamalu was an eight-time Pro Bowler, a four-time first-team All-Pro, a two-time second-team All-Pro and he won Defensive Player of the Year in 2010. Polamalu even won more Super Bowls than Thomas. Reed was also better. He had nine Pro Bowls, five first-team All-Pros, three second-team All-Pros, and won the Defensive Player of the Year award in 2004. Sorry, Earl, but you're wrong on both accounts.

It made for a weird spectacle, but in the baffling American sports ecosystem, clashes like Tyson and Paul's are increasingly common. Look no further than Paul's previous duels: he's clashed with former UFC stars Ben Askren, Tyron Woodley, Anderson Silva, Nate Diaz, and Mike Perry, as well as YouTuber KSI and reality TV star Tommy Fury. Tyson was the next name on his list. Here's what you need to know about his most recent spell in triage, one which prompted a huge shake-up on the calendar. MORE: Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson weigh-in results Tyson's return to the ring wasn't without its obstacles. He endured a frightening health scare prior to the initial date of his bout with Paul, July 20. Tyson detailed the nature of his ordeal on ""Countdown: Paul vs. Tyson"", a Netflix documentary released during the lead-up to Saturday's fight. “I was training, and I was doing great,"" Tyson said, via New York Magazine. ""Then all of a sudden, I started feeling kind of tired and I was explaining to my trainer, ‘I don’t know what’s wrong with me.'"" Tyson's symptoms intensified while flying to Texas for the duel. MORE: Jake Paul has released the beast in Mike Tyson “Coming here from Miami on the plane, I went to the bathroom, and I threw up blood, next thing I know, I’m on the floor and I was defecating tar,"" Tyson said. ""So, I came here [to the hospital] and they found out I had a big ulcer — two-and-a-half inches and it’s bleeding. All of my friends were calling me like I’m dying. “I asked the doctor if I’m going to die, and she didn’t say no, she said, ‘We have options, though,’ and that’s when I got nervous. I can’t wait to get out of this m— man, I want to fight and get back to training."" Tyson said he underwent several blood transfusions due to his ulcer. “The doctor said I lost half my blood. I almost died,"" Tyson said. “I lost 25 pounds in 11 days. Couldn’t eat. Only liquids. Every time I went to the bathroom, it smelled like tar. Didn’t even smell like s— anymore. It was disgusting.” Tyson slowly recovered from his malady, finding enough health to return home. His fitness predictably atrophied. “All my coordination, stamina, everything was hectic getting back,"" Tyson said. ""I was peaked already. I could have fought him that day. Now I got to start from scratch.”  On Saturday, following Paul coming out on top of the highly anticipated fight, Tyson took to X to express his gratefulness for even being healthy enough to put the gloves back on. ""This is one of those situations when you lost but still won,"" Tyson wrote. ""I almost died in June. Had 8 blood transfusions. Lost half my blood and 25lbs in hospital and had to fight to get healthy to fight so I won."" This is one of those situations when you lost but still won. I’m grateful for last night. No regrets to get in ring one last time.I almost died in June. Had 8 blood transfusions. Lost half my blood and 25lbs in hospital and had to fight to get healthy to fight so I won.To… MORE: Breaking down Mike Tyson's film career and investments since retirement Promoters cited an ulcer ""flare-up"" as the reason behind the initial postponement of the Paul-Tyson clash. ""Unfortunately, due to my ulcer flare-up, I have been advised by my doctor to lighten my training for a few weeks to rest and recover,"" Tyson said in a statement. “My body is in better overall shape than it has been since the 1990s, and I will be back to my full training schedule soon."" Paul and Tyson agreed that it was only fair to fight while both boxers are fully healthy. ""My fans know I don’t want to face Iron Mike at anything but his best, but let there be no mistake — when he steps into the ring with me, I will be ready to claim my W with a sensational finish,"" Paul said in a statement. MORE: Meet the last fighter to beat Mike Tyson Tyson is 58, having been born on June 30, 1966. The Fort Greene, Brooklyn, native burst on to the scene armed with two pistons. He proceeded to use both to great effect, becoming the youngest heavyweight champion in history after introducing Trevor Burbick to the canvas in 1986. The Cus D'Amato prodigy is far from his ""Kid Dynamite"" prime. Boxing fans worldwide are hoping he can find lightning in a bottle on Friday night. Tyson had a clean bill of health entering into Friday's duel. “I’m beautiful, and I’ve been training,” Tyson said, via Bloody Elbow. “I’ve been training for a while, two weeks or three weeks, and I’m okay to fight… I’m in camp right now.”  The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation — the governing body that is sanctioning the Paul-Tyson fight — vowed to conduct a ""thorough"" dive into Tyson's recent health history, according to World Boxing News. World Boxing News reported that TDLR's pre-fight medical testing wasn't to be conducted until Thursday, leaving just one day for the organization to make a decision on the status of the Paul-Tyson fight. The match was officially sanctioned, although it carries a trio of quirks that make it markedly different from the typical boxing match that goes on in the state of Texas. Paul and Tyson sported 14-ounce gloves rather than the standard 10-ounce mitts typically employed in heavyweight fights; the rounds were two minutes, not three; and the fight was contested over eight rounds rather than 10 or 12. Matchroom Boxing CEO Eddie Hearn wasn't convinced by TDLR's decision to sanction the clash. ""The reality is that 20 years ago when Mike Tyson retired from the sport he was shot, completely finished,"" Hearn said, via ESPN. ""It was actually sad to watch then, 20 years ago. ""...You only need to speak to him and look at him to know this guy should not be in a ring again. ... If I was Jake Paul, I'd just feel a little bit embarrassed, to be honest with you. ... This is dangerous, irresponsible and, in my opinion, disrespectful to the sport of boxing."" David Suggs is a content producer at The Sporting News.

The 2020 first-round pick hyperextended his knee in Week 7 and subsequently missed Weeks 8 and 9 against Baltimore and Los Angeles Chargers, respectively. The Browns were on a bye last week. On Monday, November 11, Wills Jr. told reporters he had ""made a business decision not to play"" against Baltimore. Dawand Jones made his first-ever start at left tackle for Cleveland's upset over Baltimore. Wills Jr. said that head coach Kevin Stefanski informed him he would ""no longer start but instead would serve as a 'swing' tackle'"" ahead of Week 9, and Wills Jr. backed up Jones and right tackle Jack Conklin for the Browns' loss to L.A. Cleveland.com's Mary Kay Cabot reported that Wills Jr. experienced ""a flare-up"" of his knee injury before Sunday's (Nov. 17) game against the Saints. ""A source said the move had nothing to do with Wills’ business decision remarks, which Kevin Stefanski described as a poor choice of words for the 2020 No. 10 overall pick out of Alabama,"" Cabot wrote.  ""I talked to Jed,"" Stefanski told reporters last week. ""It was a poor choice of words. I know the connotation of 'business decision,' and that's not how he meant it. [He] did not feel like he was near 100 percent to help us, but poor choice of words. And he understands that."" The reigning AP Coach of the Year emphasized that Wills Jr.'s public comments would not impact his playing time moving forward. Stefanski also explained that Wills Jr.'s rehab from MCL surgery last December has been ""tough."" The Browns additionally announced the signing of defensive tackle Sam Kamara and defensive end Elerson Smith to the active roster after placing defensive tackle Mike Hall Jr. on injured reserve. Wide receiver Kadarius Toney has been elevated from the practice squad and is expected to make his Browns debut against the Saints. The 2-7 Browns and 3-7 Saints are slated for a 1 p.m. ET kickoff.

The two sides met last Thursday in Kingston, where an early goal from Ricardo Pepi gave the Americans a 1-0 victory and the advantage heading into the return fixture. Mauricio Pochettino’s side are aiming to retain the Nations League title they won in 2023, while Jamaica are looking to reach the semi-finals for the first time. The USA have been dominant at home in this competition, winning all three of their knockout round matches at CityPark while conceding just once. They will be confident of securing their place in the final four, having won 8 of their 12 all-time matches in St. Louis. Jamaica, meanwhile, will be hoping to overturn the first-leg deficit and spring an upset. Steve McClaren’s men have proven to be a tough opponent for the Americans in recent meetings, with three of their last four encounters ending in 1-1 draws. The Reggae Boyz were the last Caribbean nation to defeat the USA on home soil, winning 1-0 at Audi Field in 2019. However, they will have to do without the injured Bobby Decordova-Reid and the suspended Mason Holgate for the trip to Missouri. Pochettino is also dealing with some injury concerns of his own, with Johnny Cardoso, Aidan Morris and several key attackers unavailable. But the Americans can still call upon the experienced duo of Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah, who will be looking to guide their side to victory. Jamaica were in a similar position 12 months ago, losing the first leg of their quarter-final against Canada before bouncing back to win the return match 3-2 and advance. They will be hoping for a repeat of that resilience on Tuesday. The visitors have scored in three of their last four meetings with the USA, but have failed to score against Pochettino’s men last time. A tight, cagey affair seems the most likely outcome, with the home side’s greater depth and tournament pedigree potentially proving the difference. A place in the semi-finals of the CONCACAF Nations League is at stake, and both teams will be desperate to book their spot in the final four. The USA will be favourites to get the job done, but Jamaica have shown they can more than match their opponents on their day.",2024-11-16

Stale Solbakken’s side are currently level on points with group leaders Austria in League B Group 3, but trail the Austrians on head-to-head record after suffering a 5-1 defeat in Vienna last month. However, Norway can clinch first place if they beat Kazakhstan and Austria fail to win against Slovenia. Norway booked their spot in the top two with a 4-1 victory away to Slovenia on Thursday. Erling Haaland scored his 35th international goal in just his 38th cap, while Antonio Nusa netted a brace. The result means Norway are guaranteed to finish above Matjaz Kek’s Slovenia regardless of the outcome on the final matchday. A top-two finish is assured, but Solbakken will be targeting top spot and automatic promotion to League A. Kazakhstan, who were promoted from League C last season, have endured a miserable Nations League campaign so far, losing four of their five matches and failing to score a single goal. They were thrashed 2-0 at home by Austria in their last outing. Stanislav Cherchesov’s side have lost 11 of their last 14 away games and will be heavy underdogs against a Norway team boasting the attacking talents of Haaland and Nusa. The Kazakhs will be without the suspended Aleksandr Marochkin for the trip to Oslo. Norway captain Martin Odegaard has been left out of the squad as he continues his recovery from a recent injury, but Solbakken has several other experienced options in midfield and attack. Egil Selvik is expected to deputize in goal with Orjan Nyland among the absentees. Despite their poor form, Kazakhstan will be hoping to finish their Nations League campaign on a high note. Midfielder Bakhtiyor Zaynutdinov will be keen to impress, having fallen out of favor at his club side Besiktas. A victory for Norway would cap an impressive Nations League campaign that has seen them lose just one of their six matches so far. Solbakken’s men are aiming to build on their recent progress and mount a serious challenge for a place at the 2026 World Cup. The neutral supporters will be hoping for a more entertaining affair than the 0-0 draw between the two sides in the reverse fixture in Almaty, where Norway managed just one shot on target and Kazakhstan’s expected goals (xG) was below 0.1.",2024-11-16

A victory over Slovenia would secure Austria’s promotion back to League A. Slovenia, meanwhile, are third in the group on 7 points after a 4-1 home defeat to Norway in their last outing. Matjaz Kek’s team must win to have any chance of finishing in the top two and earning a playoff spot for promotion. The reverse fixture between the two sides earlier in the campaign ended 1-1 in Ljubljana. Austria have won the three previous meetings, including 1-0 home and away victories in Euro 2020 qualifying. Austria come into the match in strong form, winning their last three Nations League games and scoring 11 goals in the process. They cruised to a 2-0 victory over Kazakhstan in their most recent fixture. Slovenia, on the other hand, have won just one of their last eight competitive matches, that victory coming against Kazakhstan in Euro 2024 qualifying.

Both sides have struggled mightily in the current campaign, with Israel sitting at the foot of the group without a win. Belgium, despite their pedigree, have also under-performed, winning just one of their six matches. The Belgians’ slim hopes of reaching the Nations League quarter-finals were extinguished by a 1-0 loss to group leaders Italy on Thursday. Sandro Tonali’s first-half goal proved the difference, as Belgium’s star-studded attack, including Romelu Lukaku, failed to find an equalizer. Israel, ranked 81st in the world, have been outmatched at the top level, though they did manage a creditable 0-0 draw against France in their last outing. Goalkeeper Daniel Peretz was the hero, keeping a clean sheet in the near-empty Stade de France. Sunday’s match at Budapest’s Bozsik Stadium represents a must-win for both sides. Israel can only avoid automatic relegation to League B if they beat Belgium by three goals or more, while the Red Devils need a victory to have any chance of making the relegation playoff in March.

The visitors, meanwhile, have already been condemned to a playoff to preserve their second-tier status after finishing third in the group. Ireland’s 1-0 win over Finland last time out ensured the Scandinavians’ relegation, but Heimir Hallgrimsson’s men have failed to beat any opponent other than Finland in this year’s competition.

The former Manchester United star’s tumultuous second stint in Turin has come to an abrupt end. Pogba, 31, rejoined Juventus in 2022 on a free transfer after leaving United. However, his time back in Serie A was plagued by injury and controversy. In March 2023, the French international was hit with a four-year doping ban after elevated testosterone levels were detected in his system. Though the ban was later reduced to 18 months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, the damage was done. Juventus manager Thiago Motta recently admitted that the club now views Pogba as “past the peak of his career.” In a statement, Juventus said: “Juventus Football Club and Paul Pogba announce that they have reached a mutual agreement for the termination of their contract as of 30 November, 2024. The club wishes Paul the very best for his professional future.” Pogba, for his part, expressed gratitude for his time with the club. “My time at Juventus has come to an end. It has been a privilege to pull on the shirt of the bianconeri and to share so many special moments,” he said. The 2018 World Cup winner is now a free agent, with potential suitors in France, the Premier League, Saudi Arabia, and MLS, including David Beckham’s Inter Miami.

<h1>Ducks Triumph Over Red Wings in a Memorable Night of Firsts</h1>
<p>In an electrifying display of hockey, Cutter Gauthier earned his first-ever NHL goal, propelling the <a href=""https://21sports.com/radko-gudas-steps-up-as-anaheim-ducks-first-captain-post-getzlaf-era/"">Anaheim Ducks</a> to secure a thrilling 6-4 win over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/panarin-and-quick-lead-rangers-to-a-clean-sweep-over-red-wings/"">Detroit Red Wings</a> on Friday night. From a two-goal deficit, the Ducks rallied for a remarkable victory, demonstrating resilience and tenacity.</p>
<h2>Four-In-A-Row Goal Blitz and a Night of Personal Achievements</h2>
<p>The Ducks' Ross Johnston added to the excitement, netting their fourth consecutive goal just 38 seconds post Gauthier's milestone. Ryan Strome further padded the lead with an empty-net goal, following a power play score by Detroit's Alex deBrincat. Olen Zellweger, Trevor Zegras, and Troy Terry also contributed to the Ducks' win with their power-play goals.</p>
<p>Goalkeeper John Gibson, with 21 successful saves, played a pivotal role in this triumph, helping the Ducks to secure two wins in their six-game homestand.</p>

<p>On a less positive note, the Ducks' forward Robby Fabbri couldn't face his former team, the Red Wings, owing to a knee surgery he underwent on Friday. Fabbri is expected to be sidelined for six to eight weeks. Cam Fowler, a key defenseman, will also be out for two to four weeks with an upper-body injury.</p>
<h3>Game Highlights: Breakthroughs and Power-Play Successes</h3>
<p>The 20-year-old Kasper made a breakthrough 19 months post his NHL debut, recording his first multi-point game. Meanwhile, Gauthier celebrated his significant breakthrough, scoring his maiden goal in his 17th game for the Ducks.</p>
<h3>Power-play Dominance: A Key Statistic</h3>
<p>The Ducks' two power-play goals equated their total from the last six games combined, reflecting their power-play dominance. Despite entering the game ranked 31st in power-play percentage, they turned the tables in their favor.</p>
<h2>What's Next in Store?</h2>
<p>The Ducks will face off against Dallas on Monday night, while the Red Wings are set to meet Los Angeles on Saturday. Their performance in these upcoming matches will be keenly watched by fans and critics alike.</p>

<h1>Washington Capitals Triumph Over Colorado Avalanche in Eventful 5-2 Victory</h1>
<p>In a thrilling display of ice hockey prowess, the <a href=""https://21sports.com/capitals-dominate-blues-in-8-1-rout-ovechkin-and-mcmichael-shine/"">Washington Capitals</a> took charge of the rink, pummeling the Colorado Avalanche with a 5-2 triumph on Friday night. Spearheading the victory was Connor McMichael, who scored two impressive goals, while the team as a whole displayed an awe-inspiring performance by scoring four times in their initial 10 shots.</p>
<h2>Capitalizing on the Capitals' Offensive Power</h2>
<p>Along with McMichael, Jakub Vrana, Jakob Chychrun, and Rasmus Sandin succeeded in finding the back of the net. Meanwhile, Charlie Lindgren made a significant contribution by thwarting 17 shots, marring the comeback of three crucial Colorado forwards.</p>
<p>Valeri Nichushkin made his return to the active roster after a six-month suspension under the NHL/NHLPA player assistance program, only managing one shot during his 19:27 ice time. Colorado's line-up also welcomed back wingers Jonathan Drouin and Miles Wood, both recovering from upper-body injuries.</p>
<h2>A Game of Twists and Turns</h2>
<p>The Avalanche initially took the lead, with Parker Kelly scoring within the first two minutes of the game. However, the Capitals quickly turned the tide, with Vrana and McMichael scoring successively, shifting the lead in Washington's favor.</p>
<p>The Avalanche's Nikolai Kovalenko managed to cut the Capitals' lead to 3-2 early in the second period, but Chychrun promptly responded with a goal midway through the second.</p>
<h3>Notable Takeaways from the Game</h3>
<p>In an unexpected turn of events, Capitals' star player, <a href=""https://21sports.com/ovechkins-decisive-strike-propels-capitals-to-victory-over-predators/"">Alex Ovechkin</a>, did not manage to add to his tally and remains 31 goals short of Wayne Gretzky’s record of 894 NHL goals.</p>
<p>On the Avalanche side, Trent Miner, called up earlier on Friday due to Alexandar Georgiev’s upper-body injury, made 12 saves in his NHL debut. He replaced Justus Annunen 1:53 into the second period after Annunen allowed three goals on six shots.</p>
<h2>Turning Point of the Match</h2>
<p>The game-changing moment came when McMichael intercepted Sam Girard's clear attempt at the Colorado blue line and scored with a backhander, stretching the Capitals' lead to 3-1 early in the third period.</p>
<h3>Noteworthy Statistics</h3>
<p>In a rare occurrence, Colorado's center Nathan MacKinnon, who currently leads the NHL with 33 points, was held without a point for the first time at home this season.</p>
<h2>What's Next for the Teams?</h2>
<p>Following their win, the Capitals are set to visit Vegas on Sunday night. Meanwhile, the Avalanche are preparing for a four-game trip, starting in Philadelphia on Monday night.</p>

<h1>Wolf's Stellar Performance Propels Flames Past Predators</h1>
<p>In a thrilling display of ice-hockey prowess, the <a href=""https://21sports.com/petterssons-power-play-prowess-propels-canucks-over-flames/"">Calgary Flames</a> emerged victorious over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/ovechkins-decisive-strike-propels-capitals-to-victory-over-predators/"">Nashville Predators</a> on Friday night, snapping the 2-0 win under the bright lights of the arena. Calgary's goalie, Dustin Wolf, a rookie sensation, impressively defended 29 shots to register his first career shutout.</p>
<h2>Flames' Forward Line Steps Up</h2>
<p>Calgary's Daniil Miromanov found the back of the net for the first time this season, contributing to the Flames' triumph. Blake Coleman's late empty-netter sealed the deal for Calgary, who have been on a roll, earning points in five of their last six outings, following a disappointing run of five defeats in six games.</p>
<h2>Predators Unable to Break the Ice</h2>
<p>Despite their determined efforts, the Predators were held scoreless for the third time this season. Their struggle to find a win continues, with only a single victory in their last seven matches. Nashville's Juuse Saros put up a strong performance in the net, fending off 31 shots.</p>
<h3>Goalkeepers Steal the Show</h3>
<p>Both Wolf and Saros made crucial saves on short-handed breakaways, keeping the game exciting for spectators. Wolf denied a promising attempt by the Predators' Cole Smith in the opening period, while Saros kept Nashville in the game with his third-period save against Coleman during a two-man rush.</p>
<h2>Game-Changing Moments</h2>
<p>Steven Stamkos of the Predators had a prime scoring opportunity thwarted by Wolf's quick reflexes. Despite Stamkos's mediocre performance since transferring to Nashville, he had one of the best chances of the evening for the Predators.</p>
<h3>Flames Break the Deadlock</h3>
<p>The Flames finally found their scoring touch late into the game, with a goal at 6:38 in the final period. Nazen Kadri won a crucial faceoff and fed the puck to MacKenzie Weegar. After a clever fake shot, Weegar set up Miromanov, who blasted the puck past Saros's shoulder to break the deadlock.</p>
<h2>A Showdown Of The League's Smallest Goalies</h2>
<p>This low-scoring contest was a duel between two of the league's smallest goaltenders, with Saros standing at 5-foot-11, an inch shorter than Wolf, who weighs in as the lightest netminder in the NHL at 166 pounds.</p>
<h3>What's Next in the NHL</h3>
<p>Moving forward, the Predators will look to bounce back against Vancouver on Sunday, while the Flames will host the New York Islanders on Tuesday in their next NHL face-off.</p>

<h1>A Grand Night for the Columbus Blue Jackets</h1>
<p>In a thrilling NHL encounter, Columbus Blue Jackets broke their six-game losing streak with a commanding 6-2 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins. Friday night's ice hockey showdown featured standout performances from Zac Werenski and Dmitri Voronkov, who both contributed a goal and an assist each. Meanwhile, Elvis Merzlikins was a formidable presence in goal, denying the Penguins with 23 crucial saves.</p>
<h2>Blue Jackets' Offensive Blitz</h2>
<p>The Blue Jackets' victory was a team effort with Zach Aston-Reese, Mathieu Olivier, Damon Severson, and Cole Sillinger all finding the back of the net. This win, their first since October 30, improved their season record to 6-8-2. Pittsburgh's resistance came in the form of goals from Anthony Beauvillier and Michael Bunting. However, the Penguins' goalie Tristan Jarry, despite making 34 saves in his first start since October 16, couldn't stymie the Blue Jackets' attack.</p>
<h3>Penguins' Struggles Continue</h3>
<p>The Penguins, now with a 6-10-3 record, have tasted defeat in five of their last six outings. Their defensive frailties were again exposed by the Blue Jackets. Sidney Crosby managed to contribute an assist, but his goal drought continued, leaving him still two short of the 600-goal mark.</p>
<h2>Blue Jackets' Milestones and Key Moments</h2>
<p>The Blue Jackets' offensive prowess was on full display as they scored three or more goals for the first time in seven games. They were in control throughout the match against their Metropolitan Division rivals, a team that has historically caused them problems. One of the defining moments came when Dmitri Voronkov netted his second goal of the season, securing a two-goal lead for the Blue Jackets early in the third period.</p>
<h3>Key Statistics and What's Next?</h3>
<p>A testament to the Blue Jackets' teamwork was that fifteen players made it onto the scoresheet. Another notable milestone was Sean Monahan's 300th career assist, which he achieved on Voronkov's goal. Elvis Merzlikins also celebrated his 200th NHL game.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, both teams return to the ice on Friday night. The Penguins will host the San Jose Sharks, while the Blue Jackets head to Montreal for their next NHL encounter.</p>

A sprint love story does not come often in track and field sports. But when it does, it makes sure to steal the limelight. As the story of Noah Lyles and Junelle Bromfield has done. After dating each other for two years, on October 13, the athletes announced their engagement. And since then, the story has thrown up some beautiful couple of goals. Example? Check their updates on their new home. Further example? Recently, Noah Lyles intervened when Bromfield faced online hate. How? Let’s find out.  Last week, Netflix released the second edition of the Sprint docu-series. The four-episode docuseries have mainly focused on the happenings around the Olympic track and field trials and the Paris Olympics. However, the critics say that Sprint has revolved around only Noah Lyles, hyping his accomplishments in the French capital. Also, Letsile Tebogo criticized it, claiming the series was an “American show.” The argument is on giving almost small or zero space to other short-track athletes while keeping the lens on Lyles. Recently, another track and field sports enthusiast pointed out another flaw.  On November 14, the fan posted on X, “Junelle’s  entire role in the #Sprintnetflix series is to prop Noah up and act like his cheerleader. Nothing about her talent or her quest to the Olympic faces.” However, later Bromfield responded by penning, “And she is getting paid to do it . Must be exhausting.” In the meantime, Noah entered the debate and posted, “Easy Money.” Junelle’s entire role in the #Sprintnetflix series is to prop Noah up and act like his cheerleader. Nothing about her talent or her quest to the Olympic faces. — Bravo Barbie 🍬💖🇱🇨 (@AiokiNagato) November 14, 2024 Expand Tweet  The report is developing… Let the world know your perspective.

So, whenever a sprinter is offered an amount like the $100,000 from Mr. Beast, it is something that they can’t deny. Lyles does make money professionally by running in official events, but considering that large amount of money in just a single 50m dash was just too much for him. This time, while the Olympic champion was present on the red carpet of GQ’s Men of the Year 2024 award ceremony, he met Fanum. The streamer acknowledged Lyles’ race against his friend Speed, but for the guy who “Fanum Taxes” everybody out there, he wanted a sprint on the same red carpet against the gold medalist. So did Lyles accept Fanum’s offer? The answer is no. “How much money you got bro? I don’t run for free no more,” said the 100m Olympic champion. After racing in a charity run, Lyles is aware of the money that he could take away from any professional events, especially during a time like the off-season. Even though fans would’ve loved a race between these two, Lyles wanted the dollars first.       A post shared by GQ Sports (@gqsports) Is Noah Lyles right to demand payment for races, or should he embrace more charity events? Debate  While Noah Lyles did decline the offer to race against Fanum, both had a wholesome interaction on the red carpet. The Olympic champion has been on the radar of many after securing his career-first Olympic gold in Paris, and such charity runs also brought in even more fans for the sports star. However, the race between Speed and Lyles was close, which made many new fans assume that the streamer would’ve beat the sprinter if given another chance. But a track legend’s analysis of the 50m dash immediately overshadowed this claim. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The question became so popular among the track community that it eventually caught the attention of Justin Gatlin. The retired four-time world champion shared his thoughts on his Ready Set Go podcast, presenting a crucial detail, stating, “Um, but like I told people, Noah is, this is November. Noah is in no shape whatsoever. He’s not in speed and dirt in shape. He’s not in speed shape. That’s just his raw wake-up, not in-shape speed right there, and that’s what he gave.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad He was straightforward, putting up the facts that if this race happened during the time when professional events were going on and Lyles was focused on his regular training routine, Speed would’ve zero chance against the sprinter. However, just racing against an Olympic champion was something that Gatlin was impressed about the streamer and acknowledged his athletic prowess. Let the world know your perspective.

Miron-Imagn Images Debate How much of Naji Marshall's success is due to his family's work ethic and values? Naji Marshall’s rise to the NBA wasn’t just about basketball—it was about values. Since childhood, he witnessed his parents’ hard work, which laid the foundation for everything he would later accomplish. The sacrifices have driven him to turn into the individual we know and the hoopster he went on to become. So with that said, it’s time that we get to know about his family. Naji Marshall was born on January 24, 1998, in Atlantic City, New Jersey. That makes his nationality American. However, we aren’t aware of his ethnicity, so it would be wise not to assume anything. Now, going back to our beloved hoopster’s life story, it didn’t just stagnate in the place where he first opened his eyes. At 9, his family moved to Maryland, a shift defining much of his hoops journey. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Growing up in two distinct areas, Naji was shaped by two different basketball cultures. He says, “I grew up in both areas and both areas had high-level basketball. Between New Jersey and Maryland, I was able to have the best of those two states. I feel like growing up with the youth and grassroots basketball there and to be able to experience both of those areas was unbelievable. It’s made me the player that I am today.” Moreover, the hoopster attended Takoma Academy before transferring to Eleanor Roosevelt High School to play for coach Brendan O’Connell. This was a turning point in his basketball development. Naji Marshall’s family played a huge part in his upbringing. His father, Maurice Marshall, was a professional boxer- a man who knew the grind and discipline required to succeed. But after his brief career as a boxer, he worked as a basketball coach at an elementary school. Meanwhile, his mother Rayna Whitted, worked at Providence Hospital in Washington, D.C.   From them, Naji learned early that hard work, no matter the field, was a non-negotiable. He once recalled, “To be good at both of those professions, you have to put in a lot of hours. I just saw them get up early in the morning to go to work and have two or three jobs throughout their whole life and work as hard as they possibly could to have the best life; all of that came through with me on the basketball court. I just put everything I can into basketball. I’m trying to be the best that I can.” Basketball wasn’t just something Naji played; it became his way of life. The lessons from his parents—resilience, discipline, and dedication—fueled him on the court. Apart from his parents, he’s surrounded by his six siblings- Maurice, Martia, Craig, Tai, Ausin, and Myles. Nothing much is known about Marshall’s siblings, but we do know what Naji likes to do apart from basketball. How much of Naji Marshall's success is due to his family's work ethic and values? Debate via Imago Oct 7, 2024; Dallas, Texas, USA; Dallas Mavericks forward Naji Marshall (13) brings the ball up court against the Dallas Mavericks during the second quarter at the American Airlines Center. Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-Imagn Images While basketball consumes much of his time, he’s also found ways to unwind. In interviews, he’s mentioned how he liked to chill, especially during quarantine. You’d often find him hitting the gym or lifting weights, but when he wasn’t doing that, he was watching YouTube, listening to music, or just giving everything he does a break. However, the hoopster’s journey from Atlantic City to Maryland, from high school to college and now in the NBA, wasn’t just about basketball—it’s also about strongly giving back to his family. He has clearly excelled on the hardwood. Coming from a hardworking family, he took inspiration from his father’s work ethic and his mother’s dedication to helping others, which shaped his character. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Now, as a key player for the Dallas Mavericks, Naji Marshall continues to build on his foundation. With the support of his parents, he’s determined to be the best version of himself—both as a player and a person. Speaking of which, what about his faith in God? Here’s how he embraces it on and off the court. Naji Marshall has always been open about his faith. He explained, “I’m a Christian. It means strong warrior or survivor. My dad’s real name is Maurice, but his Muslim nickname is Naji.” It’s a reflection of the blend of cultures and beliefs that shaped him. His Instagram and X bios also say, “God First,” making it clear where his priorities lie. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad In an interview, he reflected on his NBA journey, attributing his success to divine guidance. “I’m blessed to be here. All glory to God. Just to be able to get in an NBA game, and just get a chance, is everything to me.” For the Dallas star, just getting the chance to play in the biggest hoops league in the world was a monumental achievement. It was a gift, to his prayers. Marshall’s spiritual journey seems tied to the work ethic and core values his parents instilled in him. Their sacrifices drove him to be more than just an athlete—they inspired him to give his best in every moment. Let the world know your perspective.

In the gymnastics community, the name Bela Karolyi invokes a lot of debate. While the impact left behind the legendary coach is undoubted, his popularity is still highly contested. During his tenure as the coach of the USA’s women’s national artistic gymnastics team, Karolyi brought the squad to unforeseen heights. However, as news of his demise reaches the world, gymnastics fans feel that many tears shouldn’t be shed. Since Bela and his wife Marta arrived in the US in 2981, the couple were given the responsibility of transforming the national gymnastics team. Under their able guidance, Team USA gained immense international success. However, Karolyi’s methods were a major aspect of criticism. Even now, as fans got to learn about the update on Bela, they weren’t up for hailing him as a true Titan of the sport. On November 16, GymCastic took to X to share that Romanian icon Nadia Comaneci’s coach Karolyi has passed from this mortal world. “We have received word that Béla Károlyi has passed away,” reads the caption of the post, along with an official statement from the Karolyi family. “Your enthusiasm for life will be remembered forever,” the Karolyi family waved goodbye to Bela with an emotional message. But the fans seemed reluctant to mourn the loss.

   One of the most surprising teams in the NBA this season has been the Golden State Warriors, who were a team that many wrote off during the summer, with the franchise’s inability to acquire another star player to play alongside stars Stephen Curry and Draymond Green in the wake of the departure of Klay Thompson. The Warriors have started the 2024-25 NBA season with an impressive record of 10-2, which has them in second place in the Western Conference behind Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and the Oklahoma City Thunder. For now, the Warriors seem to have another shot at being a legitimate title contender in the West, with Steve Kerr’s squad playing at a high level behind Curry. While enjoying the success of the Warriors after the first 12 games of the regular season, Curry was recently asked who he’d have in his all-time starting five, with some interesting choices from the future Hall of Famer: Himself, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Tim Duncan and Shaquille O’Neal via ClutchPoints. Steph Curry names his all-time starting 5 👀 ⭐️ Himself⭐️ Michael Jordan⭐️ LeBron James ⭐️ Tim Duncan ⭐️ Shaq Thoughts? 🤔 (via @DudePerfect)pic.twitter.com/0YNKR5w7aM — ClutchPoints (@ClutchPoints) November 16, 2024  That’s a pretty solid all-time starting five, even though it will spark some debate, as these lists from current players always tend to do. Jordan is almost always on these lists, so it wasn’t surprising to see him named by Curry, but all the other positions will have healthy debate, with different players potentially getting excluded, like Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Kobe Bryant, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, among others. As for Curry naming himself, he’s definitely earned that right and has a strong case for being on other players’ lists like this, as he’ll go down as one the greatest guards of all time.",2024-11-16

   Coming into Week 11, the New York Giants have lost five straight and are looking like a team that is more interested in what draft pick they’ll have in the 2025 NFL Draft rather than how the rest of the regular season will pan out. The one glaring need for the Giants moving forward is a change at the quarterback position, as it has become increasingly apparent that veteran Daniel Jones is not the answer the team is looking for under center. There’s no question that if the Giants get one of the higher picks in the first round of next year’s draft, they’ll be targeting a quarterback, which is probably why general manager Joe Schoen was at Saturday’s game between the Colorado Buffaloes and Utah Utes so that he can get a look at Shedeur Sanders. Ironically enough, during pregame warm-ups for both teams in Boulder, Colorado, a fan could be heard yelling at Schoen to get rid of Jones via Tom Fornelli of CBS Sports.

   After winning eight of their first nine games, the Phoenix Suns seemed to be the real deal and finally able to live up to expectations with three star players leading the way in Devin Booker, Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal. Unfortunately, the Suns have hit a rough patch recently, with Phoenix losing three of their last four games, coming off a loss to arguably the best team in the Western Conference, the Oklahoma City Thunder. During the loss to the Thunder, who beat the Suns by 16 in Oklahoma City at Paycom Center, Booker had one the worst performances of his NBA career, scoring only 12 points and going 2-for-10 from the field without a single attempt from beyond the arc. After the loss to Oklahoma City on the road, Booker spoke to the media and tried to explain why he wasn’t able to play at the level he’s accustomed to via Duane Rankin of AZ Central. “They were trapping me, If we make some shots early. I’m not in the business of trying to go score over double and triple teams,” Booker said. ""They were trapping me, If we make some shots early. I'm not in the business of trying to go score over double and triple teams."" Devin Booker scoreless 1st half in Suns loss to OKC. 12 pts. minus-29 On getting a bucket to get team going.

   After an inspired finish to the 2023 NFL season, the Las Vegas Raiders chose to remove the interim tag on Antonio Pierce and make him the head coach of the team moving forward, which seemed to be a move that won over the fans, media and players. However, things have changed drastically since Pierce made an impression on the team last year, as he seems to be losing the locker room while also making some believe that he shouldn’t be the head coach after this season with how he’s handled things during the 2024 campaign. Heading into Week 11’s matchup on the road against the Miami Dolphins, the Raiders have lost five straight games and look like a team limping to the finish, with their only hope of righting the ship being to bring in a talented young quarterback during the 2025 NFL Draft. In the meantime, Dianna Russini of The Athletic believes that Pierce doesn’t have much of a case to keep his job as head coach, with the storied franchise being a “mess” at the moment via The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz. “The Raiders are a mess,” Russini said. … “I think it’s going to be a tough case for Antonio Pierce to continue to be the head coach here just because there hasn’t been any success.” ""The Raiders are a mess… I think it's going to be a tough case for Antonio Pierce to continue to be the head coach here just because there hasn't been any success."" @DMRussini when asked about the Las Vegas Raiders and why they have lost steam from last year.

   After nine games played so far, the Pittsburgh Steelers are one of the best teams in the NFL, as their defense has been top notch led by superstar linebacker TJ Watt, and their offense has been formidable, even with the change at quarterback from Justin Fields to Russell Wilson. In Week 11, the Steelers will face perhaps their toughest challenge of the season thus far, going up against reigning NFL MVP Lamar Jackson and the red-hot Baltimore Ravens, who have won seven of their last eight games. This highly anticipated matchup between AFC heavyweights will have significant AFC North division implications and will likely be an all-out battle from start to finish with an elite defense and a high-powered offense. One of the keys to victory for the Steelers on Sunday in Pittsburgh at Acrisure Stadium will be the play of Watt, who is the undisputed leader of this team and arguably the best linebacker in the NFL today. Watt, who debuted a new look with a shaved head, spoke to the media ahead of Sunday’s game about the matchup with the division-rival Ravens via MLFootball’s X account. “Mixture of schematics guys playing fast. Simple defensive things like guys doing their job, trusting everybody to do their job and tackling. Tackling is huge,” Watt said.

   The Indianapolis Colts are 4-6 and face a pivotal contest against the 3-7 New York Jets on Sunday. Despite the fact that Indy has lost three straight, the team is second in the AFC South and a win tomorrow would keep pace with the Houston Texans. In preparation for the Jets, the organization announced several roster moves on Saturday. According to the Colts (on X), the franchise moved linebacker Liam Anderson from the practice squad to the active roster and cut defensive tackle Adam Gotsis. We have signed LB Liam Anderson to the 53-man roster from the practice squad and waived DT Adam Gotsis.  We have also elevated G Atonio Mafi and G Josh Sills to the active roster from the practice squad for #INDvsNYJ. — Indianapolis Colts (@Colts) November 16, 2024  Two other players on the practice squad, guards Atonio Mafi and Josh Sills have also been moved to the active roster. Anderson played college ball at Holy Cross where he had 14.5 sacks and six interceptions during his career. The 6’3″, 225-pounder went undrafted in 2024 and has spent the first part of the year on the Colts’ practice squad. Gotsis, a former 2016 second-round pick of the Denver Broncos, had just signed with Indy this past off-season. Mafi was a 2023 5th-round pick of the New England Patriots out of UCLA. He was waived by the Pats in August before signing with the Colts. Sills went undrafted in 2022 after playing collegiately at West Virginia and Oklahoma State. The Philadelphia Eagles signed him and then cut him in August of 2023 before being acquired by Indy days later. After facing New York, the Colts meet Detroit then have winnable games the remainder of the year against the Patriots, Broncos, Titans, Giants and Jacksonville. Even five wins in those remaining contests could keep Indy in the thick of the playoff hunt.",2024-11-16

   In many ways, Victor Wembanyama of the San Antonio Spurs has gotten better in his second season. But in some ways, he has gotten worse and there are troubling trends in his game. Speaking on SiriusXM NBA Radio, Gerald Brown said that Wembanyama is not using his size advantage and is relying too much on taking three-pointers during games. He said the Spurs need to break Wembanyama of this habit and insist that he use his size and strength more, get into the paint, and remain low in the post for the majority of the game. “You cannot win on a consistent basis…shooting threes,” Brown said. #Spurs star Victor Wembanyama is shooting half his shots from behind the arc.   @GeraldBlss and @Mitch_Lawrence discuss if this is a concerning trend. pic.twitter.com/Dzkc7nuaMx — SiriusXM NBA Radio (@SiriusXMNBA) November 16, 2024  The talented big man is scoring 22.7 points, 10.5 rebounds, and 3.7 blocks per game. As for three-pointers, he is landing 2.9 of his 8.6 attempts per game. That is a lot of three-point shots and it is hurting his offensive output. His 33.9 three-point percentage proves that Wembanyama isn’t explosive from beyond the arc. There may come a point in his career when he gets better with three-pointers but his reliance on attempting these shots is harming the Spurs. Because of his size and length, he should try to make his way into the basket more often and dominate teams that way According to Brown, Wembanyama’s priorities are in the wrong place and the Spurs should consider making him change. You can’t blame Wembanyama for putting up shots from downtown because just the other night he went 50% from the three-point line. He has talent from that part of the court but it’s just not enough, at least right now.",2024-11-16

   Ahead of last season, superstar quarterback and future Hall of Famer Tom Brady decided it was time to call it a career, as he announced his retirement after leading the New England Patriots to six Super Bowl titles and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to one, ending his playing days with the most Super Bowl titles by a player in league history. During the first couple of years of his retirement, Brady embarked on a new career by becoming a broadcaster for FOX Sports in the hopes of following in the footsteps of other former star quarterbacks who have been successful in the transition from the field to the broadcast booth, like Dallas Cowboys greats Troy Aikman and Tony Romo. Although it has been a bit rough for Brady during his first season in the broadcast booth, the legendary quarterback isn’t giving up and will have an opportunity to continue to perfect his skills in his new endeavor moving forward. In the meantime, Brady has been in the public eye quite often this year, like sitting courtside at a New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden and throwing signed footballs into the crowd on Friday night via MLFootball’s X account. LEGEND: Tom Brady just signed a football and threw it into the crowd at a #Knicks game pic.twitter.com/klFKlZ2tFV — MLFootball (@_MLFootball) November 16, 2024  With Brady launching a football into the crowd, it looks like he still has the arm strength he once had in his playing days with the Patriots and Buccaneers, even at 47 years old, which is impressive but nothing new for the legendary leader under center. It’ll be interesting to see what happens in Brady’s post-playing career and if he can succeed in the broadcast booth while potentially having success as a part-owner with the Las Vegas Raiders.",2024-11-16

   Heading into the 2024 NFL season, the Arizona Cardinals were not a team that was getting a lot of buzz for what they’d be able to accomplish this year, as no one really knew what to expect from Kyler Murray and company. Coming into Week 11’s matchup against the division-rival Seattle Seahawks on the road at Lumen Field, the Cardinals are sitting atop the NFC West division standings with a record of 6-4, as Arizona is riding a four-game win streak and looking like a force to be reckoned with moving forward. During the 2024 campaign, Murray has shown why the team selected him with the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft a few years ago, as he’s playing arguably the best football of his professional career while helping the Cardinals win games every week. ESPN’s Mina Kimes explains Murray’s impact on the Cardinals this season. “Murray is having a great season,” Kimes said. “At the moment, is second in QBR behind Lamar Jackson. He is best against pressure. That’s the biggest thing that jumps out. He has career highs now in a lot of metrics. He in not turning the football over. He is not taking a lot of sacks.” Kyler Murray has been *incredible* under pressure–leads the league in QBR, and putting up career-best numbers. On yesterday's episode, @Foxworth24 and I discussed what we're seeing from him and why it feels sustainable. 🎧: https://t.co/lOszPjfOsP  📷: https://t.co/9CToSpn7RI pic.twitter.com/oIsoL8Ic6y — Mina Kimes (@minakimes) November 13, 2024  If Murray can continue to play at a high level moving forward, the Cardinals have a legitimate shot to win the NFC West division title and punch their ticket to the NFL playoffs as a result. In Week 11, Arizona will need to win on the road against Seattle to improve their chances of being playoff-bound, and they seem to be the better team coming into this divisional matchup.",2024-11-16

Fortunately for Sean McVay’s squad, the Rams were able to show signs of life with a three-game winning streak before losing to the Miami Dolphins on Monday Night Football in Week 10. Although the Rams are sporting a losing record of 4-5 heading into Week 11, the Rams have an opportunity to get back on track while taking advantage of the lowly New England Patriots on the road at Gillette Stadium.

Arsenal did it. So did Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool, Leeds United and, of course, Wrexham. Now Plymouth Argyle are the latest football club to allow TV camera’s behind-the-scenes access to create a documentary. Ex-England captain Rooney has been in charge of Plymouth since May and has so far overseen 17 games, resulting in five wins, four draws and eight defeats.   Plymouth currently sit 18th in the Championship table, just one point ahead of the relegation zone. The Devon side’s quest to stay up with Rooney at the helm is seemingly going to be the focus of football’s latest documentary and, according to The Sun, filming is already underway. Rooney has been the subject of a documentary before.      Plymouth Argyle manager Wayne Rooney, 39, is set to star in a new documentary series      Ex-Derby, D.C. United and Birmingham boss Rooney has been in charge of Plymouth since May    In 2015, Rooney gave a camera crew access to his family home to create ‘Rooney: The Man Behind the Goals’. Rooney’s new documentary is being filmed while his wife Coleen is currently in Australia taking part in the ITV show ‘I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!’ Plymouth do not have another fixture until November 22 due to the international break. Their last game was a 1-1 draw away at Derby County, one of Rooney’s former clubs. Speaking after that game, Rooney told BBC Sport: ‘It was strange going into the away dugout. ‘I’m very thankful to the fans for giving me a good reception getting off the bus and at the end of the game. ‘I’ve had some great memories here at the football club during a very difficult period in the club’s history. ‘I’m sure the fans knew that in the time I was here as manager I did everything I could to try and keep the club sustained.      Coleen Rooney is in Australia where she is featuring on ‘I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!’   ‘I know there’s a mutual respect between myself and the fans and I wish the club all the best moving forward.’ Rooney was in charge of Derby from November 2020 until June 2022. Derby narrowly avoided relegation in his first season but went down at the end of the following campaign. Rooney then had a 53-game stint as D.C. United’s manager in the USA, before a much shorter spell as Birmingham boss at the end of 2023. Your email address will not be published.

It was a viral tweet from five years ago that famously asked the question. A video clip showed Rochdale, then in League One, scoring a beautiful, sweeping team goal made up of 16 passes that started with the team playing calmly out from defence. ‘Right, so f****** ROCHDALE scored this goal and you’re telling me Pep Guardiola isn’t having an influence on English football?’ read the accompanying caption. The post quickly became an internet meme because, as had become increasingly clear, yes, obviously he had. Never has that been clearer than in this season’s Premier League.   In 2015-16, the season before Guardiola took the reins at the Etihad, the percentage of goal kicks in the Premier League that ended in the defensive third of the pitch was 17 per cent. Just shy of one in every six. The rest? Hoof, up the field you go. This term, nine seasons after Guardiola’s arrival, that number stands at 61 per cent. Nearly two in three. More than half don’t even make it out of the penalty area. In the season before Guardiola turned up, goalkeepers completed 51 per cent of their passes. Now, they complete 71 per cent of them.      Pep Guardiola’s influence  has never been clearer than in this season’s Premier League.      The percentage of goal kicks in the Premier League that ended in the defensive third of the pitch since 2015-16 has increased  Those numbers are increasing season after season as more and more clubs turn towards a style of play that builds from the back —and not always, as we will discover, to their benefit. So, yes, Guardiola and his keep-ball philosophy has influenced English football in the last decade more than anyone else.      
 Just look at two of the new Premier League managers this season, Russell Martin at Southampton and Enzo Maresca at Chelsea. Eighty per cent of all Saints and Chelsea’s goal kicks don’t get out of their own area. Only Ange Postecoglou’s Tottenham average a shorter distance. Both are Guardiola disciples. Both are finding their principles reap different rewards. Maresca worked with Guardiola at City. At Leicester, Mads Hermansen played more passes than any goalkeeper in Championship history. Foxes fans often found the football dull but he led them back to the Premier League at the first time of asking and is now flying with Chelsea. Yet there are still grumbles. Fans of English clubs struggle to embrace tippy-tappy when they’ve been raised on a diet of blood and thunder. During the first half of their draws with Arsenal, loud groans greeted a misplaced pass from goalkeeper Robert Sanchez. ‘I am the guy who asks Robert to do that,’ said Maresca in his goalkeeper’s defence. ‘The moment he stops to do that, he is not going to play. Sometimes you make mistakes but it is not going to change the way we are going to play.’ Martin has a Guardiola quote from after he won the 2011 Champions League framed on the wall of his office. ‘When we win, the game model seems good and is not questioned,’ it reads.       
 ‘But bear in mind, we won’t always win. Then doubts will come. That is the moment when we will have to trust the model more than ever because the temptation to move away from it will be very strong.’ And, boy, are the doubts coming. Only City have played more passes than Saints this season but no side have lost possession in their own third more often than Martin’s men (75) and none have made more errors that have led to both shots on their goal (15) and goals conceded (6). Southampton are bottom of the Premier League but Martin refuses to yield. The question for him, and all developing sides who play that way, is whether that is faith or folly. According to data giants Opta, only five shots have been taken this season within 30 seconds of a team taking a short goal kick. Twenty shots, however, have been conceded that way. It shows that playing out from the back comes with a risk. If you get it wrong, in a division where sides are now so good at pressing, you get punished. There are twice as many goals from high turnovers, where a team lose the ball within 40 metres of their own goal, per game this season than there were 10 seasons ago. Brentford have conceded six goals from such situations. Saints, four. Three each for Brighton, Ipswich and Wolves. Burnley tried to stick to their possession guns last season and got relegated. Brighton do it now, and do it well, but they had to be practical under Chris Hughton for a bit when they first went up. It was part of a process. And while these developing clubs under exciting young managers have played possession catch-up, other top sides are either moving away from it or are more open to play differently when required — even Guardiola.      Southampton are bottom of the Premier League but Russell Martin refuses to yield    Arsenal, with a manager in Mikel Arteta who learned his craft under Guardiola at City, go long with more than two-thirds of their goal kicks. A quarter of City’s goal kicks go long too. It was more than a third in the previous two seasons. In their title decider against Arsenal in 2023, Guardiola knew he needed to beat Arteta’s high press so played 4-4-2 and went long to the big man up front. You see, Pep knows that sometimes even the most idealistic managers have to swap principles for points. Your email address will not be published.

The club are increasingly confident that the Norwegian will put pen to paper on a deal that would make him the highest-paid player in the Premier League, overtaking his team-mate Kevin De Bruyne who currently rakes in £400k. Recent negotiations between City and Haaland have reportedly been positive. As well as the proposed pay rise, the deal could see the striker extend his stay in Manchester by two years.   His current contract is up in 2027 but City want to keep him for longer, when he would be turning 28. However, The Mirror report that there is still one obstacle in the way of the Premier League’s top scorer agreeing a new deal.      Erling Haaland is in talks with Man City over a new deal worth a whopping £500k per week      Pep Guardiola’s deal expires next summer and there is heavy speculation over his future      The Norwegian striker left Borussia Dortmund to join City for an estimated £50million in 2022 Similar to the terms of his deal at Borussia Dortmund, Haaland wants to keep a release clause in his contract which allows him to leave if a club is willing to pay his hefty transfer fee. Currently, he has a £150million option in his contract which means City must accept any offer that matches this price. The club want to remove this clause or at least increase it significantly, potentially up to £200m – this is a major point of contention for Haaland. The 22-year-old would prefer to keep the possibility of him moving to another club open, especially amid rumours that the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona are interested in his talents. Currently, Haaland’s advisers – his father and Brazilian super-agent Rafaela Pimenta – are standing stubborn in this matter.  Having a release clause in his Dortmund contract is what enabled his blockbuster move to City – to deny him of the opportunity to take another step up in his career is a non-option for Haaland. This dilemma is particularly pertinent amid the heavy speculation over Pep Guardiola’s future.  The City boss’ contract expires next summer and there is no concrete indication that he will extend his stay.  If he were to leave, who knows how City will fare? By the looks of things, Haaland does not want to stick around and find out, hence the wrangle over a release clause in his new deal. Your email address will not be published.

The Champions League winner appeared at Masters Football earlier this week to represent Rangers, a club he made 50 appearances for in all competitions between between 2008 and 2009. During his time at Ibrox the 45-year-old won the Scottish Premier League during Walter Smith’s time at the club, before departing back to his native Portugal the following season.   The player in question is former Portsmouth and Tottenham midfielder Pedro Mendes. More than a decade after hanging up his boots Mendes has trimmed his trademark long hair, and began sporting a beard.  After starting his career at Vitoria de Guimaraes before being signed by a young Porto manager named Jose Mourinho in the summer of 2003.           Former Spurs and Portsmouth midfielder Pedro Mendes appeared unrecognisable during a recent appearance on Masters Football      Mendes made 88 Premier League appearances for the two clubs between 2004 and 2008      45-year-old was also part of Jose Mourinho’s Porto side that won the 2004 Champions League In his sole season at the Estadio do Dragao Mendes was part of the side that defeated Monaco to lift the Champions League, whilst also cruising to victory in the Primeira Liga. Mendes’ form led to interest from several clubs across Europe, but it was Tottenham that ultimately secured his signature. During his time in north London Mendes famously scored a phantom goal against Manchester United, when his effort was mishandled by Roy Carroll and crossed the line only for referee Mark Clattenburg not to award it.  He would then move on to Portsmouth under Harry Redknapp where he spent four seasons, making 58 Premier League appearances and scoring five goals. From there he would move on to Rangers subsequently Sporting Lisbon before ending his career back at boyhood club Vitoria in 2012. Mendes also earned 11 senior international caps for Portugal between 2002 and 2010, and was part of the squad that the last 16 of the World Cup in South Africa before being knocked out by eventual winners Spain.

KANE OR HIGH PRESS — YOU CAN’T HAVE BOTH   Thomas Tuchel has a big decision to make about Harry Kane. He is our best goalscorer, but will be almost 33 at the World Cup. My instinct is he won’t want to ditch the skipper — when Tuchel was the manager of Bayern Munich he signed him from Tottenham — but that would mean toning down the Jurgen Klopp-style pressing that he is famed for. Kane is not the man for that. His strengths are vision, touch and finishing. The other option, which worked for Lee Carsley in Greece last week, is to start with Ollie Watkins and bring on Kane later when there is more space.      Thomas Tuchel has been tasked with bringing home the World Cup after becoming the Three Lions new boss      Harry Kane (left) is our best goalscorer, but will be almost 33 at the World Cup At the Euros, England struggled to press when Kane led the line. It’s a fascinating problem, but one Tuchel needs to address. England have a manager capable of maximising the players at his disposal, even if it means adapting his own style. He won the Champions League at Chelsea with boundless energy and three at the back. And at PSG, he harnessed the talents of Kylian Mbappe and Neymar — they were never going to be turned into defensive geniuses. MAKE BELLINGHAM OUR NEW STEVIE G Tuchel has some great players to work with but none better than Real Madrid’s Jude Bellingham.  He’s absolutely vital to our prospects of becoming world champions. His versatility means he can excel in a number of positions, but that can be a hindrance if he’s moved around from game to game. Bellingham made an impact as a No 10 at the Euros, but he’s built to play box-to-box where he can use his athleticism as well as technical ability to make things happen. As Steven Gerrard used to do. For that reason, he should start deeper, closer to Declan Rice and allow Cole Palmer or Phil Foden to support the striker — Kane or Watkins.      Tuchel has some great players to work with but none better than Jude Bellingham Bellingham is brilliant at taking games by the scruff of the neck in midfield and breaking forward at the right times. Tuchel should give Bellingham a defined role now, so when we get to the World Cup his partnership with Rice will be second nature. Bellingham is still only 21 and he’s going to get even better. CLUB ENGLAND, BACK THREE AND A SURPRISE RECALL A successful World Cup requires Tuchel to keep the good atmosphere Gareth Southgate developed from Russia 2018. Representing your country became something the players enjoyed. Friendships were forged and you didn’t get the mass withdrawals Carsley has had to deal with. Tuchel will want to nail down one system. There isn’t enough time at international level for players to change from one system to another.  Personally, I don’t think three at the back is advisable because it means sacrificing a forward where we have so much talent.   Whether left back or left wing-back, England want a left-footer in that position. We suffered at the Euros for not having one. I bet Ben Chilwell is walking on air with the Tuchel appointment. They won the Champions League together and while Chilwell isn’t wanted at Chelsea now, this is an incentive for him to get a move in January and force his way back into the England reckoning. He’s definitely good enough. Your email address will not be published.

The 19-year-old winger earned man of the match as the Scots secured their first competitive win in 10 games by beating 2018 World Cup finalists Croatia 1-0 in the Nations League on Friday. Built up as the ‘Mini Messi’ when he left Dundee United for Sporting Lisbon in a £3million deal in 2014, midfielder Gauld has watched Doak at close quarters during Scotland’s Nations League campaign.   And, speaking after the Liverpool wide man earned rave reviews after traumatising Man City’s £80million left-back Josko Gvardiol, the midfielder tipped the former Celtic prospect to go from strength to strength. ‘He’ll just take it on his stride,’ said Gauld. ‘As much as I’m sure he knows, there’s a lot of his game that he can work on.  ‘He’s got a big future ahead of him if he keeps up the way he’s been playing so far.’      Scotland winger Ben Doak keeps the ball from Croatia defender Josko Gvardiol      Ben Doak celebrates after setting up John McGinn’s winner at Hampden A late impact sub as John McGinn claimed his 19th international goal with four minutes to play, Gauld was subjected to much of the same scrutiny as Doak when he was the shining light in a Dundee United team also featuring current Scotland team-mates Andrew Robertson and John Souttar. Removing himself from the front line by moving to Portugal, Gauld offers blunt advice to Doak on how to cope with the same level of scrutiny and expectation. ‘Shut it out. Don’t listen to it as much as possible,’ he said. ‘Just focus on football, play your game and listen to the ones round about you at your club and do what you can to get better. ‘With me it was just noise, I guess. I tried not to think too much about it. Obviously, I was young and in a different country (in Portugal), so it was nice to not understand everything that was being said. I could just try and focus on the football.’ Only Paul McStay and Rangers great Willie Henderson have earned more teenage caps for Scotland than Doak, currently on loan at Middlesbrough.  Asked if he had tried to offer any advice on coping mechanisms to his younger team-mate, the Vancouver Whitecaps playmaker added: ‘No, I don’t. Just leave him to it. He’s got his own career to worry about and his own future ahead of him. I’m sure he’ll figure it out.’ Doak made a key contribution to the late McGinn strike which kept Scotland hopes of second place in Group A1 and a pot one seeding in next month’s World Cup draw alive. Striker Lyndon Dykes is another huge fan of the teenager and his explosive impact on games.      Steve Clarke hails Ryan Gauld after the substitute impressed against Croatia ‘His pace is scary. He’s a good lad,’ said Dykes. ‘He’s at Middlesbrough at the moment, getting game time, but he’s performing week in, week out. ‘The experienced boys here have got him under their arm and he’s learning every day. I’m sure he’s going to have a great Scotland career and club career.’ Beaten 5-1 by Portugal, Poland now stand between Steve Clarke’s side and the chance to secure a minimum of a third-place play-off in Warsaw tomorrow night. Gauld acknowledged the collective relief at ending the national team’s longest ever winless run at Hampden. ‘It was good to finally get a win,’ he said. ‘It was a relief as well because it had been so long. ‘Just getting over the line, maybe not in the prettiest way, but getting the job done and being in with a fighting chance of still staying in the top group matters. ‘The past three or four games, the boys had played really well and not got the result they deserved.  ‘It wasn’t the greatest of performances, but getting the points is what matters and I’m sure everybody would take that.’ Your email address will not be published.

Interim head coach Lee Carsley, who takes charge of England for the final time before Thomas Tuchel’s arrival in January against the Republic of Ireland on Sunday, sprung a surprise by omitting Kane from his starting XI for the 3-0 win in Athens. Carsley insists Kane was not dropped but rather he wanted to give Ollie Watkins – who scored the opener – an opportunity.   But asked whether he was shocked at Carsley’s decision, Kane answered: ‘Probably a little bit, when he told me, it was like “okay”, getting my head around it. ‘I wasn’t down about it, I wasn’t worried about it, I understood where he was coming from and I think that’s part and parcel of being captain as well, being a leader, you sometimes have to take things in your stride. Asked whether he fears losing his place under Tuchel, who will hold a post-camp debrief with Carsley, the England captain added: ‘That’s going to be Thomas’s decision, for sure. But I think ultimately, from my point of view, I always feel like I’m picked for England on form and on credit. It’s not just because I’m England captain.      Harry Kane admits he was a little bit shocked at Lee Carsley’s decision to drop him on Thursday      Carsley opted to start Ollie Watkins up front in his penultimate game as the Three Lions boss ‘Now I’m here. I’m coming off the back of my best season, last season, individually and also this season, I started the year really well. ‘So maybe if I wasn’t playing as well as I have in the recent past, that could be an argument, but ultimately I feel like I’m at the peak of my game for my club, which is ultimately where you get picked.’ Meanwhile, Carsley has revealed he wanted to select Liverpool forward Harvey Elliott and Aston Villa midfielder Jacob Ramsey during his six games in charge. ‘It’s just a shame Harvey Elliott and Jacob Ramsey weren’t ready.

Boss Craig Bellamy was the width of a post away from losing his unbeaten record in Kayseri. Yet Wales go into their final Nations League B game at home to Iceland on Tuesday knowing they can still win promotion to the top tier. They probably needed to beat Turkey to have any realistic hope of overhauling Vincenzo Montella’s Euro 2024 quarter-finalists — they still trail the Turks by two points.   But given how events unfolded in Kayseri Bellamy still has to believe. Turkey racked up 25 chances to Wales’s four, none better than the last-minute penalty they were handed for a foul by Neco Williams. A crowd who had been hostility itself for nigh-on 90 minutes fell silent only for Kerem Akturkoglu, handed the role of hero-elect, to fluff his lines by hitting the post. ‘It would have been a huge shame had that gone in,’ said Wales goalkeeper Karl Darlow. ‘With the way we defended and the determination we showed, I thought we deserved a point.’ The tight, 33,000-capacity Kadir Has Stadium may not be one of Turkey’s better-known venues but the people of Kayseri, a city closer to Syria than Europe, were determined to mark the rare presence of the national team by sending shivers down Welsh spines.      Wales’ slim hopes of promotion from Group B remain alive after edging a 0-0 draw in Kayseri      Kerem Akturkoglu missed a penalty in the 89th minute, squandering Turkey’s chance to win And while Wales didn’t wilt, the first half could not have been more one-sided. Yet the best chance fell to Wales. Harry Wilson was the width of a post away from becoming Wales’s first man since Ian Rush to score in four successive internationals. After the break Bournemouth striker Enes Unal missed a sitter, further Turkish chances came and went until the gilt-edged one arrived on 89 minutes when Spanish referee Juan Martinez Munuera gave a penalty for Williams’ sliding tackle on Yunus Akgun.

Plus, Chelsea received some stunning Victor Osimhen news and Arsenal had a surprise Serie A target in the summer. There’s plenty to cover, so let’s jump right in. Viktor Gyokeres has admitted that the persistent links with Man Utd are ‘fun.’ Could Joshua Zirkzee make way for the Swede? Juventus like him but a lot will depend on Dusan Vlahovic’s future. Victor Osimhen is warming to the idea of staying at Galatasaray permanently, though it would be an almost impossible deal. Inter midfielder Piotr Zielinski has revealed that Arsenal were hot on his trail in the summer. Alphonso Davies’ agent has categorically dismissed reports that the Canadian has agreed a deal with Real Madrid. However, Spanish media still insists that his free transfer move in the summer is a done deal. Finally, let’s finish up with some more transfer news from around the world. A Dutch coaching legend has slammed the idea of Erik ten Hag taking charge of the Netherlands national team. Olympique Lyon face relegation to Ligue 2 unless they offload several players to balance the books. Here’s who your club should sign. Barcelona star Jules Kounde has admitted that he is falling out of love with football. Cristiano Ronaldo has announced when he will retire. Barcelona have moved on from Mohamed Salah and want Leroy Sane instead. Chelsea have made a U-turn on their plans of strengthening one of their defensive positions. Arsenal are far from the only side keen on soon-to-be free agent Jonathan David. Man Utd legend Nicky Butt is convinced that Alejandro Garnacho won’t be with the club for much longer. The Red Devils won’t have a free run at Leon Goretzka. Lastly, Fabrizio Romano has revealed what’s behind the links between Christopher Nkunku and Man Utd. Your email address will not be published.

The Longhorns (2-1) return to the floor after a resounding 105-58 home win over Chicago State on Tuesday. Johnson scored 19 points in just 22 minutes for Texas and has led the Longhorns in scoring in all three games of his collegiate career so far for a 25.3 average. Ze'Rik Onyema added 18 points for Texas while Arthur Kaluma had 15, Kadin Shedrick scored 12 and Julian Larry delivered 10. The Longhorns led from the jump, shot 57.1 percent from the floor and racked up 21 assists on 36 made baskets.   ""If you're a willing passer, a willing screener, then you're going to probably get a scoring opportunity, so sharing the basketball, moving the basketball, player movement, ball movement, we want those things,"" Texas head coach Rodney Terry said.    ""We don't need to dribble in the ball more than twice. Move the basketball, have great spacing. We're still early in our journey with that. We'll continue to get better as the season goes.""

The Cougars (3-0) hope to pick up their fourth win under new coach Kevin Young, while extending multiple home winning streaks. BYU has defeated 16 consecutive nonconference foes in a row at the Marriott Center and has won 21 straight at home in November, dating back to 2019. In addition, the Vandals (1-2 this season) are 2-3 all-time against BYU. Their last win over the Cougars was a 42-41 victory at the Helms Foundation Invitational Tournament in Los Angeles on Dec. 29, 1947. Dawson Baker led BYU to its most recent win on Wednesday, a 99-55 blowout against visiting Queens University of Charlotte. Baker scored 17 of his game-high 22 points in the second half and drained six 3-pointers. Trevin Knell added 16 points, freshman Egor Demin scored 14 with five assists, and Utah transfer Keba Keita had another double-double with 11 points and 13 rebounds. Young liked how his team responded in the second half after losing a bit of momentum -- understandable considering the Cougars roared to a 28-2 lead. ""I think the biggest thing was that we got off to a good start,"" Young said. ""We had a lull in the second half, and I just wasn't happy with our level of focus. We challenged the guys in the timeout to forget how much time there was on the clock, but I thought from that point forward it was a totally different game.  ""I like the way our guys responded to being challenged,"" he continued. ""It was good to see some guys get going offensively. There was a lot to like."" BYU shot 51.3 percent overall and outrebounded Queens 59-22. Idaho comes in having lost two consecutive outings -- 79-75 vs. UC Davis on Nov. 7 and Monday's 90-67 setback at Washington State. Junior guard Isaiah Brickner, a transfer from Marist College, topped Idaho with 13 points in his first start on Monday. Julius Mims contributed 11 points and 11 rebounds. But the Vandals couldn't overcome shooting 36.5 percent and losing the battle of the boards, 45-29. ""The big thing for us was our physicality,"" Idaho coach Alex Pribble told the Moscow-Pullman Daily News. ""They outrebounded us in a major way. And, you know, you can't win on the road if you're not going to rebound the basketball."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

The team placed the 37-year-old veteran on injured reserve Friday. ""Zuccy's such an important part of the team,"" Wild coach John Hynes said Friday. ""I've really enjoyed coaching him.

""""But, that being said, he's played a long time, too, and I know when he comes back he's going to be back to where he is."" Zuccarello is tied for third on the team with 14 points (six goals, eight assists) through 16 games this season, his 15th in the NHL.

Jenkins, 26, has not practiced all week. He has started all nine games this season for the Bears, who selected him in the second round of the 2021 NFL Draft. He has started 33 of 40 games in his career. Sweat, 28, missed practice on Wednesday and was limited on Thursday before a full session on Friday.

The Packers designated Lloyd to return from injured reserve on Monday and he was limited at practice Wednesday and Thursday with ankle and hamstring injuries. Lloyd, 23, landed on injured reserve with a high ankle sprain on Sept. 17. The third-round draft pick has played in only one game, rushing six times for 15 yards and catching one pass for 3 yards in a 16-10 Week 2 win against the Indianapolis Colts. Packers coach Matt LaFleur told reporters the team will talk to the league about a possible extension to Lloyd's 21-day practice window to return to the active roster, considering appendicitis recoveries can take two or three weeks. Offensive lineman Jordan Morgan (shoulder) also will miss Sunday's game. Defensive lineman Colby Wooden (shoulder) is doubtful while cornerback Jaire Alexander (knee) and safety Evan Williams (hamstring) are questionable. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

The rare card that features Skenes’ rookie debut patch was released in a pack on Wednesday. Now, the Pittsburgh Pirates are desperately trying to find that card. The Pirates are offering the fan who finds the card two Pirates season tickets behind home plate for the next 30 years and a softball game for 30 people at PNC Park, plus coaching from former Pirates players.  The package also includes a unique spring training experience, including a private tour of Pirates City and LECOM Park. It also includes a meet and greet with Skenes, two autographed jerseys and the ability to take batting practice with the team. Skenes also has the luxury of having a very famous girlfriend, LSU gymnast and social media sensation Livvy Dunne, who raised the offer. The person who finds the card can sit with her at a Pirates game in her suite.  An egotistical offer? Perhaps. She does have a ton of fans and obsessed followers online who would jump at the opportunity to meet her. But this has turned out to be quite the offer for a very rare card.  This card will be in demand. Skenes is going to be the NL Rookie of the Year and was named to the 2024 All-MLB First Team. It won’t just be Pirates fans searching for this thing. Collectors from around the country will be ripping packs in hopes of finding it.  Michael Rubin, the founder and CEO of Fanatics, has already hinted that he might have to outbid the Pirates on their offer. He has a net worth of $10.6 billion. If he really wants that card, he’s going to get that card. If someone outside of Pittsburgh finds the card, the offer might not seem that great. Maybe they could give you the face value of those home plate season tickets for the next 30 years? That would at least start a conversation.  This is one of those crazy scenarios where it really depends on who finds the card. If it goes to some preteen in Pennsylvania, the Pirates will be able to proudly display that card in PNC Park how they want to. But if some older, greedy sportswriter happened to get their hands on it, you better believe they would be calling Rubin and selling that thing to the highest bidder for cold, hard cash. Good luck getting that card, Pirates. Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

As for which coach has his program in better shape, well a clue may come Saturday afternoon when the Fighting Irish (2-0) visit the Hoyas (2-0) in Washington, D.C. With wins over mid-major teams, the former Big East rivals are off to promising starts. While Notre Dame has done it largely with players who were in the rotation last year, Georgetown's cast is mostly new. The gem of the Hoyas' recruiting class, Thomas Sorber, has been even better than advertised. Averaging 22.5 points and 11.0 rebounds in his first two college games, Sorber captured the Big East freshman of the week award. ""I don't think anybody can guard him down there,"" Georgetown guard Jayden Epps said. ""He's unselfish and he'll pass it out if they double. So I always tell Coach to look down there and try to get him established to just open up the rest of the game."" Epps shares the backcourt with transfers Malik Mack (Harvard) and Micah Peavy (TCU). The trio is averaging a combined 39.5 points and 11.5 assists, with Peavy adding 5.0 steals and 4.5 rebounds per game. The early reviews also have been good for Notre Dame, especially for improved Tae Davis. He has flashed his power inside and his quickness and skills on the perimeter. In the Fighting Irish's 86-77 win over Buffalo on Monday, Davis tallied a career-high 27 points to help save his team on a night in which it made only 5 of 20 shots from 3-point range. ""Last year, we're losing this game,"" Shrewsberry said.  Davis also played a big role on defense. He helped contain Buffalo top threat Tyson Dunn to nine points, including a 0-of-8 shooting performance from 3-point range to go along with seven turnovers.   Marcus Burton also excelled for Notre Dame, providing 19 points, nine rebounds and eight assists. Shrewsberry credited his team's bond off the court for their newfound ""resolve and toughness."" ""A team that's close off the court, it translates to what you're doing on the court and it translates the most when there's a little bit of adversity,"" he said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

The Commodores have four new players -- A.J. Hoggard, Jason Edwards, Grant Huffman and Tyler Tanner -- sharing primary ball-handling duties. They rank third in the nation in assist-to-turnover ratio (2.67), with Huffman (11-to-1) leading the way. Huffman was a disruptive, on-the-ball defensive presence in Wednesday's 85-69 win over Cal, collecting four of the Commodores' 18 steals for a team that ranks tied for 20th nationally (12.0) in thefts. However, new coach Mark Byington's free-flowing, fast-paced offense has underachieved in some areas. The Commodores rank 351st of 355 teams in 3-point shooting (21.4 percent) with 18 made on 84 attempts. ""I thought we showed improvement,"" Byington said after the Cal game. ""I don't think anybody knows the answer on how good this team is gonna be, they don't know right now, but we gotta work and we gotta do things together."" Jackson State (0-3), in Year 3 under coach Mo Williams, has been blown out by Houston (97-40) and Xavier (94-57) while outscoring High Point by 11 in the second half of an 80-71 loss between those two games. However, the Tigers did win their last game against a Southeastern Conference opponent, a 73-72 victory at Missouri on Nov. 19 of last season -- after Jackson State had lost its first five games by double digits. Jayme Mitchell Jr. leads the Tigers in scoring (15.0) while Romelle Mansel averages 12.7 points and a team-high 5.7 rebounds. Both are returnees from last year's 15-17 squad. ""We're a deep team this year,"" Williams said before the season. ""I echo over and over we've got 10-12 guys who can compete for minutes.

While Higgins is expected back, Taylor said ""we'll see"" when asked if four-time Pro Bowl left tackle Orlando Brown Jr. will play on Sunday. Taylor said the team will make a decision within the next 24 hours on Brown, who has missed the past two games with knee and fibula injuries.  Cody Ford would be in line to make his third straight start if Brown sits out again on Sunday.  Defensive end Trey Hendrickson did not participate in practice for the second straight day on Friday and is listed as questionable to face the Chargers. Thursday's absence was listed as a neck injury/rest day for the 29-year-old Hendrickson, who leads the NFL with 11 sacks. Per the Bengals, Hendrickson did not travel with the team due to Los Angeles due to personal reasons. He is expected to join the club Saturday but was listed as questionable on Friday's injury report. Higgins, 24, has 29 receptions for 341 yards and three touchdowns played in five games (three starts) this season. Cincinnati selected Higgins in the second round of the 2020 NFL Draft.

The Sooners (2-0) are coming off an uneven performance in a 73-57 victory over Northwestern State on Monday. Following a difficult first half in which it shot 33.3 percent from the field, Oklahoma needed a huge second half from guard Jalon Moore to emerge with its second victory of the season. Moore totaled 23 points and seven rebounds for the Sooners, who shot 53.6 percent (15 of 28) over the final 20 minutes. Moore scored 19 of his points in the second half and shot 5 of 7 from the field. Jeremiah Fears has been another bright spot for Oklahoma with 16 points in a 93-60 win over Lindenwood on Nov. 4 and 15 versus Northwestern State. ""(Moore) did a much better job at getting downhill in the second half,"" Sooners coach Porter Moser told reporters after the game. ""He got to his spots better and began to create well for others in the second half as well. He continued to get better as the game went on, which is what you like to see."" Stetson (1-2), which is coming off its first NCAA Tournament appearance in 2023-24, will attempt to account for Oklahoma's balance at both ends of the court and try to even its record against its first Power Four opponent this season.

Jordan Wood, a Tulane transfer, is averaging 12.3 points per game this season. Wingate transfer Josh Massey also has been consistent as he finished with eight points and seven rebounds in a 74-52 loss to The Citadel on Monday.

Holloway watched Seton Hall (1-2) drop a 57-56 home decision to Fordham last Saturday, and the Pirates came up just short again on Wednesday in a 49-48 road loss to Hofstra. Chaunce Jenkins posted 18 points and Dylan Addae-Wusu supplied 11 to go along with eight rebounds for Seton Hall in the latest setback, where the Pirates failed to score over the final 50 seconds of regulation. Still, Holloway doesn't want fans to panic and ensures that the best is yet to come for Seton Hall. ""We had two tough games. Fordham is an Atlantic 10 school, that's a good opponent. Hofstra is a quality opponent,"" Holloway said. ""Should we have lost this game? I don't think so. But these are the games you've got to have early on so we can have success later. ""What I would say to the fan base is step by step, we're going to get it together and figure it out."" The Seahawks (1-2) could pose a bit of a challenge for the Pirates, as they hung with No. 22 St. John's on Wednesday in what turned out to be a 66-45 loss. Wagner was within two with 10:54 left in the second half before landing on the wrong end of a 26-3 run that blew the game open.

Antetokounmpo's 59-point outing in Milwaukee's 127-120 overtime victory against visiting Detroit on Wednesday means he has led the team in scoring in four straight games. That production, which also included 14 rebounds, seven assists and three blocked shots, came in 43 minutes all while head coach Doc Rivers pondered whether he should be tapping the brakes.    ""It's right up there. I've seen a lot of great games,"" Rivers said. ""It's funny how a coach thinks ... 'We've got to figure out how to get someone else involved in this game.' ... That's how you feel. Then after the game, you realize how special that is.""    Antetokounmpo scored all except two of Milwaukee's 24 points in the first quarter, at least a temporary salve for the Bucks' slow start to the season.   ""Sometimes you have to be aggressive for the team,"" Antetokounmpo said.    The Hornets stumbled 114-89 to host Orlando on Tuesday night with Ball scoring 35 points. Ball is averaging 29.9 points per game, leading Charlotte in scoring in all except two games.   The Bucks and Hornets are off to less-than-ideal starts to the season. Each team has four wins.   The Bucks' win over the Pistons gives Milwaukee a winning streak for the first time this season. They have posted victories in three of their past five.   ""It tells you we're very, very connected as a team,"" Rivers said. ""I don't like our record. I start to like it more and more with each win.""   To be determined is whether either side likes the lineup it will have available Saturday.    The Bucks were hoping Damian Lillard could be back in action for the game in Charlotte after he missed the past two games due to concussion protocol. He has averaged 26 points and 6.6 assists per outing across 10 games. But Rivers said Friday that Lillard most likely wouldn't be available due to continued sensitivity to lights and noise.   If Lillard isn't back, at least Gary Trent Jr. might be getting untracked. He had gone 1-for-18 on 3-pointers in a five-game stretch before draining three shots from beyond the arc Wednesday night.   ""Gary can shoot and I kept saying that it's going to come at some point,"" Rivers said. ""He did need to see the ball go in, period.""   The Bucks, who've lost five consecutive road games, also had Bobby Portis Jr., who's averaging 12.9 points per game, out earlier this week with an elbow injury.    Forward Grant Williams moved into Charlotte's starting lineup for the Orlando game, replacing Tidjane Salaun. Tre Mann sat out the game in Orlando because of a lingering injury.   ""We missed him in a lot of different ways,"" Hornets coach Charles Lee said.   The Bucks have shown the willingness to alter their defensive strategy, turning to a zone against the Pistons.   ""It just took them off stride a little bit,"" Rivers said.    The Hornets, who've lost two in a row, will need to solve whatever defense they face. They managed a season-low point total in Orlando to go with a season-high 22 turnovers.   ""A couple of the turnovers, I would say, we saw the right play and just couldn't execute,"" Lee said. ""This is good for us to learn. We see that the bigs are up in pick-and-roll, our big is rolling, we try and make that pass and it's a little high or it's a little wide. It's actually encouraging for me because I know as we continue to go through this season, we're going to keep getting better and better."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

Nearly 50 percent of method-of-victory bets were on Tyson and 13 percent of DraftKings bets and handle were on the +150 odds that Paul would win by the same method.  Not every state with legalized gambling approved wagering on the fight, which altered standard rules with shorter round (two minutes) and heavier gloves (14 ounces instead of the standard 11). The New York State Gaming Commission (NYSGC) has banned any wagering on the match, citing the amended boxing rules.   Money backing Tyson caused consensus odds to lower this week.

""I'm trying to grade that really honestly,"" the former Cup Series champion recently told NASCAR.com when asked to assess his performance in the No. 9 Chevrolet for Hendrick Motorsports. Elliott, 28, recorded one win in the Cup Series at Texas Motor Speedway in April, adding 11 top-five finishes and 19 top-10 runs in 37 starts. The win at Texas ended a 42-race drought for the native of Dawsonville, Ga. Elliott reached the Round of Eight but finished second in a must-win situation in the Martinsville playoff race on Nov. 3. That was part of an encouraging stretch run that began with a runner-up finish at Bristol on Sept. 21 and included fifth-place showings in the playoff races at the Charlotte road course (Oct. 13) and Miami (Oct. 27). ""I am really proud of where we've come from and where we have been, particularly over the last few months of the season, and even more so over the last few weeks,"" Elliott said. ""I just feel like we have a really good direction, I feel like I have a good direction."" The 2014 Cup Series champ's career trajectory is back on track after an eventful 2023 season saw him miss seven races, six after breaking his leg in a snowboarding accident and one for a suspension for rough driving. For his offseason plans, Elliott said he might do some non-NASCAR racing, but he is also looking forward to taking a break before the 2025 campaign revs up in February. ""I think naturally you're going to think about racing, just because that's what we do,"" he said. ""But I certainly intend to just get away, take some time, recharge the batteries, just like everybody in the room here."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

Xavier could be next in line for such a challenge when the Demon Deacons visit for Saturday afternoon's game in Cincinnati. ""We're still a team that needs to learn to play 40 minutes,"" Xavier coach Sean Miller said. ""Not peaks and valleys. We can be better for the duration of the game. When you play a team like Wake Forest, that's what it's going to require for us to have a chance to win that game."" Xavier (3-0) is averaging a 20-point margin of victory in each game, including a 94-57 romp past visiting Jackson State on Tuesday. Wake Forest (4-0) has had two narrow victories in the past week, topping Michigan 72-70 on Sunday at a neutral site and then rallying past visiting South Carolina Upstate 85-80 on Wednesday night. This will be the Demon Deacons' first out-of-state game and first true road assignment. Wake Forest senior guard Hunter Sallis is 21 points away from 1,000 for his college career. Since joining the Demon Deacons last season, the Gonzaga transfer is hitting on 48.5 percent of his attempts from the field in 38 games (all starts). ""Hunter is doing a really good job when we set ball screens,"" coach Steve Forbes said. ""He's doing a great job of reading them and scoring or coming off of it, but when he comes off of it, the ball has got to go in the hole."" Wake Forest was just 7-for-26 on 3s against USC Upstate, with Davin Cosby making five of those. The Musketeers have been shoddy at times defending perimeter shooters, giving up an average of 12 baskets from 3-point range per outing in the first two games before limiting Jackson State to five 3s. ""We were better guarding the 3-point line,"" Miller said. On the flip side, the Musketeers drained 16 shots from 3-point range Tuesday night, marking their most since a school-record 19 in a December 2020 game against Oklahoma. For Xavier, this is the fourth of five consecutive home games to begin the season. This game is called the Skip Prosser Classic in memory of the man who coached for both schools. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

Fired in September after one season with the Chicago Sky, Weatherspoon previously worked as an assistant coach and a player development coach with the New Orleans Pelicans. The two-time Olympic gold medalist also was the head coach of Louisiana Tech. In choosing Weatherspoon and the others, Unrivaled officials looked for coaches with experience in player development, especially with the NBA or WNBA ranks. Unrivaled, co-founded by WNBA stars Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart, will feature six teams of six players each. Coaches will be assigned to the clubs on Wednesday, the same day players will be selected for each teams.

The Rams (3-0) are coming off a 74-65 win over Denver on Tuesday. Medved, however, said competing against the Rebels is another level. ""It's a great opportunity for us to go down there and challenge ourselves against a team that I think looks like an NCAA Tournament team, and it will be a great test for us early in the year to challenge ourselves and see where we're at,"" Medved said. ""I think our group is going to respond here from this."" Medved and Colorado State are no stranger to tough opponents during his first six years with the program. He guided the Rams to the NCAA Tournament last spring, beating Virginia 67-42 the First Four before falling to Texas in the round of 64. Colorado State is led by seniors Nique Clifford and Jalen Lake, who are averaging 21.0 and 16.0 points per game this season, respectively. Those are the only two who played significant minutes for last season's 25-11 squad. ""You've got young guys who have to go through it and learn from experience. Then you mix that with a lot of new faces,"" Medved said. ""You're still trying to kind of find your identity. You're kind of trying to work through some different things."" Jaylen Crocker-Johnson is averaging 8.7 points and 5.3 rebounds and Kyle Jorgensen has contributed 8.0 and 4.3, respectively. Ole Miss (3-0) needed a late surge to record a 64-54 victory over South Alabama on Tuesday night. The Rebels played without guard Matthew Murrell, who sat out with lower back concerns. Coach Chris Beard said Murrell is considered day-to-day and hopes he will be able to play against the Rams. ""He got banged up in the last game and worked tirelessly to play (versus South Alabama). He wanted to play (Tuesday night). It was more of a coach's decision,"" Beard said on the Ole Miss Radio Network. ""His heart was in the right place, but it's a long season. This will give him a couple more days to rehab and help the team on Saturday. ""He did a great job from when the last game ended all the way up until tipoff. He gave himself a chance. I really appreciate his effort and the trainer (John Raybon) did a great job. Day-to-day is what I'd call it right now. We're hopeful he can play on Saturday."" Murrell has averaged double figures in scoring in each of the last three seasons, and set a career high of 16.2 points a game in 2023-24. He is averaging just 9.5 points in two games this season.

Head coach Matt LaFleur is 10-0 against the Bears and counterpart Matt Eberflus is 0-4 in his career against the Packers. Since their bye week, the Bears played three games and dipped from 4-2 and contender conversation to hot water, dropping all three games with a total of 27 points. Eberflus made a change at offensive coordinator and promoted Thomas Brown to the play-caller role. While a yo-yo of personnel contributed, Chicago hasn't been committed to running the ball -- 43 attempts in the past two games -- compared to the Packers, who have games with 53, 37, 38 and 39 rushes. In turn, No. 1 pick Caleb Williams has been sacked 15 times with zero TDs the past two games. The Bears will know where they stand in the NFC North division by the end of the month. Sunday is the first division game for the Bears. They host the Vikings (7-2) next week and spend Thanksgiving with the Lions (8-1). Jacksonville Jaguars (2-8) at Detroit Lions (8-1), 1 p.m. ET, CBS Aaron Glenn has been masterful in helping Detroit rack up nothing but wins since Week 2. One prized pupil is hybrid defensive back Brian Branch, a playmaker and the heartbeat of the group since Aidan Hutchinson (knee) was lost for the season. Branch is the only player in the league with 25-plus passes defensed and 10 tackles for loss since the start of 2023. He'll get in on the assignments of slowing a two-headed monster at running back with Travis Etienne and Tank Bigsby, while also trying to prevent rookie WR Brian Thomas from getting behind the defense. Backup QB Mac Jones makes another start with Trevor Lawrence (shoulder) banged up. Jones passed for 111 yards last week. The Lions found a way to win with Jared Goff at his season's worst -- five interceptions -- in Week 10. He passed for 340 yards and two TDs in his last game against the Jaguars. No. 1 WR Amon-Ra St. Brown is going for his eighth consecutive game with a TD catch. Las Vegas Raiders (2-7) at Miami Dolphins (3-6), 1 p.m. ET, CBS With one tackle for loss, Raiders DE Maxx Crosby would become the third player in since 2000 with 100 TFLs, and he notched a sack in the last go-round with Miami. He's the menace in the trenches that worries Miami the most, even as the Dolphins are finding success with the short passing game and explosive RB De'Von Achane. The Raiders are searching for answers that didn't come from Luke Getsy, the offensive coordinator fired before Las Vegas took a bye in Week 10 to get new play-caller Scott Turner and his more prominent dad, Norv Turner, comfortable with existing personnel. QB Gardner Minshew received a soft endorsement from head coach Antonio Pierce -- ""what do we have to lose, we're 2-7"" -- and starts again after being replaced by Desmond Ridder in a blowout loss at Cincinnati before the bye. Los Angeles Rams (4-5) at New England Patriots (3-7), 1 p.m., FOX Rookie QB Drake Maye awakened Demario Douglas and Ja'Lynn Polk, who were nonfactors during Jacoby Brissett's run as the Patriots' starter to begin the season. But the Patriots aren't fully weaponized relative to their opposition Sunday. Matt Stafford has 25-plus completions in three games in a row because of the dynamic route-runners outside, Puka Nacua (9-98 last week vs. Miami) and Cooper Kupp (7-80). Bell-cow RB Kyren Williams is tied for third in the NFL with 10 total touchdowns to maintain offensive balance. Blocking in front of Stafford might have coach Sean McVay perspiring. New England's DE Deatrich Wise and LB Anfernee Jennings both had two sacks at Chicago last week and DE Keion White is among the league leaders in snap-to-pressure time based on advanced metrics analysis. New England had nine total sacks in Week 10, when Stafford went down four times. Cleveland Browns (2-7) at New Orleans Saints (3-7), 1 p.m. ET, FOX Jameis Winston knows his way around New Orleans, and the former Saints quarterback who previously started for division rival Tampa Bay comes to town trying to keep Cleveland out of the NFL cellar. The Browns are one of four AFC teams with two wins. Injuries on the offensive line and the switches at QB and wide receiver have made for a disjointed outfit in Cleveland. The Saints ended a seven-game losing streak in their first game under interim head coach Darren Rizzi last week, a 20-17 surprise takedown of NFC South-leading Atlanta. QB Derek Carr connected for two touchdowns with WR Marquez Valdes-Scantling. New Orleans allowed more than 400 yards for the fourth time this season, including 181 rushing yards, which is sure to catch the attention of Browns play-caller Ken Dorsey. Dorsey doesn't mind close games and wants to distribute the weight of the offense away from Winston's shoulders to RB Nick Chubb. Indianapolis Colts (4-6) at New York Jets (3-7), 1 p.m. ET, CBS Playoffs? The Colts are still thinking postseason and reversed their decision at quarterback as coach Shane Steichen pushed the reset button on second-year quarterback Anthony Richardson. Steichen sat Richardson days after a 23-20 loss to the Houston Texans on Oct. 27. Richardson not only struggled with accuracy in that game (10-of-32 passing), he tapped out in exhaustion before a key third-down play in the second half. The wake-up call the Colts desired didn't come from Joe Flacco, who helped steer the Browns to the playoffs after signing in November. Flacco threw a combined four interceptions in losses to Minnesota and Buffalo, including a pick-six in last week's 30-20 setback to the Bills on Indianapolis' first play of the game. The Jets' defense can make life difficult for Richardson, who has completed only 44.4 percent of his 133 passes for 958 yards with four touchdowns and seven interceptions. He's rushed for 242 yards, second on the team, but has fumbled six times in six games. Which Jets team will show up Sunday afternoon is the mystery. Interim coach Jeff Ulbrich summarized the defensive effort at Arizona last week saying he saw a ""criminal, egregious amount"" of missed tackles. Aaron Rodgers continues as the New York quarterback but the 31-6 loss at Arizona was a dud. Rodgers had 151 yards on 22-of-35 passing but lost 23 yards while taking three sacks. Baltimore Ravens (7-3) at Pittsburgh Steelers (7-2), 1 p.m. ET, CBS For the first time this season the Steelers are staring across the line at an AFC North division opponent and first place is up for grabs when the Ravens come calling. Two new faces make their introduction in the storied rivalry. The Steelers roll out QB Russell Wilson and the Ravens yank the curtain to shine the spotlight on RB Derrick Henry, the NFL's No. 2 rusher (1,120 yards, 12 TDs) who has a league-leading TD streak of 11 games. The Ravens lead the NFL in total offense (440.2 yards per game). Baltimore is the third team ever with 20-plus points and 375-plus total yards in each of its first 10 games of season. The full story there is the Ravens can't afford to take their foot off the accelerator because their defense has been user-friendly. The Steelers are giving up only 16.2 points per game, second in the NFL, and have had the number of Ravens QB Lamar Jackson, 1-3 all-time as a starting quarterback against the Steelers. Minnesota Vikings (7-2) at Tennessee Titans (2-7), 1 p.m. ET, CBS Why is Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell on the defensive about his quarterback? Sam Darnold is three TDs shy of his first NFL season with 20 touchdowns, but he's already at 10 interceptions after tossing three last week in a palm-sweat performance against the Jaguars. The Vikings won (12-7), and O'Connell said the focus should be on the result. Darnold does have multiple TD passes in three of four starts on the road for the Vikings and the Titans have proven capable of playing the role of easy prey. They've lost four of the past five games and are 1-3 in Nashville this season. Sunday provides another chance for the Titans to determine whether Will Levis can be the long-term solution at quarterback. He has seven touchdowns and seven interceptions in 2024 but unlike Darnold, there's no Justin Jefferson to turn to when times are tough. Tony Pollard leads the Titans with 666 rushing yards and three touchdowns but has been hindered by a foot injury. Calvin Ridley is the team's No. 1 wide receiver with 32 catches for 483 yards and three scores. Jefferson leads the Vikings with 53 receptions for 831 yards and five TDs. Atlanta Falcons (6-4) at Denver Broncos (5-5), 4:05 p.m. ET, CBS If Broncos rookie RB Audric Estime can hold onto the football, he's likely to assume a leading role in Denver's youth movement. Estime had a career-high 53 rushing yards last week and Javonte Williams has yet to leave the runway in what some projected to be a breakout season. The Falcons are doing just fine with a timeshare between Bijan Robinson and Tyler Allgeier behind Kirk Cousins in the backfield. Robinson is one of three NFC backs with 1,000 yards from scrimmage already in 2024 and can challenge the Broncos' underappreciated front seven. Denver's offense needs more of a spark. The Broncos mustered only 260 total yards in last week's 16-14 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, when Will Lutz's 35-yard field goal attempt was blocked as time expired. The week prior, Denver managed only 10 points against a Baltimore defense that had been torched all season. Seattle Seahawks (4-5) at San Francisco 49ers (5-4), 4:05 p.m. ET, FOX QB Brock Purdy had a season-high 353 passing yards last week in Christian McCaffrey's first game of the season. McCaffrey returns to Levi's Stadium on Sunday for the first time since January as the 49ers attempt to break up the logjam in the NFC West. McCaffrey has seven touchdowns and an average of 168.4 yards from scrimmage in seven career games against the Seahawks and WR Deebo Samuel averages a TD per game against Seattle. WR DK Metcalf plans to return from a knee injury this week with Seattle coming out of its bye week. The Seahawks have lost five of six games since a 3-0 start. Sagging defensive numbers are not encouraging with McCaffrey in the 49ers' lineup. In the 12-point defeat by San Francisco on Oct. 10, the Seahawks allowed a season-worst 228 rushing yards and 6.9 yards per carry to a 49ers' attack powered by Jordan Mason and Isaac Guerendo. Kansas City Chiefs (9-0) at Buffalo Bills (8-2), 4:25 p.m. ET, CBS At Highmark Stadium for a matchup of AFC frontrunners and division leaders, the Chiefs put their highwire act on display and go for a 10-0 start and 16th consecutive win dating to last season. QB Patrick Mahomes is 4-3 against Josh Allen and the Bills, averaging 289.1 passing yards per game with 16 total touchdowns in seven career starts including the playoffs. Mahomes might have his best detail of skill players yet this season with JuJu Smith-Schuster (hamstring) pegged to play alongside De'Andre Hopkins for the first time. With seven of nine wins coming in one-possession games this season, the Chiefs do have one cause for concern with the third-most reliable kicker in NFL history, Harrison Butker, landing on IR with a knee injury. Untested 25-year-old rookie Spencer Shrader could be called upon in a tight game Sunday in his K.C. debut. Buffalo claimed the past three regular-season games in the series, all of which were played in Kansas City. And the Bills can still tap into a revenge factor. The eventual repeat Super Bowl champion Chiefs eliminated the Bills in the AFC divisional playoffs 27-24 at Buffalo in January. The Bills rank third in points per game (29) -- the Chiefs average 24.3 -- and Allen didn't throw two picks in a game until a win over the Indianapolis Colts last week. Buffalo leads the NFL in turnover margin at plus-13. And the Bills bring a respectable defense of their own. The group is allowing just 19.3 points per game and has 19 takeaways, the latter figure ranking second in the league. Cincinnati Bengals (4-6) at Los Angeles Chargers (6-3), 8:20 p.m. ET, NBC The Chargers have won the past three meetings in the series with Cincinnati and put their league-leading defense (13.1 points per game allowed) on display against Joe Burrow. The Bengals QB is putting up MVP-caliber numbers and pumping the ball to WR Ja'Marr Chase, who put on a memorable show last week: 11 receptions, 264 yards, three TDs. Los Angeles has held opponents under 18 points the past six consecutive games and only one team -- the Steelers in September -- has put up 20. The Chargers are not a flashy offensive outfit and operate behind a physical offensive line that sets the tone in the running game to soften defenses to play-action threats from QB Justin Herbert. The Bengals are familiar with the Los Angeles RB duo of Gus Edwards and J.K. Dobbins, offseason imports from the Ravens' scrap heap who had a few stories to tell in scouting meetings this week. They've combined for 838 rushing yards and Dobbins has six touchdown runs. --MONDAY Houston Texans (6-4) at Dallas Cowboys (3-6), 8:15 p.m. ET, ESPN/ABC Edge rusher Micah Parsons returned from injured reserve to post two sacks last week and could be the key to collapsing the Texans' offensive line to make C.J. Stroud uncomfortable. Stroud hasn't thrown an interception in three of the past four games and Houston has benefited from a vintage Joe Mixon. He has six games with 90-plus yards from scrimmage and a touchdown, tied for the most in the NFL this season. Stroud has WR Nico Collins back from a hamstring injury to threaten Dallas over the top. The same can't be said for the Cowboys and CeeDee Lamb after backup QB Cooper Rush had just one pass completion of 10 yards in his first start of the season last week. Rush gets the call again and shares the backfield with Rico Dowdle, the decided No. 1 back for Dallas. Lamb has been up to the task in primetime games with Dak Prescott, catching 25 passes for 306 yards and three TDs. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

While Higgins is expected back, Taylor said ""we'll see"" when asked if four-time Pro Bowl left tackle Orlando Brown Jr. will play on Sunday. Taylor said the team will make a decision within the next 24 hours on Brown, who has missed the last two games with knee and fibula injuries.  Defensive end Trey Hendrickson was not spotted at practice for the second straight day on Friday. Thursday's absence was listed as a neck injury/rest day for the 29-year-old Hendrickson, who leads the NFL with 11 sacks. Higgins, 24, has 29 receptions for 341 yards and three touchdowns played in five games (three starts) this season. Cincinnati selected Higgins in the second round of the 2020 NFL Draft. He has 286 receptions for 4,025 yards and 27 TDs in 63 career games (56 starts). Brown, 28, has missed the past two games after starting the first eight this season, his second with the Bengals.  A third-round pick by Baltimore in 2018, he has started 100 of 106 games for the Baltimore Ravens (2018-20), Kansas City Chiefs (2021-22) and Bengals. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

""The test session will provide a valuable chance for Carlos to begin integrating into his new team environment, and he will drive the FW46 for the first time."" Sainz will join Alex Albon to provide Williams with a veteran driver lineup in 2025. Sainz is a four-time winner in Formula 1, with his most recent victory coming at last month's Mexico Grand Prix. It was his second win this season, following his March victory in Australia. Currently fifth in the driver's standings, Sainz is 63 points behind teammate Charles LeClerc with three races remaining. Ferrari has passed Red Bull by 13 points in the constructor standings and is 36 behind McLaren ahead of next week's Las Vegas Grand Prix.

Albon has claimed 12 of those, with the other five coming from rising youngster Franco Colapinto, who replaced American Logan Sargeant in August. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

Thank you for","Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker reported Friday that surgery on his left knee was done and was a success. ""Surgery went great! Thank you for the prayers,"" Butker wrote on X. The Chiefs announced Friday they had placed Butker, 29, on injured reserve and confirmed the signing of kicker Spencer Shrader, who had been on the New York Jets practice squad. Eighth among NFL kickers in points with 75 this season, Butker connected on 18 of 20 field-goal attempts and 21 of 22 extra points. Both of the missed field goals were on tries beyond 50 yards. Butker's career 89.21 field-goal percentage ranks third in NFL history. He has won three Super Bowl titles with Kansas City. Shrader has limited NFL experience. A 25-year-old rookie from Notre Dame, Shrader connected on both of his field-goal attempts for the Jets last week at Arizona. He joined the Jets after being released by the Indianapolis Colts, who used Shrader in Week 1 for three successful PATs as the injury replacement for kicker Matt Gay. The Chiefs (9-0), seeking their 16th consecutive win dating back to last season, visit the Buffalo Bills (8-2) on Sunday in a key AFC game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

The Bruins could not carry over the momentum of their 3-2 win versus the Blues on Tuesday. They became the second straight team to allow seven goals to the Dallas Stars in a 7-2 loss two nights later. ""Just got embarrassed (Thursday),"" defenseman Nikita Zadorov said. ""I thought we did a lot of good stuff in St. Louis, and (against Dallas) we ... just weren't there. Our effort wasn't there. ... We were not hard to play against."" Inconsistency in terms of both play and results has been a theme of the Bruins' season. Despite a 4-1-1 run prior to Thursday, Boston has won consecutive games only twice thus far, and only once have both of those games ended in regulation. ""It's been frustrating all year that we haven't been able to string like, three to four consistent games where we feel like our habits and details are consistently there,"" coach Jim Montgomery said. Even star David Pastrnak falls into the inconsistent department, having broken a seven-game scoring drought with goals in each of the past two games. He leads the team with eight this season. Charlie Coyle scored the Bruins' other goal Thursday after going without a tally in the previous four contests. A chance for home cooking in Boston is ahead, though. Seven of the Bruins' next nine games will take place at TD Garden. This time, a response is needed. ""We're going to make sure this is a building block for us, not a setback. That's on us to do that,"" goaltender Jeremy Swayman said. Since Tuesday's loss to Boston ended a five-game homestand, the Blues have seen their winless run extend to four games (0-3-1), although they picked up a point with a 4-3 overtime loss to the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday.  Brandon Saad scored twice to double his season goal total as St. Louis built a 3-2 lead after two periods, but Buffalo responded with goals in the third period and overtime to take two points. ""I think any point right now is a good point, but obviously we want to close out games and be able to hold on to the lead,"" Saad said. ""But, like I said, it's nice to get anything when you're kind of on the skid there, so we'll take it."" As part of lineup changes before Thursday's game, Saad was moved up to the second line with Dylan Holloway and Brayden Schenn. The Blues have been outscored 11-1 in the third period during the recent losing streak, so playing more aggressively in order to try to close games out remains a focus.  Against Buffalo, though, they did have an 8-6 advantage in shots on goal during the final frame.  It was a step in the right direction. Coach Drew Bannister was happier with his team's most recent effort.  ""They looked much more confident,"" Bannister said. ""We had opportunities, hit the post a couple times. But we've got to bear down on those opportunities, too, because there's not a lot of them a game right now. We've got to make sure (to capitalize) when we have those opportunities."" Defenseman Pierre-Olivier Joseph left Thursday's game and did not return due to a lower-body injury in the second period. He was set to be evaluated on Friday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

Coach Billy Napier made the announcement Thursday on his radio show. Lagway was injured in the second quarter of the Nov. 2 loss to then-No. 2 Georgia and carted off the field. Two days later, Napier said the injury was ""less significant"" than additionally feared. Lagway missed the Gators' 49-17 loss to another top team, Texas, last week and was replaced by Aidan Warner, who completed 12 of 25 passes for 132 yards. Starter Graham Mertz suffered a season-ending injury in Florida's Oct. 12 game against Tennessee, thrusting the freshman Lagway into the position. On the season, Lagway has completed 56 of his 92 pass attempts (60.9 percent) for 1,071 yards with six touchdowns and five interceptions. Florida enters the game at 4-5 (2-4 Southeastern Conference) in Gainesville, Fla., and needs two wins in its remaining three games to become eligible for a bowl game. The Gators also have No. 11 Ole Miss and Florida State remaining on their schedule. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

Now, the Frenchman will head into the third round with a one-shot lead over Rory McIlroy and Tyrrell Hatton, who both finished with a 69 at Jumeriah Golf Estates in the United Arab Emirates.  McIlroy, of Northern Ireland, remains the leader to win the season-ending Race to Dubai. He is seeking his third consecutive title and sixth overall.  But Friday, the spotlight was on Rozner, who said it was a round to remember. ""Just no mistakes. Of course, I putted really well,"" Rozner said. ""It's one of those days where everything goes in and I had a ton of fun out there."" And it set him up for the weekend. ""I just think the confidence clicked and everything is going the right way,"" he said. ""... I'm going to try to focus on having two solid days and see how it goes at the end."" Rozner went into the clubhouse as the leader after missing an eagle putt at the par-4 No. 16 and holing his birdie -- the seventh of the round.   McIlroy, who shared the lead with Hatton after the first round, birdied four of the first seven holes before he gave back two strokes with bogeys at the par-4 Nos. 8 and 11 holes.  ""I got off to a great start, 4-under through seven,"" McIlroy said. ""Feeling like I was in total control of what I was doing and then I just started to miss a few fairways around the turn. When you start missing fairways, the way the course is set up this week, you're going to start to struggle. ""So I made two bogeys in the next three holes. Steadied the ship a little bit but felt like I let a couple of chances slip by on 14 and 15. But played the last three holes well. It was nice to finish with a birdie and at least shoot something in the 60s after the start that I had."" For Hatton, of England, a 43-foot putt at No. 6 produced his first of four birdies on the round, which also included one bogey. Despite his lofty position on the leaderboard, Hatton wasn't satisfied. ""Pretty similar thing to yesterday to be honest in terms of just not feeling very comfortable. Yeah, just every shot felt like a bit of a struggle, I guess,"" he said. ""3-under is a pretty acceptable score, all things considered but naturally you always kind of -- you want to be better. ""So yeah, I guess it's fair to say I'm pretty frustrated."" Perched right behind the leaders is Joaquin Niemann of Chile, whose 67 left him alone in fourth and two shots back of Rozner. Three shots behind at 6-under are Rasmus Hojgaard of Denmark, Sweden's Jesper Svensson and Irishman Shane Lowry, all shooting 67s. They are tied with Keita Nakajima of Japan, who carded his second consecutive 69. McIlroy has a significant lead in the Race to Dubai standings and is all but assured of the season-ending DP World Tour title. He would not allow himself to presume anything on Friday. ""At this point, I'm just trying to win the golf tournament, and if I win the golf tournament, then everything else that happens alongside that is nice,"" he said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

Here are nine reasons why.","If you’re really cool, you get to call San Francisco’s football team the Niners. It’s these privileged bandwagoners who made reservations for New Orleans in February, believing their guys will run the table when the time comes. That leaves us uncool folks to concoct nine reasons this isn’t going to happen. Sorry to lead off here with Shohei Ohtani, but saying a 5-4 team whose wins have come over the Jets, Patriots, Seahawks, Cowboys and Buccaneers is Super Bowl-bound delivers a first pitch down the middle. If the playoffs started today, the 49ers would be packing for a long vacation. They aren’t in the postseason field as of the start of Week 11. Neither are any of the five teams they’ve beaten. That’s the reality. Alas, the playoffs are light years away, and there’s time to make up ground. The problem is the 49ers have played three would-be playoff teams so far and have lost to all three. At that rate, they’ll lose to the Packers, Bills, Lions and Cardinals, leaving them 9-8. So, you know what they say: You are what you are. And in this case, they truly are what they are: 5-4. Sure, the 49ers might win the rematch with the first-place Cardinals. But they also could lose this week to the Seahawks and again to the Rams next month. The fact is, there are no softies in the NFC West anymore. Alas, there are no powers either. Did I mention that the Cardinals currently occupy the catbird seat? So going 3-0 against the West the rest of the way is quite possible. And, unfortunately, it’s equally possible for each of the other three regional rivals. Coming off a relatively easy win over the Cowboys, followed by a bye, the 49ers had momentum and fans dialing up the reservations desk at the Bourbon Street Biltmore. A cakewalk over a Tampa Bay team without any receivers, another win over a Seahawks team they’ve already beaten, and … Have you been paying attention? This was a team that lost to a Minnesota squad still asking itself: Are we seriously starting Sam Darnold at quarterback? They blew leads against the Rams and Cardinals, then almost did the same against a reeling Cowboys bunch. When they struggled to hold off Baker & The Cream Puffs, it was yet another reminder that, thank goodness, this wasn’t a real team. If the 49ers win the division, they’ll get one playoff game at home. But that could very easily be against the Packers, who gave the home team fits last January even when the 49ers were a legitimate contender. And we’re just getting started. There’s no way the 49ers are catching either the Lions or Eagles in the standings, which plots a playoff map where they fly to Philly in the ice to face a vastly superior defense. Then, if they’re lucky, they get to retrace their flight pattern to Detroit a week later to see a much more powerful offense. The chances of beating the Packers, Eagles and Lions in succession? Less likely than a Mike Tyson retirement anytime soon. No team in the NFL is more top-heavy in expensive talent than the 49ers. But the uncompromising NFL salary cap assures that for every top-of-the-market contract, there are five bottom-of-the-market deals, and that’s why few teams attempt to take this path to glory. Think about the Boston Celtics and imagine if they had to play 11 guys at a time. That’s hard to do when you only have six not named Luke Corn Nut or the like. Every opponent seems to attack the 49ers differently, and it’s easy to see why. They’ve paid to dig themselves a lot of holes. The star wideout is going at it with the long snapper. Yikes. I get where Deebo Samuel was coming from. On the third play of the game in Tampa, Kyle Shanahan called in a play. It sounded like: Send Deebo around left end. I don’t care how badly his ribs are hurting; we need to score on this drive. Pow. But he gains 12, so Shanahan is proud. The team misses Brandon Aiyuk’s across-the-middle route running. They couldn’t afford to import an in-traffic pass-catcher at the deadline, so while Jauan Jennings hugs the sidelines as Aiyuk’s replacement, breath-struggling Samuel and gimpy George Kittle get more safety-targeting routes. You can’t lash out in pain at the boss, so some guy named Pepper gets peppered. After a much-needed bye, Samuel returned with sore ribs and Nick Bosa with a painful hip. They needed more time off, but Shanahan needed more wins. So they braved the Florida heat... and watched as Kittle’s overuse got him hamstrung. And Christian McCaffrey? Where a cameo might have been the doctor’s orders in his long-awaited season debut, he instead got 19 touches — the football equivalent of throwing eight innings despite a pitch count. Since Shanahan is unwilling to take the foot off the pedal, what the 49ers need right now is a rivalry game. Where are they when you need them? Bring the Raiders back to the Bay Area, let everyone coast through a four-touchdown win, and surely you show up for this week’s Seahawks game with a lighter injury report. But even Mark Davis seems to hate the Niners. The 49ers have lost confidence in kicker Jake Moody, and rightfully so. They caught a break when Moody got injured earlier in the year, then among 10,000 college kids being groomed under the pressure of the ESPN College GameDay spotlight, they somehow couldn’t find anyone better. So here we were again in Tampa, where three flubbed field goals nearly sent the 49ers home with a losing record. Chances are Moody will have to make a big one against the Eagles, Lions or in the Super Bowl. But he’s not even a sure thing on PATs anymore. I’d hate to be the long snapper, because chances are they’ll gang up on him next time. The 49ers have a top-10 quarterback, one that will start getting paid like one next season. It won’t matter if he wins a Super Bowl this February or not. That’s a break for Brock Purdy, because he’s not flying home with the trophy. As the 49ers know full well, the team with the better quarterback usually wins the Super Bowl. And as good as Purdy is, he doesn’t measure up to Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson, the AFC’s three leading men. One of those three likely is going to New Orleans. Good luck, Jared Goff.

"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Nike Cowers Behind Giannis Antetokounmpo To Take Shot at Jaylen Brown,https://deadspin.com/nike-cowers-behind-giannis-antetokounmpo-to-take-shot-at-jaylen-brown/,2024-11-15T14:42:22.224Z,A controversial post on social media from Nike surely came off as a shot of Jaylen Brown instead of complimentary to Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Ante,"Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown is living rent-free inside Nike’s head. Brown has been going at Nike since 2022, when, in a social media post, he publicly questioned just how ethical the popular supplier of athletic apparel and equipment really was.  “Since when did Nike care about ethics?” Brown said on X, formerly known as Twitter, after Nike disassociated itself from Kyrie Irving in 2022 because of the then-Brooklyn Nets guard posting a link to an antisemitic film. Then, when the Paris Olympics rolled around this past summer, Brown was left off Team USA despite being named Finals MVP in mid-June. The sponsor of the squad? None other than Nike.  “I do for sure,” Brown told CLNS Media in July when asked if he thought Nike played a role in the decision to bring 12 other players to France. “(There will be) more stuff to come with that, but as of now, I’m not gonna comment on it.”  All was quiet until a string of events went down this past week that brought Brown’s beef with Nike back to life. Sure, it wasn’t Archduke Franz Ferdinand taking a bullet to the neck to kick off a world war, but it was about as close as you’re going to get in NBA terms. Not really, but you get the point.  During a meeting between Boston and the Bucks on Sunday, Milwaukee star Giannis Antetokounmpo was called for a charge in the second quarter after elbowing Brown in the lane. He seemingly elected to be apologetic by extending his hand to shake Brown’s, but when Brown went to make amends, Antetokounmpo faked him out and pulled his hand back. After the game, a 113-107 Celtics victory, Brown referred to Antetokounmpo as “a child.”  The Bucks had to scratch and claw to beat the Pistons 127-120 in overtime three days later, but Antetokounmpo hung 59 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists on Detroit, and man, oh man, did Nike love that stat line. “Nothing childish about ‘em. 59 for the Greek freak,” the company’s basketball account posted to X following the game. Did we read that right? Did Nike, a multi-billion-dollar company, just subtweet Brown like my ex-girlfriend did to me my freshman year of high school? Is that how we’re doing things here in 2024? For a company that has been telling us to “just do it” for nearly 40 years, Nike has no hair on its chest whatsoever. If it has so much of a problem with Brown, it knows where to find him. He isn’t out there hiding. Say something directly to him. Don’t use Antetokounmpo and the 4-8 Bucks as your smoke screen. Chances are, we won’t ever see Nike directly attack Brown because it knows he’s right. This isn’t some morally responsible company we’re dealing with here. There would be no Nike Swoosh if it weren’t for kids overseas working in sweatshops, and the franchise has also been accused of “unlawful business practices.” People or entities in positions of power often lash out when their wrongdoings get brought into the public eye. We’re seeing that here. Most tend to be a little more macho, but hey, sucking up to Mr. Run-and-Dunk works, too. Don’t be surprised if Brown shuts Nike up with his performance on Saturday.

We'll all be watching Friday night as the Cavaliers look to make it a 14-0 start when they host the Chicago Bulls. Second-ranked Alabama has a big test on the college basketball court as it visits a Purdue squad that has won 20 consecutive home games. The No. 13 Boilermakers will look to win this matchup from the 3-point line. Just 12 months ago, the Washington football team was moving down opponents. Well, Kalen DeBoer left to coach Alabama, and now the Huskies are a mediocre team in their first season in the Big Ten as they head into a home matchup against UCLA. Let's check out those unbeaten Cavaliers as they battle the Alabama-Purdue clash for best hoops game of the night. The Cavaliers recorded a 119-113 road victory over the Bulls on Monday, and the victory wasn't easily attained. The score was knotted at 106 with five minutes left before Evan Mobley's dunk started a strong closing stretch. A win Friday allows Cleveland to tie for the fourth longest winning streak to start a season in NBA history. Chicago had no answers on how to control Donovan Mitchell, who had a season-high 36 points to go with eight rebounds, four steals and seven 3-point baskets. Mitchell followed up with 23 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists in Wednesday's 114-106 road victory over the Philadelphia 76ers. Zach LaVine was on his game Monday with 26 points on 12-of-20 shooting and the Bulls need him to be hot again in the rematch. Two nights later, LaVine scored a season-best 31 on 12-of-17 shooting as the Bulls notched a 124-123 road win over the New York Knicks. That victory was only Chicago's second in the past seven games, but the Bulls look capable of covering the 10.5-point spread. The Cavaliers have scored under 110 points just once and have allowed 100 or more in every contest.

Departed big man Zach Edey had 35 points and still-starring Braden Smith added 27 for the Boilermakers, while Crimson Tide star Mark Sears drained a career-best eight 3-pointers while scoring 35 points. Both clubs are 3-0 and untested, and this battle rates as a high-level exam. Smith has been superb in the early going, and he had 22 points, nine rebounds, six assists and five steals in Monday's 92-84 home win over Yale. Alabama was unimpressive at times during Monday's 72-64 victory over visiting McNeese State. Grant Nelson had a solid game with 22 points and eight rebounds and the Crimson Tide need that version of him again versus Purdue. The Boilermakers are shooting 43.7 percent from 3-point range, while Alabama is struggling at 30.1 percent. But review last season's game and the big takeaway is this: Sears is liable to have another huge game and carry the Crimson Tide to the victory.

This season, Washington is 0-4 in Big Ten road games with three of the setbacks by 14 or more points, including last week's 35-6 loss to then-No. 6 Penn State. Huskies quarterback Will Rogers has completed a solid 71.4 percent of his passes and has 13 throwing scores compared to five interceptions but he was pulled in the loss to Penn State. He has three interceptions and no touchdown passes in the past three games. UCLA has won three straight games after a horrid 1-5 start. After beating Rutgers and Nebraska on the road, the Bruins notched a 20-17 home win over Iowa last weekend. A stunning thing happened against the Hawkeyes: Leading rusher TJ Harden rushed for 125 yards on 20 carries after having 226 total through the first eight games.

In its 90-55 rout against Eastern Illinois on Sunday, Indiana (2-0) actually trailed 37-36 at intermission and was down 43-38 early in the second half. The Panthers were shooting nearly 60 percent from the field, getting open layups and 3-pointers almost any time they wished. And then the Hoosiers started doing things like applying ball pressure and playing passing lanes. In the final 18-plus minutes, they outscored Eastern Illinois by a whopping 52-12. Woodson knows outscoring every opponent by 40 points in a half won't happen but he'd like a continuation of that exertion and intensity. ""That starting group struggled the first half to defend,"" Woodson said. ""When we got the stops, we were able to rebound the ball and get it out, and get down. We (got) quick strikes up the floor. I was pleased with the way they played the second half."" Or as forward Malik Reneau explained it, ""We just changed our mindset going into the second half."" In Reneau and Mackenzie Mgbako, Indiana has more than enough firepower to beat anyone. Mgbako is averaging 24.5 points per game and has made 20 of 27 shots in two games, while Reneau and Oumar Ballo are averaging 16 points per contest. Ballo, an Arizona transfer, is adding 7.5 rebounds per game. As a team, the Hoosiers are sixth in Division I in field goal percentage at 57.1, thanks largely to Woodson's insistence on playing inside-out like the Bob Knight-coached teams he played for at Indiana. The Hoosiers should see more resistance in this game than they've encountered from two Ohio Valley Conference opponents. The Gamecocks (2-1) are coming off an 80-54 rout of Towson on Tuesday night, their second straight win after a surprising loss to North Florida in their season opener. Third-year coach Lamont Paris was most pleased with the defensive effort. South Carolina limited the Tigers to 29.6 percent shooting from the field, including 5 of 25 from the 3-point line, and earned a 39-31 rebounding advantage. ""That needs to be who we are,"" Paris said. ""I think it needs to start with having that sort of commitment and effort on what we're doing on the defensive end. We did try to make a concerted effort that the looks that they did get would be more challenged."" Offensively, South Carolina plays through Colin Murray-Boyles, a 6-foot-8 forward who collected 27 points and nine rebounds against Towson. Murray-Boyles is recording 21 points and 10.7 rebounds per game. Paris is high on Murray-Boyles' potential. ""He's got one of the highest ceilings of any player that I've ever been around,"" Paris said. Jacobi Wright (16.0 points per game) and Norfolk State transfer Jamarii Thomas (10.7) are the Gamecocks' other double-figure scorers. The programs are meeting for just the fourth time and the first in 26 years. Indiana owns a 2-1 series lead, taking the last matchup 76-55, on Nov. 6, 1988.          --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

The Blue Devils (2-1) suffered their first loss of the season on Tuesday in Atlanta, falling 77-72 to the Wildcats in a battle of blue bloods.  Phenom Cooper Flagg led the way with a stat-stuffing effort of 26 points, 12 rebounds, two assists and two blocks, but he dribbled into traffic and turned the ball over on what could have been the game-tying possession with five seconds remaining. It was an early-season freshman mistake for Flagg, who is expected to be a one-and-done player for the Blue Devils and enter the 2025 NBA Draft, where he is widely projected to be among the top picks. After the game, Duke coach Jon Scheyer didn't blame Flagg for his late-game fumble. And it's far from the last time he'll put the ball in his star freshman's hands with a game on the line. ""We're going to be in these moments a lot together, and I trust his instincts. I probably could have put him in a better position, to be honest,"" Scheyer said. ""But he's got to touch it and trust that good things are going to happen. I wish you could say that every time it's going to work out, and that's not reality. I'm just so proud of him. Again, what he did in that game -- he willed us in that game."" What Flagg could have used was a few more big-time plays from his teammates. Kon Knueppel shot just 1-of-8 from 3-point territory and 5-of-20 from the floor. Khaman Maluach finished 5-of-5 from the field, but he played just 23 minutes and battled some foul trouble. Caleb Foster shot 0-of-4 from behind the arc and had four points and two turnovers in 29 minutes of play. If Duke learned anything against Kentucky, it's that it needs more than just Flagg to win in big games. ""For us, we're going to grow and learn from this. I promise you that,"" Scheyer said. ""We've got a locker room full of guys that are disappointed, heartbroken. I'm with them. And we're going to get better."" Duke shouldn't have much of a problem dispatching Wofford (1-2) in Cameron Indoor Stadium on Saturday. The Terriers (1-2) have yet to beat a Division I opponent, with their lone win coming against Division II Erskine College. Since then, Lipscomb and Presbyterian have notched single-digit wins over Wofford. Guard Corey Tripp leads Wofford in scoring this season with 12.3 points per game while shooting 42.9 percent from 3-point range. Kyler Filewich averages 9.7 points, 10.7 rebounds and four assists per game. The Terriers look for strong play on the defensive side of the ball. ""Our defensive pressure has been really good,"" said Justin Bailey, who transferred to Wofford this offseason from nearby South Carolina Upstate. ""We have worked on it all summer and talk about raising the level every day in practice, film and even the scrimmages. I feel like I can bring that energy to that side of the ball and that is what I am focused on."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

The nearly perfect Kalkbrenner will aim to continue his early-season run when No. 14 Creighton battles Kansas City on Saturday night in Omaha, Neb. Kalkbrenner has been hotter than lava by making 35 of 38 shots, and his 92.1 field-goal percentage ranks third in the nation. He rates second nationally with a 29.7 scoring average, and also is contributing 7.3 rebounds and 3.0 blocks while helping the Bluejays (3-0) get off to a strong start. Kalkbrenner made all six of his field-goal attempts on Monday when Creighton rolled to a 78-43 win over Houston Christian. He had 16 points and five rebounds in 22 minutes. But the 7-foot-1 center was more impressed with a different number -- 328. That's how many wins at Creighton that coach Greg McDermott has recorded, as the victory over Houston Christian set the school mark. He surpassed Dana Altman (327 from 1994-2010), the coach he replaced. ""It's awesome that I've been able to be a part of it and having Mac as my coach for so long has been such a blessing in my life,"" Kalkbrenner said. ""To see that accomplishment for him is so awesome. To be a part of that, it's amazing."" McDermott said it is all the people and players who have been part of the program that made the milestone meaningful. McDermott already was more infatuated by how Creighton can be better defensively when it faces Kansas City. Interesting because the Bluejays have limited opponents to 34.9 percent from the field through the three games. ""We're trying to grow defensively,"" McDermott said. ""That's been a big focus of ours since our first game and we took a step in the right direction. ..."" ""Sooner or later, the defense and offense have to show up on the same night. Hopefully that's Saturday."" Steven Ashworth also is off to a solid start with averages of 17.7 points and a team-leading 7.3 assists. He has made 10 of 20 3-pointers. Kansas City (2-1) is coming off an 82-56 loss at No. 7 Iowa State on Monday. Jamar Brown scored 20 points against the Cyclones to raise his team-best average to 18.3 per game. Roos coach Marvin Menzies didn't think the losing margin would be as big as it was. ""You're always disappointed when you lose a game but there were really, really valuable lessons in this game,"" Menzies said. ""I thought it would've been nice to make it a little closer and make it more of a fight. I just felt like we didn't handle the ball pressure well."" Kansas City shot just 33.3 percent from the field against Iowa State. ""Lots of stuff to shore up and we don't have much time to lick our wounds,"" Menzies said. ""We have Creighton on Saturday."" Kansas City has been pressuring the ball well and is averaging 11.7 steals per game. Brown has a team-high eight. It has been nearly 29 years since the Roos beat Creighton. That was a 72-70 overtime victory on Dec. 28, 1995. In the most recent meeting, the Bluejays rolled to an 89-53 victory on Dec. 27, 2018.

Jones (27-1 MMA) last fought in March 2023, when he won the then-vacant heavyweight title against Ciryl Gane with a first-round submission at UFC 285. It was Jones' first fight in three years after he vacated the light heavyweight championship, which ended a decade-long stretch of title defenses against some of the sport's former champions, including Quinton Jackson, Lyoto Machida, Mauricio Rua and Rashad Evans. Jones said Thursday he isn't looking past Miocic (20-4 MMA) to focus on other noteworthy challengers, such as UFC light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira or interim heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall. ""Right now, I'm focused on Saturday,"" Jones said. ""Saturday is just a few days away, and that's the biggest thing for me right now."" Miocic, the former UFC heavyweight champion, is fresh off a lengthy layoff from the sport. He last competed at UFC 260 in March 2021 against Francis Ngannou, the current PFL champion. Ngannou won the fight by knockout to become the UFC champion at the time, beginning an era that saw him defend the belt just once amidst eventual failed contract negotiations with the promotion. Miocic called out Las Vegas oddsmakers, suggesting he must prove his doubters wrong again as a sizable betting underdog. ""Nothing new to me,"" Miocic said. ""I train just as hard as anyone else."" He added, ""Vegas hates me. I'm gonna keep it that way."" The co-main event features a rematch of a UFC lightweight title bout from 2021. Charles Oliveira (34-10 MMA), who won the belt three years before losing it for missing weight the next year, opposes Michael Chandler (23-8 MMA) in a non-championship match. The winner will likely remain in title contention entering 2025. Chandler initially was scheduled to face Conor McGregor in June in the main event of UFC 303, but a toe injury sidelined McGregor.

""They've come down to the end, just about every one of them, and expect this to be the same way on Saturday night. We'll have our hands full."" Wake Forest (4-5, 2-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) is 3-0 in road games, winning those by a combined 10 points. The Demon Deacons are trying to bounce back from a 46-36 loss to Cal. ""You play with fire, you're going to get burned,"" Wake Forest coach Dave Clawson said. ""We've played with fire too much this year."" However, there's no time for the Demon Deacons to mope. ""There's nothing like ... when you play a Big Four game,"" Clawson said of a matchup with an in-state ACC rival. ""We still have goals this season."" North Carolina (5-4, 2-3) won two in a row before having last weekend off. ""We've had a great week of practice,"" Brown said. The two-game winning streak was defined by a defense that collected a total of 17 sacks in those outings. North Carolina quarterback Jacolby Criswell has thrown for 11 touchdowns with three interceptions this season, and his recent progress has been encouraging. ""He's not turning the ball over,"" Brown said. ""He's protecting the ball better. He's making plays with his feet. I really like the decisions that he's making."" North Carolina running back Omarion Hampton has gained more than 100 yards in eight out of nine games this season for a total of 1,178 yards and 13 rushing touchdowns. ""When you can run the ball, everything else works,"" Brown said. Wake Forest has a ground attack led by running back Demond Claiborne, who has 824 rushing yards and nine touchdowns. ""He's a guy that can beat you because he's quick, he's fast, he's tough, he breaks tackles,"" Brown said.

The 58-55 final in 2021 and the 36-34 result in 2022 were full of momentum swings in both directions.

A win over the Terrapins (4-5, 1-5 Big Ten) would make Rutgers (5-4, 2-4) bowl-eligible in consecutive seasons for the first time since it made four straight bowls from 2011 to 2014. Schiano returned for his second stint with the Scarlet Knights in 2020 after Rutgers endured five straight losing seasons. He previously had led the Scarlet Knights to relevance during his first head coaching tenure from 2001 to 2011 before leaving to coach the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Schiano's second Rutgers tenure started with three losing campaigns -- albeit with a bowl appearance in 2021 -- but began to take shape last year, when the Scarlet Knights finished 7-6 and won the Pinstripe Bowl. Rutgers now is on the brink of something it has not achieved in a decade, but the Scarlet Knights must first snap their head-to-head skid against Maryland. The Terrapins won each of the past three meetings by at least 18 points. ""Offensively very explosive,"" Schiano said of Maryland. ""Coach (Michael) Locksley does a great job. Certainly he's been a handful for us in our time back here. We haven't had a ton of success against them, especially playing on the road."" Terrapins quarterback Billy Edwards Jr. ranks third in the Big Ten with an average of 280.0 passing yards per game, but Maryland has lost four of five since a 3-1 start. Edwards threw for 206 yards while completing 22 of 44 passes with one touchdown and two interceptions in a 39-18 loss at No. 1 Oregon last week. Needing two wins in their last three games to reach their fourth straight bowl, Locksley said his team is playing its own version of ""playoff football."" ""The pillars of our program (are) how we start and how we finish, and obviously we've got some work to do to finish the right way,"" Locksley said. Rutgers snapped a four-game slide with a 26-19 win over visiting Minnesota last week.

The Jayhawks' reward?  A matchup with an Oakland program that made the Round of 32 last season. It's a much different Golden Grizzlies team than the darling of the NCAA Tournament with fearless sharpshooter Jack Goehlke off and graduated and 2023-24 leading scorer Trey Townsend wearing an Arizona uniform.  The program still is led by mainstay Greg Kampe, who took over the Golden Grizzlies in 1984 and currently is the longest tenured coach in Division I. He became the 10th active coach to win 700 career games in Oakland's season-opening win over Division III foe Defiance.  ""I came here at 28 years old thinking that I was the greatest coach in the history of coaches and that I would win 50 national championships and be the next John Wooden and all that kind of stuff,"" Kampe said. ""It didn't take long to find out that I don't know very much. I've been blessed that we were able to recruit great, great players and I've been fortunate to work with great people."" Oakland's current road swing included a stop in Champaign, Ill., to face a talented and youthful Illinois team that needed well into the second half to put the Golden Grizzlies away. Two returning seniors lead Oakland. DQ Cole and Tuburu Naivalurua are driving an offense that depends on effort and outside shooting. Cole is averaging 10.7 points per game, while Naivalurua is averaging 10.3 points and 7.7 rebounds.  Cole started 21 games for Oakland last season, including both NCAA Tournament games. Naivalurua saw significantly less action off the bench but still had a minor role in the rotation.  Kansas operates in a different reality.  The Jayhawks have a roster filled with high-end transfers and coveted recruits. That includes their best players, Michigan transfer and second-year Kansas center Hunter Dickinson, who was second on the team in scoring with 17.1 points per game last season. He also led the team with 10.9 rebounds.  Dickinson is up to 21.3 points per game this season and dropped 28 on old Big Ten foe Michigan State on Tuesday night. The offense has more bite and Dickinson has a sidekick in South Dakota State transfer Zeke Mayo. He's second on the team in scoring, averaging 15.3 points per game.  Head coach Bill Self was especially impressed with Mayo's 21-point performance in the win over North Carolina last Friday.  ""He met (his moment) with flying colors,"" Self said. ""He was great, he was fantastic. He made a couple of plays off the bounce that were huge. He was great, and we needed everything."" Returning starters KJ Adams and Dajuan Harris are averaging over nine points per game.  Harris started in all 34 games last season and averaged 8.5 points.  Adams started 32 games and averaged 10.6 points per game, down from 12.6 per game in his sophomore season.  Oakland enters Saturday's game coming off a 12-point loss to Illinois, an improvement from the 44-point loss at Boise State that had Lampe lit up.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

Baylor (5-4, 3-3 Big 12) is coming off a bye week after a last-second field goal sent the Bears to a 37-34 victory over TCU, giving Baylor a three-game winning streak. After the win, quarterback Sawyer Robertson was seen wearing a walking boot on his left foot, but Baylor coach Dave Aranda confirmed this week that Robertson is ready to go against the Mountaineers (5-4, 4-2). West Virginia coach Neal Brown said of the Bears, ""What's taken them from playing pretty good to now where they're playing really well is the ability to run the ball."" In the win against the Horned Frogs, Baylor threw for 242 yards and ran for 257. Bryson Washington led the ground attack with 196 yards and four touchdowns on 26 carries, and he added two receptions for 22 yards. For all the good they did on offense, the Bears struggled on defense, allowing 339 passing yards and three touchdowns through the air. ""We have to play the pass better, we have to play when the ball's in the air, we have to play that better,"" Aranda said. ""I think when we're playing zones, we got to communicate and execute those zone responsibilities better."" It is unsure who will lead the passing attack for the Mountaineers on Saturday, with Brown shutting down any questions regarding which quarterback he will utilize. In West Virginia's latest home game, Garrett Greene sustained an upper-body injury that took him out the rest of the contest and the next two. Greene was practicing in 11-on-11 drills this week for the first time since the injury, but in his place, Nicco Marchiol led the Mountaineers to back-to-back victories. Marchiol threw for two touchdowns and 198 yards in a 31-26 win against Arizona, then produced a touchdown through the air and another on the ground while passing for 156 yards in a 31-24 win over Cincinnati last week. Brown said Greene is ""available"" for action on Saturday. West Virginia's defense played a key role against the Bearcats, forcing three turnovers and returning two of them for touchdowns. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

Looking to snap their respective skids -- Nebraska (5-4, 2-4 Big Ten) is riding a three-game losing streak and USC (4-5, 2-5) has lost four out of five -- the Cornhuskers and Trojans are shaking things up on offense as they each come out of a bye week. Nebraska coach Matt Rhule said Monday that Dana Holgorsen would take over for Marcus Satterfield as offensive coordinator. Satterfield will focus on tight ends, while Holgorsen, the former West Virginia and Houston head coach, will call plays. ""He's got a long history of success offensively, both as a head coach but certainly as a coordinator before that,"" Rhule said of Holgorsen. ""He gives us a fresh perspective on looking at what we're doing and who we're doing it with."" In terms of Nebraska's offensive personnel, one question ahead of Week 12 is at quarterback. Dylan Raiola, the Huskers' starter throughout the season, came out in the fourth quarter of their 27-20 loss to UCLA on Nov. 2 due to a back injury. Reserve Heinrich Haarberg came on and completed 2 of 7 passes for 32 yards and threw a game-ending interception. Rhule said on Monday that both quarterbacks are working out in preparation for Saturday, but he did not name a starter. USC has its own shakeup at quarterback. Trojans head coach Lincoln Riley said Jayden Maiava will start in place of Miller Moss on Saturday after Moss threw three interceptions in a 26-21 loss at Washington on Nov. 2. The USC offense averaged 30.6 points per game with Moss starting, and the redshirt junior threw multiple touchdown passes in six of nine games. However, the Trojans' inability to finish in close games resulted in five losses by seven points or fewer. ""We've been pleased with his progression, with the way that he's practiced, with the way that he's picked up the offense,"" Riley said of Maiava after practice Tuesday. ""We just felt it was the right time. He's been working hard here during the last week, and it was definitely a benefit to have the bye week."" On Tuesday, the NCAA placed the Trojans on one-year probation and fined the program $50,000 for coaching violations in 2022 and early 2023. Riley, who ""was not personally involved in violations nor aware of the violations at the time the infractions occurred,"" according to the NCAA, said the program knew of the violations and probation well before the news became public. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

The Golden Bears (5-4, 1-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) have won two games in a row after dropping their previous four contests. They notched their largest margin of victory in 2024 when they trounced Oregon State 44-7 on Oct. 26. Then after a bye week, they earned their first ACC victory by topping Wake Forest 46-36 on Nov. 8 in Winston-Salem, N.C. ""We found a way to win,"" Bears coach Justin Wilcox said after his team racked up 500 yards of offense against the Demon Deacons. Cal's offensive production revolved around Fernando Mendoza, who threw for two touchdowns and ran for another. He set career highs for passing yards (385) and rushing yards (51), helping his team overcome a quiet day on the ground. ""The quarterback run game was a big element last week, especially late in the second half,"" Wilcox said. ""I should say that was noticeable. But we want to be able to (run the ball) because if we run the ball better, those stats are going to be even better."" Mikey Matthews led the Cal receivers with eight catches for 83 yards and a score -- his first of the season -- and noted afterward that there has been good energy surrounding the team. ""The vibes, the last few weeks, have been up,"" Matthews said. ""The guys are staying positive."" Syracuse (6-3, 3-3) could be facing a morale challenge after losing two of its past three games -- and even the one win in that stretch (38-31 over Virginia Tech) required a major second-half rally and overtime. The Orange absorbed a 37-31 loss at Boston College last weekend despite getting 392 passing yards and two touchdowns from Kyle McCord. ""We're just gonna keep pushing and keep playing,"" first-year coach Fran Brown said. Brown hopes that mantra resonates with his team early and often on Saturday. The Orange have not scored a first-quarter point in their past three games and have been blanked in the first quarter in five of their nine contests. ""It's kind of been a theme all year,"" McCord said. ""I feel like we either start really fast or we start really slow."" McCord certainly will keep a close eye on Cal cornerback Nohl Williams, who leads the nation with seven interceptions, including one against Wake Forest. The Bears have recorded at least one turnover in 11 straight games (and 44 of their past 47 contests). Of course, McCord is no slouch. He has thrown for at least 300 yards in eight of the nine games and is averaging 350.3 yards -- tops in the nation -- with 23 passing TDs, fifth in the country. ""They've done a real good job,"" Brown said of the Syracuse offense. ""They've been able to carry our football team.""

The Bearcats (2-0) are coming off an 83-56 win over Morehead State on Nov. 8 that was fueled by a strong defensive effort. Cincinnati held the Eagles to 30.8 percent shooting in the first half, forced eight turnovers and raced out to a 37-19 halftime lead. The margin grew as high as 34 points in the second half, and the Bearcats finished with a 15-2 edge in points off turnovers. Nicholls State (2-2) is playing the second night of a back-to-back set after earning a last-second win on Thursday, a 61-59 road victory over Northern Kentucky. Cincinnati was as efficient on offense against Morehead State as its defense was dominant. The Bearcats shot a blazing 60 percent from the field, led by Dillon Mitchell (7-for-7), Simas Lukosius (6-for-7) and Aziz Bandaogo (5-for-6). Mitchell, a Texas transfer, finished with 14 points and nine rebounds, while Lukosius logged 14 points and six assists. Bandaogo added 12 points and three blocks and was a big reason Cincinnati held the Eagles to just 20-of-56 shooting for the game. ""Dillon Mitchell was terrific,"" Cincinnati coach Wes Miller said. ""He was really good. You look down and he's plus-37, and I'm not a big plus-minus guy, because that stuff can be misleading, especially in limited data like a one-game situation, but it's not misleading (in his case). ""I thought he was a difference-maker on both ends when he was in the game. I was pleased with that. He's been showing us flashes of some things that he could do offensively, and I thought he was able to apply that to the game tonight and I was excited about that."" The Bearcats will need all the contributions they can get for the foreseeable future as starting wing Dan Skillings Jr. is out for several weeks after what the program is terming a minor knee procedure. Skillings is listed as week-to-week. Skillings' absence will hurt Cincinnati's rebounding efforts, an area of concern for Miller after the win over Morehead State. ""I'm not pleased with that at all,"" Miller said. ""To not have one offensive rebound after 32 minutes of play, that frustrates me. Dan's not playing, but he's a terrific offensive rebounder, but one guy shouldn't affect our ability to get to the boards."" The Colonels enter the Friday night game with the momentum of an exciting road win at Northern Kentucky, just 9 miles to the south. Byron Ireland capped a rally from five points down in the final five minutes with a layup with one second left to lift the Colonels past Northern Kentucky. Ireland finished with a team-high 15 points while Ike Cornish had 12 points and seven rebounds for Nicholls. Robert Brown III was the third player in double figures for the Colonels, finishing with 11 points. Mekhi Collins added nine points and 12 rebounds for Nicholls, which overwhelmingly won the battle of the glass, 57-33. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

The Wildcats (3-6) have lost four straight since then and will have to win their last three games just to gain bowl eligibility, starting with Saturday's nonconference home game against Murray State in Lexington, Ky. Coming off a bye week, talk of late has centered more on head coach Mark Stoops' future rather than the last three games of the season. At his weekly news conference on Monday, Stoops quickly debunked any rumors that he will step down after this season. ""Zero percent chance I'll do that,"" Stoops said. The biggest issue for Kentucky this year has been its offense, given the Wildcats are last in the league in points scored and yards per game. Brock Vandagriff threw for just 123 yards with a touchdown and an interception in the Wildcats' last game, a 28-18 loss to then-No. 7 Tennessee. Kentucky has scored 20 or more points in just four of its games this year, but Stoops believes there is still time to salvage something out of the season. ""We still have a quarter of the season left,"" he said. ""It's up to us how we decide to finish. I trust in our team and I believe in our team."" Kentucky figures to at least get on track against an FCS-level Murray State team that comes in 1-9 under first-year head coach Jody Wright. The Racers have lost seven games in a row since recording a 59-8 win over Mississippi Valley State on Sept. 14. In a way, Saturday's game will be a matchup of weakness vs. weakness. While Kentucky has had trouble scoring points, Murray State has surrendered an average of 45 points a game this year. ""The main thing that keeps showing up on us is we are still missing too many tackles on some run fits,"" Wright said. ""We're going to continue to practice physical and try to find guys who can do that. We definitely know we'll have to have instant-impact guys to come in and help us for next year. But we've got to get the best we can for the last two games of football from what we have on this roster currently."" Jayden Johannsen leads the Racers with 1,405 passing yards and seven touchdowns, but he has thrown 10 interceptions. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

Yet the Predators, who have earned one victory in six games (1-3-2), have a glimmer of hope they might be turning the corner. ""It's not going to come easy for us, that's for sure,"" Nashville forward Michael McCarron said. ""I do like our effort the past couple of games. I still feel there's time in games the tide goes to their side and it takes us awhile to get it back."" The Predators visit Calgary -- the third matchup in a five-game road trip -- on the heels of a 3-2 overtime loss to the Edmonton Oilers on Thursday. Nashville opened the trip with a 3-2 overtime loss to the Colorado Avalanche on Monday. In both games, the Predators erased a third-period deficit to nab a point in the standings. ""We have to try to keep building,"" said Nashville coach Andrew Brunette, whose club has managed points in three consecutive outings. ""We have to learn from experience here. Those times in the game we've hit a lull, we were a little bit slow, and ended up defending way too much."" After taking on the Oilers, the Predators are well aware they will face a rested Flames squad that will be looking to take advantage of a team on the second half of a back-to-back set. ""Back-to-back on the road, it's gonna be a greasy game,"" McCarron said. ""For us, it's gonna have to be greasy and we're going to have to get some dirty goals."" The Flames are kicking off a four-game homestand after a busy stretch in which they played five games in eight days. They appeared to run out of gas in a 3-1 road loss to the Vancouver Canucks on Tuesday. That was their lone regulation-time loss during a stretch in which they went 2-1-2. ""It's about learning from games or situations like this,"" Calgary coach Ryan Huska said of how his team performed during that span. ""You still have to find more, and a lot of that means just to play a simpler brand of hockey and make sure you're not putting yourself in a position to have to make up for an unforced error."" Although the Flames remain a pleasant surprise and still hold a playoff position, Huska and his team have plenty to work on, including a flagging power play that has converted only twice in the past 31 opportunities. Another is to find more offensive punch. Second-year player Connor Zary, who has been creating plenty of scoring chances, was moved to center on a line with Jonathan Huberdeau and Yegor Sharangovich during practice Thursday. ""I don't think we've really found the guy who's grabbed hold of it yet,"" Huska said of his decision to try Zary in the middle. ""With Connor, we want him to control play, a lot the same as he does as a winger. What comes with it is the added responsibility."" Zary, a 23-year-old drafted in the first round in 2020, is relishing the opportunity. ""There's a lot of details that come with it, but I'm used to that,"" Zary said, according to PostMedia. ""I've played it a bit at this level, played it a lot in the American League and obviously for my whole junior career. So it's not something that is new to me, but it's those details that you have to remind yourself of."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

Stroud appeared ahead of his years when he put together a strong rookie campaign last season and guided the Houston Texans to a playoff victory. However, things haven't come easy for Stroud of late and the Texans are looking for the star quarterback to begin a turnaround when they visit the Dallas Cowboys on Monday night. As Houston (6-4) has dropped three of its past four games, Stroud has completed just 53.7 percent of his passes. He has been sacked 18 times during that span. Stroud also threw two interceptions last week in a 26-23 home loss to the Detroit Lions. The Texans blew a 16-point halftime lead in that contest. ""I try to not only make plays but take care of the football and do the right things that win the game,"" Stroud said Thursday. ""Sometimes it goes our way, and sometimes it (doesn't)."" Despite their slump, the Texans still lead the AFC South by two games over the Indianapolis Colts. Still, getting Stroud back in form is a huge priority. During the tough times, Stroud passed for a career-worst 86 yards in a setback against the Green Bay Packers on Oct. 20, was sacked eight times and completed just 36.7 percent of his passes (11 of 30) during a loss to the New York Jets on Oct. 31. Stroud's six interceptions are more than he tossed (five) in 15 starts as a rookie. However, Houston coach DeMeco Ryans emphasized that the issues aren't limited to his quarterback. ""Nobody can shoulder all of the responsibility,"" Ryans said. ""For C.J., yeah, it's 10 other guys around him. But just like those 10 other guys and C.J., all the defensive players, special teams, everybody has a job to do and everybody is expected to do that job to the best of their ability. And if everybody executes and everyone plays the proper way and does their job the right way, then we'll be fine."" Dallas (3-6) has dropped four consecutive games and has bigger problems at quarterback with Dak Prescott (hamstring) done for the season. Cooper Rush started last weekend in a 34-6 home loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, and the results were ugly. Rush completed 13 of 23 passes for just 45 yards with a long gain of 10 yards. Trey Lance finished up and was 4 of 6 for 21 yards and one interception. Big-play receiver CeeDee Lamb had just 21 yards on six receptions. ""The work is going to get done,"" Lamb said. ""And, with me, I take full responsibility in getting in sync with (Rush). ""We're going to ride this thing out through the rest of the season, so I have the most confidence in him. I don't care what happened last week, and last week is last week."" Dallas coach Mike McCarthy made it clear that the team's 3.9-yard average per reception was unacceptable. ""How can you manufacture the ball getting down the field or getting it into green grass, we had a number of crossing routes that we felt good about and it just didn't happen,"" McCarthy said. ""And that's the way the game goes. ... Ball didn't go down the field enough, that's for sure."" Rush is dealing with a neck injury but was a full practice participant on Thursday. Cowboys star guard Zack Martin (shoulder) sat out practice, though he continues to play through the ailment. Cornerbacks DaRon Bland (foot), Caelen Carson (shoulder/illness) and Jourdan Lewis (neck) missed the Thursday session, as did tight end Jake Ferguson (illness), fullback Hunter Luepke (calf) and linebacker Nick Vigil (foot). Houston star defensive end Will Anderson Jr. (ankle) sat out practice Thursday. He missed the loss to the Lions. Also sitting out for the Texans with injuries were cornerbacks Kamari Lassiter (concussion) and Derek Stingley Jr. (hip) and defensive tackle Foley Fatukasi (foot). The Cowboys have won four of their six meetings with the Texans, including a 27-23 home win in the most recent matchup on Dec. 11, 2022. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

After collecting his 1,000th career NHL point in the second period, McDavid fed Darnell Nurse in the three-on-three extra period with a no-look, behind-the-back pass. Nurse's one-timer flew past Nashville goalie Scott Wedgewood to extend the Oilers' winning streak to three games. Nurse finished with two goals and an assist, while McDavid had a goal and an assist as he became the fourth fastest and fourth youngest to reach 1,000 points. Edmonton's Leon Draisaitl had a pair of assists, including the secondary helper on the winning goal. Calvin Pickard made 21 saves for the victory. The Predators got goals from Michael McCarron and Cole Smith, the latter tying the game with 2:48 remaining in regulation. Wedgewood stopped 31 shots. Flyers 5, Senators 4 (OT) Matvei Michkov scored with 55 seconds left in overtime as Philadelphia rallied for a road victory over Ottawa. Michkov's game-winner came from a sharp angle, as he banked the puck off Linus Ullmark's pad and into the net. His sixth goal of the campaign -- and first career overtime tally -- capped an impressive comeback by the Flyers, who trailed 4-2 with under 10 minutes left in regulation. Ullmark finished with 14 saves and Josh Norris had a goal and an assist for the Senators, who had won their previous two games. Lightning 4, Jets 1 Andrei Vasilevskiy became the fastest goaltender to notch his 300th career win, and host Tampa Bay stalled streaking Winnipeg. Vasilevskiy stopped 23 shots for the Lightning to secure the landmark victory in his 490th career game, breaking the 61-year-old record held by Hall of Famer Jacques Plante (528 games). Vasilevskiy, 30, became the 40th netminder to eclipse 300 career wins. Owning the NHL's best record ever to start a season at 15-1-0, the Jets got a goal from Adam Lowry, while Eric Comrie made 25 saves.

The Devils defeated the Panthers for the second time in three days and have won seven of their past nine games overall. Jake Allen turned aside 25 shots for the Devils to outduel Sergei Bobrovsky (23 saves) and send the Panthers to their second loss following a seven-game winning streak.

Johansson quickly redirected a pass to Boldy, who punched in a shot for his 10th goal of the season.   The sequence gave Boldy goals in back-to-back games.

The Red","The Detroit Red Wings and host Anaheim Ducks are each coming off one-goal victories ahead of their game Friday.   Both teams played Wednesday. The Red Wings defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins 3-2 in overtime, and the Ducks lost 3-2 to the Vegas Golden Knights.   Detroit defenseman Simon Edvinsson scored 1:30 into overtime to help the Red Wings end a two-game losing streak.   Detroit held the Penguins' superstar duo of Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin to one point -- an assist by Crosby -- despite six shots by each.   ""There's nights that you play Pittsburgh and they're Pittsburgh. There's nights that you play Pittsburgh and Sidney and Malkin look like they're going to take the game over,""  Red Wings coach Derek Lalonde said.  ""This was one of those nights. So, I give our guys credit. It's tough to check those guys. Everyone in the lineup has to do it on the road, and we did it.""   Detroit goalie Cam Talbot, who got his 250th career win, was a big factor. He made 31 saves, including two point-blank stops on Malkin -- the last came in overtime seconds before Edvinsson's winner.   The Red Wings also ended their five-period goal drought in the second, when Jonatan Berggren notched his first goal of the season to give Detroit a 1-0 lead one minute into the period. It was the Red Wings' first goal since they scored in the second period of their 3-1 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs on Friday.   Brock McGinn and Frank Vatrano scored for the Ducks, who have lost five of their past six games, in their home loss to the Golden Knights on Wednesday. Lukas Dostal made 36 saves.   ""I think there's a lot to build off of tonight,"" Anaheim coach Greg Cronin said. ""There's a lot of things we're doing well in our D-zone that were a little shaky before.""   McGinn's goal gave Anaheim a 1-0 lead with 2:21 left in the first, but Nicolas Roy tied it for Vegas with 49 seconds remaining in the period. The Golden Knights scored once in the second and third periods. Vatrano's goal with 14 seconds left cut the Ducks' deficit to 3-2.   ""As a staff, we try to break it down into how (the opponent is) generating chances, and I think tonight a lot of them came off our sticks,"" Cronin said. ""Just faulty passes and maybe some poor decisions, but they worked hard. I can't fault that. They worked hard and put ourselves in position to tie the game.""   The Ducks were without veteran defenseman Cam Fowler and forwards Robby Fabbri and Mason McTavish because of injuries. Fowler (upper body) and Fabbri (undisclosed) were placed on injured reserve before the game Wednesday. McTavish missed his second consecutive game with an upper-body injury.   Lucas Raymond leads Detroit with 14 points (a goal and 13 assists) and captain Dylan Larkin has a team-leading nine goals.   Troy Terry has 11 points (five goals, six assists) to lead Anaheim. Terry and Leo Carlsson are tied for the team lead in goals.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

After collecting his 1,000th career NHL point in the second period, McDavid fed Darnell Nurse in the three-on-three extra period with a no-look, behind-the-back pass. Nurse's one-timer flew past Nashville goalie Scott Wedgewood to extend the Oilers' winning streak to three games. Nurse finished with two goals and an assist, while McDavid had a goal and an assist. Edmonton's Leon Draisaitl had a pair of assists, including the secondary helper on the winning goal. That, though, wasn't the only celebration for the Oilers on Thursday. McDavid tied the game 1-1 with a second-period goal, becoming the fourth fastest and fourth youngest to reach 1,000 career points with some help from a couple of his longtime Oilers teammates. During four-on-four play, Nurse got a turnover in the Oilers' defensive end, and his feed to Draisaitl in the neutral zone created a two-on-one opportunity with McDavid. As they both continued toward the net, Draisaitl slid it to McDavid, who snapped it past Nashville goalie Scott Wedgewood for the milestone point 2:44 into the period. Less than three minutes later, Nurse got his first goal of the season, beating Wedgewood with a sharp-angle shot near the goal line. Brett Kulak and Mattias Janmark got the assists on the go-ahead goal. The Predators stayed in the game, thanks to the play of Wedgewood, and they finally converted late in the third period. Cole Smith got a breakaway opportunity and beat Edmonton goalie Calvin Pickard between the pads with 2:48 remaining in regulation. Zachary L'Heureux and Jeremy Lauzon assisted on the tying goal. As the crowd waited for history, Nashville took the lead on its first shot at 8:22 of the first period. Michael McCarron, alone at the top of the slot, deflected Roman Josi's pass past Pickard. With the Predators playing the first of back-to-back games, Wedgewood started for the fourth time this season. He made 31 saves as Nashville earned at least a point for the third straight contest (1-0-2). Pickard saved 21 shots. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

Dallas dropped its fourth consecutive game, with the losses coming by a combined eight points.  Jordan Clarkson added 20 points for the Jazz, and his bullet pass set up Collins' game-winner.  Utah picked up its first home win in six games this season. The Jazz were off to their worst home start since the franchise's inaugural 1974-75 season in New Orleans.

Carter also scored 21 points in the Wildcats' victory over LSU last season. The Tigers (3-0) defeated Kansas State for the first time after losing at a neutral site two seasons ago and in Baton Rouge last season.

Held to three points in the first half, the Eagles (8-2) rallied to win their sixth straight game and strengthened their NFC East lead over the Commanders (7-4). Jalen Hurts passed for 221 yards and rushed for 39. His 1-yard TD run with 12 minutes left gave Philadelphia its first lead at 12-10, but Jake Elliott missed the extra point after missing two first-half field-goal attempts. Barkley rushed for 146 yards and went over the 1,000-yard mark for the fourth time in his career. His 23-yard TD run stretched the lead to 19-10 with 4:58 remaining. Washington's ensuing possession ended on the first play as Reed Blankenship intercepted Jayden Daniels, just the third pick thrown by the rookie in 11 starts. Philadelphia capitalized on the game's only turnover as Barkley broke free for a 39-yard TD run with 4:38 to play. Daniels finished with 191 yards on 22-of-32 passing plus a late touchdown. Brian Robinson Jr. ran for 63 yards and a TD, and Austin Ekeler caught eight passes for 89 yards. Zach Ertz, who played for the Eagles from 2013-21, caught a 5-yard TD from Daniels and added a toe-tapping two-point conversion with 28 seconds left in his return to Lincoln Financial Field.

The Grizzlies will be making their first NBA Cup appearance of the season, while the Warriors will be seeking a second consecutive home win in West Group C play of the in-season event, having rallied to beat the Dallas Mavericks 120-117 in Klay Thompson's return to San Francisco on Tuesday. Memphis will once again be without injured Ja Morant (hip) and GG Jackson II (foot), and Desmond Bane (oblique) is questionable to return after a seven-game absence. The Grizzlies did get Marcus Smart back for their 128-123 road loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday. Smart had 15 points and six assists in 23 minutes off the bench after missing six games. The injury issues haven't stopped the Grizzlies from running up big numbers this year. They have gone for 131, 128, 134 and 123 points in their past four games, winning three of them. Unfortunately for the Grizzlies, they gave up a season-high-tying 128 points against the Lakers, including 38 while falling behind by as many as 13 in the first quarter. ""Love the fight, but you can't give up 40 (actually 38) points in the first quarter on the road,"" Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""We found our groove in the second and third quarter, but ... ""This is a learning opportunity. We've got to come out a lot better in the first quarter on the road."" In the Warriors, Memphis will see a team that now features two familiar faces -- De'Anthony Melton and Kyle Anderson -- both of whom played for the Grizzlies when they took Golden State to six games in the Western Conference semifinals in 2022. The Grizzlies will not have to face Melton, however, after the Warriors announced Thursday that the guard sprained his left ACL in the Tuesday win. He will receive additional testing to determine how much time he may miss. Melton's injury is a significant blow given his recent strong play. After returning from a back injury, Melton had his first Golden State double-double with 19 points and 10 rebounds in a win at Oklahoma City on Sunday, then contributed 14 points to the Tuesday victory over the Mavericks. Melton is averaging 10.3 points in 20.2 minutes while shooting 40.7 percent from the field over six games (two starts) this season. ""He's obviously a really important player for us and is a guy who we envisioned as, and has done a good job at, the starting 2-guard,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""It's a concern, for sure. We'll know more over the next few days."" Kerr did not specify who would replace Melton in the starting lineup. Buddy Hield (17.6 points per game, second on team) and Jonathan Kuminga (14.7 points per game, tied for third) are two candidates. Like the Grizzlies, the Warriors have stepped up the scoring pace this season. The 120 points they scored against Dallas marked their seventh contest of 120 or more this season. Golden State has gone 7-0 in those games. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

Etienne has rushed for 477 yards and seven touchdowns and also has 23 receptions for 140 yards in eight games for Georgia (7-2, 5-2). Freshman Nate Frazier will be the main ball carrier against the Volunteers. He is second on the team with 333 rushing yards and has scored three touchdowns on the ground.

Tennessee quarterback Nico Iamaleava remains in concussion protocol and is still listed as questionable for the contest.

Kaprizov carried the puck behind the net and into the right circle, where he spun and zipped a pass to Marcus Johansson near the left side of the crease. Johansson quickly redirected a pass to Boldy, who punched in a shot for his 10th goal of the season.   The sequence gave Boldy goals in back-to-back games.

After being held by Mason Lohrei on a break-in, Dadonov worked down the slot and fired a wrister under Swayman's stick-side arm. Coyle gave the Bruins life with 2:12 left before the first intermission, driving to the right post to redirect Trent Frederic's feed. Dallas never looked back after Stankoven re-established the two-goal lead at 14:15 of the second. Stankoven picked up and deposited a puck that dribbled loose off Thomas Harley's point shot. Back made it 4-1 at 15:56. Colin Blackwell dished the puck through a defender in transition, leading to the rookie one-hand tapping it over Swayman.

With goal No. 341, McDavid becomes the 99th NHL player to reach the 1,000-point plateau. By doing it in his 659th career game, the Ontario native becomes the fourth fastest to reach the milestone. With the teams playing four-on-four in the second period, McDavid took a pass from Leon Draisaitl on a two-on-one breakaway and snapped it past Nashville goalie Scott Wedgewood at 2:44. As the horn wailed, the Edmonton bench emptied to congratulate the team captain. Wayne Gretzky, who also reached the milestone wearing an Oilers jersey, needed only 424 games to notch his 1,000th point 40 years ago. Mario Lemieux of the Pittsburgh Penguins achieved the mark in 1992 after 513 games, while Mike Bossy reached the feat in 1986 after 656 games with the New York Islanders. Gretzky, Lemieux and former Detroit Red Wings star Steve Yzerman are the only players who reached this milestone at a younger age than McDavid, 27. McDavid also becomes the 10th active 1,000-point scorer in the NHL. John Tavares of the Toronto Maple Leafs was the last to join the club, doing so on Dec. 11, 2023. The milestone is the latest accomplishment for the No. 1 pick by the Oilers in the 2015 NHL Draft. McDavid's resume also includes five scoring titles and three Hart Memorial trophies (MVP). He also entered play Thursday on a hot streak, recording seven points (two goals, five assists) in the Oilers' prior two games. Darnell Nurse was credited with the secondary assist on the milestone play after creating a turnover in the Oilers' defensive end. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

The second match of the series is scheduled for Monday in St. Louis. The winner advances to the 2025 Nations League Finals held March 20 and 23 in Inglewood, Calif., and earns a spot in the CONCACAF Gold Cup from June 14 to July 6. The U.S. won the inaugural Nations League in 2021 and the subsequent ones in 2023 and 2024. Pepi scored his 12th goal in 32 international matches off a pass from Christian Pulisic despite the subpar field, which had loose chunks of turf. Pulisic drew the attention of two defenders and slipped a through ball to Pepi entering the right side of the box. He managed to control the ball on the dribble and banked a shot off the left post. Antonee Robinson nearly doubled the lead in the seventh minute but Andre Blake, who has played 245 games for the Philadelphia Union in MLS, made the save. Jamaica got a break in the 12th minute when Joe Scally committed a turnover and Shamar Nicholson worked into the box where Turner tripped him while reaching for the ball. Turner made amends when he extended to his right to make a two-handed punch on Demarai Gray during his penalty attempt. Jamaica controlled much of the second half but went down a player in the 86th minute when Mason Holgate was issued his second yellow card. The Jamaicans led in shot attempts 12-6 but had only two on target while the U.S. had three to run its unbeaten streak in the series to 6-0-2 since June 2019.

Vasilevskiy stopped 24 shots to secure the landmark victory in his 490th career game, breaking the 61-year-old record held by Hall of Famer Jacques Plante (528 games). The 30-year-old Vasilevskiy became the 40th netminder to eclipse 300 career wins. Meanwhile, Hedman posted his 583rd career assist, breaking a tie with Steven Stamkos for the second-most in franchise history. Hedman, 33, is six assists away from passing Martin St. Louis for the team record. Jake Guentzel scored twice, while Anthony Cirelli netted his 100th career goal for Tampa Bay. Brandon Hagel also scored as the Lightning ended a four-game winless skid  (0-3-1) and snapped Winnipeg's seven-game win streak. Tampa Bay killed all five power plays by the Jets, whose NHL-best unit entered with 19 goals in 45 chances (42.2 percent). Owning the NHL's best record ever to start a season at 15-1-0, Winnipeg got a goal from Adam Lowry, while Eric Comrie made 25 saves.  After his club put the first five shots on goal, Tampa Bay's Nick Paul entered the offensive zone on a rush, found Guentzel trailing him and slipped a between-the-legs pass. Guentzel then deposited his sixth goal at 7:24 for a 1-0 lead.  Winnipeg found its game following the slow start and fired seven on goal during the first period, but Vasilevskiy kept the visitors off the board through 20 minutes. In the second period, Hagel made it 2-0 by scoring a beauty off a pass from Darren Raddysh and roofing his eighth tally. Cirelli added to the lead 57 seconds later on his third score, with Hedman and Nikita Kucherov notching assists on the club's first power-play goal at home. Lowry finally gave Winnipeg some momentum when he hit the net for the third time at 6:54 in the second period.  Vasilevskiy denied 11 shots in the third, and the penalty-kill unit thwarted all three power plays in the frame. Guentzel's tally into an empty net with 21 seconds left completed the scoring.

Michkov's game-winner came from a sharp angle, as he banked the puck off Linus Ullmark's pad and into the net. His sixth goal of the campaign -- and first career overtime tally -- capped an impressive comeback by Philadelphia, which trailed 4-2 with under 10 minutes left in regulation. Ullmark finished with 14 saves and Josh Norris had a goal and an assist for Ottawa, which had won its previous two games. The Senators dominated much of the contest and beat Ivan Fedotov four times, but the Russian netminder also made a series of brilliant stops among his 33 saves. The game was tied 2-2 entering the third period before Norris skated in, with the Flyers giving him plenty of space, and his wrister from the left circle beat Fedotov at 4:27. Adam Gaudette doubled the advantage with a power-play goal 10:05 through the stanza, as he cut to the slot before lifting a nifty backhander under the crossbar. However, the Flyers came roaring back with a goal 37 seconds later and another two minutes after that. First came Anthony Richard's one-timer from the right circle, and then Bobby Brink stuffed home a rebound on a 2-on-1 rush. Philadelphia defenseman Travis Sanheim opened the scoring with a one-timer at 2:31 of the first period, but the Senators tied the game about 3 1/2 minutes later. Norris made a crisp backhanded centering pass through traffic to Brady Tkachuk, who ripped a wrister past Fedotov. Drake Batherson put Ottawa ahead 2-1 almost nine minutes into the second with a power-play goal -- his seventh tally of the season. But with just over a minute left in the period, the Flyers' Travis Konecny got behind the defense and Noah Cates found him for a breakaway goal -- his ninth of the campaign.

New York turned it on Thursday in the latter portion of the second after a slow start, falling behind in the opening three minutes. Zibanejad, who committed two turnovers that led to Winnipeg goals Tuesday, scored his first goal in nine games with 8:21 remaining and Vesey scored the tiebreaking tally with 6:45 remaining. Vincent Trocheck netted New York's third goal of the period with 3:39 left after interfering with goalie Mackenzie Blackwood's stick to nullify a goal by Adam Fox about two minutes earlier. New York's Igor Shesterkin made 25 saves after allowing five goals apiece in his previous two starts. Timothy Liljegren scored 2:51 into the contest and Fabian Zetterlund scored a power-play goal with the extra attacker with 27 seconds left in the game for the Sharks, who are 5-3-1 since opening with a nine-game skid (0-7-2). Blackwood made 32 saves one game after getting a 44-save shutout over the New Jersey Devils on Sunday. For the third straight home game the Rangers fell behind within the opening three minutes. After the Rangers failed to clear the puck from behind their net, Liljegren gained possession near the right point. His shot hopped over Vesey's stick and beat Shesterkin, who was screened in front. Zibanejad tied the score by beating San Jose defenseman Henry Thrun to a loose puck at the right side of the crease and hammered in the rebound of Fox's shot into the vacated side of the net. The Rangers went ahead when Vesey got a return pass from Sam Carrick and beat Blackwood with a backhander shortly after an offensive zone turnover by San Jose rookie Macklin Celebrini. After Fox's goal was disallowed, Trocheck eluded Tyler Toffoli and tipped in a pass from Artemi Panarin just above the left side of the crease.

Jesper Boqvist tallied against his former team and captain Aleksander Barkov set up a goal to extend his assist streak to a career high-tying seven games for the Panthers. Sam Bennett added a helper in his return from a one-game absence due to an upper-body injury. Noesen opened the scoring midway into the first period, but Boqvist forged a 1-1 tie two minutes later by slipping the puck between the legs of Devils defenseman Dougie Hamilton before tucking it past Allen for his third goal of the season. Bratt answered with a power-play tally two seconds before the end of the first. Reinhart scored off a faceoff in the left circle to forge a 2-2 tie at 4:45 of the second period before the Devils answered just 71 seconds later.

The AL Comeback Player of the Year award went to Chicago White Sox left-hander Garrett Crochet. Cleveland Guardians right-hander Emmanuel Clase and St. Louis Cardinals right-hander Ryan Helsley were chosen as the AL and NL Reliever of the Year, respectively. Ohtani, who didn't pitch in 2024 after undergoing elbow surgery, still made plenty of impact from the DH position. He became the first player in major league history to hit 50-plus homers and steal 50-plus bases in the same season, finishing with an NL-leading 54 long balls and 59 thefts. Ohtani also led the league with 130 RBIs, 134 runs, a .390 on-base percentage and a .646 slugging percentage.

Minnesota lost its third straight game and second in a row to the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday. The Wolves shot 7-for-39 (17.9 percent) from 3-point range in the 106-98 defeat. All-Star guard Anthony Edwards was 0-for-9 from beyond the arc. ""We've got the answers. The coaches give us ... the answers,"" Edwards said. ""We're just not doing it as a team, one through 15. They give us the answers every night. We come in here at 35 (minutes) on the night, and they tell us what we need to do to win the game, and somehow we don't do it every night. We've got to get back to it. We've got to mature, man."" Minnesota played without starting point guard Mike Conley, who was rested on the second half of a back-to-back. The 37-year-old is expected to be available against Sacramento. The Kings are striving to build on Wednesday's encouraging outing against the Phoenix Suns. De'Aaron Fox had 29 points, six rebounds and 10 assists in the 127-104 victory. After entering the contest ranked last in the NBA in 3-point shooting at 30.1 percent, Sacramento was 15-of-28 (53.6 percent) from beyond the arc against the Suns. ""Any night like this gives us a lot of confidence, especially when we didn't get off to a great start at all shooting the ball this year,"" Kings forward Keegan Murray said. ""To have things fall in place tonight after a rough game in San Antonio, it's a good feeling and hopefully we can carry that on to the next game."" Murray made three 3-pointers against Phoenix and also helped to hold Suns star Devin Booker to 18 points on 6-of-16 shooting. ""I've gotta give a shoutout to Keegan,"" Sacramento coach Mike Brown said. ""He was our defensive player of the game. We had a lot of very good defensive performances. You're not going to stop Book. You've just got to try to make him work. Keegan did his best to make him work and our team was there to support him."" The Kings are monitoring the status of guard DeMar DeRozan, who exited Wednesday's game at halftime due to lower back tightness and did not return. DeRozan reportedly did not practice Thursday and will be listed as doubtful. Sacramento is hoping to avenge a season-opening 117-115 loss to Minnesota on Oct. 24. Julius Randle scored 33 points to lead the Wolves, who won after Edwards made two free throws with 2.4 seconds remaining. The Wolves are 5-5 since that victory and still figuring out how to best integrate Randle and Donte DiVincenzo, who were acquired from the New York Knicks before the season for Karl-Anthony Towns. Minnesota center Rudy Gobert said he needs to set a stronger defensive tone following Wednesday's loss to Portland, but the team has a long list of other concerns. Instead of looking to the Wolves' coaches for solutions, Randle said the players need to figure out a way to emerge from the team's early-season fog. ""We talk about it and we drill it every single day,"" Randle said. ""It's on us as players. We've got to take responsibility, look ourselves in the mirror. We've got to fix this. When we decide we're gonna do that on a consistent basis, we'll win games."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

Long lines are expected at the team store at the Delta Center for the first jersey drop for a franchise that moved in from Phoenix on April 18. Only a handful of player jerseys, including Clayton Keller, Logan Cooley and Nick Schmaltz, will be available, but fans will be able to customize blank jerseys of the club playing its inaugural season. Don't be surprised to see a few No. 70's for Utah backup goalie Karel Vejmelka dot the stands for Friday's game. Vejmelka, making just his fourth start of the season, finished with a career-high 49 saves to help lead Utah to a 4-1 victory over visiting Carolina on Wednesday. He was serenaded with chants of ""Veggie, Veggie, Veggie"" as he circled the ice after earning No. 1 star of the game honors. ""It's unreal,"" the normally reserved Vejmelka said after wildly fist-pumping the crowd. ""This is a moment I'll remember for sure. This is a night to remember for me and for everybody. This is a huge game for us."" ""Unbelievable,"" forward Nick Bjugstad, who scored his first two goals of the season Wednesday, said of Vejmelka's performance. ""We're thankful for him. He had an amazing night."" Utah had to kill off 11 minutes of Hurricanes' power plays in the third period, including a 5-on-3 portion, as Carolina pumped 18 shots on goal. Utah also blocked 26 shots in the contest, including six each by defensemen Ian Cole and Mikhail Sergachev. ""Hopefully we don't get used to defending too much on the (penalty kill),"" Utah coach Andre Tourigny said. ""Veggie was good, the guys were blocking shots, we defended the slot pretty good in our own zone."" Vegas comes to Salt Lake City leading the Pacific Division with 22 points following a 3-2 win at Anaheim on Wednesday. Pavel Dorofeyev scored his team-high ninth goal early in the third period for what proved to be the game-winner. Adin Hill, pulled in his previous start against Carolina after allowing four goals on 21 shots, bounced back to turn away 22 of 24 shots from the Ducks. It was just the second road win in seven games (2-3-2) for the Golden Knights, who improved to 25-7-1 all-time against Anaheim, including 11-4-1 at the Honda Center. The contest was the start of a November stretch that will see Vegas play seven of eight games on the road. It also kicked off a two-game, four-day Fathers Trip for the Golden Knights. Vegas improved to 10-0-1 in such games. ""It's always fun,"" Hill said. ""The records kind of speak for themselves during Fathers Trips. It's always nice when we can find a way to get the two points."" Players were met with a long line of fathers in jerseys giving them high-fives as they left the ice after the contest en route to the locker room. The players' fathers went whale watching at Newport Beach before Wednesday's game and were going to spend Thursday on a team outing at the ski resort of Park City, Utah. ""(The dads are) happy,"" Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""Their team won, and they're part of it. ... This is the bonding side that father and son go through. That's what they're earned, and I'm happy for them."" This will be the second of three meetings this month between the Golden Knights and Utah. Vegas won the first one on Nov. 2 in Las Vegas, 4-3, on Brett Howden's overtime goal. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

Ovechkin is 31 behind The Great One and he is still scoring at an impressive clip at age 39. He will try to move closer to Gretzky when his Washington Capitals play the Colorado Avalanche on Friday night in Denver. Ovechkin has 10 goals in 15 games thus far and could realistically catch Gretzky this season if he gets on a roll offensively. The fact that he is doing it 10 months before he turns 40 has impressed his teammates and coaches. ""I would not think he's 39,"" Washington coach Spencer Carbery said. ""You can't even wrap your head around the age and being able to play in the best league in the world and the pace of play nowadays."" Ovechkin has eight goals in the last eight games and twice has scored two goals. ""I know I can't imagine doing it at 39,"" teammate Tom Wilson said. ""I don't think there'll ever be anybody like him again."" Friday kicks off a three-game road trip for the Capitals and is the first of two meetings against Colorado within a week. The Avalanche are in Washington on Nov. 21. The Capitals are coming off a disappointing 4-3 overtime home loss to Toronto on Wednesday night. Washington had a two-goal lead entering the third period but the Maple Leafs sent it to overtime and won it with 47 seconds left. ""The way that that game played out, just embarrassing,"" Carbery said. ""Flat out. That's unrecognizable from our team. Playing a team on the second of (a) back-to-back."" Colorado is coming off a 4-2 win against the Los Angeles Kings on Wednesday night and has a chance to sweep its four-game homestand. The Avalanche lost five of their first seven at home but have won the last four in Denver, and four of five overall, behind solid goaltending and big games from their stars. Mikko Rantanen had a natural hat trick and Nathan MacKinnon had three assists against the Kings, and now help is on the way. Forwards Valeri Nichushkin, Jonathan Drouin and Miles Wood are expected to play Friday, which will strengthen the top lines. Nichushkin has been suspended since the second round of the 2024 playoffs under the NHL/NHLPA player assistance program, and Drouin has not played since suffering an upper-body injury in the first game of the season. Drouin and Wood, who has not played since Oct. 28 due to an upper-body injury, were activated from the injured list on Thursday. The three will rejoin a team that has played well lately. ""We're all excited to add guys back in the line, especially the caliber players that are coming back in, but I'm more excited like the way our team's been playing over the last half a dozen games,"" Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said. ""We add more guys into it. As long as we don't change anything when it comes to the points that we've been hammering home and continue to play the way we've been playing."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

Booker comes into the game shooting just 43.4 percent overall and 34 percent from 3-point range, and he has hit 40.3 percent of his shots overall and 25.9 percent from deep over his last seven outings. The four-time All-Star had shot 49.3 percent from the floor and 35.8 percent on 3-pointers over his previous two seasons. With the Suns playing without Kevin Durant, who suffered a left calf strain last Friday against Dallas, Booker has received more attention from opposing defenses. In Wednesday's 127-104 loss at Sacramento, Booker was just 6-of-16 from the floor to finish with 18 points along with five assists. Booker said after that game that he needed to trust in his teammates more to make plays around him and not try to force the action himself. The Suns have dropped two of their last three games -- both losses came to Sacramento -- since starting 8-1, and Durant isn't the team's only significant injured player. Bradley Beal missed Wednesday's game with left calf tightness, while Grayson Allen was out with right hamstring soreness. There's a chance Allen could play at Oklahoma City, but Beal is out. Still, the Suns know they need to be better regardless of who's available. ""We're not making excuses or looking for anyone to feel bad for us or anything like that,"" guard Tyus Jones said. Phoenix will try to heat up against an Oklahoma City defense that is holding opponents to just 42.3 percent shooting -- the lowest mark in the NBA -- while forcing a league-high 19.5 turnovers per game. The Thunder have had to adjust their strategy with the loss of 7-footer Chet Holmgren for at least 10 weeks. Holmgren suffered a pelvic fracture in Sunday's loss to Golden State. Center Isaiah Hartenstein (left hand), forward Jaylin Williams (hamstring) and guard Alex Caruso (hip) are out as well. ""Obviously we're playing smaller right now, and we want to be a team that can offset out vulnerabilities with our strengths,"" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. ""I think sometimes you get tempted, from a coaching standpoint, to focus on all the things that are going wrong. But sometimes the solution is to do your best stuff better."" Oklahoma City has won back-to-back games since Holmgren's injury, primarily using the 6-foot-5 Jalen Williams at center. Williams has turned in his two best scoring games of the season, averaging 29.5 points while shooting 61.8 percent from the floor. Friday's game is the fifth in a season-long six-game homestand for the Thunder -- Oklahoma City is 3-1 so far during the stretch. Phoenix continues a four-game road trip (1-1). The contest is part of the NBA Cup. The Suns won their first game in group play, while Friday's game is the first of the tournament for the Thunder. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

Now, they are also well rested.,The Nuggets have had four days off since they won their fifth straight game -- a 122-1","The Denver Nuggets are rolling. Now, they are also well rested. The Nuggets have had four days off since they won their fifth straight game -- a 122-120 home victory against Dallas last Sunday. They begin a three-game road trip when they visit the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday. Coach Michael Malone used just eight players against the Mavericks, knowing that the ensuing days off provided ""a chance to give our guys a break mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually, whatever you need"" and then ""try to continue to play at this same level that we're playing at."" Denver swept its five-game homestand over the course of nine days. Three of the victories came by two points. ""It seems like every game goes down to the wire,"" Malone said. The winning points against Dallas came on Michael Porter Jr.'s mid-range jumper with 6.5 seconds remaining. Nikola Jokic had his fourth straight triple-double (37 points, 18 rebounds, 15 assists) and added three steals. He made 13 of 21 field-goal attempts, all three of his 3-point attempts and all eight of his free throws. ""I know we're all running out of adjectives and ways to describe his greatness and his impact,"" Malone said of Jokic. ""I think the simple way is to say that he's the best player in the world. That's the best way to say it, in my opinion."" The three-time NBA MVP is averaging 29.7 points, 13.7 rebounds and 11.7 assists, but it's possible he's not available on Friday. The Nuggets listed Jokic as questionable due to personal reasons on Thursday. Denver hasn't missed a beat in the absence of starting forward Aaron Gordon, who has missed the three games due to a calf strain that will sideline him for multiple weeks. Peyton Watson has replaced him in the lineup and even though Malone said Watson's primary role is as a defender, he has scored in double figures in all three starts and made all four of his 3-pointers against Dallas. The short-handed Pelicans have several players taking on larger roles just as Watson has for the Nuggets. They have lost six straight and nine of 10 after a 106-88 loss at Oklahoma City on Wednesday night. In addition to the absence of leading scorer Zion Williamson (hamstring), New Orleans played without its top three ball-handling guards -- Dejounte Murray (fractured hand), CJ McCollum (adductor) and Jose Alvarado (hamstring). It showed as the Pelicans committed 24 turnovers, leading to a 29-4 advantage for the Thunder in points off turnovers. ""The turnovers killed us,"" coach Willie Green said. ""Some of the turnovers were just mistakes on our part."" Green admitted that other turnovers were a result of Oklahoma City's defense, which leads the NBA with an average of 19.5 forced turnovers. Brandon Boston Jr., a shooting guard playing on a two-way contract, has been forced to take on more ball-handling and had six turnovers against the Thunder. Brandon Ingram committed eight as he continues to see added attention from defenses. ""He's been fantastic as we go through this as a team,"" Green said of Ingram. ""He understands what we're facing night in and night out. He'll see double teams, triple teams at times. We all understand the scenario he's in and we've just got to continue to push through it."" Friday's game is the NBA Cup opener for both Denver and New Orleans. The teams are in West Group C. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

That the Houston Rockets have two such p,"It is rare when a team can feature two defensive-minded wings capable of dismantling an opponent's game plan. That the Houston Rockets have two such players coming off their bench makes for an even more unique set of circumstances. Tari Eason and Amen Thompson provided strong two-way play in the Rockets' 111-103 victory over the visiting Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday. The duo will aim to continue their strong play on Friday when the teams reconvene in Houston to open their respective NBA Cup slates. Eason and Thompson scored 18 points apiece on combined 14-for-23 shooting and teamed up for 21 rebounds, with Thompson grabbing six offensive boards while logging a season-high 34 minutes. Eason posted his first double-double this season and his fifth consecutive double-digit scoring game -- he's averaging 14 points and seven boards during that span. Eason and Thompson also totaled three blocks and three steals on Wednesday. While the duo continues to develop as scorers and rebounders, their effectiveness as isolation and help defenders resonates. Both relish the opportunity to defend one-on-one and both excel off the ball, helping fuel the Rockets' urge to score more often in transition. Eason and Thompson's defensive versatility has allowed the Rockets to utilize unconventional lineups with the knowledge that the two can handle assignments from point guards to power forwards. ""They're very disruptive,"" Rockets coach Ime Udoka said. ""They just impact a game. It's a tandem that makes it stick out even more because they're so disruptive all over the court. ""It's obviously more magnified when two guys are ... flying all over the place and making that impact."" The Clippers' inability to maintain their hot shooting from behind the arc played a role in their defeat on Wednesday. After converting their first five 3-point attempts en route to an 11-point, first-quarter lead, the Clippers shot just 5-of-19 from deep in the second half. There was bound to be some regression following that scorching start, but the Clippers rank third in the NBA in 3-point shooting (39.1 percent), so the Rockets are due some credit. The Rockets recorded 11 blocked shots, with more than half of that total coming from their center rotation of Alperen Sengun (four) and Jock Landale (two). Repeatedly challenged at the rim, the Clippers' shot selection suffered, and, playing at a size deficit whenever 7-footer Ivica Zubac rested, the Clippers were dominated on the glass to the tune of a minus-17 rebounding margin. The Rockets parlayed 18 offensive rebounds into 19 second-chance points and totaled 24 fastbreak points. That combination of factors stood out in the first of the back-to-back matchups. ""I think some of our shot selection when we got into the paint, they were big at the rim,"" Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. ""We kind of threw some shots up, missing layups and when we missed they were out in transition and we couldn't get back to get matched up. We did a good job with our turnovers (the Clippers had 12), but then they ended up having 18 offensive rebounds. ""Like I said, they had a good game plan, they played well. We'll be better come (Friday). Our guys just got to see the blueprint, how they try to play us, and what they were trying to do and just go from there."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

Sinner, the World No. 1 from Italy, breezed past Russian No. 4 seed Daniil Medvedev 6-3, 6-4 to finish 3-0 in the Ilie Nastase Group. Fritz, the fifth-seeded American star, rallied for a 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Australian seventh seed Alex de Minaur to go 2-1, besting Medvedev's 1-2 record. Sinner and Fritz will compete in the semifinals Saturday, with their opponents to be determined Friday when the John Newcombe Group concludes play. Fritz will face the winner of that group and Sinner will face the second-place player. Germany's Alexander Zverev currently leads the John Newcombe Group, with Carlos Alcaraz of Spain, Casper Ruud of Norway and Andrey Rublev of Russia also in contention. Fritz played the first match Thursday and did not know he would advance until Sinner defeated Medvedev. Had that result gone the other way, there would be a three-way tie at 2-1. Fritz won 52 of his 62 first-service points (83.9 percent) and saved 4 of 6 break points while breaking de Minaur three times. Fritz trailed 27-26 in total winners but committed fewer unforced errors along the way (33 to de Minaur's 35). ""It's tough, because even though I won the match, I feel like there wasn't necessarily any moment when I feel like I had a repeatable way to win from the baseline, to be honest,"" Fritz said. ""He was all over me. What I did a great job of was towards the end of the second set, I really started to find my serve. I was serving much better and that allowed me to just stay with it and create more pressure on his service games."" Fritz was asked how he was feeling physically after three matches against tough opponents. ""I think a lot of us are pretty beat up,"" he said. ""But if I'm in the semis ... I've got energy to give."" Indeed, Fritz was headed to the semis once Sinner took care of Medvedev in a mere 73 minutes. Sinner benefitted from Medvedev making twice as many unforced errors as him (28-14) despite a 17-12 edge in winners. ""Me and Daniil, we know each other very well,"" Sinner said. ""So, every time we step on court, we try to change something tactically. I felt like I was ready to see what he was going to do (Thursday)."" Sinner took an 8-7 edge in his career head-to-head series with Medvedev. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-15

Anthony Davis added 21 points and 14 rebounds, Rui Hachimura and rookie Dalton Knecht scored 19 points apiece and Austin Reaves chipped in 18 points for the Lakers.

Wembanyama became the only Spurs player ever to make at least six shots from beyond the arc in three consecutive contests. ""Big shout out to (Wembanyama) -- he's working on his game,"" said forward Julian Champagnie, who finished with 12 points. ""He takes everything personal.

What about Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano's rematch? Uncrowned offers its takes.,"DALLAS — It's actually happening. Mike Tyson will compete in a professional boxing match for the first time since 2005 when he steps into the ring Friday, and welcoming him back will be 27-year-old YouTube sensation-turned-pugilist Jake Paul. Putting anyone's personal feelings aside, this is undeniably a spectacle. Paul vs. Tyson kicks off a potentially new era of Netflix live combat sports. To set the scene, the action goes down inside AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, where the NFL's Dallas Cowboys play. The Paul saga is lasting longer than anyone expected when he entered boxing professionally in 2020. Regardless of the result, people's feelings toward him will not change, and he'll stick around for whatever can top a fight like this. On the other hand, Tyson is surely — and hopefully — getting in the ring for one last time at 58 years old. Our bizarro main event isn't the only compelling (for better or worse) match on Friday's lineup. In the co-main event, fans will be treated to a highly anticipated rematch between arguably the world's two best female boxers, Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano. Gold will be on the line in that bout along with Mario Barrios' defense against Abel Ramos in the preceding match. But who will get their hands raised? Betting odds courtesy of BetMGM. Embrace the chaos, folks. What more needs to be said? This matchup revolves exclusively around the unknown and one question that can't be answered until fight night: Do Tyson's skills supersede his age of 58? If the iconic puncher can get over the proverbial hump that is Father Time, Paul has no hope outside of a big shot. This is still ""Iron Mike"" we're talking about. Although Tyson (50-6, 44 KOs) hasn't fought in a pro bout since his 2005 loss to Kevin McBride, he did return for an equally bizarre 2020 exhibition against fellow legend Roy Jones Jr. While Tyson looked solid in that match and would have won had a winner been determinable, it was against a 51-year-old Jones. The same Jones lost a majority decision to former UFC lightweight champion Anthony Pettis in 2023. Paul's best asset in boxing is his power. He's worked on his fundamentals gradually over his 11 matches (10-1, 7 KOs). We won't kid ourselves and say his competition has proven he's a future world champion or anything. It has not, and the glaring evidence of that is his lone loss, a split decision to mediocre boxer Tommy Fury in February 2023. Speed and every other physical advantage goes to Paul by default of his youth. The eight two-minute rounds and 14-ounce gloves might do Tyson somewhat of a favor. He has to last long enough for that to matter, though. The stage is set for a big knockout on either end. Flip a coin between incredible happiness and sadness. Power is the last thing to go and it will have to be Tyson's saving grace as we've seen Paul hurt by lesser knockout artists, albeit minimally. Unfortunately for the integrity of the sport and its legends, we'll have to take the realistic outcome. And that's a Paul knockout. Pick: Paul This is the real main event, ladies and gentlemen. Katie Taylor vs. Amanda Serrano II is a rematch of one of the best boxing matches in recent memory. Some even say ever, especially among women's boxing matches. If you haven't seen it, get hyped and watch it on YouTube because it's a great time. The first fight had a somewhat controversial result — nothing new for boxing at the highest level. Taylor won the fight via a split decision after coming on strong in the second half of the 10-round war. I scored the fight in favor of Serrano, with the first six rounds 10-9 for her, and the rest for Taylor via the same tally. Serrano started the action very aggressively and dictated the fight immediately. She successfully backed up Taylor for six rounds and had her on the ropes defending. The formula worked so well that she should have gotten the nod and nearly put away Taylor in an insane fifth round. That was a wrap if she poured it on heavier in those staggering moments. Taylor, 38, has gone 2-1 (23-1 overall) while the 36-year-old Serrano is 5-0 (47-2-1 overall) since their April 2022 clash. Taylor has shown more signs of slowing than Serrano, starting with their first fight, and there's no reason Serrano should stray from her original game plan. If anything, she won't lay off when there's blood in the water. She'll claim the WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO and The Ring lightweight titles, and don't be surprised if it comes by stoppage. Pick: Serrano Mario Barrios, 29, has gotten back on track with three straight wins after his first career losses (29-2, 18 KOs) to Gervonta ""Tank"" Davis and Keith Thurman. There's no shame in losing to either boxer, and Barrios has remained a fixture and top competitor. He's still working to take things to the upper echelon and gets a nice spotlight to show off against Abel Ramos. A win for the 33-year-old Ramos would be a big upset. Barrios will be the toughest challenge of his 36-match career (28-6-2, 22 KOs). If Ramos can make the match dirty and take shots to give some, his durability can shine as he's only been finished once with 22 under his belt. Unfortunately for Ramos, he and Barrios are going in different directions with their skill development. The champ is too slick and packs a punch of his own. ""And still"" for the WBC titleholder Barrios. Pick: Barrios Paul vs. Tyson can't be topped in the ""freak show"" category, but Friday's card also has this one to give it a good run for its money. Whindersson Nunes, 29, is a Brazilian YouTuber who followed the Paul blueprint and decided he wanted to box. His success rate has been mixed in his amateur matches thus far. Like Paul, Nunes went against MMA fighters and fellow YouTubers before he made his pro debut in September 2023, which he lost to Thai YouTuber ""My Mate Nate."" What am I even typing here? The 33-year-old Neeraj Goyat is an actual 18-4-2 pro boxer and 2-0 MMA fighter with several national and international accolades. This is a thing that is happening. Pick: Goyat Shadasia Green def.

""I remember Kobe liked to do some extra motivation stuff. We were playing against the Warriors and Steph was just killing us,"" Young recalled.

This time, the NBA is floating a shift to a four-team tournament for the 2025 All-Star Game, according to ESPN's Shams Charania. Three of those teams would reportedly consist of eight All-Stars each, while the remaining team would be the winner of the Rising Stars Game. Essentially, it sounds like the league either wants to adopt the format of the Rising Stars Challenge, which is currently a four-team tournament, or flip the formats with the All-Star Game. The NHL has also used this four-team tournament for its All-Star Game since 2016. The 2025 NBA All-Star Game is scheduled for Feb. 16 at the Golden State Warriors' Chase Center. Warriors star Stephen Curry is reportedly one of the All-Stars providing input on how to change the All-Star Game and is also in talks to bring back his NBA versus WNBA 3-point challenge alongside Sabrina Ionescu. ESPN reports there would be some variation of that event, which could include other NBA and WNBA players, with Klay Thompson and Caitlin Clark specifically mentioned. You can bet the NBA would be happy to feature the WNBA's league-altering superstar. You don't need an explanation for why the NBA would do this if you have watched a recent All-Star Game. It should be a marquee event for the star-studded league, but is instead a high-scoring slog in which players openly allow each other to score for the benefit of their highlight reel. Last year's game had a final score of 211-186. There have been calls to make the games more competitive (read: have the players actually play defense) and this format might help in that regard for one reason: the Rising Stars team. Teams featuring LeBron James and Kevin Durant might let each other do what they want, but it might be different if one of those teams is facing a team of rookies and sophomores. It comes down to pride for these guys, and the idea of losing to a 20-year-old might actually move them. Until 2018, the NBA All-Star Game featured an East vs. West format in which the players played a typical game of basketball. Here are all the ways the NBA has changed how that works: 2018: The NBA switches from East vs. West to a playground-style team-captain selection process. 2019: The NBA actually starts televising the selection process. 2020: The NBA institutes the Elam ending, in which the fourth quarter is untimed and the teams play first to a certain number of points. 2023: The NBA has its team captains make their picks immediately before the game rather than days in advance. 2024: The NBA goes back to East vs. West and eliminates the Elam ending. The league has seen its ratings dwindle over that span, though the reason it made the changes is the ratings weren't good to begin with. The 2018 All-Star game saw 7.7 million viewers, while last year's event received 5.5 million. That was a bounce back from the all-time low of 4.6 million in 2023.",2024-11-15

How can they take a step toward doing so?,"The premier quarterback rivalry of the new age will write another chapter this weekend as the Chiefs look to continue their undefeated season on the road with a trip to Buffalo. Including the playoffs, this will be the eighth matchup between Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen since the start of the 2020 season. There has been a clear trend between these teams when they play. The Bills own the Chiefs in the regular season with a 3-1 record in Allen vs. Mahomes matchups — however, the Chiefs are 3-0 against the Bills in the postseason. The frequency of games between these two teams, paired with having two Hall of Fame quarterbacks in their prime, has built a legitimate rivalry. Stakes are always high when the Chiefs play the Bills and that remains true for the upcoming game on Sunday. Kansas City has nickel-and-dimed its way to a 9-0 record while the Bills have a commanding lead on the AFC East with an 8-2 mark. If the Bills pull this one off, they’ll have a path toward being the No. 1 seed in the AFC and skipping the first round of the playoffs. These are two of the entrenched titans in the NFL, and this game will be a good benchmark for learning what each of them is capable of in the postseason. Both of these offenses are among the best in the league and they’ll both be playing against good, if a bit incomplete, defenses. The Chiefs have drawn concern and criticism for their lack of explosive offensive plays, but on a down-to-down basis, this is still one of the best offenses in the league. According to TruMedia, the Chiefs rank fifth in success rate and second in success rate on dropbacks. Their 2.39 points per drive is good for eighth in the league and they’re converting more than 50% of their third-down attempts. They’ve shifted gears and are now a more dink-and-dunk offense, but they’re still good. The Bills aren’t exactly airing it out either this year, but they’ve been able to push the ball downfield more than the Chiefs have. In a world where Lamar Jackson wasn’t having one of the greatest seasons ever, Josh Allen would be the MVP favorite. He’s once again been incredible while carrying an Atlas-level workload for the offense with a host of young wide receivers. Both offenses are more consistently efficient than the defenses they’ll be facing, which could lead to fireworks. How each defense performs against the elite quarterback on the other side of the field will be a crucial data point. The Bills' two losses this season have come at the hands of Lamar Jackson and C.J. Stroud. Kansas City is undefeated, but good offenses like the Falcons and Buccaneers moved the ball on them. Allen said this week that he’s more concerned about getting over the Chiefs hurdle in the playoffs than the regular season, which makes sense given three of his five playoff exits have come at the hands of Mahomes and Kansas City. This team is capable of getting over that mountain, but they still have to do it when it comes down to crunch time. Sunday is the most important litmus test of the season for the Bills against their biggest rival, and it will allow them to know where they stand in their quest to finally reach the Super Bowl in the Josh Allen era. Game, set, match. This is what we watch this league for.",2024-11-15

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Behind the Warriors' sudden rebirth — and why they look like legit title contenders again,https://sports.yahoo.com/behind-the-warriors-sudden-rebirth--and-why-they-look-like-legit-title-contenders-again-190114450.html,"Fri, 15 Nov 2024 19:01:14 GMT",Golden State's start to the season has served as an emphatic reminder of just how dangerous a fully operational version of the Warriors can really be.,"As much as the dynastic era of Golden State Warriors basketball was built on Stephen Curry fundamentally reshaping the geometry of the sport, it also depended upon defenses that consistently cut off opposing offenses’ oxygen. The shift started under Mark Jackson, who shepherded a 51-win breakthrough for the long-moribund franchise in 2013-14 behind the scintillating shooting of Curry and Klay Thompson … and a defense that ranked third in the NBA in points allowed per possession outside of garbage time. From there, Steve Kerr and chief lieutenant Ron Adams iterated on the formula to historic success. Golden State finished first in defensive efficiency in 2014-15, en route to the first NBA championship of the Steph era; fourth in the 2015-16 season, which saw the Dubs win an NBA-record 73 games as arguably the greatest regular-season team of all time; back up to first in 2016-17, their first year with Kevin Durant, when they became arguably the greatest team of all time, period. Even in the final two Durant seasons, in which the Warriors at times engaged Chill Mode by relying on their overwhelming offense to breeze past most competition, Golden State still boasted top-10 units. And when Curry, Kerr, Thompson and Draymond Green returned to the top of the mountain in 2021-22, two injury-plagued and “two timelines”-inflected years later … they did it on the back of the NBA’s No. 2 defense. After finishing 15th in defensive efficiency and 10th in the West last season, punctuated by a play-in round exit at the hands of the longtime-little-brother Kings, the Warriors looked poised to plummet: Thompson on his way out, no big fish replacing him, a slew of unproven youngsters and journeymen surrounding Curry and Green, their beards now flecked with gray. But where others saw them rushing toward the bottom, the Warriors saw an opportunity to get back to basics. “It’s still about winning and taking the steps necessary to give ourselves a chance,” Curry told Marcus Thompson II of The Athletic this summer after signing a one-year, $62.6 million contract extension. “The standard hasn’t changed. The expectation hasn’t changed.” After taking down old pal Klay and the Mavericks at Chase Center on Tuesday, the Warriors sit at 9-2. And while there’s been plenty to love about Golden State’s offense in the early going, from the lowest turnover rate of the Kerr era and a dramatic uptick in shot attempts at the rim to Green taking 3s at his highest rate in a decade (and making 45.7% of them, his highest rate ever) and Steph being, y’know, Steph … … the biggest reason the Warriors are vying for the top spot in the West is a defense that has been one of the NBA’s crispest, most disruptive and flat-out nastiest in the season’s opening weeks. The Warriors enter Friday’s Emirates NBA Cup matchup against the Grizzlies fourth in the NBA in points allowed per possession outside of garbage time, according to Cleaning the Glass. New defensive coordinator Jerry Stackhouse has the Dubs flying around and wreaking havoc, discombobulating offenses in just about every way possible: Golden State ranks third in the NBA in steals, seventh in blocks, second in deflections and first in charges drawn, with Green leading the league and second-year nuisance Brandin Podziemski tied for second. All told, the Warriors have forced turnovers on 16% of opponents’ offensive possessions — the eighth-highest share in the NBA and the highest of any Golden State squad since that first ’14-15 title team. Thompson’s exit, paired with the inability to land potential game-changers Paul George or Lauri Markkanen during the offseason, left a bitter taste in the mouths of many Warriors fans. Credit to general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr., then, for turning lemons into lemonade, filling the rotation spots of the outgoing Thompson, Chris Paul and Dario Šarić with Buddy Hield, Kyle Anderson, De’Anthony Melton and Lindy Waters III. Slot in those newcomers alongside rising youngsters Podziemski, Jonathan Kuminga, Trayce Jackson-Davis and Moses Moody, and pair them with returns to health from Gary Payton II and Kevon Looney, and suddenly Kerr’s cup runneth over. “Last year, Steph and Steve were talking about the lineups and just kind of running out of options on lineups that we can go to,” Green told reporters after Sunday’s win over Oklahoma City. “This year, it’s the total opposite.” Kerr has already taken advantage of that surfeit of options. He’s gone at least 10 deep in every game thus far, trotting out seven starting lineups in 11 games, with no five-man unit logging more than 34 minutes. Golden State’s reserves have seized their opportunities and earned more; the Warriors are averaging a league-leading 58 points per game off the bench, which would be the highest figure of any team in the 28 seasons for which NBA.com publishes play-by-play data. One benefit to that newfound depth? It’s allowing Kerr to curb Curry’s workload. Steph still leads the team in minutes per game, but he’s averaging just 29.1, which would be a career-low — and, presumably, a pretty good pitch count for someone who’ll turn 37 in March and whom Golden State hopes to be leaning on come April, May and June. Another? It lets Kerr act like he’s still coaching Team USA. After last week’s early-season-statement win in Boston, Payton compared the Warriors’ expanded rotation to a hockey team running full line changes every few minutes; this, he said, gives them ""a lot of fresh legs.” That shows up in a consistently cranked-up defensive effort, picture-perfect rotations and the kind of expertly executed help that closes openings before an offense can exploit them. Watch the Warriors play defense, and you’ll find yourself struck by the degree to which they often seem to be everywhere. They chase ball-handlers over the top of screens. They bump cutters. They haul ass back on the fast break, giving up a microscopic and league-best 0.87 points per play in transition, according to Synergy Sports. (The next-stingiest team in transition, the Orlando Magic, gives up 1.02; the size of the gap between Golden State and second place is the same as the gap between second and 25th.) They apply a level of ball pressure that, frankly, seems like it’d be very annoying to deal with over the course of 100 or so possessions, because they’ve got the quick hands, feet and thinking to extend their defense, rotate behind it and get away with it. The Warriors have trapped pick-and-roll ball-handlers 47 times in 11 games, according to Synergy, compared to 83 in 82 games last season; after dropping back in zone defense an average of 3.2 possessions per game last season, they’ve done it zero times this season. Beat one Warrior off the dribble, and there’s another, maybe two, racing over to not only impede your progress, but rudely separate you from the ball. Work to pry open what you think is an open look, and watch as they slam that window shut; they rank fourth in the NBA in contested shots per game, third in field-goal attempts on which they have a defender within 2 feet of the shooter and have blocked a league-high 10 3-point attempts. They concede nothing. Some of that is a function of Golden State’s overwhelming length. There’s no Victor Wembanyama, Chet Holmgren or Kristaps Porziņģis here, but in Green, Jackson-Davis, Looney, Anderson, Kuminga, Moody and Andrew Wiggins, Kerr has seven rotation players between 6-foot-6 and 6-foot-9 with 7-foot-plus wingspans. (Wiggins has gotten off to a very strong start. He ranks in the 99th percentile in the NBA in perimeter isolation defense, according to The BBall Index, despite taking on an All-NBA team of individual matchups. He’s also posting career-highs in offensive rebounding percentage and contested defensive rebounding percentage — critical for a Warriors team without a ton of height on the interior.) Guards Payton and Melton both stand 6-foot-2, but have 6-foot-8 wingspans and the lateral quickness to be point-of-attack menaces. (Melton, who was limited to 38 games last season by back issues, will be on the shelf for a while after spraining his left ACL.) Hield, at 6-foot-4, has a 6-foot-9 wingspan, as well as a relentless drive to pursue the ball that Kerr, Stackhouse and Co. have weaponized. Some of it, though, is a function of attitude — which, as Julius Campbell taught us, reflects leadership. And when you’re talking about the Warriors’ defense, that leadership comes from Green … who has been an absolute monster out of the gate: Opponents are shooting just 40% when Green is the closest defender, according to NBA Advanced Stats. Out of 166 players to guard at least 100 field-goal attempts, that’s the ninth-lowest mark; it’s also on pace to be the lowest defensive field-goal percentage he’s allowed since 2015-16, the year he made his first All-Star and All-NBA teams and finished seventh in MVP voting. While the league’s preeminent giants lock down the paint primarily through the threat of their shot-blocking, Green controls the half-court by extinguishing sparks before they can catch fire. Nobody’s better at mucking up possessions with positioning, stunts, shifts and communication; opponents are taking just under 28.7% of their shots at the rim against the Warriors with Green on the court, which would be the second-lowest rate in the NBA. When they do venture inside, he might not get the block, but he still manages to make them regret it. They’re shooting only 62.1% on point-blank looks when he’s on the floor, a top-six clip. “He’s been unreal,” Curry said of Green after Tuesday’s win over the Mavericks. “Truly motivated. He’s moving well. He’s locked in mentally. ... He’s been all-world defensively.” Honestly? He was last season, too: The Warriors defended at a top-three level and had the point differential of a 56-win team when Green was on the floor in 2023-24. The issue, though, was all the time he wasn’t on the floor; he cost himself more than 20 games through suspensions and ejections, and the Warriors sputtered to an early exit partly because it never fully recovered from him putting them behind the 8-ball. Green has come into the season intent on re-establishing himself as not only a bellwether, but the belle of the ball when it comes to defensive game-changers in the NBA — one who, at just 6-foot-6, remains a giant in his own right, capable of casting a towering shadow over opposing offenses. “I spent all summer watching everyone talk about Chet and Wemby, and what they’re doing defensively,” Green said after holding Zion Williamson to 3-for-12 shooting in a Warriors win. “Don’t forget about Dray.” This start to the season has served as an emphatic reminder — not only of the difference Green makes, but of just how dangerous a fully operational version of the Warriors can really be. Basketball-Reference.com publishes a metric called Simple Rating System (SRS), which takes into account a team’s average point differential and the strength of schedule it has faced. Through 11 games, the Warriors’ SRS is 11.04 — second-highest in the NBA, behind only a 10-2 Thunder team that got off to a historically elite defensive start. Heading into this season, only 11 teams have ever had an SRS above 10.0. Eight of them wound up winning the NBA championship: the 1971 Bucks, ’72 Lakers, ’92, ’96 and ’97 Bulls, 2015 and '17 Warriors, and last year’s Celtics. (A ninth, the 2016 Warriors, lost in the Finals.) Whether this early-season success will sustain remains to be seen. We’re an awful long way from the postseason proving ground; it’s possible that, by springtime, the Warriors look more like just another member of the West’s middle class. This start has shown, though, that it’s also possible they’re not. That, a decade after their first Larry O’Brien Trophy, Golden State’s formula — Steph throwing lightning bolts, Draymond breathing fire, everybody else passing and moving in concert and a defense that chokes offenses out — still works. If it ain’t broke … well, don’t stop using it to break people.",2024-11-15

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Willy Adames is MLB's top free-agent shortstop. Could his high value land him a $200M deal?,https://sports.yahoo.com/willy-adames-is-mlbs-top-free-agent-shortstop-could-his-high-value-land-him-a-200m-deal-181734117.html,"Fri, 15 Nov 2024 18:17:34 GMT","The Dodgers have been interested in Adames and even with Mookie Betts moving back to the infield, Adames would make sense in L.A. Other teams that could make a run at him include the Giants and Braves.","If you put a list together of the top shortstops in baseball, after Francisco Lindor, Corey Seager, Bobby Witt Jr. and Trea Turner, you can make a strong case that Willy Adames is the fifth-best shortstop in the game. And it’s not wild to think he might be the second-best free agent on the position player side available this winter behind Juan Soto. Adames put together his best campaign for the Milwaukee Brewers in 2024. Adames had a .251/.331/.462 slashline with a career high in doubles (33), hits (153), home runs (32), runs (92), runs batted in (112), walks (74) and stolen bases (21). After the Tampa Bay Rays traded him to the Brewers in 2021, Adames turned himself into a true middle-of-the-order bat and a dangerous presence for Milwaukee. It showed in the production. Adames is one of the best power threats at shortstop in the game right now. Since he came into the league in 2018, only Lindor (188 homers) has more homers than Adames' 150 in that span among shortstops. And he’s also proven the ability to be a premium run producer, ranking fourth at the position in RBI in the same span. While advanced defensive metrics suggest the seven-year veteran took a step back (-16 DRS), in the two previous seasons, Adames rated as one of the best defenders (combined 17 DRS in '22 and '23). So a return to that level in 2025 is possible. Adames’ range, arm and athleticism could make him a solid defender at second or third base. If there’s a hole in Adames’ game, it's that he doesn’t get on base at a high clip. Over his seven seasons, Adames has a .322 on-base percentage. But as he’s gotten older and tapped into more power, Adames has been more selective, setting career highs in walks each of the past two seasons with 71 in '23 and 74 in '24. Adames' best asset might be the ability to lead a clubhouse. You’ll never hear a bad word about Adames; whether it was Kevin Cash, Craig Counsell or Pat Murphy, managers love his leadership style and his ability to bring people together. Jackson Chourio is going to be a star in the big leagues for a long time. The man charged with helping one of the game’s top prospects was Adames. Chourio told Yahoo Sports last spring that he was sitting right next to Adames in the clubhouse to learn from him, and as Chourio had an outstanding rookie campaign, that wisdom appeared to have paid off. When it comes to what the market for Adames looks like, he has the benefit of being the only marquee shortstop available this winter — unlike three years ago when there was an influx of high-end shortstops in free agency with the likes of Trevor Story, Dansby Swanson, Javier Báez and Carlos Correa. Adames will have the top of the market to himself with the second-best option at the position being Ha-Seong Kim. For years, the Dodgers have been interested in Adames and even with Mookie Betts moving back to the infield, Adames would make plenty of sense in L.A. Other teams that could make a run at Adames include the Giants and Braves. If Adames changes positions that could open even more potential suitors. Adames’ deal will likely be in the ballpark of Swanson’s seven-year, $177 million deal he signed with the Chicago Cubs in 2022. The belief around baseball is that Adames’ popularity among teams could push that number toward $200 million. When you include the intangibles that make him a great fit off the field, Adames might end up being the best value in this year’s free-agent class.",2024-11-15
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Fantasy Football: Week 11 predictions to count on,https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy-football-week-11-predictions-to-count-on-165801897.html,"Fri, 15 Nov 2024 16:58:01 GMT",The Yahoo team delivers their most steadfast predictions for Week 11.,"The Yahoo team delivers their most steadfast predictions for Week 11. Just four weeks ago, during the first quarter of Wilson’s first start of the season, many of us were begging for Pittsburgh to pull the plug and reinsert Justin Fields at QB. As ever, the NFL remains the wildest and least predictable league. Russ is currently undefeated and coming off a signature win in which he tossed three TD passes. He’s now up to seven combined touchdowns in his three games, and he’s just hit the friendliest stretch of matchups on his schedule. The Steelers have a series of division games lined up, beginning this week against a Baltimore defense that ranks dead-last against the pass, allowing 294.6 yards per game. Wilson is about to give us yet another multi-touchdown performance, likely finishing inside his position’s top 10 (and possibly top five). It should be another nice week for George Pickens managers, too. — Andy Behrens Nix has been the QB7 in fantasy points per game since Week 4, averaging nearly as many fantasy points (20.4) as Josh Allen (20.7) over that six-game span. After attempting seven passes inside the 10-yard line over his first seven games, Nix has 11 over his last three. Nix ranks fourth among all quarterbacks in carries inside the five and expected fantasy points this season, behind only Jalen Hurts, Brock Purdy and Lamar Jackson. The Broncos get a Falcons defense allowing the 10th fewest fantasy points to running backs but the seventh most to quarterbacks. Denver has a big advantage up front (LT Garrett Bolles hasn’t given up a single pressure over the last four weeks) against an Atlanta front that just became the first defense in the Super Bowl era to fail to record 10 sacks over its first 10 games. Nix finishes as a top five QB this week. — Dalton Del Don In the two games prior to Cleveland’s bye week, Cedric Tillman was one of the most utilized players at his position across the league. Tillman garnered 19 targets, 268 air yards (fifth most among receivers) and a pair of end zone targets. You can’t ask for much more. Tillman is a big receiver who can win at X both with some separation, contested catch prowess and a subtle ability to earn yards after the catch. His tape has been as legit as the production. Coming off the bye, Tillman and the Browns will play a Saints defense that’s declined throughout the course of the season. In just the last month, they’ve allowed the seventh-most yards per target as a pass defense amid both coverage and tackling issues. This is not a stay-away matchup for any of these Browns passing game players, Tillman chief among them. — Matt Harmon I realize Khalil Shakir is a seam call for fantasy managers most weeks. This is a good spot to dial him up. He hit Kansas City for seven catches and a touchdown in the playoffs last year, and Josh Allen has specifically leaned into Shakir in recent weeks, with 28 connections for 280 yards over the past four games. Keon Coleman and Dalton Kincaid are both out, and we're not sure about Amari Cooper. Get Shakir into those lineups. — Scott Pianowski In his first game active since Brandon Aiyuk’s injury, Jennings stepped up to a massive role increase with 11 targets, catching seven for 93 yards. He’s transitioning into a new role, specifically taking on the workload of Aiyuk, and this new-look 49ers’ offense should continue for the remainder of the season. Jennings has an extremely high ceiling, the trust of both Kyle Shanahan and Brock Purdy and a dream matchup against the Seattle Seahawks this week. The Seahawks have been lit up through the air all season long by any and every receiving corps they’ve faced. Expect Jennings to capitalize on the matchup and be a strong WR2 with WR1 upside. — Tera Roberts McConkey is coming off his worst fantasy day in over a month. The Chargers' second-round rookie produced just 52 yards on two catches against the Titans in Week 10. This was a difficult matchup for McConkey, as the Titans entered the week allowing the fewest receiving yards per play. Despite this poor performance, McConkey still leads the Chargers with a 23% target share this season. He’s benefitted from the Chargers throwing more since their bye week. Justin Herbert is averaging 262 passing yards per game the past five weeks and leads the NFL averaging 9.3 yards per attempt during this time. Herbert and McConkey get a nice matchup this week against the Bengals. Cincinnati gives up the seventh most EPA per passing play this season. Expect McConkey to bounce back this week and produce his fourth top-20 finish of the year. — Sal Vetri",2024-11-15

Second seed Zverev secured top spot in the group with a 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 win and will face American Taylor Fritz in the semi-finals. Wimbledon and French Open champion Alcaraz, who only won one of his three group matches, was forced to await the result of the evening match between Andrey Rublev and Casper Ruud for his elimination to be confirmed. He would be out if Ruud took a single set against the winless Russian - and the Norwegian secured his last-four spot by taking the first en route to a 6-4 5-7 6-2 victory. Ruud, seeded sixth in Turin, will face home favourite and top seed Jannik Sinner in the knockout stage. But Zverev looks the man to beat in Italy - he has won all three group matches in straight sets without having his serve broken. Live scores, results and order of play Get tennis news sent straight to your phone The 27-year-old played it down though when asked whether he is currently playing the best tennis of his life. ""You guys have got to relax a little bit,"" he said after beating 21-year-old Alcaraz. “Three fantastic matches, now the semi-finals will be very difficult. Taylor [Fritz] has beaten me a few times at the slams. ""Alcaraz has beaten me too many times this year so I'm glad to get this one. We have a great rivalry and friendship, I'm always glad to play him – unless he wins."" Zverev continued his impressive form against Alcaraz, who has struggled with a chest complaint during this tournament and once again wore a pink nasal strip to aid his breathing. ""It has been a difficult week for me struggling with some physical problems,"" said Alcaraz, who added that he hopes to return for the Davis Cup finals in Malaga next week - which will also be team-mate Rafael Nadal's final professional tournament. ""Today I faced one of the best players in the world, without a doubt, playing really solid and great tennis."" Seemingly still feeling the effects of that illness, Alcaraz was again off form but showed some fighting spirit to save seven break points in the first set, then two set points – before Zverev superbly converted the third. Zverev had four of those break points saved in the fourth game of the match, then had set point on Alcaraz's serve when leading 6-5, but hit a cross-court forehand long following an extensive rally. The Spaniard forced the tie-break but Zverev was once again able to get his nose in front. After both produced superb shots during the tie-break – including a terrific cross-court lob from Alcaraz – Zverev managed the best to finally secure the set. His third set point saw the German dig out an attempted Alcaraz winner with a brilliant half-volleyed pick-up near the net. Alcaraz spooned the returning volley wide and Zverev roared in celebration. Zverev only needed to win that first set to guarantee his spot in the last four but he was determined to secure the win to get the top spot in the John Newcombe Group. The break in the second set was easier to come by, as Alcaraz fired a straightforward volley into the net to give up the immediate advantage. The third seed psyched himself up enough to force two break points against Zverev at 3-2 – the first the German had faced in the entire tournament – but was unable to convert before Zverev saw out the match. Alcaraz's form has been a gift for Ruud, who comfortably beat the Spaniard in their opening group game. Ruud, however, was then beaten by Zverev, meaning he needed to secure at least one set against eighth seed Rublev in this final match to ensure his place in the last four. And he did so after a tight opening set, celebrating with a roar matched by his support team. Ruud followed this up by winning in three sets, condemning Rublev to three defeats from three for the second successive finals. He will start his semi-final as the underdog against Australian and US Open champion Sinner on Saturday night. ""I'll have to keep it going tomorrow - I'll need it,"" Ruud said. ""Sometimes you feel if you are an underdog you can play free, and know if you bring less than your A game you will lose. ""There's no doubt Sinner is the best player in the world. Playing at home, hasn't dropped a set - he is the player to beat. This guy almost forgot how to lose! I have to come up with something to challenge him tomorrow.""",2024-11-15

Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games","Binge, Stream, Skip: Week 11 Fantasy Football",https://sports.yahoo.com/binge-stream-skip-week-11-fantasy-football-162409525.html,"Fri, 15 Nov 2024 16:24:09 GMT",Fantasy football analyst Matt Harmon delivers his Week 11 viewing guide.,"Game environment is the foundational starting point in making fantasy football lineup decisions. As such, I’m going to break down each game on the slate into three categories: Binge, Stream and Skip. Games you want to “binge” are like the show you can’t miss; you’re watching as soon as it goes live and might just crush all the episodes in one weekend. These are the start-all-your-guys fantasy games and ones with season-defining storylines. Games you want to “stream” are like the shows you certainly watch start to finish, but perhaps you’re finishing it over time instead of one shot. While these games might not feature a ton of “must-starts,” we can pick and choose our spots, and the teams are likely to matter in the NFL playoff picture. Lastly, the games you want to “skip” are like the shows you’re leaning toward passing on, but you might catch an episode here and there (or might stick to reading recaps online to stay up with the culture). There will be a non-obvious player or two who stands out in these games, but overall, they aren’t the best environment for fantasy football. Let’s dive into my Week 11 Fantasy Football Viewer’s Guide. The Ravens and Steelers offenses have been some of the most enjoyable units to watch over the last month, for different reasons. The Ravens can sting you in so many ways, and they need it because their defense on the other side isn’t the same fearsome group we used to know. Pittsburgh’s offense is limited because Russell Wilson is a “touchdown to check-down” quarterback at this phase, but it works so well. Given Wilson’s still-live deep ball and the wide receivers at his disposal, the team can lean into this volatile identity. All that said, there’s a part of me that can’t shake the feeling that so many Ravens-Steelers games just get dragged into the mud. It won’t shock me if this game, which looks like a prime high-scoring matchup for fantasy managers, somehow turns into a 17-14 affair. The way to break that trend will be the deep shots on both sides of the ball. Those shots will be available when you look at the matchup on paper. For Baltimore, while Rashod Bateman has been a big-play option on the perimeter, Zay Flowers is the one who comes in with the better schematical matchup. Flowers leads the team in targets against single-high coverage and the Steelers deploy those looks at the highest rate in the league, per Fantasy Points Data. He’s hit downfield shots against single-high with 3.36 yards per route run. The Ravens are intentional about moving Flowers around and getting him slot reps to hunt big plays against this coverage. They need him to come through on Sunday. The Steelers will have the vertical shots set up to fly. Baltimore allows the most air yards in the league, as its secondary has been a liability against the deep ball. It’s not the type of defense we’re used to seeing from the Ravens but it’s the reality of where this unit in transition finds itself. Since Week 7, George Pickens has been fully unleashed. He leads the team with a 90.5% route participation and 26.3% target share. Any sort of frostiness and lack of playing time issues are merely water under the bridge here in the Russell Wilson era. Pickens averages 15.8 air yards per target during this stretch, and his skill set as the ball-winning X-receiver is a natural fit for what Wilson likes to do. The matchup could not be more golden for Pickens and Wilson to connect on more downfield, difference-making plays. The Bengals are the best bad team in the NFL. At no point will the record reflect it, but this isn’t an offense any team is excited about facing in a given week. Despite there being two cycles of “What’s up with Ja’Marr Chase?” talking points in fantasy circles, the Bengals wideout is the current NFL Triple Crown holder. He leads the league in catches, yards and touchdowns. Most of that is due to his two matchups with Baltimore. Los Angeles presents a much tougher challenge. The Chargers play a ton of cover-four on the backend and don’t dedicate extra bodies to the run game. That makes them a tough unit to dunk on with vertical receptions. If Chase has a big night, it’ll come with short catches where he makes his yards after catch magic. Cincinnati continues to find new personnel packages and ancillary players to contribute in the passing game. Since Zack Moss got hurt, Chase Brown has emerged as a critical factor in the aerial attack. Over the last two weeks, Brown has ranked No. 1 at the position of targets and has received 1st downs. His 0.7 aDOT is second most among backs with double-digit targets and is one of just eight with an end-zone target. With this type of usage, he’s a weekly top-15 option in fantasy, even under challenging matchups like this. On the other side, the Chargers offense is clicking. They have multiple valuable players in the passing game to go along with star rookie Ladd McConkey. They even started to experiment with Justin Herbert as a designed rusher. I think this was the plan to squeeze a bit of ground game juice out of Herbert’s athleticism but the coaching staff has pulled back on it after a preseason injury. If that’s sticky, it’s big for Herbert’s weekly ceiling. In the backfield, Gus Edwards' return did take some grinder carries away from J.K. Dobbins, but the latter was still on the field for 67% of the snaps. His overall expected fantasy points were in the same ballpark as Weeks 6 to 9, thanks to goal-line work. Given the matchup against Cincinnati, this is the week to try and get some of these Chargers players into your lineup. A fabled matchup between two AFC rivals will write another chapter this week. Ironically, the significant determining factor for which offense gets the upper hand will be the play of the top receiver on each side. These two teams spent time remaking their wide receiver rooms this offseason and into the regular season and the returns will be crucial in this game. The Chiefs' acquisition of DeAndre Hopkins was done for big games like this. Last week’s dud for Hopkins was predictable. Denver has a top perimeter corner in Patrick Surtain II who tracks outside receivers across the field. Even if the Chiefs get Hopkins some slot looks, he’s still a primary outside receiver, taking 63.7% of his snaps from the perimeter over the last two weeks. The Broncos play man coverage at the fifth-highest rate in the league, per Fantasy Points Data, and at this stage of his career, Hopkins struggles to get open against man more than zone. That was my finding while charting him for Reception Perception. Because of this split in his coverage performance, Hopkins smashed against the Buccaneers in Week 9. The Bucs are on the other end of the coverage spectrum, playing zone at the highest rate. The Bills are the seventh-heaviest zone defense. Look for Hopkins to get peppered on in-breaking routes in the open middle of the field against Buffalo. He needs to have a big game for the Chiefs to win. Despite all the players added over the last 365 days for Buffalo, Khalil Shakir has been their best pass-catcher this season. Amari Cooper may be back for this matchup but his availability doesn’t impact Shakir’s role as the slot receiver. Dalton Kincaid has been ruled out as well. Shakir leads the team in targets and has seen his route participation jump in recent weeks. He’s a layup target who averages a beefy 8.5 yards after the catch per reception. That gig as the slot receiver will be critical in this game. The Chiefs smother perimeter receivers but give up over 91 yards per game to slot receivers, a top-five mark. Most important Seahawks storyline: When I watch Jaxon Smith-Njigba’s film, all the way back to Ohio State to his second year in the NFL, I don’t see a reason he can’t continue to get the type of downfield targets we saw in Week 9. JSN carried a hefty 20.2 aDOT in the game before the bye and a mere 8.1 in the eight weeks prior. Obviously, with the return of DK Metcalf looking likely, whether JSN continues to get those looks is another question. That Week 9 game is the outlier for JSN but it could also be a “can’t put the genie back in the bottle” moment for Seattle’s coaching staff. Perhaps they went into the bye looking for ways to get him working on downfield combination routes with Metcalf. The Seahawks' passing game has been voluminous but not all that efficient. This can be a way to unlock a new ceiling but that’s just me theorizing. Most important 49ers storyline: We got some clarity on the 49ers' wide receiver room in their first game from the bye. The new starters have more clarity from a deployment standpoint. What does the future of this 49ers WR room look like next year and beyond, given the investments made in multiple players? Talked that out with @Nate_Tice on the latest film room episode. pic.twitter.com/Xw6d6oE0Bx — Matt Harmon (@MattHarmon_BYB) November 14, 2024 Jauan Jennings played excellent football in his first game as the starting X-receiver. He worked well in one-on-one situations, especially on the out-breaking routes. He looks like a keeper and if his level of usage from Week 10 is sticky, he can be a must-start player in fantasy against weaker secondaries like Seattle’s group. Rookie Ricky Pearsall played as the flanker and took some slot reps. He was used as a middle-of-the-field option and his instincts in the open field were on display. Pearsall is a natural fit in Kyle Shanahan’s offense and while he won’t see the field as much as Jennings, he can also be a fantasy starter with the way San Francisco has jumped their pure dropback pass rate. Most important Texans storyline: The return of Nico Collins. The Texans offense lacks consistent separation and an answer for pressure. Collins may not fix everything for this team but … he’ll get pretty close. In the first five games of the season, he led the Texans in targets when C.J. Stroud was under pressure and averaged over 16 air yards per target. Collins was the answer against the rush and Stroud found him for vertical shots. If we want to be quite honest about the way the Texans offense has operated the past two seasons, when Stroud and Collins aren’t creating heat together, the design of the unit leaves much to be desired. The Cowboys secondary has been an issue all season and a healthy Collins should tear through this unit. It’s all about how many holes he can patch in his first game back in action. Most important Cowboys storyline: The Cowboys are on a rocketship toward “skip” territory. However, there are sadly still some players here we care about in fantasy football. We have to hope that this game is a sign that CeeDee Lamb is consolidating as much volume as possible in the passing game and Rico Dowdle in the ground game. For the former, Lamb was targeted on a whopping 37% of his routes last week in Cooper Rush’s first start. In the backfield, Mike McCarthy sounds like he’s ready to stop messing around with the 2017 Pro Bowl crew and play Dowdle as the clear RB1. This is the type of usage both players will need to keep their fantasy floors alive. Nothing will be pretty for Dallas at any point during the rest of this season, so these two guys will require as many touches as possible. Most important Packers storyline: I’m anxiously awaiting to see what Matt LaFleur uncorks for the Packers offense coming out of the bye. Green Bay is one of my favorite attacks to watch right now. Excited to see the Packers offense coming out of their bye week. This is one of my favorite offenses because they have so many dimensions and layers with the skill-position players. Specifically, I enjoy the role and play of Romeo Doubs, Jayden Reed, and Tucker Kraft. pic.twitter.com/brDW2SYjHL — Matt Harmon (@MattHarmon_BYB) November 13, 2024 In the passing game, they’ve gotten significant volume and playing time to five different players between tight end Tucker Kraft and all four of those top receivers. It’s worth wondering if they spent the bye week narrowing roles and situational routes for any of the wideouts. The run game may carry even more intrigue. You can essentially split the Packers’ season into multiple portions between the banged-up Jordan Love moments, the games he’s been closer to healthy and the Malik Willis starts. I bet LaFleur would love to marry some of the exotic run concepts he unveiled in the Willis starts with the traditional offense. Having Love closer to full strength and able to go under center is necessary to accomplish this. I expect a heavy dose of Jacobs and the ground game off the bye. Most important Bears storyline: The Bears fired Shane Waldron this week. By no means will this fix all that ails Chicago. However, they were running into “the definition of insanity” principle by just trying the same thing every week and expecting different results. They had to do something. Thomas Brown will take over and he comes from the same Rams’ tree Waldron once sprouted off. Waldron wasn’t running a passing game with many McVay-style concepts so maybe Brown will change a few wrinkles. It’s just well beyond too late to upend the entire attack. If anything, we may see Brown emphasize the run game, as his background comes from being a running backs coach. Taking some burden off of Caleb Williams’ shoulders doesn’t sound like too bad of an idea at this stage. Most important Rams storyline: Matthew Stafford under pressure is becoming an issue. The Rams haven’t allowed an inordinate amount of pressure over the course of the season. The problem is that the plays are just about dead when there is additional heat on Stafford. Per Pro Football Focus, Stafford’s 47.1 passer rating is dead-last among 27 quarterbacks to take at least half of their team’s dropbacks. The Rams got several of their main starting offensive linemen back from injury last week but you could feel the lack of practice time this group has had together in those positions. Communication errors led to several moments that sunk the ship. The Patriots don’t have the most intimidating pass rush in the world, as their 20.2% pressure rate is a bottom-10 result league-wide. Then again, they rank two spots ahead of Miami, which just obliterated the Rams and Stafford. You can still play all your Rams mainstays in fantasy but if this continues to be a problem, it’ll shave off the ceiling of this attack. Most important Patriots storyline: New England looks like they’re closing in on their main pass-catchers. Against all odds, Kayshon Boutte has seemingly emerged as the top NE wideout. Boutte has run a route on 95.7% of the dropbacks since Week 8 and has tied Hunter Henry with a team-high 19.8% target share. Boutte has been deployed as the vertical X-receiver with an 18.1 air yards per target mark. DeMario Douglas is tied for the team lead with 13 catches in this span and remains a short-area slot receiver. Tight end Austin Hooper has been more involved than most of the depth receivers, running a route on 40.5% of the dropbacks. None of these guys are stars but it looks like New England is starting to settle into the primary lineup. Rookie Ja’Lynn Polk finally got back into the rotation and caught a touchdown. He’s the only one who could change up the current playing time distribution. Most important Falcons storyline: It bears watching every week which opposing wideout will draw a matchup with All-Pro man-coverage corner, Patrick Surtain II. Will Drake London get the treatment in Week 11? Per NFL pro, Patrick Surtain has lined up as an outside corner on 428 snaps this year and as the slot corner for just 29. Like many of these high-end shutdown corners, Surtain doesn’t travel into the slot and that allows some top wideouts to avoid this matchup. For a recent example, Zay Flowers stung the Broncos for 127 yards and two scores on five catches in Week 9. He lined up in the slot on 16 of 30 snaps, per PFF. Few offenses have been as intentional about getting all of their pass-catchers some work out of the slot thanks to stacks, bunches and motion than the Falcons. Darnell Mooney has run 41.5% of his routes from the slot, Drake London 38.7%, Kyle Pitts 37.5% and Ray-Ray McCloud 46.7%. It’s worth noting that London has been targeted on 35.9% of his snaps from the slot, which leads the team by a significant margin. When their top receiver has been in the slot, he’s been peppered as the top read in the concept. All of these Atlanta pass-catchers will get their chances away from Surtain. Most important Broncos storyline: Audric Estimé took a leap in the Broncos backfield in their last game. After weeks of Sean Payton's promises to get him more involved, the rookie finally led the team with 14 touches and a commanding lead in team rush attempt share (63.6%). The question is whether this is sticky and if Estimé can continue tightening his grip on the top spot to be a fantasy starter. Good luck with the first point. Payton has notoriously had a wandering eye at the running back spot and just because Estimé led the way in Week 10 doesn’t indicate he’s the RB1 forever. On the second point, if Estimé does remain the led rusher, he will need more passing-down work in order to become a set-it-and-forget-it fantasy back. Javonte Williams still ran more routes than Estimé last week and Jaleel McLaughlin wasn’t totally phased out. The Broncos are the correct type of defense-first team that pairs well with a bruising back like Estimé. Getting more reps in the passing game just increases the margin for error. One reason to maybe watch: I’m honest enough to admit I’m putting these two teams in the “skip” section because I strongly believe they both deserve a timeout. Does anyone who isn’t emotionally invested in either of these two teams — bless your heart — want to watch either of them that have inundated us with needless drama and media attention this season? Alas, it’s on the schedule. Of course, I want to see what Anthony Richardson looks like in his return to the lineup and if his “breather” away from the starting gig changes anything about his game. However, that can be accomplished on a rewatch. One reason to maybe watch: There’s probably a good chunk of the fantasy community that doesn't want to admit this, but Brian Thomas Jr. was mostly relying on big plays to accumulate fantasy points this season. That doesn’t necessarily have to be taken as disrespect; his profile was always one of a big-play wideout. Thomas was ripping off vertical shot receptions and big run-after-catch plays in the first half of the season on the way to being the WR11 despite not seeing a 20% target share in his offense. How many of those plays will he get in games with Mac Jones under center? We just need to adjust expectations for the rookie wideout going forward. It could be especially tough sledding this week against a Lions defense that harasses quarterbacks and plays physical coverage on the outside. One reason to maybe watch: We are on a little bit of a “Sam Darnold watch” after the Vikings starter had a poor statistical game against the woeful Jaguars defense. Darnold’s 48.2 passer rating was the lowest of the season, but his -2.4 EPA per dropback was just the third-lowest. So, at least, that can serve as a reminder that this wasn’t the first time we’ve seen bad Darnold this season. The reality is that Darnold is always going to be a volatile quarterback. He’s playing in the best situation of his career by far, but that doesn’t fundamentally change the tiger’s stripes. He will still be prone to these low moments. Vikings fans and fantasy players just have to hope we don’t enter an extended stretch of down games. This Titans defense has been a tougher unit to go against but well-constructed passing games have given them issues. One reason to maybe watch: The Dolphins offense has not dominated the middle of the field in the passing game like they have in prior seasons. Opposing defenses have cracked the code against Miami...Tua Tagovalioa on all throws over the middle of the field (@FantasyPtsData):2024passer rating: 85.7 (27th-of-35 QB)yards per attempt: 8.9 (16th)fantasy points per drop back: 0.32 (33rd)2023rating: 132.1 (1st)YPA:… — Graham Barfield (@GrahamBarfield) November 14, 2024 There are a number of things at play. The wide receivers aren’t playing as well as they did in 2022 and 2023, the offensive line is worse and I don’t think Mike McDaniel has done enough to alter the deployment of Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle to account for defensive counterattacks. The designed De’Von Achane reps in the passing game have seemingly become the focus of the unit. That’s contributing to Miami feeling less dangerous downfield. Will any of these issues matter against the Raiders? Maybe not. If we don’t see the Dolphins offense shred Las Vegas, I’ll be concerned we just aren’t going to get there this year, at any point. One reason to maybe watch: In the two games prior to Cleveland’s bye week, Cedric Tillman was one of the most utilized players at his position across the league. Tillman garnered 19 targets, 268 air yards (fifth-most among receivers) and a pair of end-zone targets. You can’t ask for much more. Tillman is a big receiver who can win at X both with some separation, contested-catch prowess and a subtle ability to earn yards after the catch. His tape has been as legit as the production. Coming off the bye, Tillman and the Browns will play a Saints defense that’s declined throughout the course of the season. In just the last month, they’ve allowed the seventh-most yards per target as a pass defense amid both coverage and tackling issues. This is not a stay-away matchup for any of these Browns' passing-game players, Tillman chief among them.",2024-11-15

Many starts and sits are obvious too, so we will instead focus on fringe options in this column, the ones that take real thought. Good luck with your Week 11 lineups! Jacobs remains due for further touchdown regression, and he gets a run-funnel Chicago defense this week. The Bears have allowed the fewest fantasy points to quarterbacks but the eighth-most RB rushing yards per game (111.6). Caleb Williams’ dramatic struggles (the Bears have gone 23 straight drives without a touchdown) could help lead to a positive game script, as Green Bay enters 5.5-point favorites. Jacobs has averaged 100.0 yards from scrimmage and scored all four of his touchdowns during wins this season. Montgomery has been quieter during a tougher stretch of schedule over the last four games, but his upcoming matchups look highly favorable, starting Sunday. Jacksonville has allowed the fifth-most fantasy points to running backs and enter as 14-point underdogs with Mac Jones starting. The Lions have the highest implied team total (30.5 points) this week, and game script should lead to a ton of carries. Smith’s snap share dropped a bit Monday night, but he was second on Miami in receiving yards and nearly scored a touchdown while being tackled at the one. Smith is tied for second on the Dolphins in first-read target% over five games with Tua Tagovailoa this season. Smith leads all tight ends in first downs per route run, which is one of the best future indicators. Las Vegas has yielded the fifth-most fantasy points to tight ends and is a pass-funnel defense. Raiders’ opponents have the second-highest pass rate over expectation (+4.4%) this season. Tagovailoa ranks 36th in deep-throw attempt rate (7.7%) and sports the lowest average intended air yards (5.4) among all quarterbacks this season. That’s been bad news for Tyreek Hill, but Smith has benefitted and can be started in fantasy lineups. Maye leads the NFL in QB rush yards, scrambles and scramble yards since taking over as New England’s starter. He’s averaged more yards per scramble (10.8) than Jayden Daniels while ranking top 10 in Hero Throw rate and Off-Target throw rate. The Rams have allowed just 72.8 rushing yards and zero touchdowns to running backs since Week 5, but Los Angeles has ceded the second-most YPA (8.4). The Rams have the league’s third best pressure rate, but Maye’s fantasy production has actually increased when pressured this season; the rookie has the fourth-most fantasy points per dropback when pressured. Maye is a sneaky fantasy start if needed this week. Chubb may not be the player he once was, but he’s seen 75% of Cleveland’s RB carries over three games since returning. He’s faced three tough run defenses that rank top eight in RB fantasy points allowed, but Chubb gets a much more favorable matchup this week. The Browns are (minor) favorites against a Saints’ defense allowing the third-most fantasy points to running backs. And most of the damage has come via the ground not by receiving backs, as New Orleans has yielded 5.2 YPC and the third-most rushing scores (14). Chubb could also be healthier coming out of his bye, so he belongs in fantasy lineups. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Wilson has averaged 8.7 YPA, 245.7 passing yards and 2.0 touchdowns over three starts this season. He’s fantasy’s QB7 in points per game on the year, and he gets a prime pass-funnel matchup this week. Baltimore has ceded the second-fewest RB rushing yards per game (56.8) but the second-most fantasy points to QBs. Ravens’ opponents have the highest PROE (+6.8%) by a wide margin. Wilson is a top-10 QB this week in a fast-paced matchup against a carnival opponent. Sit Najee Harris, who’s losing touches to Jaylen Warren and gets a tough matchup. Harris remains Pittsburgh’s lead back, but he’s played fewer than 50% of the snaps in three of four games since Warren returned, though Warren is notably questionable with a back injury. The Ravens have ceded an NFL-low 3.4 YPC, so Harris’ expectations should be tempered this week. Pollard’s snap share dropped to 53% during Tyjae Spears’ return last week, including splitting snaps evenly in the red zone. Pollard’s route participation (45%) was his lowest since Week 1. He remained limited by his foot injury in Thursday’s practice, and Pollard has a tough matchup this week. Minnesota has allowed the fourth-fewest YPC (3.8) and the second-fewest touchdown runs (four) this season. Tennessee has a lowly 17.5-point implied team total, so explore alternatives to Pollard if possible. Downs had his best fantasy game of the season with Anthony Richardson, but Indy’s QB switch is still a downgrade. Downs’ targets per game drop from 10.0 with Joe Flacco to 6.5 with Richardson this season, and his receptions per game fall from 7.3 to 4.0. Volume and accuracy are issues, as is this week’s matchup. The Jets have allowed the fewest fantasy points to wide receivers this season, including the sixth-fewest to the slot. New York’s defense has unquestionably fallen since firing Robert Saleh (they missed a mere 20 tackles last week), but the Jets have yielded just one passing TD over the last three games. Michael Pittman Jr. has also returned to a full practice this week. Downs deserves bench consideration with Richardson back starting in an outdoor matchup against a strong secondary. Nix has been the QB7 in fantasy points per game since Week 4, averaging nearly as many fantasy points (20.4) as Josh Allen (20.7) over that six-game span. After attempting seven passes inside the 10-yard line over his first seven games, Nix has 11 over his last three. Nix ranks fourth among all quarterbacks in carries inside the five and expected fantasy points this season, behind only Jalen Hurts, Brock Purdy and Lamar Jackson. The Broncos get a Falcons defense allowing the 10th-fewest fantasy points to running backs but the seventh-most to quarterbacks. Denver has a big advantage up front (LT Garrett Bolles hasn’t given up a single pressure over the last four weeks) against an Atlanta front that just became the first defense in the Super Bowl era to fail to record 10 sacks over its first 10 games. Nix is a borderline top-five QB in a fast-paced matchup this week. Jennings led San Francisco in routes run, targets, catches, air yards and receiving yards during his first game without Brandon Aiyuk last week. He had the league’s sixth-highest first-read target share (38.5%), and Brock Purdy owns the league’s fourth-best Passer Rating (134.5) when targeting Jennings. He ranks second in the NFL in yards per route run, eighth in fantasy points per route run and 10th among 117 pass catchers in ESPN’s Receiving Score. Jennings owns a 32% TPRR with Aiyuk off the field, and he’s now replaced BA as the 49ers’ “X” receiver. Jennings erupted for 41 fantasy points in Week 3 with Deebo Samuel Sr. out — the only other game in which he’s acted as SF’s WR2. Jennings isn’t Terrell Owens 2.0, but he can clearly play; he’ll now see a much bigger opportunity on a potent offense due for major red-zone regression. Jennings ranks second in yards per route run versus press coverage, which Seattle uses at the league’s fifth-highest rate. The Seahawks have ceded the 10th-most fantasy points to wide receivers, and the 49ers are projected to score 28.5 points this week. Jennings suffered a reportedly mild ankle sprain in practice Thursday, so monitor his status. Should Jennings sit, Ricky Pearsall becomes a top-25 WR this week. Hunt has just one explosive rush (15+ yards) over 125 carries and will lose touches once Isiah Pacheco returns, but he has Kansas City’s backfield to himself once again Sunday. Hunt leads the league in touches per game (24.6) since entering the starting lineup in Week 5, and he’s also the RB1 in expected fantasy points. Hunt saw 10 targets last week, and he’s been given a whopping 13 opportunities inside the 5-yard line over the last four games. He’s a true workhorse in a Patrick Mahomes offense. Hunt gets a Buffalo defense allowing the sixth-fewest fantasy points to quarterbacks but the second-most to running backs this season, including the most targets (8.4) and receiving yards (54.5) per game. Hunt is a top-10 RB this week. Herbert is getting a career-high 7.8 YPA with an 11:1 TD:INT ratio, but volume has been a problem for his fantasy production. The Chargers rank 30th in pass plays per game thanks to a favorable schedule that’s been loaded with low projected totals. Los Angeles has run just three plays all season while trailing by double digits. But L.A.'s upcoming matchups should feature more shootouts, starting Sunday. The Bengals have allowed the ninth-fewest fantasy points to running backs but the fifth-most to quarterbacks. Joe Burrow is playing well and should finally provide pushback in a matchup with a 47.5-point total. The Chargers are one of just nine teams with a positive pass rate over expectation over the last month, as Los Angeles has thrown decidedly more since its bye. Herbert is a borderline top-five QB this week. Cooper Rush lost as many fumbles (2.0) as he got yards per pass attempt while replacing Dak Prescott last week. It was the fewest passing yards in a game with at least 20 attempts since 2015. Rush finished with a completion percentage over expectation (-13.5) in the eighth percentile despite an average depth of target of just 6.4 yards (18th percentile). Dallas had 49 net passing yards on 26 attempts. And Trey Lance is apparently even worse while remaining QB2. Dowdle should see all the touches he can handle; his competition is a 29-year-old Ezekiel Elliott who’s getting 3.2 YPC and lost a fumble into the end zone last week. But he’s saddled by Dallas’ offense and gets a Houston defense yielding the fifth-fewest fantasy points to running backs. The Cowboys have trailed by double digits for a league-high 42.4% of their offensive snaps and are 7.5-point underdogs, so game script could also be a problem for Dowdle on Monday night. Ferguson has the second most targets (57) without catching a touchdown in the league. The tight end struggled to convert RZ looks into scores last season and now has Rush as his QB, so TD regression may not be coming. The Cowboys have a lowly 17.5-point implied total this week, and the Texans have allowed NFL-lows in receptions per game (2.7) and receiving yards per game (24.7!) against tight ends this season. Ferguson sports just a 16% target share over his last four games, so he belongs on fantasy benches Monday night.",2024-11-15

He's proven he can do it with either quarterback, and while the blitz-happy Vikings can make things chaotic in the pocket, they also allow big plays downfield when that rush doesn't get home.‌ He's a made man in this passing game now, stepping into the Brandon Aiyuk role and gobbling up first-read targets. He's an easy WR2 start in all formats, with the upside to break his projection.‌ So many fantasy quarterbacks don't offer floor these days, but that hasn't been a problem for the athletic Nix, a resourceful runner. He's also showing improved chemistry every week with key receiver Courtland Sutton. The Falcons have a horrible pass rush, so Nix should have time to read his progressions. The New York defense was a no-show at Arizona, so forget about this being a tough matchup. And with Anthony Richardson back in the saddle, the Colts probably want to take the offense back to basics. Advantage, Taylor. He's one of the easy buttons in the Buffalo offense, and with so many key teammates hurt, opportunity should be trending up. Shakir also had seven catches and a touchdown against Kansas City in the playoffs. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. He hasn't looked explosive in his three games back from injury, but the bye week surely helped and the New Orleans front seven is getting gashed in the running game. Everyone looks to defeat the Ravens through the air, justifiably, but Pittsburgh's offensive identity is ground-and-pound and Harris might be needed for 20 carries if Jaylen Warren (back) isn't healthy. We're still not sure what's going to happen with Nico Collins this week, but the Texans probably can't look away from the splashy plays Metchie offered in the loss to Detroit. He's a viable sleeper, and a perfect Monday insurance option for Collins managers. Life with this messy quarterback room means capped upside. But Meyers has been sneaky-productive anyway, with a 32-340-2 line over his past five games. He's long been one of the most underrated receivers in football. Maybe a play-calling switch will fix what ails the Chicago passing game, but I need a prove-it result before I trust any of these guys. We knew De'Von Achane was ahead of him, but Jaylen Wright is catching up, too. Mostert could break off a 35-yard run at any moment, but how many snaps will he get? He has little problem getting open, but will Mac Jones be able to find him? The Detroit secondary is also playing at a high level right now, with two likely Pro Bowlers.",2024-11-15
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Dodgers' top 5 offseason questions: Where will Mookie Betts play in infield and what domino effect will that create?,https://sports.yahoo.com/dodgers-top-5-offseason-questions-where-will-mookie-betts-play-in-infield-and-what-domino-effect-will-that-create-150058197.html,"Fri, 15 Nov 2024 15:00:58 GMT","The tone is certainly different as this hot stove season commences considering L.A.'s campaign ended on the ultimate high note, but that’s not to say the Dodgers won’t be busy.","A year ago, the Los Angeles Dodgers entered the offseason with a frustratingly familiar sour taste of an early postseason exit. A decade of consecutive trips to October had yielded only one championship, and being swept in the NLDS by the division rival Arizona Diamondbacks sparked a high-degree of urgency to make meaningful roster improvements. That manifested in one of the more impactful set of offseason moves we’ve ever seen: the titanic signings of Japanese mega-stars Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, the acquisition and extension of ace right-hander Tyler Glasnow, and the January addition of outfielder Teoscar Hernández, all of whom would go on to contribute tremendously in 2024 as the Dodgers captured their eighth World Series title in franchise history. The tone is certainly different as this hot stove season commences considering L.A.'s campaign ended on the ultimate high note, but that’s not to say the Dodgers won’t be busy. While the core of a no-doubt contender remains firmly in place, reinforcements will be required. And based on the way Mookie Betts was talking at the victory parade, there is still ample motivation within the organization to defend its crown and attempt to become the first team since the 2000 Yankees to win consecutive championships (that season capped a Yankee three-peat). Here are the five biggest questions facing the Dodgers as they look to build a roster capable of repeating: Betts was the everyday shortstop from Opening Day until he was hit by a pitch and suffered a broken hand in mid-June. He played almost exclusively right field upon his return from the injured list in August, including throughout October. General manager Brandon Gomes revealed at the GM Meetings earlier this month that the team plans to move Betts back to the infield in 2025, though whether that be at second base or shortstop is yet to be determined. That uncertainty leaves a lot of room to speculate. Miguel Rojas, Gavin Lux, Chris Taylor and Tommy Edman remain on the roster as viable candidates to claim a middle infield spot opposite Betts. If we focus on this quartet of internal options, the most crucial unknown is which of them the Dodgers view as worthy of getting everyday at-bats — if any. The switch-hitting Edman is the most likely of the bunch to warrant such regular playing time but his at-bats could also come in the outfield, so there’s flexibility there. If Edman remains entrenched at the shortstop position he played for nearly all of October and Betts becomes the everyday second baseman, that would seemingly squeeze Lux out of playing time considering the organization’s reluctance to trust Lux at shortstop. If Betts is at shortstop, there’s more wiggle room to shuffle through Lux — who was sneaky stellar in the second half of the regular season (.899 OPS) — Rojas and Taylor at the keystone. That said, if the Dodgers are committed to moving Betts back to the infield but also want to prioritize defense, letting him settle in at second base, where he has more experience and rates more favorably, feels more likely. That makes Lux a name to monitor this winter as a possible trade chip. While the middle infield outlook remains cloudy, the good news is that there is no doubt whatsoever about the corner infield spots. After some cameos at second base earlier in his career, Max Muncy appears to be finally settling in at third base and showed marked improvements with the glove in 2024. World Series MVP Freddie Freeman is the star incumbent at first base. As such, this Dodgers infield, if it indeed features Betts again, will be a no-doubt strength regardless of who occupies the fourth spot. More intriguing then is what such a move will mean for the position Betts is vacating. On the surface, moving Betts back to the infield seems to be plugging a hole that didn’t really exist while opening up a much more prominent one in right field at a time when the other two outfield spots aren’t exactly spoken for either. That could change in the event of a reunion with Hernández, with both sides expressing serious interest about keeping the free-agent outfielder in L.A. after such a successful season together. Even if we pencil in a Hernández return in left field — far from a guarantee considering how hot his market is expected to be — center field and right field emerge as weak spots on an otherwise loaded roster. With James Outman falling completely out of the picture following his breakout in 2023, center fielder Andy Pages emerged with a solid rookie campaign of his own in 2024. Was it good enough to earn him everyday reps in 2025? Outside of a two-homer game in a loss against the Mets in NLCS Game 5, Pages did next to nothing in October and didn’t appear in the World Series despite being on the roster. It’s difficult to imagine Pages being Plan A in center field on Opening Day next year, but it shouldn’t be ruled out. It seems even less likely the Dodgers will be counting on Outman in any meaningful way, but perhaps he finds a way to rebound. Edman is an interesting part of this equation. After being acquired from St. Louis at the trade deadline, Edman bounced back and forth between shortstop and center field down the stretch in the regular season but played the vast majority of his innings in October at shortstop. Perhaps Edman continues to split his time evenly between the infield and outfield — that versatility is the root of his immense value, after all — but he sure looks like the Dodgers’ best option in center field as things currently stand, albeit with a whole winter ahead of us. Let’s grant a Hernández reunion and some combination of Edman and Pages in center field. What then to expect in right field? Yes, there is a fellow named Juan Soto available in free agency, but the Dodgers are expected to remain on the periphery of the intense pursuit of his services. Other free-agent outfielders are available, though, and looking at the tier of guys like Michael Conforto, Randal Grichuk or Max Kepler on a short-term deal could make a lot of sense. Top prospect Dalton Rushing is one more name to know here. Drafted as a catcher, the lefty-hitting Rushing slugged his way to Triple-A in 2024 and spent the majority of his time in the second half playing left field. With the backstop responsibilities already spoken for but Rushing’s bat projecting to be ready sooner rather than later, don’t be surprised if he is discussed in spring training as an option for outfield at-bats in 2025. The Dodgers have five pitchers hitting free agency with varying levels of sentimentality attached, and in turn, likelihood of returning. Let’s start with the legendary Clayton Kershaw, who declined his player option for 2025 but has been extremely open in recent weeks about his desire to remain a Dodger. He also revealed he will need toe and knee surgeries this winter, putting his readiness for Opening Day in doubt. Still, it seems like we can expect the future Hall of Famer to play a role in the Dodgers' rotation at some point in 2025. In the bullpen, there's Blake Treinen and Joe Kelly. Kelly has been a fan favorite for quite some time, but his effectiveness and relevance declined sharply in 2024, leaving his future in L.A. in doubt. Treinen, whose heroic seven-out appearance to help the Dodgers close out the World Series cemented his place in franchise lore, is a far more crucial arm to retain. He’ll turn 37 in June, but he remains one of the more dominant relievers in the sport. He is not easily replaceable. There are a fair number of other accomplished bullpen arms on the market — including former longtime closer Kenley Jansen — but keeping Treinen should still be a priority. Then there’s Walker Buehler and Jack Flaherty, two pitchers whose narratives shifted dramatically over the course of October. Flaherty fortified the rotation after being acquired at the trade deadline but then was extremely volatile in his five postseason starts. An L.A. native, Flaherty unsurprisingly loved his experience pitching for the team he grew up rooting for, but it’s unclear if he makes sense as a worthwhile long-term Dodgers commitment. He’s young for a free-agent arm having just turned 29, but remains something of a wild card from a durability standpoint, which isn’t exactly a trait the Dodgers need more of from their starting pitchers. Flaherty unquestionably played a huge role in the team winning it all, but his Dodgers stint may ultimately turn out to be temporary. Buehler, on the other hand, is a beloved homegrown star whose Dodgers tenure seemed certain to come to an end before an epic run of fantastic playoff appearances reignited the fan base’s affection for him after what had been a tumultuous road back from a second Tommy John surgery. How much will Buehler’s October impact the Dodgers’ interest in retaining him — or increase the interest from other teams eager to sway him to sign elsewhere? Such a small sample of success after such a poor regular season makes it difficult to say, but if that was the end of Buehler as a Dodger, it was one hell of a way to go out. Even before any potential additions or the possible returns of Buehler and/or Flaherty, arguably no rotation in baseball currently boasts more upside while also featuring more massive question marks than the Dodgers'. The view through rose-colored glasses is clear: Glasnow was sensational when he was on the mound, and though he was on the shelf for the playoffs with an elbow injury, the right-hander indicated he expects to be a full-go for spring training. When healthy, Yamamoto was as advertised in his debut Dodgers season, and was especially brilliant in his final three postseason starts. And of course, Ohtani is expected to make his highly anticipated return to the mound as well, adding another top-of-the-rotation caliber arm to the mix. That top three alone is tremendous from a pure talent perspective, albeit all three will enter 2025 with questions about their ability to sustain a full-season workload — a theme that extends to a boatload of internal rotation candidates beyond them. From that perspective, it’s tough to declare this rotation an obvious strength at the outset of the offseason. It’s a staggering collection of arms who are either coming back from injury (Kershaw, Tony Gonsolin, Emmet Sheehan, Nick Frasso) or whose 2024 seasons leave their future as starters in question (Bobby Miller, Landon Knack, Ben Casparius, Justin Wrobleski). And that doesn’t include those who are already slated to likely miss all of 2025 due to surgery (Gavin Stone, River Ryan, Kyle Hurt). A positive outlook suggests a wealth of appealing options that could emerge as not just viable, but impactful starters. You could also look at all the uncertainty baked into that pool of hurlers and conclude that further additions on the mound are absolutely necessary. Which brings us to our final question … Assuming a surprise Soto signing isn’t coming, it will be impossible for the Dodgers to even come close to replicating the seismic impact of last winter’s moves headlined by the Ohtani signing. And let’s be real: that’s OK. We might never again see anything like what the Dodgers accomplished last winter. But there are several marquee non-Soto names available that can not be ruled out as sensible targets. Japanese pitching phenom Roki Sasaki, 23, has been heavily linked to the Dodgers in the early stages of his unique free agency, though it is far from a foregone conclusion that the right-hander — who all 30 teams will be able to afford due to the unique circumstances of his posting — will end up in Dodger blue. Sasaki would surely infuse another jolt of elite talent to the rotation right away, albeit the kind that also comes with questions about how many innings he’ll be able to contribute. Beyond that, it will come down to which part of the roster the Dodgers' front office views as most in need of upgrades. Perhaps shortstop Willy Adames makes sense as an avenue to supercharge an already-star studded infield even further, and Betts ends up playing second base. What seems more likely is Hernández ends up being the most impactful position player signed by the Dodgers this winter, with a pursuit of a more durable ace a la Corbin Burnes or Max Fried emerging as the team’s biggest potential expenditure. No matter what they end up doing, the evolution of the Dodgers’ roster will remain a key storyline of the MLB offseason. They’ve fully earned that attention, both for their unparalleled success on the field in the summer and fall, and for their consistent high-profile activity in the winter.",2024-11-15

Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Scott Boras shares Bregman nugget that could lead All-Star to Boston,https://sports.yahoo.com/scott-boras-shares-bregman-nugget-185610879.html,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 18:56:10 GMT","Alex Bregman seemed like a challenging fit for the Red Sox in free agency, but his agent's recent admission might change that, writes John Tomase.","Scott Boras shares Bregman nugget that could lead All-Star to Boston originally appeared on NBC Sports Boston Now here's a piece of news that may have slipped under the radar, but could have ramifications for the Red Sox: Free agent Alex Bregman is willing to move to second base. As the Red Sox try to get more right-handed this winter, Bregman looks like an obvious fit – with one major exception. Because he plays the same position as Rafael Devers, slotting him onto the roster at his natural spot of third base won't be easy. Bregman just won his first Gold Glove and has long been one of the best defensive third basemen in baseball. He just had the misfortune of sharing a league with Matt Chapman for most of his nine-year career, thus denying him that hardware. (Chapman switched leagues this year and recently won his fifth Gold Glove, with the Giants). There's no question Bregman would represent a significant defensive upgrade over the inconsistent Devers, but such moves aren't made in a vacuum, and Devers' ego must be taken into consideration, especially since he's the highest-paid player in club history at $313 million. He has made it clear he considers himself a third baseman and derives part of his identity from manning the position. The Red Sox must weigh the mental repercussions of any move. And that's to say nothing of the domino effect it would have on the rest of the roster. Does Devers take first base and force a trade of Triston Casas? Does he shift to designated hitter, where Masataka Yoshida is in the middle of a $90 million contract? Does Yoshida need to then take his subpar glove back to the outfield? Second base is an entirely different story. The Red Sox traded left-hander Chris Sale to the Braves last year for young infielder Vaughn Grissom on the assumption that he'd take over the double play pivot and join the club's promising young prospect core as a key part of the next great Red Sox team. So much for that. While Sale won the pitching triple crown in the National League and is the overwhelming favorite to claim the first Cy Young Award of his illustrious career, Grissom practically played himself off the roster. He battled injury and illness while hitting just .190 and exhibiting worrisome throwing mechanics. He's now merely one of many competing for the job, rather than the entrenched incumbent. Enter Bregman. His agent, Scott Boras, highlighted Bregman's place at the center of the recent Astros juggernaut. He's well-known across baseball as a leader and heart-and-soul kind of player, and he's no stranger to the big stage. Boras then just dropped this little nugget: ""You just don't have many players on the dirt that do what he does,"" Boras told reporters, including Bob Nightengale of USA TODAY. ""Also that Bregman can play second base, third base, his leadership, it's a market certainly that the Astros are very aware is very healthy to him."" Second base? Boras says nothing unintentionally, and that comment is surely designed to expand Bregman's market. Suddenly the Red Sox make much more sense as a destination. Bregman is a superstar, and putting him at second base would solve two problems without impacting the team's prospect pool or the rest of the roster. He has only played nine games there in his career, but he has made 129 appearances at short, and we've already mentioned he's a Gold Glover at third. Even if the 6-foot, 190-pounder is no longer than 9-WAR player with 40-homer power of five years ago, he's still damn good as he enters his age-31 season. ALEX BREGMAN WALKS IT OFF FOR THE ASTROS 💥 pic.twitter.com/cJLG0ZqvNp — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) July 28, 2024 And while some might argue that the second base job should go to prospect Kristian Campbell, there's no comparison between a rookie and an established star like Bregman, besides which, Campbell can also play shortstop and outfield; there are other ways to get his bat into the lineup if that's the goal. Signing Bregman would also open the possibility of making Campbell the centerpiece of a deal for young pitching, should management choose to fill any rotation openings that way. The Athletic's Tim Britton projects that Bregman will receive a six-year, $180 million contract. Given how poorly Boras's clients performed last year while awaiting big paydays that never came, perhaps his guys will be more amenable to signing earlier this time around. That could make Bregman a perfect solution for the Red Sox in an unexpected fashion, with the added bonus of establishing that, this offseason, the Red Sox really do plan to make a splash.",2024-11-14
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Keys to a fantasy football victory in Week 11,https://sports.yahoo.com/keys-to-a-fantasy-football-victory-in-week-11-144755864.html,"Fri, 15 Nov 2024 14:47:55 GMT",Fantasy football analyst Sal Vetri delivers his keys to victory for Week 11.,"Dominate your fantasy football leagues with these keys to victory for Week 11. Dobbins is coming off an interesting week. He played his usual 67% of the team’s snaps but only handled 45% of the rush attempts. Gus Edwards returned for this game and immediately saw 10 carries to Dobbins' 15. We also saw Hassan Haskins get involved for a goal-line touchdown in his revenge game against his former team, the Titans. This caused some panic for Dobbins’ fantasy managers, but I’m here to say, ""R-E-L-A-X."" Dobbins is fine. This was Edwards' most efficient day of the season. This likely led to him earning more volume than we saw him get in Weeks 3-4. But Dobbins still handled a team-high 18 opportunities and was used as the primary passing-down back. Expect Dobbins to continue to be the clear RB1 on the Chargers. This week he gets a nice matchup at home against the Bengals. Cincinnati allows the seventh most rushing efficiency this season according to NFL Pro. Start Dobbins with confidence in Week 11. Pollard produced just 63 scoreless yards in Week 10. This was his worst performance in nearly two months. This also happened to be the same week backup Tyjae Spears returned from a hamstring injury. Spears was efficient, turning his 10 touches into 51 yards while playing a season-high 47% snaps. But this needs more context because Pollard left this game for some time with an ankle issue. It’s likely Pollard would’ve commanded more snaps and touches had he not left the game. Pollard should be fine moving forward, but this week he has a tough matchup. Pollard and the Titans are six-point underdogs against the Vikings. Minnesota allows the second-fewest rushing yards per game this season. There’s a chance Spears earns more passing-down snaps if the Titans fall behind in this one. You can still start Pollard this week but temper your expectations in this sketchy spot. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Jennings is coming off a strong performance in Week 10. He returned from a hip injury and immediately led the 49ers with 11 targets. He turned this elite target volume into seven catches for 93 yards. This was the first time this season that Jennings lined up primarily as the team’s X outside receiver. He was playing the Brandon Aiyuk role in the offense, and it led to fantastic usage and production. Jennings has now produced at least 88 receiving yards in three of his last four completed games. This week Jennings finds himself in another quality spot. He’ll face a Seahawks secondary that ranks bottom-10 in coverage according to PFF. Seattle allowed 36 points to the 49ers in their Week 6 matchup. In this game, Brock Purdy completed 64% of his passes for 255 yards and three touchdowns. Expect another game of strong usage for Jennings. He’s a must-start this week and moving forward. It’s been a rough few weeks for the Jaguars' first-round rookie. Thomas has been battling a chest injury the past two weeks and his rest-of-season outlook only got worse in Week 10 with Mac Jones as his starting QB. Thomas saw a season-low three targets and only caught two balls for 12 yards. Trevor Lawrence has already been ruled out for Week 11 and his rest-of-season availability is now in question. Thomas is an exciting outside receiver who wins with speed and explosiveness downfield. This is a great profile to pair with Lawrence and we’ve seen that combination work wonders this season. But Jones may be the worst-case scenario for Thomas at QB. Jones isn’t known for his arm or ability to hit downfield throws consistently. Thomas is quickly trending down the weekly fantasy rankings and it’s hard to start him this week against the Lions who rank third in both pass rush and coverage this season according to PFF. Sit Thomas in Week 11. McConkey is set up for a bounce-back performance in Week 10. The Chargers rookie earned a season-low two targets against the Titans. He turned this usage into two catches for 52 yards. It was his worst fantasy finish since Week 2 when he caught two balls for 26 yards. But this was a tough matchup for the Chargers passing game and McConkey. Entering Week 10, the Titans were allowing the fewest receiving yards per play according to NFL Pro. This was only the second time this season McConkey didn’t see at least a 20% target share and his first time below 19% all year. Consider this poor Week 10 showing an outlier. Heading into Week 11, McConkey finds himself in a much better matchup. The Chargers will face a Bengals secondary that just allowed three different Ravens pass-catchers to earn at least 17 fantasy points in Week 10. Lamar Jackson torched the Bengals for 290 passing yards and four touchdowns last week. Cincinnati ranks 27th in coverage this season and the Chargers rank top-three in passing efficiency over the past month of the season. Expect another strong passing day for Justin Herbert and this offense. That benefits McConkey; he’s a start this week. Mitchell had his best game of the season in Week 10. He started in place of an injured Michael Pittman Jr. and Mitchell was able to catch all six of his targets for 71 yards. He generated multiple explosive plays of 10+ yards in this contest while leading the Colts in snaps and routes run. There’s a decent chance Mitchell starts again this week as Pittman battles a back injury. This injury almost landed Pittman on IR a few weeks ago and he’s reportedly struggling to even bend his back right now. If Pittman misses Week 11, Mitchell once again becomes a viable FLEX option even with QB Anthony Richardson back under center. Mitchell will face a Jets defense that has struggled since firing coach Robert Saleh. New York allowed Kyler Murray to complete 92% of his passes last week. Pick up and play Mitchell if Pittman is out this week. Tillman is heading out of his bye week red-hot. He’s been one of the best wide receivers in football the past month of the season. In fact, over the past four weeks, Tillman ranks second in fantasy points per game behind only Ja’Marr Chase. During this time, Tillman has averaged 85 yards on 10 targets per game. His rest-of-season schedule is mostly tough, but his Week 11 matchup isn't. Tillman will face the Saints this week. New Orleans no longer has star cornerback Marshon Lattimore on its roster after trading him to the Commanders. In Week 10, the Saints played their first game without Lattimore and allowed 306 passing yards to Kirk Cousins and the Falcons. Both Darnell Mooney and Drake London topped 90 receiving yards in this game and both were able to produce plenty of yards after the catch against the Saints' 32nd-ranked (according to PFF) tackling unit. Make sure Tillman is in your lineups this week; he’s a must-start. In Week 10, we saw an interesting development in the Broncos backfield. Rookie Audric Estimé led the Denver RBs with a season-high 45% of the snaps. Estimé also handled 14 of the 17 RB carries (82%) in this game, by far his best usage on the season. Veteran Javonte Williams saw just one carry and played a season-low 29% of the offensive snaps. This usage made Estimé a priority add off waiver wires this past week. This makes sense, but I’m not ready to confidently say Estimé is a fantasy starter moving forward. The Broncos backfield is still using three different RBs. Jaleel McLaughlin actually started in Week 10 and played 11% of the snaps. Even though Estimé saw the bulk of the carries in Week 10 he wasn’t able to do much with them, averaging just 3.7 yards on his 14 touches. To make matters worse, the fifth-round rookie is not known for pass-catching abilities. He’ll likely need a touchdown to be fantasy-relevant most weeks and that’s a bit challenging in a backfield that’s using three RBs and has a mobile QB in Bo Nix. Continue to monitor this backfield’s usage in Week 11 against the Falcons. Estimé isn’t a start this week, but if his strong role continues, he could become a FLEX option moving forward; he does have a nice Week 12 matchup against the Raiders.",2024-11-15

""At the end of the day, I just got to suck it up and just deal with the pain,"" Hill said. ""It's going to get worse the more I play, but I got to [tough] it out for my team. I'm here, I'm locked in no matter what, no matter how I feel. So even if I've got to cut my wrist off, I'm still out there because I love the game of football. ""Surgery was brought up and it was talked about whenever I talked to a few of the doctors, but it's my call at the end of the day, and my call is to stay out on the field."" The Miami Dolphins wide receiver injured the wrist during a joint training camp practice with the Washington Commanders. The discomfort has only increased as the 2024 season has gone on. Hill sat out the team's final two practices last week and was listed as questionable ahead of their game on Monday night against the Los Angeles Rams. Hill is expected to play this week against the Las Vegas Raiders. Buffalo Bills wide receiver Amari Cooper has missed the team's last two games with a wrist injury suffered in Week 8. Cooper said this week he feels ready to return after being limited in practice. ""Definitely feeling better. Definitely more comfortable,"" Cooper said. ""So, just ready to play football again."" Cooper, who is listed as questionable, will continue to wear a cast on the wrist and said he does not feel any pain catching passes, he just needs to get used to wearing it while playing. The Bills will be without wide receiver Keon Coleman for a second straight week as he's dealing with a wrist injury of his own. Tight end Dalton Kincaid has also been ruled out with a knee injury. After missing training camp and the first nine weeks of the regular season, New England Patriots defensive lineman Christian Barmore returned to practice on Thursday. Barmore spent time on the non-football illness list while dealing with blood clots. Barmore, who is coming off a season where he appeared in all 17 games and had 65 tackles with 8.5 sacks and 13 tackles for loss, did not speak to reporters after practice, but he did post an Instagram story: “Where there's no pain, there is no gain."" It's unlikely the 25-year-old will play this week against the Los Angeles Rams, but the fact that he's back on the field is a good sign. “He’s out there. That’s the first step, and then go from there,"" said defensive coordinator DeMarcus Covington. ""Let’s take it one day at a time, one week at a time, one game at a time, and that’s really the story for you guys, that’s the story for us, for him. There shouldn’t be any pressure on him. Like, he’s out there. That’s what it is. I’m happy that you are out there, bro. You’re out there. It’s one snap, it’s 50 snaps, don’t play this game, whatever it is, perfect. It’s better than not being out there, right? It’s better than not being able to play football again.” Patriots head coach Jerod Mayo said Friday that there is a ""chance"" Barmore plays Sunday, but first they will meet with doctors following practice. After missing the Cincinnati Bengals' last three games, wide receiver Tee Higgins will return for Sunday's matchup against the Los Angeles Chargers, according to head coach Zac Taylor. Injuries have limited Higgins to only five games this season. He has 341 receiving yards on 29 receptions with three touchdowns. Here's the rest of the Week 11 injury report.

The opening weeks of the NBA season have been besieged by absent stars. Joel Embiid. Kevin Durant. Ja Morant. Steph Curry. Jaylen Brown. Tyrese Maxey. Kawhi Leonard. Paolo Banchero. Chet Holmgren. The list goes on. Just how bad is it? Using the NBA's official definition of a ""star"" — those who were All-Stars or All-NBA performers in the previous three seasons — there are 49 star players this season. 24 of them have already missed at least one game.

The hope is that this is just an early-season blip, but there's reason to believe that the dark cloud hovering over the league is here to stay, writes Yahoo Sports' Tom Haberstroh. Read the full story. Philadelphia — Saquon Barkley (198 total yards, 2 TD) and the Eagles beat the Commanders, 26-18, to improve to 8-2 and take a 1.5-game lead atop the NFC East. Kingston, Jamaica — Ricardo Pepi scored his sixth goal in four starts to lead the USMNT to a 1-0 win over Jamaica in the first leg of their CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinal. Turin, Italy — Taylor Fritz (above) and Jannik Sinner are into the semifinals at the ATP Finals. They'll learn their opponents today with Carlos Alcaraz, Alexander Zverev, Casper Ruud and Andrey Rublev still able to qualify. The Jets' season is effectively over after Sunday's ugly 31-6 loss to the Cardinals dropped them to 3-7. So what's left for Aaron Rodgers' legacy? From Yahoo Sports' Charles Robinson: This all feels a little like Brett Favre's underwhelming single-season foray as the Jets' starting QB in 2008... except this season is exponentially worse and going off a cliff far more quickly. This is a failed season, with an objectively bad team that was all leveraged against a soon-to-be 41-year-old QB who has sunken into the mediocre middle at his position. Once we recognize that, it opens the door to the legacy question that will hang over Rodgers for the remainder of this lost season: What's left? It's an important question, given that this failure is threatening to form an impression that will be lasting. Maybe not in the disturbing neighborhood of Joe Namath fizzling out with the Rams or Johnny Unitas dropping the curtain with the Chargers. But also not anywhere near the respectably remembered 29 games that Joe Montana spent in a Chiefs uniform. If anything, Rodgers' end is shaping up like Donovan McNabb going out with a wheeze with Washington and Minnesota. Two avenues appear to be in play right now: Rodgers plays out the 2024 season, salvaging whatever he can down the stretch, then returns in 2025 for one last attempt at putting a respectable bookend on his career. This is it. We're watching Rodgers' last year with the Jets — either by virtue of him choosing retirement, or by ownership deciding to make sweeping changes. Bottom line: It's stunning to grapple with this kind of framing for Rodgers, but that's where we are. You could see it during his postgame news conference on Sunday, another one of the editions where he came off as a quiet and defeated passenger, trapped on a journey that no longer has a map. Two MLB teams will play in minor league ballparks next season. The Rays will play at Steinbrenner Field, home of the Tampa Tarpons (Yankees Single-A affiliate) and spring training home of the Yankees, due to hurricane damage sustained by Tropicana Field. The Athletics — who have officially dropped ""Oakland"" from their name — will play at Sutter Health Park, home of the Sacramento River Cats (Giants Triple-A affiliate), until a planned stadium in Las Vegas is ready. 64 years ago today, Lakers forward Elgin Baylor scored 71 points in a win over the Knicks, becoming the first player in NBA history with a 70-point game. The 70-point club: Baylor was the first of 10 players to score 70 points in a game. Wilt Chamberlain, naturally, is the only guy to do it more than once. Chamberlain (6x): 100 points (March 1962); 78 (December 1961); 73 (January 1962); 73 (November 1962); 72 (November 1962); 70 (March 1963) Kobe Bryant: 81 (January 2006) David Thompson: 73 (April 1978) Luka Dončić: 73 (January 2024) Baylor: 71 (November 1960) David Robinson: 71 (April 1994) Donovan Mitchell: 71 (January 2023) Damian Lillard: 71 (February 2023) Devin Booker: 70 (March 2017) Joel Embiid: 70 (January 2024) A Hall of Fame career: Baylor's 70-point outburst came in just his third season, when he'd already won ROY and All-Star MVP. He'd go on to finish his career with the fifth-highest scoring average ever (27.4 ppg) and 10th-highest rebounding average (13.5). The only thing missing? Incredibly, Baylor never won a championship despite playing in seven NBA Finals across his 14-year career. He and the Lakers lost six times to the Celtics and once to the Knicks. No. 12 Georgia hosts No. 7 Tennessee on Saturday (7:30pm ET, ABC) in one of the biggest regular-season games left on the college football schedule. What's at stake: The Vols (8-1) are effectively into the playoff with a win. The Bulldogs (7-2), who haven't lost three games since 2018, are almost certainly out with a loss.

Auburn upsets Texas A&M or … either Kentucky or Arkansas upsets Texas and … Whatever team was upset wins the Texas-Texas A&M game.

Florida coach Todd Golden said Thursday that the plan is for the 7-foot-9 freshman to redshirt in 2024-25. Rioux hasn’t appeared in any of the Gators’ three games so far this season, though Golden said that fans have been chanting for Rioux to appear at the end of blowout wins already. From the Gainesville Sun: ""I should have made that clear because, and honestly, it's put him in a tough situation,"" Golden said. ""He's sitting over there at the end of the games, and everybody's yelling at him and trying to get him out there, and they just hadn't understood that that was our potential plan for him. ""So that's where we're at at this moment. I'm not saying that's 100% gonna be the plan. We'll continue to talk to him and see if he, you know, changes what he wants to do, but as of right now, that's the plan that we're gonna have with him as we move forward.” Rioux holds a Guinness record for being the tallest teenager. That record came when he was 15 and listed at 7-6, too. He’s grown three inches since then and weighs over 300 pounds. Here's a clip of him playing at the FIBA U19 championships in 2023. Rioux is a native of Montreal and played at IMG Academy in Florida before signing with the Gators. When he makes his Florida debut, Rioux will be the tallest player to ever get playing time at the top level of college basketball. Right now, two players are tied for that honor at 7-7. Kenny George last played at UNC Asheville in 2008 and Mike Lanier played at Hardin-Simmons and UCLA in the late 1980s and early 1990s. If you want to put Rioux’s height into perspective, he’s listed at five inches taller than former Purdue center Zach Edey. The two-time Naismith winner was a lottery pick of the Memphis Grizzlies earlier this season.",2024-11-15
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Is Indiana for real? Plenty of doubt still exists,https://sports.yahoo.com/indiana-real-plenty-doubt-still-222343139.html,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 22:23:43 GMT",Indiana coach Curt Cignetti has the Hoosiers 10-0 for the first time in program history.,"What Indiana has accomplished this season has been the story of the year, a feel-good turnaround of a Big Ten punching bag, a moribund program that was chalked up every season as an easy win for conference teams.Instead, the Hoosiers have punched back – and knocked out every opponent. MORE: Latest buzz on five-star prospects still looking at others CLASS OF 2025 RANKINGS: Rivals250 | Team | Position | State CLASS OF 2026 RANKINGS: Rivals250 | Team | Position | State CLASS OF 2027 RANKINGS: Top 100 TRANSFER PORTAL: Full coverage | Player ranking | Team ranking | Transfer search | Transfer Tracker Not only is Indiana 10-0 for the first time in program history, it’s the first time the Hoosiers have won double-digit games dating back to the program’s inception in 1899. There are still two regular season games left against Ohio State and Purdue, and the Boilermakers are so bad that’s another virtual guaranteed win. First-year coach Curt Cignetti deserves all the credit in the world. The players deserve unbounded praise. What they’ve done in Bloomington has been surprising and incredible. But one wonders if all the Indiana exuberance is a little overblown? Outkick.com founder Clay Travis posed an interesting question on social media Tuesday when he asked: “Honest question, does anyone actually think Indiana, BYU, Miami or Notre Dame would beat Alabama, Ole Miss or Georgia on a neutral field? I don’t. These playoff rankings are a joke.” The rankings might not be a farce but the Hoosiers at No. 5 overall behind only Oregon, Ohio State, Texas and Penn State (another team that might be slightly inflated), does make some scratch their head. Sure, Indiana is undefeated and the Hoosiers deserve all that credit. But it also played only one team with a winning record this season and that’s Nebraska at 5-4. The Huskers have lost three straight, demoted their offensive coordinator and brought in Dana Holgorsen to call plays. Indiana’s wins – while almost all blowouts – are not against the best of the best. FIU, Western Illinois, UCLA, Charlotte, Maryland, Northwestern, Nebraska, Washington, Michigan State and a Michigan team that cannot throw the ball downfield have been beaten so far this season. Indiana beat the Wolverines by only five points. The combined record of Indiana’s opponents this season is 40-53. © Rich Janzaruk/Herald-Times / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images Are we to believe if Indiana lined up against one-loss Tennessee, Notre Dame or Miami that the Hoosiers would win? Are we to believe that if Indiana lined up against two-loss Alabama, Ole Miss or Georgia that the Hoosiers would win? Quarterback Kurtis Rourke is a transfer from Ohio. Leading rusher Justice Ellison came to the Hoosiers from Wake Forest. Leading receiver Elijah Sarratt was one of many players that followed Cignetti to Indiana from James Madison. Leading tackler Aiden Fisher is a JMU transplant as well. So is Mikail Kamara, who leads the Hoosiers with 9.5 sacks. No one is questioning Indiana’s right to be in the top 12 of the playoff rankings. Everyone appreciates what the Hoosiers have done on a historical basis this season. Last season, Indiana scored 266 points. This year already, the Hoosiers lead the Big Ten with 439 but they haven’t played Ohio State yet and missed Oregon, Penn State, Minnesota, Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin on the schedule. The progression in one year has been phenomenal. In 2023, Indiana went 3-9 and lost by 20 to Ohio State, needed four overtimes to beat Akron, lost by 27 to Maryland, lost by 45 to Michigan, lost by 17 to Rutgers and fell to rival Purdue. Indiana looks like a totally changed program this season. But the Hoosiers are still 9.5-point underdogs to Ohio State next weekend and that sounds about right. Even with a blowout loss to Ohio State, Indiana should still be comfortably in the playoff. But there are a lot of elite one-loss teams and numerous two-loss SEC teams that are licking their chops to prove they belong as well and Indiana has to go through them to win any hardware.

Running back Trevor Etienne was listed as out with a rib injury on the SEC's injury report after being listed as questionable throughout the week. Etienne, who transferred to Georgia after two seasons at Florida, is the Bulldogs' leading rusher with 477 yards and seven touchdowns, with an additional 140 receiving yards on 23 catches. He suffered the injury to his ribs in Week 10's 34-20 win over the Gators. Etienne attempted to play in last week's 28-10 loss to Ole Miss, but participated in only six snaps. Georgia's running back depth was already thin and Etienne's injury only makes the situation more dire. Freshman Nate Frazier is the team's second-leading rusher with 333 yards and three touchdowns on 75 carries. However, fellow freshmen Dwight Phillips Jr. and Chauncey Bowens have seven touches between them this season. Branson Robinson has missed three games with a knee injury, junior Cash Jones is listed as questionable on this week's injury report and Roderick Robinson II has not played this season due to turf toe. Etienne finds the end zone for his second TD. 📺 ABC#GoDawgs | @Trevor_Etienne pic.twitter.com/KTwhNQYmAo — Georgia Football (@GeorgiaFootball) October 20, 2024 As a result, Georgia is second to last among SEC teams in rushing with 1,117 total yards and yards per game (124.1), and 10th in the conference with 3.35 yards per carry. The lack of a consistent rushing attack has affected the performance of quarterback Carson Beck, who has thrown 12 interceptions this season — twice as many as he threw last year. At 5-2 in the SEC (7-2 overall), a loss would likely knock Georgia out of the College Football Playoff picture. Tennessee could arguably afford a defeat at 8-1 (5-1 in conference).

Waiting, patiently but restlessly, for a chance. He was once a teen phenom teeming with potential, and leading the line for the U.S. men's national team. Now, at age 21, after stumbling in Europe, he has not started consecutive games for club or country in nearly 18 months. And his patience is waning. ""I'm feeling ready to be the man, to be the starter,"" Pepi said Tuesday. And two days later, he played like it. Pepi spurred the USMNT to a scruffy 1-0 win over Jamaica in the first leg of a CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinal Thursday in Kingston. In the fifth minute, he deftly swiveled his hips, spun in behind the Jamaican defense, and finished off Christian Pulisic's through-ball. It was Pepi's eighth goal of the young season, and sixth in his last four starts. And those, he knows, are numbers he can wield to ward off a dangerous label:""Supersub."" Ever since moving to PSV Eindhoven in 2023, Pepi has developed that reputation. He's been stuck on the bench behind experienced strikers at the Dutch club, ""waiting to play 10, 15 minutes every weekend,"" as he said. And without weekly opportunities to prove his worth, he's been stuck in a similar situation, behind Folarin Balogun, with the USMNT. In those 10, 15 or 45 minutes, for club or country, he'd often score. But he still wouldn't start. ""It got a little frustrating,"" Pepi said this week. And he began to hear that word, subersub, whose connotations are mixed. ""Obviously people are noticing the things that I'm doing whenever I come in as a sub, and it makes them say the word,"" Pepi told ESPN. ""But at the same time, hearing that word, it makes me want to, I don't know, punch something."" On a videoconference call with reporters, he explained why: ""I'm at a point in my career right now where I'm ready. I'm ready to either start, to get more playing time. I feel like I've been showing that."" Slowly but surely, now, the playing time has been coming. Pepi has earned three starts for PSV over the past month and a half, more than he got all of last season. He poured in five goals in those three games. And with Balogun, Josh Sargent and Haji Wright all injured, Pepi parlayed those performances into a start for the national team. ""It's a great opportunity for him,"" U.S. head coach Mauricio Pochettino said Sunday. On Thursday, Pepi wasted no time taking it. His run, after a slight-but-effective feint, checking to the ball then sprinting in behind, was that of a confident striker. His shot was a bit scuffed, but it bounded past Jamaican goalkeeper Andre Blake, and in off the far post. From that point onward, the U.S. was occasionally shaky. Seven minutes later, a sloppy giveaway and defensive breakdown led to a Jamaica penalty — but Matt Turner leapt to his right, stretched, and saved the spot-kick. The U.S. squandered a few opportunities to double its lead. Jamaica, meanwhile, created twice as many. In the second half, at times, the Americans sat back and soaked up pressure. Mark McKenzie, who'd faltered in the buildup to the penalty, made multiple decisive interventions. Tim Ream blocked a goalbound shot with his shoulder. Balls squirmed just wide of the U.S. goal. Jamaican fans brought hands to their heads, in disbelief that they weren't celebrating an equalizer. Only a Jamaican red card, shown to Mason Holgate in the 86th minute, stemmed the tide and allowed the USMNT to settle. The 1-0 win was by no means emphatic or impressive. But it was more than sufficient. The two teams will now head to St. Louis for the second leg Monday. All the Americans will need is a draw to qualify for the Nations League semifinals in March. And that, after all, was the primary goal in November. For Pochettino, the 2026 World Cup is still the big picture and the end game. But in this camp, his second, the message was clear. ""Obviously it's easy to look ahead,"" Pulisic said Wednesday. ""The main objective right now is to beat Jamaica. That's truly the only thing on our minds."" After Thursday night, they are more than halfway there. “At the end of the day, we got the result,"" Pepi said in a postgame interview. ""And now it’s time to go take care of business at home.”",2024-11-15

He played a total of 43 games at outfield this season, while Duran played 160 with similar offensive stats. There was not, however, a debate about first-team DH.

He went ballistic toward guard Steph Curry after a bad turnover -- something many NBA coaches rarely do with star players. Steve Kerr wasn't happy with Steph Curry after this second-quarter turnover 😳 pic.twitter.com/SciAPNvNNQ — Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) November 7, 2024 But Curry took it in stride. After the game, he said he wants ""to be coached like everyone else,"" while Kerr praised his rare combination of superstardom and coachability. On Wednesday's episode of his podcast, teammate Draymond Green offered an interesting reaction to the fiery incident. ""When I saw it, I just go to Steph and reassure him like, 'Yeah, we're good. F--k that. Let's move on,' "" Green told co-host Baron Davis on ""The Draymond Green Show."" ""Just to make sure his head stays in the right place. ""People respond to things differently, and you never know what response you're going to get."" Though Green often acts as more of an instigator, this situation is one of the rarer instances when he's focused on playing peacemaker to get the most out of his team. ""When you are one of the top dogs on the team, the job goes far beyond just going out there and playing a good basketball game. There are so many more things that you have to deal with when you're going through this stuff. So I'm immediately watching that and I see it, and I'm watching Steph's reaction and how he responds to it. ... ""If he responds negatively, I've already told myself I need to go talk to Coach and make sure Coach understands the reaction, to make sure Coach understands Steph ain't respond great to you yelling at him like that. Let's just keep an eye on that. So that's already my mindset because, again, you have to keep an eye on all of these things. You have to know what makes your guys tick and what makes them not. ""So I'm watching that like a hawk. In turn, I'm then watching the postgame press conferences. And Steph is like, 'No, I want to be coached like everyone else.' That statement lines up with the way you continued to play after you and Steve had your moment. ""So, cool, I wash my hands, and I'm on to the next thing."" Green continued by emphasizing the importance of those seemingly insignificant interactions because they still can lead to bigger problems down the road for a team with championship aspirations. This explanation offers an incredibly intriguing look into the mind of Green's emotional intelligence, although that may not be how many NBA fans would characterize him. Nevertheless, it's a credit to how Green became a pillar of the Warriors' dynasty over the last decade. Download and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast",2024-11-14

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Mets' top 5 offseason questions include can they woo Juan Soto and how big will they spend overall?,https://sports.yahoo.com/mets-top-5-offseason-questions-include-can-they-woo-juan-soto-and-how-big-will-they-spend-overall-225830047.html,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 22:58:30 GMT","If the Mets reel in the big fish, they’ll operate somewhat more judiciously to fill out the roster. If the Mets miss out on Soto, their pivot could be a windfall for other highly touted free agents.","The 2024 New York Mets were a whirlwind, an exhausting, exhilarating thrill ride of improbability. They were a ragtag group of well-paid misfits, with the magic of an anthropomorphic purple blob and a Latin pop earworm. The Mets rode the good vibes all the way to the NLCS. An MVP runner-up campaign from shortstop Francisco Lindor helped too. Here are the five main questions that will shape what’s sure to be a fascinating and active winter in Queens. Mets owner Steve Cohen is, according to Forbes, the 39th richest person in America. Since buying the Mets in 2020 for $2.4 billion, Cohen has infused a fortune into his new toy. Once a circus of frugality, the Mets organization has refurbished its reputation and is now firmly considered as one of the financial behemoths of the sport. Last offseason, the club’s first under new president of baseball operations David Stearns, the Mets focused on depth by signing a bevy of players to one-year deals. Those shrewd acquisitions helped propel the 2024 OMG Mets into the annals of New York sports history and set the Mets back on a winning path. But with so many key contributors reaching free agency, the Mets could look drastically different next season. And different could mean better considering the Mets have the financial flexibility to be extremely active. The current projected payroll comes in approximately $170 million lower than the 2024 end-of-year $336 million mark. But how high will it go? Stearns, who cut his teeth running the thrifty Milwaukee Brewers, has a track-record of operating conservatively. Cohen, on the other hand, is the anti-Scrooge. Considering how high payroll has gone before, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the Mets commit a good deal of money to free agents this winter. We know Juan Soto is going to command a contract for at least $550 million dollars, a figure that Cohen and Co. can certainly afford. Anything the Yankees offer, Cohen could theoretically reach into his endless hedge fund riches and outbid his crosstown rivals. Soto’s agent, Scott Boras, will be counting on this exact dynamic to drive up the price. And so, the Mets’ run at Soto will come down to three dynamics: Did Soto’s one year in the Bronx do enough to convince him to take less money (though still a lot of money) to be a Yankee? How high are the Yankees willing to go? Can the Mets convince Soto that Queens is the better fit for him? How the Soto sweepstakes plays out will dictate the rest of the Mets' offseason. If they reel in the big fish, they’ll operate somewhat more judiciously to fill out the roster. If the Mets miss out on Soto, their pivot could be a windfall for other highly touted free agents. Nobody has ripped more homers at Citi Field than Alonso, who delivered an underwhelming season in his final year under contract. Still, the jolly basher still clubbed 34 long balls in 2024, while finishing the year with a batting line 23% above league average. It’s also important to consider what he means to the franchise; Alonso started 86% of games at first base for the team since his debut in 2019 and is currently just 32 home runs behind the all-time Mets record of 252 held by Darryl Strawberry. By (1) staying in Queens and (2) delivering another few productive seasons would make Alonso a franchise icon. Yet, there are ample reasons to be wary of Alonso’s profile. He’s a relatively unathletic right-handed hitting first baseman on the wrong side of 30 years old who isn’t a great defender. Sluggers of that sort don’t often age well. The “smart” move would be to let Alonso walk, move 2024 breakout Mark Vientos from third (where he’s a subpar glove) to first (where he’d be fine) and find a new third baseman. That tact is far from a given and there aren’t many other players available who can offer such bankable home run power. The Mets can sign Soto and Alonso, but will they want to? Both players, as they age, would require at-bats at DH. Having two one-dimensional sluggers on the same roster could create a logjam. On the other hand, the two would form a formidable righty-lefty combo in the middle of the lineup for a long time. Will the Mets' offer end up being Alonso’s highest bid? Probably not. His free agency could come down to (1) the gap between the Mets and the next best offer and (2) whether Alonso would choose continuity over cash. The rotation was essential to New York’s surprise season, but three-fifths of that group — Sean Manaea, Luis Severino and José Quintana — are on the open market this winter. That leaves behind Japanese fork-baller Kodai Senga, who was injured for almost all of 2024, and left-hander David Peterson. Those two, if healthy, have starting spots locked down. Tylor Megill and Paul Blackburn could be in the mix, but both are best deployed as depth options. That means the Mets need to add at least two starters, but probably three. Stearns was surprisingly open about this dynamic, telling reporters at his end-of-year news conference that, “We’re going to have to add starting pitching. We’re going to have to add multiple starters. We understand that. We went into last offseason with the same need and I think we’ll be able to do it.” There’s no doubt that the Mets could use a no-doubt ace at the front of their rotation. Only three or four free-agent hurlers fit that bill: Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell, Max Fried and Roki Sasaki, with Burnes being the most reliable option. Snell has two Cy Youngs to his name, but durability concerns. Fried has a stellar track record of run prevention, but pairs best with a strong infield defense. Sasaki might have a higher ceiling than anybody on Earth, but can’t be relied upon to lead a staff right away coming from Japan. Expect the Mets, with or without Soto, to be heavy on this quartet. Beyond that, a Severino return feels the most likely, as sources indicated to Yahoo Sports that the hurler is extremely interested in a reunion. As Stearns mentioned, the Mets cobbled together quite an impressive rotation through free agency last year and they can be counted on to do so again. In the team’s four NLCS losses, the Mets surrendered nine, eight, 10 and 10 runs to the eventual World Series champions. The bullpen, in particular, was stretched thin all October long. Skipper Carlos Mendoza leaned heavily on the two or three arms he trusted — Edwin Díaz, Ryne Stanek, Reed Garrett — because he didn’t have much else. That wasn’t an issue in shorter series during the wild-card round and the NLDS, but in a seven-game set against the Dodgers, the Mets got exposed. The Mets need more relievers and better ones, hurlers they can trust in huge postseason spots. It’s unlikely they shop at the high end of the bullpen market considering they already have a big-money guy back there in Díaz. But expect Stearns to add a handful of relievers on shorter-term deals, particularly those with experience in big games. Kirby Yates, Blake Treinen and Jeff Hoffman all fit the bill.",2024-11-14

Dave Sims has agreed to become the team's new play-by-play broadcaster on WFAN, the Yankees announced on Thursday Sims, 71, has called games on the Seattle Mariners' TV broadcasts for the past 17 seasons. He replaces John Sterling, who retired from the radio booth early last season after 35 years due to health concerns, but returned during the Yankees' playoff run. Sims will partner with Suzyn Waldman on the radio broadcasts. Last season, Justin Shackil called most of the Yankees games on radio with Waldman while Emmanuel Berbari was also part of the mix. Rickie Ricardo, who calls the Yankees' Spanish language broadcasts, was also reportedly under consideration. For Sims, calling the Yankees is a return to New York, where he began his media career as a reporter for the New York Daily News. He then moved to radio as the host of WNBC's ""SportsNight"" and eventually co-hosted the WFAN midday show with Ed Coleman. Additionally, he was a weekend sports anchor at WCBS and a host for the New York Knicks' radio broadcasts.

Sims began calling baseball telecasts for ESPN before joining Root Sports' Mariners broadcast team in 2007. He is one of 10 finalists (along with Sterling) for the 2025 Ford C. Frick Award, presented by the Baseball Hall of Fame for excellence in baseball broadcasting. In 2012, Sims called two perfect games — first by Philip Humber, then Félix Hernández — and one Mariners' run to the postseason in 2022.

It was an understandable point of pride for the team and the National Women’s Soccer League as a whole. Yet what NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman noticed most during Sunday’s quarterfinal match (Gotham 2, Portland 1) wasn’t so much the quantity of supporters as the quality of the support. Waving flags. Homemade signs. Most importantly, fans that hung (and screamed) on every play, every call, every goal. This was a scene. This was intense. “It felt specific to the game,” Berman told Yahoo Sports this week. “It was very much focused on the action.” This, Berman felt, wasn’t about people coming out to just support women’s soccer, or just to bring their daughter to see some role models after a youth clinic, not that there's anything wrong with that. It was about Gotham winning a game and advancing to the playoffs — they’ll travel on Saturday for a semifinal match-up with Washington, which on Sunday also played in a similar rowdy, raucous environment (sold out crowd of 19,215). “It was the fan base really appreciating the game itself,” Berman said. Professional women’s soccer in America dates back almost a quarter century with the Women’s United Soccer Association (2001-03) and Women’s Professional Soccer (2009-2012). The 11-year old NWSL is the third iteration, but in many ways 2024 felt like a fresh start. There is the new television package designed for access — games on CBS, ABC, ESPN, Amazon and Ion. There is the arrival of a breathtaking talent in Kansas City’s Temwa Chawinga, whose record 20 goals was as many as the entire Houston team this year. There is momentum from the U.S. women’s national team capturing Olympic gold in Paris behind a slew of young new stars such as Trinity Rodman (Washington) and Sophia Smith (Portland). Berman calls it the “force multiplier” of taking long-term, hard core fans and more casual families and turning them into something that resembles European football — passions and traditions and pride. This is more than a movement. It is a sport. And America can finally see it. Throughout its fledgling existence, women's professional soccer has struggled for television partners. In 2023, not a single NWSL quarterfinal was on network TV. This year saw three, plus a Friday night Orlando victory on Amazon. “We’ve gone from hidden to visible,” Berman said. This weekend, Gotham will play Washington (which sold out again in just 72 hours) on Saturday at noon on CBS. On Sunday, KC visits Orlando at 3 p.m. on ABC. The championship game will be Nov. 23 at 8 p.m. on CBS. The ratings won’t overwhelm anyone — if they hit 500,000 this weekend, the league should be happy. The goal is growth and that starts with exposure. League-wide average attendance hit 11,235 this season, up from just 7,894 in 2022, per Sportico. On television, NWSL is taking the opposite approach of Major League Soccer, where the vast majority of games, including the playoffs, are part of a pay package on Apple TV. MLS is vastly more popular and profitable than the NWSL. The $250 million Apple deal pays the bills and serves the established audience well. However, the league has had two years to showcase arguably the world’s most popular athlete (Lionel Messi) and hasn't reached that many curious or casual fans. There’s a trade off. The NWSL doesn’t have Messi. It does have a slew of USWNT stars though — Rodman of Washington and Rose LaVelle of Gotham, for example. It also has some of the most exciting international players, including Chawinga, of Malawi, and the league’s second leading scorer, Barbra Banda of Orlando via Zambia. “She’s incredible,” Berman said of Chawinga, whose speed doesn’t merely translate into goals, but highlight-reel goals. “Stars help grow leagues. You root for players. Then you root for teams.” For the NWSL, the hope is that more fans tune in when Chawinga and Banda play and maybe get hooked either by the players or the action or the atmosphere. They are already planning an aggressive marketing campaign to introduce the best players to as many people as possible. You can’t create a Caitlin Clark, but you can nudge along with what you have. If nothing else, it seems to have finally found a critical mass of fans to come who are desperate to help their team win, not just because it's a deserving cause or an affordable family excursion. There is a real product to sell here, and finally a real media strategy to sell it.",2024-11-14

If there's anyone who knows how to win a championship, or two, or three, or four, it's Draymond Green and the Warriors. If there's one player, and team, who does not, it's Fred Warner and the 49ers. While that might hurt the 49ers Faithful to hear, it's true, and could be a reason as to why San Francisco has come up short in recent Super Bowl appearances. Green joined Warner on the latest episode of his podcast, ""The Warner House,"" where he discussed the advantage that comes with knowing how to win a championship, how that benefited the Warriors in their 2022 NBA Finals series victory over the Boston Celtics and why that might have benefited the Kansas City Chiefs in their recent Super Bowl victory over San Francisco. ""I think what people don't realize is, and I think you will even learn this, is once you do it, you know how,"" Green told Warner. ""And once you know how to do it ... we won a championship in 2022, not because we were the best team. We won the championship in 2022 because we knew how. Like Steph [Curry], Klay [Thompson] and I knew how to win, and so we knew how to win a championship. Boston didn't know how to win a championship. ""And so when it came down to it, one of the things that the Chiefs have over y'all, and it's a hump y'all will have to get over, is they know how to do it. So in every single moment, they have something to draw from to say, 'Oh, this is like this, and we did this.' Or 'The mindset now has to be that.' Or 'if we can attack this guy, he'd be attacking that guy when we did this.' "" One example of Green and the Warriors' championship pedigree benefiting them, was when Golden State trailed in its series against Boston two-plus years ago, and how they used their previous playoff experience to re-shift their focus mid-series and close out Boston in six games. ""Speaking of 2022, sure enough, 2022, after Game 3 we were down 2-1 and I walk into the locker room, and I'm walking off the court thinking to myself 'This feels so familiar' and I literally walk into the locker room and [Steph's] the first person I see,"" Green recalled. ""And I just see he's got this look on his face like ... I stop, and I'm standing there looking at him ... and he says, 'You thinking what I'm thinking?' I said, 'This is [the Warriors vs. Grizzlies Western Conference semifinal series] all over again, because in 2015 we were down to Memphis 2-1, and it felt like the world was collapsing, and we had never done it though. ""So I say 'This feels like Memphis' and he's like 'Yes! That's exactly what it feels like …' he's like 'Cool, all right, it's over.' I'm like, 'Yes, it's over. For sure.' ... I get to Klay (in the locker room in 2022) and Klay's like 'Dray, this feels really 2015ish.' I'm like 'Absolutely.' I knew right away it's over, they done, we won."" And sure enough, the Warriors won. Green's long-winded point, essentially, is that some teams just know how to win a championship and the mid-game or mid-series adjustments required to put them over the top. That's not to say Warner and the 49ers will not hoist the Vince Lombardi Trophy one day, but once -- or if -- they do, Green believes it becomes much, much easier to do so again. ""And so I said all of that to say there's a know-how once you do it, and Steve Kerr knows how,"" Green explained. ""And so he knows when to press the button, he knows when to make the adjustment, he knows when to do the thing. Because he knows how to do it and once you do it, it's just a feeling that you get of 'Oh, that's that? boom, no problem, we got this, we know to do that now.' ""And once y'all do it, because I think y'all will, but I'll tell you this, you've got to do it fast man, because you can't keep missing the window. You've got this window, and you've got to kick that motherf---er in, because if you don't kick the window in, it slams shut. I think y'all can do it and I think y'all will do it, but y'all gotta kick the window in and once you do it once, it's way more likely for you to do it twice than for you to do it once. It's way more likely."" The Chiefs, much to the 49ers' chagrin, have been there before. Not once, not twice, but now three times. Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes, coach Andy Reid, tight end Travis Kelce and other veterans on the roster likely will agree with Green's overarching sentiment. It's an advantage that Warner and the 49ers would like to experience sooner rather than later. Download and follow the 49ers Talk Podcast",2024-11-14

But almost no one expected whose reckoning it would be. Tennessee travels to Athens this weekend to challenge the University of Georgia in one of only two games matching ranked teams. (The other is No. 23 Missouri at No. 21 South Carolina. Knock yourselves out, y’all.) It’s not a surprise that both the Vols and Dawgs are coming into the weekend highly ranked. It is, however, a surprise at where they sit. One-loss Tennessee arrives in Athens with a clear path to the SEC championship and a first-round CFP bye. Head coach Josh Heupel and quarterback Nico Iamaleava have at last delivered a team worthy of the hue and cry of Neyland Stadium, and they’ve got the bones of Alabama buried in the checkerboard turf to prove it. Two-loss Georgia, on the other hand, suddenly finds itself outside of the current (meaningless) playoff bracket and very much on the verge of missing the entire 12-team playoff. It’s quite the fall for the 2021-22 national champions, who had fully expected the Kirby Smart juggernaut to deliver title after title in the post-Nick Saban era. And, of course, that could still happen. But it’s a whole lot harder for Georgia now, meaning it’s a whole lot harder for everybody. The transfer portal, NIL riches (which can have both positive and negative effects) and the absolute necessity of staying locked-in, every Saturday of every fall have all led to this: another Game of the Year in a season already full of them. Heupel, like all SEC coaches in the 21st century, knows exactly how to craft the proper respectful-while-saying-nothing statement on his upcoming opponent. “Extremely talented, coached extremely well,"" he said earlier this week. ""They play hard. They play fundamentally sound. They make you earn it in every way, and one that will be a great, great environment ... ” You get the idea. Nobody puts motivational material on bulletin boards any more; social media handles that job just fine. Heupel understands how not to end up on an Instagram image with “We’re gonna kennel the Dawgs” or some other inflammatory line emblazoned in front of him. It’s wise strategy, even if it doesn’t make for thrilling content. Smart, on the other hand, did a fine job of creating some social media heat this week, although he trained it on his own team rather than Tennessee. He called one of his own players an “idiot” for celebrating with Ole Miss (technically, with his friends wearing Ole Miss gear), then walked that back. The big question for Tennessee is the health of Iamaleava. The Knoxville News reported this week that the electric quarterback is in concussion protocol, although no official announcement has been made. Heupel proclaimed Iamaleava in “great shape” on Monday, but a Wednesday report listed him as “questionable.” Iamaleava’s availability is likely the key reason behind oddsmakers’ 10-point-and-increasing line that’s favoring Georgia right now. On the other side of the ball, Georgia faces significant questions about its identity. Which Bulldog squad will show up Saturday? The fearsome crew that eviscerated Texas and Clemson on the road and rallied from down 28-0 against Alabama? Or the tentative, directionless gang that struggled against Kentucky and looked lost against Ole Miss? Will Carson Beck look like the Heisman hopeful of his early season, or the interception provider of recent weeks? Beck’s 12 interceptions lead the SEC, and each one is a dagger in the Dawgs’ fading hopes of dominating the conference again. So what’s at stake here? It’s tough to divine the CFP committee’s exact motives, but losses — regardless of opponent — will weigh heavily in their calculations. That’s bad news for Georgia, which can’t afford another L on the record and expect to make the playoff field. (Is a three-loss Georgia better than a two-loss program from another conference? Probably, but you are what your record says you are.) For Tennessee, a defeat drops the Vols into the bubbling cauldron of two-loss SEC teams. Momentum and a current high ranking ought to be enough to carry Tennessee into the playoffs, and probably a hosting slot — assuming Tennessee wins out, of course, with Vanderbilt lurking. But a victory would almost certainly result in an SEC championship berth against the winner of Texas-Texas A&M — again, assuming that favorites win out. So that’s what we’re looking at this weekend: A chance for one program to level up, a chance for the other to hold off the darkness. It’s exactly what we want out of a late-season college football game. How about that? The playoffs didn’t ruin the regular season after all.",2024-11-14

Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Fantasy Football Week 11 Fades: Can you trust Najee Harris?,https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy-football-week-11-fades-can-you-trust-najee-harris-175054452.html,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 17:50:54 GMT",Beware of these six players with fantasy football bust potential in Week 11!,"Another week, another round of crucially important start/sit decisions. To help you make them, here's a look at six players with bust potential in Week 11. Something to keep in mind as you're reading: a ""fade"" or ""bust"" designation doesn't automatically mean you should sit a player, depending on the depth of the rest of your roster or available options on your waiver wire. Kirk Cousins has had a solid bounce-back season coming off a ruptured Achilles that ended his 2023 campaign. Through 10 weeks, he ranks as fantasy's QB10, ranked third in passing yards (2,634) and tied for the fourth-most passing touchdowns (17) — a great fit so far with WRs Drake London and Darnell Mooney, TE Kyle Pitts and RB Bijan Robinson in the passing game. But his opponent this week, the Broncos, are tied for the third-lowest EPA per pass attempt (-0.21) while ranking fourth in the league with a 39.2% pressure rate and the second-highest sack total in the league (35), only behind the New York Giants. Per PFF, Cousins has had the sixth-highest turnover-worthy play rate among QBs with 25+ pressured dropbacks this season at 7.3%, throwing for 5 TDs and 7 INTs on such plays. Heat check 🔥 Kirk Cousins belongs on most fantasy benches this week outside of two-QB and Superflex leagues. The Pittsburgh Steelers' run game has come alive in recent weeks after a relatively slow start this season, thanks in a big way to RB Najee Harris heating up down the stretch (as is typical for him historically). Unfortunately, there are some reasons to pump the breaks on Harris' upside for fantasy heading into Week 11. Just last week, he snapped a three-game streak of 100+ rushing yards in Week 10 (the first such streak of his career) against a Commanders defense that has been fairly friendly toward the run, averaging just 2.5 yards per attempt on 21 carries. This week, Harris face a challenging matchup against the Baltimore Ravens — one of the league's top rushing defenses through 10 weeks of the season. The Ravens are allowing a league-low 3.4 rush yards per play, allowing the fewest runs of 10+ yards, giving up the fewest yards after contact per attempt (2.21) while allowing the third-lowest EPA per rush attempt -0.18. Heat check 🔥 Consider Harris more of a boom/bust, touchdown-dependent fantasy asset this week than a must-start. If Warren is active (currently questionable with a back injury), he warrants consideration as a flex option, especially in full-PPR scoring formats as long as he is active. It is challenging to envision fading a running back that has had 20 or more touches over three of his past five games and scored in all but three outings so far in 2024. However, with a matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 11, fantasy football managers should be bracing themselves for a boom/bust performance that falls outside of Cook's typically safe floor. In Week 11, the Bills will host the Kansas City Chiefs, who have been right alongside the Ravens in terms of their ability to shut down the run this season. They are giving up a league-low 12.01 fantasy points per game to opposing RBs. They're the only defense to have given up fewer than 500 rushing yards to opposing backs, allowing the fourth-lowest EPA per rush attempt (-0.16) and the second-lowest yards per play average (3.7). Up against a similarly skilled rushing defense in the Baltimore Ravens in Week 4, the Bills were wildly outpaced, leaving Cook with just 48 yards on 10 total touches (0 TDs) for an RB44 finish on the day. Heat check 🔥 Start Cook as the top running back in a highly potent Bills offense that could see plenty of scoring, but be wary that this could be an inefficient spot that could render him a rather volatile asset this week. I didn't have to reach very far for this Week 11 fade, but it felt necessary to say just this once — you are not obligated to start DJ Moore (or any other Bears receiver, for that matter) until this team finds some sort of identity. The team has officially moved on from former OC Shane Waldron, but it will likely take more than a new play-caller to undo the damage that has been done and the regression the offense has seen since coming out of their bye week. Moore is a good wide receiver who many will feel implored to start due to his name value, but he has failed to clear more than 33 receiving yards in each of his last four games, finishing outside of the top 50 at his position in each of those games. His floor is simply too low to be trusted in even the most dire of situations. This week, the Bears will host the Green Bay Packers — a unit that ranks top-10 in average time to pressure and has been one of the most productive defenses in terms of forcing turnovers (18 total on the year). This could be another ugly one for the entire Bears offense, outside of RB D'Andre Swift. Heat check 🔥 Do. Not. Start. I'm begging you. Atlanta Falcons WR Drake London has thrived with new QB Kirk Cousins, scoring as the overall WR4 in fantasy through the first 10 weeks of the season, having totaled the fifth-most receptions (58) and eighth-most receiving yards (649) while ranking third in the position in total touchdowns. That all sounds fine and dandy until you put it up against the vaunted Denver Broncos defense, however. The biggest problem on that defense for London? All-Pro cornerback, Patrick Surtain II. Here's a look at some of Surtain II's advanced stats in coverage and where that ranks among CBs to play at least 200 coverage snaps this season: 10% target rate in coverage (second-lowest) 0.6 yards per snap allowed (tied-fewest) -0.68 EPA per target (lowest) 57.5 NFL passer rating when targeted (fourth-lowest) Simply put, Surtain isn't targeted often in coverage because he's so efficient when opposing QBs try to make it happen. WRs DK Metcalf, George Pickens, Mike Evans and Garrett Wilson managed just 15.6 fantasy points combined against this defense — in big part, thanks to Surtain's ability to lockdown perimeter receivers. Heat check 🔥 London isn't a must-start in Week 11 if you have better options, though most rosters probably don't have the luxury to sit him. Though Zay Flowers found some success against this defense in Week 10, most of that production came out of the slot, having played a season-low 47.1% of snaps on the perimeter in that game. If London does primarily work along the outside, he's likely in line for a quiet afternoon. There aren't many tight ends you can afford to fade on any given week, but given the current state of Jacksonville's offense, a warning about a potential decrease in production for Evan Engram seems warranted. They'll be without starting quarterback Trevor Lawrence again this week — he's dealing with a shoulder injury — which means it's Mac Jones at the helm once again going up against the Detroit Lions. The Lions are allowing the ninth-lowest EPA per dropback on slot + inline targets, giving up plenty of yardage in coverage of these areas of the field but little scoring (4 TD, 6 INT) in such coverage, resulting in the second-fewest fantasy points per game given up to opposing tight ends. They've allowed just one touchdown to the position all season, which doesn't bode well for a passing offense that didn't manage a single passing touchdown just last week, as Jones totaled just 139 passing yards on 22 attempts while also throwing two interceptions. Heat check 🔥 Given Engram's role in the offense as a primary slot target when Christian Kirk is out, you'll be hard-pressed to find many options you'd prefer over Engram in this economy. However, it could be a bumpy outing if Engram doesn't see significant volume.",2024-11-14

As we get closer to the end of the fantasy season, we think we know the majority of players and what to expect from them moving forward. However, it’s not always as clear-cut as you’d think and matchups aren’t the only issue. Sometimes we have to adjust our expectations of players and offenses moving forward to truly understand the potential, or lack thereof, with players. I don’t often include quarterbacks, but Bo Nix was in the make-or-break column last week. I highlighted his potential upside in a surprisingly favorable matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs, and he delivered as the QB12 on the week. This week, I want to discuss Maye with a similar thought process — that Maye can still thrive even in a less-than-ideal matchup. When Maye took over as the official starter in Week 6, it was messy but highly productive from a fantasy perspective. He finished as QB8 against Houston and QB7 against Jacksonville. Since then, Maye has gone through rookie woes. To be fair, these struggles have come against very formidable pass defenses, including the New York Jets, Tennessee Titans and Chicago Bears, with the Jets matchup being the week he missed most of the game due to injury. All things considered, Maye has been solid. While his passing has been inconsistent, his rushing ability has provided a reliable floor. This week, he faces a promising matchup against the L.A. Rams. The Rams’ defense is vulnerable, particularly their secondary, but their pass rush has improved as the season has progressed. The Rams have bet big on young talent, and while it took them time to acclimate to the NFL and find their groove, they’ve now become a more aggressive pass-rushing unit. A young, aggressive rush against a shaky offensive line can spell trouble, and Maye may not have the time he needs to exploit the secondary fully. That said, if Maye is forced to bail out of the pocket, it bodes well for his rushing upside. While the Rams’ defensive line could make this a tough matchup, Maye still offers strong upside as a streaming option, especially for fantasy teams that need to take a risk and pull out a win. I do live Q&A on Yahoo’s social channels every week and on my Tuesday live this week, I got a very timely question: when is Nick Chubb going to be Nick Chubb? Fantasy managers welcomed Chubb back in Week 7 with open arms. Reminiscing on the good old days, we always knew what to expect with Nick Chubb: a hefty workload, high yardage, strong yards per carry and touchdowns. While expectations were tempered coming off a significant injury, Chubb’s return has been fruitless from a fantasy perspective. Part of this can be attributed to the overall struggles of the Cleveland offense, but the numbers tell a clear story: Chubb has yet to exceed 52 rushing yards, has just one touchdown, averages 2.69 yards per carry and has no receiving upside. He’s failed to reach double-digit fantasy points in half-PPR. In all fairness, his last two matchups were against Baltimore and the L.A. Chargers. The Chargers have consistently been stout against the run and the Ravens have shut down running backs all season. In fact, Chubb’s 52 yards were the most by any back against the Ravens this season. Despite these challenges, fantasy managers remain optimistic that, in the perfect matchup, Chubb can return to form. This week offers strong potential. While his snap count hasn’t been particularly high, Chubb has dominated touches out of the backfield. The opportunity is there; it’s just a question of whether he can capitalize on it in an excellent matchup. This week, he faces a Saints defense that has been lit up by running backs this season, allowing the third-most fantasy points to the position. It’s also critical to note that it hasn’t taken top-tier talent to boost those points. Sean Tucker’s one-week-wonder and Javonte Williams' sole RB1 performance both came against New Orleans. This is the perfect matchup for Chubb to deliver his breakout performance of the season. The tides are turning in Denver, and they’re definitely not turning in favor of the aforementioned Javonte Williams. The Broncos didn’t hide their intentions when discussing Estimé recently, saying his workload would increase as the season progressed. Most expected a gradual ramp-up, but Sean Payton surprised everyone by completely flipping the Denver backfield in Week 10. Estimé had 14 carries for 53 yards, while Williams had just one carry for one yard and Jaleel McLaughlin had four carries for 12 yards. Estimé’s snap count wasn’t significantly high, but he did out-snap Williams. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Estimé wasn’t targeted in the passing game, while Williams appeared to be the preferred option with two receptions on two targets. Though it’s not much, it’s something to monitor since Estimé would need some receiving upside to be a reliable RB2. There’s a positive sign, though — Estimé did run a similar number of routes to Williams, so we might see his game evolve as the season progresses. This week’s matchup is risky. The Falcons allow volume to running backs, but rushing touchdowns have been rare — only Kenneth Walker III and Alvin Kamara have scored rushing touchdowns against them. While Estimé might see good volume, without touchdown potential and with limited receiving upside, he’s an extremely risky play. There’s also the question of whether or not we can actually trust Sean Payton. This wouldn’t be the first time a running back saw a sudden spike in carries only for Payton to switch things up the following week. I trust that Estimé has a real chance to retain the lead role, but I feel we need one more week before we can truly rely on anyone in the Broncos’ run game. Gus Edwards is back and fantasy managers now face a difficult situation with the Chargers’ backfield. In Weeks 6 through 9, while Edwards was on IR, Dobbins was the clear lead back. During that stretch, Dobbins ranked as the RB13 in half-PPR, averaging 15.9 fantasy points per game with two top-12 finishes. Edwards’ return has significantly cut into Dobbins’ volume. He had just 15 carries for 50 yards and three receptions for five yards, compared to Edwards’ 10 carries for 55 yards. While his performance was underwhelming from a fantasy perspective, Dobbins still has the edge in this backfield and should continue to see the bulk of carries. Edwards doesn’t contribute to the passing game, and when both are healthy, Dobbins has seen goal-line opportunities, so there’s no reason to expect Dobbins will be removed from the backfield when the Chargers are near the end zone. While Dobbins’ volume is at risk, the Chargers have a favorable matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals, with an expected point total of 47.5. This matchup should favor Dobbins, but with Edwards back, Dobbins has entered make-or-break territory. Still, his receiving upside and the advantageous Week 11 matchup lean slightly in his favor. I discussed DJ Moore in my Sunday Pulse Check article, so it should come as no surprise that he’s firmly a make-or-break player — emphasis on the break. Let’s not bury the lead here: Chicago’s pass catchers are unreliable across the board. We gave the Chicago offense the benefit of the doubt, lulled into optimism before their bye week when they faced favorable matchups that allowed Caleb Williams to thrive. Reality has set in again, and over the past three weeks, Moore hasn’t exceeded five fantasy points in half-PPR formats, with his best finish at WR55. We’re in a dire situation with Moore; his target share has been underwhelming and inconsistent as Rome Odunze continues to emerge in Chicago’s receiving corps. When each receiver is getting a fairly even share of the targets, this offense is unlikely to be productive from a fantasy perspective. Positive changes might be coming, as the Bears have rightly fired Shane Waldron. But can firing Waldron truly resolve the offensive issues? It seems highly unlikely. While Waldron’s vision was flawed, the Chicago offensive line continues to struggle, limiting Williams’ effectiveness. At this point, Moore is a boom-bust player, and the “boom” seems like a rare occurrence. This week he faces a Packers defense that has been a turnover machine and relatively strong against the pass. Moore is a very risky start this week and moving forward.",2024-11-14

Steinbrenner Field, which seats 11,000, is the spring training home of the New York Yankees and the team's Class-A affiliate, the Tampa Tarpons. The Tarpons will use other fields at the spring training complex for their home games. The team reportedly chose Steinbrenner Field over the Philadelphia Phillies' spring training stadium in Clearwater after consulting with Major League Baseball. The Yankees will receive about $15 million in revenue as part of the agreement. “It is singularly the best opportunity for our fans to experience 81 games of major league Rays baseball,” Rays principal owner Stuart Sternberg told The Associated Press. “As difficult as it is to get any of these stadiums up to major league standards, it was the least difficult. You’re going to see Major League Baseball in a small environment.” The Rays needed a home for the 2025 season after a survey of Tropicana Field post-Hurricane Milton found that while the stadium remained structurally sound, the cost of repairs would total $55.7 million and would not be completed until after the upcoming season. ""This outcome meets Major League Baseball’s goals that Rays’ fans will see their team play next season in their home market and that their players can remain home without disruption to their families,"" MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. The main damage to Tropicana Field, which opened in 1990, was to the fabric roof panels, which were essentially ripped off when the storm made landfall. Eighteen of the 24 panels failed due to Hurricane Milton's high winds, and the failure of the roof allowed the rain and wind to cause more damage inside the stadium. Prior to the full damage assessment of the stadium, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said he preferred to keep the Rays in Tampa with an interim home or if full repairs of Tropicana Field were possible before the 2025 season got underway. “The one thing I can tell you for sure, they’re playing next year. We’re going to find them someplace to do it,"" Manfred said in October on The Varsity podcast. As it is used year-round by the Yankees organization, Steinbrenner Field houses state-of-the-art facilities, amenities and equipment for players and would not need many upgrades to meet MLBPA standards. The stadium is also open air, not a dome like Tropicana Field, which means it is susceptible to rainouts as well as hot temperatures in the summer.",2024-11-14

It's hard as one of the elite teams to play at a top level for four straight months. Maybe that's a reason underdogs did well in Week 10. It was an odd week: Through Sunday's early window of games, underdogs were 7-2 against the spread on the week. Then, in the late window, favorites went 3-0. But it flipped back around and underdogs covered on Sunday night and Monday night. Overall it was a 9-5 week for underdogs. We'll see if that trend continues in Week 11. Here's a look at Week 11 of the NFL season from a betting perspective, with all odds from BetMGM: When this matchup was made for Thursday night in Week 11, it seemed the best-case scenario was we'd get to see a Rookie of the Year candidate against a really good NFC East favorite and maybe Jayden Daniels would help the Washington Commanders keep it close. Instead, it's one of the top matchups of a stacked Week 11. The Commanders have already hit the over on their season win total of 6.5, starting 7-3. Daniels isn't just the overwhelming Offensive Rookie of the Year favorite, he's one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL. They lost last week but are still contenders to win the division. The Philadelphia Eagles are quietly coming on, winning all five games since their bye, and Thursday night's line reflects that the betting market still doesn't think the Commanders are quite on the Eagles' level. The Eagles are 3.5-point favorites and the line is creeping toward Eagles -4. The Eagles are probably the better team and the action on Philadelphia is justified, though Washington has already proven just about everyone wrong this season. Baltimore Ravens vs. Pittsburgh Steelers has produced some great games through the years. Nobody figured that this first meeting would be for first place of the AFC North. The Ravens being 7-3 is no surprise, but the Steelers' 7-2 record is unexpected. They have played well all season, and the offense got better when Russell Wilson took over as the team's starting quarterback. But there's skepticism about them. That's a reason the Steelers are 3-point underdogs at home against the Ravens and MVP favorite Lamar Jackson. Even more surprising, the Ravens are a -300 favorite to win the division. That's surprising given that it's mid-November and the Steelers lead by a half-game. Those odds will change if the Steelers win this one at home. Last week, we saw the New Orleans Saints get that first-week bounce with a new coach, winning with interim coach Darren Rizzi. Does the same thing apply to new offensive coordinators? It seems the Bears were ready for offensive coordinator Shane Waldron to go. His schemes were bad for Caleb Williams and the Bears' offense was awful. Thomas Brown steps in, and it can't be much worse. The Green Bay Packers are a 5.5-point road favorite, and that seems high. We'll see if the Bears have a little more juice with a new offensive play-caller. For all the talk of the Kansas City Chiefs' undefeated record, if the Buffalo Bills beat them at home on Sunday they'll be one game behind them with the head-to-head tiebreaker in hand. This is a huge game in shaping the top of the AFC playoff picture. The Bills are 2.5-point favorites. That shows respect for the Bills to be favored over a 9-0 defending champion. It also shows some respect to the Chiefs that the line is less than a full field goal. The Bills struggled in losses to the Ravens and Texans, but both of those games came on the road. This is a prove-it game for Buffalo, and it can also go a long way in locking up the No. 1 seed in the AFC for Kansas City. BetMGM's odds for the AFC's No. 1 seed are Chiefs at -400 and Bills at +450, and if you like the Bills to win Sunday then taking them as the No. 1 seed might be smart, too. Anthony Richardson was benched a couple weeks ago because he wasn't playing well enough for the Indianapolis Colts. Then he got the job back because Joe Flacco wasn't any good either. Richardson goes on the road this week against a disappointing but talented New York Jets defense, and his passing yardage prop is 177.5. Richardson has had more than 175 passing yards in four of his six games this season. Has he changed as a quarterback after being benched for two weeks? Probably not. There's always a danger in betting the under on Richardson because he can complete a 70-yard pass at any time, but that's probably what he needs to hit the over. Burrow and Herbert are two of the quarterback stars from a loaded 2020 NFL Draft class, and they face off Sunday night. The Cincinnati Bengals, at 4-6, need to start winning now. But it won't come easy against a 6-3 Los Angeles Chargers team. It's a great slate for Week 11 and the Sunday night game should be entertaining as well. The Chargers are a small 1.5-point home favorite. The main question is, can the Bengals' defense slow the Chargers down? Enjoy Thursday and Sunday, because Monday night is a terrible dessert to a great meal. The Houston Texans will be taking on an inept Dallas Cowboys team. The Cowboys were bad with Dak Prescott and looked way worse without him last week. With Prescott injured, Dallas turned to Cooper Rush, who had 45 yards on 23 attempts last week. Gross. The Texans aren't exactly great lately either. They just blew a lead and lost at home to a Detroit Lions team that threw five interceptions. Houston is a 7.5-point favorite, which makes sense, but the main takeaway is that this game is a good argument for including Monday night games in the flex schedules.",2024-11-14
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Fantasy Football Week 11 sleepers: Audric Estimé seeks to run away with Broncos RB1 job,https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy-football-week-11-sleepers-audric-estime-seeks-to-run-away-with-broncos-rb1-job-165236155.html,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 16:52:36 GMT",Are your lineups in need of some assistance? Consider one of these Week 11 sleepers from fantasy football analyst Scott Pianowski.,"Week 10 was a messy week for scoring, and the Sleeper Page felt the brunt of that. Ricky Pearsall got home on a nifty touchdown at Tampa Bay, but the rest of the sheet was filled with bricks. That's life. We're onto Week 11. Everyone listed below, as usual, is rostered in fewer than 50% of Yahoo leagues as we go to press. Normally we think of a Baltimore-Pittsburgh game as the ultimate rock fight, with the first team to 17 points the likely winner. That's not the shape this year. Lamar Jackson is playing the best football of his career — a big statement given that he's already won two MVP awards — and the Baltimore secondary has been a sieve all season (22 touchdown passes allowed, 294.9 passing yards per game). The Ravens could also be without safety Kyle Hamilton, a key piece. Wilson has been steady as a fantasy pick since joining the lineup, grading out as QB3, QB24 and QB9. He's yet to get past 30 pass attempts yet, but with the game total set at 48.5, Pittsburgh will probably be more aggressive than usual. Perhaps we need to give Estimé more props for last week's 14-53-0 line at Kansas City — the Chiefs, after all, are a nightmare to run on this year. The Falcons' front seven is also a plus unit, but it's not in Kansas City's class. The Broncos are at home and a mild favorite, so game script will likely favor Estimé. And even if he doesn't get any work in the passing game — he's yet to catch an NFL pass, after 17 grabs his final year at Notre Dame — Estimé probably has 13-15 touches already in his back pocket. The goal-line work will probably be his, too. It's surprising his roster tag is so low, given that Jeudy has 19 targets and a credible 12-152-0 line since Jameis Winston took over as the Cleveland starting quarterback. The Saints' secondary is the 11th-easiest for opposing wideouts to score against, and obviously it lost Marshon Lattimore to a trade two weeks ago. Cedric Tillman looks like the first read for Winston, but Winston certainly prefers targeting wideouts downfield as opposed to taking the safe checkdown. Jeudy can easily return value as a WR3 this week. His role continues to expand, with nine catches and 18 targets over the past three games. And that run came against three difficult matchups in a row. Boutte now takes aim at a Rams secondary that's handed out the eighth-most points to opposing wide receivers. New England certainly trusts Boutte; he's played 96% and 97% of the snaps the past two weeks. The Patriots were able to beat Chicago with a buttoned-up game plan, but they'll probably need to be more pass-friendly if they want to hang with the Rams. Hill has crept over the threshold for inclusion in this column, but he's a sound enough play that we'll color outside the lines and push him into the mix. Hill always carries a heavy chunk of goal-line equity into any matchup, and note he lost an 88-yard touchdown last week to penalty. Alvin Kamara is obviously the featured guy in the New Orleans offense, but there's room for someone else to collect 5-8 carries, and that could be Hill. Mix in a handful of catches and maybe some goal-line work and Hill has a plausible case to land in the top 10 at tight end. With Trey McBride and Cade Otton unavailable this week (perhaps Dalton Kincaid, too), Hill could be a reasonable fill-in. He hasn't scored a touchdown yet, and goal-line equity is what we look at most of the time with tight end sleepers. But Dissly does have 24 catches in his last five games and the Chargers appear to be souring on Hayden Hurst, who dropped his only look in Week 10. Dissly might be a pickup that you hold for a while because the next five LAC opponents have struggled to mark the tight end. Justin Herbert is playing at a high level but the volume hasn't been there most weeks; perhaps the Cincinnati offense can force the Chargers out of their comfort zone in Week 11.",2024-11-14

Detroit Red Wings goaltender Cam Talbot embodies this mindset perfectly. On July 1st, he embarked on an exciting new chapter by signing a two-year contract with the Detroit Red Wings, valued at $2.5 million per season. Things are shaping up remarkably well for him. Talbot has achieved a 5-2-1 record in just nine games, showcasing 2.34 goals against average (GAA), an impressive .927 save percentage (SV%), and a shutout. I don't think Steve Yzerman was expecting him to be this good. But luckily for them, he has been. Earned it. 💪 pic.twitter.com/Bki6INj8N7 — Detroit Red Wings (@DetroitRedWings) November 14, 2024 Recently, Talbot played a pivotal role in the Red Wings' electrifying 3-2 overtime triumph, making 31 saves and setting a new personal milestone. That game marked his 250th career victory. With this achievement, Talbot now stands 65th in all-time career wins for goaltenders. Among active players, only Connor Hellebuyck, Semyon Varlamov, Frederik Andersen, Andrei Vasilevskiy, Jonathan Quick, Sergei Bobrovsky, and Marc-Andre Fleury have surpassed his career victories. Talbot’s journey is not ending just yet, and it's clear that he has the potential to make an even greater impact in the league. Talbot has recently had a few new chapters; he is now on his fifth team in six seasons, having played for the Calgary Flames, Minnesota Wild, Ottawa Senators, and Los Angeles Kings before stopping in Detroit. While it's unlikely that he will reach the full heights of his time with the Edmonton Oilers, he will likely land somewhere just under that. And that should suit Red Wings fans just fine.

Andy Behrens gets you ready to wheel and deal.,"The following is an excerpt from the latest edition of Yahoo's fantasy football newsletter, Get to the Points! If you like what you see, you can subscribe for free here. Look, there are plenty of weeks within the fantasy calendar when you can afford to switch to auto-pilot for a few days and not focus obsessively on your team — but this week, right now, isn't one of them. It’s time to lock in, people. We are careening toward the Yahoo default trade deadline on Saturday, so there’s work to be done. When you wake up on Sunday morning, one of the essential paths to improving your roster will be closed for the season. Everyone enjoys trading, so let’s get to it. Our mission is to give you three key pieces of trade advice and then offer some fantasy buy-low candidates to target. Every league has that one manager who approaches trades by thinking only of the players they’d like to dump, not the holes other teams may need to fill. A few times each season, that person will spam the league with Kadarius Toney offers (or similar), then complain that no one is ever willing to trade. The tiniest amount of pre-offer consideration can go such a long way. Take 30 seconds to review the roster of the team you intend to deal with, then propose something to help both parties. If your offer doesn’t include anything that can obviously improve the other manager’s squad, then it’s simply a time-waster, not a conversation starter. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. A decent guiding principle in fantasy trades is that if you land the best individual player in the deal, you did well. We’ve reached the point in the fantasy season when contending teams need to focus on constructing the best possible starting rosters, sacrificing depth in the process. We should be looking to maximize weekly scoring potential. Roster depth is a funny thing — it’s incredibly valuable in September and not at all in December. Each week, it becomes less important. By the time we hit the money weeks of the playoffs, your starting lineup should be so loaded that it basically sets itself, while your bench should be full of lottery tickets. Some of you are simply not wired to follow this advice, which is too bad. At some point down the road, it’s gonna cost you a fantasy title. We should never get so paralyzed by the fear of losing a deal that we forget the real priority, which is to hold the league trophy at the end of the season. If a trade can improve your team’s starting roster, it’s probably worth making. The whole idea is to deal from areas of surplus to address weaknesses. If both sides feel moderately uncomfortable with the deal, then it’s probably a winner. Here are five early-season underperformers who are A) strong candidates for positive regression, B) endlessly frustrating to the manager who drafted them, and C) obtainable via trade at a discount relative to their draft prices: He’s apparently dealing with one of the worst quadriceps injuries in the history of quads, because it’s already cost him three games. While he’s making progress, he's no lock to face the Chargers on Sunday. Let’s just please remember that when healthy this year, he’s been his usual self, averaging 9.0 targets and 68.2 receiving yards per game. If he’s good-to-go in December, he’s an obvious potential difference-maker. Few players are as chronically disrespected as Jacobs. He’s pretty much always available via trade, despite being one of the NFL’s most elusive runners. According to PFF, Jacobs currently ranks among the leaders in missed tackles forced (33) and yards after contact (3.73 per carry). He’s tied to an upper-tier offense, yet he’s only reached the end zone four times this season. Jacobs is the RB17 on the season at the moment, but he’s a clear candidate to enjoy a post-bye surge. We are nearing the end of the original recovery timeline from the fractured leg Pacheco suffered back in September. He should not have much difficulty reclaiming the primary rushing role for KC. Kareem Hunt has been a terrific waiver find this season, but he hasn’t exactly delivered a convincing impersonation of a healthy Pacheco. Hunt is averaging just 3.6 YPC and the underlying numbers are somehow less impressive. Only five of his 125 carries have gained 10 or more yards and he’s averaging just 2.36 yards after contact per attempt. Earth’s best quarterback is still outside the position’s top-12 in terms of year-to-date fantasy scoring, plus he’s headed into a dicey matchup at Buffalo. It’s an excellent time to buy. He’s thrown six touchdown passes over his last three games while averaging 273 passing YPG, so it’s already apparent that his weekly upside has returned with DeAndre Hopkins now in the mix. Pretty gross, right? Yeah, we know. But again, the idea here is to flag good players who can actually be acquired via trade. Johnson is actually gonna hit a few waiver wires this week after back-to-back dud performances for Baltimore. He was never a great bet to put up numbers in his first game for the Ravens following a mid-season trade, however — and then his second game was a Thursday nighter, which left little time for his role to expand. He’s a proven multi-year producer and one of the best separators in the game, so we don’t have to worry about his ability to leapfrog guys like Nelson Agholor in this team’s receiving hierarchy.",2024-11-14
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",The Fantasy Football Numbers Do Lie: Don't let Justin Herbert’s QB21 rank fool you,https://sports.yahoo.com/the-fantasy-football-numbers-do-lie-dont-let-justin-herberts-qb21-rank-fool-you-154254432.html,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:42:54 GMT",Fantasy football analyst Dalton Del Don examines some of the most deceiving stats ahead of Week 11 — including Justin Herbert's deceptively low rank of QB21 on the season.,"A simple look at a box score or a study of fantasy football categories doesn't always tell the whole story of how a player is performing. Dalton Del Don attempts to identify misleading numbers that are worth a closer look. Yes ... The Numbers Do Lie. Ridley has averaged 10.7 targets, 6.7 catches and 100.0 receiving yards while scoring two touchdowns over three games since DeAndre Hopkins was traded. He’s been fantasy’s WR5 in points per game over that span. Ridley sports a 32% TPRR (targets per route run), 3.03 YPRR and a 41% first-read target rate since Hopkins left, which are WR1 numbers. It's a small sample, but it’s also encouraging Ridley maintained production after Will Levis returned last week. Moreover, Ridley has the third easiest remaining schedule for wide receivers after having the league’s toughest until now. Ridley’s impressive rates will regress some, and this is still an offense with a lowly 16.75-point implied total this week (when Levis may struggle versus Minnesota’s blitzing). But Ridley’s usage with Hopkins gone has been undeniable, and he suddenly looks like a top-20 WR down the stretch (even if some duds are sprinkled in). Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Herbert has been fantasy’s QB21 in points per game, but he’s been the QB9 over the last four weeks. He’s getting a career-high 7.8 YPA with an 11:1 TD:INT ratio, but volume has been a problem for his fantasy production. The Chargers rank 25th in pass plays per game. Los Angeles has allowed just 13.1 points per game, which would be top 15 in NFL history if the season ended. The Chargers’ red-zone defense (38.9%) is likely to regress. Moreover, L.A.’s favorable schedule has been loaded with low projected totals, but the Chargers’ upcoming matchups should feature many more shootouts. Herbert’s had the 10th hardest QB fantasy schedule so far, but he has the sixth easiest rest-of-season. The Chargers are one of just nine teams with a positive pass rate over expectation over the last month, as Los Angeles has thrown decidedly more since its bye. Herbert has also run more since L.A.’s bye, which is possibly a sign his foot is feeling better. Different upcoming game scripts will help Herbert’s terrific performance translate more into fantasy production. His season rank is highly misleading. Brown played a career-high 89% of the snaps last week when he saw all 24 RB opportunities. Newcomer Khalil Herbert played two snaps and botched a handoff resulting in a fumble, leading to a Leonard Fournette workout Monday. Brown had a season-high 75% route participation and saw a career-high 11 targets. He’s seen 100% of the Bengals’ RB touches over the last two weeks, including a whopping nine opportunities inside the 10-yard line. With Zack Moss out for the season, Brown has Cincinnati’s backfield to himself. Brown has been fantasy’s RB3 since Moss went down despite a matchup in Baltimore last week against a Ravens’ defense allowing just 56.8 RB rushing yards per game. Joe Burrow has looked fantastic, so Brown is in a terrific situation. He gets a tough matchup on the road against the Chargers this week and then a bye, but Brown should be treated as a top-12 back down the stretch. Jennings ranks 50th among pass catchers in receptions this season, but his volume will continue to increase with Brandon Aiyuk out for the season. Jennings led San Francisco in routes run, targets, catches, air yards and receiving yards during his first game without Aiyuk last week. He had the league’s sixth-highest first-read target share (38.5%) last week, and Brock Purdy owns the league’s fourth-best Passer Rating (134.5) when targeting Jennings. He ranks second in the NFL in yards per route run, eighth in fantasy points per route run and 10th among 117 pass catchers in ESPN’s Receiving Score. Jennings owns a 32% TPRR with Aiyuk off the field, and he’s now replaced BA as the 49ers’ “X” receiver. Jennings erupted for 41 fantasy points in Week 3 with Deebo Samuel Sr. out — the only other game in which he’s acted as SF’s WR2. Jennings isn’t Terrell Owens 2.0, but he can clearly play; he’ll now see a much bigger opportunity on a potent offense due for major red-zone regression. The 49ers’ offense looks crowded with Christian McCaffrey back, but Samuel Sr. has been slowed by multiple injuries, and George Kittle is dealing with hamstring irritation. Jennings’ range of outcomes suddenly includes him being a top-12 WR down the stretch.",2024-11-14

	'We’re nothing. We’re just dead. We’re dust.'","Tonight, November 15, is the much-publicized boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul. Ahead of the fight, which will stream on Netflix, Iron Mike was asked by internet-famous teen reporter Jazlyn Guerra, a.k.a. Jazzy’s World TV, for his thoughts on legacy. He took it very seriously.   “Well, I don’t know. I don’t believe in the word ‘legacy,'” Tyson replied. “I just think that’s another word for ego. Legacy doesn’t mean nothing. That’s just some word everybody grabbed onto. Someone said that word, and everyone grabbed on the words, and now it’s used every five seconds. It means absolutely nothing to me. I’m just passing through. I’mma die, and it’s gonna be over. Who cares about legacy after that?”  Tyson somehow wasn’t done. “What a big ego,” he continued. “So I’mma die. I want people to think that I’m this, I’m great. I’m, no. We’re nothing. We’re just dead. We’re dust. We’re absolutely nothing. Our legacy is nothing.” Guerra responded to Tyson’s stream-of-consciousness existentialism with a polite “thank you so much for sharing that,” but 50 Cent had another takeaway. “G*ddam it! Mike ya scaring the kids, WTF chill,” the rapper wrote on X. “Note to self, keep the kids away from Mike.”  You can watch the video here.

Thursday (Nov. 14) found the two men doing their final weigh-in and stare down ahead of their Netflix exhibition. Tyson weighed in at 233 pounds and promptly took his spot on stage. Paul was clocked at 220 pounds, a career-high for him, and then began his usual antics. Hitting the stage in a crawling stance, Jake Paul then immediately began running toward Iron Mike, getting directly in his face. 
ESPN reports that around this time, the YouTuber “purposefully” stepped on Tyson’s foot, to which he responded by slapping him in the face. A source close to the event claimed that Mike Tyson had grown “tired” of the content creator’s trash talk in the days leading up to Thursday. So, Paul stepping on the OG’s foot finally set him over the top, resulting in him slapping his opponent. “[Mike Tyson] hits like a bi**h! It’s personal now. He must die!” Paul dramatically screamed to the crowd while Tyson walked away from the stage.

	The slap marks a shift in Mike Tyson’s behavior towards Paul. Throughout the event’s rollout, Tyson and Paul have played it fast and loose, keeping the banter semi-playful while throwing in a couple of laughs and jabs here and there. However, as the day of the fight quickly approached, Tyson transformed into something far more intense.

Seth Moulton, D-Mass., ripped the Democratic Party as ""very arrogant"" following its stunning electoral defeat at the hands of President-elect Donald Trump last week. Democrats in Massachusetts are plotting a revolt against House Rep. Seth Moulton after he made multiple statements condemning his party for supporting trans inclusion in women's sports, according to the Boston Globe.  Salem Democratic City Committee chair Liz Bradt told the Globe that she had heard from ""several"" people in the area who were considering running against him in Massachusetts’ Sixth District. ""We will find someone to run against him and win,"" Bradt said.  Moulton is up for re-election in 2026. But he has been the subject of intense criticism by members in his own state and party since last week, when he spoke out against his party's stance on trans athletes in women's and girls' sports in a New York Times article. Moulton has doubled down on his comments in several interviews since then, inciting more and more backlash from his party members.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA) questions Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley during a House Armed Services Committee hearing July 9, 2020, on ""Department of Defense Authorities and Roles Related to Civilian Law Enforcement,"" in Washington, D.C.  (Greg Nash/Pool/AFP via Getty Images) Salem city councilor Kyle Davis, who is planning a pro-trans rally outside of Moulton's office this Sunday, told Fox News Digital that he will actively contribute to another candidate who challenges Moulton, and is even calling for the congressman to resign ahead of 2026.  ""I certainly am calling on Seth Moulton to resign and will be supporting any Democrat and LGBT ally that runs against him,"" Davis said.  Moulton's original comments about the subject were rooted in his stance as a father to two daughters. In television interviews with CNN and MSNBC, the Democrat has stood firm and has not made any apologies.  But Moulton also told Fox News Digital's Liz Elkind in an exclusive interview that there are others in the Democrat party who agree with him.   ""While a few, a handful, maybe just a couple members of Congress have spoken out against the comments, I've got an awful lot more who will go up to me privately and say thank you,"" Moulton said.  Moulton also said he welcomes any challengers from within his own party to run against him in 2026.  ""It’s a democracy. If you want to run against me, go for it,"" Moulton said, but added that it was ""not going to be very helpful for winning elections."" ""What we need to do is defeat Republicans, not fellow Democrats."" Democrats who have previously voted for laws that would enable transgender inclusion in women's sports have publicly denounced their support for the concept in the weeks leading up to Election Day. They include Texas Reps. Colin Allred and Vicente Gonzalez and Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola.  TRANS VOLLEYBALL PLAYER ACCUSED OF PLAN TO HARM TEAMMATE AFTER TAKING SCHOLARSHIPS FROM FEMALE PLAYERS Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., also spoke out against trans inclusion in the same New York Times article as Moulton.  The Biden-Harris administration passed a sweeping reform to Title IX in April that aimed to provide more protection for gender identity in schools and universities. It clarified that Title IX’s ban on ""sex"" discrimination in schools covers discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and ""pregnancy or related conditions."" And while the administration insisted the regulation does not address athletic eligibility, multiple experts presented evidence to Fox News Digital in June that it would ultimately put more biological men in women's sports.  Democrats have introduced and co-sponsored the Equality Act in congress, which was proposed in 2019 and has had revisions that ""would force public schools to allow biologically male athletes who identify as transgender on girls' sports teams."" In March 2023, Democrats advocated for a transgender bill of rights, proposing a resolution ""recognizing that it is the duty of the Federal Government to develop and implement a Transgender Bill of Rights.""  Multiple states have filed lawsuits and enacted their own laws to address this issue, and then the U.S. Supreme Court then voted 5-4 in August to reject an emergency request by the Biden administration to enforce its sweeping Title IX changes in the states trying to prevent it.  But that hasn't prevented such reforms from happening altogether, thanks to the work of Democrat judges. At the high school level, multiple Obama-era federal judges have passed rulings that allow transgender inclusion in girls sports. Judges Landya McCafferty in New Hampshire and M. Hannah Lauck of Virgina each issued rulings this year that enabled biological males to play on high school girls' soccer and tennis teams. Both judges were appointed by Obama in the early 2010s.  President Trump has proposed a full-on ban of all trans inclusion in women's and girls' sports, and it was a campaign issue that he and other Republicans hammered Democrat opponents on in the recent election, en-route to taking back control of the White House, Senate and House of Representatives.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP 2020 US Democratic Presidential hopeful Representative for Massachusetts' 6th congressional district Seth Moulton announces he is ending his campaign for the President of The United States during the Democratic National Committee's summer meeting in San Francisco, California on August 23, 2019.  (Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images) ""People think that this is exactly the kind of debate that we need to have. And it's not just on trans issues, it's on the economy. Why are we out of touch with Americans on the economy when Trump's plan is going to dramatically raise grocery prices? . . . How is it that we're so out of touch on immigration when we're the ones who proposed a bipartisan immigration deal?"" Moulton said to Fox News Digital.  ""It seems like Democrats do have a lot of good solutions for working Americans, and yet we're really out of touch. So we've got to ask ourselves that question. Why have we lost touch with so many people across America?""  Fox News Digital's Liz Elkin contributed to this report.  Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.     Jackson Thompson is a sports writer for Fox News Digital.

One of the NFL's greatest rivalries in recent years – the Buffalo Bills and Kansas City Chiefs – kicks off its latest chapter in Orchard Park, New York, on Sunday in a highly anticipated matchup.  The Chiefs remain undefeated after blocking a game-winning field goal against the Denver Broncos, while the Bills have ripped off five straight victories to come in at 8-2 on the year.  The team to beat in the NFL is the Chiefs, and though they have been in some close games, they have done whatever it takes to get the job done and make sure their loss column remains clean.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, #17, stiff-arms Indianapolis Colts defensive end Dayo Odeyingbo, #54, during the second half of an NFL football game on Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024 in Indianapolis. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings) So, what do the Bills need to do to get a win against their rival? NFL legend Rob Gronkowski knows it all comes to those final minutes in the fourth quarter, better known as ""crunch time."" ""The Bills need to play a complete game. All four quarters, there’s no doubt about that,"" Gronkowski told Fox News Digital at Great Wolf Lodge's grand opening in Naples, Florida, on Thursday. ""And when it comes to crunch time, they cannot make any mistakes because Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs, they don’t make mistakes when it comes to crunch time.

It’s going to come down to the wire like every other game with the Chiefs this year. [Buffalo] gotta be able to be perfect in crunch time and not make those mistakes. Catch the ball, they can’t have a drop. They can’t have an interception, they can’t have a fumble when it comes down to the final minutes.""

One of them was an all-time NFL classic, as the Chiefs beat the Bills in overtime to advance after Mahomes infamously got downfield in 13 seconds to give Harrison Butker the chance at a field goal to send it to overtime. Since the playoffs are what truly matters to both of these teams, Gronkowski knows what a win for Buffalo, his hometown team, could do for them when it comes time for the matchup everyone wants to see in the playoffs once again.  ""The Bills need to win this game because they need that confidence of going into the playoffs to know they can beat the Chiefs,"" he said. ""They just gotta do it at least once. If they do that this weekend coming up, I feel like it will give the Bills confidence to beat anyone when it comes playoff time."" Gronkowski was inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame earlier this week, and all he heard was Bills-Chiefs talk with the area fully prepared to get rowdy on Sunday night.  ""It’s probably going to be the best game of the weekend, which is great for the NFL and great for Buffalo,"" Gronkowski said.  Former NFL player Rob Gronkowski looks on before Super Bowl LVII between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, on Feb. 12, 2023.

Here is what to know about the long-awaited bout.,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. IRVING, Texas – Arguably, the biggest boxing event in recent memory is finally here. Jake Paul, who rose to fame through social media, is fighting former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on Friday night. Paul says he got the idea after an ayahuasca retreat, and it finally came to fruition when it was announced back in March. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Mike Tyson, left, and Jake Paul face off during their ceremonial weigh-in at The Pavilion at Toyota Music Factory on Nov. 14, 2024 in Irving, Texas. The two are scheduled to meet in a heavyweight bout on Nov. 15 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.  (Christian Petersen/Getty Images) The fight was originally slated for July 20, but when Tyson had an ulcer flare-up in May, the fight was postponed four months. Many may think this is simply a publicity stunt, but the state of Texas is sanctioning this as a professional fight. Meaning, the fight will be on Tyson's record and will be his first official fight since 2005, a sixth-round TKO loss to Kevin McBride (his bout against Roy Jones Jr. in 2020, where Paul was on the undercard against ex-NBA star Nate Robinson, was an exhibition). Meanwhile, this will be Paul's third fight of the calendar year. While it may be sanctioned, there are some tweaks: the fight will be eight, two-minute rounds with 14-ounce gloves.

(Christian Petersen/Getty Images) MIKE TYSON 'FINE' BEING UNDERDOG TO JAKE PAUL; ODDSMAKER SAYS WHY The fight is being branded via Paul's promotion, Most Valuable Promotions, which he and Nakisa Bidarian co-founded in 2021. The promotion helped Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano sell out Madison Square Garden in 2022, and the two will have a rematch as the co-main event on Friday night. Paul-Tyson will be broadcast on Netflix at no additional charge aside from a subscription, meaning the fight can be broadcast on nearly 300 million televisions worldwide. Paul enters the fight at 10-1 in his career, with six of his victories coming via knockout. Tyson is 50-6 with 44 KOs. The two boxers have taken different approaches in the lead up to the fight. Paul is doing what he does best: talk, troll and get people angry. Tyson, meanwhile, has kept his answers short, sweet and very to the point. At least, that was the case until Thursday night. Everyone got a pretty nice preview at the weigh-in, as Tyson smacked Paul with an open hand at the weigh in. Tyson even squared up but was held back by numerous personnel before things escalated.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,IOC presidential candidate calls to protect women from trans athletes as Trump pledges ban before LA 2028,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ioc-presidential-candidate-calls-protect-women-from-trans-athletes-trump-pledges-ban-before-la-2028,"Fri, 15 Nov 2024 07:09:05 -0500","Sebastian Coe, a candidate to be the next president of the International Olympic Committee, called for protecting women athletes from trans inclusion.","OutKick contributor Riley Gaines joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss her reaction to the 'alarming' number of medals lost as 200 female golfers sign a letter to the LPGA raising concerns over its transgender athlete policy.  Sebastian Coe, a candidate to be the next president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), made his stance on protecting women's sports clear on Tuesday.  Coe promised to introduce an ""uncompromising and clearcut"" policy to protect women’s sports if he is elected president in the March election. Coe is a former Olympian for Great Brittain and won two gold medals running in the 1,500m, one in the 1980 Moscow games and one in 1984 in Los Angeles.  The sanctity of women's sports and gender eligibility came under a heated global microscope at this summer's Paris Olympics, when Imane Khelif of Algeria and Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan won gold medals in women's boxing. Both athletes had previously been disqualified from international competitions for failing gender eligibility tests. However, the IOC and current President Thomas Bach voiced support for both athletes.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Imane Khelif, right, from Algeria and Luca Anna Hamori from Hungary fight each other. (Sina Schuldt/picture alliance via Getty Images) Coe might sing a very different tune if he is elected president ahead of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.  ""I think the International Olympic Committee needs a very, very clear policy in this space,"" Coe told BBC this week. ""And the protection of the female category, for me, is absolutely non-negotiable.If you are not prepared to do that, and that is where the international federations expect a lead to be taken, then you really will lose female sport and I'm not prepared to see that happen. I'm not sure that policy is clear enough at the moment."" Coe added that the situation involving Khelif and Yu-ting made him ""uncomfortable.""  Khelif and Yu-ting's natural birth sex is disputed.  However, a broader conversation about the inclusion of biological males in girls' and women's sports has erupted across the global sports landscape in recent years, especially in the U.S., where the next Summer Games will take place.  The United Nations released study findings that say nearly 900 biological females have fallen short of the podium because they were beaten out by transgender athletes. The study, titled ""Violence against women and girls in sports,"" said that more than 600 athletes did not medal in more than 400 competitions in 29 different sports, totaling over 890 medals, according to information obtained up to March 30. ""The replacement of the female sports category with a mixed-sex category has resulted in an increasing number of female athletes losing opportunities, including medals, when competing against males,"" the report said. TRANS VOLLEYBALL PLAYER ACCUSED OF PLAN TO HARM TEAMMATE AFTER TAKING SCHOLARSHIPS FROM FEMALE PLAYERS In the U.S., President-elect Donald Trump and even his wife Melania, who has admitted to disagreeing with Republicans on issues of LGBT rights, each announced that they are opposed to allowing biological males to compete in girls' and women's sports. Trump has gone as far as advocating for a full-on ban during a town hall event on Fox News during his campaign.  Since Trump's recent election win, the IOC and Bach have not acknowledged it. When asked why there was no formal acknowledgment of Trump’s win last week, the IOC cited its tradition of neutrality and not taking political sides, according to the AP. Polls show that the majority of Americans are not in favor of trans inclusion in women's sports, which was a key campaign issue for Trump and other Republicans in the recent cycle.  Nearly 70% of Americans do not believe that biological men should be allowed to compete in women's sports, according to a Gallup poll taken last year. In June, a survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago asked respondents to weigh in on whether transgender athletes of both sexes should be permitted to participate in sports leagues that correspond to their preferred gender identity instead of their biological sex. Sixty-five percent answered that it should either never be or rarely be allowed. When those polled were asked specifically about adult transgender female athletes competing on women’s sports teams, 69% opposed it. It is very possible that Trump, now with a Republican majority in both the Senate and House of Representatives, and a conservative majority in the Supreme Court, could make good on his promise to ban trans inclusion in women's sports by the 2028 summer games.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Lord Sebastian Coe speaks during a Memorial Service for Kevan Gosper AO in the Olympic Room at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sept. 17, 2024 in Melbourne, Australia. (Daniel Pockett/Getty Images for the AOC) If Coe wins the IOC presidential election, it could be a point of agreement where the IOC and Trump can find common ground.  Trump has not had a good history of cooperation with Bach.  IOC President Thomas Bach made one visit to the White House in June 2017 that is part of Olympic lore for how badly it went. ""Pray for our world,"" Bach was heard to say on a cellphone call later that day in Washington, D.C.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Detroit Lions star receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown ruffled some Green Bay Packers fans' feathers after arriving at Lambeau Field wearing a ""Green Bay Sucks"" sweatshirt before the rivalry matchup. St. Brown brought fuel to this NFC North rivalry that was already potent, and one Packers legend had nothing but respect for it. ""I love it, I love it,"" Clay Matthews told Fox News Digital. ""I wish I would've done more of it."" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Detroit Lions wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, with a ""Green Bay Sucks"" hoodie, walks off the bus as the team arrives at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis., on Nov. 3, 2024. (IMAGN) Matthews, who was inducted into the Packers Hall of Fame this year, spent 10 of his 11 NFL seasons leading Green Bay on defense. And when it came to the Lions' rivalry, the Packers were usually the ones taking care of business in those bouts.  But seeing as the Lions are the team to beat at the moment in the division, Matthews can't help but tip his cap to someone like St. Brown, who is already not in the best relationship with Packers fans.  In a rivalry, though, that's just the way it's supposed to be. Matthews even likened what St. Brown did, and will likely continue to do, to the WWE. LIONS STAR AMON-RA ST BROWN'S PREGAME OUTFIT FEATURES CLEAR MESSAGE FOR PACKERS AHEAD OF RIVALRY GAME ""You're not trying to go against the grain. You're not trying to get any media headlines, but if there's one thing you can learn from the WWE or the UFC, it's that this is the type of stuff that makes rivalries. This is what fans want to see,"" Matthews said. ""They want to see Amon-Ra have a ‘Green Bay Sucks’ shirt and how Green Bay's going to respond, and the fans take that reaction of, ‘They don’t respect us,' but Detroit playing the ‘Detroit vs. Everybody.’ ""I think it makes great storylines, and it makes it more engaging for us fans now that I've transitioned to being a fan. I love to see it."" Last season, St. Brown even tried to do a ""Lambeau Leap"" touchdown celebration, and one Packers fan decided to pour their beer down his jersey. Since then, St. Brown has been relentless about sticking it to the Packers and its fan base, whenever they're on the schedule.  Detroit Lions wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown catches a pass in front of Green Bay Packers cornerback Keisean Nixon to score a touchdown during the second quarter at Lambeau Field. (Jeff Hanisch - USA TODAY) It will be at Ford Field in Detroit the next time these two square off, a ""Thursday Night Football"" game on Dec. 5.  Would Matthews try something like St. Brown if he was still playing for Green Bay?  ""Hey, I'm not trying to get pelted with beer or anything like that,"" Matthews said, laughing. ""It takes a brave soul to wear something like that to Detroit or Philly or anywhere else for that matter."" But Matthews admits the Lions are certainly the team to beat in the conference, and when that matchup does come around, perhaps his former squad can lean into the rivalry just like St. Brown has to get the juices flowing more than normal. ""Right now, the Lions are rolling. They look great,"" Matthews admitted. ""Obviously, it's still a little early in the season, but they look like the team to beat, in the NFC, that is. I know the Packers dropped one, but they have another one coming up against them. It's going to be a tight race, and it's going to be a fun playoffs to watch.""

(IMAGN) GIVING BACK WITH CROWN ROYAL While Matthews is a Jets fan when it comes to supporting Rodgers, he will always be a Packer, which is why he teamed up with Crown Royal, the official whiskey sponsor of the NFL, in its fourth year of the Kick Off with Crown program.  This year, Crown Royal launched its one-of-a-kind tailgate on wheels with the Crown Royal Rig, a purple 18-wheeler touring NFL stadiums to not just wow NFL fans with players like Matthews but to also support the military.  Matthews talked about his excitement about not only being able to return to Lambeau to mingle with Packers fans on Thanksgiving night before his former team’s game against the Miami Dolphins, but also why this tailgate is so important. Fans will be putting together care packages for military members with Crown Royal’s longtime partner, Packages From Home. ""I think what’s even more important is how Crown Royal is giving back to the military community, specifically with their Purple Bag Project,"" Matthews said. ""Giving away morale-boosting items to our military by giving them the packages from home.  The 18-wheeler Crown Royal Rig is traveling the country to different NFL stadiums to help the military.

The Eagles scored 20 fourth-quarter points to defeat the Commanders and create some distance in their lead in the NFC East. The Commanders were behind 12-10 when they were stopped on second- and third-and-1. Buoyed by an early-season hot streak, coach Dan Quinn called his rookie quarterback’s number on fourth-and-2 from the Eagles 26. Jayden Daniels juggled the snap, scrambled to his right and was hammered out of bounds by linebacker Zack Baun. The Eagles took over on downs. The defining win for the Commanders under Quinn and Daniels has to wait. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Shortly after that misfire, Saquon Barkley rushed for the first of his two fourth-quarter touchdowns to give division-leading Philadelphia a two-score lead, and the Eagles (8-2) sent the Commanders (7-4) to their second straight loss, 26-18 on Thursday night. ""Bold call,"" Quinn said. ""I’d also say we were prepared for that moment. Didn’t love the execution. But we’ve been an excellent fourth-down team. Going into it, we knew we’d have to take our shots against a tough division team on the road. We didn’t like the execution or the result. But we were prepared for that."" Plan B was the field goal. Zane Gonzalez, promoted off the practice squad with Austin Seibert dealing with a hip injury, made a 45-yarder in the third quarter for a 10-3 lead. Quinn decided not to give him another shot from about 44 yards out for a 13-12 lead. ""To be the heavy hitters that we want to be, you’ve got to be able to close,"" Quinn said. ""How do you learn the lesson to close? That’s what we’re going to become. You knew this adversity was coming. It just does."" Daniels finished 22 of 32 for 191 yards and a late touchdown pass. He was intercepted by safety Reed Blankenship late in the fourth, setting up Barkley’s second TD. As for the decisive fourth-down call, Daniels said, ""I’m always a part of, hey let’s go for it."" It was a frustrating night for Daniels and top receiver Terry McLaurin, who exceeded 100 yards receiving in last Sunday’s loss to Pittsburgh for the fourth time in the past eight games, accumulating 113 on five catches. McLaurin had just one catch for 10 yards against the Eagles and cornerback Quinyon Mitchell. ""It happens,"" McLaurin said. ""I can only control what I can.""

The Commanders play four of their next five games at home, starting Nov. 24 against Dallas. They need a breather. While the Eagles had the earliest bye in the NFL in Week 5, the Commanders have the latest in Week 14, and the injuries are piling up after a relatively healthy start to the season.

SportsLogos.Net News,Cleveland Guardians Announce Changes to Uniforms for 2025 Season,https://news.sportslogos.net/2024/11/15/cleveland-guardians-announce-changes-to-uniforms-for-2025-season/baseball/,"Fri, 15 Nov 2024 19:22:52 +0000",The Cleveland Guardians announced today they&#8217;re making changes to all four of their standard uniforms for the 2025 Major League Baseball season. It&#8217;s the first tweak the club has made to their set since they rebranded as the Guardians three years ago. We&#8217;ll start with the home and road set,"The Cleveland Guardians announced today they’re making changes to all four of their standard uniforms for the 2025 Major League Baseball season. It’s the first tweak the club has made to their set since they rebranded as the Guardians three years ago. We’ll start with the home and road set before moving onto the bigger changes announced today, to their two alternate jerseys. At home the Guardians will continue to wear the same scripted red wordmark across their chest as they have since 2022, but it’s now presented straight across the jersey rather than diagonally. New red/blue/red piping has been added to this jersey as well, around the collar and around each sleeve, replacing last year’s single blue stripe. The biggest change to the Guardians home uniform is the new cap they’ll wear with it, which will now be predominantly red instead of blue. The logo on the front of the cap remains their “Diamond-C” logo, but now in blue with white trim. For road games, the only change we’ll see to the Guardians grey jersey is the addition of that same piping we see on the home whites — red/blue/red around the collar and each arm. The “CLEVELAND” wordmark across the chest remains the same. The cap paired with the road grey jersey is now the blue crown with red visor the team wore for home games from 2022-24. The all-blue cap, which had been worn exclusively on the road last year, is history. The Guardians red home jersey will see a totally new wordmark across the chest, as they’ll now use their “Bridge Print” font to display GUARDIANS in blue with white trim. Previously, this jersey used the same scripted-style lettering we see on the home whites. The new piping is present on the red jerseys as well, but now in a blue/white/blue pattern. Photos show the Guardians wearing their blue cap with a red visor alongside this jersey, just as they did last year. The biggest overall change comes to the road blue set, where the arched “CLEVELAND” wordmark has been scrapped in favour of their Diamond C cap logo in red with white trim. The club says this is an homage to the team’s uniforms worn between 1901 and 1945 which also featured a large “C” on the front. Piping is present on this set as well, in a red/white/red pattern around the collar and sleeves. No changes here! In 2025, the Guardians will continue to wear their Guardians of Traffic-inspired navy blue City Connect uniform exactly as it was in 2024. My thoughts? While I like its design, the red cap paired their home white jersey will take some getting used to; they did try this once before, very briefly in 2018, before going back to their usual navy blue lids. I wouldn’t be surprised to see them switch to the blue caps at home at some point in 2025 and instead wear the red caps with the red jerseys. The addition of the piping is nice, but where it looks especially sharp is on the club’s new blue road alternate tops. That classic bright red/white/red immediately gives me flashbacks to uniform styles of the 1970s and 1980s (think of the Big Red Machine). The big bold red “C” on the dark navy blue jersey is also a strong look with nice ties back to the team’s uniform roots. None of the new jerseys are available to purchase yet, the team says they’ll be available at some point before the start of the 2025 season.",2024-11-15
SportsLogos.Net News,Puma Unveils New Home and Away Kits for Five African National Teams,https://news.sportslogos.net/2024/11/15/puma-unveils-new-home-and-away-kits-for-five-african-national-teams/soccer/,"Fri, 15 Nov 2024 17:53:35 +0000","Countries on the continent outfitted by Puma include Côte d'Ivoire, Egypt, Ghana, Morocco and Senegal","With qualification matches underway for the next African Cup of Nations, Puma has unveiled new national team home and away kits for countries they outfit on the continent. Puma officially launched the five sets of jerseys on Friday, November 15, saying in a press release that they “have each been constructed with identity and culture at the forefront, with intricate designs representing different takes on the country’s art, history and pride – reimagined for the Beautiful Game.” “We are incredibly proud to unveil these kits, ones that will be worn by some of the best nations, players and fans on the continent,” said Marco Mueller, Puma’s senior head of product line management teamsport apparel. “Africa is part of the Puma DNA and we are proud to work together with our fantastic nations. This comes at an exciting time for African football, ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations for both men’s and women’s teams in 2025, and we’re excited to see what those next iconic moments in our kits will look like.” Here’s a closer look at all five jerseys and what Puma had to say about each design: The new Côte d’Ivoire kits are inspired by the annual festival ‘La Fête des Masques’ the festival at the heart of Ivorian folklore. The iconic orange Home jersey has been intricately detailed with a fringe effect that is applied to traditional costumes and reminiscent of festival goers, whilst the Away jersey design symbolizes the dances performed at the festival and features a white base with green detailing to allow the elephant to take center stage. Both kits capture the vibrancy and ceremonial essence of Ivorian culture. Egypt has been crowned champions of Africa on seven occasions, so it’s only fitting their new kits acknowledge the Kings and Queens the country is synonymous with. Pharaoh, sphinx, sand dune and pyramid themed designs adorn both kits, with the bold red Home jersey featuring a repeat stylised illustration of Pharaohs, pyramids and sand dunes in an all over print, whilst the white Away jersey features an attention-grabbing Pharaoh design as the centrepiece amongst a pattern of pyramids. Four-time Africa Cup of Nation winners Ghana are iconic in every sense, both in name and nature. Traditional Adinkra symbols form a unique all-over pattern on the Home kit, with a central black star completing the statement, meanwhile the Away kit shines brightly in yellow, similarly incorporating the star and symbols as a nod to Ghana’s rich cultural heritage. Ghanaian native, Jefferson Osei set out to unite Ghanaian tribes through his kit design. Working with renowned Ghanaian painter Daniel Alum Jasper, who painted the graphic element of selected Adinkra symbols by Jefferson resonating with all the different tribes within Ghana, he created a custom print for the new Home kit. Upon initial glance, the white jersey appears to feature a simple star print; but as players begin to perspire, the symbols become more pronounced. The yellow Away kit pays homage to Ghana’s ‘Gold Coast’ and represents the colors often found in Ghanaian culture and has the adinkra symbols on the sleeves of the jersey. Morocco is set for big expectations both on and off the pitch in 2025 as hosts of the men’s and women’s Africa Cup of Nations and having the talent to go far in both tournaments, so ensuring they will be represented with kits that fans feel a connection to is imperative. Having made history as the first African team to reach the semi-final of a World Cup, the kits are a nod to their national history. Abderrahmane Trabsini, born and raised in Amsterdam, was inspired by the beauty of Moroccan and Berber craftsmanship in creating the Moroccan kits. Encapsulating the essence of Moroccan artistry, the Home kit features patterns inspired by traditional Moroccan zellige tiles, with intricate geometric designs symbolizing unity, eternity, and artisanship. Trabsini also incorporated Berber symbols often seen in Moroccan rugs into the Away kit, with motifs representing protection, fertility, and harmony. These elements connect deeply with Moroccan heritage, adding cultural depth to the design. The vibrant red and green palette reflects the national flag, while the inclusion of the indigenous language honors Morocco’s rich history. The new Senegal Home jersey encompasses the theme of ‘Teranga’ – the spirit of hospitality. The kit’s design draws inspiration from the nation’s workers, reflecting a fearless and progressive identity expressed through modern art and culture. This results in a clean strip with accents in the colors of the national flag. The Away kit however takes a bolder approach, with a green and lime palette that incorporates a lion print across the chest, inspired by the country’s art and design.",2024-11-15

After teasing the jerseys on National Teddy Bear Day all the way back in September, the P-Bruins finally unveiled them on their social media channels on Wednesday, November 13.

It also flips the logos, moving the “pooh bear” logo from the shoulders to the front of the jersey, swapping places with the spoked-P. White and black stripes run around the waist. Inside each black arm stripe are gold numbers with white outlines, along with truncated white and gold stripes. None of the materials that accompanied Wednesday’s announcement showed the names and numbers on the back of the jersey, but it’s safe to assume both will be mainly black. The logo of sponsor Amica Insurance sits on the right chest. Players modeling the new alternate jersey in photos also wore black helmets, gloves and pants. Socks were not visible in any of the promotional materials. Like their NHL parent club in Boston, the P-Bruins wore gold socks with the 90s/2000s black jerseys these new alternates are based on. Gold socks are a distinct possibility, but if the “color flip” theme continues, then they could also be black.

The club unveiled the logo on their website and social media channels on Friday, November 15, and then celebrated with supporters at an event at a park in Burleigh Heads, a suburb of the city of Gold Coast, Queensland. They also kicked off a new marketing campaign branding themselves as “Fearless” as they head into their 14th AFL season. Fearless. pic.twitter.com/XMrWpMPwXn The centerpiece of the Suns’ new brand is the new primary logo. It’s comprised of three key elements, according to the club: There are also subtle G and C characters hidden in the design, “a nod to our history and original logo. Together, these elements capture who we are, where we’ve come from, and what we strive for on and off the field.” “We knew after 14 years with the same brand that it was time to update our look and feel to better represent how we have evolved and matured as a football club,” said Suns CEO Mark Evans. “Our new logo is modern, bold and innovative, with layers of context which speak to our history and purpose. We’re excited to show the world our new brand, and tomorrow we will reveal our new guernsey and colour palette, marking the start of our new era.” Along with the logo, the Suns unveiled their new guernseys, made by New Balance, for the 2024-25 AFL season. They’re mostly red, with a tonal version of the primary logo on the chest. Curving tonal pinstripes adorn the sides of the guernsey and extend onto the shorts, where a pale gold version of the logo is placed on the left leg. Numbers on the back of the guernseys are the same shade of pale gold. The Suns joined the AFL in 2011, and this is the first time they’ve done a major overhaul on their visual identity. Their previous logo was a red oval with a yellow outline, the letters “GC” inside in yellow and a blue shadow. “SUNS” was written out in red underneath, arching to match the curve of the ball. An alternate version featured sun rays emanating from the center of the football. The Suns are the second of three AFL teams who were reported to be unveiling new logos this offseason to do so. The Adelaide Crows unveiled a new logo but no guernseys earlier this month. The third reportedly changing up their logo is St. Kilda Football Club, based in Melbourne. The Suns open their 2025 AFL Premiership season at home against the Essendon Bombers on Saturday, March 8.",2024-11-15

On Thursday, November 14, the NLL unveiled 13 new community identities for its UnBOXed program, which aims to introduce young boys and girls to the game of lacrosse in their gym classes. These are not expansion teams, but the NLL hopes these identities and community-relevant names will help engage people in these markets and encourage them to participate in the UnBOXed program. They also hope they “illustrate the League’s commitment to growing box lacrosse across Canada and the United States” as they work toward their goal of becoming the “next major league.” “NLL UnBOXed illustrates our bold approach and dedicated commitment to growing the game of lacrosse and welcoming new NLL fans to our uniquely entertaining sport. As we invite and welcome more communities, schools, families, and fans to the NLL, while strengthening our connections in these key areas throughout North America, we move one step closer to our goal of becoming ‘The Next Major League.’” The NLL hopes to expand its activation footprint to 60 communities across North America by the time the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles roll around. Those games will include sixes lacrosse — a format similar to the box lacrosse played in the NLL — as a medal sport for the first time since 1908. The NLL is also part of the Elevate 28 initiative, which aims to increase the number of people participating in lacrosse in the U.S. to 4 million by 2030. The 13 new UnBOXed identities, combined with the 14 current NLL franchises, bring the league’s total activation footprint to 36 markets throughout North America. Here’s a closer look at the new identities, with all graphics courtesy of the NLL’s Facebook page: The initial nine UnBOXed identities were launched in November 2023. Since then, though, the St. Louis entry changed its name from the Rhythm to the Howlers, and with the Ottawa Black Bears joining the NLL, the Ottawa Electrics became the Dallas Oilcats, an identity that uses elements of the now-defunct Panther City Lacrosse Club logo. The 2024-25 NLL regular season gets underway on Friday, November 29, with two games. A new Battle of Ontario will spark up with the Ottawa Black Bears playing host to the Toronto Rock, while the Vancouver Warriors visit the Colorado Mammoth later that evening.",2024-11-14

The Nittany Lions launched the uniforms on their website and social media channels on Wednesday, November 13, and will wear them on the ice for the first time against Big Ten rivals Wisconsin on Friday, November 15. The jerseys borrow heavily from the Nittany Lions’ look in the 1940s, when Penn State’s hockey program was first founded. The white base has navy blue shoulders and a navy blue “PS” monogram on the front. Navy barberpole-style stripes adorn the sleeves and the socks. The navy blue numbers on the sleeves and back “mimics the number font used on the Generations of Greatness football jerseys,” while the contrasting nameplate on the back is navy blue with white lettering. The retro look is rounded out by brown pants and gloves. The pants also feature an interlocking “PSU” logo used in the 1970s that has a puck between the P and the S. The helmets are navy blue, with a raised white “Penn State” logo on the sides and white player numbers on the front. For captains, the C appears in a navy blue keystone on the right chest. “Penn State’s ice hockey tradition began well before we ever had a Division I program and we owe a debt of gratitude to those previous eras for establishing the foundation of Hockey Valley,” Nittany Lions head coach Guy Gadowsky said on the team’s website. “These throwback uniforms represent the different periods that helped build our program into what it is today and it’s our way of giving those teams a stick tap to the shins to express our appreciation to everyone that laid the foundation for the modern era of Penn State Hockey.” Old Time Hockey! 😤#HockeyValley pic.twitter.com/chvGMCj1wN Penn State played its first varsity hockey game on December 6, 1940, against Carnegie Tech. The program continued for four seasons until it was cut — along with cross country, swimming, gymnastics, tennis and golf — as part of cost-cutting measures during the Second World War. It returned for one season in 1946, but limited facilities meant it was once again dropped. In 1971, 3,000 people signed a petition to bring hockey back to Penn State. The team — dubbed the Icers — played 41 seasons and won seven national championships before the Division I era began in 2012. As a pure “start-up” team, it seemed too gaudy for them to display the name Penn State on the first jerseys. Thus, a custom logo was designed as a unique moniker for the front of the jersey. A creative, stylized amalgamation of letters and hockey imagery, the logo features the initials of Penn State University with two hockey sticks surrounding a puck in the negative space between the letters. The artist responsible for the design, a Penn State student, has remained anonymous despite multiple efforts. Following Friday’s game against Wisconsin — the first of a six-game homestand for Penn State — these alternate uniforms will enter their jersey lineup “as a true alternate to be worn multiple times throughout the next few seasons.”",2024-11-14

Valencia players will wear their black away kits at home on Saturday, November 23, when they host Real Betis. The all-black uniform is meant as “a sign of respect for those who died due to the DANA catastrophe and in solidarity with all those affected.” More than 200 people in the Valencia region died in late October when a destructive weather system known locally as DANA — the Spanish acronym for high-altitude isolated depression — moved through the area, causing torrential rainfall and massive flooding. Valencia’s usual front-of-shirt sponsor has given up their space for the November 23 game, and their logo will be replaced by the motto “AMUNT VALENCIANS” (“Come on, Valencians”). Printed on the back, below the player number, will be another motto: “UNITS CON SEMPRE” (“United as Always”). The black away kit, made by Puma, features an embossed pattern that reimagines the city of Valencia’s flag and its “distinctive blue band filigree as a subtle background pattern on a sleek black shirt with elegant gold accents.” Game-worn jerseys will be auctioned off online afterwards through MatchWornShirt. Proceeds from the auction will go to “help resume sporting and educational activities for children affected by the DANA crisis.” The game against Real Betis will be Valencia CF’s first match since the DANA tragedy. An away match against RCD Espanyol scheduled for Sunday, November 9, was postponed. Puma and Valencia CF have also teamed up to offer a solidarity T-shirt for sale, with proceeds again going toward sports and educational activities for children affected by the storm. It features the “UNITS CON SEMPRE” motto on the front and a list of cities and towns affected by flooding on the back. The shirt is available through Valencia’s online store and through Puma.com.",2024-11-14

As part of the series, the Nets will take on the alternate identity of “Les Nets” during their six Quebec-based games. The team’s temporary red-and-blue logo features two fleur-de-lis on a blue circle, a nod to the Quebec flag. A large red circle within the blue includes Montreal’s Mount Royal cross, stylized to represent a basketball while incorporating the city name. The incorporation of red isn’t because the Long Island Nets typically use red (I mean, of course, it is); it’s a tribute to Montreal’s McGill University, where James Naismith, the inventor of basketball, taught in the 1880s. “Montreal has a vibrant basketball legacy, and this partnership presents a unique opportunity to blend our culture with the Laval community,” said Morgan Taylor, Head of Business Operations for the Long Island Nets, in the press release. “We look forward to engaging with a new fanbase and creating memorable moments both on and off the court.” The arrangement brings up memories of the unique situation Minor League Baseball’s Buffalo Bisons found themselves in during the 2021 season. With their MLB affiliate from Toronto residing in their home stadium due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Bisons shifted their home games to Trenton, NJ. They played with a split identity, using their usual Bisons name and uniforms on the road but taking on that of the Trenton Thunder at home.

FC Barcelona announced the new “multi-year partnership agreement” on their website on Saturday, November 9. The club said the deal “brings a new collaborative strategic partnership model between the two organizations.” This new partnership consolidates Nike as a Main Partner of the Club and Official Technical Partner across all professional and amateur teams, bringing a unique model that strengthens the brands association and fuels the global retail and licensing business growth. Nike has a key strategic role in the Club’s Retail Operations and together with Barça Licensing & Merchandising will join forces in the development of specific plans related to product creation, supply chain and global distribution.   Nike has outfitted Barça since 1998. Since then, Barça’s men’s first team has won four Champions League titles, 12 La Liga titles, seven Copas del Rey, three World Club Cups and three European Super Cups wearing Nike uniforms, while the women’s first team has won nine league titles, three UEFA Women’s Champions League titles and nine Copas de la Reina in that time. The terms of the deal between Barça and Nike were not disclosed in Saturday’s announcement, but ESPN reports “the deal will total significantly more than €100 million ($107m) per year, but that the agreement is incremental and that the total amount is also dependent on certain add-ons.” They also report that Barça president Joan Laporte has previously claimed it would be the biggest deal of its kind in world soccer. According to Mundo Deportivo, Barça will receive €1.7 billion over 14 years, or about €121 million per year. It also includes a signing bonus of €158 million, which will also be spread over the 14 years of the contract. Mundo Deportivo also reports that Barça was allowed to field offers from other companies, and they did receive a proposal from German sportswear brand Puma, which Nike then matched. The previous contract between Nike and Barça was set to expire in 2024. There was some friction between the two sides earlier this year, with Footy Headlines reporting in July that a Spanish court had blocked Barça’s attempted to end their contract early. They also reported that retailers were having a hard time ordering Barcelona products from Nike, and Barça’s 2024-25 third kit celebrating women’s sport was released about three weeks later than similar third kits for other high-profile clubs outfitted by Nike.",2024-11-10

The Smokies, who play in the Southern League, announced this week that with their return to their once and future hometown, the team will change its geographic designation from Tennessee to Knoxville. With that announcement came an armful of updated logos—though their familiar bear character, originally created by Dan Simon of Studio Simon in 2015, remains largely unchanged. The new suite of logos, design in house, includes a series of type-based marks as well as an alternate mark featuring three stars from the Tennessee state flag. “With the upcoming move to Knoxville, it is imperative to embrace our new home, while maintaining the Smokies brand,” said Boyd Sports President Chris Allen, quoted on MiLB.com. “It is our desire that the new logo honors the city of Knoxville and the rich tradition of Smokies Baseball.” The franchise played in Knoxville from 1921 to 1999 under a handful of names, including the Pioneers (1921–1924), Sox (1972–1979), Blue Jays (1980–1992), and two stints as the Knoxville Smokies (1925–1967 and 1993–1999). After the 1999 season, the team moved 20 miles east to the town of Kodak, where they played from 2000 to 2024 as the Tennessee Smokies.

The logo on the side of the shorts matches the center-court logo at The Summit, Houston’s home from 1975-2003.

The Rangers unveiled the jerseys on their website and social media accounts on Friday, November 8, making this the 19th straight season the team has produced a Remembrance Day jersey. This year’s edition commemorates the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Normandy — better known as D-Day — which took place on June 6, 1944. The base of the jersey is royal blue, with grey, red and white stripes around each sleeve and the waist. The front of the jersey features a shield “based on imagery of soldiers entering the battle on the beaches of Normandy,” according to the Rangers’ website. Above the blue soldier rushing off a landing craft is the inscription “1944-2024”, while three red maple leaves swirl around the soldier. The 1944 Battle of Normandy was one of the pivotal events of the Second World War and the scene of some of Canada’s greatest feats of arms. Canadian sailors, soldiers and airmen played a critical role in the Allied invasion of Normandy, also called Operation Overlord, beginning the bloody campaign to liberate Western Europe from Nazi occupation. Nearly 150,000 Allied troops landed or parachuted into the invasion area on D-Day, including 14,000 Canadians at Juno Beach. The Royal Canadian Navy contributed 124 vessels and 10,000 sailors and the Royal Canadian Air Force contributed 39 squadrons to the operation. Total Allied casualties on D-Day reached more than 10,000, including 1,096 Canadians, of whom 381 were killed in action. By the end of the Battle of Normandy, the Allies had suffered 209,000 casualties, including more than 18,700 Canadians. Over 5,000 Canadian soldiers died. A poppy sits on the left chest of the jersey as a symbol of remembrance honoring armed forces personnel who have died in conflict. The left shoulder has a “D-DAY 80” logo while the Rangers’ primary logo sits on the right shoulder. The jersey was pictured with blue pants, gloves and helmets in photos released with Friday’s announcement. The socks are also blue with the same striping as found on the sleeves. The Rangers will wear their Remembrance Day jerseys tonight (Friday, November 8) when they host the Soo Greyhounds at the Kitchener Memorial Auditorium. It’s their only home game this Remembrance Day weekend, as they visit the Owen Sound Attack on Saturday and the Oshawa Generals on Sunday. Rangers fans can purchase game-worn Remembrance Day jerseys through a silent auction that will run throughout Friday’s game. Five of the jerseys will also be available for auction online through DASH. Proceeds from both auctions will benefit the 78th Fraser Highlanders Fort Conestoga Garrison and the Kitchener-Waterloo Poppy Fund.",2024-11-08

The nod goes to the Chiefs right now because they are the reigning Super Bowl champs and the only undefeated team left in the NFL. But the Lions are right there with the champs after posting an 8-1 record, and they have looked very good in the process. And, with wins over the Minnesota Vikings and Green Bay Packers, Detroit has cemented itself as the best team in the NFC. However, one NFL Hall of Famer and analyst doesn't subscribe to that. During the Thursday Night Football pregame show on Amazon Prime, former tight end tight end Tony Gonzalez made the stunning claim that the Philadelphia Eagles, not the Lions, are the best team in the conference. He then doubled down on that take following the game when given an opportunity to walk it back. Here's what Gonzalez said. ""I'm still going to stand by that,"" Gonzalez said. ""Detroit Lions, obviously, and I've said they were really, really good, but Jared Goff, I know it was just one game. But I just look (at the Eagles), offense, defense — they need a kicker (Jake Elliot), something's got to happen with that kicker because he's got to play better than that — but I think (the Eagles) are the best team in the NFC.""

Philly is also in the midst of a six-game win streak. However, the Lions have been a step better than the Eagles all season long and are currently on a seven-game winning streak. The Lions have also had a tougher slate, with Detroit beating four teams that currently sport a winning record, while the Eagles have beaten just two.

Victoria called Trey Owens a “strong” candidate to be Manning’s understudy once Quinn Ewers vacates the starting job next season. “Owens’ senior season saw him complete 222 of 313 passes for 3,303 yards and 43 touchdowns, earning District 17-6A Offensive MVP honors. His leadership propelled Cy-Fair to an 11-2 record, a district title, and a playoff run. Owens is known for his consistency, poise, and ability to deliver in high-pressure moments, qualities that make him a strong candidate for QB2,” Victoria wrote. “Owens did see a few snaps this year during the UTSA game at DKR. He completed for 19 yards, and completed about half of the passes he threw for. He is still worthy of a start, in the event, Arch is unavailable or needs the rest. After all, he was recruited by Sarkisian for a reason.” Owens, like Ewers, is a product of the Longhorn State. The former Cypress Hill star doesn’t have an extensive scouting report from his high school days on 247 Sports but he was the Texas District 17-6A Offensive MVP his junior and senior season. His lack of pedigree does make you wonder if he’s truly the Manning successor plan, though. FanSided’s Lior Lampert predicts Manning will stay in college longer than stars from the past tended to because of the lack of successful players who left school early in recent NFL draft classes. “Knowing the quarterback rookie-scale contract window is a time to maximize a franchise's Super Bowl efforts in today's league, the margin for error is slim. Because of this, organizations like the Colts (and Panthers) take drastic measures, ostensibly cutting their losses prematurely,” Lampert prefaced before saying, “With that in mind and time on his side, Manning can reconsider what path he wants to take. “As many expected, the beginning of Richardson's NFL career has been turbulent, with more valleys than peaks. Not only was he never considered a finished product throughout the draft evaluation process, but his status as a raw albeit tantalizing prospect was widely known. Thus far, it's panned out that way to a tee. Yet, rather than letting him experience the growing pains, the Colts are pivoting to Flacco. Someone in Manning's camp is surely keeping tabs on this and thinking about how it may impact his impending future.” Manning is clearly the long-term plan in Austin. Will Owens stick around for at least three more seasons as a backup given his decorated high school career and the potential he may have to thrive at a smaller school?

Kiyan Anthony, Carmelo's 17-year-old son, announced his college decision on Friday, committing to Syracuse, the same school his father went to. The newest recruit for the Orange chose dad's alma mater over schools such as USC.  Anthony is a well-known name thanks to his father's outstanding NBA career, which included 10 All-Star selections and more than 28,000 points, but he's a highly-touted recruit in his own right.

Though quarterback Jared Goff had his worst game of the season in Week 10, tossing five interceptions, Detroit still came away with a 26-23 road victory over the Houston Texans and clawed back from a 23-7 deficit.  One of the primary reasons the Lions are one of the best teams in football and will compete for the Lombardi Trophy this season and for years to come is their masterful drafting. General manager Brad Holmes has done an excellent job building his team through the draft and hitting on Day 2 and 3 picks, including safeties Brian Branch and Kerby Joseph, defensive tackle Alim McNeill, and wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, just to name a few.  With Detroit atop the NFC conference and contenders to win the Super Bowl, Holmes and his front office will likely have one of the final picks in Round 1 of the 2025 NFL Draft. Though April's draft is still months away, analysts have started constructing their mock drafts and who they believe would be seamless fits on the Lions. Vinnie Iyer, Sporting News: EDGE Jack Sawyer, Ohio State Iyer: ""Sawyer has the relentlessness to fit the Lions' current aggressive makeup, and Aaron Glenn would like his chess-piece ability to help well beyond the complementary pass rush for Aidan Hutchinson."" Josh Edwards, CBS Sports: EDGE Landon Jackson, Arkansas Edwards: ""The acquisition of Za'Darius Smith probably eliminates pass rush as a need for the Lions this off-season, but there is a scenario in which they overinvest because of the predicament they have found themselves in the past few years."" Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz, USA TODAY: OT/G Jonah Savaiinaea, Arizona Middlehurst-Schwartz: ""With Kevin Zeitler playing on a one-year contract and turning 35 in March, Detroit might be due for a change to a front that has paved the way for the league's second-highest scoring attack. With his massive frame (6-5, 330 pounds) and punishing approach, Savaiinaea is a natural fit to move back to guard after starting his career there prior to a switch to right tackle."" Luke Easterling, Athlon Sports: EDGE JT Tuimoloau, Ohio State Easterling: ""This was a fit I loved heading into the 2024 draft before Tuimoloau ultimately decided to return for another year with the Buckeyes. I still love it now, as the Lions desperately need another high-quality edge defender who can make plays on all three downs against both the run and pass.

Kiyan is a senior at national powerhouse Long Island Lutheran High School (LuHi) and the son of 10-time All-Star Carmelo Anthony. Thanks in large part to the power of social media, Kiyan Anthony quickly made a name for himself as a basketball prospect in the high school class of 2025. While the name and familial connection undoubtedly are the draw for many, Anthony is carving his own lane as a player. As 247Sports' 32nd-ranked prospect in his high school class, Anthony garnered interest from many major college programs before cutting his list to USC and Syracuse, his father's alma mater. As Anthony embarks upon his senior year and makes his college decision, take a closer look at his profile and potential as a player.  SN's NBA HQ: Live NBA scores | Updated NBA standings | Full NBA schedule The scoring gene was certainly passed down a generation. At 6-5 and 185 pounds, Anthony does not have his father's frame, but he possesses a similar knack for putting the ball in the basket, albeit in a much different manner. While playing for his father's eponymous AAU team during the Nike EYBL (Elite Youth Basketball League) in 2024, Anthony averaged 19.6 points and 4.6 rebounds per game. The 2024 summer circuit also saw the 17-year-old earn an invite to the NBPA Top 100 camp in Orlando. Anthony started the camp off with a bang, scoring 42 points on 15-of-28 shooting, including 4-of-9 shooting from deep. He went on to lead all campers in scoring by averaging 28.5 points over eight games.  It's clear Anthony is not shy about looking for his shot. He's aggressive on the ball as a driver and with his pull-up jumpers. Despite a slight frame, Anthony has a way of finishing through contact from his peers. Anthony's role is slightly different at LuHi. As a junior he took a backseat to senior All-American VJ Edgecombe. This year, Anthony will share many responsibilities with Penn State commit Kayden Mingo. This upcoming season will provide Anthony with an opportunity to showcase his abilities to contribute within a more structured system. Much of Anthony's most glaring weaknesses could be attributed to his age.  He finds ways to finish through contact but his slight frame can also be a hindrance on both ends of the floor. He'll need to add muscle to compete with older, stronger players and not be a net negative on the defensive end, especially at the next level. As talented of a scorer as he is, Anthony sometimes toes the line of earning the ""chucker"" label. Impressive as his 42-point performance was at the NBPA Top 100 Camp, Anthony also turned in these notable performances: Such is often the nature of elite camp settings, but it isn't always indicative of good habits. Anthony still got his numbers because of his ability to get to the line, but shooting nearly 40 times is rarely a good look. That said, Anthony is 17, and, like most 17-year-old players, he will see his game mature as he grows. He has sneaky athleticism that can allow him to make a difference on the defensive end, but that is something else he'll need to put together. Being the son of an NBA player has given Anthony an advantage in his ability to get in the gym with and play against bigger, stronger, NBA players. If applied correctly, that work can pay off. At the collegiate level, Anthony's status as a four-star recruit goes out the window. To get on the floor as a freshman for a major program, he'll need to star in his role, play efficiently, and do the dirty work.

It's a good time for them to not have to play again for 10 days.,"Ryan McCafferty The Washington Commanders' 26-18 loss on Thursday night against the Philadelphia Eagles marked their second loss in five days, dropping them to 7-4 on the 2024 season. Now, the Commanders will have a ""mini-bye,"" as they won't be back in action again until Nov. 24 when they take on the Dallas Cowboys back at home. That gives Washington an opportunity to regroup, and it's one they desperately need. Not only have the Commanders lost two straight, but injuries have piled up as well. Newly acquired CB Marshon Lattimore has yet to suit up for the team in two opportunities. Starting kicker Austin Seibert has missed the past two contests as well, and perhaps his absence played a role in Dan Quinn deciding to go for it on fourth down late in Thursday's game instead of kicking a potential go-ahead field goal. Most crucially of all, though, is the health of quarterback Jayden Daniels. Daniels hasn't missed a game, but ever since hurting his ribs against the Carolina Panthers, he has not looked quite right -- particularly as a runner. After rushing for an average of 53.1 yards in the season's first seven games, he's averaged only 27.5 yards in the past four. Daniels' accuracy has also been off. In four games since his injury, he hasn't had a performance in which he's completed more than 70 percent of his pass attempts. He had five such performances in the first seven games, though granted one of them was the Panthers game in which he went a grand total of 2-for-2 before leaving the field. Daniels will need to use the extended time off to refresh himself both physically and mentally. There are always growing pains for any young player, and for Daniels and the Commanders, perhaps this miniature skid can prove to be a blessing in disguise. Early on in the season, it seemed like Washington could do no wrong. That was never going to last all year, and now the team must adjust to adversity. Ideally for the Commanders, when they suit up against Dallas, they'll be doing so as a healthier team with a mindset of having more to prove.

Sporting News RSS,Michael Pittman Jr. injury update: Latest news on Colts wide receiver in Week 11,https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/indianapolis-colts/news/michael-pittman-jr-injury-update-latest-news-colts-week-11/ea193749cdfbb95d545f19cb,"Fri, 15 Nov 2024 22:25:16 +0000",Here is the latest injury update for Indianapolis Colts WR Michael Pittman Jr. in Week 11.,"Kevin Hickey The Indianapolis Colts (4-6) are looking to turn their season around amid a three-game losing streak, and they've been without a big piece of the offense in recent weeks. Though wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. has technically only missed one game this season, he's dealt with a combination of back and finger injuries over the last month. It was initially reported that Pittman was a candidate to go on the Reserve/Injured list due to a back injury, but the 27-year-old opted to play through the injury. However, Pittman wound up suffering a finger injury in Week 9, which ultimately forced the Colts to give him a game off to heal, making him inactive for the Week 10 loss against the Buffalo Bills. Here's the latest update on Pittman's injury going into Week 11: Seemingly healed from his finger injury, Pittman was only listed with a back injury on the team's injury report leading into the Week 11 matchup against the New York Jets. The former second-round pick was a full participant throughout the entire week of practice, which is a great sign for his chances to return to his typical role as a starter. Pittman was not given a designation on the final injury report, suggesting he will at least be active for the game. Whether he's still dealing with the back injury in terms of a pain tolerance issue is another question entirely. Either way, the Colts will have their full stable of weapons for Anthony Richardson, who was named the starter again after a two-game absence due to the team's decision to bench him. Hickey was previously the managing editor of USA Today's Colts Wire. His work is also featured as a fantasy football analyst for The Huddle. A career .232 hitter, he is an avid reader of Spider-Man comics, an admirer of the James Webb Space Telescope, and a keen enthusiast of Ma’s sauce.

Whether it was the media hyping up the development of Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren or highlighting how much the team upgraded in the offseason, people felt this would be OKC's year. However, in their Sunday, Nov. 10 matchup against the Golden State Warriors, all of those hopes went down the drain. With star center Chet Holmgren suffering a rare hip injury, the Thunder are now tasked with playing without any center for quite some time... or are they? On a recent episode of Timberwolves and Celtics legend Kevin Garnett's podcast, 'All the Smoke Productions', he sat down with former Lakers center Dwight Howard and discussed a variety of different topics. One such topic being the OKC Thunder and their big man problem. In the midst of the discussion, Howard can be seen looking right at the camera (or audience) with quite the statement towards Loud City: OKC. Your boy. Is ready. What's happening? With Garnett hyping of the idea, Howard was of course alluding to the fact that he is ready to come back to the NBA and help out the OKC Thunder. He would later go on to say that OKC needs a veteran big man that not only brings the energy, but that can also play elite defense alongside the Thunder's superstars. While the idea may seem far-fetched, it is somewhat plausible. Back in the bubble season, the Los Angeles Lakers won the 2019/2020 NBA Finals, a team that not only had Howard, but current Thunder guard Alex Caruso. Howard would not only have that connection and championship experience, but would easily fit into the culture and chemistry of the team given his personality. While Howard has probably not picked up the rock in a while given he just came off of his run with the television show Dancing With the Stars, being able to sign a multi-time DPOY for the minimum until the main OKC centers get back may be a blessing in disguise.   🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️ @okcthunder ⁰⁰Dwight Howard is game-ready 👀Stay on the lookout for more from Ticket & @DwightHoward: https://t.co/hKGMgsx9eY pic.twitter.com/a2vb0Yu96e   OKC Thunder vs. Phoenix Suns: Two of the best teams out West dual it out in Loud City Thunder options to replace Chet Holmgren: Trade targets and internal replacements to address hip injury OKC Thunder officially release their 2024/25 City Edition uniforms Brody Bitters is a graduate from Butler University, where he studied Sports Media and Strategic Communications for four years.

European champions Spain are defending the title they won in 2022/23.,"Dom Farrell Spain will seek to continue a golden era in the 2024/25 edition of the UEFA Nations League. Luis de la Fuente's side produced a dazzling performance at Euro 2024, sweeping to a fourth European title as they won all seven of their matches in Germany. If that launches a spell of dominance comparable to La Roja's three consecutive major tournament wins between 2008 and 2012, it could be traced back to the 2022/23 Nations League, when Spain put an underwhelming 2022 FIFA World Cup behind them. After topping a group featuring Portugal, Spain and Czechia, Spain beat Italy in the semifinals before overcoming Croatia on penalties in the final, Rotterdam's De Kuip having witnessed 120 tense, goalless minutes. That progression from the group stage straight to the Finals will no longer exist, with UEFA introducing an interim knockout round for the first time in 2024/25. Read on for all you need to know about the UEFA Nations League, including fixtures, results and format, along with what the results in these matches mean when it comes to qualification for the 2026 World Cup. MORE: How Spain beat England to win the Euro 2024 final The UEFA Nations League is split into its now familiar four-tiered league system, with teams playing each other home and away in the round-robin phase. Teams in League A — which, like League B and League C, is divided into four groups of four — will compete for the overall title. Countries that finish bottom of their section in League A and League B will be relegated to the league below. Similarly, teams coming top in League B and League C are automatically promoted for the 2026/27 edition. The main change to the format for 2024/25 is a quarterfinals and playoffs phase that will take place in the March 2025 international break. Previously this was reserved exclusively for World Cup or European Championship qualification matches. In the first three editions of the Nations League, the top team from each League A group progressed to the Finals. Now, the top two from each group will contest two-legged quarterfinals.  Additionally, teams that finish third in League A and League B groups will face runners-up from League B and League C groups respectively in two-legged promotion/relegation playoffs during the same international break. League D comprises two groups of three and therefore runs a slightly different match schedule. The winners of League D1 and D2 will be automatically promoted to League C, with the two worst last-place teams across the four League C groups taking their place. The other last-place League C teams will contest promotion/relegation playoffs with the two League D runners-up in promotion/relegation playoffs slated for March 2026. The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the first edition of the tournament with entry expanded from 32 to 48 teams. The number of UEFA slots is up from 13 to 16, which persuaded European football's governing body to tweak its qualifying format. It will now coexist alongside the Nations League's quarterfinals and playoffs round in March 2025. Teams will compete in 12 World Cup qualifying groups, with the winners of each advancing automatically to the 2026 tournament. The runners-up will advance to the playoffs, along with the four best-ranked 2024/25 Nations League group winners that have finished outside the top two in their World Cup qualifying group. This is the same Nations League qualification route that has existed in previous editions of the tournament. The additional impact of the Nations League upon World Cup qualification this time around is that teams involved in the quarterfinals or relegation/promotion playoffs will be placed in four-team WCQ groups, playing their first matches in September 2025. By that time, nations not involved in the additional Nations League round will already have played four World Cup qualifiers across March and June 2025 as they will make up the four five-team groups.

The 25-year-old Dutchman’s lengthy injury layoff has been marked by setbacks, personal tragedies, and even wild conspiracy theories about his whereabouts. Malacia enjoyed a breakout debut season at Old Trafford in 2022-23, making 39 appearances in all competitions. However, a seemingly minor left knee issue he picked up towards the end of the campaign has kept him sidelined ever since. “I didn’t expect me to do less because I know what I can do,” Malacia said of his first year at United. The very first signing of the Erik ten Hag era proved a reliable, dependable presence, often starting ahead of first-choice Luke Shaw. The problem was a tear in Malacia’s left meniscus. After initial rest and rehabilitation did not resolve the issue, he underwent surgery in July 2023. But further complications arose, forcing him to have a second procedure that reset his recovery timeline. “We had a lot of injuries and my injury needed a lot of attention,” Malacia explained. “So with the medical part, at some point we decided, ‘OK, you need some extra people around you to help you, to be there working with you every day to focus only on you.'” As Malacia’s absence dragged on, wild speculation about his status ran rampant on social media, with some suggesting he had died or even run away with the Princess of Wales. The player chose not to address the rumors, saying: “If it wasn’t my cousin or my mum sending me this, I wouldn’t even know.” Behind the scenes, Malacia was dealing with personal difficulties, including his father’s illness and the death of his grandmother, whom he described as his “second mum.” Coping with these challenges while also rehabbing his knee proved immensely difficult. “I think you have to motivate yourself because if you’re not doing that, the world isn’t going to do it for you,” Malacia said. “If I’m not waking up in the morning… if I’m not working hard enough in the gym, my mum, my dad and my sister can’t do it for me.” Now, after 535 days, Malacia is finally close to making his return. He played the first half for United’s under-21s in the EFL Trophy earlier this month and is targeting a comeback to the first team before the end of the season. “I want to bring the team back on top,” Malacia said. “That’s what the standard has to be at Man United. Even though it’s difficult, you always should aim for the top.” About Author I'm a dedicated Sports Journalist with a nose for latest soccer news, a passion for community journalism and a reputation for impeccable ethics.

Garnacho’s 20-yard strike put United 3-0 up, but the 20-year-old Argentine opted for a subdued fist bump rather than an exuberant celebration. This came after a recent incident where Garnacho was criticized by a fan outside Old Trafford following a Europa League clash. The fan had said: “Garnacho, you’ve got to pass better today, yeah, please? Pass better, score a goal and work on your first touch as well, yeah?” To which Garnacho sarcastically responded: “Why you not playing, man?” On The Overlap panel, Keane was baffled by Garnacho’s decision not to celebrate, telling the group: “If you can’t celebrate a goal there’s something drastically wrong in this game. Whatever’s gone on off the pitch for any player, it could be family stuff. When you get a corner you don’t all celebrate, you’re playing a game to score a goal.” However, Wright offered a different perspective, saying: “For a 20-year-old he’s still going through the journey of what he’s doing. That affected him to the point where he didn’t celebrate. We’re not saying that he shouldn’t celebrate.” The debate grew increasingly animated, with Keane insisting Garnacho should have blocked out the noise and celebrated, while Wright argued the player’s mindset was understandable given the recent incident. Keane concluded: “If he worked in a factory, someone would give him stick in the factory. If a young player can’t enjoy scoring a goal for Man United, you know what he should do? Get a job somewhere else.” The contrasting views from the two pundits highlight the complexities surrounding player celebrations and the potential impact of off-field incidents on a footballer’s mindset.

However, according to reports from Relevo, Perez has been underwhelmed by the 23-year-old’s displays in the opening months of the season. This is not the Mbappe that I bought,” Perez is said to have told manager Carlo Ancelotti. The comments harken back to Perez’s previous remarks when Mbappe opted to extend his contract with Paris Saint-Germain, where he had claimed the player was “not my Mbappe. The main concern for Real Madrid is that Mbappe has not taken on a leadership role within the team, despite being touted as the club’s new superstar. The Spanish giants had hoped the French forward would set the tone and guide his teammates, but he has thus far maintained a low profile. “They feel that Mbappe needs to start setting the tone and paving the way for his teammates,” the report states. Real Madrid had encouraged Mbappe to keep a relatively low profile at the start of his tenure, after he had previously irked the club’s fanbase. With Mbappe struggling to make the expected impact, Perez has now openly questioned whether the player he signed is the same one performing on the pitch for Real Madrid.

In a statement, the Bundesliga club said Musk has “converted X into a hate machine” since taking over the platform in 2022. St. Pauli accused the billionaire of allowing “racism and conspiracy theories” to spread unchecked, while “insults and threats are seldom sanctioned.” The club also expressed concern that X would be used to “promote authoritarian, misanthropic and far-right content” during upcoming German elections, “manipulating public discourse.” St. Pauli had already scaled back its X presence, using the platform mainly to make political statements supporting diversity. Now, the club said it is ceasing all activity on X, though its content from the past 11 years will remain online. The announcement makes St. Pauli the first team from Europe’s top five leagues to quit the platform under Musk’s leadership. The club urged its followers to switch to the alternative platform Bluesky. Musk purchased X, then Twitter, for $44 billion in 2022, pledging to promote “free speech.” However, his tenure has been marked by layoffs, the reinstatement of banned accounts, and the proliferation of misinformation, angering many users and advertisers.

The Barcelona legend reached 850 official goals, eclipsing Ronaldo’s previous mark in less matches played. However, Messi’s individual achievement was not enough to prevent his team, Inter Miami, from being eliminated from the 2024 MLS Cup playoffs. The Argentine superstar scored a goal against Atlanta United, but Inter Miami fell 2-3 in the third round of the postseason. To be honest, I have myself to blame: in life, in certain things, in football, on a personal level, I now live in the moment, and I think that’s the most important thing,” Ronaldo recently stated, acknowledging Messi’s accomplishment. While Ronaldo still holds the overall record (908), Messi reached his milestone in 1,081 matches, compared to Ronaldo’s 1,179. Messi also boasts more individual accolades, with eight Ballon d’Or titles and eight FIFA World’s Best Player awards, compared to Ronaldo’s five each. In their head-to-head record, Messi has 15 wins, nine draws, and 10 defeats against Ronaldo in competitive club matches. The two superstars have not faced each other in recent years, as they have both moved away from European football. Despite Messi’s historic achievement, his focus remains on helping Inter Miami achieve success in the MLS. The team’s elimination from the playoffs this season will only fuel Messi’s determination to lead the club to greater heights in the future.

<h1>Mikko Rantanen's Hat Trick Fuels Avalanche's Victory Over Kings</h1>
<p>Mikko Rantanen delivered a stunning double strike in the final period, leading to his ninth career hat trick, propelling the <a href=""https://21sports.com/avalanche-overcomes-hurricanes-a-dramatic-halt-to-carolinas-winning-streak/"">Colorado Avalanche</a> to a 4-2 triumph over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/los-angeles-kings-emerge-victorious-in-dominant-performance-against-columbus-blue-jackets/"">Los Angeles Kings</a> on Wednesday night. Rantanen's ten-minute mark goal, his second of the evening, handed Colorado the edge in the third period and he rounded off his stellar performance with a vacant net goal with less than two minutes to spare, making it his second hat trick of the season.</p>
<h2>Other Standout Performances</h2>
<p><a href=""https://21sports.com/lehkonens-power-play-triumph-lifts-avalanche-over-kraken-in-thrilling-6-3-victory/"">Artturi Lehkonen</a> also found the net, while goaltender Alexandar Georgiev stopped 13 attempts for the Avalanche. The star-studded performance of Nathan MacKinnon, who contributed three assists, deserves a special mention. MacKinnon has managed to score points in 16 of the 17 games this season, including all 10 home games.</p>
<p>In the Kings' camp, goaltender Darcy Kuemper blocked 18 shots before an apparent injury forced him to retreat early in the third period. David Rittich, who took over, completed the game with three saves. Adrian Kempe was the standout for the Kings, scoring twice, with his first goal coming only 32 seconds into the game.</p>
<h3>Game Highlights</h3>
<p>Lehkonen equalized at the 3:40 mark of the first period, but Kempe capitalized on a Colorado blunder to score again with just over four minutes left in the opening period. Rantanen's equalizer came with less than four minutes remaining in the second period.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>The Kings failed to make a shot on goal in the second period, with their first shot in over 23 minutes coming just 55 seconds into the third period, thanks to Kevin Fiala's attempt off the right post. On the other hand, the Avalanche's power play seemed off form all night. They struggled to make a shot on goal in their first three man-advantages, failing to generate any momentum.</p>
<h3>Game-Changing Moment</h3>
<p>It was a key moment when Logan O’Connor fought off two Kings players along the boards, allowing MacKinnon to retrieve the puck and backhand it to Rantanen, who then beat Rittich to put Colorado in the lead.</p>
<h2>Historic Milestone</h2>
<p>Notably, this game marked Jared Bednar's 635th as coach of the Avalanche, surpassing Michel Bergeron to become the franchise's longest-serving coach.</p>
<h3>What's Next?</h3>
<p>The Kings are set to host Detroit on Saturday, while the Avalanche will finish a four-game homestand on Friday, hosting Washington.</p>

<h1>The Toronto Maple Leafs Execute a Stunning Reversal Against the Washington Capitals</h1>
<p>In a dramatic twist, Mitch Marner initiated the final countdown in the third period, leading to John Tavares' overtime clincher that saw the <a href=""https://21sports.com/marner-propels-maple-leafs-to-victory-over-canadiens-a-hockey-night-recap/"">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> overturn a two-goal deficit to triumph over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/capitals-dominate-blues-in-8-1-rout-ovechkin-and-mcmichael-shine/"">Washington Capitals</a> with a 4-3 scoreline on Wednesday night.</p>
<h2>William Nylander: The Catalyst of the Comeback</h2>
<p>The resurgence of the Leafs was ignited by William Nylander's crucial goal, scored with just over four minutes remaining. Nylander also played a key role in Marner's 6-on-4 power play goal, scored with a mere 47.8 seconds left in the regular game time, while the Leafs' goaltender, Joseph Woll, was replaced by an additional skater and Washington's Nic Dowd was in the penalty box.</p>
<p>Nylander's remarkable performance came just a day after his early turnover set the Leafs on the path to a lackluster shutout loss at home against Ottawa.</p>
<h2>Capital's Early Lead and Subsequent Collapse</h2>
<p>The Capitals initially had a strong hold on the game, leading 3-1 courtesy of goals from Taylor Raddysh, Dylan Strome, and Aliaksei Protas. However, a costly turnover by Tom Wilson led to Nylander outmaneuvering Logan Thompson. Dowd's penalty turned out to be one blunder too many, leading to the Capitals' fifth loss in 15 games this season.</p>
<h3>Toronto's Stellar Defense and Washington's Missteps</h3>
<p>Woll successfully deflected 24 of the 27 shots he faced, aiding Toronto's splendid comeback. On the other hand, Thompson, who managed 31 saves, tasted defeat for the first time since his acquisition from Vegas last summer.</p>
<h2>Takeaways from the Game</h2>
<p>In the Leafs' camp, the anticipated reaction from coach Craig Berube and the experienced leadership took its time to emerge. But when push came to shove, the team's top players delivered. As for the Capitals, a promising start to the season was overshadowed by their inability to maintain momentum, resulting in a lackluster third period.</p>
<h3>Deciding Moment and Notable Stat</h3>
<p>The Leafs' control of the puck for the majority of the 3-on-3 OT led to Tavares' winning goal, scored with 46.2 seconds remaining. In another milestone, Leafs' defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson marked his 1,000th regular-season NHL game.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>The Capitals are scheduled to embark on a three-game road trip, starting Friday night at Colorado, while the Leafs prepare to welcome Connor McDavid and the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday night.</p>

<h1>Seattle Kraken Stages Astonishing Second-Period Rally to Overcome Columbus Blue Jackets</h1>
<p>In an extraordinary display of resilience and firepower, the <a href=""https://21sports.com/seattle-kraken-secures-key-player-adam-larsson-with-lucrative-extension-deal/"">Seattle Kraken</a> delivered a stunning comeback by scoring four times in the second period, overcoming a two-goal deficit to triumph over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/los-angeles-kings-emerge-victorious-in-dominant-performance-against-columbus-blue-jackets/"">Columbus Blue Jackets</a> with a 5-2 victory on Tuesday evening.</p>
<h2>Double Strike in Lightning Speed</h2>
<p>The Kraken's Brandon Tanev ignited the comeback by scoring on a breakaway just 7:13 into the pivotal second period. Within a span of 10 seconds, Eeli Tolvanen capitalized on a power-play opportunity to put the Kraken in the lead. The second period further saw Tye Kartye and Will Borgen adding to the Kraken's tally, while Jared McCann sealed the victory with a late empty-net goal.

Goaltender Elvis Merzlikins, while managing to stop 28 shots, could not prevent the Blue Jackets from suffering their sixth consecutive loss.</p>
<h3>Unsung Heroes Rise for the Kraken</h3>

<h1>Pettersson Powers Canucks to a 3-1 Victory Over Flames</h1>
<p>On a Tuesday night showdown, Elias Pettersson emerged as the star of the show, scoring a crucial power-play goal to level the game in the second period and assisting Erik Brannstrom in the third. This double act propelled the <a href=""https://21sports.com/edmonton-oilers-triumph-over-vancouver-canucks-a-night-of-stellar-performances/"">Vancouver Canucks</a> to a solid 3-1 victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/thrilling-shootout-victory-sabres-douse-flames-in-nhl-showdown/"">Calgary Flames</a>. Pius Suter added to the scorecard for the Canucks, while J.T. Miller contributed with a pair of assists.</p>
<h2>Canucks' Wall: Kevin Lankinen Denies Flames with 28 Saves</h2>
<p>Between the pipes, Vancouver's Kevin Lankinen came up big, deflecting 28 shots, ensuring the Flames' efforts were kept in check. For Calgary, Justin Kirkland registered the lone goal, while their netminder, Dan Vladar, recorded 29 saves.</p>
<h3>Brannstrom's Debut Canucks Goal</h3>
<p>Brannstrom found the back of the net for the first time since joining the Canucks in an October 6 trade with Colorado. Fresh from the draft, Swedish rookie Jonathan Lekkerimaki made his Canucks debut, stepping in for the injured Brock Boeser on the first-unit power play. Boeser is currently sidelined with an upper-body injury sustained after a clash with Tanner Jeannot of the Los Angeles Kings.</p>
<h2>Takeaways from the Canucks-Flames Matchup</h2>
<p>Pettersson’s scoring run is noteworthy; following his goal against Edmonton, he has now scored in two consecutive games - a first in his last 50 regular-season games. His last back-to-back scoring streak was a three-game stretch from Jan. 15 to Jan. 20.</p>
<p>The Flames, however, have been struggling recently. After a promising start to their season with five wins in six games, they've won only three times in their last 11 outings (3-6-2).</p>
<h3>The Turning Point</h3>
<p>The Flames initially held a 1-0 lead, scoring at the 19-minute mark of the first period. However, a high-sticking penalty on defenseman Daniil Miromanov just before the period ended proved costly. Pettersson capitalized on this mistake just 23 seconds into the second period, tapping in Miller's shot to equalize. Suter then put the Canucks ahead 2-1 just 2:15 later.</p>
<h2>Noteworthy Statistic</h2>
<p>The Canucks have been conceding the first goal for eight straight games but have managed to turn it around with a 5-2-1 record during this period.</p>
<h3>What's Next?</h3>
<p>The Flames are set to start a four-game homestand against the Predators on Friday, while the Canucks will welcome the Islanders on Thursday.</p>

<h1>Thrilling Overtime Triumph for Oilers Over Islanders</h1>
<p>In an adrenaline-charged NHL face-off, Leon Draisaitl's double-strike, including the decisive goal in overtime, and Connor McDavid's four-point contribution, led the <a href=""https://21sports.com/edmonton-oilers-triumph-over-vancouver-canucks-a-night-of-stellar-performances/"">Edmonton Oilers</a> to a nail-biting 4-3 victory against the <a href=""https://21sports.com/hughes-double-strikes-lead-devils-to-thrilling-overtime-victory-over-islanders/"">New York Islanders</a> on Tuesday night. McDavid, closing in on a career milestone of 1,000 points, demonstrated his exceptional talent by setting up Draisaitl's winning goal 1:52 into overtime.</p>
<h2>Draisaitl and McDavid: The Oilers' Dynamic Duo</h2>
<p>McDavid, with a staggering seven points from his last two games, set up Draisaitl, who skillfully beat Islanders' goaltender Ilya Sorokin from a challenging angle. Evan Bouchard also made a significant contribution for the Oilers with a goal and a couple of assists. While Anders Lee's brace and Kyle Palmieri's net-buster kept the Islanders in the hunt, Draisaitl's overtime heroics ensured the Oilers' victory.</p>
<h3>In the Nets: A Tale of Two Goalies</h3>
<p>The Oilers' Stuart Skinner managed 19 saves, while Sorokin, despite his team's loss, made an impressive 38 stops for the Islanders.</p>
<h2>Islanders' Palmieri Surpasses Nelson and Horvat</h2>
<p>Palmieri, with his goal and assist, advanced past Brock Nelson to become the Islanders' top goal-scorer (with seven goals) and overtook Bo Horvat to amass a team-high 14 points in 16 games.</p>
<h3>McDavid's Approach to Milestone</h3>
<p>McDavid is now just one point shy of becoming the 99th player in NHL history to achieve 1,000 career points. With 658 games under his belt, McDavid is on track to be the fourth-fastest player to reach this significant milestone, trailing only behind hockey legends Wayne Gretzky (424 games), Mario Lemieux (513 games), and Mike Bossy (656 games).</p>
<h2>Turning Point: Islanders' Late Rally</h2>
<p>In a critical moment, the Islanders reversed a two-goal deficit midway through the third period. Jean-Gabriel Pageau set up Lee for his second goal of the match with only 2:41 remaining on the clock, sending the game into overtime.</p>
<h3>One Year On: Coach Knoblauch's Successful Tenure</h3>
<p>It's worth noting that it was exactly a year ago when Oilers' head coach Kris Knoblauch took the reins from Jay Woodcroft. His first NHL coaching experience was against the Islanders the following night. With a 53-25-6 record from his 85 games in charge, Knoblauch's tenure has been highly successful so far.</p>

<h2>David Pastrnak's Last-Minute Heroics Ignite Bruins' Stunning Comeback</h2>
<p>In a thrilling display of resilience, the <a href=""https://21sports.com/tkachuks-overtime-magic-propels-senators-to-victory-over-bruins/"">Boston Bruins</a> overcame a two-goal deficit in the final period, snatching a 3-2 victory from the St. Louis Blues on Tuesday night. The game's defining moment came when David Pastrnak netted the puck with only 1:47 left on the clock. Pastrnak's successful strike from the left circle managed to slip past Jordan Binnington's defenses, barely crossing the goal line.</p>
<h2>Morgan Geekie and Charlie McAvoy Step Up for the Bruins</h2>
<p>Also contributing to the Bruins' fightback were Morgan Geekie and Charlie McAvoy, both of whom found the back of the net during the game. Geekie, who had sat out the previous three games, made a triumphant return to the lineup. Before this game, the Bruins had a dismal record when trailing after the second period, having been outscored 16-5 in the third, and losing all seven games when behind after two periods. However, this victory, their fourth in six games, has proven the team's ability to overturn such statistics.</p>
<h3>Jeremy Swayman's Crucial Role in Bruins' Victory</h3>
<p><a href=""https://21sports.com/the-tug-of-war-contractual-dispute-between-boston-bruins-and-jeremy-swayman-escalates/"">Jeremy Swayman</a>, the Bruins' goaltender, played a crucial role in the team's victory, stopping 20 shots. His performance provided a robust foundation for the team's comeback.</p>
<h2>Blues' Power-Play Drought Ends, but Fails to Secure Victory</h2>
<p>The Blues managed to snap their 21-game power-play drought at home with Brayden Schenn and Oskar Sundqvist successfully netting second-period power-play goals. Despite these achievements and Binnington's 27 saves, the Blues couldn't stave off the Bruins' late surge and suffered their third consecutive loss.</p>
<h3>Key Moments and Statistics from the Game</h3>
<p>The game's momentum shifted when Nathan Walker's shot for the Blues hit the left post early in the third period. Had the shot gone in, the Blues would have taken a commanding 3-0 lead. Instead, less than two minutes later, Geekie scored for the Bruins, starting their comeback.</p>
<p>Pastrnak, the game's hero, also stood out with 10 shots on goal and served as the assist for Geekie's goal.</p>
<h2>What's Next for Bruins and Blues?</h2>
<p>The Bruins will face off against Dallas on Thursday night, while the Blues start a three-game road series at Buffalo.</p>

Despite these achievements and Binnington’s 27 saves, the Blues couldn’t stave off the Bruins’ late surge and suffered their third consecutive loss. The game’s momentum shifted when Nathan Walker’s shot for the Blues hit the left post early in the third period. Had the shot gone in, the Blues would have taken a commanding 3-0 lead. Instead, less than two minutes later, Geekie scored for the Bruins, starting their comeback. Pastrnak, the game’s hero, also stood out with 10 shots on goal and served as the assist for Geekie’s goal. The Bruins will face off against Dallas on Thursday night, while the Blues start a three-game road series at Buffalo.

<h1>Ottawa Senators Triumph Over Toronto Maple Leafs in Impressive Shutout</h1>
<p>In an energizing display of teamwork and skill, goaltender Linus Ullmark of the <a href=""https://21sports.com/tkachuks-overtime-magic-propels-senators-to-victory-over-bruins/"">Ottawa Senators</a> secured his inaugural shutout of the season, leading his team to a commanding 3-0 victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/maple-leafs-blank-bruins-4-0-stolarz-shines-with-first-season-shutout/"">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> on Tuesday night. Ullmark stopped a remarkable 27 shots in this pivotal match.</p>
<h2>Sens' Offensive Force: Norris, Stutzle, and Amadio Deliver</h2>
<p>Josh Norris, Tim Stutzle, and Michael Amadio emerged as the offensive heroes for Ottawa, each contributing a goal. Artem Zub also played a key role, supplying the team with two assists. Toronto's goaltender Anthony Stolarz put up a valiant fight, deflecting 38 shots, but it was not enough to halt Ottawa's relentless attack.</p>
<h2>Leafs' Unfortunate Downfall</h2>
<p>The Maple Leafs' impressive three-game winning streak came to a halt with this loss. This was the first time the teams faced each other since the controversial incident involving Leafs defenseman Morgan Rielly cross-checking Senators forward Ridly Greig in a game on February 10. The incident, which occurred after Greig's empty-net slapshot in a 5-3 Ottawa victory, resulted in a five-game suspension for Rielly.</p>
<h3>Injury Update</h3>
<p>Maple Leafs' captain Auston Matthews was absent for the fourth consecutive game due to an upper-body injury. Additionally, veteran winger Max Pacioretty is projected to be out on a week-to-week basis after a lower-body injury sustained during Saturday’s 4-1 win against the Montreal Canadiens. On a positive note for the Senators, center Shane Pinto made his return to the ice following an eight-game absence.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways from the Game</h2>
<p>Ullmark enjoyed his first shutout in a Senators jersey since his off-season trade from the Boston Bruins. The goaltender recently secured a four-year, $33-million contract extension. The Leafs, on the other hand, had their defense breached on 34 occasions in three separate games during the 2024-25 season before Tuesday's match. Ottawa managed to direct 35 shots on target in the first two periods of their encounter with Toronto.</p>
<h3>Game-Changing Moment</h3>
<p>In a crucial turn of events, Stutzle extended Ottawa's lead to 2-0 early in the second period. Amadio followed with a swift goal, widening the gap to 3-0 in favor of the visitors in less than a minute.</p>
<h3>Significant Statistic</h3>
<p>Despite not making the playoffs since their 2017 Eastern Conference final appearance, Ottawa has shown resilience and determination, winning three out of four meetings against their Atlantic Division rivals last season.</p>
<h2>What's Next for the Teams?</h2>
<p>The Senators will host the Flyers on Thursday, while the Maple Leafs will face the Capitals on Wednesday in their next match.</p>

<h2>Postgame Insights and Key Statistics</h2>
<p>The Jets' road game record remains untarnished, with seven consecutive wins to their credit.

Kurtis Rourke is not just a name; he is now an emotion for Indiana Hoosiers fans who have been patiently waiting all these years for their moment to shine. Entering the 12th week of the college football season, the Hoosiers are one of those few teams undefeated. However, it wouldn’t have been possible without their starting quarterback. Rourke is the guy who is making waves both on and off the field. It’s evident by looking at the current hike in his NIL valuation. The 6-foot-4 and 200-pounder’s total NIL valuation went up by 14%, currently standing at $1.3 million. With that, he’s now a 19th-ranked college football quarterback and stands at no. 42 on the NIL 100. Look at his NIL chart; he was steady at $1 million, but recently, after week 11, his valuation went up from $1 million to $1.3 million. All thanks to his performance in the past few games. So far this season, the QB has completed 71.8 per cent of his passes for 2410 yards, along with throwing 21 touchdowns with just four interceptions. Currently, the Hoosiers are on their bye week before they go on their final adventure against Ohio State next week. But the Heisman is not the only race Kurtis Rourke might win; there are other prestigious awards as well, waiting for Curt Cignetti’s QB’s next move. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad One such award is the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award, which is given to the NCAA’s top senior quarterback who will be graduating their class. And our boy has just been listed among the top five finalists who’re running in the race. He’s standing among college football’s top quarterbacks, such as Colorado’s Shedeur Sanders, The Hurricanes’ Cam Ward, Jaxson Dart of Ole Miss, and Oregon’s Dillon Gabriel, to win the title. Besides that, let’s learn which other awards Kurtis Rourke is likely to win after they finish this season. Kurtis is having a monster season, and the Maxwell football club is laying an eye on it. Now, the Hoosiers quarterback has been named a semifinalist for both the Maxwell and Davey O’Brien awards, making him one of the top 16 players in the nation right now. On top of that, his 21-touchdown record is the second most scored in the Big Ten and top-12 in the nation. Apart from that, if you need more proof of his dominance, the QB’s single-season numbers are already reaching IU’s all-time charts. His four-interception ratio is the fewest among the top five quarterbacks right now. In addition to that, Rourke also sets records left and right. He is the first Big Ten quarterback since 2000 to throw for 250+ yards along with three touchdowns during his first three conference games! Not only that, Kurtis Rourke was named Big Ten Player of the Week twice and he has won the Manning Award for quarterback of the week after an over-the-top performance against UCLA.

Georgia. (Photo by Todd Kirkland/Getty Images) Debate Can Josh Heupel outsmart Kirby Smart, or will Georgia steal Tennessee's top recruits this season? Since Josh Heupel joined Tennessee, he has made lots of positive changes to the team. This season, he has led them to an 8-1 record, and they are also among the serious contenders for the college football playoffs. At the same time, the Volunteers have made significant strides in recruiting over the years. Heupel and the staff rarely experience decommitments or flips. After losing to Arkansas, they made sure to bounce back, and now they have won four straight games after a challenging week. This week, Tennessee is all set to play against Georgia Bulldogs. Winning is the only option to solidify the place in the playoffs. However, with the national championship, the signing days are also around the corner, and it looks like the Bulldogs are trying to flip three 4-star commits this week. On November 15, Steve Wiltfong, On3 Vice President, National College Football Recruiting and Transfer Portal, appeared on On3’s YouTube channel and discussed Georgia’s brilliant move to flip Tennessee’s top recruits. Yes! You heard it right. Kirby Smart is focusing on two things at a time. “Austin Price, our Tennessee insider, is already reporting that Shaedy Hayward will not be at Georgia this weekend,” Although Lagonza Hayward himself announced that he is not flipping his decision; the rumors are not ending. Even Steve made it clear, “He’s probably the hardest one, the flip of the three; in my opinion, Georgia tried to get him to the game against Florida as well. Now Florida is trying to battle for Shaedy Hayward here late in the process as well, but Tennessee certainly has the clamps on that one.” Shaedy is an impressive safety. He had a great year at Toombs High School, and he also ranks 4th among athletes in his position and 76th overall for the 2025 class. Now we know why everybody is running behind him.

Mandatory Credit: Brett Davis-USA TODAY Sports Moving forward, Steve mentioned 4-star wide receiver Travis Smith Jr. “As I talk to you guys this morning, talking to our colleague, Chad Simmons, a little bit about Travis Smith Jr. this week, Travis confirmed that he will be in Georgia this weekend. That things are picking up with the Bulldogs here; they already landed. CJ Wiley from in-state recently and are battling Travis Smith.”  Travis Smith Jr. has been committed to Tennessee since mid-July, but he is going to visit the Georgia Bulldogs this weekend. Does that mean he will ditch Heupel? He chose Tennessee over big programs like Alabama, Auburn and the Bulldogs. Although he made his decision to join Tennesee Bulldogs, they did not stop approaching him. The third player Steve mentioned is Christian Gass. Georgia has been running behind Gass for a long time. Smart also attended his game against the Cedar Shoals, showing his interest in him. But Gass has been committed to Tennessee since 20th July. Talking about him, Steve said, “Tennessee did a great job of getting him in the fold, but he has continued to keep Georgia warm.” He further mentioned, “I would say Georgia would have the best chance of flipping Gass.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Heupel, are you listening to this? However, we cannot ignore that Gass has a great relationship with the Vols coaching staff. We are sure the faceoff between Tennessee and the Bulldogs is going to be crazy, but let’s see if Kirby Smart and his team successfully flip their commits. Till then, let’s see if Tennesse has any new strategy for Smart’s squad. Can Josh Heupel outsmart Kirby Smart, or will Georgia steal Tennessee's top recruits this season? Debate The Georgia Bulldogs are struggling badly on the offensive line. Quarterback Carson Beck has disappointed his fans a lot with his back-to-back poor performances. At the same time, the Vols QB is injured. Nico had to leave the field last week, and as of now, he is in concussion protocol. But both teams have very powerful defenses. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Last week, the Vols proved it once again by stopping Mississippi State under 20 points. But Heupel very well knows that he can’t be overconfident and take the Bulldogs lightly. Rodney Garner, Vols’ defensive line coach, had a conversation with ESPN where he mentioned the change they had made to Vol’s defense, as when the HC and Garner joined the team, they saw them struggling badly at defence.  “We wanted to change the culture from the very essence of it.” He further commented on Bulldogs game plays and mentioned, “They play a lot of players, which allows them to play really hard and really physically.” He did not reveal much strategy. It will be interesting to see which defense will overpower. Tennessee or Bulldogs? Let the world know your perspective.

Julian Lewis is setting the bar high. The five-star USC QB commit has already been a talking point in the College football recruitment. Schools seem to play their best shot to leave a lasting impression before the final signing day approaches. The kid stands out among the prized high school athletes for his incredible athletic prowess and the huge social media presence that put him only second to Bryce Underwood in the NIL valuation figures. But in case you still wonder what the root of such hype is? Lewis has an answer for you. The 17-year-old has been on a real tear in his last senior season at Carrollton High School in Georgia. With every play, he is making sure that he is beating his last stats and touching a new height. All those 646 of 943 passes for 9761 yards, 132 touchdowns, and 18 receptions sound massive, and it is massive. Jacksonville Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence and Cleveland Browns QB Deshaun Watson were left behind as the new sensation in the football world violated their record TD numbers. Lewis also threw fewer interceptions as compared to Lawrence and Watson in their first three seasons. But all of these feats came down to his latest one. Lewis has been named the region player of the year. I mean, just check out his latest IG story!

The spotlight never seems faint. He was crowned MaxPreps National Freshman of the Year in 2023. As the season is on, the sky can only be the limit of the unfathomable superstar. Moving ahead to his recruitment scenes, the picture is quite messy, and why wouldn’t it be? After all, who would want to miss out on a one-of-a-kind talent like him? However, the USC Trojans have been facing some severe competition to keep him locked. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad There has been a lot of information and intel swirling over ‘JuJu’ Lewis’s choice of schools. But among a slew of suitors, Lewis showed interest in what Colorado Buff has in store for him. From liking their game-winning post on X to making a deep bond with Shedeur Sanders, Lewis passively gave an unofficial nod to Deion Sanders’appeal. After the October 26the visit, it becomes even more of a feasibility for Lewis to end up with the Buffs. But wait, here comes the plot twist. Can USC Trojans hold onto Julian Lewis, or will Georgia Bulldogs steal the show? Debate USC Trojans are running on the sideline as their prized catch keeps on exploring his options. But coming to Colorado, they also might not be the answer to Lewis’ demand. Welcome to Kirby Smart’s strategic world.

20240914_tbs_usa_546 Debate Can Billy Napier's strategic NIL investments turn the Gators' season around and secure top recruits? “Talent acquisition business” is what head coach Billy Napier said when he joined the Gators. And it is true that teams with top athletes fight for the national championship at the end. How has it worked out for Napier? Well, considering he was about to be fired earlier this season, not well! The program had to put out a statement backing their head coach, and many thought that was because of the heavy $27 million buyout they had to pay the head coach if they fired him. That decision has the potential to impact Gators’ future, but the impact may extend beyond that. We hear even Texas Longhorns’ head coach Steve Sarkisian and his recruitment could also be in trouble. Justin Wells, a senior recruiting analyst, appeared on the On3 YouTube channel on November 15th and discussed some Longhorns’ recruiting news doing the rounds. In particular, they focused on five-star wide receiver Jamie Ffrench, who committed to Steve Sarkisian’s 2025 class in August 2024. The No. 17 player in the 2025 ESPN 300 (second-ranked WR), the Florida native was considered a huge steal for Texas. However, Ffrench is scheduled to take an official visit with the Gators this week. That part is still okay, and Texas would not have had to defend their commitment had another key player not been a part of the Ffrench discussion. Jamie’s Mandarin High School teammate Tramell Jones Jr has decommitted from Florida State University. His most likely destination? The Gators. As per Wells, “We reported yesterday that Tramell Jones was going to be joining him on campus. We actually predicted that he was going to decommit from Florida State. So that came to fruition this morning. That’s a good way to get their attention. You know, if you want Jamie Ffrench, why don’t you? He’s really close to his quarterback, his teammate. They don’t get much closer.”  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad via Imago Syndication: Ocala StarBanner Florida Gators head coach Billy Napier walks during the first half at the Orange and Blue spring football game at Steve Spurrier Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium in Gainesville, FL on Saturday, April 13, 2024.

Per Wells, “Here’s the big deal. I think this is all stemming from Florida coming out and giving a vote of confidence for Billy Napier. And instead of having to come up and scrape together all the buyout money they would need if they were just to dismiss him, they’re getting set on NIL, which I actually think is pretty smart.”  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad So, all that money they saved by not firing Napiers, they’re looking to invest in NIL? That’s pretty smart, and it has the potential for Sarkisian to lose his 5-star wide receiver. While the team hasn’t played that well this season, Billy Napiers must have his house in order if he wants to impress these potential commits. On Wednesday, Napier discussed several important topics they are working on ahead of their week 12 matchup against LSU, one of the strongest teams this season. He highlighted that “talent alone isn’t enough” to win games and mentioned the importance of consistency, discipline, and commitment. Will they play better than their last game? Napier mentioned that what happened last weekend is not acceptable and said, “So we didn’t do much well at all on Saturday. We got to do a lot better this weekend.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Can Billy Napier's strategic NIL investments turn the Gators' season around and secure top recruits? Debate When questioned about the impact of becoming bowl eligible, he stated, “Well, I think you’re always thinking big picture, but it’s important, like it’s a big picture, but it’s a little process, right? So one of the terms I’ve been using all week from the very beginning of the week is work as if you’re on a one-day contract, and maybe you get to call the night to come back. Maybe you don’t, you know.” He also emphasized that if they prepare, train, practice and do their job on a high level, they never know they can make a comeback. Can they? Do they still have chances for the playoffs? However, Napier is not giving up, but as he said, a one-day contract. Lets see if they can defeat LSU tomorrow. Let the world know your perspective.

Dinovo-USA TODAY Sports It is hard to quantify if Kyle Larson’s 2024 NASCAR season was a success or not. While he was the driver with the highest number of wins (6), the Round of 8 and the playoffs proved to be a tough nut for him to crack. Larson wasn’t able to convert the race in the playoffs like he did in the regular season, which eventually saw him miss out on making the championship 4. Although the NASCAR season has drawn its curtain, Larson is one of the few racers who doesn’t really enjoy the off-season. Rather, he is out on the road racing on the dirt or the Late Models. However, going by his schedule for the next few months, it seems like his participation at the historic midget race Chili Bowl is still uncertain. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Larson is one of the few talented NASCAR drivers who can race in almost anything that runs on four wheels and an engine. He might be a championship-caliber driver on the asphalt, but the same can be said for the dirt tracks. Yung Money honed his race craft competing at USAC, World of Outlaws. His love for sprint car racing even saw him launch his own racing series, High Limit Racing, which is now going international. The HMS star will be joining Jason Pryde Motorsport for the three-day event at Perth Motorplex on December 28-30. Although Larson has raced in Australia and New Zealand this visit to Perth will be his first. It was his brother-in-law and co-owner of High Limit Racing, Brad Sweet, who managed to set up this feature for him. “I was really reliant on Brad Sweet; he had spent a few weeks down there this past season racing in Perth. So I relied on him to find who would be the best available car owner for me to get lined up with. I’m really excited to see that side of Australia; I’ve never been to that side of the country. It will be a good time.” Kyle Larson said this is in a press release, as quoted by Flo Racing. So the month of December is indeed going to be busy for him. But that’s not the only racing event Larson has scheduled for the end of 2024. He has confirmed that he will be competing in three USAC National Midget races, teaming up with Silva Motorsports. The three events are spread across Merced Speedway, Bakersfield, and the Ventura Raceway from November 26-30, 2024. However, he has yet to confirm his participation in the 39th running of the Chili Bowl Nationals, which is scheduled from 13-18 January 2025.

Mandatory Credit: Jim Dedmon-USA TODAY Sports While there is still uncertainty about Kyle Larson’s Chili Bowl appearance, the other Kyle—Kyle Busch took the racing community by surprise by announcing his participation in the historic event. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Tony Stewart, Christopher Bell, and Kyle Larson are the select few NASCAR drivers who have competed at the iconic midget racing event. However, Kyle Busch, who has been invested and focused on his son’s dirt and kart racing for the past few years, seems to have finally found the motivation to have a go at the Chili Bowl Nationals. “The Cup season may be over, but the racing season is still in full swing, with the biggest events on dirt taking place over the next couple of months. The Chili Bowl is a legendary event and has always been on my wish list. To be able to compete there, and then alongside my son Brexton at the Tulsa Shootout, is making this year one to remember,” Busch said to Flo Racing. However, he isn’t too optimistic about his chances to follow in the footsteps of Larson in winning the event and has set realistic expectations. “I would say you would have to go in with open expectations. I mean, there’s no way you’re gonna say I’m gonna make the A-main and win the A-main. The competition level and all of that is just so high. I’d say you go with an open mind and shoot for a C-main or B-main and maybe get yourself to A-main,” he added further.

With his long limbs, slender frame, and painfully sharp knees and elbows, the UFC heavyweight champion is a nightmare to deal with. These physical gifts, combined with his freakishly high fight IQ, and unprecedented creativity in the octagon have made him nigh unbeatable and put him on the Mt. Rushmore of MMA. These gifts also tend to make many fans curious about his ancestry and ethnicity. After all, it does seem Jones is genetically gifted since both of his siblings played in the NFL. In this article, we take a look at where those special genes come from, as well as taking a look at Jon Jones’ early life. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad It hardly needs to be said that Jon Jones is African-American by ethnicity. Since he was born in the United States, Jones is an American citizen and a pretty proud one at that. In addition, we know that Jones traces his ancestry back to western and southern parts of Africa. The consensus MMA GOAT had an official ancestry test done, which revealed that 42% of his genetic background was from Nigeria, with 24% coming from Cameroon, Congo, and the Bantu people. Of course, Nigeria itself has various ethnic groups such as the Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, etc. Israel Adesanya, of course, is also from Nigeria (he is a Yoruba), and has a similar tall, thin, and long-limbed body structure as Jones. But we do not know which group within Nigeria Jones’ DNA has a preponderance of. However, chances are ‘Bones’ does know this since he took great pride in his ancestry, announcing it on an Instagram post, and promising to look further into it.     A post shared by Bony (@jonnybones)  Is Jon Jones' dominance in MMA a result of his genes, or his relentless work ethic? Debate “After months of waiting, I finally got back my ancestry.com results! Come to find out I am 42% #Nigerian! Can’t wait to learn about my culture, and to research stories about all the great warriors and history. It feels amazing to finally know where all this awesomeness originates,” Jones wrote. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Jon Jones’ father, surprisingly, was a man of cloth. Born and raised in Rochester New York, Jon was one of four kids born to Arthur Jones, and his wife Camille. His father, of course, is a pastor at a church in Binghamton, which was not too far from their home in Rochester. Jones was the second youngest of the siblings, with his brother, Arthur being the oldest. He has a younger brother named Chandler and an older sister named Carmen, who unfortunately passed away due to a brain tumor before she turned eighteen. As we have mentioned, all three brothers are (or were) professional athletes. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Chandler was a linebacker for the Las Vegas Raiders, while Arthur was a defensive lineman for various NFL teams, including the Baltimore Ravens with whom he won a Super Bowl back in 2013. In fact, even Jon was a football player back in High School just like his brothers, but became more interested in wrestling and even won an NJCAA championship at the Iowa Central Community College. It is his love for wrestling that would eventually lead him to MMA. And the rest, as they say, is history. What do you think about Jones’ heritage and ancestry? Let the world know your perspective.

Amidst Colorado Buff’s huge playoff hope, Travis Hunter keeps adding stacks to his individual dream. The once-in-a-million two-way star of the Buffs had a tumultuous season so far. Sure, he’s great but had to endure a tough time to earn his stripes. Hunter, 21, has always been the frontrunner of the Heisman conversation unless he hit a low after getting injured during the game against Kansas State. One week off for healing plus one bye week and book! The Heisman stocks suddenly went down for the kid. The changed landscape saw Boise State’s Ashton Jeanty take the lead. But wait, Hunter left his spot only for a while. He suited up in a blockbuster game against Cincinnati and never looked back. The Heisman hope is back. But is he really locked in for the trophy? Let’s hear the Barstool sports’ Dan Katz. Colorado is having a breakout session. Coach Sanders’ has wiped out the humiliating 4-8 season memory with his improved stewardship. On top of that, they are looking to bring the Heisman glory home after 30 years of drought. Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter are shouldering the expectation. While Shedeur might not be in the thick of it, Travis’s 850 receiving yards and nine touchdowns in the last nine games speak volumes. Guess what? He was even better as a cornerback. If two stormy interceptions and one forced fumble couldn’t convince you about his Heisman candidacy, your football intellect needs a shake-up. But then, the road is still narrow for the prodigy. As Dan Katz noted, ”he will be f___ed if the championship Sunday comes and Dillon Gabriel is playing, Cam Ward is playing, Ashton Jeanty is playing, and Travis Hunter is not playing. That’s the death.” Should Travis Hunter win the Heisman this year? @BarstoolBigCat thinks so – Travis Hunter +110

The hype around Hunter gets unreal, with fans literally saying things like just give him the award. There has never been a Travis Hunter’ belief added fuel to it. But if you put it against competitors like Cam Ward and Dillon Gabriel, they need to stumble in order to make things happen for Hunter. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad If Miami or Oregon let one or two games slip or the concerned players produce more bumbling plays, Hunter will have a leg up. Meanwhile, Ashton Jeanty reignites his previous heat with Travis Hunter. Hunter, out of frustration, had some coc-y comparisons between himself and Jeanty when he was benched with injury. But addressing that in another sit-down interview, Jeanty gave a classy response, saying the Colorado Buffs star is truly phenomenal. What he’s doing is unreal. He is the best player in the college football. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Is Travis Hunter truly the best, or does Ashton Jeanty have the edge in the Heisman race? Debate However, Jeanty didn’t hesitate to keep him above in the race. When asked about who will win the trophy, his confidence spoke, ”Me for sure.” It was not at all a hollow claim. The young RB keeps on stunning fans with his top-tier playmaking qualities. The Broncos sensation racked up 1,734 yards on 224 carries in the last nine games. If his team continues to run the table, a Heisman trophy for Jeanty wouldn’t be far-fetched.

csmphotothree293106 Debate Is Travis Hunter the next Heisman winner, or is he just another overrated college star? Amid all the success that the Buffs have had this season, Travis Hunter has also been a remarkable story. A genuine two-way star who features on every snap in the game. Does he not get tired? Many have wondered about this and continue to be amazed by Prime Time’s lethal weapon. That story in college football could finish with Hunter being the Heisman winner. Following that, we are sure to have a start to another glorious story. Travis Hunter as an NFL player. While NFL Draft experts are predicting a top-10 pick for Travis, one analyst has weighed in with a contrarian view. On The November 15 episode of 1010 XL/92.5 FM, analyst Chad Forbes poured water on Hunter’s NFL hopes. At the very start of his comments, he deemed the Buffs star ‘overrated’. That’s not all. Forber further said, “I think that he’s [Travis] regressed. He’s not the wide receiver that everyone’s made him out to be. This isn’t like AJ Green and Julio Jones coming into the NFL where it was like, you look at him and say, Okay, I can see that guy being a bona fide number one wide receiver I look at Travis Hunter and I think, you might have to play him a lot in the slot, right? And I don’t love slot-only wide receivers. That’s why I was a big believer in Brian Thomas Jr, the wide receiver from Arizona. I think it’s really close between him and Travis Hunter at this point.” “(Travis Hunter) is not the WR everyone is making him out to be.” 😳 NFL Draft expert @NFLDraftBites joined @RyanGreen1010XL and poured cold water on the #Jaguars potential first round pick.#Jaguars | #DUUUVAL pic.twitter.com/DYrAXBD73F — 1010 XL / 92.5 FM (@1010XL) November 14, 2024 Expand Tweet ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad  Forbes talked about the Arizona receiver Tetairoa McMillan, who comes second in almost all the rankings for the WR position behind Hunter. So far this season, Travis Hunter has hauled in 69 receptions for 856 yards and nine touchdowns. While there is still some time before the season ends, Hunter has already crossed his records from last year. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad But being that top pick isn’t just down to Hunter being good. It’s all that the team with the top pick in the Draft needs next season. Some might just go with D-line or edge options. This discussion leaves a bitter taste for Deion Sanders’ player, who, a few years ago, had revealed his wish to play for the Denver Broncos. At 5-5 this season, the Broncos are currently primed to have a first-round pick between No. 11-20. Even if we consider Forbes’ comments, it’s highly unlikely that Travis would stay undrafted till that time. Travis Hunter’s Heisman odds almost skyrocketed after his nine catches and 99 yards, along with scoring a touchdown in the Week 11 game against Texas Tech. Another reason for Hunter to go up was because of Cam Ward’s okayish performance in the Hurricanes’ loss to Georgia Tech. Ward, who was running ahead of Hunter throughout these weeks, was the favorite before week 11. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Is Travis Hunter the next Heisman winner, or is he just another overrated college star? Debate Finally, after a successful season and putting in so much effort, Travis Hunter holds -115 odds to win the Heisman title, as per FanDuel. Followed by Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel at +360 and Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty at +360. No wonder Hunter is the nation’s best dual-threat player right now. With his 69 receptions, Hunter is currently ranked 7th, and with 856 yards, he’s sitting at 12th rank. Added to that, with 9 touchdowns, he’s in 6th position; his PFF rating is 84.7, and he comes in eighth among other qualified receivers in the nation. Hunter has proven his defensive skills as well by holding an 86.6 PFF rating and coming in fifth among defensive backs. Some CFB experts have even started believing that Hunter has no other competition in winning the Heisman this year! Let’s see how that pans out. Let the world know your perspective.

However, despite the dominant stat line, Mulkey used the post-game press conference to point out a critical moment that stood out in the one-sided game. The culprit: a former five-star recruit who had picked up a foul at a crucial moment during the game. “I honestly would never do that in a tight game. I would never let them pick up, you know, their third in the first half like I did,” Mulkey remarked in a post-game presser where the LSU Tigers beat the Charleston Southern 117-44. While Aalyah Del Rosario did score 9 points in her 13 minutes on the court, she also ended up getting 4 personal fouls in the game. This, for Head Coach Mulkey, became an opportunity to reinforce the importance of staying smart on the floor. Mulkey, who was experimenting with a bigger lineup, had seen Rosario pick up her third foul in the first half, a mistake that could have been costly in a close game. “What happened, I went big, and I wanted to look at jersey on the perimeter, and she went to a one-three-one zone. Well, that freaked them out, you know,” Mulkey explained. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “Then they came down, and before I could get a sub in for the big, get the big lineup off the floor, Aalyah fouled and came down right there in front of our bench.” The head coach went on to offer advice to Del Rosario right then and there while stating in the press conference “I told her, I said, just stand straight up. Just stand straight up. Don’t do that in that situation. But I would never do that in a tight game.” In the lopsided matchup, Del Rosario made 9 points on 4-5 shooting from the field and collected 6 rebounds all in 12 minutes of floor time. Still, her quick foul calls became the concern for the Hall of Famer head coach. However, exciting times are in for the 2023 NCAA champions with Rosario protecting their paint. Del Rosario, who is a sophomore this year, was widely regarded as one of the top post prospects in the country when she joined LSU last year. Standing at 6-foot-5, her skillset and her ability to control the paint, coupled with her ability to stretch the floor and play outside the key, was what made her one of the top recruits to sign last year. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad As a freshman, the No. 23 averaged 4.7 points on 54% shooting from the field, 3.5 rebounds, and 0.8 blocks per game. She was also only playing 11.2 minutes per game in her first year with the Lady Tigers. However, with a dominating post presence such as Angel Reese, her lesser floor time is understandable. via Imago Nov 8, 2024; Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA; LSU Lady Tigers center Aalyah Del Rosario (23) during the second half against the Northwestern State Lady Demons at Pete Maravich Assembly Center. Mandatory Credit: Stephen Lew-Imagn Images Her resume before stepping onto LSU’s campus is impressive. Del Rosario helped Team USA win a Gold Medal at the FIBA U18 World Cup in Argentina and was a finalist for the 2022 TSSAA Division II-A Miss Basketball Award. During her junior year at The Webb School, she averaged a double-double with 13.0 points, 11.0 rebounds, and 4.0 assists per game, cementing her status as one of the nation’s top high school players. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “Aalyah brings a dominant inside presence to our front court,” Coach Mulkey mentioned for the star player. “She has closely followed post players that I have coached in the past and has the capability to be the next great post player at LSU.” Mulkey’s expectations are high, and Del Rosario’s raw talent makes her an essential piece for LSU’s future. The 73-point blowout may have been a victory for LSU, but Mulkey’s callout to Del Rosario serves as a reminder that no win is perfect without self-reflection. For Del Rosario, it’s just one of many lessons she will take with her on the road to becoming the next great post player at LSU.

Unger/Zuffa LLC) To most people today, tattoos are a fashion statement. But, there are a lot of others who have deep secrets hidden inside the ink on their bodies. UFC fighters don’t lag behind in this regard too. The life of a fighter is full of uncertainty. A healthy chunk of fans might agree that it takes something extraordinary to create a fighter out of a person. While taking that journey, fighters are required to go through a lot of hardships and untoward experiences. Hence, fighters often tend to get tattoos to commemorate those experiences. UFC fighters have also showcased some gaze-attracting tattoos over time. Starting from Conor McGregor’s commemoration of the combat legend, Bruce Lee, with his chest tattoo to Brock Lesnar, representing his unruly times with the sword tattoo running through the middle of his torso. UFC fighters have used tattoos for both fashion and symbolic purposes. The former UFC Lightweight kingpin, Charles Oliveira, isn’t an exception to this. ‘The Brazilian’ has a number of attractive tattoos on his body. But, apart from fashion, his tattoos also stand as a commemoration of a number of things related to him. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Almost all of ‘Do Bronx’s’ fans are aware of his love for horses. Oliveira has also publically accepted his attraction toward horses. One he had also revealed, “Harness racing is a real passion for me. When you ride a horse, when you brush them, give them a bath, it makes me feel peaceful”. Along with horses, Oliveira is also hugely interested in the less-known sport of harness racing. Reportedly, he has also spent some exorbitant amounts on it. Looking at all of these factors, it’s quite understandable why the former UFC lightweight chose to get multiple horse tattoos. Oliviera’s left shoulder, arm, and biceps all carry beautiful images of horses inked on them. Truly, ‘Do Bronx’s’ love for horses knows no bounds. Oliveira’s left wrist contains a rather petite tattoo. A lot would agree that among all the large inks on ‘The Brazilian’s’ body, the tattoo on his left wrist becomes hardly noticeable. READ MORE – Who Is Talita Roberta Pereira? Everything You Need to Know About Former Lightweight Champ Charles Oliveira’s Wife The ones taking a closer look at the pattern will find that it actually is a knot tied between two threads. Over the knot, a lettering of the alphabets ‘T’ and ‘C’ can also be seen. This ink is often considered a symbol of his love for his wife, Talita Roberta Pereira. The ‘T’ stands for the intial of Oliverira’s wife while the ‘C’ signifies the initials of his own name. Further, the tied knot inked below the letters implies the strong bond between the two. Charles Oliveira is one of the most responsible UFC athletes when things come to his family. Apart from maintaining a loving relationship with his wife, the 33-year-old is also a responsible father. Oliveira has also put out a testimony of his love for his daughter with a portrait tattoo of her on the left side of his chest. via Getty HOUSTON, TEXAS – MAY 15: Charles Oliveira of Brazil looks on during his Championship Lightweight Bout against Michael Chandler at the UFC 262 event at Toyota Center on May 15, 2021 in Houston, Texas. (Photo by Carmen Mandato/Getty Images) Apart from the face of Oliveira’s beloved daughter, the tattoo also has a lettering of her name just below it. The letters spell ‘Tayla’. Oliveira is a proud Brazilian and also takes pride in his ancestry. The Brazilian has got Portuguese roots and represents his family with pride as well. The huge lettering of his surname ‘Oliveira’ inked on his back serves as a symbol of his pride towards his ancestry. Some fans might also take this one as ‘The Brazilian’s’ jersey name. Most fans are aware of the association of jerseys with various sports. They often serve as an identifier for an individual athlete as well as a team. Watch this Story – Charles Oliveira, Brock Lesnar, and more- Best Come Backs In UFC History But, since MMA and other combat sports don’t have the provision of using jerseys, Oliveira might have thought of turning his back into a permanent jersey serving his identification and pride. One thing that most UFC fans would agree upon is that Charles Oliveira is an ardent family man in his outside UFC life. Apart from being responsible toward his wife and daughter, ‘The Brazilian’ is also a loving son to his parents. A number of Oliveira’s fans might have noticed that previously he only had his daughter’s portrait inked on the left side of his chest. But currently, his chest is all covered up with tattoos. Oliveira got the portrait of his father, Ozana Oliveira, and mother, Francisco Antonio da Silva just beside the portrait of his daughter’s face.     A post shared by Charles Oliveira (@charlesdobronxs)  He has always stated that he fights for his family. Hence, his thought about getting the faces of his father and mother is quite understandable. A lot of UFC fans might even judge Oliveira’s tattoos to be the best among all UFC athletes.

   The Kansas City Royals made their first postseason appearance in nine years after posting a regular season record of 86-76. After making the AL playoffs as a wild-card team, the Royals swept the series with the Baltimore Orioles. The Royals then fell to the eventual AL champion New York Yankees in the Division Series. After winning only 56 games in 2023, the Royals drastically improved, and star shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. played a large role in that. One MLB analyst and former World Series champion recently named Witt Jr. as the best player in baseball. “I don’t know if he has a ceiling, he’s the best all-around player in our game,” Ron Darling said, via MLB Network. What is Bobby Witt Jr.'s ceiling? ""I don't know if he has a ceiling… he's the best all-around player in our game."" – Ron Darling@Royals | @officialBBWAA pic.twitter.com/1JerhFh5Rd — MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) November 15, 2024  Witt debuted with the Royals in 2022 and has improved each season. This season, Witt played in 161 games and batted .332 with 211 hits, 32 home runs, 109 RBIs, 125 runs scored, 31 stolen bases and a .977 OPS. Darling points out that Witt improved his defensive game by a large amount, and that was proven by the 24-year-old receiving his first Gold Glove Award. Although Witt likely won’t win AL MVP over Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge, he had one of the best seasons by a shortstop in MLB history.

   The New York Yankees fell three wins short of winning the 28th World Series title in franchise history as they lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games. Now that the season is over, the Yankees have another battle ahead of them as star outfielder Juan Soto is a free agent. The Soto Sweepstakes have involved talk of many teams being interested, including the Yankees, New York Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Francisco Giants and Boston Red Sox. With no decision made as of yet, New York radio host Sal Licata revealed that he thinks Soto will stay in New York, but with the Mets and not the Yankees. “It feels like the seeds are starting to slowly be planted for Juan Soto to exit the New York Yankees,” Licata said, via WFAN Sports Radio. ""It feels like the seeds are starting to slowly be planted for Juan Soto to exit the New York Yankees"" Sal says he is becoming more convinced that Soto will choose the ""looser, more fun"" environment of the Mets:https://t.co/CpBd3aeD6w — WFAN Sports Radio (@WFAN660) November 15, 2024  Licata mentions that he believes Soto will choose the Mets because their environment is looser and more fun than the Yankees’. Playing for the Yankees definitely has its benefits as they have the most World Series titles in all of baseball, but it also comes with a large amount of pressure to win. Licata is leaning toward Soto signing with the Mets and joining an organization that just doesn’t have the same scrutiny as playing for the Yankees does. Signing Soto will require a huge amount of money, and Mets owner Steve Cohen should be able to write whatever check is necessary. It will be interesting to see if Licata’s gut feeling is right, or if a different dark horse team will come into play for Soto.",2024-11-15

   The New York Jets are entering a must-win game against the Indianapolis Colts in Week 11. However, they will be without All-Pro Tyron Smith because of a neck injury, meaning rookie Olu Fashanu will make his first NFL start at left tackle. Fashanu recently spoke about playing the prominent position at the NFL level. “I try not to make anything bigger than it actually is, but I’m not going to be ignorant. Obviously, that’s the position I played in college and high school, so it’s definitely nice to go out and get the start and be with all the guys,” Fashanu said, via Dennis Waszak Jr. of The Associated Press. #Jets' Olu Fashanu on starting at LT for Tyron Smith: ""I try to not make anything bigger than it actually is, but I'm not going to be ignorant. Obviously, that's the position I played in college & HS, so it's definitely nice to go out & get the start & be with all the guys."" — Dennis Waszak Jr. (@DWAZ73) November 15, 2024  Fashanu was the No. 11 overall pick in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft out of Penn State. The All-American was considered one of the best offensive linemen in the country and is now going to get another chance to prove the Jets were right to select him as highly as they did. Against a Colts defense that is ranked 29th in total defense, Fashanu will have a great opportunity to succeed in protecting quarterback Aaron Rodgers. The four-time NFL MVP has had to deal with a lot of pressure from opposing defenses this season as has taken too many hits. Fashanu, who has started at right tackle this season, needs to prove he is someone Rodgers can count on up front. A critical AFC game is the perfect opportunity for the 21-year-old lineman to prove exactly that to his 40-year-old quarterback.",2024-11-15

   The MLB season officially ended when the Los Angeles Dodgers won Game 5 of the 2024 World Series against the New York Yankees. With all of the attention now on the free agent class, it is also award season, when players are chosen to receive various honors including MVP, Rookie of the Year and the Cy Young Award. While most people will be interested in who wins the major awards, MLB Network analyst Alex Avila recently revealed his own “Good Guy Awards.” Avila chose Kyle Schwarber of the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League and Anthony Rizzo of the Yankees in the American League.

The Phillies DH is the founder of Schwarber’s Neighborhood Heroes, which benefits first responders and military personnel. The Yankees first baseman is the founder of the Anthony Rizzo Family Foundation, which assists pediatric patients and their families. Avila points out that both give a lot of money and time back to their communities and that they are deserving recipients of his Good Guy Awards. On the field, Schwarber had another great season for the Phillies, batting .248 with 38 home runs, 104 RBIs and an .851 OPS. Rizzo batted .228 with eight home runs, 35 RBIs and a .637 OPS.",2024-11-15

    The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Yankees in the World Series to end the 2024 MLB season. Now that the games have all been played, the attention has turned to the free agent class of this offseason. With plenty of talent available, Corbin Burnes stands out among the top starting pitchers. One MLB insider recently explained why Burnes is the top starter on the market. “Corbin Burnes’ cutter is truly a unicorn pitch,” Ryan Spilborghs said, via MLB Network Radio on SiriusXM. Why is Corbin Burnes the top starter on the market? The cutter.🔗 https://t.co/fGPbvbjGlC pic.twitter.com/F6xdYogjce — MLB Network Radio on SiriusXM (@MLBNetworkRadio) November 15, 2024  Burnes is coming off his first season with the Orioles after playing for the Milwaukee Brewers since entering the league in 2018. He had a solid year for Baltimore, starting 32 games and going 15-9 with a 2.92 ERA and 181 strikeouts in 194.1 innings. The Orioles added Burnes last offseason in an attempt to get past the first round of the playoffs after getting swept by the Texas Rangers in the 2023 ALDS. Even though Burnes was dominant in his first postseason start against the Kansas City Royals, the Orioles could not get the bats going and ended up losing 1-0 on the way to being swept again. Burnes pitched eight innings, allowing five hits and one run while walking one and striking out three. That performance showed other teams that Burnes has the stuff to be the ace of a pitching staff in the postseason. Now, taking his unicorn cutter into free agency, it is likely that many teams will be interested.",2024-11-15

   The Kansas City Chiefs made the move to sign kicker Spencer Shrader off the New York Jets practice squad in the wake of veteran Harrison Butker being placed on injured reserve after knee surgery. Chiefs head coach Andy Reid recently commented on the addition of Shrader heading into the Week 11 game against the Buffalo Bills. “We welcome this kid in and we’ll give him a shot,” Reid said, via Charles Goldman of A to Z Sports. #Chiefs HC Andy Reid on Spencer Shrader: ""We welcome this kid in and we'll give him a shot."" — Charles Goldman (@goldmctNFL) November 15, 2024  Shrader is replacing a multiple Super Bowl champion, an NFL scoring leader, and one of the most clutch kickers in the sport. It is a tough thing to replace a player of that caliber. After going undrafted out of Notre Dame, Shrader has spent time on three teams this season. He made two field goals with the Jets in Week 10 and three extra points with the Indianapolis Colts in Week 1. The 25-year-old could be with the Chiefs for at least four weeks with Butker healing from his surgery and having to miss four games while on IR. Luckily, the Chiefs are 9-0 and not in much trouble when it comes to their record, which is why they can afford to take a chance with an inexperienced kicker. The game against the Bills figures to be a close one where the winner could be whoever has the ball last. If that team is the Chiefs, their fate in Buffalo could be riding on the leg of Shrader.",2024-11-15

   The Baltimore Orioles made the playoffs for the second year in a row but had another disappointing showing come October. Over the past two seasons, the Orioles have lost all five of their playoff games as they have been swept in their first series in both years. The Orioles relied heavily on the long ball in 2024 as they hit the second most home runs in baseball with 235, trailing only the AL East rival New York Yankees at 237. With Camden Yards one of the more difficult places to hit a home run, the Orioles have announced they will be making some changes to the dimensions before the 2025 season, according to Jacob Calvin Meyer of The Baltimore Sun. “The Baltimore Orioles are moving their left-field wall in by 9 [feet] to 20 feet and are lowering it from 13 feet to 8 feet, the Orioles announce today, as Orioles hitters wildly celebrate the news,” Bob Nightengale of USA Today wrote on X. The Baltimore Orioles are moving their left-field wall in by 9 to 20 feet and are lowering it from 13 feet to 8 feet, the Orioles announce today, as Orioles hitters wildly celebrate the news https://t.co/SLbKcr76OO — Bob Nightengale (@BNightengale) November 15, 2024  Seeing as the Orioles relied primarily on the home run to score in 2024, the changes should be a reason to celebrate for their hitters, if not necessarily for their pitchers. The changes will likely benefit right-handed hitters due to them being made in left field, so it will be interesting to see if the Orioles go after some this offseason. Anthony Santander led the Orioles with 44 home runs in 2024, but he is a free agent and may not re-sign with the team. With plenty of talent in the free agent class, the Orioles should have other opportunities to sign some power hitters this offseason.",2024-11-15

   The Cincinnati Bengals are facing a crucial game on the road against the Los Angeles Chargers on “Sunday Night Football.” If the Bengals lose, they will fall to 4-7 and the playoffs will seem further out of reach. The good news is that they will have two significant players available for the Week 11 contest. “Trey Hendrickson officially listed as questionable but expected to play Sunday. Tee Higgins was limited all week but his status is not limited. Expected as a full-go,” Mike Petraglia of CLNS Media wrote on X.

Hill are questionable, with receiver Charlie Jones listed as out. The Bengals need all hands on deck if they want to defeat a good Chargers team, and having pass rusher Hendrickson and wide receiver Higgins available is a big boost. Both teams have plenty of firepower, which is why defense will be key. Having Hendrickson on the field is likely to pay dividends. The All-Pro has 11.0 sacks this season, the fourth time in the past five seasons he has had that many. While Hndrickson is one of the league’s best at generating pressure on the quarterback, getting Hill back in the interior could be great too. If they can play at their best, Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert could have a difficult day at the office.",2024-11-15

   The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Yankees to win their eighth World Series title in franchise history. After the Dodgers suffered injuries to multiple starting pitchers during the regular season, they needed someone to step up. Walker Buehler was that guy, as he appeared in two games during the World Series and did not allow a run while closing out the series out of the bullpen in Game 5. Now that the season is over, Buehler will test the free-agent waters, and he is already drawing some interest from at least one NL rival. “The [Atlanta] Braves are among the teams showing early interest in Walker Buehler, per Jon Morosi,” B/R Walk-Off wrote on X. The Braves are among the teams showing early interest in Walker Buehler, per @jonmorosi pic.twitter.com/vnLybnuLSG — B/R Walk-Off (@BRWalkoff) November 15, 2024  Buehler made his MLB debut with the Dodgers in 2017 and has played all seven seasons of his major league career with the organization. In 2024, Buehler started 16 games and was 1-6 with a 5.38 ERA and 64 strikeouts in 75.1 innings pitched. Buehler overcame that disappointing regular season by pitching six scoreless innings in the World Series, allowing just two hits and striking out seven, including Alex Verdugo for the final out of the season. The Braves also dealt with the injury bug in the 2024 season but were still able to make the playoffs. Buehler likely increased his stock with his postseason performance, and the Braves could use the 30-year-old starting pitcher. The Braves lost in the 2024 wild-card round but have made the playoffs each of the past seven seasons and won the World Series in 2021. It will be interesting to see if they are able to sign Buehler after his dominant performance in the World Series.",2024-11-15

While BBC retainers Mark Chapman, Gabby Logan, and Alex Scott are among the favourites to fill their boots, Cates placed third-top in the initial odds reported by Mail Sport.   Cates’ smooth presentation of Sky’s Premier League coverage and previous experience with the BBC stand her in good stead should she be tempted.  And The Times reports that Sky are preparing to fight hard to combat any advance by her would-be employers.       Sky Sports will reportedly fight hard to keep hold of Premier League presenter Kelly Cates      She is one of the favourites to succeed Gary Lineker as Match of the Day host next year ‘Kelly is just great to work with — the very opposite of a diva — and is so highly regarded,’ one insider, who has worked with Cates, told the outlet.  Cates has earned much praise for her anchoring of Sky’s Premier League output, particularly Super Sunday.  She regularly presents on BBC Radio 5 Live, used to host 606, and has her own podcast called Not Just Football with Hayley McQueen and Christine Lampard.  Speaking to The Independent this week, she said: ‘Do you know, and you never want to say this, but at the moment I’ve got a really lovely mix of everything. ‘I’ve got TV, live matches, radio, and when it gets towards the end of the season I do live Champions League games too.  ‘I could be at an Olympics or a World Cup during the summer so the balance of everything feels really nice. But I’m not tempting fate.’ Lineker, who took over presenting duties on the flagship BBC show from Des Lynam in 1999, is finally set to bring the curtain down after 26 years, paving the way for a brand new-host. The 63-year-old broadcaster is also set to leave the BBC entirely after the 2026 World Cup in America, Mexico, and Canada. Lineker is the BBC’s highest-paid presenter with a salary of around £1.35million but it’s understood executives want to move the show in a fresh direction. Your email address will not be published.

Juventus confirmed the termination of Paul Pogba, while Ruben Amorim has issued a new Joshua Zirkzee plan and Chelsea are planning on swapping Enzo Fernandez for Marc Casado. Below, FootballTransfers runs through the latest news updates. Tottenham Hotspur are exploring a move for Brighton & Hove Albion’s Tariq Lamptey, FootballTransfers has been told. Man Utd legend Ruud van Nistelrooy has said his goodbyes to the club after a brief but intense few months at Old Trafford. The Dutchman has also reportedly applied for the vacant job at Coventry City. Meanwhile, Ruben Amorim has conducted his first interview since replacing Erik ten Hag and he has issued a major statement to Red Devils fans. Amorim, on the other hand, has been told to axe several members of the club’s first-team squad by Nemanja Vidic. Furthermore, the new boss is reportedly planning on moving Marcus Rashford into a different position. In addition, Amorim is hoping to use Joshua Zirkzee as a makeweight in a deal for Viktor Gyokeres. However, Man Utd target Alphonso Davies has his heart set on a move to Real Madrid, as per reports in Spain. The Red Devils will also face severe competition in the race to sign Davies’ Bayern Munich team-mate Leroy Sane. Meanwhile, Roy Keane has told Alejandro Garnacho to “get a job somewhere else” after he refused to celebrate his goal against Leicester City last weekend.

The perfectly timed runs in to the box, the precision of the finish, the owl celebration after a precious winning goal. After the indifferent displays of Euro 2024, some wondered if the talisman of old would ever be back. They needn’t have worried; cometh the hour, cometh the man.   This was a night when Croatia clung to the ball as if it was made of velcro. Playing the entire second half with ten men after a contentious red card for Petar Sucic, the swagger and panache of the visitors continues to confound those who wonder how a nation of less than four million people can produce so many gifted footballers. Fat lot of good it did them in the end. With four minutes of normal time to play, a Scotland team second best for long spells finally exploited their numerical advantage. The pace and power of the electric Ben Doak ended with a driven cross being flapped towards the feet of the lurking McGinn by keeper Dominik Kotarski.      McGinn does trademark celebration after late winner against Croatia      Aston Villa star McGinn fires home in the 86th minute to secure 1-0 win for Scotland      The Croats can’t believe it as McGinn slams home what proved to be winning goal The outcome was a foregone conclusion. Careering off an outstretched defensive boot, the Aston Villa man’s strike nestled in the corner of the net for his 19th goal in Scotland colours. For the first time in 17 months, Scotland had won at Hampden. Thrashed 5-1 by Portugal, Poland now stand between Steve Clarke’s side and an unlikely Nations League salvage job. Win in Warsaw on Monday night and the Scots will secure a third place play-off and a chance to dodge relegation to League B. For long spells of this improbable win, it looked an unlikely scenario. After a first half when the home side rode their luck – and then some – salvation came from a second yellow card for Sucic in the final moments. Earning the first booking of the game for a foul on Andrew Robertson, a second for the Dinamo Zagreb playmaker incensed the visitors. His studs raking down the knee of John Souttar, it looked an open and shut case to some, a soft decision to others. Luka Modric losing his cool is the rarest sight in football and, after a half when they’d been given the runaround, Scotland took encouragement where they could find it. A one-man advantage offered their best, possibly only, hope of competing with a team who’d made them look second best. Kenny McLean had set the tone in the opening stages when he gave the ball straight to Andrej Kramaric in his own half, teeing up the first shot on goal for the visitors, if not the last. Billy Gilmour was robbed in midfield by a perfectly time tackle by Mateo Kovacic, Luka Susic doing Scotland a big favour by sidefooting a real chance high over the bar.      Croatia’s Petar Sucic is sent off for his challenge on John Souttar      Croatia skipper Luka Modric argues with the referee after Sucic’s dismissal When Kramaric forced Craig Gordon to scrape a low near post strike round the post with his right boot, you wondered when – if – Scotland might get a grip. Outplayed the last time these sides met at Hampden in the finals of Euro 2020, history was in danger of repeating itself. As the rain tumbled down on a windswept Hampden, a quite magnificent piece of skill from Doak relieved the gloom no end. For 18 minutes, Josko Gvardiol seemed to have the little winger tucked inside his back pocket. Receiving Tommy Conway’s first touch on the halfway line, the youngster audaciously backheeled the ball through the left-back’s legs and set off at pace. If there’s a worry over Doak it’s the lack of a final ball. He found one this time, a fine pick out presenting Scott McTominay with the chance to test Kotarski with Scotland’s first effort on goal. Better, much better. The relief was temporary. Scotland had no confidence, no comfort on the ball. Time after time, keeper Gordon lumped the ball up the park and it came straight back. The Hearts keeper’s hands will still be stinging from a ferocious Luka Sucic drive from 20 yards which restored Croatia’s relentless dominance. Truth be told, Scotland’s lack of technical craft was a depressing affair.. They couldn’t go on like this. When referee Orel Grinfeld sparked disbelief in Croatian ranks by flashing a second yellow card at Petar Sucic, it appeared to be a turning point in the game. The protests were so fevered that Kramaric earned a booking for approaching the referee when only captain Modric was allowed to do so. Not before time, Scotland had earned a break. The 2018 World Cup finalists were rattled.      Steve Clarke congratulates substitute John McGinn after his late intervention      The Tartan Army won’t forget the night McGinn emerged as a hero again The contagion of slack passing began to spread. With 57 minutes played, Josip Sutalo must have played the first misplaced pass from the visitors all night. Gifting the ball straight to Gilmour, the Napoli midfielder blew it. Instead of laying the ball off to Doak, haring into space on the right side, he slashed a wild shot high and wide. It was a terrible piece of decision making. Shooting and goalscoring has never been Gilmour’s strong suit, a point hammered home when he wildly slashed a terrific chance yards over the bar from 12 yards after dynamic wing play from Doak. The little winger might easily have scored one himself when the introduction of McGinn and Ryan Gauld almost paid instant dividends. Gauld’s delicious curling cross towards the back post would have been meat and drink for fellow substitute Lyndon Dykes. Regrettably, it fell to the smallest man on the pitch and another chance went begging. Those who suspected that the ten men were happy to escape the miserable weather with a point in the bag were disabused of the notion when Croatia substitute Marko Pasalic raced on to a wonderful Modric through ball and dinked a glorious chance wide of the far post. It’s not easy to be the best player on a pitch containing Luka Modric. Somehow Doak found a way, the irrespressible wide man the shining light and man of the match as his relentless energy and drive created the 86th-minute goal which finally put McGinn – and Scotland – back in business.

Asks IAN LADYMAN According to Lee Carsley, Harry Kane wasn’t dropped for the game against Greece. Somebody else was just given an opportunity instead. It’s nonsense, of course. Kane, the England captain, was fit to play but didn’t. So he was dropped. Left out. Excluded. Sat down. Bombed. The fact that Carsley, an honest man, was trying so hard to be diplomatic late on Thursday night in Athens speaks to the enduring sensitivity around Kane and his place in the England team. The Bayern Munich forward — 47 goals in 42 Bundesliga games and rising — is England’s record goalscorer yet the debate about his worth to his country has simmered away since he struggled to make an impact at last summer’s European Championship.   It’s quite funny, really. Gareth Southgate refused to drop Kane in the summer and there was a fuss about it. Carsley did take him out of his team in Greece and there was a fuss about that too. Hence the interim manager’s spell of tap dancing with the media as he waited to board the bus to the airport. Thursday was interesting, though. England were different without Kane. They were a little quicker, a little more direct. They played well enough. They were not three goals better than a team ranked 42nd in the world but they did deserve to win. Ollie Watkins, Kane’s replacement, did well also. He scored after seven minutes and his movement and runs off the shoulder of defenders provided options to the England midfield three of Curtis Jones, Conor Gallagher and Jude Bellingham.      Regardless of what Lee Carsley says, Harry Kane was dropped for the clash against Greece      Ollie Watkins scored just seven minutes into the game after replacing England’s record goal scorer So it was a progressive night. Some will say it was a night that provided us with the glimpse of a future without Kane. Carsley himself spoke about the potential for a group of players that has succeeded at age group level to move on to win the serious stuff. ‘We’ve seen that with Germany in the past and with Spain so why can’t that be England?’ asked Carsley, who took England U21s to European Championship success in 2023. Carsley is right to see the value of a pathway and of natural development of teams and of players. Equally, anyone who thinks that England will be better off without Kane for the World Cup in America, Mexico and Canada in 2026 is missing the point entirely. It is not Kane that England need to be without in America in two summers’ time. It is the version of Kane we have recently seen. The tired, sore, ponderous Kane. The Kane worn out and worn down by too much football. The exhausted Kane who dragged himself to Germany in the summer with all the freshness of an out of date salad bowl. This is the conundrum facing incoming England manager Thomas Tuchel when he starts work on January 1. Not whether to move on without the 31-year-old but just how to get him to the USA ready to do what he can do better than just about anybody else in European football. The good news is that Tuchel knows Kane well. He signed him for Bayern Munich in 2023 and he delivered. Speaking before Bayern were narrowly eliminated from the Champions League semi-final by Real Madrid last May, he said: ‘We have got a big personality in our dressing room on top of a great goalscorer and someone with the ability to handle pressure. ‘He has brought everything to the team that we could possibly have hoped for.’ The less palatable news is that by the time Kane gets to the World Cup in 20 months’ time —presuming England qualify — he will have been playing football for two years without any kind of real break. He will not be alone in this but these things seems to affect some footballers more than others.      Carsley (right) spoke of the potential for a group of players that has succeeded at age group level to move on to win the serious stuff      
   A schedule that began at the Euros last June will take Kane through this season and straight into next summer’s Club World Cup in America with Bayern. That finishes on July 15 and the two or three weeks he gets to cool off after that will pretty much be it before what he hopes will be his third World Cup begins in 2026. Kane continues to tell people that he feels fresh and fit but the problem is that for England at least, he rarely looks it. He was given half an hour off the bench on Thursday and will play against the Republic of Ireland as Carsley’s spell in charge comes to an end at Wembley on Sunday. The truth is that England currently do look different when Kane plays. He does slow them down a little bit at times. But — when used properly — he remains the best No9 in Europe. His record proves that, as do his weekly contributions in the Bundesliga. He has 11 goals in 10 league games so far this season with Bayern five points clear at the top of the standings. Asked about his captain on Thursday, Carsley said: ‘He’s playing on Sunday, yeah he’ll start. He’s captain, he’s so important to the team. ‘It was just a case of having a look at something different, giving someone else the experience who has not had a lot of chances to do so yet. Nothing more than that. I definitely didn’t drop Harry Kane. He’s done well for me every game he’s played and been involved with. It wasn’t a case of being dropped, far from it. It was just a case of giving someone an opportunity. ‘Ollie (Watkins) is playing in the Champions League with Aston Villa. He’s doing really well. ‘It’s great that he got a goal. It looks like a great decision then doesn’t it? Ultimately he should take a lot of credit and confidence from tonight.’ Watkins is enjoying a productive season and he does look as though he has taken steps forward under the astute guidance of Unai Emery at Villa.      Carsley has said that the England skipper will start against Republic of Ireland on Sunday      It remains to be seen whether we will ever see Kane in peak condition at a summer tournament again On Thursday he was part of an enterprising attacking line-up that also featured the two young flyers Anthony Gordon and Noni Mudueke. It gave England a fresh feel and was fun to watch. But this was Greece in the second tier of the Nations League.  Perspective is required and so is a realisation that this is unlikely to be how England play under Tuchel. Phil Foden, Cole Palmer, Bukayo Saka and possibly Jack Grealish can expect to be the German’s first cabs off the rank for the creative positions.  The challenge will be to fit Kane into a combination that also features the prodigious talent that is Bellingham. At some point England will have to move on without Kane but that time is not now. He will only be 32 when the next World Cup starts. Tuchel has been hired on an 18-month contract with a clear brief to win the tournament. It feels far fetched to think he can do it without his best goalscorer. The great imponderable is whether we will ever see Kane in peak condition at a summer tournament again. Your email address will not be published.

The winger clearly was not happy when he was withdrawn by Enzo Maresca in the 68th minute of the 1-1 draw with Arsenal at Stamford Bridge. He walked straight down the tunnel and his manager later defended him, but it led to an angry response among some observers.    Rio Ferdinand posted on X: ‘It’s disrespectful to your team-mates. I think the manager protecting him is mad, that’s a two-week fine!’ But Madueke said: ‘I literally went down the tunnel to go to the toilet and I came back 30 seconds later. If you watch a lot of games when I come off, I always going straight down the tunnel to go to the toilet. It is nothing major at all.’ Madueke starred for England during their 3-0 win in Greece on Thursday and laid on the opening goal for Ollie Watkins with an incisive run down the right.       Noni Madueke picked up criticism after he was seen heading straight down the tunnel after being substituted against Arsenal      Rio Ferdinand argued that the winger’s behaviour was ‘disrespectful’ and he should be fined      The Chelsea star was brilliant in England’s 3-0 win over Greece in Athens on Thursday evening Is he ready to rival Bukayo Saka for a starting spot in that position? ‘I don’t look at Bukayo like competition,’ he said. ‘I look at Bukayo as a team-mate who plays for England. I know his quality and he is a player that I look at to try and implement parts of his game into mine.  ‘I don’t look at him like, “I am coming for you”. The manager will make his decision and I am happy to be part of this team, and to start to make a difference for England this early on in my career is great. ‘I feel like I did my job.

MarShawn Lloyd has been on injured reserve since September 17 due to an injury in his ankle, restricting him to just a single game played this season. He was set to make a return before feeling some pain, leading to his visit to team doctors to check his abdomen.   According to Packers coach Matt LaFleur, the doctors, ‘sent him in [to the hospital], and sure enough, that’s what it is.’  Lloyd, a third-round pick from USC, was getting ready to make a return to the team and was practicing earlier this week. But now, with this sudden ailment, his recovery now faces a setback.       MarShawn Lloyd’s return from an ankle injury was set back as he deals with appendicitis ‘He’ll rebound,’ LaFleur said Friday. ‘I’m confident in that. That’s what I told him. But it is a shame, certainly.’ In the lone game he’s played this season, Lloyd rushed for 15 yards on six carries in a Sept. 15 victory over the Indianapolis Colts. The Packers selected him out of Southern California with the 88th overall pick in this year´s draft. Lloyd spent his final college season at Southern California after playing at South Carolina from 2021-22. Green Bay (6-3) also has ruled rookie guard Jordan Morgan (shoulder) out for Sunday’s game at Chicago (4-5).  Defensive lineman Colby Wooden (shoulder) is doubtful, while cornerback Jaire Alexander (knee) and safety Evan Williams (hamstring) are questionable.

Raducanu, who turned 22 on Wednesday, took care of Germany’s Jule Niemeier 6-4, 6-4 to put GB 1-0 up in the tie, before Katie Boulter, on the back of six gruelling weeks in Asia, finished things off with a 6-1, 6-2 thrashing of Laura Siegemund. GB will play Canada on Sunday and it would be unwise to put any ceiling on their chances here. The Maple Leafs may be the holders but they remain hugely reliant on Leylah Fernandez, and pre-event favourites the USA are out after their three best players all withdrew. There is a good chance of a surprise winner so why shouldn’t that be Anne Keothavong’s merry band?   Raducanu is likely to only improve as, having not played since a foot injury in September, the question here was whether the break had left her refreshed or rusty. There was certainly some oxidation about the first few games and in Raducanu’s laboured attempts to kill the match off but overall she looked a class above Niemeier, prevailing on her sixth match point.  On those missed chances, Raducanu said: ‘I have not played a match in a long time so I think these are small sharpness things that come. I am very proud of the way I regrouped and managed to close it out in the final game.’ She rushed straight to the ice baths after the match but added: ‘Physically I felt quite good, it was a good test.’ The key to victory was Raducanu’s serve: a lethal weapon during her run to the 2021 US Open title but at times a weakness thereafter.      Emma Raducanu was serenaded with happy birthday chants as she made a winning comeback      The 22-year-old was back in action after being out for two months with a foot injury       She dispatched German player Jule Niemeier 6-4, 6-4 in the Billie Jean King Cup finals       She was encouraged but said she can still gain sharpness after a triumphant return      Katie Boulter also saw off Laura Siegemund 6-1, 6-2 s Great Britain advanced past Germany  Raducanu is a ‘spot’ server rather a boomer, making up with precision for what she lacks in power, and she was deadly accurate here.  She served 10 aces, way above her season average of 3.4 per match, and several came to save break points. Niemeier could manage only a single ace and eight double faults – one of which helped Raducanu to break for 4-3 in the first set. The British No2 saved five break points in the next game, one with a gutsy second-serve ace sliced down the middle, and was largely untroubled from there. She was serenaded to the finish line by a healthy contingent of Brits, many of whom had been bussed over from Seville – the venue was changed in July, with most fans having already booked flights and hotels.  The start of the tie was delayed by a protracted battle between Spain and Poland. At 3 hours and 49 minutes, Magda Linette’s win over Sara Sorribes Tormo was the second longest Billie Jean King Cup match on record, and then Iga Swiatek made heavy weather of beating Paola Badosa to knock Spain out. Disappointment for the hosts in the women’s event, then, but here in Malaga Rafa hysteria is building. The great man made his first appearance on the practice court ahead of Spain’s first Davis Cup match on Tuesday.  There was something of a boost for the Spanish team with the premature elimination of Carlos Alcaraz from the ATP finals in Turin. The hosts’ No1 player will now have a couple of days to acclimatise to the conditions here before trying to help give Nadal a grand sendoff.         Your email address will not be published.

Lyon, seven-time champions, will lose their top-flight status at the end of the season unless they improve their situation in the eyes of French football’s financial watchdog.  It would mark another hammerblow for the game in France after Bordeaux were demoted to the fourth tier due to bankruptcy this summer.    Lyon recently announced debts of £422million and have now been banned from signing players amid a looming possible relegation, according to L’Equipe and Get French Football News.  Crystal Palace co-owner John Textor majority owns Lyon through Eagle Football Holdings. He insisted a meeting with France’s National Directorate of Control and Management ‘went well’, but the watchdog seems to have disagreed. French journalist Romain Molina has also claimed that ‘all Lyon players are on sale’ in a bid to reduce the club’s debts. They have also lost control of their payroll.       French giants Lyon are reportedly facing relegation unless they improve their finances      They recently announced debts of £422million and have now been banned from signing stars      Crystal Palace co-owner John Textor majority owns Lyon and reportedly wants to balance the books at the French side by selling his stake in the Premier League outfit Many former Premier League stars call Lyon home. Their squad boasts Wilfried Zaha, Alexandre Lacazette, Nemanja Matic, Said Benrahma, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, and Jordan Veretout.  Other highly rated European stars such as Anthony Lopes, Corentin Tolisso, Rayan Cherki, Gift Orban, and Georges Mikautadze are also on their books.  Les Gones have been haemorrhaging money year-on-year and their financial model is based on consistent Champions League qualification.  However, they have not been in Europe’s elite competition since the 2019-20 season, when a side inspired by Memphis Depay and Bruno Guimaraes reached the semi-finals.  Their women’s team is one of the most successful in the world, having won 17 league titles and three Champions Leagues. The men’s team have won seven league titles, 14 domestic cups, and have been in the top flight continuously since 1989. The Eagle Football Group portfolio owns stakes in Lyon, Palace, Botafogo of Brazil, FC Florida, and RWD Molenbeek in Belgium. Textor believes that selling the 45 per cent stake in Crystal Palace as well as some Botafogo stars could help balance the books for Lyon, as per L’Equipe.  Lyon’s situation is not unique. Many clubs in France are struggling off the back of the Covid-19 pandemic and drastically decreasing TV rights revenue.       Losing stars such as Kylian Mbappe means the French league’s appeal to broadcasters has diminished – and this has a knock-on effect on the revenue clubs are receiving      Bordeaux were relegated to the fourth tier after bankruptcy, with Andy Carroll joining them   France’s LFP (equivalent to the EFL) had hoped to sell their TV rights for around £835m for the 2024-2029 period.  However, nobody matched that price. In the end, DAZN paid around £344m, with BeIN Sports lumping in £84m – meaning the LFP barely gained half the funding they wanted, and an 11 per cent drop on the 2021-2024 period.  There are bonuses that the LFP can earn if its matches perform well on the airwaves – but there are also break clauses alongside that which could see funding withdrawn.  It does not help Ligue 1 that they have lost their major stars in recent seasons – namely Lionel Messi, Neymar, and latterly Kylian Mbappe. Nor does it help the league’s appeal to broadcasters that PSG have won 10 of the last 12 titles, with Monaco (2016-17) and Lille (2020-21) the only exceptions.  Lyon, who sit fifth in Ligue 1 managed by relative newcomer Pierre Sage, are in the Europa League this season and do have lots of players they could offload.  That should have an reasonable impact on the transfer market in January and, long-term the future is unsettling for one of France’s grandest clubs.  Your email address will not be published.

With running mate Brooks Barnhizer still working through a foot injury, however, Martinelli is embracing the opportunity to showcase his impact early. When Eastern Illinois visits Northwestern on Friday in Evanston, Ill., Martinelli will enter with a 28.3 ppg average in three games on 73.8 percent shooting. He's the first Wildcat to score 25 points or more in three straight games since December 2010. ""I'd be hard-pressed to see across the country someone who's playing any better,"" Wildcats coach Chris Collins said. ""He's just a matchup nightmare, and I'm just glad he's on my team because he keeps getting better and better."" Martinelli steered the Wildcats to an 83-74 win against Illinois-Chicago on Tuesday to open a four-game homestand, scoring 27 points on 10-for-14 shooting. Jalen Leach added 16 points for Northwestern (2-1) and Ty Berry chipped in 13. The Wildcats hope to get Barnhizer back soon. The preseason all-Big Ten pick completed warmups on Saturday at Dayton and again Tuesday night but did not play. Barnhizer averaged a team-best 7.5 rebounds last season while his 14.6 points ranked second. Eastern Illinois (1-2) has sandwiched losses at Illinois and then-No. 17 Indiana around a comfortable home victory against Division III Earlham College. The Panthers led the host Hoosiers 37-36 at halftime on Sunday but managed just 18 points after the break in a 90-55 defeat. ""It's just another stepping stone,"" Nakyel Shelton, who led Eastern Illinois with 17 points, told the student newspaper. ""Watch film, grow from it, see what we need to improve on and just making adjustments for the next good school and good program."" Northwestern, another Big Ten foe coming off consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances, fits the bill. To Kooper Jacobi, who had eight points and six boards at Indiana, the Panthers must improve on sustaining their pace and push. ""I think we were showing our ability to make shots and to be able to play with a team that's ranked,"" Jacobi said, ""and I think putting that together in the second half is our next step."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

And the Nets were not happy about it. Brooklyn will strive to bounce back from a frustrating defeat Friday night when it visits New York in NBA Cup action. The two rivals were off Thursday after losing at home Wednesday night. The Nets raced out to a 13-point first-quarter lead before falling to the Boston Celtics 139-114. The Knicks erased a 22-point deficit before Coby White sank three free throws with three seconds left to give the Chicago Bulls a 124-123 victory. The game Friday will be the NBA Cup opener for the Nets and the second East Group A game for the Knicks, who beat the host Philadelphia 76ers 111-99 on Tuesday. The Nets, whose streak of five consecutive playoff appearances ended last spring, appeared ready to embark on another rebuilding project when they made the rare intracity trade by dealing Mikal Bridges to the Knicks on July 6 for a package that included six draft picks and one pick swap. Brooklyn has multiple first-round picks in 2025, 2027, 2028 and 2029. Yet the Nets entered Thursday are a respectable 5-7 through 12 games, within just 1 1/2 games of the third-place Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference. But Wednesday's loss was the most lopsided and discouraging of the season for the Nets, who led for more than 18 minutes in the first half before being outscored 74-54 in the last two quarters. The defending NBA champion Celtics led by as many as 30 in the fourth quarter. ""I'm OK with losing but I'm not OK with at one point of the game, not fighting,"" Nets head coach Jordi Fernandez said. ""We played a pretty good half against a very good team and we come out of the half and we kept fighting. It was not going our way. But you can never, ever quit or look defeated, whatever the case may be."" Ziaire Williams led the Nets with 23 points against Boston, his first time leading the team in scoring in a game this season. The Knicks were a popular pick to contend for the NBA title after adding Bridges and Karl-Anthony Towns to a team that reached the Eastern Conference semifinals last season. Yet they are 5-6 through 11 games and have yet to win or lose more than two straight games. New York seemed destined for a substantial defeat when the Bulls led for more than 34 consecutive minutes between the first and fourth quarters and opened up a pair of 22-point leads in the third quarter. But the Knicks scored 17 straight points to end the third and mounted an 8-2 run to take a 123-121 lead on Jalen Brunson's layup with four seconds left. The potentially seismic win turned into a disappointing loss when Josh Hart fouled White and Brunson missed a potential game-winning jumper at the buzzer. ""It was a tough one -- it should have been a big statement win for us,"" Hart said. ""It (would have been) the first win where we really got hit and really turned to swing back. I've got to be better, That one is on my shoulders."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The Blue Jackets are tied for the fewest points (12) in the NHL, though the Penguins are not on a much better pace. Columbus has played only 15 games, while the Penguins have 15 points through 18 games. Mired in a six-game (0-5-1) winless drought, the Jackets' most recent defeat was a 5-2 loss to the Seattle Kraken on Tuesday. Columbus took a 2-0 lead into the first intermission, but the strong start was erased by four Kraken goals in the second period. ""It seems like for the last string of games, we're just taking one period off,"" Jackets forward Zach Aston-Reese said. ""It's just these one-period lapses where we give up like five or six odd-man rushes, couple of grade-A (scoring chances), and we just shoot ourselves in the foot."" The 0-4-1 road trip dropped the Jackets to 1-5-2 in away games this season. Friday's return to Columbus could be beneficial, as the Blue Jackets have a 4-3-0 home record this season. Neither locale has been much help to the Blue Jackets in their very lopsided rivalry with the Penguins. Dating back to the 2015-16 season, Pittsburgh is 23-4-4 against the Jackets, including an ongoing 13-game (11-0-2) points streak. Head-to-head history notwithstanding, this season's Penguins have looked anything but dominant. Pittsburgh had an 0-5-1 streak of its own in October, and the club is 1-2-2 in its last five games. Every point is crucial as the Penguins try to climb out of this early-season hole, so forward Bryan Rust saw Wednesday's 3-2 overtime loss to the Detroit Red Wings as ""a good step"" for his struggling team. Detroit held a 2-0 lead in the second period before the Penguins equalized and eventually forced overtime. ""The way we responded (when) we went down two was a hell of a lot better than the way we responded the other night,"" Rust said, referencing Monday's 7-1 loss to the Dallas Stars. ""Rome wasn't built in a day. We're trying get this thing going in the right direction as fast we can."" Pittsburgh forward Blake Lizotte is questionable for Friday's lineup following an early exit against the Red Wings. Lizotte didn't return to the ice after he was bloodied from a puck to the face during the first period. Evgeni Malkin leads the Penguins with 18 points (five goals, 13 assists), while Sidney Crosby is right behind with 17 points (six goals, 11 assists). Crosby is two goals away from becoming the 21st NHL player with at least 600 career goals. Kirill Marchenko leads the Blue Jackets with 15 points (six goals, nine assists). Since the Jackets also play Saturday in Montreal against the Canadiens, goaltenders Elvis Merzlikins and Daniil Tarasov figure to split the consecutive starts in some order. The Penguins also play on Saturday at home against the San Jose Sharks, which likely means rotating starts between Alex Nedeljkovic and Tristan Jarry over the back-to-back games. Jarry was just recalled from a conditioning stint in the AHL after the goalie posted a garish 5.47 goals-against average in his first three NHL starts this season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Washington's only two wins are against Atlanta, as the Wizards beat their Southeast Division rivals 121-119 on the road Oct. 28 and 133-120 at home on Oct. 30. Now matching up as East: Group C opponents for the second NBA in-season event, Washington will look to end its six-game losing streak. Last time out, the Wizards fell to the San Antonio Spurs 139-130 as Jordan Poole's 42 points were topped by Victor Wembanyama's career-high 50 points. Washington trailed 122-101 with seven minutes left, but Poole's layup trimmed its deficit to six with 1:40 remaining before ultimately falling. ""One thing that we've talked about with our group is resiliency,"" Wizards head coach Brian Keefe said. ""We did not start the game well, but we answered the bell and came back. (San Antonio) made a run in the fourth, and we cut it close at the end. Good progress with our team, but no more moral victories for us."" Poole's 42 points were his most since being traded to Washington in the 2023 offseason. Through ten games this season, Poole has averaged 22.2 points per contest to lead the team, up from his 17.4 per game last season. ""This is how we want Jordan to play, aggressive,"" Keefe said. ""He puts pressure on the defense. That opens up the game for everybody else."" Alongside Poole, Kyle Kuzma is averaging 15.8 points per game, followed by Bilal Coulibaly's 15.3. Playing mostly off the bench, Washington's Jonas Valancuinas has averaged 12.7 points with a team-best 7.8 rebounds. The Hawks are fresh off their best win of the season, stunning the defending champion Boston Celtics 117-116 on Tuesday in each team's first NBA Cup group-play game. Atlanta, which entered after losing three of four games, beat host Boston without Trae Young (Achilles tendinitis). Young leads the team with 23.9 points and 11.5 assists. Jalen Johnson helped to fill Young's absence with an 18-point, 12-rebound, 10-assist triple-double,  Dyson Daniels added 28 points, seven assists and six steals. Daniels, who was traded to Atlanta as part of the deal that sent Dejounte Murray to the New Orleans Pelicans, has brought a much-needed defensive mindset to the Hawks. Atlanta allowed 120.5 points per game last season, tied for second most in the NBA only to Washington. The Hawks added Daniels in hopes of creating havoc for opposing offenses and he has delivered 23 steals in his last four outings, increasing his league-leading total to 3.6 steals per game. The Wizards' Poole is second at 2.3 steals. ""His ability to impact the game is unique,"" Hawks head coach Quin Snyder said of Daniels. ""He's got a good sense of how to be solid and not gamble, but to also use his anticipation opportunistically to impact the game with steals. He's appreciated on a lot of levels.""  Offensively, Daniels has seen his scoring jump from 5.8 points to 14.3 points per game this season. Following Johnson's second-career triple-double, the fourth-year player is averaging 19.0 points and a team-best 10.2 rebounds per game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

In their opening Cup game Tuesday, the Pistons won 123-121 in overtime over the visiting Miami Heat. Despite Gradey Dick's career-best 32 points, the Raptors dropped their Cup opener 99-85 on Tuesday to the Milwaukee Bucks to end a five-game road trip. The Pistons faced the Bucks the next day and suffered a 127-120 overtime road loss after leading by 18 points. Ron Holland II missed two free throws in the final second of regulation that could have won the game. Cade Cunningham had 35 points, 11 assists, seven rebounds, three blocked shots and two steals for Detroit, which allowed a 59-point performance by Giannis Antetokounmpo. Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff looks at the NBA Cup as preparation for playoff-style games for his young team. ""Understanding possessions matter more, turnovers matter more, rebounds, execution, all those things matter more in meaningful basketball games,"" Bickerstaff said this week. The Pistons have won five games this season and appear poised to easily surpass last season's franchise-worst 14 victories, which has the players enthused. ""It's been fun, that's all I can really say,"" said Jalen Duren, who had nine points, nine rebounds and six assists on Wednesday. ""It's been super fun since the start, since preseason. Getting to know these guys, growing with these guys, even the guys that have been here, growing with them and continuing to get better and learn each other, it's been great. We've been through a lot."" The Pistons were without Tim Hardaway Jr. (head laceration), Jaden Ivey (right great toe sprain) and Simone Fontecchio (left great toe sprain) in Milwaukee. All three are day-to-day. The Raptors also are dealing with injuries, most notably Scottie Barnes (right orbital fracture) and Immanuel Quickley (left elbow UCL partial tear). Quickley missed eight games this season with a pelvic contusion suffered in the season opener. Bruce Brown (knee) and Kelly Olynyk (back) have also been out. Toronto has struggled defensively. ""We were scrambling to guard very basic actions,"" Jakob Poeltl said after Toronto's 123-103 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday. ""For sure they have good offensive players that make plays and punish mistakes, but we have to hold ourselves to a higher standard. ... We shouldn't be making mistakes like these."" In the loss to the Bucks, the Raptors committed 22 turnovers leading to 28 points. ""I really thought we were fighting and competing for 48 minutes,"" Raptors coach Darko Rajakovic said after Tuesday's loss. ""I thought turnovers were a big problem for us."" Rajakovic did take some positives from the team's attitude during the winless trip. ""They understand the situation that they're in that they're undermanned with the injuries we're dealing with,"" he said. ""The guys are showing a lot of togetherness and a lot of fight and I'm really proud of that. We've got to continue pounding, we've got to take one game at a time and focus on us and our development."" The Pistons won two of three over the Raptors last season, losing the lone game at Toronto. The last time the teams met, Duren had 24 points and a career-best 23 rebounds on March 13 when the host Pistons won 113-104. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Butker won't be on the field when the Chiefs (9-0) visit the Buffalo Bills (8-2) on Sunday trying to win an 16th consecutive game dating to last season.  Eighth among NFL kickers in points with 75 this season, Butker connected on 18 of 20 field-goal attempts and 21 of 22 extra points. Both of the missed field goals were on tries beyond 50 yards. Butker's career 89.21 field-goal percentage ranks third in NFL history. The Chiefs have won seven of nine games by a one-possession margin in 2024. Their last visit to Buffalo was a 27-24 nail-biter win in last seasons's AFC Divisional Playoffs, and the regular-season meeting with the Bills was a 20-17 loss. The Chiefs also dropped a 24-20 decision to the Bills in the 2022 regular season. A 25-year-old rookie from Notre Dame, Shrader connected on both of his field-goal attempts for the Jets last week at Arizona. He joined the Jets after being released by the Indianapolis Colts, who used Shrader in Week 1 for three successful PATs as the injury replacement for placekicker Matt Gay. He entered the NFL as an undrafted free agent and played college football only after first pursuing a pro soccer career. He enrolled at USF in 2019 and was the primary kicker for four seasons. As a graduate transfer in 2023, Shrader had four 50-yard field goals for the Fighting Irish.  Butker, 29, signed a self-negotiated four-year, $25.6 million extension in August that made him the highest-paid kicker in the NFL.  Butker set the Super Bowl record for longest field goal during the Chiefs' 25-22 overtime win over the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII earlier this year. Butker's 57-yard field goal with 5:01 left in the third quarter supplanted the previous record that had been set just one quarter earlier by 49ers rookie Jake Moody, who kicked a 55-yarder to give San Francisco an early 3-0 lead. Originally drafted out of Georgia Tech by the Carolina Panthers in the seventh round of the 2017 NFL Draft, Butker has played all seven of his NFL seasons with the Chiefs. Shrader participated in the Colts' 2024 offseason program and training camp after originally signing with the team as an undrafted free agent. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The men's basketball team could be following a similar script.   The Mustangs were picked 13th of 18 in the ACC preseason poll but have put together a promising first week of the season. Their first road test comes Friday against Butler in Indianapolis. SMU is 3-0 under new head coach Andy Enfield, taking care of business against Tarleton State, Florida A&M and UNC Greensboro by beating those teams by an average of 25.3 points.   The Mustangs have Boopie Miller to thank at the offensive end of the floor. Miller has scored 20 points in every game, becoming the first SMU player with a three-game 20-point streak since the 2021-22 season. With averages of 20.7 points and 7.7 assists per game, Miller leads all ACC players in both categories.   Miller transferred from Wake Forest, meaning he has experience in the ACC that most other SMU players do not. Matt Cross, formerly of Miami and Louisville, returned from an injury in the season opener to score eight points against UNC Greensboro.   The Mustangs also debuted Turkish big Samet Yigitoglu, who had 13 points in his first game since the NCAA affirmed his eligibility.   ""When we get our full team, I think we have great potential,"" Miller told the SMU athletics website. ""For me being ACC last year, with everybody on the floor, with everybody back, I think we're going to be a great team.""   SMU also racked up 32 steals in the first three games. B.J. Edwards has 12 to lead the conference, and Miller and Kario Oquendo have eight apiece.   Butler (2-1) was nearly on upset alert for the second straight game before putting away Western Michigan 85-65 on Monday.   The Bulldogs had a two-point lead at halftime but scored 16 of the first 18 points of the second half. After the Broncos rallied within three, Butler shut the door thanks in part to Augusto Cassia, who scored eight of his career-high 16 points in the final 6:50 of his first career start.   Pierre Brooks II led with 20 points for Butler, which previously lost 68-66 against Austin Peay.   ""It means a lot to me,"" said Cassia, a native of Brazil. ""I've worked hard the past couple years. I had a couple minor setbacks. It meant the world to me to be the starting five and help my team win (Monday), honestly.""   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Lots of zeros. A vote by the PGA of America will ultimately determine whether, and how much, U.S. players are paid for playing in the Ryder Cup.  U.S. players competing at the event could receive roughly $400,000 apiece according to a report. The pay structure, according to The Telegraph, would be similar to that of the Presidents Cup in September -- a stipend as opposed to a contribution made to the charity of each golfer's choice. However, there are two primary differences between the Presidents Cup and Ryder Cup, according to The Telegraph. First, the amount. The Presidents Cup stipend was $250,000. Second, who is getting paid. While players and captains for both teams were paid at the Presidents Cup in Montreal, the European Ryder Cup golfers will not get paid -- instead opting to play for what European captain Luke Donald called ""passion"" for golf and country. ""It's one week where you play for more than yourself,"" Donald told The Telegraph. ""It's ... not about money or points, it's about coming together as a team and the fans feed off that -- it's all passion. I don't think we should ever get paid."" Rory McIlroy was asked this week about the idea of compensation for participation in the Ryder Cup, and scoffed at the notion of requiring cash to entice players to represent their side of the international competition. McIlroy and the European team will not be directly tied to the PGA of America payment vote. The DP World Tour represents the European players on Ryder Cup matters. ""I personally would pay for the privilege to play on the Ryder Cup,"" McIlroy said in a BBC Sport interview. ""The two purest forms of competition in our game right now are the Ryder Cup and the Olympics, and it's partly because of that -- the purity of no money being involved."" McIlroy said he understands the ""other side of it"" because of the amount of money made on the event. He said Donald huddled players to discuss their stance after learning the direction American golfers were leaning. But McIlroy said the consensus for Team Europe was to donate the sum to the DP World Tour for other purposes.  ""That $5 million would be better off spent elsewhere on the DP World Tour to support other events or even to support The Challenge Tour,"" McIlroy said.  ""I think we would all welcome money if it didn't change the dynamic, but the money really would change the dynamic. That's why I think everyone is like -- let's not do that."" Shane Lowry said he worked toward getting a chance to play in the Ryder Cup and involvement was more than enough compensation.  ""I love the tournament, and I just want to be involved. I don't care whether I get paid or not,"" he told the Irish Independent.  Talks of Americans getting paid for the Ryder Cup have been brewing for decades. In 1999 at Brookline, Mass. (one of the most famous Ryder Cup weekends in the event's history), golfers including Tiger Woods voiced their opinions on players not being paid despite the event raking in several million dollars. ""I would like to see us receive whatever the amount is, whether it's $200,000, $300,000, $400,000, $500,000 and I think we should be able to keep the money and do whatever we see fit,"" Woods told The Washington Post in 1999. ""I personally would donate all of it to charity. With all the money that's being made, we should have a say in where it goes."" The charitable donations began being made that same year. Pay-for-play at the Ryder Cup became a hot-button topic during last year's competition near Rome after American Patrick Cantlay did not wear a hat during Saturday's play. Multiple reports stated he did not wear the hat as a protest for players not being paid. Cantlay denied that being the reason, instead saying the hat just did not fit. Said one anonymous European player to The Telegraph: ""(The Americans) can do whatever they want. But we don't want payments in our bank accounts, as it'll be the thin end of the wedge and is not what the Ryder Cup is about. ""Let's face it, a lot of the American players have been angling towards this for years, if not decades. ""If it does go ahead, then it will be interesting to see how the fans react at Bethpage, although they'll probably announce it as just an extension of what already happens."" The 2025 Ryder Cup is scheduled to take place Sept. 23-28. The Americans hold a 27-14 advantage all time in the event, though the Europeans have won five of the last seven contests, including a 16 1/2-11 1/2 win at Marco Simone Golf and Country Club in Italy in 2023.

First it will have to get through the visiting Chicago Bulls on Friday night.   The Cavaliers remained perfect with a 114-106 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday night. They continue to work toward a 24-0 mark, the record the Golden State Warriors achieved to start the 2015-16 campaign before taking a loss in Game 25 of the season.   Darius Garland collected 25 points and Donovan Mitchell added 23 to go along with 13 rebounds and nine assists to carry Cleveland past the Knicks. The Cavs trailed by as many as eight in the third quarter.   Mitchell realizes the historical start places a massive target on the back of the Cavaliers, meaning every opponent will bring their A-game against them as long as the winning streak is alive.   ""We're hunting, but it's also November,"" Mitchell said. ""I keep telling everybody, let's relax. I'm saying it is November. We're not winning a championship right now. But these are good tests.   ""The fact that we're 13-0 is great. We could be 9-2. It doesn't really matter to me. I think the biggest thing is how do we just continue to build the habits through getting every team's best shot on a night-by-night basis.""   Chicago certainly challenged Cleveland on Monday night when the game was knotted at 106 with 5:06 left in regulation. The Bulls faded down the stretch in what ended up being a 119-113 loss.   Zach LaVine paced the Bulls with a team-high 26 points on 12-of-20 shooting, then went off for 31 points in a narrow 124-123 win over the Knicks on Wednesday. LaVine also supplied seven boards and eight assists against New York.   ""Pretty sharp,"" LaVine said of his offensive game as of late. ""Let's keep it that way.""   There's an off chance that guard Lonzo Ball is ready to rejoin the Bulls. The oft-injured point guard missed the past eight games due to a right wrist sprain.  Bulls coach Billy Donovan isn't getting his hopes up.   ""I know he was optimistic and hopeful to get back this upcoming weekend,"" Donovan said. ""I don't know if that's realistic. That's what he was shooting for. We're not ruling that out, but a lot of that is going to depend on how he progresses. ... When he starts shooting threes, how does that respond?""   Ball was used off the bench in three games this season before being sidelined with the injury. Coby White and Josh Giddey have been starting in the backcourt. They have their hands full with Garland and Mitchell on Friday.   ""We're just sticking together,"" Garland said. ""Just taking it game by game. We know we've got a target on our back, so we've got to come in with that aggressiveness and that confidence that we're going to win every game, and that's what we've been doing.

He matched his career high of eight receptions while increasing his consecutive games with a catch streak to 41. Becht is still stunned that an undefeated start disintegrated so fast. ""All the work that you put in to get to 7-0, and then those two losses coming out like that, it's tough to move on,"" Becht said. Another challenge for the Cyclones is that Tyson Veidt is Cincinnati's defensive coordinator. He served as Cyclones assistant head coach the past eight seasons before moving on to the Bearcats. ""Obviously, we are playing Iowa State, a defense that we hired coach Tyson from, so it gives us more familiarity with their defense,"" Bearcats coach Scott Satterfield said. ""I think having gone against it in the spring and in the summer, so we'll have a better idea about it."" Cincinnati (5-4, 3-3) has dropped two straight games, including a frustrating 31-24 to visiting West Virginia last weekend. The Bearcats held a 436-248 edge in total offense and owned a 24-10 edge in first downs. But three turnovers by Cincinnati quarterback Brendan Sorsby (one interception, two fumbles) led to 17 West Virginia points. ""We've got to take care of the football, bottom line,"" Satterfield said. ""Turnover margin is one of the most important stats you can win to be able to win the game, particularly if they take those for (two) touchdowns and that's what happened."" Last season, Becht passed for 241 yards and two touchdowns as Iowa State posted a 30-10 home win over Cincinnati. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Orlando dropped five straight, including the first four of the eight games All-Star forward Paolo Banchero has missed due to a torn right oblique. The Magic have regrouped amid a four-game homestand, which concludes with Friday's NBA Cup contest. In all four wins of the streak, Orlando held its opponents to 94 points or fewer, including the 89 the Magic gave up in a 25-point victory over Charlotte to open NBA Cup play on Tuesday. Orlando limited the Hornets to 34-of-84 shooting from the floor and forced them into 22 turnovers. The Magic followed that up on Wednesday by holding Indiana to 32-of-84 shooting from the floor with 16 turnovers in a 94-90 Orlando win. ""So proud of this group,"" coach Jamahl Mosley said of the Magic's defensive tenacity. ""We talk about how much grit this team is. You see how connected they are. ... That's part of this league, and part of growth of a group that's finding ways to win."" Along with Orlano's defensive effort, Franz Wagner's offensive production has been a consistent theme on this run. He enters Friday's contest averaging 27.8 points during the win streak after Wednesday's 29-point effort. Goga Bitadze has also come up big for Orlando. His 12-point, 12-rebound performance on Wednesday marked his third double-double since Nov. 6. ""He gave us that spark. Got a little chippy, but we're OK with that, and he's OK with that,"" Mosley said of Bitadze. ""He plays with that little bit of edge."" Bitadze's assignment on Friday includes slowing down former Most Valuable Player Joel Embiid, who returned to the 76ers' lineup for the first time this season on Tuesday. Philadelphia was without Embiid, Tyrese Maxey and Paul George for the second leg of a back-to-back on Wednesday, however. The Sixers dropped their seventh game in the last eight outings with a 114-106 home loss to undefeated Cleveland. Wednesday's setback followed a 111-99 defeat in Philadelphia's NBA Cup group-play opener vs. New York on Tuesday. Embiid scored 13 points on just 2-of-11 shooting in his season debut. With Embiid and George resting and Maxey nursing a strained a hamstring strain until at least the end of the week, rookie Jared McCain went for career highs of 34 points and 10 assists against Cleveland. ""It's a tribute to my work. I work so hard, I feel like I need these games,"" McCain said. ""I'm starting to learn more being a lead guard. In college, I feel like I was more off-ball. So it's definitely a learning process there. ""I'm finding my shot, whether it's the mid-range, getting to the rim or obviously shooting the (3-pointer)."" Sixers coach Nick Nurse suggested McCain's play could earn the first-year guard a prominent role even after Embiid, George and Maxey are available. ""He's certainly played his way into the whole mix for sure,"" Nurse said. ""Responded well to his start, but he's got to be a candidate playing this well to get into the lineup."" Fellow Sixers rookie Adem Bona also earned Nurse's praise for his nine-rebound effort off the bench vs. Cleveland. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The Bruins (2-1) fell out of the AP Top 25 poll after a 72-64 loss to New Mexico in Henderson, Nev., on Nov. 8, but rebounded emphatically with a 71-40 rout of Boston University on Monday.  UCLA's first game in its lengthy homestand began without Dylan Andrews, who was scratched from the lineup shortly before tipoff due to a groin injury. He is day-to-day and could play in Friday's contest.  With Andrews out, Eric Dailey Jr. and Lazar Stefanovic led the way in scoring with 13 points each, while Sebastian Mack added 12 points off the bench. Tyler Bilodeau, who scored 18 and 23 points against Rider and New Mexico, respectively, had a more subdued performance with six points on Monday.  Although UCLA cruised in its return home, turnovers remained an issue.  The Bruins committed 15 turnovers on Monday, down from the 21 they gave up vs. New Mexico but still well above the season-long average of less than 11 each of the previous four UCLA teams surrendered per game.   ""We're trying to move the ball more. When you emphasize passing, they're going to have more turnovers,"" Bruins coach Mick Cronin said. ""There's risk-reward when you're a high ball-movement team."" Lehigh (0-3) comes into Los Angeles for the final leg of a four-game road swing to open its season. The Mountain Hawks opened with a 90-46 loss to UCLA's new Big Ten Conference counterpart Northwestern but were much more competitive in 85-77 and 76-75 losses at Georgetown and Columbia, respectively.  In Tuesday's loss at Columbia, Keith Higgins Jr. (28 points) hit a 3-pointer with five seconds remaining to tie the game at 75, but Cam Gillus was called for a foul on the ensuing Lions possession. Columbia's Avery Brown made a game-winning free throw with less than a second remaining.  ""We can't control the whistle at all times, but what we can do is control our effort on the glass,"" Lehigh coach Dr. Brett Reed said via the school's official athletic site. ""During that stretch of time when Columbia extended their lead, it came from extra possessions, extra opportunities and finishes at the rim.""  Against the Lions, the Mountain Hawks gave up 16 offensive boards on Tuesday which Columbia converted into 18 second-chance points. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The Heat are 0-1 in NBA Cup East: Group B play, while the Pacers will be playing their first game of the in-season competition that culminates next month. Losers in four of their past five games, the Heat could be without Jimmy Butler, who came away with an ankle injury in Friday's loss to the Denver Nuggets and has not played in the past two games. Butler did not participate in practice Thursday.  Miami's Tyler Herro is doing all he can, notching his second career 40-point game against the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday, when the Heat's undoing was a puzzling coaching mishap from Erik Spoelstra in the final seconds. Spoelstra requested a timeout when his team was out of them after the Pistons tied the game with 1.1 seconds remaining in overtime.  Instead of having the ball in a situation that would have extended the game to a second overtime at worst, Spoelstra's technical foul sent the Pistons to the free-throw line for a go-ahead free throw in an eventual 123-121 loss.  The loss put the Heat two games under .500 and left Spoelstra despondent after the game.  ""I feel horrible about it,"" Spoelstra said. ""There's really no excuse for that. I'm 17 years in, we had talked about it in the huddle, I knew that we didn't have anything. I just got emotional and reactive on that, and I just made a horrendous mistake there at the end."" The Pacers were unable to build off a 132-121 home win over the New York Knicks on Sunday and lost 94-90 to the Orlando Magic on Wednesday. They scored only 83 points in a road loss to the Charlotte Hornets on Friday. Indiana's Bennedict Mathurin led the Pacers with a career-high 38 points in the win over the Knicks, helping push his season average to 19.7 points per game. Pascal Siakam leads the team at 20.5 points.  The Pacers couldn't overcome a rough shooting night from Tyrese Haliburton against the Magic on Wednesday. Haliburton scored nine points on 3-of-14 shooting (21.4 percent), including 2 of 8 from 3-point range. Haliburton scored six points on 2-of-11 shooting against the Hornets on Friday, but sandwiched between those performances was a 35-point, 14-assist outing against the New York Knicks. Haliburton is averaging 16 points per game, just behind Myles Turner's 16.8 points per game. Haliburton also has a team-high 8.5 assists, but both his scoring and assist averages are down from a year ago in the early going. The Pacers have been challenged by the schedule to start the season, with much of the action against playoff teams from a season ago. ""We've got to fight and claw for everything at this point in the season,"" Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle said. ""These first 10 or 12 games are as tough as anybody's schedule in the league and so we've got to make it about the collective group, and who we are and what we're trying to stand for.""  For the Heat, Herro is averaging a career high 24.9 points to lead the team and trails only Bam Adebayo in minutes per game with 33.5. Herro also has averages of 5.2 rebounds and 5.3 assists. Butler is second on the team with 16.1 points per game, while playing in eight of the team's 10 contests, while Adebayo is averaging 15.3 points and 9.1 rebounds. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The public declaration of moving on from the running-back-by-committee setup confirmed what already was evident, with Dowdle making seven starts this season to two for Elliott. The former undrafted free agent out of South Carolina also leads the team in carries (83) and yards rushing (374). ""Definitely, you have to get him the ball,"" McCarthy told reporters about Dowdle. ""That's my focus to continue to get him opportunities. He's the lead back."" Without a rushing touchdown this season, Dowdle does have three receiving TDs on 24 catches for 166 yards. It has been a rough season for the Cowboys, who are just 3-6 and on a four-game losing streak after Sunday's 34-6 domination by the Philadelphia Eagles. Dowdle's 53 yards rushing against the Eagles were more than the 45 yards passing from quarterback Cooper Rush on 23 attempts. Dowdle, 26, is in his fourth NFL season, not counting 2021, which he missed with a hip injury. He was the third-string back in 2022 and was backup to Tony Pollard last season. Elliott, drafted by the Cowboys with the No. 4 overall pick in 2016, spent seven seasons with Dallas before signing a one-year free agent deal with the New England Patriots in 2023. In his return to the Cowboys in 2024, the 29-year-old Elliott has just 171 yards on 54 carries with two touchdowns. Dowdle has played in 44 career games since 2020 but did not make a start until this season. He has gained 759 yards rushing with two touchdowns on 179 carries and also has 41 career receptions for 310 yards and five TDs.

The main storyline will be whether the team can continue its scalding 3-point shooting. After sinking 18 3-pointers in a win over Southern, Iowa followed up with 13 against South Dakota, giving the team 41 in three games. It's not a case of saturation shooting, either. The Hawkeyes are shooting 41.0 percent from distance. Washington State (3-0) has gotten off to a fast start under first-year coach David Riley. The Cougars' latest win came Monday night when they blasted Idaho 90-67. Five players scored in double figures, led by Nate Calmese with a game-high 18 points. Riley has changed the team's style of play significantly, going to a more up-tempo approach. So far, Washington State is averaging 93.7 points per game and has seven players averaging in double figures. ""I think we're gonna have a balanced attack,"" Riley said. ""When you look at our stats the last few years, we've had five or six guys near double figures.""

The Peach State Classic -- a multi-team event co-hosted by Georgia Tech and Georgia that also featured North Florida and Texas Southern -- concluded earlier this week. Clemson transfer RJ Godfrey notched career highs of 21 points and 12 rebounds, and Georgia (3-0) had six double-digit scorers overall in a 90-77 win over North Florida on Tuesday. Asa Newell, a 6-foot-11 freshman, leads the Georgia offense at 17.7 points per game. Five other Bulldogs are averaging double figures, including graduate transfer Dakota Leffew (17.0) who is shooting 50 percent (11 of 22) from 3-point range. Georgia coach Mike White said Friday's matchup will provide an important early road test for the Southeastern Conference team. ""That's why we played at Charlotte (in an exhibition game),"" White said. ""Playing on the road will be one factor, but guarding (Georgia Tech's) guards and blocking them out and sprinting back in transition and scoring against their different coverages that they show us will be the bigger factors on just the basketball side of it."" Georgia Tech (2-1) will be playing its fourth of seven consecutive home games to start the season.  Coach Damon Stoudamire's team rebounded from a 12-point loss to North Florida on Sunday to defeat Texas Southern 81-62 on Tuesday as Baye Ndongo (19 points, 11 rebounds) led five Yellow Jackets scoring in double figures. ""I'm looking forward to Friday. It will be a great day, great evening, be a packed gym,"" Stoudamire said. ""We'll have Dennis's ceremony, so I'm looking forward to it. I'm excited and I'm looking to see ... we lose to North Florida, we win (Tuesday), can we respond on Friday? It's an SEC team, it is a rivalry game and I'm interested, like I said, to see how we respond to that."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The Eagles (7-2) have a five-game winning streak and overtook the Commanders (7-3) for first place in the NFC East on Sunday, when Philadelphia demolished Dallas and Washington lost a nail-biter to Pittsburgh. Forget the short week of practice, Dan Quinn was ready to lead his Commanders into Philadelphia by Monday. ""I'm fired up about it. ... This is what division games should be -- an absolute blast,"" the first-year Washington coach said. ""Philadelphia and Washington battling for it? Hell yeah!"" Eagles coach Nick Sirianni was a little less psyched about the prime-time matchup, calling the quick-turnaround Thursday night games ""a pain in the butt to prepare for"" during his Monday press conference. ""It's just that everything gets crammed into a shorter amount of time,"" Sirianni said. ""So that's what we're working through right now, is I think a lot of guys will have big bags under their eyes at the end of the week, but we've got to do what we need to do as coaches to get the guys ready."" ODDS AND TRENDS The Eagles had settled in as consensus 4.0-point favorites by mid-day Thursday. They have been the slightly more popular choice at BetRivers, where the Eagles have been backed by 56 percent of the spread-line tickets and 57 percent of the money. Meanwhile, the book reported that the Commanders have failed to cover the spread in six of their last seven games against teams with a winning record. Philadelphia's -195 moneyline to win the game outright has also drawn 66 and 91 percent of the action, respectively. Eight of Washington's past nine road games have gone over the total points line, and BetRivers has seen 74 percent of the money on the 49.0-point line supporting the Over ahead of this matchup. PROP PICKS --Terry McLaurin Over 4.5 Receptions (-135 at DraftKings): This has been the most popular player prop at the book. The Commanders' wide receiver has averaged 6.6 targets and 4.7 receptions per game this season. That includes at least five catches in four of his past five games, with the lone exception being a touchdown on both of his two receptions against the New York Giants in Week 9. McLaurin has at least 98 receiving yards in three of his past four games. --DeVonta Smith Over 52.5 Receiving Yards (-131 at BetRivers): This has drawn 2.1 percent of all money wagered on player props at the book, leading all options. Smith had only two catches for 14 yards last week, but he wasn't needed much in the blowout win at Dallas. In his other seven games this season, Smith has topped 52.5 receiving yards six times. And with A.J. Brown healthy, the Commanders won't be able to consistently slide coverage toward Smith, who has at least 64 receiving yards in six of his past seven home games. KEY STATS Commanders rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels has not thrown an interception in five consecutive games, while Eagles counterpart Jalen Hurts has thrown at least two touchdown passes in each of the past four meetings. He also has scored at least two rushing touchdowns in three of his past four games overall. THE NEWS Philadelphia's defense enters Week 11 ranked No. 2 in the NFL in yards allowed (274.1 per game) and tied for fifth in points allowed (17.9 per game). ""We've improved as a defense, but I know we feel we have a lot more to grow,"" Eagles linebacker Nakobe Dean said. ""I don't think you ever say that you have ‘arrived' as a defense. It doesn't work that way in this league."" The Philly defense will be tested by a rookie quarterback who has ""arrived."" Daniels has completed 68.7 percent of his passes for 2,147 yards with nine touchdowns and just two interceptions through 10 starts, adding 464 yards and four scores on the ground. The Washington offense is tied for third in the NFL in scoring (29.0 points per game) and ranks fourth with 377.0 yards per game. The Commanders let a 10-point, second-half lead slip away against the Steelers, losing on Russell Wilson's 32-yard TD pass to new teammate Mike Williams with 2:22 to play. The loss stung, but right guard Sam Cosmi wanted to make sure it didn't linger and addressed the Commanders in the locker room after the game. ""I wanted them to know that what we have here is still special,"" Cosmi told reporters. ""Like no matter what, we still keep fighting."" INJURY REPORT The Eagles welcomed starting left tackle Jordan Mailata (hamstring) back to practice this week and activated him from injured reserve on Wednesday, clearing the way for his return Thursday night. Cornerback Darius Slay (ankle), tight end Dallas Goedert (ankle) and Dean (groin) were full participants in Wednesday's practice after being limited on Tuesday. Receiver DeVonta Smith is dealing with a hamstring injury and has been limited in practice all week. Recently acquired cornerback Marshon Lattimore (hamstring) did not practice with the Commanders all week and was ruled out for the game, along with kicker Austin Seibert (right hip) and linebacker Nick Bellore (knee). Running back Brian Robinson Jr. (hamstring) has missed the last two games but was taken off the injury report and will be active for the game. The Commanders listed as questionable left tackle Brandon Coleman (shoulder), offensive tackle Cornelius Lucas (ankle) and right tackle Andrew Wylie (shoulder) after they were limited in practice.  SERIES HISTORY The Commanders and Eagles will meet again in Week 16 in Landover, Md. Philadelphia has won five of the last six meetings, including season sweeps during the 2021 and 2023 campaigns. PREDICTION The Commanders are coming off a hard-fought loss against Pittsburgh, but have still won seven of their past nine games. At least they don't have to go a long distance on a short week. The Eagles are rolling and their veteran leadership is a definite advantage in a contest that could go a long way toward deciding the division champion and home-field advantage come playoff time. --Eagles 27, Commanders 24 --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

He’s closer to social security than his physical prime.  Paul, famed for his YouTube rise and a reputation in the ring built on hand-picked opponents, has heavy fists for a marketing-minded businessman but fights Friday with heavier pockets and zero conscience. Never in professional boxing would Tyson be expected to tap out. Even at 58, throwing in the towel is a foreign concept to the grandfatherly “Iron Mike,” who enters the very loosely sanctioned bout in Texas with the ring presence of a very loosely leashed incapacitated predator. The made-for-Netflix match is going to make money. Fittingly, a personal injury law firm dropped $2 million for the best seats in the house, taking a big bite of the hook from a promotion company Paul controls, to be close enough to know whether legends falling in the ring will make a sound. It all has the appeal equal to that of a car wreck with onlookers bracing to see the worst while tapping the brakes just enough to display a modicum of public humanity. Tyson is party to the circus only to the extent the temperamental lion does what it needs to do for the rich reward of its next meal under the big top.  Nearly two decades removed from his last meaningful fight—June 11, 2005—against Ireland’s Kevin McBride—Tyson isn’t getting in the ring to add pelts to his wall. His fighting legacy is secured. But the $80 million purse, a $20 million guarantee—that’s the carrot Tyson chased to Texas. Paul, 27, was eight when Tyson was stopped by McBride in the sixth round as the surprising final chapter in a celebrated heavyweight career.Hope as we might, this isn’t a fight-your-dad fable where Pops wallops the kid to zip his lips once and for all. Yes, Paul walks into the ring Friday with the lion’s leash wrapped around his wrist, knowing Tyson stands as much as a puncher’s chance. But that longshot outcome is likely only if Tyson can excavate the long-lost hand speed and power combination that first brought him to glory as a heavyweight boxing champion at age 20 in 1986. Jake Paul was born in 1997. Glory, greed and self-aggrandizing are the title belts draped around Paul when he steps through the ropes this weekend. Sadly, ineptly, Tyson stared blankly Wednesday in Texas while Paul masqueraded through legends of the ring and taunted the now-Silent Mike to keep striking matches until the fire appears. ""I fear no man. I want him to be that old, savage Mike. He says he's going to kill me. ‘Is that what you're going to do?’” Paul said, begging for Tyson to react. “I want there to be no excuses when I knock him out. Is that what you're going to do?"" The lion sleeps. That flame is gone. No one would expect the 50-win Tyson to find his way to the ring, by any realistic measure of energy, effectiveness or clout.  If Tyson leaves with anything but his seventh career loss, it would be an upset. A one-time 42-1 favorite over Buster Douglas in 1990, who delivered the greatest upset of Tyson’s career, the longshot bet on Friday night will be lucky to remain upright past his bedtime. With Tyson speaking only with his eyes other than a declaration that he’s “just ready to fight,” Paul kept the jabs going and perhaps unintentionally framed the charade in the only context that matters. “It is ... I don't know,” Paul smirked surveying what was one The Baddest Man on the Planet.  “It is pretty boring. Pretty fucking boring.”  Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The Eagles (1-1) have not won any of the four all-time meetings between the programs -- this is the first since 2003 -- and look to bounce back from losing 80-55 to VCU last Friday in the Veterans' Classic in Annapolis, Md. Despite a team-high 17 points from Donald Hand Jr. and Roger McFarlane recording a double-double with 11 points and 11 rebounds, fourth-year coach Earl Grant's team shot just 29.3 percent and allowed 24 points off 17 turnovers. ""(VCU) obviously capitalized on our mistakes, and a lot of our mistakes were uncharacteristic,"" Grant said. ""I'm glad it (was) the second game of the year. I think we're a lot better than what we showed."" As of Thursday, Hand was the third-leading scorer in the Atlantic Coast Conference, averaging 19.5 points per game alongside 9.0 rebounds. ""He's kind of paid his dues,"" Grant said. ""He's been loyal and been around the program, kind of like an elder statesman at this point. And even though he's ... only (in his second year) on the court and really hadn't had the opportunity (for) playing time. Now he's in a new role, and he stepped up by playing good basketball."" Temple (3-0) is now chasing its first 4-0 start since 2019 following a 69-61 win over Drexel on Tuesday. In the Owls' first Big 5 game of the season, Philadelphia native Zion Stanford netted a career-high 23 points of 9-ofo-13 shooting with two 3-pointers. Continuing that success on the road is the focus now. ""That's what good teams do, right? You have to win in nonconference play away from home,"" Temple coach Adam Fisher said. ""Good teams take care of your games at home. We had two in November, took care of that. ... This will be our first opportunity in a true road game, against an ACC school. We're trying to build this team so we can play meaningful games in March."" Jamal Mashburn Jr. added 20 points against the Dragons after eclipsing that number in the first two games against Sacred Heart and Monmouth.

With less than 12 weeks until Bow,"The 2024 NASCAR season is in the books and the clock already is ticking on one of the shortest offseasons in sports. With less than 12 weeks until Bowman Gray Stadium hosts the Busch Clash on Feb. 2, here are the storylines you need to know going into the 2025 season. New Faces in New Places NASCAR free agency arguably has never been more chaotic than it is right now. Whether due to retirements, team closings or expiring contracts, a host of drivers will be with new organizations in 2025. The most notable individual of the bunch is Chase Briscoe, who will take over the No. 19 Toyota at Joe Gibbs Racing following the retirement of Martin Truex Jr. and the closure of Stewart-Haas Racing. It's an excellent opportunity in his young career, and 2025 has the potential to be a huge year for a driver still trying to prove that he's a perennial contender. Two other Stewart-Haas alumni have found Cup Series opportunities for 2025 as well. Josh Berry will run his second Cup Series season with the fabled Wood Brothers following the departure of Harrison Burton, while Noah Gragson will take over the vacant seat at Front Row Motorsports left by 2021 Daytona 500 winner Michael McDowell. Spire Motorsports will be the next team to employ McDowell's services behind the wheel, as he'll join the up-and-coming organization in 2025, driving the No. 71 Chevrolet Camaro. The No. 71 was left vacant after it was announced that Zane Smith would leave Spire at the conclusion of 2024. There are quite a few seats still open for the 2025 season as of this writing. Rick Ware Racing has yet to confirm a driver for 2025, leaving the future of Corey LaJoie, who finished out the season driving the team's No. 51 Ford in doubt. 23XI Racing and the aforementioned Front Row Motorsports are both expected to run a third entry next season, though the teams' ongoing antitrust lawsuit against NASCAR could potentially hinder those plans. Kaulig Racing also has yet to announce a driver for their second full-time Cup Series entry, while Team AmeriVet has not announced a driver for what is expected to be a 15-17 race schedule in 2025. Will Kyle Busch bounce back? Busch's 2024 season made headlines, but for all the wrong reasons. His 20th Cup Series campaign was his first without a win and his worst year statistically since his rookie season in 2005. The two-time champ is capable of winning on any given Sunday, but the No. 8 team and Richard Childress Racing have work to do in order to get back to their winning ways. Will Penske retain its momentum? It's safe to say that Roger Penske is at the top of the motorsports mountain for the time being. After winning the Rolex 24 at Daytona, the Indianapolis 500 and his third consecutive NASCAR Cup Series championship with Joey Logano, the 87-year-old racing mogul and his team have shown how to consistently win championships in NASCAR's playoff era. Ryan Blaney, the 2023 champion, has proven himself to be one of the top drivers in the sport, while the indomitable Logano can never be counted out of contention, as his 2024 title run showed. How will Hendrick, Gibbs respond? Hendrick Motorsports and Joe Gibbs Racing dominated the first half of the 2024 season, but both were shockingly torn down by Penske in the playoffs. Their lack of firepower in the postseason was extremely surprising, as only one car of the eight fielded by the two four-car operations -- Hendrick Motorsports' William Byron -- made it to the Championship 4. Hendrick and Gibbs each boast four of the top drivers in the sport, and both Rick Hendrick and Joe Gibbs have to be motivated to reach the top of the mountain again in 2025. Which young driver will take the biggest step forward? The Cup Series is littered with young talent going into 2025. Gragson, Tyler Reddick, Christopher Bell, Chase Elliott and Blaney make up only part of a young core that makes the NASCAR Cup Series so competitive. However, one young talent is lurking in the shadows: Michigan's Carson Hocevar, who ran away with the Rookie of the Year award in 2024. With a growing Spire Motorsports behind him and a year of Cup Series experience under his belt, don't be surprised if he takes massive strides in 2025 en route to his first career win or a potential playoff berth. --Samuel Stubbs, Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The Cavaliers (2-0) will aim to remain undefeated under interim coach Ron Sanchez when they battle Villanova on Friday at the Hall of Fame Series in Baltimore. Sanchez is still less than a month into his new role. He was entering his second season as Virginia's associate head coach before being promoted after NCAA championship-winning coach Tony Bennett retired abruptly on Oct. 18. The Cavaliers have so far held their own since the seismic coaching change. Virginia began Sanchez's tenure with a 65-56 win over Campbell before cruising past Coppin State 62-45 on Monday. ""Big picture, I would say we've been resilient,"" San Diego State transfer Elijah Saunders said. ""We've been through a lot in this past month."" Saunders, who ranks second on the team with an average of 13 points per game, is confident the Cavaliers are prepared for their first battle against a major conference foe. ""Different level of physicality, different level of size,"" Saunders said of the Wildcats, a Big East member. ""And we have a young group, so it'll be some guys' first time seeing that level of talent on the floor, but I'm excited. I think we're ready for the challenge."" Like Virginia, Villanova (2-2) knows the sting of suddenly losing an iconic head coach. The Wildcats endured that strife when Jay Wright departed after the 2021-22 season, ending a 21-year tenure that included two national titles. Third-year coach Kyle Neptune has gone 37-35 since taking over for Wright. Villanova suffered a stunning 90-80 home loss to Columbia on Nov. 6 and fell 83-76 to Saint Joseph's in Philadelphia on Tuesday. Fifth-year senior Eric Dixon, who played under Wright during his freshman and sophomore seasons, said this year's Wildcats have shown grit amid their struggles. ""We had plenty of chances to lay down and fold (on Tuesday), but we came back and we fought, fought, and fought,"" Dixon said. ""At the end of all of it, it's all you can ask for, so I really like that about us."" Dixon leads Villanova in scoring (26.3 points per game) and rebounding (8.3 per game). After the Wildcats battle the Cavaliers on Friday, Penn State will face Virginia Tech to close out the Baltimore leg of the Hall of Fame Series. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Given who's next on the Hokies' schedule, that leap came just in time.  Virginia Tech (3-0) will try to slow down Penn State's high-powered offense on Friday when the teams meet at the Hall of Fame Series in Baltimore. The Hokies clamped down against the Eagles following what Young called a ""next to deplorable"" defensive effort in Friday's 93-74 win over South Carolina Upstate. Virginia Tech held Winthrop to 34.5 percent shooting after letting the Spartans shoot 50.9 percent from the floor. ""We weren't very connected (on Friday) and I thought the complete flip of that was (Monday),"" Young said. Young's squad will be tested by the Nittany Lions (3-0), who have scored at least 90 points in each of their first three games for the first time since the 1995-96 season. Penn State put up 108 and 103 points in wins over Binghamton and UMBC, respectively, before hanging 92 on visiting St. Francis in a 30-point win Tuesday. Puff Johnson scored a career-high 20 points to pace the Nittany Lions in Tuesday's victory, but Penn State's offense has been all about balance. The Nittany Lions have had a different top scorer in each game, and Northern Illinois transfer Yanic Konan Niederhauser (15 points per game) leads a cast of five players who average double figures. Penn State coach Mike Rhoades doesn't have a clear go-to scorer, but he seems just fine with how his offense is running. ""When the ball is hot and everybody's getting a piece of it, I think that creates confidence,"" Rhoades said. "" ... When guys share the ball and you go from good shots to great shots, the rim gets bigger."" Like the Nittany Lions, the Hokies have multiple scoring threats. Toibu Lawal (14.3 points per game) leads the pack, while Mylyjael Poteat (12.7), Jaden Schutt (12.0) and Jaydon Young (11.0) round out Virginia Tech's double-digit scorers. Lawal also is the Hokies' top rebounder (8.7 per game). The VCU transfer paired 10 points with 10 boards in Monday's win. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The need for the interim home in Tampa, Fla., comes on the heels of the extensive damage incurred at Tropicana Field by Hurricane Milton on Oct. 9. ""We deeply appreciate that the Yankees have graciously allowed us to play at Steinbrenner Field for the 2025 season,"" Rays principal owner Stuart Sternberg said. ""The hurricane damage to Tropicana Field has forced us to take some extraordinary steps, just as Hurricanes Helene and Milton have forced thousands of families and businesses in our community to adapt to new circumstances as we all recover and rebuild."" ""The Trop"" is not expected to be playable for MLB games until the 2026 season, according to a report released Tuesday by the city of St. Petersburg, Fla. ""We are happy to extend our hand to the Rays and their fans by providing a major league-quality facility for them to utilize this season,"" said Hal Steinbrenner, chairman and managing general partner of Yankee Global Enterprises, which owns the Yankees. ""Both the Yankees organization and my family have deep roots in the Tampa Bay region, and we understand how meaningful it is for Rays players, employees and fans to have their 2025 home games take place within 30 minutes of Tropicana Field. ""In times like these, rivalry and competition take a back seat to doing what's right for our community, which is continuing to help families and businesses rebound from the devastation caused by hurricanes Helene and Milton."" Per the Tampa Bay Times, the Rays opted for Steinbrenner Field -- which features a capacity of 11,026 -- over BayCare Ballpark in Clearwater, Fla. The latter park is the spring home of the Philadelphia Phillies. ""Given the significant challenges caused by Hurricane Milton, I appreciate the hard work and collaboration between the two teams that allowed the Rays to make the best decision for next season,"" MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said. ""This outcome meets Major League Baseball's goals that Rays' fans will see their team play next season in their home market and that their players can remain home without disruption to their families."" It is not immediately known what plans are in place for the Yankees' Class-A Tarpons, who play at Steinbrenner Field in the summer.

But Friday, the two finally will play again, meeting in Ann Arbor, Mich., with each looking for a key non-conference win. Michigan won that only other matchup, winning 82-60 on Dec. 13, 1962. Friday's game will be the first of a home-and-home series that will see Michigan visit Fort Worth, Texas, in 2025. For TCU, it will be its first game against an opponent from a power conference after recording three straight wins to start the season over Florida A&M (105-59), Florida Gulf Coast (67-51) and Texas State (76-71). ""I know they are big, I know they are skilled,"" TCU coach Jamie Dixon said of Michigan. ""I'm excited about it. Whoever we play, I'm going to be excited. I want to get better, and that's what I told our guys."" The glaring concern for TCU through the first three games has been free-throw shooting. The Horned Frogs have made just 35 of 62 shots (56.5 percent) from the line. On the other side, Michigan comes in at 1-1 following a 72-70 loss to Wake Forest on Sunday on a neutral court in Greensboro, N.C. It's a new era for the Wolverines, who hired Dusty May as head coach from Florida Atlantic and have seen a big roster turnover. Only three players (Will Tschetter, Nimari Burnett, Jace Howard) are back from last year, with six transfers and four freshmen comprising the rest of the roster. Given that, it might take some time this season for the Wolverines to jell. Auburn transfer Tre Donaldson (13.0 points per game) and Ohio State transfer Roddy Gayle (12.0) lead the Wolverines in scoring through the first two games.

A top-25 overall recruit and top-five dual threat quarterback at most major recruiting outlets, Jones is a senior at Jacksonville's Mandarin High School. He's on the list of reported recruits attending Florida's game Saturday against LSU along with prep teammate and five-star wide receiver recruit Jaime Ffrench. Jones' recruitment is now open to others beyond the Gators. He is scheduled to announce his college choice at Mandarin on Dec. 6. Ffrench decommitted from Texas on Wednesday. He initially committed to Alabama but pulled back when Nick Saban announced his retirement. Ffrench was courted by Ohio State, LSU and Miami before giving the Longhorns a verbal commitment at a ceremony on Aug. 30. Ffrench is the No. 14 overall prospect and third-ranked wide receiver according to On3. Jones said on a Jacksonville radio show earlier this week that he wasn't flipping from Florida State and explained why he was still supportive of Seminoles coach Mike Norvall. ""Because he showed us our vision. He was there before,"" Jones said. ""He's got to where he talked about. He was 13-0. He's got to where he wanted to go. This is just a little stump in the road for him. I think that the comeback is going to be even greater."" The Seminoles are 1-9 this season, 1-7 in the ACC, after going 13-1 in 2023. Florida State already lost a number of recruits ranked in the top tier of the 2025 class, including Myron Charles, Javion Hilson, Malik Clark, Daylan McCutcheon and CJ Wiley. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Payton Thorne, Freeze's starting senior quarterback, missed practice during the bye week and might not be available Saturday for Auburn (3-6, 1-5 SEC). Thorne injured his shoulder two weeks ago in the Tigers' matchup with Vanderbilt, when the Commodores left Alabama with a 17-7 victory. Freeze's outlook against ULM (5-4, 3-3 Sun Belt) for the Auburn home date had an ominous tone. ""We'll see how this week goes with that and with the others getting reps -- and go from there,"" said Freeze. ""When I say that, it's certainly not an indication that I don't think he's played pretty solid here as of late. You start thinking big picture. That's not always the easiest thing to do, because you love your players. You want what's best for all of them that gives us the best chance to win the remaining three games. We'll start seeing how the health is foremost."" If Thorne cannot go, Freeze indicated redshirt freshman Hank Brown, Holden Geriner or Walker White would be the options. A 24-point favorite over ULM, Auburn would like to produce a strong performance in preparation for its final two games of 2024, both against ranked foes -- home against No. 15 Texas A&M and the annual Iron Bowl against No. 10 Alabama, this year in Tuscaloosa. The Warhawks have experienced the ups and downs of Sun Belt play, winning their first three outings before dropping three straight. ""Always in the state of Louisiana, there's a bunch of athletes, and they've got their share for sure,"" Freeze said. One of those athletes Freeze called out by number after film review is running back Ahmad Hardy. ULM's No. 22 averages 101.67 rushing yards per game with eight touchdowns. Coach Bryant Vincent's run-oriented squad is averaging 172.1 yards on the ground and 300.8 yards per game overall. However, the opposition has churned out nearly 200 yards rushing and 370.3 total. Hosting Texas State last weekend, ULM fell behind 28-0 in the first half and couldn't recover in a 38-17 loss. The Warhawks fumbled six times but lost just one. Vincent said the sloppy play has become a recurring theme. ""These are tough times, and tough times are tough times,"" he said. ""And how you handle the tough times, as tough as they get, determines, really, the real team that you are and the character you are. We're not done.

Texas A&M (2-1) dropped from No. 13 to 23 in the Associated Press poll after a season-opening upset loss at UCF. The Aggies regrouped quickly over their past two games. The Aggies dispatched East Texas A&M and Lamar by 26 or more points heading into their first shot at a ranked opponent. The 21st-ranked Buckeyes (2-0) are preparing to face a second ranked foe in three games to open this season and early returns indicate Ohio State can stick around as a challenger because of its perimeter shooting. Texas A&M beat Ohio State last season 73-66 in Columbus, Ohio. Ohio State beat then-No. 19 Texas 80-72 in Las Vegas on Nov. 4, which vaulted the Buckeyes into the Top 25. Ohio State backed that ranking up by handling Youngstown State 81-47 on Monday. The Buckeyes showed off their balance and depth with five players scoring in double figures in that win, highlighted by Aaron Bradshaw and John Mobley Jr., who each had 16 points. Ohio State shot a staggering 45.5 percent from 3-point range and pressured the perimeter well on the opposite end, limiting Youngstown State to only 23.7 percent shooting from beyond the arc. Two areas where the Buckeyes know they must improve if they are to remain unbeaten are rebounding and turnovers. Ohio State outrebounded the Penguins 41-29 overall, but gave up 13 offensive rebounds. The Buckeyes also committed 15 turnovers in each of their first two games. More miscues could feed right into Texas A&M's defense, which has recorded a combined 18 steals over its past two contests. ""Coach was harping on us limiting our turnovers and we just wanted to keep our edge,"" Bradshaw said after the win over Youngstown State. ""It's just playing in big-time games, we knew the schedule when we were recruited and we're super excited to go into that environment and play in games like this."" A major factor in the Aggies' quick turnaround from the negative result to open the season is the emergence of Zhuric Phelps in his first season at A&M. Phelps has led Texas A&M in scoring in each of its past two wins and finished with 16 points in a 97-71 win over Lamar on Monday night. Phelps' ability to attack the rim complements his talents as a distributor as he had seven assists as well on Monday. He and Wade Taylor IV, who finished with 13 points, could prove to be a dynamic tandem. Their efforts sparked improved shooting performances for the Aggies over their past two games. Texas A&M shot 55.2 percent overall against Lamar and 55.7 percent against East Texas A&M. They also shot 46.2 percent from 3-point range against Lamar. ""What I think will eventually transpire is (Phelps) is going to make the game easier for the other four guys on the floor,"" said Texas A&M coach Buzz Williams, who picked up his 350th career win Monday. ""... I think he has a very high ceiling and he's a very good on-the-ball defender and I think that changes our team as well."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Juan Soto, OF, Yankees Soto set himself up for the biggest payday in MLB history after batting .288 with a .419 on-base percentage and .569 slugging for the Yankees in 2024. Not to mention a career-best 41 home runs, 129 walks, a league-leading 128 runs scored and 109 RBIs. And Soto didn't even turn 26 until October, when he helped lead the Yankees to their first World Series since 2009. Even if he doesn't eclipse $700 million, the value of his contract almost certainly will exceed Shohei Ohtani's heavily deferred deal. Predicted contract/destination: 13 years, $702 million with the New York Mets. In the bidding: Yankees, Giants, Dodgers, Phillies, Rays, Blue Jays, Red Sox 2. Roki Sasaki, RHP, Chiba Lotte Marines (Japan) Surprise! Sasaki would have made more money (like Yoshinobu Yamamoto did a year ago) had Chiba Lotte of NPB waited two more years to post him at age 25. Instead, the Marines obliged his wishes, so Sasaki will come to MLB but be subject to the same international free agent limitations that Ohtani was when he signed with the Angels in the 2017-18 offseason. That puts Sasaki in every team's price range, and there will be a big demand for a 23-year-old who throws 96.9 mph and features a top-shelf split-finger fastball.

McIlroy, of Northern Ireland, carded six birdies against one bogey to finish with a 5-under 67. The 35-year-old sank a 50-foot putt for birdie on the par-3 17th hole to join Englishman Tyrrell Hatton atop the season-ending event at the Jumeirah Golf Estates in Dubai.

With or without Bailey, though, Pikiell knows the Scarlet Knights need to improve defensively.  No. 24 Rutgers will look to conclude a season-opening three-game stretch against local rivals Friday when the Scarlet Knights host Monmouth in Piscataway, N.J. Rutgers (2-0) has been off since Monday, when the Scarlet Knights overcame a five-point halftime deficit to beat visiting Saint Peter's 75-65.  Monmouth (0-3) most recently played Tuesday, losing to host Northern Illinois 79-66. The Scarlet Knights have ranked among the country's top 20 defensive teams in four of the past five years per KenPom.com and limited opponents to 32.7 percent shooting from 3-point range last season. But Saint Peter's mounted its upset bid by shooting 53.3 percent (16 of 30) from the field, including 6 of 12 from beyond the arc, while taking a 42-37 halftime lead.  The 42 points by Saint Peter's were the most in the first half against Rutgers since Feb. 22, when Purdue -- led by national player of the year Zach Edey -- scored 52 points in the first 20 minutes of a 96-68 win.  ""I hugged them all and told them how much I appreciate their lousy defense,"" Pikiell said of his halftime address in the Saint Peter's game. Rutgers limited the Peacocks to 26.7 percent shooting from the field -- 4 of 15 from both inside the arc and beyond the 3-point line -- in the second half. But the Scarlet Knights didn't clamp down until Saint Peter's took a 65-64 lead with 4:07 left. Another touted freshman, Dylan Harper, sank a layup 18 seconds later to begin a game-ending 11-0 run for Rutgers, which forced Saint Peter's to miss its last eight shots from the field.  Harper finished with 24 points and leads the Scarlet Knights with an average of 22 points a game this season. ""We're not going to blow everyone out by 40 -- that's unrealistic,"" said graduate student PJ Hayes, who had five points and seven rebounds in 20 minutes of action. ""For us to be able to power through that, for a team that's young and a little inexperienced, we need that."" Bailey, who joined Harper to give Rutgers its top-rated recruiting class ever, is expected to provide the Scarlet Knights a boost sooner rather than later.  ""He's close,"" Pikiell said. Monmouth (0-3) hopes the same is true for redshirt sophomore forward Jaret Valencia, who averaged 8.9 points and 4.4 rebounds last season but has missed the first three games while recovering from hernia surgery. Without Valencia, a preseason all-second team Coastal Athletic Association pick, the Hawks suffered a season-opening 81-57 loss to Michigan State on Nov. 4 before falling to Temple 103-74 last Friday. Monmouth, which was picked to finish eighth in the 14-team CAA, held a pair of four-point leads Tuesday before Northern Illinois took control with an 18-0 run bridging the halves.  ""Disappointing night for us,"" said coach King Rice, who is in his 14th season with Monmouth. ""We have to get better. We'll get home and get back to work."" Sophomore Abdi Bashir Jr. scored a career-high 25 points Tuesday and leads the Hawks with an average of 18.3 points per game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

And that's just where head coach Todd Golden wants it. The attention around the program over the past week has focused on the news of a Title IX investigation into Golden following allegations of sexual harassment, sexual exploitation and the stalking of multiple women, including students. But, he said, his team has been able to concentrate on the court. ""I think they know who I am, and again, they're mature,"" Golden said. ""They're really good guys and all super-focused."" Golden said the way he approaches his job hasn't changed either. ""Respecting the situation, my family, my team, my coaching staff,"" Golden said. ""We're just continuing to attack it like we normally would every day."" And that has led the Gators to three consecutive wins to kick off the season for the first time since 2020-21. Florida dominated Grambling State 86-62 on Monday, with five players scoring in double figures. Rueben Chinyelu, a Washington State transfer, led with 14 points. Walter Clayton Jr., Will Richard and Sam Alexis each scored 12 while Alex Condon added 10 points and eight rebounds. ""This team is super unselfish and they play for each other,"" Golden told reporters after the win. Florida State is coming off a 72-52 win over Tarleton State despite having no player score in double figures. The leading scorer was Daquan Davis, who scored nine and dished out three assists. ""He has moxie. He is a guy who is extremely confident in himself,"" Seminoles coach Leonard Hamilton told reporters after the game. ""He's in control in what he's doing out there."" Davis ranks third on the team in scoring at 7.3 points per game. Jamir Watkins is the leading scorer for the Seminoles, pouring in 18.3 points per outing. While the Seminoles are unbeaten, they still have work to do, especially as they get set to face their first ranked opponent of the season. ""We had some moments in the game (against Tarleton State) that we obviously showed we are still a team that needs to find ourselves in terms of cohesiveness offensively and defensively,"" Hamilton said. The Gators have won all three of their games by double digits and Clayton has been the team's leading scorer at 16.7 points per outing. Richard (16.0), Condon (15.3) and Alijah Martin (12.3) are averaging in double figures as well for the Gators, who feature a total of seven players averaging at least seven points per game. Florida is shooting 50 percent from the field but just 26 percent from beyond the arc. Florida State has won two of its three games by double digits and is 2-0 at home. The Seminoles are shooting 44 percent from the floor but, like the Gators, they have struggled from beyond the arc, connecting on only 21 percent of their attempts. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Place Stadium in Van,"All eyes are on quarterback Nick Arbuckle when the Toronto Argonauts face the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the 111th Grey Cup at B.C. Place Stadium in Vancouver on Sunday. Arbuckle is unexpectedly under center on the CFL's grandest stage after the league's 2023 Most Outstanding Player Chad Kelly sustained fractures to the fibula and tibia in the Argonauts' 30-28 victory over the Montreal Alouettes in the East Division final. Arbuckle made one start in the regular season, faring well in essentially a meaningless game for Toronto (10-8). The 31-year-old completed 23 of 32 passes for 378 yards with two touchdowns in a 31-30 loss to the Edmonton Elks on Oct. 25.  Arbuckle's situation is a bit too familiar to Argonauts head coach Ryan Dinwiddie, who back in 2007 found himself starting in the Grey Cup for Winnipeg after fellow quarterback Kevin Glenn sustained a broken arm in the East final. Dinwiddie threw three interceptions and the Blue Bombers dropped a 23-19 decision to the Saskatchewan Roughriders in the finale.  ""I trust Nick, I believe in Nick,"" Dinwiddie said. ""We didn't change our game plan when he went in, we were aggressive. Fortunately, Nick's played in big games, unlike myself as that was my first time starting. I just told him I'm going to give him an advantageous opportunity to be successful compared to what our coaches asked us to do in 2007."" Arbuckle can lean on running back Ka'Deem Carey (third in the CFL with 1,060 rushing yards) as Toronto tries to defeat Winnipeg (11-7) for the third time this season. The Argonauts posted a 16-14 win in overtime over the Blue Bombers on July 27 in Toronto and 14-11 on Oct. 11 in Winnipeg. The Blue Bombers also fell to Toronto in the 2022 Grey Cup.  Winnipeg advanced to a fifth consecutive title game, claiming a 38-22 victory over Saskatchewan in the West Division final.  Zach Collaros, the 2021 and 2022 CFL Most Outstanding Player, threw for 301 yards and four touchdowns, with trusted target Kenny Lawler recording 177 receiving yards and three scores. Lawler's return from an eight-game absence after a season-opening injury has fueled Winnipeg, which has won eight in a row.  Collaros wasn't interested in any win streaks or injury news related to Kelly -- or his own team -- for that matter.  ""Those things don't matter,"" he said. ""All that matters to us is our preparation. I know we haven't scored a ton of points against this defense. So we've got our work cut out for us."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Somebody Should Probably Help Giannis Antetokounmpo,https://deadspin.com/somebody-should-probably-help-giannis-antetokounmpo/,2024-11-14T15:04:47.434Z,Giannis Antetokounmpo had to score 59 points for the Milwaukee Bucks to beat the Detroit Pistons in overtime. Somebody needs to help out Giannis.,"It took a heroic effort from Giannis Antetokounmpo to drag the Milwaukee Bucks over the Detroit Pistons in overtime on Wednesday night. Antetokounmpo shouldered much of the load for the Bucks. He scored 59 of the team’s 127 points while adding 14 rebounds and seven assists in the victory. Oh yeah, and he had to play 44 minutes. That’s just not sustainable throughout an 82-game NBA season. Damian Lillard remains in the NBA’s concussion protocol, so he missed this game. Khris Middleton is still rehabbing from his ankle surgeries and is yet to make his season debut. But regardless of that, you’d think the Bucks would be able to glide right past the lowly Pistons.  But that’s no longer the case. Since Doc Rivers took over as the head coach of the Bucks, they’re 22-28. Trouble in paradise does not even begin to describe what is happening to the 2021 NBA Champions. They’re officially reeling.  The Lillard trade was a move that was supposed to signify to the rest of the NBA that Milwaukee was here to stay. Again, that has not been the case. Lillard was supposed to be the Robin to Antetokounmpo’s Batman. While it’s certainly a different role for Lillard, who had usage rates through the roof during his time with the Portland Trailblazers, the fit has not equated to winning basketball games. But this is hardly on Lillard. He’s the least of the problems in Milwaukee right now. Somebody needs to step up and help Antetokounmpo, who has already floated the idea of getting traded if the Bucks don’t win the NBA title this year.  “Yeah, if we don’t win a championship, I might get traded,” Antetokounmpo said before the season. “Yeah, this is the job we live. This is the world we’re living in. It’s everybody.” The thing is, the Bucks would be crazy to trade Antetokounmpo unless he requests it. But would he? There’s no real way to tell. Antetokounmpo says a lot. You can’t really tell when he’s joking or being serious, but in the fickle NBA, players joking about a trade is something that’s rarely taken lightly. While every blog under the sun has already editorialized potential trade suitors for Antetokounmpo, it would be wise for somebody in Milwaukee to stand up and help the man out. He’s 29 years old, and this should be the prime of his career. After nearly dropping 60 points, it’s clear Antetokounmpo has plenty more to give to the game. So before the idea of demanding out really creeps into his head, the Bucks should do everything they can to support him. Antetokounmpo, Lillard and Middleton are the most expensive players on this Bucks roster. It doesn’t help that two of them are injured. But outside of that “big three?” Rivers clearly needs to get more out of Brook Lopez, Bobby Portis and Pat Connaughton, who are the next highest-paid Bucks. If he’s going to continue to give Gary Trent Jr., Andre Jackson Jr., AJ Green and Delon Wright serious minutes, they absolutely need to contribute something on the offensive side of the court. Just two weeks into November, the Eastern Conference is a hot mess. There’s plenty of time for the Bucks to save themselves, as only the Cleveland Cavaliers, Boston Celtics and Orlando Magic are over .500 to start the season.  But the Bucks are currently the 12th seed. That's not good. Bucks GM Jon Horst made the move to fire Adrian Griffin, and now he needs to be working the phones to give Antetokounmpo and Rivers the talent needed to survive the season and make the playoffs. If not, Antetokounmpo’s floated trade scenario could come to fruition this summer. Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Smart's 15th-ranked Golden Eagles have been struggling from downtown to start this season, but they'll have a chance to find their 3-point stroke Friday night when they face Maryland in College Park, Md.  Marquette (3-0) went 10-for-36 from deep in a 70-62 victory over Central Michigan on Monday night and has knocked down only 29.4 percent of its triples through the first three games of the season.  ""Those are shots that our guys make in practice, our guys will make in games,"" Smart said of the 26 missed 3-pointers against the Chippewas. ""I'm sure people will say, ‘Well why do you shoot them if they're not making them?' We believe in those guys.""  What had Smart more concerned is what happened after those misses. Marquette snatched only six offensive rebounds against Central Michigan, something Smart considered an unacceptable figure for a team that so often was off the mark.    ""I think as a team, we have a lot of maturing to do from the standpoint of ... having a willingness to win ugly,"" Smart said. ""But then on the flip side, having an understanding of what goes into stepping on the other team's throat when you have a lead.  ""And we're gonna work on continuing to get better at that, and that's something that every year you gotta build. Competition goes up in our next game.""  That competition has been steamrolling teams, as the Terrapins (3-0) have won each of their first three games by at least 30 points.  Maryland most recently beat Florida A&M 84-53 on Monday behind 21 points and nine rebounds from Julian Reese. Selton Miguel chipped in 14 points, while Ja'Kobi Gillespie finished with 12.  The Terrapins ended with five scorers in double figures, also getting 11 points from Derik Queen and 10 from Rodney Rice, and Reese said his team will be tough to slow down with so many weapons.  ""I feel like it's helping us build trust in each other,"" Reese said. ""I feel like we're a versatile team where anybody can have a good night. Derik had a good first night, Rodney's second night off the bench was electric, and I feel like (Monday) was just my night.  ""Friday is probably gonna be somebody else's night. We just keep doing that, and we're gonna be good and staying on ourselves. We're gonna be great.""  Rice is Maryland's leading scorer at an average of 16.7 points per game, while Gillespie and Queen each average 13.7.  Kam Jones has gotten off to a fast start for the Golden Eagles and is putting up a team-high 22.7 points per game. He was held to 12 on Monday, when Stevie Mitchell led Marquette with 17 points.  Maryland has played the Golden Eagles just once, beating them 84-63 on Dec. 1, 2019.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

No. 13 Purdue (3-0) also has won 20 consecutive home games, the fourth-longest active streak. It will be Alabama's first road game of the season, and coach Nate Oats is interested in grading the test. ""Our upside is high like I think we all knew,"" Oats said. ""We also learned that if we don't play with a competitive edge, we're not all that special. We've got to have a competitive edge."" The Boilermakers look to control the pace of Alabama, which prefers high-octane basketball. Oats said he is OK with mixing tempo and he wasn't happy with his club's offensive movement during Monday's 72-64 home win over McNeese State. ""The good thing is Purdue's gonna slow it down, I guess, knowing what their playing style has been for a long time up there,"" Oats said. ""So we're gonna have to win some games where the other team tries to slow it down. We're just gonna have to be a lot more efficient in the possessions we get."" Grant Nelson paced the Crimson Tide with 22 points and eight rebounds against McNeese. The Boilermakers also played on Monday and delivered a 92-84 home victory over Yale. Braden Smith was an all-around sensation with 22 points, nine rebounds, six assists and five steals. Trey Kaufman-Renn added 17 points and Fletcher Loyer had 14. Loyer made both 3-point attempts and is 9 of 12 from long range this season. Overall, the Boilermakers are shooting 43.7 percent (31 of 71) from 3-point range. Purdue coach Matt Painter says the accurate marksmanship is crucial for his team's balanced approach. ""We have to be able to score the ball from the 3-point line,"" Painter said. ""People will try to take it away. They're trying to keep you from taking those shots too."" Loyer is averaging a team-best 17 points per game and shooting 65.4 percent overall. Kaufman-Renn is shooting 64 percent while averaging 15.3 points. Smith is averaging 15 points, 9.3 assists, 6.3 rebounds and 3.0 steals per game. Fourth-leading scorer Myles Colvin (9.3) said the trio leads the way for the Boilermakers, especially in big games. ""Just using our maturity in staying levelheaded,"" Colvin said of the effect of his teammates. ""The older guys like Braden, Fletcher and Trey have been in situations where they've been down and things weren't going their way and they turned it around."" Star guard Mark Sears is averaging 18 points per game for the Crimson Tide, who are shooting just 30.1 percent (25 of 83) from 3-point range. Latrell Wrightsell Jr. (12.3), Nelson (12.0), Clifford Omoruyi (10.7 points, team-best 8.0 boards per game) and Labaron Philon (10.0) also average in double digits. Purdue defeated Alabama 92-86 last season in Toronto, the hometown of Zach Edey, who repeated as consensus national player of the year last season for the Boilermakers and now plays for the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies. Sears knocked down a career-best eight 3-points and scored 35 points for the Crimson Tide. Edey had 35 points and Smith had 27 for the Boilermakers. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

North Carolina (1-1) will play at home a week after a memorable outing at No. 1 Kansas, where the Tar Heels rallied from 20 points behind before dropping a 92-89 decision. ""I think we only had four turnovers in the second half,"" North Carolina coach Hubert Davis said. ""Then we started attacking the basket, and that allowed us to score the basket, get fouled, get to the free-throw line and then be able to knock down some threes. And so I was really proud of them, how they got back into the game."" While the North Carolina offense clicked, expect much of the team's attention to be on improving defensively. ""Things can change quickly if our will and our want to and our desire and the defensive end raises,"" Davis said. The coach had concerns about foul trouble for North Carolina's interior players, something he'll seek to correct with better defensive sequences. ""I look at the size of your heart,"" Davis said of being able to compete at that end of the court. Confidence could be growing for North Carolina forward Jae'Lyn Withers after a solid second half in the Kansas game. He scored all 11 of his points after halftime, with a trio of 3-pointers boosting his production. ""He can really shoot the ball,"" Davis said. ""And having a big guy that has the ability to knock down perimeter jump shots, especially from 3, it puts a lot of pressure on opposing defenses. And it's a part of our offense that we want to continue to develop throughout the season, of having him pop more and be able to knock down that 3 that gives us more space for our guards.""

""This was a hard-fought win against a tough team that went to the NCAA Tournament last year and returned a good group of their core,"" Duquettte said. ""So I thought it was a good win, a little sloppy at times but we didn't back down, we played aggressive and scored 81 points against a good team. I don't think they are going to give up 81 points very often. We can win in a lot of different ways, so if that's how you want to play, we'll shoot free throws and we'll fight and show you how we can win that way. ... A lot of guys stepped up, so I'm happy about that."" The River Hawks (2-0) step up against Gonzaga (2-0), a team that destroyed then-No. 8 Baylor 101-63 in its opener and then got past Arizona State 88-80 on Sunday. The Bulldogs were powered by big performances against the Sun Devils from a pair of transfers: Khalif Battle (Arkansas) and Michael Ajayi (Pepperdine). Battle scored all 19 of his points in the second half, including a thunderous alley-oop dunk and a dagger of a 3-pointer from the left corner in the final 10 minutes. ""He's quick-twitch and athletic, and one of those guys who can really, really, really go downhill,"" Gonzaga coach Mark Few said of the 6-foot-5 Battle.

""He assumes every ball is his,"" Few said. They weren't the only big contributors Sunday. Braden Huff came off the bench to score a team-high 21 points on 9-of-13 shooting from the field and Ryan Nembhard added 13 points and 11 assists -- with zero turnovers. ""At points in that game we struggled to get stops, but at the end when we needed them, we really locked in and got them,"" Huff said. ""Last year's team it was a bunch of new guys, so it took us awhile to kind of get acclimated and get used to each other in our roles, but I think this year we've got a lot of returners and guys like KB (Battle) and Mike (Ajayi), the new guys have fit it in kind of seamlessly.

The combine hosts more than 300 college football players over multiple days in late February for medical testing and evaluation, physical measurements, timing and strength testing, and on-field workouts at Lucas Oil Stadium as a collective central peg in the scouting process for pro prospects.  CBS Sports reported the extension of the deal on Thursday, which the NFL confirmed in a statement.  ""Indianapolis and the NFL Combine have a proud history together, so we're thrilled to continue our longstanding partnership with Visit Indy, the Indianapolis Colts, and the local community for this 2026 event,"" NFL executive vice president Peter O'Reilly said in a statement to CBS Sports. ""Our partners in Indy have successfully hosted the football evaluation process for decades, and recently, we've collectively worked to grow and evolve the in-person fan experience, bringing tens of thousands of fans closer to the league's future stars."" The 2025 NFL Scouting Combine is scheduled for Feb. 27-March 2. The draft is being held in Green Bay from April 24-26.  Top 40-yard dash times, vertical leaps and position drills attract viewers and create headlines from Indianapolis. But team officials consistently cite medical evaluations -- a fraction ahead of the in-person, 15-minute interviews with prospects typically conducted at team hotels -- as the chief priority at the combine. Indianapolis has the ideal downtown setup with multiple hotels in near proximity to the Colts' home stadium and convention center, which connects via skywalk to a number of locations in the immediate area. Prospects generally fly into Indianapolis one day before the combine following a schedule set up by position group before running the gauntlet of the off-site medical evaluation, cognitive testing, drug testing, height-weight-arm-hand measurements, on-field testing, strength and agility tests, 15- to 20-minute media sessions and position drills. Among the top prospects in the upcoming draft are Colorado cornerback-wide receiver Travis Hunter, a number of quarterbacks -- Hunter's teammate Shadeur Sanders, Miami quarterback Cam Ward, Georgia's Carson Beck and Quinn Ewers of Texas -- and top-end secondary talent. Georgia safety Malaki Starks is the headliner. But the most coveted talent might be the crop of defensive line or edge prospects. Michigan defensive tackle Mason Graham and Georgia's Jalon Walker and Mykel Williams are among blue-chip prospects. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Two of the conference's stars in running back Makhi Hughes of Tulane (8-2, 6-0) and quarterback Blake Horvath of Navy (7-2, 5-1) bring broad appeal to a matchup intensified by Tulane edging the likes of Arizona State and Iowa State to give the AAC two teams in the second set of College Football Playoff rankings revealed Tuesday. As it stands, Tulane (second) and Navy (third) behind No. 24 Army (9-0, 7-0). Navy will face Army in their annual matchup to close the regular season on Dec. 14, but it is designated as a non-conference game and hits after the CFP bracket is announced six days earlier. The Midshipmen call Horvath's number repeatedly, and he has delivered 870 yards rushing and 13 touchdowns with 1,154 yards passing and 11 scores. Count Tulane coach Jon Sumrall among Horvath's fans. ""He's unbelievable. The kid is very athletic, can beat you with his legs, throws it really good. Great anticipation and awareness. I think he's extremely tough,"" Sumrall said. As if Navy's average of 259.1 yards rushing per game (fifth in FBS) isn't impressive enough, a dangerous passing game only heightens the threat, Sumrall said. Eight of Horvath's passing touchdowns have covered at least 31 yards, including two that went for 70-plus. ""How comfortable they are throwing the ball down the field and doing it with consistency is unique,"" Sumrall said. ""A lot of times, three-back-option type teams want to go 3-4 yards a play, grind it out. (Navy doesn't) have a problem doing that, but they have probably more explosive ability throwing the ball down the field than most teams do."" Horvath has been playing through a thumb injury he sustained against Charlotte on Oct. 19 and was held to 50 percent passing with no touchdowns in consecutive losses to Notre Dame (51-14 score) and Rice (24-10). He did have 129 yards rushing and a score against the Fighting Irish. Navy ended the skid with a 28-7 win over South Florida in Tampa last week. Regarding the effect of Horvath's injury on his team's offense, Navy coach Brian Newberry said the plan ""really hasn't changed throughout the course of the year. He's got to be running the football for us. There's times where we may do a little more of that than others, but he's run it very effectively, and so for us to be hitting on all cylinders, he's got to carry the football for us."" On defense, Navy gets to deal with Hughes, who is fourth in the FBS with 1,209 yards rushing. Newberry called Hughes ""as good of a back as there is,"" saying he combines bruising power and elusiveness. ""He's both. He's really athletic, he's big, he's physical, he breaks tackles, he makes the cuts. He's just a total package at running back. Catches it out of the backfield as well,"" Newberry said. The mere threat Hughes poses also sets up Tulane quarterback Darian Mensah, who has thrown for 2,059 yards and 16 touchdowns this season. ""Their team is going to establish that first and foremost, but (then) the play action off of the running game,"" Newberry said. ""The quarterback is a very good player, throws it well, sees the field very well, smart ... is athletic enough to beat you with his feet, so there's lots of challenges with these guys."" Navy cornerback Dashaun Peele has proved to be a weapon as well. The senior has four of the team's 13 interceptions, and he returned two for touchdowns -- covering 61 and 84 yards - in a 51-17 blowout of Charlotte. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Excitable first-year Commanders coach Dan Quinn is making a big deal out of Thursday’s game, saying, “Philadelphia and Washington battling for it? Hell yeah!” And I was half-expecting to hear Nick Sirianni say something back. To be sure, it’s been a wild few years for the Eagles under Nick Sirianni, from coming three points away from a Super Bowl victory over Kansas City to blowing a 10-1 start and falling flat on their faces last winter. Even early in their current winning streak, Eagles fans were unhappy with Sirianni, and the coach jawed back at a few of them after a narrow win over the Cleveland Browns. So it’s almost reassuring to hear a level-headed Jalen Hurts speak on behalf of the team and say the Eagles are focused on nothing more than their preparation and execution. “I’m not satisfied by any means. There’s nothing to be satisfied about in my eyes, because we’re still growing, we’re still a work in progress,” Hurts said. “There’s no moment we’re gonna ‘arrive’ this year. Some may think we have. Some may think we have it figured out, but we don’t. There’s so much more out there for us to accomplish.” With all due respect to Hurts, the Eagles’ big “arrival” moment is right in front of them. If Philly beats the resurgent Washington Commanders on “Thursday Night Football""—and I  believe it will—there's no debating that the NFC East once again runs through the Linc. You can express all the skepticism you want about this franchise after the Eagles lost six of their last seven games (regular season plus playoffs) last year to fail in spectacular fashion. None of the wins on their five-game streak came against playoff contenders. The only impressive showing was a 20-point win over Joe Burrow and the Bengals; stomping the Cowboys last Sunday in the miserable state they’re in doesn’t prove much. But this team isn’t the 2023 team. One thing flying under the radar about these Eagles is their defense. They haven’t allowed more than 280 yards in a game since before their bye week. They rank seventh in defensive DVOA and tied for fifth in scoring defense. It’s as if Nakobe Dean and all those Georgia Bulldogs stars they’ve drafted know how to make big plays. Pair that with a new star running back who’s doing death-defying stunts and a quarterback who’s running more to keep passing lanes open, and what isn’t there to like? Hurts didn’t have his cleanest game against Dallas, but his one interception and one lost fumble were his first turnovers since September, and I can live with occasional mistakes if it means the offense is playing with some verve and not with fear. Look at the sharp difference in his metrics before and after the bye week. Commanders rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels is the hot new thing who just moved in next door, and some fanalysts want to say he’s already better than Hurts.  I think Daniels is incredible, but it’s funny to me that the Eagles’ strength of schedule matters to critics but the Commanders’ strength of schedule doesn’t. Washington has played just three teams currently above .500, going 1-2 against stiffer competition. Are we positive Daniels is going to set off more fireworks against Vic Fangio’s defense? Both these teams, in their own ways, are better than last year. But one has been here before, and the other is merely a nice story. My prediction is simple: Fly, Eagles, Fly.

I chalked it up to football mania when the DJ spun interludes of “Go Pack Go” at the groom’s behest. It felt beyond obsession, though, once the music pivoted to “The Bears Still Suck Polka,” especially with the bride hailing from suburban Chicago. Nowadays, The Happy Schnapps Combo’s biggest hit resonates as both prophetic and precise. A Week 10 home loss to the once-punchless New England Patriots stretched the Bears’ skid to three games after a promising 4-2 start behind seeming franchise savior Caleb Williams. It’s too soon to say Williams is ruined as a franchise QB—although some sky-is-falling sports talkers have—but one can’t deny this: An inept attack and crummy chemistry have the 2024 Bears cooked. You need not be the next Nostradamus to sense that this much-hyped season will get worse. Sunday’s visit from the Packers starts a stretch in which the Bears will face their NFC North foes in six of the next eight weeks, including three straight. Division-leading Detroit (8-1), Minnesota (7-2), and Green Bay (6-3) all figure to bolster those playoff chances with two cracks apiece at Chicago. The Packers carry a 10-game winning streak against the Bears in the NFL’s oldest rivalry, outscoring them by 127 points over that span while racking up a plus-19 turnover differential. “They’ve been doing really well,” Bears tight end Cole Kmet said. “I haven’t won that [rivalry] game yet, but that’s a game that can course-correct a lot of things, I think, especially if you look good.” Kudos to Kmet for his optimism, but the Bears probably won’t pass the eye test at Soldier Field on Sunday, at least when they have the ball. Chicago enters the game on a streak of 23 consecutive possessions without a touchdown, has managed just 27 points in a three-game losing streak, and has allowed 16 sacks of Williams in the past two weeks. The offense averages 277.6 yards per game, third lowest in the league, and is breaking in new offensive coordinator Thomas Brown after coach Matt Eberflus fired predecessor Shane Waldron this week. With Bears fans chanting for Eberflus’ dismissal during the Patriots game—""I""know it’s part of the job,” the 14-29 coach said—the organization made a needed change. Something had to give. It seems Waldron’s giving personality might have paved the way to his ineffectiveness over a nine-game tenure, however. “I would say just probably he was too nice of a guy,” said wide receiver Keenan Allen, one of the organization’s high-profile offseason acquisitions intended to accelerate Williams’ development. “I think during OTAs, training camp, he kind of fell into a trap of letting things go, not holding people accountable. Obviously, those things led to a slippery slope.” Questions about Eberflus’ hold on the locker room mounted even when the current skid merely was one game old. Cornerback Tyrique Stevenson’s trash-talking of Washington Commanders fans moments before his missed assignment helped the defense allow a game-winning Hail Mary as time expired in Week 8 clearly violated much of Eberflus’ famed “HITS” principle. That’s Hustle, Intensity, Takeaways, and (playing) Smart. Eberflus only demoted Stevenson temporarily at Arizona the following week. He didn’t start the game but played most of it after teammate Terrell Smith suffered an ankle injury. Chicago fans know an anagram for “HITS” all too well lately. Indeed, the Bears still—take it away, Happy Schnappsters. Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Denver (5-5) hasn't had a playoff appearance since losing Super Bowl 50 in the 2015 season, while Atlanta (6-4) looks to qualify for postseason play for the first time since its 2017 campaign. A win for either squad could go a long way toward ending its span of futility. The Falcons enter play atop the NFC South, holding a two-game lead on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and a three-game advantage on both the New Orleans Saints and Carolina Panthers. It's the only division in the NFC in which just one team has a winning record. Atlanta had a chance to stretch its lead last Sunday but dropped a 20-17 decision to a New Orleans Saints' team that had lost seven straight games. The usually reliable Younghoe Koo missed three field goals in the loss for Atlanta, which squandered an opportunity to take a stranglehold on the division. The Falcons' offense failed to reach the 20-point mark for the fourth time this year and Atlanta fell to 0-4 in such games.  Kirk Cousins' 306 passing yards raised his season total 2,634, third in the NFL. The 36-year-old veteran knows that the disappointing loss will have to be put behind the team before Sunday's matchup against one of the NFL's best defenses. Denver's defensive unit is allowing just 17.7 points per game, which ranks fourth in the league. ""You've got to get the bad taste out of your mouth after Sunday's game. It sits with you,"" Cousins said. ""But we understand the work it takes to get ready for Denver, the defense that they are, the challenges they present, and just the importance of the game. ... Statistically what they've done this year speaks for itself. It's a good challenge for us."" Ready to challenge the Denver defense are running back Bijan Robinson (748 rushing yards) and receivers Darnell Mooney (684 yards) and Drake London (649). Cousins was limited in Thursday's practice due to right shoulder and elbow injuries. As impressive as Denver's defense has been, the Broncos' offense has hit a wall the past two weeks. After mustering just 10 points at Baltimore, the Broncos managed just 260 total yards in last week's 16-14 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. Still, the Broncos had a chance to give Kansas City its first loss before Will Lutz's 35-yard field goal attempt was blocked as time expired. The Broncos hold the final wild-card spot in the AFC, one game ahead of the Indianapolis Colts and Cincinnati Bengals. For head coach Sean Payton, his team knows that everything still is in front of them. ""This team has been resilient. The sky isn't falling,"" Payton said. ""We're sitting here 5-5 and we would've loved to be 6-4 with a win (Sunday), but the focus shifts quickly to the next game. I like the leadership on this team. It's entirely different than it was a year ago. It's tough mentally and physically, and we've got a good week of practice coming up before Atlanta."" Rookie quarterback Bo Nix threw for 215 yards and two touchdowns last time out, upping his season total to 1,968 passing yards -- second-most by a first-year player (Washington's Jayden Daniels, 2,147).  ""We're close. We've just got to find ways to make plays and to get over the hump,"" Nix said. ""In this league, that's the line between playoff teams, championship teams. All of the guys are going to continue to fight."" Atlanta cornerbacks Dee Alford (hamstring) and Antonio Hamilton (pectoral), defensive linemen James-Smith Williams (tibia) and Ta'Quon Graham (pectoral), and tight end Charlie Woerner (concussion) did not participate in Wednesday's practice. For Denver, wide receiver Josh Reynolds was designated to return from the injured reserve after sustaining a finger injury in Week 5. Reynolds had 12 catches for 183 yards and a touchdown prior to the injury. Defensive end Zach Allen (elbow, rest) and safety Brandon Jones (abdomen) were both limited in Wednesday's practice.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Flexed into the late Sunday window, the Chargers (6-3) are on a three-game winning streak behind Justin Herbert and are pointed toward the playoffs just past the midway point of the schedule.  The Bengals (4-6) still have work to do to move into playoff eligibility behind Joe Burrow, but they are just one game out of the final AFC postseason spot despite a sub-.500 record.  Perhaps more than a clash of quarterbacks selected in the first round of the 2020 draft, Sunday's meeting is about the Bengals' elite offense against the Chargers' much-improved defense that still is trying to prove it is as good as the numbers suggest.  The Bengals average 27 points per game, fifth in the NFL. The Chargers have allowed an NFL-best 13.1 points per game, but a relatively easy schedule has created skeptics. Their current winning streak has come against the New Orleans Saints, Cleveland Browns and Tennessee Titans, whom they got past 27-17 last Sunday.  The Chargers finally have been able to develop an identity, something new head coach Jim Harbaugh said he was searching for into the first month of the season.  ""I know what our guys are now,"" Harbaugh said this week. ""... They're going to play as hard as they can, as fast as they can, as long as they can. Big challenge (on Sunday). I know our guys are not afraid of any challenge, any new challenge, and they're going to attack it.""  Herbert had just 164 yards passing and a touchdown in Sunday's victory, while the Chargers' defense recorded seven sacks, even as star outside linebacker Khalil Mack (groin) was limited to four plays. Bud Dupree and Tuli Tuipulotu each had two sacks.  The Chargers' 31 total sacks are tied for fourth in the NFL heading into Week 11.  Mack did not practice Wednesday, while outside linebacker Joey Bosa (hip), running back Gus Edwards (ankle), cornerback Kristian Fulton (hamstring) and linebacker Daiyan Henley (illness) were limited.  The Bengals enter with the fourth-best passing offense in the NFL at an average of 254.8 yards per game. Burrow's 2,672 passing yards lead the NFL, while his 24 TD passes are tied for the top spot.  Still, his four TD passes in Week 10 were not enough as the Baltimore Ravens pulled out a 35-34 victory in another prime-time game on Nov. 7.  The mini-bye game gave Cincinnati ample time to prepare for another member of the Harbaugh family. After the loss to brother John Harbaugh's Ravens, it's now time for Jim Harbaugh's Chargers.  ""They're going to run the ball well, get into manageable third downs, they're not going turn it over, keep everything in front on defense and try to shorten the game,"" Burrow said of the Chargers while referencing a similarity to the Ravens. ""We have to find ways to take our opportunities down the field.""  Ja'Marr Chase had 11 receptions for 264 yards against the Ravens, including three touchdowns. His final TD catch came with 38 seconds remaining to bring Cincinnati within one, but a two-point conversion failed.  ""We're just trying to find wins at this point,"" Burrow said. ""You'd like one to turn into two to turn into three. But the only way you can do that is to focus on the day to day.""  Burrow was a full participant in practice Wednesday but was listed with right wrist and left biceps injuries. Wide receiver Tee Higgins (quad) was limited. Linebacker Joe Bachie (hip), offensive tackle Orlando Brown Jr. (knee/fibula), defensive tackle B.J. Hill (knee), and wide receiver Charlie Jones (groin) did not practice.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

After benching Richardson for veteran Joe Flacco the past two weeks without the desired effect in the win column, Steichen is going back to Richardson for Sunday's trip to East Rutherford, N.J., to battle the New York Jets. Steichen sat Richardson down after a 23-20 loss to the Houston Texans on Oct. 27. Richardson not only struggled with accuracy in that game (10-of-32 passing), but he also took himself out before a key third-down play in the second half, acknowledging he was tired. Flacco threw a combined four interceptions in losses to Minnesota and Buffalo, including a pick-six in last week's 30-20 setback to the Bills on Indianapolis' first play of the game. Steichen said Richardson has taken steps in the right direction while serving as QB2. ""He's made strides in that area, big-time strides, becoming a pro's pro,"" Steichen said. ""Is he a finished product? No, he's not, and it's my job to help him get there. He's going to start this week; he's going to start the rest of the season."" Richardson has completed only 44.4 percent of his 133 passes for 958 yards with four touchdowns and seven interceptions. He's rushed for 242 yards, second on the team, but has fumbled six times in six games. For his part, Richardson said his brief stint on the bench opened his mind. ""I'm thankful for these past two weeks,"" he said. ""As a competitor, you never want to just be on the sideline. You always feel like there's an opportunity for you to go out there and help the team. But sitting on the sideline just allowed me to look and see certain things I can correct about myself."" If Richardson can make those corrections, the Colts (4-6) still have time to catch Houston, which owns a two-game lead over them in the AFC South. Houston swept the season series between the teams. While Richardson returns, Aaron Rodgers continues as the New York quarterback in what's shaping up to be a lost year for a franchise that specializes in lost years. Rodgers mirrored his team's struggles in last week's 31-6 loss at Arizona, managing only 151 yards on 22-of-35 passing but losing 23 yards while taking three sacks. Nevertheless, Rodgers is holding on to hope that the Jets (3-7) can make a run to a playoff spot. ""You know we're not mathematically eliminated,"" he said. ""There's a lot to play for. At the end of the day, one thing we can play for, whether we're 10-0 or 3-7, is pride."" Realistically, New York has played about every card it can to turn things around. It fired coach Robert Saleh after dropping to 2-3 with a Week 5 loss vs. Minnesota but is just 1-4 since installing Jeff Ulbrich as the interim coach. And the acquisition of Davante Adams, Rodgers' favorite target during his days in Green Bay, hasn't helped, either. Even the reliable defense had trouble in Arizona. The Jets gave up 406 total yards and 28 first downs. ""A criminal, egregious amount of missed tackles,"" Ulbrich said. Indianapolis owns a 44-32 lead in the all-time series, including the postseason.

Despite losing two straight contests, the Islanders will look to extend their point streak to five games on Thursday night when they continue a five-game trip by visiting the Vancouver Canucks.  Both teams were off Wednesday after playing the previous night, when the Islanders fell to the Edmonton Oilers 4-3 in overtime and the Canucks recorded a 3-1 win over the visiting Calgary Flames. The Islanders had little chance Tuesday in overtime, when they were outshot 4-0. Bo Horvat, Simon Holmstrom and defenseman Ryan Pulock were on the ice for more than a minute before Leon Draisaitl entered in a shift change, swooped into the New York zone and scored at 1:52 of overtime. ""There's nights where, going home, you're (ticked) off,"" Islanders coach Patrick Roy said. ""There's nights you're going home and you say ‘OK, we stole a point.' Tonight that was the case. By the end I think we were just gassed."" But captain Anders Lee's two goals in the third ensured New York would extend its point streak to four games (2-0-2). The Islanders enter Thursday's game with an NHL-high four ""loser points"" after collecting a league-leading 16 such points last season, when they lost to Carolina in the first round of the playoffs. The 16 losses in overtime or the shootout were the most for a playoff team since the Florida Panthers won the Southeast Division with a 38-26-18 record in 2011-12. ""We pick up points while we're missing a lot of guys,"" Roy said of the Islanders, who have first-liners Mathew Barzal and Anthony Duclair and defenseman Adam Pelech on injured reserve. ""We should gain confidence because we're playing good hockey."" The Canucks also have enjoyed a confidence-boosting stretch following a rough start. Vancouver is 8-2-1 since an 0-1-2 start in which it was outscored 13-8.  The Canucks continued to thrive while playing from behind Tuesday, when they outshot the Flames 12-9 in the first but ended the period trailing 1-0. Justin Kirkland put back the rebound of a shot by Kevin Rooney that glanced off the stick of Vancouver defenseman Quinn Hughes. Elias Pettersson and Pius Suter scored in the first three minutes of the second, when Vancouver outshot Calgary 14-7. ""Really took over in the second period,"" said Canucks center J.T. Miller, who assisted on both goals in the second period. ""I thought we just did a good job of executing the game plan and put it down their throat."" Vancouver has given up the first goal in eight straight games, a span in which the team is 5-2-1. The Canucks have mounted comebacks in five of their eight wins this season. ""Sometimes it happens,"" Miller said. ""It's 60 minutes, and you'd like to start with the lead, but I thought we had a lot of chances right before their goal. And obviously that's a fluky one, so we're not going to worry about it."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

LSU and Kansas State will face each other for the third time ever -- and the third time in the past three seasons -- as LSU travels to Manhattan, Kan., for a Thursday night matchup. Kansas State has won the previous two games.  The two teams met in the championship game of the Cayman Islands Classic in the fall of 2022, with LSU pulling off a thrilling 61-59 victory on a baseline jumper with less than five seconds left.  Last season, the Wildcats defeated the Tigers 75-60 in Baton Rouge, La., behind Louisiana native Cam Carter, one of four Wildcats to score in double figures. Carter now plays for LSU.  LSU (2-0) has started the 2024-25 season strong, partly behind Carter, who has 21 points in each of the Tigers' first two games. In their most recent game, the Tigers used a 19-4 run over a 5:22 stretch in the second half Sunday to erase a six-point halftime deficit and beat Alabama State 74-61.  ""I was really pleased with the final 12 minutes on Sunday,"" LSU Coach Matt McMahon said Tuesday. ""A lot of lessons learned throughout the game, but I really liked the way we finished the game, both offensively and defensively. Now we have this great opportunity to go on the road Thursday against Kansas State.""  Kansas State (2-0) has cruised to two straight wins. In the Wildcats' most recent game, transfer Brendan Hausen was 6-of-9 from 3-point range on his way to a career high 22 points in a 77-64 victory Saturday over Cleveland State.  ""We've got some guys who can make shots,"" Kansas State coach Jerome Tang said. ""Even when we're not playing particularly well, that's what it boils down to.

Gourde added an assist Tuesday, and the trio has a plus-5 rating over the past two games. ""It's obviously not the start we wanted,"" Tanev said after the Kraken were outshot 18-6 by Columbus in the first period. ""But I think we found a way to make some plays, and good things will happen when you're playing the right way."" Tanev's goal, which tied the score at 2-2, came on a two-on-one rush with Gourde. Tanev skated the puck down the right wing, cut laterally through the slot and scored on a wrist shot. ""My goal doesn't happen without Yanni driving the net and clearing space for me,"" Tanev said. ""So there are a lot of good things, simple things that make the game easier for others and especially our teammates. When we're playing that way, the game becomes easier for us."" Ten seconds later, Eeli Tolvanen scored a power-play goal to put the Kraken ahead for good. Kraken coach Dan Bylsma called a timeout after the Blue Jackets tallied twice in a 22-second span in the first period, and Columbus didn't score again. ""I think the attention to our game plan and the attention to the way we wanted to play wasn't nearly good enough,"" Bylsma said. ""The message after the first was, '‘Get your heads up and play.'"" Added Tanev: ""It was simple -- (the first period) wasn't good enough. It was some lazy, sloppy hockey. But I think at the end of the day, we had 40 minutes to figure it out, and I think we definitely did that."" The Blackhawks are coming off a 2-1 overtime victory Sunday against visiting Minnesota, snapping a 12-game losing streak against their division rivals dating to 2020. Philipp Kurashev scored the winner at 1:50 of overtime and Petr Mrazek made 32 saves. ""Yeah, I think it has been tough for us all year to play a full 60 minutes. So we have to find a way to, even if the game is tied, stay in it and not let teams back in it,"" Kurashev said. ""We got away with it (Sunday), but we've got to learn from it."" Jason Dickinson also scored for the Blackhawks, who snapped a two-game skid. ""(Mrazek) was really dialed in and definitely the best player on both teams (Sunday), for sure,"" Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson said. ""I thought we played a really solid game, but he was there all game when we needed him. The third period, they kind of turned it on and we stopped making plays, and they had the puck too much and Petr was excellent and kept us in there right to the end."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Nashville's trip started with a 3-2 overtime loss Monday to the Colorado Avalanche. While getting a point and earning three in their last two games (1-0-1), the Predators still sit at the bottom of the Central Division, a far cry from the start the team envisioned after making some high-profile additions to the roster over the summer for coach Andrew Brunette. Despite having just five wins and 12 points through the first 16 games (5-9-2), there is not a lot of panic in the Predators' locker room. During an interview Wednesday morning on the Nashville-based ""Chase and Big Joe Show"" program on 102.5 The Game. Predators center Colton Sissons said it's challenging to play with the speed Brunette wants from his players. ""It took us some time last year, obviously, to understand that and get acclimated to it, but I think it is coming along,"" said Sissons, who scored his second goal of the season in Monday's loss.  ""I mean, it wasn't just the new guys. A lot of us haven't done it to the level that we needed to do it at, obviously, thus far, but it definitely is coming along, especially in the last two games. ""I think there's some chemistry building in some of the lines here, which is good to see and, hopefully, we continue to build that up."" Edmonton has won two straight, including a 4-3 overtime victory Tuesday over the visiting New York Islanders. The Oilers squandered a late 3-1 lead, but the team's top performers secured the second point in the extra session. Leon Draisaitl scored twice, putting him in a three-way tie with an NHL-best 12 goals this season. Defenseman Evan Bouchard added a goal and two assists, and superstar captain Connor McDavid scored once and assisted on the other three goals. The four-point performance from the three-time Hart Memorial Trophy winner puts him at 999 points for his career in 658 games. With his next goal or assist, he'll become the 99th player in NHL history to rack up 1,000 points. Unless McDavid, 27, fails to score a point in any of the next 22 games, he'll become the fourth-fastest player to reach that milestone. ""Every player can have an outstanding game,"" Oiler coach Kris Knoblauch told reporters Wednesday. ""Some players do it once, some a handful of times. But if you're going to be elite and one of the best, you've got to be bringing it almost every single night. And he does that. So, you don't rise up the all-time points leader (category) in that many games unless you're bringing it most nights, and he certainly is."" The Oilers may be down a regular on Thursday after Viktor Arvidsson did not practice. Knoblauch called it a ""maintenance day"" for the 31-year-old Swede, adding that how the left winger feels on Thursday will dictate whether he plays. Thursday may also mark the NHL debut of Nashville defenseman Adam Wilsby, 24, who was called up from the team's American Hockey League affiliate in Milwaukee on Wednesday. The Predators selected Wilsby in the fourth round of the 2020 NHL Draft. He's scored 42 points in parts of three seasons with Milwaukee after playing professionally in his native Sweden. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

That will start to change Thursday night as the Wild return home to host the Montreal Canadiens in St. Paul, Minn. It will be the first home game in nine days for Minnesota, which has played 10 of its first 15 games on the road. In those 15 games, the Wild have recorded at least one point in all but two contests (10-2-3). They are riding a three-game point streak (2-0-1) as they face Montreal. ""We want to play good at home,"" Wild center Joel Eriksson Ek said. ""We want to make something out of this (hot start) and keep this going that way. So, for sure it's going to be important to try to keep the momentum going at home, too."" The Canadiens have had a much bumpier start to the season. They are 1-5-1 in their last seven contests, but they snapped a six-game winless skid with a 7-5 victory against the Buffalo Sabres in their most recent matchup Monday night. Captain Nick Suzuki scored two goals and dished two assists in the victory. Cole Caufield also scored two goals, and former top overall draft pick Juraj Slafkovsky finished with three assists. The performance gave Suzuki 17 points (six goals, 11 assists) in 16 games. ""(Suzuki) needed a game like (Monday night),"" Canadiens coach Martin St. Louis said. ""I'm happy he got that game. As a player, you need those games. ""I think, like everybody, he feels the heat a little bit and to get that game and breathe a little bit, ... this team needed this outcome (Monday), and I think ‘Suzy' needed that, too."" Minnesota is led in scoring by Kirill Kaprizov, who has 28 points (nine goals, 19 assists) in 15 games. He has scored seven times on even strength and two times on the power play. Matt Boldy ranks second with 16 points (nine goals, seven assists) in 15 games. Mats Zuccarello is third on the scoring list with 14 points (six goals, eight assists) in 15 contests. A big key to the Wild's early-season success started in the defensive zone, veteran Marcus Foligno said. The more that Minnesota moved the puck out of its zone and went on the attack, the more it alleviated pressure on its goaltender. ""When we break the puck out fast and then we're making tape-to-tape passes and smart plays, it's like, ‘OK, we've got our game,'"" Foligno said. ""The confidence goes right through the roof. What I want to see at home is when things do go south and we are on our heels a little bit, that we can correct it quickly."" Filip Gustavsson is expected to make his 12th start in net for the Wild. He is 7-2-2 with a 2.27 goals-against average and a .919 save percentage this season. In four career games against the Canadiens, Gustavsson is 1-2-1 with a 3.64 GAA and an .884 save percentage. Sam Montembeault is set to start in goal for Montreal. The 28-year-old is 4-7-1 with a 3.42 GAA and an .890 save percentage in 12 games this season. Montembeault has faced the Wild three times in his career. He is 1-1-1 in those matchups with a 3.60 GAA and an .872 save percentage. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Grant-Foster, the Antelopes' graduate guard who previously played for Kansas and DePaul, has undergone two heart surgeries in recent years. He is cleared to play against the Sun Devils after reaching desirable strength and stamina. Grant-Foster sat out Grand Canyon's opening two regular-season games. Last season, Grant-Foster averaged 20.1 points and 6.1 rebounds per game. ""We're a much better team with Tyon,"" Grand Canyon coach Bryce Drew said. ""The biggest thing is going to be everybody getting used to playing together and the rhythm. The last couple weeks, we haven't got to practice with him as much because we were so focused on our first two games. We've tried to speed things up this week, so hopefully it'll click right away."" Grand Canyon (2-0) defeated Cal State Fullerton 89-79 and Western Kentucky 74-72, both at home, to kick off the campaign. Lopes junior Duke Brennan, a post player who began his career at Arizona State, also missed the first two contests with a left arm injury. His status was undetermined for the Thursday game. Grand Canyon defeated Western Kentucky by scoring eight unanswered points to close the game. Ray Harrison was 1-for-10 from the field before making the game-winning shot on a drive to the basket with 0.4 seconds remaining. Collin Moore (23 points and 10 rebounds) and JaKobe Coles (16 points and 11 rebounds) each had a double-double to lead the Lopes. Arizona State (2-1) is coming off an 88-80 loss Sunday at then-No. 6 Gonzaga, a game in which the Sun Devils were tied with five minutes remaining. The Bulldogs pulled away at the end. Basheer Jihad had 22 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Sun Devils, who shot 53.1 percent from the field in the second half and 47.6 percent for the game. Two days before the defeat, coach Bobby Hurley's Sun Devils beat Santa Clara 81-74 in Henderson, Nev. ""That's the beauty of how we performed this weekend is that both of the teams we played brought a lot of guys back, and we were able to overcome that and certainly be very competitive,"" Hurley said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

On the heels of a 120-112 loss to the visiting Phoenix Suns on Tuesday, the Jazz own an 0-5 record at the Delta Center. That's the worst start on their own court since the franchise moved to Utah in 1979 and matches the all-time worst beginning since the team's first season in New Orleans in 1974. Jazz coach Will Hardy continues to try to remain optimistic during a youth-oriented rebuilding season. Utah has limped out to a 2-8 record, but the team has gone a modest 2-2 since dropping the first six games of the season. After trailing by double digits for most of the night, the Jazz trimmed Phoenix's lead to six when rookie Kyle Filipowski scored on a dunk with 10:18 remaining. ""I think overall there was more good than bad,"" Hardy said. ""The game was decided in the first quarter. They came out with an energy and physicality that we didn't. It just put us behind the curve. Our team stuck with it and continued to fight and compete."" John Collins led Utah with 29 points and 10 rebounds, while Filipowski scored 18 and Lauri Markkanen netted 17. Jordan Clarkson contributed 16 points and eight assists. The Mavericks are coming off of a rough 120-117 loss to the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday in San Francisco. Klay Thompson scored 22 in his celebrated return to his former team's arena, but he was overshadowed by former teammate Stephen Curry and his 37-point outburst. Mavericks star Luka Doncic had a big night in the loss, compiling 31 points, eight rebounds and six assists. He is listed as probable to play Thursday despite a right knee contusion, while teammate P.J. Washington (sprained right knee) was listed as doubtful. Thompson was emotional after returning to San Francisco and seeing his old team and fans. The Warriors gave captain hats to fans in his honor because of his love for boating and as a tribute to how he'd take his boat across the bay to games at the Chase Center. Thompson put Dallas up 110-105 on a 3-pointer with 5:17 left in the fourth quarter, but Curry then scored the final 12 points for the Warriors to spoil his Splash Brother's homecoming. The Mavericks come into Utah on a three-game losing streak, having dropped three nail-biters by a total of six points. Before the defeat to the Warriors, Dallas fell 114-113 at home vs. the Phoenix Suns and then 122-120 at Denver. ""Tonight, this one really stung being up seven with under four minutes left. We'll watch the film and get better,"" Thompson said of the Tuesday setback. ""But I'm really proud of how this team keeps fighting. ""We're still getting to know each other. I keep telling guys it's better to go through this stuff early in the season versus Game 60. I know we have a chance to be great. We have just got to stay the course."" The Mavericks won their first meeting with the Jazz this season, a 110-102 decision on Oct. 28 in Dallas. Kyrie Irving had 23 points, Thompson scored 18 and Doncic totaled 15 points, nine rebounds and eight assists for the hosts. Collin Sexton paced Utah with 23 points. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Now that the NFL's reigning Offensive Player of the Year is back, it's full-speed ahead for the 49ers. With McCaffrey debuting last week after missing the first eight games due to Achilles tendinitis, the 49ers (5-4) won 23-20 at Tampa Bay, posting consecutive victories for the first time this season. They'll look to continue streaking when they play host to the struggling Seattle Seahawks (4-5) on Sunday in Santa Clara, Calif. ""I'm just happy I'm here,"" McCaffery said. ""That was a long journey and a lot of long days, so it feels good to win and it feels good to just play in a football game again."" McCaffrey's contributions were somewhat limited by his unparalleled standards. He rushed for 39 yards on 13 carries and caught six passes for 68 yards. Brock Purdy, who threw for 353 yards and two touchdowns, was happiest to have McCaffrey back in the backfield. ""I think he was awesome,"" Purdy said. ""We had multiple plays with him out of the backfield that were some big plays throwing the ball."" McCaffrey said he tried to stay ""even-keeled"" in his season debut. ""Obviously there's a lot of emotion when you play an NFL football game. So, I just try to let those come naturally,"" McCaffrey said. ""When you miss time due to something like that, nobody wants to be on the field more than me. Just to be out there again, to be honest with you, you really realize how much of a privilege it is to play football."" McCaffrey was listed as limited on the injury report Wednesday, but 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said he'll give the running back regular maintenance days as he works back into the grinding weekly routine. Defensive lineman Nick Bosa (hip) and tight end George Kittle (hamstring) both missed practice time, though Shanahan didn't sound too worried. There is some consternation over the status of punter Mitch Wishnowsky, who aggravated a back injury against the Buccaneers.  Kittle had five catches for 68 yards and two touchdowns as the 49ers won 36-24 at Seattle in Week 6. Last time Seattle saw the 49ers, it was two less-familiar runners ripping apart the Seattle defense.  The Seahawks are coming off a bye and have lost five of six games since a 3-0 start. In the 12-point defeat by San Francisco on Oct. 10, the Seahawks allowed a season-worst 228 rushing yards and 6.9 yards per carry to a 49ers' attack powered by Jordan Mason and Isaac Guerendo. McCaffrey rushed for 259 yards and two touchdowns and caught six passes for 33 yards in two games against the Seahawks in 2023. Seattle's defense ranks 23rd in the NFL in yards allowed (357.6 per game) and 27th against the run (139.4). ""We've got guys that fought, but we have to go to work and make this right because right now we're doing too many things that, it's not winning football, it's not complementary,"" said first-year Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald, who coordinated Baltimore's league-leading defense last season. ""And just the same mentality we've had every week, we've got to keep that going, and we're going to find the solution at some point."" The Seahawks made a surprise move this week by releasing starting linebacker Tyrel Dodson, who led the team in tackles with 71. Seattle wide receiver DK Metcalf was a full participant in practice to start the week, pointing to his probable return after missing the past two games with a knee injury.  Right tackle Abe Lucas (knee) was limited but might make his season debut. Missing practice time were defensive lineman Leonard Williams (foot) and tight ends Noah Fant (groin) and Brady Russell (foot). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The Bills (8-2) appear to be the greatest impediment standing in the way of the back-to-back Super Bowl champion Chiefs becoming the first NFL team to go undefeated in the regular season since the New England Patriots in 2007. History and hyperbole are plentiful as the Chiefs (9-0) land in Buffalo for what is being framed as the marquee game of Week 11 and potentially the 2024 regular season. Based on recent matchups between these rivals, the final minutes are likely to be worth the wait yet again in this storybook series. The Chiefs have come from behind eight times this season, while the Bills have won three teams when trailing at the half. It's just the fifth time since 1970 that NFL teams with eight or more wins meet in Week 11 or sooner. The home team won each of the previous four matchups. Kansas City is attempting to become the first team to go undefeated in a 17-game regular season. It's tough to discern where the momentum stands even with the Chiefs entering the game undefeated. They needed a last-second blocked field goal to knock off the Denver Broncos last week, sparking Mahomes to send a warning to his teammates. ""I mean, you're playing the best. The best of the best. That's what you want in this league,"" he said of facing Josh Allen and the Bills. ""I've been able to go up against Josh a multitude of times, and every single game it seems like it comes down to the very end. He is a guy that competes and has that fire. I think you can see that fire that he plays with and that kind of goes through his entire team."" Buffalo, which has won five consecutive wins overall, has claimed the past three regular-season games in the series, all of which were played in Kansas City. And the Bills can still tap into a revenge factor. The eventual repeat Super Bowl champion Chiefs eliminated the Bills in the AFC divisional playoffs 27-24 at Buffalo in January. Despite owning good individual stats against Kansas City, Allen is focusing on the bottom line. ""I know we haven't beat them in the playoffs,"" he said on Wednesday, ""so that's the only thing that really matters."" The matchup features two of the most successful quarterbacks in the NFL: two-time MVP Mahomes and the decorated but overshadowed Allen. Their offenses have been getting the job done in different ways. Although Mahomes has just three more touchdowns (12) than interceptions, Kansas City hangs onto the ball thanks to a league-leading third-down conversion rate (52 percent). The Bills are tied for third in points per game (29) -- the Chiefs average 24.3 -- and Allen didn't throw two picks in a game until a win over the Indianapolis Colts last week. Buffalo leads the NFL in turnover margin at plus-13. And the Bills bring a respectable defense of their own. The group is allowing just 19.3 points per game and has 19 takeaways, the latter figure ranking second in the league. Red-zone defense figures to be paramount against a Chiefs offense that keys off Mahomes' dynamic decision-making and threat to run or unleash brazen throws. Buffalo allows touchdowns on just 47.2 percent of red-zone incursions (eighth in the NFL), while the Chiefs have scored on 53.6 percent of the time (13th). The Kansas City defense, meanwhile, allows just 17.9 points per game (tied for fifth best) and is fourth in yards allowed (289.9). ""I think they do a great job switching the looks that they're giving,"" Allen said. ""Obviously, we know Chris Jones is a game-wrecker, one of the best if not the best interior D linemen in the game right now. You pair that up with some of their DBs and linebackers and they're flying all over the field. ... We're going to have our hands full."" Allen is tied for fourth in the NFL with 17 touchdown passes. All four of his interceptions this season have come in the past three games. ""He's doing a great job with the ball,"" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. ""He's using everybody and he's not forcing anything in there, obviously, so I think he's doing great with his decision-making."" However, Allen's decimated receiving corps will present another difficult scenario against Kansas City. Rookie wide receiver Keon Coleman is out with a wrist injury, wide receiver Amari Cooper (wrist) was a limited participant in practice on Wednesday and tight end Dalton Kincaid (knee) is questionable after sitting out Wednesday. Right tackle Spencer Brown (ankle) also did not practice on Wednesday. The Chiefs reported no significant injuries on Wednesday and actually had encouraging news with defensive end Charles Omenihu (knee) and running back Isiah Pacheco (ankle) returning to practice. Reid said that wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster (hamstring) was closer to returning, whereas Pacheco and Omenihu weren't viewed as candidates to play Sunday. ""We'll see as we go through practice, but if it's up to him, he's back,"" Reid said of Smith-Schuster. After Sunday, the Chiefs finish the regular season with the Panthers, Raiders, Chargers, Browns, Texans, Steelers and Broncos. Those teams have averaged four wins so far this season. Only the Chargers, Texans and Steelers currently have a winning record. Kansas City beat the Chargers 17-10 in Los Angeles on Sept. 29. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The Buffaloes couldn't pull away before halftime, as the Titans fought back to a four-point deficit. Keith Richard drove for a layup at the 2:12 mark, making the score 33-29. Colorado took a six-point lead into halftime. Jakimovski scored 14 of his points in 11 minutes of playing time in the first half. He knocked down three 3-pointers within the first four minutes of the game, and had four treys for the half. He hit his fifth 3-pointer early in the second half for a 40-29 Colorado lead, and the Buffaloes took off from there. The Titans got within 55-43 on a Freddie Cooper layup with 8:46 to play, but the Buffaloes scored the next nine points to surge ahead comfortably. Later, Hammond collected a rebound at one end and drove for a layup at the other end of the court, and was fouled on the shot.

As luck would have it, the Steelers open division play with a showdown for first place when they host the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday. Pittsburgh certainly has confidence with seven wins in the past eight meetings with Baltimore. The Ravens (7-3) are 2-1 against AFC North opponents and looking to unseat first-place Pittsburgh (7-2). Steelers coach Mike Tomlin isn't the least bit concerned about a schedule that calls for the Steelers to play four straight division opponents and six of eight against the AFC North to end the regular season. ""I don't care,"" Tomlin said on Wednesday. ""I'll play them whenever they schedule us. We've got no control over the schedule. Our goal is to beat everybody, but specifically week to week, we get singly focused on this week's opponent, and so I'd be making it up if I told you I cared about the schedule of when we face people. I don't."" After the tussle with the Ravens, Pittsburgh goes on the road to play the Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals before hosting the Browns. The Steelers have thrived no matter the opponent in recent weeks, winning four straight games and averaging 30.8 points during the span. Russell Wilson has been the starter for the past three victories, including a 28-27 road win over the Washington Commanders last week. Baltimore swept two division shootouts against the Bengals -- including a 35-34 home win last week -- and lost to the Browns. While some pointed to a ""soft"" schedule as fuel for the Steelers' fast start, Baltimore began the season with losses to the Kansas City Chiefs and Las Vegas Raiders. The Ravens have won seven of their past eight games with a red-hot offense scoring 28 or more points in all but one contest while averaging 34.4 during that stretch. Lamar Jackson-led Baltimore tops the NFL in both scoring offense (31.8 points per game) and total offense (440.2 yards per game). The Steelers are in second in scoring defense (16.2). Pittsburgh linebacker Patrick Queen spent the previous four seasons as Jackson's teammate. Now he has to figure out how to slow him down. ""He wants to win,"" Queen said of Jackson. ""He'll do whatever it takes to win, and he knows what it takes. So just from my perspective, just going against him, just being able not to tackle him in practice, finally get a chance to actually tackle him, that should be fun. ""He's just a great competitor, he's a great athlete. He can do whatever he wants on the field as we all know. So for me, it's just going against the best."" There is one mark Jackson isn't highly fond of: He is 1-3 all-time as a starting quarterback against the Steelers. Jackson is highly motivated to reverse the trend. ""It's a new year, I'm looking forward to the game,"" Jackson said. ""I'm just focused right now, I'm having fun. I hate everybody in the league -- well, every team in the league -- when I'm going against them."" Whereas the Ravens are introducing Derrick Henry to the division rivalry, this will be the first time the Steelers deploy Wilson at quarterback against Baltimore. Henry leads the NFL in rushing yards (1,120), rushing touchdowns (12) and yards per carry (6.09). Pittsburgh acquired Wilson after he was released by the Denver Broncos in the offseason. ""They're a very good offense. Russ brings a lot to the table, kind of playing the way he plays,"" Ravens coach John Harbaugh said of Wilson. ""We're getting ready to play our best defensive game on Sunday."" Ravens star safety Kyle Hamilton (ankle) missed practice Wednesday. His availability will be firmed up later in the week. Outside linebacker Kyle Van Noy (illness) also missed the session. Steelers standout linebacker Alex Highsmith (ankle) was injured against the Commanders and is ruled out for Week 11. Also sitting out Wednesday for Pittsburgh were running back Najee Harris (ankle), receiver Van Jefferson (quadriceps), tight end MyCole Pruitt (knee) and cornerback Donte Jackson (hamstring). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Nick Bjugstad had two goals for Utah, and Michael Kesselring had two assists. Jack McBain and Mikhail Sergachev scored Utah's other goals, both during the third-period flurry. With the game tied 1-1 at 5:09 of the final frame, Kesselring made a great play to take the puck into Carolina's end, and then made a canny pass to McBain for the conversion. Sergachev followed up at the 7:11 mark, and Bjugstad's second goal of the game came just 17 seconds later to put the hosts up 4-1. Martin Necas' second-period power-play goal was the only tally for the Hurricanes, despite a whopping 50-21 shots advantage and six power-play opportunities. Maple Leafs 4, Capitals 3 (OT) John Tavares scored the winner in overtime to complete Toronto's comeback from a two-goal deficit in the third period for a victory at Washington. Tavares, who also had an assist, broke into the offensive zone to collect Mitch Marner's backhand clear and slid it five-hole on Logan Thompson with 47 seconds left in overtime. William Nylander had a goal and an assist for the Maple Leafs, who have won four of their last five games. Joseph Woll made 24 saves. Aliaksei Protas had a goal and an assist, and Thompson made 30 saves for the Capitals.

The Saints (3-7) will try to continue that success when they host the Cleveland Browns (2-7) on Sunday afternoon. ""Our preparation work last week is the reason we won the game,"" said Rizzi, who was promoted from special teams coordinator when Dennis Allen was fired Nov. 4. ""We had great meetings, we had great practices, we had great walkthroughs and that translated to the field. Our biggest challenge this week is to sustain it."" New Orleans held on to defeat the visiting Atlanta Falcons 20-17 last Sunday. The Falcons threatened three times in the fourth quarter, but Atlanta missed a 46-yard field goal, Tyrann Mathieu intercepted Kirk Cousins and Chase Young's strip sack of Cousins led to Atlanta running out of time. The stops were encouraging for a defense that had allowed the Eagles, Falcons and Panthers to drive to winning scores in the final minutes earlier in the season. ""We ended the game with the defense on the field,"" Rizzi said. ""That goes a long way (toward building confidence)."" But the Saints defense still ranks 24th in scoring, 27th in rushing, 28th in total defense and 29th in pass defense. Atlanta rushed for 181 yards, averaging 5.7 per attempt, and Bijan Robinson had a 37-yard touchdown run. ""We're still not tackling good enough,"" Rizzi said. ""We're still giving up too many rushing yards. We're still giving up too many explosive plays."" New Orleans' run defense might help Cleveland find what it's looking for. Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said a point of emphasis during the bye last week was improving the running game. ""We have to run the ball way more efficiently than we are and find those explosives in the run game,"" Stefanski said. ""We need to lean into the things that we feel our guys do best."" Former Saints quarterback Jameis Winston will make his third consecutive start since Deshaun Watson suffered a season-ending torn Achilles. Winston completed 26 of 46 passes for 235 yards with one touchdown and three interceptions in a 27-10 home loss to the Chargers on Nov. 3. ""I'm grateful for this moment,"" Winston said. ""Opportunities only come so often, so it's definitely a privilege to lead the Cleveland Browns organization and be a starting NFL quarterback. I take pride in that."" Winston, the No. 1 overall pick by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 2015 draft, signed with New Orleans as a free agent in 2020 with the expectation that he would be Drew Brees' successor after being his understudy. After throwing 14 touchdowns and just three interceptions in leading the Saints to a 5-2 start in 2021, Winston suffered a knee injury and injuries limited him again in 2022. The Saints signed Derek Carr before last season and Winston backed him up before signing with the Browns as a free agent. Cleveland has won just one time since Week 2, though that was a Winston start, against the Baltimore Ravens in Week 8. ""We cannot fall victim to what's behind us,"" Winston said. ""We cannot (focus on) what's ahead of us. We have to focus on one day and one play, executing perfectly one play at a time."" Two Saints starters missed practice Wednesday -- linebacker Pete Werner (hand) and guard Lucas Patrick (ankle). Starting center Erik McCoy, who hasn't played since suffering a groin injury in Week 3, was limited. No Cleveland starters missed practice. This will be the Browns' first road game since a 20-16 loss to the Eagles on Oct. 13. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Rookie Jared McCain took advantage of the available playing time by posting career highs in points (34) and assists (10). Bulls 124, Knicks 123 Coby White made three free throws with 3.2 seconds left to cap his 22-point effort and Chicago rallied after squandering a 22-point lead to beat host New York. After falling behind 90-68 late in the third quarter, New York -- playing the second leg of a back-to-back -- ended the period on a 17-0 run to set up an intense fourth quarter. Jalen Brunson, who scored a pair of go-ahead baskets under duress in the final 38 seconds, created space for a fadeaway jumper at the buzzer, but his attempt rimmed in and out. Had the Knicks completed the comeback, it would have been the franchise's biggest second-half rally since a 26-point turnaround in March 2004.

Teammate Josh Cohen helped free Claude up with a ball screen at the top of the key, then Cohen sealed off the paint to give Claude space to finish at the rim. USC (3-0) regained possession after Raysean Seamster traveled, and Claude connected on a one-footed, running jump shot near the free throw for the last two of his team-high 26 points. The shot gave the Trojans a four-point lead with 19 seconds left, and they needed every bit of it.

I think it starts with cleaning up from the game (last) Sunday, cleaning up some little things that I think we could have ended up being a bigger margin of victory for us, especially offensively. ""I think we've got another chance here at home. L.A.'s coming off a short week, so we've got to prepare for them. They're good up front on defense, so we're preparing for them."" Los Angeles has a quicker-than-usual turnaround following a 23-15 loss to the Miami Dolphins on Monday night. The Rams (4-5) were never able to find the end zone, getting five field goals from Joshua Karty to at least keep the game competitive. It marked the end of a three-game winning streak for Los Angeles, which is still within striking distance of the Arizona Cardinals (6-4) for the lead in the NFC West. Rams linebacker Jared Verse realizes that time is of the essence when it comes to making a playoff push, though. ""We can't dwell on this (loss against Miami), ‘Oh no, woe is me,' "" Verse said. ""We have to move on."" Verse was among the few bright spots for Los Angeles against the Dolphins. The rookie had four tackles (two for loss), one sack, one forced fumble and a fumble recovery. Still, Verse believes he can be even better against the Patriots. ""I'll never be satisfied with the way I play,"" he said. ""I think there were definitely a couple plays here and there that I could have made if I did a little bit more."" Offensive linemen Joe Noteboom and Rob Havenstein are both dealing with ankle injuries that forced them to miss practice on Wednesday. Cornerback Charles Woods (ankle) and defensive lineman Neville Gallimore (neck) did not practice as well. Linebacker Byron Young (knee) was limited during the session. Four Patriots players did not practice on Wednesday, including defensive end Deatrich Wise (foot) and linebacker Sione Takitaki (knee). Safety Kyle Dugger was limited by an ankle injury and tight end Hunter Henry was limited because of a foot issue. New England and Los Angeles are facing each other for the first time since Dec. 10, 2020, when the Rams beat the Patriots 24-3. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Rantanen added an assist, Nathan MacKinnon had three assists and Alexandar Georgiev turned away 13 shots for Colorado. Los Angeles goaltender Darcy Kuemper made 18 saves before leaving early in the third period with an apparent injury. Kuemper motioned to an official that he was injured and was replaced by David Rittich at 4:34 of the third. Rittich had four saves. The game was tied when Rantanen beat Rittich from the slot at 10:01 of the third. He scored into an empty net for his second hat trick of the season. He has 12 goals. Adrian Kempe had two goals and Trevor Moore and Anze Kopitar had two assists for the Kings, who didn't record a shot on goal in the second period. Los Angeles wasted no time in getting on the board. Moore passed the puck to Kempe below the right circle, he took a shot on goal that Georgiev stopped but Kempe put in his own rebound at 32 seconds. Colorado responded a few minutes later when Rantanen took a shot from the left circle that Kuemper saved with his glove but the rebound came out and Lehkonen tapped it in just inside the right post at 3:40. It was his third of the season. The Kings went back in front late in the first when Moore fed Kopitar in the left circle, Kopitar passed it to Kempe through the slot, and Kempe knocked it into the open net at 15:51. It was his seventh of the season. Colorado controlled the play in the second period and got the only power play but couldn't generate any chances. The Avalanche eventually tied it when Cale Makar hit Rantanen with a stretch pass at the Kings' blueline, and he beat Kuemper over his right shoulder at 16:07. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Tomas Hertl and Nicolas Roy also scored goals and Shea Theodore had two assists for Vegas, which improved to 25-7-1 all-time against the Ducks (including 11-4-1 at the Honda Center). It was just the second road win of the season for the Golden Knights (2-3-2). Brock McGinn and Frank Vatrano scored goals and Brett Leason had two assists for Anaheim, which lost for the fifth time in its last six games (1-4-1). Lukas Dostal finished with 37 saves. Anaheim took a 1-0 lead at the 17:39 mark of the first period when McGinn snapped in a rebound of a Pavel Mintyukov shot from the low slot for his third goal of the season. Vegas tied it just 92 seconds later on Roy's fifth goal. Theodore set up the score circling around along the left boards and then passing the puck to Roy in the crease where he tapped it past Dostal on the goaltender's blocker side. The Golden Knights took a 2-1 lead midway through the second period on a power-play goal by Hertl, who roofed a rebound of a Jack Eichel shot for his fifth goal. It was Hertl's first goal in eight games and his fourth on the power play. Dorofeyev made it 3-1 early in the third period with his team-leading ninth goal, intercepting an attempted clearing pass by Isac Lundestrom in the slot and then knocking in a rebound of his own shot. The Ducks closed to 3-2 with 13.4 seconds left when Vatrano finished an odd-man rush with a wrist shot past Hill's blocker side for his second goal of the season. But Anaheim, despite pulling Dostal for an extra attacker, couldn't manage to get a shot off in the closing moments. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The Lions managed to extend their winning streak to seven games on Sunday night even though Jared Goff was picked off five times and they trailed by 16 points at halftime. Jake Bates hit a pair of 50-plus yard field goals in the fourth quarter, including the final play of the game, as the Lions pulled out a 26-23 win over Houston. The Lions (8-1), who hold the top spot in the NFC, now host struggling Jacksonville on Sunday afternoon. Another victory would give the Lions their longest winning streak during the Super Bowl era. ""We're going to get everybody's best shot and you have to understand that we have to assume that we will get the best version of what they are and what they're capable of,"" coach Dan Campbell said. ""So, with that, we have to be on our game, and it really is about yourself and it's about the details to what we do."" Goff hadn't thrown an interception in the Lions' previous five games and will look to be more efficient against the Jaguars. ""There's a million things that we can improve on, that I can improve on, that we're going to have to improve on if we want to continue on the trend we're on,"" Goff said. Defensive lineman Za'Darius Smith is expected to make his Lions debut on Sunday. He was acquired at the trade deadline from Cleveland to fortify the pass rush. ""I'm looking for a complementary piece and somebody that's going to be able to help our defense, that's going to elevate us a little bit and I think that he'll do that for us,"" Campbell said. The Jaguars (2-8) will be without their starting quarterback again this week. Trevor Lawrence will miss his second straight game with a shoulder injury. Mac Jones will fill in once again as Jacksonville looks to snap a three-game losing streak ahead of its bye next week. Jones' first start with the Jaguars didn't go too well. He threw for 111 yards and two interceptions in a 12-7 loss to Minnesota last Sunday. The team's top wide receivers, Brian Thomas Jr. and Gabe Davis, were limited to a combined three receptions. ""I thought we played with good tempo in and out of the huddle,"" Jones said. ""Obviously, there are a lot of things to work on throughout the game but it boils down to finishing better by me. I thought I left three plays out there and if you change those three plays then maybe the outcome's a little different."" He'll now face a ball-hawking pass defense that's tied for second in the league with 13 interceptions. ""They're sound all around,"" Jones said of the Lions' defense. ""They do everything well together and they play very physical. It's a physical group. The fan base is awesome and playing at Ford Field will be great and I feel like that whole city embodies football and tough football."" Running back Tank Bigsby suffered an ankle injury in the Vikings' contest and didn't practice on Wednesday. That could mean a heavier workload for Travis Etienne Jr., who was held to 44 yards on 11 carries by Minnesota. Bigsby and Lawrence were the only Jaguars players to miss practice Wednesday. Detroit had a walkthrough on Wednesday and the lone non-participant was tight end Sam LaPorta, who departed Sunday's game early in the second half with a shoulder injury. Offensive tackle Taylor Decker missed the game with a shoulder injury but Campbell is optimistic he'll play against Jacksonville. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Rui Hachimura had 19 points and Austin Reaves scored 18 for the Lakers, including a decisive 3-pointer with 1:09 remaining for a 124-117 lead. Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 29 points and Scotty Pippen Jr., Santi Aldama and Marcus Smart each added 15 points as the Grizzlies saw their season-best three-game winning streak come to an end. Memphis played without Ja Morant (hip) for the third consecutive game and also was without Brandon Clarke (toe) and Desmond Bane (oblique).

Miami (3-6) snapped a three-game losing streak this past Monday with a 23-15 road win against the Los Angeles Rams. The Raiders (2-7) are coming off an eventful bye week and hope to snap their own losing streak, currently at five games. Las Vegas coach Antonio Pierce said Wednesday the Raiders are sticking with Gardner Minshew as their starting quarterback in the hopes of stopping the skid. Minshew has already been benched at two different points this season and has 12 turnovers, which ranks second in the NFL. Minshew has completed 67 percent of his passes (148 for 221) for 1,501 yards, six touchdowns and eight interceptions with an 80.2 passer rating this season. ""Listen, when we brought in Gardner, we expected, obviously, the play that we had seen in the past and at some point, you've got to give a guy confidence,"" Pierce said. ""And there's been times, obviously, with turnovers and other things that have taken place, where we made decisions to either put him on the bench or go to another quarterback."" Minshew was most recently benched in the second half of the Raiders' loss to Cincinnati Bengals in Week 9. The recently signed Desmond Ridder took over in his place. Since the loss, the Raiders have made several personnel moves. Offensive coordinator Luke Getsy, offensive line coach James Cregg and quarterbacks coach Rich Scangarello were all fired. The Raiders elevated Scott Turner to interim offensive coordinator and made former Miami Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin their interim offensive line coach. Las Vegas also hired veteran coach Norv Turner, Scott's father, as senior adviser. The Dolphins' defense held things together through the team's rough start this season. On Monday, the unit sacked Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford four times, forced two turnovers and kept Los Angeles out of the end zone. Miami's offense continues to regain some rhythm as Tua Tagovailoa prepares to make his fourth start since returning from the concussion he suffered in Week 2 against Buffalo. Since his return, Tagovailoa has completed 73 of 94 passes for 672 yards, four touchdowns and one interception. ""I just know there's been an urgency for us to turn our season around and we've looked at it like we are trying to turn each day around, trying to fix each day of prep, fix everything that we can learn from from the game situations and how the prep relates and how we're applying our prep to the games in the realest form, not just saying ‘I want to win,' "" Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said. The Dolphins got some bad news this week regarding their offensive line. Starting right tackle Austin Jackson was placed on injured reserve and is out for the season following a knee injury. Kendall Lamm will likely fill in again with rookie Patrick Paul backing him up. As of Wednesday, offensive lineman Robert Jones (knee), wide receiver Tyreek Hill (wrist) and cornerback Kendall Fuller (concussion) did not practice for the Dolphins. For the Raiders, centers Andre James (ankle) and Cody Whitehair (ankle), cornerback Nate Hobbs (ankle) and tight end Harrison Bryant (ankle) did not practice. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Despite playing without injured Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal, the Suns hung tough and got within 98-90 after a driving hoop by Devin Booker three minutes into the fourth quarter before running out of gas. Also short-handed with the absence of injured Malik Monk and having lost DeMar DeRozan to a sore back in the first half, Sacramento saved its best basketball for the final nine minutes, outscoring the visitors 29-14. The decisive run began with a 12-0 burst that featured 3-pointers by Huerter and Keon Ellis, blowing the game open at 110-90 with just 5:55 remaining.

The Minnesota Vikings would prefer to avoid having to pull off that trick for a second week in a row. Minnesota (7-2) will look to wake up its offense when it visits the Tennessee Titans (2-7) on Sunday afternoon in Nashville. The Vikings are coming off a 12-7 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in which all of their scoring consisted of four field goals. Sam Darnold did not help matters at quarterback as he threw a pair of interceptions in the Jaguars end zone. Darnold has six turnovers in his past two games. Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell wants Darnold and the rest of the offense to take better care of the ball this weekend at Tennessee. ""We're doing a lot of little things that normally lead to having good chances to win,"" O'Connell said. ""But clearly the turnovers are keeping these games very close and relying on other aspects of our team to overcome for that. We need to score points. We need to finish these drives. ""What you can't have is turnovers in the opposing team's end. You're limiting your opportunity to add three, seven, three, seven. Those things add up with the way our defense has played the last couple weeks. So, we've got to do a better job collectively as a group -- myself, our staff, and then our players and clearly Sam."" Meanwhile, look for Tennessee to focus on takeaways as it looks to bounce back from a loss last week against the Los Angeles Chargers. The Titans have lost four of their past five contests, and they are 1-3 on their home field entering the weekend. Titans quarterback Will Levis is expected to make his second straight start since returning from a shoulder injury. He has a modest 79.6 passer rating this season while throwing for 874 yards, seven touchdowns and seven interceptions. Will the remaining eight games in the regular season be enough for Titans coach Brian Callahan and his staff to determine whether Levis is the franchise quarterback going forward? ""It's hard to put a timeline on that,"" Callahan said this week. ""For me, I'm looking for things every game, every practice. If he improves the play that he had last week, we're all going to feel really good about how he's played the position through two games back (from injury). We're just going to keep stacking those games."" Tony Pollard leads the Titans with 666 rushing yards and three touchdowns but has been hindered by a foot injury. Calvin Ridley is the team's No. 1 wide receiver with 32 catches for 483 yards and three scores. The Vikings also are banged up in the backfield as Aaron Jones was limited in practice to start the week because of a rib injury. Jones has rushed for 653 yards and two touchdowns this season. Justin Jefferson has a team-high 53 catches for 831 yards and five touchdowns in the first nine games of the season. He is looking to bounce back from a season-low of 48 receiving yards against Jacksonville last week. This is the first matchup between the teams since Sept. 27, 2020, when the Titans earned a 31-30 win. This will be the Vikings' first regular-season game in Nashville since 2016, when they beat the Titans 25-16. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The Chicago Bears (4-5) can't get much right lately, especially on offense, where new coordinator Thomas Brown is tasked with sparking a rapid turnaround against the visiting Packers (6-3). After scoring at least 24 points in four of its past five games, Green Bay had little trouble moving the ball. Meanwhile, additional rest has allowed quarterback Jordan Love to create distance from knee and groin injuries that hobbled him during the first half of the season. ""Certainly, when you're limited in your lower half as a quarterback, really any type of thrower, that can have a big effect on your ability to just move around in the pocket or throw accurately,"" Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. ""So, it'll be good to just get him some practice under his belt where he's fully healthy."" Offensive struggles continue to plague quarterback Caleb Williams and Chicago. The Bears allowed 10 sacks the past two games and scored just 27 points during the three-game losing streak they'll carry into their first NFC North game of the season. Some Bears fans chanted for coach Matt Eberflus' firing during a 19-3 loss to struggling New England at Soldier Field last week. He's 0-4 against the Packers. On Tuesday, the organization sacked offensive coordinator Shane Waldron instead.  An attack led by Williams, the No. 1 overall draft pick, and flanked by multiple offseason acquisitions has sputtered to an average of 277.6 yards per game, third lowest in the league, and enters Sunday on a streak of 23 straight possessions without a touchdown. The Bears are treading water in the division but opportunities to jump in the standings will be plentiful starting Sunday. After hosting the Packers, the Bears take on the Vikings (7-3), pay a Thanksgiving Day visit to the Detroit Lions (8-1) and start December with a trip to San Francisco (5-4). If they stay on their feet during that run, they'll get all three division opponents and the Seattle Seahawks before the regular season ends.  Injuries along the offensive line haven't helped, leading to 38 sacks of Williams. Last week he started behind a line featuring two backup tackles. On Wednesday, Chicago released veteran guard Nate Davis, who signed a three-year, $30 million deal before last season. Eberflus reiterated that he made the decision to fire Waldron. While players vented frustrations about the offense, they didn't ask that Waldron be removed. ""They just want to do more,"" Eberflus said. ""Individually and as a group. They want to be more productive. More effective. Score points for our football team."" Brown will pivot from passing game coordinator to take the reins as offensive coordinator. He was promoted to offensive coordinator during the season with the Carolina Panthers last season. Green Bay has dominated the NFL's oldest rivalry lately. The Packers boast a 10-game winning streak against the Bears, tied for most in the series and leading the way as the league's longest current win streak by one team against an opponent. The Packers have outscored the Bears by 127 points over that span behind an opportunistic offense and a defense that has limited Chicago to 20 points or less eight times while amassing a plus-19 turnover differential. Green Bay, which has captured three of the past five NFC North titles, is off to a rare 0-2 start in the division but won four of five overall. The Packers lost 24-14 to the Lions in Week 9 but had more total yards, 411-261. ""We've been pretty good as a unit and it's crazy, because it's like we could be so much better,"" Packers running back Josh Jacobs said. ""So, I think that's the fun part about the back end of the season is trying to chase the perfection."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

""It's ... not about money or points, it's about coming together as a team and the fans feed off that -- it's all passion. I don't think we should ever get paid."" Talks of Americans getting paid for the Ryder Cup have been brewing for decades. In 1999 at Brookline, Mass. (one of the most famous Ryder Cup weekends in the event's history), golfers including Tiger Woods voiced their opinions on players not being paid despite the event raking in several million dollars. ""I would like to see us receive whatever the amount is, whether it's $200,000, $300,000, $400,000, $500,000 and I think we should be able to keep the money and do whatever we see fit,"" Woods told The Washington Post in 1999. ""I personally would donate all of it to charity. With all the money that's being made, we should have a say in where it goes."" The charitable donations began being made that same year. Pay-for-play at the Ryder Cup became a hot-button topic during last year's competition near Rome after American Patrick Cantlay did not wear a hat during Saturday's play. Multiple reports stated he did not wear the hat as a protest for players not being paid. Cantlay denied that being the reason, instead saying the hat just did not fit. Said one anonymous European player to The Telegraph: ""(The Americans) can do whatever they want. But we don't want payments in our bank accounts, as it'll be the thin end of the wedge and is not what the Ryder Cup is about. ""Let's face it, a lot of the American players have been angling towards this for years, if not decades. ""If it does go ahead, then it will be interesting to see how the fans react at Bethpage, although they'll probably announce it as just an extension of what already happens."" The 2025 Ryder Cup is scheduled to take place Sept. 23-28. The Americans hold a 27-14 advantage all time in the event, though the Europeans have won five of the last seven contests, including a 16 1/2-11 1/2 win at Marco Simone Golf and Country Club in Italy in 2023. The U.S. team will be captained by Keegan Bradley in 2025. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Nick Bjugstad had two goals for Utah, and Michael Kesselring had two assists. Jack McBain and Mikhail Sergachev scored Utah's other goals, both during the third-period flurry. Martin Necas' second-period power-play goal was the only tally for the Hurricanes, despite a whopping 50-21 shots advantage and six power-play opportunities. With the game tied 1-1 at 5:09 of the final frame, Kesselring made a great play to take the puck into Carolina's end, and then made a canny pass to McBain for the conversion. Sergachev followed up at the 7:11 mark, and Bjugstad's second goal of the game came just 17 seconds later to put the hosts up 4-1. Playing in just his fifth game of the season, Utah backup goalie Vejmelka delivered a career night. Vejmelka and the Utah Hockey Club's defenders had to be spectacular during an extended penalty kill in the third period. A fighting/game-misconduct penalty to Michael Carcone formed the bulk of nine minutes of power-play time for Carolina in the final frame, yet the Hurricanes couldn't add another goal. Carolina lost for just the second time in its past 11 games (9-2-0). Hurricanes starting goalie Pyoty Kochetkov stopped 15 of 18 shots in 46:45 of ice time, and Spencer Martin stopped 2 of 3 shots in a relief effort. Defenseman Sean Walker accidentally collided with Kochetkov on McBain's goal, and a shaken-up Kochetkov was removed from the game after Sergachev's tally. Bjugstad opened the scoring at 17:55 of the first period. Bjugstad's goals were his first two of the season, after the veteran forward missed the Utah Hockey Club's first eight games due to an upper-body injury. Necas has 22 points (eight goals, 14 assists) over a career-best 11-game points streak. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The beauty in this game is it's a team game. The frustrating part is that if you're a great competitor, you hold yourself to a standard that's not unrealistic, and I haven't reached that standard this year."" Rodgers returned this year after missing all but four plays of his first season in New York in 2023, when he tore his left Achilles tendon in the season opener. His comeback season hasn't gone according to plan, though. Rodgers ranks 23rd in the NFL in passer rating at 86.8. He has completed 62.4 percent of his passes for 2,258 yards and 15 touchdowns with seven interceptions -- with his completion percentage, yards per completion and touchdown rate ranking among the lowest of his 20-year career. The Jets, who entered the season with high expectations, own a 3-7 record. Commenting on whether the team's struggles are impacting his view on his future, Rodgers said, ""Not really, not for the negative. Not really, no."" Rodgers is under contract for next season with a $2.5 million base salary plus a $35 million option bonus. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

It was Antetokounmpo's ninth 50-plus outing and the second best of his career, after his 64-point effort against Indiana last season. The two-time MVP hit 21 of 34 from the field, 16 of 17 from the foul line, and had 14 rebounds, seven assists and three blocks. Brook Lopez provided the support with 29 points. Cade Cunningham had 35 points and 11 assists for the Pistons, while Malik Beasley hit eight 3-pointers in his 26-point haul. Antetokounmpo's big evening was almost ruined when he was whistled for a foul with one second left in regulation, and the score was tied at 111, sending Ronald Holland to the free-throw line. Bucks coach Doc Rivers challenged the call unsuccessfully but Holland missed both foul shots, forcing the extension, which Antetokounmpo dominated with 11 points. Antetokounmpo was unguardable from the outset, attacking the Pistons with 22 first-quarter points, but Milwaukee received virtually no other offensive production early. Two Lopez free throws were the only other scores for the Bucks who, Antetokounmpo aside, were 0-for-12 from the floor. Beasley caught fire from the perimeter in the second term against his old side, his corner triple in the closing moments capping a 7-0 run to give Detroit a 60-47 halftime advantage. The Pistons were 8 of 13 from downtown at the half. Detroit's lead swelled to 18 points in the third before the Bucks mounted a sustained fightback, aided by the ejection of Pistons power forward Isaiah Stewart with 3:02 remaining in the third. Stewart had grabbed Antetokounmpo's jersey and yanked him to the ground. Lopez drained a 30-footer in the closing moments of the quarter to cap a 33-14 run and give Milwaukee its first lead. The 7-footer was doing it at both ends, knocking down his fourth triple early in the fourth, then rejecting Cunningham's dunk attempt. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Ben Humrichous added 10 points and six rebounds for Illinois (3-0), which shot a season-low 41.8 percent from the field and committed 18 turnovers against Oakland's matchup zone. Jayson Woodrich paced Oakland (1-2) with 11 points before leaving with 3:28 left with a left shoulder injury. DQ Cole added 10 points and four steals, but the Golden Grizzlies also had 18 turnovers and followed up last week's 3-for-26 3-point shooting at Boise State by going 4-for-25 versus Illinois. Illinois built a 9-5 lead by the first media timeout, then inserted Will Riley into the lineup. The Big Ten's reigning freshman of the week drilled a step-back 3-pointer on his first touch, then added an 8-foot runner and two free throws to cap a three-minute stretch that pushed Illinois' margin to 18-9. Illinois extended the lead to 22-9 when Dra Gibbs-Lawhorn swiped a pass and broke away from a two-handed jam at the 10:52 mark. Oakland responded with 10 straight points in just 2:11 to cut the margin to 22-19. Tuburu Naivalurua started the spree with a jumper, Woodrich finished it with a driving layup and Malcolm Christie added four free throws along the way -- two when Illinois coach Brad Underwood was hit with a technical. Illinois quelled the rally with back-to-back 3-pointers by Kylan Boswell and Tre White, but Naivalurua and teammate Allen Mukeba threw down violent dunks in the final two minutes of the half to pull the Golden Grizzlies within 36-29 at the break. The teams combined for 22 turnovers in the first half, then Illinois committed two miscues in the first 66 seconds of the second half to enable Oakland to pull within two. The first turnover came when Mukeba poked away a pass and raced ahead of the pack for a fierce dunk, then a steal by Cole turned into two Woodrich free throws to make it 38-36 with 18:34 left. That's when Illinois spread the floor and fed Ivisic at the free-throw line, where he could go one-on-one. The lefty sank two jumpers and a layup to help the Fighting Illini rebuild a 49-38 lead with 15:02 to play. Oakland never got within single digits again as both teams went cold. The Illini missed 10 of 11 shots at one point, and the Golden Grizzlies 11 of 12.  Boswell sank two free throws and a 3-pointer, then a no-look pass by Kasparas Jakucionis set up a dunk by Ivisic to make it 66-49 with 1:39 to go. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

After overcoming a two-goal deficit in the third period of a win over the St. Louis Blues on Tuesday, the Bruins look to complete their two-game road trip on another high note Thursday against the Dallas Stars. St. Louis used power-play goals to take a 2-0 lead through two periods, but Morgan Geekie, Charlie McAvoy and David Pastrnak all scored in the final frame to turn the game around. The win was Boston's fourth in six games (4-1-1) following a previous 1-4-1 stretch. An identity that coach Jim Montgomery had emphasized of late showed through. ""We talked about staying with it for 60 minutes and playing the right way,"" Montgomery said. ""And even though we made a couple of mistakes in the third still -- because you're going to make mistakes, it's a game of mistakes -- we just kept battling. ... We got to the goal line and got some greasy goals."" Pastrnak scored the game-winner with 1:47 remaining, completing the Bruins' first third-period comeback from multiple goals since Nov. 1, 2022. McAvoy matched him with a two-point effort. McAvoy believes that win can lead to more in Dallas and moving forward to a three-game homestand, which begins with a Saturday rematch against the Blues. ""You've got to do the right things moving forward, but there's a couple times throughout a (season) where you ... come back and find a way like we did (Tuesday), and you can really build off those,"" McAvoy said. Defenseman Hampus Lindholm was lost to a lower-body injury during Tuesday's game and will miss ""weeks,"" leading the Bruins to recall Jordan Oesterle from Providence of the AHL, where he recorded three goals and eight points in nine games. The 32-year-old Oesterle, who Montgomery described as a smart player and excellent skater, has played in 371 career NHL games, most recently with the Calgary Flames last season. The Stars have won two of three since returning from the NHL Global Series in Finland and were last in action Monday at Pittsburgh, scoring six straight first-period goals en route to a 7-1 drubbing of the Penguins. ""It was a good step in the right direction,"" center Matt Duchene said. ""We know what to expect from Boston. It's never an easy game. No matter how well or not well they're playing, they're always a tough team. ... Our compete and details have to be there."" Defenseman Miro Heiskanen was the lone repeat scorer in Pittsburgh, helping Dallas become the first NHL team to rattle off six goals during the opening period of any game since the 2022-23 season. ""It's nice for a bunch of the guys to get on the board and kind of feel good about ourselves,"" left winger Mason Marchment said. ""I thought, right from the start of the game, we were on it."" Marchment notched a goal and four assists, with four of his five points coming in the first. Prior to Monday, Dallas had lost three of four and gone three consecutive games without scoring more than three goals. The seven-goal total was its highest since a 5-2 win in Boston Oct. 24 in which Duchene and Tyler Seguin each registered a goal and two assists. ""We haven't had one of those games all year, we had some bounces and some seeing-eye goals,"" coach Pete DeBoer said. ""We had some guys who really needed a goal, so that was much needed."" Wyatt Johnston snapped a 10-game goal drought on Monday, while fellow 21-year-old Logan Stankoven scored for the second time in three games and now has 13 points to lead all NHL rookies. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Washington was down by 21 points in the fourth quarter but made a spirited comeback in the final minutes, cutting the lead to five points with 23.4 seconds left before running out of time. Devin Vassel added 17 points for the Spurs while Julian Champagnie scored 12 points and Harrison Barnes, Stephon Castle and Blake Wesley had 10 each. Chris Paul distributed 11 assists for San Antonio, which won consecutive outings for just the second time this year and pulled to .500 after 12 games. Jordan Poole amassed a season-high 42 points (one off his career best) to lead seven Wizards in double-figure scoring. Corey Kispert added 19 points, Jonas Valanciunas racked up 16 points and 13 rebounds, Carlton Carrington had 13 points, Alexandre Sarr and Kyshawn George scored 12 apiece and Kyle Kuzma hit for 10 for Washington, which has dropped six straight games. Washington trailed early but outscored San Antonio 22-7 over the final five-plus minutes of the first quarter to pull within 32-31 after 12 minutes of play. San Antonio rebuilt its lead to eight points on Wesley's cutting layup off a Paul assist with 6:07 to play in the second quarter. The Wizards swung back, tying the game at 63 on a 3-pointer and then a bucket by Poole and took their first lead of the game on Sarr's hook 38 seconds later. The teams traded baskets in the final minute, sending the game to the break tied at 67. Wembanyama led all scorers with 24 points before halftime while pouring in four 3-pointers. Poole had 19 points to pace the Wizards while Valanciunas added 10 points and took 11 rebounds over the first two quarters. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Aranguren had 13 points and Seton Hall transfer Jaquan Sanders added 12 points for Hofstra (3-0). Chaunce Jenkins had 18 points and Dylan Addae-Wusu finished with 11 points for Seton Hall, which has lost two straight and is 1-2 for the first time since 2020-21. Seton Hall led 24-22 following a sludgy first half in which the teams shot a combined 31.5 percent (17-for-54), including 25.9 percent (7-for-27) from 3-point land. Sanders hit a driving layup and Cruz Davis dunked following a steal at midcourt to put Hofstra up 40-39 with 5:12 left. Sanders' basket was preceded by a nine-second stretch in which the Pirates missed 5 of 6 free throws. Seton Hall's Prince Aligbe and Aranguren traded layups before the teams turned the ball over on consecutive possessions. Addae-Wusu split a pair of free throws following the under-4 timeout to tie the game at 42. Davis then hit two free throws before Jenkins put Seton Hall ahead 45-44 with a 3-pointer with 2:41 left.

Tavares, who also had an assist, broke into the offensive zone to collect Mitch Marner's backhand clear and slid it five-hole on Logan Thompson with 47 seconds left in overtime. William Nylander had a goal and an assist for the Maple Leafs, who have won four of their last five games. Joseph Woll made 24 saves. Nylander made it 3-2 at 15:51 of the third period when he pushed in a Matthew Knies shot that had trickled behind Thompson. After Knies had a tying goal waved off for a high stick, Marner's one-timer on the power play from the left circle with Woll pulled for the extra attacker knotted it 3-3 with 48 seconds left. Aliaksei Protas had a goal and an assist, and Thompson made 30 saves for the Capitals. Taylor Raddysh gave Washington a 1-0 lead at 11:12 of the first period when his centering pass hit the skate of Toronto's Max Domi and deflected blocker side on Woll. The Maple Leafs responded 59 seconds later. Tavares cut around defenseman Matt Roy in the left circle and fed Bobby McMann, who was alone in front to snap it through Thompson and tie it 1-1. Dylan Strome put the Capitals in front 2-1 at 18:33. The center took a pass from Protas to the net and, after showing backhand, went to his forehand to slip it by the left skate of Woll. After a Washington goal midway through the second period was overturned on a Maple Leafs challenge for goaltender interference, Protas got one that counted for a 3-1 advantage at 17:48. His pass intended for Alex Ovechkin down low was blocked, and Rasmus Sandin collected it and threaded it back to Protas, who quickly fired it glove side from the bottom of the right circle. Toronto appeared to pull within one midway through the third courtesy of Steven Lorentz, but the call was reversed after video review determined Lorentz propelled the puck in with his leg. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Houston opened the fourth quarter with a 9-0 run that yielded a 98-79 lead. The Clippers then went deep into their bench only for those reserves -- Kobe Brown, Jordan Miller and Bones Hyland -- to key a rally and close the deficit to 107-103 on two Hyland free throws with 1:42 left. But Sengun (13 points, 11 rebounds) delivered his driving dunk before Tari Eason (18 points, 10 rebounds) added another in transition to seal the victory. Amen Thompson (18 points, 11 rebounds), like Eason, posted a double-double off the bench for Houston, which received 15 points, five rebounds and five assists from Fred VanVleet, who missed Monday's win over the Wizards with an injury. Houston produced a 59-42 rebounding advantage and scored 19 second-chance points. James Harden led the Clippers with 19 points and seven assists while Terance Mann added 14 points and seven rebounds off the bench. Norman Powell scored 13 points but missed 13 of 18 shots. The Clippers' scorching start yielded a double-digit lead before the halfway mark of the first quarter. When Harden completed a four-point play with 7:02 left in the period, it capped a 5-for-5 start from deep for the Clippers, who extended to an 11-point lead before Houston roared back. The Rockets' 12-0 run late in the first offset that run of 9-0 by the Clippers, with Thompson and VanVleet playing roles in the waning moments that allowed Houston to pull even at 28-28 entering the second, during which the momentum swings continued. Amir Coffey and Mann teamed for 14 points off the bench and a transition alley-oop that pushed the Clippers to a 45-43 lead at the 7:25 mark. The Rockets responded with back-to-back 3s from VanVleet and Jabari Smith Jr. VanVleet delivered a 3-pointer and driving layup down the stretch to supply the Rockets a 61-56 lead at the intermission, closing a half that featured 10 lead changes and nine ties and included the teams shooting a combined 19 for 39 from deep. Eason scored eight points during a 10-2 run that closed the third quarter. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

He scored on a wrist shot from the bottom of the left circle off the rush. It broke a scoreless streak of nearly 112 minutes for Detroit, dating back to the second period of Friday night's 3-1 loss to the host Toronto Maple Leafs.  Kane then put in a one-timer from the bottom of the right circle, converting a pass from Dylan Larkin, for his third goal of the season. The Penguins then scored twice in the period to tie it. Rust cut in off the left wing, going around Red Wings' defenseman Moritz Seider. Rust then skated across the top of the crease and swept a forehand shot past Talbot at 7:19 of the middle period. It was Rust's fourth goal.  Beauvillier made it 2-2 just over five minutes later when he scored from the bottom of the right circle for his fifth goal.

Chance McMillian had 16 points and was 4-for-4 from deep for the Red Raiders, who are 3-0 and were just outside of the AP Top 25 this week. It was the Red Raiders' 33rd consecutive home nonconference victory. Wyoming suffered its first defeat. The Cowboys were led by Obi Agbim with 15 points. Wyoming took its only lead of the contest 9-8 when Kobe Newton made a long 3-pointer with the shot clock running down and 16:40 left in the first half. The next nine minutes were marked by an incident at halfcourt. Cowboys guard Dontaie Allen shoved Dorian Williams of Texas Tech after a dead ball whistled when Williams and Elijah Hawkins wrestled the ball away from Agbim and Williams stepped over Agbim in the aftermath. Three technical fouls were eventually called, two on Texas Tech and one on Wyoming. In the meantime, the Cowboys couldn't score from the floor and Texas Tech's defense took over. The Red Raiders wound up forcing 17 first-half turnovers and 25 for the game. Texas Tech scored 14 straight points, including seven by Toppin, to build a 32-13 advantage. The Red Raiders eventually led 46-20 at the break. Wyoming shot just 26.3 percent from the floor in the first half. In the second half, there was a moment of concern for Red Raiders fans as Toppin exited the game with 16:53 left and was checked by a trainer. He would later return.  Texas Tech continued to force more Wyoming mistakes and put on a show offensively with Hawkins feeding Federiko Federiko for multiple dunks. The lead was as big as 49. The storyline entering the contest was the Cowboys squaring off against former head coach Jeff Linder, who left the Wyoming program after four seasons in May to become the lead assistant at Texas Tech under Grant McCasland. In exchange for Linder, Texas Tech agreed to two games between the schools the next two years with Tech paying Wyoming $150,000 for each. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

After falling behind 90-68 late in the third quarter, New York -- playing the second leg of a back-to-back -- ended the period on a 17-0 run to set up an intense fourth quarter. There were 10 lead changes in the final period, the last coming on White's free throws on a tough foul call against Josh Hart. Jalen Brunson, who scored a pair of go-ahead baskets under duress in the final 38 seconds, created space for a fadeaway jumper at the buzzer, but his attempt rimmed in and out. Had the Knicks completed the comeback, it would have been the franchise's biggest second-half rally since a 26-point turnaround in March 2004. Zach LaVine led Chicago with 31 points and matched Brunson with a game-high eight assists. He also snagged seven rebounds. Karl-Anthony Towns scored 17 of his 46 points in the fourth quarter and hauled in 10 rebounds. Towns' scoring performance was a personal best since joining the Knicks in an offseason trade. Brunson and Towns combined to score 10 of New York's final 12 points. White, meanwhile, was clutch for Chicago. His 3-pointer on one of Ayo Dosunmu's six assists to answer a hard-charging Towns bucket gave the Bulls a four-point cushion in the final two minutes. Dosunmu was one of five Bulls to score in double-figures, shooting 5-of-8 from the floor en route to 16 points.

The basket made it 101-79 Thunder with 3:20 to play, putting an exclamation point on a dominating performance two days after Gilgeous-Alexander posted a career-high 45 points. Williams added seven assists, six rebounds, four steals and two blocks. The Thunder, who are 2-0 since Chet Holmgren suffered a broken pelvis in Sunday's loss to Golden State, rode its defense to Wednesday's win. Oklahoma City forced 24 New Orleans turnovers and turned them into 29 points, outscoring the Pelicans 34-2 on the fast break.  The Pelicans managed just four points off seven Oklahoma City turnovers and didn't score their lone fast-break basket until late in the fourth quarter. Indicative of the Thunder's defensive dominance, Boston committed six turnovers in 31 minutes in the loss. He had six in Pelicans' first eight games combined entering Wednesday. He was elevated into a bigger ball-handling role with Jose Alvarado lost to injury earlier in the week. The game was tied 59-59 less than three minutes into the third quarter before Oklahoma City reeled off 16 consecutive points to grab control for good. The Pelicans turned the ball over five times in the stretch. Brandon Ingram led New Orleans with 18 points and six assists but had eight turnovers. The Pelicans have lost six consecutive games and nine of their last 10. New Orleans got off to a quick start, jumping out to an 18-6 lead less than five minutes into the game, with eight points from Ingram during that stretch. But the Thunder closed the quarter with a 27-10 run to hold a 33-28 lead after the first 12 minutes. The Pelicans shot just 39.5 percent from the floor, their third sub-40 percent shooting game of the season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Guards AJ Hoggard (nine points, six assists, four steals), Tyler Tanner (14 points, three steals) and Grant Huffman (six points, six assists, five rebounds four steals) led the way on defense for the Commodores. Jason Edwards led Vanderbilt (3-0) with 18 points, and Devin McGlockton added 16 points and three blocks. Cal (2-1) got double-figure scoring from Andrej Stojakovic (17), BJ Omot (15), DJ Campbell (12) and Jovan Blacksher Jr. (11). The Bears' Lee Dort, who spent the last two seasons at Vanderbilt, had a game-high 10 rebounds but scored just four points. Cal turned the ball over just 21 times combined in their two games this year. Five of their giveaways on Wednesday came from Blacksher. Hoggard and McGlockton picked up their fourth fouls with 7:37 and 6:03 remaining, respectively, but the Commodores' deep bench (nine played logged at least 15 minutes) helped prevent a serious Cal run late in the game. Vanderbilt went up 21 after an Edwards 3-pointer to start the second half, but the Bears, behind a scoring flurry from Stojakovic, cut the deficit to 61-52 on Omot's jumper with 12:39 left. The Commodores then cranked up the defensive heat again, with steals from Chris Manon and MJ Collins Jr. leading to back-to-back, fastbreak layups from Collins and Tanner. Cal was never able to make a sustained push from there and a corner 3-pointer from Edwards with 4:56 left pushed the margin 83-63. Vanderbilt shot 19-for-23 on 2-point attempts while building a 49-31 halftime edge. The Commodores forced 12 turnovers that turned into 20 points while holding Cal's leading scorer, Blacksher (17.5-point average coming in) to two first-half points. Blacksher also committed three turnovers before the break. Cal coach Mark Madsen was absent to be with his family following the birth of a child this week. Associate head coach Adam Mazarei, a Vanderbilt assistant from 2019-23, led the team in his absence. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Five nights after needing overtime to earn a four-point win on their homecourt, the Celtics rallied from an early 13-point deficit. Boston beat the Nets for the sixth straight time and for the 12th time in the past 13 meetings. Coming off a 5-of-16 showing in Tuesday's one-point home loss to the Atlanta Hawks, Tatum made 12 of 19 of shots, handed out 10 of Boston's season-best 35 assists and collected nine rebounds. Jaylen Brown added 24 points and 12 rebounds as the Celtics delighted many of their fans in the crowd by shooting a season-best 53.8 percent. Payton Pritchard contributed 23, Jrue Holiday chipped in 16 and Sam Hauser finished with 12 as the trio combined to hit 11 of Boston's 22 3s. Ziare Williams scored 23 points and started for the second straight game for Dorian Finney-Smith (sprained left ankle) but the Nets could not keep pace with Boston's offense and lost for the third time in four games. Brooklyn also played without Ben Simmons (left calf tightness). Cam Thomas added 17 and Dennis Schroder contributed 16 as the Nets shot 50.6 percent and took their most lopsided loss of the season. Cameron Johnson's 3-pointer opened a 26-13 lead for the Nets with 3:52 remaining, but the Celtics ended the opening period with a 19-8 run wherein Tatum scored nine of their final 12 points of the quarter to slice the deficit to 34-32. The Celtics took their first lead when Hauser's 3 made it 37-36 early in the second, and they held a 65-60 edge at halftime. Boston began pulling away with about eight minutes left in the third when Tatum's open 3 pushed the lead to 80-68. Holiday's 3 extended the lead to 85-70 with 7:17 left and two hoops by Tatum in the final two minutes helped Boston take a 103-89 edge into the fourth. Tatum finished off his big night by hitting three free throws with 5:21 left for a 123-101 lead and then hit a 17-footer a few minutes later to a loud ovation. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Paul, a 27-year-old YouTube star turned professional boxer, has risen quickly in his quest for mainstream boxing credibility. In July, he knocked out Mike Perry, a veteran of UFC and Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship, to earn his fourth consecutive win and improve to 10-1 with seven KOs. Opposite Paul is the former undisputed heavyweight champion Tyson, 58. The fight is Tyson's first sanctioned professional boxing match since losing to Kevin McBride in June 2005. Tyson retired shortly after that. His most recent bout was an exhibition bout against Roy Jones Jr. in November 2020. Tyson (50-6, 44 KOs) was a man of few words on Wednesday night, responding to critics who are predicting he's too old to compete at the highest level and confirming he is only focused on the fight against Paul and nothing past that. ""I'm just ready to fight,"" Tyson said. He remained stoic throughout the event, answering only the questions assigned to him and letting Paul make bold predictions about how the fight might play out. Paul asked nine of the 12 fighters on stage for Wednesday's event to honor a spontaneous bet if he lost to Tyson. Bets included putting fight purses at stake and as little as $20. When asked whether he would fight actual boxers (omitting Tyson), Paul brushed off the question but said his goal remains becoming the biggest superstar the sport has ever seen. ""Just excitement,"" Paul said. ""Excitement. Big fights, big knockouts. A lot of fighters go in (the ring) and have boring (expletive) fights like Floyd Mayweather (Jr.), and I've brought in a lot of excitement to the sport, knocking people out in the biggest platforms possible going against the biggest names and making the matchups fans want to see."" Tyson said he doesn't believe in the circus aspect of the fight, treating Paul like any other boxer. ""The people speak for themselves,"" Tyson said when addressing the plethora of champions on stage with him. Paul vs. Tyson was initially scheduled for July 20 before Tyson's ulcer flare-up in late May forced a postponement. The fight will take place at AT&T Stadium, home to the NFL's Dallas Cowboys. According to moderator and MMA journalist Ariel Helwani, 70,000 fans are expected to attend with a limited ticket inventory still available. The main card begins at 8 p.m. ET and includes four fights. The co-feature is a rematch over two years in the making, featuring Katie Taylor of Ireland against Amanda Serrano of Puerto Rico for the undisputed super lightweight world title. Taylor won the first bout by split decision after 10 rounds to keep her lightweight crown on May 1, 2022, at New York's Madison Square Garden. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Mitchell finished with 23 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists for Cleveland (13-0), which is off to the NBA's best start since the Golden State Warriors' record-setting 24-game winning streak to begin the 2015-16 season. The Cavaliers scuffled through much of the first half in this one before making a variety of big shots when it mattered most. Philadelphia fought hard without Joel Embiid (knee), Paul George (knee) and Tyrese Maxey (hamstring) but still lost for the ninth time in 11 games this season. The 76ers were playing on back-to-back nights, having lost to the New York Knicks on Tuesday. Rookie Jared McCain took advantage of the available playing time by scoring a career-high 34 points, while Kelly Oubre Jr. had 20 and Caleb Martin chipped in 18. With Cleveland clinging to a 103-100 lead with under three minutes to play, Mitchell drained 3-pointers on consecutive possessions to put the Cavaliers ahead 109-102. He added a step-back 3-pointer with 1:18 remaining and then drove for a layup to make it 114-104 with about a minute left. Both teams made five 3-pointers in the first quarter -- the Cavs needed only eight attempts to do so -- as Cleveland led 31-27 after one period. The Sixers began the second quarter with a 12-1 run. Reggie Jackson scored eight of those points for the hosts, while Martin had the other four. Philadelphia led by as many as eight points in the second quarter and held a 54-48 lead going into the locker room. Early in the third quarter, Cleveland scored 10 straight points, punctuated by Garland's floater, to turn a seven-point deficit into a 62-59 lead. Garland scored 13 third-quarter points for the visitors, who led 82-78 after three periods. Mitchell found Ty Jerome for a 3-pointer on the first possession of the fourth quarter and then drained a jumper on the next trip to grow Cleveland's cushion to 87-78. Philadelphia chipped away, however, closing within 95-93 on Oubre's layup with 6:47 to play. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Thompson is averaging 16.5 points per game in Oklahoma State's 2-0 start while shooting 56.5 percent, meaning he is scoring more efficiently. He averaged 11.8 and 11.6 points per game in the last couple of seasons but failed to make 40 percent of his attempts in either campaign.

SIU (1-1) is coming off an 86-64 verdict Friday night against Division II Missouri S&T, the first win for new coach Scott Nagy. He's won 578 games in a 30-year career spent at South Dakota State and Wright State until he replaced Bryan Mullins in March.

Metcalf hopes to return to action when Seattle (4-5) visits the San Francisco 49ers (5-4) on Sunday. He sustained a Grade 1 MCL sprain in the Seahawks' 34-14 road victory against the Falcons. Seattle then lost home games to the Buffalo Bills and the Los Angeles Rams before a bye in Week 10. Metcalf has 35 receptions on 61 targets for 568 yards and three touchdowns in seven games (six starts) this season. Seattle selected him in the second round of the 2019 NFL Draft out of Ole Miss. A two-time Pro Bowl selection, Metcalf has 407 receptions for 5,900 yards and 46 touchdowns in 89 regular-season games (87 starts). He also has 26 receptions for 451 yards and five TDs in four playoff games, all starts. The Seahawks activated right tackle Abraham Lucas off the physically unable to perform list on Wednesday, at the end of his 21-day practice window. If Lucas had not been activated, he would have stayed on the PUP list for the remainder of the season. Lucas, 26, was a third-round pick of the Seahawks in 2022. He started all 22 games he played in 2022 and 2023 but was limited to six games last season because of a knee injury that required surgery, putting him on the PUP list. To make room for Lucas on the 53-man roster, Seattle placed offensive tackle George Fant on injured reserve that will require he miss at least four games. Fant, 32, played two games, both starts, this season before leaving each contest with a knee injury. Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said he was uncertain if Fant would be able to play again this season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

MLB News,Rays will play in Tampa in 2025,https://www.mlb.com/news/rays-2025-steinbrenner-field,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 22:07:00 GMT",,"Adam Berry TAMPA, Fla. -- The Rays have found a home for the 2025 regular season: George M. Steinbrenner Field in Tampa. With Tropicana Field significantly damaged by Hurricane Milton last month and not expected to be repaired until 2026, the Rays had to search for an interim home for next season. That led them to Steinbrenner Field, home of the Yankees in Spring Training and the Single-A Tampa Tarpons in the Florida State League. “We deeply appreciate that the Yankees have graciously allowed us to play at Steinbrenner Field for the 2025 season,” Rays principal owner Stuart Sternberg said in a statement. “The hurricane damage to Tropicana Field has forced us to take some extraordinary steps, just as Hurricanes Helene and Milton have forced thousands of families and businesses in our community to adapt to new circumstances as we all recover and rebuild.’’ The Rays will remain at their Charlotte Sports Park facility in Port Charlotte, Fla., for their Spring Training workouts and home games. The Yankees will continue to play their Spring Training games at Steinbrenner Field in 2025 before their American League East rivals move in for the regular season, and the Tarpons are expected to play elsewhere within the Yankees’ Minor League complex. The Rays are set to begin the season at home against the Rockies on March 27. By that point, they will have moved into the home clubhouse at Steinbrenner Field and done what they can to make the Yankees’ facility look as much like a Tampa Bay home ballpark as possible. We are thrilled to play in Tampa Bay. 🩵 “We are happy to extend our hand to the Rays and their fans by providing a Major League-quality facility for them to utilize this season,’’ Yankees managing general partner Hal Steinbrenner said in a statement. “Both the Yankees organization and my family have deep roots in the Tampa Bay region, and we understand how meaningful it is for Rays players, employees and fans to have their 2025 home games take place within 30 minutes of Tropicana Field. In times like these, rivalry and competition take a back seat to doing what’s right for our community — which is continuing to help families and businesses rebound from the devastation caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton.” Commissioner Rob Manfred said recently that MLB hoped to keep the Rays close to their fans in the Tampa Bay area, which this move will accomplish. In a press release announcing the decision, the Rays said they selected Steinbrenner Field “because it is the best-prepared facility in the Tampa Bay region to host regular-season Major League Baseball games.” “Given the significant challenges caused by Hurricane Milton, I appreciate the hard work and collaboration between the two teams that allowed the Rays to make the best decision for next season,"" Manfred said in a statement. ""This outcome meets Major League Baseball’s goals that Rays’ fans will see their team play next season in their home market and that their players can remain home without disruption to their families.” Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Indeed, Rays president Matt Silverman said the club wanted to stay in the area to provide their fans, employees, players and coaches with “as much normalcy as possible, given the disruption that’s taken place at Tropicana Field.” Spending the season in Tampa will allow that. The Rays considered other nearby Spring Training ballparks, including BayCare Ballpark in Clearwater and TD Ballpark in Dunedin, but Steinbrenner Field ultimately offered the best available facilities. That was of the utmost importance considering the limited time between the Trop being damaged and the start of Spring Training. Steinbrenner Field also has the largest capacity of any Spring Training stadium in the Tampa Bay area, at 11,026, plus 13 luxury suites. The Rays said they expect additional improvements to be made before the season begins “to ensure fans continue to have a wonderful experience at Rays games.” According to the Rays, Steinbrenner Field was in the process of being renovated to improve its clubhouse and playing facilities. Other recent upgrades to the ballpark include upgraded field lighting, expanded home clubhouse space and improved training and rehabilitation capabilities. Silverman said the Rays are working with MLB and the MLB Players Association to understand what further upgrades must be made to get the ballpark ready for a big league season. While the home clubhouse has been renovated, the visiting side will likely require additions, expansion and MLB-caliber amenities. “The amount of work that's going to be required by a combination of the Yankees and Rays organizations to get the facility ready for March is incredible, and time is of the essence. The Yankees have been great partners,” Silverman said. “They've been incredibly responsive. They've been so gracious with their time, with their facility, and I know that together, we're going to be able to pull off what is a very challenging feat in just a couple of months.” Steinbrenner Field opened in 1996, when it was known as Legends Field. The ballpark is centrally located in Tampa, sitting just across Dale Mabry Highway from Raymond James Stadium, home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The playing field’s dimensions are somewhat similar to Tropicana Field (and identical to Yankee Stadium in the Bronx), going 318 feet out to left field (315 at Tropicana Field), 408 to center (404 at the Trop) and 314 to right (322 at the Trop). One challenge will be the hot, rainy and humid Florida weather in the summer, which often leads to rain delays in the Florida State League and forces teams to shift their pregame work inside. Welcome to the neighborhood, @RaysBaseball. The Krewe is with you through this transition. pic.twitter.com/Ncof4Q8A0T The Rays hope to be back inside Tropicana Field in 2026, assuming St. Petersburg moves forward with the necessary repairs to the city-owned stadium. Earlier this year, the St. Petersburg City Council and Pinellas County Commission approved their plans to build a new, $1.3 billion ballpark that would open in 2028 as part of the Historic Gas Plant District in St. Pete.

MLB News,Here are 7 Hot Takes for a sizzling offseason,https://www.mlb.com/news/bold-predictions-for-mlb-offseason-2024-2025,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 03:49:56 GMT",,"Anthony Castrovince This is the time of year when anything appears possible. Even more than Opening Day, when hope springs eternal for all 30 clubs, the onset of the offseason is fascinating because it’s still so unclear what the final rosters will look like. It’s the time of year when, for instance, you can come across a headline like, “Rays reach out to Juan Soto,” because, hey, it’s an open market, isn’t it? • Latest free agent and trade rumors The Hot Stove, therefore, is the perfect time for Hot Takes. So here are a handful of thoughts I’ve had while wondering if Jose Siri will give up his No. 22 jersey to Soto. 1. The Yankees might be better off without Juan Soto. Everything I think about the Yankees’ offseason boils down to this: Aaron Judge should not be in center field. I’m not saying that because Judge biffed a big ball in Game 5 of the World Series; I’m saying that because there’s no reason for a team with the Yankees’ resources to have a player that old (Judge will be 33 next season), that big and that important in such a demanding defensive position. In the last 15 years, there have only been seven players -- Brett Gardner, Curtis Granderson, Torii Hunter, Coco Crisp, Denard Span, Lorenzo Cain and Angel Pagán -- to have a season in which they qualified for the batting title in center field at the age of 33 or older. And none of them was 6-foot-7, 280 pounds. Having Giancarlo Stanton at DH limits the Yankees’ options with Judge. And if they’re not going deep, deep, deep into luxury tax territory, then re-signing Soto reduces their flexibility and their ability to get more athletic elsewhere. Just spitballing here, but what if, instead of Judge in center and Soto in right, you could have Judge in right, Jazz Chisholm Jr. in center, Alex Bregman at third base, Willy Adames at second base and Christian Walker at first base? According to MLB Trade Rumors’ projections, you could sign Bregman, Adames and Walker for a long-term total of about $400 million, versus the $600 million it might take to keep Soto. And you would have a team that is deeper and more defensively dependable, albeit without a Gehrig to Judge’s Ruth. 2. The Diamondbacks should keep Jordan Montgomery. So … this is awkward. When Montgomery went unsigned last winter despite coming off his best season, the D-backs scooped him up late in Spring Training on a one-year, $25 million deal with a $22.5 million player option for 2024. It was a disaster. The late start did Montgomery no favors, and he never got into a groove. He pitched so poorly (6.23 ERA) that when the season ended Arizona owner Ken Kendrick publicly stated that he regretted the signing and took responsibility for having pushed for it. Montgomery exercised the player option anyway, because, well, it’s $22.5 million. You’d do the same. And that has led to speculation that the D-backs might now deal Montgomery to divorce themselves from this sticky situation. But even though the Snakes seemingly have a starting pitching surplus at the moment, that’s only true until it’s not. Selling low on Montgomery is senseless. Rather, I’d embrace the awkwardness with Montgomery, because, when you look at his career, 2024 is a clear outlier. The two sides would be better off pursuing ways they can make each other better and salvage what’s left of this deal. And to the D-backs’ credit, GM Mike Hazen has already been working to smooth things over. 3. The A’s should trade Brent Rooker. A’s general manager David Forst said, “We are not trading Brent Rooker,” which sure makes it sound as though they are not trading Brent Rooker. But I don’t get it. Keeping the 26-year-old Mason Miller after his transcendent rookie season is one thing, given the long-term cost control involved. But Rooker is arbitration-eligible for the first time this winter and will play next season at age 30. He is an extraordinarily valuable trade chip in a market in which only one team can land Soto. His 165 OPS+ this season was the 16th-best ever for a qualified DH. His trade value will likely never be higher than it is right now. And while the A’s did play .500 ball in the second half, they just aren’t in a competitive enough position to be punting on opportunities to improve their long-term organizational outlook. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. 4. The NL East team that needs Pete Alonso most is not the Mets. There seems to be this theory that Alonso is worth more to the Mets than any other team. Because of the prodigious power he’s brought to their lineup since 2019. Because of his popularity. Because he hit that season-saving blast off the Brewers’ Devin Williams in the NL Wild Card Series. But it should be obvious that, for the Mets, signing the 26-year-old Soto should take precedence over re-upping with Alonso. They can do both, of course, but having Soto, Alonso, Francisco Lindor and Brandon Nimmo all inked for $20 million-plus through at least 2030 has the potential to hamstring the Mets down the road. And with or without Soto, there is an argument to be made for a (likely) more budget-friendly move for Walker or moving Mark Vientos to first base and improving defensively at the hot corner. The team that actually needs Alonso most is the Nationals. Coming off five straight seasons with a sub-.440 winning percentage, they are at a pivotal point in player development where it’s time to start creating a winning culture. They’ve got good young starting pitching, and they graduated intriguing outfield prospects Dylan Crews and James Wood to the big leagues this year. Still, they could use a proven centerpiece like Alonso, who would bring instant credibility to a lineup that was last in the NL in homers last season and got a lowly .686 OPS from first base. 5. No team should be more aggressive than the Orioles. The above is not meant to suggest that the O’s should be this offseason’s biggest spender. I’d venture to guess that title will go to whichever team signs Soto (duh). That won’t be Baltimore. But after their second consecutive empty October, the O’s have to raise the organizational stakes again. They made the big trade last offseason for Corbin Burnes and do deserve some credit for getting some big production out of Zach Eflin in a midseason trade market that was seriously short on starting pitching. That said, no team was in better position to make the Tigers an offer they couldn’t refuse on Tarik Skubal, and that particular ship has sailed now that the Tigers proved themselves as contenders. So it's on the O’s to go elsewhere for their clear pitching needs, which only become more pressing with Burnes on the open market. They can let Burnes and his declining K rate walk, recoup Draft pick compensation and still find a way to improve the rotation. With new ownership and a still-stocked system, they have the ability to, say, sign Blake Snell and trade for Garrett Crochet. We dream big with Baltimore because of the upside and cost control of their young core. But that core will get a lot more expensive (and therefore more complicated) in the not-too-distant future, so it is incumbent upon the O’s now to make sure this championship window is not wasted. 6. Walker Buehler will be the best starter signed this winter. I’m what the kids call a Walker Buehler “stan.” I love the guy. He’s got stuff, but he’s also got guts. This is a team for which the likes of Max Scherzer and Tyler Glasnow have been unable to post in pivotal moments in recent years. But Buehler takes the ball. He did it on short rest in Game 6 of the 2021 NLCS when Scherzer had a dead arm (that may have had an impact on Buehler’s elbow, which required Tommy John the following year). Buehler returned this year and again stepped up in the World Series, making it clear he was available to pitch in relief prior to Game 5 and then doing so with a perfect ninth just two days after starting Game 3. Buehler had an uninspiring regular season, but he learned to pitch in this postseason without the same fastball that used to bully batters. The Dodgers did him a favor in not making the qualifying offer, though they might re-sign him, anyway. He’s not among the very top free agents in a deep starter’s market, but it says here that whoever lands Buehler will get a gamer who learned a lot about himself in 2024 and will provide the best value on the board. 7. Roki Sasaki should sign with my favorite team. Not the Dodgers. That’s not fair! • Japanese ace Sasaki coming to MLB next season",2024-11-14
MLB News,Soto ... and then? MLB execs pick No. 2 free agent,https://www.mlb.com/news/which-mlb-free-agent-ranks-closest-to-juan-soto,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 01:36:00 GMT",,"Mark Feinsand As Juan Soto begins to meet with suitors in the coming days, there are several free agents who will be watching that situation closely. Such sluggers as Pete Alonso and Anthony Santander will be intrigued to see which clubs strike out on Soto, potentially opening the door for them to be the power bats those clubs need. Ditto for Willy Adames and Alex Bregman, who might not have the same pop as the aforementioned duo but offer more well-rounded skill sets at important defensive positions. Top pitchers, including Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell and Max Fried, also will be interested parties, as the clubs that are unable to sign Soto will have significant dollars left to spend. So while the consensus is that Soto is the top free agent on the market this offseason, which player is the next-best option for clubs seeking a major free-agent upgrade? We posed that question to a number of executives around the league, asking them which player they consider to be No. 2 in the current free-agent class. Note: We eliminated Roki Sasaki from this exercise, as the Japanese starting pitcher is considered an international amateur free agent, which will prevent him from landing a nine-figure contract, a factor that would almost certainly make him the consensus answer -- if not move him ahead of Soto for the No. 1 spot. Who's the second-best free agent in this class, behind Soto?• Corbin Burnes (eight votes)• Willy Adames (five votes)• Blake Snell (two votes)• Max Fried (one vote) Burnes’ place atop the poll demonstrates the clear value of starting pitching around the Majors. “I think it’s so incredibly difficult to get your hands on a frontline starter who has the ability to strike out hitters, keep walks down and who is built to pitch innings,” a National League executive said. “He’s a horse, and he’ll pitch at just 30 years old. So, theoretically, there should be a number of good years ahead of him. “Those guys are really hard to come by -- particularly in today’s game. His ability to eat innings is incredibly valuable.” Burnes’ 816 2/3 innings since the start of the 2020 season rank third in the Majors, behind Zack Wheeler and Aaron Nola, both of whom signed nine-figure contracts in the past year. During the past five seasons, Burnes has a 2.88 ERA and 1.02 WHIP, firmly establishing himself as one of the top starters in the game. “He’s the best starting pitcher out there, with both past success and age on his side,” an NL executive said. “All of the other position players have at least some question marks, so none of them rise up to No. 2.” If there is one concern about Burnes, it’s that his strikeout rate has dropped every year since 2020, when he registered a career-best mark of 36.7%. Last season, Burnes fanned 181 batters in 194 1/3 innings. His 23.1% rate marked his lowest since his 2018 rookie season (23.0%). “I think Burnes is probably next, but the recent results have been very good, not quite great,” an American League executive said. “I still trust him more than Fried or Snell, but all those guys are reasonably close.” Another NL executive cited the strikeout numbers as one reason he chose Snell as his No. 2 behind Soto, though Snell’s lack of draft-pick compensation also helps his case. “Snell positioned himself nicely to land the payday he sought last offseason,” the NL exec said. “Burnes’ declining strikeout rate could make Snell the preferred choice between those two for many clubs.” Snell’s second half (1.45 ERA over 68 1/3 innings in 12 starts) was stellar, though his first half -- marked by injury and inconsistency -- might cause some clubs some concern. Snell falls short of Burnes when it comes to durability, having thrown more than 130 innings only twice in his career. “Burnes has a rare combo in today’s game of durability and impact,” an AL executive said. When Snell is on top of his game, there aren’t many pitchers who perform better. And you can look no further than his two Cy Young Awards as proof. But those are in the past. And as he enters his age-32 season, there appears to be more risk with signing him to a long-term deal than there is with Burnes. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. “Snell can be great; we all know that,” an NL executive said. “But the old saying, ‘The best ability is availability’ is a cliché for a reason. Snell just isn’t always available. And if you’re paying a pitcher $30 million a year, you want to feel confident that he’s going to take the ball 30-plus times every year. That’s why I would go with Burnes.” While 11 of the 16 voters chose a starting pitcher, the five who went with a position player were unanimous in their selection: Adames. The 29-year-old easily tops the list of available shortstops this offseason, a position valued as much for defense as offense. Adames didn’t have a standout season defensively in 2024, but his 26 outs above average since the start of 2022 rank fourth in the Majors among shortstops. “Because of the position he plays and because there are teams that need a shortstop, he’s really valuable,” an AL executive said. “When he played against us, all I could think was, ‘I’d love to have that guy on our team.’” Adames recorded career highs in home runs (32) and RBIs (112) this past season for the Brewers, finishing the year with a personal-best 4.8 fWAR. He has been at least a three-win player in all five of his full seasons in the Majors, playing at least 139 games in each of them. Bregman didn’t receive any votes. Two executives noted that while his career statistics are better than Adames, there has been some offensive decline in recent years. After finishing second in AL MVP voting in 2019 with 41 home runs, 112 RBIs and a 1.015 OPS, Bregman hasn’t come close to those numbers again. He posted a career-low .768 OPS in 2024, with 26 homers and 75 RBIs. “I think they’re very similar today,” an AL executive said. “I’ll take the guy who is 1 1/2 years younger and has played shortstop recently.” Two executives also cited Adames’ reputation as a clubhouse leader, noting that he brings as much to a team off the field as he does between the lines. “He’s so good, and he’s such a good human,” an AL executive said. “If you’re throwing money at someone and you’re going to invest in them, you’re going to get a lot of benefits from him. He plays; he posts every day, and durability is something we don’t always pay for.” Added another AL executive: “Everything I've been told about him, he’s a wonderful teammate who connects with the American players and Latin American players. You put all those things together with what he can do on the field, he’s going to be attractive to a lot of teams. With long-term deals for big money, that’s got to factor in.”",2024-11-14

Since Sasaki is younger than 25 years old and hasn't reached six years of service in a foreign major league, he is subject to MLB's international amateur signing bonus pool rules. He won't get anything close to the $325 million contract that Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto received last offseason. Instead, Sasaki's contract value will be limited to what a team has in its bonus pool. That could be somewhere in the neighborhood of $7 million if Sasaki waits to sign until after Jan. 15, when each team's bonus pool will be refilled for the start of the 2025 international signing period. So, how can Sasaki make more money outside of his contract? Bowden says the answer is simple: endorsements. But therein lies the possible issue with a Sasaki-Dodgers match. ""In Los Angeles, [Sasaki would] be in the shadow of both [Shohei] Ohtani and Yamamoto, which would lessen his endorsement ceiling,"" Bowden wrote. Conversely, if Sasaki signs with a team such as the Padres, not only would he share a clubhouse with his idol, Yu Darvish, the 23-year-old ""could potentially maximize his endorsements in Japan, positioning himself as a rival to the Dodgers’ Ohtani and Yamamoto rather than a teammate of theirs."" Furthermore, a massive contingent of Japanese media cover the Dodgers on a daily basis, and, per Bowden, ""that level of attention is not the best situation for a young, developing pitcher."" The Dodgers are known for being fantastic with how they develop young pitchers. But Bowden points out that teams such as the Padres, Rays, Mets and Braves also have strong pitching development programs, thereby possibly negating any advantage L.A. might have there. ""Based on what I’m hearing,"" Bowden wrote, ""I think the Padres, Rays, Mets and Braves are all more likely to sign Sasaki than the Dodgers -- and several other teams will be in the mix."" Nov. 9: Do the Padres have an edge in the Sasaki sweepstakes?MLB.com's Mark Feinsand lists several favorites to land Sasaki, including the Giants, Yankees, Mets, Blue Jays, Cubs and Rangers. But he writes that the two most likely landing spots, at least according to one NL executive, would be the Dodgers and Padres. An article in The Athletic (subscription required) adds the Phillies as a team to watch and also suggests that the Padres may have an advantage by way of one of their current starters. ""In the case of the Padres, Sasaki is believed to be like many other Japanese pitchers who hold a deep admiration for Yu Darvish,"" the report states. That, coupled with Sasaki's reported preference for West Coast teams, could make the Padres a ""favorite among favorites,"" so to speak. Nov. 9: Sasaki to be posted by Chiba Lotte MarinesSasaki appears headed to the Majors next season. Sasaki, the consensus top young pitcher in Japan, will be posted by the Chiba Lotte Marines of the Nippon Professional Baseball, the team announced. Sasaki, 23, should inspire an all-out pursuit reminiscent of Shohei Ohtani’s initial contract with the Angels, in league-wide interest and financial scope. Ohtani agreed to a $2.315 million signing bonus with the Angels in December 2017. An unfettered market would have yielded a much larger contract, but foreign-born players are subject to international bonus pool money restrictions unless they are at least 25 years of age and have played as a professional in a foreign league recognized by Major League Baseball for a minimum of six seasons. Ohtani was not yet 25 years old when he was posted by the Nippon Ham Fighters, so the Collective Bargaining Agreement classified him as an international amateur. Sasaki falls into the same category now. More >",2024-11-14
MLB News,Where the Blue Jays stand in the Soto sweepstakes,https://www.mlb.com/news/blue-jays-chances-to-sign-juan-soto,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 16:39:32 GMT",,"Keegan Matheson This story was excerpted from Keegan Matheson’s Blue Jays Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. TORONTO -- Oh, yes, we’re doing this again. It’s Juan Soto season in Major League Baseball and the Blue Jays want to dance. Of course they do. It’s Juan Soto. The great heartbreak of Shohei Ohtani an offseason ago has left so many Blue Jays fans hesitant to lean into the madness again -- understandably so -- but the Blue Jays are on the short list of teams with the ownership buy-in and recent spending habits to put them in conversations for players of this caliber. They’re not the old Blue Jays anymore, a big-market team pretending to be from a small town. Having a dollar and spending a dollar are two very different things, though. With ESPN’s Jeff Passan reporting that the Blue Jays will meet with Soto this week, there’s clear interest, but this isn’t about which organization likes Soto the most … It’s about which organization is most willing to do something about it. While many in the industry still view Soto’s free agency as the battle of New York between the Mets and Yankees, there is still an opening for anyone else to step in and make an impression. The head vs. the heartIf the Blue Jays ever get down the road with Soto and generate a level of genuine interest from the young star and his agent, Scott Boras, this is what it will all come down to. Modern front offices are a beehive on information and projections. A good front office doesn’t marry itself to those numbers, though, and knows when to let the reality of their circumstances have a seat at the table. At some point in the Soto negotiations, one team will need to break from their projections and make an emotional decision to say: “Whatever. We want this guy.” That hasn’t always been the Blue Jays’ way of doing business. For nearly the past decade, we’ve seen this front office spend freely and bring in Hyun Jin Ryu, George Springer, Kevin Gausman and Chris Bassitt while also extending José Berríos. Toronto’s big swings have, for the most part, played out well. The Blue Jays lean heavily on their own valuations of players, though -- the result of a thousand meetings that are surely happening while you’re reading this -- and Soto is a player who transcends any typical free-agent approach. The Blue Jays wouldn’t be up against the money of the Mets or the money of the Yankees, they’d be up against more human forces. The pride of the Yankees, who just fell short in the World Series and know they can’t take a step backwards, will likely push them beyond their comfort zone. The aggression of Mets owner Steven Cohen, who has already spent an incredible amount on that roster, could be on full display. It’s New York versus New York, ego versus ego as much as dollar versus dollar. Are the Blue Jays really going to be the team that, in the home stretch of these negotiations, chooses to break away from the pack? Will the disappointment of eight seasons without a postseason win be enough to force this front office to break away from what we’ve seen and do something bolder? What it would look likeWe just saw what it looked like with Soto batting in front of Aaron Judge. Imagine the same with Vladimir Guerrero Jr. It’s a terrifying thought for pitchers. The baseball side is obvious. Soto is on a Hall of Fame track, a truly elite hitter who has looked just as dominant in the postseason. He would instantly -- all by himself -- turn the Blue Jays into a legitimate contender in 2025, but any conversation involving Soto requires a broader view of what this would mean to the organization. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. As it stands today, the Blue Jays have an off-ramp available to them after 2025 and an even clearer one after 2026. With Guerrero and Bo Bichette due to hit free agency after this coming season and others the year after, including Gausman and potentially Berrios (opt-out), there’s a world in which the Blue Jays take a step back and retool if things don’t go well. Landing Soto -- or, much more realistically, extending Guerrero -- suddenly flings that window back open. If the Blue Jays spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a superstar, that represents a commitment to spending similar dollars or even more in the years to come. It would be a fresh start of sorts, or a reset, for the entire franchise.",2024-11-14
MLB News,Dave Sims will follow Sterling as Yanks radio voice,https://www.mlb.com/news/dave-sims-john-sterling-yankees-radio-play-by-play,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 23:51:00 GMT",,"Bryan Hoch NEW YORK – Dave Sims stood in front of the visiting dugout at Seattle’s T-Mobile Park two months ago, watching the Yankees take batting practice ahead of a game against the Mariners. His career has been built upon the delivery of words, but at this moment, the veteran broadcaster felt it wasn’t appropriate to say much. Yes, he acknowledged that he’d heard the rumors mentioning his name in recent weeks, and sure, he would be interested in the Yankees radio play-by-play position if it were offered to him. Then there was this: while Sims loves Seattle, as he repeated several times, New York would always represent home. A post shared by Dave Sims (@tdss) Now Sims is on his way back. He has a multiyear agreement to become WFAN’s new play-by-play broadcaster for Yankees games, replacing John Sterling, who retired early in 2024 before returning for the playoffs, the team announced on Thursday. A Philadelphia native, the 71-year-old Sims has been one of the Mariners’ primary television voices since 2007. He is familiar to sports fans for calling Major League Baseball and college basketball games on ESPN, as well as NCAA basketball and NFL play-by-play on Westwood One. “THE DREAM LIVES!

MLB News,Red Sox sign veteran lefty reliever Justin Wilson to 1-year deal,https://www.mlb.com/news/justin-wilson-red-sox-deal,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 21:12:00 GMT",,"Ian Browne BOSTON – While the Red Sox woo free agent Juan Soto and pursue a trade for White Sox ace Garrett Crochet, they were able to make a complementary move on Thursday by finalizing a one-year contract with lefty reliever Justin Wilson. The veteran will earn $2.25 million, a source told MLB.com, but the club has not confirmed the value of the deal. Adding Wilson is the first step by chief baseball officer Craig Breslow in what is expected to be a significant revamping of the bullpen this winter. Closer Kenley Jansen and ace setup man Chris Martin are both free agents. Jansen isn’t in the club’s plans going forward, and it’s unclear whether the club will try to retain Martin. Boston struggled from the left side of the bullpen in ’24, but for next year, Wilson joins Brennan Bernardino as manager Alex Cora's options. Wilson pitched for the Reds last season, notching a 5.59 ERA in 60 outings. In 46 2/3 innings, Wilson gave up 55 hits and 13 walks while striking out 51. It was a comeback season for Wilson, who missed most of ’22 and all of ’23 following Tommy John surgery. Wilson fared better against righties (.754 OPS) than lefties (.919 OPS) last season. In his career, Wilson’s splits are fairly neutral, as he’s held lefties to a .251 average and .704 OPS and righties to a .220 average and .650 OPS. In a career that has also included stops in Pittsburgh, New York (Yankees and Mets), Detroit and Chicago (Cubs), the 37-year-old Wilson is 34-29 with a 3.61 ERA and 20 saves. All 587 of his appearances have been out of the bullpen. Per Statcast, Wilson’s best attribute in ’24 was inducing a 33.8 percent chase rate, which put him in the 95th percentile. The #RedSox today announced that they have added Chris Holt to the Major League coaching staff as Bullpen Coach. pic.twitter.com/tV7erIJDA1 In other news, the Red Sox announced the hiring of Chris Holt as their new bullpen coach.

MLB News,Report on Sasaki? 'Probably one of the greatest pitchers I’ve ever seen live',https://www.mlb.com/news/roki-sasaki-scouting-report,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 01:00:00 GMT",,"Jonathan Mayo Roki Sasaki burst onto the scene in Japan as a 19-year-old in 2021, posting a 1.84 ERA over 16 starts. He bounded onto the world stage when he joined a star-studded Japanese rotation that included Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto in the 2023 World Baseball Classic. Now it looks like he’ll get the chance to join them in the Major Leagues in 2025. While teams will try to position themselves to be the best suitor for the right-hander, Sasaki will not be making his choice solely based on up-front money. Like Ohtani in 2017, because he’s under 25, his signing is subject to international bonus pool rules and will count against a team’s international bonus pool. So all 30 teams are limited in what they can offer. Beyond the eye-popping numbers (2.02 ERA, 11.4 K/9, 2.0 BB/9, 6.0 H/9 over four seasons), what exactly will teams entering the Sasaki sweepstakes be vying for? Let’s take a deeper look: The scouting reportThe 6-foot-3 Sasaki will pitch all of the 2025 season at age 23 and is more than three years younger than Yamamoto, around the same age as Ohtani was when he made his big league debut. He’s been scouted continuously since he made his NPB debut in 2021 and especially since his World Baseball Classic coming-out party, with international scouting departments wanting to make sure they were ready when the right-hander was posted. “He’s as good as advertised,” one international scouting director said. “He has an ideal projectable, lean and athletic frame. He has excellent arm action and delivery, with three plus power pitches with control over command. He has No. 1 upside.” Throwing out that “No. 1” label is not something scouts do freely, but that director was not the only one to do so. “In my opinion, he’s a top-end starter,” another director said. “I wouldn’t say he’s Ohtani, but from a pitching standpoint, it’s very comparative. I’ve been seeing him since he was 19, and saw him on the national team. It’s an explosive arm.” “He reminds me of Noah Syndergaard when he was fresh,” a third international scout said. FastballIt’s at least a 70 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale, and depending on when you saw it, it might get the rarely spotted 80. It’s been up to 102 mph in the past and averaged 98.8 mph (96-100 more often than not) in '23 with some armside run. In 2024, it averaged 96.8 mph (95-99 most of the time). Some evaluators said it was a little straighter than the previous year, perhaps a reason why it missed fewer bats (13.1 percent whiff rate vs. 24.0 pct in '23), but as long as there are no lasting injury concerns, this isn’t too much of a worry. More on Sasaki: SplitterThis is the “national pitch” according to James Dykstra, a former White Sox draftee who had as good a view of it as anyone last year while pitching for the Chibo Latte Marines alongside Sasaki. Dykstra came out of the San Diego area high school powerhouse Rancho Bernardo High School and was drafted three times, eventually joining the White Sox as a sixth-rounder in 2013. He reached Triple-A and spent time in Mexico and indy ball before heading to Japan to pitch for the Marines this past season. Arriving in Japan armed with a splitter of his own, Dykstra couldn’t wait to see Sasaki’s up close after seeing how filthy it was during the World Baseball Classic. “I stood behind the catcher in his bullpen early in Spring Training and said ‘Oh my!’"" Dykstra said. “I knew how good it was in the World Baseball Classic and it even exceeded my expectations. It’s probably one of the best splitters I’ve ever seen.” The data backs up his eyewitness report. Throwing the pitch in the 88-90 mph range, Sasaki kills spin with it, and it comes out of his hand looking like his heater until it falls off the table. It produced an absurd 57.1 percent whiff rate in '24. The Major League average whiff rate on the splitter this past season was 34.5 percent. Sasaki would have placed second among all big league pitchers in this category with a minimum of 100 swings on splitters: Fernando Cruz (CIN): 59.3%Roki Sasaki (NPB): 57.1%Mark Leiter Jr. (NYY): 56.5%Justin Martinez (AZ): 54.0%Reed Garrett (NYM): 51.1% Dykstra had to hearken back to his days with Chicago to remember the last time he was so impressed with a secondary offering. “The only other time I’ve been in a bullpen and was mind-blown, I was with the White Sox and I watched a Chris Sale slider from behind the catcher,” he said. SliderThis is Sasaki’s “third” pitch but some scouts grade it out as above-average, if not plus. Even though it also was down a tick or two this past season, Sasaki still missed bats with it at a 40.7 percent rate, throwing it in the 83-85 mph range. In '23, his breaking ball elicited a whiff rate of 48.6 percent and was typically an upper-80s offering, more consistently getting plus grades.

Sasaki's 2024 metrics: Sasaki's 2023 metrics: ConclusionWhile teams may have questions about Sasaki’s small downtick in velocity, it certainly won’t keep any team from being interested. He is, after all, a starter who finished last season with a 2.35 ERA, 10.5 K/9 and 2.6 BB/9 rates at age 22. It’s agreed that once posted, Sasaki would become the top international prospect in his class, whether it’s '24 or 2025. As one scout pointed out, he’s much more of a sure thing compared to the teenagers currently on the 2025 Top 50 international prospects list, someone who will be expected to step into a big league rotation, if not lead it, on Opening Day 2025. How much would a pitcher like that warrant on an open market if he didn’t fall under the international bonus pool spending rules? “A lot,” one international scouting director said. That director declined to define “a lot,” but keeping Yamamoto’s 12-year, $325 million deal with the Dodgers in mind, another scouting executive tried to find some parameters. “I think it would be $275-300 million if he was in an open market, for 10 years -- that’s what I would think he’d get,” he said. “The sky is the limit for this guy.” Dykstra, for one, agrees. “It’s well known his talent is pretty much unmatched,” he said, adding that Sasaki was a tremendous teammate who worked hard on his English and his craft on the mound. ""I came back from watching that bullpen and said, 'this is probably one of the greatest pitchers I’ve ever seen live.' “Every time he pitched was more and more impressive. I can’t think of a single person that has this much raw talent.”",2024-11-14
MLB News,"The top 10 free-agent starters, ranked",https://www.mlb.com/news/free-agent-starting-pitcher-power-rankings-2024-2025,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 03:44:03 GMT",An offseason edition of Starting Pitcher Power Rankings,"Andrew Simon This is an opportune offseason to be in search of rotation help. Many of the most coveted free agents available are starting pitchers, and that group was bolstered further by the recent news that the top pitcher in Japan is going to be posted. But how exactly do all of these talented arms stack up? To answer that question, we turned to our MLB.com panel to vote on one final 2024 edition of the Starting Pitcher Power Rankings. This one focuses only on free agents. Here is a look at the results, with each pitcher listed alongside his final 2024 team. 1. Corbin Burnes, OriolesBurnes presents an interesting case. In the big picture, he has four straight All-Star selections and almost certainly is headed for a fifth straight top-10 Cy Young Award finish, including his win in 2021. The 30-year-old has thrown more than 190 innings with an ERA+ of better than 125 for three straight seasons. On the other hand, his strikeout and whiff rates have plummeted from their elite peaks in 2021-22. This past season, Burnes' 23.1% K rate was only 29th out of 58 qualified pitchers. That could give some teams cause for concern before handing out a long-term deal, but Burnes has been so effective that he still stands atop this class. 2. Roki Sasaki, Chiba Lotte Marines (NPB)Why will Sasaki be so hotly pursued by MLB teams once his posting window officially opens? Just imagine if someone like NL Rookie of the Year favorite Paul Skenes was suddenly made available to any bidder. Sasaki, who turned 23 on Nov. 3, is only seven months older than Skenes, and like the Pirates right-hander, has top-of-the-charts, power stuff. Like Shohei Ohtani in 2017, Sasaki is subject to international bonus pool money restrictions, which means that any team signing him will do so while making a relatively minimal financial commitment. There are certainly risks here, especially in terms of health and durability, but Sasaki’s potential is easily the highest of anyone available this offseason, other than Juan Soto. 3. Blake Snell, GiantsSnell’s first foray into free agency didn’t go as planned. Despite coming off his second Cy Young Award in 2023, the lefty languished on the market until mid-March before finally signing with the Giants on a one-year deal with a player option for 2025. Expect Snell to do better this time around after exercising his opt-out clause. While his late start this past season seemed to hinder him initially, Snell was virtually unhittable for the last three months of the season, posting a 1.23 ERA and 1.77 FIP across 14 starts, which included a no-hitter on Aug. 2 at Cincinnati. Opponents hit a meager .123/.211/.171 against him over that span. Snell is always going to face some questions about his durability and high walk rates, but at his best, he’s as dominant as anyone. 4. Max Fried, BravesHere’s a stat that might surprise you: Among the 67 pitchers who have thrown at least 500 innings over the past five seasons, Fried sports easily the best ERA+ (151), well ahead of Burnes and Zack Wheeler (141). Of course, Fried is only 25th in innings and 34th in strikeout rate among that group, which perhaps explains him ranking outside the top three on this list. Fried has never blown away hitters with velocity or missed a ton of bats, but when it comes to keeping runs off the board, he has been consistently excellent. How? He avoids hard contact as well as anyone and keeps the ball on the ground and in the ballpark. 5. Jack Flaherty, DodgersLike Fried, Flaherty is a product of Harvard-Westlake High School in Southern California. Unlike Fried, consistency has not been his calling card. Even during the Dodgers’ 2024 championship run, Flaherty had two excellent playoff starts, two disastrous starts and one in between. That was representative of a highly talented pitcher who has battled injuries and significant fluctuations in both stuff and results since arriving in the big leagues. The good news for Flaherty -- and the righty’s next team -- is that he’s a bit on the younger side for a free agent (having just turned 29 in October), has mostly stayed healthy for two straight seasons and was quite effective in 2024. Flaherty looks like one of the riskier options on this list, but the potential rewards should still generate a robust market. 6. Sean Manaea, MetsIn mid-June, there was little reason to think Manaea would be anywhere close to this spot. The 32-year-old lefty, coming off a couple of underwhelming seasons with the Padres and Giants, had a 4.30 ERA over his first 12 outings with the Mets. From there, though, Manaea went 9-3 with a 3.05 ERA and more than a strikeout per inning over his final 20 outings, before making three solid postseason starts. Along the way, with Chris Sale as inspiration, the 6-foot-5 Manaea dropped his release point, to great effect. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. 7. Walker Buehler, DodgersFollowing a lengthy rehab from his second Tommy John surgery, Buehler struggled mightily to rediscover his form in 2024. The numbers were ugly: 16 starts with a 5.38 ERA, 5.54 FIP and .862 opponent OPS. This looked nothing like the pitcher who was one of the best in baseball from 2018-21, culminating in a fourth-place NL Cy Young Award finish. But, at long last, signs of that pitcher re-emerged during the postseason, just in time to help the Dodgers secure a World Series title. Was that a blip? Or a sign that Buehler is back? That’s the question teams will have to answer this offseason. 8. Yusei Kikuchi, AstrosOver six MLB seasons since making the move from NPB, Kikuchi has been unable to put it all together for an extended period of time. The left-hander has shown plenty of flashes, but consistent success has eluded him, leading to roughly league-average production (a 4.28 ERA and 96 ERA+ over 601 innings since 2021). The glass-half-full view is that Kikuchi might have found a winning formula after the Blue Jays dealt him to Houston at the Trade Deadline, posting a 2.70 ERA and 3.07 FIP in 10 starts down the stretch while dramatically ramping up his slider usage at the expense of his four-seam fastball. 9. Nathan Eovaldi, RangersDespite the fact that he will turn 35 before next season, Eovaldi opted out of his contract, passing up a $20 million guarantee in 2025. It’s not hard to understand why. Eovaldi still throws in the mid-90s, with two swing-and-miss secondary pitches in his splitter and curveball, helping him consistently post excellent chase and walk rates. He now has strung together five consecutive seasons with an ERA under 4.00 and an ERA+ over 100, and he’s a proven postseason performer. It would be no surprise to see Eovaldi land a solid multi-year deal. 10. Shane Bieber, GuardiansWhichever team signs Bieber will do so knowing that the 29-year-old righty is still working his way back from the Tommy John surgery he underwent in April. That adds plenty of uncertainty to the mix here, but also an opportunity to add a star-caliber pitcher to their rotation on a short-term commitment. Bieber was one of MLB’s top starters from 2019-22, winning the AL Cy Young Award in ‘20, and after a relatively subpar ‘23 campaign, he looked fantastic out of the gate this past season before tearing his UCL. Assuming Bieber comes back strong, he has a chance to re-enter the market as a clear ace in a year or two.

MLB News,White Sox hire Fuller from Orioles as hitting director,https://www.mlb.com/news/white-sox-ryan-fuller-director-of-hitting,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 23:38:54 GMT",,"Scott Merkin CHICAGO -- Ryan Fuller can draw from all his past coaching experiences with Baltimore as the new White Sox director of hitting, with his hiring officially announced on Thursday afternoon. Fuller, 34, served as co-hitting coach over the past three seasons for the power-packed Orioles. He was Baltimore’s full-season hitting coordinator and Double-A Bowie hitting coach for the 2021 season, and originally joined the Orioles as the Single-A Delmarva hitting coach prior to the 2020 campaign. In this newly created White Sox position, Fuller oversees all aspects of hitting throughout the organization. He’ll work with the hitting coaches at the Major League level and within the Minor Leagues, as well as the players. Offseason planning already has begun via Fuller having talks with Marcus Thames, who returns for his second year as White Sox hitting coach. “It's key for these guys to develop relationships,” Fuller said concerning the importance of Thames returning in his role from 2024. “We've been on Zoom calls virtually every day, talking to each other, asking a lot of questions: 'What's going on? What can we make improvements to? How can I support you even more?' “Both of us talking about experiences working with really high-level hitters, talking about what we can do as we look toward the player plan for the White Sox hitters going into 2025. It's been great so far. We match up really well, and it's been a great working relationship."" This position for Fuller is akin to the one held by Brian Bannister, who took over as the White Sox senior advisor to pitching on Sept. 22, 2023. Fuller has spoken to Bannister about how he’s gone about things with the White Sox but also about his past experience as a director. pic.twitter.com/PB6h0UN3JF White Sox pitching presently is well ahead of the offensive side, at the Major League and Minor League levels. The White Sox finished last in everything from home runs (133) to runs scored (507) to batting average (.221) to on-base percentage (.278) as part of their 121-loss season in 2024. Of their Top 9 prospects, per MLB Pipeline, three are on the position-player side in shortstop Colson Montgomery (No. 3), catcher Edgar Quero (No. 4) and 18-year-old outfielder George Wolkow at No. 7. So, Fuller has work to do, but he has ideas for improvement and success, as well as a synergistic message delivered throughout hitting but also to research and development and the strength staff. “We are excited to reach out to the players in the next couple of weeks to give them the offseason training goals and plans, and after that, certainly touch base with them,” Fuller said. “That’s part of being a hitting guy, getting those messages from the guys with their swings, seeing video of them working out. And I know Marcus has a plan to go out and see hitters this offseason. [I'm] excited to be a part of that and develop those relationships.” “He’s going to help on the acquisition front -- whether it be this offseason on free-agent acquisitions or trade acquisitions -- and going to help Marcus and other coaches throughout the organization put together game plans and development plans for our players,” general manager Chris Getz said of Fuller. “We know it’s a tall task to take on hitting. But we certainly know we’re an organization that needs help, and we felt like we found someone that could really supplement and help lead us to a better position for future success.” Fuller wants to equip the players with skills, plans and training to “level up” through their work. In explaining that concept, Fuller went with a video game reference. “When you play video games, you start at Level 1 and when you beat the Level 1 boss, you go to Level 2. You don’t jump to Level 30 right away,” Fuller said. “It’s going to have that feel of making sure these guys are building their skill every day. As we are building that skill, we are going to look to problem-solve.

MLB News,You can't turn down a baseball card-themed invite to Bobby Witt Jr.'s wedding,https://www.mlb.com/news/angels-logan-britt-bobby-witt-jr-best-man-topps-card,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 05:18:28 GMT",,"Jesse Borek MESA, Ariz. -- Three years into his Major League career, Bobby Witt Jr. has already had 2,035 regular-season plate appearances. That’s a lot of chances to make an impression. But when it comes to your wedding, you only get one chance to hit it out of the park. More on the Arizona Fall League:• Complete coverage | Schedule | Tickets | Teams | Shop With the AL MVP finalist set to tie the knot with fiancée Maggie Black on Dec. 14 in Texas, he sent out epic baseball card-themed invitations to his side of the wedding party. Royals teammate MJ Melendez gave the baseball world a glimpse into the intricate design. A post shared by PULLWAX SPORTS CARDS (@pullwax) But as any member of a wedding party knows, when you want the details, go straight to the best man -- Angels prospect Logan Britt. “It was pretty sick because I saw MJ Melendez’s card and he had a picture of them playing in Kansas City,” Britt said of his reaction to the cards. “Ours was actually a photo taken in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, when we were 13. I'm sitting on a bucket and he's sitting next to me. He's got the mullet rocking back in the day, so that was pretty funny.” Much like Witt’s dedication to his mullet, his bond with Britt hasn’t wavered. The two met as youngsters on the hyper-competitive Texas baseball scene, with the Witt family offering a young Britt a spot on a travel ball tournament roster in Florida. “I got to go on a family vacation with his family to the Bahamas and we've been friends ever since,” Britt said. “Just a nutty, super humble, great guy to be around. He's just a goofball and he's a friend I'll have for life.” More from MLB Pipeline:• Top 100 prospects | Stats | Video | Podcast | Complete coverage It’s fitting that the two first bonded in the Bahamas, since Witt brought his group there for his bachelor party. Britt got to meet many of the groomsmen -- Nick Pratto, Vinnie Pasquantino, Kyle Isbel, Melendez -- during a previous visit to Kansas City to see Witt a few years back, but this was their first chance to unwind and bond before the nuptials. The wedding party also includes Witt’s three brothers-in-law, all of whom are former big leaguers -- Zach Neal, James Russell and Cody Thomas -- and another player with a Colleyville (Texas) High School connection: the Braves’ AJ Smith-Shawver. Kansas City chose Witt second overall out of Colleyville in 2019, with Britt going as a 35th-round choice of the White Sox due to his strong commitment to Texas A&M. (He chose not to sign with Chicago.) Smith-Shawver, the club’s No. 2 prospect and No. 97 overall, was a seventh-round pick of Atlanta in 2021. Despite the rigors that pro ball creates, Witt and Britt have been able to stay in close contact throughout the years. They still live about half an hour from one another in Texas during the offseason. Witt’s Minor League career was short-lived as he skyrocketed through the Royals system. Britt eventually transferred to Abilene Christian, where he starred offensively, but hung up his bat for the pitcher’s mound when the Angels selected him in the 17th round of the 2023 Draft. The 24-year-old outfielder-turned-hurler is getting extra time to hone his craft in the Arizona Fall League, with eyes on one day joining Witt up at the game’s highest level. “I think it's been great for us,” Britt said. “We both kind of went different directions -- he went pro ball, I went to college, so we were both playing baseball. I think the offseason is good for us. We get to just be boys again -- play golf, mess around, do whatever.”",2024-11-14
MLB News,"Angels continue bustling offseason, agree to deal with Newman",https://www.mlb.com/news/angels-agree-to-deal-with-kevin-newman,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 22:44:00 GMT",,"Rhett Bollinger ANAHEIM -- With starting shortstop Zach Neto possibly missing the start of the 2024 season after undergoing right shoulder surgery last week, the Angels made yet another move to improve their infield depth on Thursday, agreeing to terms with infielder Kevin Newman. The contract is for one year and $2.5 million, and has an option for $2.5 million or a $250,000 buyout for '26. Newman, 31, is coming off a solid year in a utility role with the D-backs, slashing .287/.311/.375 with three homers, 17 doubles and eight stolen bases in 111 games. He saw action at all four infield positions, including 55 games at short and 44 at second, as well as an appearance in left field. Newman could fill in as the club’s starting shortstop to open the season if Neto isn’t ready to return and he provides depth with fellow infielders Luis Rengifo and Anthony Rendon both coming off injuries. Catcher Matt Thaiss was designated for assignment to make room for Newman on the roster. “We have some infielders that have had some health things in the past and are currently going through some things,” Angels general manager Perry Minasian said. “Middle infield depth, in general, is very hard to acquire, especially in this market, and we took a look at it, and we felt like this was one of the better players for us. He can move around, play both short and second, can move to third, can play some first. It's a good baseball player.” Newman holds a career .262/.305/.360 slash line in parts of seven seasons with the Pirates, Reds and D-backs. The former 2015 first-round pick’s best year was in 2019, when he slashed .308/.353./.446 with 12 homers and 20 doubles in 130 games. He’s considered a strong defender up the middle at both shortstop and second base. OFFICIAL: The Angels have agreed to a one-year contract with INF Kevin Newman. pic.twitter.com/7TBUReRlzm “He’s very good at second and is solid at short,” Minasian said. “He fits with currently how we're built and with what we currently have. He's somebody that's going to help us in a lot of different ways” It's also a return to Southern California for Newman, who attended Poway High School north of San Diego and 85 miles south of Angel Stadium. Newman is the third infielder added by the Angels this offseason, joining fellow utilityman Scott Kingery, who was acquired in a trade with the Phillies, and first baseman/outfielder Ryan Noda, who was picked up on waivers from the A’s. The Angels also traded for slugger Jorge Soler from the Braves, signed right-hander Kyle Hendricks to a one-year deal worth $3.5 million and inked catcher Travis d’Arnaud to a two-year, $12 million pact. Minasian wouldn’t rule out acquiring another infielder. The Angels could use another player who can handle third, as Rendon has been injury-prone and is coming off a rough year offensively. “I wouldn't rule anything out,” Minasian said. “It’s tough to find guys that can play on the dirt. We’ll continue to sift through things from a market standpoint, from a free agency standpoint. We definitely want to continue to improve.” Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. It’s clear the Angels are being aggressive in improving their overall depth heading into next year. They’re still in the market for another starting pitcher and relief help, and the club could use another bat. Coming off a 99-loss season, Minasian has said the team needs help everywhere and he’s been busy early this offseason. “Every area is up for grabs,” Minasian said. “There is not an area on this team where I'd say, ‘Hey, we're ready. We're perfect. We feel great.’ We'll look at every area and see if we can improve.” Minasian added it was tough to designate Thaiss, but the Angels signed d’Arnaud to be their backup to Logan O’Hoppe and Thaiss is out of options. He said they could be in the market for a third catcher with Minor League options if Thaiss is lost via waivers or trade. “We obviously made the move for d’Arnaud a couple days ago and we took our time and really thought about it,” Minasian said. “We basically went through the roster and so on. We just thought this was the best thing to do. Matt’s an outstanding individual, outstanding human being and a hard worker.”",2024-11-14
MLB News,No team needs a big winter more than Boston,https://www.mlb.com/news/red-sox-need-to-make-a-splash-in-2024-25-offseason,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:05:13 GMT",,"Mike Lupica Occasionally, but only occasionally, you can win the offseason in baseball and then go on to win the real one. The Dodgers just did that. They won the last offseason when they signed Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto. And even though Ohtani had a bum shoulder at the very end, Yamamoto won them two postseason games -- one in the World Series -- and the Dodgers finally won it all. Now, less than a month after the Dodgers closed out the Yankees at Yankee Stadium, we wait to see which team is going to have the best offseason this time -- one that might help take the title away from the Dodgers, unless Los Angeles steps up to the plate and swings for the fences like Ohtani all over again. But a better question might be this: Which team needs to have a big offseason the most? You know the Yankees, trying to keep Juan Soto, want it to be them after finally making it back to the World Series for the first time since 2009. The Mets, who also are set to meet with Soto, sure want it to be them, because they’re in the same league as the Dodgers, and they just played them a lot tougher in the National League Championship Series than the Yankees eventually did. The Phillies, knocked off by the Mets in what they once thought was finally going to be their year, want to show that their window as a Series contender isn’t closing. The Astros, who had played in seven straight American League Championship Series, want to show that the Tigers upsetting them in the Wild Card Series was a fluke. The Padres, who have been knocking on the door for a while and have shown they’re not afraid to take big swings, finally want to knock that door down. The Orioles, with all that young talent, finally want to do something with it at playoff time. But there is no team, not one, that needs to have a game-changing offseason than the Red Sox do, just because their last World Series -- the fourth for them in this century and the fourth in 15 seasons at the time -- in 2018 is starting to feel to an increasingly ornery Red Sox Nation like a long time ago, especially since the star of that team, Mookie Betts, keeps winning rings with the Dodgers after Boston traded him a year and a half after its last title. That happens to be the biggest reason of all why they need Soto every bit as much -- and perhaps even more -- than either the Yankees and Mets do, as owners Hal Steinbrenner and Steve Cohen set themselves up for their own Subway Series. Have Sox fans been spoiled by everything that has happened since October 2004, when they came from 0-3 down in the ALCS against the Yankees to change their history and change baseball history? They have. It is difficult to believe sometimes that it was just three years ago -- October 2021 -- that the Sox were two games to one ahead of the Astros in the ALCS and were that close to making it back to the Series until they stopped hitting, became one more postseason team that didn’t start hitting again until the following spring. Then the Sox finished last. And they finished last again. This past year, they managed to get back to third place in the AL East with a record of 81-81. And other than a midseason run that started with a series win over the Yankees at Fenway Park in June, they still ended up five games behind the Tigers and Royals for a Wild Card spot and 10 behind the Orioles. Here is what manager Alex Cora said when the season was over: “I truly believe this is the last struggle. I do believe we’re going to turn the corner in the offseason.” The Red Sox have to turn that corner, as a serious contender and with their fanbase, if they are serious players for Soto. What they might want to consider, when they do have their meeting with Soto and his agent, Scott Boras, is to bring David Ortiz with them. The Yankees always sell winning, of course. Ortiz, who was the greatest star of three World Series-winning teams in Boston, has known as much about winning in the 21st century as anybody in baseball. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Do the Red Sox need pitching, both starting pitching and relief pitching? They do. Does Soto alone move them past the Orioles and past the Yankees in their division? He does not. But what he does do is send the message to Red Sox fans that they mean the business of winning another World Series. And what is more of a blessing for Red Sox fans than doing something this dramatic to help their team and hurt the New York Yankees? Are the Red Sox a longshot here? They probably are. But it was just over 20 years ago that they acquired a young left-handed hitter from the Dominican named Ortiz, who really did change their history and baseball history. This is their chance to do it again with another star out of the Dominican. Ortiz only cost $1.25 million at the time. Soto will cost a lot more than that. But at this particular time in Red Sox history, he just might be worth it.",2024-11-14
MLB News,Making the case for (and against) each of Juan Soto's main suitors,https://www.mlb.com/news/juan-soto-free-agency-rumors-favorites-to-sign-him,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 03:41:09 GMT",,"MLB.com Juan Soto, the most coveted and high-profile free agent on the market this offseason, is reportedly scheduled to meet this week with the Yankees, Mets, Red Sox and Blue Jays. While it’s certain these four clubs will not be the only ones pursuing Soto – so far, he hasn’t tipped his hand, if he has a favorite – they’re likely to be among a small group with a realistic chance to sign him. MLB.com examined the case for and against each: Which team has the edge right now? Why? Mark Feinsand, senior national reporter: The Mets. I put them at a 51-49% favorite over the Yankees, mainly because financially, they are able to keep up with, or bypass, the other potential big spenders. The Yankees are certainly right there, and if the offers wind up being close, I could see Soto choosing to stay in the Bronx to hit next to Aaron Judge for the next seven years. It’s difficult for me to see any other team doing enough to pry Soto out of New York, but that doesn’t mean the Red Sox, Blue Jays, etc., won’t give it a try. Bryan Hoch, Yankees beat reporter: Considering no team has made an official monetary offer yet, I’ll say it’s the Yankees, just based upon that he’s days removed from playing in a World Series game for them. He played his postgame comments with surgical precision after Game 5, making sure that the world knew he enjoyed his time with the Yankees, with Aaron Judge, Aaron Boone, everyone — but that his door would be open to all 30 teams. Soto knows what a 162-game season in the Bronx looks like, sounds like, feels like … and even more importantly, what the postseason was, and can be again. The Yankees have every reason in the world to dig deep and keep him. Anthony DiComo, Mets beat reporter: I think it's the Mets. I just see them as highly motivated to land a generational-type star, which makes me think they won't be outbid. And if that's true – if they really do refuse to get outbid – then does anyone really believe Soto will go elsewhere? Ian Browne, Red Sox beat reporter: Everyone around baseball is saying the Mets, which makes me think it won’t be the Mets. I’m going to keep him in the Bronx. In one year of Soto joining forces with Aaron Judge, the Yankees went from out of the playoffs in ‘23 to the World Series in ‘24. My guess is that [general manager] Brian Cashman wants to keep this modern-day Mickey Mantle/Roger Maris duo together for the coming years. Keegan Matheson, Blue Jays beat reporter: The Mets. They just got a taste of the NLCS and watched while Soto took the team across town to the World Series. If this comes down to New York vs. New York, as many in the industry expect, I’m betting on a motivated Steve Cohen. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Teams will be making their best pitch to Soto. How will they sell him on their team? The case for: Yankees: Listen, Juan, you just lived it. You had the best offensive season of your career, highlighted by a Silver Slugger, a likely top-three MVP finish and a World Series appearance. Maybe even more importantly, you know that New York loves you already — hey, that guy wasn’t out in the right-field seats carrying an oversized blank check for his health. Stay in the Bronx long-term, and you’ll hit in front of Judge again for years. You’ll hit in Yankee Stadium 81 times a year. You and Judge can chase championships together, wind up in Monument Park together and go into Cooperstown with Yankees logos on your caps. The marketing opportunities will be endless, too. What else do you need? – Hoch Mets: It's two-fold. One is the aforementioned money and their willingness to spend it. Two is the fact that they can suddenly make a really nice case about their organizational direction and ability to win. They can sell Soto like this: We'll pay you the most and also give you one of the best chances to win. … And by the way, in New York, you can continue to be an absolute alpha star. – DiComo Red Sox: The Dominican Republic native has a pretty good idea of how special a place Boston was to countrymen David Ortiz, Pedro Martinez and Manny Ramirez, though the latter certainly had some ups and downs. When the Red Sox are winning, there is no better place for a star to play, given the fervor of the fanbase. Surely, Ortiz and Martinez will try to sell Soto on this. Also, the Red Sox, after being conservative with payroll the last three seasons as they built up their young core at the Major League level and the farm system, seem ready to shell out money again for a transformational player, which Soto certainly is. – Browne Blue Jays: Signings like George Springer, Kevin Gausman and the José Berríos extension show the Blue Jays aren’t afraid to spend, but Soto will cost more than all three of those contracts combined. The Blue Jays will need to convince Soto that they’ll continue to build -- and spend -- around him for the next decade-plus. Once you get another taste of the World Series with the Yankees, why sign with the team that just finished last place in your division unless you truly believe brighter days are ahead? If the Blue Jays have any shot at Soto, it has to involve Vladimir Guerrero Jr. … First at the pitch meeting, then receiving an extension of his own. – Matheson The case against – if the money is all the same, what could make Soto decide to sign elsewhere? Yankees: I don’t believe there is a scenario where the Yankees have the top bid, or match a top bid, and Soto goes elsewhere. It may well be that Soto and [agent] Scott Boras are looking to grab every dollar on the table, and if that’s the case, there is a good chance the Yankees do not have the highest bid. Hal Steinbrenner has said that he doesn’t want to have a payroll above $300 million, calling it “unsustainable” for the franchise long-term, and industry folks say that is no bluff. Now, here’s a thought for you: The Yanks did not have the high bid for Judge, far from it. They had to match the second-place bid from the Giants to keep him; Soto isn’t offering any similar hometown discounts, at least not to the Yankees. – Hoch Mets: Maybe he really does love the Yankees and values re-signing there more than coming to Queens. Maybe the Dodgers get involved and he wants to be part of a super-team. If the money is all the same, lifestyle factors come into play, and that's an area in which the Mets – see: Yamamoto, Yoshinobu – haven't always fared well. – DiComo Red Sox: Soto might wind up loving Boston. But he already knows how much he enjoys New York after playing there for a year. This could give the Yankees and Mets an edge over the Red Sox if the money winds up being relatively equal. While the Red Sox are confident they’re ready to start winning again, Soto might be more skeptical about it given the team’s absence in October the past three years. – Browne Blue Jays: The Blue Jays are coming off a 74-88 season. Their internal optimism isn’t going to woo one of the biggest free agents in MLB history, but this gets even more difficult when Soto or any other top-end option looks at the Blue Jays’ immediate future. Will Vladdy stay in Toronto beyond 2025? If not, will money be spent to pair Soto with other legitimate stars? This could eventually reach a point where one team involved needs to tear up its projections and valuations and decide to blow everyone else out of the water entirely to get their guy. Is that really a move you’d expect to see from the Blue Jays’ front office? – Matheson",2024-11-14

If the Mets miss out on Soto, their pivot could be a windfall for other highly touted free agents.","The 2024 New York Mets were a whirlwind, an exhausting, exhilarating thrill ride of improbability. They were a ragtag group of well-paid misfits, with the magic of an anthropomorphic purple blob and a Latin pop earworm. The Mets rode the good vibes all the way to the NLCS. An MVP runner-up campaign from shortstop Francisco Lindor helped too. Here are the five main questions that will shape what’s sure to be a fascinating and active winter in Queens. Mets owner Steve Cohen is, according to Forbes, the 39th richest person in America. Since buying the Mets in 2020 for $2.4 billion, Cohen has infused a fortune into his new toy. Once a circus of frugality, the Mets organization has refurbished its reputation and is now firmly considered as one of the financial behemoths of the sport. Last offseason, the club’s first under new president of baseball operations David Stearns, the Mets focused on depth by signing a bevy of players to one-year deals. Those shrewd acquisitions helped propel the 2024 OMG Mets into the annals of New York sports history and set the Mets back on a winning path. But with so many key contributors reaching free agency, the Mets could look drastically different next season. And different could mean better considering the Mets have the financial flexibility to be extremely active. The current projected payroll comes in approximately $170 million lower than the 2024 end-of-year $336 million mark. But how high will it go? Stearns, who cut his teeth running the thrifty Milwaukee Brewers, has a track-record of operating conservatively. Cohen, on the other hand, is the anti-Scrooge. Considering how high payroll has gone before, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the Mets commit a good deal of money to free agents this winter. We know Juan Soto is going to command a contract for at least $550 million dollars, a figure that Cohen and Co. can certainly afford. Anything the Yankees offer, Cohen could theoretically reach into his endless hedge fund riches and outbid his crosstown rivals. Soto’s agent, Scott Boras, will be counting on this exact dynamic to drive up the price. And so, the Mets’ run at Soto will come down to three dynamics: Did Soto’s one year in the Bronx do enough to convince him to take less money (though still a lot of money) to be a Yankee? How high are the Yankees willing to go? Can the Mets convince Soto that Queens is the better fit for him? How the Soto sweepstakes plays out will dictate the rest of the Mets' offseason. If they reel in the big fish, they’ll operate somewhat more judiciously to fill out the roster. If the Mets miss out on Soto, their pivot could be a windfall for other highly touted free agents. Nobody has ripped more homers at Citi Field than Alonso, who delivered an underwhelming season in his final year under contract. Still, the jolly basher still clubbed 34 long balls in 2024, while finishing the year with a batting line 23% above league average. It’s also important to consider what he means to the franchise; Alonso started 86% of games at first base for the team since his debut in 2019 and is currently just 32 home runs behind the all-time Mets record of 252 held by Darryl Strawberry. By (1) staying in Queens and (2) delivering another few productive seasons would make Alonso a franchise icon. Yet, there are ample reasons to be wary of Alonso’s profile. He’s a relatively unathletic right-handed hitting first baseman on the wrong side of 30 years old who isn’t a great defender. Sluggers of that sort don’t often age well. The “smart” move would be to let Alonso walk, move 2024 breakout Mark Vientos from third (where he’s a subpar glove) to first (where he’d be fine) and find a new third baseman. That tact is far from a given and there aren’t many other players available who can offer such bankable home run power. The Mets can sign Soto and Alonso, but will they want to? Both players, as they age, would require at-bats at DH. Having two one-dimensional sluggers on the same roster could create a logjam. On the other hand, the two would form a formidable righty-lefty combo in the middle of the lineup for a long time. Will the Mets' offer end up being Alonso’s highest bid? Probably not. His free agency could come down to (1) the gap between the Mets and the next best offer and (2) whether Alonso would choose continuity over cash. The rotation was essential to New York’s surprise season, but three-fifths of that group — Sean Manaea, Luis Severino and José Quintana — are on the open market this winter. That leaves behind Japanese fork-baller Kodai Senga, who was injured for almost all of 2024, and left-hander David Peterson. Those two, if healthy, have starting spots locked down. Tylor Megill and Paul Blackburn could be in the mix, but both are best deployed as depth options. That means the Mets need to add at least two starters, but probably three. Stearns was surprisingly open about this dynamic, telling reporters at his end-of-year news conference that, “We’re going to have to add starting pitching. We’re going to have to add multiple starters. We understand that. We went into last offseason with the same need and I think we’ll be able to do it.” There’s no doubt that the Mets could use a no-doubt ace at the front of their rotation. Only three or four free-agent hurlers fit that bill: Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell, Max Fried and Roki Sasaki, with Burnes being the most reliable option. Snell has two Cy Youngs to his name, but durability concerns. Fried has a stellar track record of run prevention, but pairs best with a strong infield defense. Sasaki might have a higher ceiling than anybody on Earth, but can’t be relied upon to lead a staff right away coming from Japan. Expect the Mets, with or without Soto, to be heavy on this quartet. Beyond that, a Severino return feels the most likely, as sources indicated to Yahoo Sports that the hurler is extremely interested in a reunion. As Stearns mentioned, the Mets cobbled together quite an impressive rotation through free agency last year and they can be counted on to do so again. In the team’s four NLCS losses, the Mets surrendered nine, eight, 10 and 10 runs to the eventual World Series champions. The bullpen, in particular, was stretched thin all October long. Skipper Carlos Mendoza leaned heavily on the two or three arms he trusted — Edwin Díaz, Ryne Stanek, Reed Garrett — because he didn’t have much else. That wasn’t an issue in shorter series during the wild-card round and the NLDS, but in a seven-game set against the Dodgers, the Mets got exposed. The Mets need more relievers and better ones, hurlers they can trust in huge postseason spots. It’s unlikely they shop at the high end of the bullpen market considering they already have a big-money guy back there in Díaz. But expect Stearns to add a handful of relievers on shorter-term deals, particularly those with experience in big games. Kirby Yates, Blake Treinen and Jeff Hoffman all fit the bill.",2024-11-14

Dave Sims is reportedly close to an agreement to become the team's new play-by-play broadcaster on WFAN, as first reported by the New York Post's Ryan Glasspiegel. A verbal agreement is already in place and a two-year deal is expected to be signed soon, according to The Athletic's Andrew Marchand. Sims, 71, has called games on the Seattle Mariners' TV broadcasts for the past 17 seasons. He replaces John Sterling, who retired from the radio booth early last season after 35 years due to health concerns. Sims will partner with Suzyn Waldman on the radio broadcasts. Last season, Justin Shackil called most of the Yankees games on radio with Waldman while Emmanuel Berbari was also part of the mix. Rickie Ricardo, who calls the Yankees' Spanish language broadcasts, was also reportedly under consideration. For Sims, calling the Yankees is a return to New York, where he began his media career as a reporter for the New York Daily News. He then moved to radio as the host of WNBC's ""SportsNight"" and eventually co-hosted the WFAN midday show with Ed Coleman. Additionally, he was a weekend sports anchor at WCBS and a host for the New York Knicks' radio broadcasts. During his career, Sims also covered track and field for NBC during the 1988 Summer Olympics, called college basketball for Fox and FS1, and broadcasted NFL games, including ""Sunday Night Football,"" for Westwood One. Sims began calling baseball telecasts for ESPN before joining Root Sports' Mariners broadcast team in 2007. He is one of 10 finalists (along with Sterling) for the 2025 Ford C. Frick Award, presented by the Baseball Hall of Fame for excellence in baseball broadcasting. In 2012, Sims called two perfect games — first by Philip Humber, then Félix Hernández — and one Mariners' run to the postseason in 2022. Yankees fans certainly hope he'll call many more postseason runs for their team.",2024-11-14

But almost no one expected whose reckoning it would be. Tennessee travels to Athens this weekend to challenge the University of Georgia in one of only two games matching ranked teams. (The other is No. 23 Missouri at No. 21 South Carolina. Knock yourselves out, y’all.) It’s not a surprise that both the Vols and Dawgs are coming into the weekend highly ranked. It is, however, a surprise at where they sit. One-loss Tennessee arrives in Athens with a clear path to the SEC championship and a first-round CFP bye. Head coach Josh Heupel and quarterback Nico Iamaleava have at last delivered a team worthy of the hue and cry of Neyland Stadium, and they’ve got the bones of Alabama buried in the checkerboard turf to prove it. Two-loss Georgia, on the other hand, suddenly finds itself outside of the current (meaningless) playoff bracket and very much on the verge of missing the entire 12-team playoff. It’s quite the fall for the 2021-22 national champions, who had fully expected the Kirby Smart juggernaut to deliver title after title in the post-Nick Saban era. And, of course, that could still happen. But it’s a whole lot harder for Georgia now, meaning it’s a whole lot harder for everybody. The transfer portal, NIL riches (which can have both positive and negative effects) and the absolute necessity of staying locked-in, every Saturday of every fall have all led to this: another Game of the Year in a season already full of them. Heupel, like all SEC coaches in the 21st century, knows exactly how to craft the proper respectful-while-saying-nothing statement on his upcoming opponent. “Extremely talented, coached extremely well,"" he said earlier this week. ""They play hard. They play fundamentally sound. They make you earn it in every way, and one that will be a great, great environment ... ” You get the idea. Nobody puts motivational material on bulletin boards any more; social media handles that job just fine. Heupel understands how not to end up on an Instagram image with “We’re gonna kennel the Dawgs” or some other inflammatory line emblazoned in front of him. It’s wise strategy, even if it doesn’t make for thrilling content. Smart, on the other hand, did a fine job of creating some social media heat this week, although he trained it on his own team rather than Tennessee. He called one of his own players an “idiot” for celebrating with Ole Miss (technically, with his friends wearing Ole Miss gear), then walked that back. The big question for Tennessee is the health of Iamaleava. The Knoxville News reported this week that the electric quarterback is in concussion protocol, although no official announcement has been made. Heupel proclaimed Iamaleava in “great shape” on Monday, but a Wednesday report listed him as “questionable.” Iamaleava’s availability is likely the key reason behind oddsmakers’ 10-point-and-increasing line that’s favoring Georgia right now. On the other side of the ball, Georgia faces significant questions about its identity. Which Bulldog squad will show up Saturday? The fearsome crew that eviscerated Texas and Clemson on the road and rallied from down 28-0 against Alabama? Or the tentative, directionless gang that struggled against Kentucky and looked lost against Ole Miss? Will Carson Beck look like the Heisman hopeful of his early season, or the interception provider of recent weeks? Beck’s 12 interceptions lead the SEC, and each one is a dagger in the Dawgs’ fading hopes of dominating the conference again. So what’s at stake here? It’s tough to divine the CFP committee’s exact motives, but losses — regardless of opponent — will weigh heavily in their calculations. That’s bad news for Georgia, which can’t afford another L on the record and expect to make the playoff field. (Is a three-loss Georgia better than a two-loss program from another conference? Probably, but you are what your record says you are.) For Tennessee, a defeat drops the Vols into the bubbling cauldron of two-loss SEC teams. Momentum and a current high ranking ought to be enough to carry Tennessee into the playoffs, and probably a hosting slot — assuming Tennessee wins out, of course, with Vanderbilt lurking. But a victory would almost certainly result in an SEC championship berth against the winner of Texas-Texas A&M — again, assuming that favorites win out. So that’s what we’re looking at this weekend: A chance for one program to level up, a chance for the other to hold off the darkness. It’s exactly what we want out of a late-season college football game. How about that? The playoffs didn’t ruin the regular season after all.",2024-11-14

Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Fantasy Football Week 11 Fades: Can you trust Najee Harris?,https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy-football-week-11-fades-can-you-trust-najee-harris-175054452.html,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 17:50:54 GMT",Beware of these six players with fantasy football bust potential in Week 11!,"Another week, another round of crucially important start/sit decisions. To help you make them, here's a look at six players with bust potential in Week 11. Something to keep in mind as you're reading: a ""fade"" or ""bust"" designation doesn't automatically mean you should sit a player, depending on the depth of the rest of your roster or available options on your waiver wire. Kirk Cousins has had a solid bounce-back season coming off a ruptured Achilles that ended his 2023 campaign. Through 10 weeks, he ranks as fantasy's QB10, ranked third in passing yards (2,634) and tied for the fourth-most passing touchdowns (17) — a great fit so far with WRs Drake London and Darnell Mooney, TE Kyle Pitts and RB Bijan Robinson in the passing game. But his opponent this week, the Broncos, are tied for the third-lowest EPA per pass attempt (-0.21) while ranking fourth in the league with a 39.2% pressure rate and the second-highest sack total in the league (35), only behind the New York Giants. Per PFF, Cousins has had the sixth-highest turnover-worthy play rate among QBs with 25+ pressured dropbacks this season at 7.3%, throwing for 5 TDs and 7 INTs on such plays. Heat check 🔥 Kirk Cousins belongs on most fantasy benches this week outside of two-QB and Superflex leagues. The Pittsburgh Steelers' run game has come alive in recent weeks after a relatively slow start this season, thanks in a big way to RB Najee Harris heating up down the stretch (as is typical for him historically). Unfortunately, there are some reasons to pump the breaks on Harris' upside for fantasy heading into Week 11. Just last week, he snapped a three-game streak of 100+ rushing yards in Week 10 (the first such streak of his career) against a Commanders defense that has been fairly friendly toward the run, averaging just 2.5 yards per attempt on 21 carries. Meanwhile, teammate Jaylen Warren saw 14 total carries — tied for the second-most he's ever seen in a single game, another week removed from a knee injury that's plagued him since Week 3. This week, Harris will not only have to overcome questions about the workload split between him and Warren but also face a challenging matchup against the Baltimore Ravens — one of the league's top rushing defenses through 10 weeks of the season. The Ravens are allowing a league-low 3.4 rush yards per play, allowing the fewest runs of 10+ yards, giving up the fewest yards after contact per attempt (2.21) while allowing the third-lowest EPA per rush attempt -0.18. Where the Ravens have been most susceptible to opposing RBs this year is in the receiving game, having allowed the third-most receiving yards (470) to the position all season — fitting, as teams are often in the position to play catch-up against the Ravens' highly potent offense. Even if the Steelers' defense is able to slow Lamar Jackson and Co. down, it's a game script that could favor Warren, if he's healthy enough to go in Week 11, having missed Thursday's practice with a back injury. In Week 10, Warren ran 15 routes, while Harris ran just seven. Heat check 🔥 Consider Harris more of a boom/bust, touchdown-dependent fantasy asset this week than a must-start. Warren, meanwhile, warrants consideration as a flex option, especially in full-PPR scoring formats as long as he is active. It is challenging to envision fading a running back that has had 20 or more touches over three of his past five games and scored in all but three outings so far in 2024. However, with a matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 11, fantasy football managers should be bracing themselves for a boom/bust performance that falls outside of Cook's typically safe floor. In Week 11, the Bills will host the Kansas City Chiefs, who have been right alongside the Ravens in terms of their ability to shut down the run this season. They are giving up a league-low 12.01 fantasy points per game to opposing RBs. They're the only defense to have given up fewer than 500 rushing yards to opposing backs, allowing the fourth-lowest EPA per rush attempt (-0.16) and the second-lowest yards per play average (3.7). Up against a similarly skilled rushing defense in the Baltimore Ravens in Week 4, the Bills were wildly outpaced, leaving Cook with just 48 yards on 10 total touches (0 TDs) for an RB44 finish on the day. Heat check 🔥 Start Cook as the top running back in a highly potent Bills offense that could see plenty of scoring, but be wary that this could be an inefficient spot that could render him a rather volatile asset this week. I didn't have to reach very far for this Week 11 fade, but it felt necessary to say just this once — you are not obligated to start DJ Moore (or any other Bears receiver, for that matter) until this team finds some sort of identity. The team has officially moved on from former OC Shane Waldron, but it will likely take more than a new play-caller to undo the damage that has been done and the regression the offense has seen since coming out of their bye week. Moore is a good wide receiver who many will feel implored to start due to his name value, but he has failed to clear more than 33 receiving yards in each of his last four games, finishing outside of the top 50 at his position in each of those games. His floor is simply too low to be trusted in even the most dire of situations. This week, the Bears will host the Green Bay Packers — a unit that ranks top-10 in average time to pressure and has been one of the most productive defenses in terms of forcing turnovers (18 total on the year). This could be another ugly one for the entire Bears offense, outside of RB D'Andre Swift. Heat check 🔥 Do. Not. Start. I'm begging you. Atlanta Falcons WR Drake London has thrived with new QB Kirk Cousins, scoring as the overall WR4 in fantasy through the first 10 weeks of the season, having totaled the fifth-most receptions (58) and eighth-most receiving yards (649) while ranking third in the position in total touchdowns. That all sounds fine and dandy until you put it up against the vaunted Denver Broncos defense, however. The biggest problem on that defense for London? All-Pro cornerback, Patrick Surtain II. Here's a look at some of Surtain II's advanced stats in coverage and where that ranks among CBs to play at least 200 coverage snaps this season: 10% target rate in coverage (second-lowest) 0.6 yards per snap allowed (tied-fewest) -0.68 EPA per target (lowest) 57.5 NFL passer rating when targeted (fourth-lowest) Simply put, Surtain isn't targeted often in coverage because he's so efficient when opposing QBs try to make it happen. WRs DK Metcalf, George Pickens, Mike Evans and Garrett Wilson managed just 15.6 fantasy points combined against this defense — in big part, thanks to Surtain's ability to lockdown perimeter receivers. Heat check 🔥 London isn't a must-start in Week 11 if you have better options, though most rosters probably don't have the luxury to sit him. Though Zay Flowers found some success against this defense in Week 10, most of that production came out of the slot, having played a season-low 47.1% of snaps on the perimeter in that game. If London does primarily work along the outside, he's likely in line for a quiet afternoon. There aren't many tight ends you can afford to fade on any given week, but given the current state of Jacksonville's offense, a warning about a potential decrease in production for Evan Engram seems warranted. They'll be without starting quarterback Trevor Lawrence again this week — he's dealing with a shoulder injury — which means it's Mac Jones at the helm once again going up against the Detroit Lions. The Lions are allowing the ninth-lowest EPA per dropback on slot + inline targets, giving up plenty of yardage in coverage of these areas of the field but little scoring (4 TD, 6 INT) in such coverage, resulting in the second-fewest fantasy points per game given up to opposing tight ends. They've allowed just one touchdown to the position all season, which doesn't bode well for a passing offense that didn't manage a single passing touchdown just last week, as Jones totaled just 139 passing yards on 22 attempts while also throwing two interceptions. Heat check 🔥 Given Engram's role in the offense as a primary slot target when Christian Kirk is out, you'll be hard-pressed to find many options you'd prefer over Engram in this economy. However, it could be a bumpy outing if Engram doesn't see significant volume.",2024-11-14

As we get closer to the end of the fantasy season, we think we know the majority of players and what to expect from them moving forward. However, it’s not always as clear-cut as you’d think and matchups aren’t the only issue. Sometimes we have to adjust our expectations of players and offenses moving forward to truly understand the potential, or lack thereof, with players. I don’t often include quarterbacks, but Bo Nix was in the make-or-break column last week. I highlighted his potential upside in a surprisingly favorable matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs, and he delivered as the QB12 on the week. This week, I want to discuss Maye with a similar thought process — that Maye can still thrive even in a less-than-ideal matchup. When Maye took over as the official starter in Week 6, it was messy but highly productive from a fantasy perspective. He finished as QB8 against Houston and QB7 against Jacksonville. Since then, Maye has gone through rookie woes. To be fair, these struggles have come against very formidable pass defenses, including the New York Jets, Tennessee Titans and Chicago Bears, with the Jets matchup being the week he missed most of the game due to injury. All things considered, Maye has been solid. While his passing has been inconsistent, his rushing ability has provided a reliable floor. This week, he faces a promising matchup against the L.A. Rams. The Rams’ defense is vulnerable, particularly their secondary, but their pass rush has improved as the season has progressed. The Rams have bet big on young talent, and while it took them time to acclimate to the NFL and find their groove, they’ve now become a more aggressive pass-rushing unit. A young, aggressive rush against a shaky offensive line can spell trouble, and Maye may not have the time he needs to exploit the secondary fully. That said, if Maye is forced to bail out of the pocket, it bodes well for his rushing upside. While the Rams’ defensive line could make this a tough matchup, Maye still offers strong upside as a streaming option, especially for fantasy teams that need to take a risk and pull out a win. I do live Q&A on Yahoo’s social channels every week and on my Tuesday live this week, I got a very timely question: when is Nick Chubb going to be Nick Chubb? Fantasy managers welcomed Chubb back in Week 7 with open arms. Reminiscing on the good old days, we always knew what to expect with Nick Chubb: a hefty workload, high yardage, strong yards per carry and touchdowns. While expectations were tempered coming off a significant injury, Chubb’s return has been fruitless from a fantasy perspective. Part of this can be attributed to the overall struggles of the Cleveland offense, but the numbers tell a clear story: Chubb has yet to exceed 52 rushing yards, has just one touchdown, averages 2.69 yards per carry and has no receiving upside. He’s failed to reach double-digit fantasy points in half-PPR. In all fairness, his last two matchups were against Baltimore and the L.A. Chargers. The Chargers have consistently been stout against the run and the Ravens have shut down running backs all season. In fact, Chubb’s 52 yards were the most by any back against the Ravens this season. Despite these challenges, fantasy managers remain optimistic that, in the perfect matchup, Chubb can return to form. This week offers strong potential. While his snap count hasn’t been particularly high, Chubb has dominated touches out of the backfield. The opportunity is there; it’s just a question of whether he can capitalize on it in an excellent matchup. This week, he faces a Saints defense that has been lit up by running backs this season, allowing the third-most fantasy points to the position. It’s also critical to note that it hasn’t taken top-tier talent to boost those points. Sean Tucker’s one-week-wonder and Javonte Williams' sole RB1 performance both came against New Orleans. This is the perfect matchup for Chubb to deliver his breakout performance of the season. The tides are turning in Denver, and they’re definitely not turning in favor of the aforementioned Javonte Williams. The Broncos didn’t hide their intentions when discussing Estimé recently, saying his workload would increase as the season progressed. Most expected a gradual ramp-up, but Sean Payton surprised everyone by completely flipping the Denver backfield in Week 10. Estimé had 14 carries for 53 yards, while Williams had just one carry for one yard and Jaleel McLaughlin had four carries for 12 yards. Estimé’s snap count wasn’t significantly high, but he did out-snap Williams. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Estimé wasn’t targeted in the passing game, while Williams appeared to be the preferred option with two receptions on two targets. Though it’s not much, it’s something to monitor since Estimé would need some receiving upside to be a reliable RB2. There’s a positive sign, though — Estimé did run a similar number of routes to Williams, so we might see his game evolve as the season progresses. This week’s matchup is risky. The Falcons allow volume to running backs, but rushing touchdowns have been rare — only Kenneth Walker III and Alvin Kamara have scored rushing touchdowns against them. While Estimé might see good volume, without touchdown potential and with limited receiving upside, he’s an extremely risky play. There’s also the question of whether or not we can actually trust Sean Payton. This wouldn’t be the first time a running back saw a sudden spike in carries only for Payton to switch things up the following week. I trust that Estimé has a real chance to retain the lead role, but I feel we need one more week before we can truly rely on anyone in the Broncos’ run game. Gus Edwards is back and fantasy managers now face a difficult situation with the Chargers’ backfield. In Weeks 6 through 9, while Edwards was on IR, Dobbins was the clear lead back. During that stretch, Dobbins ranked as the RB13 in half-PPR, averaging 15.9 fantasy points per game with two top-12 finishes. Edwards’ return has significantly cut into Dobbins’ volume. He had just 15 carries for 50 yards and three receptions for five yards, compared to Edwards’ 10 carries for 55 yards. While his performance was underwhelming from a fantasy perspective, Dobbins still has the edge in this backfield and should continue to see the bulk of carries. Edwards doesn’t contribute to the passing game, and when both are healthy, Dobbins has seen goal-line opportunities, so there’s no reason to expect Dobbins will be removed from the backfield when the Chargers are near the end zone. While Dobbins’ volume is at risk, the Chargers have a favorable matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals, with an expected point total of 47.5. This matchup should favor Dobbins, but with Edwards back, Dobbins has entered make-or-break territory. Still, his receiving upside and the advantageous Week 11 matchup lean slightly in his favor. I discussed DJ Moore in my Sunday Pulse Check article, so it should come as no surprise that he’s firmly a make-or-break player — emphasis on the break. Let’s not bury the lead here: Chicago’s pass catchers are unreliable across the board. We gave the Chicago offense the benefit of the doubt, lulled into optimism before their bye week when they faced favorable matchups that allowed Caleb Williams to thrive. Reality has set in again, and over the past three weeks, Moore hasn’t exceeded five fantasy points in half-PPR formats, with his best finish at WR55. We’re in a dire situation with Moore; his target share has been underwhelming and inconsistent as Rome Odunze continues to emerge in Chicago’s receiving corps. When each receiver is getting a fairly even share of the targets, this offense is unlikely to be productive from a fantasy perspective. Positive changes might be coming, as the Bears have rightly fired Shane Waldron. But can firing Waldron truly resolve the offensive issues? It seems highly unlikely. While Waldron’s vision was flawed, the Chicago offensive line continues to struggle, limiting Williams’ effectiveness. At this point, Moore is a boom-bust player, and the “boom” seems like a rare occurrence. This week he faces a Packers defense that has been a turnover machine and relatively strong against the pass. Moore is a very risky start this week and moving forward.",2024-11-14
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Fantasy Football Week 11 sleepers: Audric Estimé seeks to run away with Broncos RB1 job,https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy-football-week-11-sleepers-audric-estime-seeks-to-run-away-with-broncos-rb1-job-165236155.html,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 16:52:36 GMT",Are your lineups in need of some assistance? Consider one of these Week 11 sleepers from fantasy football analyst Scott Pianowski.,"Week 10 was a messy week for scoring, and the Sleeper Page felt the brunt of that. Ricky Pearsall got home on a nifty touchdown at Tampa Bay, but the rest of the sheet was filled with bricks. That's life. We're onto Week 11. Everyone listed below, as usual, is rostered in fewer than 50% of Yahoo leagues as we go to press. Normally we think of a Baltimore-Pittsburgh game as the ultimate rock fight, with the first team to 17 points the likely winner. That's not the shape this year. Lamar Jackson is playing the best football of his career — a big statement given that he's already won two MVP awards — and the Baltimore secondary has been a sieve all season (22 touchdown passes allowed, 294.9 passing yards per game). The Ravens could also be without safety Kyle Hamilton, a key piece. Wilson has been steady as a fantasy pick since joining the lineup, grading out as QB3, QB24 and QB9. He's yet to get past 30 pass attempts yet, but with the game total set at 48.5, Pittsburgh will probably be more aggressive than usual. Perhaps we need to give Estimé more props for last week's 14-53-0 line at Kansas City — the Chiefs, after all, are a nightmare to run on this year. The Falcons' front seven is also a plus unit, but it's not in Kansas City's class. The Broncos are at home and a mild favorite, so game script will likely favor Estimé. And even if he doesn't get any work in the passing game — he's yet to catch an NFL pass, after 17 grabs his final year at Notre Dame — Estimé probably has 13-15 touches already in his back pocket. The goal-line work will probably be his, too. It's surprising his roster tag is so low, given that Jeudy has 19 targets and a credible 12-152-0 line since Jameis Winston took over as the Cleveland starting quarterback. The Saints' secondary is the 11th-easiest for opposing wideouts to score against, and obviously it lost Marshon Lattimore to a trade two weeks ago. Cedric Tillman looks like the first read for Winston, but Winston certainly prefers targeting wideouts downfield as opposed to taking the safe checkdown. Jeudy can easily return value as a WR3 this week. His role continues to expand, with nine catches and 18 targets over the past three games. And that run came against three difficult matchups in a row. Boutte now takes aim at a Rams secondary that's handed out the eighth-most points to opposing wide receivers. New England certainly trusts Boutte; he's played 96% and 97% of the snaps the past two weeks. The Patriots were able to beat Chicago with a buttoned-up game plan, but they'll probably need to be more pass-friendly if they want to hang with the Rams. Hill has crept over the threshold for inclusion in this column, but he's a sound enough play that we'll color outside the lines and push him into the mix. Hill always carries a heavy chunk of goal-line equity into any matchup, and note he lost an 88-yard touchdown last week to penalty. Alvin Kamara is obviously the featured guy in the New Orleans offense, but there's room for someone else to collect 5-8 carries, and that could be Hill. Mix in a handful of catches and maybe some goal-line work and Hill has a plausible case to land in the top 10 at tight end. With Trey McBride and Cade Otton unavailable this week (perhaps Dalton Kincaid, too), Hill could be a reasonable fill-in. He hasn't scored a touchdown yet, and goal-line equity is what we look at most of the time with tight end sleepers. But Dissly does have 24 catches in his last five games and the Chargers appear to be souring on Hayden Hurst, who dropped his only look in Week 10. Dissly might be a pickup that you hold for a while because the next five LAC opponents have struggled to mark the tight end. Justin Herbert is playing at a high level but the volume hasn't been there most weeks; perhaps the Cincinnati offense can force the Chargers out of their comfort zone in Week 11.",2024-11-14
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Scott Boras shares Bregman nugget that could lead All-Star to Boston,https://sports.yahoo.com/scott-boras-shares-bregman-nugget-185610879.html,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 18:56:10 GMT","Alex Bregman seemed like a challenging fit for the Red Sox in free agency, but his agent's recent admission might change that, writes John Tomase.","Scott Boras shares Bregman nugget that could lead All-Star to Boston originally appeared on NBC Sports Boston Now here's a piece of news that may have slipped under the radar, but could have ramifications for the Red Sox: Free agent Alex Bregman is willing to move to second base. As the Red Sox try to get more right-handed this winter, Bregman looks like an obvious fit – with one major exception. Because he plays the same position as Rafael Devers, slotting him onto the roster at his natural spot of third base won't be easy. Bregman just won his first Gold Glove and has long been one of the best defensive third basemen in baseball. He just had the misfortune of sharing a league with Matt Chapman for most of his nine-year career, thus denying him that hardware. (Chapman switched leagues this year and recently won his fifth Gold Glove, with the Giants). There's no question Bregman would represent a significant defensive upgrade over the inconsistent Devers, but such moves aren't made in a vacuum, and Devers' ego must be taken into consideration, especially since he's the highest-paid player in club history at $313 million. He has made it clear he considers himself a third baseman and derives part of his identity from manning the position. The Red Sox must weigh the mental repercussions of any move. And that's to say nothing of the domino effect it would have on the rest of the roster. Does Devers take first base and force a trade of Triston Casas? Does he shift to designated hitter, where Masataka Yoshida is in the middle of a $90 million contract? Does Yoshida need to then take his subpar glove back to the outfield? Second base is an entirely different story. The Red Sox traded left-hander Chris Sale to the Braves last year for young infielder Vaughn Grissom on the assumption that he'd take over the double play pivot and join the club's promising young prospect core as a key part of the next great Red Sox team. So much for that. While Sale won the pitching triple crown in the National League and is the overwhelming favorite to claim the first Cy Young Award of his illustrious career, Grissom practically played himself off the roster. He battled injury and illness while hitting just .190 and exhibiting worrisome throwing mechanics. He's now merely one of many competing for the job, rather than the entrenched incumbent. Enter Bregman. His agent, Scott Boras, highlighted Bregman's place at the center of the recent Astros juggernaut. He's well-known across baseball as a leader and heart-and-soul kind of player, and he's no stranger to the big stage. Boras then just dropped this little nugget: ""You just don't have many players on the dirt that do what he does,"" Boras told reporters, including Bob Nightengale of USA TODAY. ""Also that Bregman can play second base, third base, his leadership, it's a market certainly that the Astros are very aware is very healthy to him."" Second base? Boras says nothing unintentionally, and that comment is surely designed to expand Bregman's market. Suddenly the Red Sox make much more sense as a destination. Bregman is a superstar, and putting him at second base would solve two problems without impacting the team's prospect pool or the rest of the roster. He has only played nine games there in his career, but he has made 129 appearances at short, and we've already mentioned he's a Gold Glover at third. Even if the 6-foot, 190-pounder is no longer than 9-WAR player with 40-homer power of five years ago, he's still damn good as he enters his age-31 season. ALEX BREGMAN WALKS IT OFF FOR THE ASTROS 💥 pic.twitter.com/cJLG0ZqvNp — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) July 28, 2024 And while some might argue that the second base job should go to prospect Kristian Campbell, there's no comparison between a rookie and an established star like Bregman, besides which, Campbell can also play shortstop and outfield; there are other ways to get his bat into the lineup if that's the goal. Signing Bregman would also open the possibility of making Campbell the centerpiece of a deal for young pitching, should management choose to fill any rotation openings that way. The Athletic's Tim Britton projects that Bregman will receive a six-year, $180 million contract. Given how poorly Boras's clients performed last year while awaiting big paydays that never came, perhaps his guys will be more amenable to signing earlier this time around. That could make Bregman a perfect solution for the Red Sox in an unexpected fashion, with the added bonus of establishing that, this offseason, the Red Sox really do plan to make a splash.",2024-11-14

Andy Behrens gets you ready to wheel and deal.,"The following is an excerpt from the latest edition of Yahoo's fantasy football newsletter, Get to the Points! If you like what you see, you can subscribe for free here. Look, there are plenty of weeks within the fantasy calendar when you can afford to switch to auto-pilot for a few days and not focus obsessively on your team — but this week, right now, isn't one of them. It’s time to lock in, people. We are careening toward the Yahoo default trade deadline on Saturday, so there’s work to be done. When you wake up on Sunday morning, one of the essential paths to improving your roster will be closed for the season. Everyone enjoys trading, so let’s get to it. Our mission is to give you three key pieces of trade advice and then offer some fantasy buy-low candidates to target. Every league has that one manager who approaches trades by thinking only of the players they’d like to dump, not the holes other teams may need to fill. A few times each season, that person will spam the league with Kadarius Toney offers (or similar), then complain that no one is ever willing to trade. The tiniest amount of pre-offer consideration can go such a long way. Take 30 seconds to review the roster of the team you intend to deal with, then propose something to help both parties. If your offer doesn’t include anything that can obviously improve the other manager’s squad, then it’s simply a time-waster, not a conversation starter. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. A decent guiding principle in fantasy trades is that if you land the best individual player in the deal, you did well. We’ve reached the point in the fantasy season when contending teams need to focus on constructing the best possible starting rosters, sacrificing depth in the process. We should be looking to maximize weekly scoring potential. Roster depth is a funny thing — it’s incredibly valuable in September and not at all in December. Each week, it becomes less important. By the time we hit the money weeks of the playoffs, your starting lineup should be so loaded that it basically sets itself, while your bench should be full of lottery tickets. Some of you are simply not wired to follow this advice, which is too bad. At some point down the road, it’s gonna cost you a fantasy title. We should never get so paralyzed by the fear of losing a deal that we forget the real priority, which is to hold the league trophy at the end of the season. If a trade can improve your team’s starting roster, it’s probably worth making. The whole idea is to deal from areas of surplus to address weaknesses. If both sides feel moderately uncomfortable with the deal, then it’s probably a winner. Here are five early-season underperformers who are A) strong candidates for positive regression, B) endlessly frustrating to the manager who drafted them, and C) obtainable via trade at a discount relative to their draft prices: He’s apparently dealing with one of the worst quadriceps injuries in the history of quads, because it’s already cost him three games. While he’s making progress, he's no lock to face the Chargers on Sunday. Let’s just please remember that when healthy this year, he’s been his usual self, averaging 9.0 targets and 68.2 receiving yards per game. If he’s good-to-go in December, he’s an obvious potential difference-maker. Few players are as chronically disrespected as Jacobs. He’s pretty much always available via trade, despite being one of the NFL’s most elusive runners. According to PFF, Jacobs currently ranks among the leaders in missed tackles forced (33) and yards after contact (3.73 per carry). He’s tied to an upper-tier offense, yet he’s only reached the end zone four times this season. Jacobs is the RB17 on the season at the moment, but he’s a clear candidate to enjoy a post-bye surge. We are nearing the end of the original recovery timeline from the fractured leg Pacheco suffered back in September. He should not have much difficulty reclaiming the primary rushing role for KC. Kareem Hunt has been a terrific waiver find this season, but he hasn’t exactly delivered a convincing impersonation of a healthy Pacheco. Hunt is averaging just 3.6 YPC and the underlying numbers are somehow less impressive. Only five of his 125 carries have gained 10 or more yards and he’s averaging just 2.36 yards after contact per attempt. Earth’s best quarterback is still outside the position’s top-12 in terms of year-to-date fantasy scoring, plus he’s headed into a dicey matchup at Buffalo. It’s an excellent time to buy. He’s thrown six touchdown passes over his last three games while averaging 273 passing YPG, so it’s already apparent that his weekly upside has returned with DeAndre Hopkins now in the mix. Pretty gross, right? Yeah, we know. But again, the idea here is to flag good players who can actually be acquired via trade. Johnson is actually gonna hit a few waiver wires this week after back-to-back dud performances for Baltimore. He was never a great bet to put up numbers in his first game for the Ravens following a mid-season trade, however — and then his second game was a Thursday nighter, which left little time for his role to expand. He’s a proven multi-year producer and one of the best separators in the game, so we don’t have to worry about his ability to leapfrog guys like Nelson Agholor in this team’s receiving hierarchy.",2024-11-14

Dalton Del Don attempts to identify misleading numbers that are worth a closer look. Yes ... The Numbers Do Lie. Ridley has averaged 10.7 targets, 6.7 catches and 100.0 receiving yards while scoring two touchdowns over three games since DeAndre Hopkins was traded. He’s been fantasy’s WR5 in points per game over that span. Ridley sports a 32% TPRR (targets per route run), 3.03 YPRR and a 41% first-read target rate since Hopkins left, which are WR1 numbers. It's a small sample, but it’s also encouraging Ridley maintained production after Will Levis returned last week. Moreover, Ridley has the third easiest remaining schedule for wide receivers after having the league’s toughest until now. Ridley’s impressive rates will regress some, and this is still an offense with a lowly 16.75-point implied total this week (when Levis may struggle versus Minnesota’s blitzing). But Ridley’s usage with Hopkins gone has been undeniable, and he suddenly looks like a top-20 WR down the stretch (even if some duds are sprinkled in). Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Herbert has been fantasy’s QB21 in points per game, but he’s been the QB9 over the last four weeks. He’s getting a career-high 7.8 YPA with an 11:1 TD:INT ratio, but volume has been a problem for his fantasy production. The Chargers rank 25th in pass plays per game. Los Angeles has allowed just 13.1 points per game, which would be top 15 in NFL history if the season ended. The Chargers’ red-zone defense (38.9%) is likely to regress. Moreover, L.A.’s favorable schedule has been loaded with low projected totals, but the Chargers’ upcoming matchups should feature many more shootouts. Herbert’s had the 10th hardest QB fantasy schedule so far, but he has the sixth easiest rest-of-season. The Chargers are one of just nine teams with a positive pass rate over expectation over the last month, as Los Angeles has thrown decidedly more since its bye. Herbert has also run more since L.A.’s bye, which is possibly a sign his foot is feeling better. Different upcoming game scripts will help Herbert’s terrific performance translate more into fantasy production. His season rank is highly misleading. Brown played a career-high 89% of the snaps last week when he saw all 24 RB opportunities. Newcomer Khalil Herbert played two snaps and botched a handoff resulting in a fumble, leading to a Leonard Fournette workout Monday. Brown had a season-high 75% route participation and saw a career-high 11 targets. He’s seen 100% of the Bengals’ RB touches over the last two weeks, including a whopping nine opportunities inside the 10-yard line. With Zack Moss out for the season, Brown has Cincinnati’s backfield to himself. Brown has been fantasy’s RB3 since Moss went down despite a matchup in Baltimore last week against a Ravens’ defense allowing just 56.8 RB rushing yards per game. Joe Burrow has looked fantastic, so Brown is in a terrific situation. He gets a tough matchup on the road against the Chargers this week and then a bye, but Brown should be treated as a top-12 back down the stretch. Jennings ranks 50th among pass catchers in receptions this season, but his volume will continue to increase with Brandon Aiyuk out for the season. Jennings led San Francisco in routes run, targets, catches, air yards and receiving yards during his first game without Aiyuk last week. He had the league’s sixth-highest first-read target share (38.5%) last week, and Brock Purdy owns the league’s fourth-best Passer Rating (134.5) when targeting Jennings. He ranks second in the NFL in yards per route run, eighth in fantasy points per route run and 10th among 117 pass catchers in ESPN’s Receiving Score. Jennings owns a 32% TPRR with Aiyuk off the field, and he’s now replaced BA as the 49ers’ “X” receiver. Jennings erupted for 41 fantasy points in Week 3 with Deebo Samuel Sr. out — the only other game in which he’s acted as SF’s WR2. Jennings isn’t Terrell Owens 2.0, but he can clearly play; he’ll now see a much bigger opportunity on a potent offense due for major red-zone regression. The 49ers’ offense looks crowded with Christian McCaffrey back, but Samuel Sr. has been slowed by multiple injuries, and George Kittle is dealing with hamstring irritation. Jennings’ range of outcomes suddenly includes him being a top-12 WR down the stretch.",2024-11-14

Here, fantasy basketball analyst Dan Titus will break down three things fantasy managers need to know each week. Or, he'll break down multiple three-point pieces of advice, analysis and more — it just depends on how open he is From Deep. Today, I'm breaking down three weird fantasy nuggets that have stood out to me as we pass the midway point of Week 4. Many wrote off the Dubs before the season got underway but the Warriors are off to an impressive 9-2 record to begin the year. Much of their success is drawn from their deep roster, composed of youth and overlooked vets who have seemingly bought into Steve Kerr's philosophy of having fluid rotations as long as it's translating to wins. And it is! But the weird part is, for how well this team is playing, Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, Jonathan Kuminga — no one — is averaging over 30 minutes per game. Even in the load management era, having seven players average at least 20 minutes per game but none exceeding 30 minutes a night is unprecedented. Draymond Green is a top 100 player in 27.5 minutes, while Curry and Buddy Hield make up two-thirds of the non-centers whose production under 30 minutes provides fantasy managers with top 40 or better per-game value. Given Curry's age, it's probably best he's not playing minutes like Kevin Durant (36), who's already on the shelf with a calf injury. Curry's playing the fewest number of minutes since his third NBA season, yet his efficiency and productivity make him one of the top 10 players in fantasy right now. While unconventional in today's game, Kerr's introducing a unique wrinkle to his rotations, allowing his players enough playing time to be effective. He could also be setting up for a possible trade scenario down the line. However the Warriors decide to move, they're a well-oiled machine right now that's getting contributions from nearly everyone up and down the depth chart. The league leader in steals is none other than three-year pro, Dyson Daniels. Daniels moved up to the fifth-shortest odds in the Defensive Player of the Year race, according to BetMGM, when he wasn't even on the list of options to begin the year. He's been a menace on defense, averaging an absurd 7.6 deflections per game on top of converting those deflections into over 3.5 steals per game. Should Daniels keep up with this pace for the rest of the season, he'd be the third player in NBA history to average at least 3.5 steals per game. He's amassed 23 steals over his last four contests, including three consecutive performances with six or more. Daniels is the fourth player in NBA history to swipe six or more steals in three straight games. He's good, but his length, depth and disruption have catapulted him into one of the top perimeter defenders in the league. Daniels went undrafted in 66% of Yahoo leagues and now, thanks to mostly his defense, he's 78th in points leagues and 34th in per-game value in 9-cat leagues. I don't want to discount what Daniels is doing offensively, though. He's increased his scoring from six points to 14 ppg this season and improved his FG percentage to 47% through Thursday. Still, Daniels' leap in fantasy production is driven by his current dominance in a regularly scarce category: steals. As if a three-time MVP, a Finals MVP and one of the best players ever had anything more to accomplish, through 10 games, Jokić is on track to lead the NBA in rebounds and assists per game. No one has done that in league history since Wilt Chamberlain in 1967. When analyzing the Joker's unreal start to the 2024-2025 season, he's putting up the best numbers of his career on a per-minute basis. In fact, Jokić's 1.78 fantasy points per minute is the second-highest rate since 1977. It's no surprise that Jokić is the No. 1 overall player in points leagues (67.73 fantasy points per game) and 9-cat formats. The Nuggets' dependency on Jokić is fantasy gold and despite lackluster play from Jamal Murray, Jokić' is raising the floor for Christian Braun, Michael Porter Jr. and others. Fantasy-wise, he's playing better than Wemby, but it's still very early, and I still believe that Jokić and Wemby will be the top two players in each format.",2024-11-14

Instead, they could host a playoff game due to the will of Marcus Freeman and free-wheeling play of Riley Leonard.","SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Riley Leonard expected the worst. As he entered coach Marcus Freeman’s second-floor office for their standing Sunday sitdown, roughly 24 hours after a stunning home loss against Northern Illinois, Leonard braced himself for bad news. After all, he’d thrown two costly interceptions in a game that seemed to dash all hopes for Notre Dame making the College Football Playoff. Is he going to tell me that I’ll never touch the field again? Was that my last game at Notre Dame? What happened next was a bit weird, wholly unexpected and, for Leonard, one of the most resonating thing he’d ever witnessed. A smiling Freeman embraced his quarterback with a dap, asked about his family and talked pleasantries like the day before never even happened. During their conversation, coach made something clear to quarterback. “In those lowest moments, Riley Leonard had to learn that I believe he is our quarterback,” Freeman recalls during an interview this week from his office. “People might say you are awful and boo you. I as the head coach believe in you. And I need him to believe in me when we’re at the lowest moments. The lowest moments are when you find out who you really are.” Riley left the meeting with no better feeling, he now says — a turning point in the coach-quarterback relationship and, perhaps, the catapult he needed to recover from the first two-pick game of his college career. Two months later, the Irish haven’t lost again. They have won seven straight, six of those by at least two touchdowns and four of those by at least five touchdowns. Leonard is leading Notre Dame in both passing and rushing yards (1,575-609) and passing and rushing touchdowns (9-13). He has thrown fewer interceptions in the last seven games combined (1) than he did in the single game against Northern Illinois. And he’s playing more freely than ever. Why? That 16-14 loss to the Huskies. “I already hit rock-bottom,” Riley told Yahoo Sports this week. “Who cares from this point? I have that mindset of no regrets. Let it fly. Have fun. You only get one shot at this thing. It’s my last year.” Notre Dame’s winning streak has vaulted the Irish (8-1) from playoff impossible to playoff improbable to playoff … probable? The final stretch isn’t the most difficult three-game haul. But it’s not the easiest either. In fact, after hosting 5-4 Virginia this Saturday, Notre Dame plays unbeaten Army at Yankee Stadium before finishing the season in Los Angeles against USC (5-4). According to the playoff selection committee’s latest rankings — the Irish are No. 8 — an 11-1 Notre Dame is undoubtedly in the playoff and may even be in line to host a first-round game as a No. 5-8 seed. Fortune favors the Irish: On the year they lose to Northern Illinois, there is an expanded, 12-team playoff that provides them with enough access room to squeeze into the field. Not only that, but, unlike other teams, Notre Dame would enter the playoff without having played a physically and emotionally grinding game against a top-flight opponent in a conference championship. There is a cost: Notre Dame is ineligible for one of the four first-round byes, which are exclusively reserved for conference champions. The Irish must get an at-large (seed 5-12), a compromise negotiated by former athletic director Jack Swarbrick for ND’s lack of a 13th game. Imagine the Irish hosting in mid-December an SEC juggernaut like Alabama, Texas or Georgia. Or what about an in-state collision with Indiana? It’s conceivable if not even likely. But there is no postseason imagination from Freeman. “Everybody in this program knows we control our own destiny,” he said. “We can daydream all we want about the College Football Playoff, but you’re wasting time.” But let’s waste just a bit more time, shall we? A playoff game against any of those SEC programs would be extra special for Leonard, a kid that grew up along the Alabama coast without having offers from those more regional schools. He eventually signed with Duke, won 16 games as a two-year starter and then transferred here over the offseason. He’s a long way from home and far from the Gulf Coast fishing holes he frequented as a kid. He’s a Southern boy in the Midwest and in one of the most pressure packed positions in the sport: the starting quarterback of Notre Dame. Things were going just fine in that role until the Irish lost as 28-point favorites. Being the Notre Dame starting quarterback wasn’t so fun any longer. “You don’t understand the magnitude of (the position) until something goes bad,” he said. Thankfully, his girlfriend and marketing team operate his social media platforms. He saw none of the hate and vitriol. Instead, his friends and family members saw it all and texted him about it. Don’t look at your comments! They’re all crazy! They’re saying wild stuff — don’t listen! Don’t worry, Leonard would respond, he’s not listening or watching. After all, the critics are just “cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” That’s a line from former president Teddy Roosevelt’s speech on courage that he delivered in Paris in 1910 dubbed “The Man in the Arena.” It’s one of Riley’s favorites. In fact, he has the speech text as lock screen wallpaper on his smartphone. It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena. Leonard views himself as that man, in the arena, the bright lights shining on his golden helmet. Freeman isn’t so different. He’s in the arena too, the face of Notre Dame football, one of the richest and most historic programs in the country, devoid of a national championship for 36 years now. Their positions — head coach at Notre Dame, starting quarterback at Notre Dame — are two of the most enviable and inevitable in the sport. Win and you are showered in adulation; lose and you are the reason why. “That’s the position we are in,” Freeman said. “The lowest moments is when you find out who you really are and what you are made of,” he later said. “If you have too many low moments, guess what? You’re gone. Don’t care if you are the starting quarterback or head coach. You’ve got to be replaced.” If they win the final three games, if they continue their torrid run in the playoff, if they win it all, maybe they’ll point to that low moment as a reason. It’s the pain that drives the Irish. “We use it as motivation every day,” said linebacker Jack Kiser. “Can’t lose that pain. Can’t lose what that feeling is like.” Keep the pain. It’s a slogan that Freeman began using after the loss to the Huskies. The gist: Don’t forget how you felt when you lost. Fear losing. Fear a loss. “People are usually motivated by two things: fear or greed,” Freeman said. “I keep reminding them: You have to keep the pain. There should be fear.” This isn’t Freeman’s first time reviving a team that endured a deflating early season loss. In his first season in 2022, Marshall beat Notre Dame in South Bend. His team followed that by winning eight of the next nine. In fact, that game came up during that Sunday conversation in September between quarterback and coach. Freeman looked at Leonard, “I’ve been in your shoes,” he told him. “I’ve been here before.” Freeman grew so much from that loss to Marshall, he told Leonard. He learned how to be a better coach and a better leader. After the Northern Illinois defeat, the coach spent time examining how this could happen again. Marshall and now Northern Illinois? How? Why? It’s all mental, he says. A week before the Northern Illinois game, the Irish opened the season with an emotional victory at Texas A&M, delivering a win in a hostile and humid environment in Texas. “We weren’t ready to handle success,” he said. Now, more than two months and seven wins later, the Irish are three wins away from a berth in the inaugural 12-team College Football Playoff — with a quarterback and coach who are more connected than ever as the men in the arena. “He had to go through the ups and downs of being the quarterback at Notre Dame to understand what it entails,” Freeman said. “Just like me as a head coach. Someone can tell you what it’s going to be like to be the head coach at Notre Dame, but until you experience it, you don’t know.”",2024-11-14

Florida coach Todd Golden said that Olivier Rioux, a 7-foot-9 freshman who owns a spot in the Guinness record book, is planning to redshirt. Had the popular Canadian played in even one game, he would have burned one of his four seasons of college eligibility. Instead, Rioux will spend the 2024-25 season practicing with teammates and honing his skills — and still be a freshman next fall. “I should have made that clear (before),” Golden said. “Honestly, it’s put him in a tough situation. He’s sitting over there at the end of games and everybody’s yelling at him and trying to get him out there. They just hadn’t understood that that was our potential plan for him. “So that’s where we’re at at this moment. I’m not saying that’s 100% going to be the plan. We’ll continue to talk to him and see if he changes what he wants to do. But as of right now, that’s the plan that we’re going to have with him as we move forward.” Florida students chanted for “Oli” in both of the team’s home games this season. Golden emptied the bench in the final minutes of an 86-62 victory over Grambling State and even said a few words to Rioux during the chaotic scene. “I was just explaining to him, ’Hey, the reason why I’m not putting you in right now is what we’ve talked about a little bit,’” Golden said. “This wasn’t a choice that I made for him. This is something that people (from) our program have talked with him and his family and his parents, his AAU coach and just kind of trying to figure out what the best route for him is. “I just went up to him and I was like, ‘Hey, I’m not trying to be disrespectful with you. I’m just not trying to burn your year putting you in for 30 seconds.’” Rioux handled the decision well, Golden said. “He’s a great kid, and he’s a pleaser,” Golden said. “He wants to do what others think is best for him. And he’s coachable. Again, if this is what our staff, his parents, the people around him that care about him, think is best, I think he’s going to be comfortable. Ultimately, it’s his decision. But I think that’s where he’ll land.”",2024-11-14
"Yahoo!

Dell finds himself in a beneficial matchup this weekend against the Cowboys. Believe it or not, Dallas allows the second most receiving yards per play this season according to NFL Pro. This is a bottom-10 Cowboys secondary and in four similar matchups against bottom-10 secondaries this season, Dell averages 14.9 fantasy points per game. Now Nico Collins is trending to play in Week 11. This should, and likely will, lower the target share of Dell in Week 11. But I don’t expect it to be too detrimental for him. He averaged 14.6 points in 10 games with Collins last season and often outproduced Collins on a weekly basis in 2023. The volume might drop this week but expect less defensive attention to go Dell’s way with Collins back in the lineup. Continue to start Dell; he’s a top-24 receiver this week. Hopkins is coming off a down week against the Broncos where he produced just 56 scoreless yards on four receptions. This was a big dropoff from his Week 9 breakout performance of 86 yards and two touchdowns against the Bucs. But don’t be too concerned by this Week 10 dud. Hopkins was facing a strong Denver secondary led by standout cornerback Patrick Surtain II. Hopkins plays most of his snaps on the outside, which is primarily where Surtain lines up. Expect a bounce-back performance for Hopkins this week. He’ll take on the Bills, who rank 22nd in coverage this season according to PFF. Buffalo allowed 70+ receiving yards to three different Colts receivers last week. Hopkins should become a priority target once again for Patrick Mahomes this week in a softer matchup. Start Hopkins with confidence in Week 11. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Jennings is coming off one of the best games of his career. In Week 10, Jennings played the Brandon Aiyuk role in the 49ers offense for the first time this season. This resulted in a nine-catch game for 93 yards on a team-high 11 targets. Jennings looked great on film, winning often at the line of scrimmage and downfield. He was operating as the 49ers' true No. 1 receiver in this game, ahead of Deebo Samuel. This week Jennings finds himself in a beneficial matchup against the Seahawks. Now, he produced just three catches for 27 yards against the Seahawks in Week 6, but he was playing a different role in that game with Brandon Aiyuk active. Expect Jennings to continue to operate as the 49ers' X receiver on the outside, an important role in the Kyle Shanahan-led offense. Seattle has been below average in coverage this season according to PFF, ranking 17th in total team coverage. Fire up Jennings in your lineups this week. Tillman exits his bye week and walks into a strong matchup. He’ll take on a Saints secondary that no longer has star cornerback Marshon Lattimore on their roster. New Orleans allowed 306 passing yards to Kirk Cousins and the Falcons last week in their first game without Lattimore. Both Drake London and Darnell Mooney topped 90 receiving yards in this contest. Now, it’s Jameis Winston’s turn to attack this secondary. Tillman comes into this strong Week 11 matchup red-hot. He’s earned at least 16 fantasy points in three straight games and has averaged 10 targets per game with Winston as his QB. Tillman leads the Browns with a 24% target share since Amari Cooper was traded to the Bills. He has a great combination of size at 213 pounds and speed that has paired well with Winston in the past. Tillman is a weekly must-start in any matchup moving forward but especially this week against a compromised Saints secondary. Williams returned from his suspension in Week 10 and produced three catches for 53 yards. This performance wasn’t anything too exciting, but he did quietly earn a 22% target share in this game which was his best usage in a game since Week 2. The result was just 6.8 fantasy points, but the usage was encouraging in his first game back against a top 10 Texans secondary. This week Williams gets a much better matchup in the Jaguars. Jacksonville allows a whopping 7.2 receiving yards per play, the most in the league according to NFL Pro. The Jaguars allow plenty of explosive plays on defense this season, which is a great setup for Williams' skill set. Despite missing the past two games, Williams still ranks top 10 in explosive plays this season according to Player Profiler. This matchup sets up nicely for Williams to create one to two big plays. You can FLEX him this week.",2024-11-14
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",What to watch: Week 12 college football viewing guide,https://sports.yahoo.com/what-to-watch-week-12-college-football-viewing-guide-142838162.html,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 14:28:38 GMT",There are two games between ranked opponents in Week 12 and both of those games are in the SEC.,"We've hit the home stretch of the 2024 college football regular season. There are just three weeks to go before conference championship week in the first week of December. Week 13 isn't the most loaded slate, but it does feature two games between ranked opponents and games all over the country that have implications in conference title races. And once again, those ranked games are in the SEC. The marquee game of the week is in Athens, Ga., as the Bulldogs play for their College Football Playoff life against Tennessee. Missouri, meanwhile, tries to keep its CFP flame flickering as a two-score underdog against a South Carolina team that beat Texas A&M two weeks ago. Here's what to watch in Week 13. All times are Eastern and all odds are from BetMGM. Time: Noon | TV: Fox | Line: Colorado -11.5 | Total: 46.5 The Buffaloes’ path to the playoff is clear. Colorado will get a first-round bye in the College Football Playoff if it wins its final four games. Entering the season, we figured that this game could have playoff impacts but that those impacts would be limited to Utah. Instead, it’s been an injury-filled nightmare season for the Utes again as they’re down to two healthy quarterbacks and lost TE Brant Kuithe to a season-ending injury against BYU in Week 11. QB Brandon Rose made his first career start in the controversial loss to the Cougars and suffered a lower leg injury on the final possession. Freshman Isaac Wilson will take back over as Utah’s starter. He’s appeared in seven games so far this season. Colorado’s defense should be up to the task of slowing down the depleted Utah offense. Though Shedeur Sanders’ passing prowess and Travis Hunter’s two-way exploits get a lot of Colorado’s headlines, the Buffs’ defensive improvement is the biggest reason why they are in Big 12 contention. Teams are averaging just 217 passing yards per game against Colorado and 5.3 yards per play. That’s a full 60 yards per game and one yard per play fewer than 2023. Time: 4:15 p.m. | TV: SEC Network | Line: South Carolina -12.5 | Total: 44.5 Missouri coach Eli Drinkwitz was technically correct when he said his team was in the playoff hunt following its wild win over Oklahoma. Yes, this Mizzou team has been blown out at Texas A&M and Alabama, but it’ll get serious consideration for the postseason if it finishes the regular season at 10-2. That task looks a lot more difficult than it appeared at the beginning of the season. QB Brady Cook is listed as doubtful for Saturday’s game with ankle and wrist injuries. Cook injured his ankle against Auburn and then hurt his wrist against Alabama. He missed the win over OU as Drew Pyne started in his place. The offense hasn’t been nearly as good with Pyne at QB instead of Cook, but he led the Tigers on two TD drives in the fourth quarter. The Tigers only have a chance if Pyne plays like that during the entire game. South Carolina has won three straight games after its two-point loss to Alabama. That includes a 44-20 win over Texas A&M. Given the way the Gamecocks played against both the teams that dominated Mizzou, you can understand why the Gamecocks are significant favorites. Especially with the way LaNorris Sellers is playing. He’s accounted for five TDs and nearly 500 passing yards over the last two games and hasn’t thrown an interception. Time: 7:30 p.m. | TV: NBC | Line: Oregon -14 | Total: 52.5 Is this the toughest game remaining on the Ducks’ regular-season schedule? Oregon is off in Week 13 before a home game against Washington to end the season. A win in just one of those games also gets Oregon in the Big Ten title game even though the Ducks are tied atop the conference with Indiana and just a game ahead of Ohio State and Penn State. We won’t get knee-deep into the tiebreakers here, but if Oregon wins Saturday night it will likely play the winner of next week’s Indiana vs. Ohio State game in the Big Ten title game in Indianapolis. And since Oregon is off, it will get to watch that game very closely. Ducks QB Dillon Gabriel’s chase of Bo Nix’s completion percentage record is likely going to be futile, though he could end up getting the Heisman at the end of the season. Gabriel is responsible for 28 touchdowns and will surpass 3,000 passing yards for the season if he throws for 153 yards Saturday night. Wisconsin enters the game on a two-game losing streak following three consecutive wins. The Badgers fell 28-13 at Penn State on Oct. 26 and were blown out 42-10 at Iowa on Nov. 2. Wisconsin is averaging just 25 points per game in 2024 as Tyler Van Dyke is out for the season with a knee injury. Time: 7:30 p.m. | TV: ABC | Line: Georgia -10.5 | Total: 48.5 Will Nico Iamaleava be healthy enough to play on Saturday? The Tennessee QB is reportedly in concussion protocol after he left Tennessee’s Week 11 game against Mississippi State at halftime. He’s officially listed as questionable on the SEC injury report. If Iamaleava can’t go, it’s hard to see how Tennessee has much of a chance against the Bulldogs. The Tennessee offense hasn’t lived up to its lofty expectations with him under center, and asking Gaston Moore to go on the road in Athens and win his first start may be a bridge too far. The Vols are in the top 10 despite an offense that’s been sluggish because of a phenomenal defense. Tennessee has one of the best defensive lines in the country and will look to give Georgia fits like Ole Miss did in Week 11. James Pearce Jr. leads the team with 5.5 sacks and is an All-American candidate. Georgia is out of the College Football Playoff mix with a loss; the Vols’ visit on Saturday night gave the committee an easy out with its placement of the Bulldogs on Tuesday. If Georgia wins, the Bulldogs are back in the provisional bracket after Week 12. If Tennessee pulls the upset, then Georgia won’t be considered for the playoff the rest of the season. A loss seems farfetched to us. Just look at how Kirby Smart motivated his team ahead of the Texas game. A No. 12 ranking can provide a lot of motivation. Time: 10:15 p.m. | TV: ESPN | Line: BYU -3 | Total: 56.5 Yes, your eyes aren’t fooling you. The undefeated top-10 BYU Cougars are favored by just a field goal at home against a team that has a losing record. You can understand why oddsmakers are hedging against BYU. The Cougars have escaped twice over the last three games with late scores. Overall, four of BYU’s nine wins have come by a single possession and three of those wins are by three or fewer points. Even if the Cougars win on Saturday, don’t be surprised if they’re underdogs at Arizona State in Week 13. Kansas took down Iowa State 45-36 in Week 11 and has won two of its last three games. The Jayhawks were among the preseason favorites for the Big 12 title, but have been the masters of the one-score loss. Five of Kansas’ six defeats have come by six points or fewer. That includes a two-point loss at Kansas State, a four-point loss at Arizona State and a four-point loss at West Virginia. Jayhawks QB Jalon Daniels has thrown for at least one TD and rushed for a score in each of KU’s last four games. Against ISU, the 2023 preseason Big 12 offensive player of the year threw for 295 yards and two scores and rushed for 68 yards and a score. BYU will need to contain him to get the win. No. 3 Texas at Arkansas (Noon, ABC): These two old Southwest Conference rivals meet for the first time as members of the same conference since 1991. The Longhorns are significant favorites, but we’re not sure of anything with this Arkansas team. Don’t be surprised if the game is close, at least for the first half with both QB Taylen Green and RB Ja’Quinden Jackson listed as probable. No. 20 Clemson at Pitt (Noon, ESPN): This game lost a lot of luster with Pitt’s loss to Virginia in Week 11. Clemson still has a decent chance at the ACC title but needs some help. That chance disappears with a loss to the Panthers, who need QB Eli Holstein back on the field. He left the loss to the Cavaliers in the second half with an apparent head injury and coach Pat Narduzzi said Thursday that Holstein will be a game-time decision. Boston College at No. 14 SMU (3:30 p.m., ESPN): The Mustangs’ manageable road to the ACC title game begins with the Eagles at home. SMU has BC, Virginia and Cal over the final three weeks of the season. Boston College will be starting Grayson James at QB after he took over for Thomas Castellanos in Week 11. Castellanos won’t travel with the team to Dallas and is reportedly weighing a transfer. Arizona State at No. 16 Kansas State (7 p.m., ESPN): Don’t overlook either of these teams in the race to the Big 12 title game. Both ASU and KSU are tied for third entering Week 12. Kansas State has the head-to-head tiebreaker over Colorado and Arizona State hosts BYU next week. ASU RB Cam Skattebo looks set to play after missing the Sun Devils’ Week 10 win over UCF.",2024-11-14

However, time is always part of the story now with LeBron James — those three consecutive triple-doubles set a record for the oldest player ever to accomplish that feat, doing it at age 39. That broke LeBron's old record set at age 34. Next month, LeBron will turn 40, so the question of how much longer he can do this — or how much longer he wants to do it — came up. ""It's the mind,"" LeBron said about what will determine when he hangs up his Nikes. ""Wherever my mind is, is how the rest of my body is going to go, whatever the case may be. I'm not going to play that much longer, to be completely honest. One year, two years, whatever the case may be. I said the other night that I'm not playing until the wheels fall off. I'm not. ""I'm not going to be that guy. I'm not going to be the guy disrespecting the game because I just want to be out on the floor."" LeBron echoes what he has said previously, and what the handful of great athletes who get to choose when they exit the game have long said (most professional athletes have that choice to walk away made for them when teams don't give them another contract despite the player wanting to continue). It's not the body — especially in LeBron's case when he has taken such exceptional care of his — it's when the player no longer has the desire to put in the work needed to get their body ready to play. It's not that said player doesn't want to keep playing, but he doesn't want to do what has to be done to continue to play at that level. LeBron will get to the end of this season, whenever that is for the Lakers, sit back and reflect, then make his call. Does he want to do this for season 23? The Lakers will gladly pay him if he wants to return. The question is, when does his mind tell him it doesn't want to anymore? LeBron doesn't know when that will be, but he senses it's coming.",2024-11-14
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Pros and Cons: Should Mets sign Walker Buehler?,https://sports.yahoo.com/pros-cons-mets-sign-walker-140002932.html,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 14:00:02 GMT",Should the Mets sign free agent pitcher Walker Buehler? Here are the pros and cons...,"One of the things at the top of the list for the Mets this offseason will be rebuilding a rotation that could be losing three core members from the 2024 group. They've extended one-year, qualifying offers to free agents Sean Manaea and Luis Severino, and Jose Quintana is also a free agent. Manaea will almost certainly reject the QO and hit the free agent market. Regarding Severino, the possibility exists that he could accept the QO, which would bring him back to the Mets for 2025. As things currently stand, the Mets' rotation ahead of 2025 consists of Kodai Senga (who should be healthy after a 2024 that was lost to multiple injuries) and David Peterson, with depth options that include Paul Blackburn (assuming he's offered arbitration), Jose Butto, and Tylor Megill. There are a handful of ace-level starting pitchers on the free agent market -- Corbin Burnes, Max Fried, and Blake Snell. Also available is 23-year-old Japanese ace Roki Sasaki, whose age and years of service in Japan will limit him to a minor league deal, with interested teams able to only offer their international bonus pool money to him. Pretty much every team will be after him. Then there's the trade market, with White Sox ace Garrett Crochet at the top of it. But there's also a way for the Mets to seriously improve their rotation without signing one of the biggest names or swinging a trade for someone like Crochet. They did that last offseason, when they signed Severino and Manaea. The Mets correctly identified that Severino was likely to bounce back after a lost 2023 with the Yankees, and their belief in that paid off. As far as Manaea, the Mets took a chance on him and then watched him pitch like an ace down the stretch in 2024 after he dropped his arm angle. Now, the 2025 version of Severino and Manaea could be staring them in the face. Enter Walker Buehler? Buehler is the only pitcher available this offseason via free agency who has legitimate ace potential, but who almost certainly won't require a long-term deal. The guess here is that Burnes will get around seven years, Fried six years, and Snell three or four. All three of those pitchers could get average annual values that exceed $30 million. As far as Buehler, it seems likely that he'll ink a one- or two-year deal (potentially with the second year being a player option) in order to build his value back up following Tommy John surgery and a difficult regular season in 2024. Another plus regarding Buehler is that the Dodgers did not extend a qualifying offer to him, which means any team that signs him will not lose a draft pick for doing so. When Buehler is right, he is a No. 1 starter. From 2018 to 2021 he had a 2.82 ERA (3.16 FIP) and 0.98 WHIP while striking out 620 batters in 564.0 innings -- a strikeout rate a tick under 10.0 per nine. And while Buehler struggled this past season during what was his first year back after having Tommy John surgery in August of 2022 (his second TJS, after also having the procedure in 2015), there are reasons to believe he'll be able to return to form in 2025 as he enters his age-30 season. Buehler's struggles during the 2024 regular season were deep, as he posted a 5.38 ERA (5.54 FIP) and 1.55 WHIP in 16 starts over 75.1 innings while striking out 64 -- a career-low 7.6 per nine. A closer look shows that Buehler's stuff graded out near the bottom of the league. Meanwhile, many of his advanced stats (including xERA, xBA, chase rate, and whiff rate) were among the worst in baseball. Buehler's four-seam fastball and sinker also saw modest velocity dips between his last fully healthy season (2021) and 2024, but those drops weren't alarming. His average four-seam velocity in 2021 was 95.3 mph, while it was 95.0 mph in 2024. Also of note is that Buehler relied a lot less on his four-seamer in 2024 than he did earlier in his career. And hitters tagged it this past season, batting .342 with a .696 slugging percentage against the offering. It's common for pitchers in their first year back from Tommy John surgery to struggle, so it should not be surprising that Buehler's regular season in 2024 was a slog. But it was alarmingly bad at times. Another thing to consider is how many innings Buehler might be limited to in 2025. He pitched just 90.1 innings in 2024 between the regular season and postseason, meaning it's unreasonable to believe he'll have a regular workload this coming season. As the Dodgers' playoff run went on, Buehler started to resemble the best version of himself, culminating with 4.0 shutout innings against the Mets in the NLCS and 6.0 scoreless innings against the Yankees in the World Series. In those two series, he allowed just five hits, walked four, and struck out 13. If Buehler finds his form, he could be the steal of the offseason. And if he doesn't, the commitment will likely be so short that it wouldn't matter much. He should be near the top of the Mets' offseason wish list.",2024-11-14
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Sinner and Fritz progress at ATP Finals,https://sports.yahoo.com/fritz-beats-minaur-boost-last-160404958.html,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 22:38:54 GMT",World number one Jannik Sinner and Taylor Fritz are through to the last four at the ATP Finals in Turin.,"World number one Jannik Sinner continued his perfect start at the ATP Finals with a dominant win over Russian Daniil Medvedev. Playing on home soil in Turin, Sinner won 6-3 6-4 to top the Ilie Nastase group with three wins from three. Sinner's place in the semi-finals had earlier been confirmed by Taylor Fritz's 5-7 6-4 6-3 defeat of Alex de Minaur. He returned the favour by seeing off Medvedev, with the Russian needing to beat Sinner in straight sets if he was to qualify ahead of American Fritz. Sinner and Fritz will discover their semi-final opponents on Friday with Carlos Alcaraz, Alexander Zverev, Casper Ruud and Andrey Rublev still able to qualify. ""No preference [on who I play]. Whoever it is going to be on the other side of the net I will try to play the best tennis I can,"" Sinner told Sky Sports. Top seed Sinner has yet to drop a set in Turin as he seeks an impressive end to a year in which he has won his first two Grand Slam titles, but also been embroiled in an ongoing doping controversy. ""I'm here, I know what I have achieved during this year so I try to step on court with a good mindset,"" Sinner said in his on-court interview. ""I have a good team around me. I have beautiful people around me who support me daily and wish for me."" The Australian and US Open champion dropped just two points on serve during the first set as Medvedev was undone by 17 unforced errors. Sinner broke for a 5-3 lead before serving out the opener and carried his momentum into the second, striking first again. Medvedev responded to move level at 3-3, but more unforced errors proved costly for the fourth seed and Sinner took advantage to break at 4-4, much to the delight of the partisan crowd. A winner of seven ATP Tour titles in 2024, the Italian calmly served out the match for his 68th win from 74 matches. ""I'm here trying to find new ways to improve as a player. I'm here trying to win as many as matches as I can,"" Sinner added. 'Sinnermania' continues in Italy despite doping controversy Watch GB v Germany in BJK Cup Finals live on BBC Earlier on Thursday, Australia's De Minaur needed to defeat fifth seed Fritz in straight sets for any chance of progressing to the semi-finals in Turin. However, his hopes were crushed when Fritz stole the second set against the run of play. The US Open finalist had to wait to learn his last four fate, which was confirmed when Medvedev conceded the opening set to Sinner. ""All of us are pretty beat up but if I'm in the semi-finals of the world tour finals then I've got energy to give,"" said Fritz after his win. Seventh seed De Minaur, although labouring through his opening service games, was the first to break when he ended a superb rally with a clever cross-court winner for a 4-3 lead. Fritz was quick to respond, levelling in the next game before De Minaur broke again and served out the opening set as his opponent became increasingly frustrated, complaining to the umpire about flash photography in the arena. The US Open runner-up had to fend off two break points in the second set, while De Minaur, in comparison, looked comfortable on serve with three love holds. That was until Fritz increased his intensity and seized his opportunity at 5-4 to end De Minaur's season. With his tournament essentially over, De Minaur continued to falter as Fritz surged and he wrapped up the victory with an ace after two hours and eight minutes. ""He was all over me. What I did a great job of was towards the end of the second set I started to find my serve, I started serving much better,"" Fritz said. ""It just gave me a little bit of comfort to stay in the match and not be under so much pressure. It was still incredibly tough."" Meanwhile, Britain's Henry Patten and his partner Harri Heliovaara of Finland made it three wins from three in the doubles group stage. The pair, who won Wimbledon together in July, fought back to win 4-6 6-3 12-10 against 2020 champions Nikola Mektic and Wesley Koolhof, who was playing his last ATP Tour match. Patten and Heliovaara had already secured their place in the semi-finals and will learn their last-four opponents on Friday.

Aaron Rodgers, who claimed he wasn't aware of the ""Red Line"" hashtag Williams applied to a celebratory post on Instagram, laughed it off when asked about it on Wednesday by reporters. Does Rodgers have a response to Williams? ""I don't have one,"" Rodgers said, chuckling. ""I like Mike. I'm happy for Mike."" Rodgers publicly criticized Williams for running the wrong route on the play that became in game-sealing interception in a Monday night loss to the Bills last month. Rodgers said Williams should have been on the ""red line"" that runs (on a practice field) five yards from the sideline. When Williams wasn't where he was supposed to be, Rodgers adjusted the throw and the pass was picked off. Quarterbacks in the vast majority of situations don't blame receivers in public for incompletions or interceptions, even when it's their fault. Rodgers, who later claimed he was simply answering a question, broke that unwritten rule. Williams was clearly still thinking about it, even after he was traded to Pittsburgh. And Williams has every reason to. Rodgers could have simply said it was a miscommunication. Instead, he specifically placed the blame on Williams. It's no surprise. Rodgers attaches heavy importance on his obscenely impressive touchdown-to-interception ratio, since gaudy stats like that help support the argument that he's one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time, despite having only one Super Bowl appearance and one Super Bowl win. Williams is now playing with a quarterback who has two Super Bowl appearances. And Russell Wilson has never complained, publicly or privately, about a teammate. Even if he could have taken the position that the interception that cost him a second ring should be blamed on receiver Jermaine Kearse, for failing to execute the pick/rub on Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler that would have allowed receiver Ricardo Lockette to catch the championship-winning touchdown pass.",2024-11-14

Gruden has signed a multi-year deal with Barstool Sports. The Super Bowl XXXVII-winning coach of the Buccaneers was traded to Tampa by the Raiders before the 2002 season. He joined ESPN after being fired by the Bucs in early 2009. Gruden returned to the Raiders in 2018. In 2021, he was essentially forced to resign by the selective leaking of supposedly confidential emails harvested in the Washington investigation. Yes, the outcome was unavoidable given the contents of the emails. No, that doesn't make the seemingly deliberate effort to take him out during a season right. A lawsuit against the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell was quickly filed. More than three years later, it remains stuck on the question of whether the litigation should unfold in open court or in the NFL's secret, rigged, kangaroo court of arbitration. Recently, Gruden secured a rehearing of the matter before the full Nevada Supreme Court. If he prevails on the issue, the NFL undoubtedly will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, further delaying the case. Barstool occupies a separate spot on the NFL's unofficial shit list. Founder Dave Portnoy and others conducted a sit-in at the lobby of the league office after Tom Brady was suspended for #DeflateGate. The NFL has since tried (at times successfully) to keep Barstool Sports personalities out of NFL events. Earlier this year, Gruden launched a YouTube channel. It has done well. He's entertaining and informative. Just like his lawsuit will be, if (as we hope) it ends up playing out in court.",2024-11-14

A catastrophic, interception-laden first half for QB Carson Beck led to their first defeat at the hands of Alabama in Week 4. Fortunately, the Dawgs bounced back to extinguish Texas in Austin 30-15, despite another three-interception performance by QB Carson Beck. Two weeks ago, they overcame a first half scare from Florida for a 34-20 victory, which was a harbinger for last week’s embarrassing 28-10 loss to @Ole Miss. Their offense lacks explosion, ranking 99th in yards per successful rush (8.9 yards) and 73rd in yards per successful dropback (14.6 yards), and has committed 15 turnovers with a 3.6% interception rate (102nd). A loss to Tennessee would sink UGA’s CFP Playoff hopes, so they hope to have injured RB Trevor Etienne back up to speed after being limited the last two games. Tennessee (8-1) obliterated their first three non-conference opponents by a combined score of 191-13. That is not a misprint. Their lone misstep occurred in Week 4 when @Arkansas backup QB Malachi Singleton ran for an 11-yard touchdown with 1:11 remaining in the game to outlast UT 19-17. They churned out a pair of one-score wins over Florida and most notably Alabama, which has been their signature win to this point. Tennessee’s offense has cleared 28 points just once in SEC play, ranking 23rd in EPA/rush and 45th in EPA/dropback. Defensively they rank 3rd overall in SP+ and boast arguably the best run D in the nation, averaging a 28% stuff rate (2nd) and 33.6% rushing success rate (4th).

The latest odds as of Thursday: Moneyline: Georgia (-375), Tennessee (+300) Spread: Georgia -10.5 Over/Under: 48.5 points The Georgia line opened at a massive Georgia -17.5, but that has dramatically readjusted to the current -10.5 with unsubstantiated reports of Tennessee QB Nico Iamaleava allegedly being on track to play. Best prices for the Moneyline are -360 for UGA and +335 for the Vols. The game total has ticked down from the 49 open to a low of 47.5 at time of publishing. NBC Sports Betting Analyst Eric Froton (@CFFroton) thinks:“Georgia is 6-3 to the Under so far this year and has failed to clear the 48.5 points mark against Ole Miss, Texas, Auburn, Kentucky and Clemson. The only competitive game that went under was the Carson Beck first half meltdown against Alabama. Tennessee has gone Under 48.5 points in every SEC game so far, so I'm going to listen to the trends and play the UNDER 48.5 game total. ” Listen to the Bet the Edge podcast as hosts Jay Croucher and Drew Dinsick provide listeners with sharp actionable insight, market analysis and statistical data to help bettors gain more information before placing their wagers. Georgia: Heading into the season QB Carson Beck led all returning FBS signal callers with 3,949 passing yards and a 2nd ranked 91.5 PFF offensive grade. He emerged as a Heisman front-runner who opened at 4-to-1 odds to win college football’s most coveted prize, but the quality of his play has cratered with Beck throwing nine interceptions in the last four games. His 76th% PFF offensive grade and 12 interceptions are concerning, as is Beck’s dirt-low 28th% passing grade under pressure with a 35% completion rate. Tennessee: QB Nico Iamaleava arrived on campus last year as a ballyhooed five-star recruit with a premium athletic profile. After serving a one-year apprenticeship, he has completed 65% of his throws for 1,880 yards and an 11-to-4 ratio as UT’s starting quarterback. While his 82nd% passing grade is a very credible mark, HC Josh Heupel has protected Nico by having him attempt 30+ passes just once this season. Iamaleava’s 11.7 yards per attempt ranks third nationally, proving that he isn’t afraid to be aggressive and take shots down the field. Unfortunately, Iamaleava is questionable to play due to a concussion sustained last weekend against Mississippi State. Fifth-year QB Gaston Moore would draw the start in his absence. Georgia's offense has thrown for 2,578 passing yards in 9 games this season, tied for 16th-best among FBS offenses. Tennessee's defense has allowed just 171.6 passing yards per game this season, which ranks 15th-best among FBS defenses. Georgia’s offensive line ranks 2nd in the nation with a 20.9% pressure rate allowed and 8th with a 3.8% blown run block rate. However, they also rank 94th allowing a 22.7% sacks-per-pressure rate and 3.9 penalties a game, which ranks 79th overall. Tennessee has tackled opponents for a loss on 68-of-322 rushing attempts this year, good for a 21% TFL rate that ranks 2nd-best in the SEC. Ole Miss leads the conference at 26.5%. Despite HC Heupel’s reputation for building high-flying offenses, UT is running the ball at well above average rates on both standard downs (63.4% = 30th) and passing downs (49.2% = 7th).

	This year's NBA City Edition unis were officially unveiled on Thursday, so we're ranking them from 30 to 1.","The NBA and Nike officially unveiled the 2024-25 City Edition uniforms for all 30 teams on Thursday, and while the designs have been leaked since this summer, I like to wait until we get the official images to rank them. That is because the actual jerseys themselves almost always look better than their 2D mock-ups, which is certainly the case with this year’s crop. The leaks got roasted to no end on social media and while I’m not crazy about this year’s group of uniforms, they aren’t as bad in actuality as the leaks looked.  That said, there are some heaters and some really bad ones, along with a big crop this year of very “meh” looks as it’s fair to wonder if Nike and the teams are running a bit short on ideas — good news guys, at least another 12 years of these! Here we are ranking the uniforms from worst to best, where there’s one that should become part of one team’s permanent look.  NBA
Creating good alternates is hard when you have an iconic jersey set, and that’s the problem the Celtics (and Lakers) run into every year. These are just bad and don’t even seem to be trying to do anything interesting. Wear your normal (and great) uniforms, please.  NBA
Same goes for the Lakers. These are just unbecoming of a once proud franchise.  NBA
I’m honestly kind of stunned they went back to the Heat Culture well again after the reaction to when they did this last year, but it does look a little better on the all red uniform. Still, c’mon guys, stop trying to make this a thing. NBA
On the opposite end of the spectrum from Boston and L.A. is OKC, which has had one uniform in its history that I thought was legitimately good (the 2018 City Edition honoring Oklahoma’s Native American heritage). Everything else has been either “meh” or outright bad. I’ll say this, these aren’t the worst unis they’ve ever had, but I just am not a fan.  NBA
The Pacers have done this look before in black, and it’s just not for me.  NBA
A retro look that just doesn’t really land for me. I will say, I bet the court they have for this color scheme will look great, but I’m just not a big fan of the lettering.  NBA
I wouldn’t call these bad, they just don’t land for me, but that’s also been the case for a number of the Brooklyn City Editions over the years.  NBA
I’m just out on the 5280 thing. I like the mountains on the side and the topographical map thing, and while I think there are better executions, leaning into the rainbow coloring is generally good for Denver. However, I just can’t get on board with the 5280 in place of lettering. NBA
All of the uniforms in this tier have the same issue of not being bad, but also not being particularly inspiring. Dallas’ are particularly plain, which, again, not necessarily bad, but not memorable either.  NBA
I get they’re going for the Chicago musical font here, but it feels like they weren’t willing to go all-in on it and the end result is pretty bland.  NBA
I get what Minnesota’s going for, but I just see an old Windows 98 screensaver in that design.  NBA
They aren’t as bad as the Lakers and Celtics, but they also have a similar problem where their normal uniforms are iconic classics and trying something new often just makes you want them to do what they always do.  NBA
The Magic are at the top of this group by virtue of having the best lettering/logo — the Magic with a star for the A is always great — but Orlando has great uniform looks and this one just falls flat comparatively.  NBA
Like Orlando, Charlotte has some great throwback looks and this just makes me wish they were wearing one of those instead.  NBA
My colleague Mark said the logo looks like it should be for store brand paper towels and I can’t unsee it. I do like that shade of blue though.  NBA
Perfectly fine, even though it’s still a little confusing when the Bucks are wearing all-blue.  NBA
Never seen a more Oklahoma State jersey in my life. Go Pokes.  NBA
I actually kinda like these, but they are giving off strong vibes of made up Houston jerseys for a movie that couldn’t afford NBA licensing.  NBA
If I were to guess, these will be among the most polarizing unis. I dig New Orleans leaning into being a little different and weird, and the herringbone pattern with actual bones certainly does that. They will likely be at the bottom of some folks rankings but I don’t think their standard unis are so good that they can’t get weird and have it work.  NBA
These have grown on me a bit, in part because they at least look like Warriors uniforms — unlike their Michigan/Marquette alternates from a year or two ago. They aren’t the best uniforms in the world, but a solid attempt at playing off something unique to the Bay (the Golden Gate Bridge).  NBA
I really like the District font and this year they put it on a nice color instead of whatever the hell the black and green and orange thing was a year ago. The Wizards won’t be good this year, but I do think they’ll look good in these.  NBA
I like this Spurs font, they’ve done it before but it works for me. I also like this shade of blue. These aren’t as good as their fiesta look in the past, but a solid choice and I just like when the Spurs have a little pop of color.  NBA
I like these, even though I will not immediately spot this color and go “Cavs” in my brain. Part of why these will work is their court that goes with them is phenomenal.  NBA
Another one that gets a big boost from an unbelievably good court design. These play off the old 1995 All-Star logo, and while I’m not crazy about the font, I still dig them. If they incorporated the saguaro cactus into them, they’d be higher.  NBA
The Blazers almost always do a good job with the City edition uni, and this year is another good addition to their rotation. A big part of that is their “Rip City” font just looks good on anything. NBA
The Jazz are finally making the move back to the purple mountains with their full-time uniform set, and this year’s City Edition is a very good version of that.  NBA
The throwback to the Memphis Sounds just looks fantastic. I love that Memphis font and these are going to look fantastic on the floor — even if it’ll take a little adjustment to seeing a team in red and thinking “Grizzlies”.  NBA
The Kings also have another really good throwback look, taking it to the days of the Cincinnati Royals. The royal blue and red just pops, and they didn’t try to do too much with a uniform that doesn’t need much more.  NBA
I’m a sucker for this spectrum Sixers look. I just think it’s so clean and the white edition is even better than the navy look from a couple years back.  NBA
The Vince Carter Raptor doing his legendary between-the-legs dunk is so good and the Raptors need to just make it their permanent logo. These with the purple retro look they brought back this year is a damn-near perfect uniform set and it’s a shame they will move on to something new next season.",2024-11-14
Sports – UPROXX,We’re Picking Winners For Week 11 Of The 2024 NFL Season,https://uproxx.com/sports/nfl-picks-winners-week-11-spread-best-bets/,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:03:27 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	Come get these winners.","Sometimes, you simply want to unplug the season and plug it back in. That is where we are when it comes to NFL handicapping in 2024. After a pair of encouraging weeks, the ugliness returned in Week 10, including a Falcons-Saints game that impossibly stayed under with three missed field goals and other malodies. We won’t be deterred from the goal of righting the ship but, hey, you could also fade these picks if you’re feeling spicy. Before delivering this week’s five-pack, let’s take a look at the carnage in 2024.  Come get these winners. A Thursday night Under? Let’s get back to basics. Washington has been an “over” team to the tune of 7-3 this season, but Philadelphia has been quietly stout on defense in recent weeks. This is, of course, a short week for both teams, and Washington has some injury issues along its offensive line. I tend to think the Commanders defense is a touch undervalued in this spot as well, and this is a favorable price. The Saints got the bounce last week after firing their coach and, with the help of one of the worst kicking performances of the season for Atlanta, New Orleans won a game it shouldn’t have won. That could benefit us this week, as the Browns are underdogs in a spot where they probably shouldn’t be. Let’s ride the Jameis roller coaster and hope it goes well. Detroit is a wagon. They seemingly cover every week and, when they don’t like in Week 10, they somehow win the game despite a million turnovers. With that said, getting a full 14 here on Jacksonville is something I can’t pass on. Trust me, I know how ugly it is. Seattle is healthier and coming off a bye, including the projected return of DK Metcalf. I’ve also been a touch low on San Francisco all season, and I simply can’t get this to 6.5 points, even with McCaffrey back for the 49ers. This teaser happens to involve a pair of prime time games, but I would like it even if it didn’t. Candidly, I love each leg here, with the Bengals more than able to get in the backdoor if things go south at the outset. Houston is on the road, which does scare me a bit, but the situation in Dallas is rather dire, and the Texans may be discounted a bit after a maddening loss to Detroit.",2024-11-14

	Giannis got called for a foul despite getting all ball. But fortunately for the Bucks, as Rasheed Wallace once said, ball don't lie.","The Milwaukee Bucks played host to the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night, and while there is still a ton of basketball left to be played this season, you won’t find a more insane final 90 or so seconds of regulation than what we got out of these two Central Division opponents. The two teams traded the lead back and forth, and after a Marcus Sasser three tied things up with just under 30 seconds left, Milwaukee got the ball and had a chance to win. A wide open look by Taurean Prince did not fall, and with a hair over a second left on the clock, Detroit called a timeout, advanced the ball, and tried to replicate the magic it found on a sideline out of bounds play on Tuesday night against Miami. It looked like that was going to happen, as Cade Cunningham lobbed one up to Ron Holland near the rim, but Giannis Antetokounmpo was able to break things up … well, at least it looked like he did, but the referees called a foul that stood after a review even though it really did not look like Giannis fouled Holland at all. However, in the words of the great philosopher Rasheed Wallace, ball don’t lie. Holland stepped up to the charity stripe and missed short twice, which ended up sending the game to overtime. It would’ve been an awfully harsh way for the game to end for Milwaukee, but, again, Sheed’s got us covered here.",2024-11-14
Sports,"Carmelo Anthony, Rudy Gay Chime In On Drake-DeMar DeRozan Feud",https://www.vibe.com/news/sports/carmelo-anthony-rudy-gay-drake-demar-derozan-feud-1234943651/,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:22:01 +0000",The biggest topic of the year and all of its subsidiaries continues to make headlines.,"The intersection of Hip-Hop and sports means twice as many people chiming in on topics involving artists and athletes. Former NBA stars Carmelo Anthony and Rudy Gay recently chimed in on the recent back and forth between Drake and DeMar DeRozan, which was a byproduct of the 6 God’s feud with Kendrick Lamar earlier this year. 
	“I think Drake was hurt a little bit because of the relationship he built with DeMar in Toronto,” Melo said on an episode of his show 7PM In Brooklyn. “Representing the 6, Raptors — you know that was a lot of connection with those two. He’s a Raptor for life from a basketball standpoint. Yes, that jersey should be going up.” 

	








 
	Gay, who just recently retired from the NBA, previously played for the Raptors, and is a new recurring co-host on 7PM, disapproved of Drizzy’s behavior. “That’s wack, man. Drake is wack for that,” he asserted. “You gotta pull up on DeMar if you feel that way before you go on camera.” Melo agreed, especially regarding the Toronto rapper’s comments on taking down DeRozan’s banner if the Raptors ever hung one up for him.

	“Drake did a lot when he said I’ma go up there and take it down. That part is a lot,” Carmelo Anthony said. However, he acknowledged that DeRozan turned himself into Drake’s opposition when he joined Kendrick Lamar on stage at The Pop Out concert and appeared in the “Not Like Us” music video. “Those are shots. You my man, we in the crib, we hanging, we building the 6 up. From that standpoint, that would f**k me up, too. I’m gonna feel a way no matter what, but yes, you do have a conversation. As a man, you have a conversation.” 
	Though Rudy Gay did not like the “First Person Shooter” rapper’s actions, he leveled with Anthony on that part. “If you got a problem, come at me,” he said. “To see your man’s out there dancing with the enemy, that’s kinda crazy.” 
	Drake and DeMar DeRozan went viral earlier this month when the For All The Dogs rapper sat courtside for the Toronto Raptors matchup against the Sacramento Kings. At one point, he was interviewed on air and said, “Unfortunately, we’re playing this goof [DeRozan] tonight, but it is what it is” as well as “If you ever put up a DeRozan banner, I’ll go up there and pull it down myself.”

	








 
	After the Raptors defeated the Kings, Drake could be seen mouthing “F**k outta here pu**y” as DeRozan walked off the court. During a post-game press conference, the six-time All-Star was asked about the comments regarding the banner and said, “Well he gon’ have a long way to climb to take it down, so tell him good luck.” 
	This is a significant change in their relationship, just three years after DeRozan said that Drake would “forever have a friend” in him. When he was traded from the Raptors to the Spurs, despite being told he would not be traded, the five-time Grammy winner invited him to his house and gave him support in his time of disappointment. Even after appearing at The Pop Out and in the “Not Like Us” music video, he claimed that he still had love for the OVO head honcho. Those days are seemingly over.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Riley Gaines repeatedly tears into AOC for taking pronouns out of X bio after advocating for trans athletes,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/riley-gaines-mocks-aoc-taking-pronouns-out-x-bio-advocating-trans-athletes,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 18:19:24 -0500","Former college swimmer Riley Gaines repeatedly mocked Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., on social media on Thursday after it was revealed that the congresswoman took her pronouns out of her bio.","Former college swimmer Riley Gaines joins 'FOX & Friends' to discuss former President Trump's vow to keep transgender athletes out of women's sports during his Fox News town hall. Riley Gaines didn't let Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., off the hook for not using the right pronouns anymore.  The congresswoman was the subject of trending conversation on social media on Thursday when X users discovered that she no longer includes her pronouns ""she/her"" in her bio. Gaines, a former NCAA swimmer and OutKick contributor, got in on the mockery of Ocasio-Cortez on X with multiple posts.  ""They’ll pretend they never embraced (or even celebrated) the insanity. Don’t forget who the compliant, virtue-signaling sheep were,"" Gaines wrote in response to a post that claimed Ocasio-Cortez took the pronouns out of her bio before May of this year.  Gaines later responded to a video that showed Ocasio-Cortez previously apologizing for not including pronouns in her bio next to a photo that showed they were no longer there.  ""We're winning and its glorious,"" Gaines wrote. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., speaks onstage during the first day of the Democratic National Convention at United Center in Chicago on Aug. 19. ( Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Then even later on Thursday, Gaines made one more effort to mock Ocasio-Cortez in a solo post.  ""How will we know what to call AOC now that her pronouns in her bio are gone?!?!?!,"" Gaines wrote.  Gaines previously lambasted Ocasio-Cortez for her stance on trans athletes in women's sports. The Democratic congresswoman has been a frequent advocate for transgender rights and trans inclusion in women's sports during her tenure. Ocasio-Cortez recently spoke out against Green Party vice presidential candidate Butch Ware for saying he did not believe trans athletes should play in women's sports, calling the ticket ""predatory.""  ""AOC says it's predatory behavior to not want men competing in women's sports. To AOC, acknowledging biological reality is ‘predatory’ You know what's actually predatory? Sexualizing children and normalizing pedophilia,"" Gaines wrote on X while posting a Fox News Digital article about Ocasio-Cortez' comments. Ocasio-Cortez has taken a partisan stance in her support of transgender rights and protections.  After the Biden-Harris administration passed a sweeping reform to Title IX in April that aimed to provide more protection for gender identity in schools and universities, Ocasio-Cortez argued the reform did not go far enough in favor of transgender people and, specifically, transgender athletes who want to compete in women's sports. ""Absolutely no reason for the Biden admin to do this. It is indefensible and embarrassing. The admin can still walk this back, and they should. It’s a disgrace,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote in response to a report that the change would allow schools to bar transgender athletes from women's and girls' sports.  The administration issued a sweeping rule that clarified that Title IX’s ban on ""sex"" discrimination in schools covers discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and ""pregnancy or related conditions."" And while the administration insisted the regulation does not address athletic eligibility, multiple experts presented evidence to Fox News Digital in June that it would ultimately put more biological men in women's sports.  Still, that wasn't good enough for Ocasio-Cortez.  INSIDE SAN JOSE STATE'S POLICE BATTLE TO PROTECT WOMEN'S ATHLETES THREATENED BY A TRANSGENDER CULTURE WAR Former competitive swimmer Riley Gaines speaks during a campaign rally for former President Trump at Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale, Arizona, on Aug. 23. (Rebecca Noble/Getty Images) Ocasio-Cortez has also co-sponsored the Equality Act, which was proposed in 2019 and has had revisions that ""would force public schools to allow biologically male athletes who identify as transgender on girls' sports teams."" In March 2023, Democrats, including Ocasio-Cortez, advocated for a transgender bill of rights, proposing a resolution ""recognizing that it is the duty of the Federal Government to develop and implement a Transgender Bill of Rights.""  The resolution specifically called for a federal law to ensure that biological men can ""participate in sports on teams and in programs that best align with their gender identity [and] use school facilities that best align with their gender identity."" Meanwhile, Gaines has passionately fought against trans inclusion in women's sports as a former college swimmer who infamously tied with trans athlete Lia Thomas at the NCAA championships in 2022.  Gaines shared her harrowing recollection of her experience being forced to share a locker room with Thomas at a Trump campaign rally on Oct. 23.  ""I could share the grotesque details of what it was like being forced to undress, inches away from a 6-foot-4 man who watched us strip down to nothing, while he did the same, exposing his fully-intact naked male body,"" Gaines said. ""There are no words to describe the violation and the betrayal, the humiliation that we felt.""  Gaines leads a lawsuit against the NCAA with other female athletes, accusing the governing body of violating their Title IX rights due to its policies on gender identity.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Riley Gaines is sworn in during a House Oversight Subcommittee on Health Care and Financial Services hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 5, 2023. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, details the shock Gaines and other swimmers felt when they learned they would have to share a locker room with Thomas at the 2022 championships in Atlanta. It documents a number of races they swam with Thomas, including the 200-yard final in which Thomas and Gaines tied for fifth but Thomas, not Gaines, was handed the fifth-place trophy. Meanwhile, many other Democrats have backed off from their support for transgender inclusion in women's sports prior to and after the election.  Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass, and Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., spoke out against trans inclusion in a New York Times article.  Moulton's comments have incited a flury of backlash against him from Democratic allies who have deemed his words ""transphobic.""

Seth Moulton, D-Mass., said Tuesday that the Democratic Party was 'talking down' to Americans in response to backlash over his recent comments about transgender women in sports. Massachusetts Democrats are planning a rally for transgender rights after Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., spoke out against trans athletes in women's sports.  The rally will take place on Sunday in Moulton's hometown of Salem, where he was born in 1978, according to Salem City Councilor Kyle Davis.  ""In the wake of Trump's election and Seth Moulton's recent transphobic comments, I am working with local LGBT organizations and local leaders on a large rally in Salem outside of Moulton's office,"" Davis told Fox News Digital.  ""This rally is meant to express first and foremost to the trans community that we stand in solidarity with them but also to communicate to Seth Moulton that we do not agree with his stance and his willingness to throw this community under the bus.""

Moulton spoke out against his own party for making too much of an effort to champion for trans inclusion in women's sports, and blamed it as a reason for losing the election.  ""I have two little girls. I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I’m supposed to be afraid to say that,"" Moulton said.  Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., also spoke out against trans inclusion in the same article.  Moulton has since defended and doubled-down on his comments amid the backlash by his own party.  Davis previously called for Moulton to resign in a post on X.  ""I’m not looking for an apology from [Moulton], I’m looking for a resignation,"" Davis said. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., called the remarks ""offensive"" during a recent interview on CNN. Meanwhile, Massachusetts state Rep.

The source told Fox News Digital, however, that Moulton’s office had been contacted by Tufts University Political Science Department Chair David Art on the matter. Moulton addressed the alleged issue with Tufts on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""Imagine if one of these Tuft students actually wants to intern in a Republican office? I mean, what would these political science professors do then? This is just everything that is wrong with this cancel culture,"" Moulton responded.

Ocasio-Cortez called the ticket ""predatory"" in response to Ware's stance. In June, a survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago asked respondents to weigh in on whether transgender athletes of both sexes should be permitted to participate in sports leagues that correspond to their preferred gender identity instead of their biological sex.  Sixty-five percent answered that it should be never or rarely allowed. When those polled were asked specifically about adult transgender female athletes competing on women’s sports teams, 69% opposed it.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Packers legend Clay Matthews admits Aaron Rodgers' struggles with Jets have been 'hard to watch' this season,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/packers-legend-clay-matthews-admits-aaron-rodgers-struggles-jets-has-been-hard-watch-season,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 14:24:24 -0500","Clay Matthews, the Packers Hall of Famer who spent many years terrorizing teams with Aaron Rodgers, admits it&apos;s been frustrating to watch his old teammate with the New York Jets.","Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. For 10 seasons, Clay Matthews and Aaron Rodgers were key members of the Green Bay Packers, leading the way on their respective sides of the ball.  Matthews, the feared outside linebacker who was inducted into the Packers Hall of Fame, has since retired from the game. But Rodgers, the four-time MVP quarterback, continues playing with the New York Jets.  The success these two had together — a Super Bowl in 2011 included — is a departure from what Rodgers is seeing in New York. The Jets have not lived up to the hype since he was traded from Green Bay to New York last season.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Green Bay Packers linebacker Clay Matthews, left, points to Super Bowl MVP Aaron Rodgers after giving him a championship belt after the win against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Super Bowl at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, Feb. 6, 2011. (Imagn) Matthews spoke to Fox News Digital this week, admitting it's hard to watch his friend and former teammate struggle.  ""It is tough for me to watch because there’s no bigger fan of Aaron than me,"" Matthews said while also discussing his upcoming appearance at Lambeau Field with the Crown Royal Rig Thanksgiving Day. ""I enjoy watching the Jets. Obviously, Davante’s been over there. I mean, they have star power up and down the offense, but, unfortunately, they just haven’t been clicking. It’s hard to watch."" With Rodgers healed from his Achilles injury suffered on the fourth snap of the 2023 season, the expectation was the Jets would break out of their 13-year playoff drought.  AARON RODGERS PINPOINTS JETS' BIGGEST HURDLE: ‘IT’S US AGAINST US' Instead, they find themselves at 3-7 through 10 games, needing to virtually win out to have a legitimate shot at doing so.  As Matthews mentioned, the star power is vast when it comes to the Jets' offense, with Davante Adams, an old friend of theirs from the Packers, the latest to join the group after a trade with the Las Vegas Raiders.  But the old connection that was so lethal in Green Bay with Rodgers has yet to break out with the Jets. And prior to Adams' arrival, Rodgers just hasn't found the consistency he'd like, and the record shows it.  The Jets are 26th in total offense (298.5 yards per game) and 17th in passing yards per game (211.7). New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers throws against the Arizona Cardinals during the first half Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Glendale, Ariz.  (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson) As Rodgers said on his weekly appearance on ""The Pat McAfee Show,"" the Jets' biggest hurdle is ""it's us against us,"" and Matthews knows Rodgers will be trying to lead by example behind closed doors.  ""I'm not sure much words are going to help,"" Matthews said.  ""I think he’s just staying the course. I mean, for a guy who’s a 20-year vet, he’s been through everything. He’s battle tested, and he’s obviously still one of the best. He can make all the throws. So, I don’t know what the moral needs to be. You constantly hear the quotes of them coming out flat and what not. At this point, I’m not sure much words are going to help as far as, ‘We need to pick it up.’  ""The Jets, it’s been a while since they’ve been in the playoffs.  It’s been a while since I’m sure they’ve had a winning season. It needs to change, but, unfortunately, I don’t know if this is the year. Perhaps maybe they pick it up towards the latter part, but it’s tough sledding when the future looks to be bleak."" Does the future past the 2024 campaign involve Rodgers? He's under contract for the 2025 season, but none of the compensation is guaranteed. Rodgers could also choose to retire.  Matthews can't see that happening, though, especially with the way this season has been going.  Former Green Bay Packers linebacker Clay Matthews speaks during a press conference before the 2024 Packers Hall of Fame induction banquet Aug. 29, 2024, at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis. (Imagn) ""Aaron’s too much of a competitor. We’ll see how he feels. Obviously, coming back after that Achilles, it seems to be behind him now. Dealing with some knee and hamstring issues that limited his mobility,"" Matthews said. ""I know my last year in Green Bay, I wanted to come back and finish on a high note or at least continue it. As a competitor, you have to have that look in the mirror, so to speak. But I still think he can make all the throws and do what he needs to do.""  GIVING BACK WITH CROWN ROYAL While Matthews is a Jets fan when it comes to supporting Rodgers, he will always be a Packer, which is why he teamed up with Crown Royal, the official whiskey sponsor of the NFL, in its fourth year of the Kick Off with Crown program.  This year, Crown Royal launched its one-of-a-kind tailgate on wheels with the Crown Royal Rig, a purple 18-wheeler touring NFL stadiums to not just wow NFL fans with players like Matthews, but to also support the military.  Matthews talked about his excitement about not only being able to return to Lambeau to mingle with Packers fans on Thanksgiving night before his former team’s game against the Miami Dolphins, but also why this tailgate is so important. Fans will be putting together care packages for military members with Crown Royal’s longtime partner, Packages From Home. The 18-wheeler Crown Royal Rig is traveling the country to different NFL stadiums to help the military. (Crown Royal) ""I think what’s even more important is how Crown Royal is giving back to the military community, specifically with their Purple Bag Project,"" Matthews said. ""Giving away morale-boosting items to our military by giving them the packages from home.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The Packers get a primetime game on Thanksgiving.

He told Fox News Digital he is donating his paycheck to Tunnel to Towers.,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Eric Bischoff will be back and better than ever – at least for one night. The legendary pro wrestling figure will take control of the Major League Wrestling (MLW) One Shot event in New York City on Dec. 5. He told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview he would donate his entire paycheck to the Tunnel to Towers Foundation. ""One of the things I told (MLW founder Court Bauer) right away was this isn’t about the money,"" Bischoff said. ""He started to negotiate my fee and I really wasn’t interested in negotiating it, I just said whatever it is, I’m going to donate it to Tunnel to Towers. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Eric Bischoff speaks onstage at The Roast of Ric Flair at Nashville Fairgrounds on July 29, 2022 in Nashville, Tennessee.  (Jason Kempin/Getty Images) ""So, it doesn’t matter, and I don’t want to negotiate it. I just want whatever it is to be donated because I’m not doing this for the money. I’m doing it for the fun."" Bischoff will be calling the shots for the one night of pro wrestling at the Melrose Ballroom in Queens. He said he talked to Bauer for several years about doing a show with MLW, but the timing was just never right. Then, the stars aligned. Paul Walter Hauser, an actor-turned-MLW wrestler, joined Bischoff on the wrestling mogul’s YouTube show ""Life Choices."" As the two discussed the business, Hauser called Bauer live and the dominoes fell into place from there. Talented pro wrestlers have moved through the company, including Alex Shelley, Austin Aries, Lexis King (then known as Brian Pillman Jr.), Francine, Gangrel, Jacob Fatu, Karrion Kross (then known as Killer Kross), Konnan, Matt Cardona, MJF, Tajiri and several others.  FROM ACTING TO THE SQUARED CIRCLE, EMMY WINNER HAUSER IS READY TO RUMBLE FOR MAJOR LEAGUE WRESTLING Eric Bischoff was formerly the head of World Championship Wrestling. (Major League Wrestling) The roster now includes established talents like KENTA, Matt Riddle, Satoshi Kojima, Mistico, Minoru Suzuki, Bobby Fish and The Andersons, among others. Donovan Dijak also made his debut with the company over the summer after his contract with WWE was not renewed. ""They’re obviously attracting some great talent. Court, as a former writer in WWE, understands the art of storytelling. I love the fact that they’re the underdog, and they’re kind of, of course, building this brand from the ground up. ""And, I love watching emerging companies – whether it’s in the wrestling business or anything else. I’m just fascinated with the prospect of MLW growing and reaching the next level or whatever it may be for them."" Bischoff has been behind some of the most interesting creative angles in pro wrestling history, as he helped establish the New World Order faction in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), which saw Hulk Hogan go from the good guy to a heel, joining the likes of Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, collectively known as The Outsiders. The decision sparked the ""Monday Night Wars"" with WWE (then known as the World Wrestling Federation) and put WCW on top for more than a year in the ratings battle. In the end, WCW flamed out, but Bischoff’s influence in the business was far from cooled. He joined WWE to become the on-air general manager of the RAW brand and was also an executive producer for Total Nonstop Action wrestling. EX-WWE STAR DONOVAN DIJAK MAKES ELECTRIC MAJOR LEAGUE WRESTLING DEBUT: 'EXECUTION WAS FLAWLESS' Eric Bischoff will take over creative for Major League Wrestling for one night. (Major League Wrestling) Bischoff told Fox News Digital he is already starting to enjoy getting back into the creative aspect of the wrestling business and is looking forward to creating a show. It does not exactly mean he is looking for a return in the long run. ""I don’t even think about that,"" he said. ""One of the things I told Court is that for me to do something in wrestling now, it has to be fun. If it’s not fun for me, if it’s just a job, or if it’s just a payday, I’m really not that interested. … When it comes to putting my toe back in the water in wrestling, my first priority is that it has to be fun. If it’s not fun, I’m not interested. ""So it all depends. I honestly, to be very transparent about it, I can’t see it. I like my life just the way it is. I live in a beautiful part of the country out in the middle of nowhere where I can look out my back window and see Yellowstone National Park. …  ""So, for me to commit – just committing to professional wrestling is 24 hours, seven days a week. If you’re not doing it, you’re thinking about it. If you’re not thinking about it, you’re worrying about it. If you’re not worrying about it, you’re sleeping. It’s hard for me to imagine. But again, it depends how much fun I have. If it’s successful and everybody, not just me, but if the audience enjoys, if Court and his team – most importantly- enjoy the process, then, you know, anything’s possible. But highly unlikely. Let’s put it that way."" Eric Bischoff attends SiriusXM's ""Busted Open"" celebrating their 10th anniversary In New York City on the eve of WrestleMania 35 on April 6, 2019 in New York City.

On Thursday, November 14, the NLL unveiled 13 new community identities for its UnBOXed program, which aims to introduce young boys and girls to the game of lacrosse in their gym classes. These are not expansion teams, but the NLL hopes these identities and community-relevant names will help engage people in these markets and encourage them to participate in the UnBOXed program. They also hope they “illustrate the League’s commitment to growing box lacrosse across Canada and the United States” as they work toward their goal of becoming the “next major league.” “NLL UnBOXed illustrates our bold approach and dedicated commitment to growing the game of lacrosse and welcoming new NLL fans to our uniquely entertaining sport. As we invite and welcome more communities, schools, families, and fans to the NLL, while strengthening our connections in these key areas throughout North America, we move one step closer to our goal of becoming ‘The Next Major League.’” The NLL hopes to expand its activation footprint to 60 communities across North America by the time the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles roll around. Those games will include sixes lacrosse — a format similar to the box lacrosse played in the NLL — as a medal sport for the first time since 1908. The NLL is also part of the Elevate 28 initiative, which aims to increase the number of people participating in lacrosse in the U.S. to 4 million by 2030. The 13 new UnBOXed identities, combined with the 14 current NLL franchises, bring the league’s total activation footprint to 36 markets throughout North America. Here’s a closer look at the new identities, with all graphics courtesy of the NLL’s Facebook page: The initial nine UnBOXed identities were launched in November 2023. Since then, though, the St. Louis entry changed its name from the Rhythm to the Howlers, and with the Ottawa Black Bears joining the NLL, the Ottawa Electrics became the Dallas Oilcats, an identity that uses elements of the now-defunct Panther City Lacrosse Club logo. The 2024-25 NLL regular season gets underway on Friday, November 29, with two games. A new Battle of Ontario will spark up with the Ottawa Black Bears playing host to the Toronto Rock, while the Vancouver Warriors visit the Colorado Mammoth later that evening.",2024-11-14

The Nittany Lions launched the uniforms on their website and social media channels on Wednesday, November 13, and will wear them on the ice for the first time against Big Ten rivals Wisconsin on Friday, November 15. The jerseys borrow heavily from the Nittany Lions’ look in the 1940s, when Penn State’s hockey program was first founded. The white base has navy blue shoulders and a navy blue “PS” monogram on the front. Navy barberpole-style stripes adorn the sleeves and the socks. The navy blue numbers on the sleeves and back “mimics the number font used on the Generations of Greatness football jerseys,” while the contrasting nameplate on the back is navy blue with white lettering. The retro look is rounded out by brown pants and gloves. The pants also feature an interlocking “PSU” logo used in the 1970s that has a puck between the P and the S. The helmets are navy blue, with a raised white “Penn State” logo on the sides and white player numbers on the front. For captains, the C appears in a navy blue keystone on the right chest. “Penn State’s ice hockey tradition began well before we ever had a Division I program and we owe a debt of gratitude to those previous eras for establishing the foundation of Hockey Valley,” Nittany Lions head coach Guy Gadowsky said on the team’s website. “These throwback uniforms represent the different periods that helped build our program into what it is today and it’s our way of giving those teams a stick tap to the shins to express our appreciation to everyone that laid the foundation for the modern era of Penn State Hockey.” Old Time Hockey! 😤#HockeyValley pic.twitter.com/chvGMCj1wN Penn State played its first varsity hockey game on December 6, 1940, against Carnegie Tech. The program continued for four seasons until it was cut — along with cross country, swimming, gymnastics, tennis and golf — as part of cost-cutting measures during the Second World War. It returned for one season in 1946, but limited facilities meant it was once again dropped. In 1971, 3,000 people signed a petition to bring hockey back to Penn State. The team — dubbed the Icers — played 41 seasons and won seven national championships before the Division I era began in 2012. As a pure “start-up” team, it seemed too gaudy for them to display the name Penn State on the first jerseys. Thus, a custom logo was designed as a unique moniker for the front of the jersey. A creative, stylized amalgamation of letters and hockey imagery, the logo features the initials of Penn State University with two hockey sticks surrounding a puck in the negative space between the letters. The artist responsible for the design, a Penn State student, has remained anonymous despite multiple efforts. Following Friday’s game against Wisconsin — the first of a six-game homestand for Penn State — these alternate uniforms will enter their jersey lineup “as a true alternate to be worn multiple times throughout the next few seasons.”",2024-11-14

Valencia players will wear their black away kits at home on Saturday, November 23, when they host Real Betis. The all-black uniform is meant as “a sign of respect for those who died due to the DANA catastrophe and in solidarity with all those affected.” More than 200 people in the Valencia region died in late October when a destructive weather system known locally as DANA — the Spanish acronym for high-altitude isolated depression — moved through the area, causing torrential rainfall and massive flooding. Valencia’s usual front-of-shirt sponsor has given up their space for the November 23 game, and their logo will be replaced by the motto “AMUNT VALENCIANS” (“Come on, Valencians”). Printed on the back, below the player number, will be another motto: “UNITS CON SEMPRE” (“United as Always”). The black away kit, made by Puma, features an embossed pattern that reimagines the city of Valencia’s flag and its “distinctive blue band filigree as a subtle background pattern on a sleek black shirt with elegant gold accents.” Game-worn jerseys will be auctioned off online afterwards through MatchWornShirt. Proceeds from the auction will go to “help resume sporting and educational activities for children affected by the DANA crisis.” The game against Real Betis will be Valencia CF’s first match since the DANA tragedy. An away match against RCD Espanyol scheduled for Sunday, November 9, was postponed. Puma and Valencia CF have also teamed up to offer a solidarity T-shirt for sale, with proceeds again going toward sports and educational activities for children affected by the storm. It features the “UNITS CON SEMPRE” motto on the front and a list of cities and towns affected by flooding on the back. The shirt is available through Valencia’s online store and through Puma.com.",2024-11-14

While several teams — including the Oklahoma City Thunder, Minnesota Timberwolves, Washington Wizards, Chicago Bulls, Houston Rockets and Los Angeles Lakers — had released their City Edition uniforms in the days and weeks prior, the NBA officially launched the program league-wide on Thursday, November 14. The league has been running the City Edition program since 2017, with every NBA team releasing a new jersey every season that celebrates “the stories, history and heritage that make each franchise unique.” According to the NBA’s LockerVision uniform schedule, the first team to break out their City Edition uniforms on the court will be the Utah Jazz, who will wear theirs tonight (Thursday, November 14) when they host the Dallas Mavericks. The Mavericks, Charlotte Hornets, Boston Celtics and Sacramento Kings will also debut their City Edition jerseys on Saturday, November 16. Images of City and Classic Edition uniforms were posted to Twitter in a massive leak back in September, and all the City Editions released Thursday match up with those leaked photos. The Jazz, meanwhile, had given fans an early look at their 2024-25 City Edition uniforms as part of a rebranding announcement in June.

That was also the first season that USC sported the trojan head logo on the sides of its cardinal helmets, as well as a modified Northwestern striping pattern on the sleeves of its cardinal home and white road jerseys. This design was worn until the 2002 season, when then-head coach Pete Carroll reintroduced the crescent-shaped shoulder design the Trojans initially wore from 1958-71 and still wear to this day. USC will wear metallic helmets with chrome face masks as a modern update to the classic look for Homecoming. #FightOn pic.twitter.com/5zP4pF6sBR This will mark the first time that USC has deviated from its standard home or road uniforms since the Trojans wore a metallic version of their cardinal helmets with chrome facemasks for select games during the 2014-15 seasons. They also added gold flakes to their standard gray facemasks in 2012, but – aside from that small detail – they have consistently worn Saturday’s throwback uniform or their current design for more than 65 years. The Trojans wore these uniforms, which are complete with their standard gold pants with two cardinal stripes down the sides, under legendary coach John Robinson (1976-82, 1993-97), who passed away on Monday at the age of 89. One of @uscfb's all-time best coaches and one of the band's all-time best friends.#FightOnForever Coach Robinson. pic.twitter.com/k89SgvvD2C He also served as USC’s offensive coordinator from 1972-74, so it’s somewhat fitting the program will wear the throwback uniforms this weekend against the Cornhuskers.

But Eberflus maintained on Monday that moving rookie No. 1 pick Caleb Williams out of the starting lineup is not one of the many changes he's considering as the Bears shift their attention to the Green Bay Packers.  ""Caleb is our starter,"" Eberflus said, but declared an evaluation of the process of almost everything the team does offensively would be evaluated on Monday. ""There's got to be a change and adjustment,"" Eberflus said. ""There's also the sight that we're 4-5, we haven't played our division yet. ... We're in the process of getting (that evaluation) done.

New England sacked Williams nine times one week after the Cardinals posted six sacks against Chicago. Offensive coordinator Shane Waldron received a vote of confidence coming out of the loss to Arizona.

All those adjustments and changes and things that we're gonna do, we're still in the evaluation phase of that,"" Eberflus said.  Eberflus, 14-29 since he was hired in 2022, is 0-4 against the Packers. His only win against the NFC North to date was 12-10 at Minnesota last season. Williams threw four touchdown passes in a Week 6 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in London and none in the three games since the bye week. He's on pace to be sacked more than 70 times, and the Bears were 1 of 14 on third down against the Patriots, producing 142 total yards and 2.4 yards per play. Williams had 69 net passing yards when the 51 yards lost on New England's quarterback sacks were eliminated. Multiple questions were directed to Eberflus on Monday about whether Waldron would call plays and even remain on his coaching staff. Waldron was selected from a pool of candidates to replace Luke Getsy as offensive coordinator. He was previously with the Seattle Seahawks from 2021-23.

Eberflus, 14-29 since he was hired in 2022, is 0-4 against the Packers. His only win against the NFC North to date was 12-10 at Minnesota last season. Williams threw four touchdown passes in a Week 6 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in London and none in the three games since the bye week. He's on pace to be sacked more than 70 times, and the Bears were 1 of 14 on third down against the Patriots, producing 142 total yards and 2.4 yards per play. Williams had 69 net passing yards when the 51 yards lost on New England's quarterback sacks were eliminated. Multiple questions were directed to Eberflus on Monday about whether Waldron would call plays and even remain on his coaching staff. Waldron was selected from a pool of candidates to replace Luke Getsy as offensive coordinator. He was previously with the Seattle Seahawks from 2021-23.

Williams and the Bears were dominated by the New England Patriots (3-7) on Sunday, Chicago's third consecutive loss, and head into Week 11 with a run of 23 consecutive possessions without a touchdown. The Bears scored three points against the Patriots, one week after putting up nine points at Arizona, and were held under 17 points for the fifth time this season. New England sacked Williams nine times one week after the Cardinals posted six sacks against Chicago. Offensive coordinator Shane Waldron received a vote of confidence coming out of the loss to Arizona.

All those adjustments and changes and things that we're gonna do, we're still in the evaluation phase of that,"" Eberflus said.  Eberflus, 14-29 since he was hired in 2022, is 0-4 against the Packers. His only win against the NFC North to date was 12-10 at Minnesota last season. Williams threw four touchdown passes in a Week 6 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in London and none in the three games since the bye week. He's on pace to be sacked more than 70 times, and the Bears were 1 of 14 on third down against the Patriots, producing 142 total yards and 2.4 yards per play. Williams had 69 net passing yards when the 51 yards lost on New England's quarterback sacks were eliminated. Multiple questions were directed to Eberflus on Monday about whether Waldron would call plays and even remain on his coaching staff. Waldron was selected from a pool of candidates to replace Luke Getsy as offensive coordinator. He was previously with the Seattle Seahawks from 2021-23.

All those adjustments and changes and things that we're gonna do, we're still in the evaluation phase of that,"" Eberflus said.  Eberflus, 14-29 since he was hired in 2022, is 0-4 against the Packers. His only win against the NFC North to date was 12-10 at Minnesota last season. Williams threw four touchdown passes in a Week 6 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in London and none in the three games since the bye week. He's on pace to be sacked more than 70 times, and the Bears were 1 of 14 on third down against the Patriots, producing 142 total yards and 2.4 yards per play. Williams had 69 net passing yards when the 51 yards lost on New England's quarterback sacks were eliminated. Multiple questions were directed to Eberflus on Monday about whether Waldron would call plays and even remain on his coaching staff. Waldron was selected from a pool of candidates to replace Luke Getsy as offensive coordinator. He was previously with the Seattle Seahawks from 2021-23.

""There's got to be a change and adjustment,"" Eberflus said. ""There's also the sight that we're 4-5, we haven't played our division yet. ... We're in the process of getting (that evaluation) done. There will be changes and adjustments being made.""  Williams and the Bears were dominated by the New England Patriots (3-7) on Sunday, Chicago's third consecutive loss, and head into Week 11 with a run of 23 consecutive possessions without a touchdown. The Bears scored three points against the Patriots, one week after putting up nine points at Arizona, and were held under 17 points for the fifth time this season. New England sacked Williams nine times one week after the Cardinals posted six sacks against Chicago. Offensive coordinator Shane Waldron received a vote of confidence coming out of the loss to Arizona. But Eberflus didn't guarantee Waldron would be calling plays when the Bears host the Packers (6-3) this Sunday. ""The process of that, we're going through that right now. All those adjustments and changes and things that we're gonna do, we're still in the evaluation phase of that,"" Eberflus said.  Eberflus, 14-29 since he was hired in 2022, is 0-4 against the Packers. His only win against the NFC North to date was 12-10 at Minnesota last season. Williams threw four touchdown passes in a Week 6 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in London and none in the three games since the bye week. He's on pace to be sacked more than 70 times, and the Bears were 1 of 14 on third down against the Patriots, producing 142 total yards and 2.4 yards per play. Williams had 69 net passing yards when the 51 yards lost on New England's quarterback sacks were eliminated. Multiple questions were directed to Eberflus on Monday about whether Waldron would call plays and even remain on his coaching staff. Waldron was selected from a pool of candidates to replace Luke Getsy as offensive coordinator. He was previously with the Seattle Seahawks from 2021-23.  ""It's important that we're using all the people in the building on the coaching staff, getting all the input, putting our minds together to come up with the best answer,"" Eberflus said.

But Eberflus didn't guarantee Waldron would be calling plays when the Bears host the Packers (6-3) this Sunday. ""The process of that, we're going through that right now. All those adjustments and changes and things that we're gonna do, we're still in the evaluation phase of that,"" Eberflus said.  Eberflus, 14-29 since he was hired in 2022, is 0-4 against the Packers. His only win against the NFC North to date was 12-10 at Minnesota last season. Williams threw four touchdown passes in a Week 6 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in London and none in the three games since the bye week. He's on pace to be sacked more than 70 times, and the Bears were 1 of 14 on third down against the Patriots, producing 142 total yards and 2.4 yards per play. Williams had 69 net passing yards when the 51 yards lost on New England's quarterback sacks were eliminated. Multiple questions were directed to Eberflus on Monday about whether Waldron would call plays and even remain on his coaching staff. Waldron was selected from a pool of candidates to replace Luke Getsy as offensive coordinator. He was previously with the Seattle Seahawks from 2021-23.  ""It's important that we're using all the people in the building on the coaching staff, getting all the input, putting our minds together to come up with the best answer,"" Eberflus said.

Williams and the Bears were dominated by the New England Patriots (3-7) on Sunday, Chicago's third consecutive loss, and head into Week 11 with a run of 23 consecutive possessions without a touchdown. The Bears scored three points against the Patriots, one week after putting up nine points at Arizona, and were held under 17 points for the fifth time this season. New England sacked Williams nine times one week after the Cardinals posted six sacks against Chicago. Offensive coordinator Shane Waldron received a vote of confidence coming out of the loss to Arizona. But Eberflus didn't guarantee Waldron would be calling plays when the Bears host the Packers (6-3) this Sunday. ""The process of that, we're going through that right now. All those adjustments and changes and things that we're gonna do, we're still in the evaluation phase of that,"" Eberflus said.  Eberflus, 14-29 since he was hired in 2022, is 0-4 against the Packers. His only win against the NFC North to date was 12-10 at Minnesota last season. Williams threw four touchdown passes in a Week 6 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in London and none in the three games since the bye week. He's on pace to be sacked more than 70 times, and the Bears were 1 of 14 on third down against the Patriots, producing 142 total yards and 2.4 yards per play. Williams had 69 net passing yards when the 51 yards lost on New England's quarterback sacks were eliminated. Multiple questions were directed to Eberflus on Monday about whether Waldron would call plays and even remain on his coaching staff. Waldron was selected from a pool of candidates to replace Luke Getsy as offensive coordinator. He was previously with the Seattle Seahawks from 2021-23.

But Eberflus didn't guarantee Waldron would be calling plays when the Bears host the Packers (6-3) this Sunday. ""The process of that, we're going through that right now. All those adjustments and changes and things that we're gonna do, we're still in the evaluation phase of that,"" Eberflus said.  Eberflus, 14-29 since he was hired in 2022, is 0-4 against the Packers. His only win against the NFC North to date was 12-10 at Minnesota last season. Williams threw four touchdown passes in a Week 6 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in London and none in the three games since the bye week. He's on pace to be sacked more than 70 times, and the Bears were 1 of 14 on third down against the Patriots, producing 142 total yards and 2.4 yards per play. Williams had 69 net passing yards when the 51 yards lost on New England's quarterback sacks were eliminated. Multiple questions were directed to Eberflus on Monday about whether Waldron would call plays and even remain on his coaching staff. Waldron was selected from a pool of candidates to replace Luke Getsy as offensive coordinator. He was previously with the Seattle Seahawks from 2021-23.  ""It's important that we're using all the people in the building on the coaching staff, getting all the input, putting our minds together to come up with the best answer,"" Eberflus said.

Williams and the Bears were dominated by the New England Patriots (3-7) on Sunday, Chicago's third consecutive loss, and head into Week 11 with a run of 23 consecutive possessions without a touchdown. The Bears scored three points against the Patriots, one week after putting up nine points at Arizona, and were held under 17 points for the fifth time this season. New England sacked Williams nine times one week after the Cardinals posted six sacks against Chicago. Offensive coordinator Shane Waldron received a vote of confidence coming out of the loss to Arizona.

All those adjustments and changes and things that we're gonna do, we're still in the evaluation phase of that,"" Eberflus said.  Eberflus, 14-29 since he was hired in 2022, is 0-4 against the Packers. His only win against the NFC North to date was 12-10 at Minnesota last season. Williams threw four touchdown passes in a Week 6 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in London and none in the three games since the bye week. He's on pace to be sacked more than 70 times, and the Bears were 1 of 14 on third down against the Patriots, producing 142 total yards and 2.4 yards per play. Williams had 69 net passing yards when the 51 yards lost on New England's quarterback sacks were eliminated. Multiple questions were directed to Eberflus on Monday about whether Waldron would call plays and even remain on his coaching staff. Waldron was selected from a pool of candidates to replace Luke Getsy as offensive coordinator. He was previously with the Seattle Seahawks from 2021-23.

But Eberflus didn't guarantee Waldron would be calling plays when the Bears host the Packers (6-3) this Sunday. ""The process of that, we're going through that right now. All those adjustments and changes and things that we're gonna do, we're still in the evaluation phase of that,"" Eberflus said.  Eberflus, 14-29 since he was hired in 2022, is 0-4 against the Packers. His only win against the NFC North to date was 12-10 at Minnesota last season. Williams threw four touchdown passes in a Week 6 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in London and none in the three games since the bye week. He's on pace to be sacked more than 70 times, and the Bears were 1 of 14 on third down against the Patriots, producing 142 total yards and 2.4 yards per play. Williams had 69 net passing yards when the 51 yards lost on New England's quarterback sacks were eliminated. Multiple questions were directed to Eberflus on Monday about whether Waldron would call plays and even remain on his coaching staff. Waldron was selected from a pool of candidates to replace Luke Getsy as offensive coordinator. He was previously with the Seattle Seahawks from 2021-23.  ""It's important that we're using all the people in the building on the coaching staff, getting all the input, putting our minds together to come up with the best answer,"" Eberflus said.

All those adjustments and changes and things that we're gonna do, we're still in the evaluation phase of that,"" Eberflus said.  Eberflus, 14-29 since he was hired in 2022, is 0-4 against the Packers. His only win against the NFC North to date was 12-10 at Minnesota last season. Williams threw four touchdown passes in a Week 6 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in London and none in the three games since the bye week. He's on pace to be sacked more than 70 times, and the Bears were 1 of 14 on third down against the Patriots, producing 142 total yards and 2.4 yards per play. Williams had 69 net passing yards when the 51 yards lost on New England's quarterback sacks were eliminated. Multiple questions were directed to Eberflus on Monday about whether Waldron would call plays and even remain on his coaching staff. Waldron was selected from a pool of candidates to replace Luke Getsy as offensive coordinator. He was previously with the Seattle Seahawks from 2021-23.  ""It's important that we're using all the people in the building on the coaching staff, getting all the input, putting our minds together to come up with the best answer,"" Eberflus said.

Now the quaint, handwritten creation he turned during an English III class at UCLA in 1940 is about to go up for sale. Weiss Auctions is offering the 15-page report—all in Robinson’s hand and complete with pictures he pasted to illustrate his conclusions—in its Fall Auction. The one-of-a-kind piece is expected to sell for $15,000-$25,000.  According to the auction company, the report was purchased years ago from the estate of long-time UCLA assistant football coach A.J. Sturzenegger and comes with a JSA Letter of Authenticity. It’s believed to be the first time it’s been offered publicly. “We are very excited to be able to handle a terrific item like this,” Weiss Auctions Founder Phil Weiss told SC Daily. ” In over 40 years in the auction business, we’ve had the opportunity to handle the sale of some very unique and significant items and this definitely would be near the top of that list.”  The auction cuts a wide swath across sports and non-sports card categories.  Collectors of pre-War vintage cards will find a group of rare 1932 US Caramel card, including Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, 1933 Goudey issues of the two Yankee sluggers and several other lots featuring tobacco cards and 1940s Play Ball.    A fully graded 1956 Topps baseball set kicks off the post-War offerings, joined by complete 1951 Red and Blue back sets and a 1963 Topps set.  There are also 1950s and 60s stars including numerous Mickey Mantle cards. Among the modern card lots is a partial PSA 9-graded set of 1993 Topps Finest Baseball.  For those who really want a trip back into cardboard nostalgia, there are 1950s Exhibit and baseball card vending machines up for grabs.  Non-sports offerings include the highest graded 1953 Topps Who-Z-At set, a 1933 Jungle Gum graded set and many other vintage TV show master sets. There are dozens of autographed items, including those penned by Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle, with several of the latter carrying inscriptions.  A 1950 Yankees team signed baseball also includes one of the first signatures of Mantle with the Bronx Bombers while a rookie year government postcard carrying his early autograph is also on the block.     Other signed items include a Ty Cobb check, a Roy Campanella signed 1956 Topps card, a Derek Jeter Little Sun Prospect signed card, an Andre the Giant signed magazine, a 1986 World Series ticket signed by Buckner and Wilson and other items. The auction is open for pre-bidding now and will close a live session on Wednesday, Nov. 20. Rich is the editor and founder of Sports Collectors Daily.

Now, redemption cards for complete sets of 1986-87 Fleer basketball are part of the 'Finale' of Jersey Fusion's ode to the original landmark product.","November 11, 2024 By Rich Mueller  Late last spring, cards from 50 complete sets of 1986-87 Fleer basketball and another hoard of 125 Michael Jordan rookie cards and stickers were put into a new product from Sportscards.com’s Jersey Fusion Line. Described as a years in the making “passion project” for company founder Bobby Poll, the Beckett encapsulated cards include small swatches of game-used gear used by the player on the card. Thousands of one card boxes were sold but six months later, the company has added some fresh content to the remaining inventory, including three redemption cards for fully PSA graded complete sets of cards and stickers, each with a Jordan rookie graded NM/MT 8.   The 1986-87 Fleer Jersey Fusion “Finale Edition” boxes also include a fourth redemption for a complete Jersey Fusion set of the 132 cards and 11 stickers that included the memorabilia pieces embedded in the holder. That set was originally pieced together by a collector who took advantage of the company’s offer last spring to trade it in for a game-worn, autographed 1991-92 Jordan jersey.  Sportscards.com is now giving that set back to the collecting community through the sales of the Finale edition. The product contains cards and memorabilia for all 131 players that were featured on the landmark Fleer set, which was the first in five years to be sold via wax packs.    At least three of the five boxes in a display case have autographed cards. Full cases contain six display cartons with a total of around 20 autographs. Some of the autographed cards carry inscriptions.  One of the biggest hits in the product One of the top pulls was an autographed Jordan rookie that carries a 9 autograph grade from Beckett and a portion of an NBA ‘Logoman’ patch from one of Jordan’s 1987-88 home uniforms. Other chase cards carry pieces of basketballs used in the NBA Finals.   Autographs from about 100 of the players in the set are possible, including Jordan, Julius Erving, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Charles Barkley and the late Bill Walton. A checklist that’s been pulled includes autographs of Erving, Bird and Johnson.  The back of each card in the product has a QR code on the reverse side that bring the collector to the site to see the original game-used  memorabilia item from which it was taken. Memorabilia used in the Jersey Fusion product came from jerseys, warm-ups, trunks, shoes, basketballs and even surfaces of NBA courts. Boxes and cases of the most recent edition are available here.  The previously released version, which still offers randomly packed Jordan rookie cards and stickers are still selling on eBay here.

The jersey, worn the day before he suited up for the last time, dates to Oct. 6, 2001.  It was one of the key items in an auction featuring items from his career that came from the late Hall of Famer’s family and were sold by The Realest, a memorabilia company that launched earlier this year.  The final games of Gwynn’s career took place slightly later than normal due to the Sept. 11 attacks. The jersey includes the American flag patch worn by on-field personnel after play resumed.  Another jersey with the flag patch, presumably from the same time period, sold for just over $5,000. Several other items sold for five-figure prices including Gwynn’s 1987 Gold Glove award ($25,001), his 1999 All-Star Game jersey ($12,555), his 1997 Silver Slugger award ($11,500) and a 1999 Padres alternate game jersey that included an inscription indicating it was from his 2,997th career hit.

Sports Collectors Daily,Kahn’s Final Football Set In 1964 Was Colorful And Loaded With Stars,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/kahns-final-football-set-in-1964-was-colorful-and-loaded-with-stars/,"Tue, 12 Nov 2024 00:30:24 +0000","Sixty years ago, Kahn's wrapped up a short run of football card set with their only full-color NFL offering.","November 11, 2024 By Bob D'Angelo  Let’s be frank: Kahn’s Wieners had a great run for enthusiastic foodie sports card collectors. In baseball, Kahn’s released sets from 1955 through 1969. The company added basketball cards to the mix in 1957, and those were issued through 1965. It was inevitable, perhaps, that the Cincinnati-based meat company would include pro football. Kahn’s produced sets from 1959 through 1964, and the final set is one of the most coveted. Kahn’s, which was founded by Elias Kahn as a meat market in 1883, became a landmark in Cincinnati. After he died in 1899, Kahn’s children founded E. Kahn’s and Sons, By 1926 it was one of the nation’s largest independent meat processing companies. The company’s slogan was  “The Wiener The World Awaited.” In the 1964 Kahn’s football set, some long-awaited technology was introduced: full-color photography.  The borderless cards measured 3 inches by 3 5/8 inches and 53 were different were on the checklist. The company’s slogan, which had appeared in a white rectangle at the bottom of the card fronts of previous Kahn’s football issues, was relegated to the backs in the 1964 set. The backs also contained statistics and brief biographical sketches.    The cards, which were not numbered, were included in select packages of the wieners and were referenced in advertising as “photos.”  For the second consecutive year, players from all 14 NFL teams were included. However, in keeping with the regional nature of the Kahn’s sets, nine cards feature members of the Cleveland Browns, who were on their way to the 1964 NFL championship. The set contains the top players of the 1960s and 19 future Hall of Famers, including Doug Atkins, Jim Brown, Mike Ditka, Paul Hornung, Sam Huff, John Henry Johnson, Alex Karras, Dick “Night Train” Lane, Jim Ringo, Joe Schmidt, Bart Starr, Fran Tarkenton, Jim Taylor, Y.A. Tittle, Johnny Unitas and Paul Warfield. The poses are classic 1960s football. Warfield’s card in the 1964 Kahn’s issue is the earliest to feature the smooth wide receiver, whose rookie card in mainstream cards was first introduced in the 1965 Philadelphia set. The cards are extremely difficult to find in high grade. Of the 1,242 cards submitted to PSA, only 17 achieved gem-mint status and 98 were PSA 9s. There are no PSA 10s of Brown and just six PSA 9s. There are also no PSA 10s of Hornung, Huff, Karras, Lane, Ringo, Schmidt, Starr, Tarkenton, Tittle and Warfield. Unitas has two gem-mint specimens and six that were graded PSA 9, along with Gary Collins and Jim Katcavage. Not surprisingly, the players with the most graded cards are Unitas (54) and Brown (43). Dallas quarterback Don Meredith, who had 20 cards from the set submitted to PSA, only had one card as high as PSA 9 and five at PSA 8. Over at SGC, only 161 cards have been submitted, and only one came back as a 10. That was of defensive back Clendon Thomas, who had a career season in 1963 when he intercepted eight passes for the Pittsburgh Steelers and was chosen for the Pro Bowl. Seven cards were graded as high as SGC 9, with Warfield’s card being one of them. Other notables at that grade included Ditka, Hornung, Katcavage and Norm Snead. The ’64 Kahn’s cards are fairly hard to locate outside the eastern third of the country. A higher grade near set–missing only one card–sold for a little over $2,400 last month.  That was a bit of a bargain.  Fewer than 100 can be found on eBay. The 1964 season was an interesting one for football. Topps lost its license for NFL trading cards and the Philadelphia Chewing Gum Corporation would issue cards that year and through 1967. In the meantime, Topps issued cards from the upstart AFL. In November 1964, the St. Louis Cardinals football team made noises about moving to Atlanta but were persuaded not to by city officials. Atlanta would get its own NFL franchise in 1966. Also in November, Frank and Martin “Buster” Loicano were convicted of accepting illegal bets on football cards while operating their coin-operated machine business. And an ad for Kahn’s Wieners in February 1964 noted that “famed economist” Nellie Oxrider recommended Kahn’s Wieners because “not only are they delicious, but digestible, too.” They were also the only meats used at the New York World’s Fair that year, the company noted. But as far as football cards were concerned, the string of Kahn’s sets was over after ’64. Bob has been a sportswriter and copy editor for more than 45 years and a blogger for two decades. He is celebrating his 60th year of card collecting, and still counts his 1965 Topps Mickey Mantle as his favorite.  You can reach him at [email protected].

The Ecuadorian Football Association announced his death on Tuesday.  Angulo was a passenger in a single-car crash southeast of Quito on Oct. 7 that killed the driver and another passenger. Angulo sustained a head injury and lung contusion and had been put in an artificial coma. He had been on loan from FC Cincinnati to Ecuadorian top-flight side LDU Quito. ""We are deeply saddened by the loss of Marco -- a husband and father, a brother and son, a friend and teammate. He was a joyful, kind young man who lit up every room he entered,"" FC Cincinnati said in a team statement. ""Our entire club grieves this tragedy, and we are thinking of and praying for his family. He was a cherished member of the FC Cincinnati family, and he will be missed."" Angulo joined Cincinnati in December 2022 from Independiente de Valle in Ecuador and was part of Cincinnati's 2023 team that won the Supporters' Shield, paying in 24 matches (nine starts) and posting two assists. He was with LDU Quito the entire 2024 season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

As part of the shakeup, offensive coordinator Shane Waldron was fired on Tuesday. Waldron received a vote of confidence eight days ago after a lopsided 29-9 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, but head coach Matt Eberflus indicated he was resigned to change on Monday.  ""After evaluating our entire operation, I decided that it is in the best interest of our team to move in a different direction with the leadership of our offense,"" Eberflus said in a statement released by the team. ""This decision was well-thought-out, one that was conducted deliberately and respectfully. I would like to thank Shane for his efforts and wish him the best moving forward."" Eberflus selected Waldron as offensive coordinator from a pool that included former Cardinals head coach Kliff Kingsbury. Eberflus was retained as head coach by general manager Ryan Poles in January following a 7-10 season. The present situation isn't entirely unfamiliar to Brown. He is being bumped into the primary play-calling role for the second consecutive season. In 2023, the 38-year-old was promoted by the Carolina Panthers with embattled coach Frank Reich giving Brown the call sheet in an effort to spare his own job and pump life into their rookie No. 1 pick at quarterback, Bryce Young.  The Bears are in a bind with the Packers (6-3) up next as confidence and production bottom out on the heels of three consecutive losses and a three-game streak during which rookie No. 1 pick Caleb Williams has zero touchdown passes.  Eberflus said Monday that Williams was safe as the starting quarterback but pointed to imminent changes around the rookie. Williams and the Bears were dominated by the New England Patriots (3-7) on Sunday. They carry a run of 23 consecutive possessions without a touchdown into Week 11 trying to keep pace with the rest of the NFC North. Eberflus is 0-4 against Green Bay in his first two seasons as Bears head coach and will see the Packers, Lions (8-1) and Vikings (7-2) twice in the final two months of the season.  The Bears have 27 total points during a three-game slide that began with rookie Jayden Daniels' 52-yard, game-winning Hail Mary on Oct. 27.  Chicago produced three points against the Patriots, putting up fewer than 17 points for the fifth time this season. New England sacked Williams nine times one week after the Cardinals posted six sacks against Chicago. Brown, a former NFL running back who broke into coaching under Sean McVay with the Rams, spent nine seasons on college football staffs including three years as Miami (Fla.) running backs coach and offensive coordinator.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Owner Jerry Jones said Prescott is set for surgery Wednesday in New York. Jones said on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas that quarterback Cooper Rush will start Monday's game against the visiting Houston Texans. Trey Lance will serve as the backup while the team is expected to add fellow quarterback Will Grier to the practice squad. Jones provided optimistic news on Prescott having his surgery in New York. ""He had a good visit last night and he wants to do that there, and he's got great medical doctors up there,"" Jones said. ""His prognosis is wonderful, it just means we're not going to have him the rest of the year."" Signed to a four-year, $240 million contract extension in September that made him the highest-paid quarterback in NFL history, Prescott threw for 1,978 yards with 11 touchdowns and eight interceptions in eight games this season.  Prescott, 31, led the NFL in completions (410) and touchdowns (36) last season. He threw for 4,516 yards in 17 games as Dallas finished the regular season 12-5. A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Prescott owns a 76-46 record in 122 career starts since being picked by Dallas in the fourth round of the 2016 NFL Draft. He has thrown for 31,437 yards with 213 touchdowns and 82 interceptions. Rush flopped in his first start of the season on Sunday, one week after Prescott sustained his injury during the third quarter of a 27-21 loss to the Atlanta Falcons.  Rush completed 13 of 26 passes for 45 yards and lost two fumbles as Dallas dropped its fourth straight game, a 34-6 setback to the Philadelphia Eagles.  Rush was replaced in the fourth quarter by Lance, who went 4-for-6 for 21 yards with an interception in his first regular-season action since being acquired by the Cowboys in 2023.   But the Cowboys (3-6) are turning back to Rush for the Monday night game against the Texans (6-4). ""Because Cooper has shown that he has the capability to compete and win games,"" Jones said. ""And he does give us our best chance. Frankly that was really an out-of-character game for him based on what we've seen.""  Rush, 30, has completed 35 of 62 passes for 212 yards and a touchdown in parts of five games this season.  He has completed 59.7 percent of his passes for 1,831 yards with nine touchdowns and six interceptions in 31 career games (seven starts) with Dallas. Grier, 29, had been with the Cowboys in 2021-22 before being released prior to the 2023 season. He completed 28 of 52 passes for 228 yards in two starts during the 2019 season with the Carolina Panthers. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Anybody that gladly took them up on the offer in a game against the Miami Dolphins ended up with indigestion. It was the offense that was supposed to carry the Rams into a new era, but Los Angeles head coach Sean McVay couldn’t get his group over the line in a 23-15 loss Monday. With a fourth consecutive victory there for the taking, the Rams did not score a touchdown behind quarterback Matthew Stafford. Any ideas of rallying from a dreadful 1-4 start and into the playoffs have been put on pause with the current 4-5 record. Stafford has played 50 regular-season games with the Rams. He has now failed to orchestrate a touchdown drive in just two of them. “It was a little bit of this and a little bit of that,” Stafford said of the team’s issues on offense. “We did some really good things and weren’t good enough in some areas. I would say that we were inconsistent.” The Rams were supposed to be about the offense this season, and if anybody wondered why, they just needed to look toward the stands Monday. All-superhero defensive tackle Aaron Donald was in attendance to watch his former teammates, looking as chiseled as ever in retirement. A young Los Angeles defense was supposed to go through growing pains this season, and the offense, filled with elite skill players, was set to move things forward. Well, if Donald was impressed with any group, it was with his former defense. Miami won with just 238 yards of total offense, well below the Rams’ 327 yards. The Dolphins got the job done despite just 208 yards passing and an interception from Tua Tagovailoa. So while the Rams have Stafford, wide receivers Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp and running back Kyren Williams, there is a new group of players looking for top billing. Edge rusher Byron Young and defensive tackle Kobie Turner played as rookies alongside Donald in his final season. Edge rusher Jared Verse and defensive tackle Braden Fiske were drafted after Donald announced that his playing days were done. The Rams already had a Fearsome Foursome in the 1960s, and while this base defense is not the same as that one, the current young group can still be known as the Ferocious Foursome as it continues to progress. Can the Rams still make the playoffs? The loss Monday gave them a playoff probability of 13 percent. Just another sign of their bad luck. Los Angeles built hopes after a rough start that was mostly due to a flood of injuries on offense, including Nacua and Kupp, not to mention multiple starters on the offensive line. But center Jonah Jackson, left guard Steve Avila and right tackle Joe Noteboom all came off injured reserve to play this week, and yet Stafford was hurried all night by a Dolphins defensive front that had underperformed this season. Stafford was sacked four times, while Nacua and Kupp combined for 16 receptions, but none for TDs. It was just one loss, and yet it seems inevitable that some kind of change is ahead for the Rams. After all, Kupp was rumored to be a trade possibility, and then the deadline passed with him still in Los Angeles. The reality is that the front office has signaled they are willing to look at any and all options to build a brighter future. For all that McVay has done in eight seasons as a head coach, he has yet to develop his own quarterback. Stafford is signed through 2026, with no indications the Rams are anywhere near moving away from their star. But he won’t play forever. In a season like this one—with games still remaining against the Philadelphia Eagles, Buffalo Bills, San Francisco 49ers and the first-place Arizona Cardinals—there is a hunger to know what happens next. “There was some execution that has to be better,” McVay said of his offense that he agreed was 'sloppy.’ “These are the things we have to clean up if we want to be the type of (effective) team from an offensive perspective.” The Rams are just 1.5 games behind the suddenly-hot Cardinals in the NFC West and a game behind the second-place 49ers. Hope remains. But as Monday showed, it’s best to be careful about what is on the menu. Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Just two months ago, the NFL world was encouraging Tagovailoa to retire after watching him curl his fingers while down on the turf following a shot to the head during a 31-10 loss to the Buffalo Bills back on September 12.  It was the third confirmed concussion that Tagovailoa has had at the professional level, and it sidelined him for four games. Tagovailoa vowed not to wear a Guardian Cap upon his return. He stuck to his word, which was all well and good, assuming that he would make some playstyle changes to get himself out of harm’s way.  So much for that. After being picked off in the second quarter of a 23-15 win over the Rams on Monday night, Tagovailoa tried to bring down Los Angeles linebacker Christian Rozeboom, who had come down with the interception. Rozeboom was running along the sideline on his return when Tagovailoa lowered his shoulder and took a knee to the side of the head. The Miami signal-caller ended up being just fine, even sharing a few light moments with reporters following the game when asked about the tackle. “I went up to that dude that intercepted me and asked him, ‘Like bro, you couldn’t (of) just ran out of bounds or like cut back?’ … He told me after the game, he’s like, ‘There’s no room, there was nowhere else to go,’” Tagovailoa said. “He gotta do what he gotta do to help his team win games. “I wasn’t planning on using my head to go hit him, so.” Throughout his explanation of how things went down, Tagovailoa couldn’t stop smiling, even laughing at times—because what could possibly be funnier than another traumatic brain injury, right?  Dolphins coaches need to start getting some of the blame here, too. To continuously let Tagovailoa go out there and throw himself headfirst at opposing defenses is just plain irresponsible.  It needs to be made clear to Tagovailoa that he quite literally cannot suffer another concussion. Not only would that one likely be career-ending, but it could also be life-altering, both mentally and physically. Surely these conversations have been had—or at least we hope that’s the case—but it looks like the message still hasn’t gotten through. Something tells us we haven’t seen Tagovailoa get knocked out for the last time. The saddest part? No one is going to intervene. Miami isn’t going to bench the 26-year-old, and the NFL certainly isn’t going to step in. For a league that says it cares so much about the health of its players, here’s a chance to possibly save one, and all it’s going to do is look the other way. We obviously hope Tagovailoa cleans up his game in such a way that will prevent a major head injury from ever happening again. But when he—and everyone else around him—seemsly embraces recklessness, it feels like another disaster is bound to happen.

After missing the preseason and first nine games of the regular season, Joel Embiid is set to suit up for the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday for the first time in 2024-25. That’s arguably the greatest area of intrigue at the dawn of the NBA Cup, an in-season tournament that will contest group play on Tuesdays and Fridays from today through Dec. 3 to decide an elimination bracket later that month. We look at the start of the event as well as a showdown between NHL Eastern Conference contenders and a juicy piece of college football MACtion. Let’s go. Embiid may have returned sooner from a left knee injury, but he racked up a three-game suspension for shoving a Philadelphia Inquirer columnist. The transgression? Name-dropping Embiid’s son and late brother in a column, calling into question his ability to stay in shape. Now the star center gets the chance to take out frustration on a Knicks team that eliminated Philly from the playoffs last season. Embiid likely will be on a minutes restriction, but his track record for efficiency and the struggling Sixers’ urgency could equal instant contribution. Limited to 39 games last season due to injury, Embiid shot 52.9 percent—including 38.8 percent from deep—while averaging a career-best 34.7 points. Look for Embiid to be a force near the rim but also hone his perimeter game away from the bump-and-shove.

The defending Stanley Cup champion Panthers have won seven straight and their 23 points are one clear of the Devils for tops in the Eastern Conference. New Jersey was blanked for the second time in five games during Sunday’s 1-0 home loss to San Jose, unable to solve former Devil Mackenzie Blackwood in a 44-save shutout. The Panthers needed a shootout to defeat the visiting Philadelphia Flyers on Saturday, the first time in their current tear that they didn’t prevail by at least two goals. Florida leading scorer Sam Reinhart had an assist to stretch his points streak to seven games and is eager to get another crack at New Jersey. He scored four goals in three games against the Devils last season.

The same Huskies who upset then-No. 5 Notre Dame in September had since lost three conference games. Their triumph over the Broncos tightened the sprint for a spot in the league championship game in Detroit on Dec. 7, which goes to the top two schools in the MAC. Western Michigan and Bowling Green are among four teams with one loss, with two others one game behind. Unfortunately for the Broncos, the NIU game wasn’t an anomaly for the defense. Western Michigan has permitted at least 24 points in four of its five conference contests. The Huskies gained 255 of their 411 yards on the ground while throwing just three incompletions. Now comes a Bowling Green attack that features the MAC’s top receiver in Harold Fannin Jr. (73 catches, 1,033 yards, six touchdowns) and averages 378.1 yards—slightly behind Western Michigan’s league-best 406.8. Connor Bazelak has passed for 2,022 yards, third most in the conference, and will oppose a counterpart in the Broncos’ Hayden Wolff, who’ll be primed for a rebound. Expect offense aplenty.

After suffering a 35-6 loss to then-No. 6 Penn State last Saturday in the Nittany Lions' annual white-out game in University Park, Pa., Washington will return home for its own black-out night when they take on UCLA (4-5 overall, 3-4 Big Ten) on Friday in Seattle. The usually purple-clad Huskies (5-5, 3-4) instead will don black uniforms, and fans are also encouraged to wear black. ""Some great uniforms coming out,"" Washington coach Jedd Fisch said. ""So excited about that."" The Huskies this season have played in a black-out at Rutgers (Sept. 27), a stripe-out at Iowa (Oct. 12) and a red-out at Indiana (Oct. 26) before last Saturday's white-out. They lost all of those games, although they are 5-0 at Husky Stadium. Washington likely needs to defeat UCLA to become bowl eligible as its last game of the regular season is Nov. 30 at No. 1 Oregon. The Huskies have had a short turnaround after not getting back to Seattle until 5 a.m. Sunday following their game at Penn State. ""Short week, a little bit of a cram session,"" Fisch said. ""But as I told the staff, ‘Sleep Saturday.'"" Quarterback Will Rogers is expected to start against UCLA after getting benched at halftime last weekend for Demond Williams Jr.  ""Will was a victim of circumstances, a little bit,"" Fisch said. ""He was 10-for-13 in the first half, just we weren't able to get anything going."" The Bruins have won three in a row, including a 20-17 decision against visiting Iowa last Friday. They have games remaining against rival Southern California and Fresno State as they try to qualify for a bowl game. The win over the Hawkeyes was UCLA's first in four tries at the Rose Bowl this season. ""I didn't want to make too big of a deal about us being back home, but we kind of treated this game like a road game,"" Bruins coach Deshaun Foster said. ""I just think my guys, they came out and they earned the right to win. Just in how they practiced (last) week and I think as long as we continue to do that, this team can really just take off."" UCLA quarterback Ethan Garbers started his collegiate career at Washington in 2020 -- he was named the Huskies' offensive scout squad MVP -- before transferring to Westwood the next year.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Louisiana won its most recent game, however the Ragin' Cajuns coach wasn't totally satisfied. Both teams are focused on early-season improvement ahead of their game Wednesday night in Houston. Houston (1-1) dropped to No. 8 in the Associated Press Top 25 poll after a 74-69 home loss to then-No. 11 Auburn last Saturday. The Cougars opened the season with a 97-40 victory against outmanned Jackson State, prompting coach Kelvin Sampson to say that he wanted his team to be challenged in its second game. ""This team needed to be tested,"" Sampson said. ""That's why we scheduled the game. You have wins and losses, but you also have wisdom and learning. This was a learning night for us."" Sampson said his team had its lofty ranking because of its ""rebounding and transition defense."" But those areas weren't advantages against the lengthy and athletic Tigers. Auburn outscored Houston 14-10 in fast-break points, including a 12-3 edge while it outscored the Cougars 46-36 in the second half. The teams each had 33 rebounds. ""We got exposed in some areas that we've got to go back and figure out how we can get better and clean up some things,"" Sampson said. ""This is a great learning tool for us. We weren't very good offensively in a lot of ways, but their defense had a lot to do with that. ""We hope we can learn from a loss to a really good team. There is no shame on our side."" J'Wan Roberts was one of five Houston players to score in double figures. He finished with 12 points along with seven rebounds. ""I don't think this game defines our season,"" Roberts said. ""When we look at the film there's a lot of stuff we've got to work on to try and get better for the next game."" The next game is against Louisiana (1-1), which defeated visiting UT Dallas 82-65 last Thursday. ""We showed some inconsistency,"" Ragin' Cajuns coach Bob Marlin said. ""It's a learning process. We had our moments each half offensively and defensively. And then the second half I thought we did a pretty good job pressuring the ball and defensively we got off to a better start."" Marlin said his team had too many unforced errors among its 14 turnovers and he was ""really disappointed"" in its 3-point shooting (4 of 21). ""We've got to do a better job of shooting the ball,"" Marlin said, but he added that his team's shortcomings were overcome by preventing its opponent from taking full advantage. UT Dallas, which made 7 of 28 3-pointers, turned the ball over 24 times and Louisiana had a 30-9 advantage in points off turnovers. ""(The Ragin' Cajuns) are disappointed because they know they're better than they played,"" Marlin said, ""but we're still growing as a team."" The game against Houston will be a far greater challenge for Louisiana, which opened the season with a 70-66 home loss to Kent State on Nov. 4. ""We'll learn more when we go to Houston,"" Marlin said. ""It'll be a super tough game. They're one of the most physical teams in the country, if not the most physical."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

UConn coach Danny Hurley said he will be looking for a better effort than the one his team put forth in Saturday night's 92-53 victory over New Hampshire. The Huskies (2-0) held just an 11-point halftime lead in that game.   ""I said to those guys in the locker room, ‘You won by 39 points, but the reality of the situation is that game was below brand for us for a considerable amount of time,'"" Hurley said. ""The standard is high here. That was clearly a below-standard performance for us in a number of ways, in particular on-ball defense. ... I thought there were some good things, but for the most part it was a frustrating game.   ""We've got some young guys who are gonna get better defensively who right now are not good defensive players. These games early in the year are important to learn lessons and develop and get better.""   Senior forward Alex Karaban has led the Huskies in scoring in each of their first two games. He had 20 points in a 92-56 season-opening victory against Sacred Heart and 17 versus New Hampshire. He's averaging 5.5 assists and 5.5 blocks per game.   ""Alex is playing the way a Big East Player of the Year is supposed to be playing from a statistical standpoint, an efficiency standpoint, but he's also been super vocal and doing everything we want him to do right now,"" Hurley said.    Le Moyne (1-2) is in its second season as a Division I program. The Dolphins moved from Division II to the Northeast Conference before last season. Le Moyne opened its season with an 86-82 loss to Syracuse and a 97-75 setback to Cal State Northridge before rebounding to record a 107-73 victory over Division III SUNY Poly on Saturday.   Injuries have prevented Le Moyne from having its complete team available for a game this season. Guard AJ Dancler missed the Dolphins' first two games, and guard Robby Carmody -- who began his career at Notre Dame -- played in the loss to Syracuse but has missed the past two games with a leg injury. In addition, fifth-year guard Darrick Jones Jr. missed the Syracuse game, but came off the bench against Northridge.   ""At the end of the day we have to do a better job defensively and we know that,"" Le Moyne coach Nate Champion said following Saturday's win. ""We have to continue to get better as a team defensively and buy-in to that mindset.   ""(UConn is) a really good team. Hopefully we'll be ready to go. Hopefully we can perform at a high level again.""   Dwayne Koroma, a 6-foot-8 forward who started his career at Iona after being recruited by Rick Pitino, led the Dolphins with 17 points and six rebounds against SUNY Poly.    ""I think we're building the right culture here,"" Koroma said. ""I think we have a super-selfless group of guys. Everybody plays for each other.   ""A lot of (people) didn't expect us to have the performance we had against Syracuse, either. It doesn't matter if we're banged up or not, we're going to play as hard as we can and try to come out with a win.""   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

After Vancouver's most recent outing, which continued the club's home-ice struggles, the Canucks could use it. Lekkerimaki, who was selected 15th overall in that draft, will be counted on to provide some of the scoring punch lost with Brock Boeser on the shelf due to a suspected concussion.  Lekkerimaki, 20, collected five goals and two assists in seven games for Abbotsford of the American Hockey League before being summoned. He practiced on a line with J.T. Miller and Pius Suter on Monday. ""I'm not nervous right now, but probably get (nervous) the same day or a few hours before the game,"" Lekkerimaki said. ""I will just try to play my game. But at the same time, the first NHL game is special, so try to enjoy it, too. Just have fun and enjoy every second, on and off the ice."" The Canucks, who have only one win in six home games (1-2-3), saw their three-game winning streak snapped by a 7-3 thrashing from the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday. Struggling forward Elias Pettersson registered his first multi-point performance of the season with one goal and one assist. The Canucks likely will turn to goaltender Arturs Silovs, who had some mop-up duty after Kevin Lankinen surrendered all seven goals. ""We wanted to get him in a game and we'll go from there,"" coach Rick Tocchet said.  The Flames arrive after skating to a 3-1 win over the Los Angeles Kings at home on Monday night. ""There was a lot of good from a lot of players. There's not a lot I can be overly critical of. It was a pretty solid 60 minutes,"" coach Ryan Huska said. Goaltender Dustin Wolf turned in a sparkling 28-save performance. His shutout bid was quashed in the final minutes, but the victory was a solid effort through the lineup. ""I think everyone, as a whole, just shut them down,"" Wolf said. ""Any chances they had, I was able to see, for the most part. I'm just trying to help keep pucks out of our net and if we score one more than they do, then we're going to be in pretty good hands."" The Flames finished a three-game Eastern road swing before returning home to face the Kings. While it will be a mean feat to rack up another victory on the West Coast, Calgary did show the blueprint in beating the Kings. The Flames controlled play from the start, were rewarded offensively and continued to hold momentum with a patient game that included a smart forecheck. ""We needed to start on time and be all over them, and that's what we did. Doing that all over them wears them down,"" forward Jonathan Huberdeau said. ""Scoring two quick goals and taking advantage (of the first period edge in play), we deserved it the way we were working. We needed to capitalize, and that's what we did, and after that, we didn't look back."" Calgary won the first meeting of the season between the Pacific Division rivals, a 6-5 overtime clash to open the season, in a game in which the Flames trailed 3-0 midway through the first period.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

After a disappointing loss to Austin Peay their last time out, Bulldogs coach Thad Matta inserted Augusto Cassia into the starting line-up looking for a quick start, and he responded with a career high 16. Butler was also looking to cut down on turnovers after committing 35 in their first two games. Butler only committed 11 on the night. Donovan Williams led Western Michigan with 17 points and nine rebounds, while teammate JaVaughn Hannah chipped in 15 points. The Broncos shot 4-for-22 from 3-point range. Western Michigan opened with five straight points to start the contest with Hannah hitting a fall-away jumper and a 3-pointer from the wing. That would be the Broncos biggest lead of the night. Still, the first half saw the teams trading baskets. The game was tied 11 times in the first half and saw seven lead changes. Butler led 39-37 at halftime. The Bulldogs opened the second half hot. Cassia started things with a dunk on an alley-oop. Finley Bizjack added a driving basket and the Bulldogs went on a 16-2 run over a four-minute span to make it 55-39. Western Michigan responded with a 15-2 burst capped by a jumper from the elbow by Strickland with 11:11 to pull to 57-54, but Butler dominated the final minutes.

Dallas, which entered Monday with just 39 goals in 13 games, feasted on the league's third-worst scoring defense. The Stars' six-goal first period tied the then-Minnesota North Stars, who also scored six in the first 20 minutes in a 7-2 win over the Los Angeles Kings on March 16, 1971. The half-dozen goals that got past Joel Blomqvist and Alex Nedeljkovic on just 12 shots were also the most Pittsburgh ever allowed in the first period at home. Five Stars players recorded two or more points in the barrage, with Marchment (one goal, three assists) tying a team record with four points in one period. That occurred 10 times previously, with Tyler Seguin and Valeri Nichushkin both accomplishing the feat most recently against Philadelphia on Dec. 7, 2013. Canadiens 7, Sabres 5 Montreal outlasted host Buffalo with two-goal efforts from Cole Caufield and Nick Suzuki, while Suzuki added two assists and Juraj Slafkovsky tallied three assists. Caufield helped put an end to the Canadiens' six-game losing skid as he struck on the power play with 7:02 left in the third period to record his second goal of the contest and the eventual game-winner. Sabres star Tage Thompson scored his team-leading 11th goal of the season, but left the game early in the second period with a lower-body injury. Flyers 4, Sharks 3 (SO) Matvei Michkov and Travis Konecny both scored in regulation and again in the shootout as Philadelphia wasted a three-goal lead before prevailing over visiting San Jose. Erik Johnson also scored while Samuel Ersson made 28 saves for the Flyers, who are 2-0-1 in their past three games. Michkov, a healthy scratch in each of the previous two games, finished with a goal and an assist before his shootout tally. Jack Thompson, Mikael Granlund and Barclay Goodrow scored for the Sharks, who had won five of their previous seven games. William Eklund logged two assists, Granlund added an assist and Vitek Vanecek made 40 saves for San Jose. Hurricanes 5, Golden Knights 2 Jordan Staal, Eric Robinson and Jesperi Kotkaniemi each had a goal and an assist as Carolina handed Vegas its first home loss of the season, prevailing in Las Vegas. Tyson Jost and Jordan Martinook also scored goals for the Hurricanes, who picked up their ninth win in the past 10 games. Pyotr Kochetkov made 30 saves. Jack Eichel had a goal and an assist and Ivan Barbashev also scored for Vegas, which had a franchise-record-tying eight-game home winning streak snapped. Adin Hill stopped 17 of 21 shots before being replaced by Akira Schmid, who finished with 12 saves in his Golden Knights debut. Avalanche 3, Predators 2 (OT) Samuel Girard scored at 2:47 of overtime as Colorado beat Nashville in Denver. Mikko Rantanen and Devon Toews also scored and Alexandar Georgiev turned away 29 shots for the Avalanche, who have won two in a row. Luke Evangelista and Colton Sissons scored for the Predators, and Saros finished with 29 saves. Nashville fell to 1-3-1 in the past five games.

The Lumberjacks come into the game against the Cardinal having scored more than 100 points in each of their two home games against non-Division I competition. They beat Park-Gilbert, an NAIA school, by a score of 100-49 and defeated Nelson (Arizona) of the National Christian Collegiate Athletic Association by a final of 115-67. Northern Arizona followed a 52-point first half vs. Nelson on Friday by scoring 63 in the second half. ""I thought we played well (against the Lions), coming out of the half we figured it out and ... that says a lot about the young men in that locker room,"" said Northern Arizona coach Shane Burcar, whose team was led by Trent McLaughlin's 30 points. Playing Stanford on the road will be a challenge, as the Cardinal are coming off home routs of Division I opponents Denver and Cal State Fullerton. Stanford defeated Denver 85-62 in the season opener, and then beat Fullerton 80-53 on Friday. Benny Gealer (20 points) and Jaylen Blakes (18) each recorded career-high scoring totals in the win over the Titans. Gealer, a junior, scored all of his points in the second half while making six 3-pointers. Blakes is a graduate transfer from Duke who also had five assists with no turnovers. Cal State Fullerton mustered only two assists in the game while committing 14 turnovers. ""Really pleased with the way our guys competed,"" Stanford first-year coach Kyle Smith said. ""We were relentless defensively I felt the whole game. Holding a team to two assists is just good. Period. ""I'd say that's part of our identity. When we get tired, we gotta defend, we gotta create an identity. We're gonna be stingy."" Gealer leads Stanford with an average of 16 points a game. Senior forward Maxime Raynaud, who entered the transfer portal after last season but decided to return, is averaging 15 points and 13 rebounds. McLaughlin is putting up 28.5 points and 3.5 steals per game for Northern Arizona. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Cleveland continued the best start in franchise history with its 12th victory in as many games. The Cavaliers trailed by nine points in the third quarter but recovered to keep coach Kenny Atkinson unblemished in his first season on the Cavaliers' bench. Mitchell drilled seven 3-pointers and had eight rebounds. The Bulls shot 49.4 percent but committed 21 turnovers leading to 35 Cavaliers points. Zach LaVine tied the game at 106-106 before the Cavaliers scored 13 of the game's last 20 points. LaVine led six Bulls players in double figures with 26 points. Spurs 116, Kings 96 Victor Wembanyama amassed 34 points and 14 rebounds to lead San Antonio past visiting Sacramento, which was playing the second game of a road back-to-back and was outscored 56-41 in the second half.

Brandon Ingram scored 24 and rookie Yves Missi added a season-high 17 points and 11 rebounds for the Pelicans. Javonte Green missed a 3-point attempt that would have tied the game in the final seconds. Thunder 134, Clippers 128 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored a career-high 45 points to lead host Oklahoma City, playing its first game without Chet Holmgren (pelvic fracture), to a win over Los Angeles. Jalen Williams logged 28 points and eight rebounds for the Thunder, who improved to 3-0 this season on the second night of a back-to-back. The Clippers had their four-game winning streak end despite getting 31 points from Norman Powell plus 22 points and 14 rebounds from Ivica Zubac. Rockets 107, Wizards 92 Alperen Sengun produced his eighth double-double and helped Houston fend off a fourth-quarter charge from visiting Washington. Sengun paired 27 points with 17 rebounds to pace the Rockets, who overcame the absence of point guard Fred VanVleet (hamstring). Houston recorded only 13 assists, relying on transition opportunities (23 fast-break points) and a dominant performance from Sengun in the paint to survive. Kyle Kuzma scored eight points during an 11-4 Wizards run that opened the fourth and cut the deficit to 86-80. Following a Houston timeout, Sengun converted a dunk and a driving layup before nailing a 3-pointer to help the Rockets reclaim control and a double-digit lead at 93-80. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Oregon coach Dana Altman, in his 15th season at the school, wasn't about to get excited over two early-season wins. ""A lot of things to learn about being a good basketball team and making teams work,"" Altman said after the win over the Grizzlies. ""But it's Nov. 8 and we've got a lot of new guys. Just got a lot of work to do."" Oregon's scoring has been balanced with five players averaging in double digits. Nate Bittle leads the squad in scoring (16.5 ppg) and rebounding (10.5 per game). Kwame Evans Jr. is averaging 14.5 points and 6.5 rebounds, and he is followed by TJ Bamba (13 points per game), Brandon Angel (12) and Jadrian Tracey (10). Bamba is in his first campaign with the Ducks after playing three seasons for Washington State and last season at Villanova. He is focused on developing chemistry within the squad.

And they came through it successfully. They're in a confident place."" Two early wins against outmatched competition have the Hawkeyes off to a good start. Iowa will go for three in a row Tuesday night when South Dakota visits Iowa City. Iowa is coming off an 89-74 home decision Thursday night over Southern in which the Hawkeyes drilled 18 3-pointers, their highest total in a game since the 2022 Big Ten tournament and matching for the fifth most during McCaffery's 15 years. Pryce Sandfort came off the bench to hit 6 of 8 from long distance and score a game-high 22 points. Older brother Payton Sandfort added 17 points, stuffing the stat sheet with eight rebounds and seven assists (though he committed six turnovers). He leads five Hawkeyes in double figures so far at 18.5 points per game. The trip to Iowa will represent a big step up in class for the Coyotes (3-0), who are coming off a 77-47 rout Sunday of NAIA opponent Mount Marty (S.D.). Shey Eberwein came off the bench to score a game-high 15 points for South Dakota, which established a 40-22 halftime lead and never looked back. Four players are averaging in double figures for the Coyotes, who were picked to finish seventh in the nine-team Summit League. Northwestern State transfer Chase Forte is leading the way at 14.7 ppg and Isaac Bruns is chipping 12 ppg. Third-year coach Eric Peterson said Forte has been a good addition to his roster.

Utah drained 19 3-pointers in each of its first two games, a 100-59 blowout of Alcorn State and a 98-63 rout of Central Arkansas. ""I'm proud of how we've been able to adapt and adjust to get through these two games,"" Utes coach Craig Smith said.

The Utes are leading the nation in 3-point makes per game as well as 3-point attempts per game (44.0) and are 17th nationally in scoring (99 ppg). In the Central Arkansas win, guard Gabe Madsen eclipsed the 1,000-point mark for his Utah career. Madsen is averaging 26 points per game in the young season. His twin brother, Mason, a transfer from Boston College, is adding 15.0 ppg. Queens (2-0) is also off to a strong start.

Jackson State is playing its third straight road game to open the season and will be looking for its first win after falling to High Point 80-71 on Saturday. While Xavier has improved its offensive rebounding since the first 20 minutes of its season, it is trying to do the same with its 3-point defense. The Musketeers surrendered six offensive rebounds that turned into 10 second-chance points in the first half of their opener against Texas Southern, falling behind by as many as nine points. Since that point, Xavier has won the rebounding battle 45-38, allowing only 11 second-chance points. The problem for Xavier has been its defense against the 3-point shot. Texas Southern and IU Indy went a combined 24 of 51 from beyond the arc. IU Indy drained 14 of its 28 shots from long distance Friday as Xavier struggled to put the Jaguars away. ""We have to get better on our end defending the 3-point shot,"" Xavier coach Sean Miller said. ""We have to fix the leak in the roof and be better in that area. When you give up 14 of 28 from three, that's a concern.""

As a Tuesday visit from Southeastern Louisiana looms, Mississippi State has scored at least 95 points in consecutive games to begin the season for the first time in school history. Five Bulldogs scored in double figures during a 101-66 rout of Georgia State on Friday. In that contest, three players made their first career starts for Mississippi State, which is growing in a new philosophy under third-year coach Chris Jans. ""I want our team to play and get great shots and put pressure on the defense and score early when we can,"" Jans said. ""But on the other end, if we don't turn them over, I want them to have to go all the way to the shot=clock (buzzer) and work for open looks. ""The difference in length of possessions offensively and defensively is way more important to me than when people talk about what our pace is."" The Bulldogs drilled 10 3-pointers against Georgia State while boasting a 54-24 scoring edge in the paint. Josh Hubbard scored a team-high 15 points and Riley Kugel followed with 14. Hubbard, who shot 3-for-6 from long range, has made at least one 3-pointer in 15 straight games. Tuesday marks the second game of a 10-game road trip for Southeastern Louisiana. A 14-0 run in the first half at UAB on Sunday helped the Lions take a 10-point lead, but they couldn't hold the momentum. The Blazers responded with a 12-1 run to close the half en route to a 82-72 victory. Jakevion Buckley sparked Southeastern Louisiana (1-1) with 16 points and freshman Jeremy Elyzee posted his first career double-double, contributing 14 points and 10 rebounds.

The Horned Frogs and Bobcats had a triple-overtime thriller in their last meeting on Nov. 24, 2009, with TCU prevailing 108-99. TCU (2-0) has improved its program significantly since then, as it has made it to the NCAA Tournament in each of the previous three seasons under Jamie Dixon. TCU is hoping to make a fourth straight with wins over Florida A&M and Florida Gulf Coast already under its belt.  The Horned Frogs have become consistent winners early in seasons, too, posting a 53-6 record in the month of November since the 2014-15 campaign. TCU's offense shined in its season-opening victory over Florida A&M (105-59), while the defense received much of the credit in its 67-51 victory over Florida Gulf Coast. ""We found a way to get it done defensively, rebounding-wise, got all of our defensive goals, our standards, so that's a good sign,"" Dixon said after the victory over Florida Gulf Coast. ""Offensively, just not very good early and it wasn't like missing shots. It's just (that) our decision-making wasn't great."" Sophomore guard Vasean Allette has come off the bench to lead the Horned Frogs in scoring in each of the first two games, averaging 17.0 points per contest. For Texas State (2-0), this will be its first road game of the season. The Bobcats went 5-11 on the road last year. Sophomore guard Kaden Gumbs has led the team in scoring the first two games, scoring 15 points against Eastern Michigan and 27 points against McMurry. Guard Drue Drinnon is another player to watch and is an outside threat, knocking down five 3-pointers in the last game against McMurry. As a team, Texas State improved its field-goal percentage from 41.7 against Eastern Michigan to 56.7 vs. McMurry. Asked about the improvement on offense, Bobcats coach Terrence Johnson said, ""It's a good pass, which is usually going to be a good shot.

The Longhorns bounced back from a season-opening loss to Ohio State in Las Vegas with an empathic 90-59 home win over Houston Christian on Friday. Johnson led the way for Texas with 28 points and now has racked up a combined 57 points in his first two collegiate games. Texas (1-1) never trailed against Houston Christian. The Longhorns were up by seven at halftime but roared out of the break, scoring the first 12 points of the second half as part of a 24-2 run to begin the second half. Johnson hit two 3-pointers and had 10 points in that pivotal spurt while Texas' defense held the visitors to 2-of-12 shooting over the first nine minutes of the half and won its 23rd consecutive home-opening game. ""We were able to get out and play to our strengths, which is to get out, play fast in transition, put pressure on the basket and let our guys get a chance to play a little bit in open space,"" Texas coach Rodney Terry said afterward. Arthur Kaluma added 15 points, Chendall Weaver had 12, Jordan Pope scored 11, and Kadin Shedrick and Jayson Kent hit for 10 points each for the Longhorns  in Friday's victory. Texas is still without guard Tramon Mark, who has missed the first two games with an ankle injury and has no specific timeline for a return. Johnson continues to wow, as expected for the presumptive one-and-done guard. He said the team's intense summer workouts have helped him adapt quickly to the college game. ""I feel like my adjustments have mainly been in practice, working against other good players, older players,"" Johnson said. ""It's just been playing off my teammates, letting it come to me, and shooting the open shot."" Johnson is 21 of 38 from the floor and 10 of 18 from 3-point range over his first two games. By comparison, former Texas one-and-done player Kevin Durant scored 20 and 21 points, respectively, in his first two collegiate contests. ""Tre is one of those guys that I think every game, every day, he's just getting better and better,"" Terry explained. ""It's really about developing a pro mentality.""

Gabe Spinelli led Chicago State with 15 points in Saturday's setback while Jalen Forrest had 11 and Saxby Sunderland and Cam Jernigan added 10 points each.

In the Tigers' 88-62 win on Friday over Saint Francis (Pa.), Ian Schieffelin had 16 points and 13 rebounds while Jaeden Zackery delivered 16 points, six assists and four steals. Zackery, who averaged double-figure scoring for each of the past three years at Boston College, has excelled at both ends of the floor. On Friday, when Clemson coach Brad Brownell said he thought his team ""had some guys that just didn't play quite as hard,"" he also singled out Zackery for his effort. ""Jaeden Zackery was terrific all night,"" Brownell said. ""I thought his on-ball defense was really good."" Zackery's presence at the point has allowed backcourt mate Chase Hunter to focus on scoring. Hunter leads the Tigers with an average of 15 points per game, hitting 57.9 percent from the floor and 5 of 9 from beyond the arc (55.6 percent). Eastern Kentucky counters with its top scorer, George Kimble III, a transfer from Division II Eckerd College, who is averaging 18 points and 4.5 assists per game. Jordan Crawford, a transfer from College of Charleston, is averaging 14.5 points per game. Devontae Blanton, who entered the year 12th on the school's all-time scoring list, is putting up 14 points, 5.5 rebounds and five assists per game. As Eastern Kentucky awaits the renovation of its home arena, the Colonels are playing a heavy road schedule. Of their first 15 games, only four are at their alternate home gym, 13 miles south at Berea College. ""We gotta go on the road,"" Hamilton said. ""We gotta be tough. We gotta be together.

Syracuse, which was picked to finish 11th in the 18-team Atlantic Coast Conference under second-year head coach Adrian Autry, fended off Le Moyne's upset bid despite shooting just 43.1 percent (31 of 72) from the field, including 18.2 percent (4 of 22) from 3-point land. The performance from the field was the worst for Syracuse since Feb. 17, when the Orange shot 36.7 percent (22 of 60) overall and 16 percent (4 of 25) from beyond the arc in a 65-60 loss to Georgia Tech. Le Moyne shot 49.1 percent overall (28 of 57) against the Orange, including 36 percent (9 of 25) from beyond the arc. ""We're going to focus on everything -- we've got a long way to go,"" Autry said. ""We're just a work in progress still. We've got a lot of work to do."" Colgate (1-1), which has won four straight Patriot League titles and was picked to finish first in the 10-team conference under 14th-year head coach Matt Langel, endured even deeper struggles on both ends of the floor against Drexel. The Raiders shot 33 percent (20 of 60) from the field, including 16 percent (4 of 25) from beyond the arc. Drexel drained 42.9 percent of its attempts (24 of 56) and finished 43.3 percent (13 of 30) from 3-point land. ""It's easy to say that they beat us at the 3-point line, but there was more to it than that,"" Langel said. ""Overall, they were tougher than we were and more ready to win the game today. And that responsibility falls on the coach."" This will be the 176th all-time meeting between the schools, who are located about an hour apart. Syracuse leads the series 128-47, though the Orange stopped a two-game losing streak against Colgate with a 79-75 win on Nov. 14, 2023. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

UCLA (2-1) returned home after a disappointing loss to New Mexico in Henderson, Nev., on Friday, after which Bruins coach Mick Cronin called out his team for its turnover troubles. UCLA committed 15 giveaways on Monday but offset them with its stifling defense.  The Bruins converted Boston University's turnovers into 36 points. UCLA also dominated the interior, outscoring the Terriers 34-10 in the paint.  Stefanovic went 3-for-5 from 3-point range on a night UCLA collectively struggled from beyond the arc, going just 5-for-22 as a team. Sebastian Mack chipped in 12 points for the Bruins. Mack was a player Cronin specifically mentioned as someone who struggled offensively against New Mexico. Mack responded by committing no turnovers against the Terriers.  Boston University (0-3) was 6-for-24 from long distance, led by its only double-figure scorer, Kyrone Alexander. Alexander made 2 of 6 triples en route to 10 points. The Terriers were not much more successful inside the 3-point arc, going 8-for-22 on 2-point field-goal attempts. With its inability to get good looks from inside, Boston University also failed to get to the free-throw line often.  The Terriers attempted nine foul shots, making six. UCLA, meanwhile, went 18-for-21 at the free-throw line.  It was a blowout from the start, with the Bruins racing out to a 21-7 lead on Mack's 3-pointer with 11:24 left in the first half.  The visitors were later within nine, 28-19, following a pair of free throws from Nico Nobili with 2:56 to go, but UCLA then rattled off nine unanswered points to blow the game open. The Bruins went into the break up 39-22.  UCLA opened the second half on an 11-0 run, then led by at least 20 the rest of the way.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

The Knights (2-0) began the season with consecutive home wins, upsetting then-No. 13 Texas A&M 64-61 on Nov. 4 before rallying to beat an experienced Purdue Fort Wayne team 75-68 on Friday to give coach Johnny Dawkins his 150th career win at UCF. Florida Atlantic (2-0) has started quickly under first-year coach John Jakus, nearly hitting the century mark in each of its first two games. After a season-opening 97-64 win over Indiana State on Nov. 4, the Owls blasted NAIA foe Coastal Georgia 99-49 on Friday. With Florida Atlantic coming to town, Dawkins is trying to focus on building team chemistry since 11 newcomers are on the UCF roster this season. Among the fresh faces is former UTSA guard Jordan Ivy-Curry, who went for 18 points against Purdue Fort Wayne. George Mason transfer Keyshawn Hall had 14 points and 12 boards in the victory, while true freshman Moustapha Thiam chipped in 13 points and six rebounds. ""I'm still learning about these guys. This is our second game -- including exhibition games, this is our fourth game,"" Dawkins said following the meeting with Purdue Fort Wayne. ""When you have that many new players, I'm still learning about what they're like in games."" Jakus can relate, as the Owls lost 10 players from last season's 25-win team. Jackson State transfer Ken Evans Jr. and Louisville transfer Kaleb Glenn scored 18 points apiece against Coastal Georgia. Florida Atlantic has outrebounded opponents 98-62 through its first two games, but the Owls realize that the Knights pose quite the challenge on the glass. ""UCF is a very big team. They got some big guards, so one through five has to hit (the boards),"" Florida Atlantic forward Tre Carroll said. The Knights lead the all-time series between the teams 22-10. However, Florida Atlantic has taken five of its past seven games against UCF. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

The Yellow Jackets (1-1) allowed North Florida to shoot a sizzling 53.6 percent from the floor en route to a 105-93 setback to the Ospreys on Sunday. The contest marked the first time Georgia Tech surrendered 100 points in a game since a four-overtime loss to Georgia State, 123-120, in the 2020-21 season opener. ""It's a weird game from the standpoint of we scored the ball, but we just couldn't stop them at all,"" Yellow Jackets head coach Damon Stoudamire said. ""We gotta go back to the drawing board. I'm not disappointed by any means. It's still early. We just got some things we need to address. I'm bent out of shape by losing, I'm mad about losing, but we'll get past this and we gotta get ready for the next game."" Georgia Tech's Luke O'Brien downplayed his 15-point, eight-rebound performance and instead told reporters that he felt his team's defense was ""pretty pathetic."" Baye Ndongo recorded his seventh career double-double for the Yellow Jackets, posting team highs in points (20) and rebounds (10) on Sunday. Javian McCollum followed up his 18-point effort in Georgia Tech's 85-62 victory over West Georgia on Wednesday with 14 more vs. North Florida. Texas Southern (1-2) also was rather generous in its last game, a 92-64 setback to Georgia on Sunday in a Peach State Classic contest in Athens, Ga. Kenny Hunter scored 16 points on 8-of-12 shooting from the floor for Texas Southern, and Kavion McClain added 13 while making 6 of 8 shots. However, the rest of the Tigers combined to go 10-for-45 (22.2 percent) from the field. What's worse, the entire team made just 1 of 19 attempts from 3-point range and was outrebounded by a 53-23 margin. Despite the Tigers' struggles with their shooting, Georgia Bulldogs coach Mike White was quick to credit their aggressiveness on defense. ""Texas Southern's really physical, very, very handsy, tipped a lot of balls,"" White said. ""They were just super active. Their wallops were really physical, and we drew a lot of contact."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

The Seminoles (2-0) have that opportunity when they host Tarleton State (0-2) in Tallahassee, Fla. The Texans have lost their two games by 34 and 29 points, and they face their second Atlantic Coast Conference opponent, after losing at SMU 96-62 to open the season. Tarleton State then fell to visiting Sam Houston State 91-62. Florida State is coming off a 73-65 win over Rice in Houston on Saturday. Jamir Watkins scored 17 of his 30 points in the second half for the Seminoles, who never trailed but had to play solid defense down the stretch to hold off the Owls. Florida State's depth and defense, which have been staples of coach Leonard Hamilton's most successful teams, were on display as nine players got on the scoresheet and 12 received playing time. The Seminoles' defense totaled nine steals and seven blocks while scoring 23 points off Rice's 17 turnovers. ""You know, up north, you don't really play defense like how we play down here, especially at Florida State,"" said Florida State big man Taylor Bol Bowen, a native of Vermont. ""It's more packed line and a little bit softer, and I definitely always got blocks and stuff, but just being more active on the ball and using my length was something that they taught me and developed here."" Tarleton State coach Billy Gillispie shook things up with a couple of lineup changes against Sam Houston State, as Izzy Miles and Joseph Martinez each started. However, the result wasn't much different. Bubu Benjamin led the Texans again, finishing with 17 points and a career-high 10 rebounds for his first collegiate double-double. The sophomore scored a career-best 21 in the opener. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Nashville defenseman Brady Skeji had the puck just inside the blueline in the Colorado zone but lost an edge. Girard took the puck, skated in on Juuse Saros ahead of Skeji and scored over Saros' blocker to win it. It was his first goal of the season, and he also added an assist on the night. Mikko Rantanen and Devon Toews also scored and Alexandar Georgiev turned away 29 shots for the Avalanche, who have won two in a row. Luke Evangelista and Colton Sissons scored for the Predators and Saros finished with 29 saves. Georgiev allowed an early goal for the second straight game but then kept Nashville off the board for the next two periods. The Predators got that goal 1:45 during a delayed penalty. Juuso Parssinen took a shot from the point that Georgiev stopped but Evangelista scooped the rebound and tapped it in for his second goal of the season. It stayed that way until the second period. Four seconds after Nashville killed off Zachary L'Heureux's minor, Toews took a shot from the point that deflected off a Predators stick and by Saros at 4:32. It was the first goal of the season for Toews. The Avalanche took the lead midway through the second when Joel Kiviranta had the puck at the top of the slot, passed it to Rantanen in the right circle, and his one-timer beat Saros to the short side at 11:37. It was his ninth of the season and the second straight game with a goal. Nashville tied it up in the first minute of the final period. Roman Josi stole the puck at the Colorado blueline, skated into the zone and fed Sissons with a pass to the side of the crease. Sissons slid it into a wide-open net at 59 seconds.

The 54-year-old Boston native was joined in the Class of 2024 by ex-NHL players Pavel Datsyuk and Shea Weber, women's stars Natalie Darwitz and Krissy Wendell-Pohl, and executives Colin Campbell and David Poile. Roenick composed himself at the start of his speech before saying, ""I love this game. It's been such a huge part of my life for most of my life and this is the best way I can finally find to end this chapter of my life."" Roenick compiled a total of 513 goals with 703 assists with the Chicago Blackhawks (1988-89 to 1995-96), the Phoenix Coyotes (1996-97 to 2000-01 and 2006-07), the Philadelphia Flyers (2001-02 to 2003-04), the Los Angeles Kings (2005-06) and the San Jose Sharks (2007-08 and 2008-09). Only Brett Hull, Mike Modano and Keith Tkachuk scored more goals in the NHL than Roenick among U.S.-born players. Datsyuk, a 46-year-old Russian, spent all 14 seasons of his NHL seasons with the Detroit Red Wings. He logged 918 points (314 goals, 604 assists) and was part of Stanley Cup-winning sides in 2002 and 2008. Datsyuk also captured an Olympic gold medal in 2018 and was a four-time recipient of the Lady Byng Trophy, given for gentlemanly conduct. ""As I stand here today, I realize that being inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame is tremendous honor, the honor I couldn't even dream of, but this moment is not mine alone. It is shared with all of you,"" Datsyuk said Monday. Weber, a 39-year-old British Columbia native, played with the Nashville Predators from 2005-06 to 2015-16 and then with the Montreal Canadiens from 2016-17 to 2020-21. The defenseman posted 589 points (224 goals, 365 assists) in the NHL and won gold with Canada in 2010 and 2014. ""I want to thank all those players who demonstrated the importance of hard work and dedication,"" Weber said Monday. ""By passing on your knowledge to the next generation, you're ensuring that the spirit of this game continues to thrive. ""It's also when the coaches and staff teach you the nuances of the game. They challenge you to get better every day."" Darwitz notched the winning goal for Minnesota in the 2005 NCAA championship game against Harvard. She played for the United States at the 2002, 2006 and 2010 Olympics. ""I wasn't your everyday little girl, and somehow my mom was on to me,"" Darwitz said Monday. ""Despite some obvious distraction techniques on her part, in the name of tap dancing classes and shopping trips, she knew where my heart was, and on my fifth birthday, my blonde French braid strolled into the hockey rink."" Wendell-Pohl, another Golden Gophers great, captured the Patty Kazmaier Award for the top female college hockey player in 2005. She was selected the MVP of the 2005 IIHF World Championships, when the U.S. team won its first gold medal, and she was the captain of the 2006 Olympic team. ""I feel so fortunate that hockey has allowed me to represent not only my hometown, my state but my country,"" Wendell-Pohl said. ""Playing in the Olympics was never why I started playing hockey but I am beyond grateful to have been blessed and had the opportunity to wear the red, white and blue."" Campbell has been a player, coach and executive across a 52-year hockey career, and he has been the senior executive vice president for the NHL's hockey operations, officiating and central scouting departments for 25 years. Campbell won a Stanley Cup as associate coach of the New York Rangers in 1994. Poile retired as general manager of the Nashville Predators in 2023 after becoming the winningest and longest-tenured general manager in league history. He was GM of the Washington Capitals from 1982-97, then served in the same role in Nashville for 27 years. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

That's what Seattle Kraken coach Dan Bylsma did with forwards Oliver Bjorkstrand and Tye Kartye on Nov. 5 at Colorado. The move seems to have paid off, as Bjorkstrand scored a goal and Kartye assisted on another as the Kraken snapped a four-game skid with a 4-3 overtime victory against the visiting Vegas Golden Knights on Friday. After a weekend off, the Kraken will host the struggling Columbus Blue Jackets on Tuesday. Bjorkstrand's gritty goal early in the third period -- Golden Knights goalie Adin Hill lunged to make a pokecheck, only for the puck to careen off Bjorkstrand as he charged to the top of the crease and deflect into the net -- put the Kraken ahead 3-2 after they had fallen behind 2-0. ""I thought his game, in particular, was a great bounce-back game for him,"" Bylsma said. ""He's a talented, skilled player with a great shot and scores a lot of goals. His competition was at a great level for him to have success in the game. And it's not just the evidence of going to the net and scoring a dirty goal, but on the wall in the first period, at the faceoff (circle), also in the first period, the battle on the wall in the second period in front of our bench. It was great."" Bjorkstrand, who told reporters he needed to be better when asked about being a healthy scratch, was pleased to impact the game. ""Yeah, it was good,"" he said. ""I would have been ready in Colorado, but I was ready (Friday), kept it simple. I feel like I played well with the puck and was able to create some chances."" After a promising start to the season, the Blue Jackets are winless in their past five games (0-4-1). They fell 4-2 on Sunday at Anaheim as Ducks goaltender John Gibson, making his season debut after undergoing an emergency appendectomy on Sept. 25, stopped 38 shots. Kirill Marchenko had a goal and an assist for Columbus. Yegor Chinakhov also scored, and Daniil Tarasov made 26 saves. ""It's unacceptable,"" said Columbus defenseman Zach Werenski, who was playing in his 500th NHL game. ""Enough with the moral victories. We've played well enough in a lot of games this year to win and we end up losing them, and that's on us. ""We have to look ourselves in the mirror and find a way to win hockey games. I don't care if we outshoot them 50-20 or we get outshot 50-20. At the end of the day, we have to find a way to get points in this league and win hockey games, and we haven't done it."" The Blue Jackets have scored just nine goals during their losing streak. ""Goal-scoring is funny. It goes in streaks,"" Columbus coach Dean Evason said. ""A few weeks back, we couldn't miss and the pucks were finding their way in and we were getting some bounces and good stuff. And now it's gone the other way a little bit, but there's nothing we can do about it now except move forward and keep doing those things to get those opportunities."" Both teams could have lineup reinforcements Tuesday. The Kraken reacquired forward Daniel Sprong, who scored 21 goals for them in 2022-23, in a trade with the Vancouver Canucks. The Blue Jackets claimed defenseman Dante Fabbro, a former first-round pick, off waivers from the Nashville Predators. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Minnesota fell 95-94 to Miami on Sunday after Mike Conley missed a 3-pointer in the last two seconds. The Wolves committed 20 turnovers in the loss. After the game, Minnesota coach Chris Finch took the blame for some confusion during the game's final two possessions. Center Rudy Gobert appreciated Finch's apology but said it was a team loss.

Minnesota has won its last five meetings against Portland, which turned in a dismal performance against a depleted Memphis squad. The Grizzlies played without injured guards Ja Morant (hip) and Desmond Bane (oblique) and still led by as many as 25 points in the second quarter. ""It was just (expletive) embarrassing,"" Portland coach Chauncey Billups said. ""We were soft as hell the whole game. Nobody really fought. It was just embarrassing for everybody. That's just not who we are. It really isn't. No excuse for that."" Jerami Grant led the Blazers with 20 points, while Dalano Banton and Donovan Clingan had 13 points apiece off the bench. Portland opened a four-game homestand by shooting 4-of-42 (9.5 percent) from 3-point range and committing 23 turnovers. ""It was like our guys just showed up because they had to be here and didn't want to play,"" Billups said. ""Didn't want to actually work. And that's embarrassing. It's unfortunate that we had to go out there in front of our fans who paid their hard-earned money to come and see their favorite team play, and we show up and do that."" Blazers guard Shaedon Sharpe, coming back from a shoulder injury, played in his third game and made his first start of the season on Sunday and had seven points on 3-of-10 shooting. Sharpe started in place of forward Deni Avdija, who is averaging 9.0 points and 5.6 rebounds. In 13 minutes off the bench, Avdija missed all five of his field-goal attempts.

They passed the ball around the outside to Gold, who canned a corner 3-pointer with 14:19 to go that put his team ahead 53-38. But four players scored in an ensuing 10-0 Central Michigan run to cut that lead to five points. Marquette struggled to grow that lead larger than 10 as the Chippewas consistently provided an answer. Heady converted a three-point play to cut the margin to 60-54 with 5:13 to go. Gold converted another triple at the 3:30 mark to make it 65-56, and the Golden Eagles ran out the clock from there. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Tyreek Hill had a second-half touchdown reception for the Dolphins (3-6) after he was questionable to play with a wrist injury. Jason Sanders made three field goals, including a 50-yarder with 2:38 remaining to seal the victory. Miami's defense recorded four sacks. Tagovailoa was 20-of-28 passing with an interception, while improving to 1-2 since returning from concussion protocol in Week 8. De'Von Achane ran for a team-best 37 yards and had five receptions for 15 yards. Matthew Stafford was 32-of-46 passing for 293 yards, but did not throw for a touchdown with one interception, the sixth consecutive game he threw a pick.

Rookie Joshua Karty made five field goals for Los Angeles, including a career best from 55 yards. After Karty missed a 57-yard field-goal attempt on the opening drive of the second half, the Dolphins responded with a six-play, 53-yard drive that ended with Hill's 1-yard TD reception from Tagovailoa for a 17-6 lead.

The 34-year-old Thompson, a first-round pick by the Warriors in 2011, elected to leave Golden State in a sign-and-trade over the summer, ending a 13-year run that included two missed seasons because of Achilles and knee injuries. The four-time champion and five-time All-Star is averaging 13.8 points in his first 10 games for the Mavericks after averaging 17.9 points for the Warriors last season. Thompson departed Golden State ranked second to Stephen Curry on the franchise all-time list for career 3-pointers (2,481), while also sitting fourth in games (793), sixth in points (15,531) and ninth in steals (676). The homecoming comes as part of the second edition of the NBA Cup, an in-season tournament that was drawn with the Mavericks and Warriors in the same five-team pool with the Memphis Grizzlies, New Orleans Pelicans and Denver Nuggets. Thompson attempted to downplay his return by citing excitement for the NBA Cup, in which he and the Warriors went 2-2 last season. ""It'll be good to see people you grinded with,"" he said over the weekend. ""But to me, it's just another regular-season game in November. Obviously, there are bigger implications with the NBA Cup, so what's on my mind is to win that because I haven't been a part of it yet. I know it's young, but it'd be fun to play for that title."" Thompson's departure from the Warriors came as part of a six-team trade in which the Warriors acquired, among others, Buddy Hield from the Philadelphia 76ers. Hield has more than made up for the loss of Thompson, ranking among the NBA leaders in 3-pointers (40) and 3-point field goal percentage (48.8). Thompson has made 29 treys at a 35.4 percent clip for the Mavericks. Warriors coach Steve Kerr said there are no hard feelings about Thompson leaving. ""Sometimes a fresh start can be healthy,"" he said. ""Everybody's life and career arc is different. I think Klay made the right decision going to Dallas. Just seeing him the last couple of years, I think he needed a fresh start."" The Warriors plan to greet Thompson with a ""Salute Captain Klay"" interactive experience that will include a pregame video tribute. The Warriors have announced that his No. 31 will be retired when his playing days are over. Curry applauds the idea of celebrating his ""Splash Brother"" sooner rather than later. ""We have a game to play, so the focus has to be there,"" he said. ""But he deserves the celebration and the welcome he's going to get. It's a chance to reflect on all the memories we created together."" Coming off a 4-1 trip that included wins over the Boston Celtics and Oklahoma City Thunder, the Warriors take an 8-2 record into a four-day sequence in which they also will host Memphis in an NBA Cup game on Friday. With Kyrie Irving scoring 43 points, the Mavericks opened a three-game trip with a 122-120 loss at Denver on Sunday. Luka Doncic had 24 points, nine rebounds and nine assists. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Dustin Wolf, who came within a whisker of his first career shutout, made 29 saves. He also collected his first NHL point with an assist. Kevin Rooney also scored and Backlund finished with two points. Trevor Moore scored with 2:31 left in regulation for the Kings, while goaltender Darcy Kuemper stopped 25 shots. Despite outshooting and collecting more chances the visitors from the drop of the puck -- the Kings needed more than 11 minutes to register their first shot on goal -- the Flames failed to score for nearly 30 minutes to open the game. Backlund opened the scoring at 10:42 of the second period after gaining the puck in the slot off a turnover and whipping a top-corner shot for his fourth goal of the season. Huberdeau doubled the lead right shortly after the ensuing puck drop. Andrei Kuzmenko sprung Huberdeau on a partial breakaway, and, while holding off a check, Huberdeau slipped a low shot into the cage for his sixth goal of the campaign. Wolf got his assist on that goal. Moore finally solved Wolf with late in the third, converting a golden chance that needed video review to prove crossed the line for his third goal of the season. Rooney iced the game with an empty-net goal, his first tally of the season, with 20 seconds on the clock. Wolf showed he was on his game early when he denied Kevin Fiala on a first-period breakaway. He stared down Anze Kopitar moments after his team staked the 2-0 lead, and kept the door shut early in the third period when Adrian Kempe was sprung on a golden opportunity. Earlier in the day, the Flames announced forward Anthony Mantha would miss the remainder of the season due to knee surgery. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Zverev, the event's second seed, and Rublev, the eighth seed, began round-robin play in the John Newcombe Group. In the other match on Monday, also in the Newcombe Group, sixth-seeded Casper Ruud of Norway upset third-seeded Carlos Alcaraz of Spain 6-1, 7-5. The eight players in the season-ending tournament are split into two groups for the initial phase. The top two players from each group will advance to the semifinals. Zverev, 27, captured the year-ending event in 2018 and 2021. He enjoyed a strong 2024 season, reaching three Grand Slam semifinals for the first time in his career. He lost to Alcaraz in the French Open final and advanced to the semifinals of the Australian Open. On Monday, Zverev finished with a 9-3 edge in aces and a 22-10 advantage in winners. He never faced a break point and won on all seven of his net approaches. ""I thought it was a very solid match from my end,"" Zverev said. ""Against anyone here, you have to play your best to have a chance, you have to be solid (and) mentally strong. I feel like I did that today, I felt like I used my chances quite well and I'm obviously happy with this win."" He isn't bothered by not being favorite this season and this week. ""I think the attention went to Carlos and Jannik (Sinner) all year long,"" Zverev said. ""They deserve it, they won two Grand Slams each. ""It's normal in sports, at some point everybody retires, new players come along. We have a great group of guys leading with Jannik and Carlos. I think they had a better year, even though I'm No. 2 in the world. The benchmark is those two guys."" Alcaraz stumbled against Ruud, particularly at the key moments. Ruud saved five of the six break points on his serve while taking advantage of all four of his break opportunities. ""It's only one match, but it's definitely one of the best wins of the season for me,"" Ruud said. ""In terms of who I'm playing, his level, his ranking and all this stuff. I feel very happy, of course. I think we will see Carlos play better tennis than he did today, but I took care of my chances."" The Ilie Nastase Group continues play Tuesday, with top-seeded Jannik Sinner of Italy opposing fifth-seeded Taylor Fritz of the United States while fourth-seeded Daniil Medvedev of Russia opposes seventh-seeded Alex de Minaur of Australia.

""He's close,"" Collins said of the player's status. Northwestern (1-1) was without Barnhizer for its first two games, including Saturday night's 71-66 road loss to Dayton. The Wildcats led by as many as 13 in the first half before the Flyers came back, outscoring Northwestern 47-34 in the second half. Junior Nick Martinelli recorded career highs with 32 points and 14 boards. He made 12 of 16 field-goal attempts, including all three from beyond the arc. Martinelli was selected the Big Ten Player of the Week on Monday after becoming the first player in the conference since at least 1996-97 to post 25-plus points and 10-plus rebounds in the first two games of a season. Barnhizer is out with a lower-body injury but took part in warm-ups ahead of the Flyers game. Barnhizer averaged 14.6 points and 7.5 rebounds last season. Northwestern is attempting to win its fourth straight game against UIC. Collins is 3-0 against the Flames, each win by double digits. The teams last met in December 2022, with the Wildcats pulling away 92-54. The Wildcats lead the series 6-4. Freshman guard Angelo Ciaravino is slowly getting used to playing at the collegiate level through two games. Even in a losing effort, Ciaravino said it is a building block for future success. ""It's very surreal stepping out there and seeing all those people, but at the end of the day, it's us vs. them, and it's about focusing on what's on the court and drowning everything else out,"" said Ciaravino, who scored 12 points in 21 minutes against Dayton. The Flames (2-0) have rolled through their nonconference schedule thus far. In their victories against St. Francis (Ill.) and Yale, they scored 91 points in each game, with five scorers reaching double figures against the Bulldogs on Friday night. Tyem Freeman led the way in the 91-79 home victory with 19 points off the bench, while Jordan Mason added 16 in a reserve role. Sasa Ciani posted a double-double with 13 points and 11 rebounds, Jayon Jackson scored 13 and Ahmad Henderson II contributed 11 points and a game-high seven assists. UIC's last win against a power-conference opponent came at Northwestern's expense, 50-44 in 2012. The game against the Flames is the first of four home games at Welsh-Ryan Arena before the Wildcats travel to Tempe, Ariz., to take on Butler in the Arizona Tip-off on Thanksgiving Day. The Flames host Saint Mary's (Minn.) on Saturday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Oklahoma City is 3-0 this season on the second night of a back-to-back. The loss snapped a four-game winning streak by the Clippers. The Clippers cut what was a 20-point deficit to three with just more than two minutes remaining before Gilgeous-Alexander answered with a step-back 3-pointer. Ivica Zubac's three-point play with 42 seconds left cut the deficit to 130-128 before Gilgeous-Alexander hit a pair of free throws and Luguentz Dort had a steal leading to a Jalen Williams dunk in the closing seconds to put the game away. Playing a day after Chet Holmgren suffered a pelvic fracture in a loss to Golden State, the Thunder leaned heavily on Gilgeous-Alexander and Williams. Gilgeous-Alexander was 13 of 21 from the field and hit a season-high four 3-pointers while Williams added 28 points on 11-of-16 shooting. The Thunder shot 51.6 percent from the floor and were 22 of 23 from the free-throw line. Holmgren will be evaluated in eight to 10 weeks, the Thunder announced before the game. Playing without Holmgren, and with several other frontcourt players injured as well, the Thunder went with a smaller lineup. Oklahoma City thrived for much of the game after starting Williams with Aaron Wiggins and Dort in the frontcourt. The Thunder led for much of the game, building their lead to 20 by midway through the third. But the Clippers finally had success on the interior over the last half of the quarter, reeling off a 25-10 run to cut the deficit to five heading into the fourth.

Houston recorded only 13 assists, relying on transition opportunities and a dominant performance from Sengun in the paint to survive.

UNC Greensboro responded, cutting the deficit to 19-15 on Donovan Atwell's reverse layup, and on the ensuing possession, Giles' driving layup put the Spartans within two.

Erik Johnson also scored for Philadelphia, while Samuel Ersson made 28 saves. Michkov, who was a healthy scratch in each of the Flyers' previous two games, finished with a goal and an assist before his key tally in the shootout. Jack Thompson, Mikael Granlund and Barclay Goodrow scored for the Sharks, who had won five of their previous seven games. Vitek Vanecek made 40 saves for the visitors. After both teams failed on their first shootout attempt, Michkov deposited an impressive backhand-to-forehand move. Following a save by Ersson, Konecny netted the decisive goal, dragging the puck on his forehand before flipping it under the crossbar. The Flyers scored twice in the first period, beginning with Johnson's first goal of the season at 1:40. With just over four minutes left in the period, Konecny made it 2-0 on a tic-tac-toe setup, as Emil Andrae found Michkov, who one-timed a feed to Konecny, whose blast from the right circle beat Vanecek for a power-play goal. At 5:09 of the second period, Michkov got behind the defense and beat Vanecek 5-hole to make it 3-0. However, San Jose began to chip away later in the period. With about 4 1/2 minutes left in the stanza, William Eklund's centering pass caromed off Thompson's skate and past Ersson to get the Sharks on the board. About three minutes later, Eklund set up Granlund at the right faceoff dot for a spicy wrister that got under the crossbar. The score remained 3-2 until Goodrow netted the equalizer with 2:24 left in regulation. Henry Thrun's shot from the left point ricocheted to the right of the net where Goodrow slammed it past Ersson. San Jose began overtime with two minutes of a 4-on-3 advantage after Michkov took a roughing penalty at the end of regulation. Ersson made several key saves during the ensuing penalty kill. Vanecek made some key stops on the other end late in overtime, including denials of Andrae and Michkov to send the game to a shootout. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Dallas, which entered Monday with just 39 goals in 13 games, feasted on the league's third-worst scoring defense. In winning for the second time in three games, the Stars did nearly all of their damage in the opening period and cruised from there. The first-period six-pack tied the then-Minnesota North Stars, who also scored six in the first 20 minutes in a 7-2 win over the Los Angeles Kings on March 16, 1971. The franchise record for goals in any period is eight, set by Minnesota in the second period of a 15-2 home win against Winnipeg on Nov. 11, 1981. The half-dozen goals that got past Joel Blomqvist and Alex Nedeljkovic on just 12 shots were also the most Pittsburgh ever allowed in the first period at home. Five Stars players recorded two or more points in the barrage, with Marchment (one goal, three assists) tying a team record with four points in one period. That occurred 10 times previously, with Tyler Seguin and Valeri Nichushkin both accomplishing the feat most recently against Philadelphia on Dec. 7, 2013. Marchment's goal came when Brendan Smith cleared the puck from the Stars' end as both teams changed lines. The puck bounced off the board behind the Penguins' net and toward the slot, where Marchment got ahead of Matt Grzelcyk and Kris Letang to beat Blomqvist, make it 3-0 and end the starting netminder's night with 9:44 remaining in the period. Marchment, who entered Monday with two goals and six assists in 12 games, helped on goals from Matt Duchene, Miro Heiskanen and Seguin. He added a fifth point, one off his career high, when he and Duchene assisted on Wyatt Johnston's third-period goal. Heiskanen added an unassisted goal as he tallied his first two of the season, and the fifth two-goal game in the defenseman's career. Logan Stankoven also scored. After allowing three goals on four shots in relief of Blomqvist, Nedeljkovic settled down to make 28 saves for the Penguins, who lost for the third time in four games. Tristan Jarry, recalled from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton on Saturday, was a healthy scratch. Dallas goalie Jake Oettinger rebounded from being pulled after giving up four goals in less than 30 minutes in a loss at Winnipeg on Saturday. He made 20 saves on Monday, only allowing a second-period goal by Anthony Beauvillier. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

After a disappointing loss to Austin Peay their last time out, Bulldogs coach Thad Matta inserted Augusto Cassia into the starting line-up looking for a quick start, and he responded with a career high 16. Butler was also looking to cut down on turnovers after committing 35 in their first two games. Butler only committed 11 on the night. Donovan Williams led Western Michigan with 17 points and nine rebounds, while teammate JaVaughn Hannah chipped in 15. The Broncos were 4-of-22 from 3-point range. Western Michigan opened with five straight points to start the contest with Hannah hitting a fall-away jumper and a 3-pointer from the wing. That would be the Broncos biggest lead of the night. Still, the first half saw the teams trading baskets. The game was tied 11 times in the first half and saw seven lead changes. Butler led 39-37 at halftime. The Bulldogs opened the second half hot. Cassia started things with a dunk on an alley-oop. Finley Bizjack added a driving basket and the Bulldogs went on a 16-2 run over a four-minute span to make it 55-39. Western Michigan responded with a 15-2 burst capped by a jumper from the elbow by Strickland with 11:11 to pull to 57-54, but Butler dominated the final minutes. Western Michigan scored only four points in the final 7:02 as the Bulldogs closed out with the game's final ten points.

Winthrop stayed close and Harrison's layup pulled them within 40-39 with 8:51 to go. The Eagles tied it briefly before five quick Virginia Tech points made it 47-42 with 6:13 remaining. The first half featured seven lead changes. Harrison's jump shot gave Winthrop an early 11-7 edge before Virginia Tech's Tyler Johnson scored the final four points of a 6-0 run.

Lathan Sommerville scored 14 points off the bench with four rebounds and three blocks, while Jordan Derkack scored nine points and made key defensive stops in one-on-one coverage late to give the Scarlet Knights a 2-0 start to their season. Saint Peter's (0-3) were on a scoreless drought of about five minutes when Adetokunbo Bakare scored seven consecutive points for the Peacocks. After a layup and 3-point shot on consecutive fast breaks, the guard who didn't play a minute of the first half cut the visitor's deficit to four points, 57-53, after the Scarlet Knights had led by nine points with 11:04 remaining. Saint Peter's took the lead with 5:41 remaining after two shots from deep from Marcus Randolph and a go-ahead layup by Tyreck Morris. Then the two sides tied at 63 and traded baskets. After Morris' layup put the Peacocks ahead 65-64 with 4:07 remaining in regulation, the Scarlet Knights went on an 11-0 run to close out the game. Randolph led the scoring for Saint Peter's with 22 points. Mouhamed Sow added nine points with six rebounds. The difference for Rutgers was aggressive play by Saint Peter's, which committed 23 fouls against the Scarlet Knights. From those extra trips to the line, Rutgers added 12 points in the second half and went 18-for-25 from the line on the night. Rutgers was without top freshman prospect Ace Bailey, who hasn't played yet this season after sustaining an undisclosed injury in practice last week. Saint Peter's shooting gave the visitors an early advantage, going 16-for-30 from the field in the first half. However, Peacocks made only one of their first 10 shots from the floor to start the second half, with Rutgers outscoring them 18-6 in the first 10 minutes of the half.

Florida (3-0), which had only broken even in rebounding margin after two games, managed a 45-24 rebounding edge on Monday.  Sophomore center Rueben Chinyelu paced the Gators with a career-high 14 points on 7-for-8 shooting. Walter Clayton Jr. chipped in12 points, including 3-for-7 shooting from 3-point range. Will Richard also added 12 points and five rebounds, and Sam Alexis had 12 points and six rebounds. Alex Condon tallied 10 points, eight boards and two blocks. Florida shot 45.3 percent from the field and 30.4 percent (7 for 23) from long range. The Gators seemed unphased by the recent sexual misconduct allegations surrounding coach Todd Golden. Golden coached the game, as the matter is under investigation from the university. Grambling (1-2) came in off a two-point loss to Ole Miss but couldn't stay as close this time. Kintavious Dozier led the Tigers with 19 points and added five rebounds. Antwan Burnett added 15 points and five boards. Grambling pulled within 46-34 on a dunk by Ernest Ross with 17:24 to play, but Florida answered with a 9-0 run. The Tigers got no closer than 17 points thereafter. Grambling started the night's scoring on a layup by Dozier. Florida took the lead immediately on a 3-pointer from Clayton and never trailed again.  The Tigers pulled within 16-10 with 13:10 left in the first half on a bucket by James Flippin, who finished with 12 points.

Guillermo Diaz-Graham powered for 10 points and nine rebounds while Zack Austin provided 10 points and four blocks for Pitt, which took advantage of its superior size inside. Darryl Simmons II paced Gardner-Webb (1-2) with 12 points. Anthony Selden and Jamaine Mann added 10 points each for the Runnin' Bulldogs, while Isaiah Richards had six points and a game-high 14 rebounds. After Gardner-Webb made a program-record 70 percent of its field-goal attempts on Friday in a win over North Carolina Central, the Runnin' Bulldogs made just 39.7 percent of their shots from the floor on Monday. Before the game was five minutes old, Pitt opened a 14-2 lead, which Leggett started and finished with baskets in the paint. Diaz-Graham added a 3-pointer and Dunn followed with a three-point play to fuel the surge. Midway through the half, Pitt began a 13-0 spree that included 3-pointers by Austin and Leggett. When Leggett finished the run with a fastbreak layup, the Panthers were on top 34-13. Over the final 6:05 of the half, Pitt missed nine consecutive field-goal attempts against Gardner-Webb's active 2-3 zone. During the dry spell, the Runnin' Bulldogs got 3-pointers from Ademide Badmus and Selden to cut a 21-point deficit to 38-23 at the break. Gardner-Webb made some noise in the second half, slicing a 19-point gap to 11 as Brendan Mycalcio came off the bench and scored six quick points. The Runnin' Bulldogs made their run largely by hustling for offensive rebounds. A three-point play by Selden midway through the half made it 55-44, but Gardner-Webb got no closer the rest of the way.

Reese barely missed a double-double but led the Terrapins (3-0) to their third consecutive victory by 30 or more points to open the season. Reese was one of five Maryland players to score in double figures as the Terrapins led wire-to-wire and were able to play 14 players after taking a double-digit lead for good with 3:53 left in the first half. Tyler Shirley with 10 points was the lone double-figure scorer for the Rattlers (0-3), who continued to struggle early on against tough competition in coach Patrick Crarey II's first season. Shirley, however, fouled out with 9:36 left in the second half. Maryland scored the game's first 15 points in three minutes. The Terrapins took advantage of five turnovers during that span and that became a theme throughout the contest as they finished with 11 steals. Florida A&M ended up with 22 turnovers overall, which led to 31 Maryland points. Ja'Derryus Eatmon's layup with 16:41 left in the first half finally got the Rattlers on the scoreboard. It also sparked a 12-2 surge, which cut Maryland's early advantage to five. But the Terrapins continued to turn mistakes into fast-break points and broke the game open by halftime, leading 40-21.

Coach Tony Bennett is retired, but the Cavaliers showed that they can still play strong defense under interim coach Ron Sanchez. Virginia had 11 blocks and seven steals and limited Coppin State to 28 percent shooting from the field, including a 21.1 percent mark (4 of 19) from 3-point distance. Derrius Ward scored 12 points and Jonathan Dunn had 11 to lead the Eagles (0-4), who have lost 17 consecutive games dating back to last season.

Ohio State was playing as a ranked team for the first time since landing in the top 25 the week of Jan. 2, 2023.  Cris Carroll had 10 points and Ty Harper and Gabe Dynes each scored nine points for the Penguins (1-1), who were 3-for-22 on 3-pointers (13.6 percent).  Bradshaw and Stewart had only two points apiece in a season-opening victory against then-No. 19 Texas last Monday, but they combined for 15 in the first half against the Penguins.  Mobley, who went 4-for-4 from beyond the arc vs. the Longhorns, knocked down his first three triples of the night against Youngstown State to run his streak of made treys to seven before recording his first miss from deep.  It was a wonder why the Penguins only trailed 37-22 at intermission after their epic cold spells. They took a 2-0 lead 16 seconds into the game but went the next 6:14 without scoring while the Buckeyes reeled off 12 straight points. The Ohio State lead reached 13 points, 27-14, before Youngstown State got as close as nine, but it then went the final 6:34 of the first half without a made field goal. However, the Penguins did sink five free throws during that stretch.  Ohio State opened the second half on an 8-2 run to build a 45-24 cushion, then led by at least 20 the rest of the way.  Because a power outage on the Youngstown State campus postponed the Penguins' season opener against Westminster last Monday, the team will begin the season with six straight games away from home for the first time in program history. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

In last season's inaugural edition of the NBA Cup, then called the NBA In-Season Tournament, Phoenix advanced from the five-team group at 3-1 to reach the knockout round. Utah finished third in the group at 2-2. Through the first few weeks of this regular season, the Jazz struggled to an 0-6 start -- the franchise's worst opening stretch since going 0-8 in 2013-14. Utah tips off the NBA Cup having won two of three games, however, coming off a 111-110 decision in San Antonio on Saturday. Collin Sexton's free throws with 3.2 seconds gave Utah a necessary buffer, as Devin Vassell hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer. Sexton finished with a team-high 23 points, as the Jazz improved to 2-1 this season when he notches 20-plus points. Sexton scored 24 in the 135-126 win at Chicago on Nov. 4. Lauri Markkanen scored 20 points in his second game back in the lineup after leaving the Oct. 29 loss to Sacramento with back spasms. Rookie forward Kyle Filipowski played a strong all-around game against the Spurs with eight points, six assists and five rebounds. ""He's very comfortable with the ball in his hands,"" Jazz coach Will Hardy said of Filipowski, per the Deseret News. ""It gives us a lot of (options) on offense, especially when he's out there with John (Collins) and Lauri."" Fellow Utah rookie guard Isaiah Collier, helping fill in with Keyonte George out with a foot injury, had seven points, six rebounds and four assists in his second NBA game. While Utah tips off the NBA Cup coming off of just its second win on the season, Phoenix begins group play coming off of only its second loss. The Suns lost to visiting Sacramento 127-118 in overtime, snapping their seven-game winning streak. Devin Booker scored 28 points, Bradley Beal added 23 and Tyus Jones recorded a season-high 22 to shoulder the bulk of the offensive load with Kevin Durant sidelined.   Durant sustained a left calf strain in Phoenix's 114-113 win over Dallas on Friday. The team announced the 11-time All-NBA forward will miss at least the next two weeks. Beal, who has been dealing with an elbow sprain, also collided with DeMar DeRozan on Sunday and underwent an X-ray on his left knee following the game. Results from the X-ray returned negative. Beal's incident came after Jusuf Nurkic exited the game with an ankle injury. ""Our depth definitely got tested with Nurk going out,"" Suns coach Mike Budenholzer said.  Veteran reserve Mason Plumlee, who Budenholzer said has been ""very good"" for Phoenix this season, came on to provide six points, 11 rebounds and six assists. Fellow reserve Josh Okogie added nine points and five rebounds. Regardless of the status of Beal or Nurkic for Tuesday, Budenholzer is still looking for continued contributions from the bench.

Conversely, the Edmonton Oilers' third-period outburst on Saturday provided a hint they might finally be ready to return to form. The former tries to bounce back and the latter aims to build momentum Tuesday night when New York visits Edmonton in the first clash of the season between the teams. Neither team has played since Saturday. The host Islanders squandered a two-goal lead in the third period and fell to the New Jersey Devils 4-3 in overtime. The visiting Oilers ended a two-game losing streak by scoring four goals in fewer than five minutes in the third period of a 7-3 win over the Vancouver Canucks. The loss snapped a season-high two-game winning streak for the Islanders, who appeared headed for victory when Dennis Cholowski and Brock Nelson scored within a stretch of 1:56 shortly beyond the midway point of the third period. But Dawson Mercer scored with 4:27 left for the Devils, who pulled goalie Jacob Markstrom with about 1:18 remaining and tied the score when Stefan Noesen's pass into the crease glanced off the stick and skate of Islanders defenseman Grant Hutton and trickled past Ilya Sorokin, who finished with 29 saves. Jack Hughes scored on a breakaway 2:35 into overtime to hand the Islanders their 14th loss -- counting the playoffs -- in games in which they led in the third period over the last two seasons. New York, which frittered away several one-goal leads in a 5-4 overtime loss to the Utah Hockey Club on Oct. 10, also gave up third-period advantages in a shootout win over the Montreal Canadiens on Oct. 19 and in an overtime victory over the Devils on Oct. 25. ""We managed to take a 3-1 lead. Unfortunately, we couldn't close,"" Islanders coach Patrick Roy said. ""Need to find a way to close those games."" Closing wasn't a problem Saturday for the Oilers, who led 3-0 fewer than five minutes into the second before the Canucks' Elias Pettersson and Filip Hronek scored twice in a span of 1:59. Connor Brown opened and closed the third-period flurry for the Oilers, who received goals in between from Connor McDavid and Brett Kulak. The four-goal third was the most prolific period of the season for Edmonton, which scored fewer than four goals in nine of its first 14 games. The win was the fifth in the last eight games for the defending Western Conference champion Oilers, who were a popular preseason pick to win the Stanley Cup but opened with five losses in their first seven games (2-4-1). ""It was a solid effort by our group, but the main thing is that third period, the way we showed composure and poise in the third and made plays with the lead and piled on,"" Brown said. ""I think there's a lot of momentum to be built off that game, especially that third period."" The Oilers will visit the Islanders on March 14 to conclude the two-game season series. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Freshman forward Asa Newell had 26 in the season opener and guard Dakota Leffew, a graduate student, went for 23 on Sunday against Texas Southern after 18 in the first game, both off the bench. The Bulldogs have won 20 consecutive nonconference games at Stegeman Coliseum, including against Xavier in last year's NIT en route to making the tournament semifinals. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

He died in Baton Rouge, La., from complications stemming from pneumonia. Robinson compiled a 104-35-4 record over two separate tenures as head football coach at USC, winning a national championship with the Trojans in 1978. The 104 wins put him at third place in all-time wins at the school behind John McKay and Howard Jones. Robinson never had a losing season at USC in 12 seasons. His first team, in 1976, went 11-1 and won the Rose Bowl, finishing No. 2 in the AP poll. After a dip to 8-4 in 1977, Robinson put together a two-year run of 23-1-1 in 1978-79, winning two more Rose Bowls and a national championship as designated by the coaches' poll in 1978. He coached another three seasons during that first tenure, producing such noted NFL stars as Marcus Allen, Ricky Bell, Charles White, Clay Matthews and Joey Browner. Allen and White both won the Heisman Trophy while playing for Robinson. In 1983, Robinson was handed the reins to the Los Angeles Rams and twice advanced to the NFC Championship Game in his tenure there (1983-1991), going 75-68. The Trojans re-hired Robinson for the 1993 season. While his second stint at USC did not produce the same highs, he did earn three more bowl wins over five seasons, including wins in the Cotton Bowl and Rose Bowl. His head coaching career wrapped in Las Vegas with UNLV, where he went 28-42 over six years. He also became a consultant with LSU and was present for the Tigers' national title in 2019. Overall, Robinson finished with an 8-1 record in bowl games over 18 seasons as a head coach. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Now the Nittany Lions try to go 3-for-3 -- not just in the win column but in reaching triple figures -- on Tuesday night when they host St. Francis in University Park, Pa. The key for Penn State has been its ability to score off turnovers. It has swiped the ball 28 times, leading to a 53-15 advantage in points off turnovers. The Nittany Lions also boast a 48-16 advantage in fast-break points. ""This is who we are and this is how we have to go about doing it,"" said second-year Penn State coach Mike Rhoades. ""The kids are confident in doing it. When you go out there, let your hair down and good things will happen."" Northern Illinois transfer Yanic Konan Niederhauser led five players in double figures during Friday night's 103-54 rout of UMBC, scoring 18 points and grabbing nine rebounds. The Nittany Lions sank 55.2 percent of their field-goal attempts, including 10 of 23 3-pointers, and collected 21 assists. Niederhauser and Zach Hicks are each averaging 17 ppg, with D'Marco Dunn supplying 14 ppg off the bench. Meanwhile, St. Francis enters with a 1-2 mark after rallying from an 11-point halftime deficit Sunday for a 65-64 win at Campbell. Valentino Pinedo capped the comeback by hitting a foul shot with two seconds left for the last of his career-high 15 points. ""It was great to win a game early in the season where we didn't fill up the stat sheet,"" Red Flash coach Rob Krimmel said. ""We played with more purpose and togetherness in the second half. We executed the game plan much better on both ends."" Ace Talbert leads the team in scoring at 11.7 ppg through three games, while Bobby Rosenberger is chipping in 10 ppg. Penn State has won the last six meetings in the series, including an 83-53 victory last season at home. St. Francis' last win in the series came in 1978. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Each league's trio of finalists were revealed on Monday night. Skenes, the star Pittsburgh Pirates right-handed pitcher, is up against Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Jackson Chourio and San Diego Padres outfielder Jackson Merrill. Skenes is the leading candidate in the National League after claiming the award from multiple publications since the end of his first season.  The No. 1 pick in the 2023 MLB Draft, Skenes was promoted from the minors to the Pirates' rotation on May 11. He led baseball in ERA from that point forward and became the fifth rookie pitcher to start the All-Star Game.  Skenes, 22, was 11-3 with a 1.96 ERA, 170 strikeouts and 0.95 WHIP in 2024. Merrill had 162 hits in 156 games, batting .292 with 61 extra-base hits (24 home runs, 31 doubles, six triples) and 90 RBIs. Chourio, in his first year in the big leagues for Milwaukee, batted .275 with 21 homers, 79 RBIs and 22 stolen bases in 148 games, splitting his time between left and right field. A starting pitcher is also favored on the AL side. Yankees right-hander Luis Gil, who had seven career appearances before 2024, quickly earned a spot in the team's starting rotation and finished the year with a 15-7 record, a 3.50 ERA, 171 strikeouts and a league-high 77 walks in 151 2/3 innings. He had 17 starts with one run or zero runs allowed. His New York batterymate Austin Wells appeared in 115 games and hit .229 with 13 homers and 55 RBIs. The third AL finalist is Baltimore Orioles outfielder Colton Cowser, who became an everyday player for the O's and batted .242 with 24 homers and 69 RBIs in 153 games. MLB will announce the winners in both leagues on Nov. 18.  Gil and Skenes were named rookies of the year in their respective leagues by Baseball Digest earlier this month.

Quatraro, 50, oversaw a stunning turnaround for the Royals, who were coming off a lifeless 56-106 last-place finish in 2023. A similar roster in 2024 became a winning squad under Quatraro's direction, going 86-76 with a second-place finish in the American League Central. This year's Royals earned a 2-0 sweep of the Baltimore Orioles in the AL wild-card series before dropping an AL Division Series to the New York Yankees three games to one. Quatraro will have stiff competition in the AL from two divisional rivals, A.J. Hinch of the Detroit Tigers and Stephen Vogt of the Cleveland Guardians. Hinch matched Quatraro by directing an 86-76 club that found postseason success. Hinch's Tigers swept the Houston Astros 2-0 in the other AL wild-card series and pushed the Guardians to five games in the ALDS before losing 3-2. Meanwhile, the first-place Guardians and Vogt had the most successful season of the bunch, winning 92 games and taking that postseason series with Detroit to make their first AL Championship Series since 2016. They lost in five games (4-1) to the Yankees. The nominees for the award in the National League were Pat Murphy of the Milwaukee Brewers, Mike Shildt of the San Diego Padres and Carlos Mendoza of the New York Mets. Murphy and Shildt each helmed 93-69 squads that made the postseason. While Murphy saw his season come to an end at the hands of Mendoza's 89-73 Mets, Shildt piloted the Padres to a 2-0 wild-card series win over the Atlanta Braves. Mendoza's squad went on to defeat the Philadelphia Phillies 3-1 in an NL Division Series to make the NL Championship Series, their first since 2015. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

South Carolina fell to North Florida in its opener before bouncing back with an 86-64 rout of South Carolina State on Friday. Jacobi Wright scored a career-best 20 points and Collin Murray-Boyles had 19 points and a career-high 16 rebounds. Murray-Boyles leads the Gamecocks in scoring (17 points per game) and rebounding (11.5). Wright is averaging 16 points on 72.2 percent shooting (13-of-18) and a team-best 4.5 assists. Wright also knocked down four 3-pointers against South Carolina State. ""Jacobi Wright, just in his DNA as a basketball player, is the kind of guy who's going to do those things more often,"" South Carolina coach Lamont Paris said of Wright. The Gamecocks never trailed, boasted a 51-36 rebounding edge and held South Carolina State to 3-of-16 shooting from 3-point range. But Paris wasn't pleased with his own team's long-range shooting. South Carolina was 8-of-27 -- Wright was 4-of-7 and the rest of the team was 4-of-20. ""I can't make them make it,"" Paris said. ""All I can do is provide the environment that they feel comfortable taking those shots."" Towson (1-1) split its first two games, losing at Saint Mary's in its opener before shellacking USCAA member Penn State Wilkes-Barre 89-34 on Friday. Tomiwa Sulaiman made a career-high six points while scoring 20 points and Tyler Tejada added 15. The Tigers made 14 3-pointers, two shy of the school record. Tejada leads Towson with a 16.5 scoring average and Dylan Williamson is contributing 12.5 per game. The Tigers would certainly like to post an attention-grabbing victory after stringing together three straight seasons of 20 or more wins. Towson hasn't played in the NCAA Tournament since 1991 but this group has made it a goal to end the long drought. ""We're going to take it one day at a time, one game at a time,"" Tigers guard Nendah Tarke recently said. ""We know that that's our end goal. We're far from that now, but if we keep up with the right habits and doing the right things, everything should take care of itself."" This is the third meeting between the schools. South Carolina won both of the first two with the most recent matchup being a 65-55 victory on Dec. 30, 1997. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Following the Utes' 22-21 home loss to rival BYU on Saturday night that dropped Utah to 4-5 and 1-5 in the conference, Harlan unloaded on the officiating and the conference itself. ""This game was absolutely stolen from us,"" Harlan said. ""We were excited about being in the Big 12, but tonight I am not. We won this game. Someone else stole it from us. Very disappointed."" Those comments led to a fairly swift reaction from the league, which reprimanded Harlan with the fine and a statement Sunday. ""Mark's comments irresponsibly challenged the professionalism of our officials and the integrity of the Big 12 Conference,"" Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark said. ""There is a right way and a wrong way to voice concerns. Unfortunately, Mark chose the wrong way. Accordingly, this violation warrants a public reprimand and financial penalty. The Big 12 Conference prioritizes professionalism, integrity, and fairness, and will continue to do so."" Down 21-19, a holding penalty called on Utah cornerback Zemaiah Vaughn on fourth down negated a sack and gave BYU the ball at its own 19 with about 90 seconds left. The Cougars then drove down the field for a game-winning 44-yard field goal. With the win, which came before the largest crowd (54,383) ever at Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City, No. 9 BYU moved to 9-0, 6-0 in the conference, to stay firmly in the mix for a College Football Playoff berth. ""I recognize that there are more appropriate times and avenues to express those concerns, and I accept the consequences of my decision,"" Harlan said in a statement. ""My comments came after having just left our team locker room where our student-athletes were hurting and upset. The University of Utah is proud to be a member of the Big 12 Conference and we look forward to working with our peers to continue to enhance the league."" The game was the first between the two as conference mates since 2010 when both teams left the Mountain West Conference. Utah joined the Big 12 along with three other Pac-12 teams this summer. BYU joined the conference in 2023. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

As part of the series, the Nets will take on the alternate identity of “Les Nets” during their six Quebec-based games. The team’s temporary red-and-blue logo features two fleur-de-lis on a blue circle, a nod to the Quebec flag. A large red circle within the blue includes Montreal’s Mount Royal cross, stylized to represent a basketball while incorporating the city name. The incorporation of red isn’t because the Long Island Nets typically use red (I mean, of course, it is); it’s a tribute to Montreal’s McGill University, where James Naismith, the inventor of basketball, taught in the 1880s. “Montreal has a vibrant basketball legacy, and this partnership presents a unique opportunity to blend our culture with the Laval community,” said Morgan Taylor, Head of Business Operations for the Long Island Nets, in the press release. “We look forward to engaging with a new fanbase and creating memorable moments both on and off the court.” The arrangement brings up memories of the unique situation Minor League Baseball’s Buffalo Bisons found themselves in during the 2021 season. With their MLB affiliate from Toronto residing in their home stadium due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Bisons shifted their home games to Trenton, NJ. They played with a split identity, using their usual Bisons name and uniforms on the road but taking on that of the Trenton Thunder at home.

Senior leadership will lie to you and say that they do not know, but if you ask the DSA crew leads and specialists what they are experiencing in the field, they will tell you.

In April, the 53-year-old senator voted against the $95 billion in U.S. aid to Ukraine and has urged the eastern European nation to negotiate an end to its war with Russia. Yes, it seems like Rubio has begun aligning himself with the Trump agenda when it comes to foreign conflicts, and he appears to be on the fast track to the Secretary of State position. The other reported pick is a bit more out of left field: South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as the Director of Homeland Security.  Noem would replace the utterly awful Alejandro Mayorkas in overseeing Customs and Border Patrol, FEMA, ICE, and the Secret Service. And if there is anyone who is going to run their department as a Trump loyalist who will fight for the President's agenda, you can expect Noem to do so. Other key positions reportedly filled by the President-elect include: Chief of Staff: Susie Wiles, Trump's 2024 campaign manager. National Security Adviser: Mike Waltz, 3-term Florida Congressman, National Guard veteran, and former Pentagon policy adviser. Border Czar: Tom Homan.  (Enough said.) United Nations Ambassador: Elise Stefanik, Congresswoman, New York. MAGA Republican. Third-ranking member of Congress after replacing Liz Cheney as House Republican Conference Chair. Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy: Stephen Miller. Yes, that Stephen Miller. The man behind Trump's immigration agenda since 2015. Environmental Protection Agency: Lee Zeldin, Congressman, New York. MAGA Republican. A mix of insiders and outsiders, but, so far, there's no doubt that all of these folks are Trump picks and Trump loyalists, which appears to be his primary motivation for selecting his cabinet.

And then the fog of grief that has enveloped me, and the worry for my trans child and my gay sister, and all of you, and not knowing if I can minister to anyone today.

Don Bacon (R-Neb.) and David Valadao (R-Calif.), while defeating several vulnerable Democratic incumbents. State Rep. Ryan Mackenzie (R-Pa.) unseated Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.), while businessman Rob Bresnahan defeated Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Pa.).

Domski worked for Blue Cross Blue Shield in the state for 30 years, and was 100% remote during the pandemic (as well as 75% remote previously) while working as an IT specialist. Despite requesting a religious exemption for the Covid vax, Blue Cross refused, triggering a lawsuit from Domski, who claimed she was a victim of religious discrimination. Her attorney, Jon Marko, said this in a statement: Our forefathers fought and died for the freedom for each American to practice his or her own religion. Neither the government nor a corporation has a right to force an individual to choose between his or her career and conscience. Lisa refused to renounce her faith and beliefs and was wrongfully terminated from the only job she had ever known. The jury's verdict today tells BCBSM that religious discrimination has no place in America and affirms each person's right to religious freedom.  The jury awarded Domski $10 million in punitive damages, $1.7 million in lost wages, and $1 million in noneconomic damages. Meanwhile, Blue Cross is super sad that their corporate HR tyranny got slapped down: While Blue Cross respects the jury process and thanks the individual jurors for their service, we are disappointed in the verdict. Blue Cross is reviewing its legal options and will determine its path forward in the coming days.  Follow Ian on Substack or X (@ighaworth).

Not only is he leaving CNN, the fakest of the fake news, but he seems to be done with old media as a whole.

Starting this weekend, he will bring his Green Bay Packers loyalty and overall football insight to NFL Network’s NFL GameDay Morning. 
	The NFL revealed Weezy F Baby as their new weekly guest this past Monday (Nov. 11). He will join their already loaded cast which boasts Rich Eisen, Kurt Warner, Steve Mariucci, Ian Rapoport, Mike Garafolo, Tom Pelissero, and a slew of lauded reporters next Sunday (Nov. 17).  
	Wayne’s guest spot was first teased during halftime of the New York Giants’ and Carolina Panthers’ game on Sunday morning (Nov. 10), live from Munich, Germany. The “A Milli” rapper is no stranger to talking sports, as he recently was a recurring guest on FS1’s Undisputed starring Skip Bayless.

	








 Lil Wayne will appear on ""NFL GameDay Morning"" every Sunday as a regular guest for the rest of the season, starting November 17.pic.twitter.com/FCJPzGjHT0 
	Lil Wayne’s history of sports talk goes back even further than that. He used to contribute blog posts to ESPN The Magazine and joined Around The Horn as a guest in 2009. He even found creative ways to bring together football and music, like his 2011 track “Green & Yellow” which was an homage to the Green Bay Packers. In 2016, he created “No Mercy” which was Shannon Sharpe and Skip Bayless’ theme song on Undisputed.

He had expressed his desire to perform less than a year ago and admitted that it “broke him” to not be picked.  
	“That hurt. It hurt a lot,” he said in a video. “I blame myself for not being mentally prepared for a letdown. And for automatically mentally putting myself in that position like somebody told me that was my position. So I blame myself for that. But I thought that was nothing better than that spot and that stage and that platform in my city, so it hurt. It hurt a whole lot.” Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox",2024-11-12

Sports Collectors Daily,Graded 1986-87 Fleer Basketball Sets Now Part of Jersey Fusion Redemptions,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/jersey-fusion-1986-87-fleer-basketball-finale-edition/,"Mon, 11 Nov 2024 22:56:53 +0000","Dozens of Jordan rookie cards and Hall of Fame autographs were part of the original release. Now, redemption cards for complete sets of 1986-87 Fleer basketball are part of the 'Finale' of Jersey Fusion's ode to the original landmark product.","November 11, 2024 By Rich Mueller  Late last spring, cards from 50 complete sets of 1986-87 Fleer basketball and another hoard of 125 Michael Jordan rookie cards and stickers were put into a new product from Sportscards.com’s Jersey Fusion Line. Described as a years in the making “passion project” for company founder Bobby Poll, the Beckett encapsulated cards include small swatches of game-used gear used by the player on the card. Thousands of one card boxes were sold but six months later, the company has added some fresh content to the remaining inventory, including three redemption cards for fully PSA graded complete sets of cards and stickers, each with a Jordan rookie graded NM/MT 8.   The 1986-87 Fleer Jersey Fusion “Finale Edition” boxes also include a fourth redemption for a complete Jersey Fusion set of the 132 cards and 11 stickers that included the memorabilia pieces embedded in the holder. That set was originally pieced together by a collector who took advantage of the company’s offer last spring to trade it in for a game-worn, autographed 1991-92 Jordan jersey.  Sportscards.com is now giving that set back to the collecting community through the sales of the Finale edition. The product contains cards and memorabilia for all 131 players that were featured on the landmark Fleer set, which was the first in five years to be sold via wax packs.    At least three of the five boxes in a display case have autographed cards. Full cases contain six display cartons with a total of around 20 autographs. Some of the autographed cards carry inscriptions.  One of the biggest hits in the product One of the top pulls was an autographed Jordan rookie that carries a 9 autograph grade from Beckett and a portion of an NBA ‘Logoman’ patch from one of Jordan’s 1987-88 home uniforms. Other chase cards carry pieces of basketballs used in the NBA Finals.   Autographs from about 100 of the players in the set are possible, including Jordan, Julius Erving, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Charles Barkley and the late Bill Walton. A checklist that’s been pulled includes autographs of Erving, Bird and Johnson.  The back of each card in the product has a QR code on the reverse side that bring the collector to the site to see the original game-used  memorabilia item from which it was taken. Memorabilia used in the Jersey Fusion product came from jerseys, warm-ups, trunks, shoes, basketballs and even surfaces of NBA courts. Boxes and cases of the most recent edition are available here.  The previously released version, which still offers randomly packed Jordan rookie cards and stickers are still selling on eBay here.

Sports Collectors Daily,"After Tom Brady Signing Fiasco in Miami, Collectors Still Looking for Answers",https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/after-tom-brady-signing-fiasco-in-miami-collectors-still-looking-for-answers/,"Mon, 11 Nov 2024 03:29:39 +0000","Collectors who thought they could get a nice Tom Brady autograph on some valuable game-worn items and Super Bowl tickets are still frustrated, months after getting barely a scribble from the seven-time Super Bowl champ.","November 10, 2024 By Horacio Ruiz  More than six months after a much anticipated Tom Brady autograph signing in Miami, the collectors whose items were inked by Brady with an illegible scribble remain as disheartened, angry, and confused as the day it happened.  One collector is selling off his Brady collection, and another is trying to recoup some of his losses.  The entrance to Brad Jarrett’s house near Orlando, FL prominently featured his Brady memorabilia. The collection featured autographs and inscriptions on helmets, jerseys, and plaques. To Jarrett, Brady was a transcendent football player, but more importantly, a leader he hoped to emulate at his workplace.  “I’m still hurt by what happened at that event,” Jarrett told SC Daily. “I lost all my respect for Tom Brady.” What occurred at that event has been well documented. Brady was the keynote speaker for a business conference organized by EXMA Global, a marketing company specializing in leadership and development events.  As part of his appearance at the Watsco Center in Miami, Brady was contracted to sign about 100 items for patrons who paid $3,600 for a package deal that included Brady’s speech, a photo op and an autograph. The tickets also included a yacht tour of Downtown Miami and networking events at art galleries. Most of the attendees were there for business and networking opportunities and wouldn’t have requested Brady’s autograph on high value items.
 Before delivering a one-hour speech that the attendees praised, Brady was ushered into a room where the items collectors were hoping to have signed were located.  All were meticulously prepared for Brady by a local dealer named Salomon Lutwak. Instructions were placed by each item regarding where to sign with colored pens.    Lutwak, who lives in South Florida, wanted to get a Brady rookie card signed. He volunteered to prepare the items for the signing room because he was friends with many of the collectors in attendance.   When Brady entered the room, Lutwak was asked to leave by Brady’s handlers. When he returned, he couldn’t believe his eyes. Near the end of the speech, Lutwak approached Greg Nazareth, a friend of Jarrett’s, who was also at the conference.  “Bro, all the signatures look like s***,” Lutwak told Nazareth.  Lutwak recorded the room for 18 seconds, sending the clip to Nazareth, who then sent it to the other collectors. They were stunned.  One of the gems in Jarrett’s collection was a ticket from the 2000 NFL Draft, where Brady was famously picked 199th overall. It is one of a handful that are known to exist. From the moment he bought it, Jarrett knew it was the one item he wanted signed in person by Brady. He thought the signing session would be the time and place. He knew Brady’s signature wasn’t a work of art, but he expected it to be similar to others. As the event moved forward, Jarrett was unsure how his ticket had been signed. He didn’t see it in the short video circulating among the collectors. But he saw enough of the autographs on his friends’ items to get angry. He took the photo op to voice his displeasure directly with Brady.   “Tom, I saw the signatures, and it’s messed up what you did,” Jarrett recalls telling Brady. “It’s not right. I spent a lot of money on this.” He walked 30 feet off the stage, turned around, and found Brady staring at him.  “He looked at me like he was shocked I had said something,” Jarret said. “Or surprised that he impacted people with that autograph. I’m not really sure.
 “Brady just gave a great speech about effort and how when he started putting forward the effort in college, small gradual results started happening and that shaped him into giving 100% effort in everything he does. He just lied because he put 0% effort into his signing.”  Nazareth was next in line behind Jarrett, about nine feet away, when he saw Brady’s face. He brought the only known used Brady helmet in the hands of a collector to get signed – a Tampa Bay Buccaneers practice helmet. He considers himself lucky with the autograph he received.  “It wasn’t good,” said Nazareth of his autograph. “But it was better than some of the other crap I saw. Brady turned to [Brad] and gave him a look almost as if to apologize.” The events that unfolded in the room are still up for speculation, but what’s not up for debate is that Brady didn’t sign all the items with his customary autograph for some reason. Instead, some items were marked with a scribble that one would never have guessed came from the legendary quarterback. Brady is known to give a quick, shorthand autograph in large crowds, earning a moniker among collectors as Tornado Tom. However, in their opinion, most of the autographs were worse than those administered by Brady when in a rush.  Many of the items – rare collectibles and, in some instances, unique pieces – were no better off than if a child had taken a marker and scrawled across them.  It’s believed that Brady entered the room expecting to find items like copies of his book, “The TB12 Method,” and glossy photos to sign. Instead, he may have been taken aback to find rare one-of-a-kind items tracing the arc of his career and equipment he once wore on the field, like game-used Super Bowl balls, game-used cleats, the used practice helmet, and the NFL Draft ticket. Typically, Brady signs through Fanatics, with whom he has an exclusive autograph deal. Through Fanatics, Brady will sign items for $4,000. Game-used memorabilia carries a $10,000 fee. Many of the types of items he encountered that day would typically be channeled through Fanatics.  When Brady entered the signing room, he could have: Instead, Brady went with a fourth option, doling out an illegible scribble for many of the items that had been laid out for him. Brady did appear to sign some items in a condensed version that earned him the Tornado Tom nickname. But even those were few and mostly reserved for lower-end items like replica jerseys and pennants.  When Jarrett saw his autographed ticket, he was crushed. It looked a little better than the Super Bowl ticket Brady had signed for another collector, but not much. With his regular autograph, some items would have gone up in value by tens of thousands of dollars. “Tom is a smart guy, and he knows how much his signature adds to what items,” Jarrett said. “He doesn’t like people profiteering off him. If I was in his shoes, and there was all this collectible stuff, I’d be pissed too, but you don’t take it out on the fans. He could have not done it.” At the center of the dispute are the terms set by Brady’s representatives and EXMA Global Founder and CEO Fernando Anzures. Anzures admitted to not knowing much about the signing portion of the event. He sourced that responsibility to Fernando Regato, a sports collector based out of Mexico, who used the EXMA Conference as an opportunity to run his first-ever signing event.  It’s believed that Anzures sold the signing portion of the event to Regato and left it up to him to coordinate and iron out the details.  If the contract between EXMA Global and Brady included a clause about the type of items that could be signed, that wasn’t communicated to the collectors who attended.     Brady’s signing and photo op for the VIPs were a small portion of the EXMA Global Conference that ran through the weekend. However, to the collectors who bought the tickets for $3,600, the autograph opportunity was the primary draw. A handful of die-hard Brady collectors first learned about the signing on the Tom Brady Collectors Group on Facebook.  Derek Wagner, a high-end Brady collector for more than 20 years, was excited about flying to Miami to meet Brady and take a picture with him. He learned about signing on Facebook and became the liaison between himself and four other collectors, including Jarrett, Nazareth, and Regato.  “It was supposed to be one of the greatest times of my life,” Wagner told SC Daily. “How many people get to meet Tom Brady and get his autograph? He’s been my idol for 20-plus years.” The exact terms between Brady and EXMA are unknown, but it appears the seven-time Super Bowl champion wasn’t expecting to see a room with multiple high-value items.  “Regato was telling us any item would be signed,” Jarrett said. “We were wondering, ‘Is this for real?’ We asked a bunch of questions.” “I knew Brady is signed exclusively through Fanatics,” Nazareth said. “We knew he doesn’t do these public signings. But finally, enough of us bit, and we did the event.” Each $3,600 ticket would get one item signed. Wagner bought 15 tickets, six for him, one each for Jarrett and Nazareth, and seven tickets for two other collectors. He paid a portion of the tickets with a credit card and arranged with Regato to pay the remainder in cash. The cash came from Regato, who purchased two game-used Super Bowl balls from Wagner at the event. Regato included those two Super Bowl items in the signing, ironically receiving subpar Brady autographs.  The items Wagner submitted were:  In the aftermath, Anzures admitted to knowing less than he should have about the signing’s details. But he also pledged to make things right. Some wanted a full refund. Wagner filed a dispute with his credit card company, which Anzures did not fight. That resulted in a partial $1,900 refund for each ticket bought. However, Wagner says Regato never reimbursed him for the portion paid in cash.  The tickets were purchased under Wagner’s name, and he felt responsible for getting the money back for his friends.  “He straight up told me he doesn’t have it,” Wagner said of Regato. “He said, ‘I have $8,000 to my name and you can have it.’ I didn’t want $8,000. I wanted the entire thing refunded.” Anzures fully refunded some collectors who were trying to get rookie cards signed, according to USA Today, because Brady did not sign them due to his exclusive autographed card deal with Fanatics. Wagner says Regato told him that Anzures even refunded some collectors their flights and hotels. SC Daily contacted Anzures on multiple occasions, but he did not respond to our interview request.  After the event, Jarrett decided to write directly to Brady via his official Facebook and Instagram accounts.  “I was heartbroken when I saw pictures of the signatures before meeting you,” Jarrett wrote. “I hate admitting it as a grown man, but I was fighting back tears telling you this because I had envisioned the moment so differently. But I had to speak up for what I felt was right.” He wrote him about the 2000 NFL Draft ticket he had purchased less than a year before the signing.  “This ticket meant a lot to me. I had spent years hunting it down, and there have only been three known to come up. For me, this item represented that no matter where others rank you, you can turn yourself into greatness by hard work and dedication. I considered myself blessed that my prized possession wasn’t as messed up as others, but it still hurts, and I wish I had never attended this event.” Jarrett never heard back from anyone.  Wagner is a well-known collector and dealer in the northeast and Massachusetts. He had done various signings with former Red Sox and Patriots players. He reached out to multiple players who could help connect him with Brady, but no one was willing to try.  “Nobody was willing to give us a shot,” Wagner said. “I had never seen anything like it. It’s like they were scared of him.” Within a week of the event in Miami, Jarret, Nazareth and Wagner were referred to a Florida law firm with experience working cases involving celebrities. Over five months, Jarrett and Nazareth discussed scenarios where they sued Anzures and EXMA, Brady, or both. But Jarrett and Nazareth increasingly felt it would be a difficult case. After all, Brady had signed their items – and it would be difficult to argue any intentionally malicious destruction of property.  Ultimately, the firm wanted a $50,000 retainer plus a contingency fee from any monetary wins. The three men countered with a higher percentage for the contingency fee and lower retainer, but the firm declined.  At the same time, Wagner was talking to a prominent Boston-based lawyer. The lawyer agreed to work on a contingency basis, but after a month he told Wagner there wasn’t a case.  “The lawyer was working on it for a month, and he came up with three things we could go after him for, but then he said they’re not valid points,” Wagner said. “He said, ‘If this ever goes to court, there’s no case.’”  Now, it appears that a lawsuit won’t happen. “We were getting exhausted with what was going on,” Jarrett said. “At the time, Derek had made a deal with Goldin Auctions, where he was going to auction off all of the items that he had signed as long as he had consigned all the items with them.” Wagner still felt the weight of the responsibility for being the point person between the collectors and Anzures/Regato. While he was able to file a successful claim with his credit card company, the group was still down $26,000 from the trip to Miami.  Wagner was contacted by a representative from Goldin Auctions, who felt they could sell his six items for a premium, given the provenance from the Miami event and because of the controversial autographs on them. Goldin would give Wagner a bonus for consigning all six items from the signing with the auction house. Wagner would use the bonus to make everyone “whole” from the event and compensate for the cash that was never reimbursed. Wagner would also keep whatever amount the items sold for. But after three signed items were auctioned off in late September, Wagner broke the contract and pulled the other three items from being auctioned off. “They were very confident the items were going to sell for more than normal pieces because they were from this high-profile event,” Wagner said. “But they sold for all-time lows because the autographs clearly destroyed them.” A game-used cleat signed by Brady sold for $4,575, with a buyer’s premium. In all, Wagner says he lost $22,000 with the sale of the three items, including what he paid to get them signed.  “I signed a contract saying they would sell my other three items, and I broke the contract,” Wagner said. “My goal was to refund these other guys in full. I didn’t mind getting rid of my stuff to help everyone out. But I couldn’t keep taking that kind of beating.”  As a result, Goldin revoked the bonus. Wagner still has the Brady to Gronkowski Super Bowl ball, a Super Bowl 55 photo-matched game ball, and a game-used ball from the 2000 NFL Hall of Fame Game – Brady’s pro debut.  All the collectors remain baffled by what happened that day.  They wonder why Brady signed the way he did. Nazareth believes Brady didn’t know those items belonged to collectors but might have thought they belonged to the event organizers trying to take advantage of him.  “I think he knew exactly what he was doing,” Nazareth says. “I’ve followed Brady since he was in high school. He’s humble, he’s friendly, I think he genuinely cares about his fan base. The speech he gave for an hour was amazing and it’s stuff like that that makes me love the guy. I think he thought he might’ve been doing it to people who were trying to get one over him. Trust me, I was not trying to get one over him.”  A fan outside of the Watsco Center who did not attend the event was lucky enough to have a football signed with a nice autograph.  The ticket Jarrett was so eager to have signed by Brady is now in a closet, hidden in a bin along with other Brady programs and items. The ticket was sent to JSA for authentication, where three months after being sent, the autograph was authenticated.    “I am planning on holding onto the ticket for right now,” Jarrett says, “but I’m not really sure what I will do with it going forward. I’ve been slowly selling some of my smaller Brady items, but the collectible market is down right now. If I could break even on all my items, I would sell it all.” Wagner wants to know why Brady signed the way he did. He doesn’t want money or anything else signed; he just wants a direct answer.  “I have completely lost every ounce of respect I had for Brady, which is terrible because I was one of the biggest Brady collectors out there,” Wagner said. “I just want the stuff out of my house. I would love to know why he did that. Maybe he wasn’t trying to be an a-hole. I don’t know his side.  “As much as Tom is a celebrity and a GOAT, he’s human. He could’ve lost his temper. Just let us know what happened unless he was really out to get us, which I would find really hard to believe.” Horacio is an educator and writer living in Staten Island, NY.

Sports Collectors Daily,1 of Few Surviving 1919 World Series Rings Consigned to Auction,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/1-of-few-surviving-1919-world-series-rings-consigned-to-auction/,"Sun, 10 Nov 2024 19:21:26 +0000",One of only a few known rings from the Reds-Black Sox World Series of 1919 is making its auction debut after consignment by the family of the Reds' shortstop.,"November 10, 2024 By Rich Mueller  It would become tainted by scandal, but the Cincinnati Reds weren’t about to let a championship go by without honoring those who made it happen.  Now, 105 years after it ended, a 1919 World Series ring has emerged and is on the auction block. Presented to shortstop Larry Kopf, the gold ring with a small diamond in the center, was a late consignment to next weekend’s Louisville Slugger Factory & Museum Auction by the Kopf family.  It’s expected to sell for $25,000-$50,000.   1919 World Series rings were originally created as 14k gold pins and are extremely rare.  Three, including one given to Kopf, were fashioned into rings. Championship rings didn’t become popular until later as they were associated more with women’s apparel at the time.  Kopf’s wife Erma wore the ring for many years and it has some moderate wear.  It has an inset diamond with a baseball field and “1919 World’s Champions” engraving. “The pin façade was then affixed atop a simple gold ring band with the perimeter of the top being slightly shortened and pin back removed during that same process,” Hunt Auctions notes in its auction description.  The Reds’ victory over the Chicago White Sox was an upset.  Gamblers struck a deal with members of the Sox to throw the series but after the deal soured, the Sox attempted to rally. However, the Reds emerged to win the first title in franchise history. Kopf was one of the better shortstops on the era. He played in all eight games of the series, collecting six hits, including a two-run triple in Game 2 and the go-ahead run in Game 4. Embed from Getty Images Hunt calls the ring “one of the most coveted baseball award scarcities of its type with relation to one of the most infamous events in the history of the game.” Bidding is open now and concludes this Saturday, with a live finale at the Louisville Slugger Factory & Museum.

Sports Collectors Daily,Veterans Day: Honoring Athletes Who Served,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/veterans-day-honoring-athletes-who-served/,"Sun, 10 Nov 2024 19:11:02 +0000","A look at a few athletes who put country, duty and honor ahead of sports and the cards we remember them by.","November 10, 2024 By Bob D'Angelo  As the United States honors its military veterans on this Veterans Day, it’s instructive to understand that some very real sacrifices were made by athletes to keep the country free. Some  paid with their lives; others sacrificed the primes of their athletic careers to serve in the military. Some are household names. Willie Mays, Joe DiMaggio and Jackie Robinson come to mind. Hank Greenberg was the first American League player to register for America’s first peacetime draft, taking the oath on May 7, 1941. He was discharged on December 5, 1941, but re-enlisted the following February after Pearl Harbor was attacked two days after his honorable discharge. Greenberg would miss 3 1/2 seasons before returning in 1945. Others athletes have been obscured by history, but are just as important. One who comes to mind is Eddie Grant, one of the few players killed during World War I. The New York Giants had a plaque dedicated to his memory at the Polo Grounds on Memorial Day, 1921. It would take a lengthy series to mention all of those military heroes, but here are just a few: Jack Lummus
 Lummus was a defensive end for the New York Giants. One month after New York lost the NFL’s Eastern Division title to the Chicago Bears, Lummus became an officer in the Marine Corps. Lummus, who also starred collegiately at Baylor, distinguished himself at Iwo Jima in 1945 and received the Congressional Medal of Honor. He continued to fight despite being injured in the shoulder and helped his platoon eliminate fortified enemy positions. He stepped on a land mine, which blew off both his legs. As doctors tried to save him, Lummus was quoted as saying, “Well, doc, the New York Giants lost a mighty good end today.” Lummus was one of 23 NFL players killed during World War II.  He didn’t have any cards during his playing days but Tri-Star’s Obak series has honored him. Yogi Berra He might have been famous for his pithy statements and a stellar baseball career — three American League MVP awards, a 15-time all-star, and catcher/outfielder for 14 pennant winners (and 10 World Series champions) and manager for the 1964 A.L. champion Yankees — but Lawrence Peter Berra saw some major action during World War II. Berra served in the Navy from 1944 to 1945, joining the armed forces as an 18-year-old. He was a gunner’s mate on a landing craft on D-Day, as Allied troops stormed Omaha Beach on the Normandy coast on June 6, 1944. Berra told interviewer Keith Olbermann that the attack “was like the Fourth of July.” “I said, “Boy, it looks pretty, all the planes coming over.” And I was looking out and my officer said, “you better get your head down in here, if you want it on.’” Berra would keep his head and go on to a Hall of Fame baseball career, one that included cards and autographs from 1948-present. Bob Feller “Rapid Robert” won 266 games during his 18 seasons with the Cleveland Indians. He won 20 games six times, including 27 in 1940. He also lost nearly four years of pitching time, enlisting in the Navy the day after Pearl Harbor was attacked in 1941. In the three years leading up to his enlistment, Feller won 24, 27 and 25 games. When he returned from the war he put together 26- and 20-win seasons. It’s fair to say that Feller would have won more than 300 games had World War II not interrupted his career. Feller was signing autographs before a spring training game in Winter Haven, Florida, about a decade ago. One fan told him it was a shame that he lost so many prime seasons to the war effort. Feller didn’t even hesitate. “I’d do it all over again,” he said. Feller was not happy serving in a special physical fitness program. He enrolled in gunnery school and was assigned to the USS Alabama in late 1942. He spent the next 26 months as the Alabama’s chief specialist in charge of a crew that controlled the ship’s anti-aircraft equipment. Feller was involved in several battles in the Pacific, including skirmishes in the Gilbert and Marshall island chains.  He was used in numerous War-era advertising campaigns which are very popular collectibles today and appeared in the ‘Armed Forces’ subset of this year’s Panini Cooperstown set. Rocky Bleier After being drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1968 and playing a season, Bleier was drafted by the U.S. Army and shipped to Vietnam in May 1969. He was part of the 196th Light Infantry Brigade and took a load of shrapnel in his leg during fighting. He was awarded a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star, but doctors told Bleier he’d never play football again. Undaunted, Bleier returned to the Steelers in 1971 and became the blocking back for Franco Harris. He played 130 regular-season games and 10 playoff contests over the next decade and won four rings as a member of Pittsburgh’s four Super Bowl championship teams. Bleier included some Army inscriptions on this rather unique signed Steelers helmet.  His rookie card was in the 1975 Topps set and he appeared in a few others as well. Bob Kalsu He was an All-American offensive tackle in 1967 at Oklahoma, the year the Sooners went 10-1 and beat Tennessee in the Orange Bowl. Bob Kalsu was drafted in 1968 by the Buffalo Bills and by season’s end was voted the team’s rookie of the year. In 1969, he was called to serve in Vietnam, leaving his pregnant wife Jan and 10-month-old daughter Jill.  A 1st lieutenant for the 11th artillery unit of the 101st Airborne unit, Kalsu was killed on July 21, 1970, at the remote Firebase Ripcord in Thua Thien, along with 60 other fellow soldiers. At the time of his death, Kalsu and his unit had been pinned down for weeks by enemy fire. He was the only active NFL player to die in the Vietnam war. Early on July 23, 1970, Jan Kalsu gave birth to a son, named Robert Todd Kalsu. That afternoon, a uniformed Army officer informed the family of the death of Bob Kalsu. Later that night, Jan changed the boy’s name to James Robert Kalsu Jr. In 2000, the Bills added Kalsu’s name to the Wall of Fame at Ralph Wilson Stadium. Kalsu also appears in the Obak sets. Warren Spahn Spahn is the winningest left-handed pitcher in major-league history with 363 victories. He won 2o or more games 13 times and won the Cy Young Award in 1957, receiving 15 out of a possible 16 votes after a 21-11 season. Spahn made his major-league debut with the Boston Braves in 1942, but had no decisions in four games. He spent the next three seasons in the Army with the 276th Engineer Combat Battalion, the 1159th Engineer Combat Group. Spahn’s unit fought in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, and then monitored and protected the flow of traffic over the Ludendorff Bridge — the only bridge spanning the Rhine River that allowed passage into Germany. A staff sergeant, Spahn was injured by shards of shrapnel in his foot as the Germans maintained a steady, daily fire. Spahn was awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart and was promoted to 1st lieutenant. Topps included him in its 2007 Distinguished Service set. Ted Williams  One of major-league baseball’s greatest hitters and the last player to bat .400 in a season, Williams had a career .344 average and hit 521 home runs. He won the Triple Crown in 1942 and ’47 and was a two-time American League MVP. Williams enlisted in the Navy after the 1942 season. His goal was to become a Naval fighter pilot, and by May 1944 he had earned his wings and was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant. Until June 1945, he served as an instructor with the U.S. Marine Corps reserves. Williams also served a second stint in the military, recall
ed in 1952 and deployed with Marine Aircraft Group 33 to Korea. Williams flew 39 combat missions over Korea before being relieved due to complications from an ear infection. He had missed most of the 1952 and ‘’53 baseball seasons, but returned full time in 1954 and remained with the Red Sox until his retirement after the 1960 season. He homered in his final at-bat, on September 28, 1960. His best cards span three decades. Pat Tillman Tillman would have turned 38 on November 6. He was the first NFL player to be killed in combat since Bob Kalsu in 1970. Tillman is the only player to ever give up a multimillion dollar contract to serve his country, and he did it voluntarily. Tillman turned down a three-year, $3.6 million offer from the Arizona Cardinals after the 2001 season and enlisted in the Army.  He appeared in the 2001 Upper Deck set. Joining the Army Rangers was motivated by the September 11 attacks. Tillman already was an all-pro safety with the Cardinals and was 25 in 2002, entering the prime of his career. He was deployed to Iraq, then was serving in Afghanistan when he was killed by friendly fire on April 22, 2004. After his death, the Pat Tillman Foundation was established, in hopes of inspiring and supporting individuals seeking positive change in themselves and the world. Eddie LeBaron The left-handed “Littlest General” was drafted by the Washington Redskins in 1950. He played two preseason games, then entered the Korean War as a 2nd lieutenant with the Marines. He was wounded twice during his nine-month hitch in Korea and won a Purple Heart. He also won a Bronze Star. LeBaron appears in several 1950s and 60s football sets. Forest K. Ferguson Jr. “Fergie” is the classic case of what could have been. The second All-American in University of Florida history, Ferguson set the pass receiving record at Florida with a 74-yard catch against Miami in 1941. He had received letters from several NFL teams, including the Steelers and Lions, but his mission after graduation was to enlist in the Army. Ferguson distinguished himself at D-Day, helping to blow a gap in the German lines on Omaha Beach. He was mortally wounded that day, halting his athletic career. Ferguson would die from his wounds in 1954, nearly 10 years to the day after the Normandy landings. Florida named an annual award after Ferguson, presenting it to the Gators senior who displays leadership and courage. I don’t believe any cards have been released of Ferguson, but I know of at least one recent book written about him. Bob has been a sportswriter and copy editor for more than 45 years and a blogger for two decades.

Sports Collectors Daily,1974 WHA Canada-Soviet Summit Series Celebrates 50th Anniversary,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/1974-wha-canada-soviet-summit-series-celebrates-50th-anniversary/,"Fri, 08 Nov 2024 02:31:40 +0000","Bobby Hull, Gordie Howe and others reflect on the 1974 WHA Canada-Soviet series as the ""Forgotten Series"" marks its 50th anniversary.","November 7, 2024 By Jeff Morris  Rick Smith reflected on the 50th anniversary of the second Canada-Soviet hockey series, which took place in the fall of 1974. Like the 1972 Summit Series, the second Canada-Soviet series was an eight-game affair with four games in Canada and then four in Moscow. The difference, however, was that the Canadian team would be comprised of WHA players and not NHL players. Smith, now 76, lives along a big lake near Westport, Ontario, north of Kingston. He makes sure he has a perfect sheet of ice on the lake through the winter, and is out on the blades almost daily. He still participates in alumni events with the Boston Bruins and Ottawa Senators. “It was really exciting to be asked to play for Canada in the series,” Smith said. “It was more than a Canada-Russia thing for us. It was a chance for us to represent the WHA and show that we were on par with the NHL.” Smith won a Stanley Cup with the Boston Bruins in 1970 and was traded to the California Golden Seals in 1972. Bruins goalie Gerry Cheevers jumped to the WHA’s Cleveland Crusaders and thus was left off the 1972 Canadian team, as only NHL players were allowed to participate. Bobby Hull was among the other players left off the 1972 team. Cheevers pushed for Smith to be part of the team, as Smith was a steady defender who was always in position and fundamentally sound. By 1974, Smith was playing for the Minnesota Fighting Saints of the WHA. The bulk of the players on Team Canada were former NHLers who jumped to the new league. Frank Mahovlich, Paul Henderson and Pat Stapleton played in the 1972 series as they were still in the NHL. Gordie Howe and Bobby Hull did not play for Canada in 1972. Hull had jumped to the Winnipeg Jets for hockey’s first million-dollar contract. Howe retired before the 1972 series, but then came out of retirement the following year to join the Houston Aeros of the WHA and play with his sons, Mark and Marty. “I remember the time leading up to the 1972 series, and no one really thought they had a chance against the best players in the NHL,” Howe said during an interview with SCD several years ago. “They were amateurs, and they had won all these world championships, but they had never played actual professionals.” Howe, like every other hockey-loving Canadian, was shocked when the Soviets upset Team Canada 7-3 in the first game. What ensued was the most dramatic and globally important tournament in hockey history. “As the series went on, and the Canadians came together and won the series, all of us watched,” Howe said. “There was no way we could lose that series. It meant to much. All of these players who battled each other night after night for years all came together – the players playing for Canada as well as all of us at home watching on TV. I was 44 years old at the time and thought my hockey career was over, but as the series went on, I wished I was over there and a part of it. I think all of the NHL players watching probably felt the same way.” In 1974, Howe got the opportunity to play in the series with his sons, Mark and Marty. “I wasn’t sure what to expect, but the first time I put that Canada sweater on, it was a special feeling. Then I looked over in the dressing room and I saw Mark and Marty put their sweaters on. I was so proud as a father that my sons were playing for Canada. Getting to play with them for Canada in that series was a feeling I can’t really describe.” Howe was 46 years old in the 1974 series but was still a dominant force, as he had seven goals in seven games. Bobby Hull, meanwhile, was the player the world was watching. He led the tournament with seven goals and two assists for nine points in eight games. “I get asked about the 1976 Canada Cup a lot, and I am often asked about missing the 1972 series,” Hull said in an interview with SCD in the early 2000s. “But I rarely get asked about the 1974 series. “I was not happy about not being able to play in the 1972 series. That’s why I was so happy to get the chance to play for Canada in 1974. We had a very talented team and we were better than people thought we were. The series was not just a chance to play the Russians. It was a chance to show the world that our league was just as good as the NHL.” The feeling was different for Game 1 in 1974 compared to 1972. Hockey fans in Canada knew nothing about the Soviets when the 1972 series began. In 1974, the Soviet stars were household names in Canada. Aside from Howe, Hull, Henderson, Mahovlich and Cheevers, Canada had its share of household names on its roster. John “Pie” McKenzie, Rejean Houle, Ralph Backstrom, Mike “Shakey” Walton, Tom Webster, J.C. Tremblay and Rick Ley were among the stars on the team. Le Colisee in Quebec City only seated a little more than 15,000. There was a lottery in Quebec for the rights to buy tickets. Two million lottery tickets were sold for the rights to those 15,000 tickets. The WHA Team Canada got off to a better start than the 1972 team. Trailing 3-2, Hull scored the tying goal with 5:42 remaining. Canada had a chance to get the win late in the game. “I found Frank Mahovlich with a long pass and sent him in on a breakaway,” Smith recalled. “Unfortunately, Tretiak made the save, and I missed my chance to get on the scoresheet.” Smith did get on the scoresheet in the series, as he led Canada with 14 penalty minutes. Game 2 was played in Toronto, and Canada won 4-1. Game 3 in Winnipeg was won by the Soviets 8-5. In Game 4 in Vancouver, Hull scored three goals in the first period and Canada led 5-2, but the Soviets came back and managed a 5-5 tie. In Game 3, Canadian coach Billy Harris decided to sit some of the star players to let some of the other players get some playing time. Goalie Gerry Cheevers missed the game, as he was at the hospital tending to his father who was seriously ill. Don McLeod took his place. Howe, Mahovlich, Ley, House and Brad Selwood were all scratches for Canada in Game 3 in favor of players got their first taste of action in the series. “That changed everything for us,” Howe said. “We wanted to win. Once we realized that giving everyone ice time was more important than winning, the intensity seemed to disappear for us.” In 1972, some of the players on the roster who had been scratched and did not get playing time quit the team and went home. Harris wanted to avoid that from happened from his team, but he swung the pendulum too far the other way. In Game 4, with their “A” line-up back on the ice, the teams played to a 5-5 tie. Hull scored three goals in the first period, but the Soviets chipped away at Canada’s 5-2 lead. Late in the third period, Alexander Maltsev and Alexander Gusev scored for the Soviets to tie the game. “When I do autograph signings and meet fans, they often talk about their favorite moments of my career,” Hull said. “That hat trick was one of the biggest moments of my career. I scored three goals in one period against one of the greatest teams in the world. Maybe people forgot about it because they came back and tied the game and we didn’t win. No one ever brings that game up, but it is one of the biggest highlights of my career.” Hull and Howe were treated like celebrities and the Soviet hockey fans were warm and welcoming, though there were the usual complaints about accommodations and scheduling. “I wasn’t sure what to expect when we got to Moscow,” Howe recalled. “The fans were great. Even though we were rivals, they were very welcoming and they respected us.” The Soviets won Game 5 3-2, and then the frustrations of the Canadians began to show when they lost Game 6 5-2. “Mark put a big hit on Petrov,” Howe recalled, talking of his son. “Things got pretty heated after that. At the end of that game, Ricky Ley got in a fight with Valeri Kharlamov. He was their biggest star and he was a very good player. Rickey punched him out and Kharlamov’s face was bloodied up.” Kharlamov played at 5’8”, 165 pounds and was the most talented Soviet player. In the 1972 series, Bobby Clark broke Kharlamov’s ankle with a slash. The teams tied 4-4 in Game 7 and the Soviets won Game 8 3-2. Smith recalled that playing with Howe and Hull was a highlight of his career. “I played against those guys for years, but you don’t really get an appreciation for someone like that until you get a chance to be teammates and to paly with them,” he said. While in Ottawa in the 1990s, Tretiak talked openly about the two Summit Series, the Canada Cup, and the Super Series that saw Red Army come to North America to play NHL teams. “We didn’t know what to expect with the WHA team,” Tretiak said. “We knew about Bobby Hull and Gordie Howe, but we had never seen them or played against them. When we saw their roster, we thought they were very old and that they would not be able to keep up with us. “But even though they were older, they were better than we expected. Gordie Howe was still a great player, and bobby Hull was a great goal scorer. I thought that the 1974 team was better and harder to play against than the 1972 team.” The series gave the WHA exposure. While their TV contracts with CBS and CTV did not put a lot of games on the air, some was better than none. “Before the series, we heard everyone talk about Gordie playing with his sons, Paul Henderson playing the Russians again, Cheevers, Mahovlich and myself,” Hull said. “People who followed the series got to see how good Andre Lacroix was, and how good Mark Howe was.” After the series, O-Pee-Chee decided to produce their first WHA exclusive hockey card sets. The first was a 66-card set, while after that, the WHA sets featured 132 cards. But while there were Team Canada inserts in the 1972-73 O-Pee-Chee set, and while there were sets dedicated to the 1972 series and the 1976 Canada Cup, there is very little in the way of cardboard for the 1974 series. The odd retrospective autographed card of Hull, Howe and Cheevers have been produced, but for the most part, there is almost nothing to collect from that series. “I have signed a lot of autographs, photos, pucks and cards – everything,” Hull said. “When I do shows, the promoters always have stacks of 8x10s for fans to get signed. I never see photos from the 1974 series. It’s like they don’t exist.” Hull never called himself a collector, but he did get one special item after the series. “The Russians were great players, and it was a privilege to play against them,” he said. “Alexander Yakushev was their best scorer. After the series, he asked for my autograph, and I asked for his. I always wished some of those guys could have come to North America to play.” Jeff Morris is a hobby veteran who has been a collector for more than 50 years.

Jim Beauchamp, Mays’ teammate with the New York Mets, lent Mays one of his Adirondack bats when he stepped to the plate on August 17, 1973.

Mays proceeded to use the borrowed bat to hit what turned out to be his last big league dinger off Cincinnati’s Don Gullett.  The sale also includes some other landmark game-used lumber. A 1951 Ted Williams H&B bat graded PSA/DNA GU 10, a 1965-68 Roberto Clemente H&B bat graded PSA/DNA GU 9.5, and a 1967-68 Mays H&B bat graded PSA/DNA GU 10 will be among the featured lots as well as a1940’s Ty Cobb Signed H&B Pro Model bat Inscribed to the biological Mother of Babe Ruth’s daughter.    White trunks worn by Jordan during all three Chicago Bulls home games in the 1998 Finals are expected to draw interest from hard core basketball collectors.

The event, which also features No. 7 Duke and No. 23 Kentucky, is in Atlanta for the first time since 2012, when it was held at the Georgia Dome. The 2024 edition features the nation's top team, but its nothing new for the Jayhawks and Spartans to seek out early measuring sticks. Kansas (2-0) breezed past Howard 87-57 on Nov. 4 in its season opener before fending off No. 9 North Carolina 92-89 on Friday. The Jayhawks saw their 20-point, first-half lead disappear at home against the Tar Heels but scored the game's final five points for their first marquee win of the season. South Dakota State transfer guard Zeke Mayo led Kansas with 21 points off the bench, while fifth-year senior Hunter Dickinson recorded 20 points and 10 rebounds. Mayo, a Lawrence, Kan., native and last season's Summit League Player of the Year, leads his new team with an average of 20 points per game. ""(Zeke) met the opportunity with flying colors,"" Kansas coach Bill Self said of his performance on Friday. ""He was fantastic. He made a couple of plays off the bounce that were just fantastic. He was great, and we needed everything he gave us."" Alongside Mayo, Dickinson -- the Big 12 Preseason Player of the Year -- and KJ Adams Jr. return to the Jayhawks, averaging 18 and 10.5 points per game, respectively. Kansas is 8-5 all-time in the Champions Classic, including 2-2 against the Spartans.  The teams most recently met in the event in 2021, with Kansas winning 87-74. Even though his team is favored in Tuesday's game, Self knows not to underestimate a Tom Izzo-coached team. ""Playing Tom's teams is different because he runs more sets than anybody in the country,"" Self said. ""Getting your guys prepared for what they do, it'll be a multi-day scout."" The Spartans (2-0) have blown out two outmatched opponents this season, beating Monmouth 81-57 and Niagara 96-60. Michigan State's top two scorers are both returnees in Jaden Akins -- who is averaging 16.5 points a game -- and Jaxon Kohler (12.5).  Kohler had 20 points and 13 rebounds against Niagara in a lopsided victory, but Izzo knows Tuesday will be a different story. ""We were able to get the ball inside and outside; we had 52 points in the paint,"" Izzo said. ""I don't think that's going to happen on Tuesday night, but it's all about setting the tempo. What we've been doing well is what we've got to continue to do. I think we have some versatility inside and out, and I like the way we've moved the ball."" Michigan State is 5-8 in the Champions Classic, which began in 2011. After upsetting No. 4 Kentucky in the 2022 event in double overtime, 86-77 in Indianapolis, the Spartans fell to No. 9 Duke 74-65 last year in Chicago. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Although the Dolphins are 2-6 with three consecutive losses, Miami is far more competitive than the record indicates since starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa returned from a four-game hiatus on injured reserve with a concussion. Miami narrowly lost twice since Tagovailoa stepped back into the start job. The Dolphins dropped a one-point decision to Arizona and were also beaten by Buffalo by a field goal margin. As for the Rams (4-4), they'll look to keep their playoff hopes alive by extending their winning streak to four games and keeping their noses up with the rest of the pack in the NFC West. Given both teams' firepower on offense when healthy, this matchup looks tailor-made to produce a high-scoring affair.  --Dolphins' offense energized with Tagovailoa's return  The Dolphins scored 27 points in back-to-back games with Tagovailoa returning to rescue a group putting up less than two touchdowns per game without him. His presence alone tends to have a calming effect on the offense based on his accuracy and ability to put the ball exactly where he wants it to go. Tagovailoa completed 69.3 percent of his passes last season and is up to 72.7 percent this season. The Dolphins are more likely to remain on schedule with Tagovailoa, who has the fifth-highest success rate among quarterbacks with a minimum of 140 plays. When you're picking up the necessary yardage on early downs, you'll have more flexibility with your playcalling. In their last two games, the Dolphins converted 65.2 percent of their third-down opportunities and 6-for-8 in touchdown conversions inside the red zone. While the offense can sometimes resemble a slow grind, the Dolphins' efficiency under Tagovailoa makes them a real threat to opposing defenses. We're eyeing the over on Tagovailoa completions -- set at 21.5 at DraftKings, ESPN Bet and FanDuel -- given his high-percentage horizontal route connections with wide receivers Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle and the additional threat of running back De'Von Achane. Tagovailoa was 25 of 28 (89.3 percent) at Buffalo last week and 28 of 38 in his first game back from IR.  --Pass defense a mutual concern Los Angeles had its share of injury woes, with wide receivers Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua combining to miss seven games. Both players are now back with the team to significantly boost the Rams offense. The passing game is vital for the Rams because they struggle to run the ball, ranking 31st in yards per carry (3.8). As a result, it's no surprise that Los Angeles has the ninth-highest pass play rate at 58.68 percent. Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford should be eager for his chance to face this Dolphins defense. According to the FTN Fantasy Defense-adjusted Value Over Average (DVOA) metric, Miami ranks 27th against the pass. However, the Rams' pass defense is only one spot better.  Pro Football Focus offers a similar view. It has the Dolphins 26th in pass coverage while grading the Rams as the third worst in this category. Hence, we play the points. This total opened at 47.5 and was bet up as high as 49.5 before we began to see a little bit of buyback. It's now settling at 49 at most sportsbooks. As of Monday morning, 48.5 was still available at FanDuel. In a perfect scenario -- or close to perfect health for both teams -- this number would probably be closer to 52.  Do not pass: take the value and run with it.  Best bet: over 48.5 points (-115 at FanDuel) --Michael Nwaneri, Field Level Media Copyright 2024",
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Veteran’s Day Salute to Pro Athletes Who Served Their Country,https://deadspin.com/veterans-day-salute-to-pro-athletes-who-served-their-country/,2024-11-11T14:09:43.057Z,"On Veteran's Day, we salute the professional athletes who served the United States of America.","On D-Day, 19-year-old Yogi Berra and five Navy mates parked the USS Bayfield two long home runs from Omaha Beach and launched rockets and fired machine guns at the Germans—trying to smooth the way for the Allied invasion.  They stayed there 12 more days with orders to shoot down enemy aircraft.  Ted Williams, whose Boston Red Sox battled Berra’s New York Yankees hundreds of times during the 1940s and 1950s, served as a naval aviator for three years in World War II and gave 15 more months as a fighter pilot—occasionally serving as John Glenn’s wingman—in the Korean War. Before Williams left for his Korean War assignment, he had dinner with legendary sportswriter Grantland Rice. According to the superb book “The Wingmen: The Unlikely, Unusual, Unbreakable Friendship Between John Glenn and Ted Williams” by Adam Lazarus, Williams understood the stakes. “Then he said—and this is what I can’t get out of my mind,” Rice told fellow New York sportswriter Frank Graham, “(he said) ‘I expect to be killed, of course.’” Berra and Williams are two of the many examples of remarkable athletes who didn’t limit their greatness to the playing field—and risked their lives to do it. Veterans Day represents a wonderful opportunity to relive their sacrifices for the United States of America. Ty Cobb, Warren Spahn, Bobby Jones, David Robinson, Hank Greenberg, Chuck Bednarik and Hoyt Wilhelm are among other athletes who saw active duty or worked as intelligence officers. Bob Feller, who was perhaps the greatest pitcher of his day, enlisted in the Naval Reserve two days after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. Serving as a gun captain on the USS Alabama, Feller earned eight battle stars and six campaign ribbons in North Atlantic and Pacific theaters. After missing nearly four full seasons of his prime, Feller was discharged on Aug. 22, 1945, and earned a complete-game win over the World Series-bound Detroit Tigers two days later. By no means are former Major League Baseball legends the only ones to come to their country’s aid. After four years as a safety for the Arizona Cardinals, Pat Tillman and his brother, Kevin (an Anaheim Angels pitcher), enlisted in the Army in May 2002 as their response to 9/11. They trained to join the Army Rangers, and their regiment was deployed to Iraq and then Afghanistan as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Tillman was killed April 22, 2004, in Afghanistan by friendly fire during a firefight. Forty years before, Roger Staubach enjoyed a wondrous athletic career at Navy. In addition to earning the 1963 Heisman Trophy and being featured on the cover of Time magazine (he was pushed off the cover of Life due to John F. Kennedy’s assassination), Staubach excelled for three years on the baseball team (batting .420 as a sophomore) and received two letters on the basketball team. Upon graduation in 1965, Staubach immediately began to serve his five-year commitment to the Navy, which included one year in Vietnam. He entered the NFL in 1969 as a 27-year-old rookie with the Dallas Cowboys, who had the foresight to spend their 10th-round pick in the 1964 NFL Draft on Staubach. Within three years, Staubach led the Cowboys to the Super Bowl championship. He was awarded the Super Bowl MVP award, which came with a Dodge Charger. Staubach traded it in for a station wagon—the better to transport his three young kids.  Staubach’s Cowboys and Rocky Bleier’s Pittsburgh Steelers met more than once in the Super Bowl—and Bleier’s military journey was more harrowing than Staubach’s. After playing his rookie year in Pittsburgh, Bleier was drafted into the Army. He went to Vietnam and suffered multiple injuries in August 1969. He was shot in the thigh during an ambush. Not long after during that firefight, he saw a grenade bounce off his commanding officer’s back. “It rolls toward me and I wasn’t but three feet from him as I was sitting there,” Bleier told the American Veterans Center. “I got up to jump and it blew up and I was standing on top of it… I had nerve damage coming up out of my (right) foot, broken bones under my foot. Fortunately I didn’t lose any part of my foot.” During his lengthy recovery that included several surgeries, Bleier was told he would not play football again. Instead, he played 10 more seasons with the Steelers and won four Super Bowls to go with his Purple Heart and Silver Star. “Because I became a story and because we were successful, it put Vietnam on the top of the list,” Bleier said. “So all those Vietnam veterans out there who were repressed, who didn’t get the credit or the pat on the back, all of a sudden, here was one of ours that made it. And got through and got recognition for his service, which the rest of us can ride on his coattails or whatever it might be. But it was well-deserved (recognition) that we all should have gotten at that time.”  Copyright 2024",
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Philadelphia 76ers Star Joel Embiid Is Incapable of Taking the High Road,https://deadspin.com/philadelphia-76ers-star-joel-embiid-is-incapable-of-taking-the-high-road/,2024-11-11T14:02:05.448Z,"After serving a suspension for shoving a reporter in the locker room, Joel Embiid is incapable of taking the high road as the Sixers look to make up g","Joel Embiid has played in just 433 regular-season games since being the No. 3 overall pick of the 2014 NBA Draft by the Philadelphia 76ers. He has never once played 70 games in a season. And when Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Marcus Hayes criticized Embiid's work ethic, lack of conditioning and pattern of unavailability, it didn't go over well with the 2022-23 NBA MVP. Embiid hasn't played yet this season due to a left knee injury plus the three-game suspension he earned for shoving Hayes after a game on Nov. 2. Embiid was irritated with the reporter for a few reasons, one being that he mentioned the name of the center's dead brother and young son, both named Arthur, in the highly critical column. Embiid certainly has the right to be upset and to deliver sharp words at the reporter—dang, what was the over-under on profane words during the confrontation? No matter what the topic, the second an athlete gets physical with a reporter, they have lost the battle and the war. While announcing the suspension, high-ranking NBA executive Joe Dumars included this nugget in his statement: ""Interactions must remain professional on both sides and can never turn physical."" Keep your hands off, Joel. You're 30 years old. You've been frustrated with the things this whole season. Instead of pushing somebody, have the team set you up with counseling to help figure out why you have so much anger. Embiid, of course, is a spectacular player who has career averages of 27.9 points and 11.2 rebounds. He led the NBA in scoring back-to-back seasons and had a solid chance to do so again last season before injuring the left knee in late January. He underwent surgery on Feb. 6 and later returned to action, but he hobbled through the playoffs. The knee certainly didn't recover because here he is still battling more issues with it. The 76ers need the seven-time All-Star on the floor to make a run at a title. But even with Embiid, Philadelphia hasn't reached the Eastern Conference finals during his career, let alone the NBA Finals. The more the 76ers come up short, the more people question whether Embiid will ever get Philadelphia to the finals. The 76ers last title came in 1983, when NBA MVP Moses Malone and basketball icon Julius Erving led the way. The 76ers added Paul George in the offseason to help with the title quest, and Tyrese Maxey, who just injured a hamstring, is also part of a star-studded trio. But no matter who you break it down, the 76ers need Embiid on the floor. They are a dreadful 2-7, and five of the losses have been by double digits. Embiid is eligible to return from his suspension on Tuesday against the New York Knicks. Those are the same Knicks that eliminated Philadelphia in the first round of last season's playoffs. There's no guarantee Embiid's knee will be ready for the contest against the Knicks. And that's kind of the real problem—when will that knee allow him to take the court and be a dominant force? Because once he's playing games and putting up 30-plus points every night, this whole situation will disappear. The focus will return to his skills, and the 76ers should start winning more games. But exploding on a reporter—even if the Arthur stuff was unnecessary—is not a good look for the so-called face of the franchise. Embiid has seemed to be one of those players that could spend his entire career with one organization. If that doesn't happen, consider the recent weeks as the beginning of the road out of town. Embiid made a big mistake. He'll choose his path moving forward. But big Joel, maybe keep your hands off the working stiffs in the future. Copyright 2024",

Houston was up 23-7 at intermission. Detroit quarterback Jared Goff had already been picked off three times, Texans counterpart C.J. Stroud had completed 70 percent of his passes, and the Lions had never faced such a deficit this season. What could go wrong? A lot, apparently. Detroit stormed all the way back, keeping Houston off the scoreboard in the second half and winning 26-23 on Jake Bates’ 52-yard field goal as time expired. So, make that three losses in four games for the once-mighty Texans, who were 5-1 through their first six games of the season. Injuries have been the main reason for Houston’s steady decline, with a bum hamstring forcing Nico Collins to miss the past five games and fellow wide receiver Stefon Diggs done for the year because of a torn ACL. If the Texans were in any other division than the AFC South, which currently features three teams that a handful of high school JV squads could probably give a run for their money, they would really be in a tight spot. But luckily for Houston, it still has some room for error. However, each setback gives the Indianapolis Colts a reason to keep chasing that division crown. Indianapolis (4-6) is the only team that the 6-4 Texans have to keep their eye on in the AFC South, as the Tennessee Titans (2-7) and Jacksonville Jaguars (2-8) might as well start scheduling offseason vacation plans. There’s a very real possibility that the Colts go 6-1 to close out the campaign. Yes, an optimistic prediction for sure, but colliding with the New York Jets, New England Patriots, New York Giants, Titans and Jaguars could result in a lot of late-season success.  Win those games, then beat either the Broncos or Lions, and congrats, Indianapolis. A 6-1 finish for a 10-7 record. Down Denver and Detroit, and now you’ve shattered all expectations.  Of course, this Colts team has plenty of problems of its own and hasn’t really been able to click all season despite having some serious talent, especially on the offensive side of the ball. Still, Indianapolis can say it has life, which a number of teams would kill for heading into Week 11. After a loss like the one it had on Sunday, Houston could easily go off the rails. It has great opportunities to bounce back ahead of its Week 14 bye -- facing the Dallas Cowboys, Titans and Jaguars -- but dropping any of those games really creates some cause for concern. Following their brief hiatus, the Texans will be greeted by a healthy version of the Miami Dolphins before taking on the Kansas City Chiefs and Baltimore Ravens. Then it’s down to Nashville for the regular-season finale against the Titans. Houston was already on a very slippery slope, and handing off a win to Detroit on Sunday certainly didn’t help it find its footing. The Texans shouldn’t be all that worried just yet, but if they do end up slipping in the standings, what happened in Week 10 won’t soon be forgotten. Copyright 2024",
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",It’s Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson Fight Week and I’m Embarrassingly Excited About It,https://deadspin.com/its-jake-paul-vs-mike-tyson-fight-week-and-im-embarrassingly-excited-about-it/,2024-11-11T13:48:13.575Z,"Jake Paul fights Mike Tyson on Friday November 15th on Netflix, and this fight is highly anticipated because of the unique nature of the matchup.","Top influencer boxer Jake Paul fights the legendary Mike Tyson on Friday, and I am embarrassed to admit just how excited I am for this.  The fight was originally scheduled for July 20, but had to be postponed after a medical scare for Tyson on an airplane, which was later diagnosed as an ulcer flare-up. Between these two dates, Paul hosted a surprisingly exciting fight against former UFC fighter Mike Perry, who had gained a little bit of fame for his success in the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship. Paul was named victorious by way of a technical knockout in the sixth round, as a swollen and beaten Perry just couldn’t proceed. Paul vs. Tyson comes with a fair amount of warranted criticism. Tyson is 58 years old. His last competitive fight was in 2005. In a 2020 exhibition against Roy Jones Jr. that ended in a draw, Tyson looked slow and like an older man that did not take the fight seriously. His fight against Paul will take place without headgear.  This fight with Paul will be different from your normal celebrity face-off, as it’s an actual sanctioned fight that will count on professional records.  This doesn’t feel like Logan Paul vs. Floyd Mayweather, which was a clear money grab. Don’t get me wrong, this is a massive money grab as well. It’ll be a huge spectacle at AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys. While 80,000 can fit inside of that building, millions will watch this freak show live on Netflix. It’s another live event for Netflix, who impressed during their Labor Day broadcast of Joey Chestnut vs. Takeru Kobayashi. It’ll be interesting to see what Netflix can do with a combat sports broadcast. Another reason to be excited. But everyone will be interested in seeing what happens in the ring. Now 27 years old, Paul has taken the world of combat sports by storm. He’s knocked out former UFC stars like Tyron Woodley and Ben Askren. He’s battled older legends like Anderson Silva before. Prior to announcing his fight with Iron Mike, he was beating up some lesser-known boxers with relative ease. Tyson is a +200 underdog in this fight on most major sportsbooks, and that’s likely because of the 30-year age difference. But Tyson is different. He’s a heavyweight. This will be Paul’s first heavyweight bout, a division in which Tyson won six championship titles during his professional career. While training videos can easily be altered and edited, Tyson looks to be in great shape. At a heavier weight, Paul will presumably get tired quicker, and he’s never exactly been known for great endurance. Friday’s arrival will be met with excitement. A large piece of me feels like this could unfold like any other Paul fight, and that could be very apparent early in the match. The way Paul fights typically goes, he will strategically select an older, slower opponent that he could wear down with his heavy right hand. The opponents are typically in it for the pay day, and sometimes that’s very obvious with their clear lack of preparation. But there’s a small piece of me that thinks this one could be different. Surely, Tyson is in this one for the pay day, too. The legend has nothing left to prove inside of that ring. But if he could be the one to finally knock out Paul and put an end to all of this madness? That would be a story that only Netflix could script.  Copyright 2024",

The Thunder said Holmgren is expected to return this season after he endured a right iliac wing fracture. The 7-foot-1 star was injured during a fall after contesting a layup by Andrew Wiggins in the first quarter.  Holmgren, 22, is averaging 16.4 points, 8.7 rebounds and 2.6 blocks in 10 games this season.  The injury is the second significant one in the young career of Holmgren, who was selected by Oklahoma City with the second overall pick of the 2022 NBA Draft. He missed the 2022-23 season due to a Lisfranc injury in his right foot. Holmgren debuted last season and was runner-up for NBA Rookie of the Year after averaging 16.5 points, 7.9 rebounds and 2.3 blocked shots in 82 starts. He became the first player in NBA history to tally at least 150 assists, 150 blocks and 100 made 3-pointers in a season.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The Oklahoma City Thunder will have to adjust to being without one of theirs for the time being. On Monday night, the teams will square off in Oklahoma City with the Clippers still without Kawhi Leonard and the Thunder without Chet Holmgren. Leonard has yet to play this season due to inflammation in his right knee. He won't travel with the Clippers during a three-game trip that begins with Monday's contest. The game will be the second of four meetings between the teams this season. Oklahoma City won the first meeting, 105-92, in Los Angeles on Nov. 2. Holmgren played a significant role in that game with 10 points and 14 rebounds. Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said after that game that Holmgren's abilities made the Thunder particularly difficult to defend. But now, Oklahoma City will be without Holmgren for at least eight to 10 weeks after he sustained a pelvic fracture during the first quarter of Sunday's contest against the Golden State Warriors. Holmgren fell hard on his right hip after trying to defend a layup near the rim. The team announced the injury as a right iliac wing fracture and said he is expected to return this season.  Holmgren is averaging 16.4 points, 8.7 rebounds and 2.6 blocks a game this season. Oklahoma City trailed Sunday's game by 30 late in the third quarter before pulling as close as six late before the Warriors won 127-116. ""This is a resilient, tough, competitive, adaptive team,"" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said, ""and that's what we're going to be, regardless of the circumstances."" The Thunder might have to be even more adaptive. Before Holmgren's injury, Oklahoma City already was thin in the frontcourt with Isaiah Hartenstein, Jaylin Williams and Kenrich Williams all injured. Those three have not appeared in a game this season. ""It's kind of a next-man-up thing,"" Oklahoma City's Jalen Williams said. ""Can't dwell too long."" The Thunder's defense, which ranks best in the league with 100.3 points allowed per 100 possessions, figures to be most affected without Holmgren. ""All of us have to figure out how to get stops and rebound,"" Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said. The Clippers' defense also is in the top five in the league, allowing 107.7 points per 100 possessions. After dropping their first matchup with the Thunder, the Clippers fell to 2-4 for the season. But Los Angeles has won four consecutive games since then, including Saturday's 105-103 home victory over Toronto. During the four-game winning streak, Clippers center Ivica Zubac is averaging 14.8 points and 12.3 rebounds. ""Zu's been great,"" Lue said. ""The big man that we've been playing a lot of minutes, but he's one of the most durable big men in the league, probably the most durable big man in the league."" Zubac has played in at least 68 games in each of the last four seasons. The Clippers have lost six consecutive games in Oklahoma City. They haven't won there since March 3, 2020. The Thunder are 2-0 on the second game of a back-to-back this season.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The Spurs will play the third contest of a five-game homestand that's seen them split the first two games, defeating the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday and then dropping a 111-110 decision to the Utah Jazz on Saturday.  San Antonio on Saturday received 24 points and 16 rebounds from Victor Wembanyama, who was also called for a crucial offensive foul on a pick late in the game.  Stephon Castle had career-high 23 points in his third start, Devin Vassell scored 21, Keldon Johnson hit for 14 and Harrison Barnes tallied 10 points in the loss.  ""My guys have been in the gym with me,"" Castle said of his best-ever output. ""We're all confident in each other to shoot the ball no matter who it is. If we get open when we're told, we've got to shoot it. (It's about) just stepping up and shooting with confidence.""  Vassell's production came in his first action of the season after he missed more than seven months with a broken foot.  ""I haven't played in a long time,"" Vassell said afterward. ""You know, during the off season, I was kind of frustrated because at the end of the day, I just want to be out there on my teammates and play with them. I was able to get through it. They helped me get back in shape and everything.""  The Spurs have spilt their past four games and will get their first look this season at the Kings, who arrived in the Alamo City early Monday morning after a 127-118 overtime win in Phoenix on Sunday.  DeMar DeRozan led the Kings with 34 points while three other starters -- De'Aaron Fox (21 points, 11 rebounds, eight assists), Domantas Sabonis (20 points, 12 rebounds) and Keegan Murray (14 points, 14 rebounds) -- racked up double doubles in the victory. Kevin Huerter added 17 points for Sacramento.  The Kings have won three of their past four games.  While DeRozan is the most oft-mentioned new player for the Kings, Huerter -- who came to the team from Atlanta in July 2022 -- also has been a key cog. The 6-foot-7 guard underwent a 6 1/2-month recovery after season-ending surgery last April to repair a torn labrum in his left shoulder.  ""I'm still getting myself in the swing of things, still trying to find my rhythm,"" said Huerter, who is averaging 11.3 points a game this season. ""A couple of new guys on our team and a new offense, so I'm trying to fully immerse myself with the team and kind of get my feet under me a little bit. It's been a rigorous summer, and obviously glad to be back in the swing."" Sacramento's super sixth man, Malik Monk, left Sunday's game early in the second quarter when he twisted his ankle after stepping on the foot step of Suns center Mason Plumlee. Monk did not return to the game, and his status for Monday's contest will be in question until game time. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The Rockets eked out a 101-99 victory over the Pistons for their third win in the last four games. Houston, which will host the Washington Wizards on Monday night, beat Detroit while shooting just 40.9 percent from the field and missing 27 of 34 attempts from 3-point range. What the Rockets did well on Sunday was lean into their early-season profile by securing 17 offensive rebounds while recording a modest 11 turnovers. According to NBA.com, the Rockets exited the win over Detroit second in the league in offensive rebounding rate (35.9 percent) and fifth in turnover rate (12.5 percent). Their effectiveness in those two categories has offset woeful shooting, with only Portland and Utah posting effective field-goal percentages worse than the Rockets' 49.6 percent. Rebounding saved the Rockets against the Pistons. Alperen Sengun grabbed 10 rebounds while Tari Eason secured nine in 27 minutes off the bench. Starters Fred VanVleet and forward Jabari Smith Jr. shot a combined 5 for 21, including 1 for 11 on 3-pointers, but totaled 14 rebounds. The Rockets employ the offensive talent to turn things around on that end of the court, but their offensive rebounding and ball security should continue to serve as assets. ""That was a point of emphasis all year,"" Rockets coach Ime Udoka said. ""We got nine more shots because of that and took care of the ball. As I always say, you can rely on your defense when the shots aren't falling, so on the nights when they both click, you have a comfortable win. The nights where they're not, you can still dig it out and figure out a way to get it done."" The Wizards surrendered a pair of 30-point quarters in the second half of their 121-94 road loss to the Orlando Magic on Sunday, their fourth consecutive defeat, with three of those losses coming by at least 20 points. Washington again was without its second-leading scorer and rebounder, Kyle Kuzma (17 points, 7.7 rebounds), and his absence continues to be felt. Washington posted a minus-seven rebounding margin and allowed 15 offensive boards that Orlando converted into 22 points. The Wizards' ineffective performance on the glass was a shared responsibility, but 7-foot rookie Alex Sarr corraling only three rebounds in 24 minutes proved noteworthy. Sarr blocked two shots on Sunday after entering play averaging 2.6 per game, which ranked fourth in the NBA. If Sarr is to excel as a rim-protector, he'll need his teammates to cover for him on the glass when he rotates out of position and fills the role as a help defender. ""I think Alex is growing and learning every game,"" Wizards coach Brian Keefe said. ""We're seeing things that he's never seen before. ""I thought Alex came out and established a good presence at the rim early. We've got to keep helping him when he goes to shot-block and help him on the boards.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Then, on Saturday, Philadelphia battled the defending champion Florida Panthers for 65 minutes before falling 4-3 in a shootout. ""The past few games, we're beginning to play better, more to what we're supposed to play like,"" Flyers coach John Tortorella said. Samuel Ersson missed the first two games of the road trip with a lower-body injury before returning to make 28 saves against the Panthers. ""This road trip, I think we played pretty well,"" Ersson said. ""We battled ... against very good teams. We're happy with the way we played. Obviously we want more points, but if we play like this, they're going to come.""  Joel Farabee, Anthony Richard and Garnet Hathaway each scored a goal and Scott Laughton had two assists against Florida. Owen Tippett had the team's lone tally in five shootout attempts.  ""I thought we dictated the speed of the game tonight,"" Hathaway said. ""And that's something that when we're playing to our identity, that's what we do."" The Sharks are playing better in recent weeks, as well, having gone 5-2-0 in their last seven games following an 0-7-2 start to the season. Most recently, they slipped past the New Jersey Devils on Sunday night, 1-0, in the opener of a four-game trip. Mackenzie Blackwood made 44 saves for his 11th career shutout, blanking his former team in his first game as a visiting goaltender at Prudential Center. ""It's just one of those nights where it feels easy,"" Blackwood said. ""I don't know why sometimes that happens and sometimes it doesn't, but sometimes pucks just seem like they're coming in slow. I don't know why, but definitely you could say today was one of those days I was seeing the puck well."" While most teams typically don't start the same goalie on both ends of a back-to-back set, perhaps San Jose coach Ryan Warsofsky has a tougher decision to make after Blackwood's stellar effort on Sunday. ""(Blackwood) was outstanding, probably the best I've seen him play,"" Warsofsky said. ""You could just tell he was dialed in, focused and tracking pucks really well."" Of course, some credit must go to the Sharks' defense for shutting out a talented Devils team that entered with five wins in its previous six games. ""I thought we did a great job for the most part, staying tight,"" said Nico Sturm, who scored the lone goal for San Jose. ""Obviously, (Blackwood) had a huge game."" It remains to be seen if the Sharks' defense will have to contend with dynamic Flyers rookie Matvei Michkov, who has been a healthy scratch in the last two games. ""It's just part of the process,"" Tortorella said. ""With young guys, they can watch games too as far as developing. It's (about) trying to help him.""

The Sooners (1-0) enjoyed solid showings from their veterans and newcomers in their 93-60 home win over Lindenwood last Monday.  Jalon Moore led all scorers with 22 points, while fellow returning starter Sam Godwin had 11 points and a game-high 15 rebounds. Perhaps more importantly, Oklahoma coach Porter Moser said the duo's poise helped the rest of the team shed any first-game jitters. ""That's the joy of having retention,"" Moser said.

""Making a free throw doesn't have anything to do with who you're playing, whether it's Texas Tech or Dallas Christian. We lost the game at the line and in transition defense. I told the guys our transition defense was terrible. It will get fixed by Monday."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

His heroics helped the Lions (8-1) stretch their winning streak to seven games. Jared Goff threw a career-worst five interceptions while completing 15 of 30 passes for 240 yards and two touchdowns for Detroit. David Montgomery rushed for a touchdown and Amon-Ra St. Brown and Sam LaPorta had scoring receptions for the Lions. C.J.

The Bulldogs (1-1) fell 68-66 to the Governors on Friday, committing 16 turnovers and surrendering 44 points in the paint. Patrick McCaffery finished with a team-high 23 points on 8-for-13 shooting from the field for Butler, which struggled to create separation in the first half before going down by as many as 14 in the second.  Bulldogs coach Thad Matta is hoping that his team will be more resilient on Monday.  ""They just punched us early,"" Matta said of the Governors. ""We've got to get better at taking a punch and fighting back. We didn't handle (the pressure) well. They made us not ready to play."" McCaffery is one of four players who has a scoring average in double figures for Butler. He is putting up 17.0 points per game, ranking second behind Jahmyl Telfort, who averages 18.5 points.  Pierre Brooks II (13.0 points per game) and Finley Bizjack (10.0) have also been key contributors for the Bulldogs.  The Broncos (1-1) will have to find a way to contain that balanced attack after crushing Division II foe Davenport 86-46 on Thursday. Brandon Muntu supplied 17 points in the victory, while Max Burton and JaVaughn Hannah netted 13 apiece.  Western Michigan hasn't had a winning season since the 2017-18 campaign, but that isn't stopping Hannah from having high expectations for the Broncos.  ""We're not just satisfied with making the (Mid-American Conference) tournament. We want to kick in that door, take the next step and win a championship,"" Hannah said. ""That foundation is set. We just want to continue it this season.""  Hannah and Markhi Strickland are each averaging 11.5 points per game to lead Western Michigan in scoring.

UNCG (1-0) pulled away late from Florida Gulf Coast for a 73-64 win in its season opener last Monday. Though the Spartans led by as many as 17 points in the first half, FGCU tied the contest at 59-59 with 3:54 left in the second. That was promptly answered by an 11-0 run from UNC Greensboro, sealing the Spartans' victory. Offensively, the Mustangs are led by Wake Forest transfer Boopie Miller, who has averaged 20.5 points through his first two games with SMU. Donovan Atwell and Kenyon Giles each tallied 17 points in UNCG's season opener. SMU surrendered an average of 67.5 points in its first two victories, but the Mustangs also recorded at least 10 steals and forced their opponent into a minimum of 15 turnovers in both contests. Enfield reiterated the importance of quality defense to his team's identity after beating Florida A&M. ""I think through our preseason, we understand that if we don't play hard defensively, we're not very good,"" Enfield said. ""We have to be active. We have to be disruptive."" SMU enters the matchup Monday shooting 42 percent from beyond the arc and had 20 assists against Tarleton State and 23 against Florida A&M. ""They're buying into the team concept,"" Enfield said. For UNCG, team defense was the key down the stretch of its first win, holding FGCU to a scoring drought that spanned 3:25. ""We challenged these guys to get in better shape this season,"" Spartans coach Mike Jones said. ""We challenged them to be able to separate (themselves) in the last four minutes of the game because you're tougher mentally and better conditioned.

Tamar Bates hit 3 of 7 shots from behind the arc while leading Missouri with 17 points. But the other Tigers went 0-for-15 from distance while coach Dennis Gates implored them to pound the ball inside. ""The 3-pointer was so tempting for most of them, they couldn't resist it,"" Gates said. ""They could not resist it. And Bates made his baseline out, and it's almost like that that stirred it up again, like ‘Oh, we're open! We're open! Let's shoot it!' And we have to be able to do certain things other than just catch and shoot."" Forward Mark Mitchell had a strong game inside (16 points, eight rebounds), but Gates wanted more players attacking the basket. He used nine players for 12 minutes or more while trying to find effective combinations. Eastern Washington opened its season by losing at Colorado 76-56 and defeating Seattle 93-86 at home. The Eagles raced to a 16-4 lead over Seattle but failed to keep the upper hand, falling behind by the 7:53 mark of the first half. ""We'll get better defense because this is a very coachable group,"" first-year Eagles coach Dan Monson said. ""They have started both games dictating the defense, we just have to sustain it."" On the other hand, the Eagles shot 57.6 percent from the floor against Seattle and made 9 of 22 shots from 3-point range.

Florida A&M has had a major issue with turnovers during its first two games. The Rattlers allowed SMU to convert 15 giveaways into 27 points during a 102-73 loss on Thursday.   One of the bright spots for the Rattlers so far has been Sterling Young, who led the team in scoring against SMU with 15 points. He went 3-for-8 from 3-point range in that setback.  Young is averaging a team-high 15.5 points over the first two games of the season.  ""Sterling is a really good offensive player who was an all-conference player at the best juco conference in the county,"" Crarey said in May, when it was officially announced that Young had transferred from Charlotte. ""He spent this last year playing in the (American Athletic Conference). His experience on that level will be a huge asset to our program."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The Hokies improved to 2-0 with a 93-74 win against visiting USC Upstate on Friday night, while the Eagles (2-0) defeated visiting Little Rock 82-67 Saturday. Mylyjael Poteat and Brandon Rechsteiner both scored a career-high 19 points in Virginia Tech's win. Freshman Tyler Johnson scored 16 points and Jaydon Young had 14. Despite the win, the young Hokies had a cold-shooting start on Friday. They missed nine of their first 10 shots and trailed 16-2 early. USC Upstate hit six of 10 shots to begin the game and Virginia Tech committed five turnovers early. Virginia Tech trailed by five at intermission but pulled away in the second half. A 7-0 run gave them a double-digit lead and they never looked back. ""I feel like that's a good definition of what the season will look like,"" Young said. ""I think it'll start off pretty ugly, as it should, new team coming together. I feel like a lot of teams look like that right now, but January, February, later on in the season, it might look a little better."" In contrast to Virginia Tech's youth, Winthrop starts five seniors and returns four starters, the top four scorers from 2023-24. Despite that, Winthrop followed a similar narrative to Virginia Tech last time out. The Eagles led Little Rock by four points at halftime before scoring the first nine points of the second half to build a 41-28 lead with 17:38 to play. They pushed the lead to 23 points and Little Rock got no closer than within 13. K.J. Doucet led Winthrop with 17 points and seven rebounds. Tommy Kamarad and Kasen Harrison added 13 points apiece.

Monday at home, the Panthers get another mid-major test against Gardner-Webb of the Big South. Helping fuel the Panthers' 2-0 start have been Damian Dunn, a graduate transfer from Houston, and Cameron Corhen, who arrived from Florida State. While Dunn had 19 points in an 83-68 victory Friday over Murray State, Corhen delivered 13 points and 10 rebounds. Meanwhile, holdover guards Jaland Lowe and Ishmael Leggett produced 20 and 19 points, respectively. While some backcourt players in the transfer portal might have crossed Pitt off their list because of the presence of two veteran guards, Dunn signed on and the trio has been productive. They are averaging a combined 54.5 points, hitting 54.5 percent of their shots, including 45.4 percent from beyond the arc. ""We all have our turns. We all know we have our days. Everybody's gonna eat,"" Dunn said. While the offense was humming last week, Pitt coach Jeff Capel wants to see more from his defense. ""We didn't play as hard and smart as we normally do,"" Capel said after the Murray State win. Zack Austin came off the bench to spark the defense with five blocks and eight rebounds. ""We're not as good as we think we are,"" Capel added. Gardner-Webb (1-1) arrives after delivering Jeremy Luther his first win as a Division I head coach, 88-82 at North Carolina Central on Friday in a game that the Runnin' Bulldogs never trailed. Anthony Selden, who returned to Gardner-Webb after a season at Rice, propelled the Runnin' Bulldogs with 26 points on 10-of-15 shooting.

Brett Leason, Jackson LaCombe, Leo Carlsson and Isac Lundestrom scored goals for Anaheim, which picked up just its second win in the past eight games. It also marked the first time since a 5-4 overtime win over Utah on Oct. 16 that the Ducks scored four goals in a game.   Gibson, making his 467th career start in his 12th season, picked up his 194th career victory for the Ducks.

Kirill Marchenko had a goal and an assist and Yegor Chinakhov also scored for Columbus, which lost its fifth straight game. Daniil Tarasov finished with 26 saves.   Anaheim, which entered the game having scored an NHL-low 27 goals, jumped out to a 1-0 lead at the 3:13 mark of the first period on Leason's first goal of the season. Cutter Gauthier set up the score with a backhand pass from below the goal line to Leason in front of the crease.   Columbus, playing the second half of a back-to-back set that began with a 5-2 loss at Los Angeles on Saturday, tied it near the end of the period on a power-play goal by Chinakhov. He blasted a one-timer from the right point that squeaked past Gibson for his fourth goal of the season.   Anaheim took a 2-1 at 4:22 of the second period when LaCombe roofed in a rebound of a Radko Gudas one-timer from the top of the crease for his first goal.   Carlsson made it 3-1 at 10:20 of the third period with a spinning wrist shot from the slot off Brian Dumoulin's pass for his fifth goal.

Tyler Herro scored a game-high 26 points on 9-for-15 shooting from the floor for Miami, which ended a three-game losing streak. Jovic scored 15 points and grabbed seven rebounds off the bench, and Terry Rozier chipped in 11 points.   Anthony Edwards scored 24 points but made only 8 of 22 shots for Minnesota, which saw its three-game winning streak end. Julius Randle finished with 17 points, six rebounds and six assists, and Naz Reid contributed 15 points off the bench.   On the decisive play, Jovic sprinted toward the basket and caught an inbound pass in stride from Duncan Robinson. Jovic finished at the rim and drew a foul against Timberwolves defender Nickeil Alexander-Walker.   The play spoiled what could have been a game-winning basket for Jaden McDaniels, who made a putback shot with nine seconds to go to give Minnesota a 94-92 lead.   The Timberwolves led 92-89 before Haywood Highsmith and Rozier combined for three free throws in the final minute to even the score at 92-92.

Jonathan Kuminga scored 12 of his 20 points for the Warriors in the second quarter and shot 8-of-11 from the field.  De'Anthony Melton hit five of Golden State's season-high-tying 21 3-pointers and finished with 19 points and 10 rebounds. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 24 points but was just 6-of-17 from the field, including 1-for-5 in the fourth quarter.  Oklahoma City played most of the game without star center Chet Holmgren, who injured his right hip on a hard fall after a midair collision with the Warriors' Andrew Wiggins in the first quarter. Holmgren finished scoreless for the first time in his career, going 0-for-3 from the field, and had four rebounds. The Thunder trailed 107-77 late in the third but got within 114-108 in the fourth after Alex Caruso stole an inbounds pass and streaked to the other end for a dunk. Oklahoma City immediately forced another turnover, this one by Curry, but couldn't take advantage again. Golden State scored on its next two possessions, the latter coming on Curry's sixth 3-pointer that made it 119-108 with 3:23 remaining.  Curry scored five more points the rest of the way as the Thunder never got closer than seven. The Warriors outshot the hosts 50.6 percent (45-of-89) to 44.7 percent (42-of-94) and held Oklahoma City to 11-of-33 shooting (33.3 percent) on 3-pointers. The Thunder initially responded well after Holmgren's injury, stretching their lead to seven by the end of the first quarter. Golden State turned things around in the second, outscoring the Thunder 39-25 to carry a 65-58 lead into halftime. The Warriors' surge continued in the third quarter as Curry exploded for 17 points.

Mrazek outdueled Minnesota counterpart Filip Gustavsson (20 saves) to help Chicago end a 12-game winless streak against its Central Division rival. The Blackhawks netted the game-winner after intercepting a pass. Seth Jones sent a pass to Kurashev, who streaked down the left side before beating Gustavsson with a wrist shot. The Blackhawks fought off consistent pressure from the Wild, who outshot Chicago 19-4 in the third period. Matt Boldy evened the score at 15:29 of the third period, burying a chance when a rebound trickled to him just inside the left circle. Boldy missed an opportunity to tie the score moments earlier, sending a shot off the crossbar that glanced off Mrazek's body before Nick Foligno poked it away from the net. Chicago's Ryan Donato hit the post shortly after the goal. The Blackhawks opened the scoring at 16:44 of the first period, when Jason Dickinson tallied an unassisted goal. Swooping in to gather a loose puck along the right-wing boards, he came through the circle and moved into the slot before sending a wrist shot over Gustavsson's blocker. Chicago was awarded two power plays on separate tripping calls in the first 5:50 of the game but failed to convert. Mrazek proved especially resourceful in the closing seconds of the second period. After losing his stick in front of the crease, he accepted Taylor Hall's stick and used it to stop Jake Middleton's wrist shot from the left circle. Wild coach John Hynes shuffled lines in stretches during the game, including grouping Kirill Kaprizov, Joel Eriksson Ek and Boldy. Kaprizov saw his streak of eight consecutive multipoint road games snapped, although he did get the primary assist on Boldy's goal. Kaprizov entered the game with back-to-back three-point efforts to begin Minnesota's three-game road trip. Both teams were 0-for-3 on the power play. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

UCLA (1-1) gave up 21 points off 21 turnovers in a 72-64 loss to New Mexico on Friday in Henderson, Nev. The 21 turnovers were the most by a Mick Cronin-coached team since his first season at UCLA, 2019-20, when the Bruins had 22 turnovers vs. North Carolina.  ""I'm extremely disappointed in some of our guards,"" Cronin said. ""There are three things you've got to do: defend, rebound, and take care of the ball. We didn't take care of the ball."" Maintaining possession has been a hallmark of Cronin's UCLA teams. The Bruins averaged fewer than 11 turnovers per game in each of the previous four seasons. In 2021-22, UCLA averaged just 8.9 turnovers a contest.  Rediscovering that identity promises to be a point of emphasis for a veteran, but still new-look Bruins lineup. Four of the five starters against New Mexico are transfers: Eric Dailey Jr., Skyy Clark, Kobe Johnson and Tyler Bilodeau.  Meanwhile, the lone returning starter -- Dylan Andrews -- scored just four points while committing six turnovers on Friday.  Andrews, Sebastian Mack and Lazar Stefanovic, three of UCLA's top performers a season ago, combined for just eight points vs. New Mexico.  ""Dylan and Sebastian were throwing the ball away for layups,"" Cronin said. ""I told them, ‘Guys, we were better than that last year.'"" Just one Bruin scored in double figures on Friday -- Bilodeau with 23 points -- after four Bruins notched at least 12 points in their 85-50 season-opening win over Rider on Nov. 4. UCLA aims to regain that balance when winless Boston University comes to Pauley Pavilion.  The Terriers (0-2) come into the matchup after losing 74-60 at San Diego on Friday. Boston gave up 40 second-half points to the Toreros after surrendering 42 second-half points in its 80-72 loss to crosstown rival Northeastern on opening night.  Forward Malcolm Chimezie was a bright spot for Boston in its first two games. After scoring 14 points against Northeastern, he had nine points and nine rebounds at San Diego.  Boston guard Ben Palacios, who missed the season opener, scored 15 points in 17 minutes off the bench against San Diego. The Terriers head into UCLA missing forward Otto Landrum, who averaged 8.5 points and 5.3 rebounds a season ago; and guard Ethan Okwuosa, who averaged 7.5 points and 4.2 rebounds last season.  ""This is going to be our team for a while. We're going to be without Ethan and Otto for a good stretch, and we're going to have to figure this out,"" Terriers coach Joe Jones. ""This is not the same team from last year because of the injuries, but we're still a good enough team to win. We're going to have to figure it out.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Diebler is in his first full campaign as head coach for Ohio State after replacing the fired Chris Holtmann on Feb. 14. Diebler went 8-3 as the Buckeyes' interim head coach last season. Sharp 3-point shooting was key for Ohio State (1-0) against the Longhorns. The Buckeyes shot 14-of-28 from distance, 50 percent clip they surpassed only four times last season. ""We really just want to get a good look,"" Diebler said. ""We want to play with an aggressiveness and confidence to take the first good look we can get."" Youngstown State's Ethan Faulkner won his head coaching debut for the Penguins (1-0) with an 80-60 victory at Chicago State on Saturday.  Faulkner was the associate head coach the past two seasons after three as an assistant coach at Youngstown State. It was a delayed start of the season for the Penguins because the originally scheduled opener against Westminster on Nov. 4 was postponed due to a power outage on the Youngstown State campus. The Penguins have won 20 games in consecutive seasons, but Faulkner has only three returning letterwinners and knows his team is a work in progress.  ""We are certainly making progress, but I think we need to continue to improve in all areas,"" Faulkner told the Tribune Chronicle.

After a 20-17 overtime loss in Germany at the hands of Bryce Young’s Carolina Panthers, the Giants are 2-8. Now let’s be clear on something. Nobody really expected the Giants to be much of anything this year. They pretty much waved the white flag on 2024 when they let the best running back in the game, Saquon Barkley, walk away to a division rival on a long-term deal back in March. Their 2-8 record isn’t as embarrassing when you realize that it should not be unexpected. Despite never showing the true, intangible traits of a Super Bowl-caliber quarterback, the Giants decided to extend Jones to a four-year, $160 million contract. Everyone online trolls Jones for his ineptitude, but that’s just who he is as a quarterback. It’s who he has always been. It’s who he will always be. But it’s time to move on. The contract has an out this offseason and the Giants would be flatout stupid to not exercise that clause. They likely will. Remember, they were in on several quarterbacks in the 2024 NFL Draft class, but ultimately selected wide receiver Malik Nabers with the No. 6 overall selection. Moving off of the No. 6 overall pick in 2019, Jones would cost the Giants about $22 million in dead cap space, but that’s not that much money as long as your new quarterback is still on his rookie deal. It’s practically how the Denver Broncos have their head above water after the Russell Wilson fiasco, which is comedically working out for the Pittsburgh Steelers as well. But Jones isn’t a solo actor in the crime of the 2024 Giants. Daboll shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near the next quarterback. Neither should offensive coordinator Mike Kafka.  It’s time for a fresh start with a fresh quarterback.  Jones has a 22-44-1 record as the starter for the Giants. Replacing Eli Manning was never going to be easy, but Jones probably was never going to be the guy to make that happen. Dynasties in football are rare. Not everyone can be the Green Bay Packers, who consistently spit out franchise quarterbacks. The Steelers have struggled to replace Ben Roethlisberger since his retirement. After Tom Brady's departure, the New England Patriots have already drafted two different first round QBs. These guys don't exactly grow on trees. There's no guarantee that the next guy will be a hit for the Giants, and that goes for the coach or quarterback. But it can’t really be much worse than what they have now. Copyright 2024",

It was the Magic's second straight win without injured star Paolo Banchero, who last played Oct. 30 because of a torn oblique. Eleven different players scored for the Magic, six in double figures, with Cole Anthony scoring a season-high 16 off the bench. Washington has lost four in a row, and their scoring output was their lowest of the season. The Wizards' starting lineup included three rookies (Alex Sarr, Kyshawn George and Carlton Carrington) and second-year pro Bilal Coulibaly, who scored 20.  Jordan Poole led the Wizards with 24 points on 8 of 19 from the floor, including 3 of 10 from 3-point range. Carrington was hurt when Moritz Wager fell into his leg with 4:49 left in the game. He did not return. Orlando broke open a five-point game at halftime with a big third quarter, outscoring Washington 30-16. The Magic put together a game-changing 13-2 run capped by a traditional three-point play by Kentavious Caldwell-Pope to make it 77-62 in 6:25 left in the third. The lead changed hands in the first quarter with the Wizards taking a 15-12 advantage on a three by Sarr, but Orlando closed the quarter strong. Moritz Wagner and Franz Wagner made back-to-back threes to give Orlando a 24-20 lead, and they maintained a four-point edge after one. George got hot for Washington in the second quarter, making four threes, but the Wizards' defense collapsed. The Magic went on a 10-0 run with rookie Tristan Da Silva making a corner three followed by a three by Caldwell-Pope, Fritz Wagner's layup and a two-pointer from Da Silva to go up 54-40. George answered for the Wizards with eight straight points, including two threes, but the Magic led 61-56 at half.  The third quarter was all Magic. Poole collected three quick fouls in the first three minutes, giving him four for the game, and went to the bench. The Magic capitalized. Franz Wagner converted a traditional three-point play, Jalen Suggs sank a three and the Magic led 83-66 with 3:15 left in the quarter. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Vegas is 8-0-0 at T-Mobile Arena this season, outscoring its opponents an impressive 43-19 in the process. The eight-game home unbeaten streak matches the team record set in its inaugural season in 2017-18 when the Golden Knights made a storybook run to the Stanley Cup Final. The home-ice success is the main reason the Golden Knights are just one point behind the first-place Los Angeles Kings in the Pacific Division. Vegas has won just once in six road games (1-3-2). The Golden Knights return from a two-game road trip that saw them pick up their first road win of the season, 4-2, at Edmonton on Wednesday, and then follow that up with a 4-3 overtime loss at Seattle on Friday. Vegas jumped out to a 2-0 first-period lead over the Kraken but needed a fortunate 6-on-5 goal by Alex Pietrangelo with 1:22 to go to force overtime. Pietrangelo was attempting a pass that deflected in off the skate of Seattle defenseman Adam Larsson to tie it, 3-3. Jared McCann scored on a breakaway 29 seconds into overtime to win it for the Kraken. ""We got three of a possible four (points) on the road trip, so it's definitely a step in the right direction, but we definitely have some things to clean up, too,"" forward Tanner Pearson said. ""We wanted four (points), three's pretty good,"" Golden Knights coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""If you look at the big picture that part is pretty good. I just felt we certainly had a chance to get all four. We let that get away."" The win over the Oilers was a costly one, however. Captain Mark Stone, second on the team with 21 points (six goals, 15 assists) suffered a lower-body injury that kept him out of the Seattle loss. ""Day-to-day but we don't anticipate that he'll play (Monday),"" Cassidy said of Stone's status. Carolina had an eight-game winning streak snapped with a 6-4 loss to Colorado on Saturday night. The Hurricanes had to fly to Denver on the morning of the game because of extreme winter weather on Friday and the long day of travel, combined with the mile-high altitude, seemed to take its toll on Rod Brind'Amour's squad as the contest went on. Carolina took a 3-2 lead in the second period on a power-play goal by Martin Necas, but Colorado answered with three goals over a three-minute span at the end of the period to build a 5-3 cushion. The Hurricanes cut it to 5-4 on Jordan Martinook's second goal of the game early in the third period, but Mikko Rantanen sealed the victory for the Avalanche with an empty-netter with 50 seconds remaining. Brind'Amour refused to use his team's travel problems as an excuse for their first loss since Oct. 19 at St. Louis. ""There's no excuses because we came out really well,"" Brind'Amour said. ""But once we got into it, you could see that we were just hanging on really, and you can't hang on against that team. We had a couple guys (who) just didn't have it tonight. You could see we were just out of gas."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The Penguins sent down their former top netminder, who led the league with six shutouts last season, to AHL affiliate Wilkes-Barre/Scranton on Oct. 24 after he struggled mightily on the ice. In three games with the top club, Jarry yielded 12 goals on just 73 shots. He stayed on the ice less than 12 minutes in his last game with the Penguins, giving up three goals on just five shots against the Buffalo Sabres on Oct. 16, a game that Pittsburgh rallied to win 6-5 in overtime. Jarry went 4-1 in five games in the AHL with a 2.16 goals-against average. He told reporters Sunday that he appreciated being able to play consecutive games. Whether he gets that chance immediately with Pittsburgh, which earned three points on its three-game road trip, will be up to coach Mike Sullivan. The longtime leader behind the bench now has three goalies from which to choose. While praising Jarry, he did not say whether he'd immediately come back to the No. 1 position. ""I think one of the potential benefits of it is, one of them will have an opportunity to get quality practice time if that particular goalie isn't backing up,"" Sullivan told reporters Sunday. ""For example, this week, we got four games this week. There's a lot of opportunity there."" Pittsburgh capped its road trip with a 4-2 win Friday over the rival Washington Capitals. The Stars, meanwhile, are finally getting back into the swing of things after playing two games in Finland against the defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers to start the month. They had five days off before the two-game, two-day series, and then another four days off before beating the Chicago Blackhawks 3-1 on Thursday. On Saturday, Dallas lost 4-1 at Winnipeg, which has lost only once in 15 games this season. Much like the two games in Finland, which the Stars lost to the Panthers, Dallas coach Peter DeBoer said Saturday's game was also a chance to see where his team ranks among Cup contenders. Winnipeg jumped out to a 4-0 lead with more than 12 minutes left in the second period. DeBoer pulled netminder Jake Oettinger midway through the game after giving up the four goals on just 15 shots. ""I think so,"" DeBoer told reporters after the loss. ""I think when you look at these guys and Florida, you know, they've exposed us, and we've got to be a lot better. I think we've beaten the teams we should beat, but when we've had opportunities to play the top teams in the league, we haven't risen to the occasion."" The game will also be a showcase for some of the top veteran scorers in the league. Stars center Matt Duchene, 33, leads the team with seven goals and 15 points. Right behind him in goals with six is 32-year-old Tyler Seguin. For Pittsburgh, the ageless duo of Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby continues to lead the way.

Heading into a clash with the host Calgary Flames on Monday, the Kings have not lost consecutive games since the first week of the season. ""That's character and will to win, and veteran leadership,"" Los Angeles coach Jim Hiller said. ""Those guys have to get out there and organize the team without practicing much. If you don't have veteran guys or leadership like we have, it makes it pretty tough."" The Kings are set to open a quick two-game road swing on the heels of a 5-2 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets on Saturday and have won six of their past nine outings. Los Angeles showed the ability to bounce back during its win on Saturday, which followed a 4-2 loss to the Vancouver Canucks on Thursday.  ""After a loss, you want to come out with a good response,"" Kings defenseman Mikey Anderson said. ""First period, we all thought was so/so but we liked it a lot better in the second, so everyone is happy to come away with two points."" The team's defensemen have combined for 11 goals this season, tied for tops in the league, thanks to another couple against the Blue Jackets. ""Our forwards help us, they get to the net hard,"" Anderson said. ""They've done a good job creating traffic and we're just trying to shoot, get something down there and create something for them to get grinding."" Kings forward Phillip Danault is riding an assist streak of five games, with six points (one goal, five assists) during that run. The Flames return home after a good-news, bad-news three-game road trip that ended with a 3-2 shootout loss to the Sabres on Saturday. Calgary's 1-0-2 trip started with a victory against the Montreal Canadiens before the Flames fell in consecutive extra-time meetings with the Boston Bruins and Buffalo.  ""Four of six points. Not great, not just OK, but good,"" Calgary defenseman MacKenzie Weegar assessed. ""Battled back in a few games to get points, but you know, we come back next road trip, we want to win these games, not just get one point."" The Flames trailed in the third period during all three games of the trip. The comebacks are a point of pride, but Calgary is aware that good teams don't trail time and time again. ""We know that we've got to be better going home now,"" Calgary captain Mikael Backlund said. ""We know first period's going to be a big key for us. It's great that we (came) back and showed character, resilience, staying in every game, fighting back and get points, but if you want to win games, we've got to start to have better first periods."" That said, Calgary coach Ryan Huska is not about to criticize his players too much. The Flames have gained points in four of their past five games and are hanging tough in the standings. ""There's a lot of good things,"" Huska said. ""There's areas that we have to work on, and they're the common things that we'll continue to hammer on with our players."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Colorado hung on to win, splitting its last two games because goaltender Alexandar Georgiev seems to have found his confidence. Georgiev was pulled from his first two starts and appeared to have lost his grip on the No. 1 role, but he has turned it around. He will likely be in net Monday night in Denver when the Avalanche play the Nashville Predators in the second of a four-game homestand. Georgiev was strong in a 1-0 loss at Winnipeg on Thursday night, and big saves in the first period against Carolina on Saturday night gave Colorado a chance to rally to a 6-4 win. ""I felt like that game could have got away from us in the first 10 minutes and it didn't, and that was because of Georgie,"" Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said. ""He just gave our team a chance to come around. And that's what we need from our goaltending."" If Georgiev can keep performing, it bodes well for Colorado as it starts getting other players back. Miles Wood has been out two weeks with an upper-body injury but skated with the team on Sunday. Jonathan Drouin (upper body) hasn't played since the opener but is trending towards a return and Bednar confirmed Sunday that Valeri Nichushkin, who has been suspended since last May, will be in the lineup Friday night against Washington. The Avalanche have plugged holes to get through the beginning of the season, and it helps having Nathan MacKinnon and Cale Makar in the lineup. MacKinnon had four points in the win over the Hurricanes to move atop the scoring leaders, and Makar leads NHL defensemen with 24 points. Despite their production, Colorado has a losing record. ""All you can do is have a great effort and we've been doing that. Probably Chicago, at home, was our last bad game. We've been playing really well. I think we deserve more wins than we've gotten,"" MacKinnon said. Nashville enters Monday night's game having lost five of its last seven. One of the two wins came against the Avalanche on Nov. 2 and the other was Saturday night's 4-0 win over the Utah Hockey Club. Forward Jonathan Marchessault had a goal, just his third in 15 games, but he isn't concerned about his low output. ""Sometimes it's about getting chances, and I felt tonight I had a couple chances,"" Marchessault said. ""So that's a positive. Score or don't score, I think at the end of the day I just want scoring chances. That means I'm doing something good. And create chances for my teammates as well."" The Predators have been streaky this season, just like Colorado. They lost their first five, then won three straight before this latest stretch. Forsberg, who leads the team with eight goals, scored twice Saturday night. ""To see (Forsberg) be (Forsberg) and take over a game was really important for our group,"" coach Andrew Brunette said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

To begin round-robin action in the Ilie Nastase Group, Sinner defeated No. 7 seed Alex de Minaur of Australia 6-3, 6-4, and Fritz upended Russian fourth seed Daniil Medvedev 6-4, 6-3. The top eight players on the ATP Tour reached the season-ending Finals and were drawn into two groups. The top two players after the group stage will move on to a four-man knockout round. The other group features Alexander Zverev of Germany, Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, Norway's Casper Ruud and Russia's Andrey Rublev. Novak Djokovic, who won the last two years, is not competing due to injury. On Sunday, Sinner hit eight aces with just one double fault and finished the match with an 18-7 advantage in total winners as he coasted past de Minaur in an hour and 25 minutes. ""I'm glad that I managed to play this kind of level,"" said Sinner, who lost to Djokovic in the championship match last year. ""It's a great start for my side for this event, for this tournament, considering I haven't played an official match in four weeks. ""Every match, it's very difficult to play against (de Minaur). He's a great fighter. You have to earn every point you play. Every time we play, he changes a couple of things, so I have to be very aware. It's very difficult. We don't have to see only the result, but also how the match goes."" Fritz's serve was his biggest strength in his opening match. He won 33 of his 39 first-service points (84.6 percent) and hit nine aces without a double fault. By contrast, Medvedev had eight aces but suffered eight double faults. ""(The serve) was a big part of it for sure,"" Fritz said. ""(Medvedev) is such a good returner. You can make a lot of first serves, but if they are not very high quality, he just puts so many returns in the court. ""It was huge for me. I hit a lot of lines, a lot of spots to start out games."" Fritz and Sinner are scheduled to square off on Tuesday for their second group match, following Medvedev facing de Minaur. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The school told media outlets on Sunday that there has been no change in Golden's employment status. ""Todd Golden's status as UF men's basketball coach has not changed. He will be coaching the game Monday night,"" a school spokesman told ESPN. Golden released a statement Saturday that acknowledged the investigation and said he has been in touch with attorney Ken Turkel and considering filing a defamation suit. ""For the last month, I have actively participated in and respected the confidentiality of an ongoing school inquiry,"" Golden wrote on social media. ""I have recently engaged (attorney) Ken Turkel to advise me on my ability to bring defamation claims while this confidential investigation is ongoing. My family and I appreciate the support we have received and remain confident the university will continue its efforts to finish its review promptly."" The Alligator, a Florida student publication, cited Title IX documents filed on Sept. 27 that said Golden has been accused of potential violations of the school's Gender Equity Policy. They include acts of sexual exploitation, sexual harassment and the stalking of Florida students over the past year. Per the report, Golden sent ""photos and videos of his genitalia while traveling for UF,"" used social media to make sexual advances and request sexual favors, and stalked women. He is alleged to have taken photos of women, then send the pictures to them, and also of making visits to places where he knew he could find those same women. The Alligator interviewed two women who said they had complained about Golden, and they corroborated the Title IX documents. They said Golden had followed, then unfollowed, numerous women on social media to avoid suspicion, and one of them said his reach to women was vast. He told many women they were ""his drug"" or ""his good luck charm"" before games, she said. ""He just had this manipulation tactic over everyone,"" the woman told The Alligator.

Country Club. Langer, 67, shot his age or better for the third day in a row with his final-round, 5-under-par 66 to get to 18-under 266 for the week at the PGA Tour Champions' season finale. He hadn't won a tournament this season until Sunday, meaning at the last possible minute he extended his streak to 18 straight seasons winning at least one title. Langer also extended his record to 47 wins on the PGA Tour Champions. ""Was that exciting or what?"" Langer said on the Golf Channel broadcast. Alker, 53, won his second Schwab Cup in three seasons on the 50-and-older circuit. He entered the week No. 2 in the points race and passed leader Ernie Els of South Africa by tying for second in the 72-hole finale. Langer hit a poor tee shot and second shot at the 17th hole, leading to a bogey and a three-way tie at 17 under with Alker and Richard Green of Australia. Green was in the clubhouse with a 6-under 65 and preparing for a possible playoff at 17-under 267. He entered the week No. 6 in points and needed to win the tournament to win the Schwab Cup. Langer landed his approach shot at the par-5 18th much further than Alker, but his putt turned from left to right at the last second and dropped for a massive birdie. Langer dropped his putter and tossed his visor in celebration. Langer said his caddie, Terry Holt, had told him, ""It's one more putt."" ""He's a prophet, I guess,"" Langer said. Alker then left his birdie try short, failing to force a playoff. But with Green also coming up short, Alker had the Schwab Cup in the bag. ""It's been a heck of a journey,"" Alker said at the trophy presentation before thanking his team. ""... Obviously, I would have liked to win today, but Bernhard, we're gonna give a hand for Bernhard because he's incredible. He really is."" Alker shot a 66 with six birdies and one bogey, following Saturday's hugely important round of 63. He collected the Schwab Cup despite winning just one tournament this season, the season opener in Hawaii. But he had four runners-up and 15 top-10s entering the week. ""It's a season-long race, right, and so consistency, you want to try to get some wins in there as well,"" Alker said. ""I'm proud of the fact that I kept that consistency over the last few years."" Langer arrived at the course with a one-shot lead over Alker through 54 holes. He birdied his first four in a row and six of his first nine for a 6-under 30 before bogeying Nos. 10 and 11. ""I played good and then got a little unraveled there on the back nine, and Steven Alker got going,"" Langer said. Alker birdied Nos. 14, 15 and 17 to join the late tie with Langer and Green. Germany's Alex Cejka (68) was a distant fourth at 13 under. Australian Rod Pampling also shot 68 and placed fifth at 10 under.

It is the best start through 10 games for Arizona since it opened the 2021 season with seven straight wins.

Madlock made two free throws to trim the lead to nine again, but Sears converted a three-point play for a 12-point lead with two minutes remaining. The game was tightly contested throughout the first half. The Tigers scored the first four points of the game to take as big a lead as they would have in the first half, then the score was tied twice. The lead changed hands seven times before Knox's field goal and Madlock's four free throws helped the Hornets open their biggest lead, 32-25. Bailey's free throw trimmed the margin to six at halftime, but LSU didn't make a field goal during the final 5:34 of the half. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Bohannon, who turns 54 next month, has a career record of 72-38, including 5-6 in the ASUN Conference in 2022, and 3-6 in a transition season as an independent in 2023. The Owls have the losing record this year as a new member of Conference USA, which led to media reports that he was in danger of being fired. The Owls' lone victory came at home Oct. 23 against previously undefeated Liberty, 27-24. Kennesaw State has lost two games since then, including a 43-35 double-overtime loss to UTEP on Saturday in El Paso, Texas. ""Coach Brian Bohannon informed me this morning that he has decided to step down as our head football coach,"" Kennesaw State athletic director Milton Overton said. ""I want to express my sincere appreciation to Coach Bohannon and his family for their dedication to Kennesaw State University and our football program over the past 11 years. ""Coach Bohannon led Kennesaw State into the football era, poured his heart and soul into this program, and represented our university with the highest standards of professionalism and character."" Chandler Burks, the co-offensive coordinator and a former star quarterback for the Owls, will serve as interim head coach for the rest of the season. The Owls have home games on Saturday against Sam Houston and Nov. 23 against FIU before visiting Louisiana Tech in Ruston on Nov. 30. Kennesaw State hired Bohannon in March 2013 to launch an FCS program, which made its debut in 2015 and quickly enjoyed success, going 49-10 from 2017-21. His teams won three Big South Conference titles and made four FCS playoff appearances. He was twice selected the Big South Conference Coach of the Year and was the 2017 FCS national coach of the year by the American Football Coaches Association. A former wide receiver at the University of Georgia (1991-93), Bohannon was an assistant coach at Gardner-Webb (1996), Georgia Southern (1997-2001), Navy (2002-07) and Georgia Tech (2008-12) before he was hired to start the program at Kennesaw State in 2013. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

After passing William Byron by going from fifth to first in one lap following a restart with 54 laps to go, Logano kept his No. 22 Team Penske Ford out front and went on to win by 0.33 seconds over defending champion Blaney, giving owner Roger Penske his third straight title. Logano made it into the championship playoffs after Alex Bowman was disqualified after the Southern 500 at Darlington. He parlayed that into his third title -- also doing it in 2018 and 2022 -- and became the 10th racer all-time to win at least three Cup titles. Byron, Kyle Larson and Christopher Bell completed the top five in the race that featured four cautions. Title contender Tyler Reddick was sixth. Carson Hocevar finished 18th and earned Rookie of the Year honors. Two-time champion Kyle Busch was 21st and failed to win over the 36 races, ending his NASCAR-record streak of 19 consecutive seasons with at least one win. In his final start as a full-time driver, 2017 Cup winner Martin Truex Jr. brought them to green from the pole position at the Arizona desert's 1-mile track, but teammate Ty Gibbs created the first caution when he scrubbed the wall in Turn 4 in his No. 54 then smacked the Turn 2 wall hard on Lap 2 in a single-car incident. Logano powered past Truex on the restart and set the pace in the 312-lap event to close 2024. Soon, all four of the title contenders were running inside the top 10 before the halfway point of 60-lap Stage 1, which Logano won after leading 54 laps. However, Logano's pit crew had difficulties on the right side during the pit stop, gridding him fifth when the group led by Chase Elliott left pit road with Byron and Blaney running in third and fourth. In the race's oddest moment as the field was about to restart, the Toyota pace car turned late onto pit road and made hard contact with the sand-filled yellow barrels abutting the beginning of the pit road outer wall. That wreck created a red-flag period. A week after being penalized for wall-riding on the final turns at Martinsville and eliminated from title contention, Bell had the look of a champion on the rare Champ 4 weekend when Joe Gibbs Racing did not have an entry among the quartet of Cup seekers. A day after saying he felt wronged by NASCAR and ""cheated"" out of a title chance, Bell had a strong No. 20 JGR Toyota for most of Stage 2. However, Blaney showed his strength by moving past Bell in the final laps as Penske Fords pulled off the segment sweep in the first 185 circuits around the slightly banked layout. With Bell leading following Stage 2's conclusion, Blaney, Byron and Logano occupied the next three spots, while Reddick slotted ninth with 117 laps left. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Its lone win came against Cal on Sept. 21. The Seminoles have dropped six straight games since that victory. Last season, Florida State went 13-1 and barely missed a College Football Playoff spot in the four-team system. The Seminoles lost 63-3 to Georgia in the Orange Bowl.

A third-year pro out of Oklahoma State, Eckroat joined the tour in 2023 and previously won at the Cognizant Classic in The Palm Beaches in March. Eckroat began the day a stroke behind leaders Justin Lower, Carson Young and Colombia's Nico Echavarria while he was also tied with two other players, Max Greyserman and Joe Highsmith.  That group, with the exception of Echavarria, was tightly aligned through nine holes Sunday, but Eckroat caught fire to begin the back nine of El Cardonal at Diamante, creating some needed separation with four birdies across the first five holes (Nos. 10-12, 14). That hot stretch, paired with his six birdies over his first eight holes, was ultimately necessary, as Eckroat fired his second bogey of the day on the par-5 18th, putting him at 24-under 264 for the tournament. That opened the door ever so slightly for Young (7-under 65), who could have forced a playoff with an eagle on 18. But Young, who carded seven other birdies on the day, settled for another to finish 23 under for the tourney, giving Eckroat a one-stroke victory. Lower (65), who was three strokes back after 17 holes, made up two of them with an eagle on 18 to finish in a tie for second with Young. Eckroat finished with 11 birdies against two bogeys to complete his remarkable day. Greyserman, meanwhile, was steady throughout but could never quite get into position to apply pressure. His eight-birdie, one-bogey day left him at 7 under for the round and 22 under for the tournament. Highsmith finished in fifth place at 19 under with his 4-under 68 final round, while Echavarria landed in a six-way tie for sixth place at 17 under after his 1-under 71. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Tierna Davidson broke the scoreless draw to give Gotham a 1-0 lead in the 67th minute off a set piece. Lavelle served the ball into the center of the box and it landed by Davidson, who was amid a crowd of Thorns but got her foot on the ball to send a shot past the arm of goalkeeper Shelby Hogan. It was Davidson's first NWSL goal since 2019, then with the Chicago Red Stars. The Thorns capitalized on a free kick of their own to pull level in the 75th minute. Olivia Moultrie served a cross from the left, and Reilyn Turner jumped for header on the far side, directing just inside the right post. Gotham controlled much of the play in the first half, working more time in the attacking third while managing four shot attempts, one on target. Portland had only one shot attempt, not on target, in the opening 45 minutes. Gotham goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger nearly served up a golden opportunity for Christine Sinclair in the 40th minute when her attempt at midfield hit the star Canadian forward before Gotham recovered the ball in the defensive third.

Avery, Suemnick and Thompson were the only Oklahoma State players to score more than eight points. Suemnick shot 5-of-6 from the field. Arturo Dean led Oklahoma State with nine rebounds and five assists. St. Thomas' leading scorer Miles Barnstable was held to just six points in the contest and didn't make his first field goal until there was 6:49 remaining. St. Thomas was led in scoring by Kendall Blue with 18 points, followed by Drake Dobbs, who had 14. St. Thomas went up 6-2 in the first three minutes of the game but went scoreless over the next 5:19, allowing Oklahoma State to take a 12-6 lead with 12:28 remaining in the first half. Oklahoma State made it a 17-2 run to take a 19-8 lead just past the 10-minute mark. St. Thomas subsequently answered with a 10-0 run of its own that brought the Tommies back within a point. They started their rally by making three consecutive field goals, including back-to-back 3-pointers by Carter Bjerke, while forcing the Cowboys to miss eight straight shots from the field during that stretch. The Cowboys answered with a 9-0 run that saw St. Thomas go into another lengthy scoring drought over a span of 3:50, falling behind by double digits again until a technical foul by Suemnick sent the Tommies to the line to cut the lead to 28-20. The Tommies couldn't keep the deficit to single digits before the break and went to halftime trailing 33-23. Oklahoma State shot 27-of-60 (45 percent) from the field, including 6-of-22 (27.3 percent) from 3-point range. St. Thomas outshot Oklahoma State from behind the arc, making 15 triples on 36 attempts (41.7 percent) but went just 25-of-62 (40.3 percent) from the field overall. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

They're also aware that a torrid start quickly has transformed their profile. ""We know how hard it is to win in this league,"" the Cavaliers' Darius Garland said. ""And now, 11 in a row, 11-0. We're the hunted. We're not the hunters no more."" Cleveland earned its most recent victory behind a furious comeback. Hosting the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday, the Cavaliers sputtered after halftime, scoring only 13 points in the third quarter. Behind a double-double from Evan Mobley (23 points, 16 rebounds) and big scoring efforts from Donovan Mitchell (22 points) and Garland (20), Cleveland steadied things. An 82-68 deficit with 1:03 left in the third became a 105-100 victory. ""Normally, this is 11 games in, you're not thinking about a streak,"" Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""But tonight, you're like, man, 'I don't want it to end that this way.' ... We're trying to win every game, but it's kind of weirdly in the back of your mind when you're out there competing, like, 'man, we got to keep this thing going.' "" Chicago is aiming to win consecutive games for the second time this season. The Bulls stopped a four-game slide with Saturday's 125-113 win in Atlanta, relying on a big fourth quarter of their own. Chicago outscored Atlanta 35-15 in the final period, benefiting from a balanced attack that produced eight scorers in double figures. Ayo Dosunmu led the way with 19 points, Nikola Vucevic posted a double-double of 18 points and 12 boards, and Zach LaVine and Coby White added 18 points apiece. LaVine returned after missing the past three games with a right adductor strain. ""It's always good to get guys back in the lineup,"" he said. Opponents have outscored the Bulls in the first quarter nine times in 10 games to begin the season. Improved pace and ball movement have been catalysts for helping the team regroup; the Bulls have recorded at least 30 assists five times. ""We just wanted to find a way to get back in the winner's column,"" Chicago guard Josh Giddey said. ""I thought we started the game not great, and that third quarter really got us back in it and that group starting the fourth did an awesome job; the energy was great. I think it was a complete team effort tonight and that's what we needed against a group like this."" Challenging the Cavaliers, the 12th team in NBA history to start a season 11-0, will require sustained sharpness. Cleveland knows that well from the other side, with Saturday's frantic finish continuing the good vibes. ""Defensively, we locked in, got stops, got rebounds, boxed out, didn't miss opportunities,"" Mitchell said. ""We did all the little things, and I think that's what you saw tonight, just the effort as a whole. And that's what made this one special."" Cleveland has won seven of the past eight meetings against Chicago, but the Bulls lead the all-time series 133-101. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

It was the first catch as a Steeler for Williams, who was acquired Tuesday in a trade with the New York Jets, and came on third-and-9 play after the Steelers had fumbled at Washington's 1-yard line on their previous drive. After Chris Boswell's extra point, Washington (7-3) drove to midfield, but Jayden Daniels' pass to tight end Zach Ertz came up a yard short on fourth-and-9. The Commanders would have gotten the ball back, but Russell Wilson drew an offside penalty on fourth-and-1 at the Washington 49 with 1:02 remaining. Wilson was 14-of-28 for 195 yards, three touchdowns and one interception for the Steelers (7-2). George Pickens caught five passes for 91 yards and a score. Daniels finished 17-of-34 for 202 yards. Terry McLaurin had five catches for 113 yards and Austin Ekeler had two rushing scores. Early in the fourth quarter, Pittsburgh drove inside the 10. On second down at the 8, Jaylen Warren bulled his way to the 1, but as several Washington players struggled to bring him down the ball came out. Jeremy Chinn recovered for the Commanders. Pittsburgh took the early 7-0 lead when Wilson hit Pickens, who made a twisting, diving catch in the end zone for a 16-yard touchdown. Special teams factored heavily into the next two scores. On fourth-and-15 from deep in their own territory, the Steelers faked the punt, but James Pierre dropped the wide-open pass from Miles Killebrew. Washington took over at the 15, and three plays later Ekeler scored from the 1. Early in the second quarter, Washington's Olamide Zaccheaus muffed a punt. The Steelers started again at the 14 and Wilson hit Pat Freiermuth for a 3-yard touchdown. Trailing 14-10, the Commanders took over on their own 6-yard line with 5:39 in the half. On third-and-4 from the Pittsburgh 38, Daniels hit Luke McCaffrey for 23 yards and Ekeler later scored on another 1-yard run to send the Commanders to the locker room ahead 17-14. Washington got the second-half kick and on the first play, Daniels hit McLaurin for 54 yards to the Pittsburgh 17. Three plays later, the pair connected for 16 yards. Jeremy McNichols punched it in and the lead was 24-14. On the next drive, Wilson hit Pickens for a 34-yard catch-and-run to the Commanders 12, and Najee Harris scored from the 1 to pull the Steelers within 24-21. Zane Gonzalez, filling in for the injured Austin Seibert, hit from 41 yards out to make it 27-21 Commanders late in the third quarter. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Moody had earlier missed field goals of 49, 50 and 44, with the final one of the bunch coming with 3:09 remaining. Moody's third miss led to Chase McLaughlin's 26-yard field goal for the Buccaneers to tie the game 20-20 with 41 seconds remaining. The Bucs drove to the 49ers' 8-yard line to set up for the game-tying kick with the help of three penalties and a circus 8-yard completion by Baker Mayfield, who escaped pressure and fended off defensive end Nick Bosa long enough to get off a throw. Purdy's 13-yard pass to Jauan Jennings set up San Francisco's game-winning field goal from Moody. Jenings had seven receptions for 93 yards. 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan worked McCaffrey back into the offense mix immediately after missing the first eight games of the season with bilateral Achilles tendinitis. His presence also freed up opportunities for wide receivers Deebo Samuel and Jennings - both of whom had been dealing with injuries - and tight end George Kittle.  McCaffrey, the 2023 Offensive Player of the Year, finished with 39 yards rushing on 13 carries and 68 receiving yards on six catches for San Francisco (5-4). Purdy finished 25-for-36 for 353 yards with touchdown passes to rookie Ricky Pearsall and Kittle. Pearsall's 46-yard TD reception in the first quarter, that gave the 49ers a 7-0 lead, was the first score of the rookie's career and came after he was shot in the chest in a robbery attempt in August. He finished with four receptions for 73 yards. Tampa Bay (4-6) lost All-Pro left tackle Tristen Wirfs to a knee injury in the first half. Rachaad White's 9-yard touchdown reception from Mayfield tied the game 10-10 just 55 seconds into the second half as Tampa Bay exploited a muffed punt by Jacob Cowing at the San Francisco 21. Kittle's 11-yard TD catch came after Purdy extended the play gave San Francisco a 20-17 lead with 7:02 left. The eight-play, 52-yard drive was helped by an over-the-shoulder catch by McCaffrey that went for 30 yards. Tampa Bay took its first lead of the game 17-13 with 14:18 left against a defense withering in 90-degree heat. Running back Bucky Irving sliced in from 12 yards to cap a 12-play, 70-yard drive.

The Vikings' defense had three takeaways in the fourth quarter to seal the victory. Mac Jones scored on a 1-yard run to mark the only scoring for Jacksonville (2-8). Jones completed 14 of 22 passes for 111 yards and two interceptions as a replacement starter for Trevor Lawrence, who missed the game because of a shoulder injury. Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold completed 24 of 38 passes for 241 yards but threw three interceptions. Minnesota running back Aaron Jones finished with 101 total yards (88 rushing, 13 receiving). Romo put the Vikings on top 9-7 with 7:14 remaining in the fourth quarter. His 34-yard field goal sneaked inside the right upright for the go-ahead score. On the next possession, the Jaguars committed their first turnover on a botched snap. Jones could not handle the ball, and Vikings defensive lineman Harrison Phillips pounced on the fumble at the Jacksonville 25-yard line. Five plays later, the Vikings settled for another field goal to take a 12-7 lead. Romo connected from 29 yards for his fourth field goal. Jones followed with another turnover on the next drive. He underthrew a pass toward receiver Gabe Davis, and Byron Murphy Jr. stepped in front of it for an interception. The play marked Murphy's fourth interception of the season and his third in the past three games. Jacksonville's final drive ended in a third consecutive turnover. Camryn Bynum intercepted a deep pass at the Vikings' 1-yard line with 1:52 remaining. The Vikings opened the scoring midway through the first quarter.

It's the recent off-court concerns with Title IX allegations against coach Todd Golden that have dominated the news. In a home battle with Grambling on Monday in Gainesville, Fla., the Gators will try to keep the focus on a promising hoops season. The Gators (2-0) come in off a 98-83 win over South Florida and an 81-60 victory over Jacksonville in the first week of the season. After 24 wins and an NCAA Tournament berth in Golden's second season, Florida is well-positioned to continue an upward trend. The Gators have been led by a powerful scoring quartet who have accounted for over 77 percent of the Florida offense. Senior guards Walter Clayton and Will Richard have averaged 19 and 18 points per game, respectively, while Aussie sophomore Alex Condon (18 ppg) and junior guard Alijah Martin (14 ppg) complete the high-scoring group. Florida has connected on 72.9 percent of its 2-point attempts through two games, which is among the nation's leaders. The Gators' biggest early weakness has been the glass, where they have a net-zero rebounding margin. Despite two early wins, Golden has room for concern with the Gators. ""Fundamentally, we're not great right now,"" he said after Florida's win over Jacksonville. ""Part of it is a combination of being too amped up and trying to run in and trace down the ball, as opposed to hitting bodies."" Golden later reiterated, ""We did not rebound well enough if we want to be the team we're capable of."" Meanwhile, Grambling (1-1) is led by veteran coach Donte Jackson and presents a legitimate challenge. Jackson led the Tigers to 21 wins and the school's first NCAA Tournament berth last season.  This year, Grambling topped NAIA-level opponent Southern-New Orleans 92-42, then dropped a close battle with No. 24 Ole Miss, 66-64. The Tigers led by eight points at halftime in that game but were eventually done in by 22 turnovers. Four Tigers are currently scoring in double figures, led by Kintavious Dozier at 15.0 ppg. Dozier earned all-SWAC honors last season. Among the other top Tigers are Mikale Stevenson (13.5 ppg), NC State transfer Ernest Ross (12.5 ppg) and Antwan Burnett (12.0 ppg, 8.5 rebounds per game). The Tigers, unlike their hosts, have been excellent on the boards, outrebounding opponents by 10.5 rebounds per game, including a plus-six margin at Ole Miss. On the downside, they are one of the worst free-throw shooting teams in the nation at just 59.4 percent. Ole Miss coach Chris Beard spoke at length in praise of Grambling after his hard-fought win. ""We didn't play our best, but the reason we didn't play our best was a lot on the other team -- Grambling,"" Beard said. He later clarified, ""They had our full attention. This isn't going to be one of those deals where Ole Miss didn't play well. That's an NCAA Tournament team. That's where we're trying to get."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

In the 96th minute, a Spirit cross in front of the Bay FC goal bounced off the shoulder of defender Caprice Dydasco and landed in the back of the net. It proved to be the difference in a defensive battle that needed extra time to decide. The second-seeded Spirit will advance to the semifinals and host the winner of Gotham FC and the Portland Thorns, while the inaugural season for expansion side Bay FC ended in disappointment for the No. 7 seed. Neither side netted a goal until deep into the second half, as the Spirit's Aubrey Kingsbury and Bay FC's Katelyn Rowland put forth some of their best goalkeeping efforts of the season. Kingsbury had a highlight-worthy stop in the 35th minute, leaping into the air to punch an attempt over the bar. Rowland denied Trinity Rodman a goal in the 24th minute. In the 82nd minute, Asisat Oshoala finally broke the scoreless draw, knocking in a right-footed shot from very close range to put Bay FC ahead 1-0 with minutes remaining. The ball came to her Penelope Hocking, who corralled a delivery from the corner and sent it to Oshoala to tap in her eighth goal of the season. The Spirit countered, scoring in the 86th minute. After a cross from Rodman was knocked out of the box, Tara McKeown charged up the middle of the field, took possession of the ball and fired a right-footed shot that took a few bounces before dribbling past Rowland into the left corner of the net. Nothing was produced between the two sides in nine minutes of stoppage time to send the elimination game into extra time.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Vanderbilt won despite shooting 12.0 percent on 25 attempts from 3-point range but had just nine turnovers and won the rebounding battle 53-32, while making 78.0 percent of its 41 free throws.  McGlockton, a transfer from Boston College, recorded his second double-double in as many games.  BJ Ward scored 22 points, Teddy Washington Jr. had 19 and TJ Biel added 12 for the Redhawks (0-2), who hit 48.0 percent of their 25 shots from 3-point range. Southeast Missouri State went 8 of 13 (61.5 percent) from the free-throw line.  It was the Redhawks' 36th-straight loss against a power-conference team.  The game was the Vanderbilt debut for Hoggard, who returned from an NCAA suspension in his first game after transferring from Michigan State. Nickel canned his second 3-pointer of the second half with 16:10 left, giving the Commodores their first double-figure lead at 56-45.  Southeast Missouri State continued to hit wide-open 3s, with Washington making one with 8:00 left, that cut the margin to 70-65. But the fouls began to pile up on the Redhawks. Washington picked up his fourth as part of a double-technical with Hoggard, while starter Troy Cole Jr. fouled out with 3:57 left. Ward checked out with 6:06 left with the training staff attending to the area around his knee before checking back in with 3:35 left and the Redhawks trailing 78-70. They never got closer from there.  Ward had 14 points at half, as the Redhawks made seven 3-pointers compared to one on 13 attempts for Vanderbilt. But Vanderbilt had a 40-38 edge at half thanks to 14 offensive rebounds and a 15 of 22 showing from the foul line.  The Redhawks led 16-6 early but Hoggard, who checked in at the 16:25 mark of the first half, keyed a 17-4 run that gave Vanderbilt its first lead.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The Ospreys (3-0), who defeated SEC member South Carolina in the season opener, earned their first win over an Atlantic Coast Conference opponent. They became the first opponent to score 100 against Georgia Tech at McCamish Pavilion since Duke in 2017. Harris was 8-for-10 from the floor with seven rebounds.

But North Florida was 8-for-9 at the line, while Georgia Tech was just 1-for-6, allowing the Ospreys to hold a 53-49 halftime lead. North Florida continued its hot shooting to start the second half. The Ospreys outscored the Yellow Jackets 11-0 to take a 66-56 lead at 16:27 and never slowed down. UNF built the lead to 20 when Lliteras drove the lane for a slam, drew a foul and finished the three-point play to complete a 14-0 run that made it it 80-60 with 11:08 left.

Sallis sank two free throws with 4.7 seconds left as the Demon Deacons (3-0) went up by three and completed a rally from a 13-point first-half hole. Rubin Jones made a final foul shot for Michigan and intentionally missed the next attempt, but the Wolverines couldn't secure the rebound for a final shot. Freshman Juke Harris scored 11 points off the bench in Wake Forest's first game away from home. Roddy Gayle Jr. led Michigan (1-1) with 11 points, Tre Donaldson had 10 points and nine rebounds and L.J. Cason also scored 10. Sam Walters (nine points), Nimari Burnett (nine), Jones (nine) and Vladislav Goldin (eight) were contributors. Spillers' 3-pointer gave Wake Forest its first lead at 44-43 with 15:56 to play, but there was a back-and-forth stretch after that. Michigan led 57-53 before failing to score for more than five minutes. Sallis posted six points during a 10-0 Demon Deacons run. Leading 65-63, Wake Forest benefited from a Michigan airball as the shot clock expired. The action stayed at the other end for 90 seconds as the Demon Deacons collected a pair of offensive rebounds before a turnover. On the final of Michigan's three straight turnovers, Spillers scored on a breakaway dunk for a 67-63 edge with 38 seconds left. Gayle hit a pair of free throws for Michigan at the 30.3-second mark. Michigan shot 14-for-28 from the field in the first half but 10-for-29 in the second half.

The Scarlet Knights (1-0) started the season with a 75-52 victory Wednesday over Wagner despite the absence of Ace Bailey, the nation's No. 2 overall recruit in 2024. Bailey, a 6-foot-10 guard/forward, is listed as day-to-day after suffering an unspecified injury during practice last week. ""Every year is exciting in its own way, but every year is challenging in its own way too,"" Rutgers coach Steve Pikiell said. ""So quick reminder with Ace, the challenges that come with your season and having guys ready, and early in the season, is always a challenge."" Another five-star recruit, guard Dylan Harper, led host Rutgers with 20 points and added four assists Wednesday, playing 32 minutes in the 23-point victory. ""It was a dream come true, to be honest,"" Harper said. ""Getting a chance to play in front of this crowd, in front of the Riot Squad, it's just crazy. Honestly, a blessing."" Freshman Lathan Sommerville had 11 points and eight rebounds in his first collegiate game. PJ Hayes IV scored 12 points and Jeremiah Williams added 10. Despite the lopsided win, Pikiell is looking for improvement in his team in Game 2. ""We gotta rebound better, we gotta do a lot of things, but we've got a lot more players to decide from,"" he said. Wagner outrebounded Rutgers 42-39, but the Scarlet Knights' defense helped them overcome the deficiency on the boards and come away with the victory. Rutgers held Wagner to 34.9 percent shooting from the field and forced 11 turnovers, scoring 16 points off those mistakes. Now, the Scarlet Knights will face Saint Peter's (0-2), which is working in eight new players under coach Bashir Mason. ""Toughness,"" Mason said about the Peacocks' style of basketball. ""We practice it every day. Just being able to withstand adverse conditions, rough handlings, staying together and staying connected. Figuring out ways to win."" Although Saint Peter's is winless, both losses have come by seven points or fewer after second-half comeback efforts. On Friday, the Peacocks traveled to UMass Lowell and fell 81-74. Saint Peter's trailed by nine at halftime and by 15 early in the second half before drawing within four points five times down the stretch. Marcus Randolph led Saint Peter's with 16 points, and Stephon Roberts was two points shy of a double-double with eight points and 11 rebounds. The Peacocks started the season with a 57-53 loss at Seton Hall on Monday. Saint Peter's will play eight of its first nine games on the road this year. Last season, the Peacocks traveled to Rutgers, too, losing 71-40 on Nov. 27. Saint Peter's recovered at the end of the season to win the MAAC Tournament title and gain its second NCAA Tournament berth in the three seasons. In 2022, the Peacocks won three tournament games before falling to North Carolina in the Elite Eight. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Kam Jones, who dropped 32 points in a season-opening win over Stony Brook, was the driving force behind the offense again. He scored 24 points on 9-of-14 shooting and dished eight assists to go with five rebounds and three steals.  ""I'm just out there with a mentality of making the right play, whatever that means,"" Jones said, per the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. ""If that means me scoring, fine. If that means me passing. If that means I'm in the corner with the correct spacing. Whatever it is, that's what I'm trying to do every possession on both ends."" Chase Ross also made key contributions, including scoring seven of his 11 points in the second half. He added five rebounds, four assists and a career-high five steals. Marquette has 23 steals through two games and has scored 46 points off opponents' turnovers. Central Michigan (1-1) hosted Stony Brook on Thursday and squandered a 12-point lead en route to a 73-72 loss. Bryan Ndjonga missed two free throws after being intentionally fouled, and the Chippewas yielded a game-winning layup to Collin O'Connor with three seconds left. Jakobi Heady leads Central Michigan with a 14.5 scoring average through two games. Damarion Bonds, a junior college transfer, made his team debut against Stony Brook and scored 10 points in 10 minutes off the bench, including back-to-back 3-pointers during the first half. ""He has the chance to be an electric scorer, and we got a small glimpse of what he has the ability to do,"" coach Tony Barbee told the Central Michigan student newspaper.

It's likely McNeese State worked through some of those issues as it rebounded with a 111-57 win over the College Of Biblical Studies, who play in the National Christian Collegiate Athletic Association. Guard Javohn Garcia is averaging 18 points for the Cowboys on 60.9 percent shooting from the field. Providence transfer Alyn Breed scored 18 points in the season opener but missed their second game for precautionary reasons. He is expected to play against Alabama. ""His knee had some swelling after our practices (Wednesday),"" Wade said Thursday. ""We had a couple practices (Wednesday), one in the afternoon and one at night, and he had a little swelling after that, so we decided not to risk it. He could have played today, but we got to be smart about that."" The Crimson Tide (2-0) entered the season ranked second in the Associated Press Top 25. They backed up their ranking with a resounding 56-point win over UNC Asheville in the season opener before beating Arkansas State 88-79 in a much tighter affair in their second game.  Mark Sears, the Southeastern Conference preseason player of the year, has been leading the charge for Alabama over the first two games with an average of 19.5 points per game. Guard Labaron Philon leads the team with an average of 6 assists per game in addition to 11 points per game. Philon was one assist shy of a double-double in his collegiate debut. ""He's a great two-way player,"" Alabama coach Nate Oats said about Philon, a freshman. ""He plays really hard on both sides of the ball. ... He's got size and athleticism and he's been playing the right way, really, since he stepped on campus."" Big man Clifford Omoruyi also has been a difference maker for the Crimson Tide. The 6-foot-11 center from Nigeria is averaging 14 points per game and 8.5 rebounds while shooting 91.7 percent (11-for-12) from the field. Only four players with at least 10 field goal attempts on the young season have a better field goal percentage than Omoruyi. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The No. 14 Boilermakers (2-0) look to please their leader when they battle Yale (1-1) on Monday night in nonconference play at West Lafayette, Ind. A showdown with No. 2 Alabama looms on Friday for the program that lost to UConn in last season's national championship game. Also, the contest against the Bulldogs definitely rates tougher than opening foes Texas A&M-Corpus Christi and Northern Kentucky. Yale was one of the darlings of March Madness last season. The 13th-seeded Bulldogs of the Ivy League stunned fourth-seeded Auburn 78-76 in the first round before getting stomped by San Diego State in the second round. So Painter wants a larger effort in Game No. 3 of the season. ""He kind of ripped us a little bit, but it's simple stuff,"" Boilermakers guard Fletcher Loyer said in the postgame press conference following Friday's 72-50 home win over Northern Kentucky. ""It's just talking to each other. We talk off the floor so we can talk on the floor. And he always says, 'If you're doing it, you're saying it.' ""Just making sure we're all being positive with each other, make or missed shots. Just keep talking to each other, and ultimately that leads to success."" Loyer certainly isn't the cause of any dismay as he leads the Boilermakers with an 18.5 scoring average and has knocked down 7 of 10 3-pointers. Trey Kaufman-Renn is averaging 14.5 points and a team-best 7.0 rebounds while top-notch point guard Braden Smith is averaging 11.5 points and a team-high 11.0 assists per game. Starting center Daniel Jacobsen unlikely will be available after sustaining a knee injury one minute into the game against Northern Kentucky on Friday. Painter said Jacobson would undergo an MRI exam Saturday. Will Berg is the likely starter against Yale. The Bulldogs split their first two games, beating Quinnipiac to open the season before losing 91-79 to Illinois-Chicago on Friday. March Madness hero John Poulakidas scored 21 points against UIC and is averaging 20.0 over the first two games. Poulakidas scored 28 points in the mammoth upset of Auburn. He made 10 of 15 shots, including 6 of 9 from 3-point range. Yale coach James Jones is in his 24th season at the school. That upset was his second NCAA Tournament victory. Jones is worried about whether last March could be the Ivy League's last hurrah as recent changes like NIL and the transfer portal work against the education-minded schools in his conference. ""I don't know how feasible it is to continue the success we have nationally in the league, given the new structure of things, where everybody is being paid except for our guys,"" Jones told reporters earlier this month. ""I don't know if we can sustain. Five years from now, is an Ivy League team going to be able to go to the NCAA Tournament and beat an Auburn team? I don't know. ""From that standpoint, it makes it hard. We're 40 minutes away from a Sweet 16 last year and we've gotten (to the second round) twice. I don't know. Different world. Absolutely different world. It's changed, and I don't know if it's changed for the better."" Yale is 0-2 against Purdue and the most recent matchup came in the 2022 NCAA Tournament. The Boilermakers prevailed 78-56. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The group's mentality is to always find areas to improve, and that will be the case as Iowa State (1-0) tips off against Kansas City (2-0) on Monday night in Ames, Iowa. ""Yeah, we have to do a better job of playing simple basketball,"" Otzelberger said. ""I think, offensively, there are times the ball got stuck with one guy and we over-dribbled it,"" he said. ""There are plays on the defensive end that we didn't finish with two hands. We (would get) a rebound, we dribble it off of someone's foot or we have a careless turnover. Things that were just sloppy that are uncharacteristic of how we play."" Despite those imperfections, Iowa State cruised to an 83-44 win over Mississippi Valley State in its opener last Monday. Keshon Gilbert scored 17 points, Tamin Lipsey contributed 16, and Joshua Jefferson and Milan Momcilovic added 10 apiece to lead the Cyclones, who shot only 23.8 percent (5 of 21) from beyond the arc.  That's an area Otzelberger will look to improve upon against Kansas City. ""I thought we had good looks,"" he said. ""Curt (Jones) and Milan, specifically, had really good looks. Overall, we want to shoot the ball better than we did. But I didn't think it was because we didn't have good looks. It was because they weren't falling for whatever reason."" Kansas City will aim to challenge the Cyclones after opening its season with back-to-back, double-digit victories. The Roos cruised to a 124-36 win over Kansas Christian in their most recent game Friday night. The 88-point margin of victory against the NCCAA Division II program is the biggest in program history for Kansas City. The previous record was a 73-point win over Bacone (111-38) on Nov. 18, 2019. ""I felt like we put ourselves in position early to just execute and not have to worry about winning the game, so to speak,"" Roos coach Marvin Menzies said. ""That's something we didn't do in our last game (91-68 win over Hannibal-LaGrange last Monday), so I felt like we took a step in the right direction."" Anderson Kopp scored 22 points to lead Kansas City on Friday. He added five rebounds and three steals. Kasheem Grady II also will look to stay hot for the Roos. He scored 21 points on 7-of-11 shooting from the field, including 5 of 7 from beyond the arc, against Kansas Christian. Menzies said his team needs to be focused for a tough test at Iowa State. ""The train is out of the station now,"" he said. ""So it's rolling. We'll put this game behind us and put all our focus into the next possession."" Menzies and Otzelberger share a connection: Both men were head coaches at UNLV. Menzies spent three seasons there (2016-19) and was immediately succeeded by Otzelberger (2019-21). Monday will mark the sixth meeting between Iowa State and Kansas City. The Cyclones are 5-0 in the series. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The Panthers (3-7) got the ball at the New York 23 for its only possession of overtime. Bryce Young completed 15 of 25 passes for 126 yards with a touchdown and Chuba Hubbard churned out a career-high 153 yards on the ground on 28 carries. Giants quarterback Daniel Jones went 22-for-37 for 190 yards with two interceptions. He ran for a touchdown.  Running back Tyrone Tracy Jr. gained 103 yards on 18 carries with a touchdown, but his fumble on the first snap of overtime set up Carolina's winning points. Graham Gano's 42-yard field goal with five seconds to play forced overtime for the Giants (2-8), who've lost five straight games.  With the score at 17-14, the teams traded turnovers in the final eight minutes. The Panthers lost a fumble, only to have Jones throw an interception four plays later. New York got the ball back at its own 21-yard line with 2:23 remaining and drove for the tying field goal.  The Giants opened the second half by going 65 yards in 10 plays while consuming more than six minutes off the clock. Tracy ran 32 yards for the touchdown. Carolina responded by marching 80 yards in 10 plays with Hubbard scoring on a 1-yard run. Then in the fourth quarter, the Giants covered 96 yards in 13 plays and used almost seven minutes in doing so. Jones capped the drive by running 2 yards for a score as New York closed within 17-14. Aside from one drive, there wasn't much offense in the first half. The Panthers scored first by going 90 yards in eight plays, with Young connecting with tight end Ja'Tavion Sanders for a 5-yard touchdown play. Carolina added to its lead on the next possession, using 10 plays to go 56 yards to set up Pineiro's 53-yard field goal. Trailing 10-0, the Giants threatened in the second quarter, but Gano -- a former Carolina kicker in his first game back after an injury -- sailed a 43-yard field goal attempt wide right. New York reached Carolina territory again before halftime, getting all the way to the 18-yard line before Xavier Woods intercepted Jones on the first play after the two-minute warning.

NFL Network reported that rest and rehab appear to be the plan of the Jaguars (2-7) for Lawrence. However, surgery remains an option Lawrence and the Jaguars will consider. Mac Jones, who was acquired by Jacksonville via trade in March, will start Sunday's game versus the Vikings (6-2).  Lawrence, 25, will miss the second game of his NFL career. He sustained the injury in the second quarter of Jacksonville's 28-23 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles last Sunday. He finished the game, however, and completed 16 of 31 passes for 169 yards and two interceptions. Jones became party to a controversy when current Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores was fired by the Dolphins. According to former NFL executive Michael Lombardi, Flores told his then-starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa that Miami should've drafted Jones instead. As the starting quarterback of the Patriots, Jones lost to Flores and the Dolphins twice in 2021. The No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, Lawrence has completed 61.3 percent of his passes for 2,004 yards, 11 touchdowns and six interceptions through nine starts in 2024.

The Sabres followed impressive blowout wins over the Ottawa Senators and the New York Rangers with a 3-2 shootout victory over the Calgary Flames on Saturday. J.J. Peterka scored the game-winning shootout goal, while Tage Thompson fired home his team-leading 10th goal of the season in the victory. Thompson has goals in three straight games and could improve his totals versus a Canadiens' team that he has found success against in his career. The 27-year-old forward has seven goals and seven assists across 12 outings against Montreal. Sabres goaltender Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen has been pivotal to their recent success. Luukkonen has allowed just 2.25 goals per game while winning six of his past eight starts. Head coach Lindy Ruff gave praise to his Finnish netminder following Saturday's shootout victory.  ""He's played very well, the team play has been better and his play has been better,"" Ruff said. ""He's really made key saves. You look at that overtime save he made for us, that allowed us to get the extra point."" Another key to the Sabres' recent success has been their special teams play. After failing to score on their first 22 power-play opportunities to start the season, Buffalo is 7 for 23 on the man advantage over their past seven games. A win on Monday would give the Sabres their first four-game winning streak in 21 months. At the other end of the spectrum, the Canadiens fell to the Toronto Maple Leafs 4-1 on Saturday night, en route to their sixth consecutive loss (0-5-1). One bright spot for the Canadiens has been the play of veteran winger Brendan Gallagher. The 32-year-old scored the Canadiens' lone goal on Saturday, giving him seven on the season, and extended his goal-scoring streak to three games. The 2010 fifth-round pick now ranks 19th all-time in the Canadiens' goal-scoring ranks with 225 career tallies. Canadiens' top scorers Cole Caufield and captain Nick Suzuki have both been held off the scoresheet in each of the past four contests. ""Some of us, myself included, are struggling to produce and find the back of the net,"" Suzuki told reporters after his team's most recent loss. ""I expect better from myself, I'm sure the other guys (do) as well. We need our whole lineup to produce."" Along with their lack of goal scoring, the Canadiens have struggled to keep the puck out of their net. They have allowed 29 goals over the past six losses and scored just 12. The Canadiens recent string of losses seems to be taking a toll on the young squad.  ""It's not great right now. But we're still trying to be positive right now,"" forward Josh Anderson said of the team's feelings. ""Trying to still find our swagger and do the right things. Once we find one, we'll be fine."" The Canadiens enter the matchup in last place in the Eastern Conference and have lost the past two games against the Sabres. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Harlan blasted the officiating late Saturday after the Utes lost to rival BYU, 22-21, on Utah's home field. ""This game was absolutely stolen from us,"" Harlan said. ""We were excited about being in the Big 12, but tonight I am not. We won this game. Someone else stole it from us. Very disappointed."" The Utes, accustomed to being in the mix atop the Pac-12 standings, are struggling in their first year in the Big 12 at 4-5 overall, 1-5 in the conference. Utah clung to a 21-19 led for most of the fourth quarter after a BYU touchdown at the 12:35 mark of the final frame. And twice late in the quarter, the Utes looked as if they were headed to the win. While Harlan didn't specify a call that riled him in particular, it likely occurred in the final two minutes. With 1:56 left, BYU took possession on its 9-yard line, and quarterback Jake Retzlaff fired three straight incomplete passes. The Cougars called a timeout, and on the ensuing fourth-and-10 play, Retzlaff was sacked for a loss that put the ball on the BYU 1-yard-line with about 90 seconds to go. But a holding penalty called on Utah cornerback Zemaiah Vaughn gave BYU new life and the ball at its 19. Retzlaff took advantage, completing passes of 30 yards and 12 yards, and running back Hinckley Ropati's 14-yard run took the ball to the Utah 25 with 1:07 on the clock. A false start penalty on BYU sent the ball back to the Utah 30, and the Cougars spent the next three plays positioning the ball and running down the clock to give Will Ferrin a 44-yard field-goal attempt. which he hit with just three seconds left. ""I will talk to the commissioner. This was not fair to our team,"" Harlan said. ""I'm disgusted by the professionalism of the officiating crew tonight."" Utah coach Kyle Whittingham was angry with officials on the field but let his boss address the officiating postgame. ""Couldn't get that last stop when we needed it, unfortunately,"" Whittingham said. ""That's kind of been the story for several games."" BYU coach Kalani Sitake said refereeing comes with the territory. ""Whatever decision the refs make, I don't think they're trying to get it wrong, so that's just part of the game,"" BYU coach Kalani Sitake said. ""The refs are part of the game. We were able to capitalize on that."" With the win, which came before the largest crowd (54,383) ever at Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City, No. 9 BYU moved to 9-0, 6-0 in the conference, to stay firmly in the mix for a College Football Playoff berth.

Miami’s fall from the fast-thinning ranks of the unbeaten felt like it had been coming for a while. The Hurricanes needed furious rallies in consecutive weeks to beat Virginia Tech and Cal, teams currently with 5-5 and 5-4 overall records. Outgunning Louisville in a 52-45 shootout marked Miami’s third straight game winning a one-score contest. While beating Louisville added an important Top 25 victory to the Hurricanes’ resume, their string of close calls made it clear that a loss in a one-score Atlantic Coast Conference game was probably inevitable. The 28-23 setback to Georgia Tech on Saturday was predictable enough that the playoff selection committee likely had a contingency plan for the ACC pecking order. In Tuesday’s initial reveal, SMU was the next-most highly ranked ACC team. At No. 13, despite sporting two Top 25 wins over Louisville and Pitt, the Mustangs were arguably the most egregiously underranked team in the standings. SMU will likely move into the top 12 by virtue of being the only undefeated ACC team in conference play, thus securing the conference's automatic bid. But where will it be slotted? The Mustangs were on a bye in Week 11, but in some ways, they lost as much as Miami did: Pitt’s 24-19 loss to Virginia likely removes a Top 25 win from SMU’s resume. For SMU to overtake Miami, there needs to be a nine-spot swing. With SMU idle, one of its signature wins losing value, and Boise State winning after being ranked one spot ahead of the Mustangs, the room for Rhett Lashlee’s squad to make a significant jump is limited. If anything other than Miami's loss most benefited SMU’s case, it could have been BYU’s loss to rival Utah in the nightcap. BYU defeated SMU earlier in the season, giving the Mustangs a quality loss. As long as the Cougars remained undefeated, even with the committee’s overall lack of enthusiasm for the Big 12, BYU would be a glass ceiling for SMU. Utah’s 21-19 win provided a fitting punctuation to an upset-filled Week 11 and likely relegated the Big 12 to fifth place among the five automatic qualifiers in the Playoff field. That group—which, through this week, had remained steady with Oregon in the Big Ten and Boise State—was otherwise shaken up by Saturday’s results. The SEC now has three teams with one loss in conference play, and Georgia isn’t one of them. The Bulldogs' placement in Tuesday’s rankings promises to be the most controversial insight into the committee’s strategy, regardless of where Georgia ranks. The Bulldogs beat Texas head-to-head and were rewarded last week by ranking ahead of the Longhorns. That made sense. Following that same logic, Georgia should now fall behind Alabama and Ole Miss in the SEC pecking order, which means the Bulldogs could fall out of the top 12 altogether. Texas and Tennessee remain firmly in the field, both 8-1 overall. Alabama, already in last week’s rankings, now has the same record as Georgia and the head-to-head advantage, which should place the Crimson Tide ahead of the Bulldogs. The same logic applies to Ole Miss, which was on the outside looking in on Nov. 5. Head-to-head results must mean something, which means Georgia should be out of the bracket for now. That could change when the Bulldogs face Tennessee in Week 12. In the meantime, sit with the reality that the heavy preseason favorite to steamroll its way back to the national championship could be eliminated from the field altogether by Nov. 16.

Here are three of our best picks for Sunday: Ever since it dropped back-to-back games bridging September and October, Buffalo has been nearly unstoppable. The Bills are riding a four-game winning streak and have averaged 29.5 points during that span, most recently hanging 30 on the Miami Dolphins in a three-point victory last Sunday. Meanwhile, turning to Joe Flacco under center didn’t pay off for Indianapolis last weekend, as the veteran signal-caller threw for only 179 yards and was picked off once in a 21-13 setback against the Minnesota Vikings. One offense is clicking, the other is in disarray, but oddsmakers seemingly have faith in the Colts’ ability to keep things close at home. Indianapolis is 3-1 at Lucas Oil Stadium this season, and it would be perfect there had it not been for a 29-27 loss to the Houston Texans in Week 1. But the Colts faithful will only be able to do so much on Sunday. With dual-threat quarterback Josh Allen and running backs James Cook and Ray Davis, a budding offensive weapon, Buffalo should have no problem barreling through an Indianapolis defense that allows the second-most rushing yards per game in the NFL (149.8).

Kelce has racked up 24 receptions (on 28 targets) for 190 yards and a touchdown over his past two games after catching 28 passes for 245 yards and no scores in his first six contests of the campaign. Still, Kelce finding the end zone just once by this point in the season is just plain wrong. He has yet to haul in a TD at home, but we think that changes this week.

San Francisco star running back Christian McCaffrey is scheduled to make his season debut after working through Achilles tendinitis. He rushed for 1,459 yards and 14 touchdowns during the 2023 season, also grabbing 67 receptions for 564 yards and an additional seven scores. When healthy, McCaffrey is the most dangerous back in the league. However, we aren’t under the impression that he is at 100 percent heading into the meeting with Tampa Bay. After all, this is a guy who was supposedly in line to play in the 49ers’ season opener. Not only did that not happen, but he also went on to miss the next eight weeks.

After opening with the franchise's first 3-0 start since 2010-11, the Lakers went 1-4 on a five-game road trip. A return home on Friday to face Philadelphia -- and a 116-106 win -- helped Los Angeles ro avoid a three-game skid. Anthony Davis scored 31 points to continue his torrid start to the season.  Davis has scored at least 31 points in six of his eight appearances and grabbed at least 11 rebounds in four outings. His four blocked shots versus the 76ers marked a season high. LeBron James recorded his 114th career triple-double on Friday with 21 points, 13 assists and 12 rebounds. Austin Reaves added 20 points for the Lakers, who improved to 3-1 when he scores at least that many this season.  Another two Lakers players who factored into Friday's win were Cam Reddish and D'Angelo Russell. Los Angeles coach JJ Redick offered praise for the duo after Russell scored 18 points off the bench and Reddish fulfilled a variety of needs.  ""Both those guys starred in the roles they had tonight,"" Redick said. ""Cam took one shot in 27 minutes but had a huge impact on the game defensively in the first half. I know we had three smash-screen assists coming out of set plays; Cam had two of them.  ""That's sacrifice. That's unselfishness.""  Russell, meanwhile, is one of five Lakers scorers averaging in double figures with 12.7 points per game. He joins Davis (32.4), James (23.7), Reaves (17.8) and Rui Hachimura (13.0). Hachimura scored nine points on Friday in his return to the lineup after missing the 131-114 loss at Memphis on Wednesday.  Toronto will play the fourth contest of a five-game road trip on Sunday. This swing has not been kind to the Raptors, as Saturday's 105-103 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers dropped Toronto to 0-3 in this stretch.  On Saturday, Ochai Agbaji and Immanuel Quickley each scored 21 points, Gradey Dick had 15 and Chris Boucher added 14 points off the bench. However, Toronto fell 15 points shy of its per-game scoring average through the previous nine games.  RJ Barrett, who came into Saturday's contest averaging a team-high 25.7 points per game, finished with only 13 versus the Clippers. Getting Barrett going, and pushing the tempo as a team, figure to be top priorities for Toronto on Sunday.  Raptors coach Darko Rajakovic has emphasized a fast pace predicated on ball movement. Toronto went into Los Angeles averaging almost 31 assists per game, most in the NBA.  ""It's the right way to play basketball,"" Rajakovic said on Saturday. ""We're a very young team and it's creating habits now of unselfishness, playing together and playing for each other  ""There are so many examples of great teams that play that way,"" he added, citing Nikola Jokic and his Denver Nuggets, the recent NBA Finals-winning Golden State teams, and the San Antonio Spurs championship teams of previous decades. ""It's not anything new.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The Ducks, who have scored a league-low 27 goals in 13 games (4-7-2), bring a four-game losing streak into the contest. They have dropped the first three outings of a six-game homestand, getting outscored 14-5 in the process.  Anaheim comes in off a 5-2 loss to Minnesota on Friday, falling behind 3-0 in the first period against a Wild team that was playing the second half of a back-to-back set. Trevor Zegras backhanded a penalty shot try over the net in the second period and the Ducks finished 0-for-6 on the power play, managing just two shots on goal and failing to score during a key four-minute double-minor high-sticking penalty on defenseman Zach Bogosian midway through the third period while trailing 3-1.  ""I think any team, no matter how good you are or how old you are or how young you are, when you're not scoring, it's like the balloon is getting bigger and bigger,"" Cronin said. ""We're just waiting for it to pop in a good way and get some goals.""  Said Anaheim defenseman Brian Dumoulin: ""When goals aren't going in, obviously the guys can get frustrated and your game can slip a little because you cheat a little bit to the offensive side. I think we've just got to know that if we defend hard, we'll get chances off of it.""  Robby Fabbri scored his 100th career NHL goal in the loss and Mason McTavish also tallied for the Ducks, who outshot Minnesota, 35-31.  ""When you look back at it, we could have probably scored six goals,"" Cronin said. ""(But) would-have, could-have, should-have doesn't mean anything at the end of the game.""  Columbus also brings a four-game losing streak (0-3-1) into the contest and will be playing the second game of a back-to-back that began with a 5-2 loss at the Los Angeles Kings on Saturday night.  The Blue Jackets led 1-0 after one period on Dmitri Voronkov's tip-in goal but the Kings rebounded to take a 2-1 advantage in the second on goals by defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov and Warren Foegele. Trevor Moore then scored what proved to be the game-winning goal with his team shorthanded early in the third period.  ""Honestly I thought we played a solid game but at the end of the day we want to come out with a win,"" said forward Justin Danforth, who had two assists. ""We've got to find a way to win games. That's what playoff teams do. So we have to get back on track, get a little confidence back, and a big game tomorrow.""  Columbus coach Dean Evason said his team must cut down on the mistakes that led directly to the first three goals by the Kings.  ""The first goal we turn it over,"" Evason said. ""The second goal we make a huge mistake. The third goal we turn it over. That's three goals. We've got a 1-0 lead. In key areas of the ice we have to make the right reads or clearly not turn the puck over (and) give teams momentum to come back after us. And we did that here tonight.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise","Jack Hughes, Devils get first look at Sharks' Macklin Celebrini",https://deadspin.com/jack-hughes-devils-get-first-look-at-sharks-macklin-celebrini/,2024-11-10T12:23:12.218Z,"Jack Hughes is on the verge of reaching a notable milestone in his young career, and the New Jersey Devils are constantly finding the back of the net","Jack Hughes is on the verge of reaching a notable milestone in his young career, and the New Jersey Devils are constantly finding the back of the net lately. Hughes' current hot streak has the 2019 top overall pick one shy of 300 career points. Hughes will look to add to that total as the Devils attempt to earn their fourth win in a row when they oppose top overall 2024 pick Macklin Celebrini and the San Jose Sharks in Newark, N.J. Hughes is coming off his second straight three-point showing and heads into his first encounter with Celebrini with five goals in his past six games. He scored two goals in Saturday's 4-3 overtime over the host New York Islanders. The Devils star scored a power-play goal in the second period and then converted a breakaway 2:35 into overtime. He also had the primary assist on the tying goal by Stefan Noesen with 50 seconds left in regulation. ""Those are the moments you play hockey for,"" Devils captain Nico Hischier said. ""I think it's an emotional, tight game; I think we played a well enough game to win that game, and getting rewarded for it makes it that much better."" The latest big showing by Hughes gave New Jersey three straight wins and five wins in its last six games (5-1-0). Since allowing 23 goals in a four-game skid (0-2-2) from Oct. 19-25, the Devils have outscored foes 24-11 in the past six games, a stretch that includes shutout road wins versus the Vancouver Canucks and Edmonton Oilers. Dawson Mercer also scored a goal and defenseman Dougie Hamilton notched three assists on Saturday for the Devils, who allowed two goals in a span of 1:56 before overcoming a 3-1 deficit. Celebrini will be playing in his fourth game and first on the road because of a preseason hip injury that cost him the first 12 games. The Sharks are playing better of late by going 4-2-0 in their past six contests following a season-opening nine-game skid (0-7-2). San Jose began its marginal improvement with a 5-4 overtime win at the Utah Hockey Club on Oct. 28 before getting home wins over the Los Angeles Kings and Chicago Blackhawks. After splitting one-goal games versus Vancouver and the Columbus Blue Jackets, the 18-year-old had his first career two-goal game Thursday in a 5-2 home loss to the Minnesota Wild. Celebrini scored twice on even strength as the Sharks were 0-for-3 on the power play and are 2-for-20 since their only game with multiple power-play goals on Oct. 24. The Sharks also head into their opener of a four-game trip against Metropolitan Division opponents after failing to record more than 29 shots on goal in their previous five contests. ""We play some great teams, so it'll be a really good test,"" Celebrini said Thursday. ""We've shown we can beat some really good teams, and we're a really good team ourselves when we play like it. So, this will be a great test, especially on the road."" The Sharks may revert to their alignment from Thursday when William Eklund was dropped to the fourth line by coach Ryan Warsofsky. Eklund finished with 16 goals in his first full season in 2023-24 but has two goals in his first 14 games in 2024-25. ""We're going to continue to work with him, help him, and get through this,"" Warsofsky said. One of San Jose's 19 wins last season occurred on their visit to New Jersey. Eklund scored a goal in the Sharks' 6-3 win over the Devils on Dec. 1. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Jamal Haynes ran for 83 yards and a touchdown as the Yellow Jackets (6-4, 4-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) snapped a two-game skid. The Hurricanes (9-1, 5-1) lost for the first time despite Cam Ward's 348 passing yards and three touchdowns. Jacolby George led Miami with seven receptions for 88 yards. Ward fumbled on the Hurricanes' final possession with under two minutes remaining. Miami closed within 28-23 when Ward connected with Xavier Restrepo for a 38-yard TD with 6:07 left. Following a Georgia Tech punt, Ward was strip-sacked by Romello Height, and Jordan van den Berg recovered the fumble on the Hurricanes 17-yard line to ice the win. No. 1 Oregon 39, Maryland 18 Dillon Gabriel set an NCAA record with his 179th career touchdown and the Ducks shook off a slow start to defeat the Terrapins in Eugene, Ore. Gabriel was 23-for-34 passing for 183 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions for the Ducks (10-0, 7-0 Big Ten), who led 14-10 before scoring 25 of the game's final 33 points. Gabriel's record-setting touchdown came on a 3-yard toss to left tackle Gernorris Wilson that put Oregon up 29-10 midway through the third quarter. Gabriel surpassed former Houston quarterback Case Keenum, who accounted for 155 passing touchdowns and 23 rushing scores for the Cougars from 2007-11. For the Terrapins, (4-5, 1-5), who have lost two straight games, Billy Edwards Jr. completed 22 of 44 passes for 206 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions. No. 2 Ohio State 45, Purdue 0 Will Howard threw for three touchdowns and Jeremiah Smith set a pair of team records as the Buckeyes rolled past the Boilermakers in Columbus, Ohio. Smith had a 17-yard touchdown catch late in the first half to up the lead to 21-0 for the Buckeyes (8-1, 5-1 Big Ten). The score was Smith's ninth to pass Cris Carter's Ohio State freshman record for TD catches set in 1984. Smith needed three receptions to break Carter's first-year mark of 41, and he surpassed that in the first half with six catches for 87 yards. Howard was 21-of-26 passing for 260 yards, and TreVeyon Henderson ran for 85 yards on six carries. Purdue (1-8, 0-6) has lost eight straight games for its longest single-season losing streak since dropping 10 in a row in 2013. No. 16 Ole Miss 28, No. 3 Georgia 10 Behind Jaxson Dart, Caden Davis and an impressive defense, the Rebels toppled the Bulldogs in Oxford, Miss., denting the visitors' national title hopes in the process. Dart completed 13 of 22 passes for 199 yards, a touchdown and an interception and ran for a team-high 50 yards, while Davis made all five of his field-goal attempts as the Rebels (8-2, 4-2 Southeastern Conference) won their third straight game. Carson Beck went 20-for-31 passing for 186 yards but threw an interception and fumbled twice for the Bulldogs (7-2, 5-2), who had their four-game winning streak snapped.

No. 5 Texas 49, Florida 17 Quinn Ewers passed for 333 yards and a career-high five touchdowns over the game's first 33 minutes as the Longhorns romped past the Gators at Austin, Texas. The Longhorns (8-1, 4-1 SEC) flexed their talent and speed throughout the win as the teams played as SEC opponents for the first time. Ewers finished 19-of-27 passing without an interception, Jerrick Gibson rushed for 100 yards and a TD and Matthew Golden had two TD receptions. Aidan Warner, the Gators' walk-on, third-string quarterback, passed for 132 yards and was intercepted twice. Ja'Kobi Jackson rushed for 116 yards and a score while Jaden Baugh added 88 rushing yards and a TD for Florida (4-5, 2-4). No. 6 Penn State 35, Washington 6 Tight end Tyler Warren made a game-high eight receptions and rushed for two touchdowns as the Nittany Lions trounced the Huskies in State College, Pa. Drew Allar completed 20 of 28 passes for 220 yards and a touchdown for Penn State (8-1, 5-1 Big Ten), which could move up in the College Football Playoff rankings after losses by No. 3 Georgia and No. 4 Miami. Teammate Kaytron Allen rushed 20 times for 98 yards and a score. Quarterback Will Rogers III was 10-of-13 passing for 59 yards and one interception in the first half before being replaced by Demond Williams Jr., who was 6-of-10 passing for 60 yards and rushed for a team-high 38 yards on 10 attempts for Washington (5-5, 3-4).

Iamaleava completed 8 of 13 passes for 174 yards but didn't return for the second half after sustaining an upper-body injury late in the second quarter. However, the Volunteers (8-1, 5-1 SEC) led 20-7 at the half and weren't truly threatened by the Bulldogs (2-8, 0-6). Sampson collected 149 yards on 30 carries, going over the 1,000-yard mark for the first time in his career. Tennessee rolled up 452 total yards, split almost equally between rushing (240) and passing (212). Michael Van Buren Jr. had a rough night for Mississippi State, hitting just 10 of 26 passes for 92 yards with an interception. No. 8 Indiana 20, Michigan 15 Kurtis Rourke went 17-for-28 passing for 206 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Hoosiers to a win over the Wolverines in Bloomington, Ind. Indiana (10-0, 7-0 Big Ten) has now won 10 games in a season for the first time in school history and kept its hopes for a conference title and CFP berth alive. Clinging to a 17-15 edge in the fourth quarter, Indiana took a 20-15 lead with 2:34 remaining on a 41-yard field goal by Nicolas Radicic. On the ensuing possession, Michigan (5-5, 3-4) failed to convert a fourth-and-10 after a pass from Davis Warren to Peyton O'Leary came up just short of the marker. Indiana took over on the Michigan 42-yard line with 1:35 left and ran out the clock. No. 9 BYU 22, Utah 21 Will Ferrin kicked three field goals, the final one from 44 yards out with three seconds left, as the Cougars rallied to beat the Utes in Salt Lake City. Jake Retzlaff threw for 219 yards to lead the Cougars. LJ Martin added 68 rushing yards. BYU (9-0, 6-0 Big 12) did not score an offensive touchdown until 12:35 remained in the fourth quarter. Utah (4-5, 1-5) has lost five straight games for the first time since 2013. Brandon Rose threw for 112 yards and two touchdowns and added 55 yards on the ground in his first career start for the Utes. No. 10 Notre Dame 52, Florida State 3 Riley Leonard passed for one touchdown and rushed for two more as the Fighting Irish crushed the Seminoles in South Bend, Ind. Jadarian Price added 95 rushing yards and a touchdown for Notre Dame (8-1), which won its seventh game in a row. Leonard completed 14 of 27 passes for 215 yards and a touchdown and carried the ball 11 times for 70 yards and two scores. Lawrance Toafili had 16 carries for 77 yards to lead the Seminoles (1-9), whose nightmare season continued with their sixth consecutive loss. Brock Glenn completed 5 of 18 passes for 52 yards and two interceptions, and Luke Kromenhoek completed 5 of 8 passes for 37 yards. No. 11 Alabama 42, No. 15 LSU 13 Jalen Milroe rushed for a career-high 185 yards and ran for four touchdowns as the Crimson Tide never trailed in a victory against the Tigers in Baton Rouge, La. Milroe, who also passed for 109 yards, matched his best single-game rushing TD total and surpassed his previous rushing-yardage high of 155, both of which came in a 42-28 victory against LSU last season. The Crimson Tide (7-2, 4-2 SEC) strengthened their CFP chances with their first conference road victory of the season. Garrett Nussmeier passed for 239 yards and a touchdown, threw two interceptions and lost a fumble as the Tigers (6-3, 3-2) suffered a major blow to their already slim playoff hopes. Alabama outgained LSU 420-343 overall and held a 311-104 advantage in rushing yards. No. 12 Boise State 28, Nevada 21 Ashton Jeanty rushed for 209 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Broncos to a victory over the visiting Wolf Pack in a Mountain West Conference matchup.

Allison has his name littered throughout the record books, ranking fourth all time in NASCAR premier series wins (85), second in top-five finishes (336) and 14th in starts (718).  Those were among the accomplishments that landed Allison in NASCAR's second Hall of Fame Class back in 2011. He was also a three-time Daytona 500 winner, four-time Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway winner and three-time Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway winner.  During his 1988 victory at Daytona, Allison had to hold off his son, Davey, to take the checkered flag.  ""Bobby Allison personified the term ‘racer.' Though he is best known as one of the winningest drivers in NASCAR Cup Series history, his impact on the sport extends far beyond the record books,"" NASCAR chairman and CEO Jim France said in a statement. ""As a driver, he won races and championships across several NASCAR divisions. But as the leader of the famous ‘Alabama Gang,' Bobby connected with fans in a profound manner.  ""In the most significant ways, he gave his all to our sport. On behalf of the France family and all of NASCAR, I offer my deepest condolences to Bobby's family, friends and fans on the loss of a NASCAR giant."" Named one of NASCAR's 75 Greatest Drivers back in 2023, Allison put together a career that started in 1961 and ended midway through the 1988 campaign.  In addition to everything he was able to accomplish in the Cup Series, Allison won twice in what is now known as the Xfinity Series and took home an International Race of Champions title in 1980. He was named NASCAR's most popular driver on six occasions.  Allison and his younger brother Donnie teamed up with modified racer Red Farmer to take over the short-track racing scene down in the Hueytown, Ala., area during the late 1950s, leading to the inception of the original ""Alabama Gang.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

""For the last month, I have actively participated in and respected the confidentiality of an ongoing school inquiry,"" Golden wrote on X. ""I have recently engaged (attorney) Ken Turkel to advise me on my ability to bring defamation claims while this confidential investigation is ongoing. My family and I appreciate the support we have received and remain confident the university will continue its efforts to finish its review promptly."" The Alligator, citing Title IX documents filed on Sept. 27, said Golden has been accused of potential violations of the school's Gender Equity Policy. They include acts of sexual exploitation, sexual harassment and the stalking of Florida students over the past year. Per the report, Golden sent ""photos and videos of his genitalia while traveling for UF,"" used social media to make sexual advances and request sexual favors, and stalked women. He is alleged to have taken photos of women, then send the pictures to them, and also of making visits to places where he knew he could find those same women. The Alligator interviewed two women who said they had complained about Golden, and they corroborated the Title IX documents. They said Golden had followed, then unfollowed, numerous women on social media to avoid suspicion, and one of them said his reach to women was vast. He told many women they were ""his drug"" or ""his good luck charm"" before games, she said. ""He just had this manipulation tactic over everyone,"" the woman told The Alligator.

""I think Hawaii is more good for me, more comfortable, and then when I ... came on site, everything is new and then grass and read is very hard for me,"" Kim said. ""But getting better from now, more easier.""  Bogeys at the par-4 second and par-3 ninth on Saturday ended up costing Guseva. She did have five birdies, including a pair at Nos. 11 and 13, but she was unable to become the first Russian golfer to win on the LPGA Tour.  ""Obviously congrats to A Lim for a great game. I really did my best out there. I never gave up. Every hole like I gave just my 100 percent and more than that,"" Guseva said. ""I enjoyed it out there. I enjoy playing golf. I enjoy the crowds.""  Auston Kim birdied four of her first six holes before slowing down, as she recorded just one more birdie the rest of the way during a bogey-free round. She shared low-round honors with Japan's Nasa Hataoka, who also posted a 5-under 67.  Auston Kim landed in third, three strokes behind A Lim Kim, while Hataoka came in fourth, four shots off the lead.  ""It got really tough in the back. I got off to a really hot start. Made a lot of good shots and really good putts on the front nine. Putter got a little cold after the ninth hole,"" Auston Kim said. ""Just kept telling myself, ‘Like you're hitting really good shots. You're visualizing while you're feeling everything very well. Just keep giving yourself chances.'"" Ryann O'Toole (70) and Yuri Yoshida of Japan (69) tied for fifth.  South Korean Jin Young Ko (70) came in seventh, Lindy Duncan (68) ended up in eighth and Hyo Joo Kim of South Korea (69) and Angel Yin (69) were T9.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

""I was playing within the offense and being aggressive, taking what they gave me,"" he said. ""I was going with moving the ball, finding great shots and taking them."" Mgbako and the No. 17 Hoosiers will try to make it 2-0 Sunday when they welcome Eastern Illinois for another nonconference clash in Bloomington, Ind. Mgbako nailed 13 of 17 shots from the field, including 4 of 5 from the 3-point line, and also chipped in nine rebounds. His performance stood out on a night where Indiana never trailed and wasn't pushed in the second half, but it didn't play at the level coach Mike Woodson hoped it would. ""Offensively, we came out with great intentions,"" Woodson said. ""The ball moved early, but then we got stale in terms of moving and making the extra pass. We've been having some good practices. ... I've got to get us better in that area."" Woodson wasn't happy that his team committed 16 turnovers against an opponent that probably won't bring the same level of ball pressure they'll see in the Big Ten Conference. Washington State transfer Myles Rice had 11 points in his first game but also coughed up five turnovers. Woodson said most of the turnovers were correctible, but he added that Rice must be more patient and develop into more of a true point guard. Rice played as more of a combo guard last year when he helped the Cougars reach the second round of the NCAA Tournament. One solid aspect of the Hoosiers' opener was their defense. They allowed the Cougars to make only 35.2 percent of their shots, including 5 of 26 on 3-pointers, and earned a 43-34 advantage on the boards. Meanwhile, Eastern Illinois (1-1) followed up a season-opening blowout loss at Illinois by routing Division III opponent Earlham (Ind.) 97-61 on Wednesday. Six players scored in double figures for the Panthers, led by Artese Stapleton's 17 points, as they shot 52.2 percent from the field. Eastern Illinois is coming off a 14-18 season and was picked for a middle-of-the-pack finish in the Ohio Valley Conference. Panthers coach Marty Simmons knows all about the atmosphere his team will face in Assembly Hall. He played for the late Bob Knight before transferring to Evansville and playing for former Knight assistant Jim Crews. Simmons, in his fourth season at Eastern Illinois, says this will be his best group of players since he took the helm. ""I think we're moving in the right direction,"" he said. ""We made a good step last year. We have our best returning class. I think this team has a chance to be pretty good."" Simmons said the key to his team will be the progress it makes defensively. Opponents made 44 percent of their shots against the Panthers last season. ""We have to be more consistent,"" he said. Indiana has won both meetings in the series, earning an 88-49 win nine years ago in their last matchup. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Nick Davidson added 14 points and nine rebounds and Tre Coleman finished with 10 points for Nevada (2-0). Washington's Tyree Ihenacho scored 13 of his team-high 15 points in the first half. Tyler Harris was the only other double-figure scorer for Washington (1-1) with 10 points. The Wolf Pack pulled away with a 10-0 run after 3:30 remained in the game. Eight of the points were scored at the free-throw line with Sanders making four and Davidson three. Nevada outscored Washington at the free-throw line by nine points, making 17 of 25 while the Huskies were 8-of-13. Washington missed seven straight field-goal attempts when Nevada went on its late game-clinching run.

The Memphis star forward put up a season-high 39 points in Friday's victory over the Washington Wizards and seeks another strong effort when the Grizzlies visit the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday night. Jackson made five 3-pointers -- also a season-best -- and controlled things in the interior as Memphis routed the visiting Wizards 128-104.  ""He had the opportunity to be the primary playmaker, diversify his game and a couple pick-and-rolls were snuck in there,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said of Jackson. ""... He was able to get the rim at will and obviously shot the ball really well. ""It was great to see him get that opportunity and take advantage of it."" Jackson was in the go-to role with point guard Ja Morant out due to a right hip injury and shooting guard Desmond Bane (oblique) still sidelined.  Morant was injured in a fall during Wednesday's 131-114 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. The Grizzlies announced Saturday that he is week-to-week after suffering a posterior hip subluxation (without dislocation) and multiple Grade 1 pelvic muscle strains. As a result, Memphis will again rely on Jackson, who is averaging 22 points and shooting 55.9 percent from the field in eight games. After missing the first two games due a hamstring strain sustained during the team's first practice, the 25-year-old Jackson has played well. Friday's effort was his second 30-point outing and marked the third time in the past four games in which he scored 20 or more points. Last season, Jackson averaged 22.5 points in 66 games. Scotty Pippen Jr. also contributed on Friday with his first career triple-double. He had 11 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds while starting against Washington. ""Offensively, he's moving the ball,"" Jenkins said. ""And he's getting into the paint, which is a huge priority for us ... This kid is taking care of his body, he's doing the work, he's watching film. When he can have that two-way impact, that's huge for us."" The Grizzlies have won four of their past five games with the wins coming by 23, 17, 17 and 24 points. Memphis opens a three-game trip with a stop in Portland as the Trail Blazers begin a four-game homestand. Portland is coming off a 127-102 road loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves during a contest in which big man Robert Williams III returned to the court after missing 12-plus months due to a major knee injury. Williams scored 13 points in 17 minutes off the bench, making 4 of his 5 field-goal attempts and all four of his free throws. ""I felt good, man,"" Williams said. ""Just trying to get the defensive spirit back with the team, you know, be that leader. Obviously, we wanted to come out with a win, we didn't. But obviously it feels great to be back on the court."" Williams' return gives the Trail Blazers a deep post trio that includes veteran starter Deandre Ayton and first-round pick Donovan Clingan. Portland also has more versatility at guard with Shaedon Sharpe back from a shoulder injury. He had just six points on 2-of-8 shooting in 21 minutes against Minnesota in his second game of the season. In his first, Sharpe had 13 points on 6-of-9 shooting in 20 minutes during a 118-105 road loss against the San Antonio Spurs on Thursday. ""Just trying to get guys in there and you want to get them in and there's also minutes restrictions,"" Portland coach Chauncey Billups said. ""There's all kind of things that you have to deal with that make it tough to kind of get a rhythm."" The Trail Blazers went 3-1 against Memphis last season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Stewart-Haas Racing's Riley Herbst's No. 98 Ford passed Allgaier's No. 7 JR Motorsports Chevrolet for the NASCAR Xfinity Series Championship Race win on the last lap of double-overtime for his second win of the season and joined the new series champ Allgaier in twin celebratory burnouts on the front stretch of the mile-track.   ""I said all weekend, I don't know what the plan is, but He has a reason for everything and tonight is true of that, this is mind-blowing, it really is,"" said Allgaier, his voice already hoarse and strained from screaming in happiness, but the smile unshakable as his young daughters came in for a hug for dad.   ""This team never gave up. (Crew chief) Jim Pohlman and his leadership skills are second to none. He told me all weekend that we were going to have a chance and we tried to give it away every way we could.""   It was an emotional outcome for the 38-year old Allgaier, who joked that he was just trying to make the race exciting for the fans. He has qualified for the Championship 4 seven times, finishing runner-up twice, including last year.   The obstacles Allgaier faced happened well before the race's green flag.  His primary car was destroyed in a crash four laps into Friday's opening practice session. In a backup car Saturday night, Allgaier started last in the 38th car field but had moved into the top 10 by lap 26. He was then penalized twice - first for a re-start violation and then for speeding - dropping him to 35th on-track and a lap down on Lap 107 of the scheduled 200-lapper. Allgaier then crept into the Top 10 worked his way forward - moving from sixth place to second on the first overtime restart. He started on the front row of the second overtime restart, but was passed on the final lap by Herbst for the race win. Allgaier's second place finish was still good enough to land the championship.   It marked the third career win for the 25-year old Las Vegas native Herbst, who crossed the line .247-second ahead of Allgaier and led 167 of the 213 laps.   ""I knew we were going to have a fast race car, these guys have been working on this race car and I knew we were going to be really really fast,"" said Herbst, whose SHR team is closing at the conclusion of the season.  ""It's been a really tough week at the shop, really emotional time. I'm forever grateful to every man and woman at Stewart-Haas Racing. They gave me a really fast car today and I can't thank everyone enough."" It was actually fellow championship contender - reigning champ Cole Custer - who mounted the most consistent challenge to Herbst. He ran up front for most of the race, just off the pace of his SHR teammate and ultimately finished eighth in the No. 00 SHR Ford - his effort answered last year's title with a runner-up in this year's championship standings.   The other two championship contenders, Kaulig Racing's A.J. Allmendinger and Richard Childress Racing's Austin Hill finished ninth and 10th, respectively.

In all, 11 players recorded a point for the Kings, with Warren Foegele notching a goal and an assist and Anze Kopitar and Adrian Kempe collecting a pair of assists apiece. Columbus jumped out to a 1-0 lead on Dmitri Voronkov's goal with 6:34 left in the opening period. The second-year pro, who scored 34 points in 75 games last season, notched his first point of the season, redirecting Justin Danforth's centering pass past Kings goalie David Rittich (24 saves).   The Kings, though, would take over in the second period, scoring twice in a two-minute span.   Vladislav Gavrikov tied it against his former team with a snap shot through traffic 4:16 into the second. The defenseman's second of the season and second in as many games came off assists by Adrian Kempe and Anze Kopitar.   Foegele gave Los Angeles a 2-1 lead at 6:12 of the second as the hosts cashed in on a turnover in the neutral zone. Akil Thomas and Samuel Helenius earned their first assists of the season on the winger's sixth goal of the campaign.   Trevor Moore's short-handed goal just 30 seconds into the third, his second tally of the season, extended the Kings' lead to 3-1. Columbus responded on Ivan Provorov's first goal of the season 19 seconds later on the power play.   That was as close as the Blue Jackets would get as they lost their fourth straight (0-3-1). Alex Laferriere's ninth goal of the season came with 12:55 remaining as he deflected Joel Edmundson's shot past Columbus goalie Elvis Merzlikins (18 saves). Foegele earned the secondary assist.

The Minnesota Wild happily cannot relate. Minnesota enters its visit to Chicago on Sunday with five wins in six games, including consecutive 5-2 victories at San Jose and Anaheim and two other efforts of five goals. It's all helped add up to a 10-2-2 start, the best in club history over 14 contests. ""We've taken it a game at a time, honestly,"" Minnesota forward Frederick Gaudreau said. ""I think if you do that, you get results and you can get addicted to that feeling of just going at it every single day and not focusing too far ahead."" Chicago returns home before a two-game Western swing, facing questions about consistency. After seemingly turning a corner during a 3-2 road trip bridging October and November, the Blackhawks sputtered Wednesday and Thursday, losing 4-1 to visiting Detroit and then 3-1 at Dallas. Chicago recorded just five shots on goal in the first period and fell behind the Stars 2-0 before Tyler Bertuzzi put the team on the board with a power-play goal midway through the third. ""We weren't ready to start tonight,"" Bertuzzi said. ""Obviously we made a push in the third, but it was too late. We needed to be ready to go tonight and play a full 60 and we came up short. ""We need to shoot more. Everyone. Whether it's the (defense) from the top or a forward getting in the slot, we can't just keep trying to make the cute plays. We've got to shoot it and get the rebounds."" Claiming control of the puck would help. Chicago won 16 of 56 faceoffs at Dallas, with Philipp Kurashev contributing five. ""When you start out without a puck, that's a hard thing,"" Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson said. ""We're chasing the game quite a bit."" Richardson is encouraged that Chicago seemingly has flipped the script on last season, when chatter about moral victories was common in the dressing room. ""We're just going to take this and put this intensity we had in the third period and bring it to the next game,"" he said. ""I've liked our character and our pushback after a game like this all year long, so I'm expecting that again from our players."" The Blackhawks will hope to slow Minnesota's moxie away from home. The Wild boast seven road victories, most in the NHL entering Saturday. Kirill Kaprizov starred in Minnesota's most recent road triumph, contributing two goals and an assist on Friday in Anaheim. He also recorded a three-point night in San Jose and carries to Chicago a streak of eight straight multipoint road games. ""He's driving our team. That's the biggest thing,"" Marcus Foligno said. ""You need your horses going. He's our star player. When he's going, the whole bench is going."" Gaudreau, who assisted on Foligno's goal against the Ducks, has two goals and six assists during a career-best, six-game point streak.

It was the second straight loss for the Panthers (7-2, 3-2 ACC), likely eliminating their chances to reach the College Football Playoff or ACC Championship Game.   The Cavaliers (5-4, 3-3) ended a three-game skid and moved closer to gaining bowl eligibility for the first time under third-year coach Tony Elliott.   Anthony Colandrea passed for 143 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions for Virginia.   Nate Yarnell had a touchdown pass and two interceptions for Pitt after taking over for starter Eli Holstein, who left with an apparent head injury in the third quarter. Desmond Reid paced the Panthers with 123 yards from scrimmage.   Pitt had a final chance to take the lead before Yarnell's pass was intercepted by Corey Thomas Jr. with 1:40 left.   Virginia opened the scoring in the second quarter with some trickery. Cavaliers receiver Suderian Harrison got the ball on a reverse and threw a 27-yard pass to Colandrea to the 1-yard line. Brown ran it in on the next snap for a 7-0 lead.   Later in the quarter, the Panthers put together a 12-play, 80-yard drive, capped by Daniel Carter's 1-yard run to tie the score with 4:48 remaining in the half.   An interception by Kyle Louis set up a 44-yard field goal by Ben Sauls to give Pitt its first lead at 10-7 with 1:59 left.   Sauls hit a 48-yarder with eight seconds left to give the Panthers a 13-7 lead at halftime.   Momentum shifted to Virginia in the third quarter. Holstein left the game after getting hit in the helmet by Virginia linebacker Trey McDonald, who was thrown out for targeting.   After Jonas Sanker blocked a 45-yard field goal attempt by Sauls, Colandrea put the Cavaliers in front 14-13 with a 24-yard touchdown pass to Brown.   Virginia got the ball back after Sanker intercepted Yarnell's pass. Four plays later, Kobe Pace's 3-yard touchdown run made it 21-13 with 3:34 left in the third.   Yarnell's 4-yard TD pass to Gavin Bartholomew cut the deficit to 21-19 with 10:32 to play. That's where the score remained after a holding penalty wiped out Bartholomew's two-point conversion catch.   The Cavaliers extended the lead to 24-19 on a 32-yard field goal by Will Bettridge to cap a 16-play, 60-yard drive that chewed up 8:26.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The Heisman Trophy candidate topped 200 yards for the fourth time this season and raised his season totals to 1,734 rushing yards and 23 touchdowns on the ground. He entered the day as the national leader in both categories. Maddux Madsen completed 9 of 20 passes for 119 yards, one touchdown and one interception for the Broncos (8-1, 5-0 MW), who won their seventh straight game. Matt Lauter had a touchdown catch as Boise State beat Nevada for the 18th time in the past 20 meetings. Jeanty became the fourth Boise State running back to top the 1,700-yard mark in a single season and finished the night second on the list. Jay Ajayi set the school record of 1,823 yards in 2014, while Ian Johnson (1,713 in 2006) and Jeremy McNichols (1,709 in 2016) also topped the mark. Brendon Lewis was 17-of-26 passing for 188 yards and one touchdown for Nevada (3-8, 0-5), which lost its fourth consecutive game. Jaden Smith caught a 36-yard touchdown pass with 2:19 left that kept the Wolf Pack in the game. But Jeanty's 17-yard run on the ensuing possession gave Boise State a first down. A short time later, Jeanty scampered for 10 yards and another first down to seal it. The score was tied at 14 at the break before the Broncos moved ahead to stay behind a dominating eight-play, 95-yard drive to start the third quarter. Jeanty went the final yard for the touchdown. Boise State took a 28-14 advantage on Jeanty's 2-yard run with 10:05 left in the contest. However, Nevada bounced back and was threatening to make it a one-score game when it faced fourth-and-goal from the Boise State 1-yard line. But Lewis and Sean Dollars botched the exchange and Jeremiah Earby of the Broncos recovered in the end zone for a touchback. Boise State jumped out to a 14-0 lead before the game was 11 minutes old. Jeanty's rushes moved the ball down the field on the Broncos' first possession, which ended with Madsen's 11-yard scoring pass to Lauter. With 4:12 left in the period, Jeanty powered through a Nevada defender on a 4-yard scoring run. Lewis got the Wolf Pack on the board with a dazzling 17-yard burst with 57 seconds left in the opening quarter. Nevada tied the game on a trick play with 6:14 left in the half. The ball was handed to Marcos Bellon. The receiver tossed a short pass to Caleb Ramseur, who broke two tackles en route to finishing off a 44-yard scoring play. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Young's touchdown capped off a wild finish, with four touchdowns between the teams in the final 3:18. The Tigers (7-2, 3-2 SEC) kept their College Football Playoff hopes alive while the Sooners' bowl hopes took a major hit. Oklahoma (5-5, 1-5) needs one more win in its final two games -- against Alabama and LSU -- to extend its bowl streak to 26 seasons. Missouri tied it on Theo Wease Jr.'s 10-yard touchdown catch from Drew Pyne with 1:03 left. It didn't take long for the Tigers to come up with another big play. Triston Newson hit Sooners quarterback Jackson Arnold in the backfield, knocking the ball free, and Young picked it up and returned it for the score. Not long before Wease's touchdown, it looked like the game had turned disastrous for the Tigers. Billy Bowman returned a fumble 43 yards for a touchdown with 2:00 left to put Oklahoma in front 23-16. But Pyne quickly directed an eight-play, 75-yard touchdown drive to tie it and set up Young's late heroics. The teams combined for just 535 total yards, with Missouri outgaining the Sooners 278-257. Pyne finished 14-of-27 for 143 yards and three touchdowns. Arnold finished 15-of-24 for just 74 yards as the Sooners turned the ball over four times. Wease had four catches for 70 yards and two touchdowns. Oklahoma tied the game with 3:18 left on a bit of trickery. Running back Taylor Tatum took a handoff from Arnold on third down then turned to throw it back to Arnold, who caught it and ran in for an 18-yard touchdown. On the third play of the next drive, Sammy Omosigho hit Missouri's Jamal Roberts, popping the ball free. Bowman scooped it up and took it in for the score. Pyne threw three touchdowns in the second half, including a 5-yard touchdown to Brett Norfleet with 8:47 left. But the point-after attempt was missed, keeping Missouri's lead 16-9. That's when the Sooners finally answered, with a 12-play, 75-yard touchdown drive to tie the game. Oklahoma's Zach Schmit hit three field goals, including a career-long 56-yarder as time expired in the second quarter, to send the Sooners into halftime leading 9-3. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Langer got off to a hot start at Phoenix Country Club, picking up three birdies within his first five holes. He finished with five on the day against one bogey and sits at 13-under 200 for the tournament, one shot better than defending champion Steven Alker of New Zealand.  ""Didn't putt as well as the first two days, made a couple early on and then kind of didn't get the pace,"" Langer said. ""It was a little short at times and just didn't make as many. Played very solid, hit the ball very well, gave myself a bunch of chances and pretty happy overall."" Alker shared low-round honors with Australia's Richard Green by recording an 8-under 63.  Both Alker and Green put together a phenomenal showing on the front nine, with Alker pairing six birdies and three pars and Green collecting seven birdies and two pars.  ""It's just heated up,"" Alker said of his putter. ""I just quiet the noise a little bit and settle it down and softened up my grip a little bit. Just small things go a long way. I've been seeing my lines good and rolling it good.""  Green finished with nine birdies and a bogey at the par-3 13th to climb six spots up the leaderboard and into sole possession of third at 11-under 202. He is two strokes behind Langer and trailing Alker by one.  With such a tight race atop the leaderboard, Langer knows that he has to bring his A-game on Sunday.  ""Well, I think I've got to continue to play aggressive and hit as many fairways as I possibly can and as many greens,"" Langer said. ""The key for me is making putts. I've got to try and hit 15, 16, 17 greens in regulation if I can and make a bunch of putts."" Alex Cejka of Germany (68 on Saturday), Jerry Kelly (66) and Stewart Cink (75) are in fourth, fifth and sixth, respectively. Cink really struggled, ending up with five bogeys and a double bogey on his card.

North Florida (2-0), of the Atlantic Sun Conference, earned the program's first victory over a team from the Southeastern Conference with an opening-night, 74-71 win at South Carolina on Monday. The Ospreys then pounded Charleston Southern 90-66 at home on Thursday. ""Guys really stepped up,"" North Florida coach Matthew Driscoll said after the win over the Gamecocks. ""A lot of big shots. Guys made huge plays, huge rebounds, huge defensive stops and really, really proud of our spirit and what we did as (a) unit. It takes a village to do these kinds of things and I think our guys are continuing to grow."" Jaylen Smith, part of last season's ASUN All-Freshman Team, led the Ospreys with 16 points in the win over South Carolina, then had 11 against Charleston Southern. Freshman Josh Harris had 23 points and eight rebounds against the latter.  Graduate transfer Liam Murphy has recovered from a torn labrum that cost him the entire 2023-24 season and is averaging 16.5 points through the first two games of the campaign.  North Florida is 0-19 against teams currently in the ACC. It has never faced Georgia Tech. Georgia Tech had little trouble against ASUN opponent West Georgia in its season opener, winning 85-62 on Wednesday. It was the largest margin of victory for the Yellow Jackets (1-0) since Damon Stoudamire became coach a season ago. ""I think what I'm trying to find out, see guys get better, see the group get better as a unit, but then just keep finding guys that I can trust,"" Stoudamire said. ""We just gotta keep building brick by brick. And our trajectory just gotta keep going in the right direction."" Newcomer Javian McCollum scored 18 points on Wednesday to surpass the 1,000-point mark for his career. He was Oklahoma's leading scorer last season.

Milroe, who also passed for 109 yards, matched his best single-game rushing touchdown total and surpassed his previous rushing yardage high of 155, both of which came in a 42-28 victory against LSU last season. The Crimson Tide (7-2, 4-2 SEC) strengthened their College Football Playoff chances with their first conference road victory of the season.   Garrett Nussmeier passed for 239 yards and a touchdown, threw two interceptions and lost a fumble as the Tigers (6-3, 3-2) suffered a major blow to their already slim playoff hopes.

Alabama then drove 80 yards, the final 19 of which came on Milroe's third rushing touchdown. The score held at 28-6 until the first play of the fourth quarter, when Milroe ran 72 yards for his final score. Richard Young added an 8-yard touchdown for the Crimson Tide with 2:07 left before Nussmeier threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Kyren Lacy with 11 seconds remaining.   Alabama opened the scoring less than five minutes into the game. The Crimson Tide received the opening kickoff and drove 75 yards, with Milroe running off the final 39 to make it 7-0 with 10:49 left in the first quarter. Milroe completed all three of his pass attempts for 38 yards on the drive.

Jusuf Nurkic made a tiebreaking free throw with eight-tenths of a second remaining Friday night, giving Phoenix a 114-113 win over the host Dallas Mavericks. It not only gave the Suns, leaders of the Pacific Division, their seventh consecutive win, but also their third in a row by three or fewer points. Phoenix's eight victories this season have come by a total of 37 points. ""It feels like every night it's been one,"" Suns coach Mike Budenholzer observed after his team's seventh win by six or fewer points. ""Winning close games on the road builds confidence, builds toughness."" Phoenix has worked its close-game magic at home as well. Before heading to Dallas, the Suns went 3-0 on a homestand in which they beat the Portland Trail Blazers by six, the Philadelphia 76ers by two and the Miami Heat by three. On a team featuring Kevin Durant, who will miss about two weeks with a left calf strain, and Devin Booker, Nurkic has been the Suns' most productive fourth-quarter player with a team-best plus-21. He leads the team in fourth-quarter field goal percentage (75.0) and offensive rebounds (six), and trails Royce O'Neale 18-17 for the team lead in total rebounds. He will match up Sunday with Kings star Domantas Sabonis, who recorded his eighth consecutive double-double with 23 points and 12 rebounds in Friday's 107-98 home loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. Sabonis had three consecutive triple-doubles, missing a fourth straight by one assist, when the Kings lost three of five in a rare five-game season series with the Suns last year. Two of the triple-doubles came in losses at Phoenix in January (21 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists) and February (35 points, 18 rebounds, 12 assists). The big man contributed to one of the Kings' biggest problems on Friday -- 3-point shooting. Sacramento missed 23 of its 26 attempts from deep (11.5 percent), the fifth time in the last six games in which the Kings have made 33.3 percent or less. Sabonis was 0-for-2. Other than De'Aaron Fox (2-for-5), Sacramento starters went 0-for-13, including Keegan Murray's six straight misses. Unfazed by his club's early-season slump, Kings coach Mike Brown expressed confidence that his guys would come right back firing against the Suns. ""It doesn't matter who we play. We want to let it fly,"" he said. ""We feel like we're a good 3-point shooting team. Although the numbers might not point that direction right now, we have guys who can knock that shot down. ""Any time you touch the paint, especially in today's NBA, everybody converges. So we want to touch the paint, let that thing fly and hopefully knock down shots."" At 30.7 percent, the Kings sit near the bottom of the NBA rankings in 3-point field goal percentage this season. The Suns, with O'Neale having made 52.6 percent and Durant 42.9, have been among the best at 38.3 percent. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Drew Allar completed 20 of 28 passes for 220 yards and a touchdown for Penn State (8-1 overall, 5-1 Big Ten), which could move up in the College Football Playoff rankings after losses by No. 3 Georgia and No. 4 Miami. Teammate Kaytron Allen rushed 20 times for 98 yards and a score. The Nittany Lions had a 486-193 edge in total offense. The normally staid Penn State offense came up with some intriguing plays in taking a 28-0 halftime lead. Backup quarterback Beau Pribula came off the bench and scored on an 8-yard run around the left end to open the scoring with 3:48 left in the first quarter. That capped a nine-play, 72-yard drive after Washington's Grady Gross hit the upright on a 45-yard field goal attempt. Facing third-and-goal from the UW 2-yard line with 9:23 remaining in the second, Warren -- a finalist for the Paul Hornung Award as college football's most versatile player -- lined up as the quarterback in a Wildcat formation. Warren took the snap and vaulted into the end zone to make it 14-0. With 3:23 left in the quarter, Penn State faced the same situation -- third-and-goal from the 2 -- and again used Warren in the Wildcat formation. This time he muscled his way over the goal line behind the left tackle. Allar then threw an 8-yard scoring strike to Julian Fleming with 23 seconds left in the half. Penn State's Nicholas Singleton returned the second-half kickoff 97 yards, but the touchdown was called back because of a holding penalty.

UW quarterback Will Rogers III was 10-of-13 passing for 59 yards and one interception in the first half before being replaced by Demond Williams Jr., who was 6-of-10 passing for 60 yards and rushed for a team-high 38 yards on 10 attempts. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Because Logano's car had to go through inspection two extra times before passing, he lost the benefit of getting to select his pit stop, and his car chief was ejected for the race. Logano did not appear to be overly concerned, however.   ""We feel confident,"" Logano said. ""I feel like our car is strong.   ""We feel strong about our team and these type of pressure situations, we feel very solid as far as our team and these moments. We're just executing our plan.""   His Penske teammate Blaney also remained confident despite the qualifying setback.   ""Our lap obviously didn't go well, I just got kind of free going into (Turn) 1 and ruined it all and couldn't really make it back up,"" Blaney said.

""We'll just kind of take it how we can get it tomorrow, just work through the first handful of laps and kinda start marching forward. Pretty similar to last year. Hopefully, it ends the same. If we can charge through the field, I think our race car is good enough we can make that happen.""   Byron was pleased to get that first pit stall pick with his qualifying effort, but had hoped to turn in a faster lap. He was quickest in the opening round.   ""Sucks, didn't just quite get the lap I wanted in the second lap but feel really good about our race car and get first pit pick and that's huge.

Gabriel was 23 for 34 for 183 yards passing with three touchdowns and no interceptions for the Ducks (10-0, 7-0 Big Ten), who led 14-10 before scoring 25 of the game's final 33 points. His record-setting touchdown came on a 3-yard toss to left tackle Gernorris Wilson that put Oregon up 29-10 midway through the third quarter.  Gabriel surpassed former Houston quarterback Case Keenum, who accounted for 155 passing touchdowns and 23 rushing scores for the Cougars from 2007-11. Billy Edwards Jr. completed 22 for 44 passes for 206 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions for the Terrapins (4-5, 1-5), who have lost two straight games. Jordan James ran up the middle for a 3-yard touchdown to give Oregon the lead for good, 7-3, with 2:21 to play in the first quarter. The score was set up by a 26-yard pass from Gabriel to James one play after the Ducks converted a fourth-and-1. Oregon made it 14-3 early in the second quarter with a defensive touchdown. Defensive lineman Jordan Burch stripped the ball from Edwards and Brandon Johnson returned the fumble 62 yards. Maryland made it 14-10 on Roman Hemby's 1-yard touchdown run, which capped off a nine-play drive with 3:17 left in the first half. That left enough time for Gabriel to engineer a 12-play, 75-yard drive that culminated with a 9-yard scoring pass to tight end Terrance Ferguson 20 seconds before halftime. Oregon used a fake punt to extend its lead in the third quarter. Facing fourth-and-3 at its own 22-yard line, Burch took the direct snap on a fake punt and rumbled 36 yards.  Five plays later, Gabriel tossed his record-setting touchdown and Josh Conerly Jr. ran in the two-point conversion to make it 29-10. The Terrapins took advantage of several Ducks defensive penalties to sustain drives.

Iamaleava completed 8 of 13 passes for 174 yards but didn't return for the second half after sustaining an upper-body injury late in the second quarter. However, the Volunteers (8-1, 5-1 Southeastern Conference) led 20-7 at the half and weren't truly threatened by the Bulldogs (2-8, 0-6). Sampson collected 149 yards on 30 carries, going over the 1,000-yard mark for the first time in his career. Tennessee rolled up 452 total yards, split almost equally between rushing (240) and passing (212). Freshman quarterback Michael Van Buren Jr. had a rough night for Mississippi State, hitting just 10 of 26 passes for 92 yards with an interception. The Volunteers' defense applied steady pressure, notching four sacks. Tennessee has tied Texas A&M for the SEC lead, a half-game ahead of Texas. The Volunteers can wrap up a spot in the SEC title game next month by winning next week at Georgia and on Nov. 30 at Vanderbilt. Tennessee took a quick 7-0 lead just over three minutes into the game when Iamaleava and Squirrel White hooked up for a 34-yard strike.

Despite Magny entering the fight as the 15th-ranked welterweight, Prates was the sizeable betting favorite. After a few wrestling exchanges, Prates caught Magny with a short left hook, plus a follow-up shot that kept Magny off-balance, leading to the referee stopping the fight at the 4:50 mark of the round. ""Man, I can't explain how happy I am right now,"" Prates said in his post-fight interview. Prates (21-6-0) has four finishes in the UFC this year and is offering to fight Jack Della Maddalena in his next bout.  Magny (29-14-0) has lost his past two fights since beginning the year with a win against Mike Malott at UFC 297 in January. Newly minted UFC middleweight Reinier de Ridder (18-2-0) did not disappoint in his UFC debut, submitting Gerald Meerschaert (37-18-0) by third-round arm triangle in the co-main event. It was de Ridder's 12th submission win of his career.  If any fights fall through, de Ridder requested a quick turnaround at UFC 309, which will be held next Saturday in New York.  A bantamweight fight between Gaston Bolanos (8-4-0) and Cortavious Romious (9-3-0) entertained the limited crowd at the UFC APEX. Bolanos rallied after nearly getting finished in Round 1, using his striking volume to win the fight by unanimous decision. He took the cards 30-26, 30-27, 30-27.

Forsberg and Marchessault each had a power-play goal and Roman Josi recorded two assists for the Predators, who won for just the fifth time in 15 games this season. Four of those victories have come at home for Nashville, which equaled its goal total from the previous three games.  Saros, meanwhile, wasn't tested often, but his most notable save of the night came while almost on his back. He made a desperation catch on Nick Schmaltz's net-front backhander within the game's first three minutes en route to his second shutout of the season.  Connor Ingram stopped 17 of 20 shots for Utah, which was shut out for the second time in three games. Utah is 3-6-3 since winning the opening three games of the franchise's history.  Nashville got a break just 1:11 into the game, when Utah's Alexander Kerfoot was whistled for a trip on Gustav Nyquist. Then less than 1:30 later, Forsberg glided into the circle and snapped the puck past Ingram to open the scoring at 2:37 of the first period.   The power play again came through for the Predators with 8:02 left in the opening period. After Utah killed a five-on-three Nashville advantage, the Predators still had two more minutes left on Olli Maatta's high-sticking penalty. That's when Josi sent a shot toward the net, where Marchessault redirected the puck by Ingram to give Nashville a 2-0 lead.  Utah was outshot 12-4 in the first period, but recorded the first six shots on goal in the second. However, the Predators went up 3-0 when Forsberg got the puck on the near boards, then raced into the Utah zone and eventually beat Ingram with 8:55 remaining in the middle period.  Forsberg failed to score in the previous three games but now has a team-leading eight goals this season.

For the last few games, the Nuggets' reserves have played well, but that hasn't been the case for the Dallas Mavericks. Coach Jason Kidd was critical of his bench after Friday's last-second loss to the Suns, and it's an issue of concern heading into Sunday night's game in Denver. Only two Dallas reserves played significant minutes Friday night -- Spencer Dinwiddie (28) and Dwight Powell (26) -- and the bench combined for just nine points. It has forced Kidd to play stars Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving more than 40 minutes. ""The fatigue of running Luka and Kyrie 40-something minutes because our bench stinks right now. ... As deep as we are, we've got to get someone to participate off the bench,"" Kidd said. ""Somebody has to join the party to help Kyrie and Luka. That's just not happening right now."" Doncic and Irving are averaging 37.2 and 35.7 minutes, respectively, and are the top two scorers on the team. Injuries have hurt the rotation, as P.J. Washington (knee), Maxi Kleber (hamstring) and Dereck Lively II (shoulder) were all out against the Suns. The injuries and bench aren't the only thing concerning Kidd -- it's his team's slow starts. The Mavericks trailed by 13 at halftime Friday night before rallying to tie it late. ""For whatever reason, we get off to a slow start,"" Kidd said after the game. ""It's got to be addressed. We've talked about it; there's got to be action. Somebody's got to come with some energy. We're flat."" Denver has started slow several times but has rallied to win three of those games. The Nuggets, after an 0-2 start, have won four straight and six of the last seven with strong play from the reserves. The bench didn't score much in the 135-122 win over the Heat on Friday night, but Russell Westbrook had 10 assists and Julian Strawther and Hunter Tyson played solid minutes. Westbrook started the previous three games for Jamal Murray (concussion), but Murray returned Friday to score a season-high 28 points. ""Felt good. Head feels OK. Just happy to be out there and playing with the team again,"" Murray said. Denver is also without starting power forward Aaron Gordon (right calf strain) for multiple weeks, though Peyton Watson has played well in his spot. It helps having Nikola Jokic in the lineup, too. The three-time MVP is making a case for a fourth with his play in the first nine games. Jokic entered Saturday fifth in scoring (28.9 points a game) and first in rebounds (13.2) and assists (11.3), and had his fifth triple-double of the season Friday night. He is the focus of every opponent's defense and finds an open teammate when he is double-teamed. ""Playing with Nikola helps everybody. He puts it in the right spots,"" said Christian Braun, who had 21 points against the Heat. ""You get a lot of easy looks, you get a lot of easy ones early that give you confidence."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Slisz's goal came while Miami defender Tomas Aviles was down on the ground in his own penalty area and his teammates implored referee Lukasz Szpala to stop play. But the laws of the game require referees halt play only if a head injury is suspected, and Aviles clearly grabbed at his leg. As Miami appealed, Atlanta played on, with Pedro Amador providing an outswinging cross from the left and Slisz meeting it to head emphatically past goalkeeper Drake Callender. Jamal Thiare scored a first-half brace for ninth-seeded Atlanta, which needed to win its last two regular season matches just to reach the Eastern Conference wild-card match. From there it triumphed on penalties at CF Montreal, then split the first two games against top-seeded Miami, with each home team winning 2-1, before pulling off Saturday's shocking away victory. Brad Guzan made seven saves to complete a heroic effort across the best-of-three series and help Atlanta advance in an East bracket where all top three seeds were eliminated. Atlanta will visit fourth-seeded Orlando City in an Eastern Conference semifinal after the November international window. Messi and Miami are eliminated after earning an MLS-record 74 points in the regular season to capture the Supporters' Shield and top overall playoff seed. Messi scored a second-half equalizer for Miami, his first goal of the postseason and a rare one through the air after contributing an assist in the series-opening win two weekends ago. Matias Rojas opened the scoring for the Herons in the 17th minute on a rebound after Guzan saved an earlier Messi attempt. But Thiare turned an early deficit into an early lead for Atlanta in the next four minutes. In the 19th minute, he reached Dax McCarty's deflected through ball and hammered a finish past Callender into the top right corner. Two minutes later, Thiare dispatched the finish of Aleksey Miranchuk's clever square pass after McCarty's ball from midfield freed Miranchuk down the right side. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Dougie Hamilton collected the rebound and passed through the neutral zone to Hughes, who descended upon Ilya Sorokin and beat him stick side.  Hughes opened the scoring in the second for the Devils.

The Sixers are desperate for a victory Sunday when they host the Charlotte Hornets, who are seeking their third straight win. Philadelphia (1-7) was expected to contend for a championship behind the dynamic trio of Joel Embiid, Paul George and Tyrese Maxey. However, an array of injuries has upended the 76ers. Embiid has yet to play this season due to a knee injury and, most recently, he was given a three-game suspension for shoving a columnist. The former NBA MVP is expected to make his season debut Tuesday when the New York Knicks come to town. George (knee) missed the first five games and is shooting just 41.7 percent overall (and 3 of 16 on 3-pointers) since returning. Then there is Maxey, who injured his hamstring in a loss to the host Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday and will likely miss multiple weeks. At this point, the Sixers are just trying to stay afloat until they get healthy. ""The ship hasn't sunk,"" George said. ""We know that we have to remain positive. We know that big fella is coming back, and he's one of the best. We're going to get Tyrese healthy and we'll get him back. Then we can finally be a complete team and start to build, and then we can finally begin to find out who we are."" In their most recent contest, the Sixers absorbed a 116-106 loss to LeBron James and the host Los Angeles Lakers on Friday. Rookie Jared McCain came off the bench to lead Philadelphia in scoring with 18 points on 6-of-17 shooting, while George and Kelly Oubre Jr. shot a combined 8 of 29 (0 of 10 from deep) and finished with nine points apiece. ""We have some plays there, and it just seems like we don't make them, or we go through a drought shooting the ball,"" 76ers coach Nick Nurse said. ""We have to collectively figure out a way to play better."" The defensive end might be a good place to start. Philadelphia has allowed at least 105 points in all eight of its games -- a trend that might spell bad news against the Hornets' impressive duo of LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller. Ball is averaging 28.4 points and is coming off a 31-point performance in Charlotte's 103-83 win over the visiting Indiana Pacers. He had 17 points in the fourth quarter, matching Indiana's team total, and leads the NBA in fourth-quarter points this season. ""I just think that his overall confidence in himself and his confidence in his teammates just exudes in the fourth quarter,"" Charlotte coach Charles Lee said. ""And I think it just becomes contagious for all of us where we know we've got that guy and he's going to help us all be better."" Miller, who hit a putback at the buzzer Wednesday to be the Detroit Pistons, then scored 29 points on 7-of-11 shooting from long range against Indiana. ""Scary sight,"" Miller said of the Hornets' talented tandem. ""It's definitely going to be scary. LaMelo is that two-way (player) that Coach Charles has been preaching to everybody, and also myself. I think that's a dangerous game to play. His ability to pass the ball on the offensive side and my ability to knock down shots, I think that's a great duo to have in this league."" The Sixers have won 23 of the past 25 meetings with the Hornets, including all four matchups last season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Chris Kreider and Reilly Smith also scored and Adam Fox had two assists in the win. Quick made 37 saves in his third start this season as the Rangers completed a three-game sweep of the season series versus Detroit. The Rangers were coming off a 6-1 home loss to the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday. Red Wings goaltender Ville Husso, who was making his first appearance since opening night, made 20 saves.

The Red Wings entered the contest 31st in penalty killing and that unit gave up the first goal. With Simon Edvinsson in the penalty box for tripping, Fox took a slap shot from the right point that Kreider deflected past Husso. Panarin was credited with the second assist. Detroit had a 19-8 advantage in shots on goal in the second period, yet the Rangers stretched their lead to 3-0. Early in the period, Detroit's Patrick Kane had a shot clang off the post.

But now that the core of the team is gaining experience, Daigneault said it has become easier to prepare for players like Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors. The Thunder and Warriors square off Sunday in Oklahoma City in a battle of two of the top teams in the Western Conference. ""The good news is with our continuity and our growing experience, we're now at the point where we've played against him a lot,"" Daigneault said of Curry. ""There's a cumulative effect to learning the league and learning the game plan over time."" Defending Curry will still be plenty challenging, though.

He has scored 21.0 points per game in his last three games after missing the previous three contests due to a left ankle injury. ""If you blink, he's going to be open and he's going to shoot and make a shot,"" Daigneault said. ""It doesn't make it easier to execute it, but I think our familiarity has increased over time."" For Golden State, Sunday's game is the final in a five-game road trip. The Warriors are 3-1 so far on the trip but are coming off a 136-117 blowout loss on Friday in Cleveland. Golden State trailed that game by 41 points at halftime. ""We gotta respond,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""... We gotta execute better. We had 13 turnovers in the first half. We were completely disorganized. That's where I feel like we need the most work."" It was a rare slip for the Warriors, who entered Saturday ranked second in the NBA in defensive rating, at 106.5 points allowed per 100 possessions. The Thunder are the only team better, at 97.3 points per 100 possessions. Both defenses are also near the top of the league in steals per game, with Oklahoma City averaging an NBA-best 12.9 and Golden State third at 9.8. The Thunder also lead the league with 7.3 blocks per game, while the Warriors average 6.0. Golden State is leading the league with 22.0 points off turnovers per game while the Thunder are tied for fourth at 20.3. Oklahoma City is coming off a 126-107 win over Houston on Friday in the opener of a six-game homestand. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, 26, led the Thunder with 29 points. The seventh-year guard paces Oklahoma City with 26.3 points and 6.4 assists per game. The Thunder are 4-0 at home this season, winning by an average of 17.8 points per game. The biggest difference between the teams is their offensive style. Oklahoma City leads the league in drives per game with 62.1. The Thunder have topped the league in that category in each of the last four seasons.  But though Oklahoma City has attacked the basket regularly, it has drawn just 19.1 free throw attempts per game, the third-fewest in the league. Golden State, meanwhile, averages just 37.3 drives per game, more than just two other teams. The Warriors try 41.1 3-pointers per game, slightly more than the Thunder's 39.2 attempts.  Sunday's game is the first of three between the teams this season. The Thunder won three of four last season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

We've asked him to be aggressive and make the right plays and I think that's what we have to continue to ask from him every night."" Even with Banchero in the lineup, the Magic were having issues on offense. They rank 28th in the NBA in scoring at 106.7 points and are shooting just 44.1 percent from the floor. Jalen Suggs has become the Magic's No. 2 offensive option, averaging 16.3 points this season. But for now, it's all about Wagner shouldering the load. ""Our coaches have done a great job of watching film with him,"" Mosely said. ""Last year, multiple times, he was getting double-teamed and he made the right read, saw the right opening. I think the more he sees it, the more he will recognize it and make the right plays."" The young Wizards have struggled defensively and lost their past three games. They are allowing 123.9 points per game, which ranks second to last in the league. The fewest points the Wizards have allowed this season is 118. The most points Orlando has scored this season is 119. No. 2 overall pick Alex Sarr is averaging just 9.6 points and 6.7 boards and hasn't quite found his groove. Washington has gotten a boost in the past two games from rookie Kyshawn George, who has scored a combined 37 points and made nine threes in that span. ""We've talked about how sometimes you make or miss shots and now he's making the ones he missed,"" Wizards coach Brian Keefe said. ""He's got a good rhythm. He's able to read the game."" ""I know not a lot of rookies have this opportunity to be on the court, number one, and two, have a coaching staff that pushes you to be aggressive,"" George said. ""I think my teammates and my coaches have helped me keep my confidence up."" Jordan Poole is leading the Wizards with 20.7 points per game. One bright spot for Washington has been the play of second-year forward Bilal Coulibaly, who has nearly doubled his scoring output from last season and has raised his shooting percentage from 43.5 to 53.9 percent this season, all while continuing to draw tough defensive assignments. ""That's one of the things we really expect from Bilal,"" Keefe said. ""He has the defensive versatility to guard multiple guys. We're going to continue to do that with him because that's one of his strengths."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

As long as that remains true, the Minnesota Timberwolves superstar plans to keep launching from deep.   Edwards will look to stay hot when the Timberwolves host the Miami Heat on Sunday in Minneapolis. The Timberwolves will try to increase their winning streak to four after victories over the Charlotte Hornets, Chicago Bulls and Portland Trail Blazers. ""I really can't explain it,"" Edwards said of his long-distance prowess. ""I'm not shocked or anything because I work so hard on my trey ball. It's like, ‘Here we go, this is what was supposed to happen.' Hopefully it will keep going that way."" Edwards has been a major part of Minnesota's recent success. He scored 37 points and made 9 of 15 shots from beyond the 3-point arc against Portland, posting those numbers despite resting in the fourth quarter with the Wolves up big.   In nine games this season, Edwards has 50 3-pointers while shooting a career-best 48.1 percent from beyond the arc.   Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said Edwards' shooting has helped the offense hum.   ""It makes the floor huge,"" Finch said. ""He's got great range. He's taking them in the flow of the offense. He's reading the coverages in pick-and-rolls really well right now. He's playing at a high level.""   Meanwhile, Miami is looking for a spark. The Heat have lost three straight against the Sacramento Kings, Phoenix Suns and Denver Nuggets.   Miami is coming off a 135-122 defeat in Denver on Friday night. Tyler Herro led the Heat with 24 points, but Jimmy Butler scored only two points and played only seven minutes before spraining his right ankle. He won't play Sunday.   ""It's always next-man-up mentality,"" Herro said. ""We've dealt with injuries and different guys being out, me being one of them. It's always next-man-up mentality.""   Butler, 35, is averaging 16.1 points, 4.9 assists and 4.8 rebounds this season.   Without Butler, the Heat will look for a better performance on defense. During their losing streak, the Heat have given up 111, 115 and 135 points, respectively.   ""We've got to figure it out,"" Duncan Robinson said. ""This group has got to figure it out. We've got some good stretches defensively. You've got to learn how to win. You've got guys that have done it before. It's just not going to come automatically.""   Minnesota also places an emphasis on defense. A key on that end of the court is Rudy Gobert, who surpassed 9,000 career rebounds in Friday's win.   ""Nine thousand rebounds, it's cool,"" Gobert said. ""It makes me just sit back and realize the journey. ... I'm still on the way. I'm still working every day. We'll see how many I get when it's all over.""   The Timberwolves went 2-0 against the Heat last season. Minnesota won 106-90 at home Oct. 28, 2023, and prevailed 112-108 at Miami on Dec. 18.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

In the fifth and final round of the shootout, Panthers goalie Sergei Bobrovsky made a glove save on Morgan Frost to end the game. It was Bobrovsky's fifth straight win. It was also career victory No. 404, moving him past Grant Fuhr for 12th place on the NHL's all-time list. Florida leads the Eastern Conference with 23 points. Sam Bennett, Nate Schmidt and Dmitry Kulikov scored in regulation for the Panthers, who got two assists from Rodrigues. Bobrovsky, who played his first two NHL seasons for the Flyers (2010-2012), made 34 saves through overtime. The Flyers got goals from Joel Farabee, Anthony Richard and Garnet Hathaway. Scott Laughton added two assists, and goalie Samuel Ersson made 28 saves. Owen Tippett scored in the shootout for Philadelphia. Philadelphia got the first period's only goal. With 4:57 elapsed, Laughton skated from behind the net and won a puck battle with Florida's Uvis Balinskis. Laughton pushed the puck forward to Farabee, who scored on a one-timer from point-blank range. The Panthers came alive in the second period, scoring three of the four goals. First, Rodrigues dished back to the trailer, defenseman Nate Schmidt, who scored on a blistering shot from beyond the top of the left circle. Ersson misplayed that shot as the puck tucked in under his left underarm. The Panthers took a 2-1 lead as Rodrigues worked a give-and-go with Kulikov. For the finish, Rodrigues' lateral cross-ice pass to the slot found Kulikov, who scored off the left post. Philadelphia challenged that goal, believing the puck had gone out of play earlier in the sequence. But that challenge was denied. However, with seven minutes left in the second, Philadelphia pulled its goalie temporarily for an extra attacker on a delayed penalty. That resulted in Richard's goal from the high slot, tying the score 2-2. Bobrovsky, beaten high stick-side, appeared to have been screened on that shot as two Panthers and two Flyers were out in front. Florida regained the lead with 5:04 left in the second as Bennett scored from close range on a one-timer pass from Carter Verhaeghe. Hathaway tied the score 3-3 with 10:13 left in the third as he tried to center the puck. Instead, the puck bounced off of Panthers defenseman Balinskis before squirting in between Bobrovsky's pads. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

But Sunday the Sun Devils go up against the big dogs. Arizona State (2-0) will travel to Spokane, Wash., to face the No. 6 Gonzaga Bulldogs (1-0). ""It was a test,"" ASU coach Bobby Hurley said of beating Santa Clara for his 199th career victory. ""They'll win a lot of games this year. ""It is an older team that has played a lot of games together and brought several guys back. So it was a really good win for us."" Seniors BJ Freeman and Adam Miller led the way for the Sun Devils on Friday, scoring 17 and 16 points, respectively, and combining for five 3-pointers. ASU also got a boost from freshmen Amier Ali (13 points), Joson Sanon (11 points) and Jayden Quaintance (13 rebounds). ""There are a number of guys who can be playmakers and we trust to make the right play,"" Hurley said. ""If we share the ball the right way, good things will happen. Joson got off to a fast start, JQ came through with his rebounding, and Amier made some big shots down the stretch. The freshmen stepped up for us."" The Sun Devils played much better than in their home opener, a 55-48 victory against Idaho State on Tuesday. ""It came down to executing and moving the ball,"" Miller said. ""We have great players, so when we are kicking out and hitting 3s, that's what our team is built off of. We have to continue making the extra pass and getting into the paint."" That will be essential against the Bulldogs, who are coming off a season-opening 101-63 victory against No. 8 Baylor in Spokane on Monday. Nolan Hickman scored 17 points and Graham Ike had 15 points and eight rebounds to lead a balanced Gonzaga attack. The Bulldogs had seven players score nine or more points. ""They just came in and played with great confidence and were very, very assertive,"" Gonzaga coach Mark Few said. ""That's the beauty of this team. We have some nice depth."" The Zags are opening the season with two games against major conference opponents for just the second time in Few's 26 seasons. The last time they did that was in 2020-21, when they beat Kansas and Auburn to open the season and reached 31-0 before falling to Baylor in the NCAA Tournament championship game. ""I'm winless against them, so it definitely is a game you always circle on your calendar when you play against Baylor,"" Gonzaga forward Ben Gregg said. ""Just the history of the program the last 10 years or so. So circled them on our calendar, knew it was the first game. Said before the game we just want to make a statement and we did that."" Perhaps the most impressive thing about Gonzaga's rout was its defense. The Bulldogs held prized Baylor freshman VJ Edgecombe, considered a likely NBA draft lottery pick, to just two points until a highlight-reel dunk over GU's Joe Few, the coach's son, with 1:41 remaining. Edgecombe finished 2-of-11 from the field for four points in 29 minutes.    --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Orlando took the best-of-three series with Charlotte 2-1.  Orlando City were a perfect 4-for-4 in the shootout. Luis Muriel, Kyle Smith, Torres and Rafael Santos all beat Charlotte FC goalkeeper Kristijan Kahlina. Pedro Gallese stopped two of the three Charlotte penalty kicks in the shootout for Orlando.  Orlando was awarded a PK about midway through second-half stoppage time after Djibril Diani pulled down Duncan McGuire in the area. On the ensuing penalty kick, Torres was initially stopped by Kahlina but put in his own rebound to level the score. Karol Swiderski opened the scoring in the 81st minute. He had subbed in in the 61st and put Charlotte FC ahead 1-0 by putting a left-footed strike off a cross from Liel Abada past Gallese. Orlando dominated the first-half possession and had plenty of opportunities to take the lead in the opening 45 minutes.  Three minutes into the match, Torres had a chance in the area but didn't get a clear touch on the ball before Kahlina could grab it. Then, in the 16th minute, Rodrigo Schlegel had an opportunity in the area, heading Martin Ojeda's free kick, but Kahlina was able to make a save. A minute later, Torres' left-footed strike in the area got past Kahlina but hit the post. Torres' strike from the center of the box in the 21st minute also found the woodwork, as Kahlina was able to get his hand on it to deflect it out of harm's way. Charlotte's best chance in the first half came just before stoppage time, as Patrick Agyemang thought he'd opened the scoring in the 45th minute, chipping his strike up and over Gallese, but the play was ruled offside. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The Buffaloes (7-2, 5-1 Big 12) racked up 10 tackles for a loss, six sacks, two forced fumbles, an interception and a touchdown.

Per the report, Prescott and the Cowboys are holding off until one more specialist offers an opinion on whether he should undergo surgery. The veteran signal-caller is expected to meet with the specialist early next week in New York. Dallas' medical staff are on board with the surgery, which would keep him off the field for four months. If the specialist agrees with the Cowboys' assessment, Prescott will go under the knife on Wednesday, per the report.   Owner and general manager Jerry Jones told 105.3 The Fan in Dallas on Friday that Prescott would prefer to let the hamstring heal on its own have undergoing multiple surgeries (left shoulder, right thumb, right ankle) over the last few years. Prescott has not been placed on injured reserve, but he will be inactive Sunday when the Cowboys (3-5) try to snap a three-game losing streak against the visiting Philadelphia Eagles (6-2) because of a partial avulsion of his hamstring.

In the first year-ending championship of her career, Gauff captured the Billie Jean King Trophy and the $4,805,000 check -- the largest in the history of women's professional tennis.

Gauff secured her ninth career Hologic WTA Tour singles title in a 3-hour, 4-minute match, the longest final in the WTA Finals since 2008, when time statistics began to be tracked. Gauff, 20, is the youngest player in the title match of the WTA Finals since 2010 (Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki) and is the youngest women's player to win the WTA Finals since Maria Sharapova of Russia at age 17 in 2004.

With the win, Clemson improves to 7-2 and 5-1 in the ACC. They are one of three teams with one loss in the conference behind SMU. Virginia Tech is 5-5 and 3-3 in conference play. After a sloppy first half that saw Klubnik go 8-for-19 in the air, throw an interception at the Hokies' 4-yard line, and take a sack to end another promising drive on fourth down, he showed athleticism and accuracy in the second. Klubnik had two first-down runs on the Tigers' first drive of the second half to keep the chains moving, and connected with speedy wide receiver Cole Turner on a 29-yard pump-and-go for his first score to tie the score at 7. On the next Tigers' drive, facing a third-and-seven, Klubnik evaded Virginia Tech defensive back Mansoor Delane, who came free on a blitz, and found T.J. Moore all alone behind the defense for a 41-yard score to make it 14-7. Clemson cornerback Ashton Hampton would make a brilliant one-armed interception of Virginia Tech quarterback Kyren Drones on the next Hokies' drive and Clemson would march 93 yards on 10 plays with Klubnik connecting with Jake Briningstool for a 12-yard TD pass with 13:08 left. That catch gave Briningstool the most receptions for a tight end in Clemson history. He now has 114. Drones was replaced on the next drive by Collin Schlee, who threw a touchdown pass with 1:43 left. Earlier, the Hokies led 7-0 thanks to a blocked field goal by Keyshawn Burgos that fluttered into the arms of Quentin Reddish, who took it back 77 yards for a score early in the second quarter.

South Carolina's defense did its part, holding Vanderbilt to 274 yards of total offense and a season-low seven points thanks to a dominant performance by its front seven. The Gamecocks sacked Vanderbilt's Diego Pavia (16-of-31 passing, 166 yards, 65 rushing yards) twice, hurried him eight times and broke up eight of his passes. Meanwhile, South Carolina's offensive line had allowed 32 sacks on the season coming into the game, but didn't allow one to the Commodores. It was Vanderbilt's most lopsided defeat this year; previously, the Commodores hadn't lost by more than four points. On the second play of the second half, Sellers escaped the pass rush near his own goal line, rolled left and found a wide-open Jared Brown deep downfield for a 51-yard pass. Two plays later, Sanders found a big hole left and dashed 31 yards for a score and a 14-0 lead. Vanderbilt then sustained its first substantial drive, marching 75 plays in 10 yards and scoring when Pavia broke containment on a pass play and scrambled 17 yards for a touchdown. But Sanders' 39-yard run on the next drive set up his 1-yard scamper to extend the lead back to 14 points. The Commodores moved the ball better in the second half, but the Gamecocks defense stiffened to force turnovers on downs on back-to-back drives. Defensive back Peyton Williams broke up a Pavia pass on the first stop and Bam Martin-Scott broke free on a pass rush to get in Pavia's face and knock down another throw to end the second drive at the Gamecocks 39. After the latter, Sanders took a screen pass from Sellers and weaved his way through defenders for a 43-yard touchdown and a 28-7 lead with 7:55 left. The Gamecocks dominated the first half, out-gaining Vanderbilt 187-83 while steadily pressuring Pavia. Sellers found Nyck Harbor open for 23 yards to the Vanderbilt 17, then hit Josh Simon for a 17-yard touchdown on the next play for the game's first score with 13:11 left in the second quarter. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

After three rounds of penalty kicks where each side converted their shots, the goalkeepers went save for save to keep the shootout going. New York's Matt Freese and Cincinnati's Roman Celentano took turns making saves, with Freese making one more. Chidozie Awaziem of Cincinnati and Andres Perea of NYCFC stepped up in the eighth round but each sent their attempts over the crossbar before Freese made his third and final save on Teenage Habede.

It looked like the two teams that already faced each other five previous times this year in all competitions understood all the other team had planned. Defensively, both teams halted any creativity from the other side, leading to no surprises during the match leading to goals. Luca Orellano had the best chances on goal as the match stayed goalless where the forward had two shots on the goal in the first half. The first came in the 31st minute, when Orellano sent a left-footed shot across the face of goal but Freese dove to make the save. Then, in first-half stoppage time, Orellano dribbled through three defenders, holding possession, and sending a shot towards goal but it went wide right of the post. Orellano was busy offensively, sending in six shots and three on target, more than all of New York City FC who had one shot on target. However, head coach Pat Noonan took Orellano out of the match before penalty kicks after he pulled up and limped late in the match, leading to the visitor's best chance of the night.

The 10th-ranked Wildcats (2-0) stormed out to a 14-2 edge and never let up, flexing their distinct size advantage and using their aggressive defense to quickly turn the game into a rout. Devin Caesar was one of the very few bright spots for the Monarchs (0-2) with 12 points and three rebounds on 5-of-10 shooting. Arizona displayed the formula it hopes can carry it to national title contention this coming season as it begins its first season in the Big 12 Conference. The Wildcats pummeled Old Dominion on the boards, outrebounding the Monarchs 59-28 and out scoring them a staggering 58-24 in the paint. Arizona turned Old Dominion's 18 turnovers into 23 points and opened up a 50-21 lead by halftime. The Wildcats committed only nine turnovers themselves and eclipsed the 100-point mark for the first time this season - something they did seven times last season. Awaka led the effort with a very efficient game at both ends of the floor. Awaka shot 8 of 10 from the field and collected eight offensive rebounds. The inside play complemented Caleb Love on the perimeter as he finished with 10 points, including 2 of 5 from 3-point range and three rebounds. The Wildcats went 8 of 21 from long distance overall. Carter Bryant finished with 12 points and four rebounds while Anthony Dell'Orso had 11 points and four rebounds. Arizona's defense held the Monarchs to just 32 percent shooting and 2 for 16 from 3-point range. The Wildcats racked up numerous trips to the free throw line as well by dominating near the rim. Arizona went 18 of 29 from the foul line while Old Dominion shot only 17 free throws and made six.  The Wildcats will next travel to face Wisconsin on Friday while Old Dominion will play at Radford on Tuesday night. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Braden Sparks had 17 points and eight rebounds to lead the Stags (0-2), who lost 96-58 at Rhode Island on Monday. Jamie Bergens added 12 points and Prophet Johnson paired seven points with six boards. The Hoyas carried a 36-33 lead into the second half and started pulling away by taking advantage of Sorber's size advantage in the paint. Georgetown fed the 6-foot-10 big man near the basket for multiple layups, including back-to-back buckets that pushed the lead to 49-41 with 12:27 to play. Julius Halaifonua's 3-pointer midway through the second half made it 52-43, the Hoyas' largest advantage to that point. Sparks answered with four straight points for Fairfield before the hosts rattled off the next six to take their first double-digit lead at 58-47 with 5:26 to go.

Jets goalie Connor Hellebuyck turned aside 32 shots in the process while setting the franchise shutout streak record to 191:45 of ice time. The Ottawa Senators in 2007-08 won 13 of their first 14 games. Alex Iafallo and Vladislav Namestnikov each had a goal and an assist for Winnipeg. Rasmus Kupari and Nikolaj Ehlers both scored. Cole Perfetti had two helpers, while Neal Pionk, Mark Scheifele and Gabriel Vilardi also chipped in assists. Dallas netminder Jake Oettinger was chased 29:21 into the game after making only 11 saves on 15 shots. He was replaced by Casey DeSmith, who made 10 stops on 10 shots. Iafallo got Winnipeg on the board first 7:28 into the opening frame, finishing off a buzzing man advantage when he chipped the puck into the back of the net following a crisp pass across the crease from Namestnikov. Winnipeg continued to build its lead at the 10:21 mark of the opening stanza when Iafallo created a rebound off Oettinger that trickled onto the stick of Kupari. It took only a quick deke by Kupari to tuck the puck into the open net for 2-0. The offensive onslaught did not stop there. After Namestnikov carved around the back of the net, he stuffed the puck through the glove of Oettinger to give the Jets a 3-0 advantage at 3:34 of the second period. The Jets continued to not give an inch. Ehlers finished off a tight cycle 7:14 into the middle frame from the high slot on the power play to grow his team's lead to 4-0.

The Knicks and Pacers each will look to establish consistency Sunday afternoon, when they meet in Indianapolis in the second game of the season between the longtime Eastern Conference rivals. Both teams were off Saturday following their eventful games Friday, when the host Knicks rolled to a 116-94 win over the Milwaukee Bucks and the visiting Pacers collapsed in the second half of a 103-83 loss to the Charlotte Hornets. The win was the fourth of the season for the new-look Knicks, who overhauled their starting lineup with the offseason additions of Mikal Bridges and Karl-Anthony Towns. It was their third victory by at least 20 points. New York's four losses were by a total of 46 points. Half that collective margin was registered in a season-opening 132-109 loss to the defending NBA champion Boston Celtics. The new and old pieces clicked again in impressive fashion Friday, when the Knicks led the Bucks wire-to-wire. New York pulled off the same achievement in routing the Detroit Pistons 128-98 on Nov. 1. Six Knicks players scored in double figures Friday, when Towns led the Knicks with 32 points and 11 rebounds while Bridges had 17 points. Holdover Josh Hart (11 points, nine rebounds, seven assists) flirted with a triple-double while Jalen Brunson (15 points, nine assists) just missed a double-double.  ""It's going to take time to be cohesive, like we were at the end of the year last year,"" Brunson said of the Knicks, who fell to the Pacers in seven games of last season's Eastern Conference semifinals. ""It's kind of a different team. So for us, we have to continue to gel every single day and keep learning."" The Pacers learned some difficult lessons Friday, when they played a game decided by more than seven points for just the second time this season. Indiana appeared on its way to a decisive victory when it overcame a 10-point first-half deficit and took a 13-point lead by opening the third quarter on a 20-7 run. But the Hornets closed the quarter on a 23-2 run and outscored the Pacers 29-17 in the fourth quarter. Charlotte shot just 37.8 percent from the floor in the first half. The Hornets ended the third by making eight of 11 shots -- including a 5-of-6 performance from beyond the arc -- and shot 56.3 percent (18 of 32) over the final 18 minutes. The Pacers, who opened the third quarter by draining eight of their first nine shots, finished the quarter in a 1-for-10 slump. Indiana missed 11 of its final 12 shots from 3-point range during the Hornets' comeback. Overall, Indiana set season lows in field-goal percentage (39.8 percent) and free-throw percentage (57.1 percent). The 83 points were the fewest for the Pacers since Dec. 12, 2022, when they fell to the Miami Heat 87-82. ""We had a rough shot-taking night on top of everything else and that doesn't help,"" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Being unable to sustain the details that we needed to sustain is the disappointing part."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

McCaffrey missed the first eight games due to Achilles tendinitis in both legs. He was listed as questionable on Friday's injury report. McCaffrey, 28, initially hurt his calf on Aug. 6 and was placed on injured reserve prior to Week 2. But now he's ready to go and 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan is ready to give him the ball. McCaffrey was NFL Offensive Player of the Year last season when he led the NFL with 2,023 yards from scrimmage: a league-leading 1,459 rushing yards and 14 touchdowns plus 67 catches for 564 yards and seven touchdowns.

When Fairleigh Dickinson visits the Bluejays on Sunday afternoon in Omaha, Neb., Kalkbrenner will try to follow his career high 49-point outburst where he set a school record with 20 made field goals in 22 attempts in a 99-86 win Wednesday against Texas Rio Grande Valley. It was a shooting performance that rivals all time NCAA records and the fact that it came from a three-time Big East Defensive Player of the Year winner shows just how well-rounded Kalkbrenner's game has become. The last time a player converted 20 field goals and shot over 90 percent was in 1973, when the late Bill Walton did it at UCLA. The 49 points also broke Doug McDermott's CHI Health Center Omaha arena record of 45 points set in 2014. Kalkbrenner's previous scoring high was 31 points set in the first round of the 2023 NCAA Tournament against North Carolina State. ""We wanted to make a concerted effort to get me established in the post,"" Kalkbrenner said. ""I saw a few go in and kept it going from there. I didn't even realize how much I had. We were in a close game and not executing what we wanted to on defense. I was thinking more about that than what I was doing on offense."" A tight first half led to a two-possession game in the second half as Rio Grande Valley connected on 14 of 35 shots from 3-point range and had 15 offensive rebounds. Creighton coach Greg McDermott said the effort from the scrappy Vaqueros provided plenty of teaching moments the Bluejays will review in a film session and at practice.  ""We'll have a spirited practice to try and get ourselves some better habits on the defensive end,"" McDermott said. ""I'm happy to get the win, but disappointed in what we are doing defensively."" Steven Ashworth added 25 points, on 17-of-17 shooting from the free-throw line, with seven rebounds and seven assists. He was just 3 of 10 from the floor. ""It was incredible,"" McDermott said of Kalkbrenner's performance. ""His teammates did a great job of finding him, of realizing what he had going. He's one of the best players to ever play here and there have been some really good players that have played here."" Last season, Fairleigh Dickinson led the Northeast Conference with 92.0 points per game. The Knights are in search of an offense that is more motion oriented this season and after they dropped their season opener 113-72 at Miami (Fla.) on Monday, they nearly flipped the score with a 112-72 win against Division III Purchase in their home opener Thursday.  Terrence Brown scored a game high 24 points for FDU and Jo'el Emanuel added 16 points.  ""We want to be up tempo and play free,"" FDU coach Jack Castleberry said.

The Mountaineers (1-1), fresh off blowing out an NAIA opponent this week, face Wisconsin on the road at Madison, Wisc. The Badgers (2-0) also have victories over lesser opponents to open the season.   Appalachian State coach Dustin Kerns wasn't as impressed about the score in his team's 108-54 win over St. Andrews of North Carolina on Wednesday as he was with the degree of effort.   ""It doesn't matter your opponent,"" Kerns said. ""You've got to play the right way, have the habits of being unselfish, making tough plays, like Myles Tate diving on a loose ball four times in the first half. That has nothing to do with your opponent.""   In nine minutes on Wednesday, Tate made the only shot he took, a 3-pointer, after netting 21 points in the Mountaineers' season-opening 77-63 loss to Miami (Ohio) on Monday, but he made four steals.   Appalachian State freshman Michael Marcus Jr. racked up 18 points, 10 rebounds and four blocks to lead the win over St. Andrews.   ""I really wanted to see our habits improve -- 23 assists, six turnovers, I thought was really good,"" Kerns said, after his team had 19 giveaways vs. 11 assists in Monday's defeat.   Appalachian State defeated visiting Auburn of the Southeastern Conference 69-64 last season, and edged host Louisville of the Atlantic Coast Conference 61-60 early in the 2022-23 season. The Badgers are the only power conference school on Appalachian State's regular-season schedule.   Wisconsin overpowered visiting Holy Cross 85-61 in its season opener, but not before falling behind by 16 points nearly midway through the first half.   The Badgers were also big favorites at home against Montana State on Thursday and prevailed 79-67, but the Bobcats were within four points for most of the first half before Max Klesmit carried Wisconsin the rest of the way.

It will be the school's fifth game against a power conference opponent since they made the move to Division I for the 2021-22 season, and it might just be their best chance to win. Oklahoma State had to fight tooth and nail to beat coach Doug Gottlieb's Green Bay squad in the Cowboys' season opener on Monday, needing a decisive second half after entering the break only up by a point. They ended up outscoring Green Bay by 12 in the second half for a 13-point victory, but it wasn't exactly the night first-year coach Steve Lutz and the Cowboys were looking for. ""I know that we were great in rebounding, we were great at shooting free throws, we took care of the ball for the most part, but you're not going to be able to play that kind of defense and win in the Big 12,"" Lutz said. ""You're just not. You're kidding yourself if you think that's going to happen."" Senior guard Bryce Thompson led the Cowboys in their win over Green Bay with 22 points on 9-of-13 shooting along with five rebounds. Senior forward Abou Ousmane added 16 points and eight rebounds, while Davonte Davis and Marchelus Avery added 10 points apiece.  Oklahoma State had a 19-3 edge on offensive rebounds and shot 21 of 24 from the charity stripe. The Cowboys had a bit more trouble defensively, allowing Green Bay to shoot 49.0 percent (25 of 41) from the field. St. Thomas' last game also came against Green Bay and surprisingly, they had a more convincing crack at them on Friday. The Tommies got out to a 20-point lead before halftime but took their foot of the gas in the second half, still walking away with a 14-point victory, one point better than Oklahoma State did four days before. Junior guard Miles Barnstable led the charge for the Tommies over Green Bay with a 23-point performance while his backcourt partner Kendall Blue added 17 points. Senior guard Ryan Dufault added 14 points off the bench on 6 of 8 from the field.  The Tommies' win over Green Bay was their second game of the season, as they beat Division III foe North Central (Minn.) by 25 in the season opener. Barnstable led the team in scoring in that game as well with 16 points, bringing his average across the first two games to 19.5. Gottlieb came away impressed with the program St. Thomas coach Johnny Tauer is building. ""We knew how well-coached this team was,"" Gottlieb said. ""(Tauer's) been doing this to people for a long time, and I think our guys respected St. Thomas but we didn't have the disposition. ""They're expertly coached in spacing.

Kaliakmanis completed 17 of 33 passes for 240 yards against the Golden Gophers, for whom he played two seasons, including in 2023 when he threw 14 touchdowns in 12 games. Rutgers improved to 5-4, 2-4 in the Big Ten in snapping a four-game losing streak. Kaliakmanis threw a pair of first-half TDs to Dymere Miller before Rutgers' defense set up the go-ahead score that gave the Scarlet Knights a 23-16 lead. On first-and-16 from the Minnesota 6-yard line, tight end Jameson Geers fumbled when he was hit by Tyreem Powell at the 10 and Shaquan Loyal recovered. Two plays after the fumble, Rutgers' Strong cut up the middle and was left open for an easy TD pass when Minnesota defensive back Ethan Robinson backed off. Following Strong's go-ahead score, the Scarlet Knights increased their lead when Jordan Walker sacked Max Brosmer in the end zone for a safety with 6:53 left, and Jay Patel kicked a 22-yard field goal with 2:45 remaining. Brosmer finished 27 of 45 for 262 yards and Geers had eight catches for 73 yards, but Darius Taylor was held to 28 rushing yards on 10 carries as the Golden Gophers (6-4, 4-3) saw their four-game winning streak stopped. Rutgers earned the win despite missing star running back Kyle Monangai due to undisclosed injury that hampered him in its loss at Southern California two weeks ago. Antwan Raymond replaced Monangai and finished with 73 yards on 22 carries. The Scarlet Knights held a 14-9 lead by halftime thanks to two TDs to Miller. Miller made a diving 1-yard catch with 3:31 left in the first quarter on fourth down for a 7-6 lead. After Minnesota ended the first period with a 9-7 lead on a 51-yard field goal by Dragan Kesich, Miller hauled in a 17-yard TD with 9:54 left in the second quarter. Minnesota regained the lead on its first series of the second half when Brosmer rolled out for a 17-yard pass to Marcus Major with 9:07 left in the third quarter. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Zach Benson and Tage Thompson scored first-period goals for the Sabres, who have won three in a row for the second time this season. Matt Coronato and Mikael Backlund scored goals, MacKenzie Weegar had two assists and Dan Vladar made 17 saves for the Flames, who have lost seven of nine (2-5-2). The Sabres took an early lead after Jacob Bryson's shot from the right point hit the skate of Calgary defenseman Kevin Bahl, redirecting the puck into the slot. Benson was there to backhand the puck into the net for a 1-0 lead at 1:11, his second straight game with a goal. Buffalo went on the first power play of the game when Martin Pospisil flipped the puck over the glass for a delay-of-game penalty. Thompson scored on the ensuing power play with a one-timer from the left circle to make it 2-0 at 13:37. It was the 10th goal of the season for Thompson and the 139th of his Buffalo career, tying him with Jack Eichel for 20th on the all-time list. Rasmus Dahlin earned his 235th career assist on the play to pass Alexei Zhitnik for the third-most assists by a defenseman in Sabres history. The Flames, who have been outscored 17-8 in the first period this season, cut it to 2-1 at 17:44 of the second period. Blake Coleman intercepted an outlet pass in the neutral zone, skated into the Buffalo zone and dropped the puck for Weegar, who carried it into the high slot before taking a shot that was redirected into the net by Coronato for his fifth goal of the season. The Flames tied it 2-2 at 15:42 of the third. Weegar retrieved a blocked shot below the goal line and made a backhand pass out to Backlund in the left circle and he scored with a one-timer, helping the Flames reach overtime for a third straight game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

A 16-point third quarter lifted the Eagles (5-4, 2-3 ACC), who broke a three-game skid in a game of vastly contrasting styles. Anchored by Robichaux (28 carries, 198 yards, two touchdowns) and McDonald (15 carries, 133 yards, one touchdown), Boston College logged 313 of its 378 total yards on 51 rushing attempts. Quarterbacks Thomas Castellanos and Grayson James combined for just 65 yards through the air, but both threw touchdowns. Kyle McCord threw for 392 of Syracuse's 431 total yards during a 31-for-48, two-touchdown performance. Jackson Meeks (105 yards) and Oronde Gadsden II (102) were 100-yard receivers for the Orange (6-3, 3-3). LeQuint Allen scored on a 4-yard run to finish an eight-play drive turning Syracuse's 14-0 deficit into a 21-14 lead with 8:36 left in the third quarter. With James quarterbacking, Robichaux's third run in a 49-second span -- aided by an unnecessary roughness penalty -- tied the score at 21. The go-ahead points came on the next play from scrimmage when Donovan Ezeirauku strip-sacked McCord and knocked the ball through the end zone for the first Boston College safety since 2012. The ensuing drive spanned 12 plays and 67 yards in 6:55, ending with McDonald bouncing to the left for a 13-yard touchdown in the final minute. Syracuse covered 75 yards on its own 10-play drive to start the fourth, moving within 30-28 on McCord's 12-yard pass to Darrell Gill Jr. The Eagles ensured their lead with 6:51 remaining in regulation as James faked a handoff and found a wide-open Jeremiah Franklin for an 18-yard touchdown on fourth-and-1. After Liam Connor missed a 29-yard field-goal attempt on Boston College's opening drive of the game, Quintavious Hutchins recovered Allen's fumble on the following series. The host Eagles scored first on Robichaux's 34-yard run down the right side with 2:43 left in the first. Two series later, the hosts doubled their lead after forcing McCord to throw an incomplete fourth-down pass. Five straight McDonald rushes set up Castellanos for his first completed pass of the game -- a 9-yard touchdown to Lewis Bond. McCord led back-to-back touchdown drives to make it 14-14 at halftime. The Ohio State transfer hit Gadsden for big bookending plays, scoring on a 17-yard pass to the right. After the Eagles went three-and-out, McCord's 25-yard run and a connection with Meeks helped Allen find the end zone on a 3-yard run with 2:10 left before intermission. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The Current advanced to the semifinals where they will face the No. 1 seed Orlando Pride, who earned a 4-1 victory over the Chicago Red Stars in a quarterfinal match Friday. Chawinga, the NWSL's record-breaking goal scorer, returned from a knee injury to score the lone goal of the quarterfinal match. Casey Murphy saved the initial shot by Chawinga and the ball settled at the feet of Vanessa DiBernardo. The midfielder's follow-up shot went off the post and back to the feet of Chawinga, whose first shot was blocked by Kaleigh Kurtz but left a wide-open net on the second attempt. That gives Chawinga 21 goals in NWSL action, adding to an already impressive freshman campaign from the newcomer. North Carolina nearly tied the match in the 32nd minute, when Almuth Schult made a diving save and pinned the ball down with her glove. Manaka Matsukubo ran up and kicked the ball into the net from under the goalkeeper's palm, but the referee blew the whistle because Schult had possession of the ball by holding it against the grass. Kansas City's win featured its offensive firepower, despite the low final score with the Current taking 14 shots in the win and five on target. North Carolina had three saves in goal and three blocks to keep the match close.  In the seventh minute of stoppage time, Chawinga tackled the ball away from Bianca St. Georges and went to the ground. St. Georges responded by standing over the forward.

""I said (to my agent), 'No worries, I'm happy with where I'm at, but it's always nice to know.'"" Day told Code Sports Australia ahead of this month's Australian PGA Championship. ""And they (LIV Golf) said, ‘We love Jason, but he's too injured; he just gets too many injuries.' I don't blame them."" Day won the 2015 PGA Championship and spent 47 consecutive weeks atop the Official World Golf Ranking from 2016-17. However, Day began to suffer from chronic lower back injuries and ultimately dropped as low as 175th in the rankings to begin 2023. The back issues even had him contemplate retirement. The lack of an offer to even consider a move to LIV turned out to be blessing in disguise for Day, who watched fellow Australian Cameron Smith make the jump in the fall of 2022. After working with noted coach Chris Como to revamp his swing, Day finally snapped a five-year winless streak with a victory at last year's Byron Nelson.

Jaylen Brown scored 30 points and Payton Pritchard came off the bench to add 28 points with eight 3-pointers when host Boston beat Milwaukee 119-108 on Oct. 28. The Bucks led 80-79 before the Celtics went on an 18-2 run that began late in the third quarter and extended into the fourth.   Brown's status for Sunday's matchup is uncertain. He has not played in Boston's last four games because of a strained left hip flexor. The Celtics were also without center Luke Kornet during Friday night's 108-104 overtime victory against the Brooklyn Nets because of right hamstring tightness.   ""(They're) day to day, like the rest of us,"" Boston coach Joe Mazzulla said. ""(Brown is) getting better. Getting a little bit better each day. Getting there.""   Damian Lillard led the Bucks with 33 points, seven rebounds and seven assists in the loss to Boston. Giannis Antetokounmpo finished with 30 points, 10 rebounds and six assists.   Milwaukee ended a six-game losing streak by defeating the Utah Jazz 123-100 on Thursday, but dropped a 116-94 decision to the New York Knicks on the road Friday night.  Antetokounmpo had 24 points and 12 rebounds against the Knicks, but was clearly frustrated with Milwaukee's effort level during the loss, which dropped Milwaukee's road record to 1-5.   ""At the end of the day, we've got to compete,"" Antetokounmpo said after Friday's game. ""Teams are not just going to give us games. They're not going to feel bad for us.   ""We've got to compete every single possession. Every loose ball, we've got to get a body on the floor and put it on the line. But we didn't compete at all. ... We've got Boston in two days. We don't compete, we're going to lose by 30.""   Boston's OT victory over Brooklyn on Friday came two days after the Celtics absorbed a 118-112 home loss to the Golden State Warriors. Jayson Tatum collected 33 points and nine rebounds in Friday's win. Pritchard finished with 20 points, including six in overtime.   ""It was kind of one of those ugly, grind-it-out games,"" Mazzulla said. ""We gave up some stuff that we have to get better at, but you had to earn any basket. You had to earn it on both ends of the floor, and I thought we did that, especially toward the end of the game.""   The Celtics shot a season-low 26.4 percent from 3-point territory against Brooklyn (14 of 53). Sam Hauser was 2 of 10 on 3-point attempts, and Derrick White was 1 of 6 from behind the arc.   ""I don't think it's very hard (to maintain confidence), just because we know the type of shooters that we have,"" Boston's Al Horford said. ""We work at this every day, and those are shots that we have to take. ""We had a lot of good looks, and you just have to take them and trust in your process. And I always just think back on our work, on our preparation when we have any kind of ruts like this.""   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The NWSL's record-breaking goal scorer returned from a knee injury to score the lone goal of the match. Casey Murphy saved the initial shot by Chawinga and the ball settled at the feet of Vanessa DiBernardo. The midfielder's follow-up shot went off the post and back to the feet of Chawinga, whose first shot was blocked by Kaleigh Kurtz but left a wide-open net on the second attempt. That gives Chawinga 21 goals in NWSL action, adding to an already impressive freshman campaign from the newcomer. North Carolina nearly tied the match in the 32nd minute, when Almuth Schult made a diving save and pinned the ball down with her glove. Manaka Matsukubo ran up and kicked the ball into the net from under the goalkeeper's palm, but the referee blew the whistle because Schult had possession of the ball by holding it against the grass. Kansas City's win featured its offensive firepower, despite the low final score with the Current taking 14 shots in the win and five on target. North Carolina had three saves in goal and three blocks to keep the match close.  In the seventh minute of stoppage time, Chawinga tackled the ball away from Bianca St. Georges and went to the ground. St. Georges responded by standing over the forward. Ellis Wheeler ran up behind St. Georges and pushed her to the ground for the gesture, earning a yellow card.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Johnson scored a game-high 18 points and fought through his defender to hoist up a last-second shot that was upheld upon review.   Will Richardson added 11 points for Fordham (1-1), which bounced back from a 32-point defeat to another Big East team, St. John's.   Yacine Toumi scored a team-high 12 points on perfect 5-for-5 shooting for Seton Hall (1-1) before fouling out in the final three minutes.   With Seton Hall struggling through a 2-for-13 shooting stretch, Prince Aligbe scored a driving layup out of a timeout to put the Pirates ahead 55-52, and Seton Hall's Chaunce Jenkins added one free throw with 22 seconds left.   Richardson tossed up a 3-pointer and Aligbe was whistled for a shooting foul, though replay showed he neither touched the defender nor interfered in his landing spot. Richardson made all three foul shots to make it a one-point game.   Seton Hall got the ball in, but Algibe's pass to the baseline glanced off Dylan Addae-Wusu's fingertips and out of bounds with 11 seconds left. Fordham called timeout and drew up the winning play.   Aligbe had 10 points and seven rebounds for the Pirates, who outshot the Rams 40.7 percent to 36.5 percent.   Six quick points from Toumi helped Seton Hall build a 14-7 lead, but Fordham kept it within five for the rest of the first half.   Richardson made his second 3-pointer of the day at the 3:38 mark, but Seton Hall picked up the pace and Addae-Wusu knocked down one of his own nine seconds later to restore a four-point advantage. Godswill Erheriene got a layup to fall in the final seconds to put the Pirates up 32-28 at halftime.   Johnson started the second half 3-for-3 from the field, his back-to-back triples and game-tying layup pulling Fordham level at 38-38.

The Rockets rank among the top 10 in opponents' scoring (108.9 points allowed per game) and defensive field-goal percentage (45.4), yet it didn't look that way Friday when they were blown out by the Oklahoma City Thunder. After trailing by 29 points in the second quarter, the Rockets walked away with a 126-107 defeat. Houston had won four of its previous five games with the lone loss in that stretch coming in overtime last weekend against the Golden State Warriors. ""That's what's disappointing about it,"" Rockets coach Ime Udoka said. ""I felt like we were back on our heels. (Shai) Gilgeous-Alexander and (Chet) Holmgren, and to some extent Jalen Williams, got whatever they wanted a little too easily. Credit to them. They have some good one-on-one players and they beat our one-on-one defense."" Gilgeous-Alexander had 29 points while going 11-for-16 from the field. Holmgren also scored 29 points in 29 minutes and Williams tossed in 14 points while making 7 of 11 shots. Overall, the Rockets watched the Thunder to shoot 51.1 percent from the field and forced just 10 turnovers. ""Our communication wasn't great, also our physicality,"" Rockets center Steven Adams said. ""They were very comfortable out there. So, we need to get up into them. They were being physical with us, and we're kind of just going through like the motions. You're kind of caught like a shootaround, like you're just going through the play."" Houston was outscored 44-20 in the second quarter. ""Couldn't get stops and failed to score,"" Udoka said. ""Minus-24 in that quarter. To give up 44 in a quarter, you've got to at least get it back on the other end and keep it close."" The game on Sunday is the front end of a back-to-back for the Rockets, who have won their last five matchups with the Pistons. They return home to face the Washington Wizards on Monday. Houston has shown a versatile offense with seven players averaging double figures. The Pistons are more reliant on star Cade Cunningham (22.8 points per gam), although they do have four other double-digit scorers among an improved supporting cast this season. Detroit has won three of its last four games and Cunningham carries a streak of three consecutive triple-doubles into Sunday's contest. He had 22 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists in a 122-121 home win over the Atlanta Hawks on Friday. The Pistons led by 24 in the first half, then gave away the lead during crunch time. Cunningham scored the game-winner on a running hook shot with 8.5 seconds remaining, then made a game-saving block to preserve the victory. ""He's the guy. He has the ability to be the guy on an elite basketball team because of all the things he's capable of doing,"" Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""He can manipulate the game. He can score, he makes his teammates better, he rebounds. He's proven that he can defend and make defensive plays as well."" The Pistons were coming off a one-point loss to the Charlotte Hornets that was decided on a last-second tip-in. Cunningham prevented another heartbreaking defeat. ""In spurts, we were awesome,"" Bickerstaff said. ""In other spurts, we were the opposite of that. But the guys stayed together throughout the whole thing and just figured out a way down the stretch to make the plays to win the game. We just made one more play than they did."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Kidd, a 6-foot-10 center who is in his first season with Miami, will lead the host Hurricanes (1-0) in a nonconference game against Binghamton (1-1) on Sunday afternoon. Kidd started all 33 of Virginia Tech's games last season, averaging a career-high 13.2 points while ranking third nationally in shooting percentage (66.8). On Monday, Kidd scored 24 points following a 10-for-11 shooting performance in a 113-72 season-opening win over Fairleigh Dickinson. ""I work on it all the time,"" Kidd said of his shooting. ""When you do something a thousand times, over and over, it's just normal."" Including Kidd, Miami's top five players all started their careers at other schools: guards Nijel Pack (Kansas State) and Jalen Blackmon (Stetson); wing Matthew Cleveland (Florida State) and forward Brandon Johnson (East Carolina). Pack (6-foot) and Blackmon (6-2) are elite scorers, but Miami coach Jim Larranaga worries about their size defensively and on the boards. On the flip side, Pack is a great leader. ""During timeouts, I ask Nijel, ‘What do you want to run,'"" Larranaga said. ""He's our Tom Brady."" As for Cleveland, he missed 17 days of preseason practice due to injury, but he scored nine points in the opener. Last season, he averaged 13.7 points and 6.1 rebounds. Johnson averaged 14.0 points and 8.6 rebounds last season. Meanwhile, Binghamton has been predicted to finish seventh in the 10-team America East Conference after going 15-15, 7-9 last season. The Bearcats are led by Tymu Chenery, their lone returning starter. Chenery, a 6-6 senior guard, averaged a team-high 14.9 points last season. So far this season, he is averaging 11.5 points and a team-high 6.0 rebounds. The team's leading scorer is Ben Callahan-Gold, who played last season for Trinity College, an NCAA Division III school. Callahan-Gold, a 6-8, 220-pound forward, is averaging 13.5 points. Last season, he averaged 16.7 points for 30-2 Trinity. Callahan-Gold scored a game-high 21 points on Thursday in Binghamton's 82-63 win over Oneonta.

We had 15 assists on 27 baskets, so we were moving the ball pretty well, and we could probably move the ball even more and we'll continue to do that as we grow as a team.""

We scored well off turnovers. We had putbacks."" May said Wolf's numbers were impressive, in part, based on the Wolverines' ability to spread out the production.

But Chelsea could be without virtuoso attacker Cole Palmer, who has seven goals and five assists but hasn't trained since he was on the receiving end of Lisandro Martinez's crunching tackle in last weekend's draw with Manchester United.

Bu,"Japanese right-hander Roki Sasaki is set to enter free agency after the Chiba Lotte Marines confirmed his posting process was underway on Saturday. But his posting process, because of his prowess and age, will be more nuanced than others.  Sasaki, 23, is viewed as having one of the top young arms in the world with a 100 mph fastball and deadly sinker.  But barring a change in Nippon Professional Baseball guidelines that limit Sasaki to signing a minor league deal in MLB, he could choose to remain in Japan.  Sasaki indicated in a post to X on Saturday that he's ready to be tested in Major League Baseball, thanking his Japanese team for allowing him to post. If he exits Japan, it would be on a similar timeframe Shohei Ohtani followed when he first entered MLB with the Los Angeles Angels.   ""There were many things that did not go well during my five years with the Marines, but I was able to get to this point by concentrating only on baseball, with the support of my teammates, staff, front office, and fans. I will do my best to work my way up from my minor contract to become the best player in the world, so that I will have no regrets in my one and only baseball career and live up to the expectations of everyone who has supported me."" By waiting until he's entering his age 25 season in 2026, Sasaki could've been in position to cash in with an enormous initial contract like the one Yoshinobu Yamamoto signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers for 12 years and $325 million last December. In Sasaki's case, the Chiba Lotte Marines can claim 20 percent of Sasaki's contract. International bonus pools are hard-capped near $7 million per team.  Teams are allowed to trade for bonus pool money to increase the amount they can pay international players on minor-league deals, but most enter free agency sitting on between $4 million and $6.5 million total. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Waring's 54-hole total of 18-under is good enough to take a one-shot lead into the final round at Yas Links, with Niklas Norgaard of Denmark right behind him at 17-under par following a round of 69.  Tommy Fleetwood (71) of England, Shane Lowry (66) of Ireland, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen (71) and Sweden's Sebastian Soderberg (68) are tied for third at 15-under. Waring, an Englishman, can blame his 73 on his putter. After a birdie on the second hole, he had 8 feet remaining for a birdie on the par-3 fourth hole and wound up with a bogey. He then missed birdie chances on the next nine holes before another bogey on No. 14. ""I'm a little bit disappointed. I felt like I could have put myself out of sight but four rounds of golf, you're always going to have a bit of an iffy run of holes, an iffy round of golf,"" he said. ""If beginning of the week you had given me a one-shot lead going into tomorrow, I'd have snapped your hand off. ""I'm trying to remain positive that I'm still in the lead, looking forward to getting out there tomorrow."" Six golfers are tied for seventh place at 14-under, including Belgium's Thomas Detry, who shot a career-low 62 on the DP World Tour on a 10-birdie round. His primary goal for the week is to climb into the top 50 to move on in The Race to Dubai; he entered the week No. 63 in the standings. He shot 72 and 68 in the first two rounds. ""It's been a tale of three different days; I finished horrendously on Thursday, played much better yesterday and today was just kind of everything clicked together. ""I just played really well. Didn't really miss any drivers. Pretty wide fairways out here, but I kept myself in position the whole round and obviously made a couple of great putts on my first few holes to get the momentum going and I kept going."" Northern Ireland's Rory McIlory, the Race to Dubai leader, sits at 13-under in a four-way tie for 13th place. He finished with a 69, but a bogey at No. 1 and a double bogey at No. 18, spoiled what could have been a stellar round. Waring likely will need another terrific round to win Sunday, and he acknowledged he will need to control his emotions. ""I wasn't at my best today, felt a little bit jittery in total honesty, I felt the greens were a foot-and-a-half quicker, they were breaking a bit more than what I was reading. I just struggled on them a little bit today."" He continued: ""It's a game of golf tomorrow in the sunshine -- I'm looking forward to the challenge of it now. I feel like my bad golf is out of the way now."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Olave has been ruled out for Sunday's game against the visiting Atlanta Falcons after sustaining his second concussion of the season last week versus the Carolina Panthers. He will miss at least the team's next four games as a result of the move. The injury occurred as Olave attempted to catch a pass from quarterback Derek Carr on the play at the 7:03 mark of the first quarter. As the ball sailed over Olave's head, he was sandwiched between two Carolina defenders and crumpled to the ground. Olave, 24, also was removed from the Saints' game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Oct. 13 with a concussion. He has 32 catches for 400 yards and a touchdown in eight games this season. Olave was selected 11th overall by the Saints in the 2022 NFL Draft. He began his career with back-to-back 1,000-yard receiving seasons.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",College Football's Most Overpaid Coaches Based on Results,https://deadspin.com/college-footballs-most-overpaid-coaches-based-on-results/,2024-11-09T15:25:43.499Z,"There's bad coaches all across America, but these are the most overpaid coaches in college football based on their poor results compared to massive sa","When the University of Florida made Steve Spurrier the highest-paid coach in college football history—and the game’s first million-dollar man—in 1996, there was an air of scandal surrounding the news. One million dollars? In college sports? It feels downright quaint when revisited in this era. Top-strength coaches are now joining the seven-figure club. Referencing USA Today’s database of coaching salaries, most recently updated in October 2024, 92 FBS coaches earn at least $1 million annually. Certainly, inflation from 30 years ago is a factor, but if only all professions’ pay scales swelled at the rate of coaching salaries... With that in mind, it’s not unfair to evaluate coaching tenures relative to their sizable bank accounts. Using USA Today’s findings, the following quartet stands out for delivering results that fall short of their wages. A notable omission is Penn State’s James Franklin. Franklin’s 1-10 all-time record against Ohio State is certainly a sore spot among the Nittany Lions fan base, as is the program’s inability to break through to a College Football Playoff appearance. However, the Nittany Lions have consistently finished seasons ranked in the top 10. With Franklin’s $8.5 million salary ranked as the 13th-most lucrative among coaches, Penn State’s results typically meet or exceed its coach’s paycheck. Starting with the 77th-highest paid coach in the sport may seem like an odd choice. But then, UAB hiring Trent Dilfer was an odd choice in itself, and his brief tenure has almost immediately unraveled the remarkable work of his predecessor, Bill Clark. Clark transformed the regular cellar-dweller program, which had been literally shut down early into his tenure, into a perennial bowl participant. Dilfer took over with four years of high school coaching experience at Tennessee-based Lipscomb Academy, and the Blazers immediately began to struggle. They went 4-8 last season and are 2-6 through eight games in 2024, with an average margin of defeat of 25.7 points per game. At $1.5 million per year, Dilfer is paid more than in-state counterpart Rich Rodriguez, who has won 14 games in less than two seasons at Jacksonville State. Dilfer’s UAB team also suffered a humiliating defeat this season at the hands of ULM, coached by Bryant Vincent, a former Clark assistant passed over for the Blazers job. Vincent is paid $900,000 less per year than Dilfer. As the first program ever to pay its head coach $1 million, Florida obviously takes its investment in football seriously. Those in Gainesville responsible for making such decisions also demand immediate and consistent ROI. Just ask Jim McElwain and Dan Mullen, both of whom were fired within two years of reaching an SEC Championship Game. So, with third-year Gators coach Billy Napier sporting an underwhelming 15-18 record in his tenure and headed for a possible third straight sub-.500 finish, it stands to reason that Napier was on the hot seat. His $7.37 million per year contract, ranked No. 21 in college football, is relatively modest compared to the rest of the SEC—and perhaps reflective of the massive buyout money that the program’s impatience has cost it. Mullen’s buyout came with a $12 million price tag, which Florida is paying through 2027. McElwain’s buyout totaled $7.5 million, the same rate UF initially balked at paying to Colorado State in order to hire him away from Fort Collins. One massive reason he’s back for 2025: Napier’s buyout is staggering $26.7 million. In the roughly 15 years since the end of the Pete Carroll dynasty at USC, Trojans faithful have offered no shortage of explanations as to why the program has not been able to recapture its dominance of the 2000s. NCAA sanctions in the wake of the Reggie Bush scandal—which wouldn’t even violate today’s rules—were overly punitive. The Pac-12 Conference was holding USC back. The investment in coaching salaries wasn’t competitive with the top of college football. Well, it’s been a decade since the Bush scandal sanctions lapsed. The Trojans are now members of the Big Ten, and at more than $10 million per year, Lincoln Riley is the fourth-highest paid coach in the sport and tops in the Big Ten. A promising start in 2022, with USC going 11-1 in the regular season, seemed to justify the hefty contract. Since then, however, USC has posted a combined 12-12 record, with a disappointing finish to 2022, an 8-5 record in 2023 that felt like a retread of the Clay Helton years, and a 2-5 start in 2024. The Trojans have lost to three Big Ten teams with .500 or worse league records (Washington, Michigan, and Maryland). The inclusion of Stoops, who in 2022 became Kentucky’s all-time wins leader, is tenuous. Winning with consistency at what is a firmly established basketball school is never easy—just look at the track records of Duke, Kansas, UConn, or Arizona football programs. Look, too, at Stoops’ Kentucky predecessors, most of whom have seen far more success during his tenure. Bear Bryant and his successor, Blanton Collier, are the only other Wildcats coaches post-World War II to have above-.500 records at UK. Stoops is also the ninth-highest paid head coach in the sport, making just over $9 million a year. Kentucky has finished ranked in the end-of-season Top 25 just twice during Stoops’ tenure—the most recent time, in 2021, it had its 10 wins vacated. Measured against the history of Kentucky football, Stoops is an undeniable success. However, measured against his $9 million salary, Stoops is the least accomplished among the sport’s 10 highest-paid coaches. Copyright 2024",

If you watched Florida strike fear in the Bulldogs and paid too close attention in the first half of Georgia at Alabama, we understand your trepidation in putting your toes in the water on this one. The Bulldogs (7-1, 5-1 SEC) are looking to strengthen their bid for a fourth straight conference championship game appearance and are in the top three of the initial CFP rankings for the fourth year in a row. A newer guest to the party, Ole Miss (7-2, 3-2) has appeared in four consecutive initial CFP rankings as well. But finishing in the SEC with a strong November is a steep climb. And the timing is not good for the Rebels because of injuries. Ole Miss QB Jaxson Dart knows that all too well. He was mortal in the Ole Miss loss at Georgia last season. Dart is first in the nation with 3,210 passing yards and a 192.4 passing efficiency rating. He has 21 touchdowns to just three interceptions. He’s eager to get another shot at Georgia after the 52-17 loss to the Bulldogs last season. The Rebels were 8-1 going into that game.But he’s not equipped to deal with the Georgia defense that dominated at Texas and shows well on the road. Bet: Georgia -3 (-115 DraftKings) $100,000 Daily Race Sign up now to claim For help with a gambling problem, call or text the NCPG - (1-800-522-4700)  First Bet Safety Net $1000 or Bet $5 & Get $150 Sign up now and get the choice of two incredible offers.

FC Barcelona announced the new “multi-year partnership agreement” on their website on Saturday, November 9. The club said the deal “brings a new collaborative strategic partnership model between the two organizations.” This new partnership consolidates Nike as a Main Partner of the Club and Official Technical Partner across all professional and amateur teams, bringing a unique model that strengthens the brands association and fuels the global retail and licensing business growth. Nike has a key strategic role in the Club’s Retail Operations and together with Barça Licensing & Merchandising will join forces in the development of specific plans related to product creation, supply chain and global distribution.   Nike has outfitted Barça since 1998. Since then, Barça’s men’s first team has won four Champions League titles, 12 La Liga titles, seven Copas del Rey, three World Club Cups and three European Super Cups wearing Nike uniforms, while the women’s first team has won nine league titles, three UEFA Women’s Champions League titles and nine Copas de la Reina in that time. The terms of the deal between Barça and Nike were not disclosed in Saturday’s announcement, but ESPN reports “the deal will total significantly more than €100 million ($107m) per year, but that the agreement is incremental and that the total amount is also dependent on certain add-ons.” They also report that Barça president Joan Laporte has previously claimed it would be the biggest deal of its kind in world soccer. According to Mundo Deportivo, Barça will receive €1.7 billion over 14 years, or about €121 million per year. It also includes a signing bonus of €158 million, which will also be spread over the 14 years of the contract. Mundo Deportivo also reports that Barça was allowed to field offers from other companies, and they did receive a proposal from German sportswear brand Puma, which Nike then matched. The previous contract between Nike and Barça was set to expire in 2024. There was some friction between the two sides earlier this year, with Footy Headlines reporting in July that a Spanish court had blocked Barça’s attempted to end their contract early. They also reported that retailers were having a hard time ordering Barcelona products from Nike, and Barça’s 2024-25 third kit celebrating women’s sport was released about three weeks later than similar third kits for other high-profile clubs outfitted by Nike.",

After the 1999 season, the team moved 20 miles east to the town of Kodak, where they played from 2000 to 2024 as the Tennessee Smokies.

New look from a familiar era. Get your City Edition Jersey 11.14.24 pic.twitter.com/svaZdznsxa The white uniforms feature a slanted “H-Town” wordmark across the chest that is inspired by the uniforms worn by Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler during those championships seasons, particularly the lowercase “t.” The red and blue striping pattern on the collar, shoulders, sides of the jerseys and – most notably – around the shorts mirrors the shape and trimming of the Rockets’ championship banners, which hang in the rafters at Toyota Center. The logo on the side of the shorts matches the center-court logo at The Summit, Houston’s home from 1975-2003. It was where the Rockets clinched their titles with a Game 7 victory over the New York Knicks in 1994 and a sweep of the Orlando Magic in 1995. The logo matches Houston’s primary logo at the time, but also includes a “Summit” wordmark at the bottom. The Summit’s logo – which is reminiscent of the Portland Trail Blazers’ logo – can also be seen in gold on the waistband of the shorts, matching the Nike swoosh on the shoulder and hip. The uniforms are complete with Olajuwon and Drexler’s signatures and a “Believe It! Again!” wordmark, which is a nod to the team’s rally cry during their second title run, above the jock tag. This marks the second straight year the Hall of Famers’ signatures are included in Houston’s City Edition design. The Rockets will wear their new City Edition uniforms 13 times this season, including against the Indiana Pacers on Nov. 20, Blazers on Nov. 23, Minnesota Timberwolves on Dec. 27, Los Angeles Lakers on Jan. 5, Phoenix Suns on Feb. 13, Golden State Warriors on Feb. 13, Milwaukee Bucks on Feb. 25, San Antonio Spurs on Feb. 26, Magic on March 10, Suns on March 12, Philadelphia 76ers on March 17, Denver Nuggets on March 23 and Oklahoma City Thunder on April 4.",

The Rangers unveiled the jerseys on their website and social media accounts on Friday, November 8, making this the 19th straight season the team has produced a Remembrance Day jersey. This year’s edition commemorates the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Normandy — better known as D-Day — which took place on June 6, 1944. The base of the jersey is royal blue, with grey, red and white stripes around each sleeve and the waist. The front of the jersey features a shield “based on imagery of soldiers entering the battle on the beaches of Normandy,” according to the Rangers’ website. Above the blue soldier rushing off a landing craft is the inscription “1944-2024”, while three red maple leaves swirl around the soldier. The 1944 Battle of Normandy was one of the pivotal events of the Second World War and the scene of some of Canada’s greatest feats of arms. Canadian sailors, soldiers and airmen played a critical role in the Allied invasion of Normandy, also called Operation Overlord, beginning the bloody campaign to liberate Western Europe from Nazi occupation. Nearly 150,000 Allied troops landed or parachuted into the invasion area on D-Day, including 14,000 Canadians at Juno Beach. The Royal Canadian Navy contributed 124 vessels and 10,000 sailors and the Royal Canadian Air Force contributed 39 squadrons to the operation. Total Allied casualties on D-Day reached more than 10,000, including 1,096 Canadians, of whom 381 were killed in action. By the end of the Battle of Normandy, the Allies had suffered 209,000 casualties, including more than 18,700 Canadians. Over 5,000 Canadian soldiers died. A poppy sits on the left chest of the jersey as a symbol of remembrance honoring armed forces personnel who have died in conflict. The left shoulder has a “D-DAY 80” logo while the Rangers’ primary logo sits on the right shoulder. The jersey was pictured with blue pants, gloves and helmets in photos released with Friday’s announcement. The socks are also blue with the same striping as found on the sleeves. The Rangers will wear their Remembrance Day jerseys tonight (Friday, November 8) when they host the Soo Greyhounds at the Kitchener Memorial Auditorium. It’s their only home game this Remembrance Day weekend, as they visit the Owen Sound Attack on Saturday and the Oshawa Generals on Sunday. Rangers fans can purchase game-worn Remembrance Day jerseys through a silent auction that will run throughout Friday’s game. Five of the jerseys will also be available for auction online through DASH. Proceeds from both auctions will benefit the 78th Fraser Highlanders Fort Conestoga Garrison and the Kitchener-Waterloo Poppy Fund.",

The Moose unveiled the jersey on their website and social media channels on Thursday, November 7, and they’ll wear them on the ice for the first time on Saturday, November 23, when they host the Chicago Wolves. The focal point of the jerseys is the team’s classic “Happy Moose” logo, which appears on the front of the jersey recolored in the team’s current color palette. The Moose used a green and purple version of this logo when they were members of the International Hockey League from 1996 to 2001, and then a green and black version from 2001, when they moved to the AHL, until 2005. In 2011, the Winnipeg Jets brought NHL hockey back to the city, meaning the Moose moved to St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, where they were renamed the St. John’s IceCaps. But in 2015, the team moved back to Winnipeg and the Moose name and logo were revived, but the logo was recolored to match the Jets’ palette. The base of the 25th season celebration jersey is bright blue, with a navy blue collar and shoulder yoke. Navy blue, silver and white stripes run around each sleeve and the waist. The front of the jersey also includes a “25 SEASONS” patch with a map of Manitoba on the left chest. The Jets’ logo appears on the left shoulder, while an “MM” monogram appears on the right shoulder. “EST. 1996” is printed inside the collar. The numbers on the sleeves and back match those found on the Moose’s regular jerseys, with moose antlers built into the numerals. Along with the jerseys, the Moose also launched a line of 25th season merchandise on their online shop Thursday. This line includes hoodies, sweatshirts, caps, pucks and pins. The Moose will wear the 25th season celebration jerseys four times during the 2024-25 AHL regular season. At each of these games, the first 1,000 fans will receive one of four collector pins featuring either one of the team’s primary logos from past 25 years or the team’s 25th season logo.

The PWHL launched new jersey designs for all six of its clubs on Thursday, November 7, all manufactured by Bauer. The league’s press release from the league focused heavily on the dark jerseys that will be worn for home games, but light away jerseys — either white or off-white — were also included in some teams’ social media posts. After teams played the 2024 season using just their geographic names, the PWHL unveiled team names and logos in early September. The teams retained the primary colours they wore during the PWHL’s inaugural season, though some added additional colours. “Players and fans alike have been waiting for this moment and we couldn’t be happier with the six unique looks each team will don moving forward,” said Amy Scheer, PWHL Senior Vice President of Business Operations, on the league’s website. “These jerseys mark the latest evolution in our league’s history, and we can’t wait to see them showcased both on the ice and in the stands.”  Each team will have contrasting shoulder yokes, with the PWHL logo on the right shoulder and space for advertising patches on the left shoulder and right chest. Each team also has an insert at the front of the collar with the PWHL logo inside. Teams will all use the same block number font, but each will have small team-specific icons in the numbers. Each jersey incorporates elements that embody the spirit of the team, all while supporting athletes on the ice with advanced materials and construction. Through a series of design sessions, unique elements such as stripe size, number style, and the crest were meticulously developed to enhance their identities. Crafted from breathable and durable fabrics, these jerseys are engineered to withstand intense physical play and offer a tailored fit for maximum mobility, comfort, and aesthetic appeal. The PWHL worked closely with Creative Agency Flower Shop in creating the jersey designs as part of the overall team brand identity work.  The jersey design process was led by PWHL Vice President of Brand and Marketing Kanan Bhatt-Shah and done in collaboration with New York-based creative agency Flower Shop, which also worked on the team names and logos. Here’s a closer look at the new jerseys and what the league had to say about them in Thursday’s announcement: Anchored by the team’s signature “B” across the chest, the Fleet’s home jersey features a deep green base, complemented by oceanic blue accents on the shoulders, sleeve stripes, and waist. The classic hockey design incorporates alternating bands of color, forming a wave-like pattern that evokes a strong connection to the sea. The numbers on Boston’s jersey carry a unique wave motif inspired by the crest, further reinforcing its maritime heritage.  The Frost’s home jersey embraces the chill with a deep purple base that channels the spirit of Minnesota winters. White accents on the shoulders, arms, and waist add a crisp, icy contrast, capturing the sharpness of the frozen landscape. Light purple details introduce a modern touch, blending seamlessly to create a layered, frosted look that embodies both the intensity and elegance of the Frost on the ice. The jersey numbers feature a motif inspired by the shape of the team’s crest, bringing a distinct edge to the design.  Anchored by the burgundy base, the Victoire’s home jersey reflects Montréal’s timeless elegance and strength. The navy shoulders and dynamic sleeve design draw inspiration from the angular lines of the team’s crest, adding a sense of movement and precision. A bright blue stripe accents the overall design, providing a vivid contrast while maintaining a classic style that honors the heritage of both the city and team. The jersey numbers are adorned with a Fleur-de-lys motif, reinforcing Montréal’s cultural pride.  Inspired by the hexagonal shape of their team crest, the Sirens’ home jersey captures the spirit of New York’s multifaceted energy. Angular sleeve stripes, echoing the crest’s geometric form, combine the city’s signature navy, orange, and grey hues, creating a striking, modern motif. The lower waist reflects the same hexagonal pattern, grounding the design in New York’s intense and dynamic identity. The numbers on New York’s jersey feature linework inspired by sound vibrations, echoing the city’s constant hum and buzz.  The Charge’s home jersey energizes the ice with its vibrant red base, embodying Ottawa’s unyielding drive. Dark and light grey bands run across the sleeves and waist, adding depth and a sense of momentum, while a bold pop of electric yellow pulses through the design. The overall look captures the energy and intensity that defines the Charge’s fierce presence on the ice. Custom numbers on the jersey incorporate small electrical charges, adding a spark to the back of the jersey.  The Sceptres’ home jersey reflects a modern, confident Toronto, with a rich blue base that captures the city’s leadership and pride. Navy paneling along the sleeves and waist brings depth and contrast, while clean, precise yellow lines and a matching collar add sharp, dynamic details. The striking gold and yellow of the team crest stands out, creating a look with bold presence, embodying the energy and spirit of Toronto fans. Custom numbers nod to the Sceptres’ crest design. Last season, the PWHL ran a pilot project during which Molson Breweries paid to place its logo on the upper back of jerseys, allowing nameplates to be placed under the numbers where they wouldn’t be covered by players’ long hair. Based on the photos released with Thursday’s announcement, it appears this pilot project will not continue in the upcoming season. PWHL home jerseys are available to buy now on the league’s official online shop. They’ll be available through Bauer’s website and key retailers starting on Thursday, November 14. The 2024-25 PWHL regular season begins on Saturday, November 30, when the Boston Fleet visit the Toronto Sceptres at the Coca-Cola Coliseum at 2 p.m. ET. Later that same day is an all-Canadian matchup between the Ottawa Charge and the Victoire de Montréal at Place Bell in Laval, Quebec. The defending champion Minnesota Frost open their season on Sunday, December 1, when they host the New York Sirens at the Xcel Energy Center.",

The Crows launched the new logo on their website and social media channels on Wednesday, November 6. It depicts the full body of a navy blue swooping crow — a throwback to previous logos in the club’s history and a stark contrast to the most recent iteration of their logo, which only depicted a crow’s head — with a gold outline, red and gold streaks in the wings and a red eye. The angles of the logo are sharper than the previous version, and the color scheme returns to the club’s “original bolder colors,” including a darker shade of navy blue, a “richer” red and a “deeper” gold. The logo is a celebration of the Club being born from the state’s thriving football landscape in 1990, with the wing of the Crow emanating from the actual shape of South Australia. In a further change, the word ‘Adelaide’ now solely sits below the crow and reinforces the connection between the Club, the city and state.  The new Crows logo was developed in partnership with Fuller Brand Communication, a creative agency based in South Australia. The process involved “widespread consultation with members, supporters and focus groups, such as the Member Engagement Panel.” The Crows’ logo was last revamped in 2010. Their first crest upon joining the AFL in 1991 featured a crow with swooping red, yellow and blue lines behind it inside a white shield with a red outline; “ADELAIDE” and “CROWS” were written out above the crow in yellow on a navy background. In 1996, the writing was changed to emphasize the city name. Then, from 1999-2009, the club ditched the shield and used the crow with the swooping lines behind on its own, with the team name in navy underneath. “The logo is one of the Club’s most recognisable features and our supporters take great pride in it, and the throwback to the original swooping Crow reinforces our connection to this city and state by the way it now incorporates the actual shape of South Australia,” said Crows CEO Tim Silvers on the team’s website. “We also wanted to make sure we celebrated our heritage but with a modern look and feel, which we think will resonate with our next generation of supporters. We’ve consulted and listened to a wide range of stakeholders, including and most importantly sections of our supporter base, over the past 18 months.  “Now is the perfect time to make this change as our new headquarters at Thebarton Oval is moving closer and closer to reality, so it really is the start of a new era.”  New guernseys were not unveiled as part of Wednesday’s announcement. But merchandise with the new logo is already available on the Crows’ official website and at the team shop in the Adelaide suburb of West Lakes. The Crows are the first of three teams who were reported to be unveiling new logos this offseason to do so. The other two teams named in an article on the AFL website in August are St. Kilda Football Club and Gold Coast Suns.",

Napoli unveiled the new kits on Saturday, November 2, and wore them the following day in a match at home against Atalanta. The predominantly dark grey kit is inspired by Japanese culture and the twinning of Naples and Kagoshima, Japan, which have been sister cities since 1960. The tonal pattern on the kit is a mixture of Japanese and Italian artistic styles. It includes several Samurai objects — including the kabuto (helmet), the menpo (mask) and the katana sword — while melding a Japanese wave motif with a Neopolitan baroque style. Down the right side of the shirt are Japanese characters representing the seven Bushido virtues that are the principles of the Samurai: righteousness, respect, courage, honor, compassion, honesty and loyalty. Despite being so far away from each other, the twinning of the two ports is a symbol of their affinity and the unique characteristics that they share, from the gulfs to the volcanos that dominate the landscape: Vesuvius in Naples and Sakurajima in Kagoshima. The friendship between the two cities has led both of them to dedicate street names to each other: “Napoli-dori” (Naples street) in Kagoshima and “Via Kagoshima” in Naples. The collar, side panels and sleeve cuffs feature black trim, while the Napoli crest and sponsor logos on the chest are light blue. The kit was designed in collaboration with the Ten Shin – Cuore di Cielo Puro Soto Zen Temple in Naples and the Samurai Academy Naples. “The third kit perfectly places itself at the heart of our project ‘From Napoli to the World,’” said Tommaso Bianchini, the club’s chief revenue officer. “Starting in Naples, we arrive at the Japanese city of Kagoshima to tell the story of the relationship between these two distant cultures that are linked by a warrior’s spirit. With this shirt, we celebrate strength, respect and loyalty, which are values that we proudly bring onto the pitch.” Napoli’s next Serie A match is on Sunday, November 10, when they travel to the San Siro to face defending champions Inter Milan.",

The wordmark and number font on the off-white uniforms matches the signage seen around the United Center, including gate and seat numbers, while the overall color scheme was based on the exterior of the building, with shades of brown, gray and white.  Details steeped in history.@MotorolaUS | https://t.co/PqhESWUXtq pic.twitter.com/ZyZc75upU7 The design across the shoulders and down the sides of the shorts are supposed to mimic in-arena lights during the Bulls’ starting lineup introductions, while the logo on the waistband pulls inspiration from the windows near the top of the United Center’s walls. The uniforms are complete with the Bulls’ iconic diamond-shaped shorts design and a uniquely shaped logo above the jock tag on the jersey, which pays homage to the original marquee that stood outside of the arena and read “Home of The Bulls.” Chicago will wear its new City Edition uniforms eight times this season, including games against the Memphis Grizzlies on Nov. 23, Boston Celtics n Dec. 21, Milwaukee Bucks on Dec. 28, New York Knicks on Jan. 4, Philadelphia 76ers on Jan. 25, Golden State Warriors on Feb. 8, Phoenix Suns on Feb. 22 and Dallas Mavericks on March 29. The Bulls’ 2023-24 City Edition uniforms, meanwhile, were inspired by the old Chicago Stadium, which stood on the Near West Side for nearly 60 years before it was replaced by the United Center in 1994 and was affectionally referred to as the “Madhouse on Madison.”",

The club officially announced today that they are now known simply as Athletics. The new location-less name will stick for as long as the team plays in Sacramento, which looks like it will be for the next three seasons before they move to Las Vegas, where *I assume* they’ll be known as the Las Vegas Athletics. Once they take the field, this will be the first time in North America’s “Big Four” major sports leagues that a team has officially played a game without a location name in 80 years. The closest we saw to this in recent times was when the Anaheim Angels became the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and spent the next decade referring to themselves only as the Angels in just about everything aside from their preferred abbreviation, “LAA.” There’s really no obvious reason for the Athletics to go this route. The team already owns the trademarks for both Sacramento Athletics and Sacramento A’s. They could’ve proceeded just as the Angels did previously and reserved the use of Sacramento for standings and scoreboards while sticking to “Athletics” on their uniforms and all official releases. Along with the official name change came the official primary logo the Athletics will use while playing in Sacramento. There’s no surprise here; they’ll use just the “A’s” portion of Oakland’s logo, removing the green circle and the team name. Club officials had previously revealed the team’s uniforms would remain largely the same when they shifted to Sacramento, with all the “Oakland” logos replaced with “Athletics.” This would mean changes only to their road greys and Kelly green alternate jerseys. According to a post from @EvanDrellich on Twitter, the Athletics request the following: The club should be referred to only as “Athletics,” with the shorthand “A’s” allowed only after they’ve already been called Athletics. The team abbreviation will now be “ATH,” so you’ll see this on the TV scoreboards instead of “OAK” going forward. The A’s also do *not* play in Sacramento (my bad); they play in *West* Sacramento (maybe this is why they didn’t go with Sacramento Athletics?). They also mentioned the change, as I discussed earlier, to their primary logo. The name change has already been reflected in the club’s online presence. The team is now listed second alphabetically between Arizona and Atlanta, appearing only as “Athletics” on MLB.com’s team selection list as well as their online shop at MLBShop.com. The team’s official Twitter and Instagram accounts also have removed all references to Oakland.",

The Women’s Pro Baseball League (WPBL) announced last week that they are aiming to throw out their first pitch in less than two years’ time. The league is co-founded by Justine Siegal, also the founder of Baseball for All and the first woman to coach a professional men’s baseball team and to pitch batting practice against a Major League Baseball team. The logo on the league’s website depicts the letters in “WPBL” connected to each other, set in white on a black background. A baseball is depicted to the left of the W, aligned with the bottom of the letters. The league name is spelled to the right. The WPBL is also using a secondary logo as their social media profile picture. This logo consists of the W from the league logo, along with the baseball.

The WPBL will re-write history by creating an elite league that provides the world’s best female players with the platform they deserve and serve as a catalyst for the creation of a women’s baseball culture in America. “I am so excited that there will finally be a professional women’s baseball league – it is a dream come true for all the girls and women who play America’s Pastime,” Siegal said in a press release. “The Women’s Pro Baseball League is here for all the girls and women who dream of a place to showcase their talents and play the game they love. We have been waiting over 70 years for a professional baseball league we can call our own. Our time is now.” The WPBL’s other co-founder is Keith Stein, a Toronto-based lawyer and businessman who also serves as CEO of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Intercounty Baseball League. IBL players are college players and former professionals, and all nine teams are based in Southern Ontario. “We believe that the success of other women’s professional leagues such as the WNBA and NWSL demonstrates the incredible interest and support for women’s sport,” Stein said. Legendary Japanese pitcher Ayami Sato has joined the league as a special advisor, as has former Toronto Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston. The WPBL said in its press release that it will launch in summer 2026 with six teams based largely in the northeastern United States. Team names and logos were not included in last week’s announcement. The league also hopes to have a national broadcasting deal in place by the time the first pitch is thrown. More details about the league — including information for prospective team owners and players — is available on the WPBL website.  No related stories.",

Numbers to know for Week 9📰: https://t.co/BortIHSW58 pic.twitter.com/uDrzHXhIUF That includes the New York Giants breaking out their 1980-99 throwback uniforms for Sunday’s game against the Washington Commanders, marking the third straight year they’ll make an appearance against their NFC East rival. The uniforms feature a navy blue helmet with an underlined and italicized “Giants” wordmark on both sides, a royal blue jersey with a classic striping pattern on the collar and cuffs and white pants with red and blue stripes.  New York is 3-0-1 in the throwback uniforms since they debuted two years ago, including victories over the Chicago Bears in 2022 and the Commanders and Green Bay Packers in 2023. They also tied with Washington in 2022. TURN US UP.

Philadelphia went 2-0 in the throwback uniforms after unveiling them prior to last season, including wins over the Miami Dolphins and Buffalo Bills. They’ll also be worn later this season against the Dallas Cowboys on Dec. 29.  A classic look for a classic matchup#DETvsGB pic.twitter.com/NdhHY37ayw Keeping with the theme, the Green Bay Packers will wear their 1950s throwback uniforms during Sunday’s game against the Detroit Lions, marking their first appearance against an NFC North divisional opponent. The uniforms are reminiscent of what the Packers wore from 1950-53, with green jerseys featuring gold numbers and two gold stripes on the sleeves, green pants with a single gold stripe down the sides and green socks with stripes that match the sleeves.  The Packers are 2-1 in the throwback threads since they were unveiled, including wins over the Washington Football Team in 2021 and Los Angeles Chargers last season. Their lone loss came at the hands of the New York Jets in 2022.

Interestingly, the Buccaneers were considered the home team in that matchup, which they won 31-9, but chose to wear their white jerseys in the Super Bowl after having success in that combination throughout the 2020-21 playoffs.",

The Quebec Maritime Junior Hockey League team based in the provincial capital held a special “Les Boys” night on Friday, November 1, paying tribute to the 1997 comedy film that remains one of the most successful Quebecois movies ever. The Remparts’ jerseys for the game against the Sherbrooke Phoenix closely mirrored those worn by Les Boys, the team at the heart of the movie. The base of the jersey was yellow, with red shoulders and red, black and white stripes on the sleeves and waist. The front of the jersey featured a black puck with red streaks behind it and “Les REMPS” written overtop, taking cues from the logo used on the movie’s poster. Nos joueurs ADORENT le chandail des Remps…et on les comprend!Billets de c̷i̷n̷é̷m̷a̷ hockey » https://t.co/801IAPzOYP pic.twitter.com/1DaKuyCNEF The Remparts’ usual primary logo appeared on both shoulders. The names and numbers were red with yellow and black outlines. “LES REMPARTS DE QUÉBEC” was spelled out in black between the waist stripes to mimic where the name of the team’s sponsor appeared in the movie. The jerseys were paired with black helmets, pants and gloves. The socks were yellow with the same black, red and white striping pattern found on the sleeves. “Les Boys” was released in 1997 and directed by Louis Saïa. It follows a low-level amateur hockey team made up of a ragtag group of players, including a mechanic, a police officer, a doctor and a lawyer. In order to settle a gambling debt, the owner of the pub that sponsors the team puts up against a team assembled by a local crime boss. If Les Boys win, the debt is erased; if the mobster’s team wins, though, he gets the pub. “Les Boys” earned $3.3 million at the box office in Quebec, which, given the small market size, was considered a big success. It earned a total of $6 million at the box office across Canada and another $4 million in the United States. It also spawned three sequels — one of which featured appearances by several French-Canadian members of the Canadian Olympic women’s hockey team — one prequel and a television show that lasted five seasons.",

The Final Generation O Combo: Warp Speed.#GoDucks pic.twitter.com/CZZLb9vY8E The “Warp Speed” set is effectively the road version of the Ducks’ all-black “Fly Era” uniforms, which combine various elements from their previous uniform designs and debuted in their 32-31 win over Ohio State on Oct. 12.  That includes the wing pattern with a carbon fiber infill on the shoulders of the white jerseys, the diamond plate pattern that fits into the V-shaped seam of Nike’s Vapor F.U.S.E. template and the iridescent numbers, along other smaller details. The diamond plate pattern, specifically, was pulled from Oregon’s 2005-08 uniforms, and the decision to debut them in Ann Arbor isn’t a coincidence, either, as the Ducks notably beat the Wolverines, 39-7, in 2007. While our sources previously indicated the Ducks would wear dark green helmets on Saturday, just like they did in 2007, we’ve been told their equipment staff decided to switch up some combinations based on our reporting. Blinding speed. The story behind the threads.#GoDucks pic.twitter.com/tgecpLlqcO That’s why Oregon’s new “Warp Speed” uniforms are now complete with silver chrome helmets that feature silver wings and a green “O” on the back, creating a combination that was most recently worn in last season’s 38-30 win at Texas Tech. Interestingly, this won’t be the first time the Ducks wear the white pants from their “Warp Speed” set this season, as they also appeared in their 37-34 win over Boise State on Sept. 7 and 35-0 win at Purdue on Oct. 18. The other iiterations of Oregon’s new “Generation O” uniforms include the aforementioned “Fly Era” set, the “Gang Green” and “Mighty Oregon” throwback-inspired designs and their yellow and black “Heroes” uniforms, which are dedicated to those who have battled cancer.",

When Walker Buehler got Alex Verdugo of the New York Yankees to strike out, Dodgers fans rushed online, setting a new record for merchandise sales within the first hour after a championship clinch. This stat is according to Fanatics, who confirmed this was the highest initial sales figure across all sports throughout the online sports merch giant’s history. Within the first twelve hours of the victory, Dodgers merchandise sales were also 20% higher than during the same timeframe after their win four years ago back during the pandemic in 2020. Why is this? Well, they certainly got some help from the team’s sudden influx of fans in Japan. As you’d imagine, Japanese stars Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto were among the top-sellers regarding player-themed merch, with Mookie Betts, Clayton Kershaw, and World Series MVP Freddie Freeman also ranking high. (For what it’s worth, our Dodgers World Series gear affiliate links reported much fewer sales than usual. Maybe we don’t have too many Japanese readers!)
